INTRODUCING 
"CHINA RECONSTRUCTS" 
Wherever you live, we wish you and your country a happy and peaceful year in 1952. 
As our New Year gift, we send you the first issue of *CHINA RECONSTRUCTS. The 
purpose of CHINA RECONSTRUCTS is to present the work and achievements of the Chinese 
people to people abroad who believe that all nations should cooperate for peace and mutual benefit. 
The magazine will appear every two months?six issues a year. As its name indicates, it will 
concentrate on reporting reconstruction and new construction in our country and the changes that have 
come into the lives of our citizens. It will give up-to-date information on what China is doing to solve 
social, economic and cultural problems?both old and new. It will describe the nature and work of 
our educational and welfare services?and our relief activities based on self-help, so long as the need 
for relief continues. 
As practically everybody now knows and even the ill-disposed can no longer deny in the face 
of mounting facts, China has moved ahead tremendously in the two years since our People's Govern-
ment was established. 
Weak and divided for many decades, our country has become united from the borders of Siberia 
to the borders of Burma and Viet-Nam, from the Pacific shoreline to the middle of Asia. 
Long racked by malignant inflation which brought ruin to agriculture and urban occupations alike, 
China now has a stable price level and a nationwide economy that serves all the people. Our fac-
tories, both publicly and privately owned, are busy supplying tools and consumer goods to the peasants, 
80 per cent of our population. Our villages, in their turn, are sending ample food to the cities. For 
the first time in 73 years, we have a favourable balance of foreign trade. 
Up to two years ago, China had to import food, yet many people were hungry. Now, with 
the land reform, with constantly increasing production, and improved communications speeding up 
distribution, our people are eating well. We have even been able to ship rice to fill the needs of 
our neighbour, India. 
Moreover, events have proved that China is now a strong country. She is strong enough to 
defend what has already been done and to ensure further progress along the lines that have already 
yielded such fruits. She is strong enough to repel all attempts to turn back the clock. 
CHINA RECONSTRUCTS will chronicle the life of the Chinese people in authoritative 
articles, vivid features, representative photographs, drawings and charts. It will relate how difficulties 
are overcome and problems are solved. It will report on our resurgent art, literature, music, drama and 
cinema--on works that embody our best national traditions and our new experiences. 
CHINA RECONSTRUCTS will introduce you to some of the people who are helping to 
build the nation, the rank-and-file men and women who are the makers and motive power of our 
progress. It will report how old and young, workers, peasants, scholars, scientists and professionals, 
industrialists and businessmen, people of various religious beliefs and no religion, of various political 
parties and of no party, are cooperating in tasks that benefit all. 
In placing this first issue in your hands, we want you, the reader, to feel that CHINA 
RECONSTRUCTS exists to serve your needs. lf you have questions, write us about them. If you 
have criticisms or suggestions, let us know. We welcome praise too?but most of all we want to know 
how we may help fill gaps in your knowledge of the fields we cover. That is the way we hope to 
bring closer the peoples of China and the countries where our readers reside. 
Once again, we wish you a year of advance toward peace.

WELFARE WORK AND WORLD PEACE 
There is a direct correlation 
between world peace and welfare 
work. They run parallel to one 
another, prosper under the same 
conditions and deteriorate from 
the same causes. Build peace and 
you enhance welfare. Destroy 
peace and you eliminate welfare. 
It follows, therefore, that the 
attitude of a government towards 
war and peace determines the 
welfare programme it plans and 
operates for its people. 
The unprecedented progress of 
well work in the new China 
this past year reflects our ardent 
desire for peace. For example, 
labour insurance has become the 
law of our land for the first time. 
Its many benefits are gradually 
spreading, reaching millions of 
workers and their families. In 
other sectors of our national life, 
giant and fundamental solutions 
have been undertaken for age-
old problems, such as the floods 
with which the Huai river has 
plagued our people for thirty cen-
SOONG CHING LING 
tunes. Child care, medical ser-
vices, workers' housing and mo-
dern facilities for workers' dis-
tricts, rural services of many 
varieties?all are growing and 
raising the living standards of the 
people right before our eyes. 
Such progress can only result 
from a policy which prizes peace 
and pursues the aim of peaceful 
relations among all nations. 
We have such a policy. It 
arises directly from the needs of 
the Chinese people and the pro-
gress that it has brought is the 
result of their strength. The new 
welfare programme of our country 
emphasizes the use of the people's 
might to overcome all problems, 
a basic approach clearly formu-
lated at last year's All-China Peo-
ple's Relief Conference by Vice-
Premier Tung Pi-wu. In his de-
tailed speech on that occasion, 
Vice-Premier Tung described how 
welfare work is now in the hands 
of the people, how it has become 
part of a tremendous overall re-
construction effort and how it is 
founded on the principle of self-
reliance. 
Such policies, principles and 
progress are possible only in na-
tions that are truly independent 
?nations that allow no infractions 
of their own right of self-deter-
mination while at the same time 
seeking cooperation with all who 
respect that right. In fact, the 
effort a government puts into peo-
ple's welfare is not only an ac-
curate measure of its devotion? to 
peace; it is also a reflection of its 
status among the nations of the 
world. 
We know that in countries 
which are still in colonial or semi-
colonial bondage, welfare work 
for the people is either nil or ex-
ists merely as a deceptive show-
case, serving only a tiny percent-
age of those who need it. Vivid 
confirmation of this may be found 
even in the reports submitted by 
the colony-owning powers them-
selves to economic and trusteeship 
organs of the United Nations, al-
though these obviously put the 
best possible face on a situation 
that is actually much worse than 
they admit. 
History has shown too that 
when the rulers of any country 
seek to perpetuate colonial slavery 
or to dominate the entire world 
by force, their own people are 
among the first sufferers, as ex-
ploitation rises and welfare pro-
grammes disappear to make way 
for arms budgets. Published facts 
on "wage-freezes," skyrocketing 
prices, speeding up of workers, 
material shortages and falling 
educational and health expendi-
tures in the United States, Britain

hai workers' families who got a mouth's

and western Europe, provide 
many illustrations of this axiom 
right now. 
On the other hand, rising living 
standards and welfare provisions 
are evident in every country 
where the people rule, where 
state power serves the majority 
instead of small minorities, either 
domestic or. foreign. Whether we 
look at China, or the Soviet Union, 
or central and eastern Europe, 
we find that the damage of war 
has been repaired, new industries 
are growing, wages have risen and 
prices fallen in the last few years. 
Welfare and educational facilities, 
both in terms of total budget out-
lays and in terms of tangible im-
provements in the lives of work-
ing people, are increasing steadily 
and very fast. At the same time, 
mutual aid among these countries 
helps each one to accelerate its 
gains. All these facts are not 
only recorded in their own reports 
but admitted in serious studies by 
persons and groups who are not 
at all well-disposed towards them. 
Here again the economic publica-
tions of the United Nations can 
be c ited. 
That China is on the side of 
peace, yet at the same time able 
both to defend herself and help 
her neighbours, is of special inter-
est to the other peoples of Asia. 
They have seen how our peasants 
are now the masters of their own 
fields, how our workers have be-
come masters in some of our fac-
tories and equal partners in 
others. They have seen how this 
has released the creative and pro-
ductive forces of our people so 
that the output of material wealth 
in China grows both generally and 
in terms of each worker. They 
know that, in two years, we have 
not only solved our food problem 
but begun to export grain, some-
thing unheard-of in the past. 
They have witnessed how our 
welfare work has grown to be an 
integral part of the nation's life, 
developing in the healthy atmo-
sphere of a country that controls 
its own destiny. 
Such is the status of welfare 
work in the People's Republic of 
China, which is one of the staun-
chest bulwarks of world peace. 
N.-FEB. 1952 
Soong Ching Ling (Mme. Sun Yat-sen) renowned fighter for peace 
and democracy in China and the world, is Chairman of the China 
Welfare Institute and the People's Relief Administration of China. 
She was awarded the Stalin International Peace Prize in 1951. 
Our people have absolutely no-
thing to gain from war. Only 
peace is in our interest, so that 
we may further develop our ser-
vices to the people and enlarge 
our contribution to the welfare of 
the world. 
It should be clear too that the 
progress we have made is precious 
to us. Any aggressor will find 
that we will defend it with every 
ounce of our strength and cour-
age. We will neither allow our-
selves to be oppressed nor deny 
aid to others who suffer oppres-
sion. We stand for a peace among 
equals, with each people deter-
mining its own life. 
We desire friendship and co-
operation with all countries and 
peoples who are willing to live 
at peace and to trade for mutual 
benefit, regardless of what their 
form of government may be or 
what views they may hold. 
This outlook, uniting a country 
of 475,000,000 people, helps as 
never before to guarantee that 
peace will conquer war all over 
the world. It menaces no other 
nation and no honest person any-
where. It helps all who are work-
ing and fighting to make man-
kind's dearest dreams of peace 
and well-being come true in our 
own day.

ENDING THE FLOOD MENACE 
The greatest water control ef-
fort in Chinese history is now 
underway in the valley of the 
Huai river, which contains over 
50 million peasants and covers one 
seventh of all China's cultivated 
land. 
The work was begun in 
November 1950. Eight and a half 
months later, in July 1951, its 
first phase had been successfully 
completed. This result was 
achieved thanks to the planning 
and leadership of the Chinese 
Communist Party and the Central 
People's Government. It was 
brought about by the organized 
energy of 2,200,000 peasants who 
did the excavation work, of 
thousands of Chinese workers and 
technicians whose labour and in-
genuity supplied machinery and 
installations which previously al-
ways had to be imported, and of 
hundreds of conservancy engi-
neers applying advanced but at the 
same time economical methods 
developed in the Soviet Union. 
The primary aim of the project 
is to put an end to the constant 
flood menace in the Huai valley. 
Already, as a result of the first 
phase, the population is safer from 
floods than ever before. When 
the whole scheme is completed, 
within three to five years, floods 
will be banished altogether. 
Hundreds of miles of waterways 
will become navigable. Millions 
of acres of farmland will be 
secured against drought by irriga-
tion. The waters of the Huai and 
its tributaries will begin to gen-
erate large amounts of electric 
power for the people.

FU TSO-Yl 
The accomplishments to date 
include the creation of 1,120 miles 
of earth dykes, the dredging of 
170 miles of river beds and the 
building of 56 concrete locks and 
other installations. Over 16 mil-
lion cubic yards of earth have 
already been moved. Work has 
begun on 16 major reservoirs, 
several large dams and a great 
network of irrigation ditches, 
culverts and other drainage facili-
ties throughout the area. 
What has been done in these 
months testifies to the tremendous 
energies awakened by our revolu-
tion. Already it exceeds, in 
volume and effectiveness, all the 
work done in the Huai valley in 
hundreds of years of past history. 
The Huai and Its Histery 
The Huai is one of the big rivers 
of China. Rising in the Tung Po 
mountains, it runs for 683 miles 
through the three important pro-
vinces of Honan, Anhwei and 
Kiangsu. In the north the Huai 
valley connects with that of the 
uncontrolled Yellow River. In 
the south it connects with the 
Yangtze valley. In the east, the 
Huai river flows into the Yellow 
Sea. 
Passing through Honan and 
northern Anhwei, the river is fed 
by ten large tributaries and many 
smaller ones. Some of them, 
flowing down steep mountains, 
are extremely rapid and tur-
bulent. The Huai itself by con-
trast is wide and deep, calm and 
navigable for most of the year. 
But in the rainy months of July 
and August the inflow from the 
tributaries frequently causes it to 
flood great areas. This tendency 
is aggravated by four "bottle-
necks" along the river's course. 
When in flood, the "young maid-
en," as the Huai has been called 
in tribute to its usually serene dis-
position, has often turned into a 
bearer of death and destruction. 
Another cause of floods on the 
Huai river, and much more seri-
ous ones than the almost annual 
inundations of the tributaries has 
been its northern neighbour, the 
great Yellow River. There are 
no mountain ridges to divide the 
Yellow River from the Huai. The 
plateau that separates them is 100 
to 150 feet higher in the north 
than in the south. When the Yel-
low River overflows, its waters 
often come down the slope to try 
and usurp the bed of the Huai, 
filling it up with silt. This has 
often caused the Huai, in its turn, 
to burst south into the Yangtze. 
For 661 years of Chinese his-
tory, between 1194 A.D. and 1855 
A.D., the Yellow River emptied 
into the sea through the Huai and 
had no other outlet. During these 
centuries, it filled the Huai with 
sediment, raised the water-level 
in many of the lakes connected 
with it, and generally slowed its 
course. It also wrecked the whole 
lake system between the Huai 
and the Yangtze and created a 
constant threat of flood to 10 mil-
lion mow (about 1.7 million acres) 
of rice fields along the Grand 
Canal. 
In 1855, when the Yellow River 
abandoned its southern course and 
began to flow into the sea north

of the Shantung peninsula along 
its present bed, the Huai river 
also changed its habits complete-
ly. Its old mouth became com-
pletely blocked with silt. Instead 
of reaching the sea, the Huai be-
gan to flow into the Yangtze. 
The situation remained more or 
less constant until the reactionary 
Kuomintang government, caring 
nothing for the people, broke the 
Yellow River dykes at Huayuan-
kow in Honan for what it consid-
ered to be a temporary military 
advantage. As a result, tremen-
dous areas were flooded. The 
?Yellow River once more invaded 
the Huai, and flowed to the sea 
through the Huai for nine years, 
until 1947. The whole drainage 
system of the Huai valley was 
destroyed. The mouths of many 
of its tributaries were stopped 
with mud. Much of the network 
of irrigation ditches in the Huai 
valley was completely obliterated. 
The bed of the Huai itself filled 
up considerably. The flow of 
the Huai river at Pengpu fell 
from 102,000 cubic feet per second 
in 1931 to 99,000 cubic feet per 
second in 1950. Nevertheless the 
water level rose by about three 
feet in the same period. The re-
duced capacity of the Huai result-
ed in a further increase in flood 
threats. 
A Thousand Floods?And 
Nothing Done 
What the Chinese people have 
suffered from failure to control 
the Huai river may be gathered 
from one figure. Our historical 
records count no less than 979 
floods along its course between 
246 B.C. and 1948 A.D. In other 
words, the Huai has produced a 
HUAI RIVEn. 
flood every two years for some 
seventy generations! 
There are three basic conditions 
making for floods along the Huai. 
They have always been the same 
and have been known for cen-
turies. In the headwaters and 
along the tributaries of the Huai, 
there have not been enough in-
stallations to check and hold 
water. Its middle reaches have 
lacked storage reservoirs. In its 
lower valley, close to the sea and 
the Grand Canal, the outlets were 
too limited to hold the flow. It 
has been known for a long time 
that no single one of these condi-
tions could be remedied independ-
ently. The river could be con-
trolled only if all three types of 
work were undertaken at once. 
Such an overall job of reclama-
tion was precisely what old China,

with its predatory special inter-
ests, clashes between regional 
groups of exploiters and ultimate 
semi-colonial subservience to im-
perialism had neither the motive 
nor the capacity to undertake. 
On the contrary, the feudal and 
dynastic conflicts of the old 
society, its long decay and the 
disintegration that attended its 
death-throes frequently destroyed 
even the local attempts at control 
in which the people themselves 
invested so much labour. 
After the Yellow River rushed 
into the Huai in 1194, neither the 
rulers of the Sung dynasty nor 
those of the Yuan (Mongol) 
dynasty which succeeded it under-
took any measures at all. 
The two subsequent dynasties, 
the Ming (1368-1644) and the 
Manchu Ching (1644-1911 A.D.) 
did allocate great sums of money 
for work on the Yellow and Huai 
rivers. These sums, wrung in 
taxes from the people, were quite 
sufficient to return the Yellow 
River to its old course and dredge 
and adjust the entire Huai. What 
happened, however, was that a 
part was misappropriated by of-
ficials and the rest was used in a 
greedy and short-sighted way. 
With the capital established in 
Peking, the Ming and Ching em-
perors thought only of the Grand 
Canal which carried about 200,000 
tons of tax rice to Peking annual-
ly for the needs of the court. In-
stead of getting at the root of the 
Huai floods, they piled up ever-
higher dykes and embankments 
to keep them away from the canal. 
This kind of dyke building mere-
ly aggravated the floods in higher 
areas by damming them up. When 
the pressure of water proved too 
great and the canal dykes were 
breached, which happened fre-
quently, the lower valley of the 
Huai, in north Kiangsu, also suf-
fered disastrous inundations. 
In 1855, when the Yellow Rive' 
turned once more to its northern 
sea exit, the Manchu empire could 
think of nothing but to "let nature 
take its course." The warlord 
rulers of the early years of the 
Republic did no better. After 
6 
the calamitous floods of 1931, the 
Kuomintang regime, which had 
by then been in power for four 
years, began to speak loudly about 
conservancy work on the Huai. 
But the reactionary Chen Kuo-fu, 
then Chairman of the Kiangsu 
Provincial Government, insisted 
rhat work be done in his province 
alone. The interests of the in-
habitants of the upper valley, and 
the correct method of controlling 
the Huai, were again ignored for 
the interests of local landlords. 
Money was squeezed from the 
people as usual, some construction 
work was begun, but the whole 
"plan" and its execution soon dis-
solved in the rackets and corrup-
tion typical of "politics" at the 
time. 
By breaking the Yellow River 
dykes in 1938, and thus deliberate-
ly destroying the Huai river 
system no less effectively than the 
natural floods of 1194 and 1855 
A.D., the Kuomintang reaction-
aries exposed their own complete 
bankruptcy and left the people a 
heritage of woe. 
The Project's Origin and Goals 
As a result of past abuses, an-
other serious flood took place in 
the Huai valley in 1950, the year 
of its liberation. More than 40 
million mow (6.6 million acres) of 
cultivated land were submerged. 
The distress that attended this 
flood, however, was much less 
than in comparable occurrences in 
the past. The People's Govern-
ment undertook immediate reme-
dial measures which saved lives 
and property. Flood-stricken 
people were rapidly organized for 
labour and hundreds of thousands 
of tons of rice were brought to 
feed them. Clothing was collected 
throughout the country and those 
who had lost their own effects 
were re-equipped. The people 
who had never experienced such 
care and aid from the government 
and the whole country before, 
worked with will and hope to 
mend dykes and otherwise limit 
the spread of the flood. There 
was no starvation.

The 1950 flood occurred in July. 
In August, the Administration 
Council of the Central People's 
Government, acting on a directive 
from Chairman Mao Tse-tung, 
met to consider how to harness 
the Huai. In September, it adopt-
ed a resolution to initiate the giant 
project now under way. Water 
conservancy experts from all 
parts of the country, summoned 
to Peking, drew up necessary 
plans in the short space of two 
months. By November, work was 
in progress on the actual sites. 
Out of consideration for the 
people, the time-table for the first 
phase was so arranged as to rid 
the Huai valley of the threat 
of serious floods from 1950 
on. Successful meeting of the 
July deadline has made this goal 
a reality. When the rainy season 
arrived last year, the Huai was 
protected not only by relatively 
advanced works of a permanent 
nature but also by temporary 
structures to take care of current 
emergencies. There was no flood-
ing in 1951. 
Longer-range river control plans, 
for the first time in history, were 
based not on regional claims but 
on the needs of the Huai valley 
as a whole, the upper reaches as 
well as the lower, the battle 
against droughts as well as the 
battle against floods. The irriga-
tion systems that will arise will 
water from six to nine million 
mow (one to 1.7 million acres) of 
land in the upper reaches of the 
river and 35 million mow (6 mil-
lion acres) each in the middle and 
lower valley. In navigation, the 
controlled river will carry trans-
port where it is most needed, be-
tween points that play an impor-
tant part in the interchange of 
commodities between city and 
country, producers and markets. 
Steamers plying the Grand Canal 
will be able to turn westward and 
proceed along the Huai to points 
in Honan beyond the Peking-
Hankow railway. The Tientsin-
Pukow and Peking-Hankow rail-
ways will be connected by a new 
water link. 
As for electric power, there are 
no natural sites for its production 
in the broad, flat Huai valley. 
Workers swinging 220-lb. stones to compact earthwork in the 
traditional Chinese way. Later there will be machines to do this. 
But the new reservoir, dyke and 
sluice systems will provide op-
portunities to generate a sizable 
supply for the needs of both agri-
culture and industry in the region. 
Work Done and to be Done 
I would now like to outline in 
some detail how the Government 
Administration Council analyzed 
conditions on the Huai river and 
the remedial measures already 
taken and to be taken. 
Generally speaking, it was 
found that the existing drainage 
system of the Huai was capable of 
holding only half its water load 
in cases of flood on the scale of 
1931 or 1950. Since the rainfall 
in the Huai valley in July, August 
and September is out of all pro-
portion greater than that in other 
parts of the year, the risk of com-
parable floods would be constant 
so long as this situation was not 
changed. 
At the same time, due to the 
uneven distribution of rainfall, 
the valley generally suffered from 
droughts in the spring, when the 
peasants were most in need of 
water for their fields. The prob-
lem with regard to the Huai was 
therefore not merely to speed up 
the flow to the sea, but to store 
the water where it would be re-
quired for irrigation purposes in 
the dry season. 
To prevent the river from be-
coming unduly swollen by rains, it 
was decided to dredge the entire 
drainage system of the Huai of 
the Yellow River silt that blocks 
it. To store water where it is 
needed, dams and reservoirs were 
planned at suitable places. 
In the mountainous upper reaches 
of the Huai, trees are being planted 
and small basins, tanks and dams 
constructed to slow the flow of 
water and prevent soil from being 
washed off the hills by torrential 
downpours. The sixteen big arti-
ficial reservoirs comprising the 
system, with a total capacity of 
109 billion cubic feet, are to be in-
stalled along the upper tributaries 
?the Hung, Hsi, Kuan, Pu and 
Ying rivers. One, the Shihman-
tan reservoir at the headwaters of

the Hung, has already been com-
pleted. Two others will be in 
operation by the end of 1951. 
Drainage of excess water from the 
slopes is to be accomplished by 
local ditches dug by the organized 
effort of the people. 
The new reservoirs are being 
supplemented by work on the Lo-
wang, Chiaoting, Tung and Wu-
sung lakes in Honan province. 
These "lakes" were formerly no 
more than low-lying marshes con-
nected with the course of the 
river, too frequently flooded to 
serve as cropland yet not storing 
enough water at the right times. 
The job of converting them for 
storage purposes is to be finished 
in 1951. With their help, the total 
storage capacity in the upper 
reaches of the Huai will be 
brought to 60 billion cubic feet, 
helping greatly to secure the 
region against flood while the 
new reservoir system is still in-
complete. Moreover, since water 
will be allowed to flow into them 
only when flood conditions require 
it, the lake beds will be cultivated 
to produce at least one crop a 
year. This will greatly benefit 
the entire area and its people. 
Lower down, in north Anhwei 
province, there are other marshy 
lakes on either side of the Huai. 
Excluding the big Hungtse lake, 
they have an area of 741,320 acres. 
Their capacity will be brought to 
254 billion cubic feet by the end of

1951. In this way the flow of the 
Huai in its middle reaches will be 
brought under effective control. 
The main control installation in 
the middle reaches, located at 
Jenhochi in northern Anhwei pro-
vince, has already been built. It 
consists of three parts. The first 
is a fixed deep channel 255 feet 
wide. The second is a long mov-
able dam 984 feet wide, with 
eight sluice gates?five of 147 feet 
each, one of 69 feet and three of 
48 feet?across the broadened 
river bed. The third is a 585-foot 
fixed dam at the entrance with 
two sluice gates of 147 feet each 
and two of 69 feet. 
Work at Jenhochi was begun in 
April and finished in July 1951. 
To achieve it over 200,000 tons of 
industrial material, mainly cement 
and steel, were brought to the

site. The 1,300 tons of steel sluice 
gates and machinery, of a type 
China always imported in the 
past, were successfully made in 
Shanghai in the space of two 
months and installed by techni-
cians and workers from that city 
who came to Jenhochi. Concrete 
mixers on the dam sites were also 
of Chinese manufacture. The 
fulfilment of this project was an 
impressive demonstration of the 
organizational and industrial 
capacities already present in our 
country but never previously 
used. 
The Shihmantan reservoir, the 
Jenhochi installations and the 
dyke construction elsewhere have 
already considerably mitigated 
the danger of flood in the part of 
the Huai valley that lies in Honan 
province, secured northern An-
hwei against dyke breaches and 
guaranteed the wheat crops in 
that area against flood damage. 
The work in the lower reaches, 
directed mainly at strengthening 
dykes along the Grand Canal and 
renovating local waterways lead-
ing into the Huai, will do the same 
thing for north Kiangsu. 
The removal of the perennial 
causes of floods along the Huai is 
thus already considerably advanc-
ed. With the completion of the 
entire project, the scourge of 
thousands of years will cease to 
exist.

How Our People Are Working 
I myself travelled along the en-
tire course of the Huai river ear-
lier this year, inspecting the pro-
gress of the work over a distance 
of more than six hundred miles. 
What impressed me most of all 
on this trip was the change in the 
outlook of our peasants following 
the land reform, which for the 
first time has given them land of 
their own, free of both rents and 
debt. This change is decisive for 
the harnessing of the Huai, be-
cause the peasants engaged on the 
project know they are toiling for 
themselves. They work with an 
enthusiasm inconceivable in the 
water conservancy undertakings 
of the past, when they were em-
ployed or driven by landlord in-
terests which reaped the full 
benefit of any improvements 
achieved. It is their own land, 
their own crops that they are now 
protecting?and they know it. 
Needless to say this proud con-
sciousness has also improved the 
relations between the workers and 
the leading and technical person-
nel. With all ranks now working 
for the same goal instead of one 
exploiting the other, mutual con-
fidence and appreciation have re-
placed the former hostility and 
compulsion. One has only to see 
these millions of people working 
in a harmonious and organized 
manner, in the full knowledge of 
what they are doing and why, to 
realize that our country has at 
last really risen to its feet. With 
the titanic force this has generated 
one feels there is nothing we 
cannot accomplish! 
Another strong impression is 
the closeness of the people to the 
Communist party and the govern-
ment?their party and their gov-
ernment. In giving the people 
land and power over their own 
destinies, the party and govern-
ment sank deep roots in every 
village and hamlet. In the 1950

flood, tens of thousands of party 
and government personnel moved 
into the afflicted areas, sharing 
the dangers and privations of the 
peasants, leading them in the fight 
for food, helping them in the au-
tumn planting of devastated 
fields, organizing mutual aid 
groups and subsidiary occupations 
such as mat-weaving, hemp pro-
cessing and fishing?in a word, 
saving their lives. This experi-
ence, unheard of in the old China, 
has created a unity and intimacy 
as strong and close as that of flesh 
and bone. Now the government 
has only to call and millions of 
peasants respond. 
In responding to the mobiliza-
tion to free their valley of floods 
altogether, the people of the Huai 
river have seen trains, steamships, 
motor-driven junks, wooden boats 
10 
and long lines of trucks come un-
endingly from all parts of the 
country bringing needed ma-
terials, administrators, technical 
men, doctors, nurses, teachers, and 
lecturers, actors and mobile mov-
ing picture teams. They have 
convinced themselves once more 
that they have only to work for 
their own interest to receive all 
the aid and comfort that all of 
China can give. They understand 
that they are no longer isolated, 
no longer ignored or oppressed 
but great, strong and self-reliant. 
The viewpoint of the peasants 
themselves is no longer local. 
They know that it was Chairman 
Mao Tse-tung who decided to tame 
the Huai river and avert new 
calamities without delay, without 
being deterred by the other grave 
and urgent problems that face the 
country. They know that the 
People's Government has cut 
through all the old regional 
selfishness to lay strong hands on 
the Huai and turn it from a tyrant 
into a servant of the people. They 
know that water conservancy, and 
the Huai river work in particular, 
has been assigned a high percent-
age of the national budget. 
The unprecedented Huai river 
project both benefits our agricul-
ture and helps prepare for great 
new steps in our industrialization. 
It is changing the face of a large 
section of the country. While 
howls for war are heard through-
out the imperialist world, China is 
engaged in a gigantic peaceful ef-
fort that once more demonstrates 
not only the constructive ability 
of our people but their will and 
their strength for peace.

Villages in in China's cotton-grow-

sale season in 1951. The buyer 
was the People's Government. 
Prices were good. Carts and pack-
mules loaded with huge bags of 
cotton were colourfully decoratdd 
with red and green flags read-

Peasants accompanied the carts 
and mule trains beating on drums

In each district, peasants com-

ers in Shanghai, Tientsin and 
Tsingtao, pledging to keep the

National Cotton & Yarn Corpora-
tion stayed up late into the night 
working on their accounts. 
Problem Last Year 
At one period during the spring 
of 1951, textile mills in Chinese 
.T.-FEB. 1952 
cities found themselves in dif-
ficulties. Land reform and gov-
ernment assistance to cotton-
growers had made 1950 a good 
year for the peasants. Thy had 
plenty of cash in their pockets 
after selling only a portion of the 
cotton crop in the fall, and were 
therefore not particularly inter-
ested in further sales in the spring. 
The peasants stored their cotton 
as city people save money. Some 
hoarded against a coming wed-
ding. Others wanted to keep the 
cotton "for the women to spin." 
One peasant simply said: "It does 
my heart good to see it there, all 
white and puffy, when I come in 
from the fields. Besides, I don't 
need cash right away." 
The Government Calls 
On June 1, 1951 the People's 
Government published a directive, 
frankly describing the seriousness 
of the situation. It called upon 
the peasants to sell their cotton 
stocks at once. The price offered 
was a fair one. Peasants who did 
not wish th sell immediately were 
urged to deposit their cotton in

government warehouses, to be 
paid for at the current price any 
time they wished. "This will be 
considered a patriotic action, an 
important contribution from the 
peasants to the nation," the direc-
tive said. 
In villages in every cotton-
growing area, along the Yangtze 
and Yellow rivers, in the north-
eastern provinces and the vast 
plains of the Northwest, peasants 
gathered to discuss the directive. 
None of them had realized up to 
then that it made much difference 
whether they sold their cotton or 
held it until they needed more 
money. 
Discussion in the Villages 
The assembled peasants recalled 
the past. They related how, be-
fore liberation, they used to sell 
all their cotton and still not have 
enough to pay rent and taxes. The 
crop had hardly been picked when 
the Kuomintang paochia chang

mands for money. Most families 
could not keep enough cotton to 
make padded winter garments, 
and had to shiver through the 
cold weather in thin rags. The 
spring often found them with 
no rice. Many was the year when 
whole villages lived on weeds and 
tree bark till the next harvest. 
By contrast, the peasants could 
now point to all the new property 
that they had been able to buy 
after the People's Government 
relieved them of the load of sup-
porting landlords and corrupt 
officials in luxury. The general 
sentiment was well expressed by 
peasant Shen Ping, who declared 
at one village meeting: "We 
mustn't forget past pain just be-
cause our wounds have healed. To 
protect our present good life, let's 
help the government which has 
helped us." 
Husbands and Wives 
As a result of similar meetings 
conducted by the Democratic 
Women's Federations, the peasant 
women soon came to vie with 
their husbands in offering cotton 
for sale to the government. 
Peasant Wang Tien-tai of Hoting 
had made a pledge to sell 1,100 
lbs. to the cooperative in his 
village. He found a little trouble 
in explaining just why he had 
done it to his wife at home. To 
his surprise, when the women held 
their own meeting, his wife got 
up to speak, mentioned the amount 
of cotton in the house, and offered 
it herself "to make our good life 
last." 
Another woman, Wang Ching-
chih, stood up and said: "If the 
men can be patriotic, I don't see 
why we can't. I went through 
enough hell when the Japanese 
devils were here. I'm not going 
to go through the same thing with 
the Americans. I have some 
ginned cotton stored up, and I'm 
going to sell it to the government." 
In a cotton village, in Chengan 
district, each family met separate-

ly to decide what to do. Peasant 
Liu Ching-kwei, for example, 
asked the women in his house: 
"Do you want to wear flower-print 
dresses?" When the women said 
they did, Liu clinched the argu-
ment: "Then we must sell our 
cotton to the government, which 
will send it to the mills to have fine 
cloth woven and printed for you." 
There were no further objections 
and Liu delivered 1,100 pounds. 
Why Peasants Responded 
Why did such simple discussions 
suffice to bring cotton to the sale 
stations? Because the People's 
Government had already won the 
loyalty and confidence of the 
growers, not by words but by 
real proofs of concern for their 
interests. 
The government had been res-
ponsible for keeping the ratio of 
cotton to grain prices at a con-
stantly fair rate, enabling pro-
ducers to eat well at all times. It 
had protected them from loss due 
to their own actions. In the sum-
mer of 1950, when many had 
dumped stocks fearing that the 
Korean war would spread to 
Chinese cities and mills would no 
longer buy, the government had 
kept speculators from pushing 
prices down. 
The government had also helped 
cotton growers to improve their 
work with technical advice, pro-
viding them with equipment and 
services. When cotton was being 
planted last April, it sent special-
ists to the countryside to help the 
cotton growers conquer drought. 
It extended loans to sink thou-
sands of new wells, and dig 
irrigation ditches. It mobilized 
six million peasants in Hopei pro-
vince to spray 1,480 tons of insecti-
cide, which saved 2,000,000 acres of 
the cotton crop. 
The government had sold soy-
bean cake, a high-grade fertilizer, 
to growers at low prices and on 
easy credit terms. Finally it had 
helped cotton-growing villages in 
every problem of livelihood, seeing 
that they were supplied at all 
times with food, cloth, salt and 
other daily needs. It had also sold

them cheap fuel for cooking and 
winter heating, a constant problem 
to Chinese cotton farmers who 
have no stubble and straw to burn 
like grain-growers. 
Since liberation, large amounts 
of coal have been brought to the 
villages. In the past, only city 
people in China had coal to burn. 
More Abundant Life 
As a result of this varied aid, 
production increased and the 
livelihood of the farmerswimproved 
beyond recognition. In 1950, even 
though the growers did not 
sell their whole crop, their pur-
chasing power outstripped the 
goods within reach. 
An investigation in Ha ntan, 
Hopei province, showed that 
peasants were eating fine flour and 
polished rice instead of the coarse 
foods of the past. During January 
1951, no less than 1,170,000 feet of 
cloth were sold in the district; a 
third more than in January 1950 
when there was an inflationary 
buying spree. Peasant women 
had new flowered dresses and 
bedspreads. Children's clothes 
were fresh and gay. 
Weddings increased, with con-
sequent good business for the silk 
merchants in Kiangsu and Che-
kiang provinces. New houses had 
tile floors instead of oiled paper 
in the windows. Flashlights and 
bicycles were in big demand. In

harvest, every one of the 400 
families bought a new electric 
torch and one out of every four 
families acquired a bicycle. 
The peasants themselves can't 
stop talking about their new 
prosperity. They tell each other: 
"There used not to be a bicycle in. 
the whole village; and now look!" 
Stockings, rubbers, sweaters, knit-
ted underwear, thermos bottles 
are becoming necessities to people 
who used none of these things in 
their whole previous lives. Many 
village girls now buy high-grade 
face towels, hair lotions and cold 
cream of Shanghai manufacture. 
A pedlar has only to push his cart 
into a cotton-growing village to 
find his needles, combs, hairpins 
and other goods disappear and 
himself the possessor of a thou-
sand or so pounds of cotton. 
The technical equipment of 
cotton farms is also growing 
rapidly. Hundreds of new carts, as 
well as used auto tires, to replace 
the previous iron wheel-rims, have 
been sold in Hantan district since 
the harvest. In Hunghsiang alone, 
hardware merchants sold 631/2 tons 
of metal farm implements in one 
month. Not long ago, cotton 
growers of Hsiaoho village sent 
delegates to Peking to have a look 
at some tractors. 
More and More Cotton 
The area under cotton in 1951 
was 30.2 per cent greater than 
in 1950. It was more than 17 
per cent greater than the highest 
acreage recorded in pre-war years. 
Owing to the working enthu-
siasm and improved technique of 
the peasants, the average yield 
per acre was also higher, by 33 
per cent, than the best pre-war 
figure. 
Textile mills, which used to import cot-
ton, now get ample domestic supplies.

Health For All The People 
Anyone familiar with the so-
called medical services and medical 
work in old China would be ex-
tremely surprised to see what 
great strides in public health have 
been made in the two brief years 
since the formation of the People's 
Republic of China. Even a super-
ficial survey, or merely a quick 
trip through some part of the 
country, would reveal intensive 
health work going on in the 
cities and countryside, in mills, 
mines and factories, on trains 
and in village schools. Today 
hardly any corner of our vast 
country has been left untouched 
by the broadly conceived and 
efficiently executed public health 
programme, which draws in all 
medical workers and is directed 
toward the whole population. 
On all the main railways, as for 
example the Peking-Hankow line, 
special cars are reserved for 
mothers and children. A medical 
attendant is available at all times 
on the train. In the course of any 
long journey several organized 
talks are given to the mothers on 
child and maternal health care?
covering such subjects as child 
feeding, children's infectious 
diseases and their prevention, 
child clothing, what to do in 
various emergencies, what to do 
during a pregnancy and so on. 
Over the general loudspeaker 
system, providing music, enter-
tainment and news for the pas-
sengers, there are additional talks 
on health topics such as diet, pre-
vention of intestinal diseases like 
diarrhoea and typhoid, or preven-
tion of respiratory diseases. Other 
health talks relate to regional 
endemic diseases and their pre-
vention (such as malaria in the 
south or typhus in the north). 
LI TEH-CHUAN 
Li Teh-chttan, Chairman of 
the Chinese Red Cross. 
Personal hygiene and the exposure 
of old superstitious practices are 
also favourite themes. The trains 
themselves are clean and regularly 
disinfected. 
If you went into a local primary 
school and visited the "Health 
Room" between 8 and 9 a.m. you 
would ordinarily find either a 
doctor making routine physical 
examinations of the pupils or a 
local public health nurse or 
school nurse (in larger schools) 
giving eye treatments for tra-
choma and conjunctivitis, dressing 
some small finger or treating some 
skin disease. Looking into a class-
room you would see that a great 
majority of the children now seem 
well-nourished and healthy. Sup-
plementary feeding with soy-bean 
milk at the schools is partly 
responsible for this, coupled with 
the general improvement of food 
conditions. 
Almost every factory having 
over a hundred workers possesses 
a busy medical clinic. First aid 
stations and kits are set up in 
the shops. Prominently placed 
posters advise how to prevent 
accidents. Many varieties of safety 
devices and machine-guards are in 
use?often suggested and built by 
the workers themselves with the 
aid of the factory management. 
Our Labour Insurance Act, already 
in operation, includes, among 
many other things, health pro-
tection and medical treatment, 
free of charge, for both the worker 
and his dependents. No deduction 
for this is made from the worker's 
wage. Insurance funds are han-
dled and controlled by his labour 
union. The average factory may 
not have a hospital of its own, but 
it has a part share in the local 
Workers Hospital set up jointly 
with a number of other factories 
in that district. 
Cleaning Up the Cities 
Urban sanitation has been im-
proved by enlisting large numbers 
of people in the work. If you 
happened to live in Peking and 
you were visited on the 15th or 
30th of the month by a delegation 
of four old men with venerable 
beards and long gowns whom in 
the past you might have associated 
with carrying a favourite bird 
in a cage, or spending the morning 
feeding their gold fish, you would 
be surprised to learn that they are 
now the local street health com-
mittee. And if you had been a 
little lax in cleaning out your gar-
bage, or if your share of the street 
or alley or yard was not swept 
regularly, you would receive a 
very firm and detailed lecture on

sanitation and a request for im-
provement before their next re-
gular visit. 
Incidentally, Peking at the 
time of liberation had 201,638 
tons of garbage and refuse piled 
up in the city, which took 
the efforts of 73,537 volunteers and 
sanitary workers, using 35,407 
carts and over 800 trucks, to clean 
up. At Tangshan, in Hopei pro-
vince, exposed garbage and refuse 
dating from twenty years back 
has been successfully removed. 
Well-functioning garbage disposal 
systems now operate in these two 
cities and scores of others which 
never had them before. 
In nearly all the major cities of 
China sewers are being cleaned 
out and repaired. Water pipes 
are being laid to bring fresh, clean 
piped water to workers homes and 
districts. 
In Peking, for example, the in-
famous "Dragon Beard Ditch" 
once wound its filthy way for 
several miles behind the famous 
Temple of Heaven, through 
a quarter where only working 
people lived. It was a public 
health menace of the first order. 
Dating back 300 years, it was 
stagnant, filled with garbage, rot-
ting matter, dead dogs, dead cats 
and worms. In summer it was a 
breeding place for flies and mos-
quitoes and was responsible, in 
large measure, for many of the 
epidemics that raged among the 
400,000 people that it "serviced." 
Under the old regime nothing was 
done about this. The People's 
Government, in five months from 
May to September 1950, eliminat-
ed the ditch and laid five miles 
of concrete conduits instead. 
Piped water was brought into 
the area for the first time. An 
old man living on the bank of 
the ditch said afterwards: "I 
have been here for 72 years but 
this is the first year I have lived 
in a clean place, with no flies, mos-
quitoes or worms to bother me." 
Other Urban Services 
The tremendous amount of 
public health work going on in our 
cities cannot even be outlined in a 
short article. There is now a vast 
network of creches and nurseries 
caring for more children, and 
Housewives turn out to clean a Peking street. Dirt and 
garbage have disappeared from public thoroughfares since 
householders were organized for regular clean-ups of this kind. 
caring for them better, than ever 
before. Countless mothers are 
active in the peace campaign as 
the most concrete expression of 
child protection; because both 
mothers and medical workers 
realize that no matter how healthy 
a child is, or anyone else for that 
matter, there can be no safety of 
life or limb unless war is pre-
vented. 
Other health changes in the 
cities include physical culture 
activities on an unprecedented 
mass scale; special measures for 
the protection of women in in-
dustry; the increase and expansion 
of hospitals, clinics and dispen-
saries; institution of isolation hos-
pitals and public health labora-
tories; establishment of chemical 
and medical equipment factories 
and a greater number of medical 
universities and colleges. These 
vast developments cannot even be 
treated in the present article. 
Fighting Rural Epidemics 
But 80 per cent of China's 
population is rural. What about 
the countryside? What public 
health and medical work is going 
on in the hsien (counties) and 
farm villages? 
Let us visit a hsien in what was 
previously a plague epidemic 
region in northeast China. In the 
county-seat there is the county 
public, health department with 
three major sections under it?
epidemic prevention and sanita-
tion, protection of mother and 
child health, and medical adminis-
tration. In this particular hsien, 
in addition to sanitation, public 
clinics and permanent work along 
preventive lines against smallpox 
and measles, the main task is the 
prevention of plague. Through-
out the county there are plague 
prevention stations where a con-
stant watch is kept for any signs 
of infection in humans, rats or 
fleas. Posters, lectures and plays 
for the population in this area 
center on plague. Around each 
village there is a newly-dug cir-
cular ditch with sharp, steep-cut 
sides. Patrolling the ditch are 
members of the Young Pioneers 
organization with red kerchiefs 
and long red-tasseled spears. They 
are on the lookout for rats in 
the ditch, which serves to pre-
vent rats from coming into the 
village or escaping from it. Often 
one may see the children spearing 
a rat. 
' Although in the past 3,000 cases 
, of plague might occur in a single 
' year, there were only a few 
sporadic cases and no epidemics 
from 1950 on. The mobilized 
people in the endemic regions 
caught and killed 20,916,389 rats in 
1950 alone, by an actual count of 
rat tails turned in to stations in

northeast China. In addition to 
rat eradication and house-to-house 
sanitation, 5,933,700 inoculations 
against plague were given in 1950. 
In Shantung province in East 
China, county health services are 
organized along the same lines, but 
here the main task is centered 
around the kala-azar eradication 
campaign. Shantung now has 
many kala-azar treatment stations 
and several mobile teams with 
doctors, laboratory equipment and 
trained injectors. In heavily in-
fested regions prevention teams 
work on control of the sand-fly. 
Treatment is free of charge and, 
according to incomplete statistics, 
more than 60,000 cases of kala-
azar were treated in 1950. Even 
so, the battle against this disease 
is only beginning. 
Further south, in Kiangsu and 
Chekiang provinces, district health 
departments fight against schisto-
somiasis, which has the snail as its 
intermediary host and reservoir of 
infection. Methods are being 
worked out to control and eradi-
cate these snails, which unfor-
tunately are not as susceptible to 
copper sulfate as is the Egyptian 
variety, which transmits schisto-
somiasis in that country. Control 
of faeces (a source of infection) is 
being carried on with cooperation 
from the mobilized peasantry. 
The peasantry, after having had 
explained to them the danger 
from raw human faeces being used 
as fertilizer and in this way trans-
mitting the disease, have organized 
a "three tank system" for treating 
them. Only faeces that have been 
stored for a month or more (and 
thus made harmless from the point 
of view of schistosomiasis trans-
mission) are used in the fields. 
The peasants and the whole 
population are now well aware of 
the danger from snails and there 
are constant snail-picking cam-
paigns during the winter slack 
season. In winter the snails climb 
up on the banks of the streams and 
rivers. They are picked up with 
bamboo forceps. A recent cham-
pion snail picker collected 400 in 
a single hour. Eradication of 
snails would wipe out the disease. 
Suggested new methods to do this 
in a quicker and less laborious 
manner are now under study. 
Along the Kiangsu-Chekiang 
provincial border in 1950, more 
than 30,000 cases were treated in-
volving more than a half-million 
intravenous injections and 444,459 
stool examinations. All medicines 
used in the treatment are now 
manufactured in China whereas 
previously there was complete de-
pendence on imported drugs, even 
for the few cases treated. The 
cost was prohibitive, and those 
most in need of treatment could 
least afford it. Now all treatment 
is free of charge. 
Health on National Construction 
Projects 
In some hsien, health protect-
tion of the peasants working on 
water conservancy is the main 
concern. This is true along the 
Huai river, the middle course of 
the Yangtze and Han rivers, the 
middle and lower reaches of the 
Yellow River, the Pearl River and 
waterways in North China. In the 
spring and early summer of 1951, 
nearly 5,000,000 peasants were at 
work on water conservancy and 
flood control projects. The health 
protection of these workers is of 
prime importance for the com-
pletion of the urgent tasks of 
raising production and preventing 
floods. The Ministry of Health 
and other Area and Provincial 
Health departments have organized 
Epidemic Prevention Corps to 
supplement the efforts of the hsien 
health departments in this respect. 
There are 88 such corps through-
out the country and a large num-
ber are assigned to this work. 
What has already been accom-
plished by these epidemic pre-
vention corps? The following are 
some sample answers. 
A detachment of the Third 
Epidemic Prevention Corps pro-
vided health protection for 340,000 
peasants of 10 hsien working on 
flood control. A total of 169,440

smallpox vaccinations were ad-
ministered. Complete delousing 
was carried out and 1,236 cases of 
relapsing fever were treated, with 
the result that the spread of this 
disease was stopped. Latrines and 
faeces-disposal were organized. 
Water purification by chemicals 
was carried out on all work sites. 
Regular talks on hygiene were 
given to the workers. 
When the flood control job was 
completed ahead of time, the team 
divided into two sections?one for 
kala-azar work, one for mother 
and child health training. The 
kala-azar section operating in nine 
hsien of the Huaiyin region treated 
9,669 cases, trained 464 injectors 
locally, mobilized local medical 
personnel and, together with the 
county medical department, set up 
a permanent apparatus to clean 
out kala-azar from the region. 
The mother and child health 
section organized a three-months 
course in midwifery and child care 
for women cadres from the h,sien 
women's organizations and other 
women workers, training 243 per-
sons. In addition 69 old-style 
midwives were re-trained. Since 
the area in which both sections 
were operating was also a typhoid 
endemic region, hygienic measures 
were instituted and special areas 
for using river water to wash 
vegetables and clothes organized. 
The teams gave typhoid-cholera 
inoculations to 58,807 people, 
cleaned and purified wells and 
built new sanitary privies. 
Nurseries were organized in the 
rural areas of central Hopei pro-
vince in the busy June-July agri-
cultural season. In Tali village, 
for example, a seasonal temporary 
nursery was set up on the basis of 
mutual exchange of labour. Four 
women, one of whom is a public 
health worker, are in charge of 
51 children, in exchange for which 
their farm work is done by the 
women whose children they are 
minding. The mothers also pre-
pare midday meals for the nursery-
workers' husbands. The nursery 
is housed in the Yuehwang Tem-
ple which also houses the primary

school. This method of seasonal 
nurseries was adopted from the 
Soviet Union dfrnd is proving a great 
success. 
Rural Medical Cooperatives 
Many rural areas now have self-
supporting medical cooperatives. 
This is an extremely important 
development. I would like to 
describe a typical and successful 
example which serves Hsuwu and 
Taiwang, in Pingyuan province in 
North China. 
When this area was liberated in 
1948, medical attention was con-
fined to the well-to-do and drugs 
were available only at two old-
style Chinese pharmacies, which 
sold them at prohibitively high 
prices. In February 1949, the local 
People's Government and its 
medical department called a meet-
ing, attended by fourteen doctors, 
to consider how to improve the 
situation. The proposal to form a 
medical cooperative was made 
and, after thorough discussion. 
adopted. Sixty shares were issued 
and distributed among a total of 
31 doctors, both Chinese-style and 
modern, who paid for them in 
services, millet, equipment or 
medicines. A modern-trained doc-
tor was named to head the medical 
staff of six and two clerks were 
hired. The co-op clinic began 
work in premises donated free of 
charge by the local government. 
Peasants began to flock to the 
cooperative at once. They were 
given medicines and treatment on 
credit (it is the local custom to 
pay all bills after the harvest.) 
As a result, both supplies and 
funds were quickly exhausted. A 
crisis meeting was urgently called, 
and decided to issue more shares 
to be sold to peasants as well as 
doctors. These shares were quick-
ly bought up by the eleven sur-
rounding villages. Treatment was 
still available to everyone, but 
member-patients received a 10 
per cent discount. There were no 
profits the first year but, as a result 
of the co-op's operations, the local 
price of medicines dropped 50 
per cent. 
The co-op has since expanded 
greatly. In addition to giving am-
bulatory treatment and dispensing 
medicines, it now buys up locally 
grown medicinal herbs and sells 
them to other regions. This pro-
vides additional earnings for many 
peasants as well as for the co-
operative itself. With the extra 
income, new services have been 
started: free treatment for families 
of People's Liberation Army sol-
diers, free smallpox vaccinations, 
health education and anti-epidemic 
campaigns undertaken jointly with 
the county health department.

The cooperative is now a going 
concern and the pride of the Tai-
wang and Hsuwu peasantry, who 
regard it as their own. 
Rural health cooperatives are 
spreading. Numbers of them al-
ready exist even in such formerly 
backward provinces as Jehol. 
Citizens' Voluntary Health 
Work 
In addition to the work of 
county health departments, epide-
mic prevention corps and medical 
cooperatives, great masses of peo-
ple participate in public health 
activity through the Chinese Red 
Cross, the local Joint Medical 
Associations, labour unions, wo-
men's, youth and peasant associa-
tions and educational circles. A 
few instances will be enough to 
show the nature and scope of such 
voluntary action, the change in 
the people themselves and the 
great reserves of popular energy 
available in our new China. 
In Linhsien, Pingyuan province, 
the county Joint Medical Associa-
tion is now headed by Ko Hsu-
hsien, an old-style Chinese doctor 
62 years of age. Dr. Ko is a 
fervent advocate of preventive 
medicine and has been able to 
pass on his enthusiasm to others. 
He has mobilized over eighty 
doctors in his area into six groups 
which supplement the work of the 
County Health Department in no 
less than 52 villages. These vol-
unteer medical men have in turn 
organized 1,074 village block health 
committees (each covering an area 
inhabited by ten families). The 
committees are active in public 
health propaganda, sanitary in-
spection, getting people to be vac-
cinated, reporting the occurrence 
of disease and registering births 
and deaths. Not a single one of 
these services existed in the 
countryside under the old regime, 
or indeed at any time in China's 
past history. Nor could they have 
begun now if we did not have a 
government based on the people. 
In Linhsien, too, Dr. Ko or-
ganized, on his own initiative, 
what is known as the "Three 
Clean Movement": 1. Clean homes, 
streets and yards; 2. Clean food, 
water and cooking utensils; 
3. Clean beds, bedding and clothes. 
The "Three Clean" movement has 
now become a regular feature of 
county health work. Dr. Ko has 
also brought local doctors together 
for common study and exchange 
of experience, mobilized primary 
school teachers to teach hygiene 
and led in forming three emer-
gency epidemic-prevention corps 
which have been successful in 
halting outbreaks of diphtheria, 
measles and diarrhoea. 
When the smallpox vaccination 
campaign in Linhsien county 
threatened to bog down owing to 
the conservatism of the peasants, 
Dr. Ko called a meeting in his own 
village. After explaining the 
reasons and benefits of vaccination, 
18 
he brought his own children and 
grandchildren on the platform and 
vaccinated them in full view of 
the people. After this the cam-
paign met with no further difficul-
ties. 
The result of leadership given 
by this energetic and public-
spirited practitioner, who had no 
modern medical training or ideas 
in the past, may be seen from 
Linhsien's health statistics. In the 
year before the Joint Medical As-
sociation was formed, the county 
reported over 6,700 cases of disease 
and 296 deaths. After the As-
sociation had been active for a 
year, and with a more thorough 
reporting system, there were 3,599 
cases of illness and only 144 deaths. 
The example set by Dr. Ko is 
being publicized and imitated 
throughout our country. 
Schoolteachers and Health 
Schoolteachers are among those 
most responsible for changing the 
entire public health picture in our 
country. 
In Chiahsiang county, Pingyuan 
province, the people elected Miss 
Mi Pao-yin "Model Health Worker 
for 1951." Miss Mi with no pre-
vious medical education has done 
more for the people's health than 
many a doctor. At the County 
Primary School Teachers' Con-
ference she led in mobilizing 
teachers to fight smallpox. When 
she returned to her own school, 
she not only taught the children 
why vaccination was necessary 
but organized them to agitate for 
it among their families. Later, 
with her pupils, she went from 
house to house, vaccinating the 
people. 
Difficulties did not deter Miss 
Mi. She used every possible 
avenue of popular education, in-
cluding a play she wrote and 
staged herself, with the children 
as actors. In a month's time she 
had personally vaccinated the 
entire school (226 pupils) and 3.202 
peasants. By the time she had 
completed work in her own coun-
try town, the school yard was 
filled each day with people from 
Anti-epidemic team exterminating 
fleas In Chapel, Shanghai.

Subsequently, when the County 
Health Department sent its own 
teams to carry out inoculations 
for typhoid, they found the ground 
already prepared. Again with 
Miss Mi's active help, they in-
oculated 5,222 people. In the 
course of one year, Miss Mi, who 
teaches music, composed 34 songs 
on health topics. The songs ex-
posed harmful local superstitions, 
described the symptoms and 
dangers of various common 
diseases in easily remembered 
terms, pointed out the evils of old-
style midwifery and so on. 
In all China in 1950, the number 
of persons vaccinated for smallpox 
reached the unprecedented figure 
of 57,325,417. Typhoid and cholera 
inoculations exceeded 13 million. 
These results would never have 
been achieved without the energy 
and devotion of thousands of 
leaders like Dr. Ko and Miss Mi. 
Saving the Newborn 
No one can count the hund-
reds of millions of babies and 
rAN.-FEB. 1952 
mothers who perished in old 
China due to the insanitary prac-
tices of the traditional-style mid-
wife. Now these women are re-
training themselves and becoming 
fighters for public health instead 
of a danger to it. 
Midwife Wang Chi-ying of Lin-
hsien, Pingyuan province, is a tall, 
thin woman of 43 who still has 
bound feet. She is the daughter, 
granddaughter and great-grand-
daughter of midwives and has 
practised her profession for two 
decades. Up to a couple of years 
ago she regularly Lost more than 
half her deliveries from "con-
vulsions" (tetanus). This pro-
portion was regarded as "inevi-
table." 
When the local People's Govern-
ment began a course to re-train 
old midwives, Wang Chi-ying 
joined with hesitation. But soon 
she became one of the best stu-
dents and asked regularly in the 
classes: "Why did no one tell us 
these things before." A kind and 
conscientious woman, she often ex-
claimed with deep feeling: "How 
many children have died from my 
ignorance!" 
Since she completed the course, 
Wang Chi-ying has delivered 43 
babies, including seven difficult 
cases, without losing a single one. 
She has taught the new way per-
sonally to three other old mid-
wives in her village and organized 
a Midwives' Association covering 
several villages. Many midwives, 
stimulated by her example, have 
gone to training schools. She is 
recognized as a local health leader, 
inspects the work of other mid-
wives and is called as a consultant 
in difficult deliveries. Wang Chi-
ying is now attending a night 
school for adults, to learn to read 
and write. 
In 1950, alone, more than 46,371 
old-style midwives throughout the 
country were re-educated with 
special emphasis on sterilization 
and asepsis, of which many of 
them had never heard before. As 
a result, sample figures from many 
counties already show a half to 
two-thirds decrease of infant 
deaths from tetanus. Every one

Departments already fully estab-
lished in China is charged with 
re-training these women, on whom 
the majority of Chinese mothers 
must necessarily depend until 
huge numbers of new personnel 
are graduated. 
Medical Education 
The effort being put into train-
ing new personnel may be gather-
ed from one figure. Graduates 
from medical schools in the year 
1950 exceeded by six times the 
highest number in any year 
under the reactionary Kuomintang 
regime. 
In 1951, the chief emphasis was 
on the training of middle-grade 
medical and public health work-
ers, a classification that did not 
exist in old China at all. Twenty 
institutions to train such person-
nel have already been set up. A 
number of special schools where 
old-style Chinese doctors can re-
ceive supplementary training have 
also been started in different parts 
of the country. Many research 
20 
centres now study the value of the 
traditional Chinese drugs. 
All health and medical per-
sonnel, old and new, have been 
imbued with the spirit of serving 
the people. The result of their 
selfless efforts may now be seen in 
China's rapidly improving public 
health. The emphasis on pre-
ventive medicine, born of the 
government's concern for the 
people is already producing 
results. The absence of epidemics 
formerly considered "normal" 
helps to increase both agricultural 
and industrial production, and 
improve standards of living. 
Medical workers are responsible 
citizens and are therefore promi-
ment in every nationwide effort 
and campaign.They are volun-
teering in thousands to take part 
in the movement to resist U.S. im-
perialist aggression and to aid 
Korea, at present a major feature 
of our national life. Surgical, 
medical and epidemic prevention 
teams from different areas of China 
are now working on the Korean 
front where medical teams of the 
Chinese Red Cross are also active 
among both troops and people. 
Achievements in 1951 
In the meantime. the pro-
gramme for 1951 has been carried 
out. Not all the figures are as yet 
available, but those announced 
for the first ten months of the year 
are most impressive 
Two hundred million people 
were vaccinated against smallpox 
as compared to 57 million in 1950. 
By November 1951, health de-
partments had been established in 
1,865 counties-85 per cent of all 
the counties in China. 
Several national conferences 
had been held on various aspects 
of public health and medicine to 
undertake further planning and 
organization. 
China's medical workers are 
confident that, with the aid of the 
mobilized people and the leader-
ship of the People's Government, 
our new China will be healthy as 
well as happy and free.

New Rise Of Industry 
China has a mixed and com-
posite economy. It includes no 
less than five types of enterprises. 
The most widespread form is 
still individual small-scale eco-
nomy, which includes family 
farms and all handicrafts. 
The second type is private cap-
italist enterprise which still forms 
more than 80 per cent of the trade 
capital in China. 
The third is state capitalist en-
terprise, representing at present a 
combination of state and private 
capital. 
Cooperative enterprise, which is 
of a semi-socialist character, is the 
fourth type. China now has more 
than 46,000 cooperatives of various 
categories, with a total of over 
30,000,000 members. 
Fifth, and most important of all, 
there are the new nationalized 
enterprises, socialist in nature, 
which now account for half of 
China's modern industrial produc-
tion. In heavy industry, the na-
tionalized sector is about 80 per 
cent of the whole. In light indus-
try it is over 30 per cent. 
The nationalized enterprises, 
operated by the state, represent 
the leading force in the new Chi-
nese economy. They are advanc-
ing rapidly, but not at the expense 
of productive activity by the other 
forms listed. On the contrary, 
the strengthening of state industry 
in the present period ensures bet-
ter tools, supplies and markets for 
the individual small producer. It 
stimulates private capital to en-
gage in production necessary to 
the country and people by provid-
ing it with secure conditions and 
profitable orders. It curbs specu-
lation, and, by purchasing raw 
materials and guaranteeing an 
even flow of necessary goods to the 
countryside, enlarges the scope of 
cooperative as well as private 
trade. 
Task of Coordination 
To manage and coordinate all 
these types of productive enter-
JAN.-FEB. 1952 
CHEN HAN-SENG 
prise is obviously the first step to-
ward industrialization. For this 
purpose the People's Government 
has set up four ministries in Pe-
king: Heavy Industry, Fuel In-
dustry, Textile Industry, and 
Light Industry (including the food 
industry). In the past two years 
numerous national conferences, 
attended by delegates from all 
over the country, had. been held to 
discuss administrative and, tech-
nical problems. 
There have been conferences for 
the iron, steel, electrical, mechan-
ical, chemical and non-ferrous 
metallurgical industries. There 
have also been coal mining, 
electric! power, petroleum, and 
hydraulic engineering conferences, 
as well as conferences dealing 
with the manufacture of paper, 
matches, medicine, rubber and 
leather. These conferences have 
tackled problems of raw material 
supply, production costs, trans-
port, and marketing, standardiza-
tion of products, factory budgets 
and administration. They have 
also been instrumental in adjusting 
the relations between private and 
state capital in the various cate-
gories. 
The guiding principle in this co-
ordinating activity has been to 
organize the advance of all indus-
try under the leadership of the 
state-operated enterprises. Private 
industry has been directed toward 
activity useful to the people and 
helped to avoid unplanned pro-
duction and competition resulting 
from overcrowding of individual 
fields. 
Problems Encountered 
There is no doubt that the in-
dustrial world in China faces 
many problems, some of which are 
unprecedented. 
First and foremost is the gen-
eral impoverishment of the coun-
try, intensified by the 22-year rule 
of Chiang Kai-shek (1927-1949) 
and of his imperialist supporters. 
During the eight years of war 
against Japanese aggression, be-
tween 1937 and 1945, China lost 
about 10 million people and sus-
tained property losses amounting 
to no less than 621/2 billion Ameri-
can dollars. Wild inflation during 
the three and half years of civil 
war (1946-1949) greatly accelerated 
the decline in trade and industry. 
Former Pattern of Industry 
As a result of imperialist domi-
nation of the country, modern in-
dustry in China was scarcely de-
veloped at all. Even in 1937, on 
the eve of the war with Japan, the 
total number of working lathes in 
the whole country was about 
90,000. 
Iron and steel production was 
about 700,000 tons. 
Total electric power output was 
less than 2,000,000 kilowatts. 
In the textile industry, spindles 
numbered not more than 5,000,000. 
In a word China was predomi-
nantly a nation of handicraft in-
dustry. Her modern industry was 
extremely modest. Her heavy in-
dustry was feeblest of all. 
As is typical for semi-colonial 
economics, whatever modern in-
dustry was developed in China 
was more or less dependent on 
foreign capital. 
There was a time when the im-
port of American motor vehicles 
into China totalled 10,000 a year. 
For the repair of these, no less 
than 100 fairly large machine 
shops were maintained, but their 
3,000 workers laboured mainly for 
the benefit of Henry Ford and 
other American manufacturers. 
In the chemical industry, the 
manufacture of cosmetics flourish-
ed. But manufacture of soda and 
sulphuric acid was very minor. 
Even in the light industry, 
manufacture catered almost ex-
clusively to the urban market and 
not for rural inhabitants who com-
prise 80 per cent of the Chinese 
people.

Successes in Reconstruction 
When the Central People's Gov-
ernment was inaugurated in 1949 
it faced a two-fold industrial prob-
lem: to restore industrial produc-
tion and at the same time to cor-
rect all the defects derived from 
China's past status, so as to launch 
a new path for industrialization. 
This was by no means an easy 
task. 
The iron and steel industry, for 
instance, was 90 per cent destroy-
ed between 1937 and 1949. Electric 
power capacity was 50 per cent 
destroyed during the same period. 
Moreover, the Japanese surrender 
practically denuded China's North-
east?where most of industry is 
located?of technicians. This was 
because it had been the policy of 
the Japanese, who occupied the 
area from 1931 to 1945, to confine 
such work to their own nationals. 
As a result, when the industrial 
plants in the Northeast were re-
stored by the Regional People's 
Government, many technicians 
and skilled workers had to be 
recruited from east and south 
China. 
Nevertheless the task was suc-
cessfully carried out. In the past 
two years the Northeast has achiev-
ed speedy industrial recovery, and 
factories in other administrative 
regions have also been resuscitat-
ed. 
The cement factories at Lan-
chow in the Northwest, and in 
Chungking in the Southwest; the 
iron mines in south Chahar and 
in the Northeast; the paper fac-
tories in Szechuan and Kwang-
tung; the manufacture of steel 
rails in an important steel works 
in the Southwest: these are all 
examples of successful restoration. 
As early as October 1950, 82.4 
per cent of all textile spindles and 
e4.2 per cent of all power looms 
in the country had been put to 
work. 
Basically the restoration of mod-
emn industrial production in 
China has been guaranteed by the 
advance of political democracy for 
the people. It has been achieved 
by the united efforts of workers, 
peasants, the middle class, and the 
patriotic industrialists, led by the 
People's Government. 
Modernization and industrializa-
tion have been the common aim, 
as modernization and industrial-
ization are the basis for improving 
people's livelihood. It has been a 
constant aim of our economic 
policy to guarantee that the pro-
gress of industry and the improve-
ment of the workers' livelihood go 
hand in hand. 
Better Life for Labour 
Statistics from the Northeast 
show that average wages in that 
region increased by 27 per cent in 
1949, by 12.5 per cent in 1950, and 
by an estimated 10 per cent in 
1951. There has been a more or 
less similar rise in other admini-
strative regions. 
The People's Government in 
1950 promulgated a safety and 
health law for factories and install-
ed a system of factory inspection. 
As a result, sickness and deaths in 
textile factories in Tientsin, for 
instance, decreased by 62 per cent 
in 1950. 
The Labour Insurance Law was 
published in 1951. Since last 
May, all factories employing 100 
or more workers have taken 
out labour insurance. In other 
words, some 2,300,000 industrial 
workers and staff people, or about 
10,000,000 people if the families 
are included, are protected by 
this law. In the nationalized 
textile mills, workers' insurance is 
equivalent to 12 to 15 per cent of 
the total wage. 
Many sanatoria and homes have 
been set up for disabled, old and 
retired workers. More than 1,700 
factories have organized workers' 
clubs. Workers' living quarters 
have already been greatly improv-
ed in many places. 
Workers have made great ad-
vances in their culture. An esti-
mated 1,300,000 have joined study 
classes of one kind or another. 
The Chinese worker is no longer 
a slave of the machine. He now 
feels a new zest for life. He 
knows that he is a master of the 
country. In the factory, he has 
practical experience of the fact 
that every step in increasing pro-
duction is a step forward in his 
earnings and general welfare. In-
stead of being docile and passive, 
he now exhibits initiative. 
The productive enthusiasm of 
labour, its support of the policy of 
rapid restoration and industrial-
ization, is the main moving force 
in the new rise of Chinese eco-
nomy. This enthusiasm and this 
support find organized form?
through the trade unions?in two 
great movements, the rationaliza-
tion movement and production 
emulation (work competitions). 
Workers Raise Productivity 
In textile and other factories, 
during 1950 alone, no less than 
Chinese textile industry is more pro-
ductive, and its workers are better 
paid, than at any time in the past 
(MINA RECONSTRUCTS 
15R012400130001-o 
Approved For Release 2004/02/19: CIA-RDP83-00415R012400130001 
24,000 proposals for administrative 
and technical improvements were 
made by the workers and adopted 
by management. Competition 
groups have been organized and 
involve over 2,220,000 workers in 
all. 
Thanks to the enthusiasm of 
labour, backed by improved plan-
ning and administration, factories 
in many different industries, 
especially in iron and steel, pro-
duce from four to eight new re-
cords during one month. In the 
large Ta Chang silk filature in 
Wusih, the .1951 production was 
the highest in fourteen years in 
both quantity and quality. In 
1950 all textile factories in the 
country taken together exceeded 
their highest production records 
of the past. Total yarn produc-
tion in 1950 was 0.28 per cent 
higher than in 1930, the previous 
all-time high. In cloth produc-
tion it was 7.8 per cent higher 
than 1936, the previous peak in 
this branch. 
Private Industry Aided 
This situation applies to? both 
state and private industry. Under 
the leadership and with the sup-
port of the former, the latter is 
enjoying prosperity. 
In 1950 the Ministry of Heavy 
Industry placed orders with many 
private factories. Two-thirds of 
the orders for steel manufacturers 
and one-third of those for electric 
appliances went to privately own-
ed plants. State textile mills also 
passed on semi-finished goods to 
private mills for further proces-
sing. 
Compared with 1949, yarn pro-
duction increased 39.39 per cent in 
1950; while power loom production 
increased 59.11 per cent in the 
same year. Printing and dyeing 
In private factories increased 33 
per cent. Privately - controlled 
gunny-sack production increased 
by 76.08 per cent in the same year. 
Private industry has been great-
ly benefitted by the new flood 
control projects. In 1951, more 
than 200 private workshops, in-
cluding some 70 steel and machine 
shops in Shanghai, filled orders 
for implements and material used 
on the great Huai river project. 
.N.-FEB. 1952 
Girls, who never did this kind of work before, repair 
machines damaged by the -Japanese and Ituomintang. 
These factories employ a total of 
30,000 workers. 
In both private and state fac-
tories, remarkable progress has 
taken place. Waste of materials 
has been greatly reduced in the 
gunny-sack mills in Tientsin. In 
Canton, certain steel processes 
which used to require forty days 
now take only twenty-eight. In 
another steel plant, in the South-
west, 94 per cent of the products 
are up to standard, as compared 
to only 70 per cent formerly. 
Base for New Progress 
The average daily coal produc-
tion per miner in the Northeast 
was 0.33 tons per day in 1946. It 
is now nearly double this figure. 
In 1949 the value of industrial 
products in the Northeast repre-
sented only 35 per cent of the 
total industrial and agricultural 
production. By 1950 it had risen 
to 43 per cent, and the 1951 target 
was to increase it to 47 per cent. 
Statistics for the entire country 
show that coal production increas-
ed nearly one and a half times be-
tween 1949 and 1950, production 
of machinery three times, cement 
nearly four times, steel more than 
seven times, and pig iron eleven 
and a half times. The textile plan 
for 1951 was to increase the num-
ber of spindles by 162,000; and to 
manufacture 2,000 machine looms. 
This is the outline of the new 
rise of industry in China. To the 
casual observer it may appear to 
be merely "restoration." But a 
true understanding of the nature 
of the present democratic trans-
formation of China, and of the 
actual industrial progress made 
so far, reveals, that during this 
process of restoration, many of 
the former defects have been cor-
rected. It shows that China is al-
ready well on the way towards a 
genuine process of industrializa-
tion that will pave the way for 
prosperous livelihood for her peo-
ple and contribute to world peace.

00415R012400130001-8 
The impact of liberation on Ma 
Heng-chang was also typical. He 
has written about this too, in a 
frank, open worker's way. "After 
liberation our new factory director 
told us, 'We rely on the workers.' 
To tell you the truth, we didn't 
believe him at first. All the fac-
tory directors we'd ever known 
had been rotten. Why should the 
Communists be different? Then 
I called on the director just to see 
how he lived. I found that his 
wife and children dressed and ate 
.just like us. What was more, he 
accepted any reasonable sugges-
tions we made." Thus Ma Heng-
chang's cautious skepticism gra-
dually faded away. 
As a result, Ma began to stir up 
everyone in his shop to work 
better. During lunch periods, he 
and his mates would sit around 
over a blueprint of the job on 
hand and think how to use their 
lathes to greater effect. Soon Ma 
Hung-ju, a milling machine opera-
tor, came up with a way of com-
pleting in 15 minutes a part that 
had formerly taken two hours to 
machine. The whole group de-
vised a new method of dividing 
up another job so as to finish it in 
half their previous time. 
All agreed to make full prepara-
tions before starting their ma-
chines, to care for them better than 
they had in the past, to wipe and 
oil them and put away all tools 
and parts before leaving. They 
also undertook to explain all un-
finished work fully to the next 
shift. Without "speed-up" or 
additional physical strain, simply 
as a result of more rational or-
ganization, the team's output went 
up and up. So did the wages of 
its members. 
Ma and his friends concerned 
themselves not only with quantity 
but also with quality. Each week 
they held a careful review of the 
reasons why any job had been re-
jected by the inspectors. When 
the cause was discovered, they set 
out to remedy it and to warn 
other workers against similar 
mistakes. 
Ma lieng-ctuult and his team discuss production plan. The banners 
behind them were won in nationwide work competitions. 
How Workers Move 
Industry Forward 
One of the prime factors in the 
speedy restoration of Chinese 
economy from the effects of long 
years of war is the initiative and 
inventiveness of the workers. An 
illustration of this is the signifi-
cant rise in national industrial 
output started by the 47-year-old 
lathe operator Ma Heng-chang and 
nine of his shop mates at the 
government-owned Fifth Machine 
Building Plant in Mukden, North-
east China. 
What did Ma Heng-chang and 
his friends do? Inspired by the 
new situation in which Chinese 
workers work for themselves and 
the only limit on their prosperity 
is the undeveloped state of 
national industry, they discussed 
for ten months how to improve 
their work. They kept trying out 
every likely answer on the job 
until they finally came up with 
the real one. 
How did this small event be-
come a great one and affect the 
24 
whole of China's heavy industry? 
The answer is simple. Since the 
People's Government, the people's 
press and the whole body of 
Chinese labour are eager to in-
crease and improve production, 
the experience of Ma Heng-chang's 
little group was publicized in de-
tail throughout China. Today 
more than 6,000 production teams 
are applying and developing the 
example they set. 
Ma Heng-chang had been a 
worker for 27 years. His past had 
been like that of millions of other 
Chinese workers. "Under the 
warlords, the Japanese and the 
Kuomintang, I did not have 
enough to eat or wear," he wrote 
recently in a Peking trade union 
newspaper. "If there was any-
thing wrong with our work we 
were either beaten up or sacked. 
Once when a Japanese superviser 
told me to pick up a ruler and I 
didn't catch what he meant, he 
came up and smashed my face." 
In addition older workers began 
patiently to explain to each 
apprentice the nature of the 
machine to which he was assigned, 
sometimes staying after working

hours to do it. In this way, 
apprentices could begin to work 
independently after three months 
instead of after several years as 
formerly. In contrast to the past, 
the apprentices were encouraged 
to ask any questions that came to 
their minds. The age-old system 
under which worker-teachers pur-
posely slowed down the training of 
apprentices in order to put off the 
day when they would become 
masters was abandoned. So was 
the feudal abuse of making the 
apprentices sweat while the older 
men smoked, chatted or walked 
around. These things could only 
take place, of course, in an 
atmosphere in which no one 
feared for his job or his old age. 
After ten months, eight of the 
workers in Ma Heng-chang's team 
had achieved a record of no re-
jected work whatsoever. Seven 
of them broke production records. 
The team as a whole improved 18 
tools on which its members were 
working. In a work competition 
that took place during this period, 
it accomplished two months' work 
in 28 days. 
Advancing constantly in skill 
and cooperation, Ma Heng-chang's 
team began to issue emulation 
challenges to others, first in its 
own plant, then throughout the 
country. Last May Day it an-
nounced that it had saved 22 days 
and seven hours on a four-month 
job during which 33 individual re-
cords were broken and the quality 
rating of the whole team's output 
was 99.81 per cent. 
In July 1951, the Ma Heng-chang 
team achieved the high targets it 
had set itself one day ahead of 
schedule. Its products were 99.3 
per cent up to standard. Four 
new records were established, 
raising productivity from two to 
61/2 times. 
In August the brigade was 
challenged to increase its produc-
tion by a value equivalent to 44 
tons of grain by the end of the 
year. On October 25 it announced 
that it had already over-fulfilled 
this target by 47 per cent, having

Ma Heng-chang's team is the atten-
tion it pays to training apprentices. 
AN.-FEB. 1952 
Approved For R 
produced an extra value equal to 
65 tons of grain. 
These advances in productivity 
were a result of the team's study 
and mastery of high-speed metal-
cutting techniques developed in 
the USSR and of the Kovalev 
method, in which workers showing 
high efficiency in various phases 
of an operation are studied and a 
procedure combining the best 
achievements of each becomes the 
general standard. During the 
month, the team did a day's 
extra voluntary work for the 
campaign to aid Chinese vol-
unteers in Korea, donating its 
earnings for the purchase of arms. 
Ma Heng-chang and his work-
team could not have existed in the 
old China but only in the new. 
To give birth to such people and 
such work, certain conditions are 
necessary. There must be no con-
flict but a community of interest 
between the authorities and the 
workers. The workers must know 
for a fact that they benefit per-
sonally from every productive ad-
vance. The government must so 
respect ordinary working people 
and their experience that it looks 
to them, not only to books and 
learned engineers, for solutions to 
economic problems. 
Fear of unemployment and de-
pression must be so effectively 
wiped out that neither individual 
workers nor individual factories 
hang on to "trade secrets," but on 
the contrary share them willing-
ly, without fear of loss to them-
selves. 
These conditions now exist in 
China. That is why Ma Heng-
chang's story is there to tell.

Flowers from peasant children to air force pilots taking 
part in the war against locusts in Hopei province. 
As the planes spray insecticide, peasants beat 
locusts into the middle of a ring and kill them. 
AIR FORCE 
Locusts have long been one of 
the great plagues of the Chinese 
countryside. Many was the year 
when a fine crop ripened, heavy-
eared after ample rainfall and 
sunlight?only to be eaten by 
these insects. The locusts swept 
down on the fields in dark clouds, 
leaving whole regions stripped of 
grain and foliage, dooming hun-
dreds of thousands of people to 
hunger. They chewed the win-
dow-paper out of the houses and 
even bit the faces and noses of 
farmers' children. The peasants 
fought them, by hand and with 
flails, but often failed to control 
them. 
Last July, locusts were again 
spotted in nine provinces in China: 
along the coast, among the reeds 
round the lakes in the central part 
of the country and in the grass 
plains of the Northwest. The 
threat in Hopei, Shantung and 
northern Anhwei provinces was 
the worst in a generation. But in 
contrast to other years, the swarms 
did not get the crop. Something 
new and unprecedented happened. 
The people triumphed over the 
locusts. 
The victory, which ushers in a 
new period in Chinese farm his-
tory, was won with the help of 
the air force. Hearing of the dan-
ger to crops in three provinces, 
the government equipped planes 
with sprayers and sent them to the 
areas of greatest concentration of 
the locusts?Hwanghua and Ssu-
hung counties. The planes made 
214 flights in two weeks and suc-
ceeded in destroying the swarms. 
What the planes did not finish off 
the peasants on the ground did, 
with hand-sprayers and insecti-
cides that kept pouring in from 
Peking and Tientsin by trucks 
which traveled day and night.

LOCUSTS 
Some time later, when another 
locust swarm threatened some 
10,000 acres of ripe crops in Tien-
men and Hanchwan counties, 
Hupeh province, the air force set 
out again. The aid of planes was 
especially necessary in this area 
because the locusts were breeding 
in soggy marshland, difficult to 
reach by other means. 
The appearance of the air force 
created great excitement among 
the peasants. They could not 
stop talking about how a few 
planes had killed more locusts 
than 10,000 men could destroy in 
three days. They made up many 
sayings about how the People's 
Air Force fights all aggressors 
against the Chinese people, be they 
humans or insects. Toilworn 
farmers jumped with joy when 
they saw the planes shuttling 
over the affected areas. When 
the planes landed, they ran to the 
pilots and presented them with 
delicacies: eggs, salt fish and 
almonds. 
At a welcoming celebration in 
Hwanghua county, peasant Ni 
Peng-shan made a speech in 
which he said: "We used to have 
four enemies. The People's Gov-
ernment has already wiped out 
three: bandits, tyrannical land-
lords and floods. Now Chairman 
Mao has sent planes to wipe out 
our last enemy?the locusts." 
To the farmers of the affected 
districts, "Chairman Mao's Anti-
Locust Air Force" is added evi-
dence that the government has no 
interests apart from those of the 
people. 
The government issues sprayers and 
"666" to peasants for use where 
grass and reeds are too thick for 
aerial spraying to be effective.

Urban Relief and Rehabilitation 
One great change is obvious to 
every eye in the cities of China 
today, two years after liberation. 
The victims of the old society 
are no longer to be seen. The 
homeless children and old people, 
the destitute families starving un-
der the open sky that used to meet 
one at every step?all these heart-
breaking scenes have disappeared. 
Our city streets have also been 
entirely freed from the scum of 
the old society?the loafers, pick-
pockets and professional beggars 
that infested them for centuries. 
No longer do predatory rascals 
and gangsters of all kinds sidle 
up to likely -prospects," or pick 
quarrels with passers-by to gain 
some profit by swindling or 
intimidation. These things too 
have sunk into the past. 
Such is the unmistakable evi-
dence that we now have a govern-
ment of the people and that a new 
society is already in the making 
in China. Behind it is the even 
more striking fact that the form-
erly starving urban poor have 
CHAO PU-CHU 
been provided with food, shelter, 
work and in many cases land; and 
that former city riff-raff are being 
reformed through useful labour. 
China Helps Herself 
These developments provide 
positive proof that the Chinese 
people, under their own People's 
Government, can both take care of 
the victims of the old order and 
remove the cancers that it bred. 
They have kicked the last props 
from under the moth-eaten slan-
der that China has not the re-
sources, the will or the skill to 
move ahead without imperialist 
"advice" or "philanthropy." 
Not even the enemies of China 
can now deny that two years of 
liberation have produced results 
which could not even be dreamed 
of after the previous hundred or 
so years of vaunted "model" 
municipal administration under 
imperialist rule in such cities as 
Shanghai. No one can overlook 
the fact that in this brief period 
we have done more in relief work 
than was achieved by the outside 
relief activities of a hundred 
years. There can be no better de-
monstration that full freedom 
from exploitation and control by 
foreign profit-seekers, not invest-
ments that aim to dominate and 
the Point Four type of poisoned 
"gifts," are what every nation in 
Asia needs in order to make 
similar progress in as short a time. 
Why Relief After Liberation? 
Generally speaking, the com-
plete change in the aspect of our 
cities is one fruit of the emer-
gence of China from a semi-colo-
nial and semi-feudal condition. 
It could not otherwise have occur-
' ed at all. 
Specifically, however, this 
change was due to the effective-
ness of the new type of urban re-
lief and rehabilitation work. Even 
after our liberation, this relief 
activity was called upon to over-
come difficulties of an extremely 
grave and unprecedentedly wide-
spread character. 
Why did we then, and why do 
we still need relief work, since our 
revolution has already destroyed 
the root cause of the worst social 
evils of the past? The answer to 
this question lies in the conditions 
which we inherited. 
As a general legacy from long 
years of misrule and merciless ex-
ploitation under previous govern-
ments, of which the Kuomintang 
regime was the last and worst, 
widespread poverty and depres-
sion permeated our whole society. 
In addition, the relentless civil 
war, waged by the reactionaries

012400130001-8 
CHINA ItECONSTRUM 
Approved For 
against the People's Liberation 
Army, afflicted the people with 
calamities even worse than those 
of the Japanese invasion which 
had preceded it. Not only did the 
people lose their sons through 
conscription and their livelihood 
through taxes and requisitions. 
They were often unable, as a re-
sult of the war, to continue nor-
mal agricultural activity and such 
work as the repair of dykes. The 
crop-failures and floods that re-
sulted cost the lives of millions 
and turned other millions into 
homeless refugees. Besides the 
refugees, the cities swarmed with 
hundreds of thousands of dis-
banded Kuomintang army men, 
many of them completely demor-
alized. 
Following liberation, finally, 
our coastal cities were subjected 
to naval blockade and wanton air-
raids by the brigand Chiang Kai-
shek and his U.S. backers. This 
resulted in .more loss of life, de-
struction of houses and temporary 
dislocation of trade and industry. 
As a consequence, our cities 
were full of unemployed, whose 
number was 'constantly augment-
ed by refugees from the country-
side. Every morning produced 
thousands of castaway infants, 
whom their parents had aban-
doned in desperation. Old people 
and cripples wandered, hungry 
and without ,aim, waiting only for 
death. Prostitution assumed mons-
trous proportions. Tuberculosis, 
venereal infections and various 
epidemic diseases reached un-
heard-of heights. 
In Shanghai alone, over 800,000 
persons were without any means 
of support and were classified as 
completely, destitute. 
The Evil Heritage 
Cities like Shanghai had been 
strongholds of imperialist, feudal 
and bureaucratic-capitalist rule. 
They had developed as centres of 
commerce and ruling-class con-
sumption rather than of healthy 
national industry. Their existing 
industries were largely geared to 
export markets most of which had 
become unavailable, and to the 
cheap-labour processing of im-
ported raw materials which 
had stopped coming in. Even at 
their most- "prosperous," they had 
'AN.-FEB. 1952 
An unemployed worker is deeply touched as he gets a 
sack of grain collected by workers in the factories. 
been factors in the exploitation of 
the country instead of its healthy 
development. The problem in 
such cities, therefore, was not 
merely to get the wheels of in-
dustry turning but to reorient 
their whole economy. 
Deep-rooted conditions of this 
kind clearly call for relief. Just 
as clearly, they cannot be solved 
by relief alone. They can only be 
successfully tackled by relief, re-
habilitation and basic economic 
reconstruction bound into one in-
dissoluble whole under a common 
plan. 
The First Steps 
Self-help and mutual aid in the 
cities themselves, and mutual aid 
between the afflicted cities and all 
other parts of the country, were 
the key to the relief effort after 
liberation. 
In the first period, rural areas 
were called upon to help the city. 
On a rough estimate, more than 
1,000,000 unemployed and im-
mediately unemployable persons 
in eight main cities?Shanghai, 
Peking, Tientsin, Nanking, Wu-
chang-Hankow, Canton, Sian and 
Tsingtao?were dispersed among 
the villages and accommodated in 
agricultural production.. From 
Nanking alone, 280,000 out of a 
total of 400,000 unemployed were 
decentralized in this way. They 
in turn helped the villages to in-
crease productivity with their 
energies and skills. 
Persons re-settled from the 
cities were received with warm 
kindness and assistance by the 
village people. On the other 
hand, people remaining in the 
cities raised large sums of money 
to help rural refugees from 
famine-stricken areas, who were 
gradually re-equipped and re-
patriated. Winter clothing cam-
paigns to help flood and drought 
victims in Anhwei, Kiangsu, Hopei 
and Honan provinces, regions 
devastated by flood, brought in 
6,800,000 warm garments from the 
cities. 
Kuomintang army men strand-
ed in the cities were also success-
fully resettled. In the Central 
South Region alone, 699,418 were 
shifted to the country in the short 
space of six months, at a cost of 
more than 9 billion yuan. 
The cities were made safe and 
social order restored through the 
removal of thieves, professional 
pan-handlers and loafers, who 
were put to work on various pro-
jects. A "New Man Village" for 
10,000 such persons from Shang-
hai was set up in the nearby 
Kwanyuan reclamation area, in 
north Kiangsu province, where 
these former parasites are now 
both helping the country and lay-
ing the material basis fora secure, 
productive, and prosperous life for 
themselves,

Prostitution is ceasing to exist 
in our cities. Leading the nation, 
Peking has been entirely cleansed 
of this social evil. The "special 
quarters" infamous for hundreds 
of years can no longer be found. 
Many of the women, freed from 
the grip of procurers and trained 
in various skills, have secured 
good jobs, married and begun an 
altogether new life. A few of 
them have begun to work in 
various cultural fields. 
A common saying in China 
nowadays is that the old society 
turned human beings into devils, 
while the new society turns devils 
into human beings! 
Fighting Unemployment 
In another phase of urban re-
habilitation, assistance has been 
given to 789,937 unemployed 
workers and intellectuals out of a 
total of 1,500,000 throughout the 
country. The assistance has taken 
many forms: assignment to jobs, 
outright financial relief, provision 
of temporary work and subsidizing 
living expenses while the bene-
ficiaries learn new skills. 
Municipal construction projects, 
already undertaken on a consider-
able scale, are absorbing large 
numbers of the unemployed. If 
we assume that each person re-
ceiving such aid has three depend-
ents, we arrive at the figure of 
2,000,000 persons supported by

Doruttions to the great winter 
clothing relief drive for dood re-
fugees are packed for tran.sport. 
these measures of relief and re-
habilitation. 
It must be remarked here that 
unemployment in our country is a 
product of the past and will soon 
be a thing of the past. This is 
already the case in Northeast 
China. Cities like Dairen and Har-
bin, which were liberated before 
the rest of the country, have been 
thoroughly rehabilitated and are 
rapidly acquiring new industries. 
In these places, there is no unem-
ployment whatsoever. On the 
contrary, there is a sharp shortage 
of both industrial and intellectual 
workers, despite the fact that 
many persons from other parts of 
the country have already taken 
jobs there. 
Improving Health and Welfare 
While the problem of food has 
been solved and that of work is 
on its way to solution in all our 
cities, positive measures are 
already being taken on a wide 
scale to improve health, welfare 
and education. 
Health centres and creches are 
appearing in all working-class 
areas, to give free medical assist-
ance and care for the children of 
women workers and office em-
ployees. Hospital and maternity 
care is now available, free or for a 
nominal charge, to a much greater 
section of the city people than 
could ever hope for it in the past. 
In Shanghai and Tsingtao, 
"youth villages" and special 
primary schools have been set up 
for children who a short time ago 
were homeless. As financial and 
economic conditions improve, 
other cities are acquiring similar 
institutions. 
In Harbin there are public 
wedding halls and funeral parlours 
which can be used entirely free of 
charge. 
China is no longer a country 
that depends on relief from the 
outside. On the contrary, we 
have already begun to help others. 
Vice-Premier Tung Pi-wu of 
the Central People's Government 
set this as a definite policy, in it 
speech at the All-China People's 
Relief Conference in Peking. 
He said that relief and welfare 
work in our cities is no longer to 
be limited to "saving ourselves" 
but must henceforth also include 
"helping others." 
This injunction is being carried 
out. Funds and supplies have 
been collected in large amounts 
for the relief of war sufferers in 
Korea and of Chinese refugees 
who have returned home from 
that country. In response to the 
call of the Chinese Red Cross 
Society, great numbers of doctors 
and nurses in many cities have 
formed volunteer medical teams 
and gone to the Korean front. 
Chinese relief organizations in 
all big cities are aiding overseas 
? Chinese refugees who have been 
compelled to leave their establish-
ments, residences and other pro-
perty in Malaya, Siam and the 
Philippines as a result of political 
and national persecution. Return-
ing to China they have been 
warmly received by the people 
wherever they have settled, and 
have received financial assistance, 
shelter and care. 
Eliminating Imperialist Influence 
Obviously, none of the new 
tasks of relief work in China could 
be carried out by organizations 
based on the old ruling-class con-
cept of "charity", or by those 
operated or influenced by imperi-
alism. 
A necessary preliminary, there-
fore, was the ridding of welfare 
organizations in our cities of all 
traces of imperialist control and 
attitudes, particularly those of the 
ruling groups of the United States 
who have so amply proved their 
enmity to the Chinese revolution 
both before and since its victory. 
The fruits of imperialism in the 
relief field have been fully ex-
posed. 
In the worst cases, it produced 
mass extermination of Chinese 
children. This was proved by the 
death pits found in a number of 
"orphanages" and by their own 
statistics, revealing a death-rate 
of 99%. Such institutions, need-
less to say, have been reformed, 
while the criminals responsible for 
CHINA RECONSTRUCTS

Approved For 
their abuses have been punished 
or deported from China. 
In even the "best" cases, how-
ever, the minds of beneficiaries of 
imperialist relief were bent into 
subservience to the very forces 
whose exploitation of China was 
responsible for their widespread 
poverty. In practically all cases 
relief was misused for improper 
interference in Chinese political 
life. In many, it served as a 
cover for foreign intelligence 
activities, frequently including re-
cruiting of agents and military 
espionage. All such patterns of 
"relief" are being effectively up-
rooted at the present time. 
Great changes have also come 
about in relief and welfare institu-
tions run by Chinese nationals but 
largely or wholly dependent on 
subsidies from the United States. 
These were formerly under the 
indirect influence of imperialism. 
Now they have been re-oriented 
to a new base of support in the 
Chinese government and society. 
Freed of dependence and divided 
loyalties, they now have a single 
aim?service to the people. 
Such basic policy changes have 
been immediately reflected in the 
rapid development of self-respect 
among the beneficiaries of relief. 
They see themselves in a new 
light. They learn that, acting col-
lectively, they have the strength 
to overcome their difficulties. 
Daily they see indications that 
their future is secure, that the 
new China which is being con-
structed will assure their welfare 
and will not long tolerate the con-
ditions that make relief necessary. 
Former paupers now recognize 
their own responsibility toward 
their people and their country. A 
concrete example can be found in 
the orphanages and other child 
welfare institutions of Shanghai. 
After these organizations were 
taken over and completely re-
novated, a new life began for the 
children. This filled them with 
the desire to do something in re-
turn for the fortunate turn of 
events in their lives. This past 
summer, 502 of the teen-agers 
volunteered for special medical 
training schools and pledged their 
future to serving the people. This 
is but one example. It has been 
duplicated many times over. 
IN.-FEB. 1952 
These youngsters lived in the streets and had no hope till 
they went to "New Man Village." 
Relief work in China today is 
integrated with our entire pro-
gramme of peaceful national re-
construction. Such coordination 
is guaranteed by basic relief 
policies laid down by the Central 
People's Government and the 
main goals it lays down from time 
to time. In deciding the actual 
programme to be carried out in 
any given place, local conditions 
and requirements are carefully 
studied. There is no undifferen-
tiated, blanket approach. 
Principles and Procedures 
Relief is not conducted in-
dependently in each locality. It 
is recognized that urban and rural 
relief are inseparable. Refugees 
cannot be resettled from cities to 
the land without the aid of the 
villages. The villages cannot 
lessen the burden on the cities 
unless they themselves receive aid 
which the cities can give, in tools 
and supplies. 
Close and friendly contact is 
maintained with government 
organs. No large-scale medical 
work can be done, for example, 
without cooperation with Public 
Health Bureaux. Big groups of 
people cannot be moved without 
help from transportation authori-
ties. Loafers and underworld char-
acters cannot be turned to produc-
tion without assistance from the 
Public Security Bureaux. Re-
settlement cannot have satisfac-
tory results if responsibilities are 
not assumed by the trade. indus-
trial and publicity departments of 
local and regional administrations. 
Relief and welfare activities can 
only be on a puny scale if they do 
not involve the masses; they can 
accomplish important tasks only 
when they themselves are a form 
of mass action. In the new China, 
labour unions, peasant, youth and 
women's associations, the coopera-
tives with their millions of mem-
bers, as well as other public or-
ganizations, have been drawn into 
the work. Their great pooled 
strength provides a sure base for 
a wide and many-sided attack on 
every social evil. It was in this 
way that the drive for relief funds 
for unemployed workers and 
winter clothes for the village poor 
was successfully carried out all 
over the country. 
The solid accomplishments of 
the past two years prove that the 
Chinese people can perfectly well 
put their own house in order, 
overcoming all difficulties. Mainly 
benefitting the working popula-
tion, our relief work not only 
heals the deep social wounds of 
past oppression, but contributes to 
the advances in production and 
culture which are building a new, 
prosperous China. 
In brief, the objectives marked 
by Vice-Premier Tung are being 
put into practice. Within a very 
short space of time, the Chinese 
people have not only "saved 
themselves" but begun to "help 
others" as well.

WOMEN DRIVE TRAMS 
IN PEKING 
An elderly passenger sitting 
rext to me on the tram remarked 
as he glanced admiringly at the

We already have labour and corn-

Poverty and starvai ion in her 
-?mily drove Li Yun-hua as a 
child to work in a clothing factory. 
Her wages for a 12-hour day of 
i;weated labour were 54 lbs. of rice 
per month, hardly enough to keep 
:dive. Because she was a woman, 
the labour bosses treated her even 
worse than they did the men. 
"Whenever I thought of the future. 
felt a pain in my heart," says Li 
Y m-hua. 
Then Peking was liberated. Li 
Yun-hua was still only eighteen. 
hie learned from the films that in 
the Soviet Union women were 
doing men's jobs, that a girl in 
Northeast China named Tien 
K wei-ying was driving a train and 
hat several girls had already be-
come skilled tram drivers in 
Dairen. "If they can do it. so can

When Li Yun-hua answered the

('-nark, "I hope to become a

Peking, too, have women tram 
divers as well as Dairen?"

Accepted, Li Yun-hua -began ten 
months' work as a conductor. 
These ten months were happier 
than any previous period of her 
life. She worked an eight-hour 
day and her wages were five times 
what she earned before liberation. 
Her family began to eat three 
meals a day of good, nourishing

:ti?o-time school. 
Soon she was elected a brigade 
leader, then a model worker of the 
whole tramway system and finally 
one of the 21 delegates to the 
People's Representative Con-
ference of the city of Peking. 
"I never thought it possible for a 
woman worker to discuss and 
supervise the government's work," 
she said. 
Li Yun-hua's dream began to 
come true in May when she was 
chosen as one of six women to be 
trained as drivers. The evening 
she was told the news, she was 
writing an essay for her night 
school class. She chose as her 
subject: "The same woman--
trash of the old days, but talent of 
the new society." 
The training was intensive. An 
experienced, skilled worker was 
assigned to each student. The 
girls had to learn electrical theory 
and how to do minor repairs. 
When Li Yun-hua went to the 
driver's platform for her first test 
run, the people on the streets 
shouted, "Hey look! A woman 
driver!" 
Peking was surprised and 
pleased when women began to 
pilot its trams. Photographs of 
Li Yun-hua and the other girls 
were frontpaged in the news-
papers. Many women wrote con-
gratulating them on their success. 
Their parents were proud of them. 
"Parents in the old days were 
often disappointed when they had 
girl babies," Li Yun-hua recalled. 
"We and many other women in 
China are now destroying this 
prejudice by showing there is 
nothing that we can't do." 
Li Yun-hua's test period ended 
in August. Then she was given 
one of the new light blue "People's 
Specials" to drive all by herself. 
The conductors on her tram are 
women too. Together, they are 
working out plans for maximum 
punctuality and good service to 
the passengers. Soon they hope 
to win the red banner for the best 
tram crew in Peking.

girls began their important job of 
bringing the truth, through music, 
dance and drama, to the youth of 
Shanghai. During the pre-libera-
tion period, they produced in-
numerable short pieces, all closely 
linked with the main worries and 
demands of the people. When 
malignant inflation threatened 
most citizens with starvation, they 
staged a, dance called "Who Causes 
High Prices?" When the Kuo-
mintang began to force masses of 
young people into its tottering 
armies, the theatre put on its "Re-

Two major dramas were also 
produced at this time. One, "The 
Watch," was adapted from a So-
viet children's play contrasting. 
old and new ways of education. 
The other, "The Little Circus," was 
written by the director of the 
Children's Theatre. It portrayed 
the exploitation of children and 
showed how, through unity, the 
children themselves could strug-
gle against oppression. 
CHILDREN'S 
OWN THEATRE 
JEN TEH-YAO 
Applause and cheers filled the 
Lyceum Theatre in Shanghai. 
The curtain had rung down on the 
last act of the play "Little Snow-
flake," presented by the Children's 
Theatre of the China Welfare In-
stitute. Long after the lights 
went up, the clapping continued, 
accompanied by the excited chat-
ter of the aroused audience. Many 
of the children crowded toward 
the dressing rooms, shouting 
threats to the villain and wanting 
to shake hands with the hero. 
Backstage a grey-haired stagehand 
stood looking and listening, shak-
ing his head from side to side. He 
nudged the younger stagehand be-
side him and said: "Since the 
opening of this theatre twenty 
years ago, I have never seen an 
audience respond like this." 
"Little Snowflake" was but one 
of the many similar successes of 
the Children's Theatre since it 
started in the spring of 1947. To-
day, as a result of liberation, the 
young audiences of Shanghai have 
more than ever come to claim this 
troupe of youngsters as their own. 
Early Steps 
This project was organized by 
the Institute to create a theatre 
run for and by China's children. 
Prior to the liberation, it was com-
pelled to function under the op-
pressive rule of the Kuomintang. 
Its history at that time consisted 
of overcoming one obstacle after 
another. The Kuomintang not 
only stifled the existing cultural 
activities for children, but also at-
tempted to prevent new ones from 
developing. The streets of Shang-
hai were filled with tens of thou-
sands of young folk. There were 
not enough schools, and many 
were too poor to attend those that

existed. Thousands had no homes 
at all. The original members of the 
Children's Theatre were recruited 
from among the children of the 
streets, the homeless and the 
poverty-stricken. Its faculty set 
itself to moulding these young-
sters who had known oppression 
from their earliest clays, who were 
born of the masses and had the 
inner strength to hate and resist 
the causes of China's misery. 
During those early days the 
Children's Theatre also had to 
overcome another obstacle. Many 
mothers and fathers, steeped in 
feudal ideas, regarded theatre 
work as no better than prostitu-
tion. The Kuomintang had en-
couraged this outlook. It had gone 
so far as to attempt to make all 
Shanghai actors and actresses re-
gister in the same category as 
prostitutes. Of course, the theatre 
workers bitterly resisted this, but 
many parents were influenced and 
withdrew their youngsters. They 
did this even when the theatre 
provided the only possible oppor-
tunity for their sons and daughters 
to get an education. 
Nonetheless, the Children's 
Theatre was able to maintain a 
nucleus of members. After pre-

In spite of persecution and un-
der the very eyes of the Kuomin-
tang's "cultural policemen," the 
children were able to take their 
talents, plays and dances into 
every corner of Shanghai. Acting 
as "little teachers," they per-
formed the dances and songs of 
new China long before the libera-
tion.

on. Many schools and thousands 
of young people continued to be 
served in such woes. 
In the last days of reactionary 
rule, marked by frantic Kuomin-
tang arrests and executions, the 
Children's Theatre split into 
,iroups which Nxert. dispersed to 
various parts of Shanghai. These 
I-el/alined in hiding, rehearsing 
itatir plays until the People's 
Liberation Army arrived. Then 
the Children's Theatre reappeared 
in the streets as a publicity team, 
pirforming on corners and in the 
!ones and terraces. explaining to 
the people what the liberation 
meant for them. 
These efforts endeared the 
Theatre to the whole population, 
both children and grown-ups. 
Under New Conditions 
Since the liberation, the Chil-
dren's Theatre has settled down to 
become one of the main cultural 
influences among the children of 
Shanghai and the whole nation. 
It is now entrusted with leader-
ship in lifting the level of chil-
dren's dramatics throughout 
China. Bearing this responsibi-
lity. the young members and facul-
ty are working seriously and mak-
ing long-range plans. They are 
struggling to lift their own techni-
que, to deepen their own under-
standing of the strength of the 
new China. In keeping with the 
basic policy of the China Welfare 
Institute, they have begun to con-
duct their theatre as an experi-
ment, as a model for the rest of 
the country. 
The present members of the 
theatre are boys and girls who 
have been especially selected for 
talent. As was the case with the 
original members, many of whom 
have since grown up and entered 
the general stream of national cul-
tural advance, they live and study 
collectively. Their training is 
based on the principle of linking 
study with practical work. They 
are divided into four sections: 
drama, dancing, music and art. 
In addition to receiving specialized 
technical training, each child 
also studies regular school sub-
jects. 
On the technical side, the chil-
dren in the dramatic section are 
taught how to analyze a play and 
to take various parts. They are 
encouraged to write their own 
plays and have revealed great 
creativeness. The youngsters come 
hiainly from working families and 
Lave themselves known both 
poverty and hard struggle for a 
Letter life. This brings their

tual experience of the vast major-
ity of our people, both the bitter-
ness of the past and the great 
energies released now that the 
people know they can change all 
things by their own efforts. 
Children in the art section are 
responsible for lighting, scenery, 
properties and costumes. Those 
in the music section have their 
own Chinese orchestra and 
another orchestra with European 
instruments. The dance section 
performs Chinese classical dances, 
ballets and modern dance. The 
music and dance sections try both 
to preserve the old national forms 
of China and to make them blend 
satisfactorily with forms originat-
ing elsewhere. 
People of a New Kind 
The relationship among the 
youngsters of the Children's 
Theatre is healthy and comradely. 
Their whole education is aimed 
toward developing self-govern-
ment, mutual help and coopera-
tion. Together, they summarize 
and draw conclusions from their 
work. They are taught to be 
open and frank at meetings, to 
bring up suggestions and debate 
hotly until they find a solu-
tion for the problems discussed. 
They have their own blackboard 
newspapers and wall bulletins, 
filled both with praise and criti-
cism. Most of the theatre's young-
sters have either become members 
of the Young Pioneers or the New 
Democratic Youth League, or are 
preparing to enter these organiza-
tions. One of the girl actors was 
among those selected to spend the 
summer in a Bulgarian Young 
Pioneers camp. 
In brief, the members of the 
CWI Children's Theatre are good 
examples of the new type of Chi-
nese youth, honest in mind and 
healthy in body, willing to receive 
and ready to give constructive 
criticism. Their qualities are the 
very ones on which the building 
of our new society is based, the 
qualities China prizes most high-
ly in her citizens. 
Character development of this 
kind helps the children in their 
chosen profession. Its results ap-
pear whenever the Children's 
Theatre performs. One can see 
them most vividly every June 1, on 
International Children's Day, the 
high point of each year's activity. 
It was on June 1, 1950, that the 
Theatre first presented "Little 
Snowflake." The play describes 
the persecution of the Negro peo-
ple in the United States and shows 
how the struggle against this per-
secution is organized. "Little 
Snowflake" went into more than 
thirty performances. Its young 
audiences followed it with un-
usual concentration. They loudly 
sympathized with the Negro hero, 
and demanded punishment for the 
bigoted villain. 
On International Children's Day 
in 1951, the theatre presented a 
dance pantomime, "Always Be 
Prepared." The title itself is the 
motto of China's Young Pioneers, 
and the pantomime portrayed the 
history and present activities of 
the organization. Beginning with 
scenes of children's life in the old 
liberated areas it brought the story 
to the Mao Tse-tung era through-
out the nation. Through the me-
dium of dance, it showed why 
Chinese children should study 
hard, play hard, and develop every 
faculty so as to be ready at all 
times for the construction and de-
fence of their country. "Always 
Be Prepared" played to full houses 
and enthusiastic audiences for 
three weeks. 
No less than 95,000 people wit-
nessed Children's Theatre per-
formances in the first half of 1951. 
At present, the members and 
faculty of the Children's Theatre 
continue to train and prepare. 
Their objective is the rapid exten-
sion and development of children's 
theatres as part of the tide of cul-
tural growth in China today.

Town and Country Trade 
"tnterflow" is a word you will 
hear often in China today. It is 
tile term applied to the exchange 
of goods between town and vil-
lage, farm and factory, workers 
and peasants on a nationwide 
basis. The reopening of old and 
disused channels for such ex-
change and the pioneering of new 
4.-ties is now a major concern of 
China's state trading enterprises, 
which are also leading and assist-
ing private business to participate. 
The internal commerce of China 
,ieelined catastrophically after 
1937. During the years of foreign 
nci civil war, all major avenues 
of communication were destroyed 
or blocked, causing some pro-
inces to lose every economic link 
tney had previously had with one 
another. Moreover, the peasants,

hroug,h war and oppression. 
Their production fell and they 
ceased to buy even the few manu-
f.ictured goods they had used 
before. In many places, the people 
yen stopped usire? matches, 
reverting to flint and steel. 
iw the situation 1:las changed 
Ht.h.2,et.lier. The country is unified 
and at peace. Barely two years 
..fica- the end of the destructive 
civil war on the mainland, rail-
ways have been fully restored and 
are carrying more freight than 
in any prewar year. The pea-
sants, masters of their own soil 
since the land reform, are produc-
ing with great enthusiasm because 
their output belongs to them and 
not to landlords. Foreign export 
firms and their collaborators no 
longer dominate the market for 
rural by-products such as skins, 
bristles, walnuts, eggs, etc.?whose 
prices they used to force down, 
leaving the producers in wretch-
edness. Conditions have been 
created not only for the restora-
tion of "interflow" trade but for 
its manifold increase over the 
past. To the extent that the vil-
lages find an outlet for their own 
products, they can become a 
limitless market for industry. 
Home Market Expands 
City industry, in its turn, now 
looks to the villages not only for 
markets but also for raw material. 
The unhealthy situation in which 
Chinese textile mills, for example, 
used to process imported cotton 
and export their products, has 
come to an end. The growth of 
"interflow" has become not only 
the most important way to foil 
imperialist blockade attempts but 
pproved For Release 2 
also a prerequisite to the rapid 
industrialization of the country. 
The economic administration 
organs of China have made the 
promotion of healthy internal 
commerce one of their most im-
portant jobs. They have already 
succeeded in driving speculators 
and hoarders from the field and 
organizing the home market on a 
healthy basis. State trading com-
panies purchased 130 per cent 
more agricultural goods and 154 
per cent more industrial goods 
in 1951 than in 1950. Their suc-
cess has stimulated legitimate 
private trade to serve the national 
economy in the same way. 
As a result, producers all over 
the country now find a ready mar-
ket. This is one of the major 
reasons why the purchasing power 
of the population as a whole has 
risen by 30 per cent in the past 
two years. Region by region, the 
increase in purchasing power has 
been even more spectacular, 
amounting to 60 per cent in South-
west China and 100 per cent in the 
Huai river area. The demand for 
industrial goods and raw ma-
terials, as well as consumers' 
goods, constantly runs in excess of 
supply. "Slack seasons" in business 
and industry have become a thing 
of the past. But, again through 
the steadying effect of state trade, 
neither the level of prices nor the 
balance of benefits to town and 
country have been disturbed. 
A Merchant's Story 
The way the state directs pri-
vate interests toward fruitful "in-
terflow" trade may be illustrated 
by the following example. 
Li Nien-tung is a merchant 
of Tsining. Shantung province. 
Straw matting, woven by pea-
sants, piled up at a cooperative 
ready for shipment to town.

Starting with a capital of Y30,000,-
000 People's Currency (US$1,500 
or ?535), he did Y2 billion (US 
$100,000 or ?35,700) worth of "in-
terflow" business in ten months. 
A man of 22 years' commercial 
experience, Li had engaged in 
inter-provincial trade once before. 
The anti-Japanese and civil wars, 
however, changed him into a re-
tail shopkeeper. After the libe-
ration, he was encouraged to put 
his old knowledge to use once 
more by repeated urgings from 
the authorities and by the credits 
offered by government banks 
and transport concerns. 
Li began by resuming his busi-
ness connections with other cities 
and setting up new ones. When 
visiting Tsinan, capital of Shan-
tung, he met a merchant from 
Tientsin and learned that Tientsin 
people loved to eat black melon 
seeds from the Shantung country-
side. In Tientsin, he found people 
lining up for diesel oil of which 
there happened to be considerable 
stocks in Canton. In Hunan, he 
found plenty of tung oil which was 
badly needed by Shantung fisher-
men for their boats. In Wusih he 
found vegetable oil factories short 
of soybeans, which were a drug on 
the market in his home town, each 
October. 
Within a few months, Li Nien-
tung's trade network spread over 
12 cities in all parts of the coun-
try. He kept up a large corres-
pondence and sent salesmen out 
with samples. Last spring he or-
ganized a combine of 15 firms 
dealing in sea food. His success 
brought him not only profit but 
also honour. The Bureau of Indus-
try and Commerce in his native 
town of Tsining cited him as an 
example of the kind of man "who 
can bring benefit both to himself 
and to the Chinese people." 
That Li Nien-tung and hundreds 
like him have done well in inter-
nal trade is of course no accident. 
With the carrying out of the land 
reform in most parts of China, the 
peasants have been working hard 
and busily ? because they are 
working for themselves. An esti-
mate made by the Committee 
on Financial and Economic 
Affairs of the Central People's 
Government shows that the by-

products our peasants produce for 
sale each year, over and above 
their main crops, amount to over 
Y40 trillion (US $2 billion) a year. 
Government trading companies, 
cooperatives and private business 
men are all coming into the mar-
ket for these, and are bringing in-
dustrial products from the cities 
to encourage the peasants to turn 
them into cash. Peasant purchas-
ing power is zooming. In some 
parts of the country, such as the 
Northeast, it went up fivefold in 
a single year. 
Rediscovering China's Wealth 
To promote the interflow of 
goods between town and village, 
Native Products Exhibitions have 
been held in key cities all over the 
country. Peasant producers from 
hundreds of miles away were able 
to send their goods there through 
their new co-operative marketing 
groups. Visitors came in millions, 
and enormous transactions were 
closed. 
Nomads were helped by the 
government to come all the way 
from Sinkiang to see the exhibi-
tion in Shanghai and to order tea, 
silk and manufactured goods. 
Businessmen who had lived 
along the coast all their lives were 
stimulated by things they heard 
and saw to travel thousands of 
miles into the interior, where they 
ordered furs, leather, sheepskins, 
herbs, tung oil, chemicals and raw 
materials for industry. 
The results are already evident 
in the appearance of southern 
bamboo manufactures as house-
hold articles in North China, and 
of tropical fruits in large quanti-
ties on the markets of Pekrng, 
Tientsin and the cities of the 
Northeast. 
Merchants and industrialists, 
especially, found that they had 
had no idea previously of the 
riches of their own country. Liv-
ing in the coastal ports which im-
perialism had tied to its own 
economy, they had formed the 
mental habit of relying on im-
ported goods for existence, and had 
really come to believe that China 
was poor in natural resources. 
One former importer exclaimed 
after returning to the north from 
an exhibition in Shanghai: "I 
had the shock of my life. Here 
I'd been importing expensive cork 
from abroad when we have tons 
of it, good and cheap, in our Shensi 
province." 
This businessman Is typical of 
many who used to consider the 
wide oceans no barrier while they 
had no idea of what materials 
could be found a few hundred 
miles inland. Now these men will 
start looking inside China for 
what they need. And they will 
find it, because the resources of 
our country are limitless.

which holds uornen in bondage. Women shall enjoy equal right!-

In spring of 1950, when the 
willows were turning green, 
Chairman Mao Tse-tung ordered 
the promulgation of the Marriage 
Law of the People's Republic of 
China. When the news reached 
Chaoyang village near Hulan 
county, Sungkiang province, it 
created quite a commotion. 
The old people felt it was an 
outrage to modesty. Some said, 
-The idea! Discarding all the old 
laws handed down by our ances-
tors." Others commented, "Every-
thing this government thinks up 
is good, but this marriage law..." 
and they shook their heads dis-
approvingly. 
Hut all the young men and 
women were overjoyed. Among 
them was a pair of lovers?a 
young man named Lai Hsing-ya 
and a girl named Chao Shu-cheng 
--who were happy from the 
bottom of their hearts. They 
thought secretly. "At last our 
road is open." 
The two of them lived in the 
same yard. Lai Hsing-ya had a 
father and mother and two 
younger brothers. Chao Shu-
cheng was the only daughter of an 
old widower. Both families had 
been poor and oppressed but had 
"gotten up from their knees" 
since liberation. 
Lai Hsing-va with his strong 
arms was one of the outstanding 
young peasants of the village. 
The only reason he was still single 
at 23 was that he had been too 
poor to marry. This worried his 
60-year-old mother more than 
anything. Day and night, she 
dreamed of holding a grandchild 
in her arms. 
The girl, 18-year-old Chao Slm-
cheng was also "a good worker." 
(Article 6 of the Common Programme or 
the Chinese People's Po tical Consultatirc 
('ariference). 
She was quick and skilful at every 
job, both inside and outside the 
house. Her mother had died 
when she was very young, and her 
father treasured her as the apple 
of his eye. Many men came to 
ask for her hand, but her father 
refused every time. He wanted a 
son-in-law who would come and 
ive with him and take care of him 
for the remainder of his life. He 
also dreamed of someone rich who 
would give him a lot of money so 
he would be able to buy a few 
things and get himself a new wife 
for his old age. 
When the peasants worked in 
mutual aid teams in the fields, 
Hsing-ya often helped Shu-
cheng and her father. Feeling 
that she should give something 
in return, Shu-cheng would go 
over to sew for the Lai family. 
When old Mrs. Lai saw Shu-
cheng's fine needlework, she took 
the girl to her heart and began to 
love her as her own daughter. 
Shu-cheng, on her part, felt that 
the old woman was kind and 
sweet. As for Shu-cheng's father, 
who was greatly respected, he 
would often say of the diligent 
Hsing-ya. "That boy has some-
thing to him." 
When they talked together, 
which was often, Hsing-ya who 
was a member of the Democratic 
Youth League would tell Shu-
cheng about many new things. 
Shu-cheng who had been to school 
for a couple of years would teach 
the illiterate Hsing-ya how to read 
and write. As time went on, they 
fell in love. 
During the slack season, the 
peasants began to rehearse a play. 
When it was presented, the whole 
village turned out to see it. 
Squeezed in the crowd were 
llsing-ya and Shu-cheng.

The play was called "Yang 
Hsiao-lin." It was about a pea-
sant boy who loved a peasant girl 
named Yang Hsiao-lin, and how 
they overcame all sorts of feudal 
obstacles in their fight for freedom 
of choice in marriage. As the 
play went on, Hsing-ya and Shu-
cheng got more and more ex-
cited. Hsing-ya felt that "Yang 
Hsiao-lin" in the play was just like 
Chao Shu-cheng. As for Shu-
cheng, she saw a strong resemb-
lance between the hero of the play 
and the sweetheart of her choice. 
On their way home, Hsing-ya 
plucked up courage and stammered 
to Shu-cheng, "Let's be like 'Yang 
Hsiao-lin'." Blushing furiously, 
Shu-cheng nodded assent. 
It did not take long for the 
whole village to see through 
Hsing-ya and Shu-cheng's "secret." 
Tongues began to wag. All the 
young people said enviously, 
"They are making a free choice." 
Admiringly they commented, 
"They are opening the road for us, 
good for them!" 
But people who were less open-
minded said, "How shocking! It 
seems that people will do any-
thing, so long as the law allows." 
Some even said, "It's because Shu-
cheng had no mother to teach her 
manners." 
When the talk was carried to 
the ears of Shu-cheng's father, he 
was simply furious. He felt that 
his daughter had brought shame 
on his house. Although he had 
known that Shu-cheng and Hsing-
ya saw each other very often, he 
had thought to himself, "They're 
only working together. There's 
no harm in that." Also he had 
been afraid of saying anything lest 
he offend Hsing-ya, in which case 
there would be nobody to help 
with the heavy work. 
Old Chao first wanted to give 
his daughter a good scolding, but 
on second thought he changed his 
mind. He reasoned: "The child 
has not had the care of a mother. 
She has worked like a boy, and 
hasn't had a chance to enjoy her-
self." So he ended by trying to 
dissuade Shu-cheng gently with: 
"Hsing-ya is a good boy. But his 
family is too poor. You will have 
a hard time if you marry him." 
-N.-FEB. 1952 
"Ile is a fine boy, but he is too poor." 
To his surprise, his daughter 
didn't take kindly to his well-
meant advice. She actually dared 
retort: "Hsing-ya may be poor 
now, but he's not going to be poor 
all his life. I like him because 
he's hard working, and I am ready 
to share any hardships with him. 
Besides the government believes 
that men and women should be 
allowed to choose their own life-
long partners. Parents should not 
interfere." 
Old Chao's eyes nearly popped 
out of his head. He ordered his 
daughter never to enter his house 
again. But Shu-cheng remained 
firm in her decision. 
At Hsing-ya and Shu-cheng's 
request, the village leaders went 
to have a talk with old man Chao. 
They pointed out how many 
traditional buy-and-sell marriages 
had ended tragically. They quoted 
paragraphs from the marriage 
law. Finally they said, "Freedom 
of choice in marriage is our 
national law. No one is allowed 
to go against it." The old man 
still dissented in his heart but had 
nothing more to say. 
The bumper harvest of 1950 was 
something that had not been seen 
in over a dozen years. Every 
family in the village rejoiced, 
especially the Lai family, which 
had a wedding to celebrate as well. 
But they banged no drums and 
cymbals, and killed no pigs or 
sheep, as was the custom. All 
that happened was this. At sun-
set, Shu-cheng and Hsing-ya put 
on new clothes, and came back 
from the marriage registration 
office, smiles all over their faces. 
Afterward, there was a simple 
wedding ceremony. As was the 
old custom, the village leaders and 
young people went into the 
newlyweds' bedroom, teased them 
and made them tell the story of 
their love. The sound of their 
laughter greatly irritated old man 
Chao who lived next door. Sigh-
ing and snorting, he drank one 
glass of wine after another. 
All eyes in the village were 
glued on the Lai family after this 
"strange" wedding ceremony. 
What everybody saw was that the 
very next day after the wedding, 
the bride and bridegroom went 
out to work on the harvest. The 
young couple showed even more 
zest than before in work and 
study. The Lais lived in harmony. 
The news spread to the villages 
around. Other young people 
followed Shu-cheng and Hsing-
ya's example, choosing their own 
partners. 
The old people were astonished. 
For her wedding, Shu-cheng had 
not conformed to any of the old 
superstitions. She had not stop-
ped to consider whether the day 
was lucky for weddings. The 
young couple had not bowed to 
heaven and earth for blessings. 
Still their married life seemed 
perfect. Said old Mrs. Lai, "This 
'freedom of choice' is really a good 
thing. The ceremony is simple 
and economical, and we old folks 
don't have to fuss over anything." 
Old man Chao stayed angry for 
some time. But he was gradually 
brought around by the behaviour 
of the Lai family. None of its 
members turned a cold shoulder 
on him for having tried to stop the 
marriage. On the contrary, they 
treated him even more kindly, and 
the young couple often came to 
see him and tell him the news. 
Besides, there was no more sar-
castic gossip around the village. 
Instead, some of the former 
gossips were heard to say: "Those 
young people did the right thing."

Fisheries 
Revive 
Like every other phase of 
national production, China's fisher-
ies are undergoing reconstruction 
and expansion. 
When the Kuomintang forces 
were driven off the east coast and 
out of the Chousan archipelago 17 
months ago. they left the fishing 
fleets depleted through neglect, 
extortion and deliberate sabotage. 
In 1934. East China had 68,807 
sea-going junks, 288 steam vessels 
and several tens of thousands of 
fresh water fishing boats. The 
average annual catch was 700,000 
tons of marine products. At the 
time of liberation, only 31,509 sea-
going fishing junks and 125 steam 
vessels were left. Most of these 
were damaged and unfit for ser-
vice. The fishing industry of the 
(7housan archipelago, in particular, 
had been almost completely put 
out of commission. 
Restoration Begins 
Since the People's Government 
was founded, it has extended 
fwery type of aid to the fishing 
people. Administrative organs at 
various levels were set up and 
fishermen's producer cooperatives 
were organized on a democratic 
basis. Government loans to the 
cooperatives amounted to Y199 
billion People's Currency (US 
'19,950.000 or ?3,553,500) in cash 
and 837 tons of salt to preserve 
their catch. 
Today. 58.404 fishing boats, 
56,080 sea-going junks and 131 
motor vessels are engaged in fish-
ing along the East China coast. 
They are equipped with 337,786 
nets of various kinds. The num-
ber of fishing boats which put out 
to sea from January to June last 
:::ear showed an increase of 71 per 
vent compared with the corres-
ponding period of 1950. More

boats are being launched as dock-
yards are put back into com-
mission. 
The 1951 target was a catch of 
300,000 tons. Preliminary figures 
showed that it was being met and 
might be considerably surpassed. 
The East China Marine Pro-
ducts Conference herd last sum-
mer set a 1952 target of 700.000 
tons?nearly double the catch of 
1950. It also drew up plans to 
strengthen the fishermen's own 
organizations to enlist their en-
thusiasm and raise production. 
Cooperatives and Markets 
In the past, East China's fisher-
men were feudally exploited by 
so-called fishing companies and 
"sales agencies" which collected 
arbitrary fees anti were really 
little more than "protection 
rackets." These parasitic and 
gangster practices are now only a 
had memory. Fish markets have 
been set up in Shanghai, Tsinguio, 
Chefoo. Ningpo, Wenchow, Chou-
san and Wusih. More than 300 
cooperatives are functioning in 
different fishing ports to help 
solve problems of production, 
marketing and supply, and to 
supervise the carrying out of re-
forms in the industry. 
The government has set up 
state-operated Marine Products 
Corporations in Shanghai and 
Shantung, and state-operated 
Marine Products Marketing Cor-
porations in Shantung, north 
Anhwei and Chekiang to unite and 
guide private merchants in the 
development of the fish industry. 
Large loans have been granted to 
private merchants to enable them 
to resume curing fish for storage 
and shipment elsewhere. 
Prices Stabilized; Business 
Expanded 
As a result of the Shanghai 
Native Products Exhibition and 
the East China Native Products 
Conference, contracts for large 
quantities of marine products have 
been concluded with North, North-
west and Southwest China, re-
viving long lost trade relations 
with these areas. During the sea-
son last year, the railway ad-
ministration lowered freight 
charges for fish, facilitating trans-
port and the proper fulfilment of 
these contracts. 
As a result of stability in cur-
rency and prices, and of steps 
taken by the government, the price 
of fish was maintained on an 
even level instead of fluctuating 
wildly as before. The surplus 
catch was put into cold stor-
age or absorbed from the market 
by processing and curing estab-
lishments. 
The volume of business in 
Shanghai last year ran at double 
the rate of 1950. The daily arrival 
of fish was often over 1,000 tons, 
greatly exceeding the customary 
past record. Yet there were no 
lulls in the fish market and no 
stocks were left to rot as "over-
supply." Last year, the whole-
sale price averaged Y2,000 (about 
10 cents U.S. currency or 81/2d.) 
per lb., equalling the domestic 
price of 1.8 lbs. of rice.

Aid by Government 
The People's Government has 
helped the fishermen who operate 
individually and constitute 90 per 
cent of the total. To aid them in 
increasing production, they have 
been given cash loans totalling 
Y79 billion (US $3,950,000 or 
?1,415,000) to buy boats, fishing 
equipment, food, and fish salt. 
Salt has been made available to 
them in large quantities at low 
cost. 
The people's armed forces have 
rid the seacoast of pirates, so that 
fishermen can put out to sea and 
go about their work without fear 
or worry. As a result, the num-
ber of fishing vessels active off 
the Chekiang coast in 1951 
doubled, and that off the Shan-
tung coast trebled as compared 
with 1950. 
It is natural that under these 
circumstances the livelihood of 
the fishermen has improved tre-
mendously. At the port of Kiao-
chow in Shantung, many have 
earned enough to begin keeping 
mules for transport and fattening 
pigs for the market. 
Conservation 
The East China Military and 
Administrative Committee on 
Marine Production has set up a 
special organ to compile data and 
do research into the fishing in-
dustry. 
The people's governments of 
various maritime municipalities 
and counties will enforce govern-
ment laws and decrees regarding 
the demarcation of prohibited 
areas and registration of fishing 
rights. The ownership and utiliza-
tion of fresh water fishing areas is 
being defined in accordance with 
the stipulations in the Agrarian 
Reform Law. 
Whenever necessary and pos-
sible, fishing port facilities, light-
houses and observation points are 
to be rehabilitated for the safety 
of the fishing fleet. 
Fishing grounds are now pro-
tected by a ban on the use of ex-
plosives and other destructive 
activities. It is forbidden either

below standard mesh. 
Wiping Out the Past 
This picture is entirely in con-
trast t o the situation before 
liberation. The three state-operated 
marine products enterprises taken 
over from the Kuomintang were 
all notorious for their cor-
ruption and waste. The Ameri-
cans too had set up a "Fisheries 
Rehabilitation Administration" to 
exploit and enslave our fisheries. 
American and Kuomintang secret 
service personnel used to occupy 
responsible positions in the in-
dustry. Functionaries appointed 
by the Americans were retired 
navy men posing as experts in 
fishery. 
American trawler captains drew 
salaries of US $900 per month, plus 
a bonus of US $0.0275 per pound 
of fish caught. Sometimes a boat 
load of fish was sold for barely 
enough to cover the bonus of the 
foreign captain, especially when 
the catch consisted of species that 
did not bring a good price on the 
market. 
The "Fisheries Rehabilitation 
Administration" maintained 130 
fishing boats, whose monthly over-
head expenses amounted to Y5.6 
billion if reckoned in present cur-
rency. All the boats together 
caught 10,000 tons of fish in four 
years, which sold for only about 
one ninth of the expenditure 
claimed. Enormous sums sup-
posedly collected for improve-
ments went into private pockets 
leaving no trace in the account 
books. This was what the Ameri-
cans called a project for relief and 
rehabilitation, to revive the fish-
eries by "scientific methods." 
The "China Marine Products 
Company" and the "Yellow Sea 
Marine Products Company," which 
were merely paper organizations 
when taken over, have now been 
reorganized into the Shanghai 
Marine Products Company and the 
Shantung Marine Products Com-
pany. By the united efforts of 
their workers, they were purged 
of reactionary and corrupt ele-
ments and put into proper order. 
The People's Government is 
making big investments in ship-
building and processing plants for 
the fisheries. Trawlers are busy 
at sea. Eight ice and cold storage 
plants, two dockyards, two net 
factories, two cod liver oil refin-
eries and one cannery are now 
serving the fishing grounds of the 
East China coast.

Prosperity in Private Enterprise 
\fter a successior of meetings 
,;eeri labour and management 
in the second half of July 1951, the 
Ileneyuan Textile Mill, a 
oriioerous enterprise financed by 
e capital. announced new 
pnniuctior, eoals for the month of 
,ust. Dy the end of the month 
these ,coa is had been exceeded. 
Pt ,dits were also 23 per cent. 
.her than had been anticipated. 
The experiences of the Hen 
-1,`.11-1 mill, which has existed for 
years but never did well in the 
past, are typical of the whole 
private textile industry of China. 
;; the good business, and its 
,ortidence in its prospects at the 
pre:-?mt time. 
%%lien the Hengyuan Mill was 
ivied a generat ion ago, its 
liarehoiders were most iv northern 
warlords who quickly turned its 
pl,:nagement into a sink of cor-
ruption and bureau 'racy. Every 
,_mry official, big or small. made 
'.!P;fiey for himself on the side. 
For instance, one man who was 
re,,ponsible for checking the 
weight of coal had a monthly 
salary of only 10 Yuan (about US 
$5.00 at the time), yet he bought 
hirnself twelve houses in Tientsin 
at the end of a few years. No 
wonder Pien Shih-ching, the 
white-haired bespectacled old 
director of the mill, says when he 
recalls the past: "Hengyuan used 
to be riddled with a thousand 
holes and covered with a hundred 
Aires. 
In 1928, when Hengyuan went 
bankrupt and closed down, no one 
was surprised. A year later, new 
bank loans were negotiated and 
an effort was made to reopen. In-
efficiency and the competition of 
large amounts of Japanese yarn 
then being smuggled into Tientsin 
quick iy caused its doors to shut 
again. 
Til 1930. Ifengyuan was re-
ory;anized by a banking group 
which rid it of its feudal features 
and tried to run it along modern 
lines. Business was beginning to 
look up when Tientsin was oc-
cupied by the Japanese. 
The Japanese were soon trying 
to get control of the Hengyuan 
mill, offering to "cooperate" with 
its owners. When this failed, they 
attempted to buy up all the shares. 
Failing again, they simply broke 
into the mill and robbed it of one-
third of its machinery. Moreover. 
through a system of cotton ration-
ing, they starved it of raw 
material. By 1942, only 800 of the 
M,700 spindles were operating. 
Victory over Japan did not help 
Hengyuan either. The new mana-
ger who took over under the Kuo-
mintang gave key positions to in-
capable relatives and friends, 
whom the workers secretly called 
by such names as "The Thirteen 
Tyrants" and "The Four Bullies." 
'Fhese parasites cared nothing for 
the mill but took advantage of the 
Kuomintang inflation to make 
money on the black market while 
the enterprise itself rapidly 
heaped up debts. 
A New Situation 
In January 1949, Tientsin was 
liberated by the People's Army. 
A new economic policy was laid 
down to ensure that both labour 
and capital would benefit from a 
joint effort to increase production. 
lint although the worst elements 
in its ranks no longer ruled the 
roost, Hengyuan's management 
did not at first understand the 
policy. Nor did the workers. 
The leaders of the labour union 
were afraid that if they worked 
to increase production they would 
appear to be toadying to the cap-
italists and would therefore lose 
the confidence of the members 
who looked to them for better 
living conditions above all else.

Workers meet to consider how 
best to carry out their pledges 
at the production conference. 
On the other hand, the capital-
ists were filled with apprehension. 
They were not sure that they 
could make money under the new 
conditions. They were timid 
about making a real effort to pro-
mote production. They did not 
consult the labour union on their 
problems, because they thought it 
was out for higher wages only, 
and had no other concerns. To 
show that they were "progressive" 
they gave the union anything that 
it asked for, but they did it grudg-
ingly. 
In May, Liu Shao-chi, vice-
chairman of the government and 
a senior leader of China's Com-
munist Party, came to Tientsin 
and gave his famous talk on "be-
nefits for both capital and labour." 
This greatly clarified the situation. 
The mill-workers came to under-
stand that to produce more was 
the only way to improve their 
standard of living. Industrial 
output rose almost at once. 
Labour-Capital Conferences 
Regular conferences between 
labour and the mill-owners to dis-
cuss how to increase production, 
began in February, 1950. 
At first, the management repre-
sentatives were very dubious and 
uneasy about such conferences. 
On the one hand they had seen 
how workers in state-owned fac-
tories organized themselves to 
push production forward and 
thought the Hengyuan mill might 
derive similar benefits. On the 
other hand, they were afraid the 
discussions might get "out of 
hand." What if a worker got up 
at a public meeting and asked 
embarrassing questions about 
deadwood administrative per-
sonnel who might be holding jobs 
not because of any ability but as a 
result of ties of friendship or 
family with the owners? 
To put it briefly, the manage-
ment first thought only of how it 
might use the union rather than 
cooperate with it for the common 
good. It was this outlook which 
caused it to make the suggestion 
that, instead of joint meetings, two 
union delegates might be allowed 
to attend meetings of the admini-
stration. 
The union turned down this of-
fer, because it felt that it would 
reduce the role of its repre-
sentatives from joint leadership 
in production to merely answer-
ing questions. To ease the fears 
of the owners, the union repeated 
once more that the only purpose 
of the production conferences 
would be to raise output, and that 
no decisions would be taken on 
which both sides did not agree. 
If either management or labour 
disagreed on a problem, no deci-
sion would be made. The owners 
fully accepted this formula and 
the conferences began on a regular 
basis. 
Why Production Rose 
Workers' delegates to the talks 
reported regularly to the rank-
and-file, raising their sense of 
participation and consequently 
their enthusiasm. As a result, 
many knotty problems were 
solved. Here are some examples. 
One of the spinning shops suc-
cessfully increased its yarn out-
put, but the winding shop, which 
was next in the production line, 
could not keep up with it. As a 
result, the unwoun d yarn piled 
up in great quantities. Manage-
ment had tried to solve this prob-
lem by getting the winders to 
work overtime. This had only 
resulted in fatigue and illness 
among the workers without im-
proving the situation. 
When the question was submit-
ted to the conference, the union 
undertook to seek the workers' 
advice on how to remove the 
bottleneck by improving work-
methods and granting bonuses, in-
stead of overtime or speed-up. 
The management was skeptical 
saying, "Let's see if you can con-
vince them?" The results fully 
justified the union suggestion, and 
the lag was successfully elimi-
nated. 
In the weaving department, the 
owners had tried long and unsuc-
cessfully to get each worker to 
mind eight looms instead of four 
or six. The union pointed out 
that the trouble lay not in techni-
que but in the wage system. 
When the workers themselves 
were enlisted in working out an 
equitable wage scale, the previous-
ly "insoluble" question turned out 
to be quite simple. 
Hengyuan Becomes a Model 
Another spectacular improve-
ment took place in the elimina-
tion of waste. The union mobi-
lized the workers to devise ways 
of cutting it down. As a result, 
the average daily waste was re-
duced from 500 lbs. to 270 lbs. It 
was then that director Pien declar-
ed: "I've been running factories 
for scores of years, but I could 
never imagine anything like this 
before."

ictories in China. More scien-

from each. 
Better Work: Better Life 
Wage standards have been re-
adjusted. All workers, technicians 
ad management personnel are 
2H Ay paid according to actual 
hinction and ability on the job?
not according to custom or con-
nections. 
Personnel-shifts have been 
made in accordance with the needs 
of productive efficiency. 
The mill owners have come to 
modify their idea that low wages 
irt, die only source of prosperity. 
They have learned from facts the 
importance of satisfying the work-
ers' demands for a betteer life. 
Appropriations from profits have 
been used to improve the mill 
hospital and to build spare-time 
schools for the workers and 
creches for their children. The 
workers now eat meat and 
polished rice instead of rough 
grains as before. 
The business of the Hengyuan 
cotton mill is better than it has 
ever been. Profits by the end of 
1949 were already sufficient to 
pay off all its accumulated debts, 
with plenty to spare. Since then 
a substantial surplus has been 
built up. 
No longer menaced by the 
causes which made life for Chi-
nese factories so precarious in the 
old days of bureaucratic extortion 
and unfair imperialist competi-
tion, the owners of the Hengyuan 
cotton mill are now buying new 
machinery and planning to set up 
a mill in west China. They have 
also sent out salesmen all over the 
country to collect orders for 
Hengyuan's constantly growing 
output.

The People's Relief 
Administration of China 
L111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 
The natural calamities which 
afflicted the people of China for 
centuries were really largely man-
made. They drew such heavy 
toll only because the people had 
lost all power to avert disasters 
and limit their effects. The cause of 
this situation was the long-stand-
ing robbery of the country by im-
perialism, feudalism, and bureau-
cratic monopoly. As a result, the 
working people of China lived 
under the constant threat of 
hunger and death. 
Today the Chinese people have 
risen from their knees. They are 
rapidly rebuilding their economic 
life, social relationships and na-
tional defence. Relief and social 
welfare work in both town and 
country have ceased to be isolated 
and become a part of the general 
peaceful reconstruction of the 
country. 
How It was Organized 
The People's Relief Administra-
tion of China (PRAC) has the 
task of achieving this integration 
throughout China. It was set up 
after the All-China People's Re-
lief Conference held in Peking 
in April 1950. The conference was 
called by the Chinese Liberated 
Areas Relief Administration 
(CLARA) which had previously 
operated in the old liberated areas 
of China. It was attended by re-
presentatives of the All-China 
Federation of Labour, the All-
China Federation of Democratic 
Youth, the All-China Student 
Federation and the All-China 
Federation of Literature and Arts, 
relief and welfare organizations, 
the Chinese Red Cross and medical 
associations, Chinese returned from 
abroad, peasants, national minori-
ties, industrialists and business-
men, religious workers, refugees 
and local and central government 
departments concerned with relief. 
At this meeting, the People's Re-
lief Administration of China came 
into being. 
In a sense, PRAC is the suc-
cessor of CLARA. The older or-
AN.-FEB. 1952 
ganization had collected material 
on Japanese atrocities and sent 
it abroad as proof of its accusa-
tions against the Japanese in-
vaders. It had also reported, 
in its Chinese and English lan-
guage publications, on the wide-
spread relief work it was doing in 
the liberated areas. This brought 
in large contributions of cash and 
relief goods from peace-loving and 
progressive people in other parts 
of China and in many other coun-
tries: CLARA had distributed 
these contributions, which came 
chiefly through Soong Ching Ling 
(Mme. Sun Yat-sen), to refugees 
from flood and drought in the 
liberated areas and to the Inter-
national Peace Hospitals. It had 
also negotiated with UNRRA for 
relief goods. 
A People's Organization 
The People's Relief Administra-
tion of China is not a government 
department. It is a people's or-
ganization. Its chairman is Soong 
Ching Ling, who had previously 
contributed so much to the wel-
fare of the people of the liberated 
areas. She is concurrently chair-
man of the China Welfare Institute. 
The vice-chairmen of PRAC are 
Tung Pi-wu, former chairman of 
CLARA; Hsieh Chueh-tsai, a wel-
fare worker with decades of ex-
perience; Li Teh-chuan, (Mme. 
Feng Yu-hsiang) vice-chairman of 
the All-China Federation of De-
mocratic Women and chairman of 
the Chinese Red Cross; and Wu 
Yao-tsung, a man long prominent 
in religious work and an out-
standing leader of the Chinese 
YMCA. Led by this distinguished 
group, PRAC has been carrying 
on large scale relief and welfare 
work by mobilizing society to 
help care for those in distress and 
by assisting refugees and destitute 
people to earn a livelihood through 
production. 
Productive employment has be-
come the principal method of ad-
ministering relief to the needy in 
both urban and rural areas of our 
country. All over China, institu-
tions have been set up where re-
fugees and city poor may learn a 
craft, enabling them to maintain 
themselves. In these places, for-
mer beggars, pickpockets, and 
prostitutes are also re-educated 
for production. 
FRAC executive committee members sign papers governing the take-over of U.S.-
subsidized welfare institutions after serious abuses had been discovered in them.

In 1949, there were floods in 
China, but we succeeded in over-
entn ing them successfully. The 
People's Government sent supplies 
and money for the victims while 
p.,opie all over the country do-
nated winter clothing and other 
necessities. Distribution of relief 
goods in the affected areas was 
entrusted to PRAC. The govern-
ment, through PRAC and local 
authorities, helped the flood suf-
ferers to organize and maintain 
themselves by fishing, chopping 
wood, weaving straw mats, pre-
paring saltpetre, making vege-
ta ble oil, embroidering, spinning 
and weaving, so that everybody 
ir the countryside was busy and 
rn in g something. 
The same method was applied 
ill administering relief to unem-
ployed city workers. In the year 
May 19:50 to May 1951, the number 
ni unemployed workers in China 
:tecreased by two-thirds. 
China is a country of 475,000,000 
people with tremendous man-
power, natural and financial re-
-,eurces. Our great potential, even 
at the present level of economy, 
may be illustrated by one ex-
ample. In the autumn of 1950, 
P 11.AC began a campaign for win-
ter clothes for flood refugees in 
,1,)rth Anhwei. In three short 
inonths, over 6.800,000 winter out-
is been contributed by 
,mnnathetic people all over China, 
!nore than enough to clothe all the 
refugees warmly. This spirit of 
helping others in distress is a part 
al the Chinese character. Today 
it has full opportunity to develop. 
China has many private welfare 
and relief organizations. Some 
[ire international, some are na-
tional, some are nation-wide and 
some are local. Some of these 
irganizations exist only in name, 
and are no longer effective. But 
a number of private welfare and 
relief institutions have real capa-
i.ity for useful work. Since it was 
.At up in 1950, PRAC has been 
helping them improve their activi-
ties and apply them in an effective 
way. 
Helping Others 
The work of the People's Relief 
Administration of China now ex-
tends to sufferers from disasters 
PRAC workers teach public health through dances. 
and oppression outside our own 
borders. For example, British 
colonial authorities have been per-
secuting Chinese living in Malaya, 
deporting many to China after the 
loss of all their property. To 
meet this situation, PRAC and the 
Association of Returned Chinese 
from Overseas have jointly organ-
ized the Chinese People's Relief 
Committee for Refugees from 
Malaya. This committee is now 
very active. 
Since the beginning of the war 
in Korea, tens of thousands of 
Koreans have lost home and live-
lihood. PRAC is carrying on a 
donation campaign to help them 
which has already produced large 
quantities of foodstuffs, blankets, 
cloth, clothing, cotton, shoes, 
stockings, medicine and such 
household necessities as needles 
and thread. 
Taking Over U.S. "Charities" 
Another job of FRAC has been 
to take over charities formerly 
subsidized by funds from the 
United States. To attain its own 
purposes, American imperialism 
directly or indirectly carried on 
various "charities" in China. 
Later, again for its own political 
purposes, it suddenly stopped all 
subsidies to these charities. Ob-
viously, the aim of such man-
oeuvres was not really to further 
the welfare of the Chinese people, 
but rather to smooth the road to 
U.S. domination over China. 
Following liberation, it was dis-
covered that Chinese children had 
been subjected to mental and 
physical torture in imperialist-run 
orphanages. It was proved con-
clusively by material evidence 
that tens of thousands of children 
had died in these institutions, 
some of which showed a death 
rate of from 70 to over 90 per cent 
in their own registration books. 
Children who were so fortunate 
as to survive were also found to 
be in shocking condition. 
Faced with such a situation, 
the Government Administration 
Council directed that U.S.-sub-
sidized charities be taken over. A 
meeting was called in Peking to 
discuss procedures, which were 
then successfully applied in many 
cities. In place of the funds which 
stopped coming from America, 
PRAC has financed those institu-
tions which have continued to 
operate, as well as guided them in 
the improvement of their work. 
PRAC now has offices in all the 
big cities of China. PRAC be-
lieves that, with China's increasing 
prosperity, the number of people 
in need of relief will gradually 
decrease year by year. With this 
in mind, PRAC aims to turn 
gradually from relief to welfare 
work.

The China Welfare 
Institute 
-  '4C0"S"I?www4OZIGNT0,-40"  
The China Welfare Institute has 
a history of 13 years. It was 
founded and is still headed by 
Soong Ching Ling (Mme. Sun Yat-
sen), one of the greatest person-
alities in China's struggle for free-
dom from oppression and poverty. 
Since its inception in 1938, it has 
worked to serve the best interests 
of the Chinese people. 
The organization began its work 
during the Sino-Japanese war as 
the China Defence League, a name 
that became known to friends of 
democracy everywhere. Through-
out the war years it served as a 
focal point for the distribution of 
funds and supplies sent by friends 
of China from all parts of the 
world to aid the fighters against 
Japanese invasion. It helped set 
up and support the renowned 
International Peace Hospitals, 
founded nurseries and orphanages 
for the child victims of the war 
and gave impetus to the formation 
of industrial cooperatives to bol-
ster the war-torn economy and 
provide employment, free of ex-
ploitation, for large numbers of 
refugees. CDL projects were 
located where the fighting was 
heaviest and had taken the great-
est toll. Many of them were be-
hind the Japanese lines, in the 
guerilla areas. 
Battle Against Obstacles 
After V-J Day, the CDL chang-
ed its name and the forms of its 
work to fit the new circumstances. 
As the China Welfare Fund, it ex-
panded its original projects in the 
interior regions. At the same 
time, it contributed to the overall 
rehabilitation of the country by 
instituting new projects. 
The First International Peace Hos-
pital, housed in caves in Yenan 
during the war with Japan. 
"AN.-FEB. 1952 
The last years of the Kuomin-
tang regime threatened to drown 
all ideas of reviving China in in-
flation, corruption and outright 
official suppression of everything 
new. But despite the obstacles, 
and because of the inspired leader-
ship of Chairman Soong, the China 
Welfare Fund continued its work. 
During the Liberation War, the 
Fund led the nationwide demand 
that UNRRA and other inter-
national relief and welfare aid be 
allocated fairly where the people 
needed it most, whether the Kuo-
mintang controlled the areas or 
not. It not only demanded such 
distribution but set an example of 
it in its own activity. Within Kuo-
mintang territory it demanded 
that aid go to the famine areas of 
South China and shouldered the 
task of keeping starving children 
off the streets and roads. It de-
manded that help be given to the 
city poor, and demonstrated what 
could be done by establishing, in 
the slums of Shanghai, children's 
centres which provided literacy 
training, medical care and dis-
tribution of food and clothing on 
a mass scale. It also created the 
Children's Theatre both to enter-
tain and educate thousands of 
workers' children. 
The third phase of the organiza-
tion's history began with the 
liberation of the Chinese mainland 
and the convening of the All-
China People's Relief Conference 
in April 1950. It changed its 
name once more, becoming the 
China Welfare Institute. Then it 
embarked on the new develop-
ment for which the people's vic-
tory now provided unparalleled 
opportunities. 
Present Work 
The present task of the CWI is 
to set up model projects for 
nationwide welfare and cultural 
work for the wives and children of 
workers, farmers and soldiers. 
Since liberation, its staff has 
grown tenfold to the present total 
of over three hundred. Its field 
units have increased from four to 
eleven. Instead of the makeshift 
and crowded rented quarters of 
the past, it is now housed in a 
handsome office building of its own 
in Shanghai. 
Current CWI projects range 
from nurseries to the publication 
of a children's magazine, from 
maternity and child health centres 
to a Children's Theatre. It has

network of maternity and child

programmes are not new to China, 
but the objectives they now 
pursue are. Their present aim is 
not to serve a few "cases" but the 
largest. numbers of workers. This 
requires a changed point of view, 
both on the part of the technical 
personnel and the women them-
selves. Much education and pub-
licity is being carried on to re-
orient technicians toward work 
fur the greater number of people, 
:Ind to convince the people to 
accept modern methods in child-
birth and sanitation. The respon-
sibility that has fallen on the CWI 
is great, since the results it obtains 
will be critically studied and used 
throughout the land. 
Facing the Future 
Thus the China Welfare Ins-
ttute now occupies one of the 
i'iutemost positions in welfare work 
iii China. Its representatives sit 
YIGthers brIrg their babies to the CWI centres for regular check-ups. 
on the executive committee of the 
People's Relief Administration of 
China, which is the leading or-
ganization for all relief and wel-
fare nationally. On the opera-
tional level, CWI delegates parti-
cipate in working committees and 
attend national and local con-
ferences on welfare, culture and 
education. The head of its mater-
nity and child health section, for 
instance, is a delegate to the 
National Health Conference held 
annually in Peking. Regionally. 
CWI cultural workers took part in 
the East China Conference which 
determined the cultural pro-
gramme for an area with a 
population of 140 million people. 
The CWI has also been represented 
internationally. One of its staff 
members was a delegate to the 
Second World Peace Congress held 
in Warsaw. 
The advances and accomplish-
ments of the China Welfare Insti-
tute are a manifestation of the 
general improvement that has 
come about in the lives of the 
Chinese people since the founding 
of the People's Republic of China. 
As the country's economic posi-
tion gradually gains strength, 
more funds and facilities will be 
made available for welfare work. 
The CWI looks forward to the 
future. It is preparing itself to 
assume new and heavier duties in 
the service of our people.

CHILDREN'S CULTURAL PALACE . 
In the past Shanghai was well known 
for the appallingly crowded and in-
sanitary conditions in which thousands of 
workers lived, ate, slept and died. Few 
children went to school. They never 
dreamed that they might have cultural 
facilities. Their playgrounds were the 
dusty, crowded lanes and streets. But 
these conditions are being rapidly 
changed. 
One step toward the change was made 
when the CWI officially opened its 
Children's Cultural Palace last July in 
the Yulin factory district, where there 
are 40,000 youngsters. The Palace will 
supplement the education the children 
get in schools. It will work to raise the 
cultural level of the most promising 
children through a variety of activities 
including music, dancing, acting, study of 
natural history and other subjects A 
library with an initial 4,000 books has 
been installed and will be built up 
further. 
CWI IN SHANGHAI WOMAN ANID 
CHILD HEALTH COMMITTEE 
CWI health workers have accepted a 
leading role in the newly-organized 
Shanghai Woman and Child Health Com-
mittee. The Committee is composed of 
representatives of 17 organizations in-
cluding the Shanghai Trade Union Coun-
cil, the Health Bureau, the Democratic 
Women's Association, and the CWI. Its 
functions will include planning and 
coordinating of all activities in the field; 
preparation of plans for woman and child 
health work; coordination of work by 
private and public health workers; inten-
sification of health education and 
publicity, and training of cadres; in-
vestigation and improvement of techniques 
and efficiency. 
NEW WAYS TO MODERN MEDICINE 
One-act playlets portraying childbirth 
under old and modern conditions respec-
tively were performed continuously 
before audiences totalling 16,000 people 
during a seven-day Mother and Child 
Health Exhibition organized by the China 
Welfare Institute and the District People's 
Government of Kiangning, Shanghai in 
July 1951. In the month following this 
experiment, the number of delivery calls 
to the CWI clinic in the district doubled 
by actual count. This was a very im-
portant achievement, because one of the 
main problems in reducing the infant 
mortality rate in China is to convince 
women that modern medical care in the 
CWI Children's Cultural Palace, 
delivery of babies is more reliable than 
that of an old-fashioned midwife. 
Realism was the secret of the ex-
hibition's success. To see the childbirth 
scenes, the audience filed through two 
rooms. In the first, the mother (a 
dummy) was propped up in the traditional 
sitting position in extreme discomfort, 
with no arrangements for sterilization 
anywhere in sight and only a superstitious 
midwife to assist. When it became 
apparent the woman was having difficulty 
the midwife had no way to "help" except 
by lighting candles and praying loudly. 
In the second room the woman was 
lying comfortably in bed, a number of 
shiny instruments were being sterilized 
and a doctor in clean overalls and rubber 
gloves was helping with the delivery. 
Raconteurs described exactly what was 
happening in both tableaux. They ex-
plained why one way was bad and the 
Model aeroplanes are a favourite hobby at the Chil-
dren's Cultural Palace, where a special construc-
tion room, with materials and teachers, is provided.

Protect 
The 
Children! 
SOONG CHING LING 
PROTECT the children! Protect 
them from every possible 
harm! Give them every advan-
tage in life! 
These are the demands of any 
decent person. For nothing is 
dearer to man than his children. 
But today, the children are 
under direct threat. Already war 
is a devastating fact in several 
corners of the world. Already 
mothers are standing amidst torn 
fields and rubbled streets, shed-
ding bitter tears for their young 
ones. This has alerted mankind. 
It is a warning that we must act 
now to prevent such misery and 
distress from sweeping over all 
children. We can see that pro-
tecting the children is first and 
foremost a problem of peace. 
The world's ordinary men and 
women want one thing above all 
else. They want to live out their 
lives, to raise their youngsters and 
to do their work in peace. They 
are solidly behind the idea that 
humanity must be spared the 
horror, the wounds, the waste, the 
deforming of children which has 
twice marked this century. They

may differ in religion; they may 
differ on political questions; 
they may be workers, writers, 
mechanics or farmhands; but they 
all hold one thing in common?
that we must strive with might 
and main to prevent war, to pro-
tect the children. 
The broad and all-inclusive 
delegations now streaming into 
Vienna are a concrete expression 
of the intensity of this feeling. 
Answering the call of the Women's 
International Democratic Federa-
tion, they are gathering for a his-
toric conference which will meet 
from April 12-16 to mobilize all 
those who seek to protect the 
children. They come as repre-
sentatives of hundreds of mil-
lions of people who think that 
peace and the well-being of chil-
dren are inextricably woven 
together; that war, far from being 
inevitable, can most certainly be 
stopped in its tracks. 
This meeting in Vienna is ex-
tremely important. It is the first 
time in man's history that an in-
ternational movement has been 
formed to protect the children, 
that an organized attempt is being 
made to break through to a solu-
tion of the gnawing anxiety which 
has torn at women's hearts for 
thousands of years?the fear of 
what war does to their children. 
THE SOLUTION starts with the 
mother in every home taking 
her stand that there shall be no 
war. It gathers momentum as 
each mother realizes that in the 
neighbourhood, in the district, in 
the villages and towns and in the 
entire nation, there are other 
mothers who feel equally strongly 
about this question. Then it 
reaches a crescendo of strength as 
mothers act in unison all over the 
world, not only to prevent war, 
but also to stop the preparations 
for war. Such unity of action is 
entirely possible. We are living 
in an age of expanding science, 
when war effects everyone, every-
where, and the desire to avert 
such disaster is universal. The 
meeting in Vienna is a demonstra-
tion of this immense will for 
peace. It will be a major step in 
effecting the solution. 
There will certainly be those 
who will dare to resist and even

attempt to thwart this inex-
tinguishable urge to protect the 
children. They will try every 
manner and means of deceit. But 
at each turn they will betray 
themselves. For our demands 
are simple and logical. One is 
either for peace or against it. 
Thus, it is easy to determine who 
is friend and who is foe, with 
whom we should unite and against 
whom we should struggle. 
THIS DISTINCTION is impor-
tant. Even those who now 
prepare for war must take into 
account the people's longing for 
peace. They turn their whole 
economy to war production; they 
whip their people into a frenzy of 
fear and confusion and besiege 
the minds of children with terror 
of the atom bomb?all in the name 
of peace. In international or-
ganizations, the representatives of 
some governments concoct pro-
grammes which, they claim, seek 
peace. But the ink is hardly dry 
before they rush off to side 
conferences to plan war openly, or 
dispatch their troops and equip-
ment to ring upon ring of newly-
built war bases. With these 
people, there is no relation 
between word and deed. But to 
be sincerely for peace, words and 
deeds must match. 
Such people will expose them-
selves. They are bound to isolate 
themselves from the multitudes 
who want no part of their dirty 
plots, and who will oppose in 
every available way their schemes 
of death for men, women and 
children. 
There will also be those who 
will insist that organized action 
by the world's mothers is of no 
use. They will say that there is 
really nothing we can do about 
war since it is inevitable, since it 
is man in his "natural state." 
These people are the gullible 
victims of those who profit by 
war, of the breeders of misunder-
standing and the splitters trained 
to vitiate any move the people 
make for peace. We will seek to 
convince them with facts. We 
will show them, by the united 
outcry of our hundreds of millions, 
that man can,reject war once and 
for all. We will demonstrate that 
man not only hates war, but is

most creative and most satisfied 
only when he is at peace and co-
operating with his neighbours. 
THERE WILL BE still another 
1- category of opposition to the 
movement for the protection of 
children. It will adopt a "learned" 
or "philosophical" approach. Its 
exponents have dragged Malthus 
from his grave and are attempting 
to resurrect his theories. "War is 
to the benefit of the human race," 
they say in effect. "It reduces 
the 'excess' population, allows 
more breathing space, solves the 
problem of the world's food short-
age," and so forth. 
This is thinking which has the 
smell of death. Yet we must 
reply to it, since it does receive 
credence in many western coun-
tries. Many recently published 
books put forward this line of 
thought. Highly "recommended" 
scholars spout it all too frequently 
in university halls, on lecture 
platforms, in the press and over 
the radio. 
To these people, and to those 
who listen to them, we say: Look 
around you, sirs. How can you 
not see what man has done with 
his two hands and brain? See 
how man, in his love of life and 
peace, has worked the most 
momentous developments in the 
earth's history! See how he has 
conquered, subdued, bent to his 
will the forces of nature! See the 
new gigantic strides he is taking 
at this very moment! You must 
be blind not to see that man has 
accepted challenges, solved every 
problem, and is on top, just be-
cause of his eagerness for life; 
that today we have knowledge 
with which to build a full and 
cultured life for every man, wo-
man and child. 
WE KNOW for a fact that man 
" has but scratched the surface 
in providing for himself on this 
earth. The earth does not need 
to be depopulated. Rather, there 
is an actual need for more people. 
There is no "fate" or "inevitabil-
ity" that requires our children to 
be slaughtered in war. Rather, 
we need to protect and nurture 
them so as to have more hands 
and brains to further develop 
civilization. 
These are the solid facts. In 
China, in the past two years alone, 
we have demonstrated them 
beyond question. Many of the 
former "China experts" made 
their reputations by citing "over-
population" as the cause of China's 
ills, thus diverting attention from 
the heavy burden of feudalism 
and imperialism with which the 
Chinese people were weighed 
down. The "chronic food short-
age" in China was their favourite

illustration. But since the found-
ing of our People's Republic, we 
have deprived them of this 
example. We already produce 
enough food to satisfy the needs 
of our own population and provide 
?an excess for export as well. Yet 
we are still far from mechanized 
farming and large sections of our 
land remain to be reclaimed! So 
the facts prove not only that we 
can feed and clothe our present 
population, but that we can indus-
trialize and support many more 
people. 
What better demonstration can 
There be of the real causes and 
remedies for the "insoluble" pro-
blems of the so-called experts? 
Our own experience, in which we 
were anticipated by others and 
which holds true for all nations, 
shows that where a system can 
"function" only by condemning 
people to poverty and death. the 
people answer by condemning 
that system to death?and them-
selves go on living! 
So much for the philosophers of 
decay and war who ask mothers 
not to weep for their children be-
cause they are "expendable." No 
children are expendable. No na-
tion is expendable. All races and 
peoples have their own significant 
accomplishments, which have 
advanced or are advancing man-
kind. And now, at long last, the 
peoples are beginning to act to-
gether for the rights of each. Is 
there any reason for despair? 
There is more reason than ever 
for optimism. The difficulty does 
not exist which man cannot over-
come! 
Wherein does the main threat 
to our children lie? Today the 
key struggle is against the 
destructive intent of a mere hand-
ful of men, those who own the 
plants, banks, corporations, mines 
and mills that profit from war. 
These few persons also own the 
media of communications in their 
countries, which they use for their 
own narrow interests. They have 
industrial resources and a host of 
mechanical voices to speak for 
them. But their power is more 
apparent than real. Their enter-

prises could not work, their ad-
ministrations rule, their armies 
fight?if the people united in their 
own interest. They are formid-
able only while they can deceive 
?and the deceit is wearing thin. 
They are not the irresistible 
stream which no obstacle can 
oppose. On the contrary, the 
people are the mighty river, they 
the puny obstacle! 
THE WISHES and demands of 
-L the vast majority of mankind 
cannot be swept away. They can 
be rendered ineffective only if each 
person stands alone, not if the 
people unite. That is why our 
crusade for peace, for the lives of 
the children, is the most potent 
force on earth. It can rip gun 
and bomb from the hands of those 
who poise them for war. It can 
turn the energy of the atom to the 
task of which scientists originally 
dreamed, to help man live, not to 
destroy him. 
"In unity there is strength." 
Everyone knows this old saying 
and it applies now more than 
ever. This is the point we must 
grasp, understand and use as a 
guide, all of us who want peace 
and security for the. children. We 
must act together. 
Today, the Women's Interna-
tional Democratic Federation 
offers every peaceful person and 
nation an excellent opportunity 
for united action. The Vienna 
meeting will result in making the 
world conscious of the urgent 
Approved For R 
need of protecting our children, 
and the way to do it. It is the 
duty of all to participate in and 
advance this movement. It should 
be the cause they hold most dear. 
THE CHINESE PEOPLE send 
-I- their warm greetings, with 
their delegation, to Vienna. It is 
our hope that the Women's Inter-
national Democratic Federation, in 
rendering mankind this great 
service, will achieve lofty success. 
We believe that children every-
where should receive all the 
blessings that nature provides, all 
the benefits the energies of man 
can mould. We want all children 
to grow up well-proportioned 
physically, their minds enriched 
by man's most valued creations. 
We want them to be full of 
confidence, fearing no state, no 
man, no aspect of the future. We 
want to free them from the threat 
of economic crisis and all other 
calamities, natural or man made. 
It is to the children that we 
hand on the banner of life, to 
carry along yet another stretch of 
man's long road of progress. We 
believe with all our hearts that, 
given a start, they will build an 
advanced society and culture in 
which every person will have the 
fullest life, the greatest joy, at the 
expense of no other. We want 
with all our hearts to give that 
opportunity to every child. We 
are striving for this, and believe 
all peoples will strive with us. 
That is why the Chinese people 
want and defend peace.

INNER MONGOLIA TODAY 
A' ER the time of Genghis 
Khan, the Mongolian national 
hero, the Mongolian people 
suffered under the exploitation of 
their feudal princes, later supple-
mented by that of Chinese mer-
chants and officials. From the 
eighteenth century on, all the 
territories they inhabited were 
administered as Chinese colonies. 
Then, a little over thirty years 
ago, what was formerly called 
Outer Mongolia became an in-
dependent national state, now the 
Mongolian People's Republic. The 
area commonly known as Inner 
Mongolia, which remains within

was organised as an autonomous 
region in 1947, after it had been 
freed by the People's Liberation 
Army. In 1949, when the People's 
Republic of China was estab-
lished, its self-governing status 
was officially confirmed. 
The Inner Mongolian Auto-
nomous Region of China was 
formed from lands that were 
formerly part of Heilungkiang, 
Liaohsi, jehol and Chahar pro-
vinces. Its total area is 231,600 
square miles. Its population is 
2,400,000, and consists not only of 
Mongolians but also of a large 
number of Hans (the majority 
nationality in China).

pastures, fields, forests, lakes and 
rivers, and all the great natural 
wealth of the region, are no 
longer bait for imperialistic greed 
or feudalistic exploitation. This 
wealth is now being developed by 
the Mongolians themselves for 
their own benefit. 
Autonomous Inner Mongolia 
was the earliest example of the 
application of the nationality 
policy of the new Chinese de-
mocracy. Now the Uighurs in 
Sinkiang (once known as Chinese 
Turkestan), the Tibetans in Tibet 
and Sikang and many less 
numerous nationalities also enjoy 
or are establishing autonomous 
status. By the second anniversary 
of the People's Republic of China, 
113 autonomous national districts, 
large and small, had been set up, 
as well as 165 united local govern-
ments of various nationalities 
living together in the same area. 
Before Liberation 
The liberation of Inner Mon-
golia, which came shortly after the 
defeat of Japan, literally saved its 
people from extinction. When it 
occurred, the Inner Mongolians 
were starving, sick and almost 
naked. The average man or 
woman was dressed only in a

ragged fur jacket, worn fur-side-
in during the winter and the other 
way round in summer. Many did 
not even possess such a "garment" 
but wrapped themselves as best 
they could in raw sheepskins, full 
of holes. The population was 
going down, herds had been 
catastrophically reduced and 
famine stalked the land. 
This condition, inherited from 
the centuries-old oppression of 
Inner Mongolia, was aggravated 
by the Japanese yoke which was 
imposed upon much of the area in 
1931, and almost the whole of it 
after 1937. The Japanese invaders 
stirred up trouble between 
Mongolian and Han, the better to 
exploit both. They ordered that 
all pastoral and mountain 
products be sold only to the 
"Manchukuo Commercial Com-
pany," which paid extremely 
low prices in kind and invariably 
procrastinated in bringing in even 
the commodities it promised. 
Over those years, the Japanese 
sshipped in vast amounts of opium 
and liquor, with which they 
systematically debauched the in-
habitants. Their rule was entirely 
lawless; they could and did kill or 
rob anyone at will. 
Liberation and Self-Rule 
The Anti-Japanese War, how-
ever, also advanced the liberation 
struggle in Inner Mongolia. The 
Chinese Communist Party, and the 
People's Liberation Army which 
began to operate in a section of it 
after 1938, brought mighty re-
inforcements and a reliable rally-
ing-point to the people's fight 
against oppression. Thus, im-
mediately after the Japanese sur-
rendered, the first steps to self-
government could be made. 
The Inner Mongolian Autonomy 
Movement was consolidated in 
Kalgan, Chahar province, in 1945. 
In 1946, a conference held at 
Chengteh, Jehol province, united 
the regional autonomy movements 
of eastern and western Inner 
Mongolia. In 1947, the Inner 
Mongolian People's Representative 
Conference was held at Ulanhot 
(formerly Wangyehmiao, Liaoning 
province) and on May 1 of the 
same year, the People's Govern-
ment of the Inner Mongolian Au-
EARCH-ARIZIL. 1952 
Approved For 
tonomous Region was set up, with 
Ulanfu as its Chairman. 
Under this people's government 
there are six meng or Leagues, 
comprising 32 ch'i or Banners 
(these are the traditional adminis-
trative divisions among the 
Mongolians). There are also three 
municipalities under the Leagues 
and seven hstien (counties) outside 
them in places with mixed Han 
and Mongolian populations. 
Since 1950, every one of these 
territorial divisions has held three 
or four local People's Representa-
tive Conferences, while democratic 
elections have been held in nearly 
2,000 kacha or village administra-
tive units. Delegates to the Peo-
ple's Representative Conference of 
different grades come from all 
walks of life?they include Mon-
golians and Hans, men and women, 
workers, peasants, shepherds and 
herdsmen, manufacturers, mer-
chants, intellectuals, lamas (Bud-
dhist priests) and princes. 
All organs of government in 
Inner Mongolia, from the highest 
to the lowest, have been set up as 
a result of such gatherings in 
which representatives of the most 
varied groups contributed to the

common task. At every level, the 
People's Government of Inner 
Mongolia has faithfully observed 
the nationality policy of the 
People's Republic of China. This 
has led to a new relationship 
between the nationalities them-
selves, based on equality, friend-
ship and cooperation. 
In military affairs, Inner Mon-
golia has organized strong cavalry 
groups which are part of the 
Chinese People's Liberation Army 
and fought with it to drive out the 
reactionary Kuomintang. To-
gether with the Inner Mongolian 
Public Security Force, the cavalry 
has destroyed numerous gangs of 
armed bandits that used to ravage 
the countryside, thus safeguarding 
the people's lives and property. 
All-Sided Improvement 
Since her liberation, Inner 
Mongolia has advanced in eco-
nomy, culture and health, setting 
her feet firmly on a road of im-
provement to which there are now 
no limits. 
The land reform, carried out in 
this region in 1947-48, has led to 
great increases in agricultural 
6 
production. At the call of the 
government, which helps them 
with loans and in technical ways, 
the Inner Mongolian peasants are 
organizing mutual aid teams, using 
more fertilizer, adopting new 
farm tools and methods arid 
working on large-scale installa-
tions to prevent both drought and 
flood. 
In animal husbandry, so im-
portant in Inner Mongolia, the 
new policy of free grazing, along 
with veterinary and breeding 
assistance by the authorities, has 
rapidly increased the quantity and 
improved the quality of livestock. 
Timber resources are being pre-
served and rehabilitated by active 
fire-prevention work and the con-
servation policy of reasonable 
felling, both supervised by a 
newly created Forestry Adminis-
tration. 
Trade, so long a weapon for the 
exploitation of the people, has 
been turned into a means of 
serving them. By April 1951, no 
less than 640,000 persons, or over 
a quarter of the total population 
of Inner Mongolia, were members 
of cooperatives of different kinds. 
Government trading companies, 
dealing with the cooperatives and 
individual producers, bought grain 
from the peasants and animal pro-
ducts from herders and hunters, 
supplying them with large quanti-
ties of goods of daily use in re-
turn. Private business has also 
been developing. In the main 
towns of the four eastern Leagues, 
capital invested in private in-
dustry tripled between 1948 and 
1950. 
As a result of the increased 
turnover of goods, price ratios 
have changed in favour of the 
peasants and herdsmen. In 1947, 
in the territory of the four eastern 
Leagues, the Inner Mongolian 
peasant could buy only three-
quarters of a bolt of cloth for the 
price he received for one ton of 
his rough grain (kaoliang or 
Chinese sorghum). Since 1949, he 
has been able to get 2.3 bolts, or 
thrice as much, for the same 
amount. The herdsman, who in 
1947 could get 11/2 bolts for thee 
price of a 500 lb. cow, could buy 
four bolts by 1950. This explains 
the constantly growing eagerness 
of the people to produce and the 
consequent phenomenal growth of 
their average purchasing power, 
which increased by 460 per cent 
between 1948 and 1950. 
The rising standard of living has 
also raised standards of education. 
By 1950, in the four eastern 
Leagues, no less than 61.7 per cent 
of school-age children were in 
primary schools. In Inner Mon-
golia as a whole, 80 per cent of 
children finishing primary school 
were going on to middle school 
instead of breaking off their 
studies. 
In health, the most striking 
event has been the virtual elimina-
tion of the dread bubonic plague, 
once a threat to every life. In 
1947, the death toll from plague 
was more than 13,000. In 1950, as 
a result of government leadership 
in all-out mobilization against the 
disease, there were only 23 cases 
and 17 deaths. In 1951, no cases 
of plague were reported. 
The fight against syphilis, his-
torically deep-rooted in the region,

has also begun on a large scale. 
Of special significance are mea-
sure,s to improve mother and child 
health. An example of what can 
be done in this respect has already 
been given by the Mongolian 
People's Republic, where syphilis 
and child mortality due to it have 
been virtually wiped out. 
Wealth for the People 
Over half of Inner Mongolia's 
231,600 square miles consist of 
rich grassland. The natural pas-
tures of Silingol and Hulunbuir 
are world famous, offering oppor-
tunities for a tremendous increase 
in the present number of cattle 
and sheep. The government's 
"free grazing" policy, and its aid 
to animal husbandry, are cal-
culated to achieve this increase in 
the shortest possible time. 
Aid to herdsmen and shepherds 
assumes the most varied forms. 
It includes preventative veterinary 
medicine, organized campaigns to 
kill wolves, mobilization of the 
people to cut and store grass for 
winter feeding, digging of wells 
where surface water is scarce and 
building of cattle-pens and sheep-
folds for shelter against snow-
storms and wild beasts. 
As a result of all these measures, 
Inner Mongolia's livestock are 
already more than twice as 
numerous as in 1945. In some 
districts they have increased three 
to four times. In the New Barga 
Right Banner each shepherd and 
cowherd has an average of 70 
animals. The pastures are alive 
with new prosperity. 
Inner Mongolia is very rich in 
salt, nitre and alkalis, which will 
someday form the source of a 
great chemical industry. The 
famous Ujumuchin Salt Flat, an 
unparalleled treasure, is seven 
miles long and two to three miles 
wide. Its large-grained salt, of 
unusually high sodium-chloride 
content, needs no special pro-
cessing before use. Fifty years

of Inner Mongolia.

ago, according to Manchu dynasty 
records, 200,000 cartloads of salt, 
of 600 lbs. each, were taken from 
Ujumuchin each year. Present 
annual output is on a high level, 
and the deposit shows no sign 
whatsoever of exhaustion. Pure 
salt here is really "common as 
mud." As recently as 1947, 2,000 
cartloads were used to build a 
defense wall against bandits, 
which is still there to see. The 
Silingol League has 60 large and 
small salt flats besides the one 
at Ujumuchin, which the local 
people call "The Mother" because 
of its seemingly endless abun-
dance. 
Dalai Lake (Dalainor), in the 
Hulunbuir grasslands, is full of 
fish. It is about 43 miles long and 
14 miles wide. The people say: 
"There are so many fish in 
Dalainor, their spines stick out of 
the water. They swim layer 
under layer from the surface clear 
to the bottom. If you stick a pole 
in the water, it doesn't topple 
over." One old fisherman told me 
that, in 1929, a single net set in the 
winter, when the ice had to be 
broken, caught 104 tons of fish, 
enough to fill five train carriages. 
Last year, one net brought in 40 
tons. The lake is now being 
fished to the extent of 4,000 to 
6,000 tons a year. 
Only nine miles north of Dalai 
Lake is the Chalainor coal mine 
which has been worked for some 
forty years. It has seams close to 
30 feet thick and reserves of 
many billions of tons. There is 
also a great deal of coal in the 
Silingol and Chowuta Leagues. 
Among minerals, preliminary 
surveys show an abundance of 
iron, copper, silver, gold, mica and 
quartz. 
On the great Khingan mountain 
range, there are vast tracts of 
virgin forest. Tall larches, grow-
ing thick as corn in a field, cover 
an area 270 miles long and 130 
miles wide between the south bank 
of the Argun river and the north 
bank of the upper Nonni river. 
Approved For Relea4 
The larches here stand 100 feet 
high; many go to 120 feet or even 
more. In all, Inner Mongolia has 
some 35,000 square miles of forest 
land, three times the area of 
Belgium. These mountains and 
forests are incomparable hunting 
grounds. They abound in wild 
fowl and valuable fur-bearing 
animals. 
Prosperity on the Way 
While the prairies and ranges of 
Inner Mongolia are well known, 
many do not realize its agricul-
tural potentialities. In fact, the 
eastern part of the region has 
considerable expanses of rich, pro-
ductive black soil. The conception 
of Inner Mongolia as a semi-desert 
is false. The idea that its popula-
tion is backward and destitute is 
out of date. The rich resources 
and brave, hardworking people of 
Inner Mongolia, once held down 
under the weight of reactionary 
rule are now coming into their 
own. 
The grassland is no longer de-
s9late. Millions of cattle graze on 
it and soon there will be tens of 
millions. Inner Mongolia is de-
veloping into a great source of 
meat and other pastoral products, 
of draught animals, of raw 
materials for industry for the 
whole of China. On steppe and 
farmland, her people are joyously 
producing and improving their 
own lives day by day. Her under-
ground riches are being mined. 
New cities, where mighty factories 
will rise, are already being built. 
A happy herdswoman shows off 
her new calf. With government 
aid, the number of livestock in 
Inner Mongolia has been raised to 
double the 1945 figure. (top)

Chinese Post Office Spreads Knowledge 
OUR Chinese People's Post 
Office is an organization quite 
different from the post offices of 
capitalist and colonial countries 
and from the post office of old 
China. It does not confine itself 
to the handling of mail, remit-
tances and other customary routine 
but, like all other branches of the 
People's Government, serves the 
most varied needs of the popula-
tion and national construction. In 
particular, it has become one of 
the greatest and most active dis-
seminators of education and cul-
ture throughout the country, 
especially in the vast rural areas 
where 80 per cent of our people 
live and work. 
In China, such work was first 
undertaken by the postal service 
of the old liberated areas, which 
was organized in 1938 and pursued 
its heroic career through the Anti-
Japanese War and the War of 
Liberation. The couriers of this 
service braved every hardship and 
often sacrificed their lives, to 
carry not only the correspondence 
of the People's Liberation Army 
but also newspapers and other 
literature. They helped to inform 
the people, give them the orienta-
tion necessary for confidence in 
victory, and, popularize the best 
achievements in production and 
defence. 
With the liberation of the entire 
Chinese mainland, the postal ser-
vice of the Kuomintang regime, 
which had been bent to the needs 
of foreign imperialism and the old 
reactionary ruling class, also 
passed into the hands of the people 
and was reorganized to serve 
them. By contrast with the old 
post office, which had been used 
by only a portion of the city 
population and hardly served the

countryside at all, the new 
People's Post Office has doubled 
both its length of routes and its 
number of offices and agencies, 
mainly in the rural areas. The 
chief emphasis in the tremen-
dous growth of the. past two 
years has been on service to the 
peasantry. By July 1951, rural 
postal routes had been extended 
by 328,309 miles and 41,901 new 
village post offices had been set 
up. 
Cooperation with the Press 
The combined resources of the 
former liberated areas postal 
system and that taken over from 
the Kuomintang, together with 
the vast extensions since libera-
tion, are thus available for cul-
tural and educational activity, as 
well as ordinary postal work. The 
main concentration is now on 
increasing circulation of. news-
papers, periodicals and books. 
Promotion of the press is parti-
cularly important because daily, 
weekly and monthly publications 
in China today not only carry 
reports on home and international 
affairs, but also spread knowledge 
of the principles on which our 
country is being built up and 
acquaint every locality with new 
methods of work and organization. 
Propagating science, improved 
tools for industry and agriculture 
and the best achievements of our 
literature, they have become in-
dispensable, as an aid in everyday 
tasks, to peasants, workers, 
government functionaries, educa-
tors and members of the pro-
fessions. 
Close cooperation between the 
People's Post Office and the press 
was initiated in December 1949, 
during the First National Postal 
Conference and the National Con-
vention of Newspaper Managers, 
both held in Peking. The de-
cisions then worked out have since 
been put into effect. One after 
the other, the post office has taken 
over the circulation of many big 
newspapers and magazines. The 
method followed has been to 
transfer trained staff members 
from the circulation departments 
of the papers themselves to the 
postal service. In the meantime, 
private sales agencies handling the 
papers also continue to operate, 
with post office aid and guidance. 
Millions of New Readers 
While newspapers have long 
existed in Chinese cities, hundreds 
of Chinese villages never saw 
them in the past. The first aim 
of the new system has therefore 
been to make sure that at least 
!ARCH-APRIL 1952 9

one newspaper is delivered re-
gularly to every village and ham-
let in the land. The results 
already reached in this campaign 
are remarkable. 
Newspaper circulation in China 
as a whole shot up nearly five 
times between the beginning of 
1950 and the end of 1951. The 
People's Daily of Peking, leading 
paper in the country, increased its 
distribution 31/2 times in eighteen 
months. 
An even more striking jump 
took place in the distribution of 
papers published especially for 
the rural areas. The Peasant 
Masses, printed in Chekiang pro-
vince, reported a 19-fold increase 
in readership in a single year. 
North Szechuan Peasants had to 
augment its printing facilities 
several times to cope with reader 
demand. Today, peasants con-
stitute 60 per cent of all newspaper 
readers in China, a situation no 
one would have conceived possible 
a few years ago. 
Growth of Reading Groups 
Let us take a closer look at how 
the post office operates in the cul-
tural field. 
In the first place, our postal 
workers are inspired with the 
conviction that circulating news-

papers, magazines and books is not 
merely a technical job, but that 
the task of satisfying the people's 
thirst for knowledge is both 
honourable and patriotic. 
With this attitude, postmen in 
the cities make every effort to 
deliver newspapers and period-
icals on time, collect subscriptions 
and secure renewals. In the 
countryside, they penetrate into 
the remotest places, to bring the 
press and all kinds of popular 
pamphlets to the peasants. 
Wherever they go, they persuade 
the less literate to organize into 
groups centering around some 
more literate person. These 
Postal workers fold and address

groups enter collective subscrip-
tions and, by gathering regularly 
for reading and discussion, keep 
their members abreast of the 
times. In Shensi province, for 
example, there are over 23,000 
reading groups with 320,000 pea-
sant members. Around Changsha, 
Hunan province, a single postman 
organized 1,294 rural reading 
groups while another set up 1,149 
groups in fifty villages within 25 
days. Rural postmen often them-
selves read and explain newspaper 
articles to the people at regular 
intervals, becoming recognized 
cultural leaders in the villages as 
a result. 
Reading groups also have 
their important place in urban 
surroundings. One branch post-
office in Kweilin, Kwangsi pro-
vince, organized 1,008 during the 
month of May 1951. Shanghai has 
904 reading groups, over 600 of 
them in factories. In Peking, 
almost every block and alley has 
its own group, in which people 
collect every other evening to hear 
and discuss what is in the papers.

with their intimate local contacts 
and knowledge, have evident 
advantages in undertaking a job 
of this kind and scope. But our 
post office does not seek to mono-
polize the work. On the contrary, 
it promotes, supplements and as-
sists many other types of effort. 
Postal workers give active help to 
the elected circulation agents for 
various publications in factories, 
schools, peasant associations, rural 
mutual-aid groups and coopera-
tives. These circulation agents in 
their turn, lead reading groups 
and clubs and frequently organize 
public meetings on current events, 
national production plans and 
other themes broached in the 
press. They also frequently act 
as correspondents on local affairs, 
collecting the suggestions and 
opinions of readers and forward-
ing them to the papers for pub-
lication or action. 
Cooperation between the post 
office and people's organizations 
of different kinds is growing with

Land reform, which has freed the 
peasants from landlord exploita-
tion and made them feel that they 
are masters of their own soil and 
country, has stimulated the desire 
for technical and political know-
ledge to a degree undreamed of in 
the past. Land reform workers 
and local government officials are 
enthusiastic supporters of the 
"cultural stations" set up by rural 
postal agencies, from which they 
pick up bundles of papers to dis-
tribute wherever they go. 
Mobilizing for Peace 
Through its work in the educa-
tional and cultural fields, the 
Chinese People's Post Office has 
contributed its share to making 
the 475 million people of China 
both informed and active in the 
affairs of their own country and 
the world. It is largely through 
increased circulation of news-
papers that the workers and 
peasants have consciously come to 
link their efforts to the major 
issues of our time, fight actively 
for increased production, con-
tribute to repel imperialist aggres-
sion in Korea and participate in 
the great international campaign 
for peace. A majority of our 
adult population has signed the 
Stockholm Appeal for the abolition 
of atomic weapons, the World 
Peace Council Appeal for a Five-
Power Peace Pact and the nation-
al protest against the rearmament 
of Japan. 
Proud of the results already 
achieved, the post office is con-
stantly striving to extend and 
perfect its press work. Postal 
workers are being educated in the 
political significance of circulation 
and promotion. The shift system 
of postmen has been readjusted so 
that all newspapers and period-
icals may be delivered promptly. 
Total courier lines are being re-
organized. Coordination with 
other circulating agencies, both 
public and private, is improving 
constantly. 
Our country and population are 
huge, presenting many hard prob-
lems to be overcome. But the 
beginning already made proves 
that no difficulties exist which 
cannot be conquered. With the 
experience gained, the Chinese 
People's Post Office will continue 
and expand its effort to bring 
knowledge to all the people.

A Village Teacher Fights Illiteracy 
FF4DUCATORS of Lushan county, 
  in the province of Honan, in 
eastern central China, met 
recently to elect a model school-
teacher. They chose Sung Shou-
ching, a woman teacher from 
Shenkou village. 
Shenkou is a mountain hamlet 
of less than sixty families. Up to 
now only very few of the people 
were literate. Sung Shou-ching 
went to live in Shenkou soon 
after she was married. She was 
the daughter of a primary school-
teacher and had had a few 
years of primary school herself. 
Having learned to read and write, 
she was regarded by the people of 
Shenkou as a "person of learning." 
That winter the People's Gov-
ernment appealed to villagers 
to organize winter schools to 
teach adults during the agricul-
tural slack season. Village leaders 
in Shenkou came to Sung Shou-
ching and asked her to take over 
the Women's Reading Class. 
The class started off very well 
with twenty girls attending every 
afternoon. But the older women 
in the village did not like their 
daughters and daughters-in-law 
going to school. They started 
making sarcastic remarks about 
"school-going women." Soon the 
girls began to skip their classes 
until finally no one turned up at 
all. 
When Miss Sung realized what 
was happening and why her class-
room was empty, she quickly 
called a meeting of the objecting 
old women and explained the 
advantages of literacy. She also 
visited them individually. One 
evening she heard the mother of 
one of her delinquent pupils 
grumbling: "The merchant is a 
scoundrel. I mistook a thousand 
yuan banknote for five hundred 
yuan. But when I gave it to him he 
didn't bat an eyelid." Miss Sung 
immediately said: "That's be-
cause you don't know how to read. 
If you did, you wouldn't have been 
cheated." 
Old Mrs. Chang had to agree. 
After this discussion she said she 
would never again stop her 
daughter from going to school. 
She even asked to be taught her-
self. In a few days she could read 
the words on banknotes, and tell 
the difference between 1,000 and 
500 yuan bills. 
News that old Mrs. Chang was 
learning to read spread very 
quickly. When the Women's 
Reading Class was resumed, at-
tendance grew larger. Of the 
fifty-six young and middle-aged 
women in the village, thirty-seven 
attended regularly. Women who 
had too many children to look 
after to attend classes regularly 
would often drop in to see the 
teacher. They would ask her to 
help them to write on tiles, which 
they used as slates. 
Every morning Miss Sung went 
from house to house helping her 
students to review the lessons of 
the day before. Over and over 
again she explained the meaning 
of new words. She held their in-
experienced hands, and guided 
them while they wrote. Very 
much moved, the women would 
say: "I'll never be able to look 
Teacher Sung in the face if I don't 
study hard." 
On moonlight nights small 
groups of women sat outdoors 
seeing who could write the great-
est number of characters. Before 
long they were able to memorize 
six characters a day instead of 
three as at the beginning. By the 
time the Spring Festival was over 
the eight best students could write 
three hundred characters without 
looking at any text, and could 
A MODEL TEACHER 
Many new teachers in China 
have been elected models by the 
people they serve. This picture 
shows Yu Yen-ping, a model teacher 
of Yaohua Villas, a suburb of 
Shanghai, with some of her pupils. 
Soon after liberation Miss Yu set 
up a people's winter school where 
she taught many peasants to read 
and write. She also trained a 
great number of new teachers. 
When in 1951 the Shanghai Peo-
ple's Government called for winter 
schooling for 100,000 peasants, Miss 
Yu organized 14 classes which 
were attended by 400 out of the 
.600 peasants in her district. It was 
for this that she was elected a 
'"model teacher."

read simple notices posted by the 
village government without any 
difficulty. 
During the Spring Festival the 
students of the Women's Reading 
Class could often be seen swing-
ing to the joyful music of the 
yangko dance. They even began 
to make speeches on current poli-
tical and military topics. This 
again shocked the old women. 
One day when Chiao Kwei-yung 
was returning from a yangko 
dance her mother-in-law, pretend-
ing to address a dog that was pass-
ing by, called angrily: "Wrig-
gling like that! Don't you have 
any sense of shame?" 
Upset by these remarks, Chiao 
Kwei-yung did not go to the read-
ing class that afternoon. When 
Miss Sung called in the evening to 
find out what was wrong, the 
mother-in-law said: "My daughter-
in-law spends all her time after 
school playing. She doesn't do 
any work at all. I'm not letting 
her go out any more." 
Miss Sung pacified her, saying: 
"Kwei-yung already knows 100 
characters. You would be mak-
ing a mistake not to let her go to 
school. But she is wrong not to 
do any housework. Please let me 
talk to her." 
Miss Sung advised Kwei-yung 
to avoid a quarrel with her moth-
er-in-law and to do more around 
the house so that the old lady 
would gradually be brought 
round. The advice proved to be 
good. A few days later the 
mother-in-law visited the teacher 
and said: "My daughter-in-law is 
working very hard now. She 
cooks, carries water, and has real-
ly changed for the better. I used 
to think: 'What do young people 
do when they get together except 
play around?' That's why I didn't 
want her to attend school. I see 
now that I was wrong." 
From then on Miss Sung im-
pressed on her students the neces-
sity of doing housework. She 
presided over meetings at which 
the girls criticized those .who 
showed signs of laziness. This 
brought peace to families where 
there had formerly been a lot of 
quarrelling. At the end of the 
Spring Festival many of them 
took hoes and went to work in the 
wheat fields. They organized 
mutual-aid teams and helped each 
other to learn more new charac-
ters as they worked. Now they 
are all making plans to enroll at 
a regular school. 
Teacher Sung Shou-ching 
earned the respect of all the 
villagers because she not only 
instructed the women in reading 
and writing but also taught them 
to improve their work while they 
studied. 
TRANSLATIONS 
IN CHINA 
SINCE the liberation, the 
people of China have had 
far greater access to the 
treasures of world culture than 
ever before. Translators are 
busier. Larger numbers of 
worthwhile foreign books are 
appearing in Chinese editions. 
They are sold at prices more 
accessible to readers than ever 
before, through a much larger 
network of bookshops. 
The most active demand has 
been for translations of Soviet 
literature and that of the People's 
Democracies. This is natural. 
Under the Kuomintang dictator-
ship, such books could hardly be 
obtained. The people of China, 
who have accomplished their 
own revolution and are engaged 
in the basic reconstruction of 
their country, are avidly inter-
ested in all aspects of similar 
experiences abroad. 
At the same time, however, 
classical literature and modern 
progressive works from many 
other countries are available in 
unprecedented abundance. 
Among novels on the shelves 
of the big bookshops, one finds 
new editions of Cervantes, 
Balzac, Tolstoy, George Eliot, 
Dickens, Flaubert, Victor Hugo, 
Mark Twain, Jack London, 
Remain Rolland, Theodore Drei-
ser, and Howard Fast. 
In drama and poetry, one can 
buy Dante, Shakespeare, Goethe, 
Schiller, Pushkin, Heine, Walt 
Whitman, Anton Chekhov, 
George Bernard Shaw. 
In literary criticism and re-
search, one can pick up Georg 
Brandes, Ralph Fox, George 
Thompson. 
In philosophy, apart from 
Marxist philosophy, various 
works by Francis Bacon, Hegel, 
Dietzgen and others have been 
republished, while more recent 
translations include American 
authors such as John Sommer-
ville. 
In scientific literature, there 
are new translations from Albert 
Einstein, J. D. Bernal, and 
others. The popular scientific 
books of H. G. Wells continue to 
find readers. The autobiography 
of Charles Darwin is on one of 
the new lists of works translated. 
Plans are now under way for 
a great many more translations. 
These will continue to bring to 
Chinese readers the best writing 
and thought of every land.

A typical tea garden in southeast China. 
CHINESE TEA 
And Those Who Grow It 
WU CHAO-NONG 
AS everyone knows, tea is a 
special product of China. 
When people talk of tea, they are 
naturally reminded of the country 
where it was first cultivated and 
used as a beverage. Reliable 
documents show that the Chinese 
people have been drinking tea for 
more than two thousand years. 
By the eighth century, the land 
of scores of counties, spreading 
over several provinces, was 
covered with tea shrubs. These 
areas ranged from the Huai and 
Yangtze river valleys of Central 
China to the Min river valley in 
Fukien on the southeast coast and 
the Pearl river region of China's 
southernmost province?Kwang-
tung. Tea was already being 
widely drunk throughout North 
China as well. Even at this early 
period, it had become an article of 
large-scale internal trade. 
Somewhat later, tea was intro-
duced into Tibet, Sinkiang, Inner 
and Outer Mongolia and Japan. 
To serve these markets, it was 
planted in more than five hundred 
counties in seventeen provinces. 
The number of peasants engaged 
in tea-growing grew to over ten 
million. 
After China's sea communica-
tion with Europe began, the 
tremendous output and high 
quality of her tea became known 
/4 
all over the world. Since the 
eighteenth century, the trade has 
been international. At its peak 
the export of Chinese black tea 
reached 180,000,000 lbs. a year; 
that of green tea over 21,000,000 
lbs. a year. 
How Tea Exports Declined 
Attracted by the profits to be 
made out of an article of such 
universal consumption, foreign 
capitalist interests began to open 
plantations in India, Ceylon, Java 
and Japan. All these enterprises 
began by importing tea seeds and 
tea-shrubs from China. They sent 
students to China to learn how to 
cultivate and process tea or invited 
Chinese experts to train their own 
personnel. Thus Chinese teas 
were ousted from the markets of 
colony-owning powers. 
By the end of the nineteenth 
century, when the reactionary 
Chinese government broke off 
relations with the Soviet Union 
after the October Revolution of 
1917, the vast Russian market was 
also temporarily cut off. So it 
came about that Chinese tea was 
largely displaced from the markets 
of the world. 
The Japanese war against China 
that began in 1937 finished the job 
by cutting off sea-borne trade 
completely. It also seriously dis-
rupted production. On the eve of 
liberation, the export of tea from 
China had fallen to a pitiable low. 
At all times in the past, the 
international trade in Chinese tea 
was controlled by the imperialists. 
They collaborated with Chinese 
compradores, brokers and usurers, 
whose interests were those of the 
feudal landlord class, to pay miser-
able prices to the actual producers. 
Even when China's trade in tea 
was at its highest, the tea peasants 
were robbed by super-exploitation 
and lived in misery. 
The continuous decline in tea 
exports deprived these peasants of 
the last crumbs of benefit from 
the trade, plunging them ever-
deeper into the abyss of poverty. 
It was in total disregard of their 
interests, as well as those of the 
national economy, that the Kuo-
mintang pursued its policy of 
alienating the Soviet Union, 
slamming the door in the face of 
the biggest customer for Chinese 
black and green tea. 
Agony of the Growers 
The peasants of the tea regions 
were as exploited and oppressed 
as other peasants in China?in 
some ways more so. The reac-
tionary regime piled heavy taxes 
and levies of all kinds on top of 
the extortions imposed by the 
landlords. There were times 
when the peasants' own income

from the tea they grew was 
pushed down to half their cost of 
production. In addition, the pea-
sants were swindled through short 
weight. A saying grew among 
them: "It's better to sell a load 
of fire-wood than a load of tea." 
The Japanese invasion com-
pleted the ruin of the previous 
decades. It not only wiped out 
sea-borne international trade but 
paralyzed the internal market 
as well. Destruction and dete-
rioration of inland communica-
tions made it impossible to get 
tea to the national minorities 
within China. The Japanese in-
vaders struck a direct economic 
blow at the Chinese product by 
dumping Japanese and Taiwan 
teas in the northern and north-
eastern provinces which they 
occupied. Tea manufactories 
closed down, throwing tens of 
thousands of workers out of em-
ployment. Tea-growing peasants 
began to chop down their shrubs 
to make room for grain crops. 
Production fell catastrophically. 
There was no significant re-
covery in the years immediately 
following the victory over Japan, 
when Kuomintang oppression and 
corruption reached their height 
and the people all over China 
fought to free themselves in the 
War of Liberation. 
Liberation Saves the Tea Trade 
The birth of the People's Re-
public of China brought hope and 
new life to every part of the 
country. With the victory over im-
perialism, feudalism and bureau-
cratic monopoly, the tea growers 
too stepped firmly on the road to 
recovery and real prosperity. Be-
cause of the importance of the tea 
trade to the national economy, 
and its bearing on the livelihood 
of millions of people, the Central 
People's Government took prompt 
and energetic steps to rehabilitate 
it. 
In December 1949, the govern-
ment established the China 
National Tea Corporation to direct 
the planting, processing and 
marketing of tea on a national 
scale. Relying on the organized

effort of the people, the corporation 
has since worked systematically 
and effectively to revive the tea 
trade, harmonizing the activities 
of state and private enterprises 
toward the common goal. The 
expanding cooperative movement 
has been one of the greatest factors 
in transforming the whole aspect 
of the tea areas. A considerable 
part of China's tea crop is now 
sold through co-ops, under clear-
cut procedures and for fair prices. 
China's friendly diplomatic 
relations with the Soviet Union 
and the People's Democracies now 
guarantee a constantly increasing 
foreign trade. Chinese tea grow-
ers have thus been freed of their 
century-old dependence on im-
perialist buyers and are no longer 
vulnerable to imperialist com-
petition or blockade. The policy 
of independence and equality 
pursued by the People's Govern-
ment has brought independence 
and equality to the tea producers 
and the entire trade. 
Inte rnal markets too are being 
rapidly restored. Better live-
lihood for all the people of China, 
including the national minorities, 
has led to a sharp upturn in home 
demand. Government promotion 
of interflow trade between town 
and country and between different 
parts of China has opened up 
long-clogged channels of trade. 
The stagnation of the tea industry 
has at last come to an end. 
New Growth Begins 
The problems that face the tea 
areas today are problems of 
growth. It is necessary to raise 
productivity, improve quality and 
increase the income of the 
peasants. Working toward these 
goals, the China National Tea 
Corporation is promoting the 
production of black tea through 
gradual mechanization. It also 
calls on all tea peasants to gather 
tea leaves when they are most 
tender and maintain high stand-
ards by careful sorting. 
The achievements of the China 
National Tea Corporation are 
summed up by the fact that its 
turnover in 1950 (including 
domestic sales) was equal to 250 
per cent of the entire value of 
black and green tea exports by 
both state agencies and private 
companies in the year 1949. In 
1951, its operations were running 
at a rate 28.6 per cent above those 
of 1950. 
The remarkable development of 
the production and sale of Chinese 
tea during the last two years pro-
vides concrete evidence of the 
improvements that have taken 
place in the national economy and 
in the techniques and administra-
tion of the tea industry. It de-
monstrates the faith the people 
have in the government and the 
ample reasons they have for such 
faith. 
New Life for Tea Peasants 
A major part in the recovery of 
the tea trade has been played by 
government loans, offered to tea 
peasants to overcome difficulties 
and increase production. Very

More Black Tea for Export 
Abroad, black tea is almost 
universally preferred to green. 
The present production of black 
tea in China is not sufficient to 
meet the demands of foreign trade. 
Many districts producing green 
tea of ordinary quality would be 
much better off if they switched 
to black. The government has 
already assisted several to make 
the change, with the result that 
the livelihood of the peasants has 
improved greatly. The greatest 
success has been achieved in the 
tea district of Pingshui. Chekiang 
province, where the tea peasants 
grow no other crop. 
-If it sells, tea is gold; if it 
doesn't, it's trash," the Pingshui 
p,ople used to say from bitter 
experience. Now the processing 
of black tea has assured them a 
market at all times. The govern-
ment is carrying on an educational 
campaign in numerous places. 
explaining to the peasants how 
black tea can increase their 
earnings. Administrative and 
technical personnel have been 
sent out into the countryside to 
organize workshops for the 
primary processing of black tea, 
to introduce hand roller machines 
and to promote the collective 
methods in processing. 
The shift to black tea in Ping-
shin county has brought the

peasants an average profit equiva-
lent to the value of five hundred-
weights of rice for each hundred-
weight of tea, in many cases 
higher. It is now commonly said 
among the peasants that while 
the land reform enabled them to 
get up from their knees politically, 
black tea has done so econo-
mically. "Since the People's 
Government came, we haven't 
worried about our everyday life," 
remarked one old man who works 
at processing black tea. "In all 
my sixty years the highest price 
I remember is five hundred-
weights of rice for a hundred-
weight of tea. This year it was 
eight or nine. I'll be able to get 
some new clothes for the first time 
in five years." 
Income Rises; Life Improves 
In Chekiang province it used to 
take three pounds of tea to buy a 
pound of silk, now the prices are 
equal. In Hoshan, northern 
Anhwei province, profits of tea 
growers in 1951 were six or seven 
times greater than in 1946. 
Once subject to cold and hunger, 
most tea peasants now have 
plenty of vegetables, salt and fats 
to go with their rice. They eat 
fish and meat on occasion. They 
are wearing better clothes and 
sleep under new quilts. 
The general economic enlivening 
of the tea areas can be seen at the 
regular town and country fairs. 
Anhua district, Hunan province, 
sold only 2.6 million pounds of tea 
in 1949. In 1950 the marketed 
output had risen fivefold to 13 
million pounds. 
The number of primary tea 
processing workshops increased 
from ten in 1946 to 33 in 1951. 
People unemployed before libera-
tion are now busy as tea sorters 
and skilled workers. 
Here is one eloquent fact. 
During the Spring Festival in 1949, 
Anhua butchers slaughtered five 
pigs and were unable to sell all 
the meat. For the Mid-Autumn 
Festival in 1950, they kill ed 40 
pigs and had to turn some buyers 
away.

Expert sorting ensures high grade tca for the market. 
Soochow peasants who grow 
jasmine and other fragrant blos-
soms used in tea fla vouring have 
seen a new demand spring up for 
their product. In 1950, many built 
new houses for themselves. Last 
year they built modern hothouses 
for all-weather cuttivation. The 
same thing is happening among 
flower growers in Nanking. 
The economic progress of the 
tea peasants has awakened them 
politically. They believe in the 
future, and are organizing collec-
tive production groups. They 
have set up workshops to make 
machines for themselves, machines

capacity of the government-
operated China National Petro-
leum Corporation is 150 per cent 
over its pre-liberation peak. The 
capacity of its oil warehouses has 
likewise grown by 90 per cent. 
Rapidly Growing Facilities 
Substantial forward steps have 
been made in oil processing, no-
tably in the synthetic oil industry. 
In the Northeast, high-octane 
gasoline used by our aviation is 
being produced from coal. The 
Japanese, during their long oc-
cupation, made little headway in 
this direction. 
The Northeast also abounds in 
oil-bearing shales. Oil distilled 
from this source now exceed .s by 
30 per cent the level of production 
under Japanese rule. Moreover, 
the quality of the product is im-
proved. 
These advances have been 
achieved through the rehabilita-
tion of old processing units and 
the construction of new ones. 
The plant at Fushun, which was 
almost totally destroyed by the 
Japanese and the Kuomintang, 
has been fully rebuilt. Installa-
tions erected since the liberation 
of the region include the synthetic 
gasoline plant described above, a 
thermal cracking plant to process 
oil-bearing minerals, a polymer-
ization plant which produces 
high-quality gasoline from gas 
released in the cracking plant, 
and a high-pressure hydrogena-
tion plant. 
Refining facilities in northwest 
China with its five oil regions 
(northern Shensi, western Kansu, 
central Kansu, the Hohsi corridor 
and Sinkiang) have also been sub-
stantially extended. Petroleum 
development is one of the factors 
that will soon turn the once poor 
-ARCH-APRIL 1952 
and desolate expanses of the 
northwest into a major industrial 
area. 
As in other phases of the con-
struction of new China, the bene-
fits of increased production in the 
oil industry have been passed on 
to the people. By an order of the 
Ministry of Trade issued Decem-
ber 13, 1951, prices of petroleum 
products to consumers throughout 
the country were reduced by 10 
per cent. There could be no bet-
ter proof of how much progress 
we have made in developing our 
oil resources and foiling the im-
perialist embargo which, among 
its other objectives, has aimed to 
starve us of oil. 
Roots of Success 
In the short period since the 
liberation, China's oil industry 
has progressed more than in the 
previous half century. This is 
because the political and social 
freeing of the Chinese people has 
also unchained the productive 
forces of our country. 
The first drillings in Yenchang 
oil field in north Shensi province, 
for example, were made some 60 
years ago. But practically no-
thing happened afterwards be-
cause of the influx of foreign oil. 
It was only when the People's 
Army made the region its base 
that the field began producing 
regularly?despite the Kuomin-
tang blockade which made it im-
possible to restore or supplement 
the antiquated equipment. 
During the Anti-Japanese War, 
the Kuomintang spent large sums 
to equip the China National Petro-
leum Corporation's field in Kansu. 
But after V-J day its masters, the

American monopolies, inhibited 
the growth that might otherwise 
have taken place. Clearly, China 
could never develop her oil indus-
try, or any other, while her posi-
tion remained semi-colonial. 
Today, by contrast, China has 
become truly independent and 
enjoys truly friendly, truly equal 
relations with the U.S.S.R. and 
People's Democracies, which are 
interested in helping us develop, 
not in holding us back, for any-
one's private profit. From these 
sources, we have obtained all ma-
terials that cannot yet be pro-
duced at home. Soviet specialists 
have put their experiences freely 
at the disposal of Chinese oil 
technicians and workers, whose 
labour enthusiasm is high because 
they are working for themselves 
and the whole people. The result 
is a degree of initiative and a 
tempo of construction never seen 
in our country before. 
The thermal cracking plant in 
the Northeast was built in only 
four months. The synthetic gaso-
line plant was completed in half 
a year. Drilling and electrical 
apparatus for the oil fields and 
practically all machinery needed 
for refineries are now made in 
China. Efficiency has increased 
in every department of oil pro-
duction, processing, storage and 
transportation. 
in brief, the long stagnation of 
China's oil development has come 
to an end. Oil will not form a 
"gap" in our industrialization as 
the imperialists predicted. On 
the contrary, we are already 
building a petroleum, industry 
worthy of our great country.

State Protects Mother and Child 
Today the health, welfare and 
education of all Chinese children 
Lecome a major concern of 
our society and state. The Com-
mon Programme of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative 
Conference, the basic policy laid 
do'.vri for the People's Republic of 
China when it was esiablished on 
(kdober 1, 1949, states in Article 
ihat "public health work and 
id( dicai work shall be promoted 
arni attention shall be paid to the 
health of mothers. infants and 
children." 
The new Marriage Law pro-
mulgated by the People's Govern-
ment in 1950 provides protection 
to both mother and cliild. 
The Labour Insurance Regula-
tions introduced on May 1, 1951 
give women workers 56-days' 
maternity leave with full pay. 
make it illegal to dismiss pregnant 
workers and require all factories 
with over 500 workers to set up 
thf.ir own medical service. 
These laws have not remained 
on paper as was the case wi 
many in the past. The People's 
Government is implementing them 
actively and has allocated large 
budgets for the purpose. Women 
and minors in industry are assured 
equal pay for equal work. Many 
thousands of day nurseries take 
care of the children of working 
it 'tilers in town and country. 
Mother and child health depart-
ments have been set up in the 
national Ministry of Health and in 
regional and provincial health 
bureaus. In district health 
centres, separate sections or 
specially assigned personnel take 
charge of the work. Such direct 
government responsibility for 
mother and child care has no 
precedent in Chinese history. 
Striking Figures 
An idea of the scope of this 
activity may be gained from the 
fact that 744 woman and child 
health stations and 9,464 maternity 
service stations have been set up

in towns, industrial suburbs, rural 
districts, sub-districts and villages. 
China now has 156 children's 
hospitals. There are many special 
gynecological and obstel,rical 
hospitals, child health sanatoria 
and mother and child health 
institutes. The All-China Federa-
tion of Democratic Women and 
the cooperative movement have 
set up numerous health stations of 
their own in this field. 
In the past two years, China 
has trained 4,340 nursery work-
ers, 3,743 woman and child care 
workers (not including Southwest 
China and Inner Mongolia), 458 
gynecologists and many other 
categories of personnel. A Wo-
man and Child Health Experi-
mental College with training 
facilities has been set up by the 
Ministry of Health. The Peking 
University Medical College has 
organized a department for mother 
and child health studies. An 
entirely new Woman and Child 
Health College has been opened 
in Mukden. In all medical 
schools, the number of students 
specializing in gynecology, obstet-
rics and pediatrics has increased. 
Local stations are re-training 
old-fashioned midwives on a large 
scale. Manuals on pre-natal 
hygiene and child care, written 
for both mothers and practition-
ers, have been issued in hundreds 
of thousands of copies?and 
posters in millions. Millions of 
people have also seen filmstrips 
and attended illustrated talks on 
the subject. As a result of these 
widespread and varied activities, 
mother and child mortality has 
fallen greatly. In Hoche district, 
Pingyuan province, the death rate 
from infant tetanus has fallen 
from 42 per cent to 1 per cent. 
In the sphere of preventive 
medicine, no less than 119,137,715 
children have been vaccinated 
against smallpox in the past two 
years. Nearly a million children 
have been inoculated with BCG 
serum against tuberculosis, as 
well as against diphtheria and 
whooping cough. On Children's 
Day, June 1, 1951, free medical 
examinations were given to chil-
dren under seven years old in all 
cities of China. 
Effects of Land Reform 
The most striking change in the 
life of the Chinese people has 
been the land reform, already 
completed in an area containing 
over 300 million rural inhabitants. 
Landlord estates were divided 
among individual peasants re-
gardless of sex or age. This gave 
reality to the new status of wo-
men. They are now equal 
citizens, instead of pieces of pro-
perty to be transferred from the 
father's homestead to the hus-

band's or prey to the lusts of the 
all-powerful landlord. 
An idea of what chains have 
been struck off our women by the 
land reform may be gained from 
the motion picture "The White-
haired Girl." Many people out-
side our country have already 
seen this film, which, with the 
opera of the same name, is based 
on a true incident of our War of 
Liberation. It exposes not only 
the material greed of the landlords 
but also their constant sexual ag-
gression against the wives and 
daughters of the peasants who 
were totally dependent on their 
mercies and dared not resist. 
Sitting among people viewing 
"The White-haired Girl" in China, 
one often hears the angry ex-
clamations of women in the audi-
ence when these past humilia-
tions, about which the old ruling 
classes maintained absolute 
silence, are stripped bare on stage 
and screen. Along with the land 
reform, the new Marriage Law of 
China is cleaning the whole coun-
try of slave-trade in women, of 
servitude of girls before marriage, 
of the keeping of handmaids and 
of the former unlimited masculine 
dictatorship in matters of mar-
riage and divorce. Our women 
today are independent persons, 
active in every field. All ele-
ments of discrimination against 
women workers, whether in 
wages or in eligibility for promo-
tion, are being eliminated from 
Chinese life.

All over the country, peasants are 
busy building schoolhouses, mak-
ing classroom furniture and be-
sieging county governments with 
requests for teachers. 
In northern Szechuan, the num-
ber o primary schools doubled 
in the spring of 1951 as compared 
to I he previous term. This area 
alone now has 15,622 primary 
H;cliools, over 13,900 of which have 
been set up by the peasants them-
selves. In eastern Szechuan. 
2,0110 village schools were set up 
bet ween February and April last 
year. Ho Ken, a former poor

ly, "When I was a child, I starved 
and froze. Where could I get

have to worry about food and 
clothes any more. I have bought 
a cow and a plough. and I still 
have some money left over..... 
How better to spend it than for 
a school?" 
In rural schools in China, the 
enrolment of poor peasant and 
farm labourers' children has risen 
immensely. The educational 
policy of the People's Govern-
ment works actively to increase 
the proportion. Country children 
who in the past could look for-
ward only to the killing toil and 
prospectless existence which 
made old men and women of their 
parents by the time they reached 
their forties are now full of ambi-
tions to which only their own 
ability can set a limit. They 
dream of becoming tractor driv-
ers, engineers, scientists, poets, 
aviators?of heroic deeds in de-
fence of our new democratic 
China which has opened such 
prospects to all. They hate the 
past and its dark memories and 
are a force for progress that can-
not be underestimated. 
The Young Pioneers organiza-
tion of children between the ages 
of nine and fourteen was founded 
only two years ago. It already 
has a membership of 2,400,000. 
No one can pass by these young-
sters, with their white blouses and 
red scarves, without admiring the 
clear-eyed future masters of the 
nation. In the Pioneer organiza-
tion and out of it, boys and girls 
strive eagerly to be strong in 
body and to know everything?
yet their striving has nothing to 
do with thoughts of personal 
wealth or of dominating others. 
The dreams in their heads are of 
transforming our country and 
serving our people, of living in 
friendly comradeship with the 
common people of all lands. 
Wherever one goes, one hears 
their fresh voices raised in song. 
The extent of the educational 
effort of the People's Government 
for China's children can be judged 
from the fact that in 1951. which 
was only the second year of its 
foundation, 110 million copies of 
new textbooks were printed. The 
number of elementary schools is 
already 66 per cent above that of 
1946.

construction. The liberation of 
Chinese women has enabled them 
to take their proper place in this 
great effort of the whole people. 
Our industries now have 650,000 
women workers. Thousands are

The whole country knows the

worker in a Dairen plant who lost 
an arm while courageously avert-
ing an explosion that threatened 
the whole factory, has become a 
national example of readiness to 
sacrifice for the common good. 
Regarded as a model by all Chi-

studying in a party school. In 
old China, only a few years ago, 
Chao Kuei-lan was a very poor

lain in costumes and moods be-
longing to a long-buried past? 
Under the patronage of the later 
Manchu court, these designs had 
lost all movement in a maze of 
ornamentation. Later they were 
turned out automatically for 
foreign taste in "chinoiseries.' 
The Chinese themselves became 
heartily tired of most of them. 
When people made presents to 
each other, they preferred to give 
fruits. sweetmeats or other things. 
How the Change Began 
It was only after liberation that 
Peking's handicrafts began to 
awaken from this long lethargy. 
The people's authorities gave new 
encouragement to a group of 
Tsinghua university professors 
v:ho had been engaged for some 
time in drawing designs based on 
ancient Chinese bronzes and 
porcelains, and had asked forward-
looking master craftsmen to adapt 
them in cloisonn?In June 1950, 
the government set up the state-
owned Peking Handicraft Com-
pany. It engaged these professors 
and a group of artists to produce 
designs blending the vigorous 
hest of ancient Chinese art 
with the atmosphere of present 
day China. 
At first, the venture met with 
many difficulties. Exporters 
fused to handle the new products, 
maintaining that their customers 
in America, Britain and other 
capitalist countries would only 
buy the designs they associated 
with China, such as dragons and 
frail languishing women. The 
handicraft workers had been 
mechanically producing the old 
ornate things for generations; to 
change meant loss of time, and 
besides they were not convinced 
that it would work out. 
To break through these ob-
stacles, the company arranged 
talks for the craftsmen at which 
the tradition of Chinese art and 
reasons for their degeneration 
were discussed. The craftsmen 
were urged to turn back to original 
sources and develop them in a 
more healthy direction. Ample 
loans were made available to the 
workshops. The handicraft com-
pany itself placed large orders for 
articles of new design. It agreed 
to pay for all losses incurred in 
changing over and experimenta-
tion. 
In the spring of 1951 the Ameri-
can embargo sent the handicraft 
business looking for new markets. 
The first efforts were focussed on 
stimulating the internal market. 
To get the Chinese consumer to 
buy its goods, the company dis-
covered, it was necessary to pro-
duce articles in tune with popular 
sentiment since liberation. The

same thing applies to China's new 
international contacts. Both the 
government and the people's 
organizations were sending repre-
sentatives to friendly countries. 
These needed gifts to take with 
them which would give people 
abroad some idea of the new spirit 
in China. 
Peking craftsmen began to carve 
statuettes of China's new heroes 
and heroines who had laid down 
their lives for their country. Their 
products became more alive and 
their own enthusiasm mounted. 
They kept the artists busy by 
asking for more and more designs. 
Motifs from Tunhuang 
Then in the spring of 1951, a 
new stimulus appeared. More 
than a thousand hand-painted re-
productions of ancient murals 
from the Tunhuang caves in Kansu 
province were shown for the first 
time in Peking. The exhibition 
caused a sensation. Everybody 
talked about it. Lectures were 
given on the origin and history of 
the works shown. Day after day, 
artists went with their easels and 
paints to copy the pictures. This 
exhibition had a tremendous in-
fluence on handicrafts too. 
Tunhuang is a small town on 
the edge of the Gobi desert. Once 
an important stage on the post 
road linking China with Iran, 
India, Greece and Rome, it 
possesses great cultural monu-
ments in the shape of 469 caves 
decorated with Buddhist religious 
paintings and frescoes com-
missioned by devout passersby 
who prayed for good fortune in 
their business and their travels. 
The oldest of these paintings 
dates back to 366 A.D., while a few 
were added as late as the 
eighteenth century. The best of 
them range from primitive direct-
ness in the early period to rich 
colour and composition in the 
T'ang Dynasty (618-906 A.D.). 
While the main themes are 
religious, the murals also show the 
people of each period farming, 
fighting, hunting and enjoying 
themselves. The cornices, friezes, 
columns and high ceilings of each 
cave are filled with wonderfully 
decorative geometric designs. 
!ARCH-APRIL 1952 
Most of the Chinese public had 
little previous knowledge of this 
treasurehouse of art belonging to 
their own country. When the 
Peking Handicraft Company took 
the local craftsmen to see the ex-
hibition they' were filled with 
amazement by the perfection of 
the geometric designs and the 
brilliance of the chromatic 
schemes. They visited the ex-
hibit again and again. They 
eagerly attended a lecture specially 
arranged for them and asked the 
artists who had done the repro-
ductions to provide them with 
designs. These designs have now 
appeared on trays, vases, lamps, 
?powder boxes, tea containers and 
rugs. The secretary of the Peking 
Handicraft Company says, "Our 
workers are like people who have 
been on the same tiresome diet 
for years and suddenly find new, 
delicious food." 
To raise the level of handicrafts 
in other parts of China, the new 
Peking products have been sent to 
big trade exhibitions held in many 
large cities. Abroad, they have 
been shown in the Soviet Union, 
in Switzerland, Sweden, Poland, 
Denmark and Norway. Every-
where they have been admired for 
the originality of their design and 
excellence of their workmanship. 
Combining old skills with living 
designs, they are bound to become 
known throughout the world. 
For the first 
time in hund-
reds of years, 
new designs 
are appearing

AUTOMOBILES AND TRACTORS: 
HOME PRODUCED 
T the great North China Trade 
Exhibition in Tientsin, late 
In 1951, people crowded around 
the first automobile and tractor 
made entirely in China. 
The car was one of several 
.ilready manufactured in Tientsin. 
Tractors are being produced by 
workers in Taiyuan, Shansi pro-
vince. The appearance of both 
was epoch-making, a herald of the 
riiture in Chinese national in-
lustry, transport and agriculture. 
Among the thousands of in-
iustrial products and great num-
i_ers of machines dispiayed in the 
xhibition were over a hundred 
erns of major importance which 
china was never able to make 
hefore liberation. They included 
ai-cutting machinery for our 
!nines, automatic universal pre-
cision lathes and a variety of other 
modern machine tools. Among 
regional "firsts" on display were 
-1)O-h.p. diesel engines to provide 
iiower wherever needed in town 
And country, electric trolley buses 
and other items. 
The instruments of production 
(nd transport exhibited in Tien-
;.sin had all been macie during the 
oeriod of rehabilitation of Chinese 
,.conomy. Large-scale industri-
alization of the country has still to 
hegin. Yet what has already been 
achieved proved to every patriotic 
,-isitor and foreign well-wisher 
that China can make anything 
that she requires. It was also 
testimony that the American-
inspired embargo on machine 
exports to China, designed to 
cripple our industry, has on the 
contrary stimulated it. In suc-
cessfully solving problems posed 
by the embargo, Chinese industry 
has made a faster leap forward in 
its range of output than might 
otherwise have been the case. 
Raw Material Wealth 
As with productive equipment, 
so with raw materials. The 
variety of North China's natural 
resources, and of the uses to which 
they are already being put, came 
through vividly at the exhibition. 
To cite a few examples, there 
were specimens of coal from 
Shansi, Hopei, Suiyuan, Pingyuan, 
and Chahar; iron ore from Chahar, 
Hopei, Suiyuan, Pingyuan and 
Shansi; sulphur from every pro-
vince in the region; gold from 
Hopei, Shansi, Suiyuan and Inner 
Mongolia. North China supplies 
gypsum to the whole country and 
its asbestos, with fibres up to 21/2 
inches long, is of very good 
quality. 
Plants whose possiblities were 
hitherto ignored are now being 
put to industrial use. Paper 
manufactured from "chih chi 
tsao," a kind of wild grass that 
grows along the Yellow river and 
was previously used only to make 
brooms, is more resistant to fold-
ing and crushing than American 
banknote paper. Strong gunny 
sacks are being made of another 
domestic fibre that was burned for 
firewood in the past. Last spring, 
the rubber-producing grass, kok-
sagyz, was experimentally planted 
in Suiyuan province, with initially 
favourable results. 
While it has long been known 
that North China has rich re-
sources, many of the raw materials 
shown were an eye-opener to 
the visitors. Peasants, workers, 
government economic personnel 
and private businessmen all 
learned a great deal from the 
Tientsin exhibition. 
More than 20,000 white-ker-
chiefed peasants from the north 
China countryside, chosen by their 
fellow-villagers to attend the 
exhibition, stayed for days and 
sometimes weeks in the homes of 
Tientsin residents. The peasants 
had all experienced tremendous 
improvement in their own lives as 
a result of liberation and land 
reform, but this was the first time 
they were able to see how the 
whole nation is moving forward. 
They saw their own future as they 
crowded avidly around the 
generators for village power and 
light stations (some of them had 
never even seen an electric light 
before), the tractors and combines 
and the improved animal-drawn 
agricultural implements, already 
available in quantity, that raise

the productivity of farm labour 
several times. They realized their 
own part in the country's progress 
as they viewed various industrial 
products made out of the crops of 
their own fields. In the models of 
hydraulic schemes which will 
soon solve major flood, drought 
and irrigation problems, they saw 
that even the "unconquerable" 
forces of nature can be bent to the 
control of man. 
Industry Meets Agriculture 
The benefits of industry are 
already available to peasants on a 
scale immeasurably greater than 
ever before in Chinese history. 
Fertilizers are cheap. So are 
many agricultural machines. 'That 
something new is happening in 
China is plain from the remark 
of one peasant who lingered 
around a mechanical oil press: 
"It does the work of the four mules 
we use for the job in our village 
?and it costs a lot less." 
Peasants, particularly those or-
ganized in mutual-aid teams and 
able to make group-purchases, 
placed many orders for new 
equipment at the exhibition. By 
invitation, they visited agricul-
tural implement factories in Tien-
tsin and gave their suggestions to 
engineers and workers as to what

first jeep made 
in Tientsin. 
These workers

ducing a

model as well. 
needed to be made, and what 
could be done better. 
At other factories which they 
inspected, the peasants watched 
spellbound as great looms turned 
out cloth like magic?unlike the 
laborious treadle looms of the 
villages. They made many worker 
friends and constantly sought ex-
planations from them of all they 
had seen. 
Confessed one peasant repre-
sentative: "We used to ask, 
'why is the working class supposed 
to be the leader?' We peasants 
thought we could make everything 
we were likely to need except 
salt. We grew our own food, 
spun and wove our own cotton, 
produced our own vegetable oil 
for cooking and lamps. But now 
we see a much better future ahead 
of us and we can't get there 
behind a wooden plough and an 
ox. However hard we try, we 
can't grow telephones and electric 
lights." 
What Workers Have Achieved 
The exhibition showed clearly 
that the advance of new China, 
now that ancient oppressions have 
been removed, takes place through 
the combination of science, collec-
tive effort and a forward-looking 
outlook. 
In the pavilion devoted to 
industrial improvements, many 
photographs and charts recorded 
the changes the New Democracy 
has brought about in the workers' 
lives. All the humiliating prac-
tices which symbolized the total 
absence of workers' rights in the 
old society, such as the searching 
of workers by factory guards 
before they went home, have 
now been abolished. Workers 
in government-owned enterprises 
elect their own representatives to 
China's first tractor made in Tai-
yuan, Shansi province, was a centre 
of attraction for peasant and other 
visitors to the exhibition.

Management Councils, which 
are in charge of administration, 
production and wages. In private 
factories, their delegates sit on 
1.abour-Capital Consultative Con-
ferences which discuss improved 
production 'and find solutions for 
d isputes. 
How workers' suggestions and 
inventions are encouraged, and 
how Indus development bene-
fits from this, was graphically 
illustrated. A very old Chinese 
proverb says that "three shoe-
makers make a sage." The 
workers of China, discarding craft 
"sc,crets" and democratically com-
bining their rich experience to 
lm prove production and ration-
alize management, have devised 
many new methods that no sage 
ever thought of. 
When the Tientsin Automobile 
Assembly Plant decided to make 
its first car, instead of just putting 
cars together, it was found that 
many tools were lacking. The 
workers talked this over, and im-
provised what was needed out of 
old machines and spare parts. 
Engine castings presented a parti-
cularly difficult problem, but after 
initial failures this too was solved. 
Altogether, in Tientsin, no less 
than 8.455 workers' suggestions 
were made in the first seven 
months of 1951. A large part of 
them were adopted with benefits 
to their initiators in the form of 
special payments, and to the 
nation through increased output. 
New Ways in Farming 
In agriculture too, science and 
democratic joint effort are work-
ing remarkable transformations. 
Chinese peasants used to say: 
"You don't need skill in farming; 
all you need is sweat." 
The agricultural improvement 
pavilion at the North China Trade 
Exhibition refuted such ideas. It 
was not sweat but science that 
produced the enormous melons 
and cabbages, the heavy-headed, 
large-grained wheat, the 900-1b. 
pigs that were displayed there. 
Peasant delegates 
carefully examine 
one of the new 
agricultural Im-
plements Chinese 
Industry is sup-
plying, In large 
numbers, to the 
villages. 
Having witnessed these results, 
achieved sometimes on state 
farms, sometimes by the most 
forward-looking rural mutual-aid 
groups and individual owner-
cultivators, the peasants flocked 
with new interest to see the de-
monstrations of ploughs that could 
cut deeper into the soil, seed 
selection procedures, new ferti-
lizers and sprayers to destroy 
various pests. 
Devoting its utmost effort to 
the increase of agricultural yield 
per acre, the government has pub-
licized the example of the 49-
year old peasant Chu Yao-li, who 
reached a cotton yield of 7,296 lbs. 
an acre, or 222 lbs. more than his 
last year's record. Chu Yao-li 
came to the exhibition himself, 
was received as an honoured 
guest, and gave explanations of 
his methods. If the average cot-
ton productivity in North China 
could be raised to even one-fifth 
of Chu's yield, the total present 
harvest would be more than 
doubled. No wonder Chu has 
become a national figure. 
The basis for more widespread 
application of science and better 
tools in farming has been laid by 
organizing the peasants for joint 
work. Mutual-aid teams have 
already played a tremendous part 
in rehabilitating North China's 
agriculture from the ruins of war, 
in bringing cereal crops back to 
the pre-war level and cotton out-
put to 55 per cent above pre-war. 
They have also facilitated repair 
of dykes and irrigation ditches 
and the battle against locusts. 
Benefits of Cooperation 
Experience, as tabulated in 
figures at the exhibition, indicates 
that mutual-aid teams generally 
get the best harvests; buy more 
animals, build better barns, use 
better tools, solve puzzling prob-
lems more easily through com-
mon discussion. Moreover, they 
keep in closer touch with new 
methods, new events and new 
markets through reading-groups 
which regularly peruse news-
papers and pamphlets. About 55 
per cent of all North China pea-
sants are already members of 
mutual-aid teams, and in some 
counties as many as 90 per cent 
have joined.

The mutual-aid team is a sea-
sonal or more lasting, cooperative 
for the purpose of work only; the 
land, buildings and most tools 
remain individually owned. Now, 
however, a new form of organiza-
tion, the Agricultural Production 
Cooperative, has begun to appear. 
In this higher form, land as well 
as labour is pooled. 
In the old days, China's pea-
sants were nameless. The new 
democracy has produced tens of 
thousands of peasant leaders 
whose fame has spread far and 
wide. Li Shun-ta of Shansi pro-
vince, who attended the Tientsin 
exhibition, became a national hero 
by organizing a model mutual-aid 
group which issues challenges to 
others all over our vast country. 
Chia Lan-hu of Hopei province 
enlisted his village in a coopera-
tive afforestation effort, planting 
450,000 trees on waste land and 
protecting the fields of the people 
from sandstorms. Bewhiskered 
56-year-old Ma Yi-chien organized 
another cooperatiVe which irri-
gated and flushed out large tracts 
of alkaline farmland, increasing 
its yield tremendously. 
Not only is China's country-
side producing more, but the 
cultivators are much better off. 
Price relationships are becoming 
more favourable to the peasants. 
Before liberation, it took the price 
of 31/2 tou (a tou is 13.3 lbs.) of 
wheat to buy an ordinary iron 
ploughshare. Now one can buy 
three ploughshares for the price 
of one tou of wheat. 
Life-Giving Trade 
All underestimation of trade 
(on the ground that "it does not 
create new values") is opposed 
by the People's Government, 
which does everything possible 
to promote internal commerce. 
With both industry and agricul-
ture producing more, and the 
liberated peasants entering the 
market as customers for all sorts 
of goods, the growth of exchange 
between town and country be-
comes more important daily. The 
Tientsin exhibition was organized 
to increase such trade. In the 
first and largest of its 17 pavilions, 
one could see how every form of 
transport, from trains to camel 
caravans, is utilized to knit the

how land and water routes have 
been improved and coordinated 
one with the other; how market-
ing procedures have been re-
formed, products standardized 
and credit facilitates expanded to 
help both seller and buyer. 
The North China Trade Exhibi-
tion was itself a mighty stimulus 
to commerce, both within North 
China and between North China 
and other regions. It was at-
tended by representatives of gov-
ernment and trading organiza-
tions, of North China's 10,000 
cooperatives which now have over 
ten million members, and of 
thousands of private firms. 
Orders actually placed at the ex-
hibition amounted to Y1,560,000,-
000,000 People's Currency (about 
US$70,000,000 or over E24,700,-
000). The trade turnover result-
ing from it indirectly will of 
course be much greater. 
The Tientsin exhibition is only 
one of many held in various parts 
of China during the past year and 
a half. Some, as for instance the 
Northeast Trade Exhibition at 
Mukden, showed an even larger 
trading turnover. Taken to-
gether, these exhibitions have 
helped considerably to strengthen 
the national economy and to lay 
the basis for large-scale indus-

First Trains In 
Szechuan 
A RROGANT young officials who 
ft moved to Chungking and other 
places in Szechuan province with 
the Kuomintang regime during 
the war with Japan used to jeer 
at the people there, "You've never 
seen the sea; you've never seen a 
train." This would always make 
the Szechuanese angry. They 
had been waiting a long time for 
a railway to help the development 
of their great and productive area 
which is as large, as populous and 
as rich in agricultural and indus-
trial resources as the whole of 
Germany. 
ver since 1906, when the 
Manchu dynasty still ruled, there 
had been talk of a railway from 
Chungking to Chengtu. Surveys 
were made, part of the roadbed 
laid out, station buildings erected 
at different times and contracts 
drawn up with all kinds of foreign 
concerns. Indeed, the collapse of 
the Manchu empire in 1911 was 
precipitated by a revolt of the 
Szechuan people against its 
attempt to turn over the projected 
line to American bankers (in the 
famous Hukuang loan scandals). 
But whether the Manchus, the so-
called Republic, the provincial 
militarists or the Kuomintang

grafters were in power, it was all 
the same. There were plenty of 
promises, the people were taxed 
to within an inch of their lives 
with each "revival" of the pro-
jects, corrupt officials dickered 
with imperialist monopolies over 
the unhatched chickens of railway 
profits, but no rails were laid and 
no trains ran. So it went on for 
over forty years. 
Today the people of Szechuan 
(now divided into four admini-
strative areas) are riding and 
hauling their goods in trains. The 
Central People's Government did 
in a few months what previous 
governments had prated about for 
decades. It took no more than 
half a year after the liberation of 
Szechuan for railway-building to 
begin in earnest. On June 15, 
1950, the first spike was driven on 
the 329-mile stretch of railway 
running west from Chungking, 
Szechuan's commercial and in-
dustrial port on the Yangtze river, 
to Chengtu, centre of its richest 
agriculture. On July 1, 1951, 
regular train service started on 
the 102-mile section from Chung-
king to Yungchuan. By the end 
of 1951, trains were puffing into 
Neikiang, 175 miles from Chung-
king. 
Soldiers and People 
The People's Liberation Army, 
which freed Szechuan from the 
long night of feudalism and im-
perialism, was also the force that 
changed the Chungking-Chengtu 
railway from dream to reality. 
Its officers and men did not con-
fine themselves to military tasks,

TRANSFORMING OUR CITIES 
CHINESE cities are being rebuilt 
ILA on new foundations. Roads, 
bridges, water supply and sewage 
disposal are being extended and 
improved. City life grows easier, 
healthier and cleaner. Peking, 
Shanghai, and Tientsin today 
manage to keep their streets Freer 
of garbage and litter than does 
New York, despite all the 
mechanical equipment at its dis-
posal. This may be hard to be-
lieve for anyone who knew only 
the old China. But it is true. 
Before liberation, whatever im-
provements were made in city 
services were for the benefit of 
the rich alone. Any convenience 
they may have afforded the work-
ing people was purely incidental. 
This was obvious to every eye. 
Running water, electricity and 
even pavements often ended 
abruptly in the middle of some 
city block, because that was 
where the last "person who mat-
tered" lived?and everything be-
yond was considered unimportant. 
The difference between services 
available in well-to-do residential 
areas and workers' districts of the 
same cities was shocking. The 
one had everything the twentieth 
century can provide. In the 
other, people were forced to live 
as though none of the inventions 
of the past 300 years had been 
heard of. 
Present improvements are be-
ing concentrated precisely in 
these workers' quarters. The fol-
lowing is a review of some of the 
things done in the past two years, 
city by city. 
Water and Sanitation 
In :Peking today, 1,200,000 peo-
ple are using running water free 
of bacillus coli. Miles of new 
water mains have been installed. 
Before liberation, there was no 
piped water at all outside the city 
walls. Now pipes have been ex-
tended to serve miners' settle-
ments in the western suburbs. 
Drainage and sewage disposal 
in the capital have improved be-
yond recognition. Heavy rains 
no longer turn any of its streets 
into deep canals where the water 
stagnates for weeks at a time. 
Open drains are being replaced 
by culverts. Newly paved smooth 
street surfaces also help drainage. 
Half-an-hour or 40 minutes after 
even the most torrential down-
pours, there is no longer any 
water in the streets of the 
working-class districts. This is 
true even of the lowest-lying 
areas, around Dragon Beard Ditch, 
where rain always used to inter-
rupt communications, and some-
times caused houses to collapse. 
The centuries-old underground 
sewage system of Peking, not used 
for years because it was neglected 
and blocked, has been cleared of 
all obstacles and made fully 
serviceable. Almost a hundred 
miles of its culverts have been 
cleaned and repaired. 
More Bridges; Better Roads 
Shanghai is concentrating on 
the repair of bridges and roads, 
which deteriorated badly through 
the years of Japanese and Kuo-
mintang occupation. The 44-year-
old steel Garden Bridge, which 
was in poor condition when the 
city was liberated, has been 
structurally restored and thor-
oughly rust-proofed after four 
months' work. The Huang Peng

Progress in Tientsin 
In Tientsin, the emphasis has 
been on an ample, safe supply of 
water to serve both the city's 
inhabitants and its industries. 
This city, the largest port of 
N,,rth China, has just increased 
its water supply by 65 per cent. 
Construction was based on a plan 
made 15 years ipg.,0 but shelved by 
the British interesis which then

Tientsin's water is now safe to 
drink from the tap, which was not 
the case before liberation. Pre-
parations are being made to soften 
all city water while still in the 
storage tanks, thus saving huge 
quantities of soap. 
Tientsin's communications have 
also been bettered. New locally-
made trolley buses run in the city. 
The main highway leading to 
Peking, long in a terrible state. 
has been fully repaired. People 
used to joke about this road, "A 
person riding into Tientsin is so 
banged around that he arrives 
with a bump on his head, hating 
the city before he has even seen 
it.- Now the road is a subject of 
compliments, not jeers. 
Labour Heroism at Nanking 
Nanking has re-surfaced 864,000 
square yards of city streets. The 
historic Chang Kan bridge, de-
stroyed by the Japanese invaders 
was rebuilt in half a year. Seventy 
feet wide, and made wholly of 
concrete, it carries traffic to 
southern Kiangsu province. 
Many labour heroes emerged 
on the Chang Kan bridge job, on 
which 700 men were engaged. 
Aware of the importance of 
restoring this major communica-
tions link, they worked on the 
buttresses in icy water during 
the winter months and through 
the turbulent spring thaw. City 
residents assisted by providing 
comforts and helping equip their 
dormitories, and by themselves 
doing volunteer work to complete 
a culvert, construction of which 
had been discontinued under the 
reactionary Kuomintang. 
A new 20-mile long sewer has 
been laid to serve 200,000 people 
living in the southern part of 
Nanking. Sewers in other sec-
tions of the city have been 
cleaned, repaired and extended. 
Despite the fact that the 
Kuomintang made Nanking its 
"capital" for so many years.

Large public swimming pools give relief from summer heat. This is the shallow pool at 
Shih Cha Hai, Peking, which also has others for more expert swimmers and divers. 
367,000 of the inhabitants lacked 
water service of any kind, and 
had to drink impure water from 
old wells and stagnant pools. One 
of the first things done after the 
liberation of the city was to install 
365 conveniently-placed hydrants 
to bring piped water to these 
areas. 
Housing, Parks and Hospitals 
Wuhan (the triple city of Wu-
chang, Hankow and Hanyang) is 
the industrial hub of central 
China. Reconstruction here has 
been concentrated on buildings 
and roads. The pace has been such 
as to cause temporary shortages 
of bricks and other materials. 
Wuhan has a new workers' hos-
pital, a new theatre and a movie-
house built specially for railway 
workers, new government build-
ings and over 500 units of new 
housing. The old municipal hos-
pital has been repaired. About 
300,000 square yards of trees and 
flowers have been planted and 
road surfaces have been paved. 
Wuhan's Central Park has been 
renovated and a new People's 
Square, with a capacity of 220,000 
persons, is planned for the city. 
Hangchow, capital of Chekiang 
province, has repaired 254 old-
style streets with an overall 
length of 30 miles, and provided 
them with proper drainage and 
sewers. By contrast with the 
"modern" thoroughfares along 
which Kuomintang officials rode 
around in their cars and big mer-
chants and bankers did their 
business, such streets were never 
taken care of in the past. 
Soldiers Build a City 
Not only are old cities in China 
being made over, but altogether 
new ones are being built. 
In faraway Sinkiang, men of the 
People's Liberation Army are 
working on a new garden city 
which will be completed in five 
years. They have already built 
over 20 miles of paved roads and 
many houses. The city will begin 
with an area of 51/2 square miles, 
with 350 acres devoted to three 
parks. Trees and flowering shrubs 
will line all streets and squares. 
The city will have industrial, 
administrative, commercial and 
residential zones. It will serve as 
a focal point for several large 
mechanized farms in the sur-
rounding countryside. 
Construction on the Sinkiang 
site began under the most difficult 
conditions. In winter, the ground 
froze hard, and had to be hewn 
like rock when foundations were 
laid. Beams for the houses were 
horse-hauled to the site from 60 
miles away (there is still no rail-
way). The People's Liberation 
Army men, soldiers who serve the 
people in peace as well as defend 
them, are determined to finish the 
job ahead of schedule. They have 
volunteered to work on Sundays 
as well as weekdays. 
The People Volunteer 
Labour enthusiasm is the 
foundation of all reconstruction 
and new building in China's cities. 
It is the weapon with which 
technical difficulties are overcome, 
old methods improved, new ways 
boldly tried out, and time-tables 
revised downward. In all cases, 
regular workers are supplemented 
by volunteers. Thus Nanking 
stevedores repaired several miles 
of streets in their spare time, 
saving the city the cost of labour. 
In Wuhan, students, government 
functionaries?even priests and 
nuns?undertook to work several 
hours a week to put their city in 
order. Among the Wuhan volun-
teers were an old woman of 80 
and a schoolgirl of twelve. 
The people are building in this 
spirit because the cities, the 
country, the government are now 
theirs. 
Workers held a block meeting when 
they moved into Pinghuang Villas, 
Shanghai, one of the developments 
replacing the old airless slums.

To fight plant diseases, which 
our peasants in the past accepted 
as an infliction from heaven, the 
People's Government has con-
centrated chiefly on prevention 
and mass education in science. 
Success has been achieved in 
checking grain smuts and other 
blights. 
Tree planting on

young timber 
was planted by 
peasants in Sulu

province. 
Man Wins Over "Fate" 
1-N 1950, during the spring thaw, 
o great ice-jam piled up at 
various points along the big bend 
of the Yellow River. threatening 
tne whole area with disastrous 
koods. Try as they mii.tht, the 
pf.asants could not ;c,t the ice 
floating again by their usual 
tnethods. Local artillery units of 
the People's Liberation Army 
came to their aid and tried to 
smash the blocks with gunfire, but 
they were too solid even for this. 
Then, on Chairman Mao Tse-
lung's own orders, the People's 
Air Force worked day and night 
to destroy ice-jams at 30 different 
points with heavy bombs?and 
there was no flood either that year 
or next. 
Throughout the ages, the Yellow 
River used to inundate the Honan 
plain whenever its rate of flow at 
Shenchow, in that province, 
exceeded 353.000 cubic feet per 
second. As soon as the People's 
Government was established. it 
mobilized the peasants to increase 
I he height of the surrounding 
dykes and build a large detention 
nasin. The result was that floods 
'vera avoided although the river's 
low rose to 600,000 clinic feet per 
.:econd in 1950 and to 312.000 cubic 
'eel per second in 1951. 
In the near future, the Yellow 
River, source of a hAndred evils, 
will be made to irrpiute tens of 
Ii )usands of souare miles of 
cuitivable land that now lacks 
only water to make it produce. 
It will be opened to navigation 
over great stretches that were 
lik.-!less for transport in the past. 
Conquering Drought 
As with floods, so with drought. 
People said of north China, before 
liberation, that it suffered "nine 
droughts every ten years." In 
1951. for the first time, a 
threatened drought was averted 
hy organized human effort. 
Under the personal leadership 
of large numbers of government 
functionaries headed by the 
chairmen of Hopei and Pingyuan 
provinces, ten million peasants 
dug 38,955 new wells and over 
4,000 irrigation channels equipped 
with 66,603 waterwheels. The 
parched land was watered and 
became green again. 
In the "drought year" of 1951, 
peasants in Hopei province 
managed to plant and save more 
than two million acres of cotton, 
helping the country to achieve the 
biggest crop in its history. 
Battling Crop Pests 
The People's Government is 
also waging war on various crop 
pests that used to make deep in-
roads on agricultural production. 
Last year, 34,000 government per-
sonnel of different grades led over 
six million peasants in campaigns 
against the grain-devouring locust 
and that deadly enemy of the 
cotton plant, the boll weevil. 
Over 8,000 tons of insecticide were 
sprayed by planes of the People's 
Air Force, supplemented by 96,623 
liquid sprayers and 4,451 powder 
sprayers on the ground. No less 
than 86 per cent of the 7,000,000 
acres of land afflicted by these 
parasites were cleared of them. 
Planting Forests 
Forests are important for water 
conservancy, drought prevention 
and soil protection, as well as 
timber. The reactionary Kuo-
mintang regime, with its corrupt 
officials and marauding troops, 
reduced the already depleted 
forests of China to a bare 5 per 
cent of the national territory. 
Floods, dust storms and droughts 
increased as a result. 
The People's Government pro-
tects all forests. In addition, in 
the first year of liberation alone, 
it planted 300 million saplings. 
In the spring of 1951, the second 
year, 500,000 acres of land were 
afforested. This was more than 
the Kuomintang did in all its 22 
years of misrule. 
China has 675 million acres 
(over a million square miles) of 
sub-marginal land on which trees 
can be grown. The government 
plans to turn all this land into 
forest within thirty years. When 
this has been done, forests will 
cover 20 per cent of the entire 
area of China instead of 5 per cent 
as at present. The appearance of 
the country, as well as conditions 
of agriculture, will change. De-
nuded hills around Chinese 
villages will he clothed in green. 
Watersheds will be guarded by 
stands of timber. Vast shelter 
belts will transform now arid 
sections of northwestern China 
and Inner Mongolia. 
Chinese peasants once believed 
that man's fate depended on the 
"will of heaven." Such super-
stitious ideas are being replaced 
by a conviction, already well-
founded in experience, that man 
must and can conquer nature. 
Common effort under the New 
Democracy is what the people 
rely on today in fighting calami-
ties and building their new life. 
The days of submission to "fate" 
are gone forever.

Miners 
Produce 
More, 
Live Better 
Equipped with new tools 
and work clothes, and 
better paid than ever be-
fore, miners in China's 
state-owned collieries have 
raised their output 23 per 
cent. 
OT long ago, Yuan Tze-ming, 
? I an ordinary miner at the 
Pinghsiang colliery in Kiangsi pro-
vince, wrote in his diary: "There 
was a time when I often had no 
wages coming in, and did not 
know what it was to be warm and 
well-fed. But this year everybody 
in my family has bought new 
clothes, new blankets, new mos-
quito nets and soft pillows. This 
year, I bought presents for my 
friends, yet I still have Y415,000 
saved up. Also, we have a pig." 
This is typical of the swift 
changes taking place in the lives 
of Chinese coal miners, both on the 
job and in their homes. Shower 
baths have been installed at pit-
heads. Miners have moved out of 
the dirty, leaking hovels in which 
they used to live into new well-
built dormitories. Their children 
go to school at the expense of the 
administration. Old miners can 
retire to special homes. A whole 
new network of hospitals, sana-
toria, libraries, spare-time schools, 
theatres and social halls serves 
China's mining communities. 
Miners used to have a hard time 
getting married. Now good wages 
and the respect in which workers 
are held have changed this. 
Parents no longer put up a fight 
when their daughter wants to 
marry a miner. In the Northeast, 
during the last two years, housing 
built by coal mine administrations 
for married couples totalled over 
2,253,000 square yards of floor 
space. 
Safety Measures 
Every precaution is being taken 
to make the work of the miner 
safe. This is a startling change 
from the old days when deaths 
among miners were often counted 
by hundreds in a single accident 
and when the mine administra-
tions, with the utmost callousness, 
worked on the principle: "We 
are interested in coal, not in 
lives." In 1950, the Central Peo-
ple's Government ordered that all 
coal mines be thoroughly in-
spected and ventilation equip-
ment installed. 
Safety training classes were 
set up and until miners had a 
thorough knowledge of the new 
regulations they were required to 
devote at least two hours a week 
to their study. Wide publicity 
was given to all safety measures 
and special committees were or-
ganized to see that they were 
carried out. 
One convincing proof of the 
need for such vigorous action 
came from Northeast China. An 
inspection of a machine shop at 
the Fushun coal field early last 
year brought to light no less than 
3,000 ?work hazards. These were 
all eliminated, the majority on 
suggestions from the workers 
themselves. The results were im-
mediate and in the following 
period the number of fatal acci-
dents decreased by 78.8 per cent. 
Safety work has now become a 
job for everyone. Last June, for 
example, a miner in the Chenghsi 
colliery injured his foot while at 
work. The administration imme-
diately called all workers and 
staff to a meeting at which the 
reasons for the accident were ex-
plored. Afterwards, led by their

During rest periods in the pits, literate miners teach those with less education. 
.zrade union, the miners were 
divided into panels which in-
vestigated the matter in greater 
detail and recommended neces-
sary changes. This procedure is 
typical. 
When the trade union of a 
colliery in Northeast China started 
mine safety campaign. the wives 
of the miners also joined in. They 
pledged: "When our husbands get 
out of bed, we will examine their 
pockets to see that they carry 
nothing inflammable to the pits." 
Miners' families also undertook to 
see that they got enough sleep. 
To ensure this, older women now 
get the children of night-shift 
workers together and tell them 
stories so that they don't make 
any noise while their fathers rest. 
Even the pedlars in mine towns 
now do their business at de-
signated spots and do not cry their 
wares so loudly as before. 
'rhe result of all these varied 
measures is that the death rate in 
Chinese coal mines decreased by 
75 per cent while injuries dropped 
65 per cent, in the first half of 1951 
as compared to 1950. Not a single 
mine explosion took place in 1951. 
Power Tools Appear 
Mining techniques are changing 
very fast. The old honeycombing 
methods are going out and the 
"long wall" method of timber-
ing is coming in, increasing both 
ill 
safety and production. Pneumatic 
picks and drills are replacing 
manual ones. When these were 
first brought to the Fengfeng Coal 
Mine, some miners were en-
thusiastic but others, more con-
servative, were fearful. They 
argued that the new tools were 
too heavy, that they were so noisy 
that one could not hear if the 
ceiling cracked, and therefore 
dangerous. 
Coal - hauling 
and man-trips 
In the Huainan 
mines are no 
electrified?an 
example of the 
way the 
miner's life 
and work have 
changed since 
liberation. 
5R012400130001-8 
As a result of discussion, Pit No. 
506 undertook to make a trial. 
Seventeen miners were elected to 
operate the pneumatic tools. The 
pit was divided into competing 
teams. Members of each team 
siLned a compact to cooperate 
closely with each other. To the 
surprise of the older men, a new 
record was made the very first 
day. Pneumatic driller Li Kwang-
('heng and his team cut 37.18 tons 
in four and a half hours. Other 
pits joined the competition. In 
two weeks, one set a man-day 
record of 254 tons! 
'I' )day, the miner rejoices in the 
nthchinery which produces on 
;ircii a large scale, calls for less 
strength and, in combination with 
:a!'ety measures, reduces the 
hazards of work. According to re-
cent. estimates, all collieries in 
China are overfulfilling their 
plans. The national average pro-
ductivity, among miners, has risen 
by 23 per cent. 
This year, the People's Govern-
ment will continue to rebuild and 
re-equip existing mines, and to 
prepare for the opening of new 
ones. Mining bureaus all over the 
country will also pay special 
attention to helping privately-
owned collieries to achieve higher 
output.

The Huainan Miners 
ATYPICAL example of the 
improvement in the life of 
miners since liberation is provided 
by the Huainan colliery in north 
Anhwei province. 
Knowing that their own welfare 
is dependent on production, the 
miners have raised working re-
cords beyond all estimates. In 
1951 the coal output target was 
surpassed by 11.7 per cent and 
topped that of 1950 by over 100 
per cent. During the year 175 
miners earned the title of "model 
worker," and 74 miners' brigades 
were named "advance teams," for 
efficiency in working methods. 
Following ?the increase in pro-
duction, came the overall im-
provement in the miners' welfare. 
Compared with 1950, average 
wages in 1951 increased 7.82 per 
cent and were scheduled to be 
raised another 19.5 per cent this 
spring. In addition large monetary 
awards were given to all model 
workers. 
Economically better off and 
politically awakened, the Huainan 
miners became eager to raise their 
cultural level. Over 7,600 went to 
sparetime schools during 1951 and 
are now all able to read simple 
texts. Among their family mem-
bers, 2,359 women enrolled for 
study and 5,285 children entered 
middle, primary ? or vocational 
schools. 
With a welfare fund contributed 
by the government, the miners 
were able to set up a hospital, a 
recreation centre, a model work-
ers' home, a sanatorium and a 
spare-time school. They have also 
formed 56 different kinds of clubs. 
Most of the miners have already 
moved into good housing. In 1951 
the mine administration built 
3,025 dwellings and repaired 4,817. 
It also opened many nurseries. 
For the first time in their lives 
great hope and happiness has 
come to the miners of Huainan.

Yu Chang the Wolf Hunter 
VOT LONG AGO, in the Huaian 
district, of Chahar. near Inner 
Mongolia. a little girl was snatched 
by a wolf. The people ran after 
the beast, but in vain. Suddenly 
a rifle cracked and the wolf fell 
dead, releasing the child who was

the girl's parents effusively 
ihanked the old peasant who had 
tired with such accuracy and 
effect, he replied briefly: "My 
own daughter was killed by a 
wolf. When I shot the beast, 
felt I was rescuing her. I hunt 
wolves because I want to protect 
our children." 
Shortly afterwards, the same 
old man, his gun slung over his 
shoulder, was seen on the platform 
at many village meetings called to 
aid Korea and defend our own 
country from the threat of 
-asion. At fairs and gatherings. 
he hung the carcasses of wolves 
he had killed in front of the public. 
"The imperialists are as ruthless 
and cunning as wolves," he would 
say, again and again. "If we 
don't keep them away we will 
never have peace." 
There are those who need end-
less hammering at a point before 
it penetrates their heads, but to 
the people of Huaian these words 
were convincint'. Moreover, the 
man who spoke them was not just 
;myhody. He was Yu Chang, 
Iheir own countryman, now 
famous throughout new China as 
lu -wolf-hunting hero." 
WHO is more familiar with the 
V wolf-nature than the inhabit-
-ints of Huaian? Wolves breed in

attacking anyone they came 
across. When the Kuomintang. 
which gave such matters little 
thought. was still in power. wolves 
killed 200 neople in Huaian in a 
single year. The terrified peasants 
did not dare no into their fields, 
no one ventured out of door.-; at 
night, and travellers did not trA)ve 
except in large groups. 
Of all the human people, no 
one can speak with more authority 
about wolves than Yu Chang. 
Fond of hunting from childhood, 
he started with rabbits and jackals 
and. after a few years, went on to 
wolves. To hunt the wolf with a 
!nuzzle-loader of village manu-
facture calls for great skill and 
courage. One must approach him 
at close quarters and kill with the 
first shot. A wounded wolf will 
leap at your throat before you 
have time to reload. Moreover, 
to kill a wolf with a native tiin 
is a much harder proposition than 
doing it. with a rifle. 
As Yu Chang says, one must hit 
a wolf "square in the nose if he 
is coming at you; right under his 
tail if he is running away; smack 
on his shoulder-joint if you flank 
him from the front and behind the 
ear if you flank him from the 
rear." All these are difficult shots, 
but if you can't manage them you 
had better not fire at all, because 
you won't even stop the animal. 
THROUGH MANY YEARS, Yu 
Chang learned to shoot un-
erringly. He also took to trapping, 
which requires strategy because 
wolves are wary creatures whose 
every habit must be studied if they 
are to be outwitted. But at one 
time all these painfully acquired 
skills threatened to go for nothing. 
Suddenly, during the Kuomintang 
period, Yu Chang's war on the 
wolves came to a dead stop. The 
Kuomintang officials began to con-
sider him a "dangerous fellow" 
because he was independent,

popular, active in reconnoitering 
the countryside and good with 
weapons. Yu Chang, the seasoned 
hunter who had never flinched 
before a wolf's fangs, was 
frightened by the wolf-men in 
authority,?against whom, as a 
plain peasant, he had no appeal. 
Shocked and discouraged, he put 
aside his gun and traps. 
I 4ATER the Japanese invaders 
I succeeded the Kuomintang. 
Under their rule, in the summer 
of 1941, packs of wolves once again 
ranged up and down Huaian. It 
was in that year that a well-known 
and much feared lone wolf slunk 
into Yu Chang's own yard, where 
his wife and five-year-old daughter 
were enjoying the cool evening, 
pounced on the child and dragged 
her off. When the hunter came 
home, he grabbed his long-unused 
gun and set out in pursuit. Fail-
ing to find the wolf in the dark, 
he came across the beast's tracks 
only at daybreak. The tracks led 
him to the half-eaten body of his 
little girl. 
After this, the grief-stricken Yu 
Chang left all other matters and 
devoted himself once more to 
trap and gun. He forgot his fear 
of the officials. He brushed off 
the superstitious old men in the 
village, beaten down by long 
slavery, who muttered that his 
daughter's death was "heavenly 
punishment" for many offences 
against the "supernatural" wolves. 
Neither men nor gods could pre-
vent the father from having his 
revenge?and after many sleepless 
nights on the trail the chance 
came. The cunning lone wolf 
finally approached Yu Chang's 
trap, sniffing at the bait sus-
piciously. Yu Chang, who was 
watching, fired once and did not 
miss. 
The father's vengeance only 
brought him more trouble. Once 
more the human wolves, Japanese 
quislings this time, smelled prey 
and got to work. When news of 
Yu Chang's resumed hunting

oppression, Yu Chang swore never 
to hunt again. 
reached the town police, they 
ordered his arrest. He was 
dragged from his home to jail. 
His frantic wife was kicked when 
she went to beg for mercy. Some 
time later, Yu Chang was re-
leased, with black eyes and a back 
half-broken from beatings. The 
rich fur of the wolf he had slain, 
taken from him as "evidence," 
ended up as a rug on the bed of 
the police chief's wife, who liked 
such things. 
THIS TIME, Yu Chang vowed 
-I- never to touch his gun again 
as long as he lived. Even libera-
tion, which came to Huaian after 
the war, did not change his fixed 
resolve. The Communist party 
overthrew the old rulers. Yu 
Chang received seven acres of 
prime land in the land reform and 
began to cultivate them with his 
family, hard workers all. Free-
dom and a better life came to him 
and to all the Huaian people. 
Why hunt again and court mis-
fortune, risk the loss of all this 
happiness? That was how things 
looked to the old man, scarred to 
the depths of his soul by the 
oppression of the o] .d order. 
But the wolves did not leave the 
people alone. In 1949 they des-
cended on the district again?
killing and mauling over a hun-
dred persons. The marauding 
beasts became so daring that they 
entered the county town, and 
children were kept home from 
school. The District People's 
Government, unlike the autho-
rities of the past, called on the 
peasants to organize themselves 
for a large-scale hunt. Yu Chang, 
however, was not among those 
who responded. He let his wea-
pons lie and farmed his land. 
When the people, remembering 
Yu Chang's skill, came and asked 
him to lead their effort, the 
veteran wolf hunter declined. He 
gave as an excuse his age and poor 
health, but the real reason was his 
deep, unreasoning fear. Only 
after repeated urging and long 
visits by the district chiefs, only 
after fine new arms were supplied 
that made his hunter's heart leap, 
did Yu Chang finally consent, still 
with deep foreboding. 
(NCE ON THE TRAIL of his 
" ancient enemy, however, Yu 
Chang's old instincts, courage and 
rich experience rushed to the 
surface. Within three days he had 
personally caught a wolf alive on 
top of the town wall and killed 
two others. The campaign was a 
success. The streets of Huaian 
became safe. Peasants who had 
stood in awe of the "godly" powers 
of the wolf began to see a talisman 
in the human skill of the famed 
Yu Chang. Delegates came from 
every place that was still infested. 
No sooner did Yu Chang clear one 
village of wolves than he was 
called to another.

Self-confidence and self-respect 
returned to the old hunter. The 
admiration and love with which 
he was met everywhere made a 
ew, man of him. He took 
pleasure in travelling from place 
Ii place and saving the people. 
When rewards were offered, he 
refused, saying: "It is for my 
fellow-countrymen that I came 
out, not to seek profit." His re-
nown grew to new heights after 
he tracked down a she-wolf long 
known for size, elusveness and 
ferocity. Terrified villagers who 
had caught a glimpse of her said 
hiat she was -as big as a donkey, 
with bloodshot eyes." Even Yu 
Chang was puzzled at first by the 
beast's apparent ability to move 
te knit without leaving a trail. It 
was only alter many long days 
hat he discovered that she had an 
unusual habit of walking only in 
cart-ruts along the roads. When 
he set his best trap in a place 
based on this knowledge and hid 
to watch the capture, the she-wolf 
came up to it, calmly chewed the 
wire that secured it, sprang the 
trap and carried it off, bait and 
:U1, in her teeth. 
Yu Chang had been so sure of 
-oaring this wolf that he lay in 
ambush without firearms, carrying 
only a long iron hook for the 
finishing stroke. It was with this 
hook that he gave pursuit through 
the snow, stalking the beast from 
the East Mountain to Taiping 
valley, keeping after her for three 
,lays and nights, hungry, his boots 
worn out, his feet half-frozen. 
Finally, the tired wolf's vigilance 
began to falter while the hunter's 
determination was stilt keen. Yu 
Chang was able to surprise her, 
and kill her with his hook. Even 
after skinning, the carcass weighed 
well over a hundred pounds. 
ALONG WITH the honours 
- piling on Yu Chang, came a 
problem, the new kind of problem 
which, instead of thwarting people, 
makes them grow and advances 
the common interest. Unstinting 
of his energy in helping others, 
the old wolf-hunter was still con-
servative on one point. He was 
ready to use his skill at any call, 
but not to divulge his techniques. 
When village cadres tried to per-
suade him to teach his experience 
to whole groups, so that the people 
themselves could handle the 
wolves, Yu Chang became stub-
born. How could amateurs absorb 
quickly what it had taken him a 
lifetime to learn, he asked him-
self. Besides, why should he part 
with knowledge so hardly ac-
quired? 
It was only after Yu Chang 
had been invited, as an hon-
oured participant, to provincial 
and national meetings of labour 
heroes, after he had heard the 
speeches of Chairman Mao Tse-
tung and other leaders, that he 
began to realize that this attitude, 
"natural" in the old society, was a 
form of selfishness. Gradually, 
Yu Chang's ideas changed. "If 
After liberation Yu Chang was 
persuaded to resume hunting for 
the sake of the people. 
wolves are to be wiped out over 
large areas, I can't do it alone 
though I hunt day and night," he 
thought. "Only large numbers of 
skilled hunters can do it. And 
who can teach them better than 
I?" That was how Yu Chang 
learned what makes a true peo-
ple's hero in our time. 
ODAY Yu Chang is a public 
-I figure of the new type. Aided 
by the government, beloved by the 
people, he finds joy in teaching 
and organizing large numbers of 
hunters. He has trained over 120 
apprentices and helped form some 
sixty teams in different villages. 
He has lent his most prized 
Soviet-made trap to village black-
smiths to be copied. When some 
of his apprentices encountered 
material difficulties, Yu Chang 
sold his own furs to help them 
out. Always on the lookout for 
men able to pit wits and daring 
against the wolves, he even under-
took to turn two former opium 
smokers who had become village 
pests into hunters?and succeeded. 
This is the man who appears 
throughout Chahar and Inner 
Mongolia, now in one district, now 
in another, telling what the new 
society has done for him, inspiring 
assurance that with its help men 
can conquer wolves as well as all 
other calamities. 
As a speaker and propagandist, 
Yu Chang is in endless demand. 
Old men listen to him with 
respect, because his past was their 
own. Young men look up to him; 
he can teach the best of them 
skill and courage. Who can more 
appropriately speak of the power 
of our country than this simple 
peasant whose labour-trained 
brain and hands have outmatched 
the wolf in strength and cunning? 
The illustrations in this story are 
from a coloured poster series used 
in peasant education?and displayed 
at the recent North China Trade 
Exhibition in Tientsin. Such posters 
hare done much to introduce new 
methods of production and organization 
to both peasants and workers.

A PLACE 
THE CHILDREN 
LOVE 
CHEN SHAN-MING 
11HE NURSERY of the China 
Welfare Institute is only 
ten minutes by car from the 
western edge of Shanghai. En-
tering the main gate, one is struck 
with the beauty of the compound, 
its numerous tall evergreen and 
maple trees and its wide, green 
lawns that give off a pleasant 
grassy fragrance. One feels that 
such a place must be a paradise 
for children, and the joyous 
shouts of the kiddies soon prove 
this to be so. 
The CWI Nursery, which was 
started after the liberation of 
Shanghai, is a pilot project for 
the solving of several of China's 
main problems in child care. The 
first of these problems is con-
nected with the position of women 
in the new society. Our liberated 
women are being drawn into the 
work of reconstructing the nation. 
Many find it difficult, however, to 
do so as long as there is no provi-
sion for the care of their children 
while they are at work. 
The second problem concerns 
the many women who volunteer 
for temporary work in outlying 
areas where they cannot take 
their children. To meet i,heir 
needs, we must have homes which 
give complete care, twenty-four 
hours a day. This is a transition-
al problem. As more facilities 
become available in or near every 
place of work, all our children 
will have both group and home 
life. Today, as a legacy from the 
pre-liberation period, the number

of nurseries, though growing 
rapidly, is still inadequate to meet 
the expanding demand. 
A Pilot Project 
The CWI Nursery is an experi-
mental one. It takes care of some 
200 children of working mothers 
in industry, government and peo-
ple's organizations. It operates 
around the clock and provides 
everything a child needs in medi-
cal care, food, play, education 
and companionship. 
Since such work in China is 
comparatively new, the nursery 
constantly assesses its own ex-
periences and makes changes 
necessary for the normal and 
healthy development of the 
children. Methods which have 
proved themselves are written up 
and made widely available to 
mothers, child care workers and 
other nursery institutions. A 
teaching centre for nursery educa-
tion is now being planned. 
The main emphasis in the CWI 
Nursery is on physical develop-
ment. A resident pediatrician, of 
many year's experience, assisted 
by six graduate nurses, keeps an 
eye on the children from the 
moment they enter the institu-
tion. Before admission, every 
child is thoroughly examined and 
given a tuberculin test. If the 
reaction is positive, the child is 
X-rayed to make sure no active 
lesions exist. If it is negative, a 
BCG inoculation is given. After 
admission all children are vac-
cinated against smallpox and in-
oculated with pertussis vaccine, 
diphtheria toxoid, and other pre-
ventives according to a schedule 
set by the Shanghai Municipal 
Health Bureau. 
Each morning, there is a health 
inspection. Suspected cases of 
illness are immediately isolated 
in an infirmary. After their noon 
nap, the temperature of all the 
children i taken. The health

section keeps a constant check 
on minor ailments. Height and 
weight are measured every month 
and special attention is given to 
children who are underweight or 
do not increase regularly in 
weight. A complete physical 
examination is given each child 
every three months. 
The nursery staff carries on 
constant health teaching. The 
children are taught about life in 
the infirmary through stories, 
songs and rhymes. Through 
posters and conversations, they 
have learned why preventative 
injections are good for them and 
will help them to grow strong. 
Now, during physical examina-
tions, many help the doctor by 
handing her tongue depressors 
and a flash light. When the time 
comes to be weighed, they un-
dress and stand on the balance, 
anxiously asking whether they 
have grown. In the infirmary, 
they chat and joke gaily with the 
nurses. 
The life in the infirmary is pat-
terned as much as possible after 
lie regular life of healthy kiddies. 
Sick children have their own sets 
of toys and playthings and a de-
finite daily schedule. After re-
covery they greet the nurses when 
they see them, with smiles and 
1-1,1ppy calls. 
Last winter, a little boy in one 
class caught measles. The first 
step taken was to isolate him im-
mediately. Then all parents who 
were in the vicinity were called 
to give blood transfusions to their 
children if they had been exposed. 
Children whose parents were not 
available or suffered from poor

The children seem a little dubious 
when Chen Shan-ming brings 
them their first 
puppy, 
health received blood donated by 
the doctor and nurses. As a 
result, the epidemic was controlled 
within one class. Due to good 
care, the infected children 
developed no complications. Some 
even gained weight during their 
;:tay in the infirmary. 
The children's diet is carefully 
planned and supervised by R 
trained nutritionist. Each child 
gets one egg, two dishes of mixed 
protein, a dish of rice or noodles, 
fruit, milk, biscuits and dessert, 
soup and five cups of water daily. 
The food is eaten in three well-
balanced meals supplemented by 
two light snacks of milk and 
biscuits or nuts in the afternoon. 
Educational Programme 
The main emphasis in the 
nursery's education programme is 
on love. Children are taught to 
love their country and people. 
They learn folk songs and dances 
and hear stories about the builders 
and defenders of new China. 
Here is a typical result. Once a 
?-zroup of 31/2-year-olds went to 
visit a nearby vegetable garden. 
On the way home, they met three 
soldiers of the People's Liberation 
Army. They immediately began 
calling them "Uncle" and asked 
We soldiers to play with them. 
One bright-eyed little girl said, 
"You army uncles are brave. You 
love all children, help the pea-
sants and protect us from our 
enemies. When we grow up we 
want to be like you." The chil-
dren began to sing one of their 
songs called "The Good Libera-
tion Army." The three soldiers 
picked the children up one by one 
and gave them tight fatherly hugs. 
They were reluctant to go on 
about their business and wanted 
to stop and play with their small 
friends. When the children came 
back to the nursery, they re-
ported, "We saw some Liberation 
Army Uncles. We shook hands 
with them and they picked us up 
and said we were good children." 
The story was repeated over and 
over again to the envy of all who 
had not had the same good luck.

The children are taught to 
love and respect labour. Every 
opportunity is taken to show them 
how the things which they use 
are produced. They see how the 
chairs they sit on are made by the 
nursery carpenter, how the food 
they eat started with plowing and 
planting by the farmers, how the 
milk they drink is prepared by 
the cook. 
Making Things Grow 
The older children also plant 
vegetables in their own garden. 
The first day that a class gets an 
allotment is filled with great ex-
citement and happiness. The 
children divide into groups. One 
picks up stones and wheels them 
to the garbage pile. A second 
pulls up the weeds. A third, 
aided by the teachers, digs and 
hoes. The fourth group plants the 
seeds. The garden is watered 
every day. When the first eager-
ly awaited sprouts appear, the 
youngsters' faces are radiant with 
proud happiness. 
When the vegetables are ready 
to eat, the children take them to 
the cook and ask that they be 
prepared for the next meal. 
Many children who previously 
disliked vegetables now eat their 
whole portion and ask for more. 
Children who have worked in the 
garden take the initiative in pro-
tecting all plants and flowers in 
the nursery. 
In the children's own activities, 
self-reliance and mutual help are 
stressed very early. The 11/2-
year-olds are encouraged to feed 
themselves with only occasional 
help from the teachers. Older 
kiddies learn to undress and later 
to dress themselves. They take 
turns undoing each other's back 
buttons, making beds and clean-
ing the classrooms and play-
rooms. All put their chairs back 
in place after meals, learn to use 
their handkerchiefs, wash their 
hands before eating and to line up 
in good order when going from 
place to place. In this way, the 
youngsters quickly become inde-
pendent. Group encouragement 
together with individual help 
where it is needed is the principle 
employed. 
Love of nature is also devel-
oped in the children. They are 
taken on trips to nearby farms 
and vegetable gardens, to the

ing, the play-

park, the zoo and the dairy. They 
learn the life cycle and functions, 
common plants, animals and in-
sects. Older classes help to plant 
vegetables and to feed the nursery 
pets. When the children first 
saw the cows in the dairy, many 
were frightened of these huge 
animals. But after watching the 
milking and feeding, all of them 
were willing to stroke the calves. 
Public Spirit Taught 
Love of the people's property is 
taught by emphasis on good care 
of toys, which are put back in 
their places after playtime and 
washed regularly in soap and 
water. The children are taught 
to take good care not only of the 
toys in their own class but also 
those of other classes and those 
shared by the whole nursery. 
Natural curiosity to see how 
things work is diverted from de-
structive into constructive chan-
nels. For example, young Lin-
lin once gave the wall a taste of 
his wooden hammer. The teacher 
explained that all big boys keep 
their home in good condition and 
that hammers are used to make 
toys. After this, Lin-lin became 
a voluntary one-man guard for 
the walls of the playroom. 
Finally, the children are incul-
cated with love and deep appre-
ciation for their parents and the 
work they are doing for the coun-
try. Parents are urged to come 
and see their children once a

The nursery has many foreign visitors. These pictures show friends from England

staff reports on the health and 
progress of every one of their 
charges. 
The Children's Holiday 
International delegates and 
friends of China often come to see 
the CWI Nursery. The young-
sters crowd around their "Indian 
Aunties," "Soviet Uncles" or 
"English Uncles." They want to 
shake hands and be picked up. 
They also sing and dance for the 
guests. 
When the Indian peace delegate, 
Dr. M. Atal, came to visit the 
nursery, he was greeted by young 
Cheng-wei who bowed to him and 
presented him with a bouquet of 
flowers almost as big as himself. 
The doctor bowed, picked a 
red carnation and gave it back to 
the little boy. Cheng-wei was 
surprised but soon recovered, 
with a beaming smile and a quick 
"thank you." The doctor then 
found himself surrounded by ex-
pectant eyes and outstretched 
hands. He left with only one 
flower as a memento of his visit. 
This peace delegate brought hap-
piness to the youngsters, and their 
joy and love gave him new 
strength in his own struggle. 
There are many celebrations. 
in the nursery, of which Interna-
tional Children's Day is the most 
important. Early in the morn-
ing, last June 1, little Chen-sen 
stuck his head out of his mosquito 
Jo 
net and yelled, "Big demonstra-
tion today." This was followed 
from all sides by: "I shall carry 
Chairman Mao's portrait," "I 
shall be the Spirit of Peace." "The 
teacher says today is like our 
birthday." "Teacher says we have 
to behave on our birthday." 
After breakfast the older classes 
marched in a demonstration while 
the younger ones acted as specta-
tors. All the children were 
dressed in bright colours, there 
was much noise from the waist-
drum and yangko dance teams. 
Then followed the Spirit of Peace 
and the portraits of China's great 
leaders. The marchers sang and 
danced, shouted slogans and 
pinned flowers on the teachers' 
dresses. They had heard so much 
about people's parades since libera-
tion that they were overjoyed to 
have one of their own. 
The nursery staff prepared the 
children's favourite dishes for 
the noon meal. In the afternoon, 
there was a meeting. Tse-ke, six 
years old, was chairman. He 
said, "Today is our birthday. We 
are very happy. We will be good 
boys and girls. Let's tell Chair-
man Mao and Vice-Chairman 
Soong Ching Ling that we will 
grow up to be good people like 
them." This was followed by the 
presentation of flowers to teach-
ers, cooks and nursery attendants 
as an expression of thanks for 
their work. Then each class gave 
a performance, even the two-
year-olds going up to the platform 
and singing "Little, Little Mouse." 
The final part of the celebration 
was a cartoon film. 
Staff Standards Are Raised 
The responsibility of caring for 
the children is taken very serious-
ly by the CWI Nursery staff. 
After an 81/2 hour work-day, 
they devote a further hour to 
political and professional study. 
Two years of such study have pro-
duced most gratifying results. 
Staff members have been able to 
overcome most of their indivi-
dualistic attitudes and developed 
a selfless revolutionary striving to 
better their work in every way. 
Before the liberation, many 
nurseries had to disguise them-
selves as hospitals, orphanages 
or schools to get even an allot-
ment of rice. Since liberation, 
the best houses have been allo-
cated to them by the people's 
government, which gives them 
every attention and consideration. 
In Shanghai alone, the number of 
nurseries has increased several-
fold. The China Welfare Institute 
is proud to be pioneering in this 
work. 
It is proud to give their earliest 
training to children who are 
wanted, protected and respected 
in new China, who will grow up 
to love their people and help build 
a world of progress and peace.

olive branch 
signifying 
peace and a 
large figure 
"1" in yellow. 
An inscription 
under the flag 
reads "Com-

the First An-
niversary o f 
the Founding of the People's Republic of 
China." The value, a decorative leaf 
design and the words "October 1, 1949" 
and "1950" appear at the base. The in-
scription and base are differently coloured 
in each of the five stamps comprising 
the set, while the central design is the 
same. 
Denominations are: 11100, red, yellow 
and purple; 11400, red, yellow and red-
brown; Y800, red, yellow and dark green; 
Y1,000, red, yellow and olive; Y2,000, red,

27 x 311/2 mm. The exception, an 
unusual one since it is not the highest 
value but the one used for ordinary

much larger, 38 x 45% mm. Perf. 14. 
For the Northeast, 0.4tMfil is added 
beside the flagpole. Values are NEY1,000;

Like all contemporary Chinese stamps, 
each commemorative bears the words

below all other elements of the design, 
in close proximity to the denomination. 
The commemoratives also carry minute 
identifytn,?; numbers and symbols on the 
bottom margin, according to the follow-
ing system: *g 1.4-3 means "First Com-
memorative Set, consisting of four 
stamps, third stamp." Al]. stamps are 
printed on unwatermarked paper and are 
not gummed. 
It is interesting to note that, in sets 
Nos. 4 and 5, traditional Chinese decora-
tive elements were introduced to frame 
the stamp designs. This tendency was 
to become stronger in subsequent issues.

A, PUBLIC FIGURE 
CHINA 
not many years ago, Li Shun-ta was a poverty-stricken refuge.. Today -hundreds of millions of men, women and 
children in China know his name and admire his achievements. This simple, hankorking man has given an example to our entire 
peasantry of how to tread boldly forward to prosperity along the road opfiNJ by liberation. His work methods and 
achievements hay* been publicized by the government the press and people's organizations. 
Li Shun-ta's initiative in organizing mutual aid teams and introducing new methods of cultivation has brought higher 
productivity and a better life to his own village. In MI, Li Shun-ta's mutual-aid team challenged teams all over the country 
to compete in raising agricultural output. Their response has already had a marked effect on Chinese agriculture as a whole. 
Ll SHUN-TA and his Farah, fleeing from famine in 
,Ionan province during the Anti-Japanese War, settled 
a small village in the bare Shansi mountains. 
HE WAS THE FIRST to respond when the Libera-
ted Area Government called on the peasants to organize 
mutual-aid teams to increase production. 
DURING THE ANTI-JAPANESE WAR, when 
there was a shortage of harvest labour, Li Shun-ta 
mobilized old men, women and children to help. 
LI WAS NOT AFRAID to by a new variety of 
^ "Golden Queen," introduced by the government. 
His once skeptical neighbours came to admire the result-
ing bumper crop. 
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT urged the peasants "IF THE MOTHER SEED IS STOUT, the 
to soak their seeds in warm water to combat disease, U offspring will be fat," says U Shun-ta who is the Rrs4. to 
was the first to try. The good results again convinced introduce the practice of seed selection in his locality 
his neighbours. 
ALSO LED in investing in improved imple-
nents and propagandizing their merits far and wide. 
UNDER LI SHUN-TAS LEADERSHIP the IN toSo LI SHUN-TA WAS ELECTED model 
village grew prosperous. "Our wild mountain has peasant of Shansi province and attended the Netinnal 
become a treasure mountain," the vsllagers said. Conference of Labour Models in Peking whore he was 
personally congratulated by Chairman Mao Tse-tun. 
This picture story of Li Shun-ta is typical of the many presented in series of coloured posters at the great North 
China Trade Exhibition at Tientsin. Such posters have done much to educate peasants and workers in new methods of 
production and organization and to put an end to the old dependence on -fate." They are among the many ways by 
which th? cultural level of the Chinese people is being raised.
