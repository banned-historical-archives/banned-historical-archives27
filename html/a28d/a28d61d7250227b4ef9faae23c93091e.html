 SOUTH VIETNAMESE ELECTIONS
 I.   The last time we met, the. South Vietnamese
 elections were still a month away, and we
 were thinking in terms of a 60-percent
 voter turnout as a fair indication of the
 beginnings of public commitment.
 II.   Since then, the question of the size of the
 vote became the major issue in the elections.
 A.    The Viet Cong made it clear that they
 were out to disrupt'. the balloting.
 B.    The more militant members of the
 Buddhist hierarchy called on their
 followers to boycott it.
 C.    You have seen the results.  More than
 80 percent of the registered voters
 turned out on September 11.
 1.   Registration---5,289,000---was up
 12 percent from previous lists.

 III.   The result was a kick in the teeth, both for the Viet
 Cong and for the Bu.k.hist militants.
 A.   Premier Ky and other 7overnment-'.leaders mounted
 a thorough and effective drive to get out the
 vote.
 Extraordinary security precautions, together
 with good intelligence reporting on Viet Cong
 plans,  stopped any major Communist efforts to
 disrupt.the voting.
 1.   Terrorism was well above the normal. level,
 but had no significant impact.
 C.  There was no evidence of government favoritism
 for any particular candidates.   The consensus
 of foreign observers is that the election was
 honest.
 IV.    The election has thus demonstrated the administrative
 ability of the government, dealt a sharp blow to Viet
 Cong prestige,  and got South Vietnam's evolution to--
 ward representative government off to a good start.
 A.   The election result should not be viewed as a.
 popularity contest between the government and
 the Viet Cong, but rather as an effective demon-
 stration of the government's administrative and
 security apparatus.

 B.  The failure of the Viet Cong antielection cam-
 paign revealed their overall weakness in govern-
 'ment-controlled areas when confronted by a well-
 coordinated and purposeful government program.
 C.  The elected assembly is made up of local favor-
 ite sons and a few well-known politicians.
 1.   It will begin drafting a constitution next
 week.
 2.   The voter turnout gives it  a.relatively
 significant popular mandate, but there are
 of course many obstacles to be overcome be-
 fore we can expect a representative, effec-
 tive, government.
 THE MILITARY SITUATION
 I.   Since I last briefed you on US operations in the
 area of the Demilitarized Zone, there have been very
 few significant encounters with the enemy.
 A.   You may remember that Operation HASTINGS
 in July killed more than 880 enemy soldiers

 by actual body count.   It forced the North
 Vietnamese 324th Division back from Quang
 Tri Province into the Demilitarized Zone
 and North Vietnam.
 into this area.
 1.     There are also indications that addi-
 tional combat forces are infiltrating
 25X1
 25X1
 25X1
 2.     This latest buildup has been accompanied
 by an intensive logistics-effort which
 includes the nightly movement of mili-
 tary cargoes by junk or other watercraft
 along the North Vietnamese coast to the
 border area.   From there, the materiel
 goes by truck to locations within or
 near the DMZ.
 Approv
 Approved For Release 2005/04/28 : CIA-RDP79T0082714000400090004-1
 C.    In an effort to counter this enemy buildup,
 US forces have launched a new spoiling
 operation-code-named PRAIRIE--and have
 greatly intensified air strikes in this
 area.,
 1.   US activity has been successful in
 keeping the enemy off balance and has
 sharply curtailed his ability to
 launch any large-scale operation in
 the next month or so.   PRAIRIE has
 already i_nfllcted more than 500 en-
 emy casualties.
 V.       Despite the relative success of US opera-
 tions in recent weeks, the enemy buildup
 in Quang Tri Province and southern North
 Vietnam poses a considerable threat.
 iti is clearly one of the most impor-
 tant military developments now taking
 place in the war.
 2.   The North Vietnamese have effectively
 extended their territorial control
 through the Demilitarized Zone into
 northern South Vietnam.

 3.   This offers them a number of military
 advantages, such as a more secure
 logistics and infiltration corridor
 and the ability to counter any sig-
 nificant US and South Vietnamese at-
 tempts to choke off infiltration by
 ,ground action.
 II.   We hive obtained more and more evidence in
 recent months of the extent to which Hanoi
 is running--and taking part in--the war'in
 South Vietnam.
 A.   Captured documents and the interrogation
 of prisoners have now identified the man
 who is running the entire Communist war
 effort in South Vietnam.   He is Nguyen Chi
 Thanh,  (NNGWIJEN CHEE TAHN) a politburo
 member of the'., North Vietnamese Communist
 Party.
 1.   Thanh is a general in the North Vietnam-
 ese Army,  and has been its political
 commissar.   He left North Vietnam to
 take over operations in the South
 early in 1965.

 2. His two principal deputies are also
 both generals in the North Vietnamese
 Army, and members of the central com-
 mittee of the North Vietnamese Commu-
 nist Party.
 3. One of them, the military deputy, is
 Tran Van Tra, who used to be deputy
 chief of staff of the North Vietnamese
 Army. Now, under the alias of Tran Nam Trung,
 he is listed as chief of the Military
 Affairs Committee of the so-called
 National Front for the Liberation of
 South Vietnam.
 4.    The deputy who runs the Communist political
 organization in South Vietnam is General
 Tran Do.
 B.   That is a good sample of how little identifi-
 cation the National Front for the Liberation
 of South Vietnam actually has with the people
 of South Vietnam.

 MAHON BRIEFING
 4
 I.   The internal political scene in Communist
 China has been marked by turmoil and disarray
 for many months now.   All of the indicatio>'s
 are that the situation is still unstable,
 and there may be further upheavals.
 A.    For the past month, mobs of rampagins*
 teenagers of the so-called Red Cuard iiav.:
 kept the coun.. ry in a state of disorr' ~r
 1.   They hav:: be( n roaming the streL' _s
 of all major Chinese cities,
 harassing su pected enemies of  he
 regime and ok :asionally beating ther
 up.
 2.    There have been a few reports of
 extensive vir.lence and bloodshed,
 but for the rv.,ost part the Red Oiari
 appear to be a disciplined and well,
 controlled oYanization.
 3.    In the past 4'eek  or so, their activities
 have subsided somewhat.
 B.    The destructive an`.ics of these teer?agers
 have tended to divert public attent.,cn
 from far more important development:

 within the party leadership.   It appears
 to us that the top power structure of the
 party is undergoing its most massive
 shake-up in the history of the Chinese
 Communist regime..
 (BRIEFING BOARD, CHICOM LEADERSHIP)
 IT.   Last month, massive demonstrations in Peking on
 the 18th and 31st of August'fea ured what
 appears to be a new line-up of the party's
 top policy-making body, the politburo.
 A.  Mao Tse-tung still dominates the leadership,
 but Defense Minister Lin Piao has taken
 the place of Mao's long-time deputy,
 Liu Shao-chi.
 1.   Liu has been the titular chief of
 state.   There has been no announce-
 ment that he has lost that position,
 and he is still a member of the
 politburo, but he has been dropped
 ignominiously from second to eighth
 place.
 B.  As for Mao himself, we are not sure just
 how much control he still exercises over
 day-to-day events, or how long he wiU last.

 III.    Mao's new deputy, Lin Piao, is not in much
 better health.
 25X1
 25X1
 IV.    Mao, however, appears to have chosen Lin to be
 his successor in spite of Lin's frailty.   We
 think this must reflect Mao's growing mistrust
 of other elements of the leadership.
 A.  Perhaps the most significant aspect of
 the recent changes has been the break-up
 of the group of leaders which had been
 running the party :machinery for the past
 decade.
 1. Liu Shao-chi was the leading member
 of that group.
 Approved For Release 2005/042a: CIA-RDP79T00827A000400090004-1
 Approved *t* Release 2005/04/28: CIA-RDP79T00,27A000400090004-1
 2.    The General Secretary of the Party,
 Teng Hsiao-ping, is another leading
 member of that group.   He has been
 weakened, but not as much as Liu.
 3.    A couple of months ago, in fact,
 Teng appeared to have gained in the
 shake-up.   All that has changed.
 Teng is still in the inner circle of
 Mao's advisors, but he has slipped
 from third or fourth place to sixth
 place in the power structure.
 B.    In place of the party leaders, military
 leaders close to Lin, and government
 figures like Chou En-lai, have risen in
 importance.
 V.    For many years now, it had appeared to us that
 the leaders of the party machinery--men like
 Liu Shao-chi--enjoyed Mao's full trust.
 A.    They not only had a long record of personal
 loyalty to Mao; their radical approach
 was also in accord with his.
 B.    This situation presents us with a
 puzzling contradiction, especially in
 regard to its policy implications:
 Approved F
 Approve    r Release 2005/04/28: CIA-RDP79T0
 1.    Mao is a"uarent 1y intent on pushing
 through :+. radical program to reshape
 Chinese. society.   It appears to he so
 radical that the party rank-and-file
 could not he trusted to carry it out.
 The Rec  Guard had to be created.
 2.    There is, therefore, no satisfactory
 explanation for Mao's willingness to
 turn against his old comrades who
 appeared to share his radical views.
 3.    The government administrators and
 economic specialists who have been
 retained or even promoted--men like
 Chou En-lai, Chen Yun, and Li f u-ch,an-
 are the relatively moderate members of
 the politburo.
 4.    Yet these moderates are now the nei,
 who presumably will be helping Mau and
 Lin Piao to implement the radical program.
 VI.     As I have said, the situation appears to be h.ghlv
 unstable.   The events of the past ten months  ;gust
 have intensified the &ntagonisms and mistrust
 among those leaders who have survived the purge.

 A.    The possibility has increased that when
 Mao finally does go, the succession will
 be disorderly, and marked by factional
 struggles and blcody purges.
 B.    It is also far from clear whether or not
 the new leaders are going to institute
 any major changes in domestic or foe 4,n
 policy.
 C.    There has, however, been no change in the
 basic hard-line nature of the men at the
 top.   As a resitlt, we foresee no abrupt
 change in Pekin?g'   policy of implacable
 hostility towad the United States.
 (FOREIGN POLICY)
 I.    In general, the Peking leaders have been so
 pre-occupied with t-:'oubles at home that they
 have been marking time on foreign policy.

 A.      The first  U.  S-  attacks on North Vietnam'
 POL storage facilities on June 29th pro-
 vided a short-lived barrage of propa-
 ganda.
 1.   Peking  tried  to convey the impression
 that China was more determined than
 ev-e'r to assist Hanoi in resisting
 this new escal.tion.
 2.     But the Chinese declarations of
 "resolute support" for the Vietnamese
 did not exhibit the ring of enthusi-
 asm that had marked similar state-
 ments on the subject a year ago.   The
 emphasis was on self-reliance by the
 Vietnamese.
 B.     Peking, however, appears to be just as
 determined as ever that the North Viet-
 namese must continue the war.
 1. After the September 7th meeting of
 the U. S.-and Chinese Communist ambassa-
 dors in Warsaw, the Chinese Ambassador
 released a statement attacking what he
 called the "U.S. peace talks swindle."
 Ambassador Wang repeated that China would

 C. Those Chinese protests last week about... recent
 violations of Chinese air space did not have
 any threats of counter-action. For all the
 bluster of Chinese propaganda, Peking's
 reaction to these incidents has been cautious.
 Sino-Soviet Relations
 III.  The Sino-Soviet dispute has flared up again,
 but there is no indication that this marks a
 significant change in relations between the
 two countries.
 A.   Mass demonstrations by Red Guards outside
 the Soviet Embassy in Peking on August
 29th and 30th were evidently intended
 as a reply to a Soviet diplomatic note
 delivered on August 26th which had pro-
 tested earlier "acts of hooliganism" com-
 mitted by the Red Guards in the vicinity
 of the embassy.
 1.   The Chinese took care, however, to
 prevent the thousands of people who
 took part in the demonstrations from
 getting out of hand and damaging the
 Soviet Embassy.
 2.   This suggests Peking is not willing to
 push the Soviets too far.

 B.      Peking's most recent blast at Moscow
 was a People's Dail    article on
 September 8th, which accused Moscow
 of collaborating with the U. S. to

 I. ..  I feel I ought to call your attention to the
 situation on the border between Israel and Syria.
 A.    We have gotten so used to a state of high
 tension here that the reporting may have
 become routine.
 B.    At present, however, both countries have
 worked themselves into such a belligerent
 attitude that major incidents are almost
 a certainty.
 1.   This includes the probability of
 retaliatory raids by Israel.
 II.    Syria leads the Arab States as far as militancy
 against Israel is concerned.
 A.    The Syrians train and support Fatah,  (Fah-TAH)
 an Arab terrorist organization which has
 been making raids into Israel since
 January, 1965.
 1.     The Fatah gangs have been working
 from bases in Lebanon and Jordan,
 although these governments oppose
 the operations.

 2.    At first, Israeli reprisals for the
 terrorism were directed at Lebanon
 and Jordan.
 3.    Now the Israelis are taking a harder
 line toward Syria as the instigator
 of Fatah.
 4.    On July 14 Israeli aircraft attacked
 and destroyed construction equipment
 at the inactive Syrian water diversion
 project near Lake Tiberias.   This was in
 retaliation for Fatah activities.
 B.     The probability of new clashes is increased
 by the fact that the shaky Syrian government
 run by General Jadid (Jah-DEED)is pre-occupied
 with factional problems.
 III.    Both countries have made the necessary preparations
 to step up the level of military action.
 A.     Israel needs little preparation to launch
 a retaliatory raid in force.

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 I.    Today is a good time to take a look at the situa-
 tion in the Dominican Republic.
 A.   The last US troops--the rearguard of the
 Inter-American Peace Force--are scheduled
 to leave for home today.
 B.   From here on, the government of President
 Joaquin Balaguer is on its own.
 II.    There seems to be no immediate challenge to
 the regime's authority.   There is also, how-
 ever, no promise that Balaguer can establish
 a strong or stable footing over the next six
 months or so.
 A.   Many of the Dominican military are pres-
 ently sympathetic to Balaguer.
 B.   Nevertheless, the President is conscious
 of the need to consolidate his hold on
 the armed forces.

 organization plan.
 2.    On September 17th he fired the head of
 the air   force.   The new air force chief
 is just as conservative as the man who
 was fired, but he has pledged loyalty
 to the President.
 III.    So far, Juan Bosch and his left-of-center Domini-
 can Revolutionary Party have been relatively
 restrained in their opposition.
 A.    Relations between Bosch and Balaguer could
 easily become estranged.
 1.    Balaguer has already demonstrated a
 strong sensitivity to criticism from
 Bosch.
 IV.   The withdrawal of the Peace Force will probably
 lead to a step-up in terrorism and agitation
 by the extreme left.
 A.     The three Communist parties, however, re-
 main divided.
 B.     The Communists constitute a serious problem
 for Balaguer, but unless they make common
 cause with non-Communists, they will not pose
 a major threat to stability.

 LATIN-AMERICAN ROUNDUP
 Finally, if you gentlemen have the time, I have a
 series of brief notes on some of the hot spots in
 Latin America;
 THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS
 I.    In February 1967,  six ]ritish Caribbean ter-
 ritories  (Antigua, St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla,
 Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Grenada)
 will assume a virtually independent "Asso-
 ciated Status" relationship with Great Britain.
 The US Consul General in Barbados is concerned
 that this rapid British withdrawal may leave a
 political vacuum on the islands.

 BrtaitT?on November 30th this year; the date
 for elections has yet to be announced.
 III.   General elections are scheduled to be held in
 Trinidad and Tobago on November 7th with all
 indications pointing to victory for the.moder-
 ate   government of Prime Minister Eric Williams
 and his People's National Movement  (PNM).
 IV.   In Jamaica, where general elections will prob-
 ably take place in the spring of 1967, a
 horse race is expected between the ruling
 Jamaica Labor Party of Prime Minister Bustamante,
 and the opposition People's National Party.

 I.    Fidel Castro has resumed his normally active
 role in Cuba,  following a period of relative
 inactivity late last spring; his power position,
 based on tight security controls and the loyalty
 of his key military and security officials, re-
 mains strong.
 A.   Castro is worried about the continued failure
 of his regime to overcome the many critical
 economic and administrative problems on the
 island.
 1.   His increasingly bellicose actions and
 statements during the last nine months
 probably result from personal frustra-
 tion over these problems.
 B.   Castro dwelt at some length on the revolu-
 tion's shortcomings in a bluntly worded
 speech on 29 August.
 II.     Our special Cuba Team which checks out all re-
 ports of nuclear weapons in Cuba continues to
 conclude that there are no such weapons or de-
 livery systems on the island.

 I.   Panama's President Robles, in public and private
 conversations,  continues to voice optimism over
 the canal treaty, despite many problems still
 facing the US and Panamanian negotiators.
 A.     Robles'  recent statements, in which he in-
 dicated the talks were "going well," prob-
 ably are aimed at blunting the inevitable
 barrage of opposition criticism that will
 accompany the opening of the National As-
 sembly on October first.
 B.    Communist-led students and opposition groups
 will try to stir up trouble at the opening
 session of the Assembly; national holidays
 on November 3rd,  4th and 5th are also dates
 when the students traditionally clash with
 government security forces and stage anti-

 Carlos Ongania, is making slow progress in in-
 stituting the reforms which impelled the mili-
 tary to oust the Illia government on June 27th.

 A.   The regime's revolutionary momentum has been
 slowed by Ongania's methodical, deliberate
 pace and by strong criticism of his govern-
 ment's takeover of the country's eight na-
 tional universities.
 1.    This involved get-tough methods with
 students and professors who protested
 the move.
 B.   The government seems to be firmly in the
 saddle at the moment, but a few potential
 storm warnings are up.
 1.    Chief of these is the indication that
 some of Ongania's key military backers
 are beginning to squabble over policy,
 and jockey for power.
 I .   The Brazilian legislature looks ? 9.9-- percent cer-
 tain to elect Marshal Arthur Costa e Silva as

 A.   With that, Brazil will enter an interregnum

 turbulence and not much forward progress.

 Burnham and Finance Minister D'Aguiar.
 A.   We think the Burnham government probably
