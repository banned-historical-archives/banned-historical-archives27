HISTORIAN'S NOTE 
This monograph is based upon and primarily consists 
of a Memorandum for the Record, entitled "Paramilitary 
Action Against the Castro Government of Cuba: Record of," 
May 5, 1961, prepared by Colonel J. Hawkins, U.S. Marine 
Corps, who was detailed to the Agency, and as such, 
served as Chief of the Paramilitary Staff Section of 
Branch 4, Western Hemisphere Division. In this capacity, 
he participated in the planning and execution of the 
ZAPATA Operation, more commonly known as the Bay of Pigs 
Operation. 
Colonel Hawkins' paper records significant information 
concerning preparation for and execution of paramilitary 
operations against the Castro Government of Cuba and draws 
conclusions based upon this experience, which as a back-
ground and reference document, he hoped, would serve a 
useful purpose for the future. 
Although not written at the request of the CS Historical 
Board, this paper meets the basic requirements of a histor-
ical paper and has been included in the Catalog of CS 
Histories, as a segment of the WH Division history.

SUMMARY 
Colonel J. Hawkins, U.S. Marine Corps, has furnished in 
his Memorandum for the Record an account of the preparation - 
.for, the planning and execution of the paramilitary Opera-
tions against the Castro Government of Cuba in 1961. The 
period covered is the latter part of the Eisenhower Adminis-
tration and the first six months of President Kennedy's term. 
Basically, the theme is the paramilitary story and is intended 
to cover only these facets of the operation. It documents 
�the events leading up to, during and following the Bay of 
Pigs Operation of April 16, 17, 18 and 19, 1961. 
In recounting the facts, policies are reviewed on which 
the Task Force Headquarters, organized within the Western 
Hemisphere Division of the Clandestine Services of.CIA., based 
its plan for action. The Task Force contained staff sections 
for planning and supervision of activities in the intelligence, 
counterintelligence, propaganda, political, logistical, and 
paramilitary fields. The need for liaison with the Department 
of State and the Department of Defense was apparent from the 
beginning. It had been determined early in the Eisenhower 
Administration that the highest levels of government would 
determine policy governing the Cuba project; thus, constant 
liaison should have been mandatory. CIA was represented on 
the Special Group (5412), which reported to the President, 
[i] 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
and it was to this Group that CIA presented operational 
matters for policy resolution. 
No machinery existed for coordinating the project 
related work of governmental departments and agencieS other 
than .through the Special Group, during most of the life of 
the project. There was never a formal Task Force arrange-
ment.which included representation of all departments and 
agencies which were or should have been concerned, such as 
the CIA, Department of State, Department of Defense, U.S. 
Information Agency, and the Department'of Commerce. ,Instead, 
the project was the endeavor of CIA in liaison with other 
departments. 
Intelligence information and estimates had indicated 
substantial resistance within Cuba to the Castro regime, 
Agents had reported the development of a widespread under-
ground Organization extending from Havana into all the 
Provinces. Obviously, if the efforts of these disaffected 
Cuban leaders, with their followers and other sympathetic 
individuals in the country had been successful, the'effort 
would have been unnecessary. Realizing that it was not 
effective, and to circumvent Castro's plan to crush the 
guerrilla movement, action was begun in November 1960 to 
organize a strike force, the paramilitary part of which, for 
tactical reasons was divided into air and sea force operations.

This strike force would now begin'to recruit, organize, 
equip and train a larger ground force than the contingency 
force which was originally contemplated. The bulk of the 
attached paper describes in a wealth of detail the training 
camps (based in the U.S. and in friendly third countries) and 
support programs necessary for the ultimate implementation' 
of the operation. 
In a considered evaluation of the operation and in his 
Capacity as Chief of the Paramilitary Staff of Cuba Project, 
Colonel Hawkins sets forth aseries of conclusions, and 
presents realistic recommendations for future planning based 
upon his experiences which were often frustrating. He points' 
out in a disenchanted fashion, more in sorrow than in anger, 
that experience indicates that political restrictions upon 
military measures may result in destroying the effectiveness 
of such efforts. The end result is political embarrassment 
coupled with military failure and loss of prestige in the 
world. If political considerations are such as to prohibit 
Ado.> 
the application of those military steps required to achieve 
the objective, then such military operations should not be 
undertaken.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Paramilitary Action Against the Castro Government 
of Cuba; Record of 
1. PURPOSE. The purpose of this memorandum is to 
record significant information concerning preparation for 
and execution of paramilitary operations against the Castro 
Government of Cuba, and to draw conclusions based upon this 
experience which, it is hoped, may be useful for the future. 
2. ORGANIZATION WITHIN C.I.A. FOR COVERT ACTION AGAINST 
THE CASTRO GOVERNMENT. 
a. For purposes of this action, a task force head-
quarters was organized within the Western Hemisphere Division 
� of the Clandestine Services of the Central Intelligence Agency. 
This task force contained staff sections Aer planning and 
/supervision of activities

supervision of activities in the intelligence, counter-intelligence, 
propaganda, political, logistical and paramilitary fields. The 
undersigned served as Chief of the Paramilitary Staff Section. 
The line of command within C.I.A. Headquarters for control of 
the CUban operation was from the Director of Central Intelligence, 
Mr. Allen Dulles, to the Deputy Director (Plans), Mr. Richard M. 
Bissell, to the Chief, Western Hemisphere Division, Mk. J. C. 
King, to the Chief of the Task Force, Mr. Jacob D. Esterline. 
b. The Task Force Headquarters did not include an 
integral air staff section, although air activity was a con-
tinuing and essential requirement throughout the operation. 
The Air Staff, with its headquarters in a separate building 
remote from Task Force Headquarters, was responsible directly 
to the Deputy Director (Plans), although in October, 1960, 
the Chief of the Air Section, in addition to his other duties, 
was placed under the direction of the Task Force Chief for 
matters concerning the project. 
c. Major field activities as finally established 
included: 
(1) A forward operating base at Miami, Florida, 
with a satellite communications center for relay of communica-
tions between Headquarters and the field and facilities in the 
Florida Keys for launching boat operations to Cuba. Recruiting 
was handled by the Miami Base. 
(2) A base at the former Opa Locka Naval Air 
Station, which was used for storage of arms and munitions 
and for originating "black" passenger flights to Guatemala 
with Cuban recruits. 
(3) An infantry training base and an air base 
in Southwestern Guatemala.

(4) An air and staging base at Puerto Cabezas, 
(5) Air facilities at Eglin Air Force Base for 
flights to Guatemala and Nicaragua. 
(6) A training base at Belle Chase Naval Ammunition 
Orleans (used briefly in March and April, 1961).

(7) A small maritime training base at Vieques, 
Puerto Rico. 
d. The Chief of the Task Force did not exercise 
command over field activities, and had authority to release 
cables concerning operational matters to the Forward Operating 
Base in Miami only. Cables and other directives to the field 
were normally released at the level of Chief, Western Hemisphere 
Division, while some directives dealing with major policy 
questions were released at the still higher level of the Deputy 
Director (Plans). The Chief of the Air Section was authorized 
to release air operational cables to any field activity, and 
in that sense had greater authority than the Task Force Chief, 
himself. 
e. An additional echelon of command and control was 
interposed betweeriiieadvities in foreign 
countries in that  in each country (W(1) 
  the responsibility(b)(3) 
for all C.I.A. activity within that country, including in 
particular, the responsibility for liaison with the host 
government. Communications personnel and facilities were 
provided by the C.I.A. Office of Communications, under the 
Deputy Director (Support), one of the three major subdivisions 
of C.I.A. Headquarters. The Deputy Director (Support) also 
provided logistical support for the oper4Ition. 
f. �The Paramilitary Staff Section of the Task Force 
included subdivisions for intelligence, logistics, maritime 
operations, internal resistance operations and military 
operations. The table of organization prolAdcd a staff of 
37 officers, but the average strength was about 24 of whom 
6 were military. The undersigned, as chief of this staff 
section, had no command authority nor authority to release 
cables or other directives to the field. 
3. ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURES AT HIGHER LEVELS OF 
GOVERNMENT FOR DETERMINATION OF POLICY GOVERNING THE PROJECT. 
a. The Special Group (5412). 
(1) During the administration of President 
Eisenhower, this Group normally met once a week to consider 
matters concerning covert activity in various parts of the

world, including Cuba. Principal members of this Group were the 
Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, 
Mr. Gray;, the Deputy Secretary of Defense,. Mr. Douglas; the 
Director of Central Intelligence, Mr. Dulles; and, the Under Secte, 
tary of State for Political Affairs, Mr. Merchant. The Department 
of Defense was represented for a time during the life of the Cuban 
project by the Assistant Secretary for International Security 
Affairs, Mr. Erwin. 'Other representatives of Departments and 
Agencies concerned met from time to time with the Group. Mt. Thomas 
Mann, the Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs, 
attended on occasion when Cuba was to be discussed. 
(2) It was to this Group that policy matters con-
cerning Cuban operations were submitted by the C.I.A. for resolu-
tion during the previous administration. 
(3) In regard to the Cuban project, the Special 
Group proved to be a slow and indecisive vehicle for determination 
of policy. It did not have authority itself to make important 
policy decisions, nor did it have a formalized procedure for 
reaching an agreed Group position on any given question. Disagree-
ment by one member of the Group could prevent approval of a pro-
posed action. Proceedings were verbal, and no master record of 
minutes was kept. Instead, each Department or Agency kept its own 
minutes as desired, and sometimes there were misunderstandings 
later as to just what had been said or agreed upon at previous 
meetings. No written, signed policy directives were ever forth-
coming after Group meetings for guidance of the Cuban project 
within C.I.A. In fact, throughout the life of the project there 
were no written policy directives approved at the national level 
to guide the project other than the original policy paper approved 
by the President on 17 March 1960, whichAvas general in content. 
b. Liaison with Department of Defense. The point of 
contact for C.I.A. within the Department of Defense for Cuban 
matters was the Office of Special Operations until 4 January 1961. 
At that time, a special committee headed by Brigadier General ' 
D. W. Gray, U. S. Army, was established within the Joint Staff 
for purpose of liaison with C.I.A. in regard to the Cuba project. 
c. Coordination of Governmental Departments and 
Agencies. No machinery existed for this purpose, other than 
the Special Group, during most of the life of the project, 
although for a time during the previous administration

OM, 
Ambassador Willauer was appointed by the President to serve as 
a coordinator of the Department of State and the C.I.A. There 
WAS never a formal task force arrangement including representa-
tion of all Departments and Agencies which were or should have 
been concerned, such as the C.I.A., Department of State,.Depart-
ment of Defense, U. S. Information Agency, and the Department of 
Commerce. Instead, the project was 4 more or less exclusive 
endeavor of C.I.A., in liaison with other Departments. 
d. Policy Determination During the Present Administration. 
During the present Administration, policy 'questions concerning 
the Cuba project were considered directly by the President himself 
in meetings which normally included, among others, the Secretary , 
of State, Secretary of Defense, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, Director of Central Intelligence, and the Assistant to the 
President for National Security Affairs. 
4, EVOLUTION OF PARAMILITARY CONCEPTS. 
. a. The only approved, written policy governing 
paramilitary action against Cuba is contained in paragraph 2d 
of the Policy Paper approved by the President on 17 March 1960. 
This paragraph is quoted as follows: 
"d. Preparations have already been made for the 
development of an adequate paramilitary force outside of Cuba, 
together with mechanisms for the necessary logistic support of 
covert military operations on the Island. Initially a cadre 
of leaders will be 'recruited after careful screening and trained 
as paramilitary instructors. In a second,phase a number of 
paramilitary cadres will be trained at secure locations outside 
of the U. S. so as to be available for immediate deployment into 
Cuba to organize, train and lead resistance forces recruited 
there both before and after the establishment of one or more 
active centers of resistance. The creation of this capability 
will require a minimum of six months and probably closer to 
eight. In the meanwhile, a limited air capability for resupply 
and for infiltration and exfiltration already exists under 
C.I.A. control and can be rather easily expanded if and when 
the situation required. Within two months it is hoped to 
parallel this with a small air resupply capability under deep 
cover as a commercial operation in another country."

b. Early concepts for paramilitary action to implement 
this approved policy involved: 
(1) The recruitment, organization and training of 
a number of CUban paramilitary �agent teams These teams were 
to include radio operators and personnel for the development 
and direction of intelligence, sabotage, propaganda, political. 
and guerrilla activity within the target country. 
(2) The introduction of these agent teams into 
the target country by clandestine or legal means. 
(3) The development within the target country,' 
through the medium of agents, of a large scale resistance 
movement, including sabotage, propaganda, political, and 
guerrilla activity. 
(4) The organization and training of a Cuban air 
transport unit for use in supply overflights and other air 
operations. 
(5) The supply of military arms and equipment 
to guerrilla and other resistance organizations by air drop 
or maritime delivery. 
(6) The organization and training of a Cuban 
tactical air force equipped with B-26 light bombers. 
c. Action was undertaken immediately to implement all 
of the above plans. Consideration was als2.�given to the 
possibility of forming a small infantry force (200 to 300 men) 
for contingency employment in conjunction with other paramilitary 
operations. 
d. During the period June through October, 1960, as 
the Soviet Bloc poured over 40,000 tons of military equipment 
into Cuba and Castro organized and equipped large forces of 
militia and established an effective Communist-style security 
system, the paramilitary staff studied the possibility of 
organizing an assault force of greater strength than the small 
contingency force previously planned. It was contemplated that 
pprove . 2024/11

-7-
this force would be landed in Cuba after effective resistance 
activity, including active guerrilla forces, had been developed. 
It should be noted that the guerrilla forces were operating 
successfully in the Escambray Mountains during this period. It 
was visualized that the landing of the assault force, after 
widespread resistance activity had been created, would, 
precipitate general uprisings and widespread defection among 
Castro's armed forces which could contribute materially to his 
overthrow. 
e. The concept for employment of the force in an 
amphibious/airborne assault was discussed at meetings, of the 
Special Group during November and December. The Group took 
no definite position on ultimate employment of such a force 
but did not oppose its continued development for possible 
employment. President Eisenhower was briefed on the concept 
in late November by C.I.A. representatives. The President 
indicated that he desired vigorous continuation of all activities 
then in progress by all Departments concerned. 
5. RESULTS OF THE INTERNAL RESISTANCE PROGRAMt SEPTIMER 
1960 to APRIL 1961. 
a. Introduction of Paramilitary Agents. Seventy 
trained paramilitary, agents, including nineteen radio operators, 
were introduced into the target country. Seventeen radio 
operators succeeded in establishing communication circuits with 
C.I.A. Headquarters, although a number were later captured or 
lost their equipment. 
b. Air Supply Operations. Thesewoperations were not 
successful. Of 27 missions attempted only 4 achieved desired 
results. The Cuban pilots demonstrated early that they did 
not have the required capabilities for this kind of operation. 
A request for authority to use American contract pilots for 
these missions was denied by the Special Group, although 
authority to hire pilots for possible eventual use was granted. 
c. �Sea Supply Operations. These operations achieved 
considerable success. Boats plying between Miami and Cuba 
delivered over 40 tons of military arms, explosives and equip-
ment, and infiltrated/exfiltrated a large number of personnel. 
Some of the arms delivered were used for partially equipping 
a 400 man guerrilla force which operated for a considerable

:,14..,r4 � 
time in the Escambray Mountains of Las Villas Province. Much 
of the sabotage activity conducted in Havana and elsewhere was 
performed with materials supplied in this manner. 
d. Development of Guerrilla Activity. Agents introduced 
into Cuba succeeded in developing a widespread underground 
organization extending from Havana into all of the Provinces. 
However, there was no truly effective guerrilla activity 
anywhere in Cuba except in the Escambray Mountains, where an 
estimated 600 to 1,000 ill-equipped guerrilla troops, organized 
in bands of from 50 to 200, operated successfully for over six 
months. C.I.A. never succeeded in establishing a direct radio 
link with any of these forces, although some communications 
with them were accomplished by radio to Havana and thence by 
courier. A C.I.A. trained coordinator for action in the 
Escambray entered Cuba clandestinely and succeeded in reaching 
the guerrilla area, but he was promptly captured and executed. 
Other small guerrilla units operated at times in Provinces of 
Pinar del Rio and Oriente, but they achieved no significant 
results. Agents reported large numbers of unarmed men in all 
provinces who were willing to participate in guerrilla activity 
if armed. The failure to make large-scale delivery of arms to 
these groups by aerial supply was a critical failure in the 
overall operation. 
e. Sabotage. 
(1) Sabotage activity during the period October 
1960 to 15 April 1961 included the following: 
(a) Approximately 300,000 tons of sugar cane 
destroyed in 800 separate fires. 
(b) Approximately 150 other fires, including 
the burning of 42 tobacco warehouses, 2 paper plants, 1 sugar 
refinery, 2 dairies, 4 stores, 21 Communist homes. 
(c) Approximately 110 bombings, including 
Communist Party offices, Havana power station, 2 stores, 
railroad terminal, bus terminal militia barracks, railroad 
train.

(d)- Approximately 200 nuisance bOmbs inl 
Havana Province. 
(e) Derailment of 6 trains, destruction of 
a microwave cable and station, and destruction of numerous ' 
power transformers. 
, (f). A commando-type raid launched from the 
sea against Santiago which put the refinery out of action for 
� about one week. 
(2) These sabotage activities had considerable 
psychological value but accomplished no significant results 
otherwise. 
f. Communist-Style Security Measures. As time went 
on, the police-state security measures imposed by Castro became 
increasingly effective, and agents and other resistance elements 
were hard pressed to survive. Many were captured, including 
three of the most important leaders under C.I.A. control. By 
stationing large numbers of militia and police throughout the 
country, by imposing curfews, by utilizing block wardens and 
security check points, and by seizing control of real estate 
in the cities through the Urban Reform Law, Castro was able to 
restrict the movements and activities of resistance elements 
to a crippling extent. 
6. DEVELOPMENT OF THE STRIKE FORCE. 
a. Action was begun on 4 November 1960, to recruit, 
organize, equip, and train a larger gratin force than the small 
200 to 300 man contingency force originally contemplated. It 
was planned at that time that this force would reach a strength 
of about 1,500 men. As this "Strike Force", as it came to be 
known, was developed over the ensuing months, many difficulties 
were encountered as a result of slowness in recruiting, political 
bickering among Cuban exile groups, lack of adequate training 
facilities and personnel, uncertainties with regard to whether 
Guatemala could continue to be used as a base, and lack of 
approved national policy on such questions as to what size 
force was desired, where and how it was to be trained, and 
whether such a force was actually ever to be employed. Some 
of the major problems encountered are described briefly below.

b. Base for Training. 
(1) The base available in Guatemala consisted 
of a small shelf of land on the side of a volcano barely large 
enough for comfortable accommodation of 200 men. Camp 
facilities were non-existent until the Cubans themselves, under 
American direction, threw up a few rude wooden buildings. As 
the population of the camp increased, living conditions became 
intolerably crowded, posing a serious morale problem among the 
troops and threatening the health of all. The only approach to 
the camp was over a narrow dirt road which wound its way up the 
mountainsides. In the dry season, the trip to the camp from 
the air base at Retalhuleu required about two hours by truck. 
In the rainy season, the road washed out frequently and became 
impassable to wheeled vehicles, while the camp itself was 
literally engulfed in the clouds. In the autumn of 1960, 
supplies had to be hauled up the mountain with tractors. 
There were no areas for infantry maneuver, but weapons could 
be fired at the camp site. Mortars were set up in the company 
street and fired over the buildings of the camp into impact 
areas on adjacent ridges. 
(2) It appeared for a time in late 1960 that 
even this inadequate base would be lost, as the Department of 
State advanced the opinion that the presence of these activities 
in Guatemala would undermine the government of President Ydigoras 
and perhaps cause his overthrow. While the State Department 
urged withdrawal from Guatemala, it offered no alternative as 
to where the troops could be relocated. The possibility of 
using remote, unoccupied military facilities in the United 
States were raised, but this idea was opposed by the Department 
of State and was not approved by the Speetal Group. For a 
while, consideration was given to moving the troops to the 
C.I.A. base at Saipan, but this idea was abandoned on the 
valid grounds that the project would be delayed and logistical 
problems magnified. It was finally decided to remain in 
Guatemala, since this appeared to be the only possible solution. 
c. Instructor Personnel. The only qualified instructor 
personnel available for training at the infantry training base 
consisted of four CIA civilian employees until November, 1960, 
when two Army officers and one non-commissioned officer from 
the Project Paramilitary Staff at Headquarters were sent to 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
-11-
Guatemala as a stop-gap measure pending assignment of Army 
Special Forces training teams. These teams had been requested. 
by the Paramilitary Staff on 28 October 1960, but there were 
long delays while policy governing this question was established, 
and it was 12 January.1961 before the 38 Special Forces personnel 
reached Guatemala. It would have been impossible for C.I.A. to 
train the Strike Force without the assistance of these Army 
personnel. 
d. Logistical Support for Training. Most of the 
materials used for support of the infantry training base, 
including weapons, equipment and training ammunition, had to 
be lifted to Guatemala by air. This was a great logistical 
problem, considering the number of aircraft available and 
distances involved. Shortages of equipment and ammunition 
sometimes hampered training. 
e. Recruiting. 
(1) Recruiting in Miami was very slow until the 
end of 1960, as a result primarily of political maneuvering 
among the members of the Frente Revolucionario Democratic� 
(FRD), the political front for the project. Each member of 
the FRD desired to accept only recruits loyal to his own 
political group, and all members of the FRD objected to 
recruitment of any former Cuban soldier who had served 
during the regime of Batista. Thus, personnel with previous 
military experience were for the most part denied to our 
use. All recruiting stopped for about four weeks during the 
confusion of an abortive revolution in Guatemala in November. 
There was continuing uncertainty as to oitether sufficient 
recruits could ever be obtained to form a Strike Force of 
even minimal size until early January 1961, when 500 men 
had been obtained and recruits began arriving at a more rapid 
rate 4s a result of action taken to break the Cuban exile 
political barriers, which were delaying recruitment. 
7. PREPARATIONS FOR TACTICAL AIR OPERATIONS. 
a. Selection of Aircraft. The decision was reached 
to use the B-26 light bomber prior to the time when the under-
signed joined the project on 1 September 1960. Aircraft of 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807

-12-
this type had been distributed to various foreign countries, 
including some in Latin America, and would, therefore, satisfy 
the requirement for non-attributability insofar, as the United 
States was concerned. The Navy AD-6 was considered for a time 
as being superior to the B-26 for project purposes but these 
aircraft had not been placed in the hands of Latin American 
governments and, therefore, could not meet the non-attributability 
requirement. 
b. Tactical Air Base Problem. 
(1) The air base constructed by C.I.A. at 
Retalhuleu, Guatemala, was at too great a distance from Cuba 
(750 miles from the central part of the Island) to serve for 
tactical air operations employing B-26 aircraft. The possibility 
of using a tactical air base in Mexico or in the Bahamas was 
explored with negative results. For a time, the President of 
Mexico indicated a willingness to permit use of the air field 
at Cozumel for limited staging operations over a 48 hour period. 
This was, of course, unsatisfactory for project purposes. The 
British were understandably reluctant to permit use of their 
territory for origination of tactical air strikes in connection 
with a United States-supported venture when the United States 
itself was unwilling to make similar use of its own territory. 
(2) In October 1960, a C.I.A. delegation consulted 
with President Somoza of Nicaragua, who agreed to assist the 
project in any feasible way providing he received assurance 
from proper governmental authority that he would be supported 
politically by the United States if the vestion of Nicaraguan 
participation should ever be brought up Eir consideration by 
the Organization of American States or the United Nations. 
Such assurance was never given to the knowledge of the under-
signed, but President Somoza nevertheless permitted development 
and use of Puerto Cabezas as an air and staging base. 
(3) The use of facilities in Nicaragua was not 
looked upon with favor by the Department of State for political 
reasons, and for some months there was doubt as to whether the 
base would actually be used. Preparations at the base continued, 
however, and it was ready for use when the strike operations 
were launched in April 1961.

(4) The air base at Puerto Cabezas was within 
500 miles of central Cuba, within marginal striking range for 
the B-26 aircraft. 
c. Tactical Pilots. By the end of December 1960, 
ten B-26 aircraft were available to the project. This number 
was later increased to fifteen on recommendation of the 
Paramilitary Staff. Five Cuban B-26 pilots were considered 
proficient by this time, and six others were in training but, 
had not reached a state of acceptable proficiency. The 
undersigned expressed reservations in writing in January 1961, 
concerning the ability and motivation of the Cuban tactical 
pilots to accomplish what would be required and recommended 
use of American contract pilots in addition to the Cubans. 
This recommendation was considered by the Special Group, 
which authorized the hiring of American pilots but reserved 
the question of their actual employment for later decision. 
d. Air Crew Training. Adequate U. S. Air Force 
personnel were available early in the life of the project for 
training Cuban B-26 as well as transport pilots. About 150 
Air Force personnel were involved in the project, performing 
such duties as training, maintenance, air base management, 
logistical ferry work, etc. 
8. SEA FORCES. 
a. The acquisition of ships and craft for execution 
of the amphibious operation proved to be one of the most 
difficult problems encountered. How this problem was solved 
is described briefly in following paragrtphs. 
b. Landing...Craft. Four LCVP and three LCU, recon-
ditioned by the Navy, and C.I.A. ("1) 
personnel were trained at Little Creek, Virginia, in their (13)(3) 
use. The Navy moved these craft to Vieques, Puerto Rico, 
where the C.I.A. operators trained Cuban crews. Utilizing 
a landing ship dock, the Navy was to deliver the landing craft, 
pre-loaded with vehicles and supplies to the objective area for 
the amphibious operation. 
c. Transports. For acquisition of transports for 
troops and supplies, two possible courses of action were 
considered: 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release:,2024/11/12 C01410807 
-14- 
(1) To purchase ships outright and recruit 
Cuban crews for them, or 
(2) To charter ships. 
d. As an initial experiment with the first course, 
two LCI's were bought and refitted through a ship broker in 
Miami, and mixed crews, including American contract masters 
and key officers along with Cuban crewmen, were placed on 
board. The use of American personnel in this capacity 
required approval of the Special Group. As a result of 
the inordinate delays and difficulties experienced in 
readying these two ships for sea, the idea of acquiring more 
ships in this manner was abandoned. 
e. The way was opened to pursue the second course 
through contact by a member of the Paramilitary Staff with 
Mr. Eduardo Garcia, a Cuban national who, with his father 
and brother, owned a shipping company incorporated in Panama. 
Mr. Garcia agreed to charter any or all of the six ships owned 
by his company for project purposes. Five Garcia ships were 
eventually chartered for the operation, including two 1,500 
ton motor vessels and three 2,000 ton steamships. The civilian 
crews of these merchant ships were for the most part Cuban or 
Spanish. Mr. Garcia made adjustments of all crews, dismissing 
members who did not wish to participate in the operation or 
were suspected of being Castro sympathizers and replacing these 
with Cubans recruited in Miami. Prior to execution of the 
operation, each of these ships was furnished with six 19 foot 
aluminum boats with outboard motors for use as auxiliary 
landing craft. 
f. Later, two additional ships were chartered 
United Fruit Company for follow-up delivery of 
and equipment after the assault phase. 
EFFORT OF PARAMILITARY STAFF TO OBTAIN RESOLUTION 
OF MAJOR   POLICY QUESTIONS - JANUARY 1961. 
from the 
supplies 
9. 
a. By the end of 1960, the development of land, sell 
and, air forces for the amphibious/airborne assault had preceeded 
to an extent which permitted firm planning for conduct of the 
operation. The Paramilitary Staff by this time had developed 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
-15-
a concept in some detail for employment of the force, although 
the invasion area had not been finally decided upon. Several 
major questions of national policy having important bearing 
upon the operation were as yet unresolved, however. These 
were 
(1) Whether the national government would permit 
execution of the strike operation. 
(2) Whether the national government, if .agreeable 
to the conduct of the operation, would permit its execution 
not later than 1 March 1961, which was the latest date con-
sidered desirable by the Paramilitary Staff. 
(3) Whether adequate tactical operations would 
be permitted in conjunction with the amphibious/airborne assault. 
(4) Whether American contract pilots could be 
used for tactical and logistical air operations over Cuba. 
.(5) Whether the base at Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua-, 
could be used for tactical air operations and staging. 
.(6) Whether an air base in the United States could 
be used for logistical flights to Cuba 
b. In an effort to cause resolution of these questions, 
the undersigned, on 4 January 1961, forwarded to superior 
authority within C.I.A. a memorandum which outlined the current 
status of preparations for amphibious/airborne and tactical air 
operations against Cuba and set forth t1 requirement for' policy 
decisions on all of the questions listed above. Enclosure (1) 
is a copy of this memorandum. It should be noted in particular 
that the undersigned, in this memorandum, recommended: 
(1) That the air preparation commence not later 
than D minus I Day. 
(2) That any move to curtail the number of aircraft 
to be employed from those available be firmly resisted.

. . � 
-16-
(3) That the operation be abandoned if policy 
does not provide for use of adequate air support. 
c. None of these policy questions, in the end, was 
resolved in the manner recommended by the undersigned, except 
in regard to use of the base at Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. 
10. THE PREFERRED PLAN (TRINIDAD). 
a. Reasons for Selection of Trinidad as the  
Preferred Landing Area: 
(1) Extensive study for four months of the 
entire littoral of Cuba, including the Isle of Pines, led 
the Paramilitary. Staff to select the Trinidad area of Las 
Villas Province as by far the best area for purposes of the 
amphibious/airborne landing. This area offered the following 
advantages: 
(a) Good landing beaches with suitable 
routes of egress from the beach. 
(b) An excellent drop zone for parachute 
troops near a terrain feature which dominated the town of 
Trinidad. 
(c) Good defensive terrain dominating all 
approaches into the area: 
(d) Excellent possibilities of isolating 
the objective area from approach by vehitalar traffic. Mountain 
barriers protected the area from the north and west. The east 
flank was protected by an unfordable river with only two access 
bridges, one highway and one railroad, which could be destroyed 
by air or parachute demolition teams. The only other approach 
was along a coastal road from the west which crossed several 
bridges. Destruction of three key bridges could prevent the 
movement of truck convoys, tanks and artillery into the area. 
(e) The area contained a hard surfaced 
3,500 foot air strip usable by C-46 aircraft (but not by 
B-26 light bombers) and a port facility at Casilda.

Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
-17-
(0 The town of Trinidad contained a 
population of 18,000, offering the possibility of immediate 
expansion of the landing force by volunteers. The people of 
Trinidad and of the entire area of Las Villas were known to 
be sympathetic to the anti-Castro guerrilla activity which 
persisted in the Escambray Mountains for many months. 
(g) The objective area was immediately 
adjacent to the Escambray Mountains, the best guerrilla 
country in Cuba except for certain mountainous areas in 
Oriente Province of Eastern Cuba. If unable to hold a 
beachhead, the landing force would be able to retire to 
the mountains for guerrilla activity. In these mountains 
tanks and artillery could not be used against them. 
(h) Cooperation could be expected from 
guerrilla forces, estimated at 600 to 1,000 men, which were 
then operating successfully in the Escambray Mountains. 
(i) Expansion of activity in the mountains 
of Central Cuba offered the possibility of severing the island 
in the center. 
(2) Members of the Joint Staff, of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, in an independent study of Cuba arrived at 
the same conclusion reached by the Project Paramilitary Staff 
-- that the Trinidad area was the best possible site for 
landing of a Cuban insurgent force. 
b. Concept of the Trinidad Operation. The concept 
of the operation as developed by thetaramilitary Staff during 
January 1961, is contained in Enclosure (2). 
c. Evaluation of the Plan and of the Force by. the  
Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
(1) A team of officers of the Joint Staff 
headed by Brigadier General D. W. Gray, U. S. Army, evaluated 
the complete operation plan for Trinidad during the period 
31 January to 6 February 1961. This evaluation resulted in 
a favorable assessment of this plan by the Joint Chiefs of 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
-18-
Staff. Reference (a) is a report by the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff on their evaluation of the plan. 
(2) The report mentioned above recommended 
evaluation of the invasion force by a team of officers 
representing the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This was done at 
the training base in Guatemala in late February and resulted 
in a favorable evaluation of the force's combat capabilities. 
Reference (b) is the Joint Chiefs of Staff report of this 
evaluation. 
d. Major Features of the Plan:  
(1) Plan for Landing. The landing plan provided 
for simultaneous landing at first light on D-Day of two 
reinforced rifle companies of approximately 200 men each over 
two beaches southwest of Trinidad and the parachute landing 
of a company of equal strength immediately north of Trinidad. 
The remainder of the force was to land over one of the two 
beaches in successive trips of landing craft. 
(2) Naval Gunfire. Two LC1 each mounting eleven 
50 caliber machine guns and two 75mm recoilless rifles were to 
provide naval gunfire support at the beaches. 
(3) Tactical Air Operations. The plan provided 
for a maximum effort surprise strike (15 B-26) at dawn of D-1 
on all Cuban military airfields followed by repeated strikes 
at dusk of the same day and at first light of D-Day against 
any airfields where offensive aircraft were yet operational. 
Immediate post strike photography was provided for in the 
plan. Tank, artillery, and truck concentrations known to 
be at Managua were also to be attacked on D-1 as were the 
Havana power plants, in order to deprive the capital of 
power and interrupt communications. Naval craft in or near 
the objective area were also to be attacked. On D-Day, a 
beach strafe and a bombing, strafing attack on the parachute 
drop zone were also planned as well as attacks on three key 
bridges. Armed reconnaissance and all approach roads through-
out D-Day and thereafter was also to be provided. The first 
and primary objective of planned air action was to eliminate 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 001410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
-19-
completely all opposing tactical aircraft. 
(4) Scheme of Maneuver. The landing force was 
to seize and defend terrain features east, north and west of 
Trinidad dominating all approaches to the area. If unable to 
hold the beachhead, the force was to withdraw to the northwest 
into the Escambray Mountains to continue operations as a 
powerful guerrilla force supplied by air. 
11. POSITION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE IN REGARD TO TOF, 
TRINIDAD PLAN. 
a. The Secretary of State and the Assistant Secretary 
of State for Latin American Affairs consistently opposed the 
Trinidad Plan on the grounds that the operation would have the 
appearance of a U. S. World War II invasion and would be too 
obviously attributable to the United States. These officials 
expressed the opinion that execution of the Trinidad Plan would 
cause reactions adverse to the United States in Latin American 
and in the United Nations, and would possibly cause counter-
moves by the Sino-Soviet Bloc in Laos, Berlin or elsewhere. 
Mr. Rusk on one occasion stated that the possibility of air 
attack by Castro forces against the United States could not 
be discounted. 
b. Secretary Rusk and Assistant Secretary Mann 
objected in particular to the conduct of any tactical air 
operations. Mr. Mann took the position that there could be 
no tactical air operations unless the tactical aircraft were 
actually based on Cuban soil. He proposei,on one occasion 
that a landing be made in Oriente Province witnout air support 
and that an airfield be built by the landing force to receive 
tactical aircraft, whereupon air operations could codimence. 
12. REJECTION OF THE TRINIDAD PLAN. After careful 
consideration of the Trinidad Plan, the President decided on 
or about 11 March 1961 that it should not be executed, and 
directed that possible alternative methods of employing the 
Cuban forces be studied. It was the understanding of the 
C.I.A. officials concerned that any alternate plan produced 
should have the following characteristics: 
a. The landing should be made in a more quiet 
manner, preferably at night, and should not give the appearance 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807

-20-
of a WOrld War II type amphibious assault. It was desired that 
the operation insofar as possible appear as an uprising from 
within Cuba rather than an invasion. 
b. It would be necessary to seize an airfield capable 
of supporting B-26 operations, to which any tactical air operations 
conducted could be attributed. No tactical air operation's were to 
be conducted until such a field had been seized. 
13. THE STUDY OF POSSIBLE ALTERNATE LANDING AREAS. 
a. During the period 13 to 15 March 1961, the Paramilitary 
Staff, pursuant to verbal instructions from the Deputy Director 
(Plans), conducted an intensive study of possible alternate areas 
in which a landing could be made in such a way as to satisfy the 
limiting requirements mentioned in the preceding paragraph. The 
entire littoral of Cuba was again examined in the search for an 
airstrip capable of supporting B-26 operations, which could be 
seized and defended by the Cuban assault force. In particular, 
the Provinces of Oriente, Pinar del Rio, Las Villas and Matanzas 
were examined, and the Isle of Pines was re-studied. Asa result 
of this study, the Paramilitary Staff concluded that the only 
airstrips in all Cuba capable of supporting B-26 operations Ohich 
the Cuban force could have any hope of seizing and holding were 
the Soplillar field and a new field at Playa Giron) both in the 
eastern half of the Zapata Peninsula of Central Cuba. 
b. In accordance with the instructions of the Deputy 
Director (Plans), three concepts for possible operations were 
drawn up. These concepts, which in the short time available 
for preparation (about three days) could be developed only to 
the extent of sketching a tentative scheme of maneuver on an 
operations map and preparing brief notes, were based on the 
following areas: 
(1) The Preston area on the north coast of 
Oriente Province. 
(2) The south coast of Las Villas between Trinidad 
and Cienfuegos. 
(3) 
The Eastern Zapata area near Cochinos Bay.

rP.

c. It was recognized by the Paramilitary Staff that 
the first two concepts mentioned above did not satisfy the 
requirements for a B-26 airfield, and therefore could not have 
been executed within established policy parameters unless 
attempted entirely without air support. The Paramilitary 
Staff advised higher authority within C.I.A. at this time, as 
it had consistently done in the past, that no amphibious operation 
could be conducted without control of the air and adequate 
tactical air support. 
d. These three concepts were evaluated by General 
Gray's group from the Joint Staff. Their assessment, as 
approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was that of the three 
alternatives evaluated, the Zapata concept was best, but 
that none of the three alternatives was as militarily feasible 
or likely to accomplish the objective as the Trinidad plan. 
Reference (c) is the report of this evaluation by the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff. 
e. The Paramilitary Staff recommended the Zapata 
Plan to the Deputy Director (Plans) as being the best of the 
three alternatives, and the only one of these which offered 
any possibility of conducting tactical air operations within 
the limits of established policy. The Deputy Director (Plans) 
was advised, however, that some way would have to be devised 
to knock out Castro's air force before this or any other 
landing was attempted. 
14. THE AIR FORCE DEFECTION PLAN. 
a. In an effort to find some w acceptable to the 
Department of State and to the President in which air attacks 
could be conducted for the purpose of destroying the Castro 
air force, the undersigned with Mr. Bissell and his assistant 
Mr. Barnes, developed a plan along the following lines: 
(1) Prior to D-Day, a B-26 aircraft painted 
with Castro air force markings would be flown to Miami by a 
Cuban who would land soon after dawn and represent himself 
as a defecting pilot of Castro's air force. He would state 
that he, with certain companions, had executed a defection 
plot, and had attacked other aircraft on the fields from which 
they had flown.

Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
-22-
(2) At dawn on the day of the defection, B-26 
aircraft would attack the three principal military airfields 
in Cuba, where all fighters and bombers were believed to be 
located as 'a result of photographic reconnaissance. A 
limitation on numbers of aircraft to be employed was imposed 
by the Deputy Director (Plans), who reasoned that the Department 
of State would not accept a plan involving a larger number of 
aircraft than could reasonably be attributed to the defection 
plot. He decided to propose that a total of six aircraft be 
employed, with two attacking each of three principal fields, 
Campo Libertad, San Antonio de los Banos, and Santiago. The 
total number was later raised to eight on recommendation of 
the undersigned. 
b. It was believed that this attack, followed by 
dawn attacks on ID-Day against these and all other military 
airfields, would have a good chance of destroying all of 
Castro's operable fighters and bombers, which were believed 
(correctly) to number no more than from fifteen to eighteen. 
15. THE DIVERSION PLAN. 
a. The desirability of conducting a diversionary 
landing in an area remote from the main landing had long been 
recognized by the Paramilitary Staff. However, sufficient 
troops for this purpose could not be raised, it appeared, 
except at the expense of the main landing force which had not 
yet reached desired strength. A development in Miami in late 
March 1961, provided an opportunity to raise a small diversionary 
force. Nino Diaz, a Cuban exile leader in Miami, expressed a 
desire to lead a small force composed of4lis immediate followers 
into Cuba. It was decided to send Diaz and 170 men to the 
recently acquired training base at Belle Chase, New Orleans, 
where they could be organized, equipped and given minimal 
training. This was done in great haste, and the company was 
formed at Belle Chase over a period of about two weeks prior 
to its embarkation for the operation. 
.b. Arrangements were made by the Forward Operating 
Base in Miami for a Cuban vessel to lift Diaz's group to the 
objective. The plan provided for staging Diaz through the 
Naval Air Station at Key West and loading the force out of 
Stock Island in the Florida Keys.

Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
-23-
c. A beach 30 miles east of Guantanamo was selected 
for the Diaz landing. A C.I.A. paramilitary team with ten men 
and a radio operator were operating in this area, and this team 
was to be instructed to act as a reception party for Diaz at the 
beach. This team was in contact with a 100 man guerrilla group 
operating in the mountains adjacent to the landing area, and it 
was planned that Diaz would join forces with this group. Diaz 
was known to have a large political following in Oriente Province. 
16. THE FINAL OPERATIONAL CONCEPT SUBMITTED TO THE PRESIDENT. 
a. The final concept submitted to the President in late 
March 1961, provided for: 
(1) The defection operation, combined with surprise 
dawn air attacks on D-2 against the three principal military 
airfields. No more than two aircraft were to be visible at any 
one place at one time. 
(2) The landing of the Diaz group east of 
Guantanamo during the night of D-2. 
(3) The landing of the main force at three widely 
separated landing points in Eastern Zapata during the early 
morning hours of D-Day. The landing was to be followed by air 
attacks on airfields and other military targets at dawn of D-Day, 
by which time the airfield in the objective area was expected to 
be in friendly hands. These D-Day air attacks were to be 
represented, if necessary, as coming from the field seized in 
Zapata, although plans provided for having only two B-26 aircraft 
operate from that field, while the remaireter of the air force 
was to continue operations from Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. 
b. The President directed that all preparations for 
the operation, including the staging and embarkation of troops, 
should continue, but that actual execution of the operation would 
be subject to his final decision twenty-four hours before scheduled 
commencement. The President also directed that plans be formulated 
for diversion of the ships with troops embarked in the event that 
he should decide to cancel the operation. Pursuant to these 
instructions, C.I.A. planned to divert the ships, if required, to 
New Orleans or to Vieques, Puerto Rico, where the force would be 
disbanded in increments.

17. SUCCESSIVE DELAYS OF D-DAY. 
a. The date originally selected by the Paramilitary. 
Staff for execution of the Trinidad. landing Was 4 March 1961. 
This date was chosen on the basis �of the following factors: 
(1) The Government of Guatemala had expressed its. 
desire to have the Cuban force removed from that country not later 
than 1March. 
� (2) It was desired to execute the operation at the 
earliest possible date in view of the rapid military build-up in 
Cuba. Great quantities of military equipment, including field 
artillery, anti-aircraft artillery, and tanks, had been delivered 
to Cuba by the Soviet Bloc, and it was estimated that Castro's 
forces, under the tutelage of Bloc advisors, would soon achieve 
proficiency in the use of this equipment. It was also estimated 
that Castro could acquire a jet air capability by April, 1961. 
Unconfirmed reports were received indicating that crated MIG 
aircraft had been delivered, and by April, 1961 Cuban pilots 
known to be in Czechoslovakia would have had time to complete 
jet training. 
(3) It was desired to land in the Trinidad area 
before guerrilla forces operating in the adjacent Escambray 
Mountains could be eliminated by Castro's ever-increasing 
pressure against them. 
(4) The night of 4 March provided suitable conditions 
of moonlight to facilitate operations in the transport area in 
preparation for the landing at dawn. 
b. After rejection of the Trinidad Plan, the Paramilitary 
Staff recommended 3 April 1961, as D-Day for the landing in 
Zapata. Moon conditions would again be favorable at that time, 
and 3 April appeared to be the earliest date by which necessary 
operation and administrative plans could be prepared and other 
necessary preparations made for the Zapata operation. This date 
proved to be unacceptable, however, since it coincided with a 
planned visit to the United States by the Prime Minister of 
Great Britain. In view of this visit, the President did not 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
-25-
desire to conduct the operation before 10 April. That date 
was accordingly programmed, although it was made clear to all 
concerned by the Paramilitary Staff that the lack of adequate 
moonlight would increase the difficulty of the night landing. 
Later, D-Day was again postponed until 17 April in order, it 
was understood, to allow observation of further developments 
in the Laos situation and in the United Nations with regard 
to Cuban charges against the United States. The night of 
16-17 April would be in the new moon phase with no moonlight. 
18. FORCES AVAILABLE FOR THE ZAPATA OPERATION.

launchers; 9 flamethrowers; 5 M41 tanks; 12 23 ton trucks; 
one 3,000 gallon aviation gasoline tanker truck; one tractor 
crane; one dozer; 2 400 gallon water trailers; 11 k ton 
trucks and 9 k ton tractors. 
b. Air Forces. The Cuban Air Force, based at Puerto 
Cabezas, Nicaragua, included fifteen B-26 light bombers, ten C-54 
transports and five C-46 transports. 
c. Sea Forces. Sea forces included: 
(1) Two LCI, each mounting eleven 50 caliber machine. 
guns and two 75mm recoilless rifles. (These craft were for use 
primarily as command and naval gunfire vessels, although each 
carried a 1000 man paramilitary pack in its hold). Each LCI 
carried two high-speed boats. 
(2) Three LCU, each mounting two 50 caliber machine 
guns. 
(3) Four LCVP, each mounting a 50 caliber machine gun. 
*(4) Seven chartered commercial freighters (average 
2,000 tons). 
*NOTE: Freighters in the assault mounted two to three 50 caliber 
machine guns. Only four of these ships were to participate in 
the assault phase. The additional ships were loaded with follow-
up supplies for both ground and air forces. 
(5) One 165 foot Cuban Coaetal� steamer. 
19. MAJOR. FEATURES OF THE ZAPATA PLAN. 
a. Staging and Embarkation. The plan provided for 
airlifting Brigade troops less the airborne company, under cover 
of darkness, from Guatemala to. Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua; during 
three successive nights. Upon arrival, troops were to be moved 
immediately to the Puerto Cabezas dock near the airfield for 
embarkation before dawn. Supplies were pre-loaded in assault 
shipping at New Orleans prior to proceeding to Nicaragua.

-27-
b. llmsmt_c_o_11L_Ie0b'ective.. Ships of the task force 
were to proceed independently over separate tracks in order not 
to give the appearance of a convoy, and were to arrive at a 
rendezvous point about forty miles off the Cuban coast at 
1730 in the afternoon of 0-1. From this' point they were to 
proceed in column under cover of darkness to the transport area 
5,000 yards off the beach, making rendezvous at this point at 
2300 with the U. S. Navy LSD lifting the three pre-loaded LCU and 
four LCVP. One transport, escorted by an LCI, Was to continue 
independently into Cochinos Bay for landing troops at the head of 
the Bay. As a deception measure, two United Fruit Company ships 
were hired to enter Puerto Cabezas harbor during the night the 
assault shipping sailed. The presence of these ships plus the 
one follow-up Garcia vessel lying off the harbor would, it was 
hoped, conceal the fact that the operation had been launc�e(1. 
This deception was apparently successful, for available intelligence 
indicates that Castro was not aware that an invasion force had 
left Nicaragua until after the landing. 
c. The Plan for Landing. The plan provided for landings, 
commencing at 0200 17 April,. at three widely separated beaches as 
follows: 
(1) Red Beach. (Head of 
of beachhead). Two reinforced infantry 
were to land from one transport at this 
19 foot and four 14 foot aluminum craft 
Cochinos Bay; left flank 
companies, about 400 men, 
beach, utilizing six 
with outboard motors. 
' (2) Blue Beach (Playa Giron; center of the beachhead; 
about 18 miles from Red Beach). The main body, about 700 men, 
including two infantry companies, the her weapons company less 
detachments, the headquarters and service company, tank platoon 
and motor transport platoon, were to land here utilizing LCI' s, 
LCVP's and eighteen 19 foot aluminum boats from three transports. 
Reserve supplies (10 days) were to be unloaded at this beach. 
(3) Green Beach (Right lank of the beachhead; 
about 18 miles east of Blue Beach). One reinforced company, about 
200 men, was to land at this beach from an LCI utilizing one LCVP 
and the two launches available in the LC'. 
d. Underwater Demolition Team (UDT) Plan. UDT swimmers 
were to reconnoiter and mark each beach with lights prior to the 
landing of troops.

e. Naval Gunfire. One,LCI, mounting eleven 50 caliber 
machine guns, five 30 caliber machine guns and two 75mm recoilless 
rifles, was to support the landing at Red Beach, while the second 
similarly armed craft was to support at Blue Beach prior to 
departing that area for the purpose of landing troops on Green 
Beach to the east. 
f. Airborne Landing. The airborne company was to land 
at dawn by parachute from five C-46 aircraft in five drop zones 
for the purpose of sealing off the roads crossing the Zapata 
swamp into the beachhead area from the north. 
g. Scheme of Maneuver. 
(1) The beachhead area consisted of a belt of dry, 
scrub-covered land, about forty miles in length from east to west 
and from three to six miles in width, separated from the interior 
of Cuba by a vast swamp impassable to foot troops. The only 
approaches to the beachhead from the interior of Cuba consisted 
of three roads crossing the swamp from the north, and a coastal 
road leading to the east flank of the beachhead from Cienfuegos. 
Movement off the roads in the swamp area was impossible, while 
the coastal road from the east led through a narrow strip of land 
between the swamp and the sea. 
(2) The scheme of maneuver was designed to seize 
and defend positions dominating the exposed, canalized routes 
across the swamp and blocking entry into the beachhead at the 
narrow neck of dry land at the east flank. Outposts beyond the 
swamp on the three roads leading from theAaorth were to be 
dropped by parachute. 
h. Air Plan. 
(1) Dawn attacks on D-Day were planned against 
all airfields revealed by photography to have fighters or bombers 
still operational after the surprise attacks on D-2. Attacks 
were also to be launched at dawn on naval craft in or near the 
objective area and against other military targets. Two B-26 
aircraft, after completing their attacks, were to land on the 
airfield near Blue Beach and continue flying interdiction and

support missions, using ordnance which WAS to be promptly landed 
over the beach by an advance aviation party and fuel from the 
3,000 tanker to be landed early from an LCU. All available 
aircraft were to phase back to the beachhead in afternoon 
sorties for interdiction, close support and other attacks as 
necessary. 
(2) Enclosure (3) is the target list for D-Day 
extracted from the Zapata plan. Some of these targets were 
removed from the target list at the last moment in view of the 
injunction from higher authority that air attacks on D-Day would 
have to be more limited. The targets removed from the list were: 
Managua Military Base (where tanks and artillery were parked); 
Playa Baracoa Air Base (used mainly by helicopters and transports); 
Bauta International Broadcasting Station; Topes de Collantes 
Military Base. (Succeeding paragraphs describing the actual 
operation, will show that none of these attacks planned for fl-Day 
were carried out as a result of orders from higher authority.) 
I, Communication. 
(1) The internal radio communication system of 
the Brigade was similar to that of a reinforced United States 
infantry unit of similar size, but was more extensive in amounts 
of equipment and number of nets employed. Portable radios with 
a voice range of 30 miles were used for communication between 
Brigade Headquarters and the various companies of the Brigade. 
Nets for tactical and administrative purposes, mortar spotting 
and air-ground control were provided. 
(2) For communication with Headquarters in the 
United States and the air base in Nicaragua, the Brigade was 
equipped with two communication trailers which were to be landed 
from two separate ships. In addition, it was provided with six 
man-portable sets (RS-1) capable of communication with Headquarters 
in the United States or Nicaragua. Mechanical cifer equipment 
and one-time pads were available for encryption and decryption. 
(3) The command ship and alternate command ship 
(LCI's) had direct CW radio links with the United States and 
Nicaragua, and voice nets for naval command, boat control, and 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807

ship-to-shore liaison and logistical purposes. Tbe Brigade 
Commander could relay messages to the United States or 
Nicaragua through either of these ships. 
(4) Each troop transport was provided with a 
direct radio circuit to the United States and Nicaragua. 
j. Supplies. 
(1) Assault Shipping. 
(a) The equivalent of two basic loads of. 
ammunition for all units was deck loaded aboard the transports 
lifting the units concerned. Individuals were to land with 
three days emergency-type rations and all the ammunition they 
could carry. 
(b) Seven Vi ton trucks, lifted in the three 
LCU, were pre-loaded with ammunition of all types. 
(c) Paramilitary arms packs (arms, field 
equipment and limited ammunition for outfitting guerrilla forces) 
were available in assault shipping (2 LCI; ATLANTICO) for 4,000 
men. . 
(d) Ten days supply of Classes I, III and V 
was loaded in the holds of one of the assault ships (RIO ESCONDIDO). 
(2)- Follow-up Shipping. 
(a) One transport (LANE CHARLES) with ten 
days of supply, Classes I, III and V, was scheduled to arrive 
at the objective area on the morning of 1)1-2 from Nicaragua. 
(b) A second follow-up ship (ORATAVA) 
with twenty days supplies, Class I, III and V, for the landing 
force, was to be on call in the Caribbean Sea south of Cuba. 
This ship, in addition to the above, carried 21,000 bulk 
rations, medical supplies, aviation gasoline and 30 days aviation 
ordnance for the entire Cuban air force.

(c) A third follow-up ship (LA PLAYA) 
with arms and ammunition for 15,000 men, plus vehicles, 
communication equipment, medical supplies and POL was also 
to be on call south of Cuba. 
(3) Air Delivery. 
(a) Three days supply of Classes 1, III and 
V were available at the airfield at Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, 
for air landing or parachute delivery. 
(b) Paramilitary arms packs for 3,000 men 
were available for air delivery at three airfields in Guatemala, 
Nicaragua, and Opa Locka. 
(4) Additional Backup. Arms, equipment and 
supplies for 15,000 men were positioned by the Defense Department 
at Anniston, Alabama, as additional backup. Sufficient of the 
above for 2,000 men was prepared for air drop. 
k. Evacuation. 
(1) Establishment of a rear medical facility for 
receipt of casualties evacuated from the objective area was a 
problem which defied solution until a few days before execution 
of the operation. Authority could not be obtained for use of 
a facility in the United States. There were no usable facilities 
at bases in Guatemala or Nicaragua, and, in any event, the 
governments of those countries did not wish to have Cuban 
casualties evacuated there. 
(2) Finally, it was decided that the Department 
of Defense would establish a field hospital at Vieques, Puerto 
Rico, to be operational by M-5. This plan was abandoned, however, 
and it was agreed in the end that casualties would be evacuated 
by air ot sea to Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto Rico.

21. AIR STRIKES ON D-2 (15 APRIL 1961). 
a. The purpose of these strikes was to destroy Castro's 
tactical aircraft, all of which were believed from photographic 
interpretation to be based at San Antonio, Campo Libertad and 
Santiago. Three B-26 were programmed against each of the first 
two of these fields and two against the third. Each aircraft 
carried ten 250 pound fragmentation bombs, eight 5 inch rockets 
and full ammunition for eight 50 caliber machine guns. 
b. The attack was executed at dawn, as planned. 
Returning pilots reported destruction of 50 percent of tactical 
aircraft at Campo Libertad, 75 percent at San Antonio and 100 
percent at Santiago. The readout of photography taken immediately 
after the strike indicated that pilot reports were optimistic, 
and a conservative estimate was that only about 50 percent of 
Castro's original tactical air force of 15 to 18 serviceable 
aircraft had been knocked out. 
c. Antiaircraft fire from 50 caliber and 12.7mm guns 
was reported as heavy at Campo Libertad and San Antonio. One 
friendly aircraft was disabled and crashed in the sea north of 
Havana. Two other aircraft landed at friendly bases low on 
fuel. The aircraft and crews were recovered. 
22. THE DIVERSION OPERATION. 
a. The Diaz Group of 170 men was staged and 
embarked on schedule and proceeded to its objective area 
thirty miles east of Guantanamo in the Cuban coastal vessel 
(SANTA ANA) chartered for the operation. The Group failed to 
land during the night of 14/15 April as planned, however, 
reporting that difficulty had been encountered in finding the 
beach and the reconnaissance boat and two rubber landing craft 
had been lost. 
b. Prior to launching the Diaz operation, the radio 
man and several other members of the ten-man C.I.A. team which 
was to meet Diaz at the beach were wounded in an accident with . 
a hand grenade, and Headquarters contact with the intended 
reception party was lost. 
c. Upon learning of Diaz's failure to land, Head-
quarters ordered him to land on the following night, but again 
he failed to do so giving a number of excuses. The Undersigned' 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
-33-
decided at this time that the real reason for not landing was a 
failure of leadership, and it was believed that Diaz would never 
land as ordered. Accordingly, he was instructed to proceed to 
Zapata where he WAS to join the main force. Diaz did not 
immediately comply with these sailing instructions, but eventually 
reached the Zapata area too late for the operation. 
d. This abortive effort illustrated one truth in 
regard to the entire operation -- the forces involved were 
composed of volunteer foreign nationals, all based, with the 
exception of Diaz's group, in countries outside the United 
States, and consequently the United States exercised no legal' 
authority over them. All the Cuban forces except Diaz's, 
however, voluntarily complied with all instructions issued by 
C.I.A. Headquarters. 
23. THE AMPHIBIOUS/AIRBORNE OPERATION AT ZAPATA. 
a. Embarkation and Movement to the Objective. 
(1) These operations were smoothly executed 
according to plan. (See paragraph 19.) The ships formed 
column at the planned place and time and made rendezvous on 
schedule at 2300 with the Navy LSD carrying the three LCU 
and four LCVP, about 5,000 yards off Blue Beach (Playa Giron). 
The transport HOUSTON, led by the radar-equipped LCI BARBARA J, 
proceeded onward into Cochinos Bay enroute to Red Beach. 
(2) There is no evidence to indicate that the 
Cuban Government was aware of the approachof this force until 
the landing was commenced. 
b. Cancellation of the Air Attacks Against Cuban  
Military Airfields and Other Targets Planned for 0540R on  
D-Day. (See paragraph 19h.)  
(1) At about 2215 on the night of 16 April, I 
was informed at the Command Post by Mr. Esterline, the Project 
Chief, that these attacks had been cancelled by order of the 
President on recommendation of the Department of State. Upon 
hearing this, I immediately telephoned Mr. Bissell, the Deputy 
Director (Plans), who was at the Department of State, and 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
-34-
urged in the strongest terms that the President be immediately 
requested to reconsider this decision and that the possible 
disastrous consequences of cancelling these attacks be 
explained to him. I offered the prediction at this time that 
shipping, with the essential supplies on board, would be 
sunk, possibly to the last ship, on the following day, since 
it was known that Castro still possessed a dangerous fighter 
and bomber capability. I stated also at this time that if the 
decision to cancel the air attacks had been communicated to 
the Command Post a few hours earlier, I would have strongly 
urged that the shipping be withdrawn without attempting to 
land the troops. But as it was, the ships were already closely 
approaching the transport area off the beaches, and by the time 
a message could reach them, the landing operations would be 
underway. 
(2) Mr. Bissell, and General Cabell, the 
Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, conferred with 
Secretary of State Rusk about the matter, but did not see 
the President. It is my understanding that Secretary Rusk, 
after talking with General Cabell and Mr. Bissell, telephoned 
the President and recommended that the decision to cancel the 
air attacks remain unchanged. The President accepted this 
recommendation. 
(3) After it was learned at the Command Post 
that the decision had not been changed, a message was sent 
to the task force at 0149 warning that Castro's air force 
had not been destroyed. The task force was ordered to expedite 
unloading during the night and to sail all,transports, except 
the RIO ESCONDIDO, to the south at best speed. The RIO ESCONDIDO 
was to remain at Blue Beach to continue unloading its vital 
reserve supplies under protection of the guns of the two LCI, 
BARBARA J and BLAGAR. 
c. D.-Day Operations at Blue Beach (17 April). 
(1) UDT Reconnaissance. A reconnaissance boat 
with UDT personnel and the C.I.A. operations officer from the 
Command Ship BLAGAR, Ni7. Lynch, landed at Blue Beach shortly 
.after midnight and marked the beach with lights. A coral reef

about one-foot beneath the surface was discovered about 
100 yards off the beach. Members of the UDT team were 
forced to fire on a jeep which approached their position. 
Three trucks promptly arrived carrying troops who engaged 
in a fire fight with Lynch and his party. Lynch called for 
fire support from the BLAGAR, which closed to 400 yards and 
drove all opposition from the beach in ten minutes of firing. 
Lynch then called for troops to land. 
(2) Landing of Troops. 
(a) Troops commenced landing at 0100. 
There was no opposition in the immediate beach area, but 
about one hundred militia were encountered in the town of 
Playa Giron immediately inland. Seventy of these were 
captured, and the remainder fled leaving their weapons 
behind. Troops continued to land without serious opposition. 
(b) At daylight, a channel through the 
coral reef was located and marked, and LCU's began to land 
vehicles at 0600. 
(3) Enemy Air Attacks. Enemy air attacks 
against the invasion force commenced at 0630 and continued 
all day. B-26, Sea Furycand T-33 aircraft participated in 
the attacks, with no more than two aircraft appearing at any 
one time during the day. The BLAGAR shot down one Sea Fury 
and two B-26 (assisted in one of these kills by a friendly 
B-26). 
(4) In view of the enemy air attacks, the 
Brigade Commander decided to land troops scheduled for 
Green Beach with the main body at Blue Beach, thus avoiding 
the danger of loss at 'sea. By 0825, all troops, vehicles 
and tanks were ashore at Blue Beach. 
(5) Loss of RIO ESCONDIDO. This ship, with 
ten days reserve supplies on board was sunk by enemy air 
attack at 0930. All crew members were rescued. 
(6) Enemy air attacks against the ships 
continued as they withdrew to the south.

d. Operations at Red Beach. 
(1) UDT Reconnaissance. Mr. Robertson, the C.I.A. 
operations officer with the LCI BARBARA J, led a UDT team to Red 
Beach shortly after 0100 on 17 April and marked the beach. The 
reconnaissance party silenced enemy automatic weapons fire coming 
from the left flank. 
(2) Landing of Troops. Troops commenced landing 
without opposition, but encountered fifty militia immediately 
inland, forty of whom were captured. Several trucks which 
approached the beach within the first half hour were successfully 
attacked and driven off by gunfire from the BARBARA J. Captured 
militiamen offered to fight against Castro. 
(3) Loss of the HOUSTON. The HOUSTON was hit by 
rockets from enemy aircraft at 0630, and beached on the west 
side of Cochinos Bay. One infantry company, less its weapons 
platoon, was still on board. These men, with the ship's crew, 
went ashore but never reached the Red Beach area. 
(4) One enemy B-26 was shot down by machine gun 
fire from the UDT boat. 
(5) Combat Action. At about 1000, about 500 to 
600 militia attacked the Red Beach force from the north and 
were driven off with heavy casualties. Tanks accompanying 
this force were either destroyed or stopped by friendly 
aircraft. A tank and two ammunition trucks arrived from Blue 
Beach in time for action against the next attack at 1400 
by an estimated 1,500 militia. These trod, who arrived in 
open trucks and semi-trailers, were ambushed by the Red Beach 
force, employing the tank, 57mm recoilless rifles, 3.5 rocket 
launchers, machine guns, and other available weapons. Enemy 
troops were caught by this fire before they could dismount, 
and friendly survivors have estimated that fifty percent of 
these enemy troops were killed or wounded. The next attack 
came in the evening and lasted all night. Five enemy tanks 
were knocked out by the Red Beach force during the night.

-37-
(6) The BARBARA J was strafed by an enemy. 
Sea Fury during the day, and two engines were disabled. 
A near miss with rockets opened her seams slightly and she. 
began taking water. 
(7) Retirement to Blue Beach. On the morning 
of WA, the Red Beach force, being almost out of ammunition, 
retired in good order to Blue Beach, utilizing captured 
trucks, and took up positions in the Blue Beach perimeter. 
They were not pressed by the enemy during this retirement. 
(8) Cooperation of Civilians. Forty civilians 
in the Red Beach area volunteered to assist the invasion force 
and were employed as truck drivers and laborers. 
e. Airborne Landing. The airborne company landed 
in all but one of five scheduled drop zones at 0730. Light 
resistance was encountered. Little is known of further actions 
by the airborne company, except that the force which landed 
north of Blue Beach held positions successfully until iY-2, 
the final day of the operation. 
f. Continued Action at Blue Beach. 
(1) Air Supply. During the night of 17/18 April 
one C-54 drop of ammunition was made at Red Beach and three 
C-54 drops at Blue Beach. Three C-54 drops were made at Blue 
Beach during the following night, but only two were received. 
(2) Combat Action. Reports have indicated that 
the Blue Beach area was quiet during the morning of M-1, but 
the enemy attacked from west, north and east in the afternoon, 
employing tanks, artillery, and aircraft. The battle continued 
throughout the night of 18/19 April. 
(3) Attempt to Land Supplies. Orders were issued 
from Headquarters for ammunition and supplies to be offloaded 
from the transports CARIBE and ATLANTIC� into the three LOU 
which were to be escorted to the beach during the night of 
18/19 April. The LCU's were not able to rendezvous with these 
transports until the evening of 18 April. The LCU's were 
loaded and the run to the beach was coramenecd, but the BLAGAR

Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
�-38-. 
reported that due to the slow speed of the LCU's, the craft 
could not arrive at the beach until after daylight. Enemy 
fighters by this time were over the beach continuously during 
daylight hours, and it was considered a certainty that the 
craft would be sunk before they could reach the beach to 
unload. Accordingly, the mission was cancelled by Headquarters, 
and instructions for air supply during the night were issued 
to the air base in Nicaragua. 
(4). Evacuation Attempt, A message was sent to 
the Brigade Commander on 18 April stating that ships. and craft 
would be moved to Blue Beach to evacuate troops that night if 
he so recommended. He replied that he would never be evacuated, 
At 1300 on 19 April, the two LCI and three LCU headed for the 
beach, in accordance with orders from Headquarters, to evacuate 
troops, but the convoy reversed course upon learning that the 
beachhead had fallen. 
(5) Final Day of Battle (19 April). The enemy 
continued to press Blue Beach from three sides with tanks, 
infantry and artillery during the day. In the morning, a 
counter attack was launched to the west along the coastal 
road by about 90 men and two tanks. The tanks returned later 
in damaged condition, but the infantry force was not heard 
from again. In the course of the day's battle, ammunition 
supplies were exhausted, and at about 1600 in the afternoon 
organized resistance ceased. Survivors have stated that 
the lines did not collapse until all ammunition was expended. 
g. Summary of Friendly Air Actin. 
(1) p-Day. 
(a) Eleven B-26 were phased over the 
beachhead for close support and interdiction during the day. 
These aircraft attacked ground targets, sank a patrol escort 
ship (3 inch gun) near the Isle of Pines, and one aircraft 
attacked the airfield at Cienfuegos. Only three of these 
eleven aircraft returned to base. Four were shot down, while 
the remaining four landed at other friendly bases. Some of 
these four aircraft, and all the crews, were returned to 
base late the next day.

Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
-39-
(b) Four Four new B-26 arrived at Nicaragua 
from the United States that night. During the night, three 
B-26 were launched against the San Antonio airfield where 
D-Day photography had revealed the opposing aircraft were 
based. This mission was unsuccessful due to haze and poor 
visibility. 
(2) DA.' 
(a) Five aircraft flew missions over the 
beachhead during the morning and attacked ground targets. 
(b) In the afternoon, a highly successful 
attack was launched by six aircraft (two flown by Americans) 
against a 20-mile-long truck and tank column approaching Blue 
Beach from the west. Several tanks and about twenty large 
troop-laden lorries were destroyed by napalm, bombs, rockets 
and machine gun fire. (It is noteworthy that an enemy report 
intercepted on this date indicated that he had already suffered 
1,800 casualties, mostly from air attack.) 
(c) This column was attacked again during 
the night by six B-26. 
(d) Four additional new aircraft reached 
the base in Nicaragua during the night. 
(3) D1-2. 
(a) Five aircraft (four with American crews) 
were sent in early morning sorties over tte beachhead. Three, 
including two piloted by Americans, were shot down by T-33's. 
Additional sorties were flown during the morning as aircraft 
could be readied. 
(4) It is estimated that only three enemy T-33 
and two Sea Furies were left in action after D-Day. These 
fighters were sufficient, however, to keep almost continuous 
cover over the beachhead, making it almost suicidal to attempt 
operations in the area with B-26 aircraft, which were virtually 
helpless against fighter attack.

(5) It seems reasonable to conclude that the 
attacks on military airfields originally programmed for 0540 
on D-Day, but which had to be cancelled, would have had an 
excellent chance of eliminating Castro's offensive air 
capability or of reducing it to ineffectiveness. If this 
had been done, friendly B-26 operations could have been 
maintained over the beachhead area and the approaches 
thereto continuously, during the day, and ships could have 
unloaded the supplies needed to sustain the Brigade. This 
could have turned the tide of battle, since Castro's road-
bound truck columns proved highly vulnerable when friendly 
B-26 were able to locate them, and the Brigade, itself, 
was not defeated until its ammunition supplies were exhausted. 
24. RESCUE OPERATIONS. Mr. Robertson and Mr. Lynch, with 
five Cuban UDT men, operated from United States destroyers for 
several days after collapse of the beachhead and rescued twenty-
six survivors from the coastal area west of Cochinos Bay. 
25. INTELLIGENCE FACTORS. 
a. The ultimate success of strike operations against 
Cuba in causing the overthrow of Castro depended upon the 
precipitation by these operations of large-scale uprisings 
among the people of Cuba and widespread revolt within the ranks 
of Castro's armed forces. The invasion force was never intended 
to overthrow Castro by itself, and no representations were ever 
made by the Central Intelligence Agency that the force had such 
a potential. 
b. There was much evidence from alwilable intelligence 
sources, including agent reports and debriefing of persons 
recently coming out of Cuba, to indicate that the.country was ripe 
for revolt. An analysis of actual and potential anti-Castro 
resistance in Cuba made by the Paramilitary Staff, in March 1961 
is contained in enclosure (4). After this was written, reliable 
intelligence was received indicating that the entire Cuban Navy 
was plotting a revolt, which was to take place at about the 
same time as the planned invasion. 
c. The low estimate by the Paramilitary Staff of 
the fighting qualities and potential of Castro's militia was 
^ 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
-41-
based upon accurate knowledge of militia performance against 
guerrilla forces in the Escambray Mountains over a period of 
six months. Some of the guerrilla leaders from the Escambray 
were exfiltrated and debriefed by the Central Intelligence 
Agency after resistance in these mountains collapsed. There 
can be no queStion of the fact that the militia performed very 
poorly in the Escambray, and demonstrated ]ow morale, lack of 
efficiency and a marked reluctance to close in decisive combat 
even with small, poorly armed guerrilla forces. The guerrilla 
forces in the Escambray were reduced by seize, which cut off 
food supplies, and not by direct combat. 
d. The military proficiency demonstrated by the 
militia at Zapata indicated that great progress had been 
made in integrating Bloc equipment and in the training of 
Castro's hard-core Communist followers during the early months 
of 1961. There was also reason to suspect that militia 
operations were being directed by European military personnel. 
The tactics employed were Communist-style, and enemy voice 
transmissions in a strange tongue, not Spanish, were intercepted 
by the Brigade. Intelligence indicates that these "elite' 
militia forces suffered extremely heavy casualties during 
the three days of fighting, and they were not able to overcome 
the Brigade until the latter was out of ammunition as a-result 
of our inability to supply the force against the opposition of 
Castro's five remaining fighter aircraft. It would' seem 
reasonable to conclude that if the Castro Air Force had been 
eliminated at the beginning so that uninterrupted unloading 
of supplies could proceed at the beach and our B-26 aircraft 
could operate effectively, the Brigade would have had an 
excellent chance of breaking the hard-core thtlitia, which 
obviously was what Castro used in the bdttle. Casualties in 
the number being experienced by the militia (estimated 3,000 
to 4,000) ,could not have been sustained more than a few more 
days without collapse. The breaking of the hard-core militia 
would probably have been the signal for revolt of the Rebel 
Army and remaining elements of the militia, who were known to 
be of dubious loyalty to Castro. In this regard, it is significant 
that the 150 Militia prisoners captured by the Brigade offered 
to fight against. Castro, and the majority of able-bodied male 
civilians in the invasion area did likewise. It is also

significant that no known Rebel Army units participated in the 
battle, indicating Castro's lack Of. faith in their loyalty. 
It is also significant that Castro's Navy did nothing of 
importance against the invasion force, 
e. The theory that uprisings and revolt would 
be triggered did not receive an adequate test in the operation. 
Agents throughout Cuba were warned shortly before the invasion 
to make all preparations for action, but the exact invasion 
area and timing could not be revealed to them in view of the 
known propensity of all Cubans to tell secrets. There was 
also a possibility that one or more agents would, unknown to 
us, be doubled (controlled by the enemy). It would not be 
reasonable to expect revolts to develop within a period of two 
or three days which turned out to be the extent of life of 
the invasion force, nor could revolt be expected until the 
invasion force had demonstrated that it had a good chance 
of enduring on Cuban soil. There is conclusive evidence that 
Castro feared revolt in the fact that he promptly arrested 
30,000 persons throughout Cuba. One C.I.A. agent reported 
that 2,500 men had requested arms from him immediately after 
the invasion took place, but the invasion did not last long 
enough to permit supply of arms. 
26. POLICY RESTRICTIONS WHICH LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS  
OF PARAMILITARY OPERATIONS. 
a. The most significant policy restrictions which 
hampered the preparation for and conduct of effective para-
military operations are listed below. 
lor, 
(1) The restriction prohibiting use of bases  
in the United States for training, paramilitary forces. 
(Adequate training base could not be obtained in other countries.) 
(2) The restriction prohibiting use of an air  
base in the United States for logistical overflights in support  
of guerrilla forces and of the strike force when landed. (The 
Guatemalan base was the only base available for several months, 
until Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, was put into use shortly before

the invasion in April 1961. Both were too distant from the 
target for effective, large-scale logistical flights with the 
aircraft available (C-54 and C-46). Missions could have been 
far more efficiently flown and supported from the United States, 
with fewer logistical problems, and possibly with less 
publicity than that which resulted from Guatemalan operations.) 
(3) The restriction prohibiting use of American  
contract pilots for aerial supply of _guerrilla forces. (Cuban 
pilots demonstrated at an early date their inability to perform 
these missions. American pilots, on the other hand, have 
proved their ability in this field in many areas of the world, 
working with a variety of indigenous forces. The failure to 
supply guerrilla organizations was a critical failure in the 
overall operation.) 
(4) The restriction prohibiting use of a base  
in the United States for tactical air operations in support of  
the amphibious landing. (About nine hours were required to 
turn around a B-26 for a second mission over the target from 
Nicaragua, and pilots were physically unable to fly more than 
one mission per day. In the actual operation, numerous aircraft 
were forced to land in the United States or British territory 
due to fuel shortage, and were out of action during the critical 
period. From a base in Florida, the number of sorties flown 
could have been doubled or tripled, and fighter aircraft could 
have been used to protect the bombers. Location of bases in 
third countries also complicated security and logistical 
problems and increased the likelihood that use of the bases 
would be denied soon after commencement of operations.) 
Aloe, 
(5) The restriction prohibiting use of American  
contract pilots for tactical air operations. (Authority was 
granted to hire American pilots, but not to use them. Some 
American pilots were thrown into the amphibious operation 
during the second and third days as an emergency measure. 
Use of adequate numbers of highly skilled, combat-experienced 
American pilots in the initial air operations could have 
spelled the difference between success and failure.)

-44-
(6) The restriction preventilv use of more  
effective tactical aircraft than the B-26 bomber. 
(7) The restrictions preventing the full  
application of the tactical air power available. (The 
preferred plan presented by the Paramilitary Staff called 
for full-scale air attacks by all available aircraft on 
military airfields, as well as against tank, artillery and 
truck parks, commencing at dawn of D-1 and involving another 
maximum effort at dusk and continuation of full-scale operations 
on D-Day and thereafter. Pressure by the Department of State 
against the use of tactical air resulted in the watering down 
of this plan. See paragraphs 11, 12 and 14. The initial air 
strike on D-2 was made against three airfields only, and only 
eight of the fifteen available bombers were permitted to 
participate. 
(An initial full-scale raid by all fifteen 
of the available bombers would certainly have had a much greater 
destructive effect than the raid by eight aircraft, and might 
have eliminated Castro's tactical air force at one blow. 
(Restrictions on the employment of napalm 
also reduced the effectiveness of operations. Use of this 
weapon against concentrated aircraft, tanks, artillery, and 
trucks clearly visible in up-to-date aerial photographs could 
have been a decisive factor. For example, one photograph 
revealed a concentrated tank park with 36 tanks and a truck 
park with 150 trucks. Napalm could have eliminated these, 
as well as other tank, truck, and artillery parks revealed 
by other available photography. By limiting the number of 
aircraft in the initial surprise strike, and leaying these 
. important targets untouched, Castro was given the opportunity 
to disperse these concentrations. 
(Cancellations at the last moment, while 
the troops were already off the beaches preparing to land, 
of the air attacks planned for 0540 on D-Day against Castro's 
remaining tactical aircraft, doomed the operation to failure. 
See paragraph 23b. 
.(Restrictions which prevented the full  
application of available airpower in accordance with sound 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
-45-
tactical principles must be regarded as primarily responsible 
for failure of the amphibious operation.) 
b. The Department of State was the principal advocate 
of the restrictions listed above. The rationale of these self-
imposed restrictions rested upon what proved to be an unrealistic 
requirement, impossible of fulfillment under the circumstances, 
to conduct operations in such a way as to be non-attributable 
to the United States, or, at least, plausibly deniable. In the 
interest of non-attributability, the requirement for operational 
effectiveness was so completely subordinated that the end 
result was "too little, too late", and the United States had 
ta bear publicly the responsibility for a failure rather than 
the responsibility for a success. The price paid by the United 
States in terms of public clamor by our enemies was high enough 
to have covered the cost of additional measures that could have 
been taken to ensure success. It seemed to this writer through 
the many months of this effort, that the United States was 
trying to achieve a very important objective at a very small 
cost to itself, while it would have been in the national 
interest to act more boldly and openly and accept more risks 
as might be necessary to ensure that every needed measure would 
be taken to win the objective, which had to be won, and still 
must be won, and soon, if all Latin America is not to be lost 
to Communism. 
27. CONCLUSIONS. The following conclusions are based 
upon my experiences of the past eight months as Chief of the 
Paramilitary Staff of the Central Intelligence Agency Cuba 
Project: SAims 
a. The Government and the people of the United 
States are not yet psychologically conditioned to participate 
in the cold war with resort to the harsh, rigorous, and often 
dangerous and painful measures which must be taken in order 
to win. Our history and tradition have conditioned us for 
all-out war or all-out peace, and the resort tb war-like 
measures in any situation short of all-out war is repugnant, 
to the American mentality. In order to win the cold war, 
this inhibition must be overcome. 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01416807 
-46-
b. In a cold war paramilitary operation, there is 
a basic conflict of interest between considerations of military 
effectiveness on the one hand and political considerations on 
the other. Since in the cold war national survival does not 
seem to be immediately at issue (although this writer would 
deem that it is), political considerations tend to dominate, 
with the result that military measures are progressively 
restricted and subordinated. Experiences of the past few 
years indicate that political restrictions on military measures 
may result in destroying the effectiveness of the latter, and 
the end result is political embarassment coupled with military 
failure and loss of prestige in the world. 
c. Paramilitary 
conducted on a ration-card 
considerations are such as 
military measures required 
military operations should 
operations cannot be effectively 
basis. Therefore, if political 
to prohibit the application of all 
to achieve the objective, then 
not be undertaken. 
d. Civilian officials of the Government should not 
attempt to prescribe the tactics of military or paramilitary 
operations. 
e. For an effort of the kind made against Cuba, 
detailed policy guidance, in writing, is required from the 
national level. A national plan should be written at the 
outset, setting forth the responsibilities and tasks of every 
Department and Agency concerned. An organization must be 
provided for directing and coordinating the�Actions by all 
Departments and Agencies in the economic, political, psychological 
and military fields. 
f. In pursuing an operation of the kind conducted 
against Cuba, governmental machinery must be established for 
prompt, decisive resolution of policy questions as they arise. 
g. Paramilitary operations of any appreciable size 
cannot be conducted on a completely covert basis, and the 
requirement for non-attributability introduces tremendous 
complications in the accomplishment of what would otherwise 
be simple tasks. Since paramilitary operations on an increasing 
pproved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
-47-
scale will probably be required as we face years of cold war 
in the future, the United States should be prepared to operate 
more boldly and overtly in this field, as do our enemies of the 
Sino-Soviet Bloc. 
g. The Central Intelligence Agency does not have 
required organization, equipment, procedures, bases, �facLlities 
nor staff for the planning and conduct of paramilitary operations. 
It cannot conduct such operations without relying heavily upon 
the Department of Defense for personnel, equipment, supplies, 
facilities, and other support. 
i. Primary responsibility for all paramilitary 
matters, including the organization, equipping, training, 
operational employment and support of indigenous guerrilla 
forces, should be assigned to the Department of Defense, 
which has vast human and material resources and proper 
organization and procedures for accomplishment of these 
functions. 
j. All military operations of any kind, including 
those of a paramilitary nature, should be under the direction 
and control of the Unified Commander in whose area the 
operations are to take place. It would be advisable to form 
a special task force within the Unified Command, with representa-
tion from Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and C.I.A. as 
required, for conduct of paramilitary operations. 
k. Within the Department of Defense, the responsibility 
for ground paramilitary matters should be'dssigned to the Army 
Special Forces, since these brces are especially trained and 
organized for such missions. 
1. It would be advisable for all members of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff to attend meetings with the President 
and Cabinet Officers at which any military matters are to be 
discussed. It cannot be expected that any single military 
officer can advise adequately on all the technical aspects 
of air, sea, and ground warfare. The Cuban operation was 
essentially a seaborne invasion. Such operations are a 
specialty of the Navy and Marine Corps. Therefore, the Chief 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
of Naval Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps, 
if present at all meetings, would have been able to contribute 
invaluable advice at the proper time. 
m. A Communist-style police state is now firmly 
entrenched in Cuba, which will not be overthrown by means 
short of overt application of elements of United States 
military power. Further efforts to develop armed internal 
resistance, or to organize Cuban exile forces, should not 
be made except in connection with a planned overt intervention 
by United States forces.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/4 
SUBJECT: 
ENCLOSURE 1 
4 January 1961 
Policy Decisions Required for Conduct 
of Strike Operations Against Government 
of Cuba 
1. Purpose: 
The purpose of this memorandum is to outline the 
current status of our preparations for the conduct of amphi-
bious/airborne and tactical air operations against the 
Government of Cuba and to set forth certain requirements for 
policy decisions which must be reached and implemented if 
these operations are to be carried out. 
2. Concept: 
As a basis for the policy requirements to be pre-
sented below, it would appear appropriate to review briefly 
the concept of the strike operations contemplated and outline 
the objectives which these operations are designed to accomplish. 
The concept envisages the seizure of a small lodgement 
on Cuban soil by an all-Cuban amphibious/airborne force of 
about 750 men. The landings in Cuba will be preceded by a 
tactical air preparation, beginning at clewn of D-1 Day. The 
primary purpose of the air preparation will be to destroy or 
neutralize all Cuban military aircraft and naval vessels con-
stituting a threat to the invasion force. When this task is 
accomplished, attacks will then be directed against other 
military targets, including artillery parks, tank parks, mili-
tary vehicles, supply dumps, etc. Close air support will be 
provided to the invasion force on D-Day and thereafter as long 
as the force is engaged in combat. The primary targets during 
this time will be opposing military formations in the field. 
Particular efforts will be made to interdict opposing troop 
movements against the lodgement.

The initial mission of the invasion force will be to 
seize and defend a small area, which under ideal conditions 
will include an airfield and access to the sea for logistic 
support. Plans must provide, however, for the eventuality that 
the force will be driven into a tight defensive formation which 
will preclude supply by sea or control of an airfield. Under 
such circumstances supply would have to be provided entirely by 
air drop. The primary objective of the force will be to survive 
and maintain its integrity on Cuban soil. There will be no 
early attempt to break out of the lodgement for further offen-
sive operations unless and until there is a general uprising 
against the Castro regime or overt military intervention by United 
States forces has taken place. 
It is expected that these operations will precipitate a 
general uprising throughout Cuba and cause the revolt of large 
segments of the Cuban Army and Militia. The lodgement, it is 
hoped, will serve as a rallying point for the thousands who are 
ready for overt resistance to Castro but who hesitate to act 
until they can feel some assurances of success. A general revolt 
in Cuba, if one is successfully triggered by our operations,nay 
serve to topple the Castro regime within a period of weeks. 
If matters do not eventuate as predicted above, the 
lodgement established by our force can be used as the site for 
establishment of a provisional government which can be recog-
nized by the United States, and hopefully by other American 
states, and given overt military assistance. The way will then 
be paved for United States military intervention aimed at paci-
fication of Cuba, and this will result in the prompt overthrow 
of the Castro Government. 
While this paper� is directed to the subject of strike 
operations, it should not be presumed that other paramilitary 
programs will be suspended or abandoned. These are being 
intensified and accelerated. They include the supply by air and 
sea of guerrilla elements in Cuba, the conduct of sabotage opera-
tions, the introduction of specially trained paramilitary teams, 
and the expansion of our agent networks throughout the island. 
3. Status of Forces: 
a. Air. The Project tactical air force includes ten 
B-26 aircraft currently based in Guatemala and at Eglin Air 
Force Base. However, there are only five Cuban B-26 pilots 
- 2 - 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
ragattadkli 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 " 
available at this time who are considered to be of high 
technical competence. Six additional Cuban pilots are 
available, but their proficiency is questionable. 
It is planned that seven C-54 and four C-46 trans-
ports will be available for strike operations. Here again, 
the number of qualified Cuban crews is insufficient. There 
is one qualified C-54 crew on hand at this time, and three 
C-46 crews. 
Aviation ordnance for conduct of strike operations 
is yet to be positioned at the strike base in Nicaragua. 
Necessary construction and repairs at this base are now 
scheduled to commence, and there appears to be no obstacle 
.to placing this facility in a state of readiness in time for 
operations as planned. 
Conclusions: 
(1) The number of qualified Cuban B-26 crews 
available is inadequate for conduct of strike operations. 
(2) The number of qualified Cuban transport crews 
is grossly inadequate for supply operations which will be 
required in support of the invasion force and other friendly 
forces which are expected to join or operate in conjunction 
with it in many parts of Cuba. It is anticipated that multiple 
sorties will be required on a daily basis. 
b. Maritime. Amphibious craft for the operation, 
including three LCU's and four LCVP's are now at Vieques, 
Puerto Rico, where Cuban crew training La..progressing satis-
factorily. These craft with their crews will soon be ready 
for operations. 
The BARBARA J (LCI), now enroute to the United States 
from Puerto Rico, requires repairs which may take up to two 
weeks for completion. Its sister ship, the BLAGAR, is outfit-
ting in Miami, and its crew is being assembled. It is expected 
that both vessels will be fully operational by mid-January at 
the latest. 
In view of the difficulty and delay encountered in 
purchasing, outfitting and readying for sea the two LCI's, the 
decision has been reached to purchase no more major vessels, 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
but to charter them instead. The motor ship, RIO ESCONDIDO 
(converted LCT) will be chartered this week and one additional 
steam ship, somewhat larger, will be chartered early in February. 
Both ships belong to a Panamanian Corporation controlled by the 
GARCIA family of Cuba, who are actively cooperating with this 
Project. These two ships will provide sufficient lift for troops 
and supplies in the invasion operation. 
Conclusion: 
Maritime assets required will be available in ample 
time for strike operations in late February. 
c. Ground. There are approximately 500 Cuban personnel 
now in training in Guatemala. Results being achieved in the FRD 
recruiting drive now underway in Miami indicate that extraordinary 
measures may be required if the ranks of the Assault Brigade are 
to be filled to its planned strength of 750 by mid-January. 
Special recruiting teams comprised of members of the Assault 
Brigade are being brought to Miami to assist in recruiting 
efforts in that city and possibly in other countries, notably 
Mexico and Venezuela. All recruits should be available by mid-
January to allow at least -four to six weeks of training prior to 
commitment. 
The Assault Brigade has been formed into its basic 
organization (a quadrangular infantry battalion, including four 
rifle companies, and a weapons company). Training is proceeding 
to the extent possible with the limited number of military in-
structors available. This force cannot be adequately trained for 
combat unless additional military trainers are provided. 
Conclusions: 
(1) It is probable that the Assault Brigade can reach 
its planned strength of 750 prior to commitment, but it is 
possible that upwards of 100 of these men will be recruited too 
late for adequate training. 
(2) Unless U. S. Army Special Forces training teams 
as requested are sent promptly to Guatemala, the Assault Brigade 
cannot be readied for combat by late February as planned and 
desired. 
(3) The Assault Brigade- should not be committed to 
action until it hai received at least four and preferably six

mood 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
weeks of training under supervision of the U. S. Army teams. 
This means that the latter half of February is the earliest 
satisfactory time for the strike operation. 
4. Major Policy Questions Requiring Resolution: 
In order that planning and preparation for the strike 
operation may proceed in an orderly manner and correct posi-
tioning of hundreds of tons of supplies and equipment can be 
effected, a number of firm decisions concerning major questions 
of policy are required. These are discussed below. 
The Concept Itself. 
2.111pcj_iss3.-on. The question of whether the incoming 
administration of President-elect Kennedy will concur in the 
conduct of the strike operations outlined above needs to be 
resolved at the earliest possible time. If these operations 
are not to be conducted, then preparations for them should 
cease forthwith in order to avoid the needless waste of great 
human effort and many millions of dollars. Recruitment of 
additional Cuban personnel should be stopped, for every new 
recruit who is not employed in operations as intended presents 
an additional problem of eventual disposition. 
Recommendation. That the Director of Central 
Intelligence attempt to determine the position of the President-
Elect and his Secretary of State-Designate in regard to this 
question as soon as possible. 
b. Timing of the Operation. 
If Army Special Forces tralang teams are made 
available and dispatched to Guatemala by mid-January, the 
Assault Brigade can achieve acceptable readiness for combat 
during the latter half of February, 1961. All other required 
preparations can be made by that same time. The operation 
should be launched during this period. Any delay beyond 
I March, 1961, would be inadvisable for the following reasons: 
(1) It is doubtful that Cuban forces can be main. 
tamed at our Guatemalan training base beyond 1March 1961. 
Pressure upon the Government of Guatemala may become unmanageable 
if Cuban ground troops are not removed by that date. 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
(2) Cuban trainees cannot be held in training 
for much longer.. Many have been in the camp for months under 
most austere and restrictive conditions. They are becoming 
restive and if not committed to action soon there will probably 
be a general lowering of morale. Large-scale desertions could 
occur with attendant possibilities of surfacing the entire 
program. 
(3) While the support of the Castro Government 
by the Cuban populace is deteriorating rapidly and time is 
working in our favor in that sense, it is working to our dis-
advantage in a military sense. Cuban jet pilots are being 
being trained in Czechoslovakia and the appearance of modern 
radar throughout Cuba indicates a strong possibility that Castro 
may soon have an all-weather jet intercept capability. His 
ground forces have received vast quantities of military equip-
ment from the Bloc countries, including medium and heavy tanks, 
field artillery, heavy mortars and anti-aircraft artillery. 
Bloc technicians are training his forces in the use of this 
formidable equipment. Undoubtedly, within the near future . 
Castro's hard core of loyal armed forces will achieve technical 
proficiency in the use of available modern weapons. 
(4) Castro is making rapid progress in establishing 
a Communist-style police state which will be difficult to unseat 
by any means short of overt intervention by U. S. military forces. 
Recommendation. That the strike operation be 
conducted in the latter half of February, and not later than 
1 March 1961. 
c. Air Strikes. 
The question has been raised in some quarters as 
to whether the amphibious/airborne operation could not be 
mounted without tactical air preparation or support or with 
minimum air support. It is axiomatic in amphibious operations 
that control of air and sea in the objective area is absolutely 
required. The Cuban Air Force and naval vessels capable of 
opposing our landing Must be knocked out or neutralized before . 
our amphibious shipping makes its final run into the beach. If 
this is not done, we will be courting disaster. Also, since our 
invasion force is very small in comparison to forces which may 
be thrown against it, we must compensate for numerical inferiority 
by effective tactical air support not only during the landing but 
thereafter as long as the force remains in combat. It is 
00 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
essential that opposing military targets such as artillery 
parks, tank parks, supply dumps, military convoys and troops 
in the field be brought under effective and continuing air 
attack. Psychological considerations also make such attacks 
essential. The spectacular aspects of air operations will go 
far toward producing the uprising in Cuba that we seek. 
Recommendations. 
(1) That the air preparation commence not later 
than dawn of D minus I Day. 
(2) That any move to curtail the number of air-
craft to be employed from those available be firmly resisted. 
(3) That the operation be abandoned if policy , 
does not provide for use of adequate tactical air support. 
d. Use of American Contract Pilots. 
The paragraph above outlines the requirement for 
precise and effective air strikes, while an earlier paragraph 
points up the shortage of qualified Cuban pilots. It is very 
questionable that the limited number of Cuban B-26 pilots 
available to us can produce the desired results unless augmented 
by highly skillful American contract pilots to serve as .section 
and flight leaders in attacks against the more critical targets. 
The Cuban pilots are inexperienced in war and of limited tech-
nical competence in navigation and gunnery. There is reason 
also to suspect that they may lack the motivation to take the 
stern measures required against targets in their own country. 
It is considered that the success of the- operation will be jeo-
pardized unless a few American contract B-26 pilots are employed. 
With regard to logistical air operations, the 
shortage of Cuban crews has already been mentioned. There is no 
prospect of producing sufficient Cuban C-54 crews to man the 
seven C-54 aircraft to be used in the operation. Our experience 
to date with the Cuban transport crews has left much to be de-
sired. It is concluded that the only satisfactory solution to 
the problem of air logistical support of the strike force and other 
forces joining it will be to employ a number of American contract 
crews.

Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Recommendation. 
That policy approval be obtained for use of 
American contract crews for tactical and transport aircraft 
in augmentation of the inadequate number of Cuban crews 
available. 
e. Use of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. 
The airfield at Puerto Cabezas is essential for 
conduct of the strike operation unless a base is made available 
in the United States. Our air base in Guatemala is 800 miles 
from central Cuba--too distant for 13-26 operations and for air 
supply operations of the magnitude required, using the C-46 and 
C-54 aircraft. Puerto Cabezas is only 500 miles from central 
Cuba--acceptable, although too distant to be completely de-
sirable, for B-26 and transport operations. 
Puerto Cabezas will also serve as the staging area 
for loading assault troops into transports much more satis-
factorily than Puerto Barrios, Guatemala, which is exposed to 
hostile observation and lacks security. .It is planned that . 
troops will be flown in increments from Guatemala to Puerto 
Cabezas, placed in covered trucks, loaded over the docks at 
night into amphibious shipping, which will then immediately 
retire to sea. 
Conclusion: 
The strike operation cannot be conducted unless 
the Puerto Cabezas air facility is available for our use, or 
unless an air base in the United States Is made available. 
Recommendation. 
That firm policy be obtained for use of Puerto 
Cabezas as an air strike base and staging area. 
f. Use of U. S. Air Base for Logistical Flights. 
An air base in southern Florida would be roughly 
twice as close to central Cuba as Puerto Cabezas. This means 
that the logistical capability of our limited number of trans-
port aircraft would be almost doubled if operated from Florida 
rather than Puerto Cabezas. Logistical support of the strike 
-8-
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
force in the target would be much more certain and efficient 
if flown from Florida. 
There is also a possibility that once the strike 
operations commence, conditions would develop which would force 
us out of the Nicaraguan air base. Without some flexibility of 
operational capability including an additional logistical support 
air base with pre-positioned supplies in the United States, we 
could conceivably be confronted with a situation wherein the 
Assault Brigade would be left entirely without logistical air 
support. Supply by sea cannot be relied upon, for the Brigade 
may be driven by superior forces from the beach area. Such a 
situation could lead to complete defeat of the Brigade and failure 
of the mission. 
It seems obvious that the only real estate which 
the United States can, without question, continue to employ once 
the operation commences is its own soil. Therefore, an air base 
for logistical support should be provided in the United States. 
This will offer the possibility of continued, flexible operations, 
if one or both of our bases in Guatemala and/or Nicaragua are lost 
to our use. 
Recommendation. 
That policy be established to permit use of an air 
base in southern Florida (preferably Opa Locka which is now 
available to us and has storage facilities for supplies) for logis-
tical support flights to Cuba.

TRINIDAD (CONCEPT OF OPERATION) 
I. MISSION. Commencing at H-hour on D-day, the Assault 
Force lands, seizes, occupies, and defends a lodgement 
in the TRINIDAD-CASILDA area in order to establish a 
base from which further land and air operations can be 
launched against the Castro government of CUBA. 
2. CONCEPT OF OPERATION. 
a. On D-day the Assault Force conducts an amphibious/ 
airborne landing in the TRINIDAD area. 
b. Prior to D-day, sabotage activities are directed at 
reducing and destroying the GOC ground, air and 
naval capability throughout CUBA, with particular 
emphasis on air, communications, transportation, 
armor, artillery and POL. Propaganda activities 
are intensified in order to obtain active support 
of the Cuban populace. 
c. On D-1 tactical support aircraft attack major GOC 
air force installations in order to destroy aircraft 
on the ground and to inflict maximum damage to runways 
and control and communications facilities. Attacks 
are also launched against tank parks, artillery parks, 
motor transportation, and other military targets. 
d. At about H-6 hours a tactical deception operation is 
conducted in the LA FE area of PINAR DEL RIO in order 
to cause movement of enemy forces away from the area 
of intended actual operations. 
�Immediately prior to and following 14-hour on D-day, 
tactical support aircraft provide air support for the 
Assault Force in landing and seizure of objectives, 
with particular attention to enemy defensive instal-
lations and troop.formation in the immediate objective 
area. Major rail and highway bridges west and north-
west of TRINIDAD and along the coastal road toward 
CIENFUEGOS are bombed in order to isolate the objective 
area. Daily armed reconnaissance missions are continued 
in order to prevent movement of enemy forces against the 
lodgement. 
f. Commencing at H-hour, the Assault Force lands by landing 
craft (LCVP and LCU) over designated beaches, (Beaches 1 
and 2), and by parachute in designated drop zone, seizes 
objectives A, B, and C, and on order of Assault Force 
Commander, seizes objectives F and F. (Annex D6--

� Operation Overlay). 
g. After seizure of initial objectives, the Assault Force 
attempts to obtain cooperation, assistance and good-will 
of the local populace in the TRINIDAD-CASILDA area. 
Combat inside the City of Trinidad is avoided. 
Facilities such as the hospital in TRINIDAD and the 
port facilities and petroleum supplies at CASILDA 
are converted to Brigade use. 
h. After consolidation of the lodgement, Assault Force 
coordinates operations with local guerrilla leaders 
and civil leaders in the area making maximum efforts 
to organize, equip and employ additional forces and 
incorporate them under command of the Brigade Commander. 
i. Upon seizure and preparation of the airfield at 
TRINIDAD, transport aircraft (C-46) utilize this base 
for supply and evacuation operations. 
j. Follow-up logistic support is provided by air landing, 
air drop and seaborne means on a scheduled basis and 
in response to call of Brigade Commander. 
k. In the event the TRINIDAD area cannot be held, the 
Assault Brigade, on order of the Brigade Commander, 
withdraws to the ESCAMBRAY MOUNTAINS in order to 
continue resistance operations against the Castro 
government. Support for these operations will he 
provided by aerial means.

Anti-Castro Resistance in Cuba: Actual and Potential 
1. There are now from 2,500 to 3,000 persons in Cuba 
engaged in active resistance against the Castro regime. It is 
our estimate that a well-organized, well-armed force, successful 
in securing a lodgement on Cuban soil, would receive the active 
support of 257. of the Cuban populace and would be opposed, at 
the maximum, by no more than 20% of the people. (Of the re-
maining 657., the majority would adopt an attitude of neutrality 
until such time as there was a strong indication of which side , 
had the better chance of victory.) 
2. While Castro has been able to disperse small groups of 
poorly-armed insurgents, he has been unable to eliminate them or 
to prevent a general increase in resistance activities throughout 
the island. Las Villas, with 600 active guerrillas, remains the 
principal center of resistance, but Oriente (380 actives), Cama-
guey, and Matanzas are increasingly hostile to the regime. In the 
past six weeks, insurgent groups have been reported from three 
points in Oriente, one in Camaguey, and three in Matanzas. In 
Havana itself there was an attempt to assassinate Ernesto Che Guevara 
and attacks were made on a refinery, several tank trucks, and two 
large stores. A plan is underway in Pinar-del Rio for seizure of 
a major air base with the assistance of Army and Navy personnel from 
Castro's own forces. Sabotage is occurring at a steadilynounting 
tempo, with cane fields burning at the rate of 15,000 tons per week. 
At Santiago de Cuba an attack on the refinery was mounted success-
fully by an agent team within the harbor of Raul Castro's stronghold. 
3. The forces which remain loyal to Castro are, for the most 
part, younger students, Communists, and those who have a stake in 
the regime. The latter consists of government officials, persons 
who have benefitted from the distribution of seized properties, and 
those who have received, or believe they will receive, various 
benefits (such as new housing and employment). Castro is opposed 
- 1-
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
by former property holders, business and professional people, 
the clergy, students in Catholic schools, most of those persons 
originally in his own movement, and, increasingly, by the very 
classes he professes to champion - the laborers and the peasants. 
Reasons for this opposition are many. The increasingly virulent 
attacks on the Catholic Church are disturbing a people 90% Catholic, 
even those who are only nominal members. Workers have seen their 
unions become instrumentalities for Communist propaganda, and 
their leaders, including many non-Communist leftists, imprisoned 
and denounced. All classes are aware of the economic deterioration. 
There are shortages, not only of luxuries, but of such essentials 
as soaps, fats, automotive parts, salt, eggs, rice, and beans. The ' 
increased numbers Of Soviet Bloc and Chinese Communist "advisors" 
and the regime's uncritical acceptance of the international Commu-
nist line have alienated, not only the conservatives, but also the 
non-Communist left and those intellectuals unwilling to serve as 
toadies to a foreign ideology. The regime's disregard for objective 
justice and the rule of law, the increase in the arbitrary powers 
and the arrogance of the Security Services, the drum-head execution 
of young counter=revolutionaries, have convinced many Cubans that 
beneath the propaganda myth Castro's regime is little different from 
that of Batista. 
4. General discontent disillusionment, however, are ineffective 
against a loyal, disciplined armed force. The people are ready to 
support a new regime, but they will not enjoy that opportunity if 
the bulk of Castro's military forces will fight for him. It is our 
estimate that those forces, if confronted by a trained opposition 
element with modern weapons and a unified command, will largely 
disintegrate. It is significant that most of the leaders of anti-
Castro insurgent groups are Army officers who once fought with Castro 
against Batista. The Army has been systematically purged, and most 
of it is now serving in labor battalions q,. on routine garrison duty. 
There is great resentment in the Army at this down-grading, the 
subordination to the Militia, and the imprisonment of such popular 
leaders as Huber Matos. The Air Force has lost nearly all of its 
better pilots and navigators and does not constitute an effective 
combat force. All of the few senior Navy officers and many of the 
younger ones would welcome an opportunity to desert Castro. We 
estimate that a significant portion (35 to 40%) of the Army would 
join an opposition force if given the opportunity, and that the 
remainder would not fight. The Air Force would likely defect en 
masse. This would leave as Castro's chief reliance,the Militia.

and submachine guns) and is receiving increasingly effective

training. 'Within it .are the "hard-core" of Castro supporters. 
Despite this, it is our estimate that not more than 5,000 to 8,000 
mould fight to the end for Castro, and then only if they were . 
united in elements made up of similar die-hards, Which, except in 
Havana, they are not. While some Of the Militia Joined for the 
glamour of a uniform, most members became so because they had no 
other choice. In the EscaMbray one Army commander urged Castro to 
withdraw all the militia because of their ineffectiveness. And it 
is significant, that when the fighting became more serious in that 
area, three Army battalions were called, in despite the presence of 
40,000 militia who were opposed by no more than 800 insurgents. 
Reports of heavy militia casualties have spread throughout the 
Island. Where terrain is faverable and opposition light, the militia 
can be effective through sheer weight of numbers, e.g., against 
Captain Clodomiro Miranda and only thirteen followers, Castro emr. , 
ployed six battalions. In rough terrain or against determined oppo-
sition that effectiveness becomes minimal. 
6. In summary, it is our estimate that conditions within Cuba 
Are now favorable for the overthrow of the regime if an effective, 
well-armed opposition force' can secure a lodgement on the island, 
that the active resistance to Castro will increase rapidly from the 
present 2,500 to' 3,000 to a .figure at least ten times that size once 
a landing is effected, and that the, Castro military forces, faced 
with such opposition, will not exceed a maximum of 8,000 to 10,000 
effectives. It is out further estimate that even the har&core'pro-
Castro 'forces.wilinot be effective outside the area of Havana, and 
that any opposition force that can advance as far 'as Havana will 
accrue to. it such defectors from the Castro military as will give it 
superiority in numbers.

ENCLOSURE 5 
Cuba: The Record Set Straight * 
by Charles J.V. Murphy 
Not long ago, at President Kennedy's daily staff meeting, 
the special assistant for national security affairs, McGeorge 
Bundy, opened the proceedings by noting, "Sir, we have four 
matters up for discussion this morning." The President was 
not in a zestful mood. "Are these problems which I inherited?" 
he asked. "Or are they problems of our own making?" "A lit-
tle of both," was Bundy's tactful answer. 
The exchange revealed a new and saving humility. Some 
days after this incident, Kennedy addressed the nation on the 
subject of Berlin. The ebullience, the air of self-assurance 
that marked his first months in office had gone. He spoke 
earnestly to his countrymen but his words were also aimed at 
Premier Khrushchev, who up to this point had appeared not to 
be listening. This time Kennedy did get through to Moscow; 
and any lingering doubt about the American determination to 
defend Berlin was dispelled by the response of the American 
people. The President's will to stand firm was clear, and 
the nation was with him. 
Nevertheless, in any full review of John Kennedy's first 
months in office, there must be reported a failure in adminis-
tration that will continue to inhibit and trouble American 
foreign policy until it is corrected. tVis failure raises a 
fair question: whether Kennedy has yet mastered the govern-
mental machinery, whether he is well and effectively served 
by some of his close advisers, and whether they understand 
the use of power in world politics. The matter is of vital 
Importance; in the crises that will inevitably arise around 
the world--in the Middle East, in Africa, in the Far East, in 
Central Europe--the U.S. Government must be in top form, and 
'possibly even, as Kennedy himself suggested, act alone.

Administrative confusions came to light most vividly in 
the Cuban disaster. That story is told here for the first 
time in explicit detail. It is told against the background 
of the U.S. reversal in Laos, which in itself should not be 
underestimated: Laos, once in the way of becoming a buffer 
for its non-Communist neighbors, is all but finished; now, in 
South Viet-Nam, Ngo Dinh Diem, a stout friend of the U.S., is 
under murderous attack by Communist guerrillas; the U.S. loss 
of face is being felt from the Philippines to Pakistan, and 
in the long run the damage may prove to be even more Costly 
than that caused by Cuba. 
Let us turn back then to the train of events, beginning 
with Laos, that culminated in the disaster in the Bay of Pigs. 
FORTUNE is publishing the account for one purpose--to set 
the record straight for concerned Americans. 
Kennedy, from the day he took office, was loath to act 
in Laos. He was confident that he understood the place and 
use of power in the transactions of the nation, but he was 
baffled by this communitrof elephants, parasols, and pagodas. 
Then, too, he brought to office a general surmise that our 
long-range prospects of holding the new and weak nations of 
Southeast Asia in the Western camp were doubtful in the ex-
treme. In this respect, he was leaning toward the Lippmann-
Stevenson-Fulbright view of strategy. This school holds that 
U.S. power is overcommitted in Southeast Asia, and that the 
proper aim for U.S. diplomacy there should be to reduce local 
frictions by molding the new states as true neutrals. 
The U.S. position in Laos had become acute while Dwight 
Eisenhower was still in office. Eisenhower must therefore 
bear a considerable part of the blame for the U.S. failure; 
he let a situation go from bad to worse, and indeed he apolo-
gized to Kennedy for leaving "a mess," and that it might take 
the intervention of U.S. troops to redgam it. There had been 
a moment when the struggle in Laos had turned in favor of the 
pro-U.S. forces under General Phoumi Mosavan, the former De-
fense Minister. In a series of small but decisive engage- , 
ments, more by maneuver than by shooting, Phoumi eventually 
took the capital, Vientiane, early in December, but at this 
point the Russians intervened openly on the side of the Com-
munist faction, the Pathet Lao. In concert with a large-
scale push by well-trained troops from North Viet-Nam, they 
introduced a substantial airlift into northern Laos (an opera-
tion that still is continuing).

Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
The collapse of the Royal Laotian Army then became 
inevitable unless the U.S. came in with at least equal weight 
on Phoumi's side. One obvious measure was to put the .airlift 
out of business. �The job.could have been done by "volunteer" 
pilots and the challenge would at least have established, at 
not too high an initial risk for the U.S., how far the Rus-
sians were prepared to go. Another meausre would have been 
to bring SEATO forces into the battle, as the SEATO treaty 
provided.. 
In the end, Eisenhower decided to sheer away from both 
measures. The State Department was Opposed to stirring up 
India and the other Asian neutrals.. Secretary of State 
Christian Herter agreed in principle that the independence of 
Laos had to be maintained, yet he was unable to bring to heel 
his own desk officers and the policy planners, who were appre-
hensive that even a limited military action would wreck the 
possibility of some kind of political accommodation with Mos-
cow. The policy shapers, especially in State, hung back from 
any sequence of actions that might have committed U.S. policy 
on the central issue: that Laos was worth fighting for. - 
Even the modest additional support that the Defense Department 
tried to extend to Phoumi's U.S.-equipped battalions in the 
field during the last weeks of the Eisenhower Administration 
was diluted by reason of the conflict between Defense and 
State. Under Secretary of Defense James Douglas was later to 
say, "By the time a message to the field had been composed in 
Washington, it had ceased to be an operational order and had 
become a philosophical essay." And a vexed Phoumi was to ex-
claim that the reasoning of the American Ambassador, Winthrop 
Brown, was beyond his simple Oriental mind. "His Execllency 
insists that my troops be rationed to a few rounds of ammuni-
tion per man. He tells me that I must not start a world var. 
But the enemy is at my throat." 
After the responsibility passed to Kennedy in January, 
Phoumi's position was still not completely hopeless, if he 
had been able to get adequate help. }lilt. early in March a sud-
den Communist descent drove him off a position commanding the 
principal highway in northernLaos. That unfortunate action 
was the turning point in his part of the war. For the rela-
tive ease with which it was done raised in Washington the 
question of whether Phoumi's troops had the will to fight. 
By then Kennedy was committed to the Cuba operation. He 
therefore now had to reckon with the very real possibility, 
were U.S. forces to become involved in Laos, of'having to 
back off from Cuba. 
At this juncture .Kennedy's foremost need was a clear 
reading of Soviet intentions. For this he turned to his 
3 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
"demonologists," the New Frontier's affectionate term for its 
Soviet experts. The most influential among them--Charles E. 
Bohlen State's senior SovietolOgist, and Ambassador 
Llewellyn Thompson at Moscow--were agreed that Khrushchev per-
sonally had too much respect for U.S. power to stir it into 
action', as Stalin had carelessly done in Korea. Yet, while 
Khrushchev was plainly indulging his preference for "salami" 
tactics, it was impossible to judge how big a slice he was 
contemplating or whether he was, being pushed by Mao Tse-tung. 
The only reading available to Kennedy was, in a word, ambigu-
ous. Maybe Khrushchev was moving into a vacuum in Laos just 
. to keep out Mao. If so, then the least chancy response for 
the U.S. was to assume that Khrushchev would be satisfied with 
a thin slide in Laos, and to maneuver him toward a compromise--
a neutral government in which, say, the Pathet Lao would have 
some minor representation. 
This course was.urged by Secretary of State Dean Rusk 
and also was being pressed by Prime Minister Macmillan in 
London. It came to be' knoWn as Track Two. It was intended 
to lead to a cease-fire followed by negotiation. Oppositely, 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff still believed, as they did under 
Eisenhower, that the military challenge demanded a military 
showdowni action by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organiation, 
under which a mixed allied force, including Americans, would 
move into Laos and take over 'the defense, of the. important 
cities, thereby freeing the Royal Laotian Army :to move into 
the field.without risk of being sapped by subversion in the 
rear. This option was labeled Track One, and it was favored 
as well by Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara and his deputy, 
Roswell Oilpatric, 
While Kennedy favored Track Two and supported a comAlia 
tory note that Macmillan sent to Moscow, he decided he also ' 
had to make a show Of starting. down Track One, in case the 
political 'gamble tailed. He permitted himself a dramatic ges-
ture. At his televised press conference On March 23, he, 
addressed himself somberly to a map of Ll000s--a country "far 
away" but in a world that is "small." Its indePendence, he 
went on, "runs with the safety' of, us all," and in language 
that all but told Khrushchev that he was in for a fight,. he 
implied that the U.S. was preparing to go to its defense. 
There was, meanwhile, a tremendous deployment of U.S. forces 
in the Far East, involving the Seventh Fleet and Marine combat 
units on Okinawa. The Army's strategic-Strike units in the 
U.S. were made ready. A belated effort was made to buck up 
Phoumi's forces with an increased flow of fighting gear. U.S. 
military "advisers" went into the field with his battalions, 
Against this background, on March 26, Kennedy went to Key West 
and met Macmillan, who was on a visit to the West Indies. The 
-4 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Prime Minister made it clear that Britain considered Laos 
hardly worth a war, and wanted no part in a SEATO action. 
(De Gaulle, in a separate exchange, had told Kennedy flatly 
that France would not fight in Laos.) 
From that point on, the idea of a military showdown in 
Laos looked less and less attractive to the. President. He did 
issue one warning to the Russians that might have been con-
strued as having a military tone. Soviet Foreign Minister. 
Andrei Gromyko called at the White House�and Kennedy took him 
into the rose garden, beyond earshot of his staff, and said, 
"The U.S. does not intend to stand idly by while you take over 
Laos." But that was the last run along Track One. 
By then, Rusk was in Bangkok for a meeting of the SEATO 
powers, still hoping to extract from the meeting at least a 
strong statement that would condemn the Soviet intervention 
in Laos and reassert the determination of the SEATO powers to 
defend the new nations of Southeast Asia. In this mission 
Rusk failed: None of the ranking Democratic Congressmen, or, 
Republican, spoke up in favor of intervention. Moreover, when 
Kennedy pressed the military chiefs for specific recommenda-
tions, he got divided answers. General Thomas White 'then 
Air Force Chief of Staff, and Admiral Arleigh Burke, then 
Chief of Naval Operations, were both confident that the Com-
munist penetration could be defeated and Laos saved. They 
said that since the Communists could throw far more manpower 
into the battle, the U.S. war plan would have to include the 
possible use of tactical nuclear weapons on a limited scale. 
They maintained, however, that a clear U.S. resolution to em-
ploy nuclear weapons, if there was a need, might in itself 
discourage further Communist penetration. General Lyman L. 
Lemnitzer, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen-
eral George H. Decker, Army Chief of Staff, had much less con-
fidence in the U.S. ability to stop the Communists. Lemnitzer 
expressed the apprehension that U.S. military action in Laos 
might be matched by Red China and Russia in a fast reopening 
of the war in Korea. Two such wars, by*ftls calculation, might 
require no fewer than twenty U.S. divisions, more than the 
Army had in its entire order of battle, as well as general 
mobilization to support them. 
"In effect," Kennedy demanded, "you're telling me that I 
can't do anything--without starting a nuclear war?" This, he . 
'swore, he'd never do, which by itself was a startling reversal 
of a fundamental premise of the Eisenhower strategy: that 
U.S. forces would have recourse to nuclear tactical weapons on 
whatever scale' the pursuit of U.S. objectives required. The 
White House, while conceding to the Communists the option of 
uninhibited escalation, would not tolerate �even a limited es-
calation on the nuclear side by our own forces. Any military

Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
move in Laos therefore seemed hopeless. 
� The fear of the nuclear escalation factor became the 
sanction for the policy that was pursued thereafter. In light 
� of this, the scene of Kennedy addressing himself to the map of 
Laos, in his first public appearance as Commander-in-Chief, is 
now memorable for its fleeting revelation of a spirited man 
who was eager to present himself as a strong President, but 
who all too quickly turned unsure of his principal resource of 
power. 
The chiefs, although they took different views of the 
risks of the Laos situation, were fundamentally agreed on a 
central point. And that was that the U.S. had to be prepared 
to employ tactical nuclear weapons. But Kennedy and his civil-
ian strategists, moving away from the nuclear base of the 
Eisenhower strategy, read into their professional differences a 
bankruptcy of means and doctrine. The low esteem in which . 
Kennedy began to hold the military leaders whom he inherited 
from the Eisenhower Administration has not been concealed. 
Secretary of Defense McNamara is rewriting the Eisenhower 
strategic doctrine, in collaboration with the political 
scientists at the White House and State. The backing away 
from nuclear strategy, which ended in the U.S. retreat in Laos, 
.is now being formalized by McNamara. (His prescription will 
call for a conventional base for NATO strategy in the defense 
of Berlin.) 
So there was, by early April, even as Laos was slipping 
farther and farther below Kennedy's horizon, a breakdown of 
communication between the political and the military sides of 
the government, and this would contribute largely to the fail-
ure of Kennedy's next venture. 
The Cuba affair has been called the, American Suez. In 
the sense that Suez, too, was an utter fiasco, the bracketing 
is wryly accurate. There is, however, a clear difference be-
tween the two operations. Ill-managed as it was, the Suez in-. 
vasion would have succeeded had not Eisenhower used the influ-
ence of the U.S. to bring three Allies�Britain, France, and 
Israel--to a humiliating halt. (It should be recorded that 
neither Britain; France, nor Israel made any critical comment 
on the U.S. excursion in Cuba.) In Cuba the defeat was wholly 
self-inflicted. Even as the expedition was creeping into the 
Bay of Pigs, just before midnight of April 16, the political 
overseers back in Washington were in the process of knocking 
out of the battle plan the final, irreducible element needed 
for victory.

If the U.S. military are without a peer in any one 
technique of warfare, it is in putting forces ashore across a 
hostile beach. For the Bay of Pigs, all the necessary means 
were at Kennedy's hand. It was, by the standards of General 
David M. Shoup's Marines, an elementary amphibious operation 
in less than battalion strength. And, indeed, � as a tactical, 
exercise, it was well devised and daringly and successfully. 
led. But after the strategists at the White House and State 
had finished plucking it apart, it became an operation that 
would have disgraced even the Albanians. When Kennedy looked 
around for the blunderer, he found him everywhere and 'nowhere. 
Practically everybody in his inner group of policy movers and 
shakers had been in on the planning. Only after the disaster 
was upon them did he and his men realize that a venture which 
was essentially a military one had been fatally compromised 
in order to. satisfy political considerations. One not un-
friendly official who also served under Eisenhower was later 
to observe: "Cuba was a terrific jolt to this new crowd be-
cause it exposed the fact that they hadn't really begun to 
.understand the meaning and consequences of action--the use or 
misuse of power, in other words. They had blamed Ike's ap-
parent inaction on indecision and plain laziness. Cuba taught 
them that action, any kind of serious action, is hard and cer-
tainly no safe business for amateurs." 
The idea for the invasion had taken root during the early 
summer of 1960. By then, thousands of defectors from Castro's 
Cuba were in, the U.S. Many of them were professional soldiers. 
The job.of organizing and training them was given to the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency, as the government's principal mech-
anism for mounting covert operations of this sort. It. became 
and remained to the end the specific responsibility of one of 
the CIA's top deputies, Richard M. Bissell, a former econo-
mist who is also a highly practical executive. Among his 
other first-class accomplishments, Bissell had masterminded 
the 1J-2 operation, which was, until it finally missed, as one 
day it had to, the most economical and comprehensive innova-
tion in espionage in modern times. 
Training camps for the exiles were set up in a district 
in western Guatemala offering some privacy. The original 
idea was to feed the recruits back into Cuba, to reinforce 
the several thousand anti-Castro guerrillas already established 
in the mountains. Toward the autumn, however, a more ambi-
tious and riskier project came under tentative consideration. 
Castro waS organizing large formations of militia and was ob-
viously bent on crushing the counterrevolutionary movement 
before the Cuban populace caught fire. With a view to saving 
the movement, it was proposed to build up an invasion force 
big enough to seize and to hold on the Cuban shore a beachhead 
� 7 �

Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
sufficiently deep for the expedition to proclaim a provisional 
government, and so provide a rallying base for the discon-
tented. By. this time; too, the rudiments of an anti-Castro 
air force Were in training nearby. The planes, however, were 
all obsolete--mostly' propeller-driven, B-26's, ,twin-engine 
bombers of World War II vintage that had been redeemed from 
the Air. Force's graveyard. Associated with them, was a troop-
carrying squadron with which a small detachment of paratroopers 
was training. 
During the summer and fall of 1960, Eisenhower from time 
to time personally reviewed the scheme. In late November, the 
last time it came up for his comprehensive review, an opera-
tional plan had not yet crystallized; no timetable for action 
had been set. Across the Potomac at the Pentagon, Under Secre-
tary of Defense Douglas, who was charged with quasi-military 
operations under the noncommittal category of collateral cold-
war activities, was keeping a watchful eye on the project, and 
releasing such military talent and gear as the CIA requisi-
tioned. Neither benor the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Whose cOn-
nection with the project remained informal at this stage) 
believed that much good would flow from an attack made by Cubans 
alone. For one thing,-the resources then available'permitted 
the training of only 300 men or so, and the air unit had but a 
dozen planes. This was hardly enough to bring down a tough, 
well-armed regime, and Douglas repeatedly counseled more 
realism in the planning. Indeed, it was taken for granted by 
Douglas and. the others directly concerned that a landing in 
force could not possibly be brought off unless the expedition 
was shepherded to the beach by the U.S. Navy (either openly or 
in disguise), and covered by air power in whatever amoung might 
be necessary:. Eisenhower,. the commander of Normandy, under-
stood this well enough. 
"You may have to send troops in" 
It beoame obvious toward the end of 1960' that Ike would 
be out of office well before an effective force would be ready. 
So the decision as to how big the show should be, and how con.-
spicuous should. be the U.S.. share, and in what role, was no � 
longer his to make. ,Given. the relaxed attitude at the White' . 
House, the military chiefs also relaxed; military concern for 
the enterprise'sank to the "Indians"--from the four-star level 
to the colonels on, the Joint Staff who had been.advising the 
CIA in. such matters as training and tactics. Bissell Was en-
couraged, on the one.hand, to go 'forward with preparations for 
an invasion, but he was cautioned to be ready to fallback to 
the more modest objective of simply generating a supply of re-
inforcements for the anti-Castro forces in the mountains.

Before Eisenhower was fully rid of his responsibility, 
however, a number of disquieting developments combined to im-
part to the enterprise an air of emergency. It was established 
that Castro was to start receiving, early �in 1961, substantial 
deliveries of Soviet jet fighters, and that pilots to man them 
were already being trained in Czechoslovakia. From all indica-
tions, these would provide him, by �early summer, with an air 
force that would be more than enough to extinguish the last 
chance of a successful invasion by Cuban exiles; it would be by 
all odds the most powerful air force in Latin America. Two 
other developments were scarcely less worrisome. Castro was 
making progress in his systematic destruction of his enemies in 
the mountains, upon whose cooperation the invasion counted, and 
there was no way, save by an overt air supply to get guns and 
ammunition to them. The stability of the exile movement itself 
was, moreover, coming into question. Warring political factions 
threatened to split their ranks, and men who had trained long 
and painstakingly were impatient over the failure of their 
American advisers to set a sailing date. The feeling took hold 
of them and their American sponsors that it was to be in the 
spring or never. 
After his election, Kennedy had been briefed fairly 
frequently on the Cuba situation, along with that in Laos. As 
his hour of authority approached, the question of what to do 
about Cuba was increasingly on his mind. The problem had a 
personal angle. In his fourth television debate with Richard 
Nixon, he had sharply blamed the Eisenhower Administration for 
permitting Communism to seize a base there, "only ninety miles 
off the coast of the U.S." He discussed Cuba, along with 
Laos, at length in both of his pre-inaugural talks with 
Eisenhower, and by his stipulation. Ike was inclined to rank 
Cuba below Laos in terms of urgency, but Cuba clearly worried 
him. In their second conversation Ike said: "It's already a 
bad situation. You may have to send troops in." 
The first necessity; control of the air 
On taking office, Kennedy at once called for a detailed 
briefing on the condition and prospects of the U.S.-fostered 
operation. This information was supplied by Allen W. Dulles, 
the director of the CIA, and by Bissell. After Kennedy had 
heard them out he decided that he had to have from the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff a technical opinion of the feasibility of the 
project. It is at this point that the locus of responsibility 
begins to be uncertain. 
The operation was not a Department of Defense responsibility. 
Only once before, in early January, had the chiefs formally 
9 -

wow

reviewed the plan, at Eisenhower's invitation. Now they were 
asked only for an "appreciation" of its validity. The enter-
prise, moreover, had expanded considerably in scope and aim 
in the past few months. With more than 100,000 Cuban refugees 
in the U.S.', recruiting had stepped up, and the organizers 
were at this point aiming at a landing force of about 1,000 
men. An operational plan for a. landing on the south coast of 
Cuba, near the town of Trinidad, �was finally beginning to jell. 
There the country Was open, with good roads leading into the 
Escambray Mountains and the needed link-up with the indigenous 
guerrillas. Also cranked into the plan were ingenious schemes--
a barrage of radiobroadcasts from nearby islands and showers 
of pamphlets from airplanes--intended to galvanize the anti-
Castro Cubans in the cities and villages into demonstrations 
as the invaders struck. It was never explicitly claimed by 
the CIA that a general uprising was immediately in the cards; 
the intention was to sow enough Chaos during the first hours 
to prevent Castro from smashing the invasion on the beach. 
Once the beachhead was consolidated, however, and if fighting 
gear went forward steadily to the guerrillas elsewhere in Cuba, 
the planners were confident that a mass revolt could be 
stimulated. 
Finally, the plan still assumed that U.S. military help 
would be on call during the landing. Castro's air force con-
sisted of not quite two-score planes--a dozen or so obsolete 
B-26's, plus about the same number of obsolete British Sea 
Furies, also slow, propeller-driven airplanes. But in addi-
tion there were seven or eight T-33 jet trainers, the remnants 
of an earlier U.S. transaction with the Batista government, so 
the force was not the pushover it appeared at first glance. 
Armed with rockets, these jets would be more than a match in a 
battle for the exiles' B-26's. The scheme was to destroy them 
on the ground in advance of the landing, by a series of attacks 
on.Castro's airfields; should the T-33's escape the first sur-
prise blow, there would be ample opportunity to catch them 
lai-er on the ground while they were being refueled after an 
action. In any event, a U.S. carrier would be close by., below 
the horizon, and one or two of its tactical jets could presum-
ably supply whatever quick and trifling help might be required 
in an emergency. 
It stood to reason that, considering how small the landing 
party was, the success of the operation would hinge on the B-26's 
controlling the air over the beachhead. And the margins that 
the planners accepted were narrow to begin with. The B-26's 
were to operate from a staging base in a Central American 
country more than five hundred miles from Cuba. The round trip 
would take better than six hours, and that would leave the 
planes with fuel for only forty-five minutes of action, for

bombing and air Cover over Cuba. In contrast, Castro's air 
force could be over the beachhead and the invaders' ships in 
a matter of minutes, which would increase his relative air 
advantage manifold. Hence the absolute necessity of knocking 
out Castro's air power, or at least reducing it to impotence, 
by the time the ground battle was joined. 
,This, in general terms, was the plan the chiefs reviewed 
for Kennedy. The assumptions concerning the possibilities of 
an anti-Castro uprising not being in their jurisdiction, they 
took these at face value. They judged the tactical elements 
sound and, indeed, they accorded the operation a high proba-
bility of success. They were allowed to appraise the train-
ing and the equipment of the forces. A team of officers was 
sent to Guatemala. On the basis of its report, the chiefs 
made several recommendations, but again their assessment was 
favorable. 
Late in January, Kennedy authorized. the CIA to lay on 
the invasion plan, but he warned that he might call the whole 
operation off if he had a change of mind as to its wisdom.' 
day was tentatively fixed for March 1 but this proved impos-
sible to meet. For one thing, it took some time to organize 
the quarrelsome exiles in New York and Miami into a workable 
coalition that would sponsor the expedition. For another, it 
was decided that .a battalion of about 1,400 men was needed to 
secure a beachhead, and that the force, which called itself 
the Cuban Brigade, should be beefed up generally. In'conse-
quence of these developments, the target date kept slipping 
until it finally came firm as April 17. 
It has since been reported that the President was 
'inwardly, skeptical of the operation from the start but just 
why has never been clear--whether he judged the force too 
small to take on Castro, or because he was reluctant to take 
on so soon a nasty job that was bound to stir up an interna-
tional ruckus, however it came out. Some of his closest,ad-
visers, in any case, were assailed by sinking second thoughts. 
What bothered them was the ,"immorality" of masked aggression. 
They recoiled from having the U.S. employ subterfuge in strik-
ing down even so dangerous an adversary as Castro, and they 
were almost unanimously opposed to having the U.S. do the job 
in the open. Even with the best of luck, there would certainly 
be a flutter among the six leading Latin-American states, which, 
with the exception of Venezuela, had refused to lend themselves 
to any form of united action against Castro. And the repercus-
sion would scarcely be less embarrassing among the neutralists 
of Asia and Africa, whose good opinion Kennedy's advisers were 
most eager to cultivate. And so the emphasis at the White 
House and State began to move away from a concern with the 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
Approved for Release: 2024/11/12 C01410807 
military considerations--the things needed to make the 
enterprise work--and to become preoccupied with tinkerings 
they hoped would soften its political impact on. the neutral 
nations. 
The dismembering begins 
A 
The "immorality" of the intervention found its. most - 
eloquent voice before. the President during a meeting in the 
State Department on -April 4, only thirteen days before the 
date set for the invasion. (Stewart Alsop told part of the 
story in a recent issue of the Saturday  Evening Post.) The 
occasion was Bissell's final review of the operation, and 
practically everybody connected with .high strategy was on 
hand--Secretary of State Rusk, Secretary of Defense McNamara, 
Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon, General Lemnitzer, 
CIA chief Allen Dulles, as well as Bundy, Paul Nitze, Kennedy's 
specialist on strategic planning at the Pentagon,- Thomas Mann, 
then Assistant Secretary of State for Latin-American Affairs, 
and three of 'Kennedy's specialists in Latin-American matters,-
Adolf Berle, Arthur M. Schlesinger, -Jr., and Richard Goodwin. 
There was also one outsider, �Senator William Fulbright, chair-
man of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who had been 
Kennedy's favorite choice. for Secretary of State, and whose 
support he wanted. . After Bissell had completed his.briefing 
and Dulles had summed up the risks and prospects, Fulbright 
spoke and denounced the proposition out of hand: it was the 
wrong thing for the U.S. to get involved in. � 
Kennedy chose not to meet this issue. Instead, he 
quickly noted certain practical considerations and then, going 
around the table, he asked various of his advisers whether 
they thought the operation should go forward. Without excep-
tion, the answer was, yes. Berle was particularly outspoken. 
He declared that "a power Confrontation" with Communism in 
the Western Hemisphere was inevitable amyhow. As for this 
enterpriSe. "Let 'eryip".was his counsel. Mann, whd previ-
ously had been on the fence, now spoke up for the operation. 
Rusk,, too, said he Was for'it, in answer to the president's 
direct' question, but as would presently be manifest, he pri-
vately had no heart for it. Two other men among the Presi-
dent's senior foreign-policy advisers, not present. at the meet-
ing, shared'Fulbright's feelings:. Under Secretary of State 
Chester Bowles, and Adlai_Stevenson, with the. United Nations 
in New York, who, soon came to know in a general way that some-
thing distasteful was afoot. In deference to these views, 
Kennedy--either at the meeting or soon afterward�made two 
separate ruling's� that were to contribute to the. fatal

dismemberment of the whole plan. First, U.S. airpower would 
not be on call at any time: the obsolescent B-26's flown by 
"our" Cubans would be on their own. Second, the B-26's 
could be used in only two strikes before the invasion--first 
on D-minus-two-days (April 15) and again on the morning of 
the landing. Although these limitations clearly lengthened 
the risks, Lemnitzer did not dispute them, nor did Bissell's 
own military advisers; they were confident that if the B-26's 
missed the T-33's on the first go, they would surely catch 
them on the second. 
During the few remaining days, Kennedy drew his circle 
of advisers more tightly around him. Apart from Bundy and 
Rostow, the only White House advisers who remained privy to , 
the development of the operation were the Latin-American ex-
perts--Adolf Berle and Schlesinger. Lemnitzer and, of course, 
Allen Dulles were in and out of Kennedy's office. But the 
doubts of Rusk and Fulbright and of others were all the while 
imperceptibly converging on the President and, bit by bit, an 
operation that was marginal to begin with was so truncated as 
to guarantee its failure. 
The embarkation of the expedition was scheduled to start 
on April 10. This was, in itself, quite a job. Some half-
dozen small steamers were collected for the first movement, 
together with a number of tactical landing craft. The take-
off point was a port on the Caribbean, several hundred miles 
from the training area in Guatemala, and the transfer of the 
Cuban,Brigade was done by air and at night, through four 
nights, in the interest of secrecy. The gear aboard the ships 
was enough to supply the landing force through ten days of bat-
tle, and also to equip the thousands of guerrillas expected to 
be recruited after the beachhead was gained. 
Only a week before the embarkation, and indeed only a 
day or so before the last go-around at the State Department, 
another serious change was made in the invasion plan. At the 
insistence of the State Department, Trinidad was eliminated 
as the target landing area. State's reasons were complex. 
Rusk decided that the entire operation had to be kept "unspec-
tacular" and minimize the overtness of the U.S. role as much 
as possible. That required shifting the attack to a less 
populated and less accessible area, where Castro's reaction 
might be slower and less effective. Rusk and his own advisers 
were also anxious to be rid at all. possible speed of the in-
cubus of responsibility for mounting the operation in Central 
America, anxious that the B-26's should be based as rapidly as. 
possible on Cuba. The only vulnerable airfield capable of 
taking the planes was one in poor condition near the Bay of 
Pigs, on the Zapata Peninsula, about 100 miles to the west of

Trinidad. Here the countryside was quite deserted and, to 
succeed at all, the invaders had to seize and hold two nar-
row causeways leading. across a swamp that was impassable on. 
either side. These actions did not end the last-minute cur-
tailments directed by the White House. Even the arrangements 
for arousing the Cuban populace and trying to stampede Cas-
tro's militia with leaflet raids and radiobroadcasts were 
struck from the plan, and again because State was afraid that 
they would be too obvious a showing of the U.S. hand. On * 
April 12, while the convoy was heading north,, Kennedy was im-
pelled to announce at a .press conference that the U.S. would 
not intervene with force in Cuba. Rusk made sure the idea 
got home by repeating the same guarantee on the morning of 
the invasion. The effect of this was to serve notice on the 
Cubans in Cuba, who were known to be waiting for an encourag-
ing signal from the U.S., that whatever they might be tempted 
to try would be at their own risk. 
The politicians take command 
Clear to the end, Kennedy retained tight control of the 
enterprise. As each new sequence of action came up for his 
final approval--the Go signal for the embarkation, then for 
the pre-invasion air strike on the morning of April 15, he 
came to his decisions quickly and firmly. All the way, how-
ever, he reserved the option to stop the landing short of the 
beach. He kept asking how late the enterprise might be re-
versed without making it look as if Castro had called an Amer-
ican bluff. He was told: noon on Sunday, April 16, when the 
invasion force would be eleven hours of steaming from the Bay 
of Pigs. The Sunday deadline found Kennedy in the Virginia 
countryside, at Glen Ora; only then did he raise his finger 
from the hold button. As he did so, he noted with relief 
that no other unfavorable factors had materialized. He was 
mistaken. At dawn of the day before, by the timetable, the 
B-26's, having flown undetected through 4 the night from their 
Central American staging base, appeared over Cuba and bombed 
the three fields on which Castro's ready air was deployed. 
(The attack was, on the whole, highly successful. Half of 
Castro's B-26's and Sea Furies, and four of his T-33 jets were--
blown up or damaged and so removed from the imminent battle.) 
The story was put out that Castro's own pilots, in the act of 
defecting, had attacked their own airfields. This was a gloss, 
to say the least; the attackers were indeed defectors from 
Castro, but they had defected long before. Later that after-
noon, at the United Nations, alter the Cuban Foreign Minister, 
Raul Roa, had charged that the attack was. a "prologue" to a 
U.S. invasion, Adlai Stevenson arose and swore that the 
planes were Castro's.

From this hapless moment on, Stevenson's role becomes 
unclear.. There was a subsequent published report that he in-
tervened to block the second strike. Stevenson has flatly 
.denied, and continues to deny, that he even knew about the 
second strike, let alone that he demanded. that it be called 
off. But there was little doubt about his unhappiness over 
the course of events in the Caribbean and he conveyed these 
feelings to Washington. Before Sunday was over Bundy was to 
fly to New York, to see Stevenson (Bundy said) and still 
wearing, in his haste to be off, sneakers and sports clothes. 
This sudden errand followed a shattering order that went out 
to Bissell. 
It was Sunday evening, only some eight hours after Kennedy 
had given "the go-ahead." In the first dark, the expedition 
was even then creeping toward the Cuban shore. In Bissell's 
office there was a call on the White House line. It was 
Bundy, being even crisper than usual: the B-26's were to 
stand down, there was to be no air strike in, the morning, 
this was a presidential order. Secretary of State Rusk was 
now acting for the President in the situation. If Bissell 
wished to make a "reclama" (federalese for appeal), it could 
be done through Rusk. 
Bissell was stunned. In Allen Dulles' absence ,(he was in' 
Puerto Rico), he put his problem up to CIA Deputy Director 
Charles Cabell, an experienced airman. Together they went to 
the State Department to urge Rusk to reconsider a decision that, 
in their judgment, would put the enterprise in irretrievable 
peril. Cabell was greatly worried about the vulnerability to 
air attack first of the ships and then of the troops on the 
beach. Rusk was not impressed. The ships, he Suggested, 
could unload and retire to the open sea before daylight; as 
for the troops ashore being unduly inconvenienced by Castro's 
air, it had been his experience, as a colonel in the Burma 
.theatre, he told his visitors, that air attack could, be more 
of a nuisance than a danger. One fact he made absolutely 
clear: military considerations had.ovezruled the political 
when the D-minus-two strike had been laid on; now political 
considerations were taking over. While they were talking, Rusk 
telephoned the President at Glen Ora to say that Cabell and 
Bissell were at his side, and that they were worried about the 
cancellation of the strike. Rusk, at one point, put his hand 
over the mouthpiece, and asked Cabell whether he wished to 
speak to the President. Cabell shook his head. Perhaps that 
was his mistake; it was certainly his last chance to appeal a 
lamentable decision. But Bundy had made it clear that Rusk 
was acting for the President, and Cabell is a professional 
military man, trained to take orders after the facts had been 
argued with the man in command.

On their return to the office, Bissell flashed orders to 
the B!-.26 commander at the staging field, more than 500 miles 
from the Bay of Pigs. The force got the changed orders short-
ly before midnight, only half an hour or so before they were 
scheduled to depart; the bomb bays were already loaded and 
the crews were aboard. Meanwhile the planes carrying the 
paratroopers had taken off, and the first assault barges, still . 
unobserved, were even then approaching the beaches. 
Tuesday, the turning point 
Past .midnight, in the early watches, Bissell and Cabell 
restudied the battle plan, while signals of consternation 
welled up from their'men far to the south. At four o'clock, 
less than an hour before first light on the Cuban shore, 
Cabell went back to Rusk with another proposal. it was man-
ifestly impossible for the Brigade's small force of B-26's 
(only sixteen were operational) to provide effective air 
cover for the ships from their distant base against jets that 
could reach the ships in minutes. Cabell now asked whether, 
if the ships were to pull back of the three or twelve-mile 
limit, whichever distance U.S. legal doctrine held to be the 
beginnings of international water, the U.S.S. Boxer, a car-
rier on station about fifty miles from the Bay of Pigs, could 
be instructed to provide cover for them. Rusk said no and 
this time Cabell finally took advantage of the reclama that 
Bundy had extended to Bissell. .The President was awakened. 
Cabell registered his concern. The answer was still no. 
Shortly after that, on Monday morning, April 17., 
Brigadier General Chester Clifton, the President's military 
aide, received word that the Cuban Brigade had landed. They 
had little chance. They were without the ranging fire power 
that the B-26's with their bombs and machine guns had been 
expected to apply against Castro's tanks and artillery as 
they wheeled up Castro's forces camp wfast. He still had 
four jets left, and they were indeed armed with powerful rock-
ets. He used them well against the ships in the bay. Before 
the morning.was done, he had sunk two transports, aboard which 
was the larger part of the .reserve stocks of ammunition, and 
driven off two other, with the rest of the stock. 
Now Kennedy and his strategists became alarMed. About 
noon on. Monday, Bissell was told that the B-26'S could attack 
Castro's airfields at will. Orders went to the.staging base 
for a major attack next morning. But the orders 'came too late, 
Most of the pilots had been in the air for upwards of eighteen 
hours An an unaVailing effort to keep Castro's planes off the

troops and the remaining ships... That night a small force was 
scratched together. It was over Cuba at dawn, only to find 
the fields hidden by low, impenetrable fog. Nothing came of 
the try. 
Tuesday, the second day, was the turning point. The men 
ashore had fought bravely and gained their planned objectives. 
They had even seized and bulldozed the airfield.' But they 
were desperately short of ammunition and food, and under the 
pressure .of Castro's superior fire power and numbers they 
were being forced back across the beach; three B-26'.s trying 
to help them were shot down. 
Two small landing craft had made rendezvous with two 
remaining supply ships and taken on ammunition and rations; 
but, from where they were, they could not reach the beach until 
after daybreak, at which time Castro's jets were certain to 
get them. There remained still one last clear chance to make 
the thing go. Boxer was still on station. The release of a 
few of its jets simply for air cover should see the two craft 
safely to the shore. 
"Defeat is an orphan" 
That night Kennedy was caught up in a White House recep-
tion, a white-tie affair, for Congress and the members of 
his Cabinet. He was informed by an aide that Bissell wished 
to see him. The President asked Bissell to come to the White 
House. Calls went out to the other principals--to Rusk, who 
had been entertaining the Greek Premier at a formal dinner at 
the State Department, to McNamara, General Lemnitzer, Admiral 
Burke. 
They gathered in the President's office shortly after 
midnight. One of the participants recalls: "Two men domina-
ted that singular oceasion�the Presidgfit and Bissell. Bissell 
was in the unhappy posture of having to present the views of 
an establishment that had been overtaken by disaster. He did 
so with control, with dignity, and with clarity." Bissell 
made it plain that the expedition was at the point of no re-
turn; unless U.S. airpower was brought forward, the men on 
the beach were doomed. In substance, he asked that the 
Boxer's planes be brought into the battle to save the opera-
tion. Rusk still would not have this. Several others were 
also opposed, including the President's personal staffers. 
Burke vouched for the worth of Bissell's proposition. The dis!.. 
cussion with the President lasted until 2:00 A.M. Its outcome 
was a singular compromise. Jets from the Boxer would provide 
cover next morning for exactly one hour--from 6:30 to 7:30 A.M.,

mam�

just long enough for the ships to run into the shore and 
start unloading, and for the remaining B-26's to get in a hard 
blow. 
Next morning, through an incredible mischance, the B-26's 
were over Cuba half an hour ahead of schedule. Boxer's jets 
were still on the flight deck. But Castro's jets were ready. 
Two of the B-26's were shot down; others were hit and forced 
to abort. That was the melancholy end. At two-thirty that 
afternoon, Bissell received word from one of his men aboard a� 
ship An the Bay of Pigs,: remnants of the landing force were 
in the water and under fire. There was a final message from 
the gallant Brigade'commander ashore to this effect, "I have 
nothing left to fight with and so cannot wait. Am headed for 
the swamp." Bissell went'to the White House to report the end. 
Kennedy gaveorders for a destroyer to move into the bay and 
pick up as many men as it could. It was no Dunkirk. Only a 
few of the 1,400 were saved. 
"Victory," Kennedy noted some days later, "has a hundred 
fathers, and defeat is an orphan." Yet, for all Kennedy's 
outward calmness at this moment of defeat, he was never, 
after it, quite the same. Speaking before the American Society 
of Newspaper Editors, a grave President said, "There are from 
this sobering episode useful lessons for all to learn."
