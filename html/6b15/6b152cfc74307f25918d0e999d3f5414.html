 7 July 1966
 ARGENTINA
 The Illia government was overthrown on June 27
 primarily because it failed to satisfy the army
 high command that it could take positive action to
 solve national problems and prevent the Peronists
 from winning the congressional elections scheduled
 for March 1967.
 The generals had been preparing a contingency plan
 since early in 1966, and the coup was swift and
 bloodless.   The coup was greeted with some enthus-
 iasm in Argentina because almost all sectors of the
 population were convinced that Illia was unable to
 make progress in either the economic or political
 sphere.
 After a series of cabinet meetings, the generals
 soon realized that Illia's promises were empty and
 decided to move.   There was no military opposition,
 since the one troop commander who opposed the coup
 was arrested when the coup began.
 The new president, retired general Juan Carlos
 Ongania,  is the country's most respected military

 officer and clearly the choice of all sectors for
 the presidency.
 F
 He is considered an effective leader.
 Ongania has established a streamlined cabinet of
 civilian technicians to head the key ministries and
 has been given supreme powers by a "Statute of the
 Revolution" which in a sense supercedes the consti-
 tution.                             All elected and appointed officials have
 been dismissed, and the government has made no
 committment to hold elections or return to demo-
 cratic government.
 The new government has taken no repressive actions
 against politicians and has permitted a free press.
 It has closed the offices of all politicial parties
 and may plan to take further action against Commu-
 nists, who are now in hiding.
 Reaction among Peronist groups was surprisingly
 mild and indicates that Ongania was able to work
 out an agreement with the Peronists before the
 coup.   He has promised social and labor reform,
 but the truce between the government and the Peron-
 ists may not last beyond the first labor crisis that
 Ongania will face.

 The government's foreign policy will probably not
 change significantly, except that Argentina may be-
 come more decisive in supporting US hemispheric
 policies.
 Its Vietnam policy of giving humane
 assistance but not sending troops will probably
 not change.
 Most governments in Western Europe have resumed
 relations with the new regime, but states in the
 Western Hemisphere have been more reluctant to
 take steps in the face of US moves to suspend re-
 lations.   However, Bolivia was quick to resume ties
 and it is expected that many of the other states,
 especially neighboring countries, will follow suit.

 BOLIVIA
 T.  Rene Barrientos and his Bolivian Revolutionary
 Front (FRB) won a decisive victory in the 3
 July national elections.  Although final re-
 sults are not known at this time, the FRB is
 guaranteed a majority of the 102 deputy and 27
 senatorial seats.
 A.      The Christian Democratic Community, a front
 for the rightist Bolivian Socialist Fa-
 lange, and Victor Andrade's faction of the
 Nationalist Revolutionary Movement are pres-
 ently running second and third respectively
 in a close race.
 TI.   The Barrientos regime will be faced with a va-
 riety of new and inherited problems when it
 takes office on 6 August.
 A.      The FRB is not a cohesive, disciplined po-
 litical force and may disintegrate in the
 near future.   Thus the new president will
 have to rebuild his political base, possibly
 moving his political philosophy to the right
 because of military pressure.

 B.    Barrientos will also be faced with several
 chronic economic. problems,  including a
 budget deficit.   The unfamiliarity of the
 new leaders with these problems may cause
 considerable delay in developing an eco-
 nomic program.
 C.   The major problem for Barrientos is to ob-
 tain the withdrawal of the armed forces
 from active control of the government.   As
 in the past, General Alfredo Ovando is the
 key to future government-military rela-
 tions.   Ovando reportedly told foreign cor-
 respondents on 4 July that "the armed forces
 will observe the new government and will
 act again if they think that the interests
 of the people are not well served."   Ovando
 did not set a limit on how long the military
 would give Barrientos to prove himself.   If
 an issue develops between these two mutually
 antagonistic men, there could be trouble.

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 Joaquin Balaguer, who won the 1 June election with
 57 percent of the vote,  assumed office on 1 July.
 In his inaugural address Balaguer outlines the
 moderate reformist measures which he appears deter-
 mined to carry out during his four-year term.
 These measures include
 --establishing a respect for law and order,
 --an end to special privileges and corruption,
 --an austerity program which he warned would be
 painful.
 Balaguer also promised
 --to purge politics from the government-owned
 enterprises,  especially the debt-ridden Domin-
 ican Sugar Corporation,
 --an all inclusive agrarian reform program.
 So far there has been little reaction to Balaguer's
 appointments, which include a 13-man cabinet dominated
 by nine members of his Reformist Party or splinter
 groups which supported his candidacy.

 --Three cabinet positions were given to leading
 members of the opposition Dominican Revolution-
 ary Party;
 --their inclusion in the cabinet is viewed as a
 victory for Balaguer and could weaken Juan
 Bosch's position as the leader of the opposi-
 tion.
 The retention of Defense Minister Perez y Perez in-
 dicates that the President plans no immediate sweeping
 changes in the military establishment.   Perez y Perez
 has done a creditable job but is not particularly
 popular among his fellow officers.
 Since the elections extreme leftist elements have made
 no effort to stir up trouble.   Apparently this results
 from a decision-on their part not to provoke the gov-
 ernment while they are reassessing their position in
 view of Balaguer's victory.
 --They are expected to bide their time recruiting
 new members and trying to infiltrate the govern-
 ment, until Balaguer's popularity has been weak-
 ened by the realities of having to govern or
 until such time as the government clamps down
 on their activities.

 In foreign policy,  the Balaguer government
 --has already taken steps to reestablish rela-
 tions with the Duvalier regime in neighboring
 Haiti;
 --ruled out any possibility of recognizing
 Castro's Cuba, considered to be both politically
 and ideologically outside the Western Hemisphere;
 --favors purely commercial relations with the
 "socialist countries."
 The first contingents of the Inter-American Peace
 Force left the Dominican Republic just before Balaguer's
 inauguration.
 --Unless serious trouble erupts the entire force
 is expected to be out of the country before the
 end of September.
 --Balaguer has the option to request a delay in
 the withdrawal if necessary.

 Recent rioting in Colon and Panama City by Communist-

 urban economic and social problems;
 --Widespread unemployment and crowded slum con-
 ditions in the cities adjacent to the Canal
 Zone,
 --the existence of a volatile extremist-led
 student population.
 --Together,  they enhance the likelihood of minor
 incidents exploding into major crises.
 The alleged repressive measures of security forces
 in Colon, and Panama City left the residents embittered;
 the prevailing antigovernment mood could well cause
 further outbursts at any time.
 President Robles, faced with the most serious threat

 parties to replace the 13 that existed before all parties
 were abolished in October 1965.

 According to the constitution, elections must be
 held by late 1968.   They will use proportional rep-
 resentation, an electoral system which favors the
 pro-Burnham Negroes  (44 percent of the population).
 --Burnham is afraid that he might not win the
 next election because the voting strength of
 the pro - Cheddi Jagan East Indians, who
 now amount to 50 percent of the population,
 is increasing rapidly;
 --Burnham would like to J.mport` Negroes ..from
 other parts of the Caribbean or join Guyana
 in a federation with predominantly Negro
 Caribbean nations to offset East Indian vot-
 ing strength;
 Both the government and the opposition political
 forces are beset with difficulties.
 --Premier Burnham's coalition government is an
 unnatural mixture of UF conservatives and
 PNC pragmatic socialists which got together
 only because its leaders  (who do not like
 each other)  are determined to keep PPP's
 Jagan out of office;

 --Many times D'Aguiar has threatened to leave
 the government because of Burnham's "fiscal
 irresponsibility," and because Burnham has
 not consulted him on government policies;
 --Recently, however, he has stated he will re-
 main in government at least until the 1968
 elections;
 --Burnham would like to govern without D'Aguiar
 and the UF, but he needs the extra votes.
 Various leaders of Jagan's Pro-Communist People's
 Progressive Party--the PPP--have wanted the party to
 use violence against the Burnham government.  Jagan,
 however, fears that Burhham's government might take
 extreme repressive measures against himself and the
 PPP and has been unable to make up his mind whether
 to risk violence.  This indecision has prevented the
 PPP from acting effectively.
 Although the Burnham government is slowly improving
 the country's economic prospects, it still faces
 serious challenges.

 I.     At this time Venezuela is one of the more polit-

 Latin America.  Although it has been beset in
 recent years by numerous political problems, the
 government has successfully weathered all storms.
 One of

 FALN--the Armed Forces of National Libera-

 slight and
 through mid-April 1966/has been for the most
 part purely defensive, however, and many PCV
 and MIR leaders now want to abandon violence
 in favor of more legitimate political action.

 and demoralized.   Funds for terrorist
 activities have been almost non-existent
 since last summer.

 2.   On 18 March,  President Raul Leoni freed
 from prison four leaders of the PCV and
 the MIR who have professed the futility
 of the armed struggle.   Three of these
 were sent into exile.
 B.    Those favoring non-violence   are facing
 a split in the PCV/M.IR party leadership.
 The more militant members who favor expanded
 guerrilla and terrorist operations have bolted
 the established parties.and set up their own FALN,
 apparently with Cuban support.
 C.   About 250 guerrillas are still in the field,
 although generally inactive for the moment.
 They are supported by about 500 urban sy~npa-
 thi_zers, many of them in the universities,
 who act as couriers, supply clothing and
 medicine, and print and distribute propa-

 and denouncing the government.

 Fidel Castro's vigorous appearance on 29 June when
 he delivered his first public address since 1 May,
 and his 90-minute interview with a Western corre-
 spondent on 5 July, dispel recent rumors concern-
 ing his state of health and changes in his polit-
 ical position.
 --withdrawal from public view in May and June
 and increasingly bellicose behavior during
 the past six months, however, may reflect
 Castro's personal frustration over the re-
 gime's inability to resolve basic economic
 and administrative problems;
 --administrative purges of medium level gov-
 ernment officials in March and April and the
 March show trial of two army majors prob-
 ably largely aimed at restoring revolution-
 ary dynamism to the regime and at discouraging
 other would-be plotters against Castro;
 --this spring Castro attacked the leaders of
 Communist China, Chile, and Yugoslavia and on
 1 May implicitly criticized USSR for not giv-

 soldier by a sentry at the Guantanamo Naval
 Base on 21 May;
 --Castro may have believed the US was contem-

 he was concerned about Cuban exile threats
 and alleged assassination plots;
 --Castro probably escalated the "crisis" to di-
 vert public attention from pressing economic
 difficulties, to test the efficiency of the
 Cuban defensive system, to provide training
 for the armed forces, and to flush out "coun-
 terrevolutionaries."
 Castro's position apparently remains pre-eminent;
 nevertheless, several other military and party fig-

 Dorticos'  stock, in particular, continues to rise.

 sition that "as the revolution grows stronger,
 individuals become less important,"--a reflec-

 Party and the continuing institutionalization
 of the regime under its aegis;

 Castro recognizes that he has no alternative to con-

 a result continues to favor Moscow while relations
 with China have been deteriorating.
 Castro probably no longer views all of Latin America
 as on the brink of revolution but zeroes in on spe-

 and Guatemala.

 and business groups and has made constructive
 efforts to allay their suspicions of his liberal
 bent.
 II.   Guatemala's security problems continue.
 A.     Since early May,  the Communist Party action arm,
 the FAR, has kidnapped three high-level govern-
 ment officials and two youths and has engaged in
 other, familiar hit-and-run terrorist activities.
 On 24 June, a wealthy attorney was kidnaped and
 later released for $100,000 ransom.
 B.     The three government hostages have been used to
 pressure for the release of Communists imprisoned
 by the government in early March.   Some of the
 Communist prisoners are known. to have been exe-
 cuted, but the government has publicly main-
 tained that the terrorists'  claim that their
 cohorts are being held is fiction.
 C.   One of the kidnapped government officials es-
 caped on 9 June,  and provided information which
 may help security forces trail the terrorists
 and locate the other victims.
 D.   Two youths kidnapped on 8 June are being held

 tension because of the government's inability to
 halt terrorist activity, but the apprehension so
 far has not come close to the near-panic which the
 capital experienced last December when the level
 of terrorism reached its height.
 IV.. Although the successful transition from military
 to civilian government has done much to dissipate
 the politically tense atmosphere prevailing a few
 months ago, prospects for stability remain uncer-
 tain.
 A.   As a civilian and a liberal, Mendez as presi-

 The Congo and Mobutu
 The Congo has come a long way from the nadir of late
 1964, particularly since Mobutu took over last No-
 vember.   But progress still seems slight when com-
 pared with the problems that remain..
 The rebellion. is now largely confined to rural pockets;
 almost all important roads and population centers are
 in government hands.   Reasons for government progress
 include
 --continued use of mercenaries,
 --popular disillusionment with rebellion,
 --virtually complete cutoff of outside support
 to rebels,
 --some improvement in the Congolese army's ef-
 fectiveness.
 With the rebellion?s decline giving him some room to
 maneuver, Mobutu is giving almost all his attention.
 to enhancing his authority inside the country and
 improving the Congo's image in Africa.   In the pro-
 cess, he has taken, several important actions, some
 of them spectacular.   He:

 --discredited Tshombe, his most formidable rival,
 --sought to identify himself as anticolonialist
 and pan-Africanist,

 An important part of this effort--and one with a con-
 siderable emotional charge for Mobutu as well as for
 other Congolese--is the campaign against Belgian,
 economic pre-eminence,  a campaign. in which the Con-
 golese 'won, substantial Belgian concessions through
 intransigent negotiating tactics.
 The new situation in the Congo has several implica-

 may be increasingly reserved in. its aid;

 II.      If the rebel regime would return to temporary

 increasing African enfranchisement, guarantees

 voting rights, and some moves against racially

 III.   Although Britain is anxious for a settlement,
 it apparently is willing to delay negotiations

 IV.   It is uncertain if a continuation of the sanc

 A.   The sanctions have hurt some businesses,
 the tobacco crop has not sold as well as
 the rebel regime hoped,  and a continua-

 Consequently, some Rhodesian businessmen
 have pressed Prime Minister Smith to come
 to terms with Britain.
 B.   However, white militants within Smith's po-

 have been hurt by tobacco sanctions, have
 recently become more recalcitrant against
 concessions to  Britain.   They seem to be

 C.    Smith himself may be prepared to reach a

 Rhodesia legal independence without a time-

 such a settlement will be politically
 more acceptable within the Rhodesian white

 kind of settlement which Britain now apparently
 contemplates.

 DCI BRIEFING NOTES
 GHANA
 1.      In Ghana, where the radical regime of President
 Kwame Nkrumah fell apart last February while he
 was in Peking, the new leaders are Western.-
 oriented political moderates.
 A.    The senior army and police officers who
 staged the coup had long been, dissatisfied
 with Nkrumah's arbitrary rule, his ties with
 Communist countries, and his economic follies.
 B. Since their take-over, they have given every
 indication. of being particularly friendly to
 the United States.
 II.   The change of regime has been popular with the
 general public.   Nkrumah had alienated virtually
 all segments of society since he led Ghana to
 independence nine years ago.
 A.    One of the most significant factors in the
 erosion of his once massive popularity was
 the tightening economic squeeze felt at all
 levels in recent years as Ghana's economy
 deteriorated.

 A.       General policy is set by a National Libera-
 tion council of four army and four police
 officers, all of whom are pro-Western*   it
 is headed by popular General Joseph Ankrah,
 Nkrumah last year.

 B.     The Council is backed up by several specialized
 committees dealing with such matters as
 foreign affairs and the economy.   The committees
 are staffed by able; and, for the most part
 Western-oriented senior civil servants.
 C.  Recently the NLC yielded to pressure from
 the former opposition United Party and set
 up a 23-member political advisory committee.
 D.  For the present all political parties and
 activity have been proscribed, but some such
 activity is in fact going on.
 E.  Over 1,000 Nkrumah regime opponents were re-
 leased from detention and others have re-
 turned from exile.   In turn, at least 500
 Nkrumah regime activists were incarcerated,
 including cabinet ministers and members of
 the dissolved parliament.   Small groups of
 of these are now being released.

 IV.  The new leaders have promised to return-Ghana to
 representative civilian government, but evidently
 will be in no hurry to do so.
 A.       They are publicly committed to sponsoring a
 new constitution., holding a referendum, and
 then to turning power over to Whatever po-
 litical force emerges from free elections.
 B.       However, General Ankrah has indicated
 the country must first undergo a
 period of re-education. for 18 months to two
 years.
 C.       In the economic sphere, which offers the most
 pressing problems, the new regime appears to
 have a sound appreciation. of the magnitude of
 its task and a determination to take whatever
 austerity measures are required to get the
 economy on an even keel again.
 1.   In addition. to the emergency aid provided
 by the International Monetary Fund and the
 US, help has already been forthcoming from
 West Germany, Canada, and the UK.
 2.   A three-month respite from external debts
 was won in June from the creditor nations.

 V.      In external affairs, the new government has greatly
 reduced Ghana's involvement with the Communist
 world and aligned it with the moderate African.
 states.
 A.  All Soviet and Chinese technicians have been
 expelled and the Soviet and Chinese embassies
 are limited to 18 persons.   A complete rupture
 with Peking may still be coming.   The Albanian,
 North Vietnamese, and North Korean. embassies
 have been. closed.
 B.  Most Ghanaian embassies in bloc countries are
 being closed down, and efforts are under way
 to reduce the number of Ghanaian students
 (about 1,000) there.
 C.  In. Africa the new regime has won general ac-
 ceptance,  and relations with moderate neighbor-
 ing states have markedly improved.
 VI.   Provided no serious split develops.within the
 ruling junta, the new regime seems securely  in
 power for sometime to come.
 A.   Unavoidable additional economic hardships this
 spring and summer may well accelerate the nor-
 mal dissipation of some of the post-coup elation.

 dreams of making a comeback.
 1.   Guinea's Sekou Toure welcomed him to
 Conakry and made threatening noises about
 a forceful restoration, but neither Toure

 from his extreme pro-Nkrumah stance and
 has begun. to back off.

 NIGERIA
 (MAP)
 1.    Africa's most populous country (about 50,000,000)
 has been. ruled by its 10,000-man army since lower
 echelon. officers initiated a bloody coup on 15
 January.
 A.   The upheaval swept away the old power struc-
 ture over which conservative northern. Muslims
 had steadily tightened their grip since in-
 dependence in 1960.
 1.   The former federal prime minister and
 two of four regional premiers were killed
 along with a number of senior army officers.
 2.   However, the new government has found It
 necessary to retain. much of the old admin-
 istrative network.
 B.          Although the coup was initially accepted with
 considerable enthusiasm throughout the country,
 the future of Nigeria remains very uncertain.
 It has been a stronghold of moderate Africa.
 Approved For Release 2                  P79T00827A000300100001-3
 II.    The interim regime was established by army com-
 mander Ironsi  (Maj. Gen. Aguiyi-Iron.si), who in
 effect took over the coup from the younger con-
 spirators.                                   The regime is reformist rather than
 revolutionary in outlook.
 A.    It has promised to maintain domestic peace,
 end corruption and tribalism, and provide
 a new constitution.
 1.   Various investigative and study commis-
 sions will be working on. the country's
 problems for some time with military
 rule continuing for at least three years.
 B. In foreign affairs the military government
 is generally well disposed toward the West
 and has so far continued the preceding re-
 gime's aloofness toward the Communist world.
 1.   Assurances have been. given. that foreign
 investments will be safeguarded.
 2.   However, a more forcefully African. pos-
 ture is taking shape.
 III. Internally the country is headed for a stronger
 central government, but there is strong opposi-
 tion in the north to the government's reforms.
 Approved For Release 2              - DP79T00827A000300100001-3
 A.    Ironsi's speech on May 24 announcing plans
 for a unitary government and a unified civil
 service provoked antigovernment demonstra-
 tions in. several northern cities.
 1.    Mobs of rioting Hausas attacked the
 homes and businesses of Ibo tribesmen
 from the south; over 100 persons were
 reportedly killed and several hundred
 injured.   Order was restored in about
 a week.
 B.   The simultaneous nature of the demonstrations
 may indicate some coordination among northern,
 political leaders and civil servants.
 C.   The north has been unhappy for some time over
 the January coup, which many view as  an  "Ibo
 takeover."
 1.    Northern civil servants fear--with good
 reason--that they will be replaced by
 better qualified southerners in. open
 competition  in  a unified civil service
 system.
 2.    Since the disturbances,  the government
 has virtually retracted its stand on
 centralization.   It has also indicated

 a willingness to discuss important mat-
 ters affecting the north with the tradi-
 tional leaders there.
 D.   Tensions and tribal enmities probably will
 continue with the possibility of renewed
 outbreaks of violence in the north or in
 other parts of the country.
 IV.    An early breakdown of discipline in the army,
 which has its own. intertribal tensions,  con.-
 tinues possible.
 A.   There was reluctance to test the army's
 cohesiveness during the recent disturb-
 ances in the north.   At best,  the ability
 of the country's relatively small  (police
 18,000; Army 10,000) security forces to en-
 sure law and order is problematical.
 1.   The younger officers active in the Jan-
 uary coup remain a problem.   Ironsi has
 placed most of them in detention, but
 apparently dares not punish them as they
 are widely regarded as heroes.
 2.   Some Western observers anticipate more
 coups by army elements.

 1.   In Algeria,  Col. Boumediene's control remains
 unchallenged.   Rumors of impending government

 A.    He is moving slowly to untangle the prob-

 of development programs and technical and

 --The government of Mrs. Gandhi believes strongly,
 however, that meaninlu -]ndian concessions on the
 status of Kashmir now would be political suicide
 with general elections coming up next February.
 --Deep seated suspicions concerning Pakistan's
 intentions further limit New Delhi's willing-
 ness to cooperate.
 Pakistan's President Ayub, on the other hand, is under
 heavy pressure to show some progress on Kashmir.
 --Pakistan may decide to take the problem back

 The Ayub government has shown continued interest in
 maintaining close relations with the Chinese Communists.
 --Military hardware supplied by China was paraded
 through the streets of Rawalpindi during the
 March 23rd Republic Day parade.
 --The intended message to India was clear:   China
 stands behind Pakistan in any future subcontinental
 quarrel,
 Ayub also has tried to avoid antagonizing the US.   He
 is vitally interested in the continuation of US economic
 aid (recently resumed), and may hope that Washington
 eventually will permit the renewal of shipments of
 arms and spare parts.
 The Tashkent Declaration of January 10th eased much
 of the tension created last fall during the fighting
 between India and Pakistan, but the basic underly-
 ing problems remain.   There also has been a gradual
 dissipation of the 9 I'ashken.t spirit."
 The first round'of cabinet level talks held in Rawal-

 Efforts by India and Pakistan to involve the USSR

 and the nearly concurrent removal from the

 position on East-West relations in the light
 of recent developments.

 Socialism."
 A.    Foreign trade is still declining and foreign
 exchange reserves have dwindled.
 B.    Artificial shortages in consumer commodities
 have developed as a result of the government's
 inept handling of the distribution system.
 C.    Two widely publicized actions by the govern-

 D.    Ne Win admitted recently that the economy is
 in a "terrific, mess," but he declined to
 offer any new policies.
 II.   Ne Win has been similarly unsuccessful in coping
 with the problem of mounting insurgency.
 A.    Although insurgency normally rises at the
 beginning of the dry season in October, the
 level of activity now appears to be some-
 what higher than usual.
 B.    Ne Win reportedly estimates that his govern-
 ment now controls only 65 percent of the coun-
 try,  as compared to 75 percent four years ago.
 III.   The government continues its policy of neutrality,
 nonalignment,  and noninvolvement in international
 affairs.
 A.    Ne Win, however, is sometimes compelled to
 assume a more accommodating posture toward
 Communist China than he probably desires be-
 cause of the latter's vastly superior might
 and close proximity.
 IV.   Ne Win's government is unlikely to undergo any
 significant changes in the foreseeable future,
 barring some external development which pro-
 foundly affects Burma's interests.

 A.  Economic problems will persist, but aid
 from abroad, abundant natural resources, and
 the moderate needs of the agricultural
 masses should prevent a sudden collapse.
 B.  Insurgency will remain a constant drain
 upon the government's resources and will
 continue to be the major obstacle to the po-
 litical and economic integration of the
 country.
 V.    Tide Ne Win regime is not currently endangered
 because:(1) the populace remains apathetic;
 (2) the insurgents lack unity and centralized
 direction; and (3) the army remains essentially
 ,loyal despite certain misgivings about Ne

 power in February from the relatively moderate lead-
 ers of the Baath party is still trying to broaden
 its base of support and is. threatened by increas-

 Lebanon accordingly was postponed, but
 Lebanon and Jordan are planning to construct
 two related dams which Arab leaders do not
 consider to be "provocative."
 C.    The decision to slow down was prompted by
 the exposure of Arab military weakness in
 the face of Israel's artillery strikes
 against Syrian canal construction sites on
 three occasions last year.

 The Communists in Thailand appear determined to
 step up the pace of their subversion.
 Peking-based "Thai Patriotic Front," marked its
 first anniversary last December by calling for "armed
 struggle" in Thailand to be expanded into a "people:'s
 war," andnow openly warning that the "Vietnamese
 people" may become involved in Thailand.
 Front's statement is pegged to the recent announce-
 ment that a small Thai military contingent is going
 to South Vietnam.   The statement also puts great
 emphasis on the expanding US presence in Thailand,
 apparently in an effort to  portray- the Communist
 movement as a struggle for independence.
 The Communists inside Thailand have become more
 active during the past several weeks.   A marked

 increase in the pace of Communist terrorism, train-
 ing, and recruiting has been noted, principally in
 the northeast provinces.
 On 28 May, a 22-man government police patrol was
 ambushed by an estimated 100 insurgents in Nong Khai
 Province, and on 28 June, terrorists boldly entered
 a police station in Udorn Province and seriously
 wounded three policemen.
 The Communists have also launched their first
 attacks against regular Thai Army elements in the
 northeast, with a small attack and ambush in Ubon
 and Sakhon Nakhon provinces in mid-May.
 In part, the insurgents appear to be reacting
 more aggressively to recent government suppression
 operations.
 The Thai government, continues to give strong
 backing to US foreign policy, particularly in South-
 east Asia.   The Thais have been reassured over the
 past year by US determination in South Vietnam.
 Thailand's material contribution to the effort
 in South Vietnam has been largely confined to al-
 lowing the US to fly reconnaissance and combat mis-
 sions into Laos and North Vietnam from Thai bases.

 Although they have recently agreed to send two

 the Thais remain generally reluctant to provide
 South Vietnam with combat troops or significant
 military or economic aid.
 The traditional animosity between Thailand and
 Cambodia has in recent months erupted into a se-
 ries of armed clashes at isolated border posts along
 the 400-mile frontier.
 The situation is aggravated by Thailand's support
 of the anti-Sihanouk movement of dissident Cambodians
 known as the Khmer Serei, who have made several
 forays into Cambodia from Thai territory, provoking
 Cambodian counteroperations..

 the island have risen with the
 summer heat.
 Bombings, kidnapings, and other incidents have mul-
 tiplied on both sides; twice since 1 June Makarios
 has clamped restrictions on the freedom of movement
 of Turkish Cypriots to and from the Turkish quarter
 of Nicosia.  He claims that Turkish Cypriots are
 guilty of bombings in the Greek sector of the city.
 Turkish Cypriot reaction to the first ban was a .

 to a provocation that jeopardizes its basic rights
 on the island.
 The Turk's failure to respond with force in this
 situation also may undermine the confidence of
 the Turkish Cypriot community that Ankara really
 intends to protect Turkish Cypriot rights.
 Makarios'  policies have won him no friends in the
 world forum, but the Turkish Cypriot reaction gives
 credibility to his argument that cooperation with
 the Turkish community is impossible.

 that Greek Cypriots do not resume construction.

 to "solve" the issue if negotiations fail.   Other

 Should the Greek Cypriots fail to keep the upper-
 hand in the Trypimeni issue, Makarios will likely
 remind Athens that the problem was in its hands,
 and the longstanding feud between Makarios and
 Grivas could resume.
 Both Greece and Turkey seem to hope to make a suc-

 neither has given any indication that it is will-

 any attempt to impose a solution on Makarios will
