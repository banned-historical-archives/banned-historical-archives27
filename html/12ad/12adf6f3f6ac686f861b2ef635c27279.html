 TION  OF OFFENSES
 SEC, 18. (a) Whenever it shall appear to

 tion of the provisions of this Act, or of any
 rule or regulation prescribed thereunder, it
 may, In its discretion, bring an action In any
 district court of the United States, or the
 United States District court for the District
 of Columbia to enjoin such acts or practices,
 and upon a proper showing a permanent or
 temporary injunction or restraining order
 shall be granted without bond.  The Com-
 mission may transmit such evidence as may
 be available concerning such acts or prac-
 tices to. the Attorney General who may, In
 his  discretion,  institute  the  appropriate
 criminal proceedings under this Act.
 (b) The Commission may, in its discre-
 tion, make such investigations as it deems
 necessary to determine whether any person

 provision of this title or any rule or regula-
 1tion thereunder, and may require or permit
 any person to file with it a statement in
 Writing, under oath or otherwise as the Com-
 mission shall determine, as to all the factq
 and circumstances concerning the matter to
 be investigated,  The Commission is author-
 ized, in its discretion, to publish information

 rules and regulations thereunder, or in secur-
 ing information to serve as. a basis for recom-
 mending further legislation concerning the
 matters to which this title relates.
 (c) For the purpose of any such investi-
 gation, or any other proceeding under this
 title, any member of the Commission or any
 officer designated by it is empowered to ad-
 minister oaths and affirmations, subpena
 witnesses, compel their attendance, take evi-
 dence, and require the production of any
 books,  papers,  correspondence,  memoran-
 dums, or other records which the Commis-
 sion deems relevant or material to the in-
 quiry.                        Such attendance of witnesses and
 the production of any such records may be

 respondence, memorandums, and other rec-
 ords, if in his power so to do, in obedience

 vidual shall be prosecuted or subject to any

 tion and punishment for perjury committed

 ing by the Commission that the registration

 thority from time to time to make, issue,

 tions and such orders as are necessary or

 U THANT'S COUNSEL
 the American people have every reason
 to be distressed over the intensity of the
 civil war in which this administration
 has involved us in Vietnam.  Recent
 events point up the terrible extension of
 this fighting and slaughter which has
 been going on for years in Vietnam. The
 immolation of Buddhists in the insurrec-
 tion and revolt against Prime Minister
 Ky is becoming increasingly terrifying.

 The magazine Oregon Education, in Its
 May, issue, reports the effects of smoking
 on young people and bases its shocking
 statement of the effect of smoking on
 teenagers on a recent report of the Amer-
 ican Cancer Society.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the article entitled "The Im-
 mediate Effects of Smoking on Young
 People" be printed at the conclusion of
 my remarks.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF SMOKING ON
 'YOUNG  PEOPLE
 (By Charles Starr and Wade B. Patterson)
 The American Public Health Association
 has stated that one million school-age chil-
 dren today are expected to die of lung
 cancer before they reach the age of 70.
 Others have also predicted that 4,000,000 to
 5,000,000 more will the from other diseases
 relating to smoking such as cancer of the
 bladder, emphysema, and cardiovascular dis-
 eases.
 These predictions startle us and we realize
 that we must redouble our efforts to educate
 young people on the effects of smoking and
 change their attitudes so that they may be
 better prepared in dealing with the smoking
 question.  In accomplishing this objective,
 we may well stress the immediate effects as
 well as the long range effects of tobacco
 usage.  The immediate effects of smoking on
 young people can be broken down into the
 external physical effects, the internal physi-
 cal effects, the economic effects, and the so-
 cial effects.
 EXTERNAL EFFECTS
 Any person who smokes cigarettes regularly
 is going to have characteristic external effects
 that become part of his personality.  Among
 these are bad breath, which is seldom im-
 proved by eating life-savers; a smell of smoke
 on the clothes, the hair and the body, and
 a , yellowish-brown stain on the fingers and
 often on the teeth.
 fVTE"RNAL EFFECTS
 The internal physical effects are less known,
 but more dramatic in their serious conse-
 quences.
 We know, for example, that cigarette smoke
 contains compounds such as ammonia which
 irritate  the  throat  anal  nasal  passages.
 Tobacco irritants cause a progressive paral-
 ysis of the cilia and an increased secretion
 of mucus in the presence of foreign particles.
 The paralysis of the cilia and the increased
 mucus cause the need for coughing to relieve
 irritation in the bronchial passages.  This
 coughing may become persistent and open
 the way for bronchitis and other respiratory
 problems.
 Cigarette smoking is known to cause con-
 striction of arteries, increased pulse rate
 (10-15 beats per minute) and increase in
 blood pressure.  The exchange of gases in the
 air sacs 1,& the lungs is less efficient.  As a
 result, there is an extra demand on the heart
 to increase the flow of blood to supply
 enough oxygen to the cells.  This factor,
 along with carbon-monoxide displacement of
 oxygen in red blood cells, hinders the per-
 formance of athletes in strenuous sports,
 Dr. Milton Brinton reports that the smoker's
 lung capacity is 30 per cent less than the
 non-smoker.  Cigarette smoke slows down
 digestion and may cause dizziness, decreases
 appetite and may affect the diet, increases
 the -chances for ulcers.  It also weakens the
 taste buds on the tongue, thus food is less
 tasty.
 Statistics show that smoking increases the
 chances of a young woman giving birth to a
 premature and undernourished baby.  Pre-
 mature birth rate for non-smokerss, in a study
 conducted on nearly 3,000 Baltimore women
 was 11.2 per cent as opposed to 22.9 per cent
 for heavy smokers.  The death rate of chil-
 dren from smoking mothers was 16 out of
 every 1,000 births whereas, the non-smoking
 mothers only lost 6 children per 1,000 births,
 or less than one half the babies lost by the
 mothers that smoked.
 Thirty-six per cent of the women who
 smoke have menstrual disorders compared
 with 18 per cent in non-smokers.
 ECONOMIC EFFECTS
 Cigarette smoking has economic effects on
 the individual, both long range and immedi-
 ate.                                                                             A person who smokes only one pack of
 cigarettes a day for one year will have spent
 around $100, depending on the state in which
 he lives.  This can add up fast, especially
 it he increases his habit to two or three packs
 a day.
 -The cost of cigarette smoking, according to
 the Spokane Public Schools, is as follows:
 Packs smoked
 per day
 -----------------
 1%---------------
 3-----------------
 68 per cent showed decreases in grades of 10
 per cent to failure.  The non-smokers had
 better grades and took tougher subjects than
 the smokers.
 Teens who are particular, may prefer dates
 who do not smoke.  As one teen-ager in Spo-
 kane, Washington, stated, "Nothing cools
 love's flame faster than the sickening odor
 of cigarette breath."
 From a social point of view, most teen-
 agers have an effect on their fellow students.
 Their habits and attitudes concerning smok-
 ing may influence others not to start, to start,
 or to stop.  The American Cancer Society's
 Annual Report (1964) states that the Gilbert
 Youth Research, Inc., survey in 1958 showed
 that 33 per cent of the American high school
 students said they smoked cigarettes.  A sec-
 ond survey carried out in 1963, showed that
 the percentage of teen-agers who said they
 smoked had dropped to 29 per cent.     A 1964
 survey indicated a still further drop in high
 school smoking.  Only 17 per cent of the
 teen-agers said they then smoked.
 Apparently  those  who  once  started  to
 smoke continue; but beginning to smoke is
 far less fashionable. An immediate school
 social effect could be that as time passes on,
 people who are tempted to start smoking will
 get the reputation that they live dangerously,
 that they are not using their intelligence to
 the best of their ability.  In other words, it's
 smart not to start, or it's smart not to smoke,
 When we add to this list of effects of smok-
 Ing, the results of a study in England that
 showed that 80 per cent of the smokers who
 tried their first cigarette in their teens were
 habituated within two years, we soon realize
 that smoking definitely has some very pro-
 found and immediate effects, even on the
 young.  We must therefore, elaborate and
 emphasize these immediate effects as well as
 the long range effects as we attempt to im-
 prove the situation and reduce the predic-
 tion of the American Public Health Asso-
 ciation of 1,000,000 teen-agers dying from just
 lu~Ig cancer before age 70 to none.

 $2,160

 $610

 1,830
 The average teen-ager could save over
 $10,000 (interest included)  in a life-time,
 plus living a healthier life if he would choose
 not to smoke.
 Another important economic effect is the
 cost of smoker's carelessness in fire loss every
 year.  In Oregon alone, smokers cause about
 $2,000,000 in fire loss every year.  This, of
 course, does not include the harm to the
 person and loss of life oftentimes involved.
 One national life insurance company has
 a  5  per  cent  discount in  cost  for  non-
 smokers.                                                                             .Actually the insurance companies
 could offer a bigger discount since it is re-
 ported that 50 per cent more heavier smoker
 are hospitalized than non-smokers.
 SOCIAL EFFECTS
 What does a teen-ager look like when he
 or she has a cigarette hanging out of the
 side of the mouth?  What about the teen
 who puts on an air of sophistication or gla-
 mour?  Does he become more-or less-at-
 tractive   and  acceptable,  to  his  fellow
 students?
 In the Hazelwood Senior High School, Mis-
 souri, the school has created the climate that
 "It's Smart Not To Smoke."  This attitude
 was established through the efforts of the
 school staff and students after an intensive
 campaign designed to inform the students
 about  smoking  hazards.  Many  students
 stopped smoking through social pressures.
 Others have been convinced that it's smart
 not to start.  Campaigns such as this can
 eventually establish a cultural pattern that
 smoking will make one less popular with his
 fellow classmates.
 The social effects of smoking on young
 people can also be pointed out by citing some
 findings of a study of Portland high school
 pupil smoking habits conducted in 1959 by
 the American Cancer Society.  Researchers
 discovered in this study that smokers were
 less successful in social activities; they didn't
 take part in clubs or social groups. They
 found that the smokers were also less suc-
 cessful in athletic activities and showed a
 significant lack of scholastic achievement
 and initiative.
 . George E. Coraker, a teacher from East-
 xidge High School, Rochester, compared non-
 smokers and smokers of similar age, grade,
 and I.Q.  Coraker states that, "Smoking
 tends to  create  disorders of personality
 which causes disorders of memory." Of those
 students starting to smoke In high school,
 OUR ALLIES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
 Mr. McGEE.  Mr. President, one of
 the questions we hear repeatedly in con-
 neotion with this Nation's commitment
 in southeast Asia is, "Where are our
 friends, our allies?"
 Richard Wilson, writing in yesterday's
 Evening Star, has given a large part of
 the answer.  Britain, he points out, has
 succeeded to large degree in protecting
 the State of Malaysia by the commitment
 of about 50,000 troops and $600 million
 in its defense funds.  I would add that
 other allies, too, are contributing in vari-
 ous ways.  Thailand, of course, is hold-
 ing its own on its own territory. Korea,
 Australia, New Zealand and others are
 contributing to the efforts in Vietnam.
 And the British, as Mr. Wilson has re-
 minded readers, are doing a vital job
 of stabilizing the course of events in yet
 another vital area of southeast Asia.  I
 ask unanimous consent, Mr. President,
 that his column in the Evening Star on
 British firmness in southeast Asia be
 printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 sumed  that  the Foundation  will  have a
 recurring annual Income of some six crores
 of rupees if not more.  Even if the Foun-
 dation's  overhead  expenses  are  extremely
 high it will still have at least five crores of
 rupees at its disposal every year for aiding
 educational Institutions and promoting re-
 search.
 This would be a much higher sum than
 what is available to the University Grants
 Commission for similar purposes.  In 1964-
 05 the UGC was able to give grants of Rs
 two crores for the development of scientific
 education and research, Rs One crore for the
 development of education and research in
 the humanities and social sciences, and a
 e:imilar sum for the development of engi-
 neering and technological education.  How-
 ever, this money had to be spread over a very
 large number of institutions and a good part
 of it was spent on the construction of labo-
 ratory buildings and other structures. It is
 possible to suspect that the funds available
 for actual research projects were very meager
 indeed.
 The Indo-American Foundation on the
 Other hand will be in a much happier posi-
 tion.         It will be able to give funds on an
 effective scale for research and other projects
 of its choice.  While the effective promotion
 of research is all to the good, Mrs. Gandhi's
 Government should consider some of the
 other consequences.  Almost every depart-
 :ment in every university and other institu-
 tions of higher education will start looking
 to the new Foundation rather than the UGC
 .for aid and guidance. Scholars who are en-
 thusiastic about a project and are starved for
 funds are not greatly concerned where the
 money comes from.  They are understanda-
 bly anxious to get things done and when
 they  weigh their  chances  of  getting the
 necessary funds they will almost inevitably
 turn toward the Foundation.     The Founda-
 tion in turn will decide what project or
 which institution deserves its assistance.  It
 is not difficult to foresee that within a few
 years the Foundation would come to occupy
 the commanding heights of the educational
 and research scene.
 OTHER PROGRAMMES
 At the moment the foreign aid programmes
 at the university level are operated by the
 University Grants Commission in collabora-
 tion with the relevant Union Ministry. This
 is true not only of the programmes assisted
 by UNESCO, the Soviet Union and Britain;
 it is also true of the programmes financed
 from PL-480 counterpart funds which have
 already been set aside for research projects
 in agricultural, physical and biological scien-
 ces.  But judging from what President John-
 son has said., the proposed Foundation would
 be treated on a very different footing.
 It is not enough to have distinguished
 citizens of both countries on the Founda-
 tion's board. of directors.  It is additionally
 desirable to ensure that the board is mainly
 composed of Indian representatives who while
 having a modern outlook see the country's
 educational  and  research  needs  through
 Indian eyes. This apart, two other things are
 equally necessary. Firstly, the UGC must be
 actively associated with the Indo-American
 Foundation in such a way as to ensure the
 Commission's overall control in the field of
 higher education.  Secondly, the funds at the
 FEARS ABOUT INDO-U.S. FOUNDATION
 UNFOUNDED
 NEw  DELHI,                       April  12.-Dr.  John  Hope
 Franklin. the visiting U.S. historian feels the
 Delhi University teachers' criticism of the
 proposed  Indo-U.S.                    education  foundation
 was premature and a little presumptuous.
 "The underlying assumption seems to be
 that the proposed foundation was meant to
 benefit India alone," he said in an interview
 today.   "I should like to think it might
 benefit Americans as much."
 The fears expressed in the teachers' criti-
 cism were based on conjecture.  "We don't
 know anything about the shape it will take.
 Suppose," Dr. Franklin said, "500 American
 teachers were to be financed by the scheme
 to come and learn Indian history here; who
 would benefit?  Naturally the Americans.  It
 has got to be a two-way affair."
 Visiting India for the :fourth time, Dr.
 Franklin is reviewing the working of the Ful-
 bright programme.                                                                            This is in his capacity
 as vice-chairman of the Board of Foreign
 Scholarships, Washington, to which he was
 appointed by President Kennedy.  "But I am
 not a Government servant," he added with a
 meaningful smile.
 He attaches great importance to exchange
 programmes at the intellectual level.  It was
 a pity, he said that the average American
 was not as knowledgeable about India as an
 average literate Indiafn was about the United
 States.
 And he explained it as though he were in
 his classroom in the University or Chicago,
 For various reasons, historical and otherwise,
 the Americans were so engrossed in their
 own affairs that they did not pay any atten-
 tion to Europe, "leave alone Asia."
 "It was only after the Second War that
 America became a global country; the result
 was that we have a lot to make up," he said.
 Dr. Franklin's answers to  questions  on
 Vietnam and recialism in his country were
 true to his name.  "I hate war, have hated
 it from my childhod, and I know it is not
 the way to solve anything, but then I am not
 clear on the alternatives.  I wish I knew the
 way out," he said.
 CIVIL RIGHTS
 How far had the anti-segregation laws been
 Implemented in the United States, and to
 what effect?                      A sudden change took place
 in the smiling face.  The question seemed
 to have touched the Negro in Dr. Franklin.
 But this lasted a moment.  The affable pro-
 fessor took over again.
 "This has two planks to it: the Civil Rights
 Law of 1984 and the Voting Rights Act of
 1965," the professor said and explained the
 substantial impact the legislation has had
 on the segregationists. But the problem had
 deep roots.  Discrimination in employment
 and housing in a handful of major cities
 which  contained  one-third  of  the  Negro
 population was still an acute and serious
 problem. It was strange, Dr. Franklin agreed,
 that a country so advanced and affluent
 should be so backward emotionally.    It was
 equally strange, he further  agreed, that
 Negroes with all their contribution to Amer-
 ican arts, music and sports should still be
 fighting for civil rights.
 Dr. Franklin felt the problem of civil rights
 would find full and complete solution within
 sufficiently to enable it to promote research           this generation.   As for a change in the
 and development as effectively as the Foun-             feelings and attitudes of the White Suprem-
 dation.  That the Indo-American Foundation                               acists, "it is difficult to predict anything in
 oan do a great deal of good Is obvious enough.          the field of human failings," he said, paused
 Some of its disturbing possibilities might be           and then added: "You can't tell when people
 would stop hating each other."  And there
 was again a far-away look in his eyes.
 [From the Times of India, Apr. 8, 1988]
 MRS. GANDHI ALLAYS MPS' MISGIVINGS?
 INDO-AMERICAN EDUCATION FOUNDATION
 NEW DELHI, April 7.-The Prime Minister,
 Mrs. Indira Gandhi, assured the Executive
 Committee of the Congress Parliamentary
 Party today that the proposed Indo-Ameri-
 can Education Foundation was in the best
 interests of the country and there was no
 basis for any misgivings on this score.
 She and the Education Minister, Mr. M. C.
 Chagla, explained the objects of the founda-
 tion after critical references to it by two
 senior members who asked for further details.
 The Prime Minister is understood to have
 taken strong exception to doubts expressed
 by one member about American intentions.
 She remarked that such an attitude created
 misunderstanding and difficulties.  If doubts
 were expressed about the intentions of coun-
 tries giving aid, they could also entertain
 similar doubts about the recipient country.
 GOVERNMENT'S APPROVAL
 The proposal to have such a foundation
 had been under consideration for some time
 and was approved by the Government last
 year. It would be administered in a manner
 consistent with India's interests and all its
 schemes and programmes would be subject
 to the approval of the Indian Government.
 No money would be spent without prior
 sanction.
 Mr. Chagla sought to remove the wrong
 notion that the foundation might influence
 the Indian way of life and culture.  He said
 that no effort would be made to influence the
 educational system.
 Critics of the foundation were reported to
 have argued that involvement of a foreign
 government in matters affecting the coun-
 try's educational system might lead to serious
 consequences.  Since the foundation was to
 be run by a joint board, there was nothing
 to prevent interference by the donor country.
 It might like to utilize the funds for spread-
 ing the American way of life and culture.
 rn the absence of more details, it would be
 difficult to accept the proposal, they said.
 IMPROPER AND UNFAIR
 One member felt that it was highly im-
 proper and unfair to doubt American inten-
 tions.  India was extremely backward in the
 field of education and was in urgent need
 of technical knowhow.  The U.S. Govern-
 ment had shown a great gesture by deciding
 to invest Rs. 142 crores in the foundation.
 He had no doubt that if the same proposal
 had come from the Soviet Union, it would
 have been readily accepted by the critics.
 Misgivings were also expressed about the
 proposal to route the Western foreign aid
 through the World Bank.  Some members
 asked whether this would not give the aid a
 private sector orientation since the World
 Bank was a private investment agency.
 A reference was also made during discus-
 sions to the protocol in Britain   here the
 visiting Prime Minister of a Commonwealth
 country was received at London airport not
 by his counterpart In Britain but by the
 Commonwealth Relations Secretary. It was
 suggested that the Indian Prime Minister
 should not go to the airport to receive the
 British Prime Minister when he visited India.
 The protocol in this matter should be on a
 reciprocal basis.

 the last gasp of empire, as did the political
 left wing in England.
 The news about Britain's last stand is that
 it has succeeded.  This success causes quiet
 satisfaction in the Johnson administration in
 Washington, and it is not hard to see why.
 The dogged British have demonstrated
 that a Western power's determined resistance
 to Communist-aligned expansion in South-
 east Asia can pay off.  The calculated use of
 strength, and, above all, persistence and
 stubbornness, can have a decisive effect on
 events and on leaders and governments whose
 policies may be forced to change.
 When the infant state of Malaysia was
 created three years ago Indonesia's China-
 oriented dictator, Sukarno, took measure of
 its weakness and decided to lop off part of
 it in Northern Borneo.  The larger part of
 Borneo is Indonesian.   A "confrontation"
 followed that drew down Britian's commit-
 ment to protect the independence of the
 infant state and hold the line against Com-
 munist expansionism in Southeast Asia.
 Last week the new leaders of Indonesia,
 who had brought down Sukarno in an anti-
 Communist blood bath estimated to have
 taken the lives of 300,000 people, brought the
 "confrontation" to an end in a quick agree-
 ment with Malaysia that left Malaysia with
 its portion of North Borneo.  The  "con-
 frontation" was simply costing too much,
 and the Indonesian generals had no heart for
 it in view of Britian's stubbornness.
 With this agreement some current myths
 suffered a bad beating.  One of these myths
 is that the West "can't win" In Southeast
 Asia because it is white man confronting
 brown man.  The Indonesian generals didn't
 care about that, and the Malaysians, like the
 South Vietnamese, had invited the protection
 of the white man.
 Another myth is that the Westerners no
 longer can have any influence in Asia unless
 they get out.  The British stayed.
 It will not be easy for Malaysia in the
 future.  This federation already has lost one
 of  its  important  components,  Singapore.
 Nor is it necessarily true that what happened
 in the southern island reaches of Southeast
 Asia will be repeated in the northern main-
 land area adjacent to China.
 But the Malaysian experience does help to
 allay the sense of hopelessness about a West-
 ern intervention that has as its. only aim the
 prevention of expansionism in the Chinese
 and North Viet Nam Communist style.  The
 British experience shows that the line may be
 held by limited military methods, and th,.t
 what President Johnson is talking about is
 not  just  belated justification  for an ill-
 oonsidered act.
 The British experience effectively refutes
 the argument that the way to exercise power
 in Southeast Asia is to )vithdraw to the sea.
 If Britain had done that Sukarno would have
 been in North Borneo long since, and if we
 had done it in Viet Nam, Ho Chi Minh by now
 would have been in gaigon.  The way to
 contain Chinese-style expansionism obviously
 is to remain on the scene.
 Hardly any of the non-Marxist opponents
 of the Johnson Viet Nam policy oppose the
 containment of China.  Most of them con-
 sider this to be necessary.  The argument is
 over how best to do it within practical lim-
 itations.
 The settlement in Malaysia also. should
 make it easier for Britain to continue to ex-
 ercise its. power for stability in the Indian
 Ocean "east of Suez" by remaining ready to
 These questions are much to the fore now,
 both in Washington and London. The prob-
 lems involved are vital to American policy,
 for there is no desire in Washington to
 shoulder any burdens in the Indian Ocean
 area which Britain, or Britain's left wing,
 may wish to lay down.
 It would be strange if, Britain having shown
 the way in Malaysia, we were now to aban-
 don a policy proven wise.
 WARSAW PACT STUDY
 Mr. JACKSON.  Mr. President, today
 the Subcommittee on National Security
 and International Operations, which I
 have the honor to chair, released an up-
 to-date study of the role of the Warsaw
 Pact in Soviet bloc affairs.  I want to
 take this occasion to bring this study to
 the special attention of my colleagues.
 In its current inquiry into alliance
 operations and the Atlantic Alliance, our
 subcommittee though it would be, help-
 ful to look closely at the Warsaw Pact,
 communism's counterpart to NATO. The
 11-year-old Warsaw Pact is in a state
 of flux and ferment, and this timely
 study puts in perspective the dissident
 role of Rumania and the changing pol-
 itical scene of Eastern Europe.
 This subcommittee study offers evi-
 dence that the Warsaw Pact is one of
 the few remaining effective devices avail-
 able to Moscow for holding the Soviet
 bloc together at a time of growing eco-
 nomic pragmatism and more national-
 istically oriented policy stands by the
 East European regimes. The East Euro-
 pean governments, for their part, seem
 to regard the pact as surety that the
 U.S.S.R. will continue to underwrite
 their Communist regimes and safeguard
 their national boundaries.
 On the military side, as the study
 indicates,  the  pact's East European
 armed forces have been modernized and
 standardized by the Soviets since 1961,
 and "meaningful military coordination
 among the armies of the signatories has
 advanced, so that Eastern European
 armed forces are a more useful adjunct
 to Soviet military power."
 The subcommittee study offers further
 evidence, however, that the Soviet Union
 confronts some real problems with Its
 East European allies. As the study in-
 dicates, these problems include:
 Difficulty in persuading some allies to
 accept proportionate financial and other
 burdens entailed in Warsaw Pact com-
 mitments or to undertake larger pact
 commitments.
 Difficulty  in  overriding  dissenting
 members like Rumania by political pres-
 sure, since even countries willing to fol-
 low the Soviet line are reluctant to join
 in isolating more independent members
 in case they too should one day wish to
 pursue a path of their own choosing.
 Pressure by East European members
 to have a greater voice in pact decisions,
 especially as a safeguard against invol-
 untary involvement in nuclear war.
 Disagreements over current pact or-
 ganization and chain of command, and
 objections to Moscow's occupancy of all
 the major command posts under the
 pact.
 12135
 .Questions of reliability of forces of
 East European regimes under some cir-
 cumstances if called upon. to fight with
 the Soviet Union.
 I believe this timely study can con-
 tribute to greater understanding of de-
 velopments in the Soviet bloc and will
 be of special Interest to officials of the
 government and private citizens con-
 cerned with problems of the Atlantic
 GENERAL HERSHEY SUPPORTS
 STEP PROGRAM
 Mr. NELSON.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that an article pub-
 lished in the Milwaukee Journal of June
 7, containing an interview with Gen.
 Lewis Hershey, Director of the National
 Selective Service, be printed at the con-
 clusion of rely remarks.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD.
 (See exhibit 1.)
 Mr. NELSON.  Mr. President, earlier
 this week I introduced S. 3470, a bill
 which would provide special educational
 training and physical rehabilitation pro-
 grams for men not now able to qualify
 for military service.
 In the interview, General Hershey
 states:
 We ought to make some who are unfit, fit.
 We ought not to put a premium on igno-
 rance.
 I wish to commend the general for
 supporting  this  measure.  There  are
 thousands of boys wanting to join the
 service, boys who are basically qualified
 to serve, but who are now rejected due
 to minor educational defects.  It is esti-
 mated that between 11,000 anfl 15,000
 men a year would benefit by this pro-
 gram.
 These young men who want to volun-
 teer  would  make  excellent  soldiers.
 They are highly motivated and would in
 all probability remain in the service as
 career soldiers.  I am glad to know that
 the Director of the Selective Service
 agrees that something should be done
 to enable these young men to qualify for
 service.
 ARMY SHOULD DRAFT, TRAIN UNFIT, GENERAL
 HERSHEY  SAYS
 BALTIMORE,                                                                   MD.-The educational stand-
 ards for acceptance in military service "are
 too high for our long range needs," Gen.
 Lewis B. Hershey, national selective service
 director, said Monday.
 "We ought to make some who are unfit,
 fit," he said.  "We ought not to put a pre-
 mium on Ignorance."
 Hershey advocated that the military serv-
 ices accept more illiterates and educate them.
 "Do you mean the schools have failed?"
 Hershey was asked in an interview.
 "Well, we are now turning down two and
 one-half million a year because they can't
 pass a simple test," he replied.
 Hershey said in his opinion there were far
 too many exemptions from selective service.
 "How are you going to have democracy and
 fairness in a country where half of the people
 are not accepted?" he asked.
 As for whether a military draft is necessary,
 Hershey said: "I never thought we had much
 choice.  How can you survive in this world
 with your hands folded?  A human being
 has to exert himself to survive.

 high domestic price of butterfat and
 growing dairy supplies in other nations.
 Under section 206 of the Sugar Act,
 the Secretary of Agriculture has the au-
 thority to limit importation of sugar-
 containing products if the importation
 will or does substantially interfere with
 the attainment of the objectives of the
 Sugar Act.  It is, hardly necessary to
 note that one of the fundamental pur-
 poses of the Sugar Act has been to pro-
 mote within the United States the ability
 produce a substantial portion of our
 sugar requirements-for defense  and
 strategic reasons, as well as consumer
 protection.  Sugar is a vital food needed
 by American consumers, and the world
 supply of sugar has alternately been in
 very short supply or in surplus. Our
 sugar program has been intended to
 stabilize what have been very drastic
 changes in supply and demand, mostly
 in the last few years.
 However, should action not be appro-
 priate under section 206 of the Sugar
 Act, there is ample authority to proceed
 under section 22 of the Agricultural Ad-
 justment Act.  That section provides
 that when the Secretary of Agriculture
 has reason to believe that any article im-
 ported into the United States will render
 or tend to render ineffective, or mate-
 rially interfere with price support pro-
 grams, he may recommend to thePresi-
 dent that the U.S. Tariff Commission
 proceed to determine the existence of
 facts establishing the interference.
 Interestingly enough, action has al-
 ready been taken under this section. On
 April 15, 1957, President Eisenhower
 placed limitations, by Executive order,
 on the importation of butter substitutes,
 including butter oil, containing 45 per-
 cent or more of butterfat. This restric-
 tion would apply today to the butterfat-
 sugar product imports, except that the
 importers are careful to limit the amount,
 of butterfat to 44 percent or less, thus
 escaping the quota.  President Kennedy
 exercised this authority with respect to
 certain cotton products in September of
 1961.
 This situation is serious for Minnesota,
 since in both 1964 and 1965, Minnesota
 has led the Nation in the production of
 creamery butter, and has ranked among
 the three leading States in production of
 all milkfat.
 Our dairy industry accounts for 22 to
 23 percent of total cash receipts from
 farm marketings-about $340 million an-
 nually. It is possible that our dairy in-
 dustry, now suffering from an unusual
 decline, could be further crippled if the
 rate of increase in imports of butterfat-
 sugar products continues.
 I intend to follow this situation closely,
 and cooperate closely with the Depart-
 ment of Agriculture in making the quick-
 est possible assessment of the situation
 and in taking action if intensive investi-
 gation warrants placing some restric-
 tions on these imports.
 INCREASE IN IMPORTS OF BUTTER-
 .:  PAT-SUGAR PRODUCTS
 Mr. MONDALE.  Mr. President, in the
 past several months there has been an
 alarmingly rapid increase in imports of
 butterfat-sugar products, containing 44
 percent butterfat, 55 to56 percent sugar,
 and possibly a trace of vanilla.  This sit-
 uation is hinted at in the May 1966 dairy
 situation report Issued by the Depart-
 ment of Agriculture.  But more recent
 information indicates that the situation
 is becoming serious.
 Such mixtures, known under a variety
 of trade names such as Junex, Lorex,
 Ernex, and Grapex, have been imported
 for many years.  More recently, 2.5 mil-
 lion pounds were imported in 1961, and
 4.1 mullion pounds in 1962.  But the
 levels have never been higher than that.
 There were no imports at all of this
 product during the 1963-64 or 1964-65
 Import years.  But from July,  1965,
 through February of this year, 6 million
 pounds were imported.  Since February
 the rate of increase has been sharp and
 rapid--3.1 million pounds were imported
 in March of 1966; 8.1 million pounds in
 April; and 19.5 million pounds in May.
 All told, through May of this year, im-
 ports of butterfat-sugar product has
 totaled roughly 36.6 million pounds.  It
 is my understanding that in the first
 week of June about 1 million pounds
 came into the United States.
 These imports constitute direct and
 serious  competition  with      domestic
 sources of sugar and butterfat, and may
 be handled under existing law. If these
 imports are damaging the effectiveness
 of our price support programs for manu-
 facturing milk and butterfat, or the at-
 tainment of the objectives of the Sugar
 Act, machinery exists to do something
 about it.
 I have asked the Department of Ag-
 riculture today to intensify their ex-
 amination and assessment of the situa-
 tion with respect to these imports, in
 cooperation with other agencies that may
 be concerned.  The Department of Ag-
 riculture is aware of the growing rate of
 imports.  But I believe the situation Is
 serious enough to justify full-scale re-
 view, together with beginning such ac-
 tion as may be warranted.
 Since August of 1951, the United States
 has imposed import quotas on certain.
 dairy commodities in order to protect
 the domestic price support programs for
 manufacturing milk and butterfat from
 excessive Import interference. Among
 the specific dairy products subject to
 import limitations under section 22 of
 the Agricultural Adjustment Act are but-
 ter, dry, milk, and Cheddar cheese.
 In recent months, imports in products
 outside quota restrictions have been in-
 creasing.  Among these ex-quota prod-
 ucts are fresh-frozen cream, Colby cheese,
 and the "junextype" products contain-
 Ing less than 45 percent butterfat.  Be-
 ginning in 1962, agreements between the
 United States and leading dairy export
 nations had limited trade in such com-
 modities, but all of thes agreements ex-
 pired on June 30, 1965.
 A number of complex and interrelated
 factors are causing these increases in
 butterfat-sugar product, principally the
 THE WAR ON POVERTY
 Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, it is
 difficult for me to understand why some
 of our colleagues manifest such a criti-
 cal attitude toward the newly launched
 war on poverty.  From recent charges,
 one would conclude that this is the most
 ill conceived program ever enacted for
 our  citizens.   Furthermore,  Sargent
 Shriver, the distinguished former Direc-
 tor of the Peace Corps and now the Direc-
 tor of the war on poverty, has been
 subjected to unfair personal attacks.
 In my opinion, and I am certain others
 in this body share similar views, Mr.
 Shriver is one of the most distinguished,
 dedicated, and inspired public servants
 ever to serve the U.S. Government.
 Let us be fair in our evaluation of the
 war on poverty and recognize that it
 has been in existence less than 2 years.
 And, second, let us be fair in giving cog-
 nizance to several of its major accom-
 plishments in this limited period of time.
 It is remarkable that the Office of
 Economic Opportunity has approved over
 3,850 grants to community action agen-
 cies covering over a third of all the
 counties in the United States; involved
 over 775,000 preschool children in Proj-
 ect Headstart, with an additional half
 million children scheduled to participate
 this summer; provided basic education
 and job training to 44,000 young men
 and women through the Job Corps;
 gained the participation of over 550,000
 teenagers in the Neighborhood Youth
 Corps; selected, trained, and assigned
 over 2,100 VISTA volunteers to 278
 rural and urban projects; benefited more
 than 120,000 unemployed adults through
 the work experience program; and has
 established other antipoverty measures,
 including adult basic education, rural
 loans and small business development
 loan programs, for groups chronically
 affected by the ravages of poverty.
 Mr. President, instead of decrying
 every  imaginary  or  legitimate  short-
 coming of this growing and dynamic
 program, I suggest that we should com-
 mend the Office of Economic Opportu-
 nity for the establishment of exciting,
 innovative  concepts  and      programs-
 known to millions of Americans as Project
 Upward Bound, the legal services pro-
 gram,  foster  grandparents,                                                                                                     medicare
 alert, and others-which have already
 produced gratifying results. The Head-
 start program has proved so popular that
 demand for local projects far exceeds
 available funds. Also significant are the
 special programs extended to long-for-
 gotten groups such as migratory agri-
 cultural workers and American Indians
 which will enable them to join the main-
 stream of American life.
 Admittedly, there have been prob-
 lems, controversies, and occasional fail-
 ures.  But who could expect otherwise
 from the daring, new approaches to over-
 come the root causes of poverty in this
 Nation. Is it possible to embark upon
 such an approach, which permeates all
 levels of government and affects hereto-
 fore forgotten groups, many of whom are
 in the midst of great social unrest, with-
 out some difficulties arising?  And is it
 possible to imagine a meaningful war
 on poverty, 18 months after its inception,
 being easy and comfortable and unani-
 mously popular?  Poverty has afflicted.
 some portions of our society for genera-
 tions.  It is not likely to disappear in a
 single generation. But let us beware: of

 A particularly perceptive series has been
 written by Charles W. Bailey, corre-

 and the Des Moines Register.
 As Bailey points out, the objective of
 this program is to fight against rapid
 inflation in Vietnam, which can threaten
 stability, particularly in the cities, in a
 very serious way. Our increased involve-
 ment in Vietnam has inevitably gener-
 ated unprecedented demands on the
 economy there, and by shipping a large
 number of goods there for commercial
 sale we hope to soak up excess buying
 power and keep prices down.
 As one might expect in a program of
 this magnitude, there have been very
 serious problems.  Chuck Bailey's anal-
 ysis of these problems is worthy of the
 attention of the entire Senate, so I ask
 unanimous consent that several of his
 articles be printed at this point in the
 RECORD.

 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,

 CZAR WILL PROBE PX BLACK MARKET IN SOUTH
 VIETNAM
 (By Charles W. Bailey, Minneapolis Tribune
 Staff Correspondent)
 WASHINGTON,           D.C.-The Defense Depart-
 ment,  increasingly  concerned  over  wide-
 spread black marketeering of military Post
 Exchange goods sent to South Viet Nam,
 has named a "czar" to investigate and where
 necessary clean up the situation.
 Thomas D. Morris, assistant secretary of
 defense, has been named "Mr. Black Mar-
 keteer"-in the words of a Pentagon spokes-
 man Friday-in an effort to clamp down on a
 problem that could cause the administra-
 tion considerable embarrassment.
 The thriving black market in PX goods is
 the most highly visible, though probably not
 the most serious, symptoms of the theft, di-
 version  and  lack  of  control  which  have
 plagued United States military and foreign
 aid shipments to Viet Nam.
 Diversion and theft of United States aid
 shipments,  including goods  purchased by
 Vietnamese businessmen with United States
 financing under the so-called Commodity
 Import Program (CIP), is under intensive in-
 vestigation by civilian authorities, who have
 dispatched several dozen investigators to Sai-_
 gon, South Viet Nam, in recent weeks.
 Ironically,  the  Defense Department  ap-
 pointment of its own black market "czar"
 follows by less than three months the nam-
 ing of a similar official by the South Viet-
 namese  government  at  the  insistence                                                                                                                                      of
 President Johnson and other top U.S. lead-
 ers during the Honolulu conference.
 It has been no secret in Saigon that the
 influx of PX supplies for U.S. troops has fed
 a thriving black market.  Sidewalk vendors
 there offer radios, liquor, canned food, cig-
 arettes, clothing, bedsheets and other items-
 many bearing Post Exchange price tags-
 for sale in hundreds of open-air booths.
 The PX black market drew fire this week
 from Senator J. WILLIAM FULBRIGHT, Demo-
 crat, of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate
 Foreign Relations Committee and a persist-
 ent critic of the war in Viet Nam.
 FULBRIGHT said that "30,000 containers of
 hair spray were sent to Viet Nam in March...
 it seems reasonable to suppose that this item
 has found its way to the black market."
 Anyone walking down  Saigon sidewalks
 can confirm that hair spray is a popular item

 In the open-air black market.  But FaL-
 BRIGHT, according to highly knowledgeable
 official sources, seriously understated the
 magnitude of the shipments.
 Shipments of hair spray to South Viet
 Nam--destined for PX counters but often
 diverted to sidewalk stalls-have been run-
 ning at a level of more than 140,000 contain-
 ers a month for the past four or five months,
 these sources say.
 There are fewer than 800 women in all of
 South Viet Nam authorized to purchase
 goods in U.S. Post Exchanges, the sources
 say-nurses, dependents of non-government
 U.S. personnel with PX privileges, and a
 ,handful of Vietnamese dependents of mill..
 . ary men:
 Thus the monthly consignments of hair
 spray would provide close to 200 cans of
 hair spray per month for each woman author.
 ized to obtain it.  The fact is that hair spray
 is a standard gift for GIs to give to their
 Vietnamese girl friends.
 A Defense Department spokesman con-
 firmed yesterday that Morris had been given
 the  black  market  "czar"  assignment  by
 Deputy Defense Secretary Cyrus Vance.  The
 spokesman said that Vance acted after re-
 ceiving "some reports" on the situation fol-
 lowing his recent inspection trip to Vietnam.
 The spokesman said Vance also has ordered
 each service secretary-Army, Navy and Air
 Force-to give him a monthly report on ac-
 tions taken by them to curb black marketeer-
 Ing, currency dealings,  and similar illegal
 activities.
 Morris, who is assistant secretary of de-
 fense for manpower, was chosen by Vance
 because his responsibilities cut across Inter-
 service lines, the spokesman said.

 TEAM SEEKS To END VIET MISUSE
 (By Charles Bailey, of the Register's
 Washington bureau)
 WASHINGTON, D.C.-Foreign aid officials,
 spurred by evidence of major misuse of Amer-
 ican aid to South Viet Nam, are hastily in-
 creasing their efforts to control the nearly
 $500 million worth of U.S.-financed goods
 shipped each year to Saigon.
 An entire new 27-man "special projects
 team" has been set up in the U.S. aid mission
 headquarters in Saigon, along with extra
 auditors and inspectors, In an effort to pre-
 vent further diversion of aid shipments by
 profiteering merchants or agents of the Com-
 munist Viet Cong.
 The stepped-up policing efforts of the
 Agency   for   International   Development
 (AID), which handles economic assistance
 programs, parallel the action of the Defense
 Department, which has appointed a "czar" to
 crack down on black marketing in military
 post exchange goods and currency.        -
 The military  and  civilian  enforcement
 drive apparently resulted, at least in part,
 from investigations conducted  In  recent
 weeks by the Inspector-General's office of the
 State Department.  This office has formal
 policing authority only over the AID pro-
 grams, but in addition has pointed up black
 marketeering activities in military PX sup-
 plies as well.
 It was the curiosity of an official in the
 Inspector-General's  office  that resulted in
 the interception of 50 tons of a highly-explo-
 sive chemical compound bound for Saigon.
 The compound had been purchased by a
 Vietnamese importer-Purportedly for use in
 making rubber-soled tennis shoes-under a
 program financed by AID.
 COMPLICATED NAME
 The inspector's curiosity as to the appar-
 ent huge demand for- tennis shoes, plus the
 complicated            chemical  name  of  the  com-
 pound, led to his initial inquiry, subsequent
 tests  by the Naval Ordnance Laboratory
 showed the compound-trade-named "Uni-
 cel-100" and known chemically as "dinitroso-
 pentamethalene tetramine"-to be almost as
 powerful as TNT.
 A similar, though less lethal, item recently
 turned back from its Saigon destination was
 its Saigon destination was $1-million-worth
 of silver nitrate.   It was questioned, and
 then canceled, because it seemed likely to
 have been purchased as a "money maker"-
 a nonessential import designed solely for the
 enrichment of the importer.
 Silver nitrate can be melted down-"in
 the back of any shack," as one official put it-
 Because the financing arrangements under
 the U.S.-backed Commodity Import Program
 (CIP) allow a Vietnamese importer to buy
 goods at an exchange of 60 piastres to the
 dollar, instead of the going black-market rate
 of 180 to 200 piastres per dollar now prevalent
 in Saigon, the potential for profit in such a
 manipulation is large.
 Even If half the silver nitrate is lost in the
 conversion process, the importer would be
 left with a tidy profit when he sold his solid
 silver, in the form of ashtrays or -spoons, on
 the Saigon market.
 In addition, conversion of the unstable
 piastre into something as "hard" and thus
 stable as silver, particularly at a low pegged
 piastre price, gives ,a Vietnamese a chance
 to  enrich  himself  in  real,  inflation-proof
 terms.
 TARGET O    DEMANDS
 According to an AID spokesman, the agency
 has been the target in the last few days of
 demands from both Congress and the White
 House for details of past losses and future
 control plans.       The White House inquiries,
 the spokesman said, had become especially
 insistent, and he added: "There seems to be
 a real flap over this."
 As for    Congress, a House subcommittee
 headed by Representative JOHN Moss, Demo-
 crat of California, arrived in Saigon last week-
 end to look into the diversion problem.  It
 carries a special agreement giving it authority
 to probe military as well as AID programs.
 The AID agency Monday was unable to pro-
 vide specific information on the new tougher
 program of "end-use" auditing-that Is, the
 checking of goods sent to Viet Nam under
 the CIP program to determine whether they
 have been used for the purposes stated in the
 import application.
 But an AID spokesman did provide this
 run-down on the new control measures being
 instituted:
 A "special projects team," consisting of 20
 AID officials and seven experts from the U.S.
 Bureau of Customs, has been set up in Sai-
 gon to see what happens to shipments after
 they arrive.  This team will be strengthened
 by another 10 men within two months.
 Two additional "management inspectors"-
 empowered to call for records on any trans-
 action-have been assigned to Saigon to join
 the two already there.
 Five additional staff auditors have been
 assigned to the Saigon AID Mission to join
 the 13 already there, and another 17 auditors
 are to be added "as soon as possible."
 The AID spokesman added that one or the
 other of the two top officials of the Inspector-
 General's office-Director Kenneth Mansfield
 and his deputy, Howard E. Haugerud-has
 been in Saigon "most of the time" In recent
 weeks, investigating the situation.
 Since there are about 375 employees in the
 U.S. AID Mission In Saigon, the current 47-
 man complement of inspectors, investigators
 and auditors amounts to about one person in
 eight in the mission.  When the additional
 policing personnel now planned arrive, the
 proportion will be nearly one in five-a meas-
 ure of the gravity with which the problem
 is now viewed.

 FEAR REDS GOT U.S. EXPLOSIVE   SEE POSSIBLE
 USE  BY  VIET  TERRORISTS-CHEMICAL  WAS
 SENT TO PRIVATE FIRMS
 (By Charles Bailey, of the Register's
 Washington bureau)
 WASHINGTON, D.C.-At least -100 tons of a
 highly explosive chemical colifpound were
 delivered to private merchants in South Viet
 Nam under U.S. aid programs before suspi-
 cious investigators discovered its potential
 value to Communist terrorists.
 The agency for International Development,
 (AID), which administers the economic as-
 sistance program under which the chemical
 was shipped, is now trying to find out
 whether  the compound-purportedly  im-
 ported to Saigon for use' 1n making rubber-
 soled tennis shoes-was diverted to the Viet
 Gong.  It is suspected that it was.
 AUDIT ORDERED
 An "end-use" audit has been ordered on
 the 100 tons of Unicel-100 and Unicel-DN-
 two variants of the same compound.  They
 were shipped before State Department in-
 spectors learned of the compound's explosive
 properties last month.
 In addition to the 100 tons, an AID spokes-
 man said Friday that undetermined addi-
 tional amounts were purchased by Vietnam-
 ese merchants, with  U.S.  financing,  from
 manufacturers In Japan and Formosa.
 Tests of Unicel-100, made after an official
 of the State Department Inspector-General's
 Office questioned a 50-ton shipment, revealed
 the compound to be nearly as powerful an
 explosive as T.N.T.  A single pound, packed
 into a bicycle hand-pump and simply fused,
 could wreck a building, officials said.
 (The most recent terrorist blast in Saigon
 reportedly was caused by a bomb attached to
 a bicycle.)
 The 50-ton shipment of Unicel was stopped
 in mid-ocean.  But the 100 tons shipped un-
 der earlier authorizations already had arrived
 In Saigon and had been picked up by the
 merchants who bought it under the AILS
 Commodity Import Program, which finances
 purchases-at a favorable rate of exchange-
 by Vietnamese businessmen.
 The  program  subsidizes  the  Import  of
 goods, with the aim of providing materials
 needed to strengthen the economy of South
 Viet Nam without feeding the Inflation that
 recently has become a major problem there.
 But recent investigations, such as the one
 that turned up shipments of Unicel so large
 they obviously were not for the stated pur-
 pose of making tennis shoe soles more flex-
 ible and springy, have indicated widespread
 misuse and diversion of U.S.-financed goods.
 Such misuse involves not only diversion of
 goods to the Communists-as suspected in
 the case of the Unicel and such other ma-
 terials as drugs, steel and cement-but also
 its conversion in "Money-making" projects--
 such as the melting down of silver nitrate
 into pure silver for hoarding or resale.
 AID spokesmen said Friday that the list
 of specific "end-use" audits ordered in the
 current crackdown is classified because the
 agency does not want It known which items
 are being checked.  But they said that both
 Unicel and silver nitrate are among the com-
 modities being checked.
 A spokesman said he was "sure" that no
 more Unicel would be authorized for ship-
 ment to South Viet Nam regardless of the
 audit findings.  As for silver nitrate, he sug-
 gested that the current stop order would be
 'maintained    until  investigations  are  corn-
 plete.
 The discovery of such incidents as the
 Unicel shipment, plus increasing congres-
 sional  concern over the operation of the
 Commodity Import Program, have resulted
 in a drastic step-up in auditing and policing
 procedures.
 But the task of checking the $420 million
 in goods shipped under the program in the

 last two years, and of preventing misuse of
 the equal amount programmed for the next
 12 months, will keep auditors busy for weeks
 or even months, officials say.
 Special emphasis will be put on checks of
 so-called "critical" goods-materials which
 would be of special use to the Communists.
 In addition to drugs-especially antibiotics-
 this list includes chemicals, small hand tools
 and such machine tools as lathes which can
 be used in making arms.
 Of the $370 million in goods being shipped
 this year under the Commodity Import Pro-
 gram, almost $71 million is industrial ma-
 chinery  and  equipment.   Chemicals  and
 pharmaceuticals account for another $43
 million. Iron and steer products shipped
 this year are valued at $72 million, while
 motor vehicles and parts are listed at $18
 million.

 INFLATION  COULD WIPE  OUT  ALL  GAINS IN
 VIETNAM
 .(By Charles W, Bailey, Minneapolis Tribune
 staff correspondent
 WASHINGTON, D.C.-Behind the furore over
 black marketeering, currency manipulation
 and diversion of United States financed aid
 in Viet Nam lies one central concern: The
 fear that rampant inflation could wipe out
 every bit of dearly-bought economic and
 political progress in that shaky nation.
 Inflation 1s traditionally  a problem for
 developing nations, where each economic ad-
 vance may trigger a rise in demand that out-
 strips the capacity to meet it.  It is doubly
 troublesome In Viet Nam because of the huge
 impact of American military and war-con-
 nected spending there.
 The piastre, South Viet Nam's currency
 unit, has so weakened in recent months that
 it is now valued on 'the free market in Sai-
 gon at more than 180 to the dollar-com-
 pared to official exchange rates ranging down
 to 60 to the dollar for some American-
 financed official transactions.
 The big United States build-up has made
 an already bad situation worse.  American
 contractors pay wages to construction work-
 ers well above local scales.  American mili-
 tary personnel,  diplomats,    correspondents
 and others bid up the scale of rents in
 Saigon.
 Hundreds of thousands of dollars in United
 States military pay is dumped each month
 into the economy, sending consumer goods
 prices  sky-high  for  already  hard-pressed
 Vietnamese.
 Not all the inflation can be traced to
 United States spending.    The build-up of
 Vietnamese armed forces required bigger gov-
 ernment outlays-without comparable reve-
 nue increases.
 Transportation and communications were
 out back by the war, thus hindering produc-
 tion at the very time when more was needed.
 A manpower shortage brought repeated wage
 increases as employers bid for scarce help.
 With the piastre thus reeling under the
 impact of American spending, it is not hard
 to see why some Vietnamese businessmen
 find it attractive to manipulate United States
 aid programs.
 A merchant who can buy a dollar's worth
 of silver nitrate for a "pegged" price of 6
 piastres, melt it down and sell the resulting
 silver for upwards of 200 piastres has an
 automatic profit, even after the shrinkage
 Involved in processing.
 And if he chooses to hold onto the silver,
 he has an inflation-proof asset which can
 be sold for hard currency at any time-
 whether in Saigon or in some other country
 to which he has taken his silver in the form
 of spoons or bullion.
 The political effects of inflation can also
 be disastrous.  Saigon's middle class popu-
 lation-the civil servants, teachers and pro-
 fessionals who must be counted on to play
 No. 95-6
 a major role In any real national govern-
 ment-is progressively impoverished by In-
 flation.
 Their fixed salaries are worth less each
 month.  They must not only compete for
 decent living space with the Americans but
 must pay more and more for it as prices go
 up.  The cost of food, clothing, fuel, trans-
 portation-of everything-goes up.
 The best simple measure of the impact of
 inflation is one statistic:'In 1965, after some
 years of relative stability, consumer prices
 rose about 40 per cent in one year.  And in
 some remote areas and refugee-crowded cen-
 ters, prices doubled during the year.
 Fighting this inflation has a high priority
 in the Johnson administration's over-all eco-
 nomic aid program for Viet Nam.  The United
 States is financing $370 million worth of
 commodity imports this year and will pay
 for another $420 million worth in the coming
 fiscal year.
 But some officials here believe that even
 these massive efforts are not enough.  "I
 spent time in China after World War II," one
 expert said, "and I watched inflation wreck
 that country's economy.  I'm afraid the same
 thing could happen in Viet Nam, and wash
 out everything we've done or hope to do."
 This official,  and some others like him,
 believe the ambitious plans for social and
 economic development which grew out of
 the Honolulu conference, while certainly de-
 sirable, may not be necessary as immediate
 objectives-at last not imperative in com-
 parison with the greater need to choke- off
 inflation.
 The attempt to produce the "social revo-
 lution" proclaimed at Hawaii, some officials
 suggest, is like "trying to attach a garden
 hose to a fire hydrant" because Saigon's re-
 sources of time, energy and export manpower
 are so limited that it cannot fight a war,
 curb inflation and also carry out the added
 new tasks.
 It is certain that the inflation problem is
 at the heart of many of this week's meet-
 ings between Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge
 and his Washington superiors.  It is also at
 the root of the stepped-up effort to control
 the ultimate use of the millions of dollars
 worth of U.S. goods being sent to Saigon.

 VIETCONG GETS SOME MATERIAL-U.S. BOOSTS
 GUARD OVER AID Goons
 (By Charles W. Bailey, Minneapolis Tribune
 staff correspondent)
 WASHINGTON, D.C.-The head of the United
 States foreign aid program conceded Thurs-
 day that controls  over shipments to Viet
 Nam have been "inadequate" and that some
 supplies have wound up in the hands of the
 Communist Viet Cong.
 David Bell, administrator of the Agency
 for International Development (AID), said in
 an interview that the administration has
 "added greatly" to the number of officials in
 Saigon charged with overseeing the AID pro-
 gram and will "more than double" existing
 watchdog personnel.
 As a result of newly revealed evidence of
 major misuse. of United States-financed goods
 sent to South Viet Nam, an entire new 27-
 man "special projects team" has been set up
 in Saigon.  Another 25 or more Inspectors
 and auditors are to be added to this force
 soon, AID spokesmen said.
 The stepped-up policing  of AID ship-
 ments-sent to Saigon under a commodity
 import program now running at a $420 mil-
 lion annual level-parallels action by the
 Defense  Department,  which recently  ap-
 pointed a "czar" to crack down on black
 marketeering in post exchange goods and
 currency.
 The degree of the military crackdown re-
 mained unclear yesterday  despite Defense
 Department statements that 41 servicemen
 and 70 civilians have been punished or in-
 12145
 vestigated for black marketing. -
 A defense spokesman said that the totals
 cover an 18-month period, and he said that
 the civilian cases "remain under investiga-
 tion" with no punitive action taken so far.
 Bell's comments in a television interview
 gave only a partial picture of the step-up in
 AID  policing  activity.  He  said  that  18
 Americans are working "full-time" to oversee
 the program in Saigon, and that this number
 will be more than doubled.
 Bell thus appeared to be referring only to
 auditors, who are primarily engaged in fol-
 lowing through on delivery records to deter-
 mine what happened to goods sent to Saigon
 under a program in which the U.S. govern-
 ment finances imports by changing Viet-
 namese piastres into U.S. dollars at a pegged
 rate of 60 to 1, far below the free-market
 exchange rate of 180 to 1.
 Actually,  the  auditors-many  of  them
 newly assigned to Saigon-are only part of
 the check-up team sent there since recent
 investigations by State Department inspec-
 tors focused attention on abuses.
 In addition, the 27-man "special projects
 team," Including seven experts from the U.S.
 Bureau of Customs, has been put to work on
 the problem, and two additional "manage-
 ment inspectors" with broad investigatory
 power have been assigned to the Saigon AID
 mission.
 AID spokesmen say that another 10 men
 are to be added to the "special projects"
 group within two months, while at least 17
 more auditors are scheduled to be dispatched
 to Saigon as soon as they can be recruited.
 Bell explained the possibility of diversion
 of United States-financed goods to the Com-
 munists in this way:
 "When the goods have been delivered to
 the businessman to whom they were sup-
 posed to go open and aboveboard_ then they
 are available in the markets, in the shops, in
 the stores in Saigon and other parts of Viet
 Nam.
 "Then they may be purchased by someone
 who is really acting for the Viet Cong and
 they may be smuggled through the lines, so
 to speak-as you know, there isn't any front
 line in Viet Nam-out to the Viet Cong in
 their jungle bases."
 Bell  conceded  that  "to  some  extent"
 charges that United States-financed concrete
 was being used by the Viet Cong to build
 tunnels in its jungle redoubts were true.
 Cement, he said, could be purchased in
 Saigon by a Viet Cong agent and smuggled
 into the jungle.  "We haven't adequate data
 to answer the question of how much of this
 there is," he said.
 To  counter  this  diversion,  Bell  said,  a
 "major police     program,"  including   road
 blocks, control points on waterways and other
 checkpoints is being developed.

 How U.S. AID FOR VIET GOES TO RED TAXES-
 REVEAL HEAVY Loss or GooDs
 (By Charles Bailey, of the Register's
 Washington bureau)
 WASHINGTON, D.C.-State Department in-
 vestigators have unooverd substantial losses
 of U.S. foreign aid goods being shipped to
 out-lying points in Viet Nam-apparently
 through outright theft by haulers or in the
 form of taxes exacted by the Communist
 Viet Cong.
 The losses-which include cement, alumi-
 num sheet roofing and food-ranged from
 16 to 42 per cent of shipments leaving cen-
 tral depots  in  Saigon,  according to  spot
 checks made  in seven South Vietnamese
 provinces.
 This latest disclosure of trouble in mas-
 sive American aid to Viet Nam came in an

 CHECKS BY U.S.
 While previous revelations have pointed up

 ment-operated aid efforts as well.
 . More than a year ago, the inspector gen-
 eral's office--charged with overseeing all U.S.
 aid programs-ran checks on commodities
 being shipped from Saigon to provincial
 towns under the so-called counter-insur-
 gency program.
 Rusk reported to the Senate committee
 that the probers "developed figures showing
 apparent significant discrepancies between
 the amounts of commodities leaving Saigon
 and the amounts arriving in the provinces."
 Specific figures, not included In Rusk's
 report, tell the story more vividly.
 Investigators checked records to find out
 how  much  cement,  aluminum  sheeting,
 wheat and vegetable oil were shipped In one
 year from central warehouses in Saigon to
 An Xuyen Province, in the .Mekong Delta
 near the Cambodian border.
 REVEAL LOSSES
 They then checked provincial records in
 An Xuyen to find out how much was de-
 livered, allowing for truck and barge ship-
 ments known to have been captured outright
 by the Communist Viet Cong between the
 national and provincial capitals.
 The results of the check showed these
 figures:
 Of 9,000 bags of cement shipped and not
 seized by the Viet Cong outright, only 7,367
 bags reached the provincial warehouse-a
 loss of 1,633 bags, or 18.1 per cent.
 Of 26,793 gallons of vegetable oil shipped
 from Saigon, only 15,446 gallons were checked
 into the provincial warehouse-a loss of
 11,347 gallons, or 42.3 per cent, with a value
 of $24,800.
 Of 8,020 bags of wheat that left Saigon,
 only 0,363 reached the An Xuyen warehouse-
 a loss of 1,657 bags, or 20.7 per cent, with a
 value of $18,740.
 Of 7,938 sheets of aluminum roofing ma-
 terial shipped from Saigon, only 6,843 ar-
 rived in the province-a loss of 1,445 sheets,
 or 18.2 per cent.
 Officials said that similar spot-checks in six
 other provinces yielded comparable statistics.
 There are 43 provinces in South Viet Nam, so
 the total loss through this kind of diversion
 was obviously substantial.
 Those familiar with the investigation said
 Monday that two factors undoubtedly ac-
 counted for most of the losses between Saigon
 and the provinces-either outright theft or
 taxes by the Viet Cong as the price of allow-
 ing the transporters to proceed in safety.

 BID  To  BUILD  VIET  BREWERY  WITH  U.S.
 An)-BUT OFFICIAL BLOCKED $4-MILLION
 PLANT
 (By Charles Bailey, of the Register's Wash-
 ington bureau)
 WASHINGTON, D.C.-U.S. officials in Saigon
 sought to finance the operations of a private
 Vietnamese  brewery  with  $4  million  in
 American funds under a foreign aid program
 intended to provide only "essential" goods,
 official reports revealed Tuesday.
 The proposed transaction" was stopped by
 the State Department's inspector general,
 who refused to allow the use of U.B. dollars
 for importing malt and hops to be used In
 making beer.
 Details of the case, obtained by The Des
 Moines Register Tuesday, provide new ex-
 amples of the confusion and lack of con-
 trols which have plagued U.S. aid efforts in
 Viet Nam.
 The malt-hops case also illustrates an-
 other problem plaguing U.S. foreign aid
 programs--the difficulty of persuading Amer-
 ican aid officials to seek ways of utilizing
 the huge and still-growing amounts of local
 currencies piled up in various nations as
 payment for American food shipments.
 The Vietnamese malt-hops issue arose in
 1965 when officials in the U.S. aid mission
 in Saigon asked Washington for a waiver of
 rules limiting the outlay of aid funds under
 the so-called Commodity Import Program
 (CIP) to "essential" goods.
 ARTIFICIALLY LOW
 [Under the CIP, private Vietnamese busi-
 nessmen receive goods purchased here with
 government dollars.                     They pay for the goods
 with Vietnamese piastres, at an artificially
 low rate of exchange.
 [The piastres are then used in Viet Nam
 on joint U.S.-Vietnamese government proj-
 ects, so the cost of the goods shipped under
 CIP is fully borne by U. S..public funds.]
 The inspector general's office, in the State
 Department-charged with checking the op-
 eration of all overseas U.S. assistance pro-
 grams--questioned the waiver application on
 several grounds.
 First, it saw no reason to waive the essen-
 tial-goods-only rule for a project involving
 the production of beer.
 Second, it found the proposal objection-
 able on the ground that malt and hops were
 commodities which have to be imported into
 the U. S. to meet the full needs of brewers
 here.  Thus the transaction would have fur-
 ther increased net Import requirements in
 the United States and would thus tend to
 worsen our balance-of-payments problem.
 FIVE-MILLION-DOLLAR CREDIT
 Third, the inspector general pointed out
 that South Vietnamese officials already had
 available a $5 million credit from West Ger-
 many, an exporter of the desired goods, but
 had not drawn on that credit.
 Fourth, the inspector general pointed out
 that the United States owned about $250
 million worth of Yugoslavian currency, as
 a result of Food-for-Peace sales to that na-
 tion, and that this might be used to pur-
 chase the malt and hops, since Yugoslavia
 is an exporter of the commodities.
 Official sources here said Tuesday that the
 inspector general sought to persuade aid of-
 ficials in Washington to explore these alter-
 nate methods of financing, but that the aid
 officials refused and continued to press for a
 waiver that would permit use of U.S. dollars
 under CIP.
 But the inspector general again refused
 the waiver, and this time provided the re-
 quired written notice to the secretary of
 state which made the refusal final.
 The upshot, informed sources said, was
 that .the Vietnamese financed the malt-hops
 imports out of their own foreign exchange
 resources rather than using U.S. aid funds
 to pay for them.
 According. to  official sources  here,  the
 case-despite the action of the inspector
 general in preventing a $4 million U.S. out-
 lay to pay for beer production-points up
 several problems.
 INDIANA'S SECOND NATIONAL ME-
 MORIAL-GEORGE ROGERS CLARK
 AT VINCENNES
 Mr. HARTKE.  Mr. President, I would
 like to call attention to my bill, S. 2886,
 the George Rogers Clark Memorial bill,
 upon which the Senate Interior Commit-
 tee has concluded hearings.  June 7 the
 House unanimously passed H.R. 9599, the
 companion bill introduced by my own
 Congressman WINFIELD K. DENTON, Dem-
 ocrat, Eighth District, Indiana.
 I ask unanimous consent to include my
 testimony on S. 2886 in the RECORD.
 . There being no objection, the state-
 ment was ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 STATEMENT  OF  SENATOR  VANCE  HARTKE  ON
 S. 2886, GEORGE ROGERS CLARK MEMORIAL,
 SENATE INTERIOR COMMITTEE, JUNE 8, 1966
 Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to ap-
 pear before your Committee.                                                                                                  I want to ex-
 press my appreciation for your willingness to
 act so swiftly for the creation of Indiana's
 second National Memorial.
 We Hoosiers have great pride in our his-
 torical heritage which Includes the names
 of George Rogers Clark, William Henry Har-
 rison and Abraham Lincoln, as well as many
 others.
 S. 2886 authorizes the Secretary of the
 Interior to accept from the State of Indiana
 the George Rogers Clark Memorial at the
 historic site on the Wabash River, now the
 city of Vincennes, and enter into cooperative
 agreements with the owners of other histor-
 ical buildings,
 One of these properties is the two-room
 frame building which served as the first
 capitol of the Indiana Territory and as the
 seat of the territorial court from 1800-1.813
 where many decisions on land policy, Indian
 'relations and military affairs were deter-
 mined.
 Another of the properties is the Francis
 Xavier Catholic Church.  The present build-
 ing dates from 1824-1834 and is the same
 tract of ground on which, in 1749 was erected
 the first rough log cabin church to serve
 the  French  and  Spanish  settlers  when
 Vincennes was the western outpost of our
 country. At that time, this western outpost
 was Fort Sackville, a British Fort until 1779
 when Lt. Colonel George Rogers Clarke cap-
 tured and renamed it Fort Patrick Henry.
 Grouseland, the home of William Henry
 Harrison, Is the third property which we
 had hoped to include.  It is owned by the
 Daughters ofthe American Revolution, who,
 I am- informed, do not wish it to be part of
 the National Memorial. However, they have
 assured the House Committee by telegram
 that the building will remain open to the
 public and that the D.A.R. will continue to
 maintain it.  I would like for their telegram
 to become part of this record.
 I urge that the Committee favorably con-
 sider S. 2886 so that the area of Vincennes,
 which is so beautifully depicted by Maurice
 Thompson's novel, Alice of Old Vincennes,
 can be elevated as it should be, to national
 recognition.  I appreciate the overwhelming
 passage by the House of Representatives of
 the George Rogers Clark Memorial bill, and
 congratulate my own Congressman, WINFIELD
 K. DENTON, for his fine work in guiding the
 measure through the House.
 I would like to say a few more words about
 Vincennes, in Knox County, Indiana.
 The George Rogers Clark Memorial is a
 domed structure supported by 17 Doric col-
 umns.  It contains a bronze statute of Clark
 and murals depicting his career and the his-
 tory of the old Northwest Territory.  This
 Memorial was first dedicated by President
 Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1936.
 It was at Vincennes that the Lincoln fam-
 ily, with young Abe, crossed over the Wa-
 bash River Into Illinois.  Vincennes is the
 point at which the proposed Lincoln Trail
 National Parkway crosses into Illinois toward
 Springfield.  This proposed National Park-
 way originates at the Lincoln birthplace in
 Hodgenville, Kentucky, and passes through
 the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial in
 Spencer County, Indiana.   I mention the
 Lincoln Trail National Parkway for I am cer-

 Mr. NELSON.  Mr. President, the Mis-
 sissippi shooting of James Meredith
 showed the need for stronger Federal
 legislation to protect people exercising
 their constitutional rights.
 I have been advocating such legisla-
 tion since April 1, 1964 when I intro-
 duced a bill to make it a Federal offense
 to murder a person. exercising his civil
 rights.
 Since then a number of similar bills
 have been introduced.  I am a cospon-
 sor of a bill by Senator DOUGLAS which
 would broaden Federal offenses in the
 area of civil rights. Under this bill, for
 .instance, the killer of a civil rights work-
 er could be charged in Federal court
 with the crime of murder, rather than
 merely with depriving someone of his
 constitutional rights.
 I am also cosponsoring the adminis-
 tration's omnibus civil rights bill, one
 ,section of which would make racial vio-
 lence an explicit Federal crime.
 All the rights granted Americans by
 the U.S. Constitution, and all the Su-
 preme Court decisions carefully defin-
 ing and protecting these rights, can be
 nullified by would-be assassins such as
 the one who gunned down James Mere-
 dith.  This kind of terror nullifies the
 rights of every American citizen.
 The U.S. Congress cannot allow this
 to continue.
 The fundamental  American  rights
 granted by the Constitution must be
 backed up by Federal law.  There have
 been a great number of tragedies over
 the years to demonstrate the need for
 Federal legislation protecting those who
 merely seek to exercise their American
 rights.  The Meredith case is the latest
 example. I hope it shocks the Amer-
 ican public and the Congress sufficiently
 to enable us to pass this long overdue
 legislation.
 VISTA VOLUNTEERS
 Mr. BARTLETT.  Mr.  President, I
 should like to share with my colleagues a
 letter a member of my staff received from
 two VISTA volunteers serving in the
 small, remote Eskimo village of Kwigil-
 lingok, Alaska.
 VISTA volunteers in Alaska are called
 upon to perform their duties under cir-
 cumstances few of them could have vis-
 ualized before their service began.  They
 are performing them well.  Indeed, their
 fame preceded them for before the pro-
 gram was enacted, the native people of
 Alaska had requested volunteers. Alaska

 Kuskokwim and Yukon
 description of what life offers them in the
 village should be encouraging to all of us
 for  it  demonstrates  that VISTA has
 chosen its volunteers wisely and that we
 were right in enacting the program.
 I ask unanimous consent that the let-
 ter be printed at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the letter
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 MAY 15, 1966.
 DEAR Miss NORDALE: Well, here it is Sunday
 night in Kwigillingok.  We're sitting here In
 our "living room" writing by candlelight, eat-
 ing Swedish coffee bread sent from home and
 drinking coffee.  This weekend's been a good
 one, we've gotten a lot accomplished and it's
 just now that we've gotten a chance to sit
 down and write a few letters.
 We thank you very much for having re-
 plied to our letter as quickly as you did.  You
 can be assured that we are encouraging our
 people to continue their planning on the
 proposed move.  The people know that Sen-
 ator BARTLETT will do his best for them and
 your letter fortified their convictions.
 As for life in the village spring has cer-
 tainly brought Kwig out of its winter's hiber-
 nation.                                                                      We can see every day the men com-
 ing back from the ocean with their sleds
 loaded with seal and walrus.  The women
 then are busy preparing the seal, stretching
 and drying the skin which is to be sold or
 sewn and then blown up to be used as con-
 tainers for seal oil (which are eventually put
 in the ground to be stored for winter's use).
 Aside from our normal work in the village
 we have our interesting side-lines too: one
 of our neighbors is going to show us, on
 Tuesday afternoon, how to use the "ooloo" to
 skin seal-if, in return, we'll show her how to
 make the cheese souffle she saw us making
 the other day!!   (You should have seen her
 face when it came out of the oven-you
 should have seen ours too-didn't think it
 would turn out too well as it was our first!)
 As for our work day in the village our
 schedule has been lengthened as the daylight
 now lasts until 10 p.m., soon to last even
 longer.  Our nursery school, 9-11, five morn-
 ings a week is doing fine, now Including
 three-year-olds as well as the four- and five-
 year-olds.  Eskimo children are certainly not
 much different from children in the "Lower
 48"-there are devils and angels everywhere!
 In the afternoon our house is flooded with
 little  kids, some  days  there  being  game
 hours and others being reading time or story
 hour.
 Our Brownies and Jr. Scouts are doing
 fine and are now all excited about their past
 rummage sale (held last Saturday).  We gave
 them a few hints about pricing but they did
 the majority of the work-and were very
 proud to report that they had earned $104.761
 (We feel like proud mother hens!)   (And
 we were very pleased to find a native girl
 who has now taken over leadership of the
 Jr. Scouts.)  The girls are now getting ex-
 cited about the forthcoming July Fourth
 12153
 celebration. Kwigs first parade and Memor-
 ial Service to the men in Vietnam.
 So, this summer certainly holds a lot in
 store for us including egg hunting, berry
 picking and our town council president Is
 even loaning us his kayak so we can practice
 paddling on the lake!
 Don't know whether we told you or not
 but we had a red fox as a pet til it got
 away-but now have another pet-this time
 caught by a villager at the ocean: a pet
 baby seal!  Thought we'd be able to cuddle
 it but it snaps like a dog and won't let us
 within five feet of it!  So, we now have a
 "guest" on our porch!
 Well, Miss Nordale, we're running out of
 space and the candles are flickering so as we
 have a busy day tomorrow (nursery school,
 Brownies tutoring)  we had better sign off
 now.  Our regards to Senator BARTLETT.
 Love,
 JUDY and CHATTYE.

 IETNAM AND PRESS COVERAGE
 (Mr. HULL asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1
 minute, to revise and extend his remarks,
 and to include an editorial.)
 Mr. HULL.  Mr. Speaker, under leave
 to extend my remarks in the RECORD, I
 include the following editorial which ap-
 peared recently in the St. Joseph, Mo.,
 News-Press :
 VIETNAM AFFAIR AND PRESS COVERAGE
 Every administration in Washington sooner
 or later shoots at the press for its own short-
 comings.  It was true of Theodore Roosevelt
 who invented an Ananias Club to which he
 consigned reporters who printed the truth,
 news not colored as T.R. wanted it.  It was
 true of Herbert Hoover who shied away from
 all publicity after his gorgeous honeymoon
 wrecked  confidence  in  his  administration
 over  the  world  depression.  It  was  most
 surely true of Franklin D. Roosevelt, perhaps
 most of all.  (Remember his satirical gesture
 awarding an Iron Cross to a White House cor-
 respondent who dared print the truth?).
 And so it is with the Lyndon B. Johnson
 administration.  The President himself stays
 in the background but very recently a White
 House secretary spoke of "inexperienced re-
 porters" and "headline type of coverage" as
 to Viet Nam. 'Another aide spoke of "dis-
 torted reports from Viet Nam."
 Fortunately, we the press of America, have
 a top newspaper man who knows news.  He
 happens to be Wes Gallagher, general man-
 ager of the Associated Press.  He is a man
 who has come up through the ranks, having
 been with that famed, and leading news-
 gathering organization since 1937.  Wes is
 sick and tired of the sniping from the Palace
 Guard of the President.  He defies AP and
 all news gathering detractors in words that
 are worthy to be read by the general public.
 "The fact is" says Wes Gallagher, "the press
 always has been attacked in wartime because
 its reports frequently clash with government
 views and with the image government would
 like  to  present.  And  reporters  too  must
 bring unpleasant, confusing and discourag-
 ing reports to the public which reacts, as all
 people do, with irritation."
 Mr. Gallagher correctly states that criti-
 cism of the press by the government rises
 in direct proportion to the amount of ad-
 verse news printed which may not be in line
 with government policy.

 The inexperience charge is totally untrue.
 Men covering the Viet Nam war are far more
 experienced in fair, impartial reporting than
 are government yes men who hop, skip and
 jump at the brow-lifting or finger-twirling
 of that man from Texas who succeeded John
 F. Kennedy, as our President.
 The present Associated Press staff in Viet
 Nam ranges in age from 61 'to 25 with expe-
 rience in reporting as follows: 35 years, 28
 years, 23 years, 18 years, 14 years, 13 years,
 11 years, 8 years and 7 years.  Three have
 covered World War II and the Korean "po-
 lice action."
 The News-Press and Gazette are proud of
 the wholesome coverage the Associated Press
 is giving our readers as to Viet Nam,  Last
 year your Associated Press spent three-quar-
 ters of a million dollars on staff and com-
 munications.
 Let this be said and we defy successful
 contradiction from anyone in Washington:
 Newspaper reporting from Viet Nam has
 been more-accurate than the official state-
 ments, whether via the Pentagon, the field,
 the State Department, or the White House
 inner circle.
 The Associated Press is covering a war, not
 a political hullabaloo, even if some in Wash-
 ington think otherwise.  This war, and do
 not fool yourself, this is war in Viet Nam,
 has presented the most confusing and con-
 troversial in  all American history.  There
 are the world of impounderables, the huge
 gaps between the South and the North Viet-
 namese, between the hawks and the doves,
 by those for and those against the war.
 American correspondents in Viet Nam as a
 whole, report all correctly, to the dismay at
 times alternately of the hawks and of the
 doves, and always of the pressure men called
 White House press aides.
 How lovely it would be to Washington if
 the press reported only the good news from
 Viet Nam.  But that is not good newspa-
 pering.  That is  deceit,  unworthy of  the
 Fourth Estate.                   I
 The function of the press is to present
 the news, good or bad, fairly and without
 slightest bias.  Let critics cry.  The people
 want truth.
 A PERMANENT U.N. PEACEKEEPING
 FORCE
 (Mr. SCHWEIKER asked and was
 given permission to address the House for
 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. SCHWEIKER.  Mr. Speaker, 49
 of my colleagues and I are today intro-
 ducing a resolution calling for the estab-
 lishment of a permanent United Nations
 peacekeeping force.
 Particularly at this time of interna-
 tional tension, it would seem to me that
 the United States, as one of the leading
 member nations of the U. U., ought to
 continue its attempts to help strengthen
 that important world body.
 Earlier this year, efforts were made to
 bring the Vietnam conflict before the Se-
 curity Council for discussion.  In my
 view, these efforts were both necessary
 and desirable and should continue at the
 earliest possible date. For it is through
 such efforts that the United Nations will
 continue to perform its important role in
 -world affairs.
 By the same token, such actions as we
 are calling for in this `resolution today
 can add immeasurably to the United Na-

 LANHAM "TEX" CONNOR, FORMER
 DEAN OF OFFICIAL REPORTERS
 TO HOUSE COMMITTEES
 (Mr. GEORGE W. ANDREWS asked
 and was given permission to address the
 House for 1 minute, to revise and extend
 his remarks, and to include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. GEORGE W. ANDREWS.  Mr.
 Speaker, I would like to take this oppor-
 tunity to say a few words in behalf of
 Lanham Connor, whom we affectionately
 call "Tex."  As many of you know, Tex
 retired recently after many years of
 faithful service as an Official Reporter
 to House Committees.  In fact, for the
 past 8 years he has been dean of Official
 Reporters to House Committees.
 Tex hails from the State of Texas.
 He is the nephew of the late Fritz Lan-
 ham, who served in the U.S. House of
 Representatives for many years.  His
 grandfather, S. W. T. Lanham, served
 two terms as Governor of the State of
 Texas and then was elected to the U.S.
 House of Representatives where he served
 25 years with distinction.
 Tex came to Washington In 1939 as a
 free lance reporter, and did not begin
 working for the House of Representa-
 tives until 1942, when the late Speaker
 Sam Rayburn appointed him to the corps
 of Official Reporters to House Commit-
 tees.                                                                                              I understand he has "reported"
 every Defense Subcommittee appropria-
 tions bill for the past 24 years. That is
 quite a record.  As a member of that
 subcommittee I am well aware of the
 fine job he has done.
 During the hearings before the Legis-
 lative Subcommittee of the House Ap-
 propriations Subcommittee tributes were
 paid to Tex.  I had left the committee
 room to answer a rollcall and was not
 present, but I am pleased to include the
 remarks made by my colleagues:
 TsIBUTFS To TEx CONNOR
 Mr. SLACK. The record will show at this
 point that Tex Connor, who I understand was
 the dean of official committee reporters, has
 just recently retired.  He has been a very
 loyal and faithful reporter to the committees,
 and particularly to the Committee on Appro-
 priations, and we certainly wish Tex and his
 wife many happy years to come.
 Mr. STEED. Mr. Chairman, I would like to
 add my word of commendation to our old

 the public. I would say this is less of an
 invasion than a "border skirmish.".
 Mr, Speaker, as my colleagues will
 note,', I have been incensed by these
 charges. I am no enemy of conservation,
 and my 36 colleagues joining me in this
 bill are no enemies of conservation.  I,
 for one, fought long'and hard for the
 Wilderness Act.  I devoted great time
 and effort to the Land and Water Con-
 servation Act. I am working right now
 for, passage of the Indiana Dunes Na-
 tional Lakeshore bill.  And I shall con-
 tinue to work for conservation and park
 legislation as long as I am In the Con-
 gress. To have legislation I have spon-
 sored attacked in this irresponsible man-
 ner is highly offensive to me, and I have
 wanted my colleagues to have the benefit
 of a prompt reply from me to these at-
 tacks on my bill;
 What is proposed in the Colorado
 River Basin project bill is a solution to
 part of the immediate water needs of
 Arizona and California and the financ-
 ing of future water imports or other
 works to meet the needs of five other
 Western States.
 I hope my colleagues will note that
 nowhere does the Sierra Club say that
 the water will be auxiliary or unneeded.
 It is needed desperately.  Our popula-
 tions are growing in the West, and people
 need water. It is not going to solve the
 problem merely to tell people to stay
 home in Wisconsin or Pennsylvania.
 They are going to come because this
 Nation. is growing, and our population
 is moving.  We cannot tell the West to
 "stop growing"; it is  going  to grow
 whether the Sierra Club likes it or not.
 Instead of attacking this legislation as
 ruining the Grand Canyon the Sierra
 Club ought to praise the people who have
 drafted It because it gives such great re-
 spect to Grand Canyon National Park
 and Grand Canyon National Monument.
 Far from ruining the canyon these dams
 will insure that no serious and damaging
 incursions will occur in the future. The
 Job will be done, and it will be done right.
 In my Judgment, Mr. Speaker, this
 legislation marks a great beginning an
 the long fight to solve this Nation's
 mounting water crisis. In years past we
 have always dealt with our water prob-
 lems on a local, piecemeal basis. For this
 reason Arizona and California were at
 odds for years, and we went to the Su-
 preme Court to settle our dispute. Now
 we are on the same side, working to-
 gether.  I do not think you could find
 greater evidence of the statesmanship
 involved in this legislation, or of the sig-
 nificance of what we are attempting to
 do. What we propose is a regional so-
 lution of major water problems.  What
 we succeed in doing here can set the Pat-
 tern for other regions of the country to
 follow, and through these acts of water
 statesmanship we can come to grips at
 last with the myriad of water problems
 facing so many of our States.
 Mr,. Speaker, I have attempted to an-
 swer each of the charges made by the
 Sierra' Club in these ads.  I hope and
 trust my colleagues will rest easier know-
 ing that these 'sweeping charges are
 either false, misleading; or both.  And I
 nor the 36 cosponsors of my bill would
 endorse legislation meeting the descrip-
 tions applied to it by the Sierra Club
 today.
 Before concluding I should like to refer
 to a recent statement by Laurence
 Rockefeller, Chairman of the White
 House Conference on Natural. Beauty,
 who said:
 Conservationists have had to do some re-
 thinking,  too.   For  most  conservationists,
 development had long been an anathema:
 they have been interested in nondevelop-
 ment, and to them the natural foe has been
 the bulldozer and the builder-Indeed, some
 conservationists would go almost so far as to
 include people.
 Unswerving hostility to development, how-
 ever, condemns the conservationists to a rear
 guard action, and more and more of them
 are coming to recognize that this is defeatist.
 If conservation, as I believe, Involves the
 wise use of our renewable resources, those
 who wish to see better environment for our
 people must work with the future.  Whether
 one likes it or not, many more houses are
 going to be built, many more bridges and
 highways,  and  the important  question is
 not if, but how.
 Mr. Speaker, I believe Mr. Rockefeller
 is right and the Sierra Club is wrong in
 this instance.  I would hope the Sierra
 Club would reconsider before proceeding
 further with this i11-conceived attack on
 a sound and constructive solution to the
 water problems of the Southwest. I cer-
 tainly do not believe it has anything con-
 structive to offer when It concludes one of
 these ads with this statement:
 In five years your Reclamation engineers
 can close the Grand Canyon show-the es-
 sence and excellence of it-end it for all our
 civilization's time.
 I trust all who have stuck with me
 through this rather lengthy speech will
 understand now how false-how utterly
 and completely false-is that statement.
 The Grand Canyon show is not coming
 to an end. It is going to go on for the
 rest of time. And a lot more people are
 going to see it than ever before.

 U.S. CAMERAMEN AND REPORTERS
 WORK UNDER EXTREMELY HAZ-
 ARDOUS CONDITIONS IN VIETNAM!'[
 The  SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
 ALBERT). Under previous order of the
 House the gentleman from Delaware
 [Mr. McDOWELL] is recognized for 30
 minutes.
 Mr. McDOWELL.  Mr. Speaker, on.
 May 25, 1966, I addressed the House, on.
 the subject of certain wire service photos,
 and reports published in various news
 papers regarding recent events within
 Da Nang's besieged Tinh Hoi Pagoda in.
 Vietnam.
 I called attention to the discrepancies
 between the AP and the UPI pictures and
 captions and a story filed by Richard
 Critchfleld, Asian correspondent for the
 Washington, D.C., Evening Star, and I
 simply requested a clarification.
 I now submit for the RECORD the replies
 to my request for clarification of these
 discrepancies which I received from the
 UPI, AP, and the Washintgon, D.C.,
 Evening Star, and I commend them and
 their staff photographers and reporters
 in South Vietnam for their prompt and
 candid response to my request of May 25.'
 I especially commend to my collegaues
 and the American public the expanded
 reply of Richard Critchfield whose honest
 reporting has been confirmed by the
 replies I have received, and which was
 highly commended editorially by the
 Chicago Tribune on May 26, 1966.  His
 factual reporting is in the highest tra-
 dition of our free press, and adds signifi
 cantly to our understanding of the tragic
 events in Vietnam.
 It may be helpful to emphasize a point
 I made in an interview published in the
 June 4, 1966, issue of Editor & Publisher,
 that-
 Editors  should  certainly  look  into  the
 matter if questionable pictures of this nature
 continue to crop up. They owe it to their
 readers to see to it that propaganda masked
 as  news  is not  allowed  to infiltrate our
 newspapers.
 For, as I pointed out in my floor re-
 marks on May 25 :
 If one single picture or one single major
 news story can be questioned for accuracy
 and factual background, then the American
 public should know this so that they may
 judge  their  newspapers  accordingly.  We
 expect propaganda in the Communist press.
 Certainly our own free press should not be
 subject to such a charge.
 The replies I have received from UPI,
 AP, and the Washington, D.C., Evening
 Star, as well as the lead editorial.from
 the Chicago Tribune to which I referred
 earlier, follow:

 Buddhist. pagoda in Da Nang.  The fact is
 'that they lay wounded on a stretcher in the
 courtyard of the pagoda when reporters and
 staff  photographers  of  various U.S.  news
 media arrived, including UPI Staff Photog-
 rapher Steve Van Meter.  The fact is that
 there were about 30 staff correspondents
 and news photographers of U.S. media at the
 scene.  They testify at length that they did
 not feel they were trapped in the pagoda by
 the Buddhists, but moved freely as gunfire
 permitted.  The, fact is that the head monk,
 Thick Minh Chieu, had called a news con-
 ference at the pagoda.  The fact is that the
 woman was alive, not dead, and we state
 that on the testimony of several correspond-
 ents, and on the basis of a sequence of still
 newspictures.
 The fact is there were many other wounded
 and dead, including more than 30 bodies in
 one room and another wounded woman on
 a stretcher in the courtyard near the woman
 and baby.  The fact is that the pagoda was
 the nearest place with a dispensary not a
 hospital, but more than a first aid station.
 The woman and baby apparently were in-
 jured by mortar Are and were brought to the
 pagoda by Boy Scouts.
 The fact is the woman and baby picture
 was not (repeat not) set up or staged by any
 representatives of the U.S. media.  The ques-
 tion 'then is whether the Buddhists had
 staged the scene prior to arrival of photog-
 raphers and newsmen.  Our representatives
 and several other do not think so.  The
 wounda were fresh, as if they had just been
 bro,iagght in.  The fact is that Richard Critch-
 field of the Washington Star said in Saigon
 yesterday that he did not (repeat not) see
 anyone prop the baby up beside the woman,
 nor did he see the woman and the baby
 brought in.     "Maybe these were not staged,"
 he said, "but there were so many other things
 that were going on that you had to realize
 that these things were being staged.  For in-
 stance, the bodies of two monks draped on
 the steps of another pagoda.  The Buddhist
 Boy Scouts who ran out under fire and
 dragged the bodies back into the pagoda-
 just                 so  they  could  claim      their  wounded.
 Soxne of them they wounded themselves."
 Other  newsmen   disputed  the       charge
 against the Boy Scouts.  Leon Daniel, UPI
 staff correespondent, said "I felt they were
 heroic. I certainly don't think they were
 risking their lives that way for propaganda
 purposes."  Sean Flynn, a free lancer for
 several large publications, said: "I've pic-
 tures of those kids.  I'll fight Critchfield on
 that point." The fact remains that a civilian
 woman and baby were injured in civil strife
 and it was a legitimately newsworthy pic-
 ture.                 If the Buddhists called a new con-
 ference to use the U.S. media it was used no
 more than by any other individual or group
 which calls news conferences  to present
 views,  The UPI has experienced newsmen
 and photographers in Vietnam and all of us
 are dedicated to objective, accurate report-
 ing.  The final fact is that we strive for that
 every day.

 [From the Washington (D.C.) Evening Star,
 May 27, 19661
 AP, UPI DENY CHARGE VIET PHOTO WAS POSED
 The Associated Press and United Press In-
 ternational, responding to a congressional
 challenge, have denied that their photo-
 graphs of a Vietnamese woman and baby,
 taken during the recent civil strife at Da
 Nang, were posed.
 In separate statements, the news agencies
 replied  to  earlier  remarks  in  the  House
 Wednesday by Rep. HARRIS B. McDowELL,
 D-Del.   McDowELL had said there was an
 apparent discrepancy between photographs
 transmitted by both AP and UPI and a news
 dispatch from Richard Critchfield, Asian cor-
 respondent of The Star.
 The news services each distributed a photo-
 graph                                                                            of  a  woman lying  wounded  on  a
 stretcher, with a baby beside her, taken Sun-
 day night Inside the courtyard of a pagoda.
 Newsmen had been  summoned  there by
 Buddhists opposing the Saigon government
 for an announcement.
 Critchfield, in his dispatch Tuesday, re-
 ported the newsmen had been "enticed in-
 side for a fictional urgent announcement,
 then were told it was too dangerous to leave
 for the remainder of the night after Buddhist
 forces provoked a heavy fire fight with sur-
 rounding paratroopers and tanks."
 He contended the entire incident had been
 staged as a propaganda show for the Ameri-
 can reporters and photographers.  He wrote,
 "perhaps the most cynical and outrageous
 touch  was  a  wailing  baby  someone  had
 propped against the body of a dead woman
 for the photographers' benefit."
 MCDOWELL, said that either AP and UPI
 photographers or Critchfield were guilty of
 "inaccurate and irresponsible" reporting,,
 The  wire  services,  in  their  statements,
 yesterday, said picture sequences clearly es-
 tablished                                                                             the           woman their photographers
 pictured was not dead.  They said their men
 had not posed the photograph, and did not
 think it had been posed.
 Critchfield, replying from Saigon, conceded
 the woman may have been alive as "I did not
 feel the woman's pulse," but defended his
 reporting of the entire episode in the pagoda
 as accurately portraying the scene.
 "Congressman    MCDOWELL'S    contention
 that it was either a question of inaccuracy
 by the photographers or myself-if, indeed,
 we  are  discussing the  same woman and
 baby-is open  to question.  The photog-
 rapher's                                                                                     job  is  to take pictures  of what
 exists.  A reporter's job is to try to and tell
 what is happening as best he can.
 "A wounded or dead woman lay on the
 ground with a wailing baby by her side.
 That is a news photograph by any standard.
 But the circumstances and the setting sur-
 rounding her were equally important to con-
 vey.  That is the reporter's job: To describe
 what he sees and to place the event in con-
 text and proper perspective.
 "What I attempted to point out was that
 when we (some 40 newsmen)  walked into
 that pagoda, an array of wounded and dead
 bodies-including a woman and a child-
 were lying around in an apparently-staged
 display.  That was the immediate impression
 of those newsmen around me.
 "The wounded badly needed medical at-
 tention and the Buddhist monks there had
 the ability to get them out if they wanted,
 as they later demonstrated."
 Critchfield went on to recount what he
 called the "nightmarish experience of being
 temporarily  trapped  within  the  pagoda."
 When the newsmen arrived, he said, it was
 almost dark.
 Once inside the pagoda gates, they saw
 youths and women swathed in bloody band-
 ages lying about the courtyard.  Four women
 lay on stretchers on the ground just before
 the pagoda steps.  Off to the side was a
 woman with a baby.
 "The woman's eyes were closed and she
 appeared to be dead," Critchfield continued.
 "A very small baby-perhaps less than 1 year
 old-apparently had been placed by her side
 near the waist.  It was crying and held its
 arms toward us and did not appear to be
 injured.  I did not feel the woman's pulse.
 "From     the  nearby  classroom  came  the
 stench from 26 bodies, many of them putre-
 scent."
 He added:
 "A number of reporters voiced fears we had
 walked into a trap and others voiced disgust
 a the display of the wounded."
 REPORTER WOUNDED
 The AP, in its statement written after
 checking its Saigon office, said one of its
 reporters, Robert Poos, said that the woman
 in question "was not dead nor was the pic-
 ture posed.                                                                                                                                                                      The picture sequence taken by
 an                    AP  staff  photographer  showed  the
 mother's arms in three different positions."
 Poos was wounded in the chest as he left
 the pagoda grounds.
 UPI, in a statement by Charles McCarty,
 assistant general manager of UPI news pic-
 tures, urged MCDOWELL to "set the record
 straight concerning your charges yesterday
 that we misled the public with a picture from
 Saigon Sunday.... "
 McCarty also said:
 "The fact is the woman and baby picture
 was not set up or staged by any representa-
 tive of the U.S. media.  The question then
 is whether the Buddhists had staged the
 scene prior to arrival of photographers and
 newsmen.
 "Our representatives and several others do
 not think so....  If the Buddhists called a
 news conference to use the U.S. media it
 was used no more than by any other indivi-
 dual or group which calls news conferences
 to present views."
 Critchfield does not say the photographers
 staged the picture.  He does contend that
 the Buddhists summoned the newsmen to
 the pagoda after staging a scene to elicit
 sympathy-and support-for their position.

 (Associated Press, New York-Washington
 Star special)
 SAIGON, May 28.-Saigon Vietnamese news-
 papers this morning published statements
 from both American press Services made in
 response to charges by Rep. MCDOWELL con-
 cerning newspicture taken in Danang last
 Sunday night.
 McDOWELL cited article by this reporter
 written  Tuesday  contending  propaganda
 scene had been staged within Pagoda de-.
 liberately to picture South Vietnamese mili-
 tary forces as slaughtering innocent women
 and children.
 He quoted one scene in my Tuesday dis-
 patch "Perhaps the most cynical and out-
 rageous touch was a wailing baby someone
 had propped against the body of a dead
 woman for the photographers' benefit."
 Though McDOwELL did not refer to it I also
 had written in previous story Monday "the
 Pagoda precinct itself  covering about  a
 fourth of city block, was a grisly nightmare
 scene.  Twenty-six corpses some packed in
 salt                   and  others  badly decomposed and
 covered with buddhist flags swarming with
 flies                 gave  whole   area sickening stench.
 Stretchers of wounded women and teenage
 boys  wrapped  with  bloody  bandages lay
 about the courtyard as if they were on dis-
 play for the foreign press.  This tragic spec-
 tacle included one dead woman with it
 wailing baby."
 The controversial story was written fol-
 lowing day in effort to put this scene in more
 perspective,   It was intended as analysis.
 As I have pointed out while AP photograph.
 does not entirely resemble what I remem-
 bered it is possible I was mistaken.
 'It all happened quickly-we were invited.
 to pagoda, fired at as we entered, milled about
 in semidarkness and confusion, a rebel youth
 grabbed me by shoulder to see what he said
 was example government repression and I
 saw woman who to all appearances was dead.
 Have vivid impression of black hair bloody
 bandages and baby visibly terrified and cry-
 ing raising its arms to be taken away.
 Moments  later  heavy  firefighting  erupted
 and bullets sprayed courtyard and I did not
 see woman and baby again.  I understand
 AP is trying to trace her.  .

 set u  as a fake" by foreign newsman.  I
 ,nape Ernown some of photographers involved

 What I did however, intend was to inter-
 pret entire spectacle at Tinh Hoi as I and
 some of the other newsmen present caw it:
 A flagrant example of stagemanaging by a
 extremely skillful propaganda apparatus.
 Whether rebels intended to hold us host-
 ages to ensure their own protection or in-
 volve American Marines or simply to play on
 our sympathies matter of speculation.  But
 that certain aspects of scene contrived for
 calculated effect I had no doubt whatsoever.
 Since some newsmen present then remained
 in Danang and others returned to Saigon
 and elsewhere and civil strife has continued
 have had no oportunity to canvass everybody
 present.  APS Robert Poos yesterday con-
 firmed I had quoted him accurately as say-
 ing the "Buddists had trapped us in the
 pagoda and then opened fire when we tried
 to go."
 Ruben Salazar of Los Angeles Times con-
 firms  Thich  Minh  Chieu  chief  Monk  in
 pagoda told newsmen he had invited them
 there for express purpose of witnessing gov-
 ernment attack he expected either that night
 or early morning.
 Simon Petrie a French correspondent for
 Paris Match and other publications whose
 Danang home was ransacked by government
 troops two days before said yesterday he
 shared  my  belief  spectacle  of  wounded
 staged for our benefit.
 Francois Sully of Newsweek Magazine re-
 ported his subsequent research in Danang
 substantiated what I had written.
 Dale Minor of WBAR New York who re-
 corded most of the sounds in pagoda on his
 taperecorder said yesterday he was convinced
 government  troops  had  twice  "raked  the
 courtyard" with machine gun fire while we
 were there and wounded lay exposed in
 open.
 Ronald Nessen of NBC and William Stout
 of CBS who shared same ditch during first
 heavy firelight both expressed conviction at
 time rebels had provoked government fire
 to trap us  in pagoda.  No rebel ever ex-
 pressly forbade us to leave.  But several told
 me after firefight roughly same message "it
 is too dangerous new for you to leave before
 morning."
 David Kelly of London Economist who left
 Danang Sunday afternoon said yesterday he
 had  seen  considerable  evidence  of rebel
 stagemanaging events during his two day
 stopover in Danang.
 Kelly felt controversy produced "a health-
 ier  situation".  Kelly  said  while  he  felt
 monks at TinHol had shown respect for dead
 by arranging bodies and observing traditional
 ceremonies, two monks found sprawled dead
 in pagoda  entrance  Friday morning had
 Two tracer bullets were fired straight over
 our heads from pagoda gate as we approached
 pagoda.  At this point Neil Sheehan of New
 York Times and one other newsman near
 rear of group turned back to American Press
 camp.
 About dozen of us were too close to pagoda
 by then to feel could safely retreat but from
 that moment all of us felt frightened and
 uneasy if not trapped.  Others already in-
 side possibly felt easier in their minds.
 Within minutes however six or seven news-
 men  although  urgent                                                                              announcement  had

 tempted to leave pagoda, were fired upon
 and wounded by grenade fragments.     One
 photographer I saw voiced real panic. An-
 other a vietnamese handed his camera over
 to his American employer and said no mat-
 ter what he was getting out.
 Everyone  I  saw with  exception  of one
 heroic voice who shouted across courtyard "I
 am staying all night" was either angry or
 frightened and many could  be accurately
 described as terrified.
 UPI mentions pagoda was nearest place
 with dispensary which was true.  But a heav-
 ily armored battalion had surrounded its
 rear at five o'clock triggering heavy firefight
 and rebels later triggered another between
 seven and eight when we were inside pagoda.
 According to APS investigation woman and
 baby were mortar fire victims and had been
 found hiding and brought by Buddhist boy-
 scouts near house some two hundred yards
 What really happened during those con-
 fused moments in Tin Hoi could probably be
 accurately determined by interviewing each
 of newsmen involved, Marine officers at press
 camp and most of several hundred Vietna-
 mese wounded during the entire week.  A
 careful study could be made of rebel prop-
 aganda  apparatus.    This  would require
 United States government resources since
 newsmen must go on and report continuing
 daily events.  The issue is profoundly im-
 portant one in Vietnam and should not be
 lost in secondary matter of whether picture
 was faked,  Of course it was not and this
 reporter never meant to imply it was.  The
 stagemanaging was done on much vaster
 scale and this propaganda apparatus is what
 should be investigated and accused, not the
 press services.  End Critchfield
 [From the Chicago (Ill.)  Tribune, May 26,
 19661
 THE SCALES FELL FROM THEIR EYES
 One of the most significant news stories
 of the Viet Nam war was written by Richard
 Critchfield, a distinguished Washington Star
 correspondent, distributed by the Associated
 Press, and published by The Tribune yes-
 terday.
 Mr.  Critchfield's  dispatch  is  conclusive
 evidence that some of the reporting from
 Viet Nam has been the worst in our his-
 tory,                                                                                                                                      which  is  a   major  reason  why  the
 American people are so confused about it.
 The story recounts the horrible experi-
 ence of 40 American and foreign newsmen
 who were lured into Da Nang's Buddhist
 Tinh Hoi pagoda, besieged by government
 troops, by revolutionary monks who promised
 them an important statement.  When they
 arrived the newsmen were told that it was too
 dangerous for them to leave, and they soon
 realized that the treacherous monks had en-
 ticed them into the pagoda as hostages.
 Either their presence would deter govern-
 ment troops from assaulting the pagoda or,
 if it should be stormed, the surviving news-
 men would put the blame for the attack on
 military forces loyal to Premier Ky.
 Mr. Critchfield describes the experience of
 the newsmen as "a kind of shock treatment
 that  stripped  bare  the  almost  incredible
 cynicism  of    Buddhist   monks  and   rebel
 political commissars  toward    human  life."
 The incident, he says, exploded the myth
 that the Buddhists represented "a just but
 repressed popular cause." He says the "scales
 fell from the eyes" of the naive newsmen
 who had helped to propagate this myth.
 Despite the risk of being shot in the back
 by the Buddhist rebels, the newsmen, as Mr.
 Critchfield says, decided to "stand up for hu-
 man decency."  They turned their backs on
 the monks, marched out, waving handker-
 chiefs and undershirts, and three of them
 were injured by rebel snipers and a grenade.
 Mr. Critchfield has a reputation for honest,
 objective reporting.  Unlike many others in
 Viet Nam, he has not distorted facts to sup-
 port some ideological predilection.  But he
 is an idealist, and he had sincerely believed
 that the Buddhist insurrection was a popu-
 lar movement.  He was the closest American
 correspondent in Viet Nam to Gen. Nguyen
 Chanh Thi, deposed former commander of
 the 1st corps area and political ally of the
 infamous Thich Trf Quang, leader of the
 Buddhist rebels.  Thus his account of the
 revelation in the Tinh Hoi pagoda is a con-
 fession of immense significance.
 The  Buddhist tactics  described  by  Mr.
 Critchfield are characteristically communist
 and wholly incompatible with the self-deny-
 ing ascetic, and gentle attitudes  of Bud-
 dhism.   They debased their own religious
 sanctuary, refusing to bury their dead on the
 pretense that government troops would not
 let them out of the pagoda, when trucks fly-
 ing Red Cross flags were coming and going
 with arms and ammunition.  They armed Boy
 Scouts and induced them to fire and throw
 away to pagoda compound.  This was during
 daylight since darkness fell only when we
 reached the gate.   During daylight hours
 ambulances  and  other vehicles  had been
 coming and going from pagoda all day.
 When we arrived rebels voiced fears of
 imminent  government  attack.    These  in-
 cluded apparent leader Thich Minh Chieu.
 My contention was that wounded could
 have been carried away from pagoda to
 safety and help down the street since only
 four government tanks on that side.     My
 contention was that to bring them to pagoda
 endangered their lives both from lack of
 medical care and exposure to incoming bul-
 lets since they were left lying in exposed
 courtyard.
 Friday  afternoon  Kenneth  Harbidge  of
 Philadelphia one of two American business-
 men sharing house two blocks away from
 pagoda told me it was his impression most
 of wounded civilians in area has been hit
 by rebel fire whether rescued by Buddhist
 boyscouts or not.
 Harbidge a former Army major said he
 had seen rebels laying boobytraps in streets
 and small boys running back and forth with
 grenades under their shirts.
 His house was hit with mortar wounding
 landlady and a servant blown up by street-
 mine.   Harbidge  put  blame  for  both on
 rebels.
 UPI noted I had said I had not seen any-
 one prop up baby nor had I seen woman
 or baby brought in.  This is true. But wom-
 an I saw dead or alive was in no condition
 to look after that child and somebody' would
 have had to prop it there which was what I
 reported.
 There was also testimony Buddhist boy-
 scouts had acted heriocally rescuing wounded
 under fire.  I agree one hundred percent.  My
 belief was that like highschool  girls     and
 others in pagoda the boyscouts were being
 used as unconscious instruments of a cynical
 propaganda apparatus involving only a hand-
 ful of leaders.   One of topmost Buddhist
 leaders told me Thursday that "romantic
 idealistic" youths made best agitators.  My
 experience in Danang was that many rebel
 soldiers,  boyscouts,  highschool  girls and
 others took part out of good faith in what
 felt was good cause,   Brig, Gen. Du Quoc
 Dong in interview expressed much same view

 was only                             one dead   soldier's body in evi-                   dente.
 UPI                         in its statement asked McDowell to
 set                        record straight and enumerated list of
 Pact                        s. It contended thirty reporters on scene

 testimony  should be recorded and
 publicized                                 to set the record straight.  Most
 of the                             other newsmen I talked to shared
 Poos                          belief we had been enticed into pagoda
 to                        trap us.  Through most of the episode
 newsmen                          en were in three separate groups.  I                   was with what appeared to be two television
 teams,                        NBC and CBS.

 STRUGGLE TO PROTECT OUR EN-
 VIRONMENT  FROM  POLLUTION
 ENLISTS TALENTS OF ABLE MEN
 FROM  MANY DIFFERENT PRO-
 FESSIONS
 The SPEAKER. Under previous order
 of the House the gentleman from Rhode
 Island [Mr. FOGARTY] is recognized for
 10 minutes.
 Mr. FOGARTY.  Mr. Speaker, the
 struggle to protect our environment from
 pollution has enlisted the talents of able
 men from many different professions. I
 would like to take occasion to pay tribute
 to a man who represents, with honor,
 that group of skilled and sophisticated
 engineers who have done so much in re-
 cent years to make this a healthier na-
 tion in which to live.
 This week Mr. Harry G. Hanson, Asso-
 ciate Chief for Environmental Health
 and an Assistant Surgeon General of the
 U.S.. Public Health Service Is leaving that
 organization after nearly 25 years of
 dedicated service.
 Many Member's of this Congress have
 become increasingly aware of the im-
 portance of combatting pollution of the
 environment as a menace to human
 health, as well as to important aesthetic
 and economic values. As a member and
 chairman of the subcommittee of the
 Committee  on  Appropriations  which
 deals with the annual budget of the Pub-
 lic Health Service, I have been impressed
 with the. tremendous task we confront in
 combatting a multitude of pollutants. I
 have also come to respect the engineers
 who were among the first of the profes-
 I am confident his experience and skill
 will serve this Nation well when Mr. Han-
 son assumes his new post as Regional
 Adviser for Sanitary Engineering with
 the Pan American Health Organization.
 On my own behalf and for Mr. Han-
 son's many other friends in Congress, I
 extend best wishes to Mr. Hanson for
 success in his new endeavors.  I would
 also add our thanks and appreciation for
 his significant contributions to the fur-
 therance of public health, as he has un-
 remittingly devoted himself to the health
 of people and their environment over a
 quarter century of public service,

 serious problems of `integration with other
 functional a rid` administrative unii?;s.
 A third approach is the development of
 truly metropolitan government.  This ap-
 pears to be working successfully in Dade
 County, Florida and sfiould be carefully
 '8tutied.for possible application elsewhere.
 -"Whatever the advantages' of strong cen-
 tral coordination, I think that our experience
 over the past three decades demonstrates
 that the problems of our urban society are
 too complex and too imminent to be suscep-
 tible of, central operation.  We can ease the
 administrative difficulties through the appli-
 cation of the techniques of modern manage-
 ment to urban problems.      The genius of
 systems technology is its ability to bring
 order out of tremendous numbers of diverse
 elements and factors-order that' not only
 stabilizes but creates the conditions for prog-
 ress as well.  These concepts, developed so
 brilliantly right here in Eastern Massachu-
 setts, are already being put to use on public
 problems.  The State  of  California  con-
 tracted with four aerospace firms for studies
 ,on crime, transportation, pollution and in-
 -formation control.  Computers will govern
 the scheduling and repair of trains in the
 new,Bay Area Rapid Transit system in San
 Francisco.  Experiments are now going for-
 Ward in Toronto and Chicago with the use
 of computers to regulate traffic.  There is
 enormous room for greater efforts here.  It
 is at this point that our technology most di-
 rectly confronts the urban challenge.
 Implicit in everything I have said about
 strengthening governmental institutions be-
 low the national level is the essential validity
 of government close to `the people.  One of
 the failures of our approach to urban prob-
 lems thus far is the inability of programs of
 concrete and granite to transform the lives
 of people.  This failure goes to the heart
 of the second question I raised a few minutes
 ago.  Who into govern?  -   '
 The historic `ideal of the town meeting
 where each citizen of the community could
 speak his piece and influence the decisions
 of the government closest to him is simply
 not feasible in a city of millions.  What we
 must strive for is a system of metropolitan
 government that will give people the sense of
 participation and involvement envisioned by
 the town meeting.  This will not be achieved
 simply by establishing quotas of representa-
 tion on city boards and agencies of "the
 poor" or any other category of citizen.  I am
 convinced that the consistently low turnout
 in elections conducted by the Office of Eco-
 nomic Opportunityrefects the inability of
 the citizens involved to believe that their
 representation would'really' make any dif-
 ference.  People will seek redress in the
 streets until they believe they can find it in
 the voting booth.  One of my former col-
 leagues in the House is making an exciting
 attempt to restore the confidence of people
 in government in New York .City.  We can
 only wish him well and hope that his exam-
 ple will be repeated elsewhere in the nation.
 ? In discussing with you some of the ' ele-
 ments in the urban challenge that concern
 me as a Member of Congress, I fear I have
 raised more questions than I have answered.
 Those of. us who must operate within the
 confines of existing geographic and adminis-
 trative divisions look to those of you with
 the freshness and imagination to develop
 new forms of government suitable to the age,
 yet consistent with our tested principles.
 It is an awesome challenge, but one from
 which we cannot turn away.  In confront-
 ing it, we might ' reflect upon our history.
 Almost two hundred years ago the people liv-
 ing on the Atlantic Coast of this continent
 cams together to govern a great nation; it
 is our challenge here today to come together
 to develop new and fresh approaches to the
 government of great cities.

 Representative Smith of New York Lauds
 Australian Economic and Military As-
 sistance in Vietnam
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. HENRY P. SMITH III
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, June 9, 1966
 Mr. SMITH of New York.  Mr. Speak-
 er, many Americans, I believe, are un-
 der the impression that the United
 States is "going it alone" in Vietnam;
 that only American forces are strug-
 gling to preserve the cause of freedom in
 that embattled nation.  It is true that
 our  fighting  men,  representing  every
 branch of our Armed Forces, are shoul-
 dering the greatest part of the burden in
 growing concern the fact that, for the
 past 5 weeks, the number of American
 men killed in action in Vietnam have
 exceeded the number of South Vietnam-
 ese war dead.
 American is a great and powerful na-
 tion.  She has never shirked her respon-
 sibilities to preserve and protect the prin-
 ciples of freedom and democracy when-
 ever and wherever she has been called
 upon to do so.
 There are, however, other nations,
 though not possessed of the industrial
 and military might of the United States,
 who feel a deep sense of responsibility to
 those peoples who lack the blessings of
 liberty and human freedom.
 Mr. Speaker, I wish to call particular
 attention to the economic and military
 assistance being provided in Vietnam by
 the Commonwealth of Australia.
 I know that our combat units in Viet-
 nam are happy to have the cooperation
 and support of the courageous, gallant
 and experienced Australian troops.  It is
 good to know that some of our friends
 around the world understand the reasons
 for our involvement in Vietnam.
 Australia is a nation which has faced
 aggression, invasion and the loss of free-
 dom and liberty before. ' She knows the
 cost of peace, and she is willing to pay
 the price to preserve that peace both
 for herself and her neighbors.
 Mr. Speaker, the June 1 edition of the
 Australian News, published by the Aus-
 tralian News and Information Bureau,
 contains a very interesting commentary
 by the Australian Minister of External
 Affairs, Mr. Paul Hasluck, on Australia's
 position with regard to Vietnam and the
 Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.  I
 commend this article to the study of the
 members of the House.
 The following are pertinent excerpts
 from the Australian News:
 AUSTRALIAN EXTERNAL AFFAIRS  MINISTER SETS
 OUT VIEWS ON RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VIET-
 NAM POLICY AND SEATO MEMBERSHIP
 The Australian Minister for External Af-
 fairs, Mr. Paul Hasluck, has spoken of Aus-
 tralia's actions in Vietnam and their rela-
 tionship  to  the  South-East  Asia  Treaty
 Organization. In a statement released yes-
 terday, Mr. Hasluck said that because ques-
 tions continued to be asked on this subject
 he was recapitulating the Government's at-
 titude and policy.
 The Minister said that when the SEATO
 Treaty was signed in 1954, its eight members
 designated for the purposes of Article IV
 "the States of Cambodia and Laos and the
 free territory under jurisdiction of the State
 of Vietnam."    This meant that each party
 to  the Treaty  recognized that aggression
 against  South  Vietnam  by  armed  attack
 would endanger its own peace and safety and
 each agreed that it would in that event act
 to meet the common danger in accordance
 with its constitutional processes.
 ? "The designation also meant that, if it was
 considered that South Vietnam was threat-
 ened other than by armed attack, the parties
 would consult immediately in order to agree
 on the measures which should be taken for
 the  common  defence,"  Mr.  Hasluck said.
 "Article IV also states that it is understood
 that no action on the territory of a desig-
 nated State should be taken except at the
 invitation or with the consent of the Gov-
 ernment  concerned.   The                                                                                                                                              objectives   of
 SEATO are those which the Australian Gov-
 ernment has been steadily pursuing for many
 years.
 "That was why, 12 years ago, we worked
 hard to have SEATO created, and to have
 South Vietnam designated by protocol.  It
 would be wrong to say that the Australian
 Government  is  acting  today  in Vietnam
 solely because it is obliged to do so under
 SEATO.  Even if SEATO did not exist, Aus-
 tralia would want to see communist aggres-
 sion deterred and resisted in the region of
 South and South-East Asia.
 "SEATO helps to deter and resist aggres-
 sion.  SEATO is an agreement and a working
 practical arrangement which Australia ad-
 heres to and observes in pursuit of our awn
 interests and policies.  Our actions in SEATO
 are in pursuance of our obligations through
 SEATO but are not because of SEATO alone.
 The Treaty does not itself lay down the de-
 tails of action to be taken to meet a threat
 or an act of aggression.  The members meet
 together as required to discuss situations and
 possible courses of action.
 "Unanimity of all SEATO members is nec-
 essary for the designation of South Vietnam
 by protocol and this was agreed unanimously.
 But unanimity is not required for every ac-
 tion by each member State in playing-its
 part in SEATO.  Possible action by SEATO
 members is not limited, under the Treaty
 or otherwise, to collective action.  Obliga-
 tions under the Treaty are separate as well
 as joint,. and members have to make their
 separate judgements.
 ."In the absence of a collective decision-
 Which in the question of Vietnam has not
 been sought-each State decides for itself
 what it will do.  Australia decided initially,
 in 1954, to contribute to the stability and
 development of the Republic of Vietnam by
 economic assistance.   Such assistance has
 continued ever since.  Then, as Vietcong in-
 surrection, sabotage, and terrorism sought
 to disrupt the administration and economy
 of South Vietnam and to destroy it,  the
 Australian Government gave additional and
 new forms of assistance-for example, mili-
 tary advisers.  When the situation worsened,
 with more blatant and large-scale  armed
 intervention from   North   Vietnam  the
 Australian Government increased its assist-
 ance yet further and provided combat forces.
 "The form of our response to the threat to
 South  Vietnam  was   not  determined by
 SEATO.  It was for Australia to decide for
 itself the nature and size of the action we
 took. Other coutries, more remote or perhaps
 feeling themselves less directly threatened
 or less able to assist others, might have taken
 a different view. But the Australian Govern-
 ment considered that the situation called for
 assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Vietnam
 against aggression, and that it was in our
 national interest and within our national
 capacity to do no less than we are doing
 now .

 sure that we are not working at cross pur-
 poses.         We still need an Office of Commu-
 nity Development.
 Every Member of Congress and every Sen-
 ator has seen the problems faced by com-
 munities in their efforts to deal with the
 federal government.  Not only must an offi-
 cial go from the Department to Department
 in search of information, but he must also
 frequently go from bureau to bureau within
 those departments.   The agencies do little
 to ease the burdens of these local officials.
 Recently, my office collected the informa-
 tion and application forms needed by urban
 officials to apply for federal grants or loans.
 The size of the pile is staggering.  The com-
 munity applying for a senior citizens hous-
 ing project, for example, must wade its way
 through a fact sheet on the program, the
 regulations governing its administration, an
 explanation of the form that must he sub-
 mitted to assure compliance with the regula-
 tions, the assurance of compliance form, an-
 other explanation of the form for the loan,
 and the loan form itself, a pamphlet on
 guides for project design, a supplemental
 information sheet, information on fallout
 shelter requirements, instructions on how to
 apply for organizational and development
 expenses, and model forms of incorporation
 and bylaws.  Then we come to the supple-
 mental forms: the statement of housing de-
 mand, the official certification of authority,
 the statement of community interest, proj-
 ect characteristics data, engineering data,
 site data, financial data, legal data-all this
 for a single program!  We also found that
 the manuals and materials needed by a com-
 munity to file an application for a Head
 Start program under the Office of Economic
 Opportunity  weighed   51/Z  pounds!  Fur-
 thermore the economic' data required is not
 systematic or uniform. Similar but related
 calculations must be performed over and
 over again.
 But if the Executive Branch, has failed in
 its responsibilities for coordination, the Con-
 gress has done little better.  At the present
 time, there are no less than eight standing
 committees of the House of Representatives
 with jurisdiction over urban programs. The
 Committees  on  Agriculture, Banking  and
 Currency, the District of Columbia, Educa-
 tion         and Labor,  Government Operations,
 Judiciary, Interstate and Foreign Commerce
 and Public Works all have significant areas
 of jurisdiction over urban problems. Given
 this wide dispersal of authority, coordina-
 tion is practically impossible.  In some in-
 stances our Committees may even be work-
 ing at cross purposes.  For example, while
 the Public Works Committee is considering
 legisla ion to build more highways to bring
 cars infb the central city, the Housing Sub-
 committee of the House Banking and Cur-
 rency Committee may be working on mass
 transit legislation designed to keep the cars
 out.
 Water pollution is another example.  The
 Banking and Currency Committee has juris-
 diction over programs funded by the Com-
 munity Facilities Administration of the De-
 partment of Housing and Urban Development
 for new sewage systems, while the Public
 Works Committee has jurisdiction over water
 pollution control programs, which funds the
 construction of water treatment facilities.
 The relationship between these two urban
 functions Is far closer in fact than this jur-
 isdictional arrangement would suggest.  The
 present system makes it impossible to con-
 sider the interrelationships between housing
 and education, between transportation and
 pollution, or between highways and open
 spaces.
 The wise response to this confused situa-
 tion would be to create a Committee of the
 House of Representatives on Urban Affairs.

 Salute to Republic of the Philippines
 Independence Anniversary
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ADAM C. POWELL
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, June 9, 1966
 Mr. POWELL. Mr. Speaker, on June
 12, the people of the Philippine Republic
 will celebrate their, independence anni-
 versary.         I am proud to extend my con-
 gratulations and warm felicitations to
 His Excellency Ferdinand E. Marcos,
 President of the Philippines; and to His
 Excellency Oscar Ledesma, the Philip-
 pine Ambassador to the United States.
 The Republic has always been a source
 of inspiration to me because since it was
 granted its freedom from the United
 States in 1946 the Filipino people have
 upheld the faith and hope that we in
 America had in them.  They have also
 remained in high esteem as trusted
 friends of the American people:  The
 dedication and hard work and sacrifice
 of such famous Filipino heroes as Emilio
 Aguinaldo, Manuel Luiz Quezon, Sergio
 Osmefia, and Ramon Magsaysay have
 borne fruit in a thriving and prosperous
 Philippine Republic.
 During the Spanish-American War the
 United States gained control over the
 Philippines. It was long our intention to
 encourage the growth of truly demo-
 cratic institutions and popular govern-
 ment in  the  territory.  The  people
 learned their lesson well, and on July 4,
 1946, our beloved stars and stripes were
 lowered and the flag of the independent
 and sovereign Philippine Republic was
 hoisted.  The Republic now recognizes
 June 12 as its independence anniversary,
 and each yearly celebration finds the
 people that much richer and fuller in
 the experience of directing their own
 affairs.
 America and the Philippines have long
 enjoyed warm relations and those ties
 haveydrawn even closer as a result of
 fighting together against the Japanese
 during World War II and against the
 Communist _forces in Korea.  Stability
 in areas such as southeast Asia depends
 largely on the success or lack thereof
 registered by countries like the Philip-
 pines.         It is my fervent hope that the
 Philippines, entering a new year of in-
 dependence, will continue to register the
 achievement and progress it so earnestly
 seeks.
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, June 9, 1966
 Mr. KEOGH.  Mr. Speaker, under
 leave to extend my remarks in the REC-
 oiiD, I include the following article from
 the Rome Daily American of June 2,
 1966, with reference to Hon. James A.
 Farley, chairman of the board of the
 Coca-Cola Export Corp.:
 STILL A GREAT BIG WONDERFUL WORLD
 (By Ernest Cuneo)
 NEW YORK,-Big Jim Farley was 78 years
 old this week.  He celebrated it with his usual
 78-hour week.  Since his last birthday, he
 has attended 125 dinners and 70 luncheons
 at many of which he was principal speaker.
 He also traveled 60,000 miles by land, sea,
 and air, visiting 20 countries, including all
 European capitals, all Central American capi-
 tals, and the principal cities of Mexico.
 He reads the box scores of every major
 league ball game-without glasses-as part
 of his habit of reading at least four news-
 papers every day.
 He is 6-feet 3-inches tall, literally in the
 well-known pink, and his 205 pounds haven't
 varied in the last 20 years.
 He has a most peculiar walk, one of very
 quick and very short steps.  His towering
 figure seems to scoot through the New York
 winds, in spite of the fact that he is inter-
 rupted every 10 paces by someone who wants
 to shake his hand.  Perhaps no man since
 Daniel Webster's Boston has so much re-
 ceived the adulation of a city.
 New Yorkers give him the respect accorded
 Al Smith and the affection bestowed of Jim-
 my Walker.
 There is an astonishing simplicity about
 this most sophisticated of men.  He still has
 the clean wholesomeness of the lanky coun-
 try boy who played first base for the town
 team 60 years ago.  He brought this same
 zest to nnlltlac
 The Democratic Party was his team, and
 he gave it all he had.
 From 8 a.m. every morning till six at night,
 he's in there pitching for his current team,
 Coca-Cola export.  He's head of it, but he
 puts on no airs.   He calls himself a salesman,
 and sell he does.
 His  office  is    crowded  with  affectionate
 greetings from popes to presidents, and from
 mail-carriers to matadors. All look as pleased
 as if they had just paused to refresh.
 The Hudson River was brimming with the
 melting snows of the Great Blizzard of 1888
 when Jim Parley uttered his birth-cry.  As
 Damon Runyon would have said, it's 8 to 5
 it was a shout of joy at being alive.
 His enthusiasm has mounted ever since.
 All of humanity is his team, and he's glad to
 be on it.  He not only likes people; he relishes
 them.
 Jim  was  the  second  of  five  boys.  His
 father was a Hudson River schooner captain,
 sailing bricks down to New York City.   He
 prospered.  He bought two small brickyards.
 But just before Jim was 10, his father went
 out to harness the horse to go to a neighbor's
 funeral.   The halter was long, the horse
 frisky.
 till a Great Bi

 tnat it is a source of never-ending wonder
 to Jim that men will drink whiskey, when a
 bottle of you-know-what is immediately at
 hand.
 For the sake of his friends, the company
 should put out a double-strength Farley-
 sized pinch bottle for men who need brac-
 ing as well as a pause.
 Jim wanted to be town clerk.  An Irish-
 American Catholic Democrat stood as much
 chance in the rock-ribbed Republican town
 of Grassy Point then as Mao Tse-tung stands
 of being elected governor of Utah now.
 But Jim took to the mails.  Apparently,
 Republicans like to receive letters because
 they elected him.
 This started  the most unbelievable ro-
 mance in history between Jim Parley and
 the U.S. mails. He became postmaster-gen-
 eral of the United States, then practically
 a concomitant of being chairman of the
 Democratic  National  Committee.  He  de-
 served it as its chief customer alone.
 Being at the head of the Post Office De-
 partment did not soothe his letter-writing
 propensities; it inflamed them.   Following
 the 1932 campaign, he signed 22,000 first-
 name letters of thanks; in 1936, 27,000,                                                                                                                                And
 not when he got around to it; immediately.
 Within a week after election, there were
 27,000 families in thousands of cities and
 villages  proudly  exhibiting  the  letters of

 bulled moving expenses. Since that date
 30 of my colleagues have joined in sup-
 port of this legislation and have intro-
 duced similar measures to correct the in-
 equity created by the Internal Revenue
 Rul131g 54-429.
 Following is an article taken from the
 Wall Street Journal of June 8, 1966,
 which I believe points out the ` impor-
 tance of this legislation:
 A TAX ON FLEXIBILITY
 With so much headline-catching legisla-
 tion in Congress, few people are likely to pay
 much attention to a pending bill to liberalize
 tax treatment of employees' moving expenses.
 That's unfortunate, since the present rules
 are not only unfair to individuals and com-
 panies but to some extent are even lessening
 the' economy's ability to adjust to change.
 Under present regulations an employe can
 exclude from his taxable income only the
 actual amount his employer pays to move
 him, his family and his possessions to a job
 in another city.  If his company, prior to the
 actual move, finances a house-hunting trip
 or arranges a hotel room for a few days until
 he can find a new home, he must report these
 and any similar outlays as income on his tax
 'return.
 The unfairness of this approach is clear
 to anyone who ever has been moved from one
 city to another by his employer.  A trans-
 ferred employe can avoid a house-hunt, for
 example, only by quitting his job or by re-
 fusing to move, which in some cases may
 amount to the same thing.
 Some companies get around the problem
 by paying an about-to-move employe an al-
 lowance over and above his necessary ex-
 penses, just to cover his taxes.  But smaller
 or less prosperous firms can't always afford
 to be so generous. The present procedure, in
 other words, discriminates in favor of big,
 thriving businesses-a rather unusual atti-
 tude for Washington,
 k The impact of the current rules cannot be
 measured precisely.  Yet some employes un-
 questionably have become more reluctant to
 move, and some companies are either less
 willing or able to make the most productive
 use of their staffs.
 Aware of the difficulties, bipartisan groups
 in both houses of Congress have introduced
 corrective legislation.  Even if the bill can
 find its way to the top of a crowded Congres-
 sional, calendar, though, it still faces the
 Treasry's opposition to tax measures in-
 volving a potential loss of a bit of revenue.
 As a matter of fact, this tax on the econ-
 omy's flexibility may be costing more in rev-
 enue than its repeal would lose.  However
 that may be, no argument-financial or oth-
 erwise-is strong enough to sustain so ob-
 vious an inequity.
 In confirmation of the above remarks,
 I would also like to include excerpts
 from letters now on file in my office re-
 ceived from individuals from all parts
 of the country citing their own personal
 experiences and losses incurred by com-
 pany moves:
 similar duties in the New York City area.
 A rough estimate of my presently taxable
 expenses incidental to the sale of my present
 home, purchase of a new one, etc. Is about
 $5,500.00.. Since these reimbursements are
 treated as personal income and subjected to
 the maximum tax percentage in my income
 bracket,  my  transfer will  cost  me  about
 $1,600.00."
 "It is estimated that my transfer to Chi-
 cago will cost approximately $2,000 additional
 income tax on monies the Company reim-
 bursed me for commission on my house sale
 and other related cost of moving.  It takes
 a sizable promotional. increase to be able to
 recapture $2,000 worth of-income tax, which
 in my opinion was not really income to me
 but just reimbursement of expenses I in-
 curred due to this move."
 Listed above are only a few of the
 many examples brought to my attention
 during the past few months.  Recent
 surveys indicate that annually 150,000
 persons employed by private industry;
 35,000 persons employed by the Federal
 Government and 340,000 persons trans-
 ferred by the Armed Services are affected
 financially by the present ruling.
 I wish to thank those of my colleagues
 who have joined with me in sponsoring
 this remedial legislation and respectfully
 urge the support and efforts of all Mem-
 bers of Congress in the enactment of this
 bill.
 Chicago Rebuilds  Loop Area  Under
 Leadership of Mayor Daley
 CHANGING CHICAGO: AN "UNBELIEVABLE CITY"
 (By Alver Carlson)
 CHICAGO: "This unbelievable city can only
 be described as an architectural laboratory.
 When I return home, and am asked what I
 saw in America, I will say I saw Chicago."
 This statement, made last week by a young
 Dutch  journalist on tour throughout the
 United States on a university fellowship, was
 perhaps a bit overblown.
 But Chicago today, despite its weaknesses,
 is a city with a face that has changed more
 in the last eight years than at any time
 since Mrs. O'Leary's cow put her foot down.
 The most recent major building announce-
 ment gives a key to the pattern which a
 La Salle Street businessman once discribed
 thus:- "It must be different, it must be dra-
 matic, and it must be privately financed."
 YEAR 1969 COMPLETION TARGET
 The                            project,  twin  40-story  towers  on
 Wabash Avenue, will sharply alter the city's
 skyline.                          It is scheduled to be completed by
 1969.
 One structure will be an 800-room hotel.,
 The other will be an office building with
 700,00 square feet of rentable area
 The plans also call for the construction of
 two 10-story parking facilities between the
 two buildings.  Builder John J. Mack esti-
 mated the cost of the complex at $40,000,000.
 But there is more involved.
 Chicago's central city is called the Loop
 after a rapid transit elevated system that
 circles it.  This transit system has made it
 difficult for the area to shift or sprawl.
 With  the  announcement  of  the  twin
 towers, the city said it is studying, with a
 government grant, ways to remove the u.gle
 old "L" structure.  Part of it goes down the
 street where  the   new  buildings  wil rise.
 (Most of the trains which once used the
 "L" tracks now run through two subway
 tubes.)
 The most interesting part of the Loop's
 renewal is that it has been done without a
 single dollar of federal urban renewal aid.
 FEDERAL AID ELSEWHERE
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. FRANK ANNUNZIO
 OF ILLINOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, June 9, 1966
 Mr. ANNUNZIO.  Mr. Speaker, dur-
 ing the past year, many newspapers and
 periodicals throughout our country have
 reported extensively on the giant strides
 that Chicago is making toward eliminat-
 ing its slums, improving its highways,
 and rebuilding the loop area, which I
 have the honor to represent in the
 Congress.
 Under the bold and dedicated leader-
 ship of Hon. Richard J. Daley, mayor of
 our city of Chicago, tremendous strides
 have been made and much has been
 accomplished.
 What is not a commonly known fact,
 however, is that the rebuilding of the
 inner loop area has been accomplished
 without a single dollar of Federal urban
 renewal aid. In other major cities, such
 as New York and Philadelphia, more
 than two-thirds of the money spent for
 rebuilding portions of the central city
 came from Federal grants.  Chicago,
 instead, has used only private funds for
 In the years between 1958 and 1985 the
 district saw completion of $297,000,000 worth
 of office buildings with another $117,500,000
 under construction.  Civic and public build-
 ings  accounted  for                                                                                                                                      another  $103,710,000,
 with $53,840,000 worth of such construction
 under way.
 Total construction   figures  that  include
 stores, hotels and motels, and garages, show
 that an estimated $1 billion worth has been
 completed, is under way, or has been an-
 nounced since 1958.                                                                                                                                          This is an area under
 100 acres.

 Philadelphia,  Baltimore,  Washington,  Bos-
 ton, Cleveland, St. Louis, Denver, San Fran-
 cisco,  and  other  cities                                                                                                                                        two-thirds  of the
 money used to tear down and rebuild por-
 tions of their central areas came from fed-
 eral grants, according to sources here.
 The national spotlight focused on their
 Charles Centers and Penn Centers, and vir-
 tually ignored the Chicago approach that
 was achieving the same result.
 While, this city was certainly in favor of
 federal aid, it preferred to concentrate use
 of the funds on the slums that surrounded
 the Loop, which had been spreading ten-
 tacles of despair into the central city itself.

 When Prime Minister Ky talks about
 elections in South Vietnam, he is in fact
 not talking about fair elections. It is re-
 ported that a condition laid down Is that
 no member of the National Liberation
 Front may vote. Also, he has laid down
 the condition that no neutralist may
 vote. He is rigging the elections before
 making any definite plans for such elec-
 tions.  The International Control Com-
 mission, consisting of representatives of
 Poland, India, and Canada, set up in the
 Geneva agreements, is without a doubt
 the best body to supervise any elections
 If they are willing to undertake the task.
 In the search for peace we should seek
 immediate deescalation of the war. Our
 first step should be to halt the bombings
 of North Vietnam and to offer to nego-
 tiate for settlement if representatives of
 Hanoi agree to consider a conference on
 the basis that delegates representing the
 four parties involved in this Vietnam
 civil war participate.  There should be
 no objection on our part for the Hanoi
 and Saigon governments to be repre-
 sented by the same number of delegates
 and these delegates to meet with an iden-
 tical number of delegates representing
 the  Vietcong,  or National Liberation
 Front, and the United States.  Such a
 conference should be arranged to con-
 vene in some Asiatic city.
 Without a doubt, no armistice agree-
 ment could be successful and binding
 except with the support of international
 guarantees through the reconvening of
 the Geneva conference or under the au-
 thority of the International Control
 Commission. 'A drawback, perhaps, to
 having international guarantees super-
 vised through the United Nations is that
 to this good hour Communist China has
 not been admitted into the United Na-
 tions.    -
 This administration certainly should
 take the initiative in sounding out lead-
 ers of Asiatic nations regarding some
 realistic method of ending this blood-
 shed. For every Vietcong who has been
 killed and for every soldier of the so-
 called friendly forces of Vietnam, ARVN,
 undoubtedly more civilians-men, wom-
 en, and children-have been killed, many
 by, our napalm bombing.  It has been
 estimated that four times as many ci-
 vilians have had their lives snuffed out
 Approved
 Truth, as U Thant once observed, is one of
 the first victims of war.  His words were con-
 firmed once again this week as Secretary of
 State Rusk and Vice President  HUMPIiREY
 once again proclaimed the Administration's
 dedication to the search for peace in Viet
 Nam.  Mr. Rusk repeated his offer to go to
 Geneva whenever anybody was there to nego-
 tiate with.  Mr. HUMPI1REY detailed anew the
 various peace offensives of the past and de-
 voutly adopted U Thant's "prayer and wish"
 for peace as our own.
 What is the simple truth?  It is that the
 Administration spurned peace talk feelers re-
 peatedly in 1964 and  1965.                                                                           It is that U
 Thant's own efforts to arrange talks have
 been repeatedly and roughly rejected.  It is
 that while publicly taking no sides in South
 Viet Nam's political turmoil the Administra-
 tion has thrown every resource into the un-
 dercover support of a Saigon military junta
 whose first article of faith is an utter rejec-
 tion of peace negotiations,  It is that while
 paying lip-service to U Thant's "prayer and
 wish" the Administration obstinately refuses
 to heed U Thant's realistic counsel on the
 steps necessary to make peace.
 The Secretary General of the UN renewed
 that counsel in his moving address to the
 Amalgamated Clothing Workers this week.
 Military methods, he said, will not restore
 peace; President Johnson once agreed with
 that. ( "This war must be stopped," said U
 Thant, "on the initiative of the participants,
 lest it get out of hand.   And he repeated
 what he has often said, that the necessary
 conditions for peace include a return to the
 Geneva agreements, which were based on the
 principle -of military neutralization of all
 Viet Nam; a prior scaling down of military
 operations (which would include an end to
 the bombing of North Viet Nam) ; and an
 agreement to negotiate with the actual com-
 batants-in other words, the National Liber-
 ation Front as well as North Viet Nam.
 These steps are reasonable if peace is gen-
 uinely the objective.  So long as the United
 States rejects U Thant's counsel, which ex-
 presses the conscience of the world organi-
 zation to which We so often pay verbal trib-
 ute, our verbal reiteration of peaceful inten-
 tions will fall on unbelieving ears through-
 out the world.
 Some Americans, in bitter frustration, feel
 that the strands of history have become so
 hopelessly entangled that nothing can now
 be done to unravel an unwanted war.  This
 seems plausible only in the context of the
 Administration's present policy, which is to
 back the Ky government's violent suppres-
 sion of popular yearnings for peace and to
 continue escalation of the war.
 If the basic decision were made to accept
 a negotiated settlement instead of chasing

 the illusion of military victory; If we sup-
 ported the Viet Namese forces that favor
 reconciliation, rather than an armed dicta-
 torship which opposes it; if we adopted as
 our policy the  establishment of a  com-
 promise, neutral government permitting our
 ultimate withdrawal, instead of trying to
 establish  an  anti-Communist government
 that could only exist under our permanent
 military protection-in this context, many
 doors to peace and mediation would open.
 No vital national Interest of ours keeps
 the doors closed.  It is pride and arrogance
 and illusion-the illusion that we are en-
 gaged In a holy ideological war.  U Thant is
 right in saying that the somber course of
 events has probably left to the Viet Namese
 people no Ideology at all except a passion for
 national identity or even survival.  He is
 right in saying that no government or peo-
 ple is "likely to lose in stature or dignity or
 Worldly advantage" from coming to terms
 with the world In which we actually live.
 He is right in calling upon those who have
 the power and the responsibility "to- search
 objectively and without rancor for ways to
 end this historic tragedy."
 RESIDUAL OIL QUOTAS
 Mr. PASTORE.  Mr. President, I am
 in receipt of a letter from the New Eng-
 land Council under date of May 31, 1966,
 which I think will be of considerable
 interest to my fellow Senators who have
 been concerned with the residual oil
 quota situation over the past several
 years.
 The letter reads as follows:
 THE NEW ENGLAND COUNCIL,
 Washington, D.C., May 31,1966.
 HOn. JOHN 0. PASTORE,
 U.S. Senate,                                         '
 New Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR   SENATOR   PASTORS:   You   will   be
 pleased to know that directly as a result
 of your efforts in securing removal of resid-
 ual oil quotas last month, the cost of resid-
 ual oil to the consumer in New England has
 been restored to normal levels.
 Quotations last week were down 35 cents
 a barrel from the period immediately be-
 fore quotas were removed.  There is now
 little, if any, difference between the world
 market price and the price charged to the
 New England consumer,   In other words,
 the premium which the controls and the
 ticket system had added to the price of oil
 has disappeared,
 it  was our contention  while  the rigid
 quotas  were  in  existence that the  New
 England consumer was paying at least a 30
 cent per barrel   premium because of the
 controls. It would appear that this was a
 conservative estimate.  Based upon our ex-
 perience with what has happened over the
 past several weeks, it is reasonable to pro-
 ject that New England consumers will be
 saved over $30 million this year alone.
 You certainly have reason to be proud of
 this accomplishment.
 Beat personal regards.
 Sincerely yours,
 COLSON,
 I do not think that this credit belongs
 to me. I do not think that this credit
 belongs to any group of individuals.  I
 think It belongs to everyone who has
 been in this fight, particularly the Sec-
 retary of the Interior, Stewart Udall,
 who has been in the vanguard of this
 crusade, and his brilliant assistant, J.
 Cordell Moore, Assistant Secretary of the
 Interior.
