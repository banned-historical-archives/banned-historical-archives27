 During the period 10-20 January 1952 the Chinese Communist radio programs beamed to the home
 audience reflected a marked intensification of the drive to eliminate waste, corruption and
 bureaucracy, with the original aim of increasing production seldom mentioned.  The Peking
 radio and virtually all regional stations broadcast daily reports of meetings called to
 push the drive.  Some of the meetings were local, on the city or Chu level, while some were
 province-wide,   Most of them were called by Government units or Communist Party Committees.
 Many areas moved into what was spoken of as the second stage of the drive--the confession-
 and-accusation stage.  People of all circles were admonished to first confess their own
 shortcomings, then report waste, corruption, and bureaucracy in all offices and business
 firms,  At confessional meetings an old-fashioned revival atmosphere prevailed, with
 cadres and business n lined up waiting to confess their wastefull and corrupt practices.
 At one meeting it was reported that a third of those present made confessions..  All were
 warned to confess if they wished leniency, and numerous cases of punishment when victims
 refused to confess were listed.  As refusal to confess seemed to be a worse affront than
 the actual corrupt practice,' there is a suspicion that many confessed simply to get free
 of the subject under discussion. Many cases of graft, tax evasion and other corrupt
 practices were broadcast, with names and figures.  Some claims were made of successful

 economic measures, along with a limited number of admissions of weakness and failure.
 Though the  antiwaste and  anticorruption drive overshadowed all other subjects, the
 need for though-6 reform in the 6chools, churches and industrial plants received some
 stress., with the winter school program for adults both praised and criticized.  Enforce-
 ment of the marriage law, land reform, and problems facing agriculture received consider-
 able attention, with reports of severe punishment meted out to landlords.  The number
 of counterrevolutionary acts, and number of counterrevolutionaries arrested and punished,
 showed only a slight increase, but several cases of summary execution following a public
 trial were broadcast.  Claims of progress in gaining the cooperation of the national
 minorities were made, especially in Sikang, where the Tibetans were pictured as anxious
 to aid the Chinese A`ywhich invaded Tibet, and where minority groups were said to be
 enthusiastic about delivei  g grain to the Government and watching propaganda
 Steps to implement preferential treatment for Army dependents    i   the spring gracuas
 festival were reported from all parts of China., butsevere criticism of te lag in
 preferential treatment work came from the Dairen radio,  Among the interesting new
 miscellaneous items were reports of suffering and necessary relief measures 'because
 of floods and the spread of the. hoof and mouth disease., and reports of violent conflict
 between employers and employees.
 ANTIWASTE,, ANTICORRUPTION, ANIIBUREAUCR.ACY
 Development of 2Kivea  What started out as a drive to increase production of economic
 goods in China now has 'become a Nation-wide effort to wipe out wasteful and corrupt
 practices in Government offices., industrial plants, retail establishments, and even
 in the Party and its affiliates.  Stress first was placed on the elimination of waste
 as one method of increasing                      defeat of waste and corm t
 immediate goal Y       ~ production,                                     p  on became the
 with an increase in production seemingly only incidental.  'During the
 period 10-20 January the Chinese radio made only rare mention of increased production,
 while the drive against graft, corr?uption, and illegal business activities was given the
 greatest attention.  Government and Party leaders attacked the,problem with a religious
 fervor which apparently spread to the lower-level cadres and office workers, with the
 result 'that confessions of dishonest and corrupt practices have become eormlonplaee,
 and those who make such confessions are given little punishment, none at all, or
 even praise for confessing,
 Meetings to spur the drive against waste, corruption, and bureaucracy were reported by
 the dozens each day over the regional broadcasting stations.  Government and Party
 officials convened meetings of. cadres on the municipal, hsien  and
 In addition., rallies of busiiiessm~en, industrialists  workers 9wolne npsogro=lps, and
 Youth Corps units were held , On 11 January                                 m?ere   nit
 A cheek on 15 fan                          r"y reports of 25 such. meetings were monitored.
 January revealed a similar number.  At all of these meetings the audiences
 were admonished to `be alert to detect corrupt practices, and report 'the.m to tie
 authorities.Tti make such reporting eas er?9 special. offices were opened and special
 collecti rn boxes installed
 `oochow reported (16 Tan,) that the Fukien Supervisory Committee had set up an
 office at No,, 11 Wenghai Road, Foochow, to receive reports of corruption; but if informers
 did not wish to appear in person, they could send their reports to Post Office Box 405,
 with the Committee paying the postage,  As a further inducement, "informers will be
 given
 a percentage of monies recovered by the Government."'  Wuhsi announced (18 Jan.) that
 the South Kiangsu People's Supervisory Committee had opened an informers' office in
 the Hsinhua Store, Chochan Road, Wutsin, where oral or written. reports would be received
 each day from 8-110O am. and from 1-5-00 p.m, In addition, informers' boxes had
 been set up in Wutsin at the doorway to the Kinghu. Hotels at the gate of the parks
 and at the north end of Nanchiao Bridge,

 Austerity had selected 10 places for boxes:  Tanan. Gate, Hsiaonan Gate, Assembly Hall

 roads.  Yangchow reported (11 Jan.) that in Nantung cadres soon would make personal
 investigations to uncover corruption, and that,, in. the meantime, information could be
 sent through Post Office Box 100,  The same radio said (15 Jan.) that in Su Hsien,
 Kiangsu, inforst boxes had been widely distributed and that collections would be made
 daily.  Hangchow announced (10 Jan,) that the Hangohow Supervisory Committee had opened
 a "People's Informer Guidance Center'! at No, 8 Chuang Yuan Building, Minchung Road, and
 that in Hangchow, Chekiang Governor Han had designated Post Office Box No. 7 for
 informers   The same radio (18 Jan,) said that Chen Li-wei, Deputy Chairman of the
 Hangchow People's Supervisory Committee
 , had established an infor'mers' box at 19 Min
 Cht,an Road, and would personally attend to all reports.
 Wuhan stated (16 Jan,) that the South China Procurator's office had opened an informers'
 booth and had promised to reward and protect all informers.  Canton announced (11 Jana)
 that the Kwangtung Province Procurator's office had set up informers' boxes at the

 Hotel, Taiping Road; the entrance to the city wharves; and on Yunghan.and Tl,nngh.sin.
 Roads,  Also, information could be reported on Phone 13633.
 Mukden armor. ced (12 Jan.) that the Northeast Procurator's Committee had called a
 smear i ~g of procurator-informers to plan for intensifying the reporting of corruption
 and to explain the information net1,work established by the Committee.  Hang,^hcwe said
 (15 Jan.) that police cadres, finding people did not make reports, because of fear of
 reprisal, had organized street committees to emphasize the move.  As a result:  82 reports
 of corruption were received at once by the Hsinmiri Road Police Station,    Yiuhsi said
 (12 Jan.) that Soochow Communist Party Secretary Li Ling had called for an expose of
 all rcorraptionj, but "especially of Party bureaucracy."  Taiyuan reported (17 Jam.)
 that Party cadres were going into the rural, areas to promote the drive..  I` uban
 (20 Jan.) stressed the importance of shop clerks in the drive, "as they know many of the
 corrupt elements in government and trade,"  Chungking reported (10 Jan.) that the `wade
 Bureau of the Southwest China Military and Administrative Committee, the China Food
 CoRmpaw, the Chungking Construction Company, and the Army Service of Supplies had
 published large notices in the daily press, calling on the people to report
 irr?eg''larities and offering to send representatives from the concerns to interview
 those wishing to give information, in addition to promising rewards.  Sian said
 (19 Jan.) that in Sinkiang Province the task of giving emphasis to the drive was
 2gely the responsibility of the People's Liberation A.z  , and that Commander Chen
 Wen in December had called on all units to take up the work.
 FTow,vcr? 1a,_,k of enthusiasm, for the drive against waste and corruption was apparent
 in some quarters.  Shanghai reported (12 Jan.) an emergency, smeeting of local trade
 circles 11 January, at which Party cadres warned businessmen that they must support
 the program, and accused them of using "strong-arm tactics" 'to defraud the Government.
 Wuhan said (18 Jan.) that some merchants were engaged in illegal practices and at the
 same time were disseminating theories aimed at creating a public opinion that would
 conceal their activities and undermine the drive.  Industrialists and merchants were
 waisted that, although they receive less political education than some other groups, they

 are by no means exempt from the common program.
 Sian reported (19 Jan0) that at a 16 January meeting called by the Shensi Government,
 cadres were charged with "suppressin  democratic speech," meaning that they had
 discouraged informers, and merchants were charged with resisting the program.  A second
 meeting of merchants was held the following day,  They were warned that they must change
 their attitude.  Chungking reported (13 Jan.) that the Communist Party Comml.ttee in
 north Szechwan had called a cadre meeting "because of laxity" in the campaign.
 Cadres were ordered to set up an elaborate system of informers' boxes, to organize
 inspection teams, and to "instruct the masses in making accusations e"  Party cadres
 now are checking on the local inspection committees.
 Chinchow announced (20 Jan.) that a meeting of factory and mine cadres had been called
 in Fushun Hsien, Liaosi, because the drive was "not progressing satisfactorily" and
 because laxity was obvious among both old and new cadres.  An earlier 01-;;nohow broadcast
 _(17 Jan,) complained that though the drive had been under way for
 cadres still were lax.  Dairen announced (16 Jan.) that the Peoples s~uperu soryT
 Committee of Dairen-Port Arthur called a meeting 15 January of "inspection
 correspondents~ax  The chairman of the meeting, Hu Chung-Tai, reported that the
 campaign was "meeting with numerous obstacles" and that the inspection. correspondents
 should intensify their work, at first making certain that "they themselves are not
 guilty." Mukden said (14 Jane) that little had been accomplished in Changohun
 because of leading cadres' laxity and ignorance.  The strongest indictment was
 carried in a Dairen broadcast,, quoting the Dairen-Port Arthur People's Consultative
 Council:
 Basically the movement has not begun in the area.  Many organiza-
 tionxs have done absolutely nothing.  The movement is growing only
 spasmodically.  There is nothing worth noting about
 the movement
 ..e  Cadres in the Public Utility Department have given no
 support to the movement and are suppressing democratic informers.
 The masses are frightened and prevented from making accusations....
 Nothing has been done about the movement  in  the Medical Section*
 'the Tax Bureau, and the Shipping Bureau,  The movement already- is
 several months old; why have these organizations not, roused 1.71-
 masses., but instead have left the masses alone? n,.
 _
 indifferent cadres are taking a                           c o ma:
 C a bureaucratic= attitude toward rd rc~ this
 movement.   They have no understanding of the noble spirit of the
 movement ....  Manny cadres are themselves highly corrupt, ~''ur'twau.~eradu1.l`9.   . e e o                                                           v `~   wasteful,
 Yet they are afraid to reform, so they dare
 not, arouse the masses to action e  At the presentt, time this attitude
 has become a serious obstacle to the movement.  These cadres do not
 realize that the antiwaste, anticorruption, antibureaucracy campaign
 is a vitally important step in the building of a new democratic
 society.  They must struggle fiercely with their ideology and
 political consciousness ....  For., if this move is permitted to fail,
 there is great danger of losing the Nation, losing the Party, and
 losing oneself,  The Central and Northeast Party and Government
 offices have repeatedly issued directives to expand this movement.
 As members of the Party, all cadres must give the organization their
 full support e Those who do not do so have shown by their attitude
 that they do not recognize their loyalty to the Party.  (Dairen,
 Dairen-Port Arthur Regional Service, 11 Jan.)
 Wuhan reported (14 Jan.) that 670 Party cadres in the Central and South area met
 with 29000 delegates from various circles under the chairmanship of Governor Yeh
 Chien-ryii g .  in pleading with the cadres not to let the campaign fail, Governor
 Yeh used the same language quoted above from Dairen, to the effect that failure
 would bring a danger of "losing the Nation., losing the Party, and losing oneself."

 Confessions and.Accusations~  The first stage in the antiwaste, anticorruption,
 antibureaucracy drive was a period of study, preparation, and organization.  The
 second is the confession-and-accusation stage. Wuhan announced (12 Jan,) that
 cadres of all circles in Wuhan, after a period of study and indoctrination, were
 prepared to advance to the second stage, when cadres would lead the masses in
 making confessions and accusations.  Wuhan reported (13 Jan.) that the first meeting
 under the second stage was held.  After Hu Feng, Social Affairs Bureau Chief, made his
 plea,  ""50  cadres came forward to make confessions."  Hu Chieh, Chief Procurator,
 then made a confession of his own errors in thinking.  Wuhan announced (14 Jan.)
 that representatives of organizations in Hunan Province and Changsha met to start the
 second stage, and (16 Jan.) that in Hupeh the confession-and-accusation stage had.
 been reached, with four accusation groups organized to inspect all Government offices,
 more than 200 confessions of corrupt practices received, and "some arrests made."
 Shanghai announced (14 Jan.) that the second stage of the drive had been reached in
 Nanking, where the masses were asked to make accusations.  However, leniency or free
 dom from punishment were promised those who confessed their misdeeds.  Businessmen
 in :Nanking immediately reported 500 instances of corruption.  Yangehow reported
 (14 plan.) the second stage had been reached at Taichow and in north Kiangsui.  In the
 north Kiangsu hsien of Huaiyin, Suching, and Furring, Yangchow said (19 Jan.) local
 cadres were leading the masses in confessing their own errors, "so they could make
 accusations.'"  Hofei said (19 Jan.) that the second stage had been reached in
 Arc'aw i Province, where Cheng Ching-fa confessed to a corrupt deal in which he netted
 4,4, million Yuan.  Other announcements that the drive had reached the second stage
 canK- from. Dairen (16 Jan,), Chungking (16 Jan.), Sian (18 Jan.), Kaifeng (19 Jan,),
 and Vuhsi. (20 Jan.) ,
 Businessmen presumably were not as ready in all cities to admit their corrupt
 practices as Shanghai reported they were in Nanking.  Peking in numeral code
 (17 Jan.) quoted from a 15 January editorial in TIENTSIN JIH PAO-   "The City's
 Merchants Should Take Positive Steps to Promote the Movement Against Corruption,
 Tax Evasion, and Misappropriation of Government Property."  The editorial pointed
 out that 50,000 Government employees, students, workers, and the broad masses were
 supporting the movement, that 14,000 cases of tax evasion had been reported by shop
 workers, and that "wives were talking their corrupt husbands into mating public
 confessions."  However, the merchants still were obstruetin, the movement by
 creating the feeling among the masses that it concerned only Party and Government
 cadres.  The editorial emphatically denied the fallacious idea of the merchants that
 ""the program of the People is Democratic United Front has changed.`"  It further pointed
 out that capitalism still has a place if it helps to increase pro'uction and divests
 itself of such feudalistic thoughts as are exemplified in the following quotations:
 "Bribery ' i?as existed since history began; give first if you want to take- officials
 never prosecute bearers of gifts; and, times are hard, business is bad."  The
 editorial stressed, however, that the giving of a cigarette or a cup of tea to a patron
 in only good business and should not be interpreted as bribery, even though the
 patron does happen to be a leading cadre.
 Another numberal code transmission from Peking quoted from a speech by Mayor Huang
 Ching of Tientsin before a confession-and-accusation rally.  Excerpts from the
 speech follow-
 Industrial and co nercial circles still. are gripped b-j selfishness
 and self-interest.  They have often practiced graft to lead our
 cadres toward corruption ,..,  Tax Bureau cadre and People's
 Liberation Army combatant Wed ang Shih-li was an unspoiled young man
 when he first joined the Tax Bureau, before the wicked merchants
 ruined him by vicious means ....  Please think for a moment,  Have
 you not netted some profit during the past 3 years?  You can
 develop your business and make money without practicing graft, tax
 evasion, or other fraudulent acts ....  It is a plain fact that
 you have made more profit than during the Japanese or Kuomintang

 which have a direct bearing on the people's livelihood, and
 let you develop, for your own benefit, other enterprises ....
 The Government has extended you loans when you needed money,
 distributed raw materials when yours ran short, and purchased yatir
 unmarketable goods ....  Some businessmen still are not satisfied
 with what the Government and fellow workers have done for their
 benefit, despite their mounting profits, and have engaged in
 various lawless activities .... We must rise to catch those
 thieves and robbers       We must expose such rumors as,  You
 are not allowed to eat good food or wear good clothes; we are
 not allowed to entertain or send gifts to friends; we cannot eat
 white noodles or fried vegetables; we are not allowed to permanent-

 seeks to interfere with people's private lives or their social
 engagements  ..,  To prevent unwise spending among Government
 cadres does not dean to lower their standard of living.  (Peking,
 numeral code, 18 Jan.)

 announced (16 Jan.) that 5.57 million catties of food stored in six warehouses of the
 1-?shan Foodstuff Company, Kwangsi, deteriorated because of heat, worms and fermentation,

 irresponsibility of the cadres.  Hofei reported (13 Jan.) that the China Foodstuffs
 Company and the Public Safety office in Hsuan?cheng Hsien, Anhwei, lost 200,000
 catties of rice because they "'blindly trusted" a private foodstuffs company called Tien

 Claims of Success.  Among the relatively small number of econs nic gains claimed by
 the Chinese Communist radio, some are accredited to improved personal relations in the
 factories, some to adoption of Soviet methods, and the remainder to changes and

 Canton claimed (10 Jan,) that production had increased greatly in the Kwangtung
 Rubber Shoe Factory after "feudalistic elements in the factory were destroyed by
 democratic reforms,"  Wuhsi said (10 Jan.) that a great; improvement had been noted
 in the accomplishments of the 2,000 Shiyehan transport workers "since elimination of the

 ing dye fluid wastes" which "had 'been suppressed for one year o" Mukden announced
 (10 Jags) 'that the Mukden Comml_ iist Party had called a meeting of factory authorities
 to "popularize the multi-knife metal-cutting device."
 IDEOLOGICAL, ADJUSTt ENTS
 Schools and `Teachers,  Thought reform was largely neglected because of the heavy
 emphasis on the anti waste, anti-corruption, anti-bureaucracy drive, attention was given to schools and teachers, with the emphasis on teachersvinghigher

 Peking's home service network announced (20 Jan,) that the Central Government
 Administrative Council had approved a directive raising the pay of primary school
 teachers.  Peking in numeral code (16 Jan.) quoted from CHINA YOUTH on thought reform
 in the schools.,- Some significant quotations from the article follow-
 It is impractical to carry out the thought struggle impulsively
 if circumstances still are not matured for such a movement.  In
 broadening the thought struggle among schools, it is necessary
 to avoid letting it become a form without substance ....  Youth
 Corps camittees and student associations in each university should,
 under the leadership of the Party, endeavor to understand the
 trend of thinking among the students and settle related problems
 That the thought, struggle should become a far-reaching movement
 among primary and middle schools and in the cities is a wrong
 attitude ?a     Patriotic education among the middle schools
 hinges on the thought reform of the teachers.  (Peking,
 Numeral Code, 16 Jan.)

 Wuhan reported (18 Jan.) that the Kwangsi Province People's Court reviewed one
 marriage law case "upon the demand of the people and orders of the Central and South
 People's Court."  When the case was reopened, Ho Teh-chung, Laiping Hsien, accused
 of causing the suicide of his wife, Pan Tse-lai, was given a long jail sentence
 His land reform ;padre accomplice, Liang Yu-keh, was given a one-year sentence in
 place of the original 6 months.  Chinchow reported (14 Jan.) that cadres had been
 sent into the villages of Faku Khien, Liaosi, to explain the marriage law, "as many
 feudalistic cases were found to exist."  Older people at first refused to accept the
 law, but were enthusiastic after indoctrination.
 Foochow complained (20 Jan.) that many peasants still do not understand the significance
 of the economic advantages of the new marriage system.  Therefore all leading cadres
 in the chu and hsien were ordered to step up publicity in such a way as to lead the
 peasants to invest in increased agricultural production the money saved on marriage
 ceremonies.  Nanchang said (20 Jan,) that in Wanshou Hsiang, Yukan Hsien, Kiangsi,
 there was aT y a vague understanding of the marriage law, and little attention was
 paid to it.  Divorces were illegally hindered, and the parents of one 16-year-old
 youth secretly arranged his marriage in violation of the law.  All local governments
 in Kiangsi were warned to take action against violations.
 Land Ref"orx n Wuhan announced (11 Jan,) that the land reform program in Kwangsi
 Province would be brought to a close at the end of the month with completely success-
 ful results and the final overthrow of feudalistic landlords.              The broadcast added
 that a landlord in Hsiang 16, Chu 14, Lo Jung Hsien, had been arrested and his 20 guns
 and 10,000 rounds of a mr"xnition confiscated.
 Nanchang announced (19 Jan.) that Militia Captain Fan Yu-sheng, Kuxigping Hsiang, had
 exposed local landlord Pan Chung-tao, who had hidden his wealth.  As a result, a
 campaign to expose landlords was being revived in rural areas "where landlords
 supposedly were liquidated.'"  On 22 December farmers in the Seventh Chu, Nanchang
 Hsien, Kiangsi, held a struggle rally against local landlords.  Landlord Yen Mi-ling
 was accused by his son of oppressing peasants.
