 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 SUMMIT CONFERENCE DEVELOPMENTS            . .  .  . .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  Page  1
 Foreign Minister Molotov, in public and private state-
 ments at Sam Francisco, emphasized that the summit confer-
 ence should, in addition to considering closely-linked
 issues of European security and disarmament, arrange for
 a. world economic conference and a conference on Far Eastern
 matters.   He did nothing to counteract the growing impres-
 sion that the USSR would avoid the German issue at Geneva.
 Another Soviet official, however, privately claimed that
 Moscow now was prepared to agree to free all-German elec-
 tions.
 AFGHAN-PAKISTANI SITUATION  .  .  .
 .    .  .  Page  2
 Afghan prime minister Daud's abrupt rejection of
 Pakistan's latest conciliatory communication regarding
 settlement of the dispute over the Kabul riots seems to
 have touched off another effort on the part of the Afghan
 royal family to remove Daud from office.
 IPakistan has released infor-
 mation to the press t a.t                                            is preparing to close the
 Afghan border and break off diplomatic relations.
 INDONESIAN CRISIS .  .  .  .  .     .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  3
 A political-military crisis in Indonesia has resulted
 from army opposition to the installation on 27 June of Gen-
 eral Utoyo as the new chief of staff.   The motion of no
 .confidence directed against the pro-Communist defense min-
 ister which was introduced in parliament on 29 June may
 lead to a cabinet reshuffle or a  cabinet collapse.   In
 the latter event, President Sukarno, who for the first
 time finds himself challenged by the army and parliament,
 might appoint a. caretaker cabinet, responsible to him
 rather than to parliament, to govern until a new cabinet
 could be formed after the elections in September.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 The Formosa, Straits--Military and Political:   Two Nation-
 alist p a.nes were Intercepted by patrblli.pg.-Commurii4t
 jets on 27 June.       The Communists, in their military
 operations, however, have been careful not to preju-
 dice the prospects of Sino-American negotiations.
 Peiping, periodically announcing that the "question
 now rests with the United States," appears still to
 be a.waiting.reports from intermediaries.
 .  Page  I
 Soviet-Japanese Talks:   The position taken by Soviet dele-
 gate ma,lik in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations in
 London suggests that the USSR is still withholding
 concessions in the hope that Japan will make pro-
 posals which can be used as a. basis for bargaining.
 Moscow has'consistently indicated that it desires to
 normalize relations, but has so fa.r refused to agree
 even to the return of Japanese prisoners of war.

 West German Arms Debate:  The Bundestag debate on 27 and
 25 June on the bill for calling up 6,000 volunteers
 for a German army nucleus makes it uncertain whether
 any Germans will be in uniform before fall.  The
 tenor of the debate on this interim legislation sug-
 gests that the government's permanent legislative
 program for rearmament is headed toward      further de-
 lays.                                    .     .    .    .                         .  . ...  .  .  Page  4
 The Western Ambassadors', Conference With.the Yugoslavs:
 The converses  ons held In Belgrade  rom 24 to 27

 interpretation of the international situation or its
 foreign policy.  The talks revealed that Yugoslavia

 Soviet and Rumanian Petroleum Exports to the West:   The
 USSR and Rumania have maintained the rate o  petro-
 leum exports to the West reached during the Soviet
 export drive begun in the last half of 1954,  Al-
 though petroleum products are an important item
 in balancing Soviet trading accounts with Western
 nations, these exports are only 8.8 percent of
 total Soviet and Rumanian production.                     Page  6

 The Italian Cabinet Crisis: The airing of Christian Demo-
 cra  c  ac  ona. ism w ich accompanied Premier Scelba's
 fall on 22 June has pointed up the difficulty of
 forming a. new Italian government.  The outlook remains
 one of cabinet instability, probably lasting until new
 elections are held.   F_            I  .  .  .  . .  . .  .  .  Page 3.2
 New Labor Agitation Developing in France:  A general strike
 of 1,00U,000 French government wor ers, scheduled for
 1 July, underlines the growing restiveness and dissat-
 isfaction of French labor over its lack of effective
 bargaining power.   Even if the government succeeds in
 preventing a general walkout, nuisance strikes of rail
 and communications workers are likely.

 Power Balance in Argentina. Still Uncertain:   The military
 revolt of     June has altered the power structure of
 the Argentine government at least temporarily by re-
 turning the army to a dominant position over labor.
 The forthcoming announcement of new cabinet ministers
 will shed light on the durability of this change.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 THE SOVIET LEADERSHIP TODAY .  .  .  .        .    .

 Party secretary Khrushchev has been the chief benefici-
 ary of Malenkov's decline and is today undoubtedly the single
 most powerful Soviet leader.   He does not have a. monopoly of
 power, however, and may have neither the ambition nor the
 ability to assume Stalin's mantle.   Premier Bulganin does not
 have Khrushchev's authority, but he is probably a force in
 Soviet policy-making and an important factor in the intricate
 balance which exists in the Presidium.  As Soviet representa-
 tive at the four-power talks, he will not have a completely
 free hand, but there is no reason to doubt his ability to
 speak with authority for the Soviet regime or to pursue a.
 policy which he undoubtedly helped to formulate.

 In recent months the Soviet government has reorganized
 its economic planning and control apparatus.                                                 This reorgani-
 zation reflects a major effort to solve internal problems
 stemming from the lack of integrated long-range planning,
 lagging growth of labor productivity, wage inequalities, over-
 expenditure of wage funds, and difficulties in allocating re-
 sources in an increasingly complex economy.
 CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY PURGE CONTINUES .  .  .  . .  .  . .  . .  Page  7
 The four-year-old purge of the Chinese Communist Party
 apparently did not end with the public disgrace of Kao Yang
 and Jao Shu-shih last March.  The party has established new
 control committees and has marked the party rank and file as
 the principal object of their activity.

 SUMMIT CONFERENCE DEVELOPMENTS
 Soviet foreign minister
 Molotov, in his public and pri-
 vate statements at San Fran-
 cisco, provided most of the new
 hints of the position the USSR
 will take at Geneva, although
 he remained evasive on many
 points.
 At his press conference,
 Molotov argued that it is up
 to the heads of government to
 decide whether to seek any sub-
 stantive agreements or merely
 plan procedures for future
 talks,   On the same ground, he
 avoided questions on which
 topics would be on the agenda
 and how long the conference
 would last.
 He told  Macmillan that
 the    heads, of state  should
 "identify" . problems   of..
 common concern and refer them
 to the foreign ministers for
 attempts at "progress toward
 settlement," but that any is-
 sue which was "undesirable"
 .to any one of the heads of
 government should be "avoided."
 In talks with the British
 foreign minister, Molotov clar-
 ified, the issues which the
 USSR is likely to raise.   He
 spoke of the need for a con-
 ference,.including Communist
 China, on Far Eastern matters.
 He emphasized the important
 role economic issues would
 play at the summit talks, re-
 ferring to his public sugges-
 tion for a world trade con-
 ference. He also emphasized
 the importance of the disarma-
 ment problem.
 The Indian daily States-
 mat printed an article last
 week which may reflect Nehru's..-
 views and shed some light-on
 Soviet intentions.   It said
 that the  Soviet   disarma-
 ment plan would be the princi-
 pal proposal at the summit
 talks.   It also suggested that
 the USSR might avoid raising
 the Far Eastern issue because
 of current efforts to find a
 solution to the problem, pre-
 sumably those being undertaken
 by Menon, and added that Mos-
 cow would probably not raise
 the Indochina issue either.
 It seems clear that a
 main Soviet aim at Geneva will
 be to get agreement on some
 general principles, as in the
 communiques with the Indians
 and Yugoslavs, and on a series
 of future conferences which
 would serve Soviet purposes.
 These would probably include
 a Far East meeting including
 Peiping, a world trade con-
 ference, a collective security
 meeting of European states such
 as Moscow has sought in the
 past, and new talks on disarma-
 ment either in the UN subcom-
 mittee or in some larger and
 more public forum.
 Molotov gave a very slight
 hint of interest in French for-
 eign minister Pinay's sugges-
 tion for an arrangement between
 the two existing European se-
 curity blocs, telling his press
 conference that the difference
 between the Pinay plan and the
 Soviet security proposal "needs
 study."
 Molotov stressed to Brit-
 ish foreign minister Macmillan
 the interrelation of the...:
 European  security. and  the.

 disarmament questions.  This
 may have been a hint that he
 could not accept a European
 arms limitation-agreement
 separate from general agree-
 ment on disarmament and the
 abolition of foreign bases.
 He had little to say
 about the German issue in ei-
 ther public or private state-
 ments.
 Molotov did nothing to
 destroy the growing impression
 that the USSR will try to avoid
 the German unification issue
 at Geneva., subordinating it
 to the European security ques-
 tion and trying to shift the
 detailed negotiations to all-
 German meetings or to later
 talks with Adenauer in Moscow.
 The first statement by
 a responsible Soviet official
 in recent weeks predicting a
 German unification offer came
 from Ambassador Vinogradov
 in Paris.   He told the American
 ambassador flatly that Moscow
 is now prepared to accept free
 all-.German elections subject
 to strict international control,
 provided only that foreign
 troops be first withdrawn.
 Vinogradov's statement
 runs counter to the bulk of
 evidence that the Soviet Union
 will seek to avoid the issue.
 It probably only indicates that
 Moscow must make an occasional
 effort to demonstrate its de-
 sire for unification with free
 elections, in order to main-
 tain neutralist hopes and
 pressures on the United States
 to meet the USSR halfway, with
 concessions.   It could, however,
 indicate that the USSR is pre-
 paring a free elections and
 neutralization package for a
 united Germany which it is will-
 ing to risk offering eventually--
 on the assumption that Western
 rejection will save it from hav-
 ing to carr  out or disown the
 proposal.

 INDONESIAN CRISIS
 A political-military
 crisis in Indonesia has re
 suited from army opposition to
 the installation on 27 June of
 General Utoyo as the new chief
 of staff.
 The motion of no confi-
 dence directed against the
 pro-Communist defense minister
 which was introduced in parlia-
 ment on 29 June may lead to a
 cabinet reshuffle or a cabinet
 collapse.
 In the latter event,
 President Sukarno, who for the
 first time finds himself
 challenged by the army and
 parliament, might appoint a
 caretaker cabinet, responsible
 to him rather than to parlia-
 ment, to govern until a .new
 cabinet could be formed after
 the elections in September.
 Sukarno and Defense
 Minister Iwa had been warned
 bringing about the removal of
 Daud, settlement of the quarrel
 between the two nations on the
 basis of "Islamic brotherhood"
 would be relatively simple.
 The Moscow press reported
 on 29 June that a five-year
 Soviet Afghan agreement on re-
 ciprocal extension of rights
 for free transit of goods over
 each other's territory had been
 signed in Moscow.  Geographic
 and physical difficulties, how-
 ever, make it unlikely that the
 agreement could counter the ef-

 pointment of Utoyo, who was

 Utoyo's installation ceremony

 other six territorial command-

 staff, Colonel Lubis, who has
 held this post since the resig-
 nation of anti-Communist Gen-
 eral Sugeng in early May.
 Lubis has since announced
 to the press that he will not
 relinquish his duties and
 claimed that he has the sup-
 port of the territorial com-
 manders.   He has thus far
 refused to recognize his for-
 mal suspension from office.

 Utoyo, although a. neutral so
 far as army factions are con-
 cerned, leans politically to-
 ward the National Party, which
 heads the government.
 The real target of the
 territorial commanders, four
 of whom are strongly anti-
 Communist, is Defense Minister
 Iwa, and the present situation
 has served to unite them against
 him.   Should the army remain
 firm in its opposition, the
 cabinet, which is eager to re-
 main in office until the Sep-
 tember elections, may compro-
 mise by dropping Iwa before
 the no-confidence motion comes
 to a vote.
 The no-confidence motion
 could not pass without support
 from parties which are repre-
 sented in the coalition gov-

 votes is not unusual in Indo-
 nesia, however, and, particu-
 larly in view of the National
 Party's deteriorating prestige,
 the motion might pass if
 brought to a vote.
 A significant aspect of
 the situation has been the
 role of the National Police,
 which for the first time has
 abandoned its neutral status
 and supported the army.  The

 The Formosa Straits--
 Military and Political
 Two HAtionalist planes
 were intercepted by patrolling
 Communist jets on 27 June.
 The Communists have been care-
 ful in their military opera-
 tions, however, not to preju-
 dice the prosper.tt;  for Sino-
 American negotiations.
 In one of the attacks of
 27 June, Communist jet fighters
 made their first appearance
 near the Matsus.
 In the first attack, a
 Nationalist jet
 trainer
 was
 shot down
 about
 65
 miles
 north
 of Matsu.
 In the
 second,
 a
 PBY of a Nationalist
 civil airline was
 slightly damaged and
 forced down 10 miles
 south of Matsu.
 The Chinese
 Communist navy has
 apparently increased
 its amphibious
 training activity
 and logistic support
 in and around the
 Peiling_Peninsula
 north of the Matsus.
 The training has in-
 volved minor naval
 vessels, and the
 logistic activity
 has involved chiefly
 junks and steamers
 escorted by small
 patrol craft.
 There are indi-
 cations that the
 Chinese Communist
 naval strength will
 soon be increased.
 A convoy of two So-
 viet destroyers and
 four submarines is
 en route to Tsingtaoy
 presumably for transfer to the
 Chinese; this would raise Chi-
 nese destroyer strength to
 four and increase the number of
 submarines to 11.
 Completion of the Litang-
 Fort Bayard railway line west
 of Canton has made available
 additional railway engineer
 divisions, which could move to
 Fukien to speed work on the
 Kueichi-Foochow railway and its
 branch to Amoy.

 Soviet and Chinese Commu-
 nist spokesmen have continued
 to endorse Chou En-lai's bid
 for Sino-American talks.
 Peiping, periodically announc-
 ing that "the question now
 rests with the United States,"
 appears still to be awaiting
 reports from intermediaries.
 Soviet-Japanese Talks
 The position taken by
 Soviet delegate Malik in the
 Soviet-Japanese negotiations in
 London suggests that the USSR
 is still withholding signifi-
 cant concessions in the hope
 that Japan will make proposals
 which can be used as a basis
 for bargaining.
 Moscow has consistently
 indicated that it desires a
 normalization of relations,
 but has refused up to now to
 agree even to the return of
 Japanese prisoners of war in
 order to gain this end.
 On territorial questions,
 Malik on 24 June expressed
 "disappointment" that Japan
 could not accept the Soviet
 view that the status of
 India's Krishna Menon and
 Burmese premier U Nu are both
 expected to report in detail to
 Chou on their conversations in
 Washington.   Both will presum-
 ably tell the Chinese that the
 United States attaches great
 importance to the question of
 Americans detained in Communist
 China.
 Chou has indicated-both to
 Menon and to UN secretary gen-
 eral Hammarskjold that he would
 be willing to release at least
 some of those detained, in-
 cluding the 11 airmen of the
 "spy" case, if the United States
 would permit their relatives
 to visit them and thus give
 him a face-saving occasion for
 commuting their sentences.
 Under pressure from his inter-
 mediaries, Chou would be ex-
 pected to forego the propaganda
 advantages of the visits in the
 interest of advancing Sino-
 Soviet international strategy.
 Habomai, Shikotan, the Kurils
 and South Sakhalin had been
 settled.
 In answer to Matsumoto's
 outline of Japan's historical
 and geographical claims, Malik
 said on 24 June that territorial
 claims had already been disposed
 of, citing Yalta, Potsdam, the
 Japanese surrender document, and
 SCAP directives.  He stated
 categorically that further dis-
 cussion of Japanese territorial
 claims was "futile," and ob-
 jected even to including in the
 communique the fact that terri-
 torial claims had been discussed.
 Malik's reluctance to in-
 clude such a reference probably
 resulted from the public revela-
 tion earlier this month by

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 June 1955
 Foreign Minister
 Shigemitsu of the
 extensive demands
 made by the Soviet
 Union on 14 June.
 These demands evoked
 much unfavorable
 comment in Japanese
 official circles and
 the press.   Malik
 apparently is at-
 tempting to avoid a
 clash between the
 hard line in private
 talks and Soviet
 propaganda stress-
 ing the benefits
 which will accrue to
 both nations through
 normalized relations.
 Following the
 meeting on 24 June,
 a senior official of
 the Japanese embassy
 in London told the
 American embassy
 that Japanese public opinion
 was hardening toward the USSR.
 He then said that before rela-
 tions could be normalized,
 Japan would insist on (1) So-
 viet recognition of Japanese
 sovereignty over Habomai and
 Shikotan--both of which have
 been an integral part of Japan.
 since 1634;  (2) withdrawal of
 the Soviet thesis that the Sea
 of Japan must be closed to war
 vessels of all but riparian
 powers; and (3) repatriation
 of Japanese prisoners of war.
 While the USSR could, at
 little cost to itself, meet
 these Japanese demands, it has
 given no indication that it is
 ready to make a "package" con-
 cession of this size to the
 Japanese this early in the ne-
 gotiations.  Moscow probably
 believes that Prime Minister
 Hatoyama personally feels a
 sense of urgency in normaliz-
 ing relations with the USSR
 and that time is on the Soviet
 side.
 Since Hatoyama continues
 to stake his position on the
 success of the talks, his dif-
 ferences with Shigemitsu on
 policy could again come into
 the open.   This would seriously
 damage the ability of the Jap-
 anese delegation at London to
 sustain the above conditions
 for a settlement.
 The Japanese Foreign Min-
 istry is not anxious to hurry
 the talks, since it believes
 that the forthcoming summit
 conference will favorably af-
 fect Japan's negotiations with
 the USSR.  The public disclo-
 sure of Moscow's stiff terms
 and uncompromising attitude is
 having a salutary effect on the
 Japanese public, which had been
 misled by Hatoyama into expect-
 ing a quick favorable settle-
 ment.                                                                         A continued hardening
 of opinion against the Soviet
 Union could strengthen the For-
 eign Ministry position suffici-
 ently to permit either prolonged
 negotiations, or, if necessary,
 a suspension of the talks.

 West German Arms Debate
 The bitter debatetin the
 West German Bundestag on 27
 and 28 June on the bill for
 calling up 5,000 volunteerk,
 for a German army nucleus has
 made it uncertain whether any
 Germans will be in uniform be-
 fore fall.
 Chancellor Adenauer had
 rallied sufficient support for
 this interim legislation to
 pass it on the first reading
 on 27 June, but additional
 changes in the text have left
 little time for the Bundestag
 to pass the bill in final form
 before the present Bundestag's
 adjournment deadline of 15 July.
 Opposition to the bill
 within the. government coalition
 parties stemmed from its loose-
 ly drawn provisions which cbn-
 flicted with the general', 'demand
 of the Bundestag that civilian
 control of rearmament be sharp-
 ly defined.   The tenor of this
 week's debate also suggested
 that the government's permanent
 rearmament legislation is
 headed for difficulties.
 During the debate the minor
 coalition parties and even the
 Bavarian affiliate of Adenauer's
 own Christian Democratic Union
 forced a promise from the gov-
 ernment that several aspects
 of the defense program would
 be covered by subsequent con-
 stitutional amendments.   Be-
 cause of the increasing unrelia-
 bility of the coalition Refugee
 Party, it is doubtful that
 Adenauer can muster the two-,

 It is there-&: re likely
 that the government will even-
 tually renege on its promise
 .to seek constitutional amend-
 ments relating to armament
 matters. From a strictly legal
 point of view, West German
 rearmament probably does not
 require further changes in the
 constitution.
 Political controversies
 over constitutional issues,
 however, will probably cause
 considerable friction within
 the coalition when the govern-
 ment presents some 20 planned
 permanent arms bills to the
 parliament during the next
 six months.   Many of these
 bills will be hotly contested
 and progress on them will prob-
 ably be slow.
 It also seems likely that
 many Bundestag members will be
 disposed to postpone enacting
 a general conscription law,
 probably until after the 1957
 federal elections.
 There are no indications
 that Adenauer's current defense
 legislation difficulties stem
 from any decrease in his pop-
 ularity with the West German
 electorate.   The situation has

 30 June 1955
 fundamental changes in Belgrade's
 interpretation of the inter-
 national situation or in its
 foreign policy.   The talks
 served to define Yugoslav views
 somewhat more accurately, and
 disclosed areas where Belgrade
 may have become slightly more
 amenable to Western desires.
 This was particularly true
 regarding Yugoslav willingness
 to hold high-level discussions
 on strategic and tactical ques-
 tions related to American mili-
 tary aid.  While in the past
 Belgrade has consistently ad-
 vocated continued Western mili-
 tary aid, and has suggested
 "technical talks" on that ques-
 tion, it has been chary of dis-
 cussing its strategic plans,
 even those affecting Yugoslav
 troops receiving the equipment.
 Tentative agreement has
 been reached to hold preliminary
 discussions early in July on an
 agenda for the future talks.
 These discussions will indicate
 whether Yugoslavia is actually
 willing ?to discuss plans for
 forces in the northern area a-
 round Ljubljana which have
 received almost all past aid
 materiel.
 In general, Prica empha-
 sized that his country would
 continue and even expand its
 defense efforts but had no in-
 tention of branching out along
 new lines.   He said Yugoslavia's
 co-operation with its Balkan
 allies guaranteed that its in-
 terests coincided in matters of
 defense with those of the West,
 but he re-emphasized that Bel-
 grade has no desire to join
 NATO..  Prica did state, however,
 that NATO is still necessary,
 as its abandonment would strength-
 en the other side which has not
 given up a "bloc" policy.
 Prica expanded the usual
 Belgrade line regarding Soviet
 intentions, disclosing that his
 government believes that the
 "Soviets are ready to solve
 questions on the basis of the
 status quo" by trying to keep
 all they have gained while find-
 ing a modus vivendi.   He em-
 phasized that the Yugoslavs do
 not support this position but
 feel the West should examine it
 as a "starting point" for ne-
 gotiations without trying to
 balance the concessions made to
 the USSR in 1945.
 Belgrade continues to feel
 that the West should exploit
 Soviet initiatives, but without
 relaxing its defense efforts.
 The Yugoslavs believe that in-
 ternal difficulties, which have
 compelled the post-Stalin changes
 in the USSR, will force further
 changes if the USSR is left a-
 lone.   They also believe, how-
 ever, that the Soviet Union, if
 faced by an adamant Western
 policy, could revert to its old
 course for a long period of
 time despite these internal
 difficulties.
 Prica re-emphasized his
 government's previous position
 that the German problem is the
 central one in Europe and that
 its solution lies in the rap-
 prochement  of the two Germanys.
 He felt that the Soviet leaders
 do not foresee the early uni-
 fication of Germany.
 Tito, at his 27 June lunch-
 eon for the three Western ambas-
 sadors, expressed the belief
 that the USSR would not consider
 a solution to the German ques-
 tion at Geneva, and probably
 not until after the anticipated
 West German-Soviet talks.
 In regard to Satellite-
 Soviet relations, the Yugoslavs
 feel that some change in rela-
 tionship is developing, and
 that considerable impetus for
 such a change was provided by
 the recent Soviet-Yugoslav
 talks.   They believe that Soviet

 Petroleum Exports to the West
 Tanker shipments of pe-
 troleum'to the West from the
 USSR and Rumania have main-
 tained the rate reached during
 the Soviet export drive begun
 in the last half of 1954.   In
 the first five months of 1955
 the USSR and Rumania exported
 to the West almost 2,000,000
 metric tons, valued at nearly
 $40,000,000.  This represents
 an increase in volume of 62
 percent over the same period
 in 1954.
 Petroleum has been a
 readily marketable commod-
 ity with which to balance
 Soviet trading accounts
 with Western nations, but
 these exports are only 8.8
 percent of total Soviet
 and Rumanian production.
 On the basis of com-
 mitments as of January 1955,
 it was reported that 1955
 petroleum exports to the
 past six months.   It apparently
 has no".present intention of
 changing its course, but the
 recent Yugoslav-Soviet discus-
 sions may have engendered some
 suspicions of Soviet motives
 among Yugoslav leaders which
 will make them eventually more
 amenable to Western efforts to
 promote increased mutual mili-
 tary co-operation.
 Exports of petroleum to
 the West from the USSR continue.
 to exceed those from Rumania.
 In the first five months of
 1955, Soviet shipments accounted
 for over 60 percent of the ex-
 ports.  Most of the 1955 in-
 crease was shipped from the
 Black Sea ports of the USSR.
 Fuel oil continues to be the
 main item, followed by gas oil,
 crude oil, gasoline, kerosene,

 to Ben Halim's efforts to in-
 crease Egyptian influence over
 the palace.
 Ben Halim and the Egyptian
 ambassador in Tripoli are be-
 lieved to have arranged the
 king's marriage on 5 June to
 an Egyptian.
 One of the primary motives
 of the marriage is apparently
 the hope that the new wife will
 produce a male heir.  None of
 67-year-old Idriss' four pre-
 vious marriages has provided
 a living heir and there is,
 accordingly, considerable un-
 certainty regarding the future
 of the dynasty.
 .If the king's Egyptian
 wife should give birth to a
 son who survives, her influence
 as well as that of Egypt would
 be immeasurably increased.
 The effect of the new mar-
 riage on the future position of
 Queen Fatima and her family is
 unclear.  The queen belongs to
 the Sharif branch of the royal
 family And its leading members
 are commercial and political
 opponents of the prime minister.
 Although the queen is re-
 ported to have agreed to the
 second marriage, the threat it
 poses to the future, of the
 Sharif branch may precipitate
 a dynastic struggle, with the
 question of Egyptian domination
 of the palace a primary issue.

 his concern to Ambassador Tappin
 over the threat to Libya's in-
 dependence as a result of in-
 creasing Egyptian penetration
 and indicated that he considered
 Ben  Halim`. ilresponsibl6  for
 the situation.  Muntasser said
 he feared that the large number
 of Egyptian teachers and lawyers
 now employed in Libya would
 gradually reduce Libya to the
 role of an Egyptian satellite.
 Both Egypt and Ben Halim
 reportedly wanted to prevent
 Idriss from paying a state vis-
 it to Turkey which has been
 scheduled for the past year.
 The Turkish ambassador in Trip-
 oli told Ambassador Tappin of
 his extreme concern over can-
 cellation of the visit and the
 implicit setback to Turkey's
 position in Libya.  He suggested
 that interested chiefs of mis-
 sions in Libya should meet to
 discuss the growing Egyptian
 domination of the Libyan govern-
 ment.
 The American embassy in
 Tripoli during the past months
 has been disturbed by the ex-
 tent of Egyptian penetration
 of the Libyan courts, schools,
 and royal family.
 The embassy reports that
 Egyptian judges have been re-
 sponsible for many of'the de-
 lays and difficulties experi-
 enced in implementing the

 from that position.   Almost all
 Greek political parties and
 affiliations support the move-
 ment, which has become a na-
 tional crusade.  The government-
 controlled Greek radio recently
 called on Cypriots to "arise
 and liberate your fatherland."
 Athens has decided to appeal
 again to the UN for considera-
 tion of self-determination for
 the islanders.
 On Cyprus, terrorist activ-
 ities continue at a high fre-
 quency.   In the past week, three
 persons have been reported
 killed and 20 wounded.   Arch-
 bishop Makarios, who leads the
 movement against Britain, claims
 to have advised his people
 against violence.   He added,
 however, that he opposed even
 more "policies which have driven
 them to it."  Apparently the
 British police on Cyprus are
 beginning to feel that they can
 no longer depend on the loyalty
 of Greek elements in the Cyprus
 police force.
 There are indications that
 Britain may, offer the Cypriots
 a formula providing for some
 type of gradual self-determina-
 tion.   With the present temper
 of the Cypriots, however, such
 a solution is not likely to be
 acceptable either to them or
 to pro-union elements in Greece.
 Such an offer might lead the
 Papagos government to moderate
 its tone.
 Although there is a report
 that Makarios might support a
 liberal constitution, he may no
 longer be free to make compro-
 mises, as important segments.
 in the island clergy are now be-
 lieved to be even more rabid
 than he.
 Premeditated attacks on
 American installations and per-
 sonnel: are not likely unless
 the United States comes to be
 identified with British poli-
 cies.  There is, however, the
 risk that through misunder-
 standing, miscalculation, or
 irresponsibility, American
 lives and propert  might be
 jeopardized.
 It is evident that Paris
 is still temporizing with re-
 gard to Moroccan policy, de-
 spite the initial promotion of
 Gilbert Grandval as a "new man
 for a new program."
 Grandval is expected to
 assume his new duties as French
 resident general about 7 July.
 He probably will limit himself
 to maintaining order as well as
 possible until the French-'
 Tunisian agreements are ap-
 proved by both houses of the
 French parliament.  Thereafter,
 Moroccan problems are to be
 tackled.
 Violence continues in
 spite of widespread arrests.
 Some 12 French counterterrorists,
 including a number of police,
 have been arrested as a result
 of the'investigation of the mur-
 der on 11 June of the wealthy

 Africa.         These bombings may be
 an isolated expression of the
 mushrooming anti-Americanism
 among French settlers in North
 Africa.
 The USIS in Tunis has con-
 ducted an exceptionally success-
 ful program among Tunisians for
 several years, and thus is sus-
 pect to many French settlers.
 The vice consul maintains
 official contacts with Tunisian
 labor leaders.  The bombings
 were therefore more likely the
 work of French extremists than
 of ultranationalists.
 Paris is hopeful that the
 National Assembly will approve
 the agreement with Tunisia
 before 14 July.  There are in-
 dications, however, that de-
 spite Premier Faure's inten-
 tion to press for complete
 ratification, the Council of
 the Republic may not consider
 the agreement before the sum-
 mer recess on 15 August.  Such
 a delay might lead to a re-
 sumption of disorders in Tunisia,
 where the principal nationalist
 party, the Neo-Destour, is
 actively working for ratifibbtiori,
 while French extremists, fanat
 ical  nationalists and the small
 Communist Party oppose the agree-
 ment.
 The situation in Algeria
 shows no signs of improvement.
 Violent terrorism has broken
 out in the coastal city of
 Philippeville, and assassina-
 tions and economic sabotage
 continue.
 The reforms now being
 drafted by the governor general
 have aroused no response among
 the Moslems and little enthusi-
 asm  among the French settlers.
 National Assembly debate on
 the Algerian situation is
 scheduled for 5 July.
 Meanwhile, anti Americanism
 is growing among French settlers
 and officials in Algeria.  This
 attitude is the result of rumors
 propagated by minor officials
 and bolstered by press reports
 of American failure to support
 France in its efforts to deal
 with the Algerian situation.
 The airing of Christian
 Democratic factionalism which
 accompanied Premier Scelba's
 fall on 22 June has further
 pointed up the difficulty of
 forming a new Italian govern-
 ment.                            The outlook remains one
 of cabinet instability, proba-

 responsible for the overthrow
 of Scelba.

 New Labor Agitation
 Developing in France
 French labor has recently
 begun to show restiveness over
 its lack of effective bargain-
 ing power by peaceful means
 and resentment over political
 exploitation by the dominant
 labor confederation.
 A flurry of spontaneous
 strikes in key industries has
 been accompanied by outbursts
 of violence which recall the
 semi-insurrectional general
 strikes of 1947 and 1948.   The
 government has acted quickly
 to satisfy some wage demands,
 and has taken steps to avert
 a general strike of govern-
 ment workers scheduled for
 1 July.   The French civil serv-
 ants" union had taken the
 position that earlier wage
 increase proposals were in-
 adequate.
 Unlike the situation in
 August 1953, when an explo-
 sive labor outburst caught
 the Communist-led General
 Labor Confederation (CGT) by
 surprise, the CGT is now ac-
 tively pushing  the class-
 warfare theme, and will be
 ready to exploit to the full-
 est any strike movement, even
 if sparked by the free unions.
 At the national congress
 of the CTG held from 12 to
 The problem of political
 instability in Italy probably
 can be resolved only by new
 elections.  These are now
 scheduled for 1958, but may
 be moved up to 1956 by the
 Christian Democrats if their
 party does well in upcoming
 local elections.
 17 June,   Secretary General
 Benoit Frachon demanded a
 complete return to the old
 line that the "pauperization"
 of the working class is in-
 evitable under a capitalist
 regime.   In an unprecedented
 exhibition of independence,
 however, several of the most
 prosperous unions rejected
 this Communist attempt to sub-
 ordinate labor aims completely
 to political ends, and insisted
 that the working class could
 progress toward limited objec-
 tives.
 This was the first time
 since the Workers Force (FO)
 broke away from the CGT in
 1947 that Communist Party con-
 trol of the CGT-was openly
 questioned, and party leaders
 recognized the threat of a
 dangerous dissident movement
 which would jeopardize their
 control at a time when pro-
 Mendes-France groups in the
 CGT, FO and the Christian
 Workers Confederation were
 discussing prospects for a
 new mass labor movement.
 The strong Communist
 stand on the'inevitable pauper-
 ization of the working class
 was probably motivated by`the
 desire to block the Mendes-
 France appeal for working-class
 support.

 Despite Faure's success

 strikes are in prospect, in-

 There is apparently no
 co-ordination in most of the

 up their strike threats by a
 walkout stretching into sev-

 serious than in 1953 could

 Power Balance in Argentina
 Still Uncertain
 The military revolt of
 16 June has at least temporari-
 ly altered the power structure
 of the Argentine government by
 returning the army to a domi-
 nant position over labor.  The
 forthcoming announcement of new
 cabinet ministers will shed
 light on the durability of this
 change.
 At present the military,
 especially Minister of the
 Army Lucero, probably controls
 the government.   The army is
 reported to have taken great,
 pains to conceal its power
 over Peron, however, and govern-
 ment communiquds claim that
 the country has returned to
 normal.
 civil war might result from the
 immediate removal of Peron,
 whose party won almost 68 per-
 cent of the total vote in the
 congressional elections of
 April 1954.
 the ouster of Peron, as advo-
 cated by naval and other mili-
 tary elements, should not even
 be considered until after the
 General Confederation of Labor
 (CGT) has been disarmed and
 until the position of the non-
 commissioned officers, who
 have been favored by Peron,
 has been ascertained.
 The military junta formed
 following the revolt was dis-
 solved on 22 June after Peron
 agreed to satisfy demands re-
 sulting from army-navy ne o-
 tiations
 Army
 officials, despite some distrust
 of the president, reportedly
 agreed to allow Peron time to
 proceed alone in meeting these
 demands.
 The major reported demands
 were for (1) the resignation
 of all cabinet ministers,  (2)
 dropping of the conflict with
 the church,  (3) no punishment
 for navy men, and (4) "purging"
 of the CGT.
 The announced resignation
 of all cabinet members on 23
 June "to give Peron a free hand,"
 the actual resignation of the
 head of the CGT on 27 June, and
 the "irrevocable" resignation
 of Angel Borlenghi, Peron's
 minister of interior and jus-
 tice, on 28 June suggest that
 Peron is responding to army
 pressure.   High army officials
 had long opposed Borlenghi's
 position in the government.
 Acceptance or rejection of most
 of the cabinet resignations is
 apparently still pending, with
 the probability that a number
 of the less controversial old
 cabinet members will be retained.

 Labor Unrest Mounts in Chile
 Labor unrest in Chile is
 mounting as a result of con-
 tinuing inflation.  Public
 employees are scheduled to
 strike on 1 July, and the di-
 rectorate of Chile's largest
 labor confederation, CUTCH, has
 voted for a general strike to
 begin on 6 July.
 The labor unrest stems
 mainly from the steady depreci-
 ation of real wages over the
 past few years.  As of 1 April
 1955 the cost of living had
 risen about 155 percent in a
 two-year period. Furthermore,
 scarcely a day passes without
 new disputes over working con-
 ditions.  According to govern-
 ment statistics, some 1,470 la-
 bor disputes were recorded
 during 1954.
 The Communists, whose or-
 ganization is outlawed, re-
 portedly do not favor strikes
 at this time because they fear
 repressive action by the.govern-
 ment.                            The pro-Communist presi-
 dent of CUTCH is reported to
 SECRET
 have stated that there will be
 no general strike if the govern-
 ment meets the wage demands at
 the civil servants.   The Ibanez
 administration recently re-
 quested urgent action on pay
 raises.
 The prospects for slowing
 the inflationary   spiral in the
 near future are not bright.
 President Ibanez never has
 sponsored a consistent anti-
 inflationary program; more-
 over, he lacks majority sup-
 port in either house of Congress.
 Over the past several
 months practically all wage
 disputes have been settled
 through government "mediation"--
 that is, enforced government-
 sponsored compromises.  A
 similar solution seems likely
 in the present situation.
 Labor unrest may be expected
 to continue, however, as long
 as inflation r mains unchecked.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 THE SOVIET LEADERSHIP TODAY
 Party secretary Khrushchev
 has been the chief beneficiary
 of Malenkov's decline and is
 today undoubtedly the single
 most powerful Soviet leader.
 He does not have a monopoly of
 power, however, and may have
 neither the ambition nor the
 ability to assume Stalin's
 mantle.  The foundations of
 group rule have been weakened
 but not shattered by the elimi-
 nation of Beria and the politi-
 cal emasculation of Malenkov,
 and a conscious effort is ap-
 parently being made to maintain
 collective leadership.
 The personnel changes which
 have taken place in the Soviet
 party and government hierarchy
 since Malenkov's resignation
 have resulted in the removal
 or demotion of some officials
 closely connected with Malenkov
 in the past.  Their replace-
 ments are, in some cases, prob-
 ably Khrushchev choices, and
 if such a trend continues,
 Khrushchev's personal position
 may become unshakable.
 Some of the changes, how-
 ever, appear to have been dic-
 tated largely by a search for
 competent management, and the
 true picture of the present
 situation may be distorted if
 they are interpreted uniformly
 in terms of factional align-
 ments in a power struggle.
 The changes so far effected
 do not in any case amount to
 a wholesale shake-up, and it
 would seem that, if Khrushchev
 aspires to supreme personal
 power, he has either preferred
 or been forced to move with
 caution.
 Khrushchev's role in the
 Belgrade parleys, in which he
 overshadowed Premier BUlganin,
 is the clearest public sign
 yet that he is the ranking
 member of the Presidium.
 However, his performance there
 should not be misinterpreted.
 His energetic and headlong tem-
 perament and a fondness for the
 center of the stage seem to
 have caused some non-Soviet
 observers both to underrate
 his abilities and to exaggerate
 his power.
 Neither before nor since
 the Belgrade conference has he
 been given a patently artificial
 publicity build-up by the Soviet
 press.  The various symbols of
 public prestige have, instead,
 been carefully manipulated to
 indicate pre-eminence clearly
 short of absolute dominance.
 His numerous speeches
 before party, agricultural and
 industrial promotional con-
 ferences have been duly but
 not fulsomely reported by the
 Soviet press.  Allusions to
 collective leadership, among
 them Bulganin's assurance to
 the Hearst party that the "prin-
 ciple of collective leadership
 with us is unshakable," still
 appear regularly in the press,
 and alphabetical listing of
 Presidium members, the literal
 symbol of collectivity, has
 been continued.
 Perhaps the most interesting
 recent reference to collectivity
 and reminder of the proper role
 of the party's first. secretary
 is found in an article by a
 venerable Old Bolshevik, G.
 Petrovsky, published in Pravda
 on 20 April,   "Lenin," Petrovs y
 writes,'"taught us collectivity
 in our work, often reminding us
 that all members of the politburo
 are equal, and that the secretary
 is elected to fulfill the de-
 cisions of the central committee
 of the party."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKL\ SUMMARY
 30 June 1955
 seems to have obtained a freer
 hand in guiding government
 policy and to have become even
 more firmly entrenched in the
 party apparatus.  There is
 some reason to suppose, also,
 that he has managed to strength-
 en his ties within the police
 apparatus and the armed forces,
 and may be able to count on
 greater support from that di-
 rection than before.  There are
 almost certainly many men left
 in important positions, how-
 ever, who are indebted to
 Malenkov and there is no sign
 that open season has been de-
 clared on them.
 The search for effective
 leadership of the current agri-
 cultural and industrial pro-
 gram is the most plausible
 explanation of some of the
 personnel changes which have
 taken place recently.  This
 was probably somewhat of a
 factor even in those cases
 where the political motive is
 most clear.
 While Khrushchev has be-
 come the spearhead of both
 domestic and foreign policy,
 he does not appear to have the
 power to make unilateral de-
 cisions either in respect to
 policy or to personnel appoint-
 ments.   His authority is shared
 with, and probably to some ex-
 tent depends on, other members
 of the Presidium, among whom
 Bulganin, Kaganovich, Mikoyan
 and perhaps Molotov appear to
 be the most influential.
 Bulganin's Status
 There has been a tendency
 to regard Bulganin from one of
 two extremes--either as one who
 assumed all of Malenkov's for-
 mer power with his title and
 therefore as a potential rival
 of Khrushchev or. on the other
 hand, as a front man and puppet.
 His role is more complex and
 less easily defined than either
 of these alternatives would
 suggest.
 He does not have Khrush-
 chev's authority, but he is
 probably a force in Soviet
 policy-making and an impor-
 tant factor in the intricate
 balance of personal relation-
 ships which now exists within
 the Presidium.  He has a repu-
 tation for executive ability
 and, as chairman of the Coun-
 cil of Ministers, presumably
 exercises a direct and posi-
 tive influence on the opera-
 tions of the Soviet government,
 As Soviet representative at
 the four-power talks, he will
 not have a completely free
 hand, but there is no reason
 to doubt his ability to speak
 with authority for the Soviet
 regime or to pursue a policy
 which he undoubtedly helped to
 formulate.
 Kaganovich, Molotov, Mikoyan
 The three durable Old
 Bolsheviks, Kaganovich, Molo-
 tov and Mikoyan, are men of
 long experience in particular
 areas of Soviet policy and none
 of them, presumably, has pre-
 tensions to supreme personal
 power.   For these reasons,
 they may now be the pivotal
 force within the "collective,"
 the force which can tip the
 scales in important delibera-
 tions.                                                                                 Of the three, Kagano-
 vich_appears to be closest to
 Khrushchev personally and policy-
 wise, and his behind-the-scenes
 influence is probably consider-
 able, particularly in questions
 relating to industrial develop-
 ment.
 Molotov's dignity and pres-
 tige appear to have suffered
 from the regime's efforts to
 produce a rapprochement with
 Tito, and it is possible that
 confidence in his judgment on
 other questions of foreign rela-
 tions has been impaired.   It
 seems fairly certain, in any
 case, that Molotov does not
 have a paramount voice in set-
 ting the broad lines of Soviet
 foreign policy.  Both the

 larger decisions and those af-
 fecting relations with Com-
 munist states appear to be,
 instead, subject to collective
 discussion and agreement within
 the Presidium.
 This arrangement may have
 been in effect for some time,
 however, and does not neces-
 sarily signify a recent decline
 in Molotov's authority.   There
 is no indication, furthermore,
 that his customary role in the
 practical implementation of
 foreign policy or in the for-
 mulation of domestic policy has
 been circumscribed.  Against
 this background, his resigna-
 tion from the Foreign Ministry,
 which has been rumored since
 the Belgrade conference, is
 not inconceivable, but would
 shed little light on the bal-
 ance of power within the Presi-
 dium, where he would probably
 continue to serve.
 Mikoyan, whose resigna-
 tion as minister of trade was
 announced on the eve of Malen.-
 kov's demotion, accompanied
 Khrushchev and Bulganin to
 Belgrade, presumably to con-
 duct trade negotiations.   Since
 February he has been promoted
 from deputy to first deputy
 chairman of the Council of
 Ministers and apparently con-
 tinues to act as the overlord
 of Soviet domestic and foreign
 trade.   If Mikoyan was at one
 time aligned with Malenkov in
 favoring increased production
 of consumers' goods, he does
 not seem to have been seriously
 injured by the de-emphasis of
 that policy.
 It has been suggested that
 his promotion, like that of
 Pervukhin and Saburov, who were
 appointed first deputy chairmen
 of the Council of Ministers at
 the same time, was a political
 reward for abandonment of Mal-
 enkov.   However, this interpre-
 tation, which seems to pre-
 suppose that the victory of one
 of two clearly defined factions
 was the prelude to Malenkov's
 demotion, may oversimplify the
 pattern of current relation-
 ships within the Presidium and
 the manner in which power has
 shifted there.   Some of the
 Presidium members may have
 favored the present line earlier
 and more emphatically than
 others, but Malenkov's defeat
 seems to have been the conse-
 quence of a gradual shift of opin-
 ion which coalesced around Khru-
 shchev, rather than of a sudden
 showdown between unequal fac-
 tions.
 If this is the case, the
 promotions of Mikoyan, Pervukhin
 and Saburov may have been in-
 tended, not as payment of a polit-
 ical  debt  or as a peace offer-
 ing to a defeated faction, but
 as a sign that the Presidium's
 ranks had not been sharply di-
 vided by Malenkov's resignation.
 Malenkov's Present Status
 Malenkov's present status
 resists clear-cut definition.
 It is uncertain whether his
 immediate and complete elimina-
 tion from the top ranks of the
 regime was considered impossible
 or merely undesirable.   Such
 action may have been ruled out
 on the grounds that it would
 have disturbed a precarious polit-
 ical  balance or because it would
 have presented an undesirable
 picture of division and insta-
 bility, thus undermining the
 regime's prestige at home and
 abroad.
 Malenkov is still formally
 a member of the USSR's topmost
 ruling body and, as such, con-
 tinues to take his place beside
 other Presidium members at pub-
 lic functions.  He is, however,
 the only member of the party
 presidium who sits on the Council
 of Ministers without being a mem-'
 ber of its executive body.   It
 is possible that there is still
 a considerable body of opinion
 which favors his point of. view;
 but it seems more likely that
 his present influence is negli-
 gible.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The process of isolating
 and discrediting him seems.
 to have been halted for the
 moment.   It may be carried to
 a conclusion at a later date,
 of course, but it also is pos-
 sible that the Soviet leader-
 ship is genuinely interested
 in finding an alternative to
 the violence which marked
 Stalin's rule.
 Forces Outside the Presidium
 As long as power remains
 in flux, the forces outside
 .the Presidium on which power
 ultimately depends will prob-
 ably play a more significant
 part than they did under Stalin.
 Efforts to maintain a balance
 of power at the top and the
 personal limitations of the
 Presidium members are likely
 to strengthen this tendency.
 The central committee of
 the party, a rubber-stamp body
 under Stalin, appears now to
 be playing a more central role
 and may even be a key factor
 in large policy matters.  Its
 influence, however, appears to
 derive less from the fact that
 it is the party's legal govern-
 ing body than that its members
 are influential leaders of
 broad interest groups which be-
 cause of the diffusion of power
 since Stalin's death, are capa-
 ble of exercising strong.pres-
 sures in the making of top
 policy.  Among these interest
 groups are the professional
 party bureaucrats and the eco--
 nomic administrators.'- The.
 bureaucrats appear to have
 gained from Khrushchev's as-
 cendancy, while the economic
 administrators may have suf-
 fered as a result of Malenkov's
 decline.
 The military is another
 of these forces.  While it is
 yet to be shown that military
 leaders have begun to exercise
 any overriding political in-
 fluence, their good will doubt-
 edly is something especially
 to be sought and held at a time
 when crucial policy decisions
 must be made and power is still
 in flux.   They have therefore
 recently been granted a number
 of concessions and prerogatives.
 The purely professional
 judgments of leading military
 figures probably have greater
 weight now than at any time
 since the end of World War II
 and these judgments will color
 political and economic decir
 sions.  The military, however,
 is apparently not now, nor:is
 it apt to become ? a cohesive
 or independent; political force,
 and speculation about a Bona-
 partist solution to~.the--suc-
 cession problem is unrealistic
 at the present stage.
 The Soviet leadership has
 passed through its second major
 readjustment since Stalin's
 death.  While-collective leader-
 ship remains in force, its base
 has been narrowed, as a pre-
 dominance of power has tended
 to pass more and more into the
 hands of four oar 'five _.top
 leaders.  These men appear,
 however, to recognize the danger
 to themselvbs inherent in an
 excessive concentration of
 power and will probably attempt
 to maintain something like a
 balance of strength within the
 Presidium,
 The struggle for power is
 muted for the moment, while the
 leaders focus their main energies
 on the direction of policy rath-
 er than on jockeying for per-
 sonal position.   The present
 pattern of leadership is basic-
 ally an improvisation and an
 experiment, and has yet to
 prove that it can withstand
 the stress of serious policy
 differences.  F_          I

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 REORGANIZATION OF THE SOVIET PLANNING AND CONTROL APPARATUS
 In recent months the So-
 viet government has reorganized
 its economic planning and con-
 trol apparatus.  The reorgan-
 ization reflects a major effort
 to solve internal problems
 stemming from the lack of in-
 tegrated      long-range planning,
 lagging growth of labor produc-
 tivity, wage inequalities,
 overexpenditure of wage funds,
 and difficulties in allocating
 resources in an increasingly
 complex economy.
 Premier Bulganin and party
 first secretary Khrushchev an-
 nounced the most important ele-
 ments of the reorganization in
 speeches on 16 and 18 May.
 Four new committees and com-
 missions are now performing
 the functions which for the
 most part had been the respon-
 sibility of the State Planning
 Committee (GOSPLAN).
 These four new bodies are
 the State Commission for Long-
 Range Planning, the State Com-
 mission for Current Planning,
 the State Committee on Labor
 and Wages, and the State Com-
 mittee for the Introduction of
 New Technology into the Econ-
 omy.
 This division of functions
 indicates that the Soviet lead-
 ership has once again turned to
 the concept of specialized
 planning committees'which was
 in effect from 1948 to 1953.
 Soviet leaders now apparently
 believe again that the task of
 planning and supervising Rus-
 sia's growing economy is too
 large to be effectively admin-
 istered by a single all-purpose
 organization.
 The new State Commission
 for Long-Range Planning, under
 the chairmanship of N.K. Bai-
 bakov, former minister of the
 oil industry, is responsible
 for the formulation of five-
 year plans and for long-run
 economic policies.   The choice
 of Baibakov would suggest that
 the first.task of this commis-
 sion will be planning the ex-
 pansion of the fuel and power
 base.
 The State Commission for
 Current-Planning is to be
 chaired by First Deputy Pre-
 mier M.E. Saburov, former head
 of the combined GOSPLAN.   This
 commission has responsibility
 for drawing up the annual plans
 and overseeing their division
 into quarterly and monthly sec-
 tions by both the all-Union
 ministries and the various re-
 public Councils of Ministers.
 It is also responsible for as-
 suring the even production and
 distribution of materials and
 equipment throughout the economy.
 The State Committee for
 Labor and Wages, under First
 Deputy Premier L.M. Kaganovich,
 the foremost economic trouble-
 shooter in the USSR, will prob-
 ably have as its major functions
 the swift revision of existing
 labor norms and wage scales to
 conform with technological ad-
 vances and a more rational dis-
 tribution of manpower in in-
 dustry and agriculture.
 This committee apparently
 will attempt to improve labor
 productivity through direct
 control measures, along with
 the indirect incentives of pro-
 viding more consumers' goods
 for workers.
 The State Committee for the
 Introduction of New Technology
 into the Economy is headed by
 V.A. Malyshov, former minister
 of medium machine building.  As
 its name implies, this committee
 will control the introduction
 into the economy of the latest
 production equipment and methods.

 CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY PURGE CONTINUES
 The four-year-old purge of
 the Chinese Communist Party ap-
 parently did not end with the
 public disgrace of Kao Kang and
 Jao Shu-shih last March.  The
 party has established new con-
 trol committees and has marked
 the party rank and file as the
 principal object of their activ-
 ities.
 Peiping's first "reorgani-
 zation" of the party began in
 mid-1951, and was scheduled to
 run through 1954.   It was sup-
 posed to enlarge the party and
 improve its quality.
 In the early stages of the
 purge, about one in ten members
 was found to be either politi-
 cally unreliable or profession-
 ally incompetent, although not
 all of these were declared be-
 yond redemption.   The "reor-
 ganization" was completed in
 government and industry by mid-
 1953 and was expected to end in
 rural areas the following summer.
 There was no clear indica-
 tion that it would extend to
 the top level of the party un-
 til Liu Shao-chi, on behalf of
 Mao Tse-tung and the politburo,
 addressed the central commit-
 tee in February 1954.  Liu's
 remarks launched a drive for
 "unity" among the leadership,
 aimed explicitly at those
 "high-ranking cadres" who re-
 garded their region or depart-
 ment as their "independent
 kingdom."
 Although Peiping avoided
 mentioning names, it became
 apparent that Kao Kang, nomi-
 nally the regime's chief plan-
 ner and until 1953 genuinely
 the boss of Manchuria, and Jao
 Shu-shih, who directed the
 party's organization department
 and was the.leading official
 in East China,.were the prin-
 cipal targets of the "unity"
 drive.

 assumed by the new State Com-
 mission for Current Planning.
 It is expected that in the fu-
 ture, the Ministry of State Con-
 trol will be concerned princi-
 pally with the critical problem
 areas of the economy, rather
 than with all economic activity
 as in the past.
 The recent reforms are
 the culmination of'administra-
 tive changes designed to deal
 with economic problems dating
 from the Stalin period.   The
 appointment of leaders of the
 highest rank to head these
 committees underscores the
 importance attached to the task
 of increasing efficiency and of
 developing an adequate base for
 planning for future growth.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 June 1955
 The national party confer-
 ence which confirmed the fall
 of Kao and Jao was not convened
 until March 1955, although Liu
 had specifically called for one
 to be held in 1954.   It is not
 known whether the delay resulted
 from the party's reluctance to
 air publicly a continuing in-
 ternal struggle, or from hope
 of being able to announce Kao's
 and Jao's confession.and re-
 pentance.
 Peiping has treated the
 Kao-Jao case as primarily a
 struggle for personal power.
 The regime's propaganda has al-
 so suggested, however, that a
 top-level disagreement over
 the rate of China's socializa-
 tion may have been involved.
 There is as yet no light on
 the question of whether either
 fell because of his relation-
 ship--good or bad--with in-
 dividual Soviet leaders.
 Kao and Jao were found
 guilty of attempting to over-
 throw the established leader-
 ship of the party in order to
 seize the supreme power of the
 party and the state.   Peiping
 asserted that they made over-
 tures to high-ranking party
 members in the army for sup-
 port.
 This charge is supported
 by criticism directed at army
 leaders at the February 1954
 meeting and by measures under-
 taken during 1954 to subordi-
 nate the armed forces more di-
 rectly to central authority.
 No military leaders are known
 to have been disgraced, but
 several have apparently lost
 power.
 It seems reasonable to
 believe that some military
 leaders would have been at-
 tracted by Kao's alleged plan
 to divide power in the party
 between old-time rural guer-
 rilla leaders and those who
 had been underground workers,
 with guerrilla leaders receiv-
 ing the larger share.   The
 military's resentment of "new
 cadres" may present a continu-
 ing problem for Peiping.
 The fate of seven minor
 officials accused of conspiring
 with Kao and Jao has never been
 announced.  Their punishment
 may be revealed later as a fur-
 ther warning to possible dis-
 sidents, and other conspirators
 may be disclosed.
 Peiping only hinted at
 party policy differences, and
 has not specifically charged
 deviation.   Jao was accused of
 adopting a "rightist" policy of
 surrender to bourgeois elements.
 Subsequent editorials have
 cited Lenin's warning about
 bourgeois elements who pretend
 to be "left," and references
 have been made to the need to
 air all future disputes "openly
 and legitimately" within the
 party.
 Kao could have been either
 "left" or "right."  His poli-
 cies in Manchuria, the regime's
 pilot area, were certainly ad-
 vanced, yet as an old guerrilla
 leader he is said to have sought
 support from other guerrilla
 leaders who might be expected
 to sympathize with peasant re-
 sentment of rapid socialization.
 In any case, neither he
 nor Jao repented.  Kao's sui-
 cide is described as an act of
 "ultimate betrayal" of the
 party, and Jao--presumably in
 prison--"persists in an atti-
 tude of attacking the party."
 The conference established
 central and local control com-
 mittees concerned with strength-
 ening party discipline and with
 guarding against future dis-
 unity.   The formation of these
 committees in itself suggested
 the continuation of the party
 "reorganization."
 Peiping's propaganda since
 then has indicated that a cam-
 paign to improve party "disci-
 pline" and expose "antiparty"
 members is under way.   It has
 also revealed that the party

 is still dissatisfied with a-

 party back where it started
 four years ago.

 party "discipline" has been
 closely linked with the class
 struggle, which is expected to
 be "sharper and more compli-
 cated" during the course of So-
 cialist construction.   Cadres
 are said to have only a super-
 ficial understanding of the "in-
 tensification" of class strug-
 gles, and to suffer from bour-
 geois ideology.
 A campaign at this time,
 when Peiping is pushing an aus-
 terity program and consolidat-
 ing agricultural co-operatives,
 could be useful in whipping up
 the cadres' energies for the
 program.   It could also supply
 a ready-made excuse for any
 failure of the program or for
 a hostile peasant reaction.
 On the other hand, a gen-
 uine cleansing of the party
 rolls may be necessary, partic-
 ularly in rural areas where the
 greatest expansion in member-
 ship has occurred.   The party
 admitted 700,000 peasants in
 1954, and is conducting a mem-
 bership drive in rural areas
 this year.
 Peiping's criticism so far
 has been directed primarily at
 the party's rank and file.   No
 specific warning has been issued
 to "high-ranking cadres" as in
 the 1954 "unity" drive, and
 Peiping continues to maintain
 that the party at the central
 committee level is united.
 Nevertheless, certain
 former party leaders may be
 marked for discard.  The status
 of Mao's old rivals Li Li-san
 and Chen Shao-yu, in particular,
 remains obscure.  Neither at-
 tended the National People's
 Congress in September 1954 nor
 was elected to the new govern-
 ment.   Although Li was active
 just before the congress, Chen
 has not been reported by Com-
 munist sources since January
 1954, the same month in which
 Kao and Jao disappeared.
 Apart from the general
 problem of Communist control
 over all aspects of Chinese
 life, there appears to be no
 connection between the party
 "reorganization" and the cur-
 rent campaign against writer
 Hu Feng and his sympathizers.
 Peiping itself has stated that
 the latter case represents
 "counterrevolutionary" rather
 than "antiparty" activity.
 Hu Feng is accused of pub-
 licly and privately questioning
 the regime's. right and compe-
 tence to impose a party line
 on creative artists.   Peiping
 has widely publicized his case
 in an effort to enforce both
 adherence to and enthusiastic
 support of the party line on
 all questions by the Chinese
 intelligentsia.
