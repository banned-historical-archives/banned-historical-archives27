 China's Economic Reforms:

 sector was singled out for change last year, and an October Central
 Committee meeting convincingly demonstrated the party's heightened
 political commitment to reform of the economic structure.
 In an effort to spark long-absent industrial productivity gains, the leader-
 ship called for greater reliance on market signals and for a sharp reduction
 in the number of economic activities subject to mandatory state controls.
 Moreover, party bureaucrats were ordered to turn over day-to-day man-
 agement of enterprises to qualified specialists.
 Although these new policies are decidedly not capitalist, they do represent
 a sharp break with traditional Marxist economic practices and, for that
 reason, remain controversial. Adoption of the new policies is evidence of a
 significant strengthening of reform elements of the party, led by Deng
 Xiaoping and General Secretary Hu Yaobang.
 Equally important, the changes reflect Beijing's perception of its economic
 performance over the past two years. A number of economic strengths in
 1983-84 contributed to the greater commitment to reform:
 ? Agricultural output, which, in response to price changes and new
 economic freedoms, hit record levels both years. China has become a net
 exporter of cotton and the world's largest grain producer.
 ? Record 1984 output of coal and oil, China's primary sources of energy.
 ? Record exports, which gave Beijing a $5 billion trade surplus in 1983 and
 a $3-4 billion surplus in 1984.
 Reforms adopted in 1984 were also intended to address continuing
 problems in the urban/ industrial sector:
 ? Inefficiency, waste, and quality problems persisted despite double-digit
 growth in both 1983 and 1984.
 ? Inadequate commercial and transportation systems proved incapable of
 handling agricultural surpluses, leaving grain to rot in the countryside.
 ? Party and state bureaucracies continued to meddle extensively in day-to-
 day business activity, stifling enterprise initiative and productivity.
 ? Increased subsidies to urban households contributed to six consecutive
 budget deficits totaling almost 65 billion yuan. (The average exchange
 rate in 1984 was 2.32 yuan per US dollar.)

 Most of the structural changes Beijing advocates are either in the earliest
 stages of implementation or still on the drawing board. Hence, we do not
 believe they had much direct impact on the economy in 1984. Nevertheless,
 China is probably already experiencing minor indirect benefits from
 bureaucratic reforms that seek to replace aging party, state, and enterprise
 managers with younger, better educated leaders. Moreover, the speed with
 which the party achieved a consensus on the recent reforms has created the
 appearance of top-level unanimity that may also have an impact on
 midlevel party bureaucrats charged with implementing the changes.
 How China's economy will perform under the expanded reform policies in
 1985 and beyond is an open question. Industrial output will probably again
 record sharp increases in 1985, perhaps as high as 10 percent. Pressure
 from Beijing will probably cause the number of firms operating in the red
 to decline this year, but we believe that at least 10 percent of state-run en-
 terprises will remain in deficit until the Chinese can implement major price
 reform. We would view some increase in the unemployment rate as a sign
 that Beijing is serious about forcing inefficient workers and factories out of
 business. Political sensitivities, however, will probably dictate that any such
 increase will be small.
 Predicting agricultural output is especially difficult this year. Besides the
 usual climatic uncertainties, Beijing is instituting major changes in pricing
 and procurement practices to get farmers more involved in grain transport,
 make them more sensitive to market needs, and reduce the size of
 government subsidies for agricultural products. The changes may dampen
 incentives to produce grain and cotton, a large share of total agricultural
 output. Whether the negative impact of these new policies will be sufficient
 to offset the productivity gains Beijing is still experiencing from earlier
 reforms is a major question Chinese policymakers will face in 1985
 On the negative side, we expect to see China struggling with several
 economic problems this year as a result of reforms. The October call for a
 rational price system reportedly sparked a few bank runs and some panic
 buying, both of which could recur this year as China experiments with
 various price adjustments. Increased-but still manageable-inflation is
 also probable as enterprises circumvent Beijing's demand that industrial
 price increases be absorbed through efficiency gains and not passed on to
 end users.
 Over the longer term, we are cautiously optimistic about the potential
 effects of reform. We anticipate continued gains in the gross value of

 agricultural output-albeit not on the order of the 8-percent average
 annual increase achieved in 1979-84-as Chinese peasants begin using
 modern farming techniques. Despite the increases, China will probably
 continue to rely on supplemental amounts of imported grain to feed its
 coastal cities, thereby reducing the burden on the already hard-pressed
 domestic transportation system.
 In the industrial sector, potential long-term gains from reform are
 enormous, because Chinese enterprises now are so inefficient and poorly
 managed. Beijing's emphasis on competition, its attempt to encourage
 individual initiative in commercial and industrial activity, and efforts to
 create an institutional environment conducive to these changes all bode
 well for long-term growth and efficiency gains. To achieve these benefits,
 however, Beijing must pass through a difficult transition stage-between
 tight central planning and a more market-oriented economy-during
 which it may confront many of the weaknesses of both systems.             25X1
 Aside from economic implications, whether the reforms succeed or fail
 could have wide ramifications for both China's internal political climate
 and its international posture. And, so far, the outcome of these reforms is
 far from certain. We do not share the view, apparent in the Western press,
 that the changes have reached a point where they are irreversible; only a
 few elements of the reform program-all related to agriculture-have been
 implemented so successfully that they are no longer questioned within the
 government or party bureaucracy. In a worst case scenario, opponents of
 the market-oriented approach would seize upon new economic problems to
 successfully attack the reformist position.
 Signs of serious public disorder that might arise, for example, as an urban
 reaction to too rapid price reform, are capable of doing the reform program
 irreparable harm. Sharply increased budget deficits would heighten policy-
 makers' concerns about inflation and could also damage long-term reform
 prospects. Lesser problems such as mounting economic crime, consecutive
 years of poor harvest, deteriorating terms of trade, or growing unrest over
 the acquisition of wealth by a small minority could combine to tip the
 scales against advocates of continued reform. Finally, prospects for
 continued reform hinge greatly on how much longer Deng Xiaoping
 remains politically active. Although he no longer involves himself in day-
 to-day management of economic policy, we believe Deng's strong support
 for the reform program has been the most important factor behind the
 reformers' recent gains.

 China's Economic Reforms:
 Performance and Prospects
 Introduction
 China's massive experiment in economic reform shift-
 ed direction and expanded significantly in 1984.
 Measures introduced during the year amounted to a
 broadside attack on the highly centralized economic
 structure adopted from the Soviet Union in the early
 1950s. Declaring the rigid planning apparatus to be
 the major cause of industrial waste and inefficiency,
 Chinese reformers called for a reduction in direct
 government control, an end to egalitarianism, a cut-
 back in party and state interference in day-to-day
 enterprise affairs, and total reform of the irrational
 price system.
 The Western press has called the reforms a return to
 capitalism, a characterization that, in our view, is
 incorrect. The state has shown no sign of relinquishing
 either ownership or control over major industries in
 China. Moreover, it is still making major investment
 decisions as well as hiring and firing top-level manag-
 ers. By any objective standard, the structure of
 China's economy remains socialist
 Nevertheless, the reforms do represent a sharp break
 with orthodox Marxist economic theory and practice.
 In fact, Chinese leaders have justified the changes by
 arguing that Marxism is incapable of solving all of
 China's economic problems. More accurately, the
 current Chinese experiment might be characterized as
 the most massive attempt ever made by a Communist
 country to supplement socialism with more market-
 oriented economic practices
 Economic Results in 1983 and 1984-
 A Mixed Picture
 Much of what happened economically in China dur-
 ing the past two years reflected the successes and
 failures of Beijing's early experiments with economic
 reform. In the rural sector the earliest reforms-
 dating back to December 1978-included the "con-
 tract responsibility system," which gave farmers ef-
 fective control, but not ownership, of most of the land
 in China, and revised state procurement practices,
 which enabled farmers to sell above-quota production
 at negotiated prices in free markets. In the industrial
 sector, enterprises were allowed to retain an increas-
 ing share of their profits, banks were encouraged to
 give loans in areas where the government had previ-
 ously given grants, and small entrepreneurs were
 allowed to set up service-oriented businesses.
 Agricultural Production Up Sharply. Agricultural
 reforms were the centerpiece of China's effort to
 restructure its economy, and their success has encour-
 aged the regime to push for even more radical depar-
 tures from orthodox Marxist economic practices. The
 total value of agricultural output rose about 9 percent
 in 1983, more than double the 4-percent goal set in
 the annual plan. Growth in 1984 jumped almost 10
 percent, well above the growth target Beijing needs to
 accomplish its goal of quadrupling the total value of
 industrial and agricultural output by the year 2000.
 Since the adoption of the responsibility system in late
 1978, the Chinese have increased their annual grain
 production by 100 million tons-more than the entire
 annual grain production of Australia and Canada
 combined (see table). Grain output reached 387 mil-
 lion tons in 1983 and 407 million tons in 1984. The
 total was far larger than Beijing anticipated or was
 capable of handling effectively. In 1983 Beijing be-
 came the world's largest producer of grain and in
 1984 produced enough corn to sell small quantities to
 its Asian neighbors. Concurrently, grain imports de-
 clined from 15 million tons in 1982 to less than 13
 million tons a year later and then to only about 10
 million tons in 1984. Cotton production showed even
 sharper increases of 29 percent in 1983 and more than
 30 percent last year as China shed its role as one of
 the largest cotton importers and began small-scale
 raw cotton exports. Shipments of US cotton to China
 were indicative of this trend, falling steadily from a
 peak level of $700 million in 1980 to almost nothing in
 1984.

 China credits its experiment with market-oriented
 rural reforms for the agricultural gains, although we
 believe better-than-average weather and price in-
 creases also played important roles.' The contract
 responsibility system, which gave peasants effective
 control over acreage for periods of 15 years or more,
 clearly sparked rural enthusiasm. The government's
 1978 decision to hike procurement prices for agricul-
 tural products also contributed to output increases
 and led to improved rural living standards. With
 procurement prices now 40 percent higher than in
 1978, peasants have been willing to increase their use
 of fertilizer and other inputs, further boosting agricul-
 tural yields
 Beijing is also touting the reforms for their impact on
 rural employment. In pursuit of profits, an increasing
 number of unemployed and underemployed peasants
 have begun to engage in either commercial activities
 in the service sectors-opening restaurants, repairing
 shoes, making clothing, cutting hair, and so forth-or
 in production of handicraft items. Premier Zhao
 Ziyang recently stated that in rural areas in Guang-
 dong and southern Jiangsu some 60 to 80 percent of
 the rural labor force has moved into industrial, side-
 line, or service occupations. Because as much as two-
 thirds of China's rural labor force of 350 million may

 adjustments of 1979 and 1981 as part of the economic reform, the

 presently be surplus, Beijing hopes to achieve signifi-
 cant productivity gains as a result of this trend. By the
 end of the century the government plans to have about
 40 percent of the rural labor force engaged in nonag-
 Overall, the sharp gains have left the peasantry much
 better off than it was in 1978. Rural residents have
 seen their annual per capita income more than double
 over the period to about 300 yuan. Moreover, the gap
 between rural and urban living standards has nar-
 rowed significantly. Consumption by city residents
 rose at an annual rate of 7.2 percent between 1979
 and 1983, while rural consumption shot up 14.7
 percent annually. Consumer goods such as televisions,
 washing machines, watches, and fans are now begin-
 ning to find their way into the rural areas, albeit at a
 slower pace than the increasing rural demand.
 Energy and Transportation-Better Than Expected.
 The energy sector provided Chinese policymakers
 with what was perhaps the most pleasant surprise of
 recent years. Primary energy output rose 6.7 percent
 in 1983, the fastest pace in five years, and the increase
 in 1984 was probably closer to 8 percent. When
 energy saving measures are included, the gains come
 to more than 9 and 11 percent, respectively.
 Crude oil output, which hovered between 102 and 106
 million tons annually between 1978 and 1983, shot up
 8.5 percent in 1984 to a record 115 million tons.
 Production of coal, China's largest energy source, rose
 7.7 percent. Much of the increase in oil production
 came as a result of improved recovery processes and
 new finds in the Shengli and Daqing oilfields. Both oil
 and coal benefited from a new incentive system that
 allowed producers to market above-quota production
 at higher prices. New taxes on energy consumption
 and the higher prices for above-quota production
 contributed to China's still modest energy conserva-
 tion efforts. The only negative development. in the
 energy sector last year came in hydropower produc-
 tion, which remains at 1983 levels as a result of
 regional water shortages (see figure 1).

 The transportation sector also achieved good results
 when measured against the low level of resources that
 Beijing devoted to it over the past few years. The 7.6-
 percent increase in ton-kilometers of goods transport-
 ed in 1983 and the 10-percent gain last year came
 mainly from improved management of existing facili-
 ties. Burgeoning budget deficits starting in 1979
 forced Beijing to scale back its budgetary outlays, and
 investment in transportation was especially hard hit.
 The share of total investment in capital construction
 going to transportation and telecommunications
 dropped from an already low average of 18 percent in
 the 1971-75 period to 13 percent in 1976-80 and to 9
 percent in 1981. Beijing raised the proportion back up
 to 13 percent in 1983 and 14 percent last year, but
 clearly the rate of investment is far short of China's
 needs (see figure 2).
 Foreign Trade -A Growing Surplus. The foreign
 trade sector has grown significantly under China's
 open-door policy. Exports in 1983 rose only 2 percent
 to $24 billion, but rose nearly 15 percent in 1984 to a

 record $27 billion. Imports showed a 10-percent in-
 crease in 1983 before surging as much as 30 percent
 last year.' The $3-4 billion 1984 trade surplus was
 China's fourth consecutive large surplus, putting Bei-
 jing under increasing criticism from Western trading
 partners (see figure 3).
 Total foreign exchange holdings at yearend 1983
 amounted to an unprecedented $20 billion, 10th larg-
 est in the world and seventh largest if only foreign
 exchange is considered. Reserves continued to rise in
 1984. We estimate the debt service ratio last year was
 only about 5 to 6 percent, one of the world's lowest.
 Until late last year, Beijing had been exceedingly
 cautious about accumulating debt or spending its
 reserves, despite an obvious and growing need for
 Western technology. This reluctance to make major

 outlays for Western equipment stemmed from several
 factors, including Beijing's uncertainty about which
 projects warrant top priority, domestic financial prob-
 lems, and bureaucratic constraints on the use of
 foreign exchange. Beginning in November 1984, how-
 ever, Beijing launched a program to acquire Western
 equipment for development projects, signing more
 than $10 billion in contracts in the space of just three
 Industrial Performance-A Different Story. China's
 industrial performance, when measured in terms of
 total output, also appeared more than satisfactory.
 The total value of industrial output rose 10 percent in
 1983 and at an even faster clip of 14 percent in 1984,
 well ahead of the planned growth rates of 4 and 5
 percent, respectively. Half of total output originated
 in the light industrial sector-where China believes
 its major potential lies-as opposed to only 42 percent
 in 1978, when China began its experiments with
 industrial reform (see figure 4).

 Despite the apparent gains, Beijing considers its early
 industrial reforms a failure. The program was sup-
 posed to address serious problems of waste and ineffi-
 ciency, and Beijing openly declared its willingness to
 sacrifice growth while reforms worked their magic.
 The Sixth Five-Year Plan (1981-85) called for aver-
 age annual increases in industrial output of only 2.7
 percent, but demanded accompanying decreases in
 per unit output costs of 1 to 2 percent. Actual results
 so far, however, have shown industrial output growing
 at an 8.7-percent annual clip and costs actually rising
 in 1982 and 1983 before leveling off last year.
 Product quality has also failed to improve markedly
 under reform, and labor productivity in the industrial
 sector remains low. Furthermore, despite the five-year
 reform effort, one-fifth of China's industrial capacity
 is idled by electricity shortages, even while China's
 enterprises use, by some estimates, as much as three

 and a half times more energy per unit output than the
 average LDC. Much of the output produced at this
 high cost is shoddy and outdated. For example, only
 10 percent of the machinery and equipment produced
 is up to modern standards; the rest, the Chinese claim,
 is 1950s and 1960s vintage.
 Mounting Problems Associated With Reform. A host
 of serious new economic problems arose in the wake of
 piecemeal reform policies. Early efforts to devolve
 decisionmaking authority to the factory level, for
 example, threatened to untrack China's high-priority
 infrastructure investment program. Enterprise man-
 agers, using their authority to make capital invest-
 ment decisions, ignored government pleas to hold the
 line on industrial investment. Between 1979 and 1982,
 extrabudgetary investment in capital construction
 more than doubled to 28 billion yuan before leveling
 off in 1983 and 1984. The increase not only drained
 funds needed for infrastructure investment, it also left
 China short of cement, glass, and other construction
 supplies. Furthermore, much of the investment money
 flowed into housing construction, which did little for
 China's productive capacity. Where extrabudgetary
 investment went to machinery and equipment, in
 many cases it was for small projects that, when
 operational, began attracting raw materials needed by
 larger, more efficient state-run enterprises.
 More serious, in the view of some Chinese leaders, the
 failure of the initial industrial reforms also threatened
 to limit China's long-term growth potential. Beijing
 was counting on productivity gains from industrial
 reform to offset the impact that falling investment
 rates would otherwise have on long-term growth. But
 this has not happened. With the sharp upswing in
 residential building, nominal investment in productive
 assets has risen at only a 5.6-percent annual pace
 since 1979, compared with 9.8-percent growth in
 nominal national income (see figure 5)
 Efforts to decentralize decisionmaking authority cre-
 ated financial problems that also threatened the re-
 form program. The fiscally conservative government
 had to reconcile itself to five consecutive budget
 deficits between 1979 and 1983 totaling about 58
 billion yuan. Another deficit, perhaps as large as 6
 billion yuan, is anticipated this year. Treasury bonds

 were used to help finance the red ink without resort-
 ing to the inflationary printing of money, but the
 government has grown increasingly concerned about
 its inability to balance revenues and expenditures.F
 On the revenue side, budget shortfalls stemmed in
 part from the decision to cut back growth in heavy
 industry, the major revenue generator. When heavy
 industrial output leveled off in 1980 and then declined
 in 1981, revenues suffered. And when the government
 tried to spark productivity by introducing a tax
 system that would allow enterprises to retain more of
 their profits, many enterprises began understating
 profits and overstating costs to avoid tax payment.
 The China Audit Administration, set up in September
 1983 to monitor the situation, found errors and
 violations amounting to more than 600 million yuan in
 its first year of operation.

 Even successful agricultural reforms compounded fi-
 nancial problems on the expenditure side. Procure-
 ment prices for agricultural products were increased
 sharply beginning in 1979 to boost rural incomes,
 while consumer prices for those products went rela-
 tively unchanged. The result was a huge gap requiring
 more than 140 billion yuan in price subsidies between
 1979 and 1983. Price subsidies alone took nearly one-
 fourth of total state revenue by 1983 and more than
 offset the defense and investment cutbacks that were
 part of the government's budget-balancing efforts
 between 1980 and 1982. The problem probably wors-
 ened in 1984, given the further surge in agricultural
 output.
 The inability of the urban reforms to keep pace with
 rural changes also threatens to undermine recent
 agricultural gains. The sharp increases in grain and
 cotton output began surpassing Chinese commercial
 distribution capabilities in late 1983. By 1984 most
 major grain-producing provinces had sizable stock-
 piles of grain rotting outside storage facilities. Jilin
 Province, for example, has reported that it now has 5
 million tons of unwanted grain.
 Factors Behind China's Mistakes
 Given the magnitude of the changes Beijing intro-
 duced, the emergence of serious problems was not
 surprising. But, on several counts, the government's
 piecemeal approach exacerbated existing difficulties.
 For example, rather than introducing a comprehen-
 sive, well-considered program, the industrial manage-
 ment reforms began as an experiment and then spread
 almost of their own volition. In 1979 about 4,000
 enterprises throughout the country were allowed to
 experiment with decentralized decisionmaking. Less
 than a year later, 16 percent of all enterprises under
 the state budget-producing 60 percent of the total
 value of output and earning 70 percent of the prof-
 its-had been given expanded decisionmaking author-
 ity. In our view, neither party officials nor central
 authorities were prepared to surrender authority on
 such a large scale on such short notice. Misunder-
 standing and bureaucratic infighting became major
 problems.
 question the government's commitment to reform and,
 hence, slowed implementation. For example, the gov-
 ernment repeatedly altered its tax policy and demon-
 strated a great deal of uncertainty over how much
 autonomy local-level enterprises should have in dis-
 tributing bonuses and in making investment decisions.
 For factory managers who survived China's Cultural
 Revolution by resisting any policy changes that devi-
 ated from orthodox Marxism, the government's vacil-
 lation was a signal to go slowly in implementing
 change.
 Beijing's most serious problem in promoting a transi-
 tion to a more market-oriented economy was its
 failure to come to grips with its irrational price
 structure. Aside from the financial problems this
 generated, the price structure-large parts of which
 date from the 1950s-conveyed no meaningful infor-
 mation on which economic decisions could be made.
 Since prices bore little relationship to production
 costs, enterprise losses were not necessarily attribut-
 able to either inefficiency or lack of demand. Beijing's
 insistence, therefore, that enterprises make profits had
 little realistic effect, as the government had no criteria
 for determining which enterprises should be forced
 into bankruptcy. By yearend 1983, one-fourth of all
 state enterprises were operating in the red.
 Outdated fixed prices, moreover, meant that firms
 had no means of assessing their most profitable
 economic endeavors. Enterprises producing high-
 priced goods requiring cheap inputs, for instance,
 made large profits regardless of efficiency or product
 quality. Arbitrarily high Chinese procurement prices
 on rolled steel, for example, guaranteed 20- to 30-
 percent profit margins on many products, regardless
 of quality, with some profit margins as high as 60 to
 70 percent. Even when there was no consumer de-
 mand for a firm's output, profits were assured by the
 state's practice of procuring the commodity at the
 arbitrarily established price. A study of 32 enterprises
 in Liaoning Province disclosed that 47 percent of all
 goods produced in 1983 were unmarketable or already
 overstocked; inventories of rolled steel nationwide
 reportedly now exceed 20 million tons. At the same
 Lacking a comprehensive plan, Beijing was forced
 early to make major alterations in the reform pro-
 gram. The frequent changes led factory managers to

 time, the production of many important, but low-
 priced, industrial materials (especially iron ore, pig
 iron, and cement) and popular consumer goods (nota-
 bly cotton clothing and furniture) began declining
 despite strong demand, because such items yielded
 little or no profit.
 Nor could China's banking system help in the transi-
 tion. During the Cultural Revolution the People's
 Bank of China operated primarily as a cashier/
 accountant for the Ministry of Finance. The major
 function of the bank was to transfer funds at the
 Ministry's bidding. Loans were made to meet plans
 regardless of the borrower's financial status or the
 expected rate of return of the project. Interest charges
 were held low, when assessed at all, and repayment
 was seldom enforced. The upshot of this policy was
 intense pressure from enterprises to secure funds for
 investment, without regard to the possible financial
 returns.
 Finally, the environment in which the seeds of indus-
 trial reform were sown was much more hostile to
 change than that of the agrarian sector. Rural re-
 forms gave agricultural decision making authority
 back to the farmer, but urban reforms handed author-
 ity to factory managers who were ill equipped for
 their jobs. Most acquired their positions on the basis
 of political criteria, not managerial talent. They
 lacked both the education and the expertise necessary
 to function in a competitive environment. Hence, it
 was not surprising that, for example, when Beijing
 gave managers the power to reward outstanding work
 with bonuses, payments were usually made on an
 egalitarian basis, across the board.
 Pushing Ahead With Reform-
 The 1984 Policy Shift
 Economic policy has been highly contentious political-
 ly, and serious disagreements over reform reached all
 the way to the Politburo Standing Committee
 Politburo elders Chen Yun
 and Li Xiannian favored a gradual approach to
 economic change, with extensive reliance on compre-
 hensive central plans, supplemented in a very minor
 way by market forces. This approach was also clearly
 favored by most of China's economic administrators
 and planners. Premier Zhao Ziyang and party Gener-
 al Secretary Hu Yaobang, supported by many of
 China's leading economists, however, favored a more
 radical approach. They insisted that many of the
 problems associated with earlier reforms came about
 because the measures had not gone far enough in
 freeing up market forces. Hence, they favored more
 sweeping institutional changes to support reforms
 already in place.
 This debate-carried on from about 1980 to 1983-   25X1
 gave China's economic policies something of a seesaw
 character and adversely affected the implementation
 of even agreed-upon policies. In 1983 it appeared that
 conservative opponents of reform were in command.
 The economic literature focused on the importance of
 planning and on the "supplementary" role that the
 market should play.
 In early 1984, however, the political momentum
 shifted decisively in favor of the reformers. Several
 factors account for this change. The backlash against
 the conservative-backed campaign to "eliminate spiri-
 tual pollution" in late 1983 benefited Hu Yaobang
 and other party "liberals," while damaging the repu-
 tations of elderly conservatives, such as Chen Yun.
 Hu and Zhao took their case to the provinces in early
 1984 and generated a good deal of local party enthusi-
 asm for expanded reform. Most important, Deng
 Xiaoping reiterated his support for economic and
 political reform and gave the State Council and
 Secretariat the wherewithal to develop and implement
 new policies
 In January, Beijing issued Central Document No. 1, a
 comprehensive summary of rural reform measures
 and a clear call to expand the reforms. It gave more
 opportunities to farmers to engage in commerce and
 "commodity production." In April the State Council
 issued new regulations permitting factories and com-
 mercial enterprises to experiment with new wage
 programs. Less than a month later, the "Provisional
 Regulations on Greater Freedom for State-Owned
 Industrial Enterprises" were published, giving enter-
 prises the right to:
 ? Produce whatever goods are in short supply after
 fulfilling state plans.

 ? Adjust retail prices for industrial machinery within
 a range of 20 percent around the state price.
 ? Decide what share of their income will go to
 production, expansion, reserves, or bonuses.
 ? Recruit technical specialists directly and develop
 pay standards.
 Although many of these measures were little more
 than restatements of policies Beijing had experiment-
 ed with during the previous three years, they signaled
 a renewed commitment to industrial reform
 Zhao Ziyang's address to the May 1984 session of the
 National People's Congress (NPC) gave official con-
 firmation to the policy shift. After a brief note of
 praise for agricultural reforms, Zhao devoted most of
 his speech to the "urgent" need for "quickening"
 reform in the cities. Specifically, Zhao called for:
 ? Implementation of the second stage of China's tax
 reform program to give enterprises even greater
 financial autonomy.
 ? Experimental restructuring of the managerial sys-
 tem in the construction industry, replacing financial
 appropriations with bank loans, using public bidding
 procedures to issue contracts, and revamping the
 material distribution system to alleviate shortages.
 ? Better utilization of educated technicians in the
 planning and management process in enterprises.
 ? Reform of the commodity circulation system to
 facilitate the flow of goods between town and
 country, and the exchange of goods between differ-
 ent regions.
 About the same time, various Chinese media were
 publishing articles calling for experiments with
 market-oriented practices, such as forcing state banks
 to compete against each other for deposit and loan
 business, and allowing domestic enterprises to issue
 stocks, bonds, and other securities. Perhaps the most
 notable shift, however, was the emergence of a host of
 articles, by economists as well as policymakers, advo-
 cating an early resolution of the price problem. Prior
 to this-despite the view widely held by Western and
 Chinese economists alike that the entire experiment
 with market tools could not succeed within the frame-
 work of China's irrational prices-only the most
 daring advocates of economic reform suggested mov-
 ing quickly to tackle the potentially explosive issue of
 price reform.
 Changing the Planning Apparatus-State Council
 Regulations. In early October the State Council
 issued "Provisional Regulations Regarding the Im-
 provement of the Planning System," which called for
 a sweeping overhaul of China's planning apparatus.
 Although the document itself remains publicly un-
 available, it is clear from Chinese press accounts that
 the State Council used the regulations to attack one of
 the main sources of economic inefficiency in China,
 overcentralizationJ
 The regulations called for a drastic reduction in the
 number of commodities controlled by mandatory state
 plans. Only about 60 industrial goods and fewer than
 10 agricultural and sideline products will be subject to
 state purchase quotas in 1985,' compared with more
 than 250 controlled goods in 1980. Provincial authori-
 ties, taking their cue from Beijing, are also cutting
 back on the number of goods they control under
 mandatory plans. Hubei, for example, reported that
 mandatory plans now apply to only 43 products
 compared with 177 products in the past. Most goods
 are from now on subject to "guidance plans," where
 the state or local authorities recommend output levels
 and use economic levers-tax incentives, interest
 rates, lending policies, and so forth-to encourage
 enterprises to reach preestablished goals, but where
 enterprises may for economic reasons ignore govern-
 ment goals without fear of reprisal. In addition, the
 regulations allow production of certain agricultural
 goods to be determined totally by market forces.
 Enterprises engaging in foreign trade or seeking for-
 eign capital were to adhere to guidance plans giving
 them greater flexibility in their negotiations with
 foreigners. The state, however, retained a significant
 ' China recently published a partial list of the commodities subject
 to mandatory plans. Included were coal, oil and petroleum prod-
 ucts, steel, nonferrous metals, timber, cement, chemicals, electric-
 ity, munitions, and other items. Agricultural products on the list
 included cereals, cotton, edible oils, tobacco, pigs, and some aquatic

 amount of control by dictating that all foreign ex-
 change transactions must be carried out through the
 state-run Bank of China and, hence, are subject to the
 bank's tacit approval.
 Beijing also reaffirmed its commitment to tight con-
 trol over domestic investment decisions-a power it
 temporarily lost in 1981 when extrabudgetary invest-
 ment surged despite government efforts to hold it in
 check. The Provisional Regulations required that the
 general scale of investment in fixed assets must grow
 according to a state-set schedule. Although enter-
 prises continue to have some authority to borrow and
 to draw on a portion of retained profits for investment
 purposes, the new planning apparatus clearly calls for
 much stronger government leverage in investment
 decisions.
 The Party's Endorsement-The Third Plenum. Per-
 haps the reformers' crowning achievement of 1984,
 the strongest evidence of their increasing strength,
 came during the Third Plenary Session of the Com-
 munist Party's 12th Central Committee. After six
 days of "preparatory meetings," the one-day plenum
 endorsed a comprehensive "Decision on Reform of the
 Economic Structure," a document encapsulating the
 bulk of the earlier changes." Although the decision is
 neither a major turning point in economic policy nor a
 surprising announcement of some historic new trend,
 it does represent a political decision to throw the
 entire weight of the party behind reform of the
 economic structure.
 The major aspects of reform that the party committed
 itself to in the plenum document are:
 ? Instituting rational prices.
 ? Carrying out the planning changes introduced in the
 State Council regulations earlier in the month.
 ? Removing state and party bureaucrats from most
 day-to-day business decisions.
 ? Expanding enterprise managers' responsibility and
 accountability in hiring, firing, finance, and produc-
 tion practices
 Although the new program calls for a weakening of
 the role played by state bureaucracies, their power,
 nevertheless, remains significant. In addition to the
 continued importance of the central planning appara-    25X1
 tus and strict control over products of national impor-
 tance, the state will continue to appoint and remove
 key enterprise managers and thus exert a powerful, if
 indirect, influence on production decisions. Moreover,
 when enterprises experience financial problems, the
 state will determine which firms will be subsidized
 and which will be forced to merge or shut down.F__1
 The plenum marked the end of the party's reluc-    25X1
 tance-perhaps for fear of sparking potentially desta-
 bilizing inflation, hoarding, and speculation-to come
 to grips with the problem of irrational prices. Con-
 cluding that failure to deal with the price structure      25X1
 would jeopardize the entire reform program, the
 plenum document explicitly recommended establish-
 ment of a "rational price system," calling it the key to
 reform of the entire economic structure. The fact that
 Beijing hopes to have its irrational price system
 "basically" corrected in only five years is an indica-
 tion of the party's commitment to rapid reform.
 The Short-Term Outlook
 Beijing views 1985 as a critical year in its overall
 reform effort. Likening the series of measures
 launched in late 1984 to an all-out war on economic
 problems, a recent front page People's Daily article
 called 1985 the first battle, which, if not carried out
 successfully, "greatly increases the difficulties in fu-     25X1
 ture combat."
 bly not yet been strongly felt.
 Structural changes that Beijing now has on the books
 to rectify problems in the industrial sector came too
 late to have a direct impact on the economy in 1984,
 and it is not clear how important they will be in 1985.
 The shift of emphasis to urban reform was only about
 six months old by yearend 1984, and most of the
 major policy changes, particularly price and wage
 reform, are still not in place. Even important pro-
 grams that Beijing has been planning for some time,
 such as the effort to substitute tax payment for profit
 delivery, were new enough that their effect has proba-

 Nevertheless, we believe that Beijing is already expe-
 riencing minor benefits from its bureaucratic reforms
 and that in 1985 productivity gains will be even more
 apparent. Some improvement will come from intangi-
 ble factors, such as success in replacing aging party,
 state, and enterprise bureaucrats with younger, better
 educated leaders. The appearance of unity at the top
 that the party conveyed in 1984 by being able to push
 through major reforms should also help enlist the
 support of the many midlevel bureaucrats who previ-
 ously resisted or ignored reform on the assumption
 that it would be short lived. Once this group turns its
 attention to increasing profits and limiting losses,
 some efficiency gains are possible even without major
 structural change.
 Given the more competitive climate and the adminis-
 trative emphasis on economic results, further strong
 gains in industrial output are probable again this
 year. A vice chairman of the State Economic Com-
 mission recently told Western businessmen that GNP
 would probably rise between 8 and 10 percent in
 1985. As pressure from Beijing builds, the share of
 enterprises operating in the red should decline, al-
 though we estimate at least 10 percent of state-run
 enterprises are probably dependent on price reform to
 push them into the black. Another sharp increase in
 energy output also appears probable. Beijing expects
 oil, coal, natural gas, and total electricity output each
 to hit new records in 1985.
 Predicting agricultural output-always difficult be-
 cause of the importance of the weather-may be
 especially hazardous in 1985 in light of policy changes
 that have been announced since the beginning of the
 year. The burden that China's grain subsidies have
 placed on the domestic budget has made Beijing
 somewhat ambivalent about recent record harvests.
 To alleviate the financial problem and to slow the
 buildup of unusable grain inventories in the country-
 side-where the inadequate commercial and transpor-
 tation systems have limited Beijing's procurement
 capabilities-Beijing is initiating a program that
 would effectively lower the price paid for above-quota
 grain production. In addition, the government has
 adopted measures that require peasants to take on a
 greater share of the burden of transporting and
 marketing all types of agricultural output. Both poli-
 cies will have a dampening effect on production which
 could be felt beginning in 1985. It is unclear, however,
 whether this effect will offset the positive factors that
 led to the major increases in output over the past five
 years.
 As Beijing moves to implement its difficult structural
 changes, other major dislocations are probable. The
 next two years will see the Chinese economy in the
 midst of transition between tight central planning and
 a more market-oriented socialism. During this period
 Beijing may find itself in the worst of both worlds.
 Introducing rational prices into China's shortage-
 driven economy probably is the most essential element
 of the current reform and, at the same time, the
 element posing the most immediate threat-inflation.
 The plenum's call for price reform reportedly sparked
 a few bank runs and some panic buying late last year,
 despite government assurances that prices would be
 adjusted slowly and that consumer income would not
 be allowed to suffer. The potential for trouble in-
 creased markedly in 1983 as urban and rural consum-
 ers, unable to satisfy their demands because of short-
 ages, increased savings by a sharp 32 percent.
 Preliminary data show a further 18-percent rise last
 year to more than 100 billion yuan, five times the
 prereform 1978 level. As Beijing attempts to bring
 prices in line with costs for essential goods such as
 cereals, industrial raw materials, and coal, Chinese
 savers may generate considerable inflationary pres-
 sures by attempting to turn their massive deposits into
 consumer goods and housing.
 Beijing is committed to immediate price adjustment,
 but it also clearly recognizes the potential for panic
 that price reform raises and will move deliberately to
 implement changes.' In fact, we believe the risk that
 the leadership will move too slowly with essential
 price adjustments (and stall the entire reform pack-
 age) is as great as the risk that too rapid an advance
 will spark economic instability. Nevertheless, it is safe
 to assume that price reform will be somewhat infla-
 tionary in the short run. Most adjustments will proba-
 bly be upward, and important products such as coal,

 Xiaoping on the method of implementing price reform, saying, "We

 oil, and certain foodstuffs will eventually have to
 undergo steep revisions. The reforms may occasionally
 spark bouts of panic buying to which Beijing will most
 probably respond by limiting bank withdrawals, by
 ordering producers to hold the line on prices, by
 ordering consumers to limit buying, and by raising
 interest rates and taxes to discourage consumption.
 Another economic hurdle that the leadership must
 cross in the immediate future is the question of
 enterprise bankruptcy. In 1983, nearly one-fourth of
 China's industrial enterprises were unprofitable, and
 last year, even after the government exerted strong
 pressure for improvement, 16 percent were still oper-
 ating in the red. Clearly, Beijing cannot allow a
 massive shutdown of such a large portion of its
 industrial base. Furthermore, until reform is in place,
 there is no effective way of determining which enter-
 prises deserve closing. Despite the fact that subsidiza-
 tion of losing enterprises encourages inefficient behav-
 ior all around, we believe Beijing will probably be
 cautious and allow a large number of inefficient firms
 to continue to operate.
 Where the government decides some firms must be
 forced to close, the accompanying unemployment
 problems may be locally destabilizing. The Chinese
 have built up an impressive array of controls-includ-
 ing housing and food rations and tough employment
 restrictions-to prohibit the free movement of popula-
 tion from the countryside to the cities and from
 smaller, poorer cities to larger, more wealthy ones.
 Beijing is now attempting to relax these restrictions
 somewhat to encourage labor mobility, but the barri-
 ers are coming down slowly. For the near future, if
 major industries are allowed to fold, certain geograph-
 ic areas could face high unemployment rates. We
 believe this unemployment threat will reinforce Bei-
 jing's inclination to go slowly and to accept temporary
 inefficiency.
 In light of these and other serious problems-the
 shortage of trained administrators and technicians,
 continued population pressures, inadequate transport
 and communications systems-we do not expect the
 short-run benefits of urban reform to match those
 experienced under the agricultural reform program.
 But neither does Beijing. The government is allowing
 itself five years to get the program in place and
 probably will hail even minor improvements in effi-
 ciency during that period as evidence of progress. The
 fact that Beijing is going into this program with its
 economic eyes open increases the probability of suc-
 cess.
 Longer Term Prospects
 The Agricultural Sector-More Gains. Despite prob-
 lems that agricultural surpluses have created, Beijing
 realizes that its per capita consumption of food prod-
 ucts is still one of the lowest worldwide, and it is eager
 to pursue policies that will boost long-term output.
 How successful the Chinese will be in this regard
 depends critically on several factors. In agriculture
 many of the productivity gains accompanying the
 introduction of the contract responsibility system were
 onetime achievements. Future gains will probably
 come more slowly as farmers gradually introduce new
 technology and as marginal land is better utilized.
 Weather will also remain a major unknown. Although
 Beijing's 1983 gains came in the wake of one of the
 worst weather years in recent times, in general the
 reform years have met with better-than-average
 weather. We believe that consecutive years of wide-
 spread natural disaster could cut crop yields dramati-
 cally, especially if laborers under the contract respon-
 sibility system resist leaving their own plots to engage
 in irrigation system repair or rescue operations that
 may not be directly beneficial to them.
 Other factors, however, bode well for continued im-
 provement in agricultural productivity. China is now
 investigating methods of educating its peasant popula-
 tion on agrotechnology advances that have occurred
 over the past two decades. Agricultural extension
 services are trying to popularize more effective use of
 pesticides and compound fertilizers. Beijing is using
 economic levers to encourage peasants to grow crops
 most suitable for their regions and to use modern
 equipment. Purchases of farm machinery are on the
 rise, showing nearly a 12-percent increase in 1984.
 The number of tractors, combines, and trucks in-
 volved in agricultural production has more than dou-
 bled since 1979. In addition, the rapid increase in
 production of consumer durables will continue to

 motivate Chinese farmworkers. Commercial reforms
 that speed the delivery of farm goods to urban
 markets and urban goods (including fertilizers, ma-
 chinery, and consumer goods) to the rural sector will
 also help
 On the whole we believe the positive factors outweigh
 the negative, and we anticipate long-term gains in the
 value of agricultural output of about 5 percent per
 year. The gains should enable Beijing in most years to
 devote the bulk of its foreign exchange reserves to
 equipment and technology rather than to agricultural
 imports. Nevertheless, as both rural and urban in-
 comes expand, food consumption will also rise. Beijing
 expects an especially sharp increase in demand for
 meats and processed foods. This-combined with the
 massive problem China already has in moving grain to
 urban consumers-will, we believe, result in contin-
 ued purchases of US grain, even in years of better-
 than-average weather. Poor climatic conditions in
 consecutive years would probably deplete grain re-
 serves and bring China back into world markets in a
 big way.
 Industry-Major Obstacles Ahead. Long-term suc-
 cess in the industrial sector depends heavily on how
 fast and effectively some of the new reforms can be
 implemented. Despite Deng's efforts, there is still
 considerable opposition within the party bureaucracy
 to further expansion of the reforms. There are those
 with grave ideological reservations about the program
 and those who fear that Deng's concomitant demand
 that the party upgrade the expertise of party leaders,
 as well as enterprise managers, will cost them their
 jobs. Their fears were justified in mid-1984 when
 Organization Department Chief Qiao Shi stated that
 40 percent of all managers and 70 percent of all party
 committee members in 3,000 key enterprises would be
 replaced this year. Because the task of implementing
 new reforms rests heavily on these midlevel cadres, we
 expect progress to be neither smooth nor rapid, as
 they seek by various bureaucratic methods to impede
 the progress of changes they view as threatening
 Beijing already has achieved some success in remov-
 ing party cadres from the economic decision making
 process and installing trained technicians in their
 place. Hu Yaobang recently told
 posts since the government began its efforts to up-
 grade its managerial expertise and 2 million were to
 have retired by yearend 1984. Further progress in this
 political aspect of reform will improve the chances for
 overall success.
 Other institutional changes needed to buttress re-
 forms will probably continue to develop slowly. De-
 spite major reforms in the banking system, there is
 evidence that local pressures, not economic factors,
 continue to determine the direction of loans. And,
 despite Beijing's decision to replace budgetary alloca-
 tions with loans, only about one-third of the funds
 used for production come from banks. This suggests
 that, although improvements have been achieved,
 enterprises still lack the incentives necessary to force
 them to make efficient investment decisions. The
 productivity of capital is unlikely to show marked
 improvements until Beijing achieves better results
 with its banking reform.
 Efforts to revitalize the commercial system may
 generate considerable efficiency gains. The difficul-
 ties that stem from China's inadequate road and rail
 system are compounded by bureaucratic problems
 that accompany tight state control over transport
 activities. Although it would take a massive invest-
 ment program to eliminate China's transportation
 problems, we believe that the increased involvement
 of individuals and cooperative enterprises in middle-
 man activities will alleviate a significant number of
 the distribution problems that now plague Chinese
 industries.
 We anticipate that, over the longer term, if the reform
 program can be successfully implemented, devolution
 of the decisionmaking authority for hiring, firing,
 wages, and prices to managers will improve enterprise
 efficiency. As more enterprises are required to market
 their own products, quality will undoubtedly improve
 and a wider variety of goods can be expected on
 Chinese markets. Because small firms producing non-
 essential goods will be given the most leeway, they
 will probably be the first to show marked improve-
 ments. Progress within large, state-run enterprises

 producing major goods will, we believe, occur more
 slowly)
 Despite some short-term problems as the government
 carries out price adjustment policies, we do not believe
 there is major risk of serious long-term inflation. For
 this to occur, the government would have to be willing
 to sustain the increases in consumer demand by
 printing money. Although some subsidies or wage
 increases will be offered in the early stages of the
 adjustment process-to help ease concerns about
 eroding purchasing power-the fiscally conservative
 government is unlikely to resort to long-term use of
 the printing press to finance consumer spending.
 We see the next few years as providing the critical test
 of the program's survivability. If Beijing can cope
 with the major economic obstacles that are already
 beginning to appear, without resorting to the direct
 controls used in the past, then we believe the reform
 program may develop an impetus difficult to stop. In
 the meantime, however, it is not difficult to envision a
 series of circumstances that could derail the current
 program and lead the Chinese leadership to fall back
 to the more tightly controlled structure that existed
 prior to 1979.
 On the whole, we believe the current reform will lead
 to some efficiency gains as early as next year. Al-
 though Beijing will probably be disappointed at the
 rate of progress, the fact that the economy is moving
 in the right direction, under a constant political
 climate, should give impetus to further change, lead-
 ing to longer term productivity increases and stronger
 economic growth. Government efforts to encourage
 surplus labor to take up private commerce and service
 activities have considerable potential for increasing
 both agricultural and industrial productivity. The
 renewed emphasis on enterprise autonomy also bodes
 well for productivity increases, some of which will go
 unobserved in Beijing as enterprises attempt to under-
 state profits to avoid taxes.
 Whither Reform-Not Irreversible Yet
 In the wake of the increasingly bold and successful
 Chinese economic policies, there has been a growing
 tendency on the part of Western observers to view the
 reforms as irreversible. We do not share this view.
 Only a few elements of the reform program-for
 example, the dismantling of the communes and insti-
 tution of the contract responsibility system-have
 been implemented successfully enough that their effi-
 cacy is no longer questioned by Chinese both inside
 and outside the party. Most economic changes-
 including price, management, banking, and tax re-
 forms, as well as the opening up of the 14 coastal
 cities to Western business-remain controversial and
 unproven, and therefore vulnerable to political set-
 back.
 The Best Case Scenario-And Some Indicators. Un-
 der the best of circumstances China's recent decisions     25X1
 to lower average procurement prices and to involve
 peasants in the distribution process would lead to a
 lessening of the financial burden that government
 procurement practices now impose without too precip-
 itous a decline in output of major agricultural prod-
 ucts. Temporary surges in retail prices are inevitable
 under the new agricultural program, and opponents of
 reform will be watching, with great interest, urban
 workers' reaction to the increases. If consumers ac-
 cept the rises without forcing Beijing to offer large
 budget-damaging subsidies, reformers will have fur-
 ther strengthened their contention that macroeconom-
 ic behavior can be controlled using economic levers
 rather than direct state intervention.
 A lessening of the financial burden of agricultural         25X1
 subsidies would place the government in an even
 better position to confront dislocations in the industri-
 al sector. Ideally, Beijing would begin early to ration-
 alize its major industrial prices. Energy prices will be
 among the toughest to adjust because of their impact
 on nearly every sector of the economy, but early steps     25X1
 at upward adjustment would be a positive sign of
 Beijing's desire to make its new program work. Fur-
 ther relaxation of price controls on minor industrial
 goods-allowing them to fluctuate somewhat in re-
 sponse to market conditions-would also bode well for
 the future of reform.
 In the best case, Beijing would be able to limit the
 inflationary impact of its price adjustments by com-
 bining them with effective fiscal and monetary poli-
 cies. Higher interest rates, limited growth in the

 Confidential
 money supply, and increased product taxes will have
 to be Beijing's primary methods of control. Continued
 experimentation with these tools should be viewed as
 a positive sign. Too quick or too heavy a reliance on
 direct government intervention would have an adverse
 impact on the reform program.
 Even before its price structure becomes "rational"-a
 process that in the best of circumstances may take a
 decade-Beijing must increase pressure on state-run
 enterprises to operate more efficiently. Ironically,
 perhaps the most positive sign of progress in this area
 would be an increase in the number of forced plant
 closings. This would demonstrate that Beijing is will-
 ing to accept increased rates of unemployment while
 modern factories replace outmoded ones over the
 transition period. Of course, any increased unemploy-
 ment would have to be carefully managed in order to
 avoid major labor problems.
 A further increase in imports of foreign machinery-
 provided it comes within China's financial and tech-
 nological capabilities-would also be a positive sign.
 With its industrial base outmoded and periodically
 idled by energy shortages and its transportation sector
 in disarray, Beijing is in need of large amounts of
 Western equipment and technology. A sustained ma-
 jor import program would be a sign of confidence and
 probably would also have positive spillover effects on
 China's joint venture policy. Western reluctance to
 move rapidly into management deals with Chinese
 firms may dissipate once China becomes viewed as a
 major import market.
 A final positive sign of the reforms' staying power
 would be further increases in the share of total output
 produced or transported by individual entrepreneurs.
 In our view, China must rely on this budding commer-
 cial sector to remedy commodity circulation problems
 that will be with China until its transportation system
 can undergo major modernization.
 The Worst Case. Under a worst case scenario, eco-
 nomic problems that are already beginning to surface
 would deepen and spread in a fashion difficult to
 control except by direct government intervention.
 Fear of price instability permeates the Chinese eco-
 nomic bureaucracy, and too serious a public reaction
 to price reform would threaten the entire program.
 Recurring bouts of panic buying, bank runs, and, in
 the extreme, public disorder are all capable of doing
 the reform program irreparable harm.
 Sharply increased budget deficits would further
 heighten the concerns of policymakers about long-
 term inflation. Chinese economists approach price
 theory from a monetarist point of view and, hence, are
 extremely concerned when currency in circulation
 shows any kind of sharp upward trend. If recent
 agricultural policies fail to ease China's subsidization
 problem and if the movement to institute tax pay-
 ments instead of profit deliveries takes an unexpected-
 ly large bite out of Chinese revenues,' the budget
 deficit could burgeon from levels the Chinese already
 consider too high. Even the most reform-minded
 Chinese economist would be reluctant to advocate
 further change in the face of budget deficits ap-
 proaching the 1979 level of 20 billion yuan. Advocates
 of a return to tighter central control would press their
 case with renewed vigor and would use mounting
 deficits as evidence that the reformers had miscalcu-
 lated.
 Other economic problems-which by themselves are
 probably not capable of triggering any major policy
 reversals, but which in conjunction with the more
 serious problems discussed above could tip the scales
 in favor of a return to tight central control-include:
 ? Mounting economic crime-including bribery,
 fraud, tax evasion, and so forth-at all levels of
 management and within the party. The Chinese
 leadership is especially sensitive to this issue be-
 cause it lends credence to critics arguing that the
 reforms are capitalist.
 ? Consecutive years of poor weather which would
 deprive the reformers of their most powerful evi-
 dence of the efficacy of reform, the striking achieve-
 ments in agriculture. -

 ? Deteriorating terms of trade and increasing imports
 of goods that Beijing considers wasteful (consumer
 goods, duplicate purchases of machinery and equip-
 ment, and so forth) as a result of further foreign
 trade decentralization.
 ? Increased popular unrest over growing income dis-
 parities and the sudden acquisition of wealth by a
 small minority of entrepreneurs.
 ? Local unemployment problems caused by a failure
 to manage labor cutbacks well in the name of
 increased efficiency.
 The difficulty China's reformers will have in coping
 with these problems would be exacerbated greatly by
 the early death or incapacitation of Deng Xiaoping.
 Although, by his own admission, Deng no longer
 involves himself in the day-to-day management of
 economic policy, his importance to the reformers
 cannot be overstated. The recent acceleration in the
 pace of reform indicates that Deng has thrown his
 political influence behind the new economic policies
 and that he is, for the time being at least, unwilling to
 compromise with more conservative leaders such as
 Chen Yun.
 Even under a worst case scenario in which the
 reformers are forced to give up ground, we do not
 envision a swing all the way back to the austere,
 centrally administered, and self-reliant policies of the
 Mao era. Deng appears to have rid the upper echelons
 of the party apparatus of supporters of extreme
 centralism. Many of those presently opposing addi-
 tional reform were themselves branded "capitalist" in
 the early 1960s. Policies they advocated then called
 for some reliance on market mechanisms, albeit on a
 much smaller scale than is currently recommended.
 Most of these leaders, if thrust into the topmost
 position, would continue to pursue exchanges with the
 West, although perhaps some of the more progressive
 policies, such as the opening of the 14 coastal cities to
 foreign commerce, might be discontinued under a
 more cautious leadership.
