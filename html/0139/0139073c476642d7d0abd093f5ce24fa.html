 The People's Republic of China is one of the
 largest countries in the world, with a territory
 (9,597,000 square  kilometres)  nearly the  size of
 Europe and a population of about 500 million.
 China represents an unrivalled continuity of culture
 and nationhood of 5,000 years.  Chinese ancient in-
 ventions include the compass, paper manufacturing,
 printing from blocks and from movable type, and
 gun powder.
 For many centuries Chinese society found itself
 under the  yoke  of feudalism.  Feudalism was  so
 deep-rooted that it remained unchanged until foreign
 capitalism began to penetrate the country a little
 more than 100 years ago, which had the effect of
 turning China into a semi-feudal and semi-colonial
 country.
 Britain waged the Opium War against China in
 1840, which was followed by similar aggressive wars
 waged jointly by Britain and France in 1857, by
 France in 1884, by Japan in 1894; and by the com-
 bined forces of eight countries  (Britain, Russia,
 France, Germany, the United States, Japan, Italy,

 and Austria) in 1900. As a result, China was reduced
 from an independent state to a semi-independent
 state, that is,  a  semi-colony jointly  controlled by
 imperialist powers.
 Imperialist invasion caused  tremendous social
 and economic changes in China. The self-supporting
 economy characteristic of feudal society was dis-
 rupted.  Capitalist production appeared in China in
 the latter half of the 19th century, and together with
 it, the Chinese proletariat and the Chinese bour-
 geoisie.  Of the Chinese bourgeoisie, the bureaucratic
 comprador capitalists were supporters of foreign im-
 perialism in China because their interests were iden-
 tical; but the national bourgeoisie, weak and poli-
 tically  unstable,  was  often  oppressed  by  foreign
 imperialism and was therefore to a certain extent
 opposed to it.
 Only the Chinese proletariat proved to be the
 most persistent and resolute fighters against foreign
 and domestic exploiters alike, because it was most
 brutally oppressed by foreign imperialism, bureau-
 cratic capitalism, and feudalism.  It found a strong
 and close ally in the broad masses of the peasantry.
 At various stages, it was united with the petty bour-
 geoisie and the national bourgeoisie who in different
 degrees were oppressed by the reactionary forces.
 Prior to the advent of the Chinese proletariat
 as a strong revolutionary force, the Chinese people
 had carried out two revolutions in an attempt to
 overthrow the reactionary Manchu rule. The Taiping
 Revolution of the peasants broke out in 1850 but was

 suppressed in 1864. The Revolution of 1911 led by
 Sun Yat-sen dethroned the Manchu emperor but was
 followed by a series of civil wars among the war-
 lords.  Chinese  society  remained  fundamentally
 unchanged.  Because of lack of the leadership of
 the proletariat, both revolutions ended in failure.
 The May Fourth Movement of 1919 and the
 birth of the Communist Party of China two years
 later marked the beginning of the Chinese New-
 Democratic revolution. The revolution, led by the
 working class, based on the alliance of workers and
 peasants and uniting the petty bourgeoisie, national
 bourgeoisie, and other democratic elements, set about
 the great task of uprooting foreign imperialism,
 bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism in China. It
 found inspiration in the October Socialist Revolution
 in Russia, a revolution which, awakening the op-
 pressed masses throughout the world and especially
 the labouring people of the East, constituted a turn-
 ing point in the history of mankind. Chairman Mao
 Tse-tung writes in his On People's Democratic
 Dictatorship: "They  found  Marxism-Leninism,  a
 universal truth applicable. anywhere: the face of
 China thus began to change." And he adds: "The
 salvoes  of  the  October  Revolution  brought us
 Marxism-Leninism."
 In the course of the revolution, the Chinese
 people, under the leadership of the Communist Party
 and its leader Mao Tse-tung, passed through four
 extremely difficult revolutionary wars. The First
 Revolutionary Civil War occurred in. the years from

 1924 to 1927 when the Communist Party of China
 formally co-operated with the Kuomintang led by
 Sun  Yat-sen.  Betrayed by the Kuomintang reac-
 tionaries, the War met with failure. During the
 Second Revolutionary Civil War from 1927 to 1936,
 the Chinese people not only repeatedly defeated the
 onslaughts of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary troops,
 but succeeded in building up the Chinese Workers'
 and Peasants' Red Army and many revolutionary
 bases.  During the War of Resistance to Japanese
 Aggression from  1937 to  1.945, the people's armed
 forces  led  by  the   Communist Party,  notably the
 Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, bore
 the brunt of the war and finally, in co-operation
 with  the    mighty  Soviet Red  Army,   smashed  the
 Japanese invaders and opened the way for democratic
 reforms so eagerly hoped for by the Chinese people.
 However,  the Kuomintang reactionaries were
 intolerant of the growth of democracy and freedom.
 Encouraged and directed by the U.S. imperialists,
 they were intent on wiping: out the people's forces
 which they regarded as the chief obstacle to their
 dictatorial and reactionary rule. In spite of the
 ceasefire agreement signed on January 10, 1946 and
 the Common Agreement reached at the end of Jan-
 uary 1946 at the Political Consultative Conference,
 the Kuomintang reactionaries, heavily supplied with
 U.S. dollars, guns, airplanes, and equipment of all
 kinds, started to attack the Liberated Areas and the
 People's Liberation Army and thus the Third Revo-
 lutionary Civil War broke out.

 In the first year of the War, from July 1946 to
 June 1947, the Kuomintang troops by virtue of their
 superiority in numerical strength and armament cap-
 tured many towns and cities in the Liberated Areas.
 But the tide of the war soon turned in the second
 year. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Tse-
 tung, the People's Liberation Army grew from a
 relatively weak into a powerful military force to be
 reckoned with. By the end of 1949, the. People's
 Liberation Army had put out of action a total of
 eight million of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Chiang
 Kai-shek and his henchmen fled to the island of
 Taiwan, the last part of Chinese territory which re-
 mains yet to be liberated.
 With the victory of the revolutionary war in
 1949, the People's Republic of China came into exist-
 ence. It was proclaimed at the First Plenary Session
 of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Con-
 ference (CPPCC)-an organization of the democratic
 united front of the whole people-held in Peking
 from September 21 to 30, 1949. It turned a new page
 in Chinese history.
 The First Plenary Session of the CPPCC was
 attended by 662 delegates from the various demo-
 cratic parties and organizations, workers, peasants,
 armamen, women, youth, national minorities, over-
 seas Chinese, industrial and commercial circles, and
 other patriotic elements. It adopted the Common
 Programme of the CPPCC, the Organic Laws of the
 CPPCC and of the Central People's Government, and
 elected the Central People's Government Council

 with Mao Tse-tung as Chairman.  Other decisions
 made by the Session included naming Peking as
 capital of the People's Republic of China, the adop-
 tion of the March of the Volunteers as the national
 anthem pro tem, and the red flag designed with five
 golden stars as the national flag.
 On October 1, 1949, the Central People's Govern-
 ment of the People's Republic of China was formally
 inaugurated, the anniversary of which is celebrated
 as a national holiday.

 THE CHINESE PEOPLE'S POLITICAL
 CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE,
 The Chinese People's Political Consultative Con-
 ference (CPPCC) is an organization of the democra-
 tic united front of the entire Chinese people. It
 embraces the representatives of the working class,
 the peasantry, the revolutionary armymen, the intel-
 lectuals, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bour-
 geoisie, the national minorities, the overseas Chinese,
 and other patriotic, democratic personages. Its aim
 is to unite all democratic classes and all nationali-
 ties in China through the solidarity of the democratic
 parties and groups and people's organizations in an
 endeavour to bring about New Democracy in China.
 On May 1, 1948 the Chinese Communist Party
 proposed the convocation of a political consultative
 conference to pave the way for the establishment
 of a democratic coalition government. The proposal
 won immediate response from all democratic parties,
 people's organizations, and notable democratic per-
 sonages throughout the country.  On June 15, 1949
 a preparatory committee was set up.  The first meet-
 ing of the preparatory committee was attended by

 134 delegates representing all democratic parties and
 people's  groups,  democratic  personages,  national
 minorities, and overseas Chinese.  The meeting elect-
 ed a standing committee of 21 members among whom
 were Mao Tse-tung, Chairman of the Central Com-
 mittee of the Chinese Communist Party, Chu Teh,
 Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Libera-
 tion Army, Li Chi-shen, Chairman of the Revolution-
 ary Committee of the Kuomintang, and Chang Lan,
 Chairman of the China Democratic League; and
 charged it with the responsibility of carrying on the
 preparatory work for the CPPCC.
 The First Plenary Session of the CPPCC opened
 in Peking on September 21, 1949, attended by 662
 delegates  from  45  bodies.  It  officially  proclaimed
 the ending of the reactionary rule of Kuomintang
 and the birth of the People's Republic of China.      It
 adopted three provisional fundamental laws, namely,
 the Common Programme, the Organic Law of the
 CPPCC, and the Organic Law of the Central People's
 Government.
 According to the Common Programme, the state
 power of the People's Republic of China belongs to
 the people. The people's congresses and the people's
 governments of all levels are organs for the exercise
 of state power by the people. The All-China People's
 Congress is the supreme organ of state power.  But
 pending the convocation of the All-China People's
 Congress elected by universal suffrage, the Plenary
 Session of the CPPCC shall exercise the functions
 and powers of the All-China People's Congress, elect

 pending the 'convocation of the local people's, con-
 gresses elected by universal suffrage, the local all-
 circles representative conferences shall be convened
 which gradually assume the functions and powers
 of the local people's congresses.
 According to the Organic Law of the CPPCC,
 the CPPCC elects a National Committee which in
 turn elects its Standing Committee.  In the intervals
 between the Plenary Sessions of the CPPCC. the
 function of the National Committee and its Stand-
 ing Committee is to ensure the implementation of
 the resolutions of the Plenary Session and the Na-
 tional Committee of the CPPCC, to submit proposals
 to the Central People's Government, and to deal
 with affairs concerning the internal co-operation of
 the CPPCC. In the last three years, the First Nation-
 al Committee has held four sessions and its Stand-
 ing Committee has held 44 meetings.
 In the last three years since its birth, New
 China has scored great successes in every sphere of
 the nation's life. Military operations have been con-
 cluded on the mainland, agrarian reform has been
 basically completed, people, of every walk of life are
 organized, the war-wrecked national economy has
 been restored, and a planned, large-scale economic
 construction is ushered in-all these show that con-
 ditions are ripe for the convocation of the All-China.
 People's Congress and the. people's congresses of all
 levels elected by universal suffrage.  In view of this

 situation, thc, Chinese Communist Party made a pro-
 posal to the Standing Committee of the First Na-
 tional  Committee  of  the  CPPCC  on  December 24,
 1952 for the convening in 1953 of the people's con-
 gresses of the hsiang, county, and province  (muni-
 cipality)  levels elected  by universal suffrage, and
 the convening of the All-China People's Congress on
 this basis. This proposal won the unanimous support
 of the component bodies of the CPPCC and was
 submitted to the Central People's Government for
 decision. On January 13, 1953 the Central People's
 Government Council adopted the Resolution on the
 Convening of the All-China People's Congress and
 the  Local  People's  Congresses  at All  Levels  and
 defined the task of the All-China People's Congress
 as the adoption of a Constitution, the ratification
 of the basic outline of the First Five-Year Plan of
 national construction, and the election of a new
 Central People's Government; and on March 1, 1953
 it promulgated the Election Law. Now preparations
 for the unprecedented event-the convocation of the
 All-China  People's  Congress  elected  by  universal
 suffrage-are in full swing throughout China.
 After the convocation of the All-China People's
 Congress, the CPPCC will no longer exercise the
 functions and powers of the All-China People's Con-
 gress but will continue to function as the organiza-
 tion of the Chinese people's democratic united front.
 It will undertake the task of consolidating and
 developing the people's democratic united front, and
 continue to strive for the building of New Demo-
 cracy and for a Socialist future.

 PEKING MUNICIPAL PEOPLE'S
 GOVERNMENT
 Immediately following the liberation of Peking
 on January 31, 1949, the Peking Municipal People's
 Government was formed.  In August 1949 the First
 People's  Representative Conference was held. It
 was attended by 332 delegates representing the Chi-
 nese Communist Party and the various other demo-
 cratic  parties;  workers,  peasants,  and  national
 capitalists; experts, professors, and students; and the
 youth and women.
 The Second People's Representative Conference
 held in November 1949 elected the Municipal Peo-
 ple's Government, a mayor, two vice-mayors and ten
 municipal council members.  This new government
 tully assumed the function and form of a local
 democratic coalition government whose leadership is
 composed of representatives from different walks of
 life.  Meanwhile,  district  people's  representative
 conferences  were  convened     which  elected district
 people's governments.  In this way, the representa-
 tives of the municipal and district conferences kept
 close  contact  with the more than     2,600,000 people

 In the last four years the Peking Municipal Peo-
 ple's Government has. carried out a series of social
 reform and construction work. In April 1950 the
 agrarian reform was successfully completed on the
 outskirts of the city. One of the social evils, pro-
 stitution, which ruthlessly disgraced the women for
 centuries was abolished for ever when all the bro-
 thels in Peking were closed down in November 1949
 at the order of the Municipal People's Government.

 The Communist Party of China is the party of
 the Chinese working class, having for its object the
 realization of Communism in China. Founded on
 July 1, 1921, the Party now has a membership of
 more than 6,000,000.
 The Communist Party of China, with the sup-
 port of the Soviet Union and the working class of
 various countries of the world, has led the Chinese
 people in liberating the whole of the mainland
 through a series of revolutionary wars-the First
 Revolutionary Civil, War of 1924-27, the Second
 Revolutionary Civil War of 1927-36, the War of
 Resistance to Japanese Aggression of 1937-45, and
 the Third Revolutionary Civil War of 1945-49, thus
 putting an end to the rule of imperialism and
 feudalism in China, and establishing a new state
 of People's Democratic Dictatorship-the People's
 Republic of China.
 The Communist Party of China is the leading
 force of the People's Republic of China. Relying

 THE REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
 OF THE KUOMINTANG
 The Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang
 was organized by democratic members of the Kuo-
 mintang who were opposed to Chiang Kai-shek's
 dictatorship.  Since 1945, the anti-Chiang Kai-shek
 democratic elements inside the Kuomintang formed
 a number of groups, including the Three People's
 Principles Comrades Association led by Tan Ping-
 shan and the Kuomintang Association for Promoting

 Democracy led by Li Chi-shen.  On January 1, 1948
 these groups, together with other anti-Chiang Kai-
 shek democratic elements of the Kuomintang, or-
 ganized the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuo-
 mintang  with  Li  Chi-shen  as                                                             chairman,  and  Ho
 Hsiang-ning, Tan Ping-shan, and others as members
 of the Central Committee. The Committee issued
 its inaugural declaration and made known its work-
 ing programme.  It also announced that it adhered
 to the domestic and foreign policies adopted by the
 First National Congress of the Kuomintang in 1924
 as its basic principles, and stood for the overthrow
 of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous regime and the estab-
 lishment of a coalition government.
 In September 1949 the Revolutionary Committee
 of the Kuomintang, the Three People's Principles
 Comrades Association, and the Kuomintang Associa-
 tion for Promoting Democracy, represented by Li
 Chi-shen, Ho Hsiang-ning, Tan Ping-shan, Tsai Ting-
 kai, and  others, participated in the First Plenary
 Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
 Conference and Li Chi-shen was elected Vice-Chair-
 man  of  the  Central  People's  Government  of  the
 People's Republic of China.
 In November 1949 the Committee called a re-
 presentative conference of the democratic groups of
 the Kuomintang in order to incorporate the Revolu-
 tionary      Committee  of the  Kuomintang, the    Three
 People's Principles Comrades Association, the Kuo-
 mintang Association for Promoting Democracy, and
 other democratic elements of the Kuomintang into

 the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang.
 The conference passed resolutions on current poli-
 tical tasks and organizational questions and adopted
 its Constitution.  It declared its acceptance of the
 leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and
 adopted the Common Programme of the CPPCC as
 its own programme. It called upon the. democratic
 and patriotic elements who formerly were members
 of the Kuomintang to accept the political principles
 of New Democracy, to re-educate themselves ideolo-
 gically and to take an active part in the cause of
 revolution and construction.
 In November 1950 the Revolutionary Committee
 of the Kuomintang held the Second Plenary Session
 of            the  Central  Committee  elected by the  Second
 National Congress, at which the campaign to resist
 U.S. aggression and aid Korea was set as the then
 central political task of the Committee and resolu-
 tions were passed on the development of the or-
 ganization of the Committee.
 In January 1953 the Committee held the enlarged
 Third Plenary Session which summed up the tasks
 of the Committee in the past two years. With regard
 to the nature of the Committee, the Session defined
 it as a component of the people's democratic united
 front led by the Chinese Communist Party. The
 mission  of the  Committee  in the  united front is
 chiefly to unite, educate, and re-educate the former
 Kuomintang members and those personages who have
 had  historical  connections  with  the  Kuomintang.
 Moreover,   the  Session  accepted  the three  great

 tasks.
 The  China Democratic. League, which enrols
 members principally from the petty-bourgeois intel-
 ligentsia, was founded in 1941. It was first known
 as the Alliance of Chinese Democratic Parties and
 Groups, and renamed the China Democratic League
 in  1944.  The League is led by Chang Lan, Shen
 Chun-ju, and others.
 During the period of the War of Resistance to
 Japanese Aggression, the League advocated the policy
 of fighting against Japan, and for democracy and
 unity   within  China.  Following  the  victory  over
 Japan, the League advocated peace, democracy, sol-
 idarity,                                                        and unification,  and fought against   the
 reactionary rule and civil-war policy of the Kuomin-
 tang.                                             As a result of the cruel persecution of the
 League by the reactionary Kuomintang government,
 two prominent members of the League, Li Kung-pu
 and Wen Yi-to, were murdered in July 1946 in Kun-
 ming.  Under the pressure of the Kuomintang reac-
 tionary government, the League had to close down

 a leading body in Hongkong, resumed activities, and
 issued a declaration announcing its close co-opera-
 tion with the Chinese Communist Party and its active
 support for the people's armed revolution.
 In September 1949 the League,. represented by
 Chang  Lan,  Shen  Chun-ju,  Chang Po-shun,  Lo
 Lung-chi, Shih Liang, Hu Yu-chih, and others, par-
 ticipated in the First Plenary Session of the CPPCC
 in Peking. At this Session Chang Lan was elected
 Vice-Chairman of the Central People's Government
 of the People's Republic of China.
 In December 1949 the Central Committee of the
 League held its Fourth Plenary Session which de-
 clared its acceptance of the leadership of the Chinese
 Communist Party and its adoption of the Common
 Programme of the CPPCC as the programme of the
 League.
 In December 1951 the Standing Committee of the
 Central Committee of the League endorsed the de-
 finition of the nature and tasks of the League made
 by its conference for organizational and propaganda
 work, that is, the League is a New-Democratic poli-
 tical party in the nature of a class alliance with
 the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia as its main com-
 ponent, and set itself the task of uniting and educat-
 ing the intelligentsia to struggle under the leader-
 ship of the Chinese Communist Party for the realiza-
 tion of the New-Democratic revolution.

 The  All-China  Federation  of  Trade  Unions,

 strike of May 30.  After Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal
 of the revolution in 1927, the Federation was forced
 underground to conduct long-term, arduous struggles.
 On the eve of-the nation-wide victory of the Chinese
 People's Liberation War, the Sixth All-China Con-
 gress of Labour held in Harbin in August 1948
 formally re-established the All-China Federation of
 Trade Unions.
 In 1950 the Central People's Government pro-
 mulgated the Trade Union Law which clearly defines
 the legal status and functions of the trade unions
 and affords legal protection for the basic interests
 of the working class.
 By rallying the broad masses of workers around
 the Chinese Communist Party, the trade unions have
 constituted a link between the Party and the masses
 and at the same time the strong social pillar of
 the Chinese People's Democratic Dictatorship. Up to
 March 1953, the basic units of the Federation num-
 ber 180,000 and its membership has increased from
 7,290,000 in 1951 to 10,200,000.  Over 90 per cent of
 the industrial workers have joined the trade unions.
 The trade unions of 23 industries have set up their
 national committees.
 Since the birth of New China, the Chinese work-
 ing class, under the leadership of the Federation,
 has conducted many mass campaigns such as the
 democratic reform of the enterprises, labour emula-
 tion, the campaign for creating new record, and has

 practising economy was set on foot.  In these move-
 ments, the workers developed their enthusiasm for
 production and their initiative to high degree; and
 as a result, they put forward over 980,000 rational-
 ization  proposals  which greatly                                                    raised the  labour
 productivity.   Over 223,000 model  workers  have
 emerged in the movements.
 Following the restoration  and development of
 production,  the material  and           cultural  life of the
 workers has been markedly improved. Up to the
 end of 1952, the average wages of the workers and
 staff memo rs throughout the country had increased
 by 60 to 120 per cent as compared with 1949.   In
 1952 alone, the state spent 2,860,000 million yuan on
 building living quarter:s for one million workers.
 The Labour Insurance Regulations promulgated
 in 1951 and amended at the beginning of 1953 provides
 a preliminary solution. to the workers' problems of
 childbirth, old age, sickness, death, injury, and dis-
 ablement.  Up to the end of 1952, over 3,800 enter-
 prises were applying the Regulations, benefiting a
 total of more than 3,200,000 workers and staff mem-
 bers.                                             In 1952 alone, the state spent 1,600,000 million
 yuan on labour insurance.
 During the  past  few years,  the  trade  unions
 have assisted the management in establishing 1.6,277
 spare-time schools for cultural study and a number
 of spare-time  technical  schools  for  workers, with

 nearly  3,100,000  workers  attending. Some  124,500
 workers have been promoted to posts of administra-
 tive and technical cadres at various levels. Of these,
 over 7,800 have become directors or deputy directors
 of factories.
 The  Seventh  All-China  Congress  of    Trade
 Unions held in May 2-11, 1953 summed up the
 achievements and  experiences  of  China's   trade
 unions during the past four years since the Sixth
 All-China Congress of Labour, and defined that the
 task of the trade unions in the period of planned
 national construction is, under the leadership of the
 Communist Party of China, to unite and educate the
 workers and raise their political consciousness and
 sense of organization; to consolidate the worker-
 peasant alliance, and unite with the people of all
 other strata to actively fulfil the national construc-
 tion plan; and, on the basis of developing produc-
 tion, to improve the workers' material and cultural
 life step by step; and to strive for the early indus-
 trialization of the country and its transition to
 Socialism.
 The Chinese working class takes as its great and
 important international task the cause of consolidating
 and developing the unity of the working people of
 all countries, and defending the lasting peace in the
 Far East and the whole world. The All-China Feder-
 ation                                             of  Trade  Unions has  established  friendly
 relations with  the  working class  of 50 countries
 including the   Soviet Union, People's Democracies,
 and a number of capitalist, colonial, and dependent

 The  Sino-Soviet Friendship  Association  was
 founded in Peking on October 5, 1949. It is a mass
 organization whose aim is to further and consolidate
 the fraternal friendship and co-operation between
 the Chinese and Soviet peoples, and to develop the
 interflow of knowledge and experiences of the two
 great nations. According to statistical data available
 for January 1953, the Association has set up,branch-
 es in every province, city, and county, with a total
 membership of more than 68,000,000.
 The Association has achieved much in carrying
 out among the broad masses of all strata extensive
 work of publicity and education on Sino-Soviet
 friendship and on learning from the Soviet Union.
 The Sino-Soviet Friendship, a periodical published
 every ten days by the Association, has a circulation
 of more than 300,000 copies. By the end of Septem-

 cinema shows to a total audience of 87,700,000, and
 had arranged 29,769 photographic exhibitions visited
 by 81,400,000 people.  In addition, they had opened
 evening  Russian  language  schools  and  arranged
 Russian lessons over the radio, which prove to be
 of great help to spare-tir.ne students.
 In October 1949 the Soviet Delegation of Cultural,
 Art, and Scientific Workers headed by Fadeyev and
 Simonov came to China at the Association's invita-
 tion to attend the ceremony of the founding of
 New China and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associa-
 tion.  In 1950 the Association invited a number of
 famous Soviet scholars, such as Yudin, Chesnokov,
 Askerov, Noozhdin, Kiselev, Boldyrev, and Makarova
 to China who made lecture tours of the country.
 The  Sino-Soviet Friendship  Month  beginning
 November 7, 1952 under the Association's auspices
 was an occasion for publicizing Sino-Soviet friend-
 ship on a scale never witnessed before and involved
 the greatest majority of the population in this coun-
 try. Lectures, forums, and exhibitions were arrang-
 ed in various places, simultaneously with the Soviet
 Film Month during which Soviet films were screen-
 ed in more than 70 of China's large and medium-
 sized cities and by the many film projection teams
 organized by the Association. At the invitation of
 the Association, the All-Union Society for Cultural
 Relations with Foreign Countries of the U.S.S.R.
 sent the Soviet Delegations of Cultural Workers, of
 Artists, and of Cinema Workers, and the Soviet Army
 Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble to China to take

 In 1950 the Federation helped to establish liter-
 ary and art organizations in various Greater Areas,
 provinces, and cities throughout China. As a result
 of the convening of congresses of literary and art
 workers and the establishment of branches of the
 Federation in various places, unity in basic policy
 of literature and art was achieved. It was affirmed
 that Chairman Mao Tse-tung's policy in the realms
 of literature and art be adopted as a guide for all
 literary and art workers. A united front in literary
 and art work was established; literary criticism and
 the popularization of literature and art and a popu-
 lar literary and art movement were promoted; and
 the development of the literature and art of national
 minorities was encouraged.
 The chief tasks of the Federation are to organize
 the writers to take part in practical struggles, to do
 creative work, study Marxism-Leninism and Mao
 Tse-tung's  teachings,  develop criticism and self-
 criticism in relation to literature and art, direct the
 literary and art activities of the masses, and strength-
 en the cultural ties between the Chinese people
 and those of the rest of the world. .
 Affiliated with the Federation are:  All-China

 Since October 1950, when the Chinese People's
 Volunteers entered the fight against U.S. imperialism
 in Korea, the Federation has carried out large-scale
 propaganda  work  among  the  people  through   its
 various constituent bodies.  It has also organized
 writers, musicians, and painters to go to the Korean
 front where they may prepare themselves for crea-
 tive work by learning from reality.
 In co-operation with the Ministry of Cultural
 Affairs, it has established an Institute of Literary

 dynasty, its name was changed into the Great Ching
 Red Cross Society. In 1911 it became the Red Cross
 Society of China and was admitted to membership
 in the International Committee of the Red Cross in
 1912
 All through its early histoiy and under the
 Kuomintang, the Red Cross was controlled by feudal
 warlords, corrupt politicians, landlords, and other
 members of the ruling cliques. It was not until
 after liberation that it began to function as a genuine
 people's organization.
 In March 1950 the Society applied to the Minis-
 try of Public Health for help in reorganization. A
 new 20-member Board was set up with Li Teh-
 chuan, Minister of Public Health as President. Other
 members were drawn from government, business
 and trade union circles, women's organizations, and
 cultural and medical groups. The Red Cross was
 re-defined as an organization dedicated to serving
 the people, helping the government to wipe out the
 harm done by war, and acting as a relief agency.,
 It was stipulated that the chapters should be re-
 organized and the old members trained to work in
 the new spirit. It was also stated that the Red
 Cross should assist the Ministry of Public Health and
 the People's Relief Administration of China to mobi-
 lize mass strength to develop and carry out medical,
 health, and relief work.
 Since its reorganization, the Society has extend-
 ed health service to the people in many respects:

 centres, nurseries, and hospitals in cities; the train-

 and the establishment of first-aid stations in factories,
 schools, and villages; and the organization of medi-
 cal corps for workers on the Huai River projects
 and other great construction sites in China, and for
 service in the areas of national minorities, and to
 help them train their own medical personnel.  Other
 achievements include the dispatch of international
 medical corps to render service to the people's armed
 forces as well as the prisoners of war in Korea, and
 to combat the germ warfare waged by the U.S.
 government.  In 1952 it raised donations for the re-
 lief of famine victims in India and, in conjunction
 with four other people's organizations, raised relief
 funds for the flood victims of Britain, the Nether-
 lands, and Belgium at the beginning of 1953.
 The Red Cross Society of China is a member of
 the  Executive  Committee  of  the  League  of  Red
 Cross Societies and has played an active part in
 the meetings of the League Board of Governors
 and  its  Executive  Committee.  Representatives of

 mote health, social welfare, and cultural advance
 for the Chinese people.
 During  the  War  of  Resistance  to  Japanese
 Aggression, the Institute, then known as the China
 Defence League, acted as the channel of support
 from all over the world to the International Peace
 Hospitals and the Bethune Medical College which
 were set up in the resistance bases behind the Japan-
 ese lines. These institutions have now become an
 important part of the health service of New China.
 The Institute assisted the work carried on by
 Dr. Norman Bethune, famous Canadian surgeon, and
 Dr. Dwarkanath  Kotnis  of  India,  who  became
 martyrs to the cause of the Chinese people and whose
 names remain for ever as symbols of international
 friendship.
 At present the Institute is carrying on the
 following projects: International Peace Maternity
 and Child Health Hospital, nurseries for workers'
 children, Children's Palace, Children's Theatre, and
 Children's Epoch, which is a popular fortnightly for
 primary school pupils..
 In January 1952 the Institute launched a new
 venture in international friendship, the English bi-
 monthly magazine China Reconstructs.  This maga-
 zine chronicles the life of the Chinese people in
 authoritative  articles,  interesting features,   vivid
 photographs,   drawings,  and  charts.   Its editorial
