LEADERSHIP DYNAMICS AND CHINESE POLICY--A SPECULATIVE ESSAY 
Introduction  
Various reports of leadership conflict, renewed conservative criticism of 
economic reforms, the imbroglio over the US ship visit and rumors of 
high-level personnel changes have led us to speculate that tensions are 
running particularly high in Beijing. Although recent provincial level 
appointments and continued reform in the military suggest that Deng 
Xiaoping's reform coalition continues ascendant, we believe the major party 
delegates conference scheduled for September has triggered renewed serious 
infighting within the top leadership. Premier Zhao Ziyang's recent unusual 
public denial of impending leadership shifts has added to our concern that 
Deng's succession arrangements may have hit a serious snag. There have been 
several indications in the press that major shifts within the reform 
coalition are planned for the next party congress in 1987, anditisnossble 
that some or all of the arrangements are now being challenged. 
At this point, we are confident that conservative elements in the 
leadership are strongly attacking aspects of the urban economic reforms and 
the open door policy. The conservatives also appear to be pushing hard for a 
more rapid warming in Sino -Soviet relations and probably, a corresponding 
cooling in China's relations with the US. We are not as confident about the 
reform coalition's ability to maintain its cohesion in the face of renewed 
conservative attacks and the chalenaeoLfastioning working relationships 
that will endure after Deng goes. 
If leadership infighting has intensified in Beijing, we believe it 
centers on the problem of redistributing power and arranging the succession. 
In our view, it is likely that General Secretary Hu Yaobang is at the center 
of controversy, and that fissures may be developing withjnthereform 
coalition over the appropriate roles for Hu and Zhao. 
At times of intensified infighting within the leadership, we believe 
foreign policy issues are exploited 83 weapons in the debate, but we do not 
believe the present signs of disarray necessarily presage significant foreign 
policy shifts. Indeed, the recent beefing up of President Li Xiannian's 
delegation to the US suggests that Beijing is anxious to balance its warming 
signals to Moscow by reaffirming the importance of its ties to the US. If 
our speculations are warranted, however, political tensions in Bei n are 
likely to complicate the sanagment of Sino-US relations. 
This memo is an effort to delineate our concerns and uncertainties about 
the Chinese leadership situation. It is intended primarily to provide a 
framework for examining what may be the unfolding political dynamics in 
Beijing. While a plaussible case can be made that current tensions are 
r--- 
manageable, we believe it is useful to examine those aspects of the current 
situation that could lead to analytical surprises.

LEADERSHIP DYNAMICS AND CHINESE POLICY 
Analysis of domestic politics in China has always been based upon a 
composite of open-source information from the Chinese press, insights gained 
from other analytical Sources--qunh  as Hong Kong and Taiwan publications, 
,  and basic assumptions about the nature of 
the Chinese political system and its principal actors, all yielding a 
"conventional wisdom" about how the system is working. Recently, there have 
been a number of reports that have mused us to reassess our conventional 
widsom about Chinese politics and seek alternative explanations for what we 
see as anomalous phenomena. Individually, these reports must be treated with 
caution: they are in some cases highly speculative, and of uncertain 
accuracy. Some of them are little more than rumors from sources whose 
objectivity is open to question. Rumors are common in advance of a major 
party conclave, and many of them turn out to have little grounding in fact. 
The September party delegates conference, with its promise of major Central 
Committee reshuffling, is possibly the catalyst for a larger than average 
supply of rumors from interested parties. Taken as a group, however, the 
reports cannot be lightly dismissed, and their implications for China's 
foreign and  domestic policies and political structures must be assessed. 
Generally, the reports which have caused us to reevaluate our assessment 
of domestic Chinese politics cluster into three interrelated categories: 
1. Interpersonal tensions between members of the Politburo have gotten 
much worse, perhaps to the point where certain leaders find it impossible 
to work together. This portends a factionalization of the leadership 
that would sake the maintenance of a consensus approach to policymaking 
much more difficult to sustain. 
2. Major leadership changes are being considered?including the power 
positions of the two chosen successors--that could seriously alter the 
way decisions are made in China. 
3. Foreign policy questions--in particular relations with the Soviet 
Union and United States - -have been drawn into the political travand have 
contributed to leadership disagreements and tensions. 
Politburo Strains  
Hu Yaobang has been controversial within the party ever since his 
appointment as acting Chairman, and later General Secretary in 1981. Hu has 
been faulted for his lack of leadership experience, particularly in military 
affairs, and for espousing so-called "liberal" causes within the party. Most 
consistently, however, he has gotten in trouble because of his personality

;ECRET 
and leadership style. Hu is an impulsive man, impatient by his own 
admission, easily excitable, and animated in his words and gestures. He does 
not cultivate the air of calm, careful consideration that many Chinese seem 
to expect in their leaders. Hu has also been accused of being arrogant and 
rash in his decisions, making quick judgments before he has obtained all the 
necessary facts or consulted the appropriate officials. Hu has been attacked 
regularly for his all-too-freewheeling and injudicious annroanh  to interviews 
with foreign journalists and government leaders. 
Recently, Hu's off-the-cuff remarks have caused more than just 
embarrassment, but some actual political damage. Recent gaffes include 
several misstatements on US-China relations (the most significant being his 
10 April press conference which ultimately led to the cancellation of planned 
US Navy port calls to China), offhand comments on recruitment of Communist 
Party members in Hong Kong, and several revelations to foreign journalists 
about policy and personnel matters that had not been announced within China. 
Hu frequently jokes with foreign correspondents about revealing "top secret" 
information to them, and there is some evidence that other Politburo leaders 
are not amused. Hu has been criticized for his verbal indiscretions 
Yun, Zhao Ziyang, Deng Xiaoping, and even members of his own staff. 
The most remarkable example of Hu's indiscretion, however, is his 10 May 
interview with Hong Kong publisher Lu Keng. Lu, a political gadfly with a 
flair for journalistic sensationalism, spent 22 years in a PRC jail on 
suspicion of being a spy for the Kuomintang. Hu agreed to meet him 
one-on-one, without questions being submitted in advance, and evidently 
without securing the right to edit the final text. 
Their two-hour interview, published in Hong Kong in early June, covered a 
broad range of issues and personalities, involving both domestic and foreign 
policies. Hu's unrehearsed remarks appeared to differ markedly from recently 
espoused policy lines on recovery of Taiwan, suggesting to some observers 
that he was either pushing China's policy in a more confrontational 
direction, or that he was trying to garner support from conservatives within 
the Politburo by talking tough on Taiwan, a touchstone issue within the 
leadership. Hu's interview was also sprinkled with a remarkable number of 
factual and analytical errors, as well as several comments about about his 
Politburo and Secretariat colleagues that could easily be read as backhanded 
compliments. Among those Hu discussed in subtly condescending terms are Wang 
Zhen Hu ?iaomu, Deng Liqun, Li Desheng and, most importantly, Deng Xiaoping. 
Hu's errors, compounded by forcing other officials to cover for and 
explain them, have probably exacerbated strains within the Politburo over his 
leadership abilities. Although Deng has evidently supported Hu (most 
recently at a May conference on education), Hu's imprudent remarks on issues,

such as foreign policy, for which Deng has carefully crafted policies, may 
cause Deng embarrassment within the leadership for selecting Hu as his 
successor, or they may even strain personal relations between the two men. 
DRAFT 
There are also reports that other Politburo mAstwirs are not getting along 
well. Deng and Chen Yun are avoiding each other 
because their relationship has deteriorated so seriously. Chen has 
consistently expressed reservations about some aspects of Deng's domestic 
economic reform program, but it was considered that they were in general 
agreement on other policy matters. Recently his critiques have become 
sharper and more forceful. In early May, Propaganda Department chief Deng 
Liqun, considered a strong supporter of Chen Yun, published a pointed 
critique of reform policies in a Sichuan newspaper. Other reporting suggests 
that Zhao Ziyang is under attack from conservative quarters for mishandling 
the Chinese economy in the last quarter of 1984. One of Zhao's principal 
proteges in the leadership, Vice premier Tian Jiyun, has been heavily 
criticized for the financial problems that developed last year. 
Leadership Realignments Ahead? 
Hu Yaobang and Deng Xiaoping have made no secret of their intention to 
bring about major changes in the Central Committee, Secretariat and possibly 
Politburo at the scheduled September conference of party delegates. Hu has 
indicated that 15% of the Central Committee would be replaced, and that there 
would be important changes and retirements in the party Secretariat. In a 
clear breach of party discipline, he has told foreign reporters that his 
protege Hu Qili would be among those promoted to the Politburo at the 
September meeting.Huas_been_less_forthnnming about other personnel 
changes, however, reports that Deng Xiaoping would 
lead a ??o retirement by turning over 
chairmanship of the crucial party Military Commission to Hu Yaobang. 
Recent rumors out of Hong Kong,  have given 
this story a new twist. According to an account in Zheng Ming magazine, 
 Hu would indeed replace Deng as Militar 
Commission Chairman, but instead of retaining his party General Secretary 
post, he would cede it to Hu Qili. Zhao Ziyang, meanwhile, would replace Li 
Xiannian in the relatively powerless post of State Chairman (or President), 
losing his Premiership to current Vice Premier Li Peng. Variations on this 
story have speculated that Zhao 's appointment to the State 
Chairmanship would be accompanied by a strengthenin of that office to 
include some controls over military affairs. 
In an interesting break with China's usual practice of not commenting on 
leadership rumors from Hong Kong, Zhao Ziyang explicitly denied this story in

early June. Talking to Western reporters, Zhao said that the "General 
Secretary [Hu], Central Advisory Commission [Deng] and Central Military 
Commission [Deng] will remain unchanged" at the September conference of 
delegates, while his own and Li Xiannian's positions will be decided at the 
National People's Congress session to be held in 1987. Zhao's demurral 
notwithstanding, we are inclined to question the Zheng Ming story because of 
its lack of consonance with other reporting, and because other pre-congress 
rumors of impending leadership shakeups have proven inaccurate. Nonetheless. 
the account cannot be dismissed out of hand 
Whatever the veracity of the rumors, they do focus attention on personnel 
changes being planned in Beijing, and on the uncertainty of the long-term 
leadership picture. They suggest strongly to us that the leadership is still 
struggling with power distribution questions, and that the outcome has not 
been decided. Hu Yoabang himself has contributed to the spreading of rumors 
by repeatedly insisting to reporters that Hu Qili will become a member of the 
Politburo and by obliquely suggesting that his own position as General 
Secretary might be changed soon. 
The most important position that Deng %looping holds is the Chairmanship 
of the party and state Military Commissions. It has been our view that Deng 
must retire from this  post and pass it on to Hu Yaobang to make the  
succession credible. i 
  Zhao's statements, as well as recent interviews with Hu 
Yaobang, however, suggest that the deal may have fallen through, for reasons 
as yet unclear. Hu told Hong Kong reporters in April, and Lu Keng in early 
May, that Deng would keep the position for the indefinite future. Hu even 
implied that he did not consider the Military Commission post that important.

Considerations 
25X1 
There have been several 
reports that foreign 
policy issues have become highly 
po iticized in the leadership. In 
particular, China's relations with the Soviet Union and the United States 
have become contentious issues. One report indicated that, while the 
"majority" in the Politburo favored continuing China's current policy toward 
the USSR, influential elders such as Chen Yun and Peng Then favored a more 
rapid amelioration of relations. Another report suggested that Chen had even 
tabled a specific proposal for improving trade relations with Moscow at a 
Politburo meeting, but it had not been approved.

ECRET DRAFT 
Following the death of Konstantin Chernenko, China's leaders appeared to 
take a conciliatory approach to Moscow, calling Gorbachev "comrade," 
referring to the USSR as a "socialist" nation for the first time in two 
decades, and sending Vice Premier Li Peng to the funeral. Furthermore, China 
pointedly ignored commenting on the "three obstacles" to the improvement of 
Sino-Soviet relations for nearly three months. Western observers viewed this 
as concessionary behavior on the part of the Chinese, for which they received 
little in return from the Soviets. We believe it is a distinct possibility 
that the overtures were part of Deng 's cautious response to pressure from 
within the Politburo to take a friendlier approach to the USSR. In any case, 
the moves apparently were not reciprocated, Deng reiterated the "three 
obstacles" in mid-April, and the subsequrt nestottatienn  on improving 
relations made no significant progress. 
Hu's remarks to Lu Keng about China's policy toward Taiwan also focused 
attention on the impact of internal politics on China's foreign policy. 
Official and unofficial statements up to the time of the interview emphasized 
the "peaceful reunification" approach to Taiwan, while soliciting US support 
for Deng's "one country, two systems" formulation for resolving the issue. 
In contrast, Hu talked freely about the eventual use of military force (in 
7-8 years) against Taiwan, linking it to progress in China's modernization. 
He also indicated that China might be forced to take action in response to 
domestic developments on Taiwan, and implied that, while US actions would be 
taken into account, China would not necessarily be deterred by them (Hu used 
China's willingness to confront the US militarily in 1949 83 an example). Hu 
furthermore criticized US "blood transfusions" to Taiwan and intervention in 
PRC efforts to recover the island militarily as evidence of "unfriendly" 
attitudes. 
While Hu's comments broke no new ground in a policy sense--other Chinese 
leaders having made provocative comments from time to time--we believe they 
are significant for two reasons: 
1) They appear to go beyond what other Chinese leaders recently have 
been willing to say publicly on the subject--more confrontational, 
less concerned about US reaction, less focused on "peaceful 
reunification." It is noteworthy that PRC media have 
avoided replaying Hu's remarks, and PRC-controlled newspapers in 
Hong Kong have attempted subtly to 
correct them, specifying China's continued preference for "peaceful 
reunification," and criticizing foreign press "sensationalism." 
2) Hu has generally not been one of the regime's main spokesmen on 
questions relating to Taiwan or the US, generally leaving those 
issues to the careful attention of Deng and Zhao Ziyang. His 
insertion of his views on these questions is somewhat unusual, 
particularly in such an authoritative fashion. Given the 
freeswinging nature of the interview, it is difficult to believe

that Hu was acting as a spokesman for Deng. He may have been making 
noises he thought would be welcomed by other conservative leaders 
(i.e. Chen Yun and Peng Then) whose support he needs, or he ma 
staking his own claim for influence in foreign policy making 
Given his potentially enhanced influence within the political system, 
flu's views and impression on foreign affairs merit more careful scrutiny. Hu 
has on occasion held out hope for improved relations with Moscow, and has put 
himself on record prominently as one who considers the USSR a "socialist" 
country. He sent personal congratulations to Gorbachev on his selection as 
General Secretary of the CPSU. On the other hand, Hu does not appear to hold 
the US in particularly high esteem, nor does he seem eager to further 
relations. He appears to be somewhat sore dogmatically Marxist in his 
understanding of geopolitics, and appears more concerned with socialism as an 
international cause than is Deng. While we do not believe Hu is strongly 
"pro-Soviet," or would inevitably seek a rapid improvement in Sino-Soviet 
relations, including the re-establishment of party-to-party ties, it is 
certainly plausible that he would be more receptive to overtures from 
MO3COW. 
Conclusions 
We are still uncertain at this point what all these diverse signals and 
omens actually mean. A plausible case could be made for any of several 
alternative explanations, each of which has significantly different 
implications for the succession to Deng Xiaoping, and for the future 
decisionmaking structure in China. Our best guess at this point is that 
these basic power distribution questions have not yet been resolved within 
China's leadership, and are becoming increasingly contentious. Several 
points are clear: 
1. Hu Yaobang is at the center of the controversy. His powers, his 
personality, his relationships with other leaders, his views on important 
issues have contributed much to the current fluidity in Beijing. He has 
a significant number of detractors who evidently are seeking to block his 
succession to Deng or at least limit his future authority. On the other 
hand, he also has important support within the party and has gained 
a great deal of authority and prestige over the last year. He is a 
formidable political figure in his own right. 
2. Deng Xiaoping still holds the key. He is the one leader to whom all 
others look for guidance and leadership. Deng's views on his own 
succession arrangements may not have changed, but the pressures on him 
have probably escalated considerably. Deng is confronted with a dilemma: 
He needs to institutionalize his succession arrangements while he is 
still healthy enough to guarantee then, yet he faces the prospect that 
opposition to Hu may create the kind of leadership struggle that will not 
only complicate succession arrangements, but say also coalesce disparate

elements within the party into more unified opposition to important 
policy initiatives, such as economic reform and the opening to the West. 
In our view, Deng has not wide his preferences clear, but seems to be 
biding his time, marshalling his resources for a coming political 
struggle. 
3. Deng's position as Chairman of the Military Commission is central to 
the outcome of the competition for power. If Hu gets it, while still 
retaining his party post, it would significantly enhance his personal 
authority and make his domination of the political system more likely. 
If he gets the job, but loses his General Secretary position, or if the 
authority of the State Chairman (possibly Zhao Ziyang) is enhanced by 
putting him in charge of a distinct State Military Commission, then Hu's 
influence within the leadership would have to be seen as diminished. On 
the other hand, such an arrangement would sharpen the prospects for a 
power struggle between Hu and Zhao in a post-Deng leadership. What 
influence senior military leaders will have in this decision is difficult 
to judge; while their political clout seems generally to have declined 
over the past few years, they are potential kingmakers in this scenario. 
The strongly conservative tone of recent propaganda could be viewed as 
an attempt by Hu to appeal to more orthodox conservative PLA leaders. 
4. Policies are characterized by cautious continuity during such a period 
of flux. Earlier plans and policies can be carried out reasonably 
smoothly, but difficult decisions tend to get put o7, pending the 
outcome of political infighting. 
5. The party delegates conference in September will be a crucial event. 
In our view, Deng clearly wants to retire, but only if he can carry a 
significant segment of the party's old guard out with him. Personnel 
appointments being announced in the provinces and the military seem 
planned to create a sense of momentum for the rejuvenation of the party's 
topmost leadership ranks. We expect manifestations of leadershiotension 
to increase as this important conclave draws nearer. 
Two Speculative Scenarios for Leadership Change 
Despite official denials, the leadership change scenario currently 
circulating in the rumor channels (Hu Yaobang to Chairman of the party 
Military Commission, Hu Qili becomes General Secretary, Zhao Ziyang moves up 
to State Chairman with expanded powers, Li Peng replacing him as Premier) has 
a certain plausibility. While it may not be fully realized this year, it 
could come to pass before 1987, when the 13th Party Congress and Seventh 
National People's Congress are scheduled to convene. In our view, the plan 
accomplishes a number of Deng 's goals: 
1. It distributes power more effectively than current succession

arrangements. 
2. It places the controversial Hu Yaobang in a post where his powers will 
be limited, particularly if the State Military Commission is 
reconstituted under the control of the State Chairman. 
3. It elevates one of the party's most talented and respected young 
leaders, Hu Qili (56) to the leadership of the party. Although the 
university-educated Hu is clearly a representative of the party's 
"liberal" wing, he seems to have generated less antipathy among party 
conservatives than his mentor, Hu Yaobang. 
4. It brings to key leadership positions youthful leaders of demonstrated 
ability. Hu Qin is 56, while Li Peng is 57--both in the same age range 
as Gorbachev. This generation jumping is consistent with what Deng has 
accomplished in other party, military, government and provincial 
bureaucracies, and would appear to put off further succession problems 
for an extended period. Deng said in January that Hu Yaobang at 70 was 
already an "old man." 
5. In coordination with changes in the military chain-of-command and the 
restructuring of the Politburo, the plan would diminish the political 
influence of both the party old guard and the political generals of the 
PLA, goals which Deng has sought for several years. 
The principal problem with the plan, of course, is getting others within 
the leadership to accept it. In our view, Deng has not yet achieved that 
goal. 
A Darker Picture -- Official denials of the leadership change rumors may 
be indicative of a breakdown of consensus, i.e. that the succession plans 
have genuinely come unstuck. Tensions could increase to a point where 
leadership cohesion is lost or irreparably damaged. This could result from 
increased conservative demands that the reformist trend be stopped, or at 
least slowed, with implied or real threats not to cooperate with leadership 
changes planned for the September party meeting. It could also be a result 
of a decision by Deng to withdraw his support for Hu Yaobang as his political 
successor because of Hu's poor record for clear and effective leadership. 
Leadership change rumors may represent Deng's effort to gather support for 
alternative arrangements. For his part, Hu Yaobang may have decided to 
strike out on his own, and is seeking to  enhance his own authority within the 
leadership, possibly at Deng's expense. 
Such an exigency is not totally incompatible with some of the available 
evidence. At a minimum, such a factionalization of the Politburo would cause 
the September party meeting to be delayed, if not postponed. Economic reform 
and foreign policies would get put on hold, or could become embroiled in more

strident debate as competing leaders sought support from various segments of 
the party and army. China's policies would likely become more conservative 
and dogmatic as the influence of military and security apparatus leaders 
became more evident. 
Given the potentially dire consequences of such a breakdown at the upper 
levels of the leadership, we believe Deng and other leaders will make every 
effort to avoid such a situation. In our view, however, the Chinese 
political system is not yet sufficiently stabilized or institutionalized to 
rule out the possibility of such a breakdown.
