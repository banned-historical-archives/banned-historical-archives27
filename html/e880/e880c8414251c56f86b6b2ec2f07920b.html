SMJECT: Background Information for DDI Trip to 
Saigon 
1. The Phoenix Program: This is an integrated 
GVN effort to identify and eliminate the Communist 
political infrastructure throughout South Vietnam. 
In the course of obtaining information for this pro-
gram, the CVN regularly comes across information of 
25X1C value to the  national intelligence community in 
Washington. 
The information 25X1C 
acquired through Phoenix on Communist political 
infrastructure, political aims and accomplishments 
is of great interest to the national intelligence 
community and we can use even more of this type of 
information. 
2. Communist Order of Battle: There still 
appear to be ma36Y-3ITYR-CWW-TEween MACV and CIA. 
(Weassume OER will provide the DDI with details.) 
3. Political Re ortin Both on  Communists and 
GVN: Station and Embassy report ng has reflected an 
acute awareness of the importance of reporting on the 
Saigon political situation. Reporting on exactly what 
the GVN is accomplishing or its lack of accomplishment 
in the countryside, however, is still less complete 
and timely than we would like to see. Bits and pieces 
come in but we could use a great deal more detail on 
this subject.

We believe that Communist intentions and progress 
in regard to theA:ommanIste0---new "liberation committees.' 
which are in essence local administration, is of great 
importance and should be a key target of our station. 
The struggle between the GVN and the Communist for 
political control of the people both in the countryside 
and the cities is a major area of concern to the national 
intelligence community. We appreciate the information 
being received currently and hope that the station can 
accomplish even more in reporting on this subject. 
4. Cambodia as a Supply Funnel for the Communists; 
The importance of Cambodia to the Communist efforE-In 
South Vietnam is an area that has been the subject of 
considerable--although lessening--difference of opinion 
between MACV and CIA/Washington intelligence analysts. 
MACV tends to stress the importance of Cambodia's role 
and CIA (with State and DIA in more or less harness) 
tending to downplay its overall impact. 
There is no question that Cambodian territory 
has become more important to the Communists since late 
1965 and the general understanding of this fact has 
tended to narrow the gap between MACV and Washington. 
The only live issue today concerns the shipment of arms 
and ammunition through Cambodia to Communist forces in 
South Vietnam. We agree with Saigon that the Communists 
are getting, at least, important supplementary amounts 
of arms and ammunition through Cambodia. We do not 
believe, however, that the amounts can be quantified 
with any degree of confidence nor do we accept much of 
the "evidence" MACV quotes to support its case. 
5. Renorting Responsibilities of MACV and the  
Station: We are concerned that certain areas of in-
telligence not fall between chairs. 114-laar.tits

all the pertinent information on the amount and effects 
of terrorism, assassination, overrunning of resettlement 
hamlets, etc. This type of information, however, is 
reported through several different channels, raising 
the possibility that there is no real coordination within 
the Mission in Saigon and also raising the possibility 
that some valuable information simply does not get re-
ported back to the strategic level here in Washington at 
all. 
G. The Mission of the Research and Analysis Staff: 
We are interested in ow e COS v ews the mission and 
functioning of the RAS. What contribution does it make 
to the station and could it be of more direct assistance 
to the DDI mission in Washington? Should there and can 
there be a better flow of information between the DDI 
at Headquarters and the RAS? 
7. We are, of course, deeply interested in the 
Station's and in MACV's assessment of the strategic 
situation in South Vietnam. In a recent summation of 
the situation by General Abrams, it appeared that he 
believes a failure on the part of the Communists in their 
present offensive effort would mean that they would then 
be in an overall weakened strategic posture. We tend to 
believe that the Communists are now on the offensive and 
that their failure to accomplish much in the present 
round of fighting might not mean much of a basic change 
in their ability to drag out the conflict should they so 
desire.

The Ma might wish to dise OB two items of concern to 
both OP R and the Agency if he ets with General Davidson 
during his Saigon visit. 
1. MACY 4/4.2 has made straIng allegations that the CIA 
has thrust itself into the general question of OD and enemy 
strengths because of BOZO ugly tottvee. They apparently feel 
that because of some discontent with BRIE 14.3, the DCI

numbers and that wince that tim we have mounted major efforts 
to prove that the till VOA right They also feel that CIA 
has no business in making esti tea of enemy strength. I 
think it would be very helpful if the 11114 would explain to 
General Davidson the background events that brought us into 
' this business and also fill the general in on the DCI 'a

opening of MACV's doors so that prR personnel could go to 
CIC7, CDEC, and the like on extended TDT's for working purposes. 
This can be explained SA a desire to make sure our analysts 
have exploited all available materials in their research par- . 
ticularly when it concerns sensitive estimates. The use of 
this device would be beneficial to our research product and, 
in addition, would help to build up a meaningful dialogue between

No. 1572/68 
The Political Situation in Communist China  
I. There has been a new turning point in the 
violent course of the Cultural Revolution. A 
drive to restore order is in progress, and the 
Red Guards--the shock troops of "revolution"--
have been under heavy attack. 
A. This past spring and early summer saw 
violence in China rise to a new crescendo, 
reaching proportions nearly equal to the 
bloody summer of 1967. 
1. Armed clashes and political infighting 
were particularly intense in southern 
China. 
2. In one province bordering Vietnam the 
four principal cities were gutted by 
fire and at one period the vital rail line 
to Hanoi was disrupted.

Approved For Release 2002/06VeRtlitIDP79T01762A001000060005-7 
B. The new turn came at the end of July, when 
word went out from Peking that violence by 
Red Guards or anyone else was to end--by 
military intervention if necessary. 
1. In most places the army has carried out 
these orders with a will, and Red Guard 
organizations have been badly mauled. 
Many have been destroyed. 
2. The more "radical" Red Guard groups 
responsive to extremists in Peking have 
borne the brunt of the attack. 
3. Vigilante groups organized by provincial 
military authorities have been cracking 
student heads with a vengeance, and 
many old scores are being settled by 
officials previously under Red Guard attack.

4. These vigilante groups are composed of 
workers and led by army troops. They 
have been told that they will occupy 
schools and universities "permanently" 
to see that students never get out of 
line again. 
5. The older students, who tended to be 
leaders of the Red Guard movement, are 
being summarily "graduated," even though 
they have had no schooling in more than 
two years. Many are being sent to 
army-run state farms in remote areas. 
We have one credible report that politi-
cal prisoners are being released from 
a prison mine to make way for these 
so-called "graduates."

6. It is evident from all this that students--
backbone of the Red Guards--are no lon-
ger being treated as the apple of Mao's 
eye or getting his protection. 
C. The change in the political climate in late 
July made it possible to resume the restora-
tion of administrative machinery in the 
provinces. The process of forming new 
governments was started in January 1967, 
but encountered repeated setbacks, and was 
stalled again last spring. Now, however, 
all provinces have new "Revolutionary Com-
mittees" to replace the old provincial party 
secretariats and government councils. 
Three were set up in August and the last 
two on 5 September.

1. Most of the committees, particularly 
those set up in the past six months, 
are dominated by military officials 
who were under radical attack through-
out much of the Cultural Revolution. 
D. People's Daily is again talking about re-
building the party. 
1. This formidable task, however, has 
barely gone beyond the talking stage. 
II. These developments follow two and a half years 
of the most violent kind of political turmoil, 
which at times has brought China to the brink 
of anarchy. It has been a bizarre situation 
in which the regime has, in effect, been con-
ducting revolution against itself.

A. The Cultural Revolution had its origin in 
a wide range of complex factors, but Mao 
Tse-tung unquestionably played a central 
role in setting off the upheaval. 
1. In the early and mid-1960s, Mao ap-
parently felt himself to be increasingly 
at odds with many leading members of 
the Chinese regime. This feeling was 
partly paranoia, partly justified. 
2. Mao believed the Chinese revolution--
his revolution--was running into the 
sands. Revolutionary enthusiasm and elan 
had been lost. 
a. Bureaucratic buck-passing and in-
ertia was growing. Technical ex-
perts were vying with "revolutionary"

generalists for authority in mak-
ing decisions. 
b. The problems of modernizing a huge, 
over-populated and backward country were 
growing rather than decreasing. 
2. Mao's answer to these problems was an 
attempt to rekindle the "revolutionary" 
fervor that had helped bWing him to 
power. 
a. He had apparently developed almost 
mystic faith in the power of "per-
manent revolution" conducted by 
mobilized and indoctrinated masses 
and sought by this means to counter-
act growing cynicism and prevent 
Soviet-style revisionism from

infecting China. 
B. Many officials and probably some important 
members of the regime, however, distrusted 
the kind of unrealistic mass enthusiasm 
that had led to the disasters of the Great 
Leap Forward in the late 1950s. 
1. These men resisted by dragging their 
feet and interpreting Mao's wishes in 
the light of what they themselves re-
garded as sound policy. 
2. This apparently convinced Mao that 
some of the men in line to succeed him 
were selling out the revolution, and 
he moved against them in the fall and 
winter of 1965.

C. Mao's initial attack centered on the pro-
paganda apparatus of the party, which he 
apparently felt had failed in the task of 
maintaining "revolutionary" fervor at a 
high pitch. 
1. The attack on the propaganda machinery 
culminated in the purge of Peng Chen, 
a full member of the politburo, in the 
spring of 1966. 
D. This almost certainly aroused the fears of 
other top leaders, and at the same time up-
set the balance of political power at the 
apex of authority. 
1. They probably reacted defensively, 
forming protective alliances.

2. It seems likely that some of them plot-
ted against the others in an effort to 
exploit the situation for their own 
advantage. 
E. The net effect, in this Byzantine atmosphere, 
was to persuade Mao that many of the men 
close around him were not to be trusted, 
and that the entire party apparatus was 
suspect. 
1. At the famous August plenum in 1966 
the axe fell on Liu Shao-chi--head of 
state and number two man in the party. 
Other veteran leaders soon fell. 
2. Following the plenum Mao and Lin Piao 
unleashed the newly formed Red Guards 
against the entire party.

III. Events began to generate their own momentum as 
the struggle surged back and forth. 
A. Authorities in the provinces sought to 
defend themselves against Red Guard acti-
vists sent out from Peking to bring them 
down. 
1. They organized "Red Guards" of their own 
and pitted them against the interlopers. 
2. They recruited workers and peasants 
with offers of higher wages and a 
larger share of state goods--a practice 
damned by Peking as "economism." 
B. These efforts proved fruitless when the 
army was ordered to restore order at the 
end of January 1967--suppressing both the 
Maoist Red Guards and local groups

defending the provincial leaders. 
1. With their defenses destroyed these 
men fell in large numbers during the 
period of relative calm in February and 
early March. 
2. They were supplanted by military of-
ficials who had leading roles in pro-
visional governing bodies set up at 
that time. 
C. The respite from violent political struggle 
proved to be brief and in the spring Mao 
and the radicals grouped around him launched 
new attacks on "power holders taking the 
capitalist road"--the army men and bureau-
crats who had replaced the purged party of-
ficials.

By early summer armed clashes between 
opposing Red Guard groups had spread 
across the country and were growing in 
intensity.

Maoists the support of the military. 
By the end of the month tensions had 
reached the breaking point and troubles 
were mounting. 
E. More moderate elements, with substantial 
military backing, apparently forced a

Red Guards were curbed and a number of 
other steps were taken toward restoring a

were the result of painful compromise.

still enjoyed many special privileges

F. In late April a new purge of the military--
which included the political demise of the 
army's acting chief-of-staff--ushered in

by the excesses of the "revolution."

aligned with the extremist central

of the establishment seeking to preserve 
the gains achieved since 1949. They would 
not, however, be candidates for the Union

1. All of them are Marxist, all are com-
mitted to preservation of a Communist 
government of some sort. Their basic 
motivation, however, is probably na-
tionalistic.

people have swung over to the opposi-

and economic fabric of China is enormous. 
1. The party apparatus, a fundamental in-
strument of control painstakingly built 
up during the past three decades, has 
been virtually destroyed. 
2. Government machinery has been very hard 
hit and in some areas of activity is 
barely functioning. 
3. The army, the only organization left 
reasonably intact, has been thrown into 
unfamiliar political work for which it 
is ill equipped. Although generally 
loyal and responsive to orders from 
Peking, many units have been deeply in-
volved in divisive political disputes--a

4. Disruptions connected with the Cultural 
Revolution have adversely affected the 
economy. We cannot be sure exactly 
how much damage has been done, but it 
seems likely that serious economic 
trouble was averted last year only by 
an unusually good harvest. The harvest 
this year will be mediocre at best.

of decisive action. 
A. This is suggested by the fact that for the 
first time a major assault has been made 
on the Red Guards, apparently aimed at 
destroying them as a political force. 
1. The Guards were the shock troops of 
the extremists, and virtually their 
only instrument for mass political 
action. 
2. Destroying the Red Guards would, there-
fore, be a logical step before moving 
against "revolutionary" Maoist leaders.

army commanders have not been willing 
to openly defy the Maoists. It is this 
ambivalent position of military men--
they disagree with Mao's policies but

tolerance for it, however, and we 
think Mao will never be satisfied with

however, and probably do not have the 
support for such a move from the

settled scores left from the Cultural 
Revolution. 
2. At best, the kind of collegial leader-
ship which seems likely to evolve will 
probably move uncertainly in its ef-
forts to cope with the problems of re-
construction. 
B. The new leaders will be severely hampered, 
moreover, by the disarray in the machinery 
of government.

the party but it too has suffered 
serious damage and is in need of ex-
tensive repair. 
C. Burdened with these problems, the succes-
sors to the present leadership will be at-
tempting to rule a demoralized and possibly 
a fractious nation.

cause persistent trouble. Once the

forced back into their pre-revolutionary

2. A more serious problem is the develop-
ment of regional and provincial power 
groups pursuing their own ends at the 
expense of the center. Regionalism, 
always a problem in China, has received 
impetus and an opportunity to grow. 
D. Ultimately we would expect to see the 
emergence of a reasonably effective, united 
group of leaders in Peking. They will be

revolutionaries.

I. The South Vietnamese government is now enjoying its 
longest period of relative stability since the days 
of Ngo Dinh Diem. 
A. President Thieu has managed the removal of most 
of Vice President Ky's chief lieutenants from 
key positions with considerable political deftness. 
1. Premier Huong appears to be a decided asset 
to the Thieu government. He is striving to 
give South Vietnam for the first time in years 
an honest administration which addresses itself 
to some of the major ills such as corruption 
and incompetence. 
B. Despite the period of political stability and the 
relatively able leadership of Thieu and Huong, 
enormous problems continue to plague the government. 
1. One such problem has been the failure of the 
GVN to arouse any substantial degree of popular 
enthusiasm or support. This failure is par-
ticularly evident in the countryside. 
2. The Communists have been moving rapidly in the 
post-Tet period to create local administrations 
called "liberation committees" in areas they 
control.

3. Thieu is now somewhat belatedly trying to

unless some effective political organization

elements which he hopes will be able to 
draw eofisiderabtu wilvna govornmAnt, 
has been slow to get off the mark. 
5. An inner cabinet has been formed by Huong to 
lay plans for efforts to gain control of the 
people who are now in contested or Communist-
controlled areas once a cease-fire is declared. 
C. Another major problem which the Thieu-Huong 
administration has been unable to make much of 
a dent in is the widespread and entrenched cor-
ruption which pervades virtually every aspect of 
official dealings with the people.

D. Vice President Ky, thus far, has gone along, 
albeit grudgingly, with his displacement from 
a position of power. 
1. He and his supporters are extremely bitter 
but they do not seem inclined at this point 
to rock the boat by reacting forcefully. 
2. Ky, at times, grumbles about the danger of 
Thieu agreeing to an accommodation with the 
Communists and it is possible that any move 
in this direction by President Thieu could 
trigger a coup attempt by Ky and his fol-
lowers, although their ability to pull one 
off successfully is uncertain. 
PrQPident Thi en' attit-ilde tnward peace talks 
remains that he is willing to meet with repre-
sentatives of North Vietnam but publicly, at 
least, he is opposed to sitting down with the 
Liberation Front. 
1. In private, however, Thieu gives signs of a 
willingness to meet privately and in secret 
with representatives of the Viet Cong. 
2. The South Vietnamese government is also 
somewhat nervous over the US-DRV talks in 
Paris but Thieu seems less concerned over

the danger of a unilateral US move in 
these talks than he was earlier. 
II. South Vietnam's pacification effort was dealt a 
heavy blow by the Communists' Tet offensive. 
Although some recovery has been made, the level 
of pacification is still not back to its pre-Tet 
level. 
A. Given the lack of security in the countryside 
throughout much of the country, there is little 
prospect that major gains will be made over 
the next six months at least. 
1. One recent example of how difficult it is 
to translate our military superiority over 
the Communists' main force units into real 
gains in pacification came in the recent 
fighting around Da Nang. 
2, commnninV main and local force npit9 tnnk 
a terrible beating and lost great numbers 
of men in their efforts to launch an assault 
on Da Nang. 
3. Despite the setback administered to their 
main force units, the Communists were able 
during the same period, in the areas around 
Da Nang to overrun several relocation hamlets,

assassinate a number of village chiefs 
and local government officials and drive 
some RD teams out of their area of opera-
tion. 
5. As a result of the difficulties pacifica-
tion faces, the program has been restructured 
and the teams pulled back largely into areas 
nearby allied bases, urban centers and 
defended lines of communications. 
III. Military losses sustained by ARVN during the Tet 
fighting, placed extraordinary strains upon the 
already serious manpower shortage faced by the South 
Vietnamese army. 
A. Shortly after the Tet offensive, the reserves were 
mobilized with all reservists with less than 5 
years of active service ordered to report by 
15 March. 
1. In addition, all males between 18 and 38 were 
called to serve in the army. Induction of 
19 year olds began on 1 March and 18 year olds 
were drafted beginning on 1 May. 
2. Males 16-17 and 39-50 will be enlisted in the 
civil self-defense forces.

B. As a result of these call-ups, the strength of 
the armed forces was raised by about 120,000 
by 30 June. 
1. It is anticipated that by the end of the 
year the total strength of the ARVN will be 
over 800,000. 
C. However, the combined effect of the drastic rise 
in manpower input for the army and the lack of 
adequate exemptions for vital civilian govern-
mental and service functions has adversely affected 
certain key administrative operations, particu-
larly at provincial and district levels.

Cambodia: 
I. Cambodia remains an important asset to the Com-
munists both in terms of a safe haven for their 
forces to rest and refit after battles and also 
as a supplementary channel for moving arms, 
munitions and other war materials into Communist 
base areas in South Vietnam. 
A. 
The Cambodians 
rice for North 
are an important source of 
Vietnamese units encamped along 
the Cambodia-South Vietnam border in the 
western highlands. 
1. Recent interrogations of captured Viet 
Cong detainees offer the best evidence 
to date that Cambodia is being used to 
move arms and ammunition to Communist 
' forces in South Vietnam. 
B. There is no good evidence that the Cambodian 
government is conniving with the Communists in 
this traffic but it is clear that some local 
Cambodian officials are involved and that others 
make no effort to halt the activity.

Laos: 
SECRET 
The Laotian infiltration and logistics corridor 
remains a yital element in the Communists' ability 
to pursue the war in South Vietnam. 
A. The number of North Vietnamese troops estimated 
to be traveling down the infiltration trails 
reached unprecedented levels during the last 
few months. 
1. Some 30,000 infiltrators are believed to 
have entered the pipeline during each of 
the months of March, April and May. Due 
to the fact that it takes between two and 
four months for a group to make the trip, 
many of those who departed North Vietnam 
in the spring are just now arriving in 
the south. 
2. The level of men entering the infiltration 
pipeline declined in June, July and August, 
probably because the enemy has rebuilt his 
forces to the planned level following the 
immense losses suffered in the Tet and May 
offenses. 
B. The Communist road network through Laos has been 
expanded and improved to the extent that the

no such traffic was noted in this key pass
