		     	~rticle  by  Dai  Huian  /'E071  1920  13447  and  Chen  Shenggeng  %7115  3932  16497:    	"Three
				Ideas  on  the  Strengthening  of  Tactical  Training"
				LText7  When  w~e  interviewed  the  Yunnan  border  defense  forces,  cadres  and  soldiers  who
				took  part  in  fighting  told  us:    	The  r~ascri  our  counterattack  was  carried  out  so
				remarkably  well  is  inseparably  linked  with  our  staff  peacetime  training.  However,
				actual  combat  also  exposed  sane  problems  that  had  already  shown  up  in  peacetime  training
				exercises;  conspicuous  among  these  were  problems  connected  with  tactical  training.
				They  raised  three  points  which  in  their  opinion  should  be  improved  with  regard  to
				tactical  training,   	namely:
				1.    	Tactical  training  must  start  out  from  the   	realities.    	Its  content  and  key  points
				must  be  determined  with  reference  to  the  training  outline  and  according  to  the  nature
 '		    	of  the  prospective  enemy,   	area  of  combat  and  the  cambat  tasks  that  the  unit  is
				charged  with.   	Higher   	a~ithorities  must  not  centralize  control  too  rigidly,  and  the
				lower  levels  must  not  merely  engage  in  mechanically  copying  what  had  been  said  or
				written.    	The  troops  stationed  in  the  south  must  particularly  be  trained  to  cope  with
				the  special  features  of  terrain  ar..d  weather  in  the  subtropical  mountainous  jungles.
				They  must  study  offensive  and  defensive  fighting  in  mountainous  regions,   	ambush  and
				counterambush,   	contact  battle,   	scouting,  wiping  out  enemy  pockets  and  other  such
				tactics  so  that  the  soldiers  will  acquire  the  skills  to  fight  in  every  kind  of
			 	terrain,   	faced  with  visible  pillboxes  and  hidden  bunkers,   	"cat  caves"   	trenches,
			 	shelters,   	tunnels  and  natural  caves.
			 	2.    	Major  efforts  must  be  devoted  to  studying  the  special  characteristics  of  the  enemy's
				combat  methods.    	In  the  past  our  studie~  of  the  establishment,   	equipment  and  s~ecial
				combat  tactics  of  the  enemy  were  inadequate.    	During  the  actual  fighting  we  found  out
			 	that  the  Vietnamese  army  used  four  special  tactics:    	resist,   	run,  hide,   	change.
				That  means,   	at  the  start,   	resist  the  attack;   	when  unable  to  resist  any  longer,   	run
			 	(break  up  into  small  groups);  when  unable  to  escape,  hide   	(in  dense  forests  or  caves);
				when  unable  to  hide,   	ctrange   	(into  civilian  clothes).    	Faced  with  these  special
				practices,   	we  were  clever  enough  to  change  our  tactics  and  finally  had  the  initiative
  _		     	in  our  hands.    	Everybody  agreed  that  in  future  training  we  must  make  an  effort  to
  ~		     	study  the  enemy  forces  and  thus  evolve  tactics  that  will  lead  to  victory.

	    	3.    	We  stro~igly  emphasize  that  the  level  of  tactical  thinking  amon9  lower  level
	    	officers  must  be   	raised.    	The  main  problem  with  grassroots  cadres  is  that  tinydirecting
  ,	   	flexibility  anc]  have  little  capability  for  combat  organization,  especially
	     	operations  in  situations  when  troop~  are  widely  dispersed.    	They  also  lackAt  thebearly
	     	knowledge  for  c~mmanding  troops   	(such  as  map  reading,  use  of  maps,  etc).
	     	stage  of  an  engagement,   	s ane  officers  lacked  the  ability  to  make  rapid  and  clever  use
	     	of  their  troops,   	their  firepower,   	the   	increased  variety  of  weapons,  or  failed  to
	     	exploit  the  effects  af  banbardments  for  a  charge  against  the  enemy  lines.    	Of  course
	     	we  must  not  blame  the  lower  level  cadres  for  these  problems;   	the  main  reason  for
	     	them  is  that  the  leadership  organs   	in  training  the  cadres  merely  emphasi~ed  technical
	     	skills  and  neglected  tactical  skills.    	This  weakness  must  be  promptly  overcome  in
	     	future  and  the  task  of  tactical  training  of  cadres  must  be   	firmly  taken  in  hand.
									   	Stressing  Tactical  Skills

	     	LArticle  by  Yang  Zhenhua  ~1799  2182  54787,  platoon  ~ea~er  of  Hong-yi  company  of  a
			certain  unit  of  the  Guangxi  borde~  defense  force  and  recipient  of  inerit  citation  Class
  -	    	2:    	"Rid  Ourselves  of  the  Mentality  of  Attaching  Great  Importance  to  Technical  Skills
			and  Neglecting  Tactical  Skills"
			~~'I'ext7  Our  p.latoon  took  part  in  four  battles  during  our   	self-defense  coointsaandcover
			fighting.    	We  killed  36  of  the  enemy  and  destroyed  the  enemy's  firing  p
			20  of  his  caves  of  hiding.    	We  gained  experi.ence  and  also  learned  lessons  in  these
			battles,   	the  most  profound  lesson  being  that  our  peacetime  training  does  not  yet  fully
			meet  the  demands  of  actual  combat.
		 	In  the  past,  quite  a  number  of  comrades  were  of    	the  opinion  that  while  technical
		 	training  had  norms  and  targets,   	tactical  training  has  no  proper  configurations.    	No
  -	    	tin~e  and  energy  was  spared  to  make  a  concentrated  effott  with  regard  to  circular
		 	numbers  and  metric  numbers,   	but  tactical  items  which  cannot  be  measured  in  figures
		 	were  left  aside  as  a  matter  of  no  consequence.    	For  instance,   	in  peacetime  training
  -	     	Iittle  was  done  as  to  studying   	the  tactical  characteristics  of  the  enemy  or  coordinating
		 	exercises  with  infantry  and  machinegun  units,   	tank  units  and  artillery.   	WensaWtthat
		 	combat~   	all  these  problems  are  very  important.    	In  the  present  fighting
		 	the  Vietnamese  deployed  their  troop  strength  and  support  firepower  weaker   	in  front
		 	and  stronger  further  to  the  rear.    	Firepower  mobility  was  coordinated  with  troop
		  	strength  mobility.    	When  the  exposed  fortifications  were  successfully  overcome   	in
		  	the  fighting,   	the  concealed  defense  works  suddenly  opened  fire  as  soon  as  our  men
		  	approached  close  enough.    	Some  even  waited  until  ~ur  at~acking  force  had  passed,   	then
		  	revived  firing  points,   	shooting  at  our  troops  from  the   	flanks  and  the  rear  and  using
		  	small  guns  and  other   	firepower   	on  the  flanks  for  a  counterattack.    	As  we  had  given
		  	little  attention  to  studying  special  enemy  tactics  during  our  training,   	our  troops  in
		  	the  initial  stages  of  the  fighting  kept  in  close  formation  and  lacked  all  experience
		  	as  to  how  to  move  under  enemy  fire,   	how  to  advance  by  squads  providing  co~ver  for~each
		  	other  alternately,  changing  of  various  battle  formations  and  the  utilization  of  terrain
		  	and  surface  features.    	This  resulted   	in  quite  a  few  casualties.    	Later,   	in  ac~aduall
		  	combat  we  learned  how  to  fight  and  how  to  draw  lessons  from  our  experience,  g	     	Y
		  	gaining  the  initiative.    	Our  experience  of  success  and  :Eailure  taught  us  that  good
		  	technical  knowledge  can  on].y  be  fully  effective   	in  coordination  with  g~od  tactics.

		    	Actually,   	the  technical  subjects  all  have  certain  st~ndards  that  can  be  achieved  without
		    	taking  up  much  time,  but  ta~tical  subjects  cannot  be  measured  in  figures,   	and  only

		    	have  one  pitted  against  10  of  the  ener~y.
		    	This  is  a  point  that  the  ne~Z~r  enli~teci  s~Zdi.ers  r~alized  v~ry  well  through  their

		     	~ext7  The  experience  of  our  defensive  counterattack  against  the  Vietnamese  proves
		     	that  in  modern  warfare   	it  is  necess~ary  not  only  to  have  close  coordination  between
		     	large  bodies  of  troops,   	but  that  coordination  between  battalions,   	regxments  and  small
		     	units,   	between  infantry  and  artillery  and  between  infantry  and  tank  units,   	is  also  of
		     	decisive  importance.    	If  we  look  at  the  past  tactical  training  af  our  troops   	ira  the
		     	light  of  actual  combat  experience,  we  find  much  that  needs  to  be  improved.
		     	Tactical  training  today   	is  mostly  carried  out  l~y  on~  arm  of  the  service  alone,   	seldom
		     	by  several  arms  of  the  service  together,  and  even  less  in  combined  tactical  exercises
		     	with  real  weapons,   	real   	tanks,   	live  ammuniti~n  and  live  bombs.    	Firing  of  live
		     	artillery  shells  by  single  guns  or  by  a  battalian   	(as  a  group)   	is  carried  out  an  the
		     	shooting  iange.    	The   	tank  units  undergo  speci.al  training  only  by  themselves  and
		     	seldom  in  tactical  exercises  with  the  infantry.    	Coordinated  exeraises  of  infant:.y
  _		   	and  tanks  or  infantry  and  artillery,   	so  fundamental  in  actual  combat,   	are  basically
		     	handled  as   	"on  paper   	only,"  except  in  some  demonstration  exercises.    	Even  the  various
		     	weapons  that  the  infantry  is  equipped  with  are  seldom  used  with  live  ammunition  in
				tactical  exercises.    	For   	instance,   	the   	"overhead  fire,"  often  used  in  combat  by  light
				and  heavy  machineguns   	in  support  of  the  infantry,   	is  seldom  practiced  in  combin~d
				tactical  exercises.    	From  basic  tactical  training  to  combined  tactical  exercises  the
				troops  shoot  blank  ammunition,   	fire  "dumb"  cannon  shells  and  detonate  satchel  charges,

	     	tsaining  at  a  very  low  level  for  a  long  time.
	     	How  can  we  render  the  arm~'s  tactical  training  closer  to  combat  conditions?    	Integrating
  ~	   	the  experience  gained  by  the  border  defense  forces  in  their  training  in  combat,  when
	     	in  only  1  month  they  completed  the  battalion's  combined  training  with   	real  weapons  and
	     	live  anununition,   	and  drawing  on  the  experier~ce  of  foreign  troops  in  their  emphasis  az~
	     	combined  exercises  of  the  various  arms  of  the  service  with  live  ammunition,  it  is  my
	     	opinion  that  the  whole  body  of  troops  in  training   	(or  parts  thereof)   	should,  at  the
	     	end  of  their  annual  basic  technical  and  tactical  training,  organize  combined  tactical		  	;
	     	exercises  of  varying  dimensions  of  forces  and  weapons,  possibly  to  be   	reinforced  anc7
	     	supplemented  in  wartime,   	joined  in  by  variais  arms  of  the  service  and  using  the  "four
			real  things."    	Due  to  the  shortage  of  ammunition  for  training  exercises,   	it  might  be
	     	Gonsidered  to  have  the  higher  authority  combine  the  annual  or  semiannual  practice
			shooting  with  live  ammunition  of  the  various  arms  of  the  service  with  the  tactical
			training  exercises  u~ing  the  "four  real  things."    	In  these  combined  exercises  closel.y

  -	    	coordination  of  the  various  arms  of  the  se=uice  and  th~�  effectiveness   	of  the  various
			firearms.    	They  could  directl~~  test  the  effects  of  the  army's  technical  and  tactical
			training.    	It  would  raise  the  command  ability  of  the  cadres  and  the  capability  of  the

		    	Heroism;   	His  Shzlls  Hit  Wherever  the  Enemy  Flees"]
		    	LText7  Chen  Wanfu,  widely  known  as  a  skillful  gunner,  squad  leader  of  the  ~d  battalion
		    	of  a  certain  unit  of  the  Guangxi  defense  force,   	led  his  squad  in  courageous  battles
		    	during  the  fighting  to  repel  the  Vietnamese  aggressors.    	Under  various  difficult  con-
		    	ditions,  he  fired  117  rounds  from  his  82-mm  mortar  at  the  rate  of  over  90  percent  hits
		    	on  target  in  powerful  support  of  the  fighting  men  of  the  infantry.    	The  party  committee
		    	at  the  higher  level  awarded  Chen  a  merit  citation  Class  2  and  promoted  him  to  plataon
 -		   	leader.
		     	In  our  counterattack  in  self-defense,   	the  unit  to  which  Chen  belonged  was  to  thrust
		     	deep  into  the  enemy  lines.    	In  a  day  and  night  operation  of  bold  forward  attacks,   	the
		     	mortar  neverleft  his  shoulder  during  the  conStant  push  forward.    	Leading  his  squad  up
		     	high  mountain  ranges  anc3  through  dense  forests,  he  followed  the  infantry  wherever
		     	they  charged  the  enemy.    	In  thP  afiternoon  of  21  February,  when  the  unit  was  just
		     	about  to  cross  a  valley  in  the  mountains,   	it  was  pinned  down  by  fire  from  the  enemy
		     	hidden  in  a  bamboo  grove.    	Chen  led  his  squad  to  s~eedily  occupy  a  suitable  launching
		     	site.    	To  save  time,  he  used  a  simple  firing  method  practiced  in  geacetime.    	With  the
  ~		   	thrust  of  both  hands  he  furiously  rammed  the  mortar  base  into  the  ground.    	With  his
		     	left  hand  he  adjusted  the  direction  of  fire  and  the  quadrant  angle  of  elevation,  and
  _		   	with  his  right  hand  he  inserted  the  shells.    	The  first  shot  was  right  on  target.    	He
		     	f_ollowed  up  with  two  more  shots  which  exploded  among  the  enemy.    	At  that  time  the
  -		   	enemy,   	halfway  up  the  mountain  to  his  right,  had  spotted  him  and  sent  aver  a  salvo  of
		     	machinegun  fire.    	This  did  not  intimidate  Chen  in  the  least.    	He  quickly  turned  and
		     	fired  off  three  shells  that  whistled  wer  and  silenced  the  enemy  machinegun.    	The  army
		     	unit  quickly  saized  the  opportunity  to  rush  throucih  the  once-blockaded  line.
		     	Day  and  night  during  the  counterattack  in  self-defense,  Chen  felt  a  strong  sense  of
				responsibility  toward  his  fatherland  and  his  people  and  always  acted  steadfastly  and
		     	cool-hea~~edly.    	He  used  every  possible  means  to  accomplish  the  tasks  assigned  to  him
		     	by  his  superiors.    	One  day,   	the  positions  of  the  4th  canpany  came  under  fire  from  the
		     	enemy's   	60-mm  guns.    	The  commander  ordered  Chen  to  counterattack  with  his  mortar.    	At
				that  time  visibility  was  bad  and  as  the  cunning  enemy  fired  only  intermittently,  Chen
		     	had  a  hard  time  making  out  his  target  and  its  ciistance.  He  applied  skills  learned  in

	   	deserves  to  be  called  a  marvellous  gunner!"
	    	In  all  his  battles,  Chen  made  full  use  of  what  he  had  learned  in  peacetime  military
	    	exercises  and  had  at  his~disposal  a  variety  of  tactics  that  Waseordered~toesupportd

	    	the   	infantry  were  spread  out  under  cover  to  examine  the  terrain  and  assess  where  Would
	    	enemy  would  emerge,  wrere  they  would  offer  resistance  and  in  what  direction  they
	    	flee.    	Chen  measured  the  different  distances,  calculated  th~  various  gauges  and  deter-
	    	mined  the  various  firing  methods.    	When  the  infantry  had  advanced  halfway  up  a  certain
	    	elevation  and  became  blocked  by  heavy  enemy  fire,   	orders  arrived  fran  above  to
	    	supp ort  them  with  artillery  fire.    	Chen  led  his  squad  in  launching  mortar  fire,  which
	     	fell  so  accurately  on  target  it  was  as  if  the  shells  had  grown  eyes,   	and  this  caught
	     	the  enemy  c anpletely  by  surprise.    	By  that  time  the  other  artillery  squads  had  also
	     	occupied  good  launching  sites  and  Chen  clirected  his  awn  squad  and  the  other  brotherly
	     	squads  to  open  fire  together.    	When  the  infantry  saw  haw  the  shells  rained  dawn  on

		    	Guidance,  Strong  Administrative  Control--The  Method  of  Unit  84843:    	How  to  Deal  with
		    	Problems  Arising  From  Soldiers  Buying  Radios?"
						~ext]  The  rescinding  by  some  army  units  of  the  prohibition  on
						soldiers  purchasing  radios  was  enthusiastically  welcomed  by  the
						soldiers.    	Many  soldiers  used  the  radios  to  learn  about  politics,
						gain  scientific  and  cultural  knowledge  and  enrich  their  cultural
						and  recreational  life.    	Obviously,   	this  is  a  good  thing  and  it
						was  only  right  to  do  so.
					 	However,   	in  some  units  new  problems  arose  from  the  fact  that
					 	soldiers  bought  radios.  How  to  han~le  these  problems?    	Some
					 	units  gained  the  experience  that  one  should  above  all  think  of
					 	the  need  for  modernizing  the  army  and  not  "give  up  eating  for
					 	fear  of  choking."    	As  to  the  problems  that  arise,   	they  should  be
					 	given  deep  and  painstaking  thought;  correct  guidance  and  strong
					 	administrative  control  should  be  exercised,   	supplemented  by
					 	necessary  regulations.    	All  this  will  of  course  require  much
					 	additional  work  and  some  additional  "bother."    	Haaever,   	in  our
					 	effort-s  to  conform  with  the  shift  in  the  emphasis  of  work,  we
					 	must  not  merely  pursue  the  simple  and  easy  when  we  study  new
					 	conditions  and  solve  new  problems.
		     	When  the  news  spread  that  the  political  department  of  the  Guangzhou  military  units
				had  rescinded  the  pzohibition  on  soldiers  buying  radios,  many  soldiers  of  Unit  84843
				were  extremely  happy  and~rushed  to  tell  each  other   	the  news.    	In  less  than  a  month's
				time,   	over  40  solc3iers  had  bought  radios,   	using  them  to  listen  to  the  news  and  to  acquire
				scientific  and  cultural  knowledge.    	After  meals  ar~d  after  classes,   	they  also  enjoyed
				the  literary  and  art  programs.    	In  this  way  they  broadened  their  horizons  and  increased
				their   	knowledge,   	and  at  the  same  time  invigorated  life  in  the  canpany.
  -		    	However,   	as  more  soldiers  bought  radios,   	new  problems  arose.    	Some  soldiers  would  .
				listen  to  their   	radios  at  all  times  and  in  all  places,   	not  only  during  military  training
				lectures  and  while  on  duty,  but  even  after  lights  out,   	thus  adversely  affecting  Lhe

	   	normal  order  of  life.    	Some  soldiers,  victims  of  curiosity,  even  listened  to  forbidden
	   	broadcasts.    	Some  soldiers  br~ught  large   	instruments  that  not  only  proved  to  be  in
	   	the  way  at  alarm  assemblies  but  also  impaired  the   	internal  uniformity  and  tidiness.
	   	What  to  do  about  it?    	In  the  opinion  of  the  leadership  organs  and  cadres  at  all  levels
	   	of  this  army  unit,   	allowing  the  saldiers  to  buy  radios  brought  many  benefits,   	and  the
	   	problems  that  arose  could  be  dealt  with  satisfactorily  if  only  proper  guidancP  was
	    	r~ndered.    	Many  companies  used  the  routine  squad  meetings  to  organize  repeated  studies
	    	of  the  resolution  issued  by  the  Third  Plenary  Sessiai  of  the  llth  CCP  Central  Committee
	    	to  clarify  the  task  of  modernization,  demanding  of  the  soldiers  an  even  higher  level
	    	of  scientific  and  cultural  knowledge  and  correct  handling  by  everybody  of  the
	    	relationship  of  study  and  recreation.    	They  directed  attention  to  listeninq  to  news
	    	and  lectures  on  scientific  and  cultural  topics  and  also  regularly  commended  those  men
	    	who  hud  made  exemp"lary  use  of  radios,   	so  as  to  enc~~urage  eyeryone  to  study  science  and
 -	  	cultural  subjects.    	Chen  Dewei  L'7115  2867  0251'7,   	a  soldier  of  the  second  company  of
	    	rocket  artillery,   	diligently  listened  to  the  radio  lectures  on  scientific  and  cultural
	    	topics  and  was  thus  able  to  speedily  raise  his  level  of  scientific  and  cultural
	    	knowledge,  so  that  the  party  branch  of  his  company  made  him  a"little  teacher."
	    	In  order  to  maintain  normal  order  and  unity  of  action,   	several  companies  also  set
	    	forth  four  demands  concerning  the  operation  of  radios  by  soldiers:    	1)   	Radios  must  not
	    	be  operated  during   	regular  classes  or  collective  activities,  after  bedtime,  on  guard
	     	or  on  other  duties,   	and  the  radio  must  not  be  tuned  to  forAign  broadcasts.    	2)  When
	     	not  in  use,   	radios  must  be  kept  uniformly  in  certain  places  and  not  left  about  indis-
	     	criminately.    	On  marches  with  heavy_pack  and  at  alarm  assemblies,   	no  large  radios  can
	     	be  taken  along.    	3)   	In  ordinary  circumstances,   	the  daily  news  items  and  lectures  on
	     	scientific  and  cultural  topics  are  all  to  be  listened  to  collectively;   	literary  and
	     	art   	items  may  be  listened  to  only  outside  of   	regular  class  time  and  on  holidays.
	     	4)   	Soldiers  who  live  with  their  families  in  straitened  circumstances  must  consider
  =	   	the   	reality  of  their  situation  and  not  borrow  money  to  purchase  radios.    	If  they
	     	need  to  listen  to  certain  programs,  they  may  use  the  company's  communal  radio.

		     	"Eliminate  Misunderstandings,  Open  Up  Ideological  Channels,  Strengthen  Solidarity']
  ~		  	LR'ex)  Since  the  beginning  of  March  this~  year,  Wang  Zhengtian  /37b9  2973  394>,  com-
		    	mander  of  a  division  of  engineer  troops,   	together  with  Yang  Guochen  ~799  0948  52567,
  ~		   	political  commissar,   	spent  ovEr  40  days  visiting  the  various  regiments  of  their
		    	division  one  by  one  for  an  intimate  discussion  to  solicit  opinions  and  clear  up  mis-
		    	understandings  so  as  to  enhance  solidarity.
		     	In  February  this  year,   	at  the  enlarged  meeting  called  by  the  divisional  party  com-
		     	mittee  to  study  the  thorough  implementation  of  the  spirit  of  the  Third  ~Alenary
		     	Session,  comrades  aired  many  complaints  concerning  the  divisional  leadership.    	Duz
		     	to  the  limits  of  time,   	the  cadres  of  some  regiments  did  not  have  sufficient  opportunity
		     	to  be  heard  at  the  meeting,   	and  so~ne  were  apprehensive  and  did  not  fully  reveal  what
		     	was  on  their  minds.    	At  the  conclusion  of  the  meetxnq,  division  commander  Wang
		     	2hengtian  and  political  commissar  Yang  Guochen  came  to  the  conclusion  that  to  conform
		     	with  the  shift  of  emphasis  in  the  work  of  the  ~party  and  to  concentrate  all  energies
		     	on  an  effective  modernization  of  the  military  units,   	it  was  necessary  first  of  all
		     	to  achieve  unity  between  the  leaderships  at  the  divisional  and  the  regimental  levels,
		     	reach  a  common  understandirig  and  take  aoncerted  action.    	The  two  men  therefore
		     	decided  to  proceed  together  and  seek  out  the  leading  cadres  of  the  various  regiments
		     	one  by  one  for  heart-to-heart  talks  and  thus  work  toward  enhancing  solidarity.
		     	In  these  heart-to-heart  discussions,  commander  W3n3  and  commissar  Yang  listened
		     	attentively  to  the  opinions  aired  by  the  comrades  and  accepted  justified  criticism
		     	with  open  minds.    	It  happened  that  last  year  the  commander  of  a  certain  regiment  dis-
		     	agreed  with  the  division  in  the  way  certain  engineering  projects  were  planned  and
		     	arranged.    	Things  were  said  that  should  not  have  been  said.    	Commander  Wang  had
		     	criticized  the  regimeiital  commander  several  times,  and  misunderstandyngs  had  arisen
		     	between  the  two.    	During  the  present  heart-to-heart  talk,  he  brought  it  all  out  into
		     	the  open.    	After  listening  attentively,  commander  Wang  discovered  that  in  his  past
		     	criticisms  he  had  not  been  sufficientl.y  mindful  of  such  aspects  as  an  analysis  of
		     	the  underlying  reasons,   	providing  occasions  for  discussion  and  keeping  within  the
		     	proper  limits  of  speech,   	etc,   	and  thereupon,   	on  his  own  initiative,   	submirted  a  self-
		     	criticism,   	and  at  the  same   	time  pointed  out  his  inability  to  handle  correctly  the
		     	relationship  between  the  section  and  the  overall  situation.    	In  his  heart-to-heart
		     	talk  with  the  political  commissar  of  the  regiment  concerned,  commander  Wang  made

	    	other  side  also  earnestly  examined  the  problems  that  ~xisted  in  themselves.    	As  a
	     	result,   	the  misunderstanding  was  removed  and  greater.trust  between  the  two  was
	     	established.    	A  regimental  deputy  commander  who  had  been  somewhat  wronged  in  the  past
	     	had   	rather  strong  complaints  against  some  in  the  divisional  leadership.    	In  this
	     	heart-to-heart  talk,   	eommander  Wang  and  commissar  Yang  earnestly  listened  to  his
	     	complaints,  examined  the  mistaken  metha]s  that  had  been  used  against  him  and  helped
	     	him  "relieve  himself  of  his  mental  burden."    	He  was  deeply  touched  and  said:    	If  the
	     	leadership  on  their  own  initiative  come  to  our  doorstep  for  a  heart-to-heart  talk,
	     	half  of  the  resentment  is  gone,   	and  if  this  is  followed  by  an  earnest  heart-to-heart
	     	talk,   	all  resentment  is  completely  eliminated.
	     	Commander  Wang  and  commissar  Yang  also  took  care  to  foc~-.on  the  shortcomings  and
	     	weaknesses  of  certain  comrades,   	and  through  frank  discussion  that  emphasized  tradition
	     	and  workstyle,   	they  patiently  and  painstakingly  rendered  assistance  and  education.
	     	There  was  a  young  cadre  who  on  being  appointed  regimental  deputy  commander  put  on
	     	great  airs  and  demanded  better  pay  and  treatment,   	thereby  incurring  the  criticism  of
			the  masses.    	Commander  Wang  and  commissar  Yang   	repeatedly  lectured  him  on  the  principle
			that  leading  cadres  must  give  much  ta  the  people  but  demand  little  from  the  people,
  _	    	and  thus  inspired  him  to  make  a  conscious  effort  to  remedy  his  shortcomings.    	There
			was  a  regimental  commander  who  was  passive  about  benefiting   	from  past  experience  and
			lessons.    	He  showed  little  spirit  to  take  charge  of  work.    	Commander  Wang  then  spoke
			to  him  about  his  own  past  and  his  experiences  when  he,  Wang,  was  regimental  commander
			and  in  this  way  helped  this  man  correctly  sum  up  the  experiences  and  lessons  of  the
			past.    	Commander  Wang  and  commissar  Yang  learned  that  there  was  a  man  in  an  important
			leadership  position  in  one   	regiment  who  was  incanpetent  as  to  leading  the  cadres  in
			assistant  positions  to  play  their  full  role,  which  had  an  adverse  effect    	on  the  soli-
			darity  and  on  work.    	Wang  and  Yang  pointed  out  the  essentials  of  a  division  of  labor,
			etc,   	so  that  the  cadres  in  assistant  positions  gained  the  due  powers  of  their  offices,
			and  work  was  effectively  accomplished  as  a  joint  effort.
			As  to  some  questio~zs  in  the  work  of  modernization  of  all  units  of  the  division,   	such
  -	    	as  how  to  insist  on  having  construction  constitute  the   	-ore  work  and  how  to  strengthen
			political  and  ideological  work,   	commander  Wang  and  commissar  Yang  explored  these
		 	questions  in  these  heart-to-heart  meetings  in  their  discussions  with  all  concerned,
		 	then  based  their  conclusions  on  the  collective  wisdom  and  all  useful  ideas  presented,
		 	to  arrive  finally  at  feasible  metha3s  to  be  adopted.    	In  the  past,  they  had  only  hazy
		 	notions  of  the  ideological  and  work  conditions  of  many  cadres  serving  with  the
		 	regiments.    	Through  the  present  heart-to-heart  talks,   	they  gained  a  fairly  complete
		 	understanc7ing  and  discovered  several  unreasonable  conditions  in  the  way  the  cadres  were
		 	being  used  and  dealt  with.    	They  prepared  a  report  to  the  divisional  party  committee
		 	and  planned  readjustments.    	On  the  basis  of  these  heart-to-heart  talks,   	the  standing
		 	committee  of  the  divisional  party  committee  furthermore  planned  to  start  special
		 	studies  on  the  question  of  strenqthening  the  party  committee  teams  and  building  up  the
		 	cadre  contingent,   	and  to  determine  concrete  measures  in  this   	respect.    	The  general
  -	     	reaction  among  the  regimental  cadres  was  that~the  present  heart-to-heart  talks  helped
		 	to  strengthen  out  the   	ideology,   	restore  ease  of  mind  and  arouse  greater  &~nthusiasm
		 	for  the  energetic  pursuit.of  the  four  modernizations.

		    	Existing  Weapons  and  Equipment"7
 r		  	~ext7  Along  with  the  shift  in  emphasis  of  the  work  of  the  whole  party,   	the  emphasis
		     	in  the  work  of  the  armed  forces  has  been  shifted  to  accelerating  the  building  of  a
		    	modern  revolutionary  army.    	If  we  carry  out  the  shift  in  the  emphasis  of  the  armed
		     	forces'   	work,  what  principles  should  we  observe,   	and  where  should  we  begin?    	2'he
  -		   	Central  Committee  Military  Commission  has  already  made  it  clear  that  we  must  continue,
		     	in  a  down-to-earth  manner,   	to  implement  thoroughly  the  guiding  principles,   	tasks,  and
		    	methods  decided  upon  by  the  expanded  conference  of  the.Military  Commission  in  1975,
		     	the  Military  Commission  meeting  in  1977,  and  the  Whole  Forces  Political  Work  Conference
		     	in  1978,   	all  under  the  quidance  of  the  spirit  of  the  Third  Plenary  Session  of  tne  llth
		     	Party  Central  Committee.    	These  principles,  decided  upon  by  the  Military  Commission,
		     	are  thoroughly  appropriate  to  the  actual  conditions  in  our  armed  forces  and  are
		     	extraordinarily  correct.
		     	The  general  principles,   	tasks,   	and  methads  determined  by  these  three  meetings  of  the
		    	Military  Commission  have  a  thoroughly  distinctive  thought  running  through  them,  which
		     	is  that  we  must  carry  out  the  guiding  principles  oF  "The  military  must  reorganize"
		     	and  "We  must  be  prepared  to  fight;"  restore  and  develop  our  armed  forces'   	excellent
		     	~radition  under  the  new  historical  conditions;   	and  build  our  army  into  a  modern
		     	revolutionary  army  on  the  basis  of  existing  weapons  and  equipment.    	Most  comrades  are
		     	clear  on  this  point,   	but  some  still  lack  a  correct  perception  of  it.    	Some  of  them
		     	feel  that  if  we  are  to  shift  the  emphasis  of  work,  we  should  bring  in  a  whole  new
		     	formula;   	otherwise,   	"old  men  and  old  knives  will  put  on  the  same  old  show,"  and  this
		     	would  be  nothing  like  modernization.    	Others  feel  that  if  we  are  to  modernize,  we  must
		     	have  modern  weapons  and  equipment,   	for  "if  equipment  is  not  improved,   	the  emphasis
		     	will  not  be  shifted  well,   	since  shifting  or  not  shifting  i:,  all  the  same  to  bayonets
		     	and  hand  grenades;"   	thus  they  view.modernization  as  purely  the  replacing  of  weapons
		     	and  equipment.    	The  common  problem  in  both  of  these  one-sided  perceptions  is  that
		     	they  discard  the  existing  foundations  and  do  not  start  from  the  real  conditions  of
		     	our  country  and  ou~r  army  at  present.
		     	Just  as  all  tall  buildings  must  start  from  level  ground,  whatever  we  do  cannot  be
		     	separated  from  our  actual  foundations.    	Construction  of  a  modern  revolutionary  army
		     	must  be  on  the  basis  of  the  reality  of  our  country  and  our  army,  and  must  be  done  from

	    	Mao  Zedong  pointed  out  that  the  Ck~inese  People's  Liberation  Army,   	from  its  original
	     	foundations,   	should  be  built  into  an  exceller.t  mode.rn  revolutionary  army.    	He  demon-
	     	strated  that  the  building  of  our  army  should  be  based  on  the  existing  foundation
	    	with  a  view  to  the  direction  of  futur~  development.    	According  to  Comrade  Mao
	     	Zedong's  indications,   	our  army,   	tk~rough  the  exertions  of  the  whole  army,   	had  advanced
	     	a  large  step  toward  modernization  and  had  gradually  developed  into  a  composite
	     	military  force  having  various  service  arms  on  a  commensurate  scale.    	At  present  our
	     	army  is  conducting  a  shift  in  the  emphasis  of  its  work  and  is  speeding  up  the  advance
	     	toward  the  goal  of  being  a  modern   	revolutionary  army  ~to  an  even  nigher  level,   	this
	     	being  a  requirement  for  preparedness  and  the  situation  and  demand  for  protecting  our
	     	four  modernizations  and  stabilizing  the  dictatorship  of  the  proletariat.    	If~we  do  not
	     	modernize  and  do  not  accelerate  the  achievement  of  modernization,  we  will  not  greatly
	     	increase  our  army's  combat  strength  but  will  be  passive  and  vulnerable  to  attack,   	in
	     	which  case  it  will  be  difficult  ~o  complete  successfully  the  protection  of  our
	     	country's  spiritual  mission.    	However,  modernization  of  the  armed  forces  cannot  be
	     	divorced  from  the  foundation  presented  by  the  national  econ any,  cannot  be  divorced
	     	from  the  modernization  of  agriculture,   	industry,   	or  science  and  technology,   	and  cannot
	     	be  divorced  from the  existing  weapons  and  equipment  of  our  armed  forces.    	We  can  only
	     	begin  with  the  present  reality  of  our  cauntry  and  our  army  on  the  foundation  presented
	     	by  existing  weapons  and  equipment,   	on  the  foundation  of  existing  material  and  technica~
	     	strength,   	and  on  existing  political  and  ideological  foundations,  developing  the  effects
   	_	   	of  these  foundations  to  the  greatest  extent  possible,   	if  we  are  to  make  solid  advances.
	     	If  we  do  not  see  this  and  if  we  ignore  the  existing  foundations,   	assuming  that  nothing
	     	can  be  done  on  the  basis  of  existing   	foundations,  but  instead  wait  passively  for,
	     	modernization,   	we  may  get  bogged  down  in  fantasies,   	and  that  dces  not  make  modernization
	     	a  reality.													     	~
			If  we  want  to  build  an  excellent  modern  revolutionary  army,  we  must  of  course  improve
			our  army's  weapons  anc7  equipment  as  rapidly  as  possible.    	~9eapons  and  equipment  are  a
			special  foundation  of  the  armed  forces  and  an  important  f~ctor  in  combat  strength.   	In
			building  a  modern  revolutionary  army  we  cannot  bt~t  place  high  emphasis  on  solving  the
			problem  of  weapons  and  equipment.    	The  Central  Committee  Military~Commission  is
			actively  improving  weapons  and  equipment,   	starting  out  from  this  viewpoint.    	It  must
			be  seen,  how~ver,   	that  modernization  of  the  armed  forces  is  not  simply  a  q~}estion  of
			weapons  and  equipment,   	but  must  include  making  various  kinds  bf  preparations  for
			handling  the  advanced  weapons  and  creating  appropriate  conditions.    	~hese  conditions
			include]  such  things  as  scientific  establishment  systems  and  organizational  management,
			crack  leading  bodies  and  guidance  organs,   	correct  military  thinking  and  combat  doctrine,
			a  high  degree  of  political  awareness,   	the  necessary  scientific  and  cultural  knowledge
			and  a  skilled  technical  level  in  tactics,   	an  excellent  organizational  discipline  and
			combat  style,   	staunch  and  powerful  party  leadership  and  political  work,   	restoration
			and  development  of  excellent  traditions,.  development  of  a  spirit  of  patriotism  and
			revolutionary  heroism,   	etc.    	Even  if  we  were  to  have  advanced  weapons  and  equipment,
			without  these  conditions,   	they  would  only  be  a  kind  of  possible  combat  strength,   	and
			could  not  constitute  real  combat  strength.    	Clearly,   	if  we  are  to  strengthen  these
			areas  and  improve  these  areas,  we  must  begin  with  the  existing  foundations.
			At  the  same  time,   	the  modernization  of  our  army's  weapons  and  equipment  cannot  be
		 	separated  from  the  reality  of  the  modernization  of  industry,   	agriculture,   	and  science
		 	and  technology.    	It  can  only  deve3.op  along  with  the  development  of  socialist  moderni-
		 	zation  and  be  realized  along  with  the  realization  of  socialist  modernization.    	The
		 	fact  is  that  in  modernizing  its  armed  forces,  no  country  in  the  world  can  discard

		    	existing  weapons  and  equipment  and  exchange  them  for  new,  but  can  only  renew  them  bit
		    	by  bit,   	renew  them  generation  by  ~eneration.    	This  is  a  process.    	To  separate   	it  from
		     	the  existing  foundations  and  to  hope  to  ascend  to  heaven  in  one  step,  completing
		    	everything  in  one  stroke,   	is  unrealistic.    	Therefore,   	we  cannot  discuss  modernization
		     	of  the  armed  forces   	in  isolation  from  the  development  of  the  national  economy  or   	the
		     	existing  foundations  of  weapons  and  equipment.    	Although  the  weapons  and  equipment
		     	of  our  armed  forces  are  somewhat  backward  compared  to  those  of  some  developed  countries,
		     	it  no  longer  amounts  to�a  ration  of  millet  and  a  rifle,   	as  during  the  war,   	and  we
		     	already  have  some  comparatively  modern,  even  comparatively  sophisticated,   	weapons  and
		     	equipment.    	If  we  base  our~elves  on  our  existing  equipment,really  ma~ter   	it,   	and
		     	continually  strengthen,   	improve,   	and  develop  it,  our  army's  combat  strength  will  cer-
		     	tainly  be  improved.    	Gradual  modernization  of  our  existing  foundation  is  not  impossible
		     	and  could  represent  a  great  accomplishment.    	Our  modernization  will  depend  on  solid
		     	work,   	not  waiting  for  higher-ups  to  issue  modernization.   	Nor  can  we  count  on  importing
		    	modernization  from  foreign  countries.    	Even  if  we  import  sane  advanced  weapons  and
		     	equipment,   	and  that  for  the  sake  of  improving  our  own  modernization  capabilities,   	we
		     	will  still  be  able  to  modernize  only  by  depending  on  our   	own  foundation  and  our  own
		     	self-reliance.    	It  should  be  seen  that  the  present  problems  are  that  we  have  not  com-
		     	pletely  mastered  our  present  weapons  and  equipment  and  that  the  present  military
		     	level  and  leadership  capability  of  the  troops  certainly  does  not  exceed  the  level  of
		     	existing  weapons  and  equipment.    	In  particular,   	there  are  large  numbers  of  problems
		     	that  we  must  study,   	reform,   	and  adjust  with  regard  to  the  establishment  of  cadre  corps
		     	and  leading  bodies  at  various  levels,  establishment  systems,  education  and  training,
		     	organizational  guidance,  management  capabilities,   	the  level:  of  scientific  and  cultural
		     	knowledge,  etc.    	If  these  problems  are  not  solved,   	not  only  will  we  be  unable  to  master
		     	more  advanced  weapons  and  equipment,   	but  we  will  not  even  be  able  to  skillfully  master
		     	existing  weapons  and  equipment  or  to  develop  their  potential  fully.    	Some  comrades  do
		     	not  really  recognize  the  function  of  the  existing   	foundation,  and  the  possibi`ity  of
		     	being  unrealistic  and  building  up  our   	strength  with  one  mouthful  is  a  kind  of  blindness
		     	which  must  be  overcome.
		     	We  advocate  basing  ourselves  on  the  existing  foundations  and  accelerating  the   	revo-
		     	lutionization  and  modernization  of  our  army,  at  the  same  time  determining  this  according
		     	to  our  army's  tasks  and  the  present  international  situation.    	Our  army  is  a  pillar
		     	of  the  dictatorship  of  the  proletariat  and  an  armed  force  for  the  protection  of
		     	socialist  modernization.    	Imperialism,   	especially  social  imperialism,   	still  exists  in
		     	the  world,   	and,   	as  before,   	there  is  danger  of  war.    	There  is  a  strong  quality  of
		     	suddenness  about  modern  warfare,   	but  although  we  cannot  wait  until  we  have  modernized
		     	before  preparing  for  war,   	neither  can  we  not  actively  pursue  modernization  just
		     	because  we  were  preparing   	for  war.    	The  fact  is  that  our   	army  has  historically  employed
		     	inferior  equipment  in  winning  over  enemies  that  had  superior  equipnent.    	This
		     	tradition  must  be   	further  develop~d  in  the   	future.    	Even  though  our  weapons  and
		     	equipment  have   	improved  considerably,   	we  still  must  be  prepared  to  win  with  inferior
		     	equipment  over  enemies  that  have  superior  equipment.    	We  must,   	under  the  guidance  of
		     	this  thought  of  winning  with   	inferior  equipment  aver  enemies  that  have  superior
		     	equipment,   	base  ourselves  on  our  existing  weapons  and  equipment  and  be  prepared  to
		     	fight  at  any  time.    	At  the  same  time,   	in  the  process  of  preparing  to  fight,  we  must
		     	accelerate  the    	revolutionization    	and  modernization  of  our   	army.    	Only  in  this  way
		     	can  we  put  our  army  in  an  invincible  position.    	Our  experience  in  the   	recent  self-
		     	defensive  counterattack  against  Vietnam  proved  that  in  order  to  be  able  to  fight  well
		     	and  win,   	we  need  only  develop  fully  the   	power  of  political  and  ideological  work,
		     	strengthen  education  in  patriotism  and   	revolutionary  her oism,   	conscientiously  carry

	    	of  experiece  in  education  and  trainxng  aver  the  past  few  years,  especially  emphasizing
	    	the  study  and  utilization  of  experience  in  the  self-defensive  oounterattack  fightiittg

	    	accelerating  the  advance  of  the   	revolutionization  and  modernization  of  our   	army  and
	     	improving  its  combat  strength.
	    	The  full  realization  of  the  spirit  of  the  three  meetings  of  the  Military  C~unission--
	     	basing  ourselves  on  our  existing  foundations,   	and  accelerating  the   	revolutionization
	     	and  modernization  of  our  army--also  requires  a  breadth  of  vision  vis-a-vis  the  whole
	     	situation,   	basing  ourselves  on  our  awn  tasks  and  coordinating  closely  with  the
	     	reality,  of  our  own  units.    	For  example:    	units  that  undertake  responsibility  for
	     	training  tasks  should  strive  to  improve  education  and  training;   	the  various  schools
	     	and  academies  should  strive  to  train  troop  personnel  to  be  both  Red  and  expert;   	units
  -	   	with.responsibility  for  national  defense   	scientific  research  and  war  production  should
	     	carry  out  their  scientific  research  and  war  production  well  and  at  all  costs  with  a
	     	plan,   	shorten  the  process  of  weapons   	and  equipment  modernization  at  key  points,   	and
	     	at  the  same  time  devote  attention  to  a  certain  amount of  training;   	units  undertaking
	     	construction,   	road  repair,   	and  production  tasks  should  speed  up  mechanization  and
	     	strive  to  raise  their  labor  production  rate;   	units  on  the  border  and  on  islands  in
	     	the  sea  should  take  up  theirwar  preparedness  duties  and  oomplete  their  garrison  tasks,
			at  all  times  being  vigilant  for  and  crushing  all  enemy  invasions,  disturbances,   	or
	     	destructive  activities;   	the  military  district  systems  in  each  province  must  carry  out
			the  "threP  fulfillments"   	of  militia  work,   	striving  to  raise  the  combat  strength  of  the
	     	militia,  etc.    	All  that  is  necessary  is  for  each  unit  and  each  persan  to  be  able  to
			start  from  this  whole  situation  of  acceleuating  the  modernization  of  the   	revolutionary
			armed  forces,   	coordinate  with  the  undertaking  4f  du~ies  and  concrete   	reality,  make  a
			creative  eff ort,   	and  do  their  own  jobs  in  a  dawn-to-earth  way,  whereupon  the  moderni-
			zation  of  our  army  can  develop  continuously  on  the  existing  foundations  and  can
			gradually  achieve   	realization.
			As  far  as  the  party  committees  at  various  levels  and  various  grades  of  leading  cadres
			are  concerned,   	building  a  modern  revolutionary  army  on  the  basis  of  existing  foundations
   	_	    	is  no  light  burden,   	but  a  heavy  one.    	Since  we  cannot  cast  aside  the  existing
			f oundations,   	if  we  are  content  with  things  as  they  are  ans7  hesitate  to  mave  forward,
			we  will  fall  into  a  state  of  inertia.    	These  two  tendencies  are  disadvantageous  for
		 	the  revolutionization  and  modernization  of  our   	army~  do  not  suit  the   	requirement  that
		 	our  army  be  prepared  to  fiqht,   	and  must  be  prevented  and  avercane.    	Under  the

  -	  	LArticle  by  Li  Yanming  ~621  1693   	24947:    	"Weapons  Development,  and  Changes  in  Cambat
	    	Methods"7				,
	    	[fiext7  There   	is  a  basic  viewpoint  to  Marxist  military  dialectics,  and  that  is  that
	    	weapons  development  determines  changes  in  combat  methods.    	This  viewpoint  tells  us
	     	that  armed  forces  must  forge  ahead  toward  modernization  and  not  only  must  develop
	    	military  science  and  technology  and  improve  weapons  and  equipment,  but  at  the  same		  	.
	     	time  must  develop  their  awn  military  academic  thinking   	relative  to  all  this,  and
	     	study  and  master  advanced  combat  methods.    	If  we  do  not  pay  attention  to  studying  the
	     	dialectical   	relationahip  between  the  two,  we  may  one-sidedly  advocate  and  passively
	     	await  improvements  in  weapons  and  equipment,  meanwhile  neglecting  to  study  and  probe
	     	into  advanced  combat  methods;   	this  may  lead  to  our  being  backward  and  valnerable  to
	     	attack  in  modern  combat.
	     	For  many  years  there  has  been  a  body  of  opinion  in  military  academic  research  that
	     	there  is  a  distinct  class  character  to  combat  methods;   	we  are  an  advanced  proletarian
	     	armed  force,   	anc7  therefore  our  combat  methods  are  naturally  the  most  advanced.    	We
	     	feel  that  this  view  denies  a  most  basic  fact,  which  is  that  the  internal  factor
	     	determining  changes  in  combat  methods  can  only  be  the  development  of  weapons  and
	     	equipment.    	All  other  factors,   	includinq  changes  in  the  cl~ss  status  of  the  soldiers
	     	and  the  will  of  talented  commanders,   	do  no  more  than  provide  external  conditiorts  to
	     	the  changes  in  combat  methods.    	It  shouln  be  said  that  in  military  science,  military
	     	theory  that  takes  the  phenanenon  of  combat  as  the  object  of  research--such  as  the
	     	origins  of  combat,   	the  nature  of  combat,  the  objectives  of  coanbat,  the  character  of
	     	combat,  etc.--despite  the  fact  that  these  aspects  have  an  intense  class  character,
	     	are  not  in  the  same  category  with  combat  methods,  and  we  cannot  because  of  this  draw
	     	the  inference  that  combat  methods  have  class  character.		     	'
	     	Soane  comrades  believe  that  combat  methods  are  created  by  men,   	that  they  represent  a
   	-	   	combination  of  inen  and  weapons,   	and  that  to  have  weapons  and  equipment  alone,  with  no
	     	men  to  use  them  in  battle,  would  make  the  weapons  and  equipment  something  that  could
			not  develop  any  function.    	According  to this viewpoint,   	it  seems  that  canbat  metha3s
	     	must  be  subject  to  a  certain  restriction  of  class  consciousness.    	In  fact,   	this  is  not
			the  case.    	We  recognize  that  the  origin  of  any  new  canbat  methods  must  always  be  pro-
			posed  by  man  and  must  be  employed  in  combat  by  men.    	The  point  is  that  man,   	inproposing
			a  certain  combat  metha3,   	is  certainly  not  acting  arbitrarily;  wishing  to  do  something
			and  then  doinq  it,   	but  sanething  that  adheres  to  a  certain  objective  law,  a  fruit  of

		     	the  development  of  subjective  activity.    	If  inen  subjectively  propose  combat  methods
		     	that  violate  the  objective  reality  of  weapons  and  equipment  development,   	they  will
		    	surely  run  into  a  stone  wall  in  combat  practice  and  ~the  methods7  will  have  to  be
		     	revised.    	Therefore  we  can  say  that  weapons  and  equipment  determine  combat  metha3s,
		    	and  the  fact  that  men  propos.~  and  employ  a  certain  combat  method  indfcates  the
		    	objectivity  of  the  laws  and  the  subjective  activity  of  man's  knowledge  of  the  laws,
		     	in  which  the  subjective  must  certainly  conform  to  the  objective  but  cannot  be  substi-
		     	tuted  for  the  objective.
  -		  	To  explain  this  point,  we  might  well  talk  about  haw  weapons  and  equipment  determine
		     	combat  methods.
		    	We  know  that  weapons  and  equipment  themselves  have  three  basic  key  elements,  which
		     	are  the  attack  force,  protective  force,   	and  mobility.    	These  three  essential  elements
		     	are  not  ordinarily  combined  in  one  article  of  weaponry  or  equipment,   	but  no  complete
		     	weapons  system  can  lack  these  three  elements.    	The  decisive  effect  of  weapons  and
		     	equipment  on  combat  methods  is,   	in  reality,  only  the  result  of  the  effect  on  combat
		     	methods  of  these  three  elements  separately  and  in  combination.    	Of  course,   	the
		     	decisive  effect  of  these  three  elements  on  combat  methods  is  certainly  not  divided
		     	into  primary  and  secondary,  but  all  take  equal  shares.    	Generally  speaking,   	in  the
		     	course  of  weapons  and  equipment  development,   	the  attack  force  is  the  core  of  change.
		     	In  the  history  of  human  combat,   	the  attack  force  of  weapons  and  equipment  has  gone
		     	through  three  class-character  developmental  changes:    	cold  weapons,   	shooting  firearms,
		     	and  guided  missile  nuclear  weapons.    	Combat  methods  in  the  history  of  human  combat
		     	have  also  had  qualitative  changes  that  accompany  this.    	During  the-Pe=iod  of  cold
		     	weapons,  what  was  employed  was  hand-to-hand  combat  with  naked  swords  by  concentrated
		     	square  units.    	"Naked  swords  cross,   	the  treasured  sword  breaks,   	two  armies  contend
		     	to  determine  life  and  death"  was  written  about  this  very  kind  of  combat  method.    	By
		     	the  time  of  the  period  of  firearms,   	the  basic  canbat  method  was  for  a  dispersed  band
		     	of  troops  to  advance  while  firing.    	The  period  of  guided  missile  nuclear  weapons  has
		     	just  started,   	and  judging  on  the  basis  of  the  circumstances  we  have  seen  up  to  now,
		     	its  combat  method  has  the  characteristics  of  highly  dispersed  troop  formations  and
		     	three-dimensional  operations.    	From  this  we  can  see  that  every  time  an  attack  force
		     	has  been  increased,   	it  has  made  the  old  combat  troop  formations  more  vulnerable  to
		     	casualties,   	forcing  people  to  change  and  even  abandon  the  old  troop  formations  and
		     	adopt  troop  formations  appropriate  to  the  new  attack  force.    	More over,   	these  changes
		     	in  combat  troop  formations  are  the  principal  sign  of  transformations  in  combat  methods.
		     	Protective  force  is  a  measure  taken  to  counteract  attack  force,  and  its  effect  on
		     	transformation  of  combat  methods  is  subordinate  to  that  of  the  attack  force.    	Although
		     	mobility  serves  the  attack  force,   	in  that  it  makes  it  possible  for   	the  attack  force  to
		     	reach  its  objective,   	its  development  follows  not  that  of  the  attack  force  but  the
		     	development  of  communications  implements.    	Therefore  it  has  a  certain  independent
		     	effect  on  the  development  of  combat  methods..    	Historically,  along  with  the  advance  in
		     	human  communications  implements,   	ther.e  have  appeared  one  after  the  other   	infantry

		     	and  the  weapons  and  equipment  of  the  two  opposinq  sides  and  their  method  of  employment
		     	determine  the  combat  methods.    	For  example,  during  the  firearms  period,   	the  basic
		     	combat  method  of  defenders  was  to  fire  from  behind  cover,   	killing  arld  wounding  the
		     	enemy  through  firepower.    	The  attackers,   	in  order  not  to  be  killed  or  wounded  by  the

	     	as  well  as  to  obtain  long-range  support  fire  and  increase the  speed  of  attack,   	one  side
	     	must  use  its  own  air  force,   	surface  artillery,  antiaircraft  artillery,   	air-defense

  -	   	combat  methods  a~e  transformed  into  a  coordinated  combat  method  by  the  various  service
			arms.
			There  is  one  more  point  that  must  be  clarified  here:    	combat  methods  always  advance
			with  the  development  of  productive  force  and  cannot  turn  counter  to  it;   	this  point
			is  dif�erent  from  tactics.    	So-called  tactics  are  really  the  actual  employment  of
			existing  combat  methods  by  commanders,   	and  they  include  encirclement,   	drive,feint,
			supplementary  attack,  containment,   	surprise  attack  and  ambush,  as  well  as  penetration
			and  separation,   	flanking  and  surrounding,   	holding  a  defense,  active  defense,   	feint
			to  the  east  and  attack  in  the  west,   	beseiging  the  enemy  to  strike  at  his  reinforcements,
			and  such  unlimited  permutations.    	Although  these  things  are  adaptable  and  changeable
		 	in  actual  use,   	the  tactical  concepts  are  stable  in  both  extension  and  connotation,
			and  these  same  tactics  have  been  used  in  ancient  and  modern  times,   	in  China  and  abroad.
			Moreover,  combat  metha3s  must  continually  replace the old  wuth  the  new  in  the  course
			of  historical  development,   	and  the  fundamental  factor  promoting  this  kind  of  super-
		 	session  is  the  development  of  weapons  and  equipment.    	When  old  combat  methods  are
		 	suddenly  inappropriate  to  new  weapons  and  equipment,   	they  must  be  replaced  by  new
		 	combat  methods.    	Everyone  knows  that  if  we  were  still  to  employ  in  modern  warfare  the
		 	concentrated-square  battle  formation  of  the  cold-weapon  perial,  we  would  suffer  a
		 	harsh  penalty  and  the  mockery  of  history.
		 	When  we  say  that  the  development  of  weapons  and  equipment  determine  the  changes  in
  ~	    	combat  methods,   	does  this  deny  the  human  factor?    	No.    	Acknowledgement  of  the  objective
		 	law  that  the  development  of  weapons  and  equipment  determines  changes  in  combat
		 	methods  is  not  the  same  as  saying  that  we  have  already  found  the  combat  method  most
		 	suitable  to  new  weapons  and  equipment.    	And  if  we  are  really  to  find  it,   	it  must
		  	still  be  through  man's  subjective  efforts.    	Although  combat  methods  themselves  have
		 	no  class  character,  class  consciousness  influences  people's  ability  to  recognize  new
		  	combat  methods.    	In  general,   	advartced  classes  represent the  new  productive  force,  are
		  	richest  in  revolutionary  creative  spirit,  can  most  easily  cast  off  outmoded  academic
		  	concepts,   	and,   	starting  from  reality,  will  consciously  probe  and  master  new  combat
		  	methods.    	The  backward  classes  thus  have  always  been  hampered  by  their  outworn  system,
		  	and  adhere   	rigidly  to  their  past  experience  and  conservative  academic  concepts.    	Even
		  	if  they  are  the  first  to  master  new  types  of  weapons  and  equipment,   	it  is  by  no  means
		  	certain  that  they  will  be  the  first  to  find  combat  methods  appropriate  to  these  new
		  	weapons  and  equipment.    	At  the  same  time,   	in  the  employment  of  new  combat  methods
		  	there  are  considerable  differences  in  the  way  they  give  play  to  the  effect  of
		  	subjective  activity.    	Even  though  foxhole  warfare  has  broken  the  boundaries  of
		  	"different  class  backgrounds  of  soldiers"  and  has  been  generally  adopted  by  the  armies
		  	of  all  nations,   	armed  forces  of  different  classes  get  vastly  different  results  within
		  	employing  foxhole  warfare  in  actual  combat.    	It  is  precisely  in  this  sense  that  we
		  	say  that  the  principal  determining  factor  between  victory  and  defeat  in  warfare  is
		  	men,  not  material.

		   	Since  changes   	in  combat  methods  are  determined  by  the  development  of  weapons  and

			 	through  a  large  amount  uf  Chinese  and  foreign  written  materials,  and  plunged  into
			 	the  design  work  round  the  clock,  carefullly  turning  over  in  their  mi.nds  everything
			 	from  the  selection  of  the  antennas  to  the  way  they  were  to  be  erected,  from  the
			 	layout  of  the  internal  equipment  to  the  method  of  connecting  the  machine  circuits,
			 	and  repeat'.edly  deliberated  on  these  matters.    	When  making  structural  calculations
			 	for  one  kind  of  antenna,  owing  to  the  fact  that  he  did  not  have  complete  ~2thods
			 	and  formulas  for  the  calculations,  Huang  Yongquan  painstakingly  searched  for  and
			 	conscientiously  probed  for  them.    	For  over  10  days  in  a  row,  he  worked  overtime
			 	deep  into  the  night,  comparing  over   	1,000  pieces  of  data  that  he  had  calculated.
			 	He  then  went  to  a  certain  design  in~titute  and  requested  instruction  from  the
			 	experts  and  technicians  in  this  f ield,  and  finally  got  the  proper  data.    	In  order
			 	to  select  a  new  kind  of  high-gain,  high-capacity  antenna,   	they  paid  visits  to  8
			 	concerned  units  in  4  provinces  and  municipalities.    	Hearing  that  a  communieations
			 	station  in  a  certain  municipality  in  northwest  China  was  using  a  new  kind  of
			 	antenna,  Huang  Yongquan  immediately  left  to  visit  the  center.    	Disregarding  the
  -		     	fatigue  of  a  long  train  ride,  he  walked  over  10  li  to  the  communications  center
			 	on  the  outskirts  of  the  municipality.    	After  getting  a  detailed  understanding  of
			 	this  kind  of  antenna,  he  asked  for  its  technical  specifications.    	In  order  to  make
			 	the  design  plan  suitable  for  the  geological  and  climatic  conditions  at  the  con-
			 	struction  site,   	they  went  to  the  site  and  questioned  the  local  meteorological
			 	station  and  experienced  peasants.    	When  they  found  out  that  the  site  was  in  an
			 	earthquake  zone  and  a  lightning  zone,  they  carefully  considered  measures  to provide
			 	protection  against  earthquakes  and  lightning,  and  made  new  demands  on  the  design
			 	from  a  technical  standpoint.
			 	During  the  planning  and  designing,   	they  paid  particular  attention  to  effecting
			  	savings.    	Under  the  premise  of  satisfying  the  demands  of  each  technieal  norm,   	they
			 	reduced  expenditures  as  much  as  possible.    	According  to  accepted  practice,  when
			 	antennas  for  a  communications  st~tion  are  erected  in  a  lightning  zone,   	several  big
			 	and  tall  lightning  pylons  must  be  built.    	Huang  Yongquar  and  his  comrades  made  a
			  	study  and  decided  to  make  some  of  the  antennas  in  the  form  of  pylons  as a~ubstitute
			  	for  pylons  which  have  the  special  purpose  of  deflecting  lightning,  and  as  much  as
			  	possible  to  use  connecting  rods  in  the  con~truction,   	so  that  for  every  two  antennas
			  	one  pylon  was  saved.    	In  designing  the  installation  of  the  wired  equipment,  Li
			  	Guixiang  thought  that  the  cost  of  manufacturing  the  high-frequency  electric  cables
			  	was  high,  and  more  often  than  not  more  money  would  be  spent  on  the  cables  than  on
			  	the  machines  and  equipment.    	Revising  the  blueprint  3  times,  he  mad~  the  installa-
			  	tion  of  the  machines  and  equipment  as  compact  as  possible  so  as  to  shorten  the

		 	bed  rushes  and  oil  lamps,   	they  made  themselves  at  home  in  their  new  quarters.
		 	From  then  on,   	they  began  intensive  work.    	Early  every  day  they  set  out  for  the
		 	mountains  to  do  their  job,   	their  instruments  strapped  to  their  backs  and  carrying
 _			on  shoulder  poles  their  f ield  rations  and  canteens.    	The  primeval  forest,   	in
		 	which  investigation  showed  no  trace  of  human  presence,  was  crisscrossed  with
		  	ravines  and  overgrown  with  brambles.    	At  times  they  used  machetes  to  cut  a  path
		  	through  the  undergrowth,   	and  at  times  they  ascended  pre~ipices  by  hauling  them-
		  	selves  up  on  vines.    	In  the  early  morning  their  bodies  were  covered  with  dew,  and
		  	by  noon  beads  of  sweat  covered  th~ir  faees.    	The  brambles  scratched  and  tore  their
		  	faces  and  necks,  but  no  one  complained.    	Every  day  when  night  had  fallen,  dis-
		  	regarding  the  fatigue  from  their  day's  trek,   	the  comrades  prostrated  themselves
		  	under  the  lamp  and  sorted  out  the  results  of  their  survey,  and  marked  them  one  by
		  	one  on  the  blueprint.    	On  the  over  100  li-long  route,  owing  to  the  fact  that  t?~ie
		  	terrain  was  extremely  complex,  on  average  every  li  of  the  road  had  several  tens  of
		  	design  stake  markers  and  bridges  or  culverts.    	Thinking  that  "it  is  better  to
		  	suffer  in  every  possible  way  than  to  ~ake  the  slightest  mistake,"  the  comrades  of
		  	the  investigation  team  conscientiously  and  seriously  planted  f irmly  and  acc~urately
		  	every  stake  marker.    	Sometimes,  in  order  to  determine  the  position  and  span  of  a
		  	culvert,   	they  followed  a  mountain  stream  all  the  way  to  its  source,  climbing  high
		  	and  precipitious  mountain  peaks  to  observe  the  terrain  and  running  water  line  and
		  	to  judge  the  direction  and  maximum  rate  of  flow.    	In  some  sectors  of  the  area,
		  	there  were  cliffs  above  and  deep  gullies  several  tens  of  zhang  below,  so  that  a
		   	fall  would  endanger  one's  life.    	Without  shrinking  back  in  the  slYghtest,   	they
		  	always  investigated  until  everything  was  clear  before  taking  a  break.    	One  overcast
		  	and  rainy  day,  when  the  comrades  were  back  in  their  quarters  sorting  out the results
		   	of  their  surveying,   	they  discovered  that  the  elevation  of  a  stake  marker  did  not
		   	tally  very  well  with  the  conditions  on  the  spot.    	Li  Jianzhang  immediately  took
		   	along  one  comrade  to  make  an  on-the-spot  reexam3.nation.    	On  a  muddy,  na.rrow,
		  	winding  trail,  the  two  men  walked  forward,   	slipping  and  stumbling,  and  not  caring
		   	in  the  slightest  about  the  danger  of  tumbling  into  deep  gorges.    	?~ith  great
		   	difficulty  they  crossed  a  mountain  and  found  a  river  in  front  of  them.    	The  swif t
		   	river  water  flowed  with  a  roaring  noise.    	The  two  men  resoluEely  went  down  into
		   	the  water  and,   	shif ting  their  staffs  from  hand  to  hand,  moved  forward  step  by
  -		 	step  and  with  great  diff iculty  crossed  the  river.    	On  coining  to  the  site  of  the
		   	stake  marker,   	they  braved  wind  and  rain,  set  up  their  instruments  and  took  measure-
		   	ments  until  t he  data  was  completely  accurate,  and  then  returned  to  their  base
		   	covered  with  mud~and  water.
		   	The  surveying  team  battled  for  3  whole  months  in  this  harsh  environment,  walking
		   	an  average  of  over  40  li  every  day.    	Through  this  survey  the  proper  alignment  of

			 	decided  to assiduously  tackle  this  key  problem  and  change  this  backward  feature.
			 	In  a  joint  designing  team  organized  by  the  units  concerned,  Zhao  Chang'an  had  the
			 	principle  task  of  designing  a  valve  with  two  kinds  of  specifications.    	He  went  to
			 	various  places  and  did  a  great  deal  of  investigation  and  research,  took  apart
			 	with  his  own  hands  the  foreign  pneumatic  ball  valv~s  of  the  1970's,  and  translated
			 	and  consulted  over  10  documents  on  the  subject.    	After  studying  and  analyzing  the
			 	problem  from  many  angles,  he  considerably  improved  the  original  ball  valve  in
			 	light  of  the  specific  demands  placed  on  the  fueling  system.    	In  a  3-month  period,
			 	he  was  so  absorbed  in  his  task  that  he  forgot  food  and  sleep,  working  intensely
			 	on  calculating  and  recalculating  all  the  parameters,  c~;3nging  his  blueprint  again
			 	and  again,  making  dozens  of  drafts,  making  comparisons,  a:~d  from  among  the  drafts
			 	sifting  and  choosing.    	Finally  he  completed  the  design  of  a  ball  valve  of  two
			 	diameters,  which  both  increased  the  valve's  sealing  properties  and  greatly  reduced
			 	its  weight,   	thereby  satisfying  the  units'  urgent  requirement.
			 	However,  Zhao  Chang'an  was  not  content  with  this  achievement.    	In  order  to  test  the
			 	newly  designed  ball  valve's  performance  and  to  further  perfect  his  design,  he  and
			  	technician  Huai  Huifang   	[2037  1920  5364]  went  to  the  designing  institute  many
 -				times.    	With  the  energetic  support  of  the  units  concerned,  they  performed  tests  and
			  	determined  the  ball  valve's  flow  twist  pattern  under  different  pressures,  flow
			  	rates,  and  pretensile  strengths.    	During  the  tests  he  and  the  technician  together
			  	studied  specific  plans,   	and  he  went  in  person  to  workshops  and  took  part  in  actual
			  	operations.    	With  the  workers  and  master  workers,  he  raised  valves,   	tightened
			  	nuts,  moved  tubing,  and  installed  instruments,  always  being  in  the  forefront.
			  	Once,  when  a  sealing  ring  was  receiving  low-temperature    	tempering  treatment,   	it
			  	needed  to  be  observed  continuously  for  24  hours.    	Although  extremely  busy,  he
			  	maintained  his  regular  shift  and  stayed  up  all  night.    	Early  on  the  second  day  he
			  	dragged  his  weary  body  to  a  valve  factory  to  observe  the  installation  of  ineasuring
 -				and  testing  instruments.    	After  completing  ovQr  1,000  mobile  experiments,  he
			  	plunged  with  total  absorbtion  into  the  couaprehensive  treatment  of  and  theoretical
			  	inqu,try  into  the  test  data.    	On  several  occasions  he  also  went  to Qinghua University,
			  	wher,e  he  requested  instruetion  frbm  its  mechanics  professors.    	He  then  further
			  	i~proved  his  design.
			  	Not  only  is  the  sealing  capacity  of  this  newly  developed  pneumatic  ball  valve  good,
			  	the  valve  is  also  easy  to  manufacture  and  low  in  cost.    	It  won  an  award  at  a
			  	scientif ic  and  technical  conference  held  by  the  armed  services.    	However,   	Zhao
			  	Chang'an  had  not  yet  "handed  in  his  examination  papers."    	When  he  saw  in  a  foreign
			  	document  a  more  advanced  sealing  ring,  it  immediately  drew  his  attention.    	But
			  	the  document  did  not  contain  specific  data  and  details  so  he  had  to  put  in  a
			  	great  deal  of  effort,   	after  which  he  quickly  drew  up  a  new  blueprint  and,  with  the
			  	help  of  master  workers  at  a  factory,  made  a  model  of  the  sealing  ring.    	Preliminary
			  	tests  have  proved  that  he  has  obtained  outstanding  results.

		 	ARTILLERYMEN  GUIDID  IN  STUDY  OF  SCIENTIFIC  TOPICS
		 	Beijing  JIEFANGJUN  BAO  in  Chinese  20  Jun  79  p  2
		  	[Article  by  special  staff  correspondent  Shi  Jinyu  [2457  6855  3768]:    	"Artillery
		  	Compar~y  Arranges  Content  of  Scientif ic  Studies  According  to  Its  Specialities"]
		  	[Text]    	An  artillery  company  of  Unit  84827  has  organically  integrated  its  study  of
		  	science  with  its  military  training,   	and  has  both  raised  its  level  of  scientific
		  	studies  and  promoted  its  military  training.
		  	In  combining  good  study  of  science  and  eulture  with  good  military  training,   	this
		  	company  paid  attention  to  two  points:    	(1)  Integrate  the  study  of  science  and
		  	culture  with  knowledge  about  weaponry.    	The  mortar  platoon,  while  studying  the
		  	structure  of  every  part  of  a  mortar,   	studied  the  pertinent  sections  of  a  middle-
		  	school  physics  course  in  order  to  clarify  these  questions:    	What  is  pressure?
		  	What  is  pressure  intensity?    	And  what  is  the  relationship  between  pressure  and
		  	pressure  intensity?    	From  this  the  platoon  understood  the  principles  of  firing  a
		  	mortar  and  the  dispersion  of  its  recoil.    	During  its  firing  and  training  in  the
		  	past,   	the  platoon  had  not  paid  suffieient  attention  to  the  role  of  the  mortar  s
		  	base  plate  and,   	therefore,  the  pit  into  which  the  base  plate  was  fitted  was  not
		   	firm,  which  frequently  affected  the  target  hit  rate.    	After  studying  pressure  and
		  	pressure  intensity,   	the  platoon  understood  the  principle:    	during  the  firing  of
		   	a  mortar,   	the  base  plate  not  only  absorbs  the  recoil  when  a  shell  is  fired  but
		   	also  distributes  the  recoil  uniformly,  so  that  the  area  receiving  the  recoil  is
		   	increased  and  the  pressure  intensity  is  lessen~d,  with  the  result  that  the  f iring
		   	angle  is  stable  and  the  target  hit  rate  ia  high.    	Thus,   	the  platoon  improved  its
		   	training  methods  and  requirements.    	In  combination  with  the  principle  of  the  82-mm
		   	recoilless  rifle,   	the  company  studied  the  law  of  Equilibrium  BetwPen  Two  Forces,
		   	which  states  that  if  the  thrust  and  counterthrust  of  two  forces  are  in  equilibrium
		   	then  the  pressure  point  equals  zero,   	further  clarifying  their  understanding  of  the
		   	structural  principles  and  combat  performance  of  the  82-mm  recoilless  rifle.    	(2)
		   	Focusing  on  diff icult  training  problems,  they  arrived  at  additional  solutions
		   	during  their  study  of  science.    	The  antiaircraft  machinegun  platoon  was  concerned
		   	about  the  fact  that  it  did.not  have  a  way  of  premeasuring  the  distance  to  a
		   	directly  aimed  target.    	Using  the  principle  of  triangulation,  the  instructors
		   	f irst  of  all  clearly  explained  the  relationship  between  the  line  of  fire  and  the
		   	line  of  sight,  and  then  made  a  concrete  analysis  of  the  structure  and  function  of
		    	the  sighting  device  as  well  as  of  the  differences  between  an  antiaircraft  machine-
		    	gun  and  a  rifle,   	thereby  clearing  up  misunderstandings,   	giving  the  soldiers  a  good

			 	idea  of   	their  weapon,  and  making  the  training  interesting  and  varied.    	In  firing
			 	live  ammunition  into  the  sky,   	three  squads  hit  their  target  balloons,  obtaining
			 	good  results.    	The  party  branch  of  this  company  has  attached  importance  to  the
			 	~pplication  of  scientific  knowledge  in  training,   	and  company  commander  He   	[6320]
			 	has  on  many  occasions  summed  up  and  disseminated  widely  the  experiences  of  model
			 	squads.    	In  the  first  quarter-year  military  examination,   	the  company  attained  the
			 	level  of  good  or  better  in  all  topics  of  all  specialities.
			 	The  equipment  of  this  company  is  comparatively  complex,   	and  it  has  five  different
			 	main  specialities.    	Owing  to  the  differences  in  each  speciality  and  each  one's
			 	emphasis,   	the  company  makes  different  demands  with  regard  to  scientif ic  education.
			 	Focusing  on  this  feature,   	the  party  branch  strengthened  its  leadership,  paid
			 	attention  to  separating  and  combining,  and,  according  to  the  special  �eatures  of
			 	the  specialities,   	formed  13  study  groups  and  separately  arranged  their  study
			 	content.    	The  reconnaissance  and  command  squad  stressed  the  study  of  trigonometric
			 	functions  and  geometry;   	the  vehicle  squad  stressed  the  study  of  the  part  of  physics
			 	dealing  with  mechanics;   	and  the  artillery  platoon  and  antiaircraft  machinegun
			 	platoon,   	taking  the  raising  of  their  speed  in  marking  and  refitting  as  the  basis,
			 	stressed  the  study  of  mathematics.    	The  company,  based  on  changes  in  training
			 	content,  has  also  continually  rearranged  and  read~usted  the  study  content.    	Every-
			 	body  has  become  aware  of  the  benefits  of  this  kind  of  study  for  the  promotion  of
			 	military  training  and  for  the  strengthening  of  its  purposefulness  and  results.
			  	Since  the  beginning  of  this  year,  the  company  has  taken  four  tests  on  scientific
			 	knowledge,   	scoring  an  average  of  80  or  higher.    	Political  instructor  Zhang   	[1728]
			  	scored  an  average  of  90  or  higher,  and  on  two  of  the  tests  he  scored  100.

		 	GOOD  COORDINATION  OF  TANK,  INFANTRY  UNITS  OUTLINED

		 	[Article  by  Wei  Li   	[1218  0500]   	in  "Combined  Arms  Forces  Commander--Organization"
		 	column:    	"Dialogue  on  Infantry  and  Tanks"]
				   	[Text]    	Editor's  note:    	Following  the  continua.l  application  of
				  	modern  science  and  technology  to  military  units  and  equipment,
				   	the  establishment  and  training  of  armed  forces,  as  well  as  their
				   	combat,  have  also  continually  been  transformed.    	This  is  the
				   	common  trend  in  the  armed  forces  of  various  countries.    	In  1975,
				   	Comrade  Deng  Xiaoping  said:    	"To  be  a  company  comm~ander  now  is
				   	different  from  being  a  company  commander  in  the  past.    	A  company
				   	commander  in  the  past  ~ust  had  to  brandish  his  Mauser  pistol  and
				   	yell   	'Charge!'    	Now  it  is  not  so  easy  and  it  is  not  the  same  as
				   	in  the  past.    	Many  more  demands  are  placed  on  a  company  co~nander's
				   	knowledge  than  there  were  in  the  paet.    	Once  war  breaks  out  and
		~			   	several  tanks  or  an  artillery  company  are  attached  to  your~company,
				   	how  will  you  command  them?"    	This  will  be  the  situation  for  a  company
				   	commander,  and  for  commandera  of  combined  arms  forces  at  all  levels.
				   	In  order  to help  the  combined  arms  forces  commanders  to  understand
				   	and  become  familiar  with  the  technical  and  tactical  characteristics
				   	of  the  various  service  arms  and  to  improve  their  skills  in  organ-
				   	ization  and  coordination  of  training  and  operations,  we  have
				   	started  this  special  colu~,   	to  which  we  ask  the  comrades  to  pay
				   	due  attention.
		  	Infantry  regimental  commander   	(shortened  to  "regimental  commander"  below):
		  	During  this  war  of  self-defensive  counterattack,  the  higher  level  attached  a

			 	Advisor:    	That  was  well  done.
			 	Regimental  commander:    	However,   	this  was  the  first  time  we  had  used  tanks  in
			 	combat  and  we  don't  have  much  experience  in  this  respect.    	Can  you  give  us  a
			 	little  briefing  today  on  the  use  of  tanks?
			 	Advisor:    	Good!    	We  can  study  together  and  learn  from  each  other.
			 	I  will  f irst  briefly  discuss    	the  development  of  the  tank.    	The  tank  is  a  weapon	 	~
			  	that  combines  the  functions  of  the  spear  and  the  shield,  and  it  f irst  appeared  in
  -				a  big  battle  of  World  War  I.    	When  people  saw  this  weapon  on  the  English-German
			 	battlefield  on  the  banks  of  the  Somme  River,   	they  thought  it  was  a  monster!    	During
			 	World  War  II,   	the  tank  became  the  principal  assault  weapon  in  the  armies,  and  the
			  	armored  tanks  developed  into  a  separate  service  arm.
			  	Our  country's  tank  force  was  developed  on  an  infantry  foundation.    	It  was  born  in
			  	the  beginning  stage  of  the  war  of  liberation  and,  under  the  loving  care  of  Chairman
			 	Mao  and  the  Party  Central  Committee,   	it  gradually  was  built  into  an  armored  force
			  	that  possessed  a  definite  scope  for  action.
			  	That  the  armored  force  was  able  to  develop  rapidly was because of  itscharacteristic
			  	of  combining fire  power,mobility,  and  armor  protection  and  because  it  has  strong
			  	assault  power.
			  	Regimental  commander:    	Through  the  war  of  defensive  counterattack  against  Vietnam,
			  	we  have  reached  a  further  understanding  of  the  position  and  role  of  the  tank.    	Such
			  	being  the  case,  does  it  have  some  weak  points?
			  	Advisor:    	That  is  a  good  question.    	Anything  whatsoever  is  sub~ect  to  the  principle
			  	of  "one  divides  into  two."    	The  weak  points  of  a  tank  are  that  it  presents  a  big
			  	target,   	its  movement  is  easily  restrieted  by  terrain,  and  its  material  and
			  	technological  requirements  are  complex.    	Modern  warfare,   	especially  on  a  battle-
			  	field  where  various  new  antitank  weapons  are  widely  used,  has  a  definite  effect  on
			  	the  battle  movements  of  our  tank  units.    	Only  by  gaining  a  clear  idea  of  its  weak
			  	points  and,  during  war,  making  a  point  of  overcoming  unfavorable  aspects  and
			  	unfavorable  factors  affecting  it,  can  we  better  display  its  power  in  battle.
			  	Regimental  commander:    	What  problems  should  we  give  attention  to  in  order  to
			  	correctly  use  tank  units?
			  	Advisor:    	Based  on  the  characteristics  of  modern  warfare,  I  think  we  should  stress
			   	three  c~uestions:    	we  must  master  the  principle  of  concentrated  employment  of  tank
			   	units   	(elements   	[fendui  0433  7130]),  devoting  much  attention  to  their  battle,
			   	logistics  and  technical  safeguards;   	(2)  we  must  correctly  employ  tanks  according
			   	to  the  mission,   	enemy  situation,   	terrain,  and  their  tactical  and  technical
			   	functions;   	and  (3)  we  must  organize  close  coordination  between  the  tank  units  and
			   	the  other  military   	(service)   	arms.    	These  are  the  most  fundamental  demands.
			   	Regimental  commander:    	Will  you  discuss  your  specific  view  on  each  question?
			   	Advisor:    	Very  well,   	I'll  take  the  first  question.    	Based  on  Maa  Zedong's  military

		  	employing  an  armored  force  is:    	concentrate  its  employment  in  the  main  direction.
		 	This  is  not  only  true  with  regard  to  a  campaign  but  also  with  regard  to  tactics.
		 	We  should  make  a  point  in  the  employment  of  tank  units   	(e~ements)   	attached  to  an
		  	infantry  division  or  regiment  not  to  move  them  in  too  many  directions  and  not  to
		 	break  them  up  into  too  many  scattered  smaller  units,  and  :it  is  also  unadvisabl~  td
		  	switch  their  subordination  frequently.
		 	Regimental  commander:    	Concentrated  employment  is  correct,  but  in  actual  warfare
		  	it  is  often  not  easy  to  effect.   	Because    	tanks  are  so  powerful,   	each  infantry
		  	regiment  and  battalion  hopes  to  obtain  their  support.
		 	Adivsor:    	Yes,   	this  is  precisely  the  problem.    	It  is  understandable  that  infantry
		  	elements  would  have  this  state  of  mind,  but  to  be  a  combined  forces  commander  one
		  	must  have  in  mind  and  correctly  get  a  grip  on  the  overall  situation.    	An  armored
		  	force  acts  as  an  important  assault  force;   	only  if  it  is  concentrated  in  the  main
		  	direction  and  at  important  moments,   	forming  a"fist,"  can  it  play  its  role  as
		  	"armored  cavalry."    	At  the  same  time,   	the  characteristics  of  the  technical  equipment
		  	of  tanks  also  do  not  allow  them  to  be  too  dispersed  in  mountainous  regions  or  in
		  	terrain  inconvenient  for  movement;   	if  they  are  too  dispersed,  many  difficulties
		  	that  will  not  be  easy  to  be  overcome  will  be  added  with  regard  to  communications
		  	and  engineering  and  to  logistics  and  technical  support.    	Speaking  of  logistics  and
		  	technical  support,   	the  historical  experiences  of  various  countries  in  employing
		  	armored  forces  in battle  and  the  practice  in  the  war  of  defensive  counterattack
		  	repeatedly  proved  that  whether  there  is  a  timely  supply  of  POL  and  ammunition  to
		  	tanks,  as  well  as  whether  rush-repairs  can  be  carried  out,  has  a  direct  bearing  o~
		  	a  tank  unit's  success  or  failure  in  battle.    	If  the  tank  unit  is  dispersed,  one
		  	tank	  	and  one  tank  there  and  tanks  acattered  in  all  quartiers,  this  will  cause
		  	many  difficulties  for  logistics  and  technical  support  which  will  not  be  easy  to
		  	overcome,  and  even  cause  the  tank  unit  to  lose  its  capability  to  sustain  combat.
		  	Regimental  commander:    	Some  of  our  basic-level  comnoanders  always  hope  to  have  a
		  	few  tanks  at  the  front  to  boost  morale  and  courage.    	This  kind  of  thinking often
		  	leads  to  their  improper  employment.
		  	Advisor:    	That  is  correct.    	Now  let  me  discusa  the  second  question.
  -			The  second  question  is  one  of  correctly  employing  tanks  according  to  their  mission,
		  	the  enemy's  situation,  and  the  terrain  and  according  to  their  tactical  and  technical
		  	functions.    	As  the  proverb  says,   	fit  the  appetite  to  the  dishes  and  the  dress  to
		  	the  figure,   	i.e.  adapt  oneself  to  circumgtances.    	Tanks  and  other  weapons  are  the
		  	same  in  that  they.all  have  their  own  special  functions.    	One  should  know  like  the
		  	palm  of  one's  hand  each  one's  general  specifications,  external  measurements,  weapon
		  	performance,   	traversing  capacity,   	speed  of  movement,  and  maximum  range.    	Different
		  	types  of  tanks  have  different  functions.    	This  means  that  if  one  gets  a  clear  idea
		  	of  them  separately  one  by  one,   	then  one  can  use  the  military  forces  in  3ust  the right
		  	way.    	For  example,   	some  comrades  only  know  that  a  tank  cannon's  directional  angle
		  	is  360  degree~s,  and  think  that  it  can  wipe  out  targets  in  any  direction.    	Actuall.y,
		  	this  is  not  so,  because  a  tank  cannon  is  affected  by  its  angle  of  pitch,   	it  has  a
		  	definite  blind  angle  of  fire,  which  is  even  greater  in  mountainous  regions,  where,
		  	if  you  want  tanks  to  wipe  out  enemy  f iring  points,  you  cannot  employ  them  as  you
		  	would  infantry  armed  with  satchel  charges.    	Also,  with  the  tank's  limited  travers-
		   	ing  capacity,   	if,  under  ordinary  conditions,   	this  capacity  is  exceeded  the  tank
		  	will  overturn,   	fall  into  a  ditch,  or  get  stuck  in  mud.    	Only  under  the  premise

			 	of  respecting  objective  reality  and  objective  laws  and  of  giving  full  play  to
			 	man's  subjective  activity  can  we  better  display  the  power  of  the  weapons  we  have.
			 	To  employ  the  weapons  we  have  beyond  their  ability  to  perform  will  often  lead  to
			 	many  unnecessary  losses.
			 	Regimental  commander:    	Right.    	We  have  experiences  and  lessons  with  regard  to  thia
			  	question.
			  	Advisor:    	The  third  question  to  which  we  must  pay  attention  is  the  organizing  of
			  	good  coordination.    	Of  course,   	the  two  previous  questions  are  also  related  to
			  	coordination,   	or  we  can  say  that  they  are  the  premises  for  effecting  good
			  	coordination.
			  	Once  we  understand  the  tank's  function  we  can  see  that  only  if  the  armored  forces
			  	closely  coordinate  with  infantrymen,   	artillerymen,   	engineers,  and  airmen  can  they
			  	display  their  strong  points,  make  up  for  their  weak  points,   	and  fully  develop
			  	their  power  in  battle.    	I  think  the  most  fundamental  thing  for  a  combined  arms
			  	force  commander  is  to  establish  the  idea  of  a  combined  arms  force  and  get  rid  of
			  	the  concept  of  a  single  service  arm.    	If  one  doesn't  think  in  terms  of  a  combined
			  	arms  force,   	one's  organizational  command  will  only  extend  to  one  service  arm.
			  	Certainly,  a  tank  unit  must  by  its  very  nature  understand  other  military   	(service)
			  	arms.    	The  concept  of  coordinated  operations  must  be  firmly  established  in  combined
			  	operations.					     	~
			  	Regimental  commander:    	In  that  case,  when  employing  tank  units,  what  things  should
			  	be  paid  attention  to  in  organizing  coordination?
			  	Advisor:    	First  of  all,   	the  tank  units   	(elements)  must  certainly  be  given  explicit
			  	opportune  moments,   	directions,  and  missions  for  employment.    	Under  the  premise  of	   	~
			  	understanding  the  overall  plan  of  the  campaign  or  battle,   	each  service  arm  taking
			   	part  in  the  campaign  or  battle  must  really  be  clear  about  the  methods  and  liaison
			   	signals  for  the  mission  command  relationship  and  mutual  support.    	Only  when  time
			   	and  conditions  permit  should  tank  units  survey  the  terrain  and  engage  in  explicit
			   	coordination.    	Moreover,  when  organizing  infantry-tank  coordination,   	the  commander
			   	of  a  comLined  arms  forcA  m~~G*  R~.ncerely  heed  the  rational  suggestions  of  the
			   	armored  force  and,  making  up  for  his  unfamiliarity  with  the  situation  of  the  ~ank
			   	units   	(elements)   	and  the  tenseness  of  the  situation  on  the  battlef ield,   	consider
			   	the  drawbacks  in  the  coordination  plan  that  he  had  not  thought  about.
			   	At  the  same  time,   	the  principle  of  mobility  and  flexibility  should  be  carried  out
			   	in  coordinated  command,  concentrating  the  tank  units  so  that  they  act  as  the  van-
			   	guard  of  the  infantry  army   	(division).    	When  the  tanks  penetrate  deeply  into  the
			   	enemy  position,   	the  infantry,  artillerymen,   	and  engineers  following  the  tanks.are
			   	to  come  under  the  unified  organizational  coordination  and  effective  command  of  the
			    	tank   	commander.    	In  this  situation,   	it  is  necessary  to  have  a  powerful  movement
			   	support  unit,   	composed  mainly  of  engineers,   	to  move  in  front  of   	the  tanks  and
			   	insure  their  smooth  advance.    	In  a  certain  sense,   	the  condition  of  the  route  of
			   	advance  is  more  important  than  the  enemy's  situation,   	and  a  combined  arms  force
			    	commander  st~ould  pay  full  attention   	to  this  point  when  organizing  coordination.
			   	Regimental  commander:    	I  thank  the  veteran  commander  for  giving  me  today  this			'
			   	vivid  and  profound  lesson.
