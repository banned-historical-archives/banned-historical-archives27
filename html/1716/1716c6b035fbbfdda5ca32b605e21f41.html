Japan - U. S. Economic Council  
This is a blue ribbon list of Japanese business leaders, but few of 
them will have an adequate command of English. Essentially con-
servative in political outlook (they fund the LDP), they will be as 
worried and concerned about the state of U.S. -Japan relations and 
about their future role in the world as any of the politicians. They 
are generally fairly close-mouthed about what transpires at their 
meetings. However, Mr. Iwasa shows signs of wanting to use his 
chairmanship of the Japan-U.S. Economic Council as a means of 
gaining ascendancy over Mr. Uernura, President of Keiclanren (the 
Federation of Economic Organizations, which is roughly the equiva-
lent of our National Association of Manufacturers), and others to be-
come the leading international spokesman for Japanese business. As 
your host, he will doubtless seek as much publicity from this meeting 
as he can. The expanding overseas operations of Japanese trade and 
industry is forcing business leaders such as those represented in this 
group to take an active interest in foreign policy in its political and 
security aspects as well as its international economics. This group 
will therefore probably prefer to hear you discuss political and 
security matters, and will not expect you to reflect an intimate know-
ledge of world economic problems. You may be as frank with this 
group on the great international issues as you are with any of the 
leaders but Sato and Fukuda. 
Suggested Talking Points  
-- Outline your views on the emerging multipolar system in Asia, 
and what this means for the prospect for peace and stability in 
the region. 
Describe in what ways Japan might related to this changing 
international context. 
Reassure the group that the U.S. continues to attach the 
highest value to its alliance with Japan, intends to stand by

its defense commitment to Japan, and sees no contradiction 
between these intentions and the U.S. effort to improve 
relations with the PRC. 
Explain that the U.S. interest in adjusting our basic relationship 
toward greater equality, inter-dependence, and reciprocity is 
aimed at making our alliance more sustainable over the long 
term, and is in no way a subterfuge for pressing Japan to 
stand alone on its own. 
Reassure the group that the U. S. intends to continue to play 
a vital balancing role in Asia, and will maintain the mix of 
ground, naval, and air forces in the area necessary to make 
that role effective. 
? Express awareness of Japan's past efforts to liberalize its 
trading practices. Emphasize, however, the seriousness with 
which the U.S. views its continuing trade deficit -- especially 
that with Japan -- and encourage the Japanese business leaders 
to generate greater levels of imports from the U. S. through 
both governmental and private efforts. 
Refer to the upcoming (June 15-17) meeting between Mr. asa's 
Economic Council and its U.S. counterpart, the Advisory

Council on Japan - U. S. Economic Relations (headed by Jeeb 
Halaby), and ul?ge the Japanese to listen carefully to what the 
U. S. business leaders say. 
-- Express an interest in the timing of the recovery of Japan 
from its business slowdown, and suggest that the measures 
taken to expand the Japanese economy be calculated in such 
a way as to generate a greater demand for U. S. goods. 
? Urge Japan to take concrete steps to implement the seven-
point program announced on May 20, and insist that Japan 
must take the steps necessary to remove its restrictions on 
foreign trade and investment and to moderate the continued 
rapid rise in its exports.

HAK STATEMENT BEFORE JAPAN-US ECONOMIC COUNCIL 
A Changed World  
? It is a great privilege to be here in Japan. I appreciate the 
opportunity to come that JUSEC has provided, and the chance to meet 
your Board of Directors. The Japanese members of this organization 
have made a major contribution to this country's astonishing economic 
growth in recent years. 
-- I was last in Japan in 1963, and the changes which have taken 
place since then must be seen to be believed. 
-- These changes in Japan illustrate a point I would like to make: 
the world itself has changed greatly from what it was a generation ago. 
-- Japan and Western Europe have recovered fully from World War II 
and have gone on to new economic heights. Among the countries of 
Western Europe a new degree of political accord has also been achieved. 
-- Dozens of new countries have gained independence and dignity 
and are making their mark upon the world stage. 
The so-called "socialist camp" has fragmented. The time has 
long past when we can think of it as a monolithic bloc. 
? The military equations in the world have altered. All-out war is 
unthinkable and meaningful arms control measures now serve to enhance 
national security. 
-- The relationships among the great powers have become much more 
fluid, and the cold war to some extent less intense. Instead of a situation

2 
of confrontation between two powers or blocs, there are now multipolar 
centers of power and influence. 
-- U. S. foreign policy under the Nixon Administration has changed 
to reflect this changed world. And we attach no higher priority to any 
task than that of reshaping and strengthening our traditional bonds with 
Japan. 
? We see Japan in the process of defining its own role in this multi-
polar world, and its relationship to each of its elements. It has a crucial 
economic and political role to play in this multipolar world. It is only 
natural that you carefully scrutinize the policies which you have followed 
in the past to see if these still are valid in terms of Japanese national 
interest. 
-- One central element that I am confident that both of us recognize 
must endure is the strong US-Japan partnership. 
US Approach to Japan in a Multipolar World  
-- This leads us to U. S. foreign policy in recent months. I know 
that many Japanese are wondering about moves which we have made --
the President's visits to Peking and Moscow, the implementation of the 
Nixon Doctrine, Vietnamization, the SALT Agreement, the New Economic 
Policy, and others. We are not insensitive to the fact that in Japan there 
has indeed been something called the "Nixon shoku."

-- You are asking: Where does Japan stand in all this? Is the 
U. S. turning away from its alliance with Japan? Or is the U. S. 
trying to push Japan into doing things or shouldering responsibilities 
of a regional or global nature which the U. S. now wants to avoid? 
Does the U. S. attach more value to reaching agreements with Moscow 
and Peking than to maintaining its close and friendly ties with Japan? 
Does Japan really count in U. S. calculations? Is the U. S. in effect 
getting out of Asia? Should Japan in return strike off in new directions 
of its own? 
? As a general response to these questions, I want to state flatly 
that the U. S. places the highest premium on its relationship with Japan. 
In President Nixon's Foreign Policy Report of February 9, 1972, he 
said: 
. "Japan is our most important ally in Asia. It is our second 
greatest trading partner. It is an essential participant, if a stable 
world peace is to be built. Our security, our prosperity, and our 
global policies are therefore intimately and inextricably linked to 
the U.S. -Japanese relationship. The well-being of both countries 
requires cooperation and a shared commitment to the same 
fundamental goals."

-- In this connection the U. S. highly values the Mutual Security 
Treaty between our two nations. 
? The President, his Administration and the American people 
strongly believe in these factors. 
To put the whole question of Japanese-U.S. relations into better 
perspective, let me talk about the kinds of basic relationships which 
we find it necessary, or desirable, to maintain in the world today. 
. First, those derived from a close mutuality of interest, 
or upon similarities in philosophy or outlook. In this category I 
would place U. S. relations with Japan, with our neighbors in 
North and South America, with the NATO countries, and with 
other countries to which we are tied by bilateral or multilateral 
treaties. With such nations the central theme of our relationship 
is interdependence.  
. Second, those with countries having profoundly different 
political and social systems from our own, but with which we must 
deal realistically if our goal of building a peaceful world order is 
to be achieved. In this category are such countries as the Soviet 
Union and the People's Republic of China. Although we have had 
serious disputes with such nations, the demands of peace obligate 
us to find areas where our interests overlap and where relaxation 
of tensions may be achieved. We hope for increasing cooperation 
with these countries but with them we are at the beginning of a process.

5 
. Third, countries with whom we have a more peripheral 
relationship, but where we also wish to maintain friendly relations. 
The point to be stressed concerning Japanese-U.S. relations 
is that in seeking out areas of agreement with the countries in the second 
category, we will not sacrifice our close bonds with countries in the first 
category. It would be fatuous to think that we could make the PRC or the 
USSR more amenable by turning away from our friends and allies, even 
if we wanted to -- which we don't. We can better advance the cause of 
peace in our dealings with potential adversaries when they see that we 
are reliable partners and we respect our friends. 
-- We believe it is in the national interests of the U. S. and Japan 
for our two countries to remain close friends. We also believe it is 
in the national interests of the U. S., as well as of Japan, for the U. S. 
to seek a relaxation of tensions with the PRC and the USSR and move 
on to increased cooperation, if possible. There is no clash of interests 
here.

Japanese Questions 
? Having said this, let me return to the more specific questions 
which have arisen in the minds of the Japanese people about the 
constancy and reliability of the U.S. in its dealings with Japan. 
? I believe the most useful discussions that I can have with you and 
the other leaders of Japan this week is on the future of U.S. - 
Japanese relations rather than dwelling on past events. This, 
I hope, will be the focus of my talks here -- how our two countries 
see the international scene and Asia in particular; how we see the 
Japanese and American roles in this context; and what we think 
the shape of the US-Japan partnership should be. 
? Nevertheless, we must candidly recognize that in the fast changing 
international patterns of recent months, some misunderstandings 
have developed in our bilateral relations. I believe the fact that 
such ripples have occurred should not greatly surprise us at a time 
when the world has changed so much and the places of your country 
and mine have changed in that world. But let us first deal briefly 
with some of the problems that I know many Japanese have raised 
head-on so that we can then move to a more constructive discussion 
of future vistas. 
-- Rather than go over a long check-list of what I understand are 
Japanese grievances, I would like to address three major areas 
of concern: 
No Objection to Declassification in Part 2010/08/16: LOC-HAK-167-6-1-9 
No Objection to Declassification in Part 2010/08/16: LOC-HAK-167-6-1-9 
? The "Nixon shock" (or "shoku"), that is, the abrupt way that two 
major policy decisions were announced by the U.S. with very 
little advance notice to Japan. 
? We regretted the necessity of acting the way we did, but in 
both instances we believed that the sensitive nature of these 
moves made it impossible to provide prior consultations to any  
of our friends and allies. 
' These were special cases and clearly not part of a pattern. 
-- The related concept that political and economic considerations in  
Japan are simply not given much weight in U.S. policy determinations.  
? Admittedly, there have been political and economic repercussions 
in Japan over moves such as the President's China initiative, 
the NEP, the textile issue, and the Chirep vote in the UN last fall. 
I've already talked about the President's July 15 and August 15 
as 
announcements /special cases. Since then we have consulted 
closely on both China policy and economic issues. On the NEP, 
we are working closely with Japan on world monetary reform 
and trade liberalization. There are still differences in our points 
of view, but these hopefully can be handled with good intentions 
and mutual respect for each other's interests. 
? On the textiles issue, let's hope that it remains a closed book. 
There were problems in it for us, too. With respect to the UN

issue, we had no reason to believe that our approach wouldn't 
work. We thought it was fair and realistic. And I was assured 
by the experts before my Peking trip last year that the vote 
would not possibly take place before well after my departure 
from Peking. 
In any event, as the San Clemente meetings last January on Okinawan 
reversion showed, we are certainly taking Japanese internal 
considerations very heavily into our calculations. We are main-
taining the closest consultations with Japanese leaders both here 
and in Washington. 
? Ambassador Ingersoll has the full confidence of President Nixon 
and this is one of his primary tasks. It is also one of the major 
purposes of my trip here. 
? The thought that the U.S. is pulling out of Asia and in some way is 
attempting to get Japan to replace us in a balance of power role. 
? The U.S. is emphatically not pulling out of Asia. We intend to 
stay on and to fulfill our commitments, and will maintain the 
military forces required to do so. 
? We are not trying to push Japan into anything. We believe that 
what the Japanese do will be in terms of their own judgment of 
their national interests. 
? We are not seeking, either, to see a. perpetuation of the classic 
19th century balance of power situation. What we hope will

9-? 
eventually emerge is a world order without blocs and with 
countries treating one another as equals. 
Agenda for the Future 
-- I hope that we can make some headway on such concerns in our 
discussions. But in all candor, explanations and reassurances 
and promises of consultation by both sides -- though important 
will not suffice to place our partnership on a sound footing. Only 
a constructive discussion of where we go from here and then the 
process of joint action will serve to maintain and enrich our 
traditional close ties. 
-- There are many pressing international problems that the U.S. and 
Japan -- and in most cases Europe -- not only can talk about, but 
must talk about. It is not so much that they offer opportunities for 
cooperative action as they demand it. We must begin to talk 
creatively and act more in harmony about an imposing agenda 
of issues: 
? Trade: How do we work out new relationships so that the 
commercial exchanges between our countries, and those of 
Western Europe, enrich our political cooperation, rather than 
jeopardize it? 
? International Monetary Reform:  How do we and the Europeans 
shape a new global system that reflects new monetary realities?.

? Economic Assistance: What should be the role and the share 
of economic assistance by various developed countries to 
developing ones? 
? The Environment: How do we share our knowledge so that we 
can help each other clean up our environment and together help 
to cleanse the world's? 
? Energy: How are we going to fill the growing needs for energy 
to fuel our societies? 
? Technological Cooperation: The advanced nations have a great 
deal to share in the fields of science and technology, whether 
it be in addressing problems here on earth or seeking new 
horizons in outer space. 
-- These and other challenges constitute a constructive agenda for our 
'two countries. They point to an enduring relationship that Prime 
Minister Sato and President Nixon referred to last January in San 
Clemente. As they put it, over a hundred years of association 
between our two countries must be continued on the foundation of 
mutual trust and interdependence. 
-- I have only touched the tip of the;iceberg. But let me stop now and 
take your questions and comments. For I have come to Japan more 
to listen than to explain.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Korneito Party Chairman Takeiri  
and 
Democratic Socialist Party Chairman Kasuga  
You may encounter these two opposition party leaders at the reception on 
June 10. You have met both within the past half year: Kasuga when he called 
on you December 3, and Takeiri when he met with you March 15. 
The Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), which was formed in 1960 when its 
members split from the Socialist Party on the issue of political extremism 
and which now has 32 members in the 486-member Lower House of the Diet, 
is the only opposition party that supports the U.S.-Japan alliance. Kasuga, 
who took the DSP over last fall, is regarded as a controversial head of a 
party split between those like himself who feel the DSP should work for unity 
with the other opposition parties even if it means sacrificing the traditionally 
more moderate stance, and the party's moderate wing. 
? The Komeito Party, Japan's third largest, is the political arm of the 
militant Buddhist sect Soka Gakkai. It is based primarily on the urban 
displaced, and, while it grew rapidly during its earlier stages of organiza-
tion, has shown little additional expansion in recent years. Takeiri is a 
clever leader, but his Party is, despite its disavowals, closely bound and 
subordinate to the Soka Gakkai. 
Both Kasuga and Takeiri have travelled to Peking since you saw them last, 
and Takeiri in addition is just now returning from a visit to Pyongyang, 
where he met with Kim Il- song. 
Suggested Talking Points  
-- You might invite both Kasuga and Takeirirs observations on their 
recent visits to the PRC. 
-- You might ask Takeiri for his comments on the political atmosphere 
in Pyongyang, and what impression he gained as to North Korea's 
current foreign policy direction.

Prime Minister Eisaku Sato  
Sato is not altogether predictable as a conversationalist. Usually 
forthcoming, he can at times prove taciturn. He will probably seek 
to maintain your conversation on a fairly elevated plane, avoiding 
details on any specific subject. We understand he has asked to see 
you alone. This does not mean he will automatically regard all 
aspects of your conversation as secret. On the contrary, he will 
feel that something newsworthy must come of it, and he will at a 
minimum feel he must share the substance of your talk with his 
principal associates. Therefore, you should reach an agreement 
before the meeting ends on what is privileged, what may be discussed 
with colleagues on a confidential basis, and what will be said to the 
press. 
1. China. Sato's principal substantive interest will focus primarily 
on China policy, how we envisage the development of our relationship 
with Peking, what our intentions are toward Taiwan, and what trans-
pired during the President's visit to Peking. He will want to obtain a 
feeling for what it is like to deal directly with Chou En-lai and Mao Tse-
tung and for the general atmospherics of Peking. He will be particular-
ly concerned to hear from you whether the conversations in Peking in-
cluded any mention of matters of great concern to Japan, such as the 
Senkakus problem, the U.S. - Japan security relationship, Chinese fears 
of Japanese militarism, and Chinese attitudes toward dealing with the 
Japanese government. 
-- Express regret (this word is important -- it implies no blame, 
but rather an understanding of their problem) that our need for 
secrecy did not permit us to consult with the Japanese before the 
July 15 announcement, and our understanding of the political 
problems the China issue has caused Sato and his supporters. 
-- Assure Sato that our China initiative is not an attempt to play 
Japan and China off against each other in balance of power

politics, and that we are in no way trading our alliance with 
Japan off against a hope for a limited improvement in rela-
tions with China. 
-- Assure him we wish to avoid conflict in our approaches to 
Peking and intend to consult closely on future steps and 
developments. 
-- Assure him that no deals were reached on the Senkakus, off-
shore oil, security issues, or any other subject of concern to 
Japan, and that we will not take any actions to undercut Japan' s 
vital interests. 
-- Explain the Shanghai Communique, especially the sections on 
Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. 
-- Describe the atmospherics of Peking, and emphasize the need 
for firmness in dealing with PRC leaders. (We suspect that 
Sato's repeated entreaties to Peking for direct official contacts, 
while perhaps useful to him in Japanese domestic politics, have 
increased PRC leverage on him.) 
-- Draw him out on the status of Japan's efforts to establish contacts 
with Peking, the results of Mikits recent visit there, and Japan's 
intentions.

? Indicate that while you recognize the importance of China 
policy to Japan, particularly at this point, and while we fully 
intend to consult closely on this question, you believe that we 
must not allow China to obscure other important aspects of 
our relations. 
2. Soviet Affairs. Sato will be particularly interested in a final 
run-down of the Moscow trip. 
-- Brief him to the fullest extent possible on the President's Moscow 
trip and on the agreements reached there. 
? Give him your assessment of Moscow's intentions regarding 
regional security arrangements, in both Europe and Asia. 
-- Give Sato your assessment of Sino-Soviet relations. 
-- Draw him out on his own estimate of the prospects for negotia-
tions for a Peace Treaty with the Soviets this fall, for settle-
ment of the Northern Territories issue, and for conclusion of a 
loan agreement to finance the pipeline from the Tyumen oil field 
to the Pacific Coast. If asked, tell Sato the U.S. Government 
has put no obstacles in the path of private American participation 
in the Tyumen oil project and some U.S. oil companies and con-
struction firms are in contact with their Japanese counterparts.

3. Korea. Given Japan's security and economic stake in the Korean 
Peninsula, Sato will be interested, first, in the U.S. 's continued avowal 
of its defense commitment to and intention to maintain a troop presence 
in South Korea; second, in our assessment of the tentative moves by 
Seoul and Pyongyang toward some modus vivendi on the Peninsula; 
third, in how we plan to approach the Korean question in next fall's 
U. N. General Assembly; and, fourth, in our views on Japan's increasing 
contacts with North Korea and our plans for any possible contacts with 
the North. 
-- We will stand behind our defense commitment to the ROK, and 
do not intend to reduce our forces there further in the foreseeable 
future. 
-- We will support the efforts of the ROK to seek a relaxation of 
tensions and increased communication on the Korean Peninsula. 
-- We welcome the direct discussion between North and South Korea 
as what we hope will be the beginning of a long-term process of 
relaxation of tensions between the two. 
-- We believe it is too early to conclude that Pyongyang has firmly 
committed itself to long-term peaceful accommodation with 
Seoul, and it is necessary to know to what extent Peking and 
Moscow can and will restrain Pyongyang. Therefore, we should 
move cautiously. 
-- We should also avoid those moves that could seriously under-
mine political cohesion in South Korea, or could help Pyongyang

drive wedges between South Korea, Japan and the 
U.S. 
? We are presently exploring strategy and tactics on the Korean 
question in next fall's U.N. General Assembly, and are co-
ordinating with ROK, Japan and others. Postponement of the 
question this year as last would have the advantage of not under-
cutting the Seoul-Pyongyang talks and injecting another irritant 
into our relations with Peking and Moscow. But we must also 
consider fallback positions. 
4. Vietnam and the U.S. - Japan Security Treaty. The use of U.S. 
bases in Japan to repair and supply materiel intended for the GVN 
forces, and the recent dispatch of a Marine air wing from Iwakuni to 
Vietnam has given the political opposition in Japan an opportunity to 
attempt to embarrass the government for its support of our Vietnam 
effort, focussing particularly on the "prior consultation" provisions of 
our Security Treaty with Japan. 
-- Express appreciation for the understanding and support of his 
government for our efforts in Vietnam over the years, and 
particularly following the President's May 8 speech. 
? Express gratitude for the Japanese Government's cooperation 
in the use of bases in Japan in indirect support of our operations 
in Vietnam during the current North Vietnamese offensive. (This 
should be expressed privately to Sato and Fukucla only.)

SECRET 6 
If Sato raises the question of prior consultation on U.S. use 
of bases in Japan, you should assure him that the U.S. will 
not take any action regarding the Vietnam conflict that would 
require prior consultation, and that we will continue to inform 
his government in advance of any significant movements that 
might affect U.S. units in Japan. If asked about reviewing 
prior consultation arrangements, you should say that we should 
think carefully before making substantial changes in a system 
that has worked so well for so long. 
-- Give him your estimate of the military and political situation 
in the South and the ability of the North Vietnamese to maintain 
the level of their offensive, and explain the necessity for the 
moves which the President announced on May 8 against North 
Vietnam. 
-- Give him your estimate of the roles played by the Soviets 
and Chinese in this action. 
5. The Multipolar World. If there are Japanese who envisage a major 
and much more independent role for Japan in a world dominated by four 
or five more or less separate power centers, Sato is not among them. 
He professes publicly to be puzzled about what role Japan might play, 
or what role the U.S. might expect Japan to play, and he and most 
Japanese still have the feeling that Japan's future would best be assured 
by continuing a close association with the United States in which Japan 
would enjoy most of the forms of equality and a fair degree of flexibility 
but in which it would in fact remain clearly the junior partner.

Describe in general terms how you see the multipolar world 
emerging over the next decade, stressing Asia. What we 
hope to see is a relationship of equals, and not the perpetua-
tion of traditional balance of power concepts. 
-- Reassure Sato that the U.S. fully intends to play an effective 
role as a power in Asia and the Pacific over the long term, 
and that we will maintain the mix of ground, naval, and air 
force necessary to do this. 
? Use this as an opportunity to assure Sato of the importance 
we place on maintaining our close ties with Japan, and that 
we will not sacrifice our essential relationship with Japan 
for other goals. 
-- Explain that the U. S. interest in adjusting the basic relation-
ship with Japan toward greater equality, inter-dependence, 
and reciprocity is aimed at putting our alliance on a more 
sustainable basis over the long term. 
6. NPT. Japan, having signed but not ratified the NPT, is reportedly 
waiting for EURA.TOM to conclude a safeguards agreement with the IAEA, 
after which Japan will seek an agreement of its own under which the 
safeguards requirements will be no more burdensome on Japanese than 
on European industry. There have, however, been a disturbing number

has lost interest in the NPT and is indifferent to whether Japan 
signs or not. 
-- Express the views of the Administration on the NPT: we 
signed it; we favor it; we favor other countries accepting it; 
but we believe that others should make their own decisions 
on the grounds that the NPT suits their national interests. 
-- Note the salutary influence this would have, however, on 
limiting the international arms race. It would also tend to 
defuse Chinese suspicions of Japanese militarism. 
- Reassure Sato that our security commitment to Japan will 
remain firm, and will serve as an adequate deterrent against 
all threats to Japan. 
Grace Notes  
-- Okinawa. Congratulate Sato on achieving a major goal in 
Okinawa Reversion and express appreciation that this was 
accomplished in ways that do not impair our mutual interests.

years of leadership of Japan in close association with the U. S. 
Acknowledge reumors of his pending resignation as President 
of the LDP. Express the hope that should he choose to leave

Foreiln Minister Takeo Fukuda  
Fukuda is reportedly highly sensitive to any circumstance that 
might adversely affect his ambitions to succeed Sato. Conversely, 
he would be eager to utilize any development that might improve 
those chances or garner him favorable publicity. Of all Japanese 
politicians, he has been among the least flexible on the China issue 
in public utterances. On relations with the U.S., he has responded 
to heavy Diet pressure to be tough with the Americans on a wide 
range of issues, especially involving Vietnam and prior consultation. 
This is a standard GOJ tactic, however, and one that should not 
disturb us unduly. 
The press in particular will be watching avidly for any hint as to 
whether we favor Fukuda or Tanaka in the succession struggle. You 
should let your meeting with Fukuda determine how long your meeting 
with Tanaka should last and the kind of frills -- photographs, press 
treatment and the like -- that should accompany it. In Japanese terms, 
you have no counterpart in the GOJ but most of your functions -- to 
the extent they exist -- are performed by the Foreign Minister and 
his staff, and Fukuda is Tanaka's senior in every respect. For these 
reasons it would be natural that your discussion with Fukuda should 
be longer and wider-ranging than with Tanaka, whereas if the opposite 
were the case, it would excite considerable speculation. 
While Fukuda heads his own faction, his views and political antecedents 
are much like Sato's. He is a product of the bureaucracy, and he made 
his deepest impact as Finance Minister, a position he occupied twice. 
Basically, his interests will coincide with Sato's and you should deal 
with him on China, the Soviet Union, Korea, Vietnam, rnultipolarity 
and the NPT in the same way you do with Sato. In addition, Fukuda 
may also raise the questions of residual problems related to Okinawan 
Reversion, the territorial dispute over the Senkakus Islands, and a 
permanent seat on the U. N. Security Council; and we have included 
talking points on these below. 
1. China. Like Sato, Fukuda will focus primarily on China policy, 
how we envisage the development of our relationship with Peking, what 
our intentions are toward Taiwan, and what transpired during the 
President's visit to Peking. He will want to obtain a feeling for what

will not take any action regarding the Vietnam conflict that 
would require prior consultation, and that we will continue to 
inform his government in advance of any significant movements 
that might affect U.S. units in Japan. If asked about reviewing 
prior consultation arrangements, you should say that we should 
think carefully before making substantial changes in a system 
that has worked so well for so long.

-- Give him your extimate of the military and political situation 
in the South and the ability of the North Vietnamese to maintain 
the level of their offensive, and explain the necessity for the 
moves against North Vietnam which the President announced 
on May 8. 
-- Give him your estimate of the roles played by the Soviets and 
Chinese in this action. 
5. The Multipolar World. Fukuda's views on Japan's role in a 
multipolar world appear to be close to those of Sato. Fukuda does 
not seem to relish the idea of a much more independent Japan maneu-
vering in a world having a congeries of power centers. Like Sato, 
he is presently groping for what role Japan might play in such a world, 
probably would prefer the greater security afforded by a continued 
close association with the U.S. in which Japan would enjoy most of 
the forms of equality and a fair degree of flexibility but in which it 
would in fact remain clearly the junior partner. 
-- Describe in general terms how you see the multipolar world 
emerging over the next decade, stressing Asia. What we want 
to see is a relationship of equals, and not the perpetuation of 
traditional balance of power concepts. 
-- Reassure Fukuda that the U.S. fully intends to play an effective 
role as a power in Asia and the Pacific over the long term, and 
that we will maintain the balance of ground, naval, and air forces 
necessary to do this.

-- Use this as an opportunity to assure Fukuda of the importance 
we place on maintaining our close ties with Japan, and that 
we will not sacrifice our essential relationship with Japan 
for other goals. 
Explain that the U.S. interest in adjusting the basic relation-
ship with Japan toward 'greater equality, inter-dependence, 
and reciprocity is aimed at putting our alliance on a more 
sustainable basis over the long term. 
6. NPT. Japan, having signed but not ra ified the NPT, is reportedly 
waiting for EURATOM to conclude a safeguards agreement with the 
IAEA, after which Japan will seek an agreement of its own under which 
the safeguards requirements will be no more burdensome on Japanese 
than on European industry. There have, however, been a disturbing 
number of reports to the effect that government officials believe the 
U.S. has lost interest in the NPT and is indifferent to whether Japan 
signs or not. 
? Express the views of the Administration on the NFT I we signed 
it and we favor it; we favor other countrie s accepting it; but we 
believe that others should make their own decisions on the 
grounds that the NPT suits their national interests. 
-- Note the salutary influence this would have, however, on the 
international arms race. It would also tend to defuse 
Chinese suspicions of Japanese militarism.

7. Okinawa Reversion. Fukuda played a key but little publicized role 
in the Okinawa reversion negotiations. As Finance Minister, he and 
Ambassador Kennedy, who as Secretary of the Treasury was Fukuda's 
counterpart when the negotiations began, worked out the basic financial 
arrangement. 
As Foreign Minister since shortly after it was signed, Fukuda has had to 
defend the agreement in the Diet and is accordingly intimately familiar with 
the details of the difficulties which remain. 1-le may well raise one or more 
reversion-related issues and may possibly remind you of the Japanese 
request at San Clemente that we enter into early discussions regarding further 
reduction of U.S. base areas in Okinawa. The Japanese at that time had in 
mind the release of the Awase Golf Course and Yaka Beach. 
Assure him subject he has raised will be given serious considera-
tion within USG. 
-- State that we will do what we can to accommodate urgent Japanese 
requirements, but that whatever problem we are discussing -- P-3' s, 
removal of nuclear weapons, claims, etc. -- there are equally strong 
inhibitions on our actions. 
If Awa.se Golf Cour se and Yaka Beach are raised, suggest that the 
Japanese discuss this through regular channels and that you will ensure 
that the appropriate U.S. officials are properly informed of the nature 
of the San Clemente discussion. 
8. Senkakus. Fukuda is more likely than Sato to raise this specific 
Okinawa-related issue, and perhaps to complain about our half-hearted 
support of the Japanese position. We desire to avoid public involvement 
in any dispute. 
-- Reaffirm our position that in returning administrative rights to 
the Senkakus to Japan, we neither add to nor detract from Japan's 
claim to sovereignty as it existed in 1945.

-- State that we can take no position on the claims by any party 
regarding the factors affecting earlier claims to sovereignty 
or the means by which sovereignty was acquired. 
-- If Fukuda asks, acknowledge that the language of the Security 
Treaty, which applies "to territories under the administration 
of Japan," could be interpreted to apply to the Senkakus in the 
post-reversion period. 
9. Security Council Seat for Japan. The Japanese have informed us 
that they intend to campaign hard to obtain a permanent seat on the 
U. N. Security Council. Some officials are said to feel that we are 
opposed to this. 
--Acknowledge the reasons (economic power, heavy U.N. 
assessment, size and influence, potential future growth) 
why Japan's claim to major power status by this means is 
valid. 
-- Say we would support Japan's claim as a matter of principle 
and would be interested to hear how Japan feels membership 
might be achieved in the face of the problems associated with 
charter revision, the size of the Council, and the veto.

LDP Leaders Kosaka, Mizuta. and Nakasone  
This group comprises a senior minister and two of the three chief 
officials (after Sato) of the LDP. Mizuta, currently Finance Minister, 
is a conservative and heads his own small faction. Kosaka, a former 
Foreign Minister, is a member of Ohira's faction and is currently head 
of the LDP's Policy Board. Nakasone (your former student), who leads 
his own large anti-Mainstream faction, is chairman of the Party's 
Executive Committee. An opportunist and sensitive to the winds of 
political change, he is undecided as to whether his Prime Ministerial 
ambitions can best be satisfied by affiliation with the Mainstream or by 
pursuit of China's blessing on his own. Dynamic and possessing something 
akin to what Americans think of as charisma, Nakasone is a nationalist, 
and as Defense Minister several years ago enunciated the doctrine of self-
reliance for Japan in military haraware. Most Americans respond well to 
his personality and end up with an exaggerated estimate of his chances to 
become Prime Minister. 
Suggested Talking Points  
1. China Policy  
Express regret (this word is important--it implies no blame, but 
only an understanding of this :problem)that our need for secrecy did 
not permit us to consult with the Japanese Government before the 
July 15 announcement, and indicate understanding of the political 
problems caused for the LDP leadership. 
-- Assure them we wish to minimize conflict in our approaches 
to Peking, and intend to consult closely on future steps and develop-
ments. 
Describe the atmospherics of your meetings in Peking with 
1111 Mao and Chou.

-- Explain the Shanghai Communique, e specially the sections on 
Japan and on the Taiwan problem. 
Describe our policy toward Taiwan, especially the importance we 
place on its continued economic viability and that it not be isolated 
internationally. 
? Draw them out on the status of Japan's efforts to establish contacts 
with Peking, and how they believe Japanese investment in Taiwan 
can be protected over the long term. 
-- Ask their opinions as to possible points of friction in our 
approaches to China, and how we can best prevent the Chinese 
from playing the U.S. and Japan off against each other. 
2. Policy Toward the Soviet Union  
- Give them your general assessment of the Moscow summit, 
and discuss what you believe to be Soviet intentions regarding Japan 
and China. 
Stress that the SALT agreement is the kind of progress on arms 
control by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. for which Japan expressed a 
desire when they signed the NPT. 
- Ask them what they foresee in terms of future Japanese-Soviet 
relations, the prospects for a peace treaty, and possible U.S. -Japan 
joint ventures in Siberia.

Japan relationship and multipolarity.

ments beyond its own borders.

toward greater equaliiy, inter-dependence, and reciprocity is aimed 
at making our alliance more sustainable over the long term, and is 
in no way a subterfuge for pressing Japan to stand by itself.

role in Asia, and will maintain the mix of ground, naval, and air 
forces in the area necessary to make that role effective.

Meeting With Senior News Editors  
The media organizations represented at this meeting cover the spectrum 
in Japan. Yorrxiuri and Asahi are probably the most stridently anti-establish-
ment, anti-government and, given the government's close ties with the 
U.S., are the least sympathetic to the U.S., particularly on Vietnam and 
the U.S. -Japan security tie. Sankei in the past year or two has changed 
from its earlier pro-U.S. bias. At the other end of the spectrum is the 
pro-government Japan Times, which because it publishes only an 
English-language edition is of relatively small influence. (Several others 
such as Mainichi and Yorniuri also publish English-language editions, but 
these are quite different in news and editorial content than their 
Japanese-language editions.) Also included in this group is Japan's 
leading news commentator, Mr. Ogata. Speaking most generally, however, 
Japanese media tend to be heavily critical of the Liberal Democratic Gov-
ernments, and usually of,the U.S. as well. 
You can expect a sharply probing, well-informed reception, and what they 
write will probably be balanced toward the negative side. They will almost 
certainly press for the content of your discussions with Sato and Fukuda, 
but will also be particularly interested in your global and regional 
perspectives, China and its relationship with the Soviet Union, and how you 
see Japan relating to all of this. 
Your Talking Points  
Outline your views of the emerging multipolar system in Asia 
and the world, and in what manner Japan might relate to this 
evolving order. 
Reassure the group that the U.S. continues to attach the highest 
value to its alliance with Japan, intends to stand by its defense 
commitment to Japan, and sees no contradiction between these 
intentions and the 1.T.S. effort to improve relations with the PRC.

Socialist Party Leaders  
It is only recently with the emergence of some good younger people in 
the Japanese Socialist Party that Americans have found it useful to 
talk to the Party's leadership. The Party's Secretary General, 
Mr. Ishibashi, is one of the more worthwhile Socialists, and has a 
broader world view than almost any of the others because of his years 
as head of the Party's international section. In the presence of the 
Party Chairman, Mr. Narita, however, it is unlikely that he will speak 
up in any spontaneous way. Narita himself has always appeared to be 
the hide-bound Marxist ideologue and he has occasionally lectured 
visiting Americans on our ideological sins. His Party has been too 
distressed by internal wrangling to serve as any kind of a threat ? 
beyond harassment -- to the LDP. It is unlikely they will be much 
interested in economic affairs. 
Suggested Talking Points  
Outline your views on the emerging multipolar system in Asia, 
and in what ways Japan might relate to this evolving international 
order. 
-- Reassure the group that the U.S. continue to attach the highest 
value to its alliance with Japan, intends to stand by its defense 
commitment to Japan, and sees no contradiction between these

Meeting With Former. Foreign Ministers: Miki, Fujiyama, Aichi,  
Ohira, Shiina and Kosaka  
This meeting will provide you with the opportunity to meet two Prime 
Ministerial aspirants, Ohira and Miki. Ohira heads the fairly strong 
faction he inherited from former Prime Minister Ikeda, which places 
him in the LOP Mainstream, though not in its inner circles. Recent 
reports indicate that he will throw his weight behind Tanaka's candidacy, 
but there is still an outside chance that Ohira might emerge as a dark 
horse candidate if, as seems quite possible, the first ballot at the Party 
Convention produces a deadlock. A more likely outcome is that he would 
be Foreign Minister to Tanaka should he win. Less aggressive than 
Tanaka or Fukuda, Ohira is skilled in the art of Japanese-style con-
sensual politics. As Foreign Minister in 1963-66, he was in his dealings 
with the U.S. Government consistently a reliable, cooperative counterpart. 
Mild, who was Sato's Foreign Minister during the period when the Korean 
agreement was worked out and the discussion on Okinawa Reversion began, 
heads his own faction. A perennial candidate, he ran against Sato in 
the last two party elections. As a leader of the anti-Mainstream group 
within the LDP, he is less committed to the alliance with the U.S. and 
more inclined toward independent initiatives than the heretofore 
predominant Mainstreamers. 
The others are less important. You will already have met Kosaka at 
the luncheon with the LOP executives; he is an Ohira faction ma tx? whose _ 
position as LDP Policy Board Chairman is,due more to his standing within 
the Ohira faction than to his own abilities. He is, however, friendly to 
Americans. Aichi, a very decent man, is a faithful Sato follower. His 
work is negotiating the Okinawa Treaty with us has been appreciated by 
both governments, although he lost considerable face over his Ministry's 
failure to anticipate our China initiative. Fujiyarna, who negotiated the 
Security Treaty with us as Kishi's Foreign Minister, has since turned 
against the Kisbi-Sato line, and has attempted to create a position for 
himself as the best LDP connection to Peking. The Chinese, however, 
have a clear view of his influence and are apparently only stringing him 
along. Shiina, a workman-like Foreign Minister well liked by the Foreign 
Ministry professionals, is not a prominent factor in LDP politics.

Of this group, Fujiyama and Mild have recently been to Peking, and

CONFIDENTIAL  
Minister of International Trade and Industry 
Kakuei Tanaka 
The rough-hewn Tanaka is running hard for the Prime Ministership. 
The Japanese press will assess your meeting with him as an effort 
to size him up as a potential Prime Minister and will be eager for 
any hint of the outcome of your discussion as it bears on this 
situation. Tanaka will have difficulty resisting the temptation to 
exploit this to his own advantage. He is a member of Sato's own 
political faction and should Sato step aside, Tanaka would contest 
with former Chief Cabinet Secretary Hon i for control of it. 
Tanaka alone of Mainstream LDP politicians has avoided close contact 
with Americans, and his views on our security relationship, on Chinese 
affairs and on other matters of major concern are not well known. 
Tanaka is the quintessential political tactician. He hade his greatest 
impression as Secretary General of the LDP during the 1965-66 and 
1968-71 periods, and his stock with Sato has risen recently because he 
has successfully undertaken several tough jobs for Sato (the textile 
agreement with us and settlement of the defense budget squabble in 
the Diet) at considerable risk to his own prestige. 
Tanaka like to project the image of a youthful, vigorous defender of 
Japan's interests. Possessed of a considerable ego, he is very 
publicity conscious. Be certain to agree with him in advance on what 
may or may not be said to the press. 
1. Major Political and Security Issues  
Tanaka will probably be less interested and informed than Sato and 
Fukuda on the Chinese, Soviet, and other major international issues, 
but will nonetheless want to discuss them with you. Given our relative 
lack of knowledge of his views in this area, you should try to draw him 
out on these problems. 
A. China 
-- We regret (in the Japanese context the term implies no admission 
of guilt, but only an understanding of their problem) that our need 
for secrecy did not permit us to consult with Japan before the

July 15 announcement, and our understanding of the political 
problems the China issue has caused the Sato Government. 
-- Our China initiative is not an attempt to play Japan off 
against China. 
-- We wish to avoid conflict in our approaches to Peking, and 
intend to consult closely on future steps and developments. 
-- We made no secret deals during the China trip, and we took 
no actions that compromise Japan's basic interests. 
-- Explain the Shanghai Communique, especially the sections 
on Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. 
-- While we recognize the importance of China policy to Japan, 
particularly at this point, and while we fully intend to consult 
closely on this question, you believe that we must not allow 
China to obscure other important aspects of our relationship. 
B. Soviet Union. 
-- Review for Tanaka the President's Moscow visit and the 
agreements reached there. 
-- Give Tanaka your assessment of Moscow's intentions regarding 
regional security arrangements, both in Europe and Asia. 
-- Give Tanaka your assessment of Sino-Soviet relations.

C. Korea

? We will stand behind our defense commitment to the ROK, and 
do not intend to reduce our forces there further in the foreseeable 
future. 
-- We will support the efforts of the ROK to seek a relaxation of 
tensions and increased communication on the Korean Peninsula. 
- - We welcome the direct discussion between North and South Korea 
as what we hope will be the beginning of a long-term process of 
relaxation of tensions between the two. 
? We believe it is too early to conclude that Pyongyang has firmly 
committed itself to long-term peaceful accommodation with 
Seoul, and to know to what extent Peking and Moscow can and will 
restrain Pyongyang if necessary. Therefore, we should move 
cautiously. 
? We should also avoid those moves that could seriously undermine 
political cohesion in South Korea, or could help Pyongyang drive 
wedges between South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. 
-- We are presently exploring strategy and tactics on the Korean 
question in next fall's UN General Assembly, and are coordinating 
with ROK, Japan and others. Postponement of the question this

year as last would have the advantage of not undercutting the 
Seoul-Pyongyang talks and injecting another irritant into our 
relations with Peking and Moscow. But we must also consider 
fallback positions. 
D. Vietnam 
-- Express appreciation for the understanding and support of the 
Japanese Government for our efforts in Vietnam over the years, 
and particularly following the President's May 8 speech. 
Give Tanaka the rationale for the basic U.S. commitment in 
Vietnam, as well as that for our response to the current 
North Vietnamese offensive, stressing the position articulated 
in the President's May 8 speech. 
E. The Multipolar World  
? Describe in general terms how you see the multipolar world 
emerging in the next decade, stressing Asia. What we hope to 
see is a relationship of equals, and not the perpetuation of 
traditional balance of power concepts. 
-- Reassure Tanaka that the U.S. fully intends to play an effective 
role as a power in Asia and the Pacific over the long term, and 
that we will maintain the balance of ground, naval, and air forces 
necessary to do this.

CONFIDENTIAL 5 
-- Assure Tanaka of the importance we attach to maintaining 
our close ties with Japan. 
-- Explain to Tanaka the vital role we believe Japan can play in 
Asia, particularly as regards economic and technical develop-
ment, but also in Asia's political councils. (Specifying the 
roles we envisage for Japan as essential, inasmuch as some 
Japanese believe that what they see as our failure to do so in 
the past year indicates that we are encouraging japan to move 
toward a regional security role in Asia.) 
? Explain that the U. S. interest in adjusting the basic relation-
ship with Japan toward greater equality, inter-dependence, and 
reciprocity is aimed at putting our alliance on a more sustainable 
basis over the long term. 
F. NPT 
? Express the views of the Administration on the NPT: we signed 
it and we favor it; we favor other countries accepting it; but we 
believe that others should make their own decisions on the 
grounds that the NPT suits their national interests. 
-- Note the salutary influence this would have, however, on 
limiting the international arms race. It would also tend to 
defuse Chinese suspicions of Japanese militarism.

? Reassure Tanaka that our security commitment to Japan will 
remain firm, and will serve as an adequate deterrent 
against all threats to Japan. 
U. S. japan Bilateral Economic Issues  
Tanaka will expect you to review economic issues in a general way with 
him, and it would seem strange to him if you did not. 
-- The U. S. intends to pursue its effort to persuade Japan to remove 
trade barriers, particularly quotas illegal (under the GATT), 
both through diplomatic channels, and in the GATT. 
-- Although Japan has made considerable progress in liberalizing 
inward investments, we would hope that the GOJ will permit 
full foreign capital participation in all Japanese industries. 
? We welcome Japan's cooperation in examining and formulating 
recommendations for revising the international monetary 
system. 
-- The U. S. is mounting a major effort to promote U. S. exports, 
and we would believe that it is important that the Government 
of japan assist us in increasing our exports to Japan. 
-- The U. S. is controlling its inflation, and thus is gradually recovering 
the stability essential to the world trading system. Japan's 
cooperation is appreciated.

University Professors 
This group represents Japan's leading .commentators on domestic politics, 
security problems and international relations. While most of the people on 
this list are basically conservative in outlook, their views cover a wide 
political spectrum. They are listed as academics, which is true enough, 
but it should be recognized that Japanese professors contribute widely to 
the public print. Unless clearly enjoined from doing so, virtually every 
one on this list will feel iMpelled to publish something about this meeting. 
China and U.S. -Japan relations, especially the security area, will be the 
fields of specific interest. 
Suggested Talking Points  
Outline your views of the emerging multipolar system in Asia 
and the world and in what manner Japan might relate to this 
evolving order. 
-- Reassure the group that the U.S. continues to attach the highest 
value to its alliance with Japan, intends to stand by its defense 
commitment to Japan, and sees no contradiction between these 
intentions and the U.S. effort to improve relations with the PRC. 
-- Explain that the U.S. interest in adjusting our basic relationship 
with Japan toward greater, equality and reciprocity is directed toward 
making our alliance more sustainable over the long haul. 
Reassure the group that the U.S. firmly intends to stay in Asia 
and the Pacific to play a balancing role, and will retain a mix of 
forces required to make this role effective.
