 CHINA'S LEADERSHIP IN THE WAKE OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION
 The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which erupted in the spring of 1966,
 has had a profound impact on the shape and effectiveness of the leadership in Peking.
 The image of unanimity that the Chinese Communist leadership projected for its first 16
 years of rule was rent during the Cultural Revolution, revealing a divided elite wracked
 by personal rivalries and conflicts over power and policy. During the past three years,
 the leadership has gone through a violent convulsion, and the fissures opened and
 widened by the Cultural Revolution make it unlikely that the regime will be able to
 build a fully cohesive top command for some time to come. In the course of the
 struggle, many shif,s have taken place at the pinnacle of power, and the new ruling
 politburo produced by the ninth party congress in April 1969 is an uneasy amalgam of
 competing interest groups, each striving for power-or survival-at the expense of the
 others. Although the politburo may present a facade of unity as long as the venerable
 Mao Tse-tung presides over it, its current divisions will be an element of potential
 instability for the short term and especially during the post-Mao transition period.
 CHANGING THE GUARD IN PEKING
 The Cultural Revolution has profoundly
 altered the shape and perhaps the function of
 Communist China's ruling body, the politburo of
 the Communist Party. The new body is a peculiar
 creation compared with the previous one. Prior to
 the Cultural Revolution, the politburo consisted
 of party chairman Mao Tse-tung and a number of
 top regime officials, each of whom had a special
 constituency that he monitored on behalf of the
 party. Thus, one man's primary duty was agricul-
 ture; one concerned himself with economic plan-
 ning; one with foreign affairs; another with party
 business; yet another with military matters, and
 so forth. The new politburo does not appear to be
 constructed along such lines. There is no sharp
 breakdown of responsibilities. No one, for exam-
 ple, is clearly assigned to oversee the vital agricul-
 ture sector of the economy. Instead, the current
 politburo seems to be a fragile balance of rival
 groupings that have emerged out of the leadership
 struggle of the past three years.
 The various terms employed to describe the
 leadership groupings-"radicals" versus "conserva-
 tives," "extremists" versus "moderates," "ideo-
 logues" versus "pragmatists"-are inadequate to
 describe the complexities of the situation. Never-
 theless, they do serve to highlight the fact that
 most, if not all, of the present politburo members
 possess political identities that place them to one
 side or the other in the political spectrum of the
 elite. Thus, those who have clearly identified
 themselves with the excesses of the Cultural
 Revolution will be referred to in this paper as
 "radicals," and those who appear to have been
 either active in restraining the excesses or who
 have been the victims of personal denunciation by
 "radical" elements will be labeled "moderates" or
 "conservatives."
 The radical "Maoist" group holds the pre-
 eminent positions in the new politburo. It com-
 prises the chairman himself and his heir-designate
 Lin Piao; their wives; Mao's speech writer Ch'en
 Po-ta; his hatchet man and security specialist

 K'ang Sheng; a long-time leftist propaganda spe-
 cialist, Yao Wen-yuan; and Chang Ch'un-ch'iao,
 the political boss of Shanghai. In addition, Mao's
 bodyguard, Wang Tung-hying, is one of the four
 alternate members of the politburo. All of these
 leaders-with the exception of Mao, Lin, and
 Madame Lin-belonged to the so-called central
 "Cultural Revolution Group," an inner elite fos-
 tered by Mao and charged with purging the Chi-
 nese Communist Party and pushing his "revolu-
 tionary" ideas. Since late 1965 these people have
 risen rapidly on the crest of political turmoil, and
 they owe their present positions entirely to the
 fact that they proved their personal loyalty to
 Mao even before the Cultural Revolution began.
 They constitute little more than the old man's
 personal entourage. Of this group only Lin Piao,
 who is minister of defense, and K'ang Sheng, who
 is in charge of the political security apparatus,
 appear to perform what might be considered
 normal politburo functions. The rest-in par-
 ticular Madame Mao-are very active in the field
 of cultural affairs which was, of course, of major
 political significance in the Cultural Revolution.
 At present, however, there is little evidence as to
 what specific tasks of leadership they may per-
 form other than trying to firm up their control
 over a restructured Communist Party.
 Mao's group also dominates the standing
 committee of the politburo, normally the highest
 policy-making body in China. It is now composed
 of Mao and Lin, Chou En-lai, Ch'en Po-ta, and
 K'ang Sheng. The only one of this group not
 closely identified with the radical excesses of the
 Cultural Revolution is Chou. Mao, however, ap-
 pears to trust Chou's personal loyalty completely.
 Because the Rill politburo does not appear to
 function norms Ily, it is also possible that the
 standing committee may not be playing its cus-
 tomary role. Some of the programs pursued since
 the ninth party congress are those pushed by
 Chou En-lai and the more moderate members of
 Special Report
 the politburo, and others bear the imprint of the
 radicals, suggesting that the standing committee is
 having great difficulty in settling on one set of
 coherent policies, let alone in getting them carried
 out.
 The new politburo is also remarkable for its
 unusually large military representation. Along
 with Defense Minister Lin Piao, the politburo
 now contains the chief of staff of the People's
 Liberation Army, the political commissar of the
 Navy, the Air Force chief, the director of the
 General Rear Services Department, and two re-
 gional military commanders. In addition, the
 commander of a field army is an alternate mem-
 ber. It is doubtful that these men constitute a
 unified political faction. On the contrary, because
 the military has tended to split along the same
 radical-conservative lines that have ruptured party
 and goverment, the military figures on the
 politburo probably reflect divergent views and
 different constituencies. Nevertheless, several of
 these military leaders shared one common expe-
 rience-heavy attacks from the Red Guards-
 which may have caused them to favor more
 moderate lines.
 Another, smaller group on the politburo
 consists of Chou En-lai, Li Hsien-nien, and Hsieh
 F.u-chih, the only remnants of what used to be a
 substantial representation of the government
 bureaucracy. Chou and Li, and perhaps Hsieh,
 may share a considerable coincidence of views
 with the moderate members of the military
 group. This element may also pick up at least two
 more supporters from the group of four old-
 timers who are still on the politburo. Chu Te and
 Tung Pi-wu are octogenarians, and Liu Po-ch'eng
 is almost eighty and enfeebled. The fourth mem-
 ber of thi:< group is Marshal Yeh Chien-ying, who
 still serves on the powerful Military Affairs Com-
 mittee. Chu Te and Yeh-both of whom were
 heavily attacked in the Cultural Revolution-may

 well side with the moderates. Liu is a cipher
 because of his age and general debility, and Tung
 may well follow whatever Mao dictates.
 There are also four alternate members of the
 politburo. Le Te-sheng has already been men-
 tioned as one of the military representatives and
 Wang Tung-hying as one of Mao's entourage. Chi
 Teng-k'uei is the vice chairman of the Honan
 Province Revolutionary Committee. In addition
 to the fact that Chi is said to be a "personal
 friend" of Mao, he seems to be on the politburo
 as a symbol of those provincial political leaders
 who were actively aligned with the radicals during
 the Cultural Revolution. Li Hsueh-feng, on the
 other hand, lost his post as head of the North
 China Party Bureau in late 1966 and was sub-
 sequently reinstated in the lesser post of chairman
 of the Hopeh Province Revolutionary Committee.
 He may be on the politburo as a symbol of the
 former party officials who have been rehabilitated
 by the "thought of Mao Tse-tung."
 If it is correct to view the new politburc as
 an uneasy body of competing special-interest
 groups, questions are raised about the attitudes of
 the members, the interests each represents and
 the degree to which the politburo as a whole
 reflects Mao's personal power. Two of Mao's pur-
 poses in launching the Cultural Revolution were
 to remove certain party leaders he believed had
 put him on the shelf after the failure of the Great
 Leap Forward in 1958-1959 and to regain per-
 sonal mastery of the command and control ap-
 paratus of the party. He is reported in Red Guard
 accounts to have complained that his former
 party lieutenants, Liu Shao-ch' and Teng Hsiao-
 p'ing, had treated him 'like a dead parent at a
 funeral," i.e., revered but no longer to be con-
 sulted or obeyed. No doubt Mao intended to
 replace Liu, Teng, and the others who fell during
 Special Report
 the Cultural Revolution with people completely
 loyal to him and responsive to his directions. The
 politburo that emered from the ninth party con-
 gress, however, does not appear to fit that mold.
 The disparate elements that constitute the polit-
 buro and the apparent difficulty the leadership is
 having in developing and implementing new na-
 tional policies suggest that Mao still has not re-
 gathered all the reins of power into his own
 hands.
 Any assessment of Mao's political strength,
 however, is hampered by the lack of good infor-
 mation on the manner in which he follows
 through in shaping and implementing policies that
 are outlined in the brief, Delphic "instructions"
 that he periodically issues. During the Cultural
 Revolution, Mao's "instructions" were often used
 by opposing political forces to their own advan-
 tage. Such developments add to the difficulty of
 determining when and on what side Mao commits
 himself on issues under debate by th' leadership.
 The evidence that is available suggests that despite
 his advocacy of extreme policies, Mao has prob-
 ably managed better than his ,Wore radical lieuten-
 ants to keep his lines open tr., those figures in the
 army and in the government establishment who
 have often attempted to limit the scope of many
 of his pet projects.
 Because of his advanced age, frequent
 lengthy absences from public view, and the lead-
 ership's practice of issuing quite contradictory
 guidelines in Mao's name, it has often appeared
 that his instructions have been manipulated by
 rival forces in the elite. Thus, radical elements
 have probably pushed some of the excesses of the
 Cultural Revolution and carried on personal
 vendettas or, grounds that they were acting in
 accordance with Mao's will, while conservative
 forces have employed the same rationale to coun-
 ter policies and personalities to which they were
 opposed. This suggests that Mao has not been able

 to control all major events in the Cultural Revolu-
 tion and that there has been both considerable
 distortion and nonobedience of his instructions as
 they have filtered from his inner circle, through
 the top leadership ranks, and down to the local
 levels.
 Mao, nevertheless, is not merely a figurehead
 manipulated by some eminence grise behind the
 throne. He appears to remain a consummate
 politician who, if unable to have his way on all
 matters, is still.able to retain considerable leverage
 by playing off opposing groups within the elite
 against one another. He may, for example, rec-
 ognize more readily than some of his radical col-
 leagues-who apparently have been supporting
 troublesome factionalists in many localities-that
 Peking needs to restore national discipline and
 establish a greater degree of control over the
 provincial situation before many major policy
 initiatives can be undertaken. Hence, he has
 responded affirmatively to the urging of order-
 oriented local military men who have asked
 Peking for a freer hand to suppress dissidents in
 recent months. At the same time, Mao may well
 have doubts about the responsiveness of many
 regional and local commanders to his revolution-
 ary goals; thus, he may be behind the radical-
 sounding press attacks in recent months on the
 army's poor performance of its political duties.
 Whatever the extent of Mao's influence on
 given issues, he remains a charismatic figure of
 enormous prestige and, in many respects, the
 unifying element maintaining the present fragile
 balance at the center. Any open and direct chal-
 lenge to his pre-eminence seems highly unlikely at
 this stage. The men who have been willing-or
 forced-to submerge their major differences to
 work under Mao, however, may be unwilling to
 accept the leadership of a less revered individual.
 The fact that, in a basic sense, no one can really
 replace Mao raises great uncertainties about
 Special Report
 China's future, and these uncertainties persist
 even though Mao took the step at the eleventh
 party plenum in August 1966 of designating Vice
 Chairman Lin Piao as his successor.
 Totalitarian regimes such as China's histori-
 cally have had difficulty arranging for the orderly
 transfer of power, and the assiduous grooming of
 Lin as Mao's immediate successor has been a
 conscious attempt to solve this problem.
 Throughout the Cultural Revolution he has con-
 stantly been portrayed not only as Mao's "closest
 comrade in arms" but also as the foremost inter-
 preter and exponent of "Mao Tse-tung Thought"
 in China.                               25X6
 Lin has risen in spite of a Ion record of
 illness                                 He
 was elected to the politburo in 1955 and to its
 standing committee in 1958. The following year
 he was appointed minister of national defense,
 replacing the disgraced P'eng Te-huai. He was also
 put in active charge of the party's Military Affairs
 Committee, the supreme military authority.
 Even though Lin is a civil war hero and has
 stood at the center of party and military power
 for over a decade, less is known about him than
 about any other major Chinese leader. There is a
 large body of articles and speeches attributed to
 him, but it shows only that he applauds and
 echoes Maoist doctrine at every point. Lin's con-
 tacts with foreigners have also been limited. He
 has never been abroad except for medical treat-
 ment in the Soviet Union, and his attitude toward
 the outside world is probably suspicious and
 hostile.
 Apparently the major turning point in Lin's
 career came in 1959, when he was charged by
 Mao with improving morale and tightening up lax

 political practices in the army. It is clear, in
 retrospect, that Mao hoped to exploit a politically
 rejuvenated army under Lin as a major instrument
 in combating the views of both professional mili-
 tary leaders and party apparatus chiefs who he
 believed were opposing his various campaigns to
 step up "revolutionary fervor" in Chinese society.
 On the surface it would appear that the
 broader national role of the army in the early
 1960s, and  its subsequent emergence as the
 primary instrument of political and administrative
 control in the country, have enhanced both Lin's
 power and authority vis-a-vis the other members
 of the elite and his ability to consolidate his
 position after Mao goes. Nevertheless, there are
 other indications that Lin's role since 1959, and
 particularly in the Cultural Revolution, has cost
 him much support in important military and
 civilian circles. His efforts to put "politics in
 command" in the army for example, seriously
 exacerbated strains between officers oriented to-
 ward political action and those more concerned
 with long-standing professional military problems.
 Furthermore, Lin's support of Mao's purge of
 numerous senior officers in December 1966 and
 January 1967 aroused dismay among large num-
 bers of the military leadership. Again, during
 some of the most destructive phases of the radical
 Red Guard movement, it was Lin who backed
 Mao's orders to the army to intervene on the side
 of the "true revolutionaries." This move probably
 did not sit well with sonic elements in the army.
 There is little evidence that Lin is as astute
 politically as Mao Tse-tung, and there have been
 recurrent rumors that important, but unnamed,
 members of the regime consider Lin unfit to
 assume Mao's mantle. Although there is no evi-

 appears in fact that his own prestige and strength
 derive from Mao's confidence in him rather than
 from a power base in the military establishment.
 The probable future course of China's num-
 ber-three man is easier to chart than that of Mao's
 second in command. Chou En-lai is as close to
 being the indispensable man as any official in
 China today, and his death would have a pro-
 found impact on the stability of the leadership.
 Chou's record over the years suggests that he has
 discovered that he can exert much more influence
 on the course of events by being number-three
 than by entering the lists as a possible successor
 to Mao. He has, thus far, managed to retain Mao's
 confidence and at the same time project an image
 of reasonableness, moderation, and responsibility.
 He serves an important function as a loyal execu-
 tor of Mao's policies and as a "window on
 reality" for the ideologically oriented party chair-
 man.
 As premier, Chou's chief concern is the gov-
 ernment bureaucracy and foreign affairs, although
 his interest and capacities apparently involve him
 in all major policy issues confronting the regime.
 During the Cultural Revolution, moreover, addi-
 tional responsibilities devolved on him almost by
 default because he is apparently the only member
 of the top three with sufficient vigor to engage in
 the day-to-day direction of central government
 affairs. Chou is a suave, urbane politician who has
 reached his key position after decades of savage
 struggle and subtle compromise. He has demon-
 strated an uncanny knack for emerging on the
 right side of issues, and his toughness, caution,
 and willingness to use the knife when necessary
 have served him well in the vicious infighting that
 has been part of the Cultural Revolution from the
 outset.
 Special Report
 Chou's ability to retain his powerful position
 even though out of step with some aspects of the
 Cultural Revolution is a reflection both of his
 unrivaled political skill and his indispensability.
 Nevertheless, through his efforts to curb radical
 excesses, Chou may have incurred the wrath of
 some of the radical "Maoists," and they made
 several attempts during the Cultural Revolution
 to undercut his position. Sometimes they at-
 tacked him directly, but -their major onslaughts
 were more often made against his vice premiers
 and other government ministry officials in an
 eff:-)rt to weaken his personal power base.
 Red Guard posters have alleged that some of
 the attacks on government officials in early 1967
 were the work of "ultraleftist extremists" called
 the "May 16 Corps." Reportedly supported by
 members of the powerful Cultural Revolution
 Group headed by Ch'en Po-ta, K'ang Sheng, and
 Madame Mao, the May 16 Corps was accused of
 pressing a long-range plan to strike at Chou's
 subordinates and allies and ultimately to bring
 down Chou himsel'. Even allowing for a high
 degree of exaggeration In these charges, it is not
 surprising that the Cultural Revolution Gro-ap

 would try to weaken Chou, and the subsequent
 purge of some of its second-echelon members in
 late 1967 reflected unfavorably on Chen Po-ta
 and particularly on K'ang Sheng, whether or not
 they in fact were behind-the-scenes backers of the
 "May 16 Corps." Chou himself was able to sur-
 vive the radicals' onslaughts perhaps because Mao
 was persuaded that he was needed to hold the
 country together. Nonetheless, Chou's personal
 base of power did suffer serious attrition, and,
 despite his public defense of some of his key
 associates, several failed to survive or were re-
 duced to lesser positions after the ninth congress.
 Despite the setbacks to his entourage, Chou
 still seems to retain considerable room for maneu-
 ver within the regime. Several of his proteges are
 still around and probably continue to work on
 economic planning, for example, even though
 rernoved from the politburo, More important,
 because Chou has not been identified with the
 worst excesses of the Cultural Revolution, he is
 probably the only high-ranking official still in a
 position to talk with all groups engaged in the
 current struggle over power and policy. Finally, at
 a time when Peking is under considerable pressure
 from Moscow, Chou's unrivaled experience in for-
 eign affairs once again reinforces the notion of his
 indispensability. The fact that Chou is apparently
 content to exercise huge power without trying to
 assume Mao's mantle, plus his ability to be all
 things to all men, makes it appear that he still has
 the best prospect of any Chinese leader to survive
 in a position of authority.
 CH'EN PO-TA AND WANG SHENG
 The remaining members of the standing
 committee have ;:peen prominent in the radical
 grouping in the central leadership ever since the
 beginning of the Cultural Revolution. Ch'en, re-
 portedly Mao's ghost writer for decades, headed
 up the Cultural Revolution Group, which had
 Special Report
 primary responsibility for the Red Guards and
 reportedly continues to play a role in pasty build-
 ing. Since the demise of the Red Guards as a
 political force, Ch'en has lost an important power
 base, and his support from the grassroots mass
 organizations has probably been weakened. In
 any case, he appears to owe his position entirely
 to his close personal relationship with Mao.
 K'ang Sheng was long the head of the secret
 police and intelligence services, and he has appar-
 ently resumed that role in recent years. An
 important party figure long before the Commu-
 nist take-over in 1949, K'ang was demoted in the
 mid-1940s at the time Liu Shao-ch'i emerged as
 Mao's second in command. K'ang has risen
 rapidly, however, since the beginning of the
 Cultural Revolution and served as adviser to the
 Cultural Revolution Group. Red Guard accounts
 have suggested that K'ang currently has direct
 responsibilities in party rebuilding as well as the
 principal responsibility for political security
 work.
 Presumably both men are close to Madame
 Mao (Chiang Ch'ing) and other Cultural Revolu-
 tion Group members on the politburo, but their
 militance in supporting Mao's program for "revo-
 lution" has probably alienated the more moderate
 and pragmatic forces in the leadership. Although
 both Ch'en and K'ang have hastened to identify
 themselves with moderate policy lines when
 necessary, both have attempted to feather their
 political nests where possible by eliminating
 actual and potential rivals. As political security
 chief, for example, K'ang Sheng has kept exten-
 sive dossiers-for use when needed-on other
 politburo members. In any case, Ch'en and K'ang
 have almost certainly made so many enemies over
 the course of the revolution that unless they
 succeed in eliminating their opponents or in com-
 ing to terms with them, both will probably be
 hard pressed to retain much political influence in
 a post-Mao regime.

 THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION
 GROUP LEADERS
 Many of the strengths and weaknesses that
 characterize the positions of Ch'en and K'ang also
 apply to the remaining Cultural Revolution
 Group figures on the politburo: Chiang Ch'ing,
 Chang Ch'un-ch'iao, Yao Wen-yuan, Yeh Ch'un
 (Madame Lin Piao), aad Wang Tung-hsing. Before
 the Cultural Revolution these people were politi-
 cal nonentities or lower echelon leaders, none of
 whom had a firm independent base of support.
 Some, and perhaps all, of them are fanatical,
 doctrinaire ideologues who actually share Mao's
 belief that it is essential to maintain a high state
 of tension and ideological fervor in China in order
 to sustain revolutionary momentum and ensure
 rapid change.
 The Cultural Revolution Group leaders are
 ambitious underlings who believe that their best
 opportunity to consolidate their positions is to
 continue to push the radical sociopolitical pro-
 grains that Mao wants and to try to weaken their
 opponents within the central leadership. There-
 fore, they probably consider voices for modera-
 tion a real danger to themselves. During the
 course of the Cultural Revolution the position of
 the Cultural Revolution Group leaders was pro-
 gressively weakened by the fall of several of their
 middle-echelon adherents, and the moderating
 trend evident in recent months probably has
 further circumscribed their room for maneuver.
 At present, their power base is rudimentary; they
 have only tenuous organizational support in the
 provinces, and little following among the people.
 Once Mao goes, their power is likely to diminish
 considerably unless they can develop new sources
 of political strength. They may currently be
 attempting to undermine the power base of some
 regional and provincial military chieftains. But
 even if they make some progress along these lines,
 they have made so many enemies that their future
 Special Report
 political prospects are dim under any but the
 most militant of regimes.
 The most fanatical and potentially the most
 politically insecure of these individuals is Chiang
 Ch'ing, Mao's fourth wife. She first became an
 important political figure only in late 1965, when
 Mao used her to plant an article in the Shanghai
 press attacking a playwright who was to serve as a
 symbol of all opposition to Mao's thought and
 will. The madame, a one-time bit player in
 Shanghai movies, had been occupied for more
 than 15 years with an effort to reduce all of the
 Chinese arts to propaganda. Until 1965, party
 leaders seem to have regarded her as a simple-
 minded nuisance not to be taken seriously.
 In the early stages of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion, however, she emerged as a formidable
 opponent. As a leader of the central Cultural
 Revolution Group as well as "adviser" to that
 body for the conduct of "revolution" in the
 People's Liberation Army, she became the most
 vocal spokesman for the militants. In all her roles,
 she has demonstrated an enormous talent for
 mischief-making, and through her incitement of
 Red Guard disruptions and her attacks on large
 numbers of government and military leaders she
 probably earned the undying enmity of those in
 the moderate camp in both Peking and the prov-
 inces. In recent weeks her contributions to "revo-
 lutionary literature and art" have been heavily
 praised in the official press in such a manner as to
 suggest that her voice may still he influential in
 regime councils. Because many of these articles
 have been thinly veiled criticisms of the state of
 army-civilian relations, there seems little reason to
 believe that Chiang Ch'ing has ceased castigating
 her military and government opponents within
 the leadership.

 CHANG CH'UN-CH'IAO AND
 YAO WEN-YUAN
 Among Madame Mao's closest allies have
 been Chang Ch'un-ch'iao and Yao Wen-yuan. The
 latte,, according to Soviet claims, is her son-in-
 law, Chang and Yao, almost complete unknowns
 before the Cultural Revolution and both young
 men by Chinese leadership standards, had worked
 with Chiang Ch'ing on cultural matters in
 Shanghai and assisted her in preparing some of
 the earliest moves in the leadership purge. Chang
 and Yao serve as chairmar, and first vice chair-
 man, respectively, of the Shanghai municipal
 revolutionary committee and have turned that
 city into an important power base for radical
 forces in the central leadership.
 One of Chang's and Yao's reported duties
 has been their involvement in moves to revive the
 party in a new Maoist image. Several sources have
 reported that both men had major responsibilities
 in preparing for the ninth party congress, with
 Chang allegedly being assigned to rewrite the
 party program and Yao being given responsi-
 bilities in connection with organizing the con-
 gress. Again, both have consistently pressed the
 radical viewpoint on the subject of party building.
 Over the past year, for example, the response of
 Shanghai's Wen Hui Pao (presumably under Yao's
 direction) to Peking's stepped-up propaganda on
 rebuilding the party has strongly supported the
 claims of former radical Red Guard factionalists
 to new party membership and has criticized revo-
 lutionary committees elsewhere in China for
 absorbing too many conservative military men
 and former party and government cadres. In all of
 this maneuvering, Chang and Yao apparently have
 been the chief voices for radical groups seeking to
 find an institutional base of support in the re-
 constructed party apparatus.
 Special Report
 Less is known about the importance of the
 two remaining members of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion Group-Madame Lin, who is known as Yeh
 Ch'un, and Wang Tung-hsing. Yeh, like her senior
 counterpart Chiang Ch'ing, has acquired political
 importance by representing her husband in a
 working purge group, the People's Liberation
 Army/Cultural Revolution Group. She has proved
 to be a fanatic and has a record of attacking
 prominent military men. Today Yeh still serves
 on the key army political policy body known as
 the "administrative unit" of the Military Affairs
 Committee, where she presumably serves as a
 radical watchdog over her more conservatively
 oriented military colleagues.
 Wang Tung-hsing, Mao's old bodyguard, also
 gained prominence as a member of an important
 purge group. After the eleventh plenum in August
 1966, he was assigned to take charge of the cen-
 tral committee's General Office, and in this office
 he played an important role in the continuing
 purge within the party. Today Wang remains one
 of the more shadowy figures of the elite, appar-
 ently owing his position almost exclusively to
 Mao's patronage. Nevertheless, because of Wang's
 long background in police and security work, he
 may he regarded as a dangerous opponent by the
 conservative elements in the politburo.
 All of the members of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion Group may be in a weak position under any
 kind of post-Mao regime. Their most formidable
 opponents presumably continue to be those
 military men in the center and the provinces
 whose efforts to maintain order have been repeat-
 edly impaired by radical initiatives. Once Mao
 goes, the radicals' power will diminish unless they
 somehow manage to build up new sources of
 strength in the local government structure and in
 a newly reconstructed party apparatus.

 and to modify the impact of radical-inspired
 social and political programs. By and large this
 basic conservatism seems to characterize most of
 the military leaders on the new  politburo
 -including some who owe their rise in large part
 directly to the Cultural Revolution-with the
 result that they appear to constitute a formidable
 opposition on many policy issues to the radical
 forces in the leadership. This divergence of
 approach to China's problems is compounded by
 the fact that many of the military leaders suffered
 under severe, radical-inspired attacks in the Cul-
 tural Revolution, which no doubt generated much
 bitterness and anxiety on their part.
 Six of the nine central and provincial mili-
 tary leaders came under heavy pressure from
 radical forces. These are Huang Yung-sheng, Ch'iu
 Hui-tso, Hsu Shih-yu, Ch'en Hsi-lien, Li Te-sheng,
 and Yeh Chien-ying. Huang Yung-sheng is chief of.
 the army General Staff, which maces him China's
 second most important military man behind Lin
 Piao. Huang got into deep political trouble in
 1967 when, as commander of the Canton Military
 Region, he cracked down heavily on Red Guard
 extremists in his area who were backed by Chiang
 Ch'ing and the Cultural Revolution Group. Be-
 cause of his action Huang came under sustained
 radical attack, but he was publicly defended by
 Chou En-lai.
 Huang may have further incurred the enmity
 of radical forces after the Wuhan incident in
 1967. That incident was precipitated when the
 Wuhan Military Region commander defied
 Peking's order to cease suppressing a radical Red
 Guard faction that was opposing his authority in
 the region. The commander was promptly dis-
 missed, but his action constituted a major turning
 point in the Cultural Revolution Group's effort to
 overcome resistance within the military to their
 radical measures. Huang Yung-sheng appears to
 have played a leading role in a group of regional

 In some respects, alternate politburo mem-
 ber Chi Teng-k'uei, a vice chairman of the Honan
 Provincial Revolutionary Committee, seems to
 represent at the highest level the kind of govern-
 ment official the Cultural Revolution Group lead-
 ers are backing in the provinces. Little is known
 about Chi except that he supported radical forces
 in his province throughout the Cultural Revolu-
 tion. Presumably through the efforts of stra-
 tegically placed supporters such as Chi in Honan
 and elsewhere, the radicals also hope to influence
 the make-up of the local party organs in their
 favor. Eventually, they may hope to use the
 rebuilt party apparatus as a counterweight to
 their opponents in the military, but at this stage
 their chances of long-term success seem slim.
 Despite the importance of the Cultural
 Revolution Group and its patrons in the standing
 committee, the pivotal role in China's power
 structure today is played by the People's Libera-
 tion Army leaders in the politburo, whose ranks
 include more members than ever before from
 both the central and regional military establish-
 ments. Because the army has become a major
 power center during the Cultural Revolution, the
 support of this military grouping will be crucial to
 any successor, to Mao. Although it may be
 assumed that most of these leaders currently
 remain loyal to Mao, they do not constitute a
 homogeneous body and their future loyalties
 remain one of the great uncertainties of the post-
 Mao era.
 In general terms, the army has exhibited
 some of the same divisive tendencies that have
 ruptured the party and government. There has
 been abundant evidence during the Cultural
 Revolution, however, that the great majority of
 the leading officers are basically conservative; i.e.,
 they have attempted to curb excessive disorders

 military leaders most of whom appeared in Peking
 in late July, where they seem to have joined Chou
 En-lai in exerting some braking influence on the
 radicals' drive to "drag out" their opponents in
 the military establishment.
 Huang was one of several regional com-
 manders who remained in the capital during the
 following four months-where they probably had
 the opportunity to speak on behalf of their col-
 leagues in the provinces. Lin Piao, in a tough
 speech to regional army leaders, emphasized the
 necessity for the disruptions associated with the
 Cultural Revolution and stressed repeatedly that
 local officers must seek instruction and guidance
 from Peking before taking action regarding Red
 Guard factions. Very soon after Lin's speech,
 however, both he and Mao began to retreat from
 their tough stance.
 Huang's role as a spokesman for the regional
 military establishment in the aftermath of the
 Wuhan incident appears to have strengthened his
 position. His new importance was confirmed
 when he was appointed chairman of the Kwang-
 tung Provincial Revolutionary Committee in early
 1968, shortly before his transfer to Peking as
 Chief of Staff of the army. The circumstances in
 which Huang was elevated to the top of the
 military command structure appear to lend addi-
 tional support to the notion that he is the leading
 representative of conservative military interests.
 The trials and tribulations of Hsu Shih-yu
 and Ch'en Hsi-lien in the Cultural Revolution
 closely paralleled those of Huang Yung-sheng, and
 their experiences suggest that they share Huang's
 conservative bias and his presumed opposition to
 the radical forces. Hsu is the Commander of the
 Nanking Military Region and Ch'en is Com-
 mander of the Shenyang Military Region. Both
 Hsu and Ch'en survived sustained Red Guard
 criticism to retain their regional commands, and
 Special Report
 both were able to enhance their political status by
 acquiring provincial revolutionary committee
 chairmanships. Their presence on the politburo as
 spokesmen for the Interests of regional and pro-
 vincial army leaders attests to Peking's-and
 Mao's-recognition of the new power relation-
 ships emerging out of the Cultural Revolution.
 Because both men are long-time professional
 soldiers, it also seems likely that they serve as
 spokesmen for those who appear to have been
 arguing in recent months that renewed attention
 must be paid to improving military readiness after
 the disruptions of the Cultural Revolution, with
 some corresponding easing of the loi -level local
 administrative and political burdens the army still
 has to bear.
 The remaining military members on the
 politburo who may share some similarity of views
 with Huang, Hsu, and Ch'en are Li Te-sheng and
 probably, Ch'iu Hui-tso. Relatively little is known
 about Li except that he is commander of the 12th
 army and, concurrently, chairman of the Anhwei
 Provincial Revolutionary Committee. He is a mil-
 itary subordinate to Hsu Shih-yu and, like Hsu,
 appears to be a representative of the powerful
 provincial military figures who administer much
 of China. It should be noted, however, that Li is
 just one of a number of tactical officers who are
 now running entire provinces. It remains to be
 seen why Li was selected over his peers to be
 elevated to his present status. His sudden rise
 suggests that he may enjoy some special relation-
 ship with other powerful figures in Peking above
 and beyond Hsu Shih-yu.
 Ch'iu Hui-tso is a representative of the cen-
 tral military hierarchy. He is a long-time associate
 of Lin Piao and was allegedly moved into his
 General Rear Services Department post by Lin to
 root out remnants of the "anti-Mao, P'eng
 Te-huai clique." Ch'iu's record in the Cultural
 Revolution, however, suggests that he may have

 played an important role in attempting to blunt
 the radical attack on the military establishment.
 Ch'iu was severely criticized by radical Red
 Guards in late 1966 and early 1967. Moreover,
 after he was exonerated, he was named to the
 army's Cultural Revolution Group in the wake of
 the Wuhan incident at a time when the more
 conservative voices in the army successfully
 sought an end to the radical activities of that
 army purge group.
 The rest of the military men on the polit-
 buro appear to be at the opposite end of the
 spectrum and seem to owe their positions to their
 readiness to support the aims of the radical forces
 in the leadership. Wu Fa-hsien has been com-
 mander of the Air Force since August 1965, and
 before that he served as Air Force political com-
 missar since at least 1959. Wu played a major role
 in the purges within the military establishment
 and was head of the People's Liberation Army/
 Cultural Revolution Group after August 1967.
 Air Force units have sided with radical
 forces in several places during the Cultural Revo-
 lution, presumably on Wu's orders. Wu was also
 one of the top leaders present when Chiang
 Ch'ing delivered her inflammatory "stagnant
 pools" speech on 12 November 1967, which had
 such a strong influence in breaking down the
 short-lived period of political sanity in the fall of
 1967. All others present on that occasion are
 clearly identified as radicals. It seems probable,
 therefore, that Wu Fa-hsien's long career as a
 political commissar and his seeming lack of com-
 mand experience have predisposed him to support
 radical political initiatives and that, at the least,
 he has proved ready to accommodate to programs
 being pushed by the Cultural Revolution Group
 leaders in Peking.
 Little is known about the political com-
 missar of the Navy, Li Tso-p'eng, but his experi-
 Special Report
 ence in the Cultural Revolution suggests that he
 also belongs to the radically oriented wing of the
 central military. Li, for example, served as deputy
 head of the Navy's Cultural Revolution purge
 group and played a prominent part in purges of
 the People's Liberation Army in general. Further-
 more, as was the case with the Air Force under
 Wu, in province after province the Navy lined up
 behind the radical forces in their attacks on senior
 Army leaders,
 By siding with the radicals in attacking
 senior Army officers, Wu and Li have not only
 enhanced their own positions but have achieved
 some increase in the number of provincial govern-
 ment posts held by Air Force and Navy officers.
 Presumably both leaders will support any future
 moves by the Cultural Revolution Group to
 utrengthen its position vis-a-vis the Army leaders
 on the politburo. The fact that Wu and Li only
 +,,epresent the junior branches of China's Army
 forces, however, suggests that they will not bring
 decisive strength to bear on the radicals' behalf in
 any political showdown in the post-Mao period,
 THE GOVERNMENT LEADERS
 The position of the radical forces in the
 politburo seems to be further circumscribed by
 the fact that the major representatives of the
 civilian government apparatus appear to be
 aligned with the moderate camp. Both Vice
 Premier Hsieh Fu-chih and Finance Minister Li
 Hsien-nien have been supporters of Chou En-lai
 and are on record as attempting to curb Cultural
 Revolution excesses. Hsieh Fu-chih has been one
 of the busiest officials in the regime in most
 periods of the Cultural Revolution. When it be-
 gan, Hsieh was vice premier and minister of public
 security. Since 1967 he has been chairman of the
 Peking Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and
 he now also serves on the "administrative unit" of
 the Military Affairs Committee. The very fact

 CHOU EN-LAI AND THE GOVERNMENT LEADERS
 that he has been so busy in so many sectors of
 authority makes Hsieh somewhat difficult to
 pigeonhole in terms of political affinities. His
 ability to pass relatively unscathed through
 periods of radical ascendancy in 1967 and again
 in 1968 suggests that at crucial junctures he was
 willing to make accommodations to the Cultural
 Revolution Group members of the elite.
 Nevertheless, it appears that Hsieh belongs
 basically to the loose coalition of moderate
 bureaucrats and army officers. He has suggested
 as much by word and deed at several key junc-
 tures, such as the period of moderation beginning
 in July 1968 when Hsieh was one of the first to
 take advantage of Mao's call for an end to fac-
 tional violence. During the period from Septem-
 ber 1967 to mid-February 1968, moreover, Hsieh
 delivered half a dozen major speeches that pushed
 a whole- range of moderate policies, including the
 need to form revolutionary committees, to sup-
 port the Army, to promote birth control, and to
 end the disruptive activities of Red Guard mili-
 tants.
 There is less uncertainty about the political
 affinities of Li Hsien-nien. He has worked closely
 with Chou En-lai at the top of the State Council
 hierarchy since the mid-1950s. Although Li
 occupied a precarious post in a ministry notable
 for its political casualties, his talents, and more
 importantly, the protection of Chou En-lai,
 enabled him to survive the Cultural Revolution.
 I i has long experience as a skilled organizer and
 administrator and since at least the disestroi's
 Great Leap Forward period, it has been clear that
 he has taken a relatively moderate position as an
 economic planner.
 With the Cultural Revolution downgrading
 of Li Fu-ch'un, former politburo member and
 chairman of the State Planning Commission, Li
 now becomes the most important economic
 spokesman in China. Since the ninth party con-
 gress, evidence also has been accumulating that
 Peking has settled on Li as de facto foreign minis-
 ter and probable successor to the downgraded
 Ch'en I. Although Li himself is no stranger to
 foreign policy matters, his assumption of some of
 the foreign minister's duties is primarily signifi-
 cant because it appears to ensure that his pro-
 tector Chou En-lai will continue to exercise direct
 influence over the conduct of Peking's interna-
 tional relations.

 AFTER MAO, THE DELUGE?
 SECRET
 China's leaders toward the view that, both for
 China's sake and for their own self-preservation,
 Mac, ought to be restrained in the future.
 Although China's present elite tends to be
 divided into mutually antagonistic groupings, the
 complicated ground rules of politics as played in
 Peking preclude a definitive assessment of the
 leadership situation. At present, the relative posi-
 tions and influence of the radicals, i.e., those
 most active in the excesses of the Cultural Revo-
 lution, and the moderates, i.e., primarily the
 military-administrator groups, still seem to he in
 flux. The picture is further clouded because the
 various leaders can by no means be identified
 with a set pattern of factions possessing carefully
 formulated political programs. As in the past, it
 can be assumed that some individuals who appear
 aligned at one time with one group, will switch
 allegiance whenever they perceive this would
 serve their self-interest, and accordingly they will
 make personal and policy accommodations with
 leaders of different political persuasions. More-
 over, interrelationships within the elite are
 complicated by the consciousness that Mao might
 at any time attempt to strike them down should
 they oppose him too directly, and, conversely, by
 the knowledge that overidentification with Mao's
 more radical policies may prove a liability when
 he is no longer a living shield.
 Under these conditions, it will continue to
 be extremely hard for the politburo to formulate
 coherent policies on which all elements can agree.
 Although certain pressing domestic issues, such as
 the need to maintain law and order, and such
 foreign issues as the need to respond to Soviet
 pressures, have elicited some positive responses
 from the leadership, the present uneasy balance in
 the politburo is likely to preclude bold moves in
 any direction. Mao will certainly fight to avoid
 being put on the shelf as he felt he was following
 the Great Leap Forward fiasco of 1958-1960. By
 the same token, the excesses of the Cultural
 Revolution probably have encouraged some of
 Special Report
 Assuming that the same factors of power,
 policy, and personal rivalries will continue to
 operate while Mao remains at the helm, the result
 of his passing is likely to be even less cohesive at
 the top, and the succession could well be dis-
 orderly and contentious, The purge of his first
 heir apparent, Liu Shao-ch'i, aborted the Chinese
 Communists' initial attempt to provide for the
 orderly transfer of political power, and Mao's
 efforts to groom Lin Piao as successor seem a
 less-than-satisfactory solution to the problem.
 Partly because of his poor health and partly be-
 cause of his close identification with the excesses
 of the Cultural Revolution, Lin does not appear
 credible as anything more than a short-term re-
 placement.
 Because Lin has received a clear mandate, he
 probably will initially get the post of party chair-
 man. It is also true that Mao and Lin have been
 industriously attempting to build a structure-
 both party and military -designed to be respon-
 sive to Lin. Lin, however, does not possess any-
 thing like Mao's charisma, and though most key
 power positions in China's governing structure
 today are held by military men, their fortunes
 during the Cultural Revolution suggest that many
 of them may not be entirely politically responsive
 to Lin.
 The policies that Lin attempts to pursue will
 also have a crucial bearing on his prospects for
 consolidating his position. To a large extent, Lin
 must be considered an enigma, who, because he
 has operated for almost 40 years in Mao's
 shadow, cannot really be known until the shadow
 is removed. In view of Lin's record in the Cultural
 Revolution, it seems likely that his basic predilec-
 tion would be to carry on along the policy lines

 laid down by Mao. Should he attempt to do so,
 however, he will probably have to defer much
 more to the wishes of others than Mao has done.
 Moreover, it is not clear whether Lin Piao, once
 Mao is gone, will be able to formulate programs
 needed to manage the vast Chinese nation.
 If Lin hopes to consolidate and hold his
 position, he would have to secure the collabora-
 tion or at least the acquiescence of the conserva-
 tive-oriented military powerholders as well as the
 government bureaucrats led by Chou En-lai, with-
 out whom he could not successfully rule the
 country. This should entail some modification of
 Maoist policies. An alternative to this would be
 for Lin to remove swiftly potential opposition
 and to launch his own version of the Cultural
 Revolution, a venture unlikely to succc?d. Should
 Lin in fact persist in playing the role of an unre-
 constructed Maoist in all fields, it seems likely
 that he would be shunted aside by some combina-
 tion of military, party, and government leaders.
 In any event, with Mao's death or inca
 pacity, the chances of an open split in the leader-
 ship will rise sharply. A stormy and possibly pro-
 tracted period may ensue in which basic policy
 issues will fuel a sharp leadership struggle. The
 process of the Cultural Revolution has already
 resulted in some diffusion of power at the center,
 and in the future, provincial leaders are likely to
 play a more important role in the over-all political
 picture. Political links with strong regional figures
 could become increasingly important to com-
 peting personalities at the center, and ambitious
 regional leaders may increasingly find opportuni-
 ties to use their local power as an important
 springboard to eminence at the top.
 As long as Mao remains on the scene, it is
 possible that he will attempt to give renewed
 forward momentum to his drive to revive revolu-
 tionary enthusiasm. But it apparently is already
 clear to powerful elements in the leadership that
 much of his revolutionary dogma has proved irrel-
 evant to China's problems in the modern world.
 Although China's future course cannot be pre-
 dicted with confidence, it is possible that, in the
 wake of Mao's passing, Communist China's lead-
 ers-whoever they are-will be forced increasingly
 to respond to changing conditions and to pres-
 sures from men whose drive is toward greater
 rationalization of the economy and political appa-
 ratus-or at least toward the orderly pursuit of a
 more pragmatic version of Mao's romantic vision.
