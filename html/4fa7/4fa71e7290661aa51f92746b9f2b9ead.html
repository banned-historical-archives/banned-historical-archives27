 WORLD REACTION TO SUMMIT BREAKDOWN
 19 May 1960
 I.   Soviet Propaganda
 1.   During the first week following Khrushchev's disclosure
 on 5 May that a US reconnaissance plane was shot down over USSR
 territory, the USSR was cautious and restrained in its exploita-
 tion of the incident.   Soviet  propagandists gave it comparative-
 ly moderate publicity and followed the lines of Khrushchev's two
 speeches before the Supreme Soviet. However, after the 11 May
 opening of the exhibition of the wreckage and "evidence" of US
 espionage at which Gromyko and Khrushchev ridiculed the US state-
 ments on the affair, the volume of Soviet propaganda denunciations
 of the US policy of "provocation" and "treachery" increased.  At-
 tacks on Secretary Herter and "US ruling circles" and "warmongers"
 became sharper, but propagandists still avoided personal attacks
 on President Eisenhower.   The press treatment of Khrushchev's
 statements at his impromptu press conference on 11 May indicate a
 Soviet effort to tone down the impact of some of his harsh off-
 the-cuff remarks, and seemed to reflect a desire to forestall the
 conclusion that there had been any shift in his attitude toward
 the Summit.  After a delay of almost 24 hours TASS issued a revised
 version of Khrushchev's statements which clearly softened his ref-
 erences to the President and gave a more optimistic assessment
 of future Soviet-US relations,
 2.   Mass meetings solely to protest the US espionage flight
 started on 13 May.   (Previously, mass meetings to discuss the

 materials of the Supreme Soviet, including the statements on
 the U-2 incident, were held from 6 to 11 May.)  By 14 May the
 plane incident dominated the Moscow press, and personal criti-
 cism of President Eisenhower and attacks on Secretary Herter were
 intensified.
 3.   Nevertheless, on the eve of the Summit talks,  Soviet com-
 mentators continued to stress Khrushchev's statement that he would
 still go to Paris "with a pure heart" but to insist that the out-
 come of the conference would depend largely on the attitude of the
 West, particularly the United States.   Pravda's correspondent in
 Paris asserted that "there can be no question of easing interna-
 tional tension" as long as Western policy continues to be in-
 fluenced by the "aggressive militarist quarters" in the United
 States.
 4.   There is considerable evidence that the USSR's propaganda
 apparatus had no forewarning of Khrushchev's intended moves in
 Paris and was forced to reverse prepared stories on the Summit.
 Three hours after Khrushchev's statement in Paris on 16 May, TASS
 instructed the Soviet regional press not to publish any despatches
 on the Summit it had transmitted earlier that day and sent re-
 visions strongly condemning US actions.
 5.   Massive Soviet jamming of VOA's transmissions in the
 languages of the USSR was resumed on or about 17 May.   This fol-
 lowed the selective jamming of VOA's output on the plane incident
 during the previous week.   There was also selective jamming of

 BBC broadcasts to Russia during the past week, followed by
 more extensive interferences on 17 May.
 6.   Throughout this period and up until 17 May, studied
 caution had been particularly evident in output for Russian
 domestic consumption.   Despite cries of indignation against the
 US "provocation," Soviet domestic propaganda avoided pointing
 to the danger of accidental war as a result of such flights and
 did not stress "vigilance.'".  It  was made clear that the
 present situation is not a "crisis" situation and that "calmness"
 was the principal requisite.   The Russian people were assured that
 the USSR would continue its struggle for peace and told that Khru-
 shchev is an "incurable optimist" about the further relaxation
 of tensions.
 7.   Since the breaking off of the Summit meeting,  Soviet com-
 mentary has concentrated on "proving" that the United States tor-
 pedoed the summit.  As "proof," Pravda offered Secretary Herter's
 remarks to the US press in Paris and the US "fear" of another
 "preliminary meeting" on 17 May.   Izvestia asserted that the US
 refusal to condemn espionage flights and promise not to repeat
 them, "which wrecked the Summit," was only a link in a chain of
 US actions--such as the President's alleged "retraction," under
 pressure of the US monopolists, of the view that the Berlin situa-
 tion is abnormal and  Undersecretary Dillon's speech against a
 change in  Berlin's status.   After  initially ignoring Presi-
 dent Eisenhower's statement that there would be no further U-2

 w    flights, Soviet commentators followed Khrushchev's lead, dis-
 missing it as a mere "maneuver to avoid responsibility" and
 placing all emphasis on the fact that Khrushchev's full demands
 were not met.  All attacks are aimed at the United States, with
 the exception of passing criticism of Macmillan and De Gaulle
 for their alleged failure to persuade Eisenhower to condemn the
 flights.
 8. 'Subsidiary coverage has been devoted to reports alleg-
 ing worldwide support of the Soviet Union and condemnation of the
 United States and to protest meetings voicing "enthusiastic ap-
 proval" of Khrushchev and indignant denunciation of US leaders.
 However, the population generally continues friendly to US Em-
 bassy personnel and American tourists in Moscow.

 II.  Eastern European Propaganda
 1.  Eastern European propagandists apparently were unpre-
 pared for the sudden turn of events, with many of them preferring
 not to comment but merely to repeat TASS releases.   The few early
 attempts at independent comment, which reflected an underlying
 belief that the conference would somehow go on, were by those
 regimes we believe most opposed to the policy of detente with
 the West--Albania, Czechoslovakia and East Germany.
 2.  As the collapse of the conference became more apparent,
 all the satellites except Rumania began broadcasting independent
 comment which reflected a national, in addition to a bloc, point
 of view.  The East European bloc countries are unanimous--as
 might be expected--in support of Khrushchev.  All place the
 blame for the collapse of the conference on "Eisenhower's
 intransigence."  Most commentaries hint that future summit,
 disarmament and other, conferences are not only possible but
 also desirable, although the way in which such possibilities
 are handled varies from vituperation to probing attempts at
 reconciliation.  Satellite commentaries also link the successful
 flight of the new Soviet sputnik to the claims that the USSR is
 the most powerful state in the world, and that it is "high time"
 that US policy recognizes this fact and abandons its false "posi-
 tion-of-strength" in any future negotiations.  Reports of
 differences among the Western  big three  continue to be
 circulated.

 3.   The Albanians, Bulgarians, Czechs and Hungarians have
 unleashed the most vicious attacks, reminiscent of the Stalinist
 era.  The first two regimes have broadcast highly vituperative
 condemnations of US "imperialist aggressions" and report numerous
 worker demonstrations supporting Khrushchev.   In the meantime
 Czechoslovakia protested Secretary Herter's references to the
 1948 take-over in his 9 May speech, and called this statement
 evidence of a "two-faced" policy in Washington, which they in-
 ferred was just as unacceptable to Prague as it was to Khrushchev.
 Budapest mixed a vitriolic attack on President Eisenhower and on
 both John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles with the comment that
 summit conferences are still the most "efficient means of settling
 international disputes"  and are "more fruitful than routine diplo-
 matic exchanges."  The broadcast concluded, however, with the
 statement that so long as the President must "subordinate his own
 ideas" to "US reactionary circles" and must adhere "to the absurd...
 principle of 'freedom of espionage'," there can be little hope
 for progress.
 4.  East Germany immediately resorted to threats against
 continued Western occupation of Berlin, but later statements by
 middle-level GDR officials were intended to suggest that there
 would be no action on this problem, or that of a separate peace
 treaty with East Germany, until after "negotiations" had failed.
 The East German party paper editorially stated on 18 May that
 the GDR "will not wait indefinitely for a treaty" and that "the
 international balance of power is such that the imperialists

 are no longer in a position to delay... indefinitely."  Chancellor
 +rr
 Adenauer and President Eisenhower have been consistently linked
 together as the two men most responsible for the failure at the
 Summit.
 5.  Polish press comments have been generally moderate, and have
 stressed that even though the US bears responsibility for "torpedo-
 ing the Summit," Poland will "not change its basic policy of seeking
 international detente," and Polish "faith in the possibility of
 peaceful coexistence" cannot be shaken.   The Poles have stressed
 their "complete and unreserved" support for Khrushchev in all
 comments on the events in Paris.  Belgrade has continued its
 neutral pose, broadcasting full coverage of Eastern and Western
 comments, but the programming indicates  a leaning toward.Khrushchev.
 For instance, reports of worker demonstrations in support of
 Khrushchev from TANJUG correspondents in the USSR have been followed
 by broadcasts from London rounding up condemnations of US "spy
 f lights"in British papers.  On 14 May a senior Foreign Office
 official in Belgrade stated that in the event of a failure in
 Paris, Yugoslavia would probably support the USSR and sign a
 separate peace treaty with East Germany.

 III.  Communist Far East
 1.   Peiping's first major comment on the Summit breakdown--
 a statement by Premier Chou En-lai on 19 May--places the Chinese
 Communists squarely in line with the rest of the bloc in support-
 ing Khrushchev and in condemning US "imperialism."  Chou stated
 that Peiping "firmly supports" the measures taken by the USSR at
 the Summit and warned the US government not to mistake Communist
 efforts for peace as "signs of weakness."  Chou continued:   "En-
 croachment on any socialist country is an encroachment on China,
 on the entire socialist camp, and will assuredly meet with an an-
 nihilating rebuff."   In closing his remarks, he stressed that
 "the 650 million Chinese people will continue to unite closely
 with the great Soviet people, the peoples of all the socialist
 countries, and all the peace-loving people of the whole world,
 and work persistently and untiringly for the relaxation of in-
 ternational tension and a lasting world peace."
 2.  Although Chou did not indulge in the "I told you so"
 attitude which was apparent in some earlier lower-level comment,
 politburo member Peng Chen used this line at a rally in Peiping
 on 19 May.   Peng said that the U-2 incident showed that President
 Eisenhower was "not a peace envoy but a warmonger" and proved to
 the world that "no illusions should be held about the real nature
 of US imperialism."  A few days before the Summit, Mao Tse-tung
 had implicitly criticized Khrushchev for being one of those people

 who held such illusions.   However, the Chinese Communists
 probably feel that Khrushchev's actions in Paris were so in
 line with Peiping's own attitude toward the West that they can
 now wholeheartedly endorse Soviet policy.   Chinese leaders
 did not feel they could do so when there was still some chance
 that the Summit conference would result in agreements which might
 undercut their policy in the Far East and in underdeveloped areas
 where Peiping is active.
 3.   Because of the time lag customary in the response of
 Asian satellite capitals, material presently available is limited
 to commentary on Khrushchev's remarks at the opening session of
 the conference on 16 May.  However, North Vietnam, North Korea,
 and Mongolia have all resoundingly endorsed Khrushchev's position.
 Hanoi's official party organ Nhan Dan on 18 May termed the Soviet
 stand "understandable and necessary" and asserted "peaceful ne-
 gotiations cannot be conducted with those who continue to prepare
 aggressive wars."  The press and radio in Pyongyang and Ulan
 Bator reiterate this line with little variation.

 IV.  Non-Communist Far East
 1.   In general, the Japanese, Koreans and Nationalist
 Chinese blamed Khrushchev for the breakdown of the Summit
 conference, although some Japanese newspapers ascribed a share
 of the blame to the US because of the U-2 incident.   The
 Nationalists were relieved that the conference was ended
 and want a more aggressive policy toward the bloc; the
 Koreans want strengthened defenses, while the Japanese hope
 that efforts to solve the impasse will result in a new summit
 meeting in the near future.
 2.  In Japan, official and editorial comment tended to
 lay blame for the breakdown of the Summit talks squarely on
 Khrushchev; there was general agreement that his behavior was
 entirely unwarranted.  Some major newspapers, however, attributed
 a share of the blame to the US because of the U-2 incident.
 Prime Minister Kishi expressed "deep regret" over rupture of
 the talks.  Foreign Minister Fujiyama stated that Khrushchev
 used the U-2 incident as an excuse to hide his belief that
 there is no prospect of agreement on the German problem.   The
 chairman of the left-wing Socialist party termed Khrushchev's
 action "highly regrettable" but said he understood the reason.
 The feeling is unanimous that the short-term result will be a
 resumption of cold war tensions, but most Japanese comments
 expressed hope that efforts would be made to solve present
 differences at a new summit meeting in the near future.

 3.  Following the plane incident, the Japanese government
 had been on the defensive in attempting to secure ratification
 of the new US-Japanese security treaty.  However, possibly
 hoping to capitalize on Japanese criticism of Khrushchev and
 the threat of a revived cold war, the government moved suddenly
 late on 19 May to-force a vote on the treaty in the lower house
 of the Diet over a combination brawl and boycott staged by the
 opposition Socialists.  Although successful on the vote, the
 government possibly has exposed itself to public charges that
 its methods are dictatorial.
 4.  South Korean reaction has unanimously blamed Khrushchev
 for the failure of the Summit meeting.  The semi-official
 Korean Republic, along with other papers, asserted that the
 free world must now unite and not be intimidated into conces-
 sions, but rather strengthen its defenses.  Regarding the U-2
 incident, a Foreign Ministry announcement reflected the United
 States position that such flights are made necessary by Soviet
 secrecy and linked the situation to the Communist sneak attack
 on South Korea in 1950.
 5.  Nationalist Chinese officials, apprehensive that the US
 would make an agreement in Paris detrimental to their interests,
 are relieved that the Summit conference has collapsed.   They
 believe that Khrushchev "sabotaged" the conference and that
 even without the U-2 incident, he would have found another pre-
 text for breaking up the meeting.  They are worried, however,

 that the US will weaken in the face of Soviet threats and are
 using the incident to call for a more aggressive policy toward
 the bloc.
 6.  The non-communist Hong Kong press has initially attributed
 the collapse of the Summit meeting to the Soviet Union.   The
 British China Mail accused Khrushchev of sabotaging the Summit
 and spoke of his "display of petulant self-righteousness...
 intransigence and vindictiveness."  Earlier some papers labeled
 the U-2 incident a propaganda victory for the Soviets and asserted
 that the US had walked into a Soviet trap.  The pro-Chinese
 Nationalist English language Hong Kong Tiger Standard suggested
 that Khrushchev's behavior at the Summit was due to domestic
 rather than international reasons.  However, the British South
 China Morning Post called the U-2 flight a "stupid enterprise"
 made without top-level knowledge or authority, "an example of
 provocative brinkmanship far more dangerous than anything at-
 tempted diplomatically by Mr. Foster Dulles."  The local
 Communist press reflected Peiping's attacks on the US.

 V.    South and Southeast Asia
 1.   official reaction in Southeast Asia to the breakup of
 the Paris Qonference so far has been limited.               The earliest
 theme in widespread press commentary--distress over the setback
 to hopes of world peace--has given way to almost universal con-
 demnation of Khrushchev's tactics at Paris.
 2.   Indonesian, Australian and Philippine government of-
 ficials have commented publicly to date.   In Djakarta, on 18 May,
 Acting Foreign Minister Leimena expressed regret at the breakup
 of the Summit, and stated that under the circumstances,  "we should
 not blame either side."  He urged that efforts be made for another
 heads of government meeting, possibly under UN auspices.   In Can-
 berra, in parliament sessions of 18 and 19 May, both government
 and opposition parties unanimously supported acting Prime Minister
 McEwen's position that Khrushchev, not the West, was responsible
 for the collapse.   In London, on 18 May, Prime Minister Menzies
 said "the wQrld's.ordinary, sensible and honest persons regard
 the Russian maneuvers with contempt."  Philippine Foreign Minister
 Serrano stated in New York on 18 May that he believed Premier
 Khrushchev had committed a diplomatic blunder in torpedoing the
 conference and called his behavior "inexcusable."
 3.  Throughout the developing crisis since the U-2 incident,
 the Southeast Asian press has shown itself to be both thoughtful
 and responsible.  With-the exception of the Communist press, al-
 most all accounts                have  been sympathetic to the United States'

 position; although initially there had been considerable criti-
 cism of United States handling of the plane incident..  Follow-
 ing Khrushchev's extreme accusations and intransigence at Paris,
 Southeast Asian criticism of Khrushchev has mounted rapidly.
 Editorials published in Bangkok, Rangoon, Kuala Lumpur,  Singapore
 and Djakarta all place the onus for the meeting's failure direct-
 ly at Khrushchev's door.
 4.   Reaction in South Asia generally has also been a good
 deal more hardheaded than on similar occasions in the past.  The
 Indian press, indignant over the Summit breakdown, has been
 virtually unanimous in holding Khrushchev responsible.  While
 consistently critical of American U-2 operations,  Indian papers
 agreed that Khrushchev was not justified in using  them to "make a
 shambles" of the conference.  Nehru's first comments were more
 cautious.  He carefully refrained from pinning the blame for the
 "fiasco" on either side, noting only that it was "certainly due
 to lack of good will."  Nehru similarly refused to condemn the
 U-2 incident, pleading lack of information.  Although he pointed
 out that "one does not push his nose into everything," Nehru's
 comment on possible mediation suggested that he would at least
 urge moderation on both parties.
 5.   Pakistan has lodged a mild protest against the flight,
 but Ayub has made it clear where his sympathies lie:   "Today the
 Free World must live under an umbrella of American nuclear deter-
 rent."  Afghanistan's formal protest was far stronger, but

 VI.  Africa
 1.   In the independent nations of Africa, the reaction
 to the failure of the Summit conference and the period of tension
 preceding the meeting has stressed the danger to world peace,
 especially for the smaller uncommitted nations of the world, but
 has avoided strong condemnation of either party.  Generally the
 United States has been criticized for its intelligence activities
 on the eve of the Summit; the USSR has been rebuked for its in-
 transigent attitude and insistence on an unrealistic apology.
 2.   The Tunisian attitude was reflected in the government
 party's press, which stated that the US could not comply with
 the Soviet demand for an apology, even though the plane incident
 cast doubt on American intentions and desire to preserve the
 peace.  According to the independent press, nearly all political
 observers attributed the failure of the conference to the stiff
 attitude taken by Khrushchev.  Earlier, in relation to the plane
 incident, President Bourguiba was extremely complimentary to
 Secretary Herter for a "courageous and master stroke" in handling
 the matter publicly.
 3.  Morocco has not reacted officially.  Prior to the Summit
 meeting, news agency dispatches tended to stress Soviet state-
 ments, but the press did not take sides.  The statements
 concluded that US prestige had suffered more than its reputa-
 tion for wanting peace.

 4.   The Ethiopian press, unofficial but subject to
 control, maintained a balanced position prior to the Summit
 breakdown and saw in the espionage activities of both nations
 proof that immediate disarmament was needed if the world were
 to avoid hostilities.   The press commented that Khrushchev, in
 adopting an innocent attitude, would be saying in effect, "forget
 my past because my future is so spotless."
 AW              5.   The government-controlled Ghana press editorialized
 against the danger of recklessness on the part of either govern-
 ment which could threaten mankind--both the "folly of US flying
 spy planes over Russian territory" and "the trump card hilarity
 of the Soviet Union in crude espionage and sabotage charges
 against the American government."  Prime Minister Nkrumah,
 defending the interests of small nations, opposes settlement
 of the world's problems by the "big four" alone.
 6.  Reaction in the remainder of the continent has not
 been reported.

 VII.    Middle East
 1.   Reactions vary widely among the Arab states.   The com-
 mon denominator is bitter disappointment over the Summit break-
 down and fear of extreme international tension to come.
 2.   Cairo press and radio blame both sides for the Summit
 failure.     They are concerned that Khrushchev might throw another
 bombshell by signing a separate peace treaty with East Germany
 very soon.   Nasir, busy with the final session in his talks with
 Nehru, has as yet made no direct comment.   The UAR press has
 contrasted the Summit fiasco with the Nasir-Nehru "peace-promoting
 discussions" and stressed the need for "nations of positive neu-
 trality" to play a bigger role in world affairs.
 3.   Israeli officials and press have strongly backed the
 Western stand, seeing no justification for Khrushchev's "tor-
 pedoing" of the conference.
 4.   Jordan's foreign minister, expressing admiration for
 Eisenhower's candor on the U-2 incident, said he had been sure--
 but wrong--that Khrushchev would have accepted the President's
 "transparent honesty" and closed the matter.  Jordanian news-
 papers, a number of which receive small British subsidies, have
 sided emphatically with the West.
 5.   Press reaction in Lebanon has typically ranged all
 over the spectrum:  One paper, for example, speaks of "another in
 the series of American blunders"; one blames the Soviet military
 for forcing Khrushchev's hand.

 6.   The pro-Communist press in Iraq holds US "imperialist
 provocations" entirely responsible for the frustration of "the
 high hopes of humanity."  The Iraqi nationalist press pointed out
 that the U-2 incident showed the need for reaching a settlement
 and warned the leftist papers against "propagating for the Com-
 munist camp."
 7.   Turkish and Iranian comment has been favorable to the
 United States, although Turkish reaction has been limited by the
 need of   political  leaders  and of the press to concentrate on
 domestic problems.
 The Turkish press gave the U-2
 story rather superficial treatment but reacted with surprise
 and irritation to the collapse of the Summit talks.   Khrushchev
 was denounced for sabotaging the conference and no sympathy for  the
 USSR!s   action in demanding a US apology was shown.

 incident indicates that the US "has not been sleeping" re-
 garding the USSR and that US prestige in the intelligence field
 has risen considerably.   The newspaper Etelaat, which usually re-
 flects the viewpoint of the Iranian government, blames the break-
 up of the Summit Conference on the USSR.   No reaction has yet
 been received from the Shah.

 19 May 1960
 VIII.  Western Europe
 1.   The feeling is strong among diplomats, newspapermen,
 and assembly deputies in France and in the general public that
 Khrushchev has overplayed his hand.  Khrushchev
 has largely destroyed the image he built dur-
 ing his March-April state visit and is now widely referred to as
 a fool and a buffoon.   The belief is strong that the three Western
 leaders did everything possible to salvage the Summit, and that
 greater allied unity is necessary.  While the ultimate blame for
 the Summit failure is laid to Khrushchev, the US is not exonerated.
 The-chief editor of the influential Le Monde said on 18 May that
 Khrushchev cannot be blamed for taking advantage of such a
 "beautiful occasion" and of the 'tconfused" US statements follow-
 ing, but Khrushchev far overplayed his hand in presenting his
 ultimatum to Eisenhower.  He added that the failure of the
 conference may call the leadership of American diplomacy in the
 West into question.  The most recurrent press theme on Khrushchev's
 motivation is that he decided to break off when he could find no
 breach in Western unity.  Earlier, Khrushchev's tactics had been
 attributed more to domestic (army) pressures and to Soviet bloc
 (principally Peiping) pressures.   The French press is almost
 unanimous that the Summit failure brings a return of the cold
 war, but believes that it is unlikely to "go much further."
 Fears are, however, evident in the calls for renewed allied
 unity.

 A few typical quotes:
 Paris-Jour (Mass-circulation sensationalist type):
 ""Twelve days ago, on May 5, addressing the Supreme Soviet,
 Khrushchev suddenly and without forewarning stopped talking
 like Khrushchev.                On that day he became the spokesman of
 Mao Tse-tung... ""
 Le Figaro:   (Moderate):   "The torpedoing of the conference
 by Mr. Khrushchev is a development over which no one in
 France will rejoice.  But if it contributes to tightening
 Western solidarity it will not be a totally bad thing."
 Humanite (Communist):   "The policy of peaceful coexistence
 is not in any way jeopardized."  (Failure of Summit is) "Only
 a dramatic vicissitude in the struggle for peace."  There
 will be other vicissitudes, but "an uncertain peace is
 better after all than war."
 Le Monde (Independent):   "If Khrushchev thinks everything
 will be better after the US elections, he has much to
 learn on how the US is really governed."
 2.   Italian Foreign Minister Segai
 underlined the need for allied solidarity.  Soviet belligerency
 might even be advantageous to the anti-Communist cause in Italy.
 On the unofficial level the non-Communist Italian press sees
 Khrushchev as having greatly inflated the U-2 incident, and as
 having overplayed his hand in the process.  Socialist Avanti

 ftr  also criticizes Khrushchev.  Various
 papers attribute Khrushchev's
 harshness to sheer bluff, or to a need to conciliate his own
 military people and the Chinese.   "Khrushchev wanted to prove
 to the tough Stalinists of Moscow that he was no softy," said
 independent Ii Giorno.   The free press in general has expressed
 concern at the increase of international tension, and stresses
 the need for maintaining allied solidarity.   Khrushchev is
 strongly criticized for his "premeditated" wrecking tactics.
 A rightist paper calls him "a working heir of Genghis Khan."
 Others compare him to Stalin.
 3.   The Bonn                      believes that Khrushchev
 went to Paris determined to wreck the conference and attributes
 his arrogant behavior either to belief in superior Soviet mili-
 tary strength, to some undisclosed weapon, or merely to his intent
 to impress and split the West through psychological tactics. West
 Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt
 is now convinced that the USSR
 will sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany.  Bundestag
 politicians in Bonn are reported "unruffled" over the Summit
 collapse, but note considerable uneasiness in the country at
 large, especially in Berlin.   They view "salami-tactics" of
 slicing away at Berlin as the greatest present danger and do
 not expect an East German peace treaty for perhaps several
 months.  Although critical of earlier stages of American
 handling of the U-2 incident, they approve US conduct at Paris.

 A Social Democratic foreign policy expert suggested that
 differences between West German parties on foreign policy
 would diminish in the face of the  tougher Soviet line.  Press
 reports describe the West German public as worried and puzzled
 over Khrushchev's future intentions,  Reflecting this nervous-
 ness, the West Berlin stock market had another bad day on 18 May,
 but Mayor Brandt says no flight of capital has occurred and there
 has been no panic selling.   The West German press consensus is
 that Khrushchev deliberately wrecked the Summit with unreasonable
 demands to discredit Eisenhower and US policy.   Many papers be-
 lieve the Western alliance has been strengthened by Khrushchev's
 extremes.  The respected Hamburg daily Die Welt terms the Paris
 meetings a "bitter lesson" for the West and says the real victor
 is Mao Tse-tung.  All papers express concern for Berlin and one
 drew a parallel between Hitler's tactics in 1938 and Khrushchev's
 now.
 4. The British press and public statements of political
 leaders unanimously blame the Soviet government for the collapse
 of the Summit conference.  There is also general agreement that,
 in overplaying his hand, Khrushchev has demonstrated the continuing
 need for Western solidarity--a point supported by critics of  the
 US in the U-2 incident.   The West is nevertheless urged to indi-
 cate readiness to negotiate whenever the opportunity is seriously
 offered.  Some typical statements:

 Eisenhower had announced that no more intelligence flights would

 Liberal Party leader Joseph Grimond:  Urged the US

 If Russians threaten to impose (Berlin) blockade, West must not

 Herald (Labor, which had called the U-2 flights "lunacy"):
 "...In eyes of peace-seeking world what a sorry, despicable
 character he (Khrushchev) now appears, spitting in the face of
 peace."
 Times (Independent):   "Immediate dangers--Berlin,
 pressure on outlying NATO states--are obvious but the only remedy
 is to restate our will to negotiate seriously whenever opportunity
 is seriously offered."
 Telegraph (Conservative):   "Back to Stalinism."
 "...likely that the object of recent Kremlin policy has been so
 to disarm, confuse, and divide the West that its public opinion,
 if not its statesmen, would be in no position to resist the kind
 of apocalyptic pressure which the Kremlin can now deploy."

 Since the

 views
 the American position in Austria has
 suffered "considerable damage" as a result of the "contradictory"
 treatment of the U-2 episode.   In their opinion, the tactical error
 of admitting the flight was compounded, first by defending the
 necessity of such flights, and second, by suspending them.   These
 are shared by conservative circles and the diplomatic corps.
 Despite this criticism, there are few illusions regarding Soviet
 exploitation of the affair and general condemnation of Soviet
 hypocrisy.   Some typical press comments are:   "There can be no
 doubt the world situation--is considerably more serious than at
 any time since before Suez and Korea."  "The row in Paris has at
 least spared us those false tones which we know from Geneva and
 Camp David."  The cold war cannot be "much colder than the climate
 of coexistence."

 collapse of the Summit meeting.  As of 17 May, however, the
 following press comments were typical:   "In exploiting the
 Sverdlovsk incident, Khrushchev went to the limit.  He demanded
 from the United States humiliating apologies--he has asked for
 the submission and humiliation of the US, affronted Eisenhower,
 probably exploded the Paris conference, and considerably

 aggravated the international situation." "His impolite behavior,
 is believed a result of increased pressure from a military clique
 which for a long time has reproached him for having reduced some
 troop contingents, and which for the time being wants a continuation
 of the cold war to preserve its strong position in the country."
 However:   "It is embarrassing if the President during the first
 conference hour, so to speak,had to eat as hors d'ouevres the words
 which the State Department issued to the world a few days ago."
 Swiss opinion of the Summit meeting has been colored to a con-
 siderable extent by its own spy episode and the expulsion of two
 Soviet diplomats on spy charges.
 7.   The Belgian and Dutch press generally attribute the
 failure of the Summit meeting to Khrushchev's deliberate attempt
 to sabotage the conference by exploiting the U-2 incident.  One
 Catholic Flemish paper says:   "If Khrushchev hoped to see De Gaulle
 and Macmillan condemn Eisenhower, he was grossly mistaken.
 Eisenhower has shown the proper reaction.   The West is in a better
 position in a continued cold war than the East."  However, a
 Socialist Flemish paper says:   "Once again inept American politi-
 cal and strategic policy has permitted Khrushchev to pose as the
 victim... arguments advanced by him only plausible, but give basis
 for spectacular propaganda...he takes first round on points."
 Foreign Minister Luns in a statement to the Dutch parliament on
 17 May said:   "This is not the first time the Soviet Union has
 precipitated an international crisis.   Since 1945, switching
 from grin to intimidation has been the constant method for what

 steadfastness of West are more important than ever."  Prime
 Minister De Quay, in a private conversation with Ambassador
 Young in The Hague, also strongly emphasized the absolute need
 for Western unity.
 8.  Khrushchev's insulting manner toward the Norwegian
 is happening in Paris at the moment.  Absolute unity and
 in connection with the U-2 affair, and his
 threats to obliterate bases used in connection with overflights,
 made a bad impression on the Norwegians.  Although disturbed at
 the Soviet leader's threats, the Norwegians resented his accusa-
 tions and allegations regarding their complicity.  Norwegian
 resentment contributed to making them more critically disposed
 toward Khrushchev's actions at the Summit.  All non-Communist
 newspapers in Oslo on 18 May blamed Khrushchev for the failure
 of the Summit meeting.  Foreign Minister Lange called a meeting
 of the Norwegian cabinet on 18 May to consider the situation
 following the breakdown of the Summit.  He had planned to go to
 Moscow on 23 May to attend the wedding of the Norwegian ambassa-
 dor's daughter and then make a 10-14 day private visit, during
 which he planned to see Gromyko.  He has now cancelled the trip
 "because of the increased burden of work in the situation which
 has arisen.','
 9.  Danish press comment on the break-up of the Summit
 conference is rather restrained with all papers voicing disappoint-
 ment at the turn of events in Paris.  Most papers agree that
 Khrushchev had gone to Paris with "good cards" and had overplayed

 the leaders to adopt more uncompromising positions.
 them.   The only official comment has been that of Foreign
 Minister Krag who said news of the conference's failure was
 received with great regret by the Danish government.   In a
 possible move to ward off possible Soviet charges that Danish
 territory is being used for "aggressive" purposes, the Danish
 defense minister told a parliamentary committee on 17 May that
 Denmark will not permit American airbases in Greenland to be
 used for reconnaissance flights over the USSR.
 10.   The Swedish press has generally agreed that Khrushchev,
 used the U-2 plane incident as a pretext to scuttle the Summit,
 knowing     from  his  prior  talks  with President Eisenhower
 and De Gaulle that no concessions would be forthcoming on
 Berlin, etc.   The leading Conservative paper criticizes Khrushchev
 for his "crude behavior" in Paris and states the Russian leader
 has the responsibility if the world now enters a period of
 greatly increased tension.   The semi-official'government paper
 is more reserved in its judgment, however, and condemns
 "activists" in both the Soviet Union and the US for pressuring

 had presented Khrushchev with the excuse which he desperately
 needed.  He believed that Khrushchev was sincere in desiring
 a detente.  With the world likely to be entering a new period
 of tension, the Russians may be tempted to get some difficult
 things done--i.e. a German peace treaty--which would have been
 difficult to achieve during a period of detente.
 11.     Finnish officials are keeping close-mouthed.  While
 the Finns may feel that Khrushchev bears the responsibility for
 the Summit fiasco, they will exercise considerable caution in
 openly criticizing him in the press.
 12.     The Madrid press of 17 May expressed no surprise over
 the breakdown since it never was optimistic about the outcome.
 However, it expressed full sympathy for the US and the President.
 The press and also the Madrid radio on 18 May speculated on the
 cause of Khrushchev's sudden truculence, ascribing it to
 pressure from Red army leaders and Peiping and to a probable
 weakening of his control over that sector of the Communist
 party's central committee which opposes a relaxation of East-
 West tension.
 13.   The President's exchanges with Khrushchev appeared
 to have enhanced his popularity in Portugal, according to press
 reporting.
 14.   General popular and press reaction in Greece to the
 U-2 incident and the subsequent collapse of the Summit talks
 has been favorable to the United States.  Greek Foreign Minister
 Averoff believes the Greek people, while excited by the U-2

 incident, are "taking it well" and is of the opinion that no
 lasting harm has resulted from the propaganda advantage which
 initially accrued to the USSR.  The action of nationalist
 opposition leaders in joining with the government to reject
 the communist-front United Democratic Left's demand for a
 parliamentary debate on US bases in Greece is an unusual example
 of collaboration by all Greek nationalist elements in the face
 of communist propaganda attacks against the West.   The non-
 communist Greek press, while critical over the timing of the
 U-2 flight and the "inadequate control and defective coordination"
 of US intelligence services, praised the "typical-American
 honesty" in admitting the flight's purpose and noted with
 pleasure the indication of Soviet vulnerability to aerial
 attack.   The collapse of the Summit talks was blamed on
 Khrushchev's "cold-blooded torpedoing" of the conference, but

 will applaud you (for the U-2 avowal) but in today's world, as
 seen from Greece, only a great power could afford the luxury of
 honesty in those circumstances."  However, he said that
 Khrushchev,by the grossness of his behavior in Paris, dissipated
 his assets.

 IX.  Western Hemisphere
 1.       The Canadian press strongly condemns Khrushchev and
 blames him for the Summit conference failure.  Prime Minister
 Diefenbaker has associated Canada with the Western communique
 and claimed Khrushchev's actions had strengthened Western resolve
 to remain united.  He added that the failure "has not and must
 not mean return to a cold war status." Liber?s4l opposition leader
 Pearson has endorsed this position.   The usually anti-American
 Toronto Globe and Mail editorially speculated on 18 May that the
 people of the uncommitted nations in Asia will take note of
 Khrushchev's "appalling discourtesy toward the President" and
 commented on the inconsistency of Khrushchev's refusal to
 negotiate with the US because of alleged American aggression
 with his demands that Communist China be recognized in world
 councils.
 2.  Reaction from Latin American countries is limited so
 far.   The Dominican Republic, Peru and Venezuela highlight
 Khrushchev's responsibility for the conference failure,while
 Brazil, Chile, and Ecuador suggest that the smaller powers can
 help to calm tensions between the great powers.  Reported
 Mexican and Panamanian reaction is thus far limited to ex-
 pressions of concern,while Cuba tends to follow the Communist
 line.
 3.  Brazilian Foreign Minister Lafer stated on 18 May
 that he did not think the Summit failure would lead to war.

 Editorials in two important papers accuse both sides of
 "imprudence," and "inflexibility" and express fear for the
 "salvation of mankind."  One newspaper proposes that smaller
 nations be given a voice rather than leaving all crucial
 decisions to a handful of "technologically advanced" nations.
 4.  Chilean Foreign Minister Ortuzar lamented "the failure
 of the conference in which all the world had placed its hope for
 better days for humanity."  A conservative radio commented that
 the United Nations might now be allowed to play its proper role
 in world affairs:   "Withholding from the United Nations any
 knowledge of the agenda of the abortive meeting in Paris turned
 out to be dangerous.  Matters of war and peace should not be
 considered exclusive attributes of nations having the largest
 stock of weapons,..The American plan in sum is nothing but a
 return to the principles of the United Nations."
 5.  The Castro-controlled press used Khrushchev's diatribes
 to emphasize Cuban charges that US policies are basically aggres-
 sive.                      Mambi Radio, known to be government controlled, referred
 to Eisenhower on 17 May:   "The gentleman who misrules the people
 of the US has just been deflated ... has backed down...has asked
 pardon...What he did would be called moral cowardice anywhere...
 Where is the world going to end with men such as these?"
 6.  The official Dominican radio commented that President
 Eisenhower's attitude was dignified and energetic.   It portrayed
 Khrushchev as "oozing venom between his wolf's fangs" in revoking
 the invitation to Eisenhower to visit the USSR.  It admonished
 that Communism retreats only in the face of force.

 7.  Prior to the end of the Summit, Ecuadorean President
 Ponce suggested that the medium and small nations join as a
 force to prevent the "catastrophic clash of interests between
 the great powers."
 8.  Mexican radio comment on 18 May expressed concern that
 a failure of understanding could lead to war.   "It is not right
 and not human to permit two groups with differing political ideas
 to carry humanity to an armed struggle which could ...lead to its
 extermination."
