 Premier Jaruzelski publicly pledged yesterday to remove the
 "fundamental rigors" of martial law by the end of the year but
 showed great caution about moving too quickly to relay all restric-
 tions.
 Addressing a nationwide television audience, Jaru-
 zelski revealed few details about regime plans to "sus-
 pend" martial law.   He said that the Military Council
 would remain to "oversee" the transition to the full lift-
 ing of martial law and that a reduced number of military
 commissars would continue to occupy major positions.   The
 Premier alluded to the possibility of "socially justified"
 amnesties but made no commitment.   He admitted that the
 measures failed to meet the expectations of some.
 Jaruzelski called for national accord but ignored
 the recent letter from former union leader Walesa-in which
 he offered to cooperate with the government in creating
 social agreement.   Walesa, in effect, laid down three
 conditions for such cooperation:  a general amnesty, the
 reinstatement of workers fired for union activity, and a
 return to the principle of union "pluralism."
 //A government press spokesman on Saturday condemned
 President Reagan's recent statement on Poland as more US
 interference in Polish affairs.  In addition, the same day
 a Deputy Foreign Minister warned US Ambassador Meehan that
 Warsaw would cut back bilateral ties if the US continued
 its interference.   Yesterday, TASS repeated the Polish
 news agency's criticism of US "pressure" and reported
 without comment Jaruzelski's announcement that the "basic
 Comment:  Jaruzelski's note of caution about the even-
 tual lifting of martial law restrictions probably reflects
 his own interest in maintaining control and also may have
 been intended to reassure domestic critics and the Soviets
 that he is concerned over internal security and unwilling
 to give in to Western pressure.   The statement in Pravda
 may reflect confidence in Moscow that conditions in Poland
 justify relaxing some aspects of military rule.   The ref-
 erence by TASS to US pressure, however, is probably de-
 signed in part to remind the authorities that the need for
 vigilance remains high.

 Sweden's proposal for a nuclear-weapons-free zone in Central
 Europe is ZikeZy to elicit a mixed response from the countries
 approached but may find a more enthusiastic rece tion canon  Nordic
 Social Democrats and European peace movements.
 The Swedish proposal, made last Wednesday, was con-
 tained in a demarche delivered to the member nations of
 NATO and the Warsaw Pact and to a number of European neu-
 tral, nonaligned countries.   Stockholm's proposal suggests
 the establishment of a zone--extending 150 kilometers on
 either side of the NATO - Warsaw Pact border--in which
 the use, transportation, and storage of all battlefield
 nuclear weapons and warheads would be prohibited.  Prep-
 arations for deploying nuclear charges and maneuvers with
 simulated employment of nuclear weapons also would be
 The idea of a nuclear-weapons-free zone in Central
 Europe was developed in a report by an international
 study group headed by Prime Minister Palme.   Foreign
 Minister Bodstrom has suggested that the nuclear-free
 zone could be developed in stages, beginning in Central
 Europe and extending ultimately to the outermost northern
 The Palme government, responding to mounting popular
 concern about nuclear war, indicated it intends to help
 develop new confidence-building measures leading to a cut-
 back in the role of nuclear weapons in the European secu-
 Comment:   Palme recognizes that the Soviets' military
 buildup in the area possibly will pose insurmountable
 obstacles to a nuclear-free zone in the Nordic region and
 apparently now is attempting to shift the discussion to
 measures that could help provide the framework for nuclear-
 free zones across Europe.
 Official reactions to the Swedish proposal for a
 nuclear-free area are likely to be skeptical, but Palme's
 overture may be received more favorably by Nordic Social
 Democrats, who in recent weeks have shown new interest in
 influencing the progress of INF negotiations in Geneva.
 Palme's initiative also may be viewed as a move intended
 to underscore Sweden's commitment to nonalignment, possibly
 in response to Soviet suggestions that the US may be trying
 Top Secret
 Bulgaria's alleged involvement in the shooting of
 the Pope and other questionable activities has set off
 negative diplomatic reactions in some West European cap-
 itals.   Italy recalled its Ambassador to Bulgaria on
 Saturday for "consulations" following Bulgaria's recall
 last week of its Ambassador to Rome.   According to West-
 ern press reports, Italian Foreign Minister Colombo said
 that, despite insufficient corroboration of Bulgaria's
 involvement, Rome remains concerned over possible other
 illegal activities by Bulgarians.   Officials in Bonn
 also stressed that they are concerned about reports of
 Sofia's toleration of heroin trafficking between Bulgaria
 and West Germany and of possible links between Palestinian
 guerrillas in Bulgaria and West German terrorist groups.
 Comment:   Sofia is clearly embarrassed by the Italian
 accusations and concerned about the negative impact on
 its image abroad.   Bulgarian officials probably hoped the
 arrest last week of Bekir Celenk--a smuggler based in
 Sofia accused by Turkish media of involvement in the plot
 to kill the Pope--would help its tarnished reputation.
 With Western attention also focused on reported Bulgarian
 willingness to provide a safehaven for arms and narcotics
 traffickers and possible support for terrorism, it will
 be difficult for Sofia to limit additional damage to its
 reputation.
 EC:   Foreign Ministers' Meeting
 //The Foreign Ministers begin a two-day meeting in
 Brussels today at which they will discuss the extension
 of trade restrictions on certain Soviet imports.   The
 measures, enacted last January in response to Warsaw's
 imposition of martial law, will expire on 31 December
 Comment:  //The UK and France in particular would
 like to see the sanctions renewed.   Other EC members,
 including Denmark and Greece, claim that the measures
 have been ineffective and unpopular.  Most members, how-
 ever, agree that conditions in Poland have not improved
 substantially over the past year and that members will
 need to evaluate the effects of the suspension of martial
 law.   The Foreign Ministers, therefore, probably will
 postpone a decision on renewing the sanctions until late
 this month, when they may decide on an extension of one
 Special Analysis
 PLO leader Arafat enjoys widespread support in the Palestinians'
 umbrella organization for his strategy to Zink it with the negotia-
 tions called for by President Reagan's Middle East peace proposals.
 He has not been able, however, to forma consensus behind a specific
 approach.  Some PLO radicals, encouraged by Syria, have intensified
 their opposition to his policies.  To maintain maximum flexibility,
 Arafat is moving ahead with efforts to strengthen PLO-Jordanian
 //The US initiative has increasingly become the focus
 of debate in PLO councils and between the PLO and Jordan.
 Arafat and other PLO leaders publicly continue to give
 equal attention to the Fez summit proposals, but they
 have clearly concluded the PLO's future role in the peace
 process depends mainly on its approach to the US initia-
 //The PLO Central Council's decision last month in
 Damascus not to reject the US initiative amounted to a
 reaffirmation of Arafat's dominant position and support
 for his efforts to promote a peaceful solution to the
 Palestinian problem.

 25X1
 //The council's failure to vote on recognition of
 Israel, relations with Jordan, and other specific issues,
 indicates the lack of consensus on the PLO's next move.
 //The PLO's claim to be the only legitimate representa-
 tive of the Palestinians recently has been strengthened.
 A group of independent West Bank political leaders failed
 to obtain significant support for a draft petition urging
 the PLO to be more conciliatory about recognizing Israel.//
 //If these independents had succeeded, they might have
 emerged eventually as an alternative to the PLO as a
 representative of the West Bank population.   There seems
 little chance for now that any sizable number of West
 Bankers would support King Hussein's participation in
 Despite the majority support for Arafat in the
 Central Council, he continues to move cautiously toward
 involving the PLO in the negotiating process.   The PLO
 leader is concerned about the bitterness of Syrian and
 PLO radical opposition to his policies, uncertain about
 the depth of PLO support, and skeptical of US resolve.
 A meeting of the Palestine National Council--the PLO's
 parliamentary body--continues to be postponed because
 Arafat apparently is not ready to subject his policies
 //Arafat wants to preserve flexibility regarding the
 US initiative.   His emphasis since the Central Council
 meeting on continuing the effort begun in October to
 strengthen PLO-Jordanian relations is the key element
 in this strategy.   Arafat met King Hussein just after
 the council sessions and agreed to form a committee to
 work out a common approach to the peace process and con-
 sider arrangements for forming a Palestinian-Jordanian
 //The committee, which has met frequently, reportedly
 is making progress.   Arafat and Hussein seem likely to
 agree on the formation of a joint negotiating team that
 will include Palestinian notables acceptable to the PLO,
 in order to ensure tacit PLO participation in any Middle
 East negotiations.   They will then seek US approval of
 Arafat also has stated publicly his commitment in
 principle to the eventual formation of a confederation
 with Jordan.   It will take much hard bargaining, however,
 to work out specific arrangements.   The Palestinians con-
 ceive a confederation as a link between two equal entities,
 and PLO leaders insist a Palestinian state has to be
 created before any confederal agreement takes effect.
 //The PLO chief hopes his cooperation with Jordan and
 his willingness to consider confederation will encourage
 some movement toward a dialogue with the US.   He still
 refuses, however, to meet the US requirement that the
 PLO recognize Israel, fearing this would split the or-
 ganization without commensurate gains in terms of Israeli
 If Arafat and Hussein reach formal agreement on the
 formation of a negotiating team and on the concept of an
 eventual Palestinian-Jordanian political link, Arafat is
 almost certain to claim that any further moves in the

 CHINA-US: The Technology Transfer Issue
 IlDuring the past several months, Beijing has expressed growing
 impatience about obtaining US technology and asserted that, after
 Taiwan, US controls on technology are the most serious irritant in
 bilateral relations. The Chinese are motivated by their need for
 advanced US technoZogy--especially military related--and by domestic
 pressures to show proof of Washington's long-term commitment. Al-
 though China's arguments on the issue almost certainly are exagger-
 ated, Beijing is Likely to continue to charge that Washington's
 restrictive export controls undermine the expansion of Sino-US ties.11
 //The Chinese have sought advanced US technology since
 1972, and its potential benefit for their modernization
 program was a fundamental factor in the decision to seek
 improved ties with Washington. Current Chinese pressure
 on the issue, however, is qreater than at any time during
 the past decade.//
 //China is primarily seeking dual-use US technology,
 which would serve military and civilian modernization
 goals. This technology includes advanced computers,
 telecommunications equipment, and integrated circuit
 manufacturing equipment. In some cases where the US
 has allowed China to import dual-use technology, Beijing
 has diverted it for use i areas proscribed by US regula-
 tions.// F   I
 //Most West European governments and Japan tend to
 be influenced by the US lead on technology transfer
 policy. Beijing thus views liberalized US export controls
 as the key to fuller access to West European and Japanese
 technology.// ~   I
 Beijing's Complaints
 //Deng Xiaoping and other leaders repeatedly have
 charged there is a discrepancy between US policy state-
 ments and performance on the technology issue. They
 argue the US should allow China unrestricted access to
 advanced technology, based on Washington's commitments
 in 1979 to grant most-favored-nation status and in 1980
 to provide previously denied dual-use technology on a
 //China has acknowledged its separate licensing cate-
 gory, but has stressed that current restrictions indicate
 the US still treats China much the same as the USSR.
 Even after Washington helped expedite licensing approvals
 //Despite such complaints, there is reliable evidence
 that the leadership knows better.  US firms already have
 made available to China a considerable amount of advanced
 technology for civil application on a nonrestricted
 basis.   Since 1979, however, China has greatly reduced
 its imports of capital equipment and has not tried to
 acquire most of the technology that has been offered.//
 //Deng Xiaoping may be using the technology issue to
 deal more effectively with his detractors.  Although he
 is in no danger of losing the political initiative, he
 may be under increased pressure from those leaders who
 question the long-term value of Sino-US relations.//
 //Beijing's recent moves to put some distance between
 itself and Washington and to start talking with Moscow
 substantially modify the US-oriented policy line associ-
 ated with Deng.  Moreover, Chinese reluctance to pursue
 strategic cooperation with the US since the communique
 on Taiwan arms sales suggests Deng has become more sensi-
 //China's campaign to acquire US technology also may
 be an outgrowth of a new, expanded effort to modernize
 China's military with Western assistance.   Since the
 12th Party Congress in September, the Chinese have shown
 more interest in West European weapon systems, and China's
 Top Secret
 arms import organization has become more active in shop-
 ping for Western weapons and technology.                               The appointment
 of Zhang Aiping, a career military science and technology
 higher priority on military modernization.//
 //Deng and other leaders may now be responding to
 pressure from the military for more resources.   Several
 senior officers have resisted Deng's succession arrange-
 ments, and he may be more willing to trade concessions
 to them in return for ratification of personnel changes
 vital to the succession.   This process appears to be
 under way, with the military experiencing its first
 major realignment of high-level appointments since 1975.//
