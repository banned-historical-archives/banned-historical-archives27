 SUBJECT:  Principal Factors in the World Situation
 I.  End of the Post-War Era
 1.  It has become trite to remark that the last five to ten
 years have witnessed the end of the post-war era.  Nearly everyone
 now understands that during this period the overwhelming American
 superiority in arms, in economic power, and in political influence
 came to an end and was replaced by a new structure of world power
 in which Western Europe, the USSR, and China have come to occupy
 prominent positions.  Many of the legacies of World War II were
 resolved, new nationalisms in former colonial areas emerged and
 flowered, and the world generally overcame many of the hatreds
 and fears of the war and its aftermath.
 2.  There have, of course, been serious crises, revolutions,
 and even major warfare during these last ten years, some of which
 have involved confrontations between the great powers.  Yet, in
 each case, the dangers of confrontation were recognized.  Most of
 these crises were unraveled, terminated by compromise or acquiescence,

 deemphasized and allowed to smolder, or simply permitted to fade
 away.  In the most persistent, that in Vietnam, objectives have
 been limited and the conflict in arms kept isolated.  New crises
 threaten, such as that in the Near East, and others will arise
 from time to time.  But the great powers, fearful or uncertain
 of the response of the adversary, no longer show much interest
 in territorial expansion by conquest or in the acquisition of
 permanent military bases outside their own territory. The Cuban
 missile crisis of the autumn of 1962 was an important watershed;
 it clarified the limits of US patience and removed some of the
 uncertainty in the Soviet mind about US willingness to use military
 3.  Perhaps the most remarkable development of the post-war
 period lies in the acceptance of the new structure of world power
 by those whose relative position declined or whose national objectives
 were frustrated.  There were political and psychological repercussions
 in the US to the rise of Soviet power and the communization of China
 and Cuba, but they were contained and faded away.  Western Europe
 accepted the end of the imperial era with relative grace; the pain
 was eased by the rise of economic power and affluence. The Soviet
 leadership, after fulminating against US "encirclement" in the

 immediate post-war era, came to accept the reality of US power
 and later the growing independence of its client states.  Whereas
 in most of world history national frustration or fear of another's
 rising strength has led to major war, it has in this period not
 done so.  The reason is only partly the fear of nuclear destruction;
 even victory creates burdens, and the world has become too large
 and complex to police in imperialistic style and peace too pleasant
 to be scorned for dubious victory.
 4+.  On the surface at least, the world thus appears less likely
 than five, ten, or fifteen years ago to be plunged into the horrors
 of a large nuclear conflict.  But this could be illusory.  The
 acquisition of armament continues '4pace; indeed progress in arma-
 ment has taken on a life of its own and has become a major causative
 factor in international politics.  China is in crisis and revolution,
 world population is growing rapidly, the poorer nations grow poorer
 and the rich grow richer.  At the same time, a new movement toward
 detente has emerged in Europe, and the Soviet regime, which must
 remain the most important focus of our calculations, has assumed
 a more moderate posture in world politics.  In the paragraphs that
 follow, we take up these various developments and note the ways in
 which they impinge upon each other.

 II.  New Factors in the Relations of Military Power
 5.  Until very recently the military situation in the world
 appeared relatively clear.  The only two powers that mattered were
 the US and the USSR; although US nuclear attack. capabilities sub-
 stantially exceeded those of the USSR, each could inflict enormous
 damage upon the other; offensive capabilities on each side greatly
 exceeded the other's related defensive capabilities.  There did not
 seem to be any early likelihood that either side could build a
 military force which would permit it to attack the other without
 itself receiving unacceptable damage.  While there was no military
 balance, there was a kind of strategic balance.  Each side felt
 inhibited from undertaking diplomatic, political, or military
 initiatives which carried serious danger of bringing the other's
 strategic forces into action.  Thus, one of the principal problems
 of US and Soviet leaders was to calculate the degree of danger
 inherent in each initiative or in its reaction thereto.  Un-
 certainty in such calculations was inescapable, and mistakes and
 misapprehensions could be serious matters.  Khrushchev made such
 a mistake in 1962, and this was major factor in his dismissal
 two years later.

 Approved For Rose 2006/09/25: CIA-RDP79R00967A0 100020027-9
 6.  The situation described immediately above could be changing.
 To be sure, neither side today believes that it could attack the
 other without receiving enormous damage in return.  Programs are
 continuing in both the US and the USSR to reduce the vulnerability
 of strategic attack forces; the Soviet leaders somewhat belatedly
 are deploying their missile forces underground.  But both sides
 also are making serious efforts to insure that they know precisely
 where the other side's military targets are located geodetically
 and are improving the accuracy of their missiles and their penetration
 capabilities.  Thus, both are strengthening their first-strike
 capabilities, and neither can be quite so persuaded as before that
 the time may not come when the side striking the first blow might
 gain an appreciable advantage.  This in turn has stimulated interest
 in the development of anti-missile systems designed to counter any
 such presumed advantage.  Neither the US nor the USSR has developed
 an anti-missile system which would provide assurance that potential
 destruction could be limited to manageable proportions, and neither
 seems likely to have such a capability in being for a considerable
 number of years ahead.
 7.  In addition to the uncertainty spawned by these developments,
 there can be gnawing doubts on another score.  Neither side can
 have a high degree of confidence that its weapons systems will

 S-E-C-R-E-T
 function as prescribed.  Full weapons systems tests obviously
 cannot be conducted.  Statistical probabilities based on known
 factors can be calculated but they cannot be conclusive.  Unknown
 factors may be present.  Scientists and technicians on each side
 continue to study weapons effects and to improve weapons systems.
 Even though no visible and acknowledgeably effective anti-missile
 system has been deployed, neither side can be certain that the
 other will not acquire some particular knowledge or capability
 which would neutralize its own, or a large part of its own,
 capabilities.  It is only prudent to recognize that missiles and
 guided aerodynamic weapons are extremely complex affairs and that
 the nuclear, electronic, and cosmic sciences, upon which these
 weapons systems are built, are relatively new disciplines con-
 taining ramifications about which new discoveries are continually
 being made.
 8.  The possibility thus exists that mutual deterrence based
 upon a balance of terror could disappear.  This could come about
 if either developed the capability to neutralize the other's
 retaliatory force by striking first, or if one developed a
 defensive capability in which he had a high degree of confidence.
 At first blush it would seem that a decline or demise of balance-
 of-terror deterrence should greatly disturb the world situation
 and especially US-Soviet relations.  But this seems doubtful;

 the stakes are too high, and the proofs too dubious, to provide
 any rational statesman with the kind of assurance he would need
 to authorize a first strike in any but the most dire and dangerous
 circumstances, or to lead him to believe that he could withstand
 another's assault with relative impunity.  If anything, the un-
 certainties involved and the difficulties of calculation are
 factors toward stability, rather than instability, in world
 order they encourage greater prudence, lest the other side feel
 dangerously cornered and be driven to an irrational reaction.
 This suggests that both the US and the USSR will continue on their
 course of not undertaking initiatives which might provoke the
 other to a strategic initiative.  Indeed, the consequence could
 be a reduction in the threshold of risk which either party would
 be willing to assume.
 9.  While the two superpowers have been thus refining their
 strategic capabilities and adjusting their policies to the evolving
 situation, two other nations have been moving toward the acquisition
 of nuclear striking power.  France already has a minimal capability
 and China will acquire one very soon.  From a strategic point of
 view, neither of them is likely to develop anything significant in

 Approved For Rose 2006/09/25: CIA-RDP79R00967P,100020027-9
 the world balance of military power; their capabilities could be
 quite easily and quickly destroyed.  What is important is that a
 new element of uncertainty has been created, undermining to some
 degree the tentative stabilization achieved by US and Soviet mutual
 forbearance.  The Chinese case is, of course, by far the more
 important; a regime which seems to enjoy the role of international
 renegade is not one which instills confidence or respect in either
 Communist or non-Communist neighbor.  It would be easy to over-
 estimate the political leverage which France and China are acquiring;
 indeed their leaders have probably overestimated it, as the British
 did and now recognize that they did.  But the fact remains that
 these weapons are most dangerous when in irresponsible hands.  We
 cannot yet tell how the Chinese internal situation will develop or
 how the Chinese leaders will seek to exploit their capability when
 they acquire it.  One thing does seem fairly clear; the Soviets
 are perhaps more worried than we are about the possible irration-
 alities of Chinese behavior.
 10.  The great paradox of modern life is that enormous sums
 of money are being spent developing and exploring modern weapons
 which most people (including most of those decreeing the expenditures,
 except possibly the Chinese leaders) fervently hope will never be

 used.  Much lesser sums are spent on general purpose forces and
 these seem to be used more than ever.  The days of armies marching
 across borders with banners flying may be a thing of the past, but
 military action is not.
 ll.  The military forces in the poorer, unstable, and newer
 nations continue to be a key element in the political scene.  A
 few hundred semiliterate ill-trained soldiers in several African
 states have overturned regimes; in other African states only some-
 what better-trained forces have proven the only element capable of
 maintaining some kind of order or reestablishing political decency.
 Often they are the only group with a national awareness and a sense
 of responsibility.  Even in Latin America, with some notable exceptions,
 the military establishment has often proved the only force capable
 of surmounting divisive social and political problems, reducing
 corruption, ending stagnation, and setting the nation on the road
 to progress and reform.  In the Arab world, the military establish-
 ment is the principal revolutionary force in several key countries.
 In Indonesia the Communist associations of some military leaders
 led to a near successful Communist coup, which was suppressed by
 anti-Communist military leaders.  Indeed, it has become increasingly
 apparent that a military establishment in many parts of the world
 today is not to be measured so much by its military prowess as by

 the quality and political inclinations of its leadership.  This
 situation is, of course, not new, but it appears to be more
 important as the problems of so many of these nations seem to be
 multiplying.
 12.  One of the perplexing problems of the advanced states in
 this kind of world is what types and how large general purpose forces
 they should maintain.  Some regard such forces as necessary to reduce
 dependence upon nuclear arms, others as a necessary adjunct to
 nuclear arms, still others as an expensivQ anachronism.  There
 can be no doubt that they perform an important political role even
 for the advanced states; US forces remain in Western Europe more
 in a symbolic than a defense role; the same is true of Soviet forces
 in Eastern Europe.  When these forces are used to suppress revolutionary
 uprisings they have often had a difficult time of it, especially
 when the revolutionary forces have had little to lose and much to
 gain by avoiding frontal combat and engaging in prolonged, guerrilla-
 type conflict.
 13.  Little seems clear about the future of arms and armed con-
 flict.                        The piling up of armaments and the maintenance of large
 forces seems likely to continue in both the poorer and the advanced
 countries, though for different reasons.  The paradoxes and per-
 plexities seem likely to persist.  Much depends upon the political

 changes occurring in the world, upon the related progress of
 military doctrine, and upon the technological development of
 armament itself.  Disarmament and arms control offer one means
 of moving toward a resolution, but all such movements can only
 go so far before they encounter a major hurdle -- the uncertainties
 of future need.  Not the least of these is China's future course.
 III.  Confusion and Crisis in China
 14.  There is no doubt that China is undergoing a new
 paroxysm, and one perhaps more cataclysmic than any in its unhappy
 history.  It is presenting to the world all that an established
 Communist regime is not thought to possess -- disorder, open brawling
 between competing forces, indecision, absence of clear authority.
 While other Communist regimes have passed through crises, the
 struggle has usually been rather secretly conducted within the
 top levels of the party, and the results have usually been quick
 and clear; prolonged and visible confusion is a new phenomenon.
 The explanation is not easily discernible, and any judgment must
 be tentative.  What appears to be occurring is an attempt --
 opposed by important leaders in the party -- to move the Chinese
 Communist revolution into a new and unprecedented phase.

 15.  China has serious problems of a purely objective
 character which condition this revolutionary development.  The
 pressure of population on food supplies has been critical for
 five years and grows steadily worse.  In the past ten years
 population has increased by 125 million, while by dint of con-
 siderable effort food production has barely recovered the level
 of ten years ago after disastrous crop failures during the early
 sixties.  Despite the recent adoption of a birth control program,
 the pressure of population will worsen for at least another
 twenty years. The crisis in agriculture has not only reduced
 calorie intake and forced China to buy food; it has also reduced
 export earnings and the supply of raw materials to industry.  While
 some progress has been made in industrial development, China remains
 an agricultural nation, and no way out appears in prospect.  The
 economic problem has been aggravated by the adoption of programs
 based upon ideological and political motivations, including foreign
 aid and advanced weapons development.
 16.  Mao Tse-tung, nearing the end of his life and apparently
 ill, is not unaware of the economic deficiencies of China, but he
 has more important concerns.  The USSR is no longer Communist as
 he see communism, the imperialist threat personified by the
 United States threatens the Chinese dream of hegemony in Asia,

 Indonesia has fallen under reactionary control, party leaders
 at home are becoming too practical, and there is too much dis-
 cussion and dissent.  A solution to all these problems is needed
 in the days remaining to him, and the way he has chosen is to
 rejuvenate and extend the revolution, to instill the selflessness
 and discipline of the party's great past, too root the "thought"
 of Mao into the Chinese mind so thoroughly that it can not be torn
 out.  He has in fact engaged in an act of faith; he apparently
 believes that his ideas, if deeply enough embedded, will triumph
 over all enemies, problems, and obstacles.  His very efforts have
 created chaos, and to the degree he persists the chaos may be
 intensified.  No society can but disintegrate with schools and
 universities closed, intellectuals pursued, and managers and governors
 harassed.  No revolution before has attempted so much so fast or
 in the same way; whereas most revolutionaries have sought power
 and then settled for a slow evolutionary change of ideas, Mao is
 seeking a rapid revolution in thought after finding the evolu-
 tionary process slow and wanting.
 17. Judged on historical grounds, success seems unlikely,
 at least in Mao's terms.  He has chosen a dangerous method, one
 which could not only destroy him but the Chinese state as we
 know it.   But if he does succeed in routing his more pragmatic

 opponents, we might then be faced with a Maoist China, denouncing
 revisionists and imperialists alike, threatening all and sundry,
 and perhaps even engaging in military adventures against whoever
 is thought to be the worst enemy (one cannot be certain it would
 be the US).  He cannot succeed totally, however, and one day -
 probably sooner than later -- he must die.  Then another paroxysm
 may come about, when the routed opponents challenge his uneasy
 heirs.  Such a struggle would carry with it the possibility of
 widespread civil disturbance and even of civil war, economic
 disintegration, and social chaos.  It would be folly to predict
 such an outcome of the present confusion in China, but it would
 be imprudent to exclude it.
 18.  Whatever the final outcome may be (and it may be years
 before China stabilizes), the fact is that no other state, Communist
 or non-Communist, can calculate what role China will play in Asia,
 in the Communist world, or in international politics.  Although
 the Soviet leaders probably nurture hopes that at some time China
 can be brought back to a more practical appreciation of the
 realities of international life, they probably are also disturbed
 by the likelihood that any China will have interests different
 from their own, economic problems which are virtually insoluble

 in the foreseeable future, and a potential for troublemaking.
 Meanwhile, the spreading and deepening of the crisis in China
 is already beginning to alter the power structure of Asia.  Those
 threatened by Chinese power have, perhaps prematurely, begun to
 breathe a little easier.  China's Communist neighbors and friends
 (i.e., the Pakistanis) must be highly nervous about the implications
 for them of a possible future redirection of Chinese doctrine and
 policy.  While the Soviet position in the Communist world has been
 strengthened by the visible convulsions in China, the Russian
 leaders have also been moved by the fear and dislike of Mao to
 show a greater interest in Europe.
 IV.  New Perspectives in Europe
 19. It is commonplace to say that Europe has changed greatly
 since 1945.  What is usually referred to is the economic growth
 in both East and West Europe, the decline of ideological politics,
 the breakdown of narrow nationalism, the creation of the common
 market, the reduced internal and external Communist threat to
 Western Europe.  But many important things are unchanged:  Germany
 is still divided; Europe, both East and West, is still host to
 foreign troops; Eastern Europe remains outside the Western-
 dominated international financial system; Western Europe remains
 allied to the United States and dependent upon it for military
 protection.  What is important to this analysis is that events
 in Europe and elsewhere in the world have given to Europe a new
 view of itself and an impetus to changing those things which
 remain unchanged.               l

 20.  Perhaps the most important change of all is a shift
 in the Soviet attitude toward its European neighbors.  Spurred
 by their deepening quarrel with China, the Soviets have found
 good relations with Europe more important to their national
 security.  The Soviet leaders also seem to realize that the
 door has been firmly closed to a Communist Europe and even --
 for a substantial period of time -- to an alteration in the
 status of Berlin.  They see that changes, if they come, will
 be evolutionary rather than dramatic.  They may not even wish
 for any major changes soon, lest such create new and unmanageable
 problems for them. Above all, the Soviets think of themselves
 as Europeans and have come increasingly to share the personal inter-
 eats  of their neighbors -- automobiles, summer holidays, con-
 sumers' goods, and light music.  The iron curtain is not gone,
 but it is rusting; there is more and easier movement through it
 than ever.
 21.  Western Europe, too, is altering its outlook.  It is
 self-confident, even cocky.  President de Gaulle in one sense
 personifies the new Europe because many Europeans share his
 precepts, though he and his countrymen are widely disliked.
 Many enjoy being told that they no longer need accept and follow
 all US policies and proposals.  Many feel that there is room for

 movement in East-West relations, but that the US in its preoccupa-
 tion with Asia and an ideological war against Communism is blocking
 it.  Many fear that in its preoccupation with Asia the US will
 sell out its European friends on questions that really matter
 to them.  Thus, the US, while admired for its advanced technology
 and needed for protection, no longer enjoys the respect in which
 it once was held.  Indeed, one of the main objectives of post-war
 US policy has been achieved; many Europeans believe that they can
 manage their own affairs.
 22. This is not to say that they can do so, or that all them
 wish the US to go away.  On the contrary, few Europeans really
 want a Europe led by France or Germany, or worse yet by France
 and Germany in partnership; they would like at least a powerful
 referee.  No responsible leader really wants to cut himself off
 from access to American military power, American technology, or
 American financial backing.  The fact is, however, that events
 of the past few years have been doing so.  The US was bested by
 de Gaulle over the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; the
 European Economic Community is becoming a highly protective
 economic bloc; the Kennedy Round will not produce the trade
 liberalization for which the US had hoped; American investment

 in Europe is coming under scrutiny and some degree of control;
 American policy in Asia, though still officially supported by
 most governments, is generally regretted; American prestige has
 suffered over its inability to close out the Vietnam war, and
 American leadership is thought to lack the sureness and deftness
 which it was believed to have had in the now somewhat idealized
 memories of the post-war years.
 23.  What all of this portends for the future is not quite
 so much as many Europeans think.  The Soviets may have moved
 toward accepting the status quo, but are not about to give
 anything up or to renounce their aspirations for hegemony in Europe.
 The European Economic Community may be protectionist, but it is
 probably incapable of overcoming the economic advantages of American
 industrial efficiency and technological progress.  What we are likely
 to witness is a considerable show of independence from the US and
 large amount of diplomatic maneuvering but not very much change.
 De Gaulle no doubt would like to see a new structure of power in
 Europe, bringing the USSR into a new European system which would
 both integrate Germany and neutralize it.  The new German leader-
 ship is both his enemy and his ally in this effort.  It too would
 like a new European system, but seems unlikely to sacrifice its
 American ties unless it achieves some of its national aspirations.
 These the Soviets seem most unlikely to concede.

 24.  Thus, while a basic alteration in Europe's structure of
 power seems unlikely in the near term, the conditions which could
 lead to a change are emerging.  The Western Europeans have reacted
 to two decades of peace, a greater sense of security, and economic
 well-being.  Many feel that the structure of power built upon the
 North Atlantic Treaty, while appropriate to its day and still con-
 taining elements vital to European order and peace, was nevertheless
 created for a different set of circumstances and has been deeply
 wounded by Gaullist actions and preachments.  Some believe, and
 many fear, that the US response has been at the least unimaginative.
 Underlying much of the European reserve over the US role in Europe
 is not really a desire to remove US influence but a desire to see
 US leadership manifested in new ways and upon new precepts.  The
 prescription is easier requested than filled. For US policy in
 Europe depends in large degree upon an appreciation of Soviet policy
 and Soviet objectives.  These have perhaps altered over the past
 ten years.  One major aspect of Soviet policy was to destroy
 "imperialism" by staking out claims in the former colonial areas.
 V.  Evolving Role of Nations on the Periphery of World Power
 25.  A great deal has happened in the newer and poorer nations
 during the last ten years, but a number of important things have not
 happened.  Over all, they have not embraced Communism or become
 - 19 -
 Approved For Release 2006/09/25 : CIA-RDP79R00967A001100020027-9
 Approved For ease 2006/09/25: CIA-RDP79R0096701100020027-9
 allies of the USSR.  They have not become a bloody battleground
 between pro-American and pro-Soviet forces.  They have not become
 new centers of world power capable of defying the established
 world powers.  In truth, Cuba has become Communist, and some states
 have developed closer friendship with the USSR than we would have
 preferred.  A bloody war is going on in Vietnam, and there has been
 bloodletting in many places in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
 New nationalisms have been truculent and difficult to deal with.
 But, with all this taken into account, the fact is that the major
 world powers have been concerned primarily with their relations
 to each other and not with the ill-fed and ill-housed on the periphery
 of world power.
 26.  This is partly because the so-called competition between
 the US and the USSR for the allegiance of the newer nations simply
 did not pay off very well.  Indeed, it has become something of a
 costly nuisance.  It is true that the USSR has made some friends
 in Africa and the Near East and acquired a client in the Western
 Hemisphere, but it has been costly and probably not as rewarding
 as the Soviets had hoped.  But also involved has been the abnegation
 of the courted. Most of them couldn't care less about the cold war;
 they have their own problems.  These are problems of who shall exercise

 S-E-C-R-E-T
 power, how fast and in what manner shall modernization proceed,
 who shall own and operate enterprises and for whose benefit,
 what shall be done about local ethnic antagonisms, what role should
 be accorded to foreign capital and foreign advisors, what can or
 should be done to feed growing populations or to restructure society
 and the economy, what can or should be done about the enemy across
 the border.  These are problems which of course have international
 implications and expose countries to meddling and subversion; they
 create threats of revolution and often lead to it.  But these problems
 are home-made and so are most of the attempted solutions.  Most of
 the leaders feel themselves in a real dilemma; they want and need
 outside help, but they don't want the strings, the controls, or the
 attempted subversion -- no matter how subtle -- that they see or
 fear coming with the help.
 27.  In specific form, the problems which preoccupy the
 politically-active segments of these societies have led to many
 conflicts and movements which we note in the daily flow of infor-
 mation.  There is the rivalry between radical and conservative Arabs,
 the aberrant behavior of the Syrian Baathists, Nasser's ambitions
 in South Arabia, the effort to oust Hussein, the troubles on the
 Israeli border, communal troubles and famine in India.  There have
 been coups in Algeria, Ghana, Congo, Argentina, Brazil, and elsewhere.

 Approved For ease 2006/09/25 : CIA-RDP79R00967*1100020027-9
 There have been a breakdown of the Nigerian state, war between
 India and Pakistan, threats to the Emperor of Ethiopia, and war
 against the Kurds of Iraq.  Perhaps most significant of all events
 in recent years has been the revolution in Indonesia, where the
 military-intellectual-student coalition born of the attempted
 Communist coup is pulling the country back from the excesses and
 idiocies of Sukarno.  Events of the past few years have ousted
 Communists from most of the few positions they had won.  Indeed,
 it would seem that there has been a general turning away from
 ideological solutions.
 28.  Despite some gains for our side which have emerged from
 this disorder, some of it can be dangerous.  A new war in the Near
 East or Africa might draw one or more of the world powers into a
 position of silent partner; one cannot assume that the Soviet leaders
 will always view their interests as they did in the India-Pakistan
 war.  The Chinese and the Asian communists have a view quite different
 from that of the Soviets concerning the rapidity and means by which
 the world Communist revolution should be accomplished, and Castro
 on this matter shares the Chinese view.  Thus, active subversion
 progresses in Asia, and Castro tries to export revolution in Latin
 America.  Despite all these particular and potential dangers, the
 fact remains that the newer and poorer nations have become much less

 Approved For ease 2006/09/25: CIA-RDP79R00967* 1100020027-9
 foci of engagement than had been feared.  There are, of course, a
 number of key nations and areas where developments could have a
 fundamental effect upon the structure of world power, but the
 great powers have concerns more relevant to their security than
 what happens in each country in each area. They have learned that
 a friend made one year may be lost the next and that what happens
 in an obscure and minor nation may not make any difference.
 29.  With the poorer nations less involved in great power
 rivalry and more preoccupied with their own difficulties, they have
 lost some of political unity that had emerged among them five to
 ten years ago.  The "Afro-Asianbloc;" the "spirit of Bandung," and
 self-conscious moralism have given way to fragmentation.  Meetings
 of "third world" leaders are fewer and virtually unnoticed; within
 Africa, Asia, the Near East the political quarrels and rivalries
 are more urgent than supposed common interests.  Nevertheless, there
 is one area of common purpose which is emerging among them and which
 is manifesting itself in various UN agencies.  The poorer nations
 of the world have come to recognize that the gap between them and
 the industrial nations of Europe and North America is widening.
 While new oil and mineral discoveries and the opening of many areas
 to exploitation and development has already created the prospect
 of a better life for millions of people, there seems to be no prospect
 for improvement for many hundreds of millions of people in Asia,

 Africa, and Latin America.  But regardless of the prospects, the
 richer nations appear likely to come under much stronger pressure
 to review and revise their monetary, lending, trade, and aid
 policies.  They will be under a strong moral compulsion at least
 to help feed the growing multitudes.
 30.     Unfortunately this rising pressure is occurring at a
 time when the world is encountering a threat to its supply of
 liquidity.  In 1966 accretion to the world's supply of monetary
 gold was zero, and this was only the last of many years in which
 the availability of liquidity has fallen short of the needs of an
 expanding world economy.  The large US gold supply accumulated
 during the war and post-war era and the use of dollars as national
 monetary reserves permitted a large expansion of the world economy
 despite the gold shortage.  But, the US balance-of-payments deficit,
 which was the essential ingredient of this expansion, cannot go on
 forever.  Worst of all, the US gold supply is at the mercy of the
 world's central bankers.  Should others follow the French example
 and convert dollar holdings into gold, a monetary panic would ensue.
 It is therefore essential, both to avoid panic and to finance
 economic expansion, that some better means be soon developed to
 ensure a continuing supply of liquidity and to finance and rectify
 balance-of-payments disequilibria.

 31.  The achievement of social, economic, and political
 progress among the poorer nations is, of course, hindered by a
 variety of other obstacles.  The political myths of self-determi-
 nation and linguistic autonomy and the spectre of neo-colonialism
 are interfering with needed foreign investment and progress in
 education.  Corruption as a political way of life and personal
 vindictiveness as a rule of political conflict hardly contribute
 to orderly growth.  Religious belief, widespread ignorance, and
 improved public health programs seem likely to continue to con-
 tribute to rising population pressures for many years to come.
 In sum, throughout much of the area of Asia, the Near East, Africa,
 and Latin America things seem likely to get worse.
 32.  If this is difficult milieu for US policy-making, it is
 also difficult for the Soviet leaders.  Many of the hopes they
 must have had in the post-war era have evaporated.  The colonial
 world did not prove the precipitate for the destruction of capitalism,
 poet-war Europe was not engulfed in Communist revolution, China did
 not become a reliable and pliant ally.  Even the nations of Eastern
 Europe upon which Communist regimes were foisted proved recalcitrant.
 What, then, do they thhia . k that they can and rnaat do as their revolution
 enters its second half-century of power?

 VI.  The View from Moscow
 33.  The Soviet revolution was largely Lenin's revolution,
 and one of the reasons it succeeded was that he maintained a
 balance between evangelism and reality.  He offered both brother-
 hood and bread.  His successors have retained the dualism of
 Bolshevism.  Though they have made mistakes in appraising the
 world about them and in determiniflg the limits of their maneuver-
 ability, they have always attempted to take account of the "relation
 of forces" in setting their course and have always been willing
 to alter it when forced by circumstances to do so.  They have also
 attempted to spread the gospel, Stalin by subversion and conquest
 and Khrushchev by salesmanship and competition.
 34.  The present leaders of the Soviet Union, on this anniversary
 of their revolution, look like men who do not know what course to
 follow. They have shown a high degree of sensitivity to the world
 about them and have generally drawn the right conclusions from the
 preeminent facts of international life.  They recognize that con-
 quest and new projections of military power are dangerous.  They
 know they can no longer "spank" their client nations.  They have
 seen that many of Khrushchev's foreign policies were self-defeating,
 and they have seen the failures of the competitive policy. They
 no longer overestimate the appeal of communism and underestimate

 Approved For ease 2006/09/25: CIA-RDP79R0096701100020027-9
 the will of their opponents.  They fear the Chinese and recognize
 that China's problems and interests are different from their own.
 They have seen the futility of trying to communize Western Europe
 and have come to terms with the status quo there.  They have, in
 effect, adopted a new posture not so much from any positive ad-
 vantages they see in it, but from lack of anything better.
 35.  Likewise in domestic affairs the Soviet leaders have come
 to face the facts.  They have retreated from the rigidities of de-
 tailed planning at the top; they are trying to encourage greater
 productivity and more efficient use of resources by decentralizing
 authority in economic matters.  They have permitted more freedom
 to intellectuals; periodic efforts to control the exercise of that
 freedom derive more from caution than from Philistinism.  They
 know their people want to enjoy the automobile culture of their
 European neighbors, and they are moving toward making a wider
 and better range of consumers' goods available.  Indeed, the
 leaders themselves know the country is still backward in many ways
 and wish to preserve and build upon what they have.  Their traditional
 and doctrinal hostility toward the US has become tempered by doubt
 and has admitted a mixture of respect and curiousity.

 S-E-C-R-E-T
 36.  The important question for us is how deep this realism
 is and what it does to the suppressed evangelism of the Soviet
 revolution.   There can be little doubt that the Soviet leaders would
 deny to themselves or to others that there has been any diminution
 of their belief or striving for a Communist world in which the USSR
 would occupy a paramount position.  There can also be little doubt
 that they would seize upon any relatively safe opportunity and
 efficacious means to spread the gospel of Communism.  They probably
 also feel that ground has been won is an historical trust and ought
 to be preserved to the Kingdom.  They would say, and probably mean
 it, that in the present phase Communist policy must be prudent and
 pragmatic and that more can be gamed by reasonableness, caution, and
 diplomacy than by adventures, bluster, ideological fundamentalism,
 and aggressive proselytism.  But beneath all the posing and the
 doctrinal contortions, there very likely has been an actual at-
 tenuation of the evangelical drive and of the ideological factor in
 Soviet policy-making.  This may not always be so because in large
 degree it is the consequence of an intellectual recognition of facts;
 as such it is always in danger of attack from self-appointed defenders
 of the faith.
 37.  Nevertheless, unless upset by some unforeseeable develop-
 ment in the USSR or in the world at large, the present posture of
 the Soviet leaders seems likely to persist for some time.  How long
 it will persist and what specific courses will be pursued will depend,
 - 28 -

 Approved For?ease 2006/09/25 : CIA-RDP79R0096*1100020027-9
 of course, upon events and apparent successes.  An increasingly
 troublesome and dangerous China will continue to push the Soviets
 toward greater prudence and amenability to detente and cooperation
 with the Western powers.  On the other hand, gross failures which
 could be attributed to lack of faith or to the duplicity and ag-
 gressiveness of the "imperialists" would cause the ideologues to
 reemerge.  In this connection, the Soviet military, who like most
 military believe themselves the keepers of the national myths, are
 perhaps more likely than the Soviet Communist Party to lead a drive
 back toward inflexibility and dogmatism.
 38.  The USSR disposes the only military power in the world
 which poses any strategic threat to the US, and it must remain for
 many years the focus of our foreign policies.  What we do or refrain
 from doing must perforce be examined in light of this fact.  But
 the world has become very complicated and so has our Soviet opponent.
 In these circumstances, the atmosphere and subtleties of behavior are
 often more important than acts.  Thus, the essential problem of the
 US in dealing with the USSR and with the other areas of the world
 is to measure the effect which both the deed and the atmosphere
 will create in the minds of the Soviet leaders and of those others
 who might be affected.  The existence of a Soviet capability to do
 us enormous damage seems likely to last indefinitely, but the possi-
 bility of its being used will depend greatly upon what we do and how

 we do it.  Their problem is at least as great as ours, for they fear
 not only our strategic power but the excesses of their Chinese
 neighbor.  If their ideologues and the atmosphere permit it, they
 may become more anxious than we to find ways -- without giving up
 anything -- to slow the arms race and find adjustments which will
 keep the lids on the silos.
 VIII.  Prospects for Movement
 39.  If the various judgments made in the preceding para-
 graphs are essentially correct, then it is possible to conclude
 that the differences between the US and the USSR have been narrowed,
 at least for a time.  The atmosphere of US-Soviet relations has
 improved.   Except for the Soviet pressure upon the US to stop the
 bombing in North Vietnam and to find a way to resolve the Vietnam
 war, neither is pressing the other to give up any position it holds.
 While neither is satisfied with the status quo, neither seems pre-
 pared to do anything to change it except in evolutionary, slow-
 moving, and undramatic ways.
 40.  The Vietnamese war is by far the most troublesome
 question on the international scene and not only because of its
 :implications for US-Soviet relations.  While the US has no doubt
 demonstrated something to its allies about readiness to honor

 commitments and has provided a block to communist expansion in
 Asia behind which some strengthening of non-Communist political
 elements has occurred, it is also true that widening US participation
 in the conflict has complicated and to some degree weakened US re-
 lations with many of allies and friends.  US prestige has suffered
 because it has not been able to bring the conflict to an end, and
 US leadership is thought to be less than wise to have become com-
 mitted in an apparently hopeless morass.
 41.  On the scene in Vietnam the picture is complicated by
 the political situation in South Vietnam.  Despite some hopeful
 recent developments in contrast to the choas of 1964 and 1965, the
 political situation remains fragile.  On the war front, the Viet Cone
 have certain inherent advantages which the whole paraphrenalia of
 US military power has not and may not be able to counter.  On the
 international scene, the world has come to accept limited war;
 since we limited our objectives to Vietnam and have limited our
 means, we were able to enter in force without unacceptable risks.
 But, while limiting our objectives geographically, we have not
 limited our local political objectives to an extent which would
 permit a graceful exit.  Thus, unless there is a collapse of will
 on the other side (and no persuasive signs of this have appeared)
 we may be obliged to fight indefinitely in the hope of establishing
 at some point a sufficient degree of security and political order
 to permit a claim of having achieved certain redefined limited
 objectives.

 42.  So long as the war continues it will cloud US-Soviet
 relations.   Neither the Soviet position in the international Com-
 munist movement nor the Soviet leaders' position at home would at
 present permit any but the most limited movement toward detente in
 US-Soviet relations.  Moreover, if the US should feel obliged to
 widen the means or the geographical scope of military operations,
 the Soviet leaders would probably feel obliged to alter the atmosphere
 of US-Soviet relations, and some at least would probably alter their
 current appreciation of American political dynamics and American
 policy.
 43.  The problem of the Vietnam war aside, and assuming the
 Soviets continue on their current prudent and reasonable course,
 the main factors in US-Soviet relations derive from two fears.  One
 is the fear that the other will fall under the political leadership
 of ideologues or activists who will seek by aggressive means to
 alter the status quo or to achieve political domination of some
 soft area of the world.  The other fear is that, in such circumt
 stances or independent of them, one side or the other might con-
 clude that it needed to or was able to initiate nuclear war against
 the other.  For the present, there does not seem to be very much that
 can be done about this.  In the present atmosphere no significant
 agreements regarding a curtailment of the arms race appear likely;
 this unlikelihood might persist for some time even if the Vietnam

 war should suddenly come to an end.  On the other hand, the
 atmosphere of US-Soviet relations is such that some kinds of
 parallel actions, with or without unwritten understandings, might
 be possible.
 44.  But, regardless of what policy or posture on the part
 of  these two great powers might exist at any particular time,
 competition between them is something which is likely to persist
 indefinitely.  While competition in the cruder forms of economic
 and military aid might be coming to end, other forms of competition
 seem inescapable.  Smaller and weaker nations will turn to the great
 powers for political support and other types of assistance; sub-
 version and diplomacy will go on trying to extend areas of influence;
 both nations must continue in their efforts to present themselves to
 the world as more advanced, more honorable, and more attuned to the
 needs and virtues of mankind than the other.  Neither can afford
 to appear tired, decadent, or faithless.
 45.  The US is not in any serious danger of losing its
 powerful position in world affairs.  Its military and economic
 power will remain highly respected.  US technological superiority
 in industry is unchallenged.  But, the US has become and may in-
 creasingly become more isolated, both economically and politically,

 from Europe and from some other countries where it has enjoyed
 especial regard and prestige.  This does not mean that the USSR
 will achieve a concomitant rise in prestige and authority, for
 the tendency in the world today is not to transfer respect from
 one center of power to another but to reach for self-respect.  In
 a broad historical sense, this indeed may be progress.
 46.  All things considered, one cannot identify any major
 ways in which the structure of world power seems likely to change
 during the next few years.  The Vietnam war is inhibiting much
 movement in US-Soviet relations; any basic change is Europe will
 mature only slowly; it may be some years before the new shape of
 China emerges; the newer nations are so immerded in their own
 difficulties as to prevent the emergence of any new and significant
 center of power.
 47.  Beyond these few years, however, a number of changes
 will materialize which could have a profound effect.  In one way
 or another all wars and revolutions must come to an end.  How the
 Vietnam war progresses and is terminated, how China's revolution
 develops and how this development affects China's relations with
 the other world powers, how the  .iropean impulse toward change
 actually progresses over time, what calamities hunger and poverty

 in the poorer nations produce, what happens to the arms race --
 ail these are essentially unpredictable.  Some can be dealt with by
 coacioizd action, and some cannot.  In either. case, some could lead
 to a world aatabtrophe if the complexities and interactions of deeds
 and event, are not understood and appreciated.  Fear or expectation
 of some event might bring it about by preparations or actions designed
 to counter it, and sat-generated problems thus created.  But the
 world today seems perhaps less prone to this than in the past.  World
 leaders may have blundered in the years since World War II, but they
 have also learned.  Though nations have armed themselves on an un-
 precedented scale, they have also become prfizdent.
