 LEBANON: Situation Report
 Fighting involving tank and artillery fire continued
 in Beirut yesterday.  The intervention of the Syrian-dominated
 Arab peacekeeping force so far seems to have aggravated the
 situation instead of calming it. The Syrians have shelled the
 headquarters of the two major Christian parties, the National
 Liberal Party and the Phalange,  provoking fears that they are
 attempting to take over one of the Christian quarters of the
 city. Christian leaders have called on their followers to stop
 firing, but they obviously are not in full control of their
 forces.
 National Liberal militia leader Dany Shamun told a
 US Embassy official yesterday that he has been telling his
 people not to fire on the Syrians and to stay off the streets,
 but that it is impossible to prevent individual militiamen from
 reacting when sniper fire hits their neighborhood. He also
 charged that leaders of the Phalange militia, despite their
 public statements, are deliberately encouraging--or at least
 allowing--continued sniper fire against the Syrians.
 Syria's strategy is to try to isolate and surround
 L__         J
 pockets of resistance and then use whatever force is necessary.
 Although Syrian officers have been told to avoid causing ex-
 tensive civilian casualties, Syrian tactics are often clumsy
 and heavyhanded. Local unit commanders, moreover, may continue
 to retaliate sharply as they suffer additional casualties.
 I         I The Syrians want to avoid a major confrontation in
 Beirut t at might offer Israel an excuse to intervene or to
 prolong its occupation of southern Lebanon. They will probably
 try to calm the situation through further consultations with
 Lebanese political and militia officials.
 The security situation within the Muslim section of
 Beirut, meanwhile, has deteriorated to its lowest level since
 countrywide fighting stopped in 1976; there have been several

 kidnapings in the past week, and miscellaneous shooting incidents
 occur daily. Given the atmosphere of tension prevailing through-
 out the city, there is a chance that the fighting will continue
 to spread and become increasingly difficult to bring under con-
 trol. 7_                            I
 ISRAEL:   Peace Movement Emerging
 The emergence in recent weeks of a movement in Israel
 that favors more flexible peace proposals, and the Begin govern-
 ment's sponsorship of a counter organization,  have had the ef-
 fect of undermining the solidarity that the government has
 sought to foster and may give rise to a more substantive na-
 tional debate on the peace process.  Until now,  public discus-
 sion has tended to focus primarily on Prime Minister Begin's
 tactical blunders and on the strains in US-Israeli relations,
 rather than on the issues themselves.
 The leaders of the "Peace Now" movement, which kicked
 off its campaign on 1 April with a large outdoor rally in Tel
 Aviv, hope to bring pressure on Begin to reassess his peace
 proposals. To maintain momentum, they have initiated signature
 and letter-writing campaigns. Another mass rally is being
 planned for 30 April in Jerusalem under the guidance of some
 Mapam party leaders. Mapam--the leftist ally of the opposition
 Labor Party--appears to be deeply involved in the nascent move-
 ment, but Labor Party leaders are keeping a discreet distance
 for the time being.
 I            After some hesitation,  leaders of the Herut Party--
 Begin s faction of the Likud bloc--have organized a counter or-
 ganization, the "Movement for a Secure Peace." The brief delay
 reflected concern in Herut that a countercampaign would focus
 greater public attention on the "Peace Now" movement and invite
 unfavorable comparisons if the "Secure Peace" movement failed
 to match the public support its rival had attracted. Herut
 leaders apparently concluded that leaving the field entirely
 to "Peace Now" could have far worse consequences.
 As a result, the counter movement has begun its own
 letter-writing and signature campaigns in support of government
 policy.  In addition, it has announced that it will hold a rally
 this Saturday night in the same square in Tel Aviv that was
 used for the first "Peace Now" demonstration.

 I         I  The "Peace Now" Movement is almost certain to step up
 i s own efforts in response and is likely to become more shrill
 in its criticism of Begin and his policies. The US Embassy
 believes this incipient polarization could give impetus to a
 fuller debate on peace issues;  the debate has thus far lacked
 '
 s success
 focus and clarity,  thanks largely to the government
 nhscuring internal differences over specific issues.
 NAMIBIA: Nujoma's Position
 I                 The leader of the South-West Africa People's Or-
 ganization, Sam Nujoma,  told the US Ambassador to Nigeria this
 week that SWAPO is prepared to resume negotiations at any time
 with the Western five-power contact group on its proposals for
 a peaceful transition to independence in Namibia.  Nujoma indi-
 cated that SWAPO would soon respond formally to the Western
 proposals, but he showed little flexibility on several unre-
 solved issues.
 ~  Nujoma arrived in Lagos on Monday, following visits
 to India, Iraq, and Yugoslavia, to discuss the Western pro-
 posals with Nigerian Head of State Obasanjo. During a visit to
 the US Embassy, he said SWAPO was studying the proposals care-
 fully and would give a written response in New York soon.
 Nujoma said SWAPO is ready to resume talks with the
 1          11
 contact group, the South Africans, or both. Talks, he said,
 could be held on a "proximity" basis, as was the case in New
 York last February, or face to face with the South Africans.
 The SWAPO leader indicated, however, that his organ-
 ization still has major problems with the proposals. He said
 it could not accept the stationing of South African troops
 along Namibia's northern border or allow more than 1,500 South
 African troops to be stationed in southern Namibia near the
 border with South Africa.
 Nujoma said SWAPO would oppose

 any proposal that did not specify that the enclave was "part
 and parcel" of Namibia. He also repeated SWAPO's position that
 the UN Special Representative should have clear control over

 eral for the territory.

 When told that the contact group sent a copy of the
 proposals to the UN Security Council on Monday, Nujoma argued
 that such action was premature. He maintained that since SWAPO
 had not yet taken a final position on the proposals, it would
 not be able to "cooperate" with the Security Council.

 SOMALIA: Siad to Visit China
 President Siad evidently believes that the
 security situation in Somalia following Zast weekend's abortive
 coup attempt has stabilized enough to permit him to embark on
 a previously scheduled official visit to China. According to the
 New China News Agency,  the Somali leader will arrive in Peking
 tomorrow for talks that are expected to last several days.
 If he actually makes the trip this time, he will use
 the occasion to demonstrate defiance of Moscow and Havana
 while pleading his case for whatever assistance the Chinese
 may be willing to provide. He may also calculate that his
 trip to Peking might somehow prompt the US to be more forthcom-
 ing in providing military and political support for Somalia.
 L
 //Given their concern over the growth of Soviet

 and Cuban influence in the Horn, the Chinese have a vested

 Chinese economic technicians are currently working in Somalia.//
 The Chinese realize that their ability to help Siad
 materially is very limited. They probably will urge him to con-
 tinue pressing Western and moderate Arab governments for mili-
 tary and economic assistance.
 I         I  Siad thus is likely to leave Peking with little more
 than a reaffirmation of political support from the Chinese
 leadership. Even this may be somewhat circumscribed by Peking's
 desire to maintain normal relations with Ethiopia. Chinese
 speeches during the visit are likely to focus criticism on
 Moscow and Havana while eschewing any rhetoric that might ruf-
 fle the Ethiopians.

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Election
 President of the Dominican Republic BaZaguer,  70
 years old and nearly blind, has kicked off his campaign for
 the eleeion on 16 May--his fourth consecutive term--with sev--
 eral surprise choices for his ticket and some shopworn, but
 still effective, political moves to undercut the opposition.
 He clearly remains the country's most skillful politician and,
 barring further health problems, is the favorite to win re-
 election.
 Balaguer dumped his 69-year-old, two-term vice presi-
 dent in favor of 32-year-old Fernando Alvarez Bogaert, a former
 cabinet member who has headed the Ministries of Finance and
 Agriculture as well as the powerful State Sugar Council. Alvarez,
 a US-trained economist, is also a skilled Campaign manager who
 ran Balaguer's reelection efforts in 1970 and 1974.
 Approved For Release 2007/03/07 : CIA-RDP79T00975A030600010076-8
 Approved For RO
 The candidacy of Alvarez brings substantial strengths
 as well as some potential weaknesses to the Reformist Party
 ticket. His presence could help, at least partly, to blunt what
 will probably be the opposition's two major campaign issues--
 charges of continuismo under Balaguer and allegations the gov-
 ernment has mishandled the economy.
 With Alvarez, Balaguer can argue that he is opening
 up    e a ministration to younger, more dynamic figures and that
 he is finally grooming a successor. Moreover, Alvarez' back-
 ground in financial and sugar matters will help Balaguer defend
 his record and hold out hope of better economic days ahead.
 Alvarez, however,  is ambitious and could create divi-
 sions within the ruling political and military cliques. His at-
 tempts in 1975 to line up support for a presidential bid of
 his own threatened to lead to serious discord, and there are
 still strong objections to him within the Reformist Party.
 Alvarez has been careful to woo the influential armed
 orces. when he was head of the State Sugar Council,  for example,
 he subsidized the pay of lower ranking officers and granted
 others title to lucrative sugar-growing lands. Alvarez has,
 however, become identified with one of the country's two antag-
 onistic military factions,  and this could upset the delicate
 balance that Balaguer has managed to maintain.
 Alvarez' nomination is still not completely certain,
 even though it has been formally approved by the Electoral
 Commission and the deadline for candidacies has passed. Loop-
 holes in Dominican election laws could provide a pretext for
 a last-minute substitution,  should Balaguer so decide.
 The President's second surprise nomination is that
 o  his sister, Emma,  for mayor of the capital--the country's
 third most important post and a source of considerable funds
 and patronage. She is a well-known public figure in her own
 right, having headed a powerful, quasi-political charity organ-
 ization for the past five years, and will be a strong candi-
 date. Her social work, appeal to women voters, and obvious close
 identification with the President seem likely to offset either
 the probable charges of nepotism or any backlash from male
 voters.

 In coping with the opposition, Balaguer has turned
 to well-honed techniques. He had a hand in prompting dissidents
 from one opposition group to split and establish their own
 party--which has now nominated him. He has held on-again, off-
 again talks with former Vice President Lora, who broke with the
 President in 1970 to establish an opposition movement. By hold-
 ing out the possibility of a bargain that might have delivered
 the vice presidency to Lora, Balaguer has kept him on a politi-
 cal-string and helped demonstrate the bankruptcy of Lora's
 politics.
 Balaguer has also weaned a major figure away from his
 chief opposition, the Dominican Revolutionary Party, with the
 lure of a government post. The party nominated a moderate
 for president in an effort to blur its revolutionary leftist
 image of earlier years, but Balaguer has sought to undercut
 this effort by focusing his attacks on the party's longtime
 militant secretary general.

 UK: Scottish By-election
 //A parliamentary by-election today in Glasgow is
 being viewed as a test of strength between the Labor Party and
 the Scottish Nationalists. The campaign has focused on such
 questions as the economy and abortion, but an underlying issue
 is the Labor Party's plan for Scottish home rule. A loss by
 Labor would cause serious problems for the party as it heads
 toward a general election, widely expected as early as this
 fall.//
 //This is the first by-election in Scotland since
 the general election in October 1974, when the Scottish Na-
 tionalists demonstrated their political strength by winning 11
 seats in Parliament. In that election, the Labor candidate in
 the constituency that is voting today defeated his Nationalist
 rival by more than 7,000 votes. Labor's majority had been con-
 siderably larger, however, in the general election held in
 February 1974.//
 //Legislation dealing with devolution for Scotland,
 which Labor hopes will boost its fortunes there, has been passed
 by the House of Commons, although with amendments favored nei-
 ther by the government nor by the Scots. The bill could now be
 held up in the House of Lords. Labor Party leaders would see
 any such delay in passing the legislation and holding a refer-
 endum as strengthening the hand of the Nationalists.//
 //Labor usually has won the bulk of Scotland's 71
 seats in general elections. Any significant inroads by the
 Scottish Nationalists in today's by-election, or in local elec-
 tions scheduled for next month, would hurt Labor's chances in
 the next general election.

 CHINA: Political Infighting
 WaZZ posters in Peking attacking municipal party boss
 and Politburo member Wu Te are symptomatic of stepped-up Chinese
 political infighting in recent weeks. The Leadership earlier
 had apparently agreed to set aside its differences temporarily
 in the interest of holding a national science conference and
 the Fifth National People's Congress, China's parliament that
 closed early Last month after choosing a new government. With
 these meetings out of the way, the media have again begun at-
 tacking unnamed party officials for shifting their political
 allegiances over the years.
 Senior Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping is apparently
 e in     is campaign; he seems to be zeroing in on those who
 did not oppose his ouster in 1976 and who may have opposed his
 return the following year. Wu Te falls into this category.
 He has been attacked periodically in wall posters for his role
 in calling a halt to the April 1976 riots in Peking, which were
 an indirect show of support for Teng but which the now-
 discredited "gang of four" used as an excuse for his ouster.
 There is no evidence that authorities have attempted to prevent
 the public attacks on Wu, and some in the leadership may in
 fact have encouraged them.
 Attacks by the media on party officials who refuse
 to admit their past collaboration with the "gang of four" have
 been less direct than the wall poster criticism of Wu but have
 implications for others in the senior leadership. A spate of
 articles denouncing a continuing "coverup" in northeastern
 China could ultimately implicate Politburo members Chen Hsi-lien
 and Li Te-sheng, the past and present military commanders of
 the area. Chen may be the indirect target of attacks on a
 deputy commander who was appointed in 1972, when Chen still
 commanded the area. Chen is currently the subject of wall
 poster attacks in Shenyang, his former military headquarters.
 Teng Hsiao-ping probably is also the moving force
 behind an accelerated de-Maoization effort. The most visible
 consequence of this effort is that, in accordance with a recent
 party decision, quotations from Mao Tse-tung used in articles
 or published speeches will not be printed in boldface. This is
 a sharp departure from longstanding practice, and its signifi-
 cance will not be lost on the large readership of China's news-
 papers and periodicals. Media attacks on lavish funerals, the
 details of which parallel Mao's own, also seem to have negative
 implications for the Maoist legacy.

 grace. Party chairman Hua Kuo-feng, who personally received
 Mao's blessing as his successor, stands to lose ground. Hua
 seems to be trying to slow the de-Maoization; his speech at
 last month's science conference hewed close to the Maoist line,
 focusing on the need for scientists to maintain a correct po-
 litical attitude. By contrast, Teng, who spoke earlier, vir-
 tually promised scientists that their work would be measured
 by scientific, not political, standards.
 Sudan
 President Numayri's policy of reconciliation with con-
 servative opposition groups has resulted in an agreement by
 exiled opposition leader Sharif al-Hindi to dissolve his dissi-
 dent National Front Party and return to Sudan with around 300
 followers. Al-Hindi had remained in London after Sadiq al-Mahdi,
 leader of the Ansar sect, accepted Numayri's offer of amnesty
 and returned to Sudan last September.
 I Relatively free National Assembly elections in Feb-
 ruary in which conservatives won a sizable number of seats,  to-
 gether with the government's generous treatment of Sadiq, may
 have encouraged al-Hindi to return. Al-Hindi's action could help
 Numayri in his efforts to arrange the return of the 4,000 to
 6,000 Ansar dissidents living in Ethiopia and the 1,000 to
 2,000 in Libya. Libyan President Qadhafi is said to be consider-
 ing permitting the Ansar in Libya to leave, but there is no sign
 that Addis Ababa will permit those in Ethiopia to return home
 soon.
 Al-Hindi's return and the dissolution of his party
 could make it more difficult for Ethiopia to use the exiles there
 for anti-Sudanese purposes. Sudanese officials have feared that
 the Ethiopians would encourage guerrilla raids by the dissidents
 in retaliation for Sudan's aid to Eritrean separatists.
 A member of Chad's ruling Supreme Military Council
 was wounded Tuesday in a terrorist grenade attack. The govern-

 may be responsible. The attackers apparently were not members
 of the main group of Libyan-backed rebels, who occupy much of
 northern Chad and from whom terrorist attacks had been expected.
 This was the first rebel-inspired terrorist incident
 in Ndjamena since large-scale fighting began in Chad several
 months ago. Other attacks are likely to follow, especially if
 the apparent disagreement between the government and the Libyan-
 supported insurgents over the interpretation of the recently con-
 cluded peace talks continues to grow.

 //A NATO executive working group today will make an
 initial review of recommendations for implementing the long-term
 defense program proposed by President Carter at the NATO
 summit last year. Planning for the program will be a key
 topic at the meeting of defense ministers in mid-May and
 at the NATO summit in Washington at the end of that month.//
 //How much support the other member-states will
 give the program remains uncertain because of concerns over the
 length of time it covers  (1979 to 1993), a price tag that could
 approach $85.billion, and the innovative content, which requires
 an unprecedented degree of cooperation within NATO to promote
 standardization and compatibility of efforts in 10 major problem
 areas. Preliminary talks have shown that many NATO governments
 are reluctant to endorse the added high costs the program would
 entail.//
 //West Germany's position will be crucial in deter-
 mining what sort of long-term program can be implemented. The
 West Germans have cautioned the US not to press too hard too
 soon for flat commitments to key aspects of the program. The
 subject will be raised during Defense Secretary Brown's talks
 in Bonn beginning today.
