FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
SOUTHERN AFRICA: Reli-
able reports confirm 
that no progress was 
made toward uniting the 
fragmented Rhodesian 
nationalist movement at 
the two-day summit con-
ference of five south-
ern African presidents 
at Dar es Salaam. 
RHODESIA: The govern-
ment's security forces 
claim that they have 
inflicted heavy casual-
ties on the guerrillas, 
but the level of insur-
gent activity appar-
ently has not been af-
fected. 
The five presidents probably held 
off making any firm decisions on 
ways to strengthen the military 
effort against Rhodesia until they 
assess the results of Secretary 
Kissinger's meeting with South Af-
rican Prime Minister Vorster. 
The meeting at Dar es Salaam marked 
a broadening of the role of pres25X1 
dents Nyerere of Tanzania, Kaunda 
of Zambia, Machel of Mozambi ue 
and Khama of Botswana. 
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Vors125xl 
will brief Rhodesian Prime Minis-
ter Smith early next week on the 
results of his talks with Secre-
tary Kissinger. 
According to government figures, 
131 guerrillas were killed in Rho-
desia during August--the highest 
monthly total since the fighting 
began in 1972. Nevertheless, 
press reports indicate that the 
insurgents last week made one of 
their largest attacks gver. Some 
100 guerrillas are said to have 
followed up a mortar and rocket 
barrage by raiding a Rhodesian 
army outpost in northeast Rhodesia.

In southeastern Rhodesia, the guer-
rillas, according to press reports, 
shot down a helicopter last week. 
The Rhodesian air force now faces 
a serious shortage of trained hel-
icopter pilots following the with- 25X1 
drawal of South African pilots  
last month.

USSR - US - SOUTH AF-
RICA: Soviet commen-
tary on the US - South 
African talks in Zurich 
shows that Moscow is 
concerned about the 
possibility that "shut-
tle diplomacy" will be 
resumed. 
25X1 
Writing in Pravda on September 7, 
senior political commentator Yuriy 
Zhukov charged that the US role in 
Africa may cause "new dangerous 
complications" in the area and 
that Secretary Kissinger was try-
ing to maintain "racists" in power. 
The chief of the USA Institute's 
Foreign Policy Department remarked 
to a US embassy official on Sep-
tember 7 that he personally viewed 
the Secretary's activities in Af-
rica as a "carbon copy" of the US 
approach in the Middle East.

connected commentator who usually 
deals with major East-West issues--

LEBANON: The Syrians 
apparently are stress-
ing in their talks 
with Lebanese leaders 
this week the need for 
full cooperation with 
the future government 
of president-elect 
Sarkis. 
strongly suggests that more than 
just African issues are being ad-
dressed. Zhukov's direct criti-
cism of Secretary Kissinger ap-
pears to be part of an increasing 
inclination on the part of the So-
viets to find fault with the US 
administration in general and the 
Secretary's role in particular. 
* * * 
The Syrians want Sarkis to have 
sufficient stature to conduct 
meaningful negotiations. They 
recognize that this must come 
primarily from his ability to 
control his fellow Christians. 
Phalanges Party leader Jumayyil 
has been a supporter of Sarkis 
from the start; however, rightist 
leader Camille Shamun has a long-
standing personal grudge against 
him and is not in favor of any 
negotiations until the Palestin-
ians have been more thoroughly 
chastened. 
Before his departure for Damascus 
yesterday, Shamun apparently com-
mented publicly that current ef-
forts to find a new basis for ne-
gotiations will not be successful 
and that the fighting will esca-
late dramatically before Sarkis 
is able to take office. His re-
marks will reinforce the suspi-
cion among many Palestinians and 
Lebanese Muslims that the current 
round of talks in Damascus is lay-
ing the groundwork for another 
major Christian-Syrian offensive.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
Damascus' main concern 
at present is the in-
auguration of Sarkis, 
now officially sched-
uled for September 23, 
the expiration date of 
President Franjiyah's 
term. 
USSR-SYRIA-LEBANON: 
The USSR has issued an 
authoritative and rela-
tively moderate state-
ment on Lebanon to con-
vey its support for a 
negotiated settlement. 
25X1 
The Syrians would like to hold the 
swearing-in ceremony within Leba-
nese territory controlled by Syr-
ian forces, thus allowing some 25 
members of the Lebanese parliament 
now in Syria to attend. Several 
sites in Beirut reportedly also 
are under consideration, but the 
Syrians fear a ceremony there would 
create a potentially explosive se-
curity situation. Moreover, if 
significant numbers of parliamen-
tary deputies are prevented from 
attending the session, Sarkis' in-
auguration could be challenged on 
legal grounds. 
The Pravda statement on September 
7, signed "Observer" to signify 
Kremlin endorsement, criticizes 
both the Syrian intervention in 
Lebanon and, for the first time, 
"leftist elements" within the Pal-
estinian movement. The statement 
denounces the Palestinian leftists 
for "rejecting out of hand any 
peaceful proposals" and calls at-
tention to the deep split within 
the Palestinian leadership regard-
ing negotiations. This will be 
interpreted by Arafat as an endorse-
ment of his position.

OPEC: 
FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
The article?Moscow's strongest 
criticism so far of the interven-
tion of Syrian forces in Lebanon--
terms the Syrian decision "harm-
ful." The Soviets are still re-
fraining from forthrightly calling 
for withdrawal and instead are ex-
pressing tacit agreement with the 
demands of "many Arab countries 
and other countries" that these 
forces leave. Soviet commentary 
is obviously bent on antagonizing 
Damascus no more than necessary. 
Unlike the last Observer piece on 
Lebanon in April, the current ar-
ticle does not go out of its way 
to castigate Israel or to raise 
the possibility of US military in-
tervention. 
25X1 
We reported two 
weeks ago that the Saudis had as-
sured Venezuela that they would 
go along with a price increase of 
from 10 to 15 percent. At about 
that time the most influential 
OPEC ministers--from Saudi Arabia, 
Iran, Venezuela, and possibly Al-
geria--met in Saudi Arabia and 
discussed the December price in-
crease. 
Subsequently, a high Iranian offi-
cial told the US embassy in Tehran 
that a 15- to 18-percent rise is 
called for. 
In the hope of avoiding the kind 
of acrimony that developed at the 
OPEC meeting in Bali in May, the 
ministers who met recently in 
Saudi Arabia probably negotiated 
the approximate range of the price 
rise to be made in December.

EGYPT-LIBYA: Prelimi-
nary analysis of satel-
lite photography 
in 1.cates 
that Egypt is contin-
uing its military 
build-up along the Lib-
yan border, but at a 
slower pace than ear-
lier indications had 
Zed us to believe. 
PORTUGAL: Prime Minis-
ter Soares may be losing 
confidence in his gov-
ernment's ability to 
resolve Portugal's 
problems. 
Unless there is a shift in the 
Saudi price position in the in-
terim, the full OPEC meeting in 
December probably will agree to a 
price increase of at least 10 per-
cent and most likely 15 percent. 
Egypt is still in the early stages 25X1 
of a build-up of ground forces. 25X1 
Photography shows a substantial 
increase in logistics support 
equipment at Sollum, Sidi Barrani, 
and Matruh. 
There is no build-up of forces at 
Siwah, the area from which/  
 /they 
might launch a major armored drive 
into Libyan territory. No new 
ground combat units were detected 
on the photography. 
Construction continues on the new 
airfield at Sidi Barrani but not 
at the rapid pace observed in July 
photography. The Egyptians appear 
to be preparing to pave the air-
field's runway. Its completion 
would give Cairo two airfields in 
the west capable of handling sus-
tained air combat operations. 
Soares apparently feels very frus-
trated and pessimistic over the 
political-economic situation. Yes-
terday he postponed the announce-
ment of the first of a series of 
economic austerity measures, prob-
ably because of the difficulty he 
has had in getting his cabinet to 
agree on the proposals. He is 
said to be particularly disturbed

ETHIOPIA: 
by the refusal of his labor and 
agriculture ministers to cooperate 
in a stabilization program and by 
the government's failure to at-
tract private investment. 
The agricultural and labor areas 
are especially significant because 
they are being watched closely for 
indications of the government's 
ability to reduce entrenched Com-
munist influence. 
Last week Soares told Ambassador 
Carlucci that Portugal requires a 
$300-million balance-of-payments 
support loan from the US this year 
and an additional $1 billion in 
1977. Soares said his government 
agrees with US suggestions concern-
ing economic recovery measures and 
urgently needs a loan commitment 
to permit development of an appro-
priate program. He conceded, how-
ever, that his advisers are evenly 
divided on the important question 
of devaluation.

Recently appointed So-
viet First Deputy Pre-
mier Tikhonov will han-
dle foreign economic 
relations. 
Poland's current troub-
les have Zed to specu-
lation about party 
chief Gierek's future. 
NOTES 
According to an official of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the 
USSR attaches great importance to 
this field. Premier Kosygin has 
exercised overall direction of 
foreign economic relations. In 
view of Kosygin's illness, it 
would seem logical that Tikhonov 
should pick up this responsibility. 
* * * 
Several influential Polish jour-
nalists recently told a US diplo-
mat that they were "absolutely fed 
up" with the Gierek regime, al-
though they said Gierek himself 
has "good intentions." One pre-
dicted that Prime Minister Jaros-
zewicz would be the first to go 
and implied that within a year 
Gierek would follow. 
According to our embassy in War-
saw, "the events of these last 
three months have left a shaken, 
dispirited Gierek regime pitted 
against a headstrong, distrustful 
and sullen population." Gierek 
undoubtedly is in a weaker posi-
tion now than he was before June. 
We have seen no indications, how-
ever, of any movement within the 
party or from the Soviets to un-
seat him.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
CHINA AFTER MAO 
The death of Mao Tse-tung, announced 
this morning, will not come as a trau-
matic surprise to the Chinese popu-
lace; the regime has been preparing 
the public for this event for some 
time through wide dissemination of 
photographs showing an increasingly 
aged and infirm Chairman. The polit-
ical repercussions of his demise, how-
ever, may well last for years. 
Mao had been an important member of the Chinese 
Communist Party since its founding in 1921, and 
Chairman since the mid-1930s. He has been the most 
important and the central reference point in the 
often confused politics of the party for much longer. 
Even when his will was partly thwarted by others in 
the Chinese leadership whose policy views differed 
from his own, his personality and programs could 
never be ignored; even his opponents claimed to be 
speaking in his name and to be carrying out his 
commands. 
As the dominating force in Chinese politics, a 
founder of the party, the formulator of the "Chin-
ese way" to communism, and the man who led the 
Chinese revolution to triumph, Mao will be irre-
placeable. There is no one on the Chinese scene 
today who even remotely commands the authority that 
has been accorded to him or who can easily assume 
the charismatic role of leader of the Chinese people 
he exercised for years. 
In the upper echelons of the party, however, the 
Chairman's death may come as something of a relief 
to a considerable number of second-level leaders. 
Mao's autocratic actions, suspiciousness, and some-
times erratic policy shifts were almost certainly 
resented by some of his associates and subordinates, 
particularly in the past decade. Some of these 
individuals are now likely to believe that more 
orderly and rational approaches to policy problems 
can be taken without fear of reprisals from the 
Chairman. 
Although Mao's place in the three-thousand-year-old 
history of the Chinese state is likely to loom large, 
one conspicuous failure in his long domination of 
the political scene is already glaringly evident and

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
is likely to have serious implications for the future. 
The Chairman did not succeed in providing for a widely 
acknowledged and recognized successor. Two desig-
nated successors, Liu Shao-chi and Lin Piao, fell by 
the wayside in 1966 and 1971 respectively. 
A third, Teng Hsiao-ping, who appeared in a posi-
tion to inherit much of Mao's authority if not the 
formal title of party chairman, was removed from 
all his high positions in early April. At the same 
time, the young Wang Hung-wen, who by virtue of his 
position in the hierarchy seemed to have a shot at 
succession to the formal title of party chairman--
but probably without much of the authority that 
normally could accrue to that post--was passed over 
for promotion last April. Finally, Chou En-lai, 
who by virtue of his experience and the respect ac-
corded him by most Chinese was perhaps the most 
logical of all possible successors to Mao, died last 
January. 
For several years the Chinese have talked about 
post-Mao arrangements in terms of a collegial group 
which would in effect share the Chairman's author-
ity among themselves. Such an arrangement is en-
tirely possible, at least in the short run, since 
it seems clear that no single individual has the 
stature to replace Mao in his full leadership 
capacity. 
It is possible, in fact, that the post of party 
chairman may now be retired, as a post that could 
only be held by the irreplaceable leader who has 
just died. The Nationalist Chinese on Taiwan fol-
lowed a similar procedure at the death of Chiang 
Kai-shek last year. In this case, Peking would 
probably revive the post of party secretary-general, 
which has been dormant since the start of the Cul-
tural Revolution, in order to provide a manager 
for party affairs. 
If the post of Chairman is to be filled, however, 
the most likely candidate for the job is Premier 
Hua Kuo-feng, who is now "first" party vice chairman, 
a new post created in early April, at the time of 
the fall of Teng Hsiao-ping. Hua is, however, a 
compromise figure who lacks a strong power base and 
who has operated at the center of power for only a 
few years. In his hands the post of chairman would 
be less important than it was when Mao occupied the po-
sition. Moreover, there are almost certainly a number 
of senior leaders of the party who would prefer that 
additional power and prestige did not accrue to Hua. 
There have been occasional covert attacks on Hua in the 
media since January, and his deputy in Hunan Province,

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
which he ran before coming to Peking, has been under 
heavy political pressure for several months. 
It is possible, therefore, that Hua's elevation to 
the chairmanship could be contested, and in fact 
any decision to fill the post might be put off for 
some time. It is also possible that if Hua were 
elevated to the chairmanship, he could be balanced 
off by a reconstitution of the post of secretary-
general. In this case a leading candidate for that 
job would be the leftist political boss of Shanghai, 
Chang Chun-chiao, who probably performs the func-
tions of secretary-general on a de facto basis at 
present. There is certain to be opposition to this 
appointment from the party's right wing, however. 
If the post of chairman were abolished, that of 
the current party vice chairman would also have to 
be abolished. In addition to Hua, the other vice 
chairmen are Wang Hung-wen, whose youth makes him 
suspect to many older party members and whose 
alignment with the left wing of the party is a 
major disability in the eyes of the rightists, and 
Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying, a long-time asso-
ciate of the late Chou En-lai who has been identi-
fied with the party's right wing and who came under 
criticism earlier this year for his vehement sup-
port of Teng Hsiao-ping. 
The balance these two men provide could be an argu-
ment for preserving the system of chairman and vice 
chairman. If, however, that system is scrapped, 
Hua Kuo-feng would be an obvious candidate for the 
secretary-general's post. Since Chang Chun-chaio 
also has claims on this job, a clash between the 
two could easily develop. 
Insofar as the principle of collegiality is followed 
by the Chinese, the three current vice chairmen, 
Chang Chun-chiao and Peking Military Region Com-
mander Chen Hsi-lien would almost certainly form 
the core of the collective. These five men are the 
most powerful in China today. They are not likely 
to work easily together, however. The left-right 
split between Yeh, on the one hand, and Wang and 
Chang, on the other, is already pronounced, and as 
already noted, there is potential for serious fric-
tion between Chang and Hua.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
Chen, even more than Yeh, the defense minister, is 
likely to represent military interests in the col-
lective. Many important military figures have re-
sented the leftist leaders since the days of the 
Cultural Revolution, and to the degree that Chen 
speaks for them, he could come into conflict with 
Chang and Wang. Chen, however, appears to be an 
ambitious man whose personal interests could lead 
him into temporary and expedient alliances with any 
civilian faction. He is reported to have abandoned 
Teng Hsiao-ping at a crucial juncture last January, 
for example, and this move may have been an important 
factor in Teng's subsequent political demise. 
Latent factionalism among the ruling group is likely 
to come to the fore rather quickly, in fact. Mao's 
death occurs at a tense and rather fluid moment in 
Chinese politics. Repercussions from the Teng purge 
are still echoing throughout the country--in the 
provinces and in Peking. The fissure between the 
party's right and left wings is perhaps wider than 
at any time since the late stages of the Cultural 
Revolution, and the issue of relations between the 
military and civilian members of the party is still 
not fully resolved. Since the attacks on Teng began, 
the army has begun to reemerge as an important fac-
tor in political affairs; this tendency is likely 
to become more pronounced in the wake of Mao's 
death. 
This confused situation makes a struggle among the 
various factions in the leadership all but inevita-
ble, and this struggle is likely to make itself 
manifest sooner rather than later. Mao has died at 
an unpropitious moment for the party's left wing, 
however. This group--a minority in the party and 
among the leadership--has not yet managed to achieve 
a solid and largely unassailable position, as it 
clearly hoped to do before the Chairman's death. 
Mao had his differences with the leftists in recent 
years, but they were at most times able to play on 
his obsessive concern for the development of an 
equalitarian China, and their enemies were inhibited 
by fear that Mao could intervene on their behalf in 
unexpected fashion. This inhibition has now been 
removed. 
One likely victim of these changed circumstances 
is Mao's wife, the termagant Chiang Ching. She is 
widely disliked, and without the Chairman's potential 
protection she may well fall by the wayside rather 
quickly. The left as a whole is in fact now in a

somewhat unenviable position. It is likely to be on 
the defense in whatever struggle develops in the wake 
of Mao's death. Nevertheless, leftist leaders, al-
though a minority, speak for a significant portion of 
the Chinese party, and the struggle, if it develops, 
is not likely to be resolved quickly. 
This fact, plus the obvious difficulty the Chinese 
will have in adjusting to a China without Mao, is 
likely to inhibit the development of new policy 
initiatives and to slow the implementation of poli-
cies already adopted, both in the domestic and 
foreign policy spheres. If the military gains an 
increased voice in policy-making, however, it is 
possible that Peking may become more receptive to 
the idea of moderating somewhat its unyielding op-
position to the USSR.
