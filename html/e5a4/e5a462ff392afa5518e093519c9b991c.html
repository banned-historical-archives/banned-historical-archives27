 China's Naval Modernization

 as of /5 March 1986     Whereas China's outer perimeter of naval defense traditionally reached

 only 500 kilometers from the coast, we believe that Beijing now envisions a
 defense that begins with submarines and long-range bombers some 900
 kilometers from the Chinese landmass. Chinese Navy planners hope to
 extend this perimeter and speak of a Navy that, by the 1990s, would be ca-
 pable of routine operations 2,000 kilometers off the coast.
 This new strategy, which allows greater depth to inflict losses, rests on new
 weapons, more aggressive patrolling by Chinese submarines, and an
 increased emphasis on professional training. Beijing is close to deploying
 two new antiship missiles-an Exocet-like, solid-propellant missile and an
 80- to 100-kilometer-range, liquid-propellant, air-to-surface missile-that
 will allow Chinese crews to launch missiles at extended ranges. In addition,
 the Chinese are buying Italian deep-diving torpedoes, building new
 frigates, and refitting older destroyers for antisubmarine warfare (ASW)
 operations.

 China's deficiencies in weapons development could translate into some new
 opportunities for the United States to build on the nascent US-PRC
 defense relationship.
 But any movement in this area is likely to stop short of strategic
 cooperation or close military coordination. In general, Beijing is still
 reluctant to take overt steps that would undercut its claim of pursuing an
 independent foreign policy or that would further complicate its relations
 with Moscow. And, in our view, the Chinese leadership remains divided
 over how far to go in forging direct military links to the United States.
 Beijing seeks technology rather than finished weapons and is often
 dismayed by the high costs-even with coproduction arrangements-and
 technological limits set by Washington on arms transfers. Beijing, there-
 fore, will seek to exploit the rift between the United States and other
 Western nations on arms sales to China by luring the Governments of
 Israel, Britain, Italy, and France.
 China's severely limited defense budget will continue to be the paramount
 constraint on the pace of weapons acquisitions from the West and overall
 naval modernization. With economic modernization continuing to take
 precedence, China's armed services compete vigorously for shares of a
 relatively small military procurement budget. Navy Commander Liu
 apparently has fought successfully for some new weapons production for
 the Navy, but the equally pressing needs for modernization of ground and
 air forces are likely to keep naval imports restricted to a very few key areas
 for many years.

 Although Beijing's more aggressive naval strategy is primarily defensive,
 the weapons under development will improve China's ability to project
 power against the weaker nations on its periphery. Taiwan will feel
 especially threatened-particularly as Beijing's capability to successfully
 blockade the island improves-and Taipei will seek additional US assis-
 tance to restore the naval balance. Concern among other non-Communist
 states in East Asia is also certain to grow; both Indonesia and Malaysia are
 wary of Beijing's growing regional strength, and Japan already has
 expressed reservations in COCOM to the transfer of advanced naval
 systems-including US torpedoes-to China. They are certain to voice
 their concern to Washington and to seek assurances on how much the
 United States is willing to help China. In the case of Vietnam, Hanoi may
 press the Soviet Union for more advanced warships, which Moscow
 probably will attempt to parlay into greater access to Cam Ranh Bay.
 Although naval modernization somewhat improves Beijing's power projec-
 tion options, China is in no position seriously to threaten US interests in the
 Pacific. Beijing appears to have no plans to build the large warships needed
 for distant power projection, and China's naval training is wholly defensive.
 Beijing has few illusions about
 building a "blue water" navy and, although the Chinese Navy hopes to ex-
 tend the range of its naval operations, its mission remains largely defensive.

 China's Naval Modernization
 and Its Implications for
 Moscow and Washington
 The upgrading of China's conventional armed forces
 continues to be an important objective for Chinese
 leader Deng Xiaoping. First enunciated in 1975,
 military modernization was slow until Deng's acces-
 sion to the chairmanship of the Central Military
 Commission in 1980. In 1981 Deng and his supporters
 instituted a new defense strategy for China's industri-
 al northeast that relies heavily on a modernized army
 with greater firepower and mobility.' Since then, the
 Military Commission has trimmed the size of the
 armed forces, dramatically improved military educa-
 tion and training, increased funding for weapons
 development, and improved the quality of weapons.
 Last year, for example, Beijing undertook sweeping
 changes to the standing military when the Military
 Commission announced atwo-year program of troop
 cuts to trim the armed forces by about 1 million men.
 China's desire to modernize its military is spurred by
 the impressive buildup of Soviet power in the Far
 East. Before 1964, 13 Soviet ground-combat divisions
 with some 2,500 tanks and armored vehicles were
 deployed on China's border. Today, there are 49
 active ground-combat divisions and over 30,000 tanks
 and armored vehicles there. As a result, China's
 ground forces had first priority for modern weapons
 and equipment. Over the past few years, Beijing has
 fielded new types of tanks, armored vehicles, self-
 propelled artillery, antitank missiles, and air defense
 weapon systems to improve its Army's chances
 against better equipped Soviet forces.
 The growth of Soviet naval forces in the Far East is
 also compelling Beijing to modernize its 1,300-ship
 Navy (see inset). High-ranking Chinese officials have
 publicly called for speeding up the modernization of
 the Navy to protect China's maritime interests, and
 Liu Huaqing, commander of the Chinese Navy and a
 key architect of China's naval modernization, has on
 several occasions described the building of a modern
 Navy as an urgent and strategic task in China's
 national defense construction. In January, Liu stated
 that the most important task in the Navy's modern-
 ization is the production and deployment of new, more
 sophisticated weapon systems. Despite limited fund-
 ing, these and other statements by Chinese political
 leaders suggest that Beijing is ready to provide re-
 sources for equipping the Navy with advanced hard-
 ware and for training a new generation of officers.
 Beijing Feels the Heat
 Beijing rarely voices its concern over Moscow's expan-
 sion of Pacific power, but is candid in closed-door
 discussions. While publicly claiming that the Soviet
 naval buildup is directed mainly against the United
 States and its allies in the Pacific, high-ranking
 Chinese officers have privately conceded that the
 buildup poses a grave threat to China. According to
 the   told
 US Navy Secretary Lehman last August that Viet-
 namese forces regularly exercise with the Soviet
 Navy, and that China views this collaboration as
 threatening to its sea lines of communication. Xu Xin,
 a deputy chief of general staff, expressed similar
 concerns to high-level US officials last November
 over the buildup in the Pacific Fleet and, in particu-
 lar, the growth of Soviet air and naval forces at Cam
 Ranh Bay.
 Moscow's warming relations with North Korea are
 also adding to China's perception of growing Soviet
 power in the region. Beijing International Institute of
 Strategic Studies (BIISS) officials complained to US
 visitors last fall about Soviet intelligence collection
 flights over North Korea and admitted that Beijing
 had scrambled fighters in reaction to the Soviet

 To implement this more forward-looking defense
 strategy, Beijing has embarked on an impressive
 reform of its training procedures and organization.
 Naval schools and academies closed during the 12
 years of the Cultural Revolution (1965-76) have re-
 opened; younger, better educated officers are being
 selected to captain the Navy's warships; and the
 Chinese Navy is training in large-scale, complex
 exercises. The progress in naval training was summed
 up in the official Chinese media in January: "The
 good situation of naval fleet training in 1985 was rare
 in previous years. In particular, the Navy attached
 importance to long cruise and redeployment training,
 intensified combined tactical exercises, and further
 enhanced the combat effectiveness of naval fleets."
 Before 1982, the Chinese Navy had little experience
 in large exercises featuring air, surface, and subsur-
 face units in opposing forces scenarios. For the first
 time, in the spring of 1982, and again in both the
 spring and fall of 1983, Beijing conducted large,
 multiforce exercises in the North Sea Fleet:

 ASM provides naval aircraft with the capability to
 strike at enemy warships well out to sea-a key
 requirement of active defense.
 China is also fielding a new antiship missile for its
 warships. Under development since 1978, the solid-
 propellant CSS-NX-4 is similar to the Frencet
 and, according to information obtained by th

 They are Beijing's"only credible naval defense against
 enemy task forces with standoff strike capability, and,
 by acquiring its own standoff capability, China's
 submarine fleet will be able to strike surface targets
 from 50 km away, instead of the 4 to 8 km required
 The middle and inner rings of China's defense zones
 also will be reinforced by the CSS-NX-4. Beijing is
 likely to replace many of the outdated liquid-propel-
 lant Styx missiles ^-China's main shipborne surface-
 to-surface missile-on Chinese destroyers, frigates,
 and missile patrol boats with the CSS-NX-4 because
 of its substantial advantages:
 ? The CSS-NX-4's sea-skimming abilities and its
 small size make it far more difficult to detect on
 approach and destroy.
 ? The greater safety of the CSS-NX-4's solid-
 propellant fuel raises the readiness level of ships
 that could fuel their Styx missiles only just before
 combat. The CSS-NX-4 may also allow reloading
 of launchers at sea.
 ? The CSS-NX-4's size-roughly half that of the
 Styx-allows Beijing to double the number of mis-
 sile launchers aboard each warship.
 In our judgment, the flexibility and versatility of the
 CSS-NX-4 will lead Beijing quickly to adapt the
 missile for air delivery. China's first air-launched
 ASM is based on the large, heavy Styx missile and is
 not suitable for lightweight fighters. With its smaller
 size and weight, the CSS-NX-4 not only will allow
 B-6 bombers to carry more missiles and attack multi-
 ple targets on a single mission, but it can also be
 mounted on smaller aircraft, such as China's A-5
 ground attack fighter
 ' The Chinese probably will retain the Styx missile-with its longer
 range and greater destructive power-for land-based coastal de-
 fense and possibly as a second missile system aboard larger surface
 combatants.)    I

 Air Defense Weapon Systems: A Major Weakness
 Despite progress in other areas, China has done little
 to improve its air defense weapons over the past few
 years. Chinese warships still possess no surface-to-air
 missiles, and Beijing's indigenous SAM program-
 under development since the mid-1970s-appears to
 be a failure. The Chinese Navy, however, is working
 to overcome some of its air defense weakness by the
 addition of radar-controlled, rapid-fire guns on its
 warships:
 ? In 1983, China fielded a copy of aSoviet-designed
 30-mm rapid-fire antiaircraft gun on an Osa-class
 patrol boat. The gun is capable of firing up to 1,000
 rounds per minute and is controlled by a new,
 indigenously designed fire-control radar. Although 25X1
 the Chinese have encountered difficulties in mating
 the gun to the radar, at least 13 Osas have been
 fitted with the new gun.
 modified Jianghu frig-   25X1
 ates also will carry four of the 30-mm guns.
 ? China's new frigates also will be equipped with a
 rapid-fire 100-mm gun based on French technology.
 China bought two 100-mm Compact rapid-fire guns
 from France in 1983 and may have adapted aspects
 of the French gun for a Chinese 100-mm gun
 already under development.          25X1
 suggests that Beijing has been testing a 100-mm
 gun at a munitions test center in northern China.

 Can the New Strategy Work?
 With the greater firepower and flexibility resulting
 from force modernization, we believe the Chinese
 Navy will be able to expand the scope of its naval
 operations and continue to meet its coastal defense
 mission. The aim of China's drive to modernize its
 Navy after all is modest, and Beijing knows it cannot

 that they do not intend to become a "bl"ue water"
 navy. Beijing's goal is instead to deter its adversaries
 by raising the cost of a seaborne attack on China, and
 the new strategy of active defense supports this aim
 by giving China's seaward defenses greater depth to
 inflict losses. In this regard, China's development of
 ? Although China's attempts to upgrade its subma-
 rines and helicopters with ASW sensors and the
 addition of helicopter-capable warships demonstrate
 Beijing's intention to improve its ASW capabilities,
 over the next 10 years the Navy probably will not be
 able to acquire the quantity and quality of ASW
 platforms to hunt Soviet submarines in deep waters
 away from China's continental shelf.
 ? Even though China's efforts to procure rapid-fire
 guns for its warships have provided some air defense
 capability against antiship missiles, without aship-

 Moreover, China does not permanently maintain
 ships or submarines on station at the entrances to
 the East and South China Seas, severely limiting
 early warning of Soviet naval moves.
 China, moreover, even with Western assistance proba-

 and quantitative improvements likely to take place in
 the Soviet Pacific Fleet over the next 10 years. These
 probably include:
 ? The introduction of more advanced nuclear-powered

 ? The delivery of additional Kirov-class cruisers and
 Sovremennyy- and Udaloy-class destroyers.
 ? The fielding of more long-range Backfire bombers
 to the Far East, followed by the deployment of
 Moscow's newest long-range bomber, the Blackjack.
 China's severely limited defense budget will continue
 to be the paramount constraint on the pace of weap-
 ons acquisitions from the West and overall naval
 modernization. With economic modernization con-
 tinuing to take precedence, China's armed services
 compete vigorously for shares of a relatively small
 military procurement budget. Navy Commander Liu
 apparently has fought successfully for some new
 weapons production for the Navy, but the equally
 pressing needs for modernization of ground and air
 forces are likely to keep naval imports restricted to a
 very few key areas for many years to come. Indige-
 nous weapons research and development still marked-
 ly lag more advanced nations like the Soviet Union,
 and the Chinese leadership probably will be content if
 it is able to simply maintain a credible seaward
 deterrent for the next decade.
 Implications for the United States
 We believe Beijing views the United States as an
 excellent source of military technology and as an
 important counterweight to Soviet naval power in
 East Asia. Although the Chinese Navy is eager to
 build on the senior naval contacts that have developed
 over the past two years, they are unlikely to lead to
 any form of strategic cooperation or close military
 coordination. For its part, Beijing believes that would
 undercut its claim of pursuing an independent foreign
 policy, further complicate its relations with Moscow,
 and-in our judgment-be a source of friction in the
 leadership. China's extreme sensitivities on this issue
 were demonstrated last spring when a scheduled US
 port call at Shanghai-the first since 1949-was
 canceled at the last moment, in part because it
 became entangled in other issues, including leadership
 politics. More recently, Chinese and US warships
 steamed together for the first time, but the Chinese
 Foreign Ministry downplayed the significance of the
 exercise and stressed that China is not allied with
 either superpower. Moreover, China recognizes that
 the United States intends to maintain a strong naval
 presence in the Pacific-from which Beijing bene-
 fits-regardless of China's actions.
 Nonetheless, Beijing's inability to keep pace with the
 growing sophistication of the Soviet Pacific Fleet will
 make the role of the United States in China's naval
 modernization increasingly important. In our judg-
 ment, as the Chinese Navy slowly absorbs the first of
 its Western technologies, the pressure on Beijing from
 the Chinese Navy probably will increase for the
 acquisition of even more sophisticated weapons and
 equipment not only for the ASW mission area, but
 also for more sensitive areas such as submarine
 warfare.
 If Washington fails to provide the level or type of
 technology desired by Beijing, however, China most
 certainly will try other channels. Moreover, Beijing is
 most interested in acquiring production technology,
 and arms deals that offer only finished weapon sys-
 tems are less attractive. To get the transfer of the
 most sophisticated technology for the lowest cost, we
 believe, Beijing will seek to further exploit the rift
 between the United States and other Western nations
 on arms sales to China by luring the Governments of
 Israel, Britain, France, and Italy to make concessions
 on technology transfer. One tactic favored by the
 Chinese is to stage a showdown among competing
 Western weapon systems. In 1983, for instance, Beij-
 ing held a "fly offl' among three Western defense
 contractors for aheavy-lift helicopter that netted
 Sikorsky a $150 million contract. A similar "fly offl'
 was held last year for attack helicopters.
 The US Posture in East Asia
 Although Beijing's naval strategy and the weapons
 desired from the West are primarily defensive,
 China's naval modernization will improve Beijing's
 capability to use its naval forces to project power
 against militarily weaker nations. In East Asia, Tai-
 wan and Vietnam will view these developments as
 most threatening, but diplomatic and
 modernization is a
 major concern to Japan and other East Asian nations.

 In our judgment, the strengthening of China's naval
 capabilities will improve Beijing's chances of success-
 fully blockading Taiwan.s As a result, Taipei will seek
 means-including heavier lobbying of the United
 States for more advanced weapons and equipment,
 such as FFG-7 frigates, Lamps ASW helicopters, and
 PC-3 Orion aircraft-to restore the naval balance in
 the Taiwan Strait
 Hanoi likewise will seek to improve its naval forces, in
 our opinion, by requesting more warships and training
 from the Soviet Union, possibly allowing Moscow
 greater access to Cam Ranh Bay in return. Japan and
 other East Asian nations, on the other hand, are likely
 to express their concern and seek assurances from
 Washington on how far the United States will go on
 military technology transfer to Beijing. Japan already
 has expressed reservations in COCOM about the
 transfer of certain types of naval equipment to Bei-
 jing-including US torpedoes and British sea mines-
 and more advanced sales are sure to elicit sharp
 protests. Both Indonesia and Malaysia, while seeking
 to improve their relations with Beijing, plan to up-
 grade their air and naval forces with advanced fight-
 ers and warships from the West, and are likely to seek
 US assistance in doing so.
 No Direct Threat to US Naval Power
 Although naval modernization somewhat improves
 China's capability to project power, Beijing lacks the
 weapons, doctrine, and experience to seriously threat-
 China built its last amphibious warfare
 Vietnamese Navy despite two years of artillery and
 infantry clashes along the Sino-Vietnamese border.
