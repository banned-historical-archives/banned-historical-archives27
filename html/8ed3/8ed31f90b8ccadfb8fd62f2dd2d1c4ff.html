 For 20 years the lives of the Chinese people have been bound up to an almost
 immeasurable degree with the revolutionary vision of one man, Mao Tse-tung. Both the
 Chinese Communists' considerable successes during this period and their disastrous failures
 have stemmed from his sometimes startling views and his stubborn will. For although Mao
 was able to transmute the Communists from a small band of hunted revolutionaries into a
 dynamic, aggressive, totalitarian ruling elite, the policies with which he has been most closely
 identified over the years have often hindered the solution of problems and in many ways
 frustrated China's transformation into a modern industrial state.
 Ten years ago the Chinese Communists were loudly congratulating themselves on having
 converted their once prostrate and humiliated nation into a strong, unified state that had not
 only altered the balance of power in Asia but had also assumed a position of primary
 importance in the strategic thinking of the world's superpowers. At that time China had made
 a good start on overcoming such traditional problems as overpopulation, low levels of living,
 illiteracy, and lack of technical skills. Even then, however, Mao was insisting on programs that
 would go far to cancel out the promising beginning.
 In the past ten years Mao's programs have imposed severe strains on China's political
 system, causing serious dislocations in the economy and contributing to increasing cynicism
 and disillusionment among large segments of the population. During the last three years,
 especially, China has very nearly been torn apart by a convulsion brought on largely by Mao's
 belief in the necessity of uninterrupted revolution as he strives to achieve his vision of a
 selfless, equalitarian, and thoroughly communized China. During these three years-the
 so-called Cultural Revolution-Mao and his closest associates have demonstrated that they are
 willing, at least for a time, to sacrifice immediate gains in building up their underdeveloped
 nation in order to achieve a greater degree of ideological purity.
 The Cultural Revolution has shattered the Communist Party and government apparatus,
 eroding national authority as never before in the two decades of communism. It has raised
 serious questions about the orderly transfer of power after Mao goes and has cast a heavy pall
 over the future of China's development. Today, China stands badly in need of a period of
 internal peace in which to repair the damage wrought by the excesses of the Cultural
 Revolution.
 On balance, the trend during the past year has been toward regaining stability, but the
 task of reconstruction has barely begun, and the direction in which the regime will move is
 still not certain. China's leadership today does not even present the appearance of the
 monolith that Peking managed to parade before the world for much of the past 20 years.
 Instead, it is plainly a group of uncongenial personalities whose future decisions-with or
 without Mao-are not likely to be easily reached nor readily predictable. Finally, Mao
 -himself, as long as he is able to exercise power, could decide at any time that a further push is
 necessary to ensure the success of a revolution he regards as uniquely his own creation.

 "All of our achievements in the past 20 years
 represent the great victory of Chairman Mao's
 revolutionary line. Chairman Mao has taught
 us: 'We are undertaking an extremely glorious
 and great task never accomplished before. We
 must attain our objective; we can attain our
 objective. ' "
 Chou En-lai, National Day 1969
 China today is a far cry from the exhausted,
 war-torn nation that Mao Tse-tung and his Chi-
 nese Communist Party took over in 1949. It had
 suffered through nearly a century of external
 aggression, exploitation, and internal strife. No
 truly effective central government had existed in
 China since the mid-19th century, and the com-
 bination of the Japanese invasion and the Com-
 munist-Kuomintang civil war had wrecked even
 what little central control existed in the country.
 When Mao proclaimed the Chinese People's
 Republic on 1 October 1949, China's agricultural
 system was backward and inadequate. Its trans-
 portation and communications systems were dis-
 Special Report
 rupted, the monetary and financial systems a
 shambles, its industrial capacity minuscule, and
 regionalism, an endemic problem, flourishing. The
 people of China were culturally and psychologi-
 cally in shock as a result of the impact of the
 20th century Western world on their Confucian
 traditions.
 Mao intended to demonstrate to the world
 the superiority of his version of Marxism-Lenin-
 ism, and he moved quickly to implement a pro-
 gram he believed would overcome China's prob-
 lems and make his country into a major world
 power. By 1957 China was well ordered, the
 party cadre had high esprit, and the people for
 the first time in a century had a regime to be
 proud of, the involvement in the Korean War
 having been managed well enough to make it
 seem a victory. Mao was the symbol of triumph
 over foreign aggression and of a better life at
 home, the very embodiment of the new China.
 Signs of basic flaws in the blueprint for
 building the new China were already showing by
 1957, however, when Mao's "hundred flowers"
 campaign revealed widespread opposition to his
 policies among the intellectuals. The extraordi-
 nary "Great Leap Forward" Mao initiated in

 1958 further demonstrated his bent for radical
 policies. In essence, Mao's theory was that the
 mass mobilization of China's great labor force
 could overcome in a short period of time the
 nation's technological shortcomings and propel
 China's economy to a level equal to that of ad-
 vanced Western countries. The manifest failure of
 the Great Leap Forward in the following year
 brought about the first real challenge to Mao's
 authority from Defense Minister P'eng Te-huai.
 For some time P'eng apparently had been seri-
 ously disturbed by some of Mao's policies, in-
 cluding his feuding with Moscow, and at a party
 plenum in 1959 he came down hard on the dele-
 terious effects of the Great Leap on the national
 economy. Shortly thereafter, P'eng was replaced
 as defense minister by Lin Piao. Thus, Mao sur-
 vived that challenge, but his prestige, nonetheless,
 had been shaken.
 Mao became increasingly concerned during
 the early 1960s with what he deemed to be the
 insufficient political indoctrination of the popu-
 lace. After the failures of the Great Leap For-
 ward, Mao appears to have become even more
 firmly convinced that the remaking of men was
 the crucial task in ensuring the success of his
 revolution, more essential even than institutional
 change, technical and scientific modernization, or
 rapid industrialization. He did not lose all grasp of
 China's practical problems, but he became in-
 creasingly obsessed with ideological considera-
 tions and with the notion that Soviet-style "revi-
 sionism" was spreading in China and undermining
 his revolutionary accomplishments. This obses-
 sion grew as the Sino-Soviet split developed, par-
 ticularly after Soviet technicians were withdrawn
 in 1960. To counter this trend, Mao instituted a
 series of indoctrination campaigns in the 1960s
 designed to stir up "revolutionary ferment."
 Mao's concern over the decline in popular
 elan was not all imaginary. The failure of the leap
 Special Report
 forward had, in fact, widened the gap between his
 revolutionary goals and the interests of the peo-
 ple. A particularly important factor affecting
 Mao's next moves was that by the mid-1960s
 many of China's youth found the policies of the
 ruling establishment unsatisfactory. In this regard,
 the interests of the youth, who had been reared
 on revolutionary doctrine and who saw them-
 selves in the vanguard, and those of Mao were
 beginning to coincide. Mao became increasingly
 convinced that many officials, even some mem-
 bers of the inner circle of the party leadership,
 had strayed from the path he had laid out and
 had become conservative bureaucrats instead of
 revolutionaries. Mao's belief that his revolution
 was running aground and his growing distrust of
 some of his long-time colleagues combined to
 produce the phenomenon known as the Cultural
 Revolution.

 The  Cultural  Revolution, which was
 launched in the winter of 1965-66 and which
 resulted in a massive assault by youthful Red
 Guards and revolutionary activists on the entire
 party apparatus in late 1966, was a bizarre situa-
 tion in which the regime, in effect, conducted
 revolution against itself. Until that time all politi-
 cal authority was exercised in the name of the
 Chinese people by a small group at the head of
 the Chinese Communist Party who made all major
 policy decisions.
 The Cultural Revolution has brought great
 changes in the top leadership over the past several
 years. Many long-standing leaders with great pres-
 tige and authority have fallen by the wayside,
 including Mao's one-time heir apparent, Liu
 Shao-ch'i. The new leaders who replaced them
 have not all risen through normal party channels.
 Of the 14 most important people ruling China
 between 1965 and the ninth party congress in
 April 1969, fully half were not even formal mem-
 bers of the party central committee chosen at the
 eighth congress in 1956.
 The upshot of the drastic changes wrought
 by the Cultural Revolution has been very nearly

 to destroy the institutional structure that the
 once cohesive Communist leadership had pain-
 fully built up for almost two decades. Gangs of
 Red Guards dragged out party and government
 officials, dressed them in dunce caps, and forced
 them to recant their crimes. By early 1967, the
 party organization had been nearly dismantled,
 thereby making normal channels of command

 ineffective. The governmental structure has also
 been affected, and much of the system that had
 been in existence since shortly after the Commu-
 nists took power has been scrapped. Moreover,
 these tremendous political and institutional
 changes plunged China into violence and chaos
 for the better part of two years. Although Mao's
 voice in decision-making almost certainly re-
 mained decisive, the twists and turns of the Cul-
 tural Revolution, the alternation of phases of
 extreme radicalism and relative moderation, sug-
 gested that neither Mao nor other top leaders
 have fully understood or been able to control all
 the forces that were set loose. In effect, Mao's
 attack on the establishment unleashed destructive
 energies that have been channeled into competing
 interest groups, each striving for power-or sur-
 vival-at the expense of the others.
 On balance, however, even during the worst
 periods the country retained a certain cohesive-
 ness and sense of national unity. Several factors
 seem to account for this. The charisma of Mao
 Tse-tung remained a strong unifying influence.
 Moreover, while Mao seemed ready to tolerate a
 high level of disorder in order to gain his revolu-
 tionary aims, he was willing to curb radical ex-
 cesses at crucial junctures. Administrators and
 technicians such as Premier Chou En-lai and many
 of the military commanders were anxious to
 maintain national stability and never completely
 lost their capacity to exert moderating pressures.
 Perhaps most importantly, the People's Libera-
 tion Army-which remained intact as the only
 instrument of state control-was able to fill the
 administrative and political vacuum that had been
 created, particularly in the provinces.
 THE ARMY IN POLITICS
 One of the major results of the disorders
 associated with the Cultural Revolution has been
 the emergence of the People's Liberation Army as

 example, took over responsibility for running the
 state railways, the national communications sys-
 tem, the civil airlines, and the local security ap-
 paratus. In addition, it assumed a wide variety of
 administrative tasks connected with industrial and
 agricultural production that had previously been
 performed by the party and government. The
 military was also given the job of supporting
 Cultural Revolution activities in the factories and
 in the countryside-a task heretofore performed
 by party functionaries.
 As a result of being forced to assume the
 burdens formerly borne by China's enormous
 party and government apparatus, the army be-
 came  deeply embroiled  in  the  Cultural

 Revolution, and the cohesion of the military
 establishment was severely strained. The army
 was being ordered to carry on largely unfamiliar
 political work for which it was ill equipped; and
 by being thrown into the center of the political
 arena, it was subject to very great and conflicting
 pressures. Within the military establishment itself,
 long-standing strains between officers oriented to-
 ward political action and those more concerned
 with professional military problems were un-
 doubtedly exacerbated. Almost certainly there
 was some resistance within the army to direct
 involvement in the political struggle, inasmuch as
 this would tend to make the army's military mis-
 sion more difficult to carry out successfully. Fur-
 thermore, the purge of numerous senior officers
 in December 1966 and early January 1967 had
 probably already created new problems involving
 army loyalties and aroused dismay among the
 military leadership as a whole, as most had con-
 nections with some or all of the senior officers
 who had been brought down.
 Nevertheless, the army has remained gen-
 erally loyal and responsive to orders from Peking.
 It has had its hands full, however, in trying to run
 the provinces. Local military leaders have tended
 to play the situation by ear and have attempted
 to interpret shifts in the balance of forces in
 Peking to their advantage. Thus, they have often
 become deeply involved in divisive political dis-
 putes within their new areas of responsibilities. In
 some instances, for example, a swing toward
 radicalism in Peking would lead some com-
 manders to throw in their lot with the militant
 Red Guards in their localities. As the balance at
 the center shifted back toward moderation, they
 would find themselves opposed by other com-
 manders who were anxious to curb militant be-
 havior. For the most part, the multitude of
 administrative problems handled by the provincial
 military commanders has tended to reinforce
 their natural proclivity to espouse the administra-
 Special Report                               - 6 -
 tive virtues of order, rationality, and clear lines of
 authority and to opt for a return to stability.
 THE REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEES
 The central authorities remain committed to
 an eventual return to rule by a reconstructed
 party and government apparatus. In an effort to
 restore some semblance of civilian administration,
 the regime began setting up new provincial admin-
 istrations known as "revolutionary committees."
 These bodies are an amalgam of old party and
 government cadres-who had managed to survive
 the onslaughts of the Red Guards-military repre-
 sentatives, and representatives of Red Guard or-
 ganizations.
 The revolutionary committees produced to
 replace the old provincial administrations seem
 inherently unstable and still far from effective
 instruments of the government. In most instances
 they appear able to function only because local
 military commanders have assumed leading posi-
 tions in them. Although in many cases they are
 dominated by their military members, the fact
 that they are also composed both of old-line
 cadres and former Red Guards in practice often
 means that the committees are riven by factional
 quarrels and continued jockeying for power. This
 problem is magnified in many areas where sub-
 provincial revolutionary committees-the organs
 administering basic-level units such as counties,
 municipalities, factories, and communes-do not
 share the same political outlook as the leaders of
 their provincial committee.
 The problems within the revolutionary com-
 mittees are compounded in many areas because of
 continued attacks and agitation from Red Guard
 remnants. Many Red Guard groups were dis-
 banded in the summer of 1968, but it has become
 clear over the past year that a large number have
 been able to maintain their integrity under

 various guises. In some cases these elements are
 used as pressure groups by their former leaders
 who have been given places on the revolutionary
 committees. In other cases, Red Guard groups
 that have won no positions on the committees are
 putting pressure on local governments to bring
 their representatives into the establishment. The
 whole picture is further clouded by quarrels
 among the Red Guard remnants themselves,
 which have often produced open factional fight-
 ing. Furthermore, ambivalent attitudes in Peking
 toward the role of Red Guard factions have made
 it difficult for local authorities to curb their activ-
 ities. Thus, in spite of another crackdown on
 factional fighting ordered by the central authori-
 ties this July and August, the continuing power
 struggles that have affected nearly all of China's
 provinces are unlikely to abate soon. In turn, the
 capacity of the revolutionary committees to act
 as fully effective organs of government will con-
 tinue to be a question mark.
 The institutional destruction caused by the
 Cultural Revolution was enormous. The regime
 now faces the unprecedented task of reconstruc-
 ting the almost completely shattered party ap-
 paratus. Although tentatively begun in 1967, the
 rebuilding process has been painfully slow, and it
 has clearly been beset by innumerable squabbles
 and difficulties. Perhaps most importantly, the
 party's prestige and morale have been badly
 shaken by the excesses of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion, and it seems most unlikely that either can be
 easily restored. Many of the power struggles
 within the revolutionary committees will prob-
 ably be carried over into the party-building proc-
 ess because leading members of the committees
 are expected to constitute the core of the new
 party branches.
 The process is further complicated because
 Peking has not yet seen fit to clarify the relation-
 Special Report
 ship between the new party branches and the
 revolutionary committees. There are signs that
 the leadership may intend to replace the pre -
 Cultural Revolution parallel government and
 party structure with a single administrative struc-
 ture in which the party branches will be equiva-
 lent to the leadership of the revolutionary com-
 mittees. If this is so, it appears likely that the
 party members-probably many of them military
 men-will dominate the committees in coming
 months. The sharpest political battles in China
 may well be those over who controls the recon-
 structed party at the grass roots.
 After three years of "revolution," cynicism
 and despair have invaded important segments of

 Chinese society in addition to the party. The elan
 of government officials has been undermined by
 the Maoist attacks on "bureaucracy," and the
 future of many administrators is uncertain be-
 cause much of the government machinery built
 up over 20 years is unlikely to be rapidly re-
 stored. Although the army has enhanced its politi-
 cal authority during the Cultural Revolution,
 many professional military men are probably
 troubled over the future relationship between
 army and state and its possible adverse effects on
 military modernization. Many of China's youth-
 who found an outlet for their discontents in the
 Red Guard movement-were once again disillu-
 sioned when Peking dethroned the Red Guards in
 the summer of 1968 and shipped many students
 off permanently to labor in the countryside. The
 troubles of youth have been compounded because
 China's higher education system was closed down
 during the Cultural Revolution. Many who grad-
 uated even before 1966 have been unable to ob-
 tain jobs in which they can use their skills. The
 discontent of students is shared by their teachers.
 Furthermore, it is impossible to estimate the fu-
 ture effects of the damage done to the more
 educated segments of China's population by the
 pervasive anti-intellectualism that marked the
 Cultural Revolution.
 The task of restoring popular elan and of
 moving ahead with positive programs of long-
 range development will be long and difficult.
 Some initial progress has been made since the
 summer of 1968 when Peking unequivocally
 ordered the army to crack down on Red Guards
 and factional troublemakers in the provinces and
 began serious attempts to close out the Cultural
 Revolution and get on with reconstruction. Since
 then, a relative calm has fallen on the Chinese
 scene. Peking evidently felt the situation was suf-
 ficiently under control to move ahead in October
 1968 with its first party plenum since 1966. That
 plenum placed the official stamp on the removal
 Special Report
 from the party of Mao's former second in com-
 mand, Liu Shao-ch'i, and drafted a new party
 constitution that was approved at the long-over-
 due ninth party congress in April 1969. The
 leadership has shown itself still incapable of
 coming decisively to grips with many outstanding
 problems, however.
 In addition to difficulties connected with
 rebuilding local party and government appara-
 tuses, China's provinces are still beset by disloca-
 tions stemming from Peking's continued pursuit
 of a series of radical Maoist socioeconomic experi-
 ments introduced in late 1968. Last winter these
 programs ran into considerable resistance, and
 there have been signs since shortly before the
 ninth congress that Peking was adopting a more
 cautious approach to some of them. Nevertheless,
 the present muting of radical polemics does not
 appear to reflect a full-scale retreat to moderate,
 pragmatic policies but rather what seems to be an
 agreed compromise on a cautious, measured ap-
 proach to radical ends.
 Peking's present socioeconomic policies in-
 clude rural reforms, population transfers, and
 changes in administrative structure designed to
 overcome certain long-standing economic prob-
 lems and the deleterious impact of the Cultural
 Revolution on large sectors of the economy. The
 program is also aimed at achieving certain goals
 Mao believes are necessary to promote his unique
 vision of a "revolutionary" China.
 One of Peking's aims in pushing a wide range
 of rural reforms is to generate in the countryside
 new resources to provide a significant increase in
 farm production, which in turn will help to spur
 over-all economic development. This policy is
 reflected in attempts to foster output of tools and
 fertilizers in small, local plants to be financed

 largely by communes and brigades, and in educa-
 tional reforms and the transfer of skilled workers
 and intellectuals from cities to rural areas. The
 ultimate objective is to move rural China in the
 direction of greater collectivization while re-
 ducing the gap between rural and urban society.
 Since last fall, such plans as the proposed
 abolition of peasants' private plots (a major
 source of rural income) appear to have been
 sharply cut back because of strong popular resist-
 ance. Other programs, however, have been par-
 tially realized, and the direction in which the
 regime hopes to move is fairly clear. Peking, for
 example, is currently pushing the construction of
 production brigade and commune factories as a
 step toward greater collectivization. This pro-
 gram, in effect, constitutes a decentralization of
 industry and is designed to permit the state to
 draw upon the savings of local units to construct
 plants which, in turn, will largely serve the needs
 of agriculture. Moreover, by making a lower level
 unit such as a commune set up its own factories,
 the state is apparently seeking to preserve its
 limited national resources for defense and invest-
 ment in a few key fields, such as mining, petro-
 leum, and defense-related industries.
 A number of other forced programs comple-
 ment the regime's rural reform objective. A huge
 campaign to disperse the urban population to the
 countryside, possibly involving from 10 to 25
 million students, party cadres, civil servants,
 teachers, medical workers, industrial workers, and
 others, is being pushed hard. Most of the new-
 comers are to do farm work, while others will
 become teachers in new rural schools, work in
 local plants, or serve as public health personnel or
 "agro-technicians." Some of the reports on the
 number involved presumably include officials and
 other urban residents who do periodic, temporary
 stints at manual labor, but the bulk of the trans-
 fers is evidently intended to be permanent. There
 Special Report
 are doubtless several noneconomic motives be-
 hind Peking's assault on various urban groups,
 including ideological remolding, easing urban
 population pressures, or attempts to rid cities of
 potentially troublesome groups. Nonetheless,
 Peking is clearly trying to step up water con-
 servancy work, improve land, and boost agricul-
 tural output through the prodigal use of labor.
 Current efforts to reform China's educa-
 tional system are also closely related to Peking's
 rural and urban economic programs. Education in
 both town and country is being shortened and
 made largely vocational in nature. Authority over
 educational policy and selection of students will
 remain in official hands, but the cost of education
 is being transferred from the state to the farms
 and factories that are supposed to operate their
 own primary and middle schools. Most graduates
 of middle schools and universities in the future
 will go to jobs in rural areas, although a small
 number will go into industry. In keeping with the
 stress on agriculture, the number of children cur-
 rently enrolled in primary schools in rural areas
 appears to be greater than was true prior to the
 Cultural Revolution, and an effort is being made
 to spread "technical literacy" among both chil-
 dren and adults. University education, largely sus-
 pended for three years, is to be resumed, although
 in a truncated, mainly technical form.
 Some of the reforms individually make sense
 for the long run. Transferring large numbers of
 intellectuals, administrators, and even workers to
 the countryside, for example, may be one answer
 to the problem of modernizing the habits and
 attitudes of the peasants, a necessary preliminary
 to modernizing agriculture. Nevertheless, Peking's
 current campaigns have caused social and eco-
 nomic dislocations in town and countryside that
 have aroused widespread, albeit still low-level,
 popular disaffection. Dispersal to the countryside,
 for example, is highly unpopular in urban areas.

 The disruption of families, the lower standards of
 rural living, and the prospect of a lengthy rustica-
 tion have increased the personal insecurity of city
 residents and sparked both covert and overt resist-
 ance. There have also been numerous reports of
 peasant reluctance to accept the city dwellers,
 who place additional burdens on local food sup-
 plies and who make poor farmers in the bargain.
 The disaffection of both peasants and work-
 ers has also been increased by Peking's experimen-
 tation with reforms in rural and urban wage sys-
 tems, reducing the role of material incentives in
 favor of more "political inspiration." These ef-
 forts appear to be behind the growing number of
 reports late this summer of work slowdowns in
 communes and factories. Although the current
 social discontent has by no means reached danger-
 ous proportions, it seems to be contributing to
 popular malaise and apathy.
 Unless the more extreme aspects of the
 Maoist programs continue to be blunted, they are
 likely to undermine any constructive efforts to
 initiate long-range programs of development. At
 present, it appears that a number of policies may
 not even achieve the desired economic ends. The
 contribution that increased manpower could
 make to agricultural output, for example, seems
 fairly marginal, and whether there will be an
 intelligent use of available skills is problematical.
 What Chinese agriculture really needs is a careful,
 scientific, integrated, businesslike approach to the
 problems of seed, soils, water, fertilizers, and
 tools. Peking's current programs suggest that such
 an approach is not yet forthcoming.
 Indeed, except for weaponry and certain
 supporting industrial research and development,
 China appears to be turning away in many in-
 stances from science at a time when most of the
 major nations in the world are investing heavily in
 research and development, applied science, and

 the training of scientists to solve the problems of
 agriculture and industry. The current constriction
 of China's educational system appears to preclude
 the training of an adequate number of men suf-
 ficiently skilled to provide China's agriculture and
 industry with the foundation for impressive long-
 term developments. At this stage, however, at
 least the Maoists in Peking appear to accept this
 as part of the price that must be paid for puri-
 fying the revolution.
 The ninth congress published no clear policy
 guidelines, and the mixed composition of the new
 ruling bodies it produced may well inhibit the
 making and execution of national policy. The
 congress, for example, "elected" a new, 279-man
 ninth central committee, a conglomerate much
 larger and more unwieldy than its predecessor. Its
 composition clearly mirrors the political damage
 wrought by the Cultural Revolution as well as the
 new power realities existing at the time of the
 congress. Nearly 70 percent of the living members
 of the old central committee were excluded from
 the new body. In sharp contrast with the old
 committee, which was largely composed of mem-
 bers of the central party and government, fully 65
 percent of the new members were drawn from the
 provinces, reflecting the fact that during the Cul-
 tural Revolution the political center of gravity
 had to some extent shifted outward from the
 capital. Peking still remains the center of ultimate
 authority, but the make-up of the central com-
 mittee shows the system has changed somewhat
 in the past three years to accommodate outlying
 power centers. Finally, the heavy representation
 of military figures in the new body reflects the
 army's enhanced political role, and the smaller
 representation of party and government officials
 is in harmony with their reduced influence.
 Far more important to the political process
 in the future than the new central committee

 itself was its approval of a new, 25-man ruling
 politburo-the major decision-making body that
 had not functioned normally since late 1966. In
 the early stage of the Cultural Revolution, polit-
 buro membership had fluctuated wildly as leaders
 rose and fell with startling rapidity. By 1967,
 however, it became clear that ultimate decision-
 making authority rested with an inner circle of six
 leaders headed by Mao and Lin, abetted by an
 eight-man secondary elite-a grouping of uncon-
 genial allies that was designated as Mao's "prole-
 tarian headquarters." The existence of this head-
 quarters confirmed that the politburo as such was
 playing a negligible role in Chinese political affairs
 compared with what it did prior to the Cultural
 Revolution. Since the ninth congress, however,
 real political power almost certainly has once
 again gravitated to the politburo, obviating the
 need for such a special body as "Mao's proletarian
 headquarters" and signaling a return to a sem-
 blance of party normality at the top level.
 The inner core of the politburo is a five-man
 standing committee, the highest policymaking
 body in China. This small group has constituted
 the effective leadership of China since early in
 1967, functioning as a de facto politburo standing
 committee even during the most fluid and con-
 fusing periods of the Cultural Revolution. In addi-
 tion to Mao Tse-tung and Lin Piao, it consists of
 Premier Chou En-lai, party theoretician Ch'en
 Po-ta and secret police specialist, K'ang Sheng.
 Both Ch'en and K'ang have tended to encourage
 Mao to push his revolutionary ideas in the Cul-
 tural Revolution and to work against the estab-
 lished order. Thus the new standing committee is
 weighted toward the more radical elements.
 The full politburo reflects a better balance
 of the political equation that has emerged from
 the Cultural Revolution. In addition to the 13
 members of Mao's former "proletarian headquar-
 ters," several important military leaders who had
 never been part of the inner circle before were
 added to the new body. Their presence attests to
 the fact that the importance of the military in the
 present scheme of things now has been officially
 recognized and legitimized. It is worth noting that
 of the new military men, three have been drawn
 from the military regions outside of Peking where
 they have direct control over large bodies of
 troops. A fourth, Army Chief of Staff Huang
 Yung-sheng, is probably able to serve as an addi-
 tional influential spokesman for the regional mili-
 tary commanders. The presence of such impor-
 tant regional military leaders suggests that Mao
 and his inner circle on the standing committee
 will not take vital decisions without reference to
 the opinions of the military.
 These two loose groups-the military and the
 radicals-seem to occupy center stage at the
 moment. The government bureaucrats associated
 with Premier Chou En-lai-who were badly hit
 during the Cultural Revolution-do not appear to
 have made much of a comeback at the ninth
 congress. Moreover, China's technological, scien-
 tific, and administrative establishment now ap-
 pears to have little voice in top policy-making
 circles other than that of Chou himself.
 China's new group of top leaders lacks the
 homogeneity and shared experiences that charac-
 terized the top leadership prior to the Cultural
 Revolution. Patrons of the Red Guards serve side
 by side with military and government leaders
 who, during the Cultural Revolution, were re-
 sponsible for keeping the administrative ma-
 chinery operating and who thus tried to deflect
 the destructive impulses of the Red Guards. There
 is considerable evidence that some members of
 the present politburo worked to destroy others at
 the height of the Cultural Revolution. Direct at-
 tacks on subordinates of the top leaders also
 almost certainly have created some instability
 among the  regime elite and have fanned

 suspicions that cannot be easily eradicated. More-
 over, confused, imprecise directives issued in the
 course of the Cultural Revolution, vacillating poli-
 cies, and the difficulty the top leadership faced in
 agreeing on new leaders to run the various pro-
 vincial governments all suggest that considerable
 infighting and debates within the elite group have
 been continuing behind a facade of unity.
 Division over policy and suspicion as to
 motives among these top leaders could erupt into
 open struggle when Mao Tse-tung dies or becomes
 incapacitated. At present an open conflict seems
 unlikely, but although Lin Piao probably will
 initially assume Mao's mantle, the succession will
 not be an easy one, and some form of at least
 covert battling among Mao's survivors will almost
 inevitably take place. Outright removal of Mao
 from power while he remains politically vigorous
 seems most unlikely, but renewed attempts on
 the part of some leaders to block or dilute his
 policies may be made.
 Meanwhile, Mao himself continues to reign.
 He has been associated from the first with the
 Cultural Revolution in all its manifestations, and
 insofar as the denouement at the ninth party
 congress represented less than total victory for
 the "revolution"-and it seems clear that it did-
 then his prestige has suffered accordingly. But
 Mao's losses must be balanced against his gains.
 He has certainly disposed of many, if not all, of
 his real and putative enemies within the party
 machine, and even if all of the army leaders are
 not totally in step with him, he probably does not
 feel that the last several years have been a total
 failure.
 Solutions to many of China's developmental
 problems will have to come from within because
 of China's isolation on the international scene.

 After
 After 20 years of rule, the Chinese Communists
 have never been further from the realization of
 their basic foreign goals-supremacy in Asia and
 leadership of the world revolution. Many factors
 contribute to this clear-cut failure of Peking's
 foreign policy. The Chinese Communists were
 hampered from the beginning by a basic lack of
 experience in foreign affairs coupled with a world
 view badly distorted by both Maoist ideological
 dogma and traditional Chinese ethnocentrism.
 The willingness of the Maoists to eschew prag-
 matic solutions and short-term diplomatic inter-
 ests in the name of "revolutionary principle" was
 increasingly coming to be the hallmark of Chinese
 foreign policy even before the Cultural Revolu-
 tion. Perhaps more importantly, however, China
 has lacked requisite economic and military power
 to fulfill its ambitious foreign objectives. This
 situation was readily apparent when Peking came
 squarely into conflict with the vital interests of
 both superpowers-a dual collision that has effec-
 tively blocked Chinese policy, reinforced Peking's
 siege mentality, and further distorted its world
 outlook.
 Nationalistic and ideological differences have
 combined to produce a growing enmity between
 Peking and Moscow, an enmity that has led to the
 present dangerous situation along the Sino-Soviet
 frontier. Peking's obsession with its dispute with
 Moscow has increasingly come to determine Chi-
 nese foreign tactics. Its attacks on Moscow and, in
 particular, its disparagement of Soviet aid to
 North Vietnam have resulted in the defection of
 two principal Communist allies-North Korea and
 the Japan Communist Party. At the same time,
 China's indiscriminate commitment to Commu-
 nist-led armed struggle and revolution in the
 underdeveloped world produced a deep and
 abiding suspicion of Peking's sincerity and inten-
 tions, especially among the new and often "bour-
 geois" states of Africa. Moreover, Afro-Asian
 leaders are anxious to maintain a position of

 nonalignment and have become increasingly alien-
 ated by Chinese insistence that they adopt nar-
 row, anti-Soviet and anti-US positions. Peking's
 heavy-handed attempt in 1965 to stage-manage
 the abortive Algiers Afro-Asian conference was a
 classic example of China's penchant for arousing
 resentment in Afro-Asian circles.
 Aside from such tactical inflexibility, Chi-
 na's foreign effort has been crippled by factors
 over which it has no control. For the most part,
 Peking can offer only the thoughts of Mao rather
 than the military hardware and developmental
 capital that third-world nations are interested in
 obtaining. In the Middle East, for instance, stead-
 ily increasing Arab dependence on Moscow's mili-
 tary and diplomatic support eventually trans-
 formed the Chinese effort there into a defensive
 holding action. Moreover, the overthrow of pro-
 Chinese governments in a number of Afro-Asian
 states painfully brought home to Peking the risks
 involved in seeking influence in such politically
 unstable areas. The sudden change of political
 climate in Indonesia in 1965, when a Communist
 coup attempt was thwarted, was particularly
 damaging because the alliance with Sukarno and
 the Indonesian Communists had been the founda-
 tion of China's efforts to mobilize and lead a
 "third-world bloc." The advent of the Cultural
 Revolution merely accelerated the uncompro-
 mising and isolationist course on which China was
 firmly embarked. Xenophobic withdrawal and
 chauvinistic excess in effect put Chinese foreign
 policy in deep freeze; rote Maoist ideology has
 been substituted for any serious thinking on for-
 eign affairs, and Chinese behavior at home and
 abroad has alienated almost every nation main-
 taining diplomatic ties with Peking.
 Peking is now embarking on a program to
 repair the damage done to its international image
 by "Red Guard diplomacy" and the Cultural
 Revolution. The return of ambassadors to their
 stations, the resumption of more conventional
 diplomatic behavior in Peking, and the reversion
 to a somewhat less chauvinistic propaganda line
 all underscore Peking's gradual return to a more
 normal foreign posture. This largely cosmetic
 process has not been accompanied by new and
 more imaginative strategy, however. Lin Piao, in
 his address to the ninth party congress last April,
 made clear Peking's present unwillingness to seek
 new avenues in foreign policy by strongly reiter-
 ating China's support for "revolutionary struggle"
 in "all countries" and its firm commitment to
 simultaneous confrontation of the US and USSR.
 Indeed Peking has flamboyantly persisted in the
 uncompromising revolutionary path responsible
 for its present isolation. In Asia, for example,
 China is maintaining its opposition to a nego-
 tiated settlement of the Vietnam war, continues
 all-out political warfare against the Japanese Gov-
 ernment, and still calls for armed insurrection
 against most other non-Communist Asian govern-
 ments. As long as the trend toward conventional
 diplomacy remains within such harsh confines,
 any significant improvement in China's present
 international position is unlikely.
 China's current problems are immense, and
 as time passes without a final resolution, they
 grow more intractable. The country faces an enor-
 mous task of reconstruction, and Peking, as yet,
 has failed to formulate viable political solutions
 that might speed up the recovery. Part of the
 problem is that-as the violent convulsions of the
 past three years have shown-events themselves,
 often surprising and unforeseen, have frequently
 been the controlling factor, and no one has full
 control of them. Moreover, Peking's difficulties
 will be compounded until some institutional
 framework is fabricated to replace the one that
 was destroyed by the Cultural Revolution. The
 formation of a new politburo and central

 committee at the ninth congress represents only
 the first step in reconstituting the party and state
 apparatus that had guaranteed the effectiveness of
 national authority prior to the Cultural Revolu-

 difficult because today's power center is not the

 decisive, but he probably does not intervene per-
 sonally except on issues of major importance.
 At present, there is little good information
 on how decisions are being reached in Peking.
 Some kind of consensus politics, however, seems
 to be at work. Unlike the situation before the
 Cultural Revolution, when a very few top leaders
 took quick decisions and issued orders by fiat,
 most important decisions now seem to be the
 result of wider discussion, political and personal
 infighting, and frequent compromise. The dif-
 ferentiated treatment in both national and pro-
 vincial propaganda of thorny problems such as
 party rebuilding, military-civilian relationships,
 and economic decentralization suggests that sharp
 debates persist behind an ever-present facade of
 unity. Conservative-oriented military leaders in
 the new politburo probably will tend toward
 moderate policies, but their voices will be bal-
 anced by those of Mao's lieutenants who favored
 more extreme, radical measures over the past
 three years. Moreover, the use of sharply deline-
 ating terms such as "moderate," "radical," or
 "military" to describe these groupings distorts
 their nature, since, in fact, we are probably deal-
 ing with unfocused tendencies, rather than tightly
 knit units with a carefully formulated political
 program. Thus, advocates of the policies sug-
 gested by these various tendencies probably vary
 from time to time as individuals differently per-
 ceive their own self-interest.

 and reversals, however, he has not abandoned his
 romantic vision of a communized, equalitarian
 China nor his sense that the Chinese revolution is
 his own creation.
 Mao may now be content to settle for some
 of the victories he has achieved over his oppo-
 nents; his future course of action is still difficult
 to predict. He probably believes that his optimum
 goals were not achieved, and the events of the
 past year may prompt him to worry that the main
 thrust of the Cultural Revolution is in danger. For
 Mao to retreat any further in the direction of
 moderation would mean closing off a whole line
 of "revolutionary options." In Mao's terms, this
 would mean at least a partial surrender to the
 very forces he has been trying to extirpate since
 the mid-1960s, and this may be impossible for
 him to accept.
 Mao's departure from the scene would not
 be likely to result in any short-term easing of the
 nation's problems. Although formally designated
 heir to Mao, the 61-year-old Lin Piao-whose
 health is also poor-does not possess the charisma
 or political acumen of his mentor, and it is highly
 likely that some of his powerful colleagues in the
 upper echelon believe Lin has serious short-
 comings as a leader. Some probably believe that
 Lin owes his position more to his sycophancy of
 Mao than to any real leadership capacity. More-
 over, that Mao felt it necessary to name Lin
 formally his successor speaks more loudly of his
 weakness than it does of his strength.

 Lin Piao: "As Chairman Mao has said..."
 Regardless of the composition of a successor
 regime, it will probably lack the unity and strong
 central authority that characterized the Mao
 leadership until the advent of the Cultural Revo-
 lution. Considerable power will have to be shared
 with important military leaders in China's regions,
 and a new form of regional-central balance may
 prevail, with a configuration tending to conform
 to the jurisdictions of China's 13 military region
 commands. This does not mean that China after
 Mao will necessarily become a military dictator-
 ship. The military certainly do not run China on
 their own terms now, and it is not likely that they
 will do so in the future. At present, however, the
 thorny problem of the relation of the military to
 a redeveloped Chinese Communist Party remains
 to be solved.
 As in domestic affairs, Chinese foreign pol-
 icy bears the personal imprint of Mao Tse-tung
 and his revolutionary principles; as long as Mao
 rules, there is little reason to believe that Peking's
 foreign approach will be significantly altered. His
 departure from the scene would no doubt open
 the door to some degree of change and innova-
 tion, and allow Peking some additional room for
 maneuver in a search for ways to regain diploma-
 tic leverage.
 Despite concern in both Moscow and Peking
 that Sino-Soviet border clashes may get out of
 hand, a permanent diminution of hostility toward
 the USSR seems unlikely. The fact that Peking
 now probably considers Moscow the greatest
 threat to China might, indeed, prompt some
 limited counterbalancing in the direction of Wash-
 ington. Peking could conceivably see some merit
 in a reduction of tension with the US if only to
 complicate Soviet-US relations by playing on
 Moscow's chronic fear of a Sino-US rapproche-
 ment. The central issue of Taiwan, however, and a
 continuing US military presence in Asia, will al-
 most certainly prevent any major movement
 toward a normalization of relations with the US.
 The greatest promise for diplomatic gain lies
 in what Peking terms the "intermediate zone"-a
 group of Western capitalist states that the Chinese
 have to date shown little interest in cultivating.
 Peking is presently entertaining bids by Canada
 and Italy to establish relations-a development
 that has generated interest in several other West
 European states. If the Chinese maintain their
 stiff asking price for recognition, however-the
 severance of all ties with Taiwan-a general move-
 ment in this direction is not likely. Likewise, a
 serious Chinese effort to improve political and
 economic ties with Japan may be inhibited by
 Tokyo's reluctance to diminish its ties with
 Taiwan and the US. Turning to the third major
 area of Chinese diplomacy, there appears to be
 little opportunity for Peking immediately to im-
 prove its position within the Afro-Asian world.
 Chinese gains in this area will require the develop-
 ment of a more orderly domestic image, reversion

 to the "peaceful coexistence" approach followed
 during the mid-1950s and, above all, the passage
 of time.
 Perhaps the greatest obstacle to the emer-
 gence of a new imaginative foreign effort is Chi-
 na's domestic turmoil. The Cultural Revolution,
 in effect, removed China from the international
 arena. Peking may be content to continue this
 isolationist policy while coping with its staggering
 internal problems. At any rate, the certain con-
 tinuation of intense preoccupation with domestic
 problems suggests that Peking will continue to
 play a passive international role, reacting to
 events rather than shaping them.

 long view indeed.
 As long as Mao Tse-tung remains at the
 helm, China's leaders are unlikely to initiate many
 positive programs of development. As a result,
 any successor regime will have to cope with enor-
 mous problems of reconstruction while attempt-
 ing to rule a demoralized and possibly fractious
 nation. The prospects for a new regime's success
 will probably be in direct proportion to its ability
 to abandon Mao's revolutionary dogma in prac-
 tice and to recognize that the content of his latest
 programs have proved irrelevant to China's prob-
 lems. Taking the longest view, pragmatic and na-
 tionalist considerations involving questions of
 economic growth, the prestige of the state, and
 the need for more centralized political order seem
 bound to prevail. But in this 20th anniversary
 year of Chinese Communist rule, this is  very
