FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
PORTUGAL 
Speeches yesterday by newly installed 
Portuguese President Costa Gomes and former 
president Spinola contrasted sharply. 
In his resignation speech, Spinola bitterly 
denounced the emergence of a generalized climate of 
anarchy. He warned the Portuguese people that they 
were threatened with a "new form of servitude under 
the banner of false liberty." He declared that he 
was unable to carry out the program of the Armed 
Forces Movement because its ideals had been set 
aside. 
Costa Gomes stressed the achievements that have 
been made since the April coup and appealed for 
unity. The new President reaffirmed his support 
for the Armed Forces Movement and seemed to be sig-
naling that he will be more flexible than his pred-
ecessor. He reminded his listeners that in politics 
"one must not be tied to rigid and preconceived 
schemes." 
Costa Gomes has long acted as a mediator be-
tween the unyielding Spinola and the leftists in the 
Armed Forces Movement. Perhaps to calm supporters 
of the popular ex-president, Costa Gomes lavishly 
praised Spinola's dedication to the movement's 
ideals and noted his own efforts to prevent the 
resignation. 
Earlier in the afternoon, Costa Gomes visited 
a commando unit outside Lisbon, which professed 
loyalty to Spinola, presumably to quell possible 
unrest. 
Costa Gomes promised that Portugal would honor 
all of its international obligations including its 
association with NATO. Foreign Minister Soares had 
earlier informed the embassy that Lisbon will remain 
in NATO. 
The size of the military junta has been re-
duced by the forced resignation of three Spinola 
loyalists. With Spinola's resignation, only three 
officers remain: Costa Gomes himself and two de-
cidedly leftist admirals. Cabinet changes are ex-
pected; Spinola supporters in the ministries of de-
fense and social communications are likely to be 
replaced.

CYPRUS 
Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis yes-
terday urged Greek Cypriots to support 
acting President Clerides. KaramanZis 
qualified his backing somewhat by saying 
support for Clerides should be extended 
so long as the continuing crisis pre-
cludes the return to Cyprus of the 
"elected president, Archbishop Makarios." 
The Prime Minister's announcement followed a 
meeting with a member of the Cypriot parliament who 
briefed Karamanlis about the growing disunity in the 
Greek Cypriot community. The parliament member may 
also have delivered a threat from Clerides to resign 
if Athens did not give him stronger public support. 
25X1 
The machinations of Archbishop Makarios, who 
has announced his intention to go back to the is-
land, have also become a growing worry for Clerides. 
The campaign among Makariosrsupporters for the Arch-
bishop's early return has gained strength; Makarios' 
supporters held a mass rally in Limassol on Sunday. 
Clerides, meanwhile, continued his discussions 
of humanitarian issues with Denktash yesterday. 
The two agreed to resume the exchange of prisoners, 
who will be released where they wish, regardless of 
the location of their homes.

SYRIA 
Syrian pilots have begun training 
for ground-attack missions with the 
MIG-23. Training of this kind suggests 
that the Syrians are well advanced in 
their ability to handle this aircraft, 
which is the most sophisticated in any 
Arab inventory. Iraq is the only other 
country to have received this aircraft. 
Syria's first MIG-23s arrived in June; it now 
has at least 45, including both the ground-attack  
and interceptor versions.  
25X1 
The Syrians flew only a few ground-attack mis-
sions during the war last October; they used obso-
lescent MIG-17 and SU-7 aircraft in this role. 
The MIG-23 will give Syria a better capability 
for ground attack. The interceptor version of this 
aircraft should also enable the Syrian air force to 
engage Israeli F-4 Phantoms more effectively in 
aerial combat.

USSR ? INDIAN OCEAN AREA 
The Soviet helicopter ship Leningrad 
and its escorting destroyer were sighted 
15 to 20 miles off Berbera, Somalia on 
Friday and Saturday. Helicopters from 
the ship appeared to be flying to Berbera 
port, which is just within sight of the 
anchored ships. The two ships may spend 
as much as a week in the Gulf of Aden be-
fore they rendezvous with a supply ship 
off the east coast of Somalia. 
On Wednesday and Thursday, the Leningrad and its 
escort took on food and fuel from an auxiliary ship  
at the Soviet anchorage 20 miles off Aden.  
  The Leningrad 
has not entered the territorial waters of either 
Somalia or South Yemen. 
Soviet helicopter ships, the Leningrad and the 
Moskva, have made only five calls at foreign ports--
four to Egypt and one to Yugoslavia. 
Soviet Naval Su. .ort in the Indian Ocean Area 
As Moscow has extended its routine naval opera-
tions into distant areas such as the Indian Ocean, 
the Soviet navy has sought to supplement auxiliary 
ship groupings--"floating bases"--with foreign shore 
support facilities. Traditionally, the Soviet navy 
has avoided dependence on foreign sources and means. 
At present, Soviet ships in the Indian Ocean receive 
substantial support at several ports, although none 
were set up as US-style "homeports." At Berbera in 
Somalia, Soviet personnel even have direct control 
over some facilities. 
Most Soviet warships operating in the Indian 
Ocean routinely put in to Berbera for resupply, 
minor repairs, and short-term crew rest. Repairs 
are performed alongside a Soviet barge that has been 
docked there since October 1972, The Soviets control

The Soviets have reportedly agreed to assist in 
constructing an airfield near Berbera, but work on 
an airstrip has not begun. They are, however, assist-
ing in the development of Berbera's commercial port 
facilities, including a major expansion of petroleum 
storage capacity. 
Access to Berbera has enabled the Soviets to 
double the time on station of their basic Indian 
Ocean contingent, which includes one destroyer, two 
destroyer escorts, two fleet minesweepers, one land-
ing ship, and an F-class diesel submarine. 
Facilities. in Iraq  
Soviet naval ships receive some servicing at 
the main Iraqi port of Al Basra. Support there ap-
parently is limited to minor maintenance for smaller 
ships on an intermittent basis. A Soviet repair 
.ship has been observed at the Al Basra naval base, 
where it has remained for as long as six months at 
a time. Soviet naval ships, including at least one 
of the two fleet minesweepers that participated in 
a Persian Gulf patrol last summer, occasionally visit 
Al Basra while the repair ship is in port. 
Soviet warships call at Umm Qasr in Iraq even 
more frequently than at Al Basra. Visits are limited 
to resupply activity, however. There are no main-
tenance or repair facilities at Umm Qasr, 
Aden Port (South Yemen)  
Despite the Leningrad's experience, other Soviet 
naval ships frequently visit Aden. This port, some 
150 nautical miles across the Gulf of Aden from 
Berbera, has extensive commercial repair facilities 
remaining from the days when Aden was a British 
colony. The Soviet navy has not used these repair 
facilities, but their auxiliary ships make regular 
stops in Aden to take on water, fuel, and other pro-
visions. They may also pick up supplies arriving 
in Aden via air transport from the USSR. The Soviets 
have routinely used Aden's international airport--
located only five miles from the port--for military 
transport flights. In recent months, Soviet warships 
frequently have been observed at anchorage near the 
port.

TURKEY 
Suleyman Demirel, leader of the 
Justice Party, will try to form a right-
of-center coalition following Prime Min-
ister Ecevit's second failure to organize 
a new government. 
If Demirel can get the Democrats and the ultra-
conservative Salvationists to join him, the three-
party coalition would have a. majority of approxi-
mately 15 in the 450-seat parliament. 
The Democratic Party, however, is largely made 
up of former Justice Party members who broke with 
Demirel in 1970, and they remain bitterly opposed 
to him. The chances of a rightist coalition coming 
to fruition would be much better if Demirel would 
step aside. 
Ecevit believes that Demirel will fail to or-
ganize a new government. Ecevit told the US em-
bassy last week that once it is demonstrated that 
a rightist coalition is not possible, his chances 
of enticing the Democratic Party into a coalition 
with his Republican People's Party will be much 
improved. 
A caretaker government led by Ecevit will 
provide continuity for Turkey's policies, but will 
be unable to take any new initiatives. Even should 
the rightist political forces put together a coa-
lition, they would be unlikely to make any radical 
departures from the policies pursued by Ecevit on 
issues such as Cyprus and relations with the US, 
including the opium question. A rightist coalition 
might find it even more difficult to make signifi-
cant concessions to the Greeks.

IRAQ 
The anticipated renewal of the Iraqi 
offensive against Kurdish positions in 
northeastern Iraq began Friday. The of-
fensive involves a two-pronged attack, 
whose objective is to drive the Kurds 
from the heights overlooking the road 
from Rawanduz into Iran, and to cut Kurd-
ish forces from supply points along the 
Iranian border. 
the Iraqis have al-
ready suffered a costly defeat, their second in two 
weeks. Baghdad's troops, supported by aircraft and 
artillery, apparently overran some Kurdish positions 
in the early stages of the assault, but were driven 
back in fierce fighting early Saturday morning. 
The Iraqis are said to have withdrawn to Ra-
wanduz, leaving some 500 casualties and a large 
amount of military equipment on the battlefield. 
The Kurds followed the retreating Iraqis to their 
camp and shelled them with mortars. 
CP, 
Baath Party strongman Tikriti has committed his 
prestige to defeating the Kurds before winter sets 
in about six weeks from now. If the latest. drive. 
fails, opposition within the Iraqi military to the 
Kurdish war will certainly intensify. This could 
produce an open power struggle between Tikriti and 
opponents within the government and the military.

CHINA-PHILIPPINES 
Mutual interest in improving relations 
was dramatized last week as the Chinese 
gave Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos 
an extraordinary reception in Peking. 
Mrs. Marcos was favored with separate meetings 
with Chairman Mao Tse-tung and with hospitalized 
Premier Chou En-lai. This was Chou's ?first such 
appearance in more than six weeks. Excluding ear-
lier meetings with US officials, Mrs. Marcos' audi-
ence with Mao is the only time in recent years that 
he has met with an emissary of a government with 
which Peking has no official ties. 
By their warm treatment of Mrs. Marcos, the 
Chinese have shown that they will keep the pressure 
on for early diplomatic recognition. President 
Marcos may conclude that the time has come to move 
more quickly in this direction, despite the damage 
this will do to Philippine relations with Taiwan. 
?Even before Mrs. Marcos' visit, there were 
signs that Manila had begun exploring some of the 
issues that could come up during negotiations on 
diplomatic relations. The Philippines sent a 
representative to Taipei earlier this year to ad-
vise the Nationalists that Manila was considering 
improving its ties with Peking. 
A trade agreement was announced during Mrs. 
Marcos' visit. The agreement reportedly provides 
for the sale of Chinese petroleum. The Philippines 
agreed to sell sugar, wood products and other items 
in return. Details of the pact are to be worked 
out when a Philippine trade delegation visits China 
later in the year.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
MUJIBUR RAHMAN 
As Bangladesh Prime 
Minister Mujibur Rahman ar-
rives in Washington, his 
country is undergoing severe 
internal stress. When Mujib 
took over early in 1972, the 
new nation of more than 75 
million people faced a quan-
tity of postwar problems. 
Nearly three years later the 
economic situation has not 
improved, and political and 
social problems have reached 
a point where they pose a 
serious threat to his regime. 
Domestic Problems  
The economy of Bangladesh, already strained by 
an annual population growth rate of over 3 percent, 
has been hurt badly over the past year by widespread 
shortages--particularly of food and imported goods. 
To complicate matters this fall, Bangladesh has been 
feeling the effects--which Mujib considers very se-
rious--of recent flooding. Indeed, the Prime Minis-
ter fears unrest, particularly in urban areas, and 
reportedly views the situation as the worst his re-
gime has yet faced. 
Mujib has recently come under public attack 
for his inability to check general lawlessness, in-
cluding political violence, and for the inefficiency 
and corruption of his regime. Disillusionment and 
discontent have apparently spread to all levels of 
the military and to moderate leaders within Mujib's 
own party, the Awami League. With the political 
opposition badly fragmented, the most credible 
threat to Mujib would appear to come from dissi-
dents in the Awami League or from the armed forces. 
The risk of an eventual military move against 
Mujib is increasing as he drifts toward greater 
authoritarianism in the face of growing problems. 
Should Mujib act to increase his powers sharply, 
military support would be crucial; whether the mil-
itary would go along with Mujib or seek to unseat 
him would depend in part on whether he could assure 
the armed forces an enhanced role in a subsequent 
regime.

? 
Relations with the: United' 
States 
Although Mujib and many Bengalee officials 
have a lingering resentment toward the US for its 
policy during the independence struggle in 1971, 
Mujib has shown a genuine fondness for Americans 
over the years. 
Indeed, the Prime Minister himself started the 
movement toward more normal relations with Washing-
ton He sees bet-
ter relations with the US as ?resulting in more aid,  
which in turn will help him stay in power.r.  
 /Mujib 
probably also hopes that the meeting will enhance 
his standing as international statesman and divert 
attention from domestic problems. 
The move toward Washington has been prompted 
also by the changing status of Mujib's relations 
with the Soviet Union and India. His feelings to-
ward the Soviet Unionhave cooled recently, in 
part because of Moscow's failure. to respond more ? 
quickly and generously to requests for flood relief 
and because of its meager contribution to develop-
ment aid. 
The relationship with India also affects his 
attitude toward .the US. Anti-Indian feeling is 
growing in Bangladesh, stemming from popular fears 
of economic .exploitation and political domination 
by New Delhi. Improved relations with Washington 
give Mujib!s. government more flexibility in deal-
ing with India, .upon which he has previously been 
heavily dependent for political and economic as-
sistance.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
The Prime Minister probably believes the US 
has more interest in and influence over events in 
Bangladesh, and South Asia in general, than is ac-
tually the case. Thus he probably has unrealistic 
expectations of what the US can do for him eco-
nomically and politically.

He was treated in Moscow for an illness last 
spring. This was publicly announced as acute bron-
chitis 
he 
returned from Moscow apparently fully recovered. 
Mujib remains a folk 
hero and is still respect-
fully referred to in Bang-
ladesh as Bangobandhu--an 
honorific translated 
roughly as "father of Ben-
gal." He takes this status 
quite seriously and refers 
to the people and country--
indeed almost everything 
about Bangladesh--in pater-
nalistic terms. 2
