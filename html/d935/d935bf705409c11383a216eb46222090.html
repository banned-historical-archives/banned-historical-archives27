 Four years ago the youth of Communist China were caught up in a maelstrom of rebellion aimed
 at turning an entrenched governing bureaucracy on its head and remolding the nation's society and
 people. Under the banner of the Red Guard movement, youthful activists emerged as the spearhead of
 Mao Tse-tung's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and made a frontal attack on the educational
 system, harried muO of the highest leadership, and spread political chaos throughout the land. Their
 activities captured the imagination of the Western press and of many "new left" student leaders outside
 China, who saw similarities between their movements and that of China's young militants.
 The Red Guard movement, however, was only superficially a spontaneous outpouring of youthful
 discontent and unrest against the "establishment." In actual fact, the Red Guards were largely pawns in
 a great domestic political struggle over
 power and policy that was initiated not byj      /~i-o':
 the students but by the regime. The artifi-
 cial and carefully structured growth of the                   -;-

 The end of the usefulness of student acti-
 vists as political instruments having been
 unmistakably demonstrated to the regime,
 it eventually rusticated hundreds of thou-
 sands of them for political "re-education"
 and reform through labor.
 Because of the harsh repression they
 have suffered since 1968, China's students
 today are probably more cynical, apathetic,
 and disheartened than at any time since the
 Communists took power in 1949. Even though they did not rebel agai'ist the system entirely on their
 own initiative, China's students did have outstanding grievances and many of them willingly lent
 themselves to the Red Guard movement in the belief that it would rectify such ills as an inadequate
 educational system, shortage of job opportunities, and limited career mobility. All of these grievances
 are currently being dealt with by the regime but ., accordance with the conflicting imperatives of
 Maoist ideology and current political realities rather than in response to specific student demands. Thus,
 despite the fact that the regime continues to pay lip service to China's youth as Mao Tse-tung's
 "revolutionary successors," their influence on policy is nil and their succession is a long way off. In the
 meantime, barring another revolution from above, China's youth are likely to continue to express their
 discontent and dissatisfaction through the time-honored practice of passive resistance and foot-dragging
 rather than through direct assault on the establishment itself.

 evils of hypocrisy and inertia. Above all, the Red
 Guards believed that they were about to inherit
 the earth. And initially many militant Red Guard
 groups directed their ire specifically at the admin-
 istrative apparatus of an educational system that
 did not seem capable of preparing them for the
 future that propaganda had assured them was to
 be theirs.
 The Red Guard phenomenon, however, did
 not arise out of unfulfilled youthful expectations
 but out of internecine quarreling within the hier-
 archy. It was brought into existence and pro-
 tected by the highest levels of a Chinese regime
 that had closed schools in the summer of 1966
 precisely so that the students could "make revolu-
 tion." The major targets of Red Guard attacks-
 entrenched party, government, and academic of-
 ficials who were charged with resisting Mao's lead-
 ership-were chosen by the regime. The radical
 Red Guard leaders were in close communication
 with extremist colleagues of Mao in Peking and
 took their orders directly from them. In addition,
 as the Red Guard movement spread throughout
 China it was backed up by an elaborate logistics
 network supported by the state. The more im-
 portant radical Red Guard groups also communi-
 cated with one another and with Peking over the
 state-run telegraph net. These activities could not
 have occurred without backing from the central
 authorities, z.nd in this sense the Red Guard
 movement was an artificial-and in many ways
 highly structured-movement quite different from
 the student protests in the West and in some
 other Asian states.
 The Revoiutionarv Tradition
 To say that the Red Guard movement was
 wholly inspired and manipulated by the regime is
 not to deny Mao's genuine concern with culti-
 vating "revolutionary successors" or to imply that
 political activism is alien to China's youth. In-
 deed,  the  modern  Chinese revolution  largely
 began with the famous student-inspired "May
 4th" movement of 1919 that followed the over-
 throw of the Manchu dynasty.  "May 4th"

 Red Guard Poster, 24 June 1966
 Many "new left" student leaders in the West
 have noted similarities between their "move-
 ments" and those of the Red Guards who were
 the spearhead of China's Great Proletarian Cul-
 tural                 Revolution in  1966-68. Some parallels
 superficially are quite striking. The Red Guards
 appeared to be attacking the increa:;ingly irrele-
 vant and worn-out remnants of a used-up cultural
 tradition. They were fanatic and not open to
 appeals for compromise and reasoned adjustment.
 Their attack on the self-satisfied Communist
 bureaucracy that had grown up since 1949 ap-
 peared to reflect a deep-seated hatred of the twin

 represented the reaction of Chinese youth against
 traditional cultu. , and custom that had failed to
 adapt China to the modern world as symbolized,
 at that time, by the shabby treatment China re-
 ceived at the peace conference in Paris. It was no
 accident that the most influential journal of that
 period was called New Youth or that its editor,
 Ch'en Tu-hsiu, was one of the co-founders of the
 Chinese Communist Party.
 The cultural system that came under attack
 in 1919 had always accorded a special place to
 the scholar. The imperial mandarinate was an
 administrative system peopled by a scholar-elite.
 The way to advancement was through study and
 examination, and the rewards frequently were
 great. Beyond material advantage, the educated
 man traditionally was accorded a position of
 honor in society. The pace of success, however,
 was very slow. Rewards and honor went to the
 old and aging while the young remained sub-
 ordinate. Scholarship was devoted to quasi-
 Confucian ends bearing little relationship to the
 needs of the modern world.
 The "May 4th" movement turned all this
 upside down: the youthful students who were the
 spearhead of the movement were exalted over
 their hidebound and repressive elders, and tradi-
 tional concerns and attitudes were denounced in
 favor of the liberating influence of modern tech-
 niques and Western intellectual currents. "May
 4th" was the fountainhead of both the Commu-
 nist movement and the Chinese nationalist move-
 ment in its modern form, as well as the source
 point for most Chinese intellectual trends of this
 century.
 The implications of this movement, how-
 ever, really were not clear-cut, as they once
 seemed. Elderly scholars were denounced and
 derided-but by younger scholars. Modern West-
 ern                 intellectual fashions, including Marxism,
 flowed into China-but the Maoist version of
 Marxism, which in time became the new ortho-
 doxy, contained a heavy infusion of noticns de-
 rived from a romantic view of the traditional,
 Special Report
 peasant-based uprisings that had punctuated Chi-
 nese history. Above all, although Confucianism as
 an administrative and philosophic system was dis-
 carded, the ethical and cultural assumptions on
 which it rested in large degree survived. The spe-
 cific gravity of a culture that had remained vir-
 tually intact for some three thousand years
 proved very high, and the consequences of this
 fact still are working themselves out.
 One immediate result of the "May 4th"
 movement was to fuse the connection between
 students and politics. Youthful activists not only
 played a major part in mobilizing public opinion
 against "imperialism" in the early 1920s but were
 also prominent in the growth of the nationalist
 movement later in the decade. Student disen-
 chantment with Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang
 was an important factor in the long duel between
 the Communists and the Chinese Nationalists.
 The idealistic fervor of these children's crusades
 continued to be important in the fluid politics of
 the 1920s, 30s, and 40s. It was much less so,
 however, after the Communist take-over in 1949.
 In its initial years, the stock of the new
 order among most of the politically conscious
 young people was extremely high. The achieve-
 ments of Mao Tse-tung and his colleagues since
 the mid-1930s had indeed been remarkable. They
 had gone from one victory to another-they had
 unified China, fought the US to a draw in Korea,
 halted a runaway inflation, and put China on the
 road to economic development and moderniza-
 ton. These accomplishments gave the regirne a
 mantle of invincibility, and young people were
 willing to accept its dictates at face value. Their
 optimism was also buoyed by the romantic incen-
 tive of serving social and political idealism that
 promised them participation in political action
 aimed at overcoming past weaknesses, such as an
 oppressive traditional social order, a fragmented
 political system, and an inetlective government.

 As the years wore on, Chinese youth were
 presented with a series of disillusioning facts and
 unpalatable choices, and many lost their revolu-
 tionary elan. The students diminished as a politi-
 cal force and discovered that the Communists
 were as unsatisfactory from an idealistic point of
 view as the nationalists had been. By the eve of
 the Cultural Revolution, student discontent had
 built up to the point where many were eager to
 respond to the Maoists' cry that "there can be no
 construction without prior destruction."
 China's educational facilities, for example,
 had expanded greatly since the Communist take-
 over in 1949, but they had not kept pace with a
 burgeoning population approaching over 800 mil-
 lion people-almost half of them under twenty-
 one. Competition for places in universities and
 colleges was keen, and even those who did man-
 age to acquire education frequently found that
 they were still stymied. Meaningful jobs commen-
 surate with educational level and skills were often
 not available, and any openings frequently in-
 volved transfer from the comparative comfort of
 the great cities of east and central China to re-
 mote and backward outposts. Moreover, the lead-
 ership that had taken power at the end of the civil
 war had not relinquished its stranglehold on mid-
 dle and upper echelon jobs. As the queue for
 these grew longer, the waiting period grew more
 frustrating.
 The problem of limited career mobility was
 made all the more acute because the regime very
 early on had deliberately fostered rising expecta-
 tions by painting a glowing picture of a modern
 and powerful China to be built by the younger
 generation. University students naturally assumed
 that they were going to take their places as lead-
 ers and builders of the new society. Because the
 professional and technical specialists needed for
 modernization were in short supply, not all stu-
 dents found their hopes dashed. But the absurdi-
 ties of Mao's Great Leap Forward in 1958-1959
 and the consequent social and economic retrench-
 ment in the early 1960s led to a decline in educa-
 tional opportunities across the board; as a result,
 Special Report
 job opportunities were even further curtailed. The
 collapse of the leap forward forced the regime to
 renege on many of its golden promises and in-
 stead, to offer to much of the youth only long
 years of dour and unrewarding struggle. For many
 urban students, this meant banishment to the
 villages to provide mere manual labor in support
 of the post-leap efforts to step up agricultural
 development. To steel themselves for further sac-
 rifices, the youth were told to emulate the very
 ordinary achievements of a model army hero, Lei
 Feng, who wrote:
 "Some people call me an idiot. I want to
 do good deeds for the state and people. If
 they, say I am an idiot, then I apt willing
 to be one. The revolution needs voluntary
 idiots like me. "
 Meanwhile, for those who remained  in
 school, tensions also were high. This was partially
 a direct result of regime goals that in practice
 conflicted rather than complemented an attempt
 to modernize the country on the one hand and an
 attempt ideologically to remold Chinese society
 on the other. Mao had shown an awareness of
 these tensions, but his attempts to solve the prob-
 lem before the Cultural Revolution exacerbated
 rather than relieved the situation.
 In China, as e!sewhere, education is the key
 to advancement-however long deferred. Many of
 those who were best qualified intellectually for
 higher education were interested merely in mate-
 rial rewards and perquisites that a modernizing
 society must pay to the relatively small group
 that has attained technical proficiency. "Career-
 ism," cynical or otherwise, became increasingly
 prevalent as the first flush of revolutionary enthu-
 siasm wore off. At the same time, however, the
 regime was strongly emphasizing that China's
 youth would soon inherit both the country and
 the Chinese Communist revolutionary tradition.
 Mao in particular was concerned lest tradition be
 diluted by an indifferent youth bent on pursuit of
 their careers.. He insisted that peasant and work-
 ing-class background be the prime consideration

 in awarding places at institutions of higher learn-

 Red Guard diatribes, even when discounted
 for polemical exaggeration, make it clear, how-
 ever, that purely academic qualifications con-
 tinued to play a part in the selection process after
 Mao's abortive attempt to lower educational
 standards during the Great Leap period. Stiff en-
 trance requirements and difficult exams were re-
 instituted, allegedly against Mao's will, in an ef-
 fort to raise the caliber of the students who were
 to become the technicaliy qualified elite of the
 future. Thus, peasant and poor worker youths,
 told that they were China's "revolutionary succes-
 sors" and uniquely fitted for this role by virtue of
 their backgrounds, found that the "class enemy"
 still was accorded preferment in the educational
 system. The hatred thus engendered boiled over
 in the early phases of the Cultural Revolution,
 when opposing student Red Guard groups broke
 down along class lines-particularly at the more
 prestigious universities where bourgeois students
 were numerous.
 The various frustrations, currents, and coun-
 tercurrents faced by the youth before the Cul-
 tural Revolution were an explosive mixture, but it
 took a deliberate act on the part of the regime to
 ignite the fuse. Moreover, the Red Guard move-
 ment was never a unitary whole, and as the re-
 gime's revolution against itself ebbed and flowed,
 various Red Guard groups were employed as op-
 posing, political instruments both by the Maoists
 in Peking and by the civilian and army officidls
 who were under attack. Insofar as Red groups of
 any persuasir ' '-t uld be said to have had a posi-
 tive program, it was to acquire power by replacing
 disgraced former officials who had come to be
 regarded as symbols of the frustrating status quo.
 This ambition probably was confined to the lead-
 ers of the various Red Guard groups, but at all
 levels there was the hope that the log jam block-
 ing the way to relatively rapid advancement could
 be broken. In retrospect, however, there was
 Special Report
 never much likelihood that Red Guards would
 secure an appreciable number of important posi-
 tions.
 Implicit in Red Guard attack: on "power
 holders" was the larger, less well-defined aim of
 purifying the system. Starting from the Maoist
 premise of the corrupting influence of "revision-
 ism," the Red Guards tended to attribute their
 frustrations to the ideological mistakes of the
 "power holders." Nevertheless, the evils that they
 attacked-bureaucracy, routinization, specializa-
 tion, and pragmatic devotion to efficiency at the
 expense of ideology-were all inevitable manifes-
 tations of the modernization process. The Red
 Guards' demand for purity was thus in effect a
 call for a primitive, utopian Communism-a call
 that echoed Mao Tse-tung's demand for a new
 generation of true believers who would dedicate
 themselves even more fervently to the Chinese
 Communist revolutionary tradition.
 Because these romantic and idealistic strands
 in the Red Guard program were unrealizable,
 cynicism and "careerism," those objects of Red
 Guard scorn, tended to grow rather than diminish
 among the students. In many instances, the stu-
 dents' general hope for advancement degenerated
 into a cynical "what's-in-it-for-me" attitude. As
 inconclusive battles for power between  Red
 Guard factions dragged on, more and more indi-
 viduals opted out of the struggle entirely and
 refused to become committed to any side. Many
 became drifters living from hand to mouth, while
 others gravitated toward criminal activities.
 The success of the Red Guards-and their
 mentors in Peking-in destroying the party appa-
 ratus during the Cultural Revolution meant that a
 power vacuum had to be filled to get the country
 running again. By 1968 it was clear that the
 vacuum would be filled by the army and that the
 fate of the Red Guard movement was sealed. The
 Red Guards themselves were incapable of sup-
 planting the apparatus they had helped to

 destroy, and it seems highly likely that Mao never
 intended them to play a major role in adminis-
 tering the country. He may well have regretted
 having to alienate the Red Guards whom he had
 hailed as "revol'_ Jonary successors," but once the
 regime finally decided that their usefulness as
 political instruments was over, it moved swiftly
 and cynically to repress them. Without so much
 as missing a turn, the enormous propaganda ma-
 chinery put the riation on notice in August 1968
 that the vanguard of the revolution was no longer
 the Red Guards but the more orthodox "worker/
 peasant proletariat."
 Beginning in the late summer and fall of
 1968, most armed Red Guard factions were
 broken up and their adherents brutclly suppressed
 by the ai my, and the movement itself ceased to
 count politically. Although so-called "congresses"
 of Red Guards were subsequently established in
 major urban centers theoretically to provide
 youth a voice in local affairs, such organizations
 were controlled and manipulated by the authori-
 ties. Moreover, the membership of the congresses
 apparently consisted largely of those factionalists
 supporting the civil and military leaders who
 eventually emerged triumphant in the Cultural
 Revolution; for those Red Guards who backed
 their opponents a worse fate was in store.
