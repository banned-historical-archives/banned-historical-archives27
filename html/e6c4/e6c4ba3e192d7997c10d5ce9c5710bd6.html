 Thousands of anti-British Cypriots demonstrated vio-
 lently in Nicosia this morning to protest the evacuation
 of Turkish Cypriot refugees from the British base at
 Akrotiri.  About 2,000 of them broke into the British
 consulate, threw its contents into the street, and set
 the building afire.
 Demonstrators also attacked the US embassy with
 stones and later broke into the compound, setting a
 vehicle on fire.  Another mob was reported heading for the
 offices of the British Council, a semiofficial trade and
 cultural group.
 Police so far have appeared powerless to control the
 mobs and have called for help from the Cypriot National
 Guard.
 Even while demonstrators were preparing for action
 this morning, the first planeload of refugees left
 Akrotiri for Turkey.  For now, at least, the British ap-
 pear to be in control of the road from Episkopi to the
 airfield and two more trips are planned for the Turkish
 evacuation plane today.

 Peking has finally gone public on the imminent con-
 vening of a National People's Congress, the first in a
 decade.   The Chinese reported on January 17 that a plenum
 of the party Central. Committee had met from January 8 to
 10 to deal with issues connected with the congress.
 The congress may now be in session.   The delay of a
 week in reporting the plenum suggests that the announce-
 ment it had taken place coincided with the opening of the
 National People's Congress.
 meeting took place in the Great Hall of the People on the
 night of January 17.   It is not yet clear how long the
 congress will last, or whether Peking will release docu-
 ments connected with its work while the meeting is in
 session or will delay such releases until the congress
 has concluded its work.   Chinese officials have restricted
 travel to Peking, but not to other cities, until mid-
 February, which suggests that the meeting may be fairly
 lengthy.
 The communique reporting on the Central Committee
 plenum indicated that a new state constitution had been
 approved.   Controversy over this document had been a
 factor in the many postponements of the congress; pre-
 sumably these arguments,  in particular the one over
 whether or not the post of chief of state should be
 abolished, have now been resolved.   The communique also
 reported that the plenum approved a list of state council
 appointments.   Some of these appointments, especially
 those involving the military, were almost certainly also
 controversial and factors in previous postponements of
 the congress.
 Teng Hsiao-ping, a veteran civilian administrator
 who had been a major victim of the Cultural Revolution
 but had been rehabilitated in April 1,973 and named to the
 Politburo in December of that year, was further elevated
 at the plenum to the Politburo standing committee.   He

 National Intelligence Bulletin                        January 18, 1975
 was also named a vice chairman of the party.  These ap-
 pointments vault Teng over the heads of Chiang Ching and
 Yao Wen-yuan, the ranking active members of the full
 Politburo who as members of the notorious Cultural Revo-
 lution group had helped engineer Teng's purge in 1966.
 They also elevate Teng above Li Hsien-nien, with whom he
 has been sharing duties in the day-to-day running of the
 government since the illness of Premier Chou En-lai.
 Teng's new-titles-cement his position as Chou's
 de facto successor as head of government; it is possi-
 ble that the congress will further confirm this posi-
 tion by formally naming him premier.   In any event,
 Teng's advancement strongly suggests that policies
 adopted by the congress will not depart markedly from
 those of the past several years and will not be espe-
 cially "radical" in flavor.
 Mao Tse-tung remained in Changsha, in Hunan Province,
 throughout the Central Committee plenum.   He still appears
 to be in southern China, and it therefore seems likely
 that he will miss at least the opening phases of the
 congress.   Mao does not hold a government post and he is
 not obligated to attend a strictly governmental conclave
 such as a National People's Congress.  He did, however,
 attend the last congress as a delegate from Peking.  The
 Chairman has remained out of the capital since July, about
 the time that central directives first indicated'that
 active preparations for the congress were under way.
 Mao's prolonged absence from Peking while important
 events were transpiring there is not easily explainable.
 He has met with a steady stream of foreign visitors, which
 tends to indicate that health is not a limiting factor on
 his movements.

 CYPRUS
 Tensions are high around the British sovereign base
 of Akrotiri in southern Cyprus following a violent clash
 yesterday between Greek Cypriot demonstrators and British
 base personnel.   More demonstrations are planned this
 weekend.    The demonstrators are protesting British plans
 to begin evacuating several thousand Turkish Cypriot
 refugees to Turkey today.
 British officials in London state that a group of
 about 500 demonstrators clashed with British forces at
 the edge of the base yesterday, resulting in injuries
 on both sides and the death of a Greek Cypriot youth.
 The British are bracing for more violence, particularly
 when the funeral for the Greek Cypriot is held, probably
 today or tomorrow.
 The principal British concern is to keep open the
 main road separating the Turkish Cypriot refugees in
 Paramali and Episkopi from the evacuation airfield in
 the southeast of the base.  The two are separated by
 some ten miles of open country and the refugees' move-
 ment to the air base could be subjected to interference
 by Greek Cypriots at many points.
 The potential for trouble will increase if Greek
 Cypriots prevent the airlift by blockading the Turkish
 Cypriots or if intercommunal clashes occur outside the
 British base.   In case of a blockade, which the British
 would be unwilling to break, the Turkish government might
 consider a sea-lift of the refugees.   Should Turkish
 Cypriots outside the base be threatened, Ankara might
 well order its forces on the island to move into the
 Greek Cypriot sector in a rescue operation.
 Anti-British demonstrations in all major Greek Cyp-
 riot towns yesterday and Thursday were generally orderly,
 but two British properties in Limassol were bombed and
 several vehicles burned.  More protest marches are
 planned for this weekend and, in view of rising tensions,
 they are likely to be less orderly.

 Greek Cypriots, many of whom are refugees driven
 from their homes in the north, are particularly incensed
 that the Turkish Cypriot refugees will eventually be re-
 settled on Greek Cypriot properties in the Turkish Cyp-
 riot sector of the island.
 Foreign trade registered a deficit of $3.4 billion
 last year, according to preliminary official figures,
 in contrast with a surplus of $1.4 billion in 1973.
 December was the only month the French achieved a
 seasonally adjusted surplus--$89 million.   Exports in
 that month rose as sales of machinery and equipment to
 oil-exporting countries and elsewhere apparently picked
 up.    Meanwhile, imports declined, reflecting a slump in
 French industrial activity and declines in the prices
 of some imported raw materials.
 France will run another large deficit in its trade
 account this year.   Improvement achieved in the final
 quarter of 1974, however, makes Paris' objective of hold-
 ing this year's deficit below $2.5 billion look more
 realistic.
 The higher price of imported crude oil was the main
 cause of deterioration in the trade balance last year.
 Oil imports rose almost $7 billion in value, while fall-
 ing nearly 6 percent in volume.

 The cabinet met yesterday to discuss the Communist-
 sponsored unitary labor law that has placed severe
 strains on the three-party coalition.   Results of the
 meeting are not yet available.
 The non-Communist parties in the government oppose
 the law because they believe it will facilitate the
 Communist Party's control of the country's entire labor
 movement.  The Communists already dominate the single
 labor confederation inherited from the right-wing regime
 that was overthrown last April.
 The Armed Forces Movement, which shares power with
 the three political parties, has already announced its
 support for the law.   Some members of the Movement's
 leadership may be having second thoughts, however, be-
 cause of the heavy opposition the law has encountered.
 The Lisbon press yesterday gave heavy coverage to the
 proceedings at a Socialist Party rally that denounced
 the monolithic labor concept and emphasized the need
 to preserve workers' freedom.
 Justice Minister Zenha told an enthusiastic audi-
 ence at the rally that "the working class is not the
 property of any political party, nor of the state."
 The leader of the Socialist Party, Foreign Minister
 Soares, also made a glowing defense of liberty that
 was widely reported in the press.
 If the law is not approved, it will be the most
 serious defeat the Communists have had since partici-
 pating in the government.   It could reduce their in-
 fluence in an area where they have been strong.   Most
 of their other setbacks have been in areas where they
 were seeking to establish influence.

 ETHIOPIA
 The ruling military council is growing impatient
 with the continuing acts of terrorism carried out by Eri-
 trean rebels, despite the rebels' reported acceptance
 earlier this week of a temporary truce.
 A government broadcast on January 16 complained that
 the separatists had earlier in the week initiated a new
 wave of violence, including bombings at the Asmara post
 office, kidnapings, and an assassination.  The govern-
 ment warned that its search for a peaceful solution should
 not be taken as a sign of weakness and threatened repris-
 als against agitators.
 The communique coupled these warnings with a renewed
 call for a peaceful solution to the Eritrean insurgency.
 It blamed the rebellion on the divisive policies of the
 previous regime and on a "few" Eritreans.  These state-
 ments may be an attempt to keep alive the three-cornered
 talks that have been in progress among the council,
 Eritrean notables, and rebel leaders inside Eritrea.  The
 talks, however, appear to be foundering on rebel demands
 for independence; the council is only willing to discuss
 more autonomy.

 President Maria Estela Peron has stifled legislative
 criticism of her administration by abruptly terminating
 a special session of congress.   This will seriously
 damage the chances of continued cooperation between the
 government and major opposition parties.
 Mrs. Peron attempted to justify her action by
 claiming that the most important work on the budget and
 related fiscal matters has already been completed.
 This explanation failed to satisfy her critics, espe-
 cially opposition Radicals, who had intended to debate
 controversial executive actions such as the imposition
 of the state of siege and recent federal take-overs of
 state provincial governments.
 Since the death of her husband, President Peron
 has met only twice with opposition leaders in carefully
 arranged sessions that did not allow for discussion.
 In addition, the government recently demonstrated its
 hostility to freedom of expression by shutting down
 several newspapers.
 When the next session of congress convenes on May 1,
 opposition leaders may abandon the conciliatory posture
 they have maintained thus far.  Although leading Radical
 spokesman Ricardo Balbin has sought to continue the
 "political dialogue" begun by Juan Peron, he will be
 under pressure from the left wing of his party to take
 a harder line toward Mrs. Peron, particularly if ter-
 rorism--on which the entire party supports her--ceases
 to be the major focus of attention.

 The military government is trying to improve its
 international image by demonstrating "generosity and
 goodwill" on human rights issues.
 On January 11, the government released and deported
 to Romania former foreign and defense minister Clodomiro
 Almeyda, former justice and education minister Jorge
 Tapia, and three lesser lights of the Allende era.  They
 had been in custody since the military take-over in Sep-
 tember 1973.  The day before, Gaston Pascal, father of
 Movement of the Revolutionary Left leader Andres Pascal
 Allende, was released after a month of imprisonment.
 Andres' mother, Laura, sister of the late President Allende,
 remains behind bars, but her name is on a list of 200
 detainees that the government has offered to fly to exile
 in Mexico.
 Other recent moves related to human rights include
 the drastic reduction of some 30 sentences imposed by
 a provincial military court in December 1973.   Press
 accounts suggest that the military is reviewing sentences
 imposed by military tribunals in the hectic weeks after
 the coup to rectify any errors that were committed.
 The government also appears to be seriously inter-
 ested in getting on with the original detainee release
 program it launched last September.  Willing recipient
 countries are being sought for the initial group of 100
 eligible prisoners, and another list of 100 has been pre-

 In recent months, Chilean leaders appear to Dave
 gained a fuller appreciation of just how low their inter-
 national stock had sunk.   Unfavorable action by the US
 Congress on military aid and sales of equipment undoubt-
 edly helped drive the point home, and pressure from within
 for improvement in the government's human rights perform-
 ance has been building.

 moves may be in the offing.  These are likely to include
 declaration of a lower level state of siege that would
 make wartime provisions of the military justice code in-

 civilian courts.
 In one area concerning human rights, however, the
 government is moving in a different direction.   Interna-

 An aid agreement between Hanoi and Vientiane is
 being implemented and may signal a Lao move to reduce
 its traditional dependence on Thailand for international
 commerce.   It will also allow the North Vietnamese to
 become more openly involved with the coalition govern-
 ment of Laos.
 Plans call for the goods to enter Laos on trucks
 via Nape Pass and to cross the Lao Panhandle to Paksane,
 where the merchandise will be turned over to representa-
 tives of the coalition and stored in warehouses until it
 can be transported to Vientiane.   The first shipment was
 due to arrive in Paksane on January 15, but was delayed
 because of poor road conditions.
 Because of high tariffs and freight rates in Thai-
 land, the Lao have been seeking an alternative to the
 port of Bangkok for some time.  The new aid agreement
 will link Vientiane with the North Vietnamese port of
 Ben Thuy.   Bangkok, however, will continue for some time
 to be the principal foreign trading center for Laos.
 During the initial negotiations with North Vietnam
 in late summer of 1974, Hanoi agreed to allow the Lao
 to bring in as much as 50,000 tons of goods tax free at
 Ben Thuy.   Their use of this port;during the dry season
 will provide Vientiane with a much shorter overland
 route for seaborne imports.
 In a related development, Thai and Lao officials
 are currently meeting in Bangkok to discuss the importa-
 tion and transit problem.   Press reports indicate that
 the Thais have offered a 20-percent. reduction in transit
 charges as a gesture of goodwill.

 Premier Chou En-lai told a visiting Japanese eco-
 nomic delegation on January 16 that negotiations for a
 Sino-Japanese peace and friendship treaty could be con-
 cluded within three months.   Chou also expressed confi-
 dence in Japanese Prime Minister Takeo Miki, whom Chou
 characterized as enthusiastic about promoting relations
 between Tokyo and Peking.
 Preliminary talks on the treaty began in Tokyo on
 January 16.  According to Japanese press reports, repre-
 sentatives on both sides agreed that the treaty should
 be signed at the earliest possible date.   The Japanese
 apparently hope to obtain Diet approval of the pact be-
 fore its current session ends in May.
 Both sides have already agreed to postpone negotia-
 tions on ownership of the Senkaku Islands, a contentious
 issue, until after conclusion of the peace treaty.   There
 appear to be no other issues that could cause major prob-
 lems for either side during the treaty talks.
 In putting out an optimistic view of the treaty ne-
 gotiations, both sides may have had one eye on Moscow,
 where Japanese Foreign Minister Miyazawa visited this
 week.  Early agreement on a Sino-Japanese peace treaty
 would cast into sharp relief Moscow's, lack of progress
 in developing closer ties with Tokyo.

 Mexico:  Executives of about 35 US-owned corporations
 doing business in Mexico meet today with President Eche-
 verria for a clarification of his government's position
 on foreign investment.  Echeverria will try to dispel
 uncertainties about the ambiguous investment law Mexico
 passed in 1973 by assuring the businessmen that they are
 welcome in Mexico.   At the same time, the visitors will
 doubtless detect a strong whiff of Echeverria's economic
 nationalism.   Private foreign investment, he will prob-
 ably tell the executives, should give top priority to
 serving Mexico's development.

 SIHANOUK INTERVIEW PROMOTES CAMBODIAN COMPROMISE ACCORD
 In the wake of the UN General Assembly's call for
 Cambodian peace talks, the French, Indonesians, Romanians,
 and West Germans have all indicated an interest in play-
 ing a discreet role in promoting a settlement between the
 rival Cambodian sides.   Prince Sihanouk's interview with
 a Swedish newsman in Peking, broadcast by Stockholm TV
 last Tuesday, indicates that he is attempting to encour-
 age such foreign mediatory efforts.  He may also now see
 an opportunity to increase pressure on his Communist com-
 patriots to accept a compromise settlement and to encour-
 age elements in Phnom Penh to think in terms of a settle-
 ment returning him to a position of authority.
 The Interview
 During the interview,, which actually took place in
 mid-December, Sihanouk claimed that Republican Party
 strong man Sirik Matak and Cambodian army commander in
 chief Sosthene Fernandez had in 1973 indicated a willing-
 ness to join his side.  These claims--which Sihanouk fur-
 ther embroidered in a letter to correspondents in Peking
 and added the name of Long Boret--have caused considera-
 ble stir in Phnom Penh.
 The most significant feature of the interview, how-
 ever, was Sihanouk's review of possible solutions to the
 current impasse on negotiations.  Sihanouk said:   "If Lon
 Nol and his group want to have reconciliation with me,
 they should come to us, join us, in the framework of the
 United Front."   He elaborated further by saying,  "we may
 enlarge our government, including some rightists," and
 "we are no longer talking of executing" members of the
 Lon Nol government.   Officials in Phnom Penh who chose
 not to participate in the "enlarged government" would be
 free either to stay in Cambodia or to leave once the new
 "government" came to power.   Sihanouk claimed, however,
 that negotiation "with the rightists...as equal partners"
 was impossible.   The Prince said that his "proposal" had
 not yet been approved by Khmer Communist leaders who were
 insisting that "about six" top Phnom Penh leaders "with-
 draw."

 Sihanouk's Purpose
 Sihanouk thus appears to have put on public record
 what he has long said privately:   that he himself would
 welcome a compromise settlement--presumably based on some
 sort of a coalition arrangement--but his hands have been
 tied by the intransigence of Khmer Communist leaders.
 There are a variety of reasons why Sihanouk would want
 at this time to publicly air the differences between him-
 self and the Communists.  The most obvious is to demon-
 strate to aspiring mediators that there is some flexibil-
 ity in his position and that initiatives should be pur-
 sued.   The Prince may, in fact, believe that time is
 running out for him given his progressive loss of author-
 ity to the Khmer Communists--a fact dramatized this week
 by the formal transfer of most cabinet posts in Sihanouk's
 "government" to the Khmer Communists.
 If the Communists succeed, through their current
 effort to interdict the Mekong River, in forcing the
 Phnom Penh government to capitulate or negotiate on the
 Communists' surrender terms, Sihanouk's chances for a
 comeback could evaporate completely.   In the more likely
 event that the current Communist dry season campaign once
 again ends on an inconclusive note, Sihanouk no doubt
 hopes that a discouraged insurgent leadership would be
 more willing to consider the option of negotiations.
 Thus, Sihanouk's interview, which implicitly puts the onus
 for continued warfare on the in-country insurgents, may
 have been designed to encourage such an evolution in
 Khmer Communist strategy.   Whatever the case, the Commu-
 nists have not yet taken direct note of the interview
 and their official broadcasts continue to take a hard
 line toward any "compromises" with the "reactionary
 clique" in Phnom Penh.
 Sihanouk's interview also seems aimed at softening
 his image in Phnom Penh.  The Prince surely recognizes
 that his past threats of dire consequences should he re-
 turn to power must have given second thoughts to those
 in Phnom Penh who might otherwise be encouraged to press

 for a deal to end the war.   Ambassador Dean on January
 14--several days after local newspapers had given wide
 coverage to the Swedish interview--found no less a per-
 sonage than Sirik Matak, who played a key role in Siha-
 nouk's ouster, singularly relaxed about the possibility
 of the Prince's return.   Sirik Matak emphasized the need
 to end the conflict during 1975, citing the waning sup-
 port in the US Congress for Indochina.
 Reaction from Phnom Penh
 The official reaction in Phnom Penh to the Swedish
 interview has been low key, and Prime Minister Long Boret
 has indicated that his government will avoid any future
 polemics with the Prince.   This policy is no doubt the
 result of Phnom Penh's own involvement in international
 mediatory efforts.   The government, for instance, has
 recently requested Algerian and Tunisian aid in arrang-
 ing meetings with the other side and has shown interest
 in the private efforts of a West German official to spark
 a dialogue.   A semiofficial Phnom Penh newspaper also
 applauded French interest in resolving the conflict as
 evidenced by President Giscard d'Estaing's comments on
 the Martinique communique on December 20.  Long-standing
 Romanian efforts through Peking to broker peace are also
 continuing with the apparent blessings of the Lon Nol
 government.
