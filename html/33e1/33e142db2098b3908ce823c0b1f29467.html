 MOSCOW URGES OPEC UNITY, "PRESSURE" ON WESTERN MONOPOLIES
 While Moscow had refrained from any substantial. original comment
 on recent criticism of high oil prices by the President and
 Secretary Kissinger, it had been quick to replay negative reaction
 from spokesmen for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
 (OPEC).  As late as 5 October, Moscow's "unofficial" Radio Peace
 and Progress in Arabic reminded Middle Eastern listeners of calls
 for reduced oil prices by the President and Secretary Kissinger.
 But regular Soviet media generally have reverted to doctrinaire
 explanations of Western agitation for a reduction of oil prices.
 Thus, Moscow Arabic- and Persian-language broadcasts argue that
 an "anti-Arab imperialist conspiracy" led by Western oil monopolies
 :is behind the current campaign to reduce oil prices, and commentators
 urge unity and joint action to "pressure" the monopolies by member-
 states of OPEC.
 "INTERNATIONAL MONOPOLIES"      A Moscow broadcast to Iranian
 BEHIND OIL CRISIS               listeners on the 3d, arguing that
 "imperialist companies" in the West
 were trying to place the "heavy burden" of the capitalist world's
 oil, inflation, and economic crises on the shoulders of oil-producing
 countries, noted that OPEC members expressed their opposition to
 the Washington conference of the World Bank and International
 Monetary Fund by refusing to attend.  The commentary cited the
 Teher in paper KAYFIAN--often quoted recently in Soviet comment
 for Middle Eastern audiences---to the effect that the OPEC members'
 national interests "demand that the price of oil not be decreased."
 The commentary concluded that success in the OPEC struggle against
 "the common enemy, oil imperialism" or organizations like the
 World Bank and the IMF, depended oar OPEC unity and "pressure on the
 monopolies through joint efforts."
 PRAVDA commentator Peresada on the 4th derided as "untenable"
 Western press claims that the capitalist woriI'. economic crisis
 and "so-called energy crisis" had beer exacerbated by OPEC oil
 price increases and export restrictions.  He argued that "international
 monopolies" themselves had fomented the crisis in order to preserve
 their "superprofits" and monopolize the market and had circulated
 the "fairytale" that OPEC had exacerbated the West's economic problems
 when they saw the end of cheap hidd].e Eastern oil.

 "ECONOMIC WAR"        Illustrative of the much more critical and
 DECLARED BY U.S.      anti-U.S. stance of Moscow's ostensibly
 "unofficial" Radio Peace and Progress was a
 5 October commentary for Arab listeners.   It declared flatly that
 "public opinion in the Middle East believes that the pressure and
 threats put on the oil-exporting states by the United States
 indicates in fact a declaration of economic war."  The commentator
 concluded with a veiled suggestion that if such "pressure" continues,
 the OPEC countries could find themselves "compelled to take what-
 ever measures they think appropriate to protect their legitimate
 interests.    Liberally quoting from Arab newspapers, the commentator
 .toted charges that "American colonialism" sought to weaken the
 Arab states' position on Middle East issues, undercut the /,ribs'
 international support, and split the "united front" of developing
 countries and incite them against the Arab states.
 By contrast, Moscow's pragmatic approach to detente-related
 U.S.-Soviet cooperation on energy matters was illustrated by
 Soviet media treatment of the first meeting in Washington
 (3-5 October) of the joint U.S.-Soviet commission for cooperation
 in the field of energy--a commission set up by the 28 June 1974
 agreement signed in Moscow during former President Nixon's visit.
 TASS' positive, straightforward reporting on the commission's
 first activi.ties completely ignored world and U.S. energy crisis
 issues, while quoting the Soviet delegation head as praising
 "successful" cooperation and "mutual benefit" to the two countries
 through the new bilateral arrangement.
 MOSCOW RETICENCE ON       Soviet media have re,iained much more reticent
 INTERNATIONAL ACTION      and noncommittal, however, in regard to
 joint international efforts to resolve the
 oil price conflict be.cween oil-exporting and oil-importing nations,
 efforts that usually have been Western-initiated.  PRAVDA's Peresad:_;
 vaguely suggested, after referring to "positive trends" at the
 present stage of international relations, that such trends "dictate
 the need to establish and comprehensively develop equal economic
 cooperation among all countries."  Current Soviet reportage on the
 recent Washington IMF session uniformly disparaged it as a "capitalist"
 conclave aimed against OPEC.  Moscow also was consistently negative
 about the February 1974 Washington energy conference, predicting
 its failure in advance and stressing Western disarray and distrust.*

 conference is discussed in the TRENDS of 23 January 1974, pages

 COM1ENT MARKING WAR ANNIVERSARY REFLECTS CONTINUED RIFT
 In limited comment pegged to the first anniversary of the October
 1973 Middle ,"ast war, Moscow has conveyed a message of continuing
 dissatisfaction with key aspects of Egypt's foreign and domestic
 policies under President Sadat.  As on past occasions, Moscow's
 principal complaints have focused on Egypt's critical attitude
 toward Soviet military and economic aid, its increased cooperation
 with the West, and Egyptian economic trends away from socialist
 policies.   Strongly reinforcing this recent expression of Moscow's
 displeasure with Cairo was the preponderant theme of Soviet
 material on the war ann ive_sary--the vital necessity of Soviet
 diplomatic and material support, in the past and the future, for
 Arab succes,3 in the conflict with Israel.
 Much of the anniversary commentary reflected continued resentment
 over Sadat's public criticism, made on several occasions after
 the war, disparaging the value of Soviet military aid to the
 Arabs.   Saclat had referred, for example, to untimely deliveries
 and inadequate quantities of military supplies and to th.  inef-
 fectiveness of Soviet weapons i_ combat.   Scviet sensitivity to
 such charges was evident in a Moscow radio commentary by A. Timoshkin,
 broadcast to Arab listeners on 6 October, which praised the Syrian
 military effusively for having "proved that Soviet military
 equipment is not inferior to that of the Israeli army," adding
 that "it is actually superior to it in many aspects."
 A two-part Moscow radio commentary by Yuriy Potomov oiu 4-5 October,
 titled "Lessons of the October Mar," also defended the value of
 Soviet weapons, using a transparent polemical device to make its
 point by selectively quoting Sadat against himself but mentioning
 his name only when citing the references approvingly.  Thus, noting
 that Sadat had recently stated that "the crossing of the canal
 and the October war were possible due to Soviet weapons," Potomov
 observed further that "even the most uninformed on military matters"
 must realize Soviet deliveries of weapons and training in their use
 did not begin the day the war started, adding "how insipid to allege,
 as some have done," that the USSR did not give the Arabs modern
 weapons, that it prevented the Arabs from carrying out certain
 military operations, and that it wanted to maintain a state of
 "no war, no peace."

 9 OCTOBER 1974
 Soviet concern over Egypt's increased diplomatic and economic
 ties with the West since the war--as well as a residue of
 resentment over the relatively small Soviet role played in
 the disengagement negotiations--.was also evident in anniversary
 comment.   The Potomov radio commentary on 4-5 October, for
 example, probably had Secretary Kissinger and his contacts
 with President Sadat in mind when it asked rhetorically whether
 the "positive changes" of the October war were "all the result
 of activity of some statesmen in some countries--men who are
 capable of working miracles and changing from the helpers of
 the aggressors into the friends of those subjected to the
 aggression."  Asserting that such a judgment would be "super-
 ficial and untrue," Potomov reminded his listeners of other
 factors, such as the oil embargo and Arab "solidarity."  His
 predictable main conclusion, however, was that the "fundamental
 preconditions" for the Aral) states' successes in the October
 war were their long-time "progressive domestic_ policies,"
 combined with foreign policies of close cooperation with the
 Soviet Union and other socialist states.  The final lesson for
 Arab audiences to remember from Potomov's and other Soviet
 commentators' analyses was explicitly that future Arab successes
 would depend on the same domestic and foreign preconditions.
 PEKING      Peking conveyed a decidedly anti-Soviet slant in
 marking the anniversary, giving only perfunctory
 attention to the Arab conflict with Israel and its U.S. backer,
 while focusing on the October war as a great victory by Egypt
 against Soviet control and interference.   Lengthy NCNA articles
 on 4 and 6 October dredged up allegations of Soviet perfidy since
 the 1967 war and hailed moves by Sadat to check Soviet efforts
 to "sabotage" last October's attack.  They charged that Brezhnev
 had worked closely with former President Nixon to impede the
 Arabs' advance in the Sinai and that Kosygin's October 1973
 visit to Cairo was part of a heavyhanded Soviet effort to stop
 the fighting.  Reviewing strains in Egyptian-Soviet relations
 over the past year regarding arms supplies, repayment of debts,
 bilateral visits and propaganda attacks, the Chinese lauded
 Sadat's efforts to diversify Egypt's sources of aid, noting
 especially Cairo's closer ties with other Arab nations, the
 reestab'jl.islunen*_ of relations with Washington, and the risr_ of
 U.S. influence in the area at Soviet expense.

 GDR  25TH  ANNIVERSARY
 BREZHNEV, HONECKER SPEECHES EMPHASIZE BLOC SOLIDARITY
 The 25th anniversary of the GDR on 7 October was the occasion for
 strong reaffirmations by Honacker of East Germany's solidarity
 with Moscow--a status newly proclaimed in a revised GDR constitution
 which went into effect on that date--and for tributes by the SED
 leader to Brezhnev, who was the star of the festivities.   Brezhnev
 got more lavish praise than at the last comparable ceremonial
 occasion in East Berlin, the Eighth SED Congress in June 1971.
 Neither Brezhnev nor Honecker mentioned the proposed European and
 world communist party conferences in their major friendship rally
 speeches on the 6th.  Brezhnev's fairly lengthy, tl.ough standard,
 discussion of the Chinese was preceded by a briefer, more restrained
 allusion to Peking by Honecker in his opening speech.
 HONECKER      While the new GDR constitution, which eliminates
 language reflecting East German dedication to eventual
 all-German unification, was not mentioned by either principal, the
 GDR's new unq?'alified identity as a socialist state allied with
 Moscow was clearly underscored by Honecker.  Thus, after declaring
 that the GDR's development was inconceivable without its alliance
 with the Soviet Union, the SED leader added that, "being an integral
 part of the community of socialist states, our GDR now belongs to
 the strongest and most influential power in the world, to the power
 of socialism which is firmly rooted on the three continents of our
 planet."  In stating that the GDR is prepared to further develop
 relations with capitalist states, including the FRG, on the basis
 of sovereignty and equality, Honecker stressed that "the centerpiece"
 of East German foreign policy would continue to be the strengthening
 of its alliance with the USSR and the other states of the socialist
 community.   In this connection, he underscored the close connection
 between the GDR's industrial successes and CEMA economic integration.
 In addition to the expected tributes to Brezhnev in his Karl Marx
 Order award speech on the 6th, Honecker also began his rally speech
 the same day with a lengthy eulogy of the Soviet leader.  Welcoming
 Brezhnev as "our good friend and comrade," Honecker praised him as
 "the envoy of the Soviet people which .  .  . through the great peace
 program of the 24th CPSU Congress is again thoroughly changing the
 world."  While thus firmly supporting Moscow's detente policy,
 Honecker did not reiterate the principle of "coordination" of foreign
 policy by the socialist states--a principle which Moscow and its

 orthodox allies have stressed since the July 1973 Crimea conference
 ?              and which Brezhnev cited in his speech at  the East Berlin rally,
 Honecker did, however, mention coordination of foreign policy
 in his GDR anniversary article published in PRAVDA on the 4th.
 Honecker delivered a brief criticism of the PPC for allegedly
 aiding the antidetente forces and supporting NATO and the EC.
 He had registered a similarly low keyed criticism of Peking in a
 Warsaw speech in June.   On both that occasion and the present one
 he avoided the "Iiaoist" epithet used by both Poland's Gierek and
 Brezhnev, respectively.
 BREZHNEV      As he had done in Poland in July,.Brezhnev answered
 the lavish praise accorded him by his host with only
 a brief, standard tribute in return.  Thus, in his rally speech
 the Soviet leader attributed the GDR's economic achievements to
 the two-million-strong SED "led by the true son of its people,
 steeled antifascist, and prominent figure in the international
 communist movement, Erich Honecker."  Ile included a more generous
 rE.ference to Ulbricht than Honecker had made, listing the late
 SED leader with such "hallowed" names as Pieck and Grotewohl who,
 he said, had written "glorious pages" in the history of German
 socialism and would "forever remain in the memory of their
 desce..'lants."  Honecker, by contrast, had merely listed Ulbricht
 with a large number of "unforgettable" German revolutionaries of
 the past.
 Brezhnev reminded his hosts that it was "the concerted efforts of
 the fraternal socialist countries," embodied in the Warsaw Pact
 organization, that had frustrated alleged imperialist attempts
 to "crush" the young East German state and paved the way for
 official international recognition of the GDR.  He went on to
 stress the importL ce of the Warsaw Pact countries' "coordination
 of political efforts in the international arena" in strengthening
 peace and detente.
 In contrast to his 21 July speech before the Polish Sejm, Brezhnev
 included some critical references to the Chinese leadership in his
 remarks.  Terming the 1949 revolutionary victory "a great event in
 the life of China," the Soviet leader attacked "the Maoist leaders"'
 for their current split from the other socialist countries and for
 their oppositf.on to detente.  He called on "the Chinese people
 themselves" to change these policies.  As in his 24th congress
 speech in 1971, Brezhnev declared that the USSR would "continue
 exerting efforts to normalize relations" with the PRC.

 BREZHNEV, HONECKER ON     Brezhnev in his major address on the 6th
 FRG RELATIONS          took the unusual step of discussing at
 considerable length Moscow's relations
 with Bonn, making it clear that the Soviet leadership wished to
 see continued improvement in East-West German relations.  Asserting
 than the policy of "actively developing relations" between the
 FRG and the socialist states "already justifies itself in practice,"
 Brezhnev pointed out that agreements with the FRG of recent years
 "are being constantly filled with real content" and that "we are
 prepared" to continue this policy and "presume the other side" is
 also interested.   Ile then went on to say that Chancellor Schmidt was
 expected soon in Moscow on an official visit and favorably noted
 statements by FRG Government lepuers on the "continuity" of Bonn's
 foreign policy.  At the same time Brezhnev took an indirect swipe
 at Bonn over  the establishment of the FRG Federal Environmental
 Office  in West Berlin, deploring the move as an attempt "to
 get special advantages counter to the Quadripartite Agreement on
 West Berlin," and declaring that all the agreements with the FRG
 were too important to be made the object of a "political game."
 Honecker, who spoke before Brezhnev on the 6th, referred only
 briefly to relations with Bonn, but expressed the optimistic
 opinion that there were "possibilities" for achieving "additional
 positive results."  It was on 27 September that the GDR People's
 Chamber adopted the law removing all references in the 1968
 constitution to a united German nation or people and to future
 reunification of the two German statr,.   According to the new
 "socialist constitution," which became effective as of the 25th
 anniversary, the GDR is now a "socialist state of workers and
 peasants," "forever and irrevocably allied with the USSR."
 Honecker mar::ged to avoid any reference to "reunification" or
 "nation" in his remarks on the constitutional changes on the
 27th.  In his anniversary address on the 6th, however, he paid
 some deference to the East German people's interests in and
 feelings for its historical traditions,  declaring that the GDR
 has preserved "all the good ideas" of German history and that
 "we are preserving and treasuring this great heritage."

 COMMUNIST  RELATIONS
 BELGRADE MAINTAINS COOL ATTITUDE IN COMINFORMIST AFFAIR
 Belgrade has given its first indication that it may have received
 some assurances from the bloc countries involved in the recent
 "Cominformist" conspiracy that such activities would not be
 permitted in the future.  Meanwhile, at least one Yugoslav
 newspaper has criticized Moscow's public handling of the issue,
 strongly implying that the latter had .meddled in Yugoslav affairs.
 The press spokesman for the foreign affairs secretariat, Milan
 Zupan, in a briefing for newsmen on 3 October, acknowledged that
 the "party leaderships of certain countries" had been "informed"
 by the "LCY leadership" about the trial of the Cominformist group.
 As a result of the contacts, he said, Yugoslavia had been given
 "assurances" that "no emigre activity against Yugoslavia will
 be allowed."  Zupan avoided identifying the three countries
 allegedly involved--the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
 He did, however, go on record to deny Western press reports
 that Belgrade had declared persona non grata "three diplomatic
 representatives of socialist countries" in connection with the
 affair.  That the contacts took place at the party level--and
 were subsequently announced by a government official--underscored
 fito's intention not to allow the affair or Yugoslavia's reaction
 Lo endanger state relations with the bloc countries involved.
 Indeed, Zupan's remarks seemed designed to portray Belgrade as
 approaching the problem with diplomatic equanimity   This follows
 the pattern in the Yugoslav press since Tito's 12 September
 revelation of the arrest and trial of the group, which has
 emphasized the need for vigilance against hostile forces but has
 avoided inflaming LI,e issue or pointing the finger at Moscow.
 An exception has been Ljubljana's DELO, which on 28 September
 openly criticized Moscow's first public response to the affair
 and in a separate article criticized in a thinly veiled manner
 Moscow's general attitude toward Yugoslavia.
 THE DELO ARTICLES     The first article scored a 27 September
 PRAVDA commentary which had concentrated
 primarily on discrediting Western press reports about Soviet
 military intentions toward Yugoslavia and had mentioned-the
 group's arrest and trial only as an aside.  DELO pointed out
 that PRAVDA, "which undoubtedly expresses the official position

 OF the Soviet leadership," was guilty of a'?(,.(i.ng "the very
 essence of the problem" because it "clues nk     t all mention"
 that the .coup involved were "Cominformists" and that they
 were "linked with anti-Yugoslav emigrants abroad."
 The serond DELO article avoided mentioning the Soviet Union
 or any other country by name but was clearly aimed at the
 alleged foreign supporters of the group.     Using 'I'ito's call for
 greater vigilance against hostile forces as a springboard,
 DELO criticized those who denigrate Yugoslavia's on brand of
 socialism and contend that "it is a verita)le crime not to
 copy" the so-called "ideal societies."  It particularly criti-
 cized "tlic. embassy of a great foreign state" for indirectly
 attacking Yugoslavs  through the propaganda it distributes.
 While the propaganda materials "never contain an ill word
 about Yugoslavia," DELO pointed out, they draw attention to
 negative phenomena, such as electricity shortages and nationali-
 ties problems.  '1'lie "message of this polemic," I)ELO concluded,
 is clearly to criticize the Yugoslav system, adding that "it is
 not a long way from this to extending assistance to those of
 our emigrants abroad who want the social system changed."
 Whether the DELO articles have been published with the regime's
 approval is hard to say.   Despite the Federal Government's
 efforts to increase control over the provincial press, DELO,
 organ of the Slovene Socialist Alliance, has maintained a
 degree of independence.   Neither of the articles has been
 replayed by the media in Belgrade.

 INDOCHINA
 GOVERNMENT STATEMENT FORMALIZES PRG CALL FOR THIIEU'S OUSTER
 Vietnamese communists have given the offical imprimatur of a PRG
 statement to the call--first revived by Hanoi in August--for Thieu's
 overthrow and replacement by an administration willing to comply
 with the Paris agreement.   Giving added impetus to the demand, the
 8 October government statement pledged that when Thieu is replaced
 the PRG will be ready to engage in "serious negotiations" with a
 new administration to arrive at a "speedy settlement" of South
 Vietnam's affairs.   Since the revival of the issue of Thieu's
 ouster in mid-August, for the first time since the Paris accord,
 low-level propaganda has continued to lend support to the "people's"
 move to oust Thieu, and has occasionally even raised the issue of
 negotiations after he is gone.*
 Since the Paris agreement, the PRG has generally 11 'mited its
 government statements on Vietnam to major policy dem9rches such
 as the 22 ilarch 1974 six-point proposal--the last previous government
 statement--or linked them to significant events such as the first
 anniversary of the signing of the Paris agreement.  Why the government
 statement was released at this Mme is not cir~.ar, although it may
 reflect a communist desire to authoritatively record their position
 in anticipation of the upcoming visit to Moscow by Secretary
 Kissinger.  Prior to former President Nixon's visit to
 Moscow in June this year and Secretary Kissinger's trip to Peking
 last November, Hanoi and the PRG appeared to be attempting to focus
 international attention on their complaints through high-level
 official statements and authoritative media comment.
 The PRG statement reiterated in standard fashion charges of U.S.-
 Saigon "sabotage" of the Paris agreement, U.S.  "involvement and
 interference" in South Vietnamese affairs, and escalation of the
 war through pacification and "nibbling" operations.   The statement
 took particular note of the "impossible" life of the people ruled
 by the Saigon regime, portraying the many political, economic, and
 social woes allegedly inflicted on them. by the Thieu administration.
 While the media have never been reticent in passing judgement on
 what they see as shortcomings of life in the GVN, offi_ciai statements

 have not ordinarily been the vehicle for such detailed reminders
 as provided in the current statement.              According to the statement,
 the people "can bear this no longer" and this accounts for a
 "movement that has erupted violently" in the South to gain redress
 for these supp.,sed grievances, for national concord an! reconciliation,
 for implementation of the Paris agreement, and for the overthrow of
 Thieu.   In addition to expressing strong support for this movement,
 the statement issued a series of "firm demands" for realizing the
 "speedy settlement of the internal affairs of South Vietnam," includ-
 ing the demand for the "overthrow of Nguyen Van Thieu and his gang
 who constitute the main obstacle to the solution of the political
 issues in South Vietnam at present, and the setting up in Saigon
 of an administration that wishes peace and national concord and is
 willing to implement the Paris agreement."
 STATEMENTS UNDERLINE KHIEU SAMPHAN'S ROLE IN CAMBODIAN FRONT
 The increasingly prominent position of RGNU Defense Minister and
 Deputy Prime Minister Khieu Samphan in the Cambodian Front leader-
 ship was underscored in recent days with the release of a series
 of four appeals in his name and an interview with him offering the
 first authoritative Front statement on the upcoming UN General
 Assembly debate on Cambodia.  While Khieu Samphan has issued such
 appeals in the past--his last one almost a year ago dealt with the
 dry season offensive--a series of directives such as the current
 appeals for greater resistance to Lon Nol normally would have been
 attributed also to other Front ministers, Iiou Youn and Hu Nim.
 Similarly, Khieu Samphan's comments on the UN representation issue
 in his 27 September AKI interview impinged upon Prince Sihanouk's
 traditional role as the leading Front spokesman on foreign policy
 issues.   Sihanouk did not issue his first statement on this year's
 UN debate until eight days after the Khieu Samphan interview.
 The four appeals, dated 27 and 29 September and 1 and 3 October,
 were addressed, respectively, to four different audiences--students,
 soldiers, monks, and government personnel still under Lon Nol's rule--
 and seemed designed to capitalize on recent unease in Phnom Penh
 stemming from  the  decline in U.S. aid and stringent economic reforms
 recently undertaken by the Phnom Penh government.   Thus, while
 praising the present military situation in general terms and reaffirming
 Front determination to fight until its five points are achieved,

 Khieu Samphan focused on the newly volatile Phnom Penh political sit-
 uation, stating that the people have launched a "general uprising"
 against Lon Nol rule and that the present situation in Cambodia has
 entered a "new stage."  Emphasizing popular dissatisfaction with the
 economic measures, which have devalued the currency and led to
 tremendous price increases, the appeals said that Lon Nol's lack
 of territory and resources and the declir,:: in U.S. aid necessitated
 such steps.  Asserting repeatedly that an end to U.S, aid would bring
 the immediate -ollapse of the regime, the defense minister added
 that "the U.S. imperialists themselves face immense economic crises"
 and "are in no position to help their puppets."  The 27 September appeal
 also took note of the recent return to Phnom Penh of Lon Nol's
 controversial brother Lon Non, stating that the latter had ""laid bare
 his fascist nature" by allegedly ordering the disbanding of the
 Cambodian teachers' association last month.
 In his interview on the United Nations, Khieu Samphan strove to play
 up the Front's stature--reputing claims of territorial control,  popular
 support, and international backing--and to portray the Lon Nol regime
 as a pathetic dependent of the United States.  He was c4,tiously
 optimistic regarding the outcome of this -rear's debate,  though he
 warned against the continuing "deceptive maneuvers" of the United States.
 Sihanouk's statement on 5 October, as reported by NCNA on the 8th,
 buttressed Khieu Samphan's stature in the course of rebutting
 the charge that the ';GNU represents a government in exile.   He
 played up Khieu Samphan's position as a Front leader both within
 Cambodia and in foreigr affairs, stating that "the Americans
 themselves recognize ti-at 11r. Khieu Samphan, head of our govern-
 ment inside Cambodia, is a remarkable figure in Cambodia and in
 the international arena."

 NGUYEN HUU THO LEADS NFLSV/PRG DELEGATION IN EAST EUROPE, MPR
 Recent visits by NFLSV/PRG leader Nguyen Huu Tho to four East
 European states and Mongolia continued a world tour begun a year
 ago to express thanks for support received 'during the Vietnam
 war.  Tho had visited China, the Soviet Union, and the East
 European members of the ICCS--Hungary and Poland--during November
 and December 1973, and he was in North Korea late this August.*
 Following last year's pattern, the Tho delegation has signed
 agreements for aid to the PRG in the coming year in each of
 the countries visited.  Tho has now gone on to visit Syria
 and Iraq; he had visited several African countries is well as
 Yugoslavia in September 1973.
 EAST GERMANY      During Nguyen Huu Tho's 5-11 September stay ii:
 East Germany, GDR State Council Chairman Willi
 Stoph hosted the South Vietnamese at traditional receptions, dinners,
 and rallies, represented the GDR in the off4_cial talks, and signed
 the joint communique on the visit.  An aid agreement with the
 Germans, signed on the 9th by PRG Minister Nguyen Van Hieu and
 Deputy Chairman of the GDR Council of Ministers Gerhard Weiss,
 was briefly described in the final communique as providing for
 nonrefundable economic aid to the PRG in 1975.  Hieu also signed
 the aid agreements concluded on the other stops on the trip.
 Remarks by Tho and Stoph at a 5 September arrival dinner set forth
 basic views which were repeated in the other major addresses
 during the visit.  The texts of their remarks were published by
 NEUES DEUTSCHLAND, but the excerpts published by Hanoi and PRG
 media focused on criticism of the United States and Saigon and
 omitted Stoph's references to detente.  Tho stressed that the
 present unsatisfactory situation in South Vietnam was due to U.S.
 "interference and aggression," denied Washington charges that all
 parties to the Paris agreement have violated it, and criticized
 President Ford for stating that he would follow the policies of the
 former administration.   Stoph directed his criticism at Saigon for
 violating the agreement "with U.S. support"--a formulation also
 used by the German side in the joint communique.  While thus stopping

 short of the harsher V._etnamese indictment of the United States,
 the Germans went beyond the stand taken by East Europeans during
 Tho's visits to Poland and Hungary last year, when they criticized
 "imperialist" support for Saigon without mentioning the United
 States.
 Tho met with SED First Secretary Erich Honecker on the 9th and,
 according to a cryptic VNA report, the two sides discussed "a
 number of important problems concerning the situation in South
 Jietnam and the GDR on which the two sides held identical points
 of view."  The East Berliv radio account of the meeting gave
 more detail on the exchange, reportin; taat Tho paid tribute to
 the USSR and other socialist states for warding off aggression
 and strengthening the South Vietnamese "liberated areas."
 Honecker, according to the radio, praised the contributions to
 socialism, peace, and detente by the 24th CPSU Congress and the
 socialist community's coordinated foreign policy.
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA      Czechoslovak Premier Lubomir Strougal, acting
 for ailing President Svoboda, hosted and held
 talks  with  the South Vietnamese delegation during its 11-16 September
 visit to Czechoslovakia.  The delegation also met with party chief
 Gustav Husak and concluded an agreement on free economic assistance
 for the PI:G in 1975.  RUDE PRAVO's accounts of toasts at the welcoming
 banquet on 11 September indicated that Strougal only indirectly
 criticized the United States in a reference to Saigon "and its
 allies"; the paper summarized the portion of Tho's remarks on the
 situation in South Vietnam, eliminating any direct reference to
 the United States.   The joint communique on the visit, however,
 put Prague on record as condemning the Saigon Administration,
 "relying on the support of the United States."  The South Vietnamese,
 in the communique in Czechoslovakia and elsewhere on the tour,
 directed criticism primarily at the United States, rather than
 Saigon.
 ALBANIA      The South Vietnamese delegation was warmly welcomed by
 an impressive array of party and state officials when
 it arrived in Tirana on 16 September.  During the visit, which
 concluded on the 20th, the delegation was hosted by Chairman of
 the People's Assembly Presidium Ilaxhi Lleshi and received by
 party First Secretary Enver Hoxha.  As.would be expected,  Lleshi
 joined  Tho in speeches denouncing the U.S. role in Indochina and
 went on to single out China for praise and to criticize the "two
 imperialist superpowers" and detente.  Vietnamese media reports on
 the visit predictably quoted extensively from the anti-American

 passages, but omitted Lleshi's references to the PRC and his
 allusions to the Soviet Union.   In the joint communique at the
 conclusion of the visit, the Albanians joined with the PRG in
 charging that the United States was the "chief culprit" responsible
 for the situation in South Vietnam.   As in the earlier stops on
 Tho's tour, the communique noted that a nonrefundable aid agreement
 for 1975 had been concluded.
 BULGARIA      The Bulgarians were more restrained than Tho's other
 East European allies in backing iRG complaints about
 U.S. involvement in Vietnam.  Thus, speeches by tht delegation's
 host, party First Secretary and State Council President Todor
 Zhivkov, critically noted the historical U.S. role in Vietnam before
 the Paris peace agreement but referred only to current actions by
 "external imperialist forces" without mentioning the United States.
 The Lulgarian side in the joint :ommunique similarly only condemned
 "imperialist forces" aiding Saigon.  Vietnamese accounts of the
 communique included the standard statement that an agreement on
 nonrefundable economic aid for 1975 had been signed.   The text of
 the communique published in the 25 September RABOTNICHESKO DELO,
 however, did not include the specific qualification on nonrepayment,
 referring simply to an agreement on economic assistance.  Tho's
 official visit in Bulgaria was from 20 through 24 September,
 but the delegation vacationed on the Black Sea coast for several
 days before leaving for their next stop in Ulaanbaatar.
 MONGOLIA      Party First Secretary and Chairman of the MPR People's
 Great Hural Presidium Tsedenbal hosted the South
 Vietnamese delegation during its 30 September-4 October stay in
 Mongolia.  Speeches by Tho and Tsedenbal followed the pattern set
 in most of Eastern Europe, with Tho placing the primary blame for
 the "tense" situation in South Vietnam upon the United States
 and Tsedenbal criticizing the Saigon administration, which he said
 relies on the "support of the U.S. imperialists."  The two sides
 signed an aid agreement for 1975 and 1976, described in the joint
 communique as "gratuitous."

 C H I N A
 PRC UN SPEECH HAILS THIRD WORLD, RIDICULES U,S,-USSR DETENTE
 China's chief UN delegate-. Chiao Kuan-hua in his 2 October address
 to the General Assembly  r:t unexpectedly  reviewed the inter-
 national scene in the framework of "three worlds," hailing the
 successes of the Third World against the superpowers of the
 "first world."*  He asserted that the past year has seen tie
 Third World emerge as the "main force" in the revolutionary
 struggle against the superpowers.
 While Chiao typically was much more critical of the Soviet Union
 than the United States, this year's speech differed notably in regard
 to superpower relationships from the one lie delivered last year
 at the UNGA.  Thus, while in 1973 lie displayed concern over
 such results of detente as the U.S.-Soviet agreement on the
 prevention of nuclear war, this year he pictured people through-
 out the world as "seeing through" detente.  He remarked that it
 was after the "stack of" agreements at the second U.S.-Soviet
 summit that the Middle East war broke out and after "more
 agreements" at the third summit that the "Cyprus events" occurred.
 The Soviet Union was accused of hawking the "quack medicine" of
 detente, and criticized for its use of "empty talk" on dizarmament
 to cover arms expansion, and for its expansionist ambitions. in
 /,rica,  the Middle East, Cyprus, the Balkz,ns and South Asia.
 In pointing up the Third World victories of the past year,
 Chiao devoted special attention to the use of raw materials as
 weapons.   He claimed that the oil weapon had opened up a new
 dimension in the Third World struggle, one which "far exceeds the
 scope of the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle."  Showing
 some sensitivity to the problems caused non-oil producing Third
 World states, Chiao noted that "ways should be sought" to resolve
 their difficulties.
 Without mentioning the United States, Chiao rejected the recent,
 tougher line on oil-pricing.   Asserting only that "some people"
 say that current economic difficulties are caused by high oil
 prices, Chiao attacked this "specious argument" and supported
 *  A period of increasing Chinese attention to and support for the
 Third World countries was climaxed last April by Politburo member
 Teng Hsiao-ping's speech to the UNGA special session.   See the

 efforts by developing nations to control their national resources as
 a basic challenge to the old economic n'.der of "exploitation and
 plunder."  While Peking media have not explicitly mentioned remarks
 on oil pricing by the President and Secretary Kissinger, Chiao
 apparently was referring to those remarks when he admonished that
 "To fly into a rage is futile.  To bluff is also futile."
 Though duly calling attention to recently heightene'I Chinese
 warnings over the "danger of war" stemming from U.S.-Soviet
 competition; Chiao carefully refrained from saying that the danger
 had become worse over the past year, asserting only that "in our
 view, at least one cannot say it is less."  He also added a
 reference to Mao's dictum that "revolution," not war, represents
 the main trend in the world today.
 While restating Peking's tough preconditions for the convening of
 a world disarmament conference and advocating the development of
 "necessary and independent" defense capabilities by non-superpower
 states, Chiao expanded on Peking's recently displayed flexibility
 regarding nuclear-free zones by explicitly supporting for the
 first time separate proposals by Iran and Pakistan for the establish-
 ment of nuclear-free zones in the Middle East and South Asia.
 Peking's new openness on nuclear-free zones is obviously designed
 to deflect Soviet criticism of Chinese intransigence on general
 world disarmament, and Chiao's position on the Pakistani proposal
 also serves to put India, with its new nuclear capability, in an
 awkward position.
 On other issues, Chiao:
 4-  Offered Peking's most explicit acknowledgment that the Cyprus
 crisis derived from Greek-Turkish hostility on the island as well
 as from superpower competition, and alleged that the USSR is
 trying to use the crisis to expand its control in the Balkans.
 4-  Reaffirmed Peking's belief in the need for armed struggle for
 African liberation, warning specifically that the new Portuguese
 government may not abide by its promises of decolonization and
 that Soviet neocolonialism  is a new danger to the African liberation
 movements.
 4-  Rrstated the PRC's past positions on the Middle East, Sikkim,
 Korea, Cambodia, and Vietnam, devoting special attention to withdrawal
 of UN troops from Korea, Cambodian insurgent admission to the United
 Nations, and to his call for an invitation to the PRG to send an
 observer to the General Assembly.

 PYONGYANG EMPHASIZES SUPPORT FOR STRUGGLE IN THE SOUTH
 Two recent speeches by Kim Il-song, on 24 September and 1 October,
 and a 5 October NODONG SINMUN editorial illustrate revived high-level
 North Korean public support for the "revolutionary struggle of
 the South Korean people."  This extensive public treatment of
 the issue--coming when the North-South dialog is at a "virtual
 rupture," as Pyongyang has noted several times lately--follows
 a hiatus of several years during which references in DPRK media
 to North Korean involvement in the South's struggle were mostly
 limited to standard, muted formulations.  The current references
 continue to stress the Southern origin of the struggle and deny
 DPRK instigation.
 In his 24 September speech to a group of Koreans from Japan, Kim
 noted that negotiations with the South would be fruitless if
 Seoul continued on the "road of reaction."  He called on the people
 of the South to "more valiantly come out to the struggle for the
 democratization of South Korean society," which he said was
 necessary for reunification.  Northern support for such a struggle,
 he insisted, was neither interference in the internal affa     of
 South Korea nor "intended to instigate .  . , revolution," uut
 was ratheL a "nob'   national duty" to further reunification.  In
 discussing the w(,11-springs of the struggle in the South and
 Northern support fcr it, Kim denied that the North did--or could--
 "export" revolution.   One of the tasks given to Chongnyon (the
 North Korean support organization in Japan), Kim reminded his
 audience, was to "actively support the democratic movement of the
 South Korean people," but he cautioned that Pyongyang did not
 approve of terrorist acts against individuals, such as the
 15 August assassination attempt on ROK President Pak Chong-hui
 by a young Korean resident of Japan.  What is needed, said Kim,
 is not the elimination of a particular person but the change of
 an entire social system.
 The 5 October NODONG SINMUN editorial stated that it is now important
 to strengthen the revolutionary forces in South Korea  "to firmly
 prepare the internal forces for the reunification of the country."
 Echoing Kim's speech on 24 September, the editorial rationalized
 DPRK support for the struggle in the South as being not "inter-
 ference in the internal affairs" of the South but part of the
 solution to an internal question by people of "one and the same
 blood."  The editorial also noted that Kim's 1 October speech at

 a rally for Syrian President al-Asad had "reclarified" the
 North's stand of "actively supporting and encouraging the
 democratic movement of the southern Korean people."  While
 the speech was actually devoted more to the issues of U.S.
 troop withdrawal and the convening of a great national
 congress, the editorial drew attention to those sections
 dealing with Northern support for the struggle in the South,
 repeating Kim's pledge that the North would always render
 active assistance .  .  . with might and main" to the struggle
 in the South.

 ARGENTINA
 SOVIET, CUBAN MEDIA CONDEMN TERRORISM, SUPPORT PERON REGIME
 The recent increase in terrorist activity in Argentina has evoked
 a flurry of warnings and denunciations by the Argentine Communist
 Party (PCA) of rightwing threats against  the Peronist Government.
 Soviet and Cuban reportage and comment have generally echoed
 their warnings. However, while Havana's PRENSA IATINA has openly
 referred to rumors that the rightwing terrorist organization,
 the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (AAA), alleg'dly has
 connections with the Peru  regime, Moscow has not done so.   Both
 Havana and Moscow continue to reflect confidence the Peronists
 will survive.   And both have for the most part followed the line
 of the PCA, including support for the government of Peron's widow,
 de..iunciations of terrorism, and warnings against a Chilean-style
 coup backed by the U.S. CIA.*
 SOVIET        Soviet coverage of statements and warnings against
 COVERAGE      Argentine terrorists carried in the PC', weekly
 NUESTRA PALABRA was capped on 4 October by PRAVDA's
 publication of a TASS interview with PCA Secretary General
 Geronimo Arnedo Alvarez.  Arnedo suggested as a major cause of
 the "rapid activation of reaction" in Argentina since 1 July
 the gestures by the Peronists toward the development of "business-
 like" relations with the Soviet U- Lon, Cuba and other socialist
 countries.  Arnedo claimed that opposition to such steps led to
 the current "real conspiracy" against the Peronist regime.  The
 PCA leader was quoted as saying that "native imperialists" were
 being aided by "hundreds of CIA agents" who once worked in. Chile
 and that the only defense was a "patriotic front" of Argentine
 progressive forces.
 The 4 October report echoed earlier Soviet coverage of Argentina.
 Even before Peron's death a Konctantin Geneyvandov commentary in
 PRAVDA on 17 June had warned that "ultrarightist circles," acting
 in unison with the CIA and U.S. monopolies, wanted to create an
 atmosphere of chaos that would "prepare the soil" for a change of
 regime.   In an initial commentary after Peron's death, Moscow's
 ''unofficial" Radio Peace and Progress on 3 July told Argentines
 that "oligarchy and imperialism" now might try to use the "Chilean

 recipe" to undermine the progress made by Peronism and noted
 that the PCA had joined with other "democratic forces" in
 declaring "complete support" for the administration of Mrs.
 Peron.
 As terrorism increased during the next three months, the Soviet
 media attacked not only rightwing extremists but also the Peop e's
 Revolutioi_.lry Army (ERP), which was labeled "Trotskyite" and
 said to be infiltrated by CIA agents-provocateurs.  In a Moszow
 domestic service commentary on 26 August, Valentin Mashkin
 re`erred to NUESTRA 'ALABRA's assertion that the "evil part"
 played by the ERP paralleled the earlier role of leftwing
 extremists in Chile.  However, Malenkin concluded, as has other
 Soviet comment, with the confident pr !diction that the Peronist
 government would survive and that Argc-itina's fcreign policy
 would remain unchanged.
 CUBAN         The most authoritative Cuban statement on recent
 COMMENT       events in Argentina was a David Nunez Segura commentary
 on the Matanzas domestic service on 5 October.  Nunez
 Segura stated that the Argentine rightists, who could not "hide the
 claws" of the CIA, were embarked upon a "path of jungle terrorism"
 resemblying the CIA activities in Chile.  The Argentine Anti-
 communist Alliance, Nunez alleged, was "recruited, organized and
 financed" by "North American imperialists" who were d-atermined to
 set back the development of Argentina.   He urged Argentines to
 organize rapidly to avoid a repeat of the Chilean experience.
 Nunez Segura did not criticize the Argentine government, but
 recent PRENSA LATINA reports of NUESTRA PALABRA articles seem
 to hint at increasing government laxity in suppressing rightist
 terrorism.  Thus, on 2 October PRENSA LATINA reported that the
 communist weekly "doubts the credibility" of Interior Minister
 Alberto Rocamora when he denied that "para-police groups" had
 been involved in murders; and a 25 September report warned that
 there was a plot "to either control or overthrow" the government.
 Soviet reports, by contrast, have not mentioned the AAA by nLune
 and have refrained from connecting the government with terrorism.

 USSR
 KOSYGINIS STATUS IN LEADERSHIP BOOSTED: THEN DEFLATED
 The public image of the Brezhnev-Kosygin relationship has fluctuated
 in recent weeks as each leader has been accorded; or arrogated to
 himself, a public role or prestige honor normal.?  associated with
 the other.  Kosygin's status seemed to be boosted by a late
 September announcement of the publication of his collected speeches--
 an honor thus far accorded only to Brezhnev and Suslov among the
 present collettive leaders.   Soon after, however, his status
 was clearly deflated by Brezhnev's address on economic policy to the
 1-2 October session of the Council of Ministers.  This is only the
 second time since the 1964 separation of party and government
 leaderships that Brezhnev has add:cessed the Council of Ministers, and
 his domination of the proceedings on this occasion was much more
 pronounced than on the earlier occasion in mid-1970.
 KOSYGIN SPEECHES PUBLISHED     The publication of a collection of
 Kosygin speeches and articles covering
 the entire period since Kosygin became a national figure in 1939
 was announced in the 20 September PRAVDA.  Unlike the announcement
 of Suslov's collection that appeared on the eve of his 70th birthday
 in 1972, the Kosygin announcement is unconnected with any ceremonial
 occasion or specific personal achievement.   Kosygin's 70th birthday,
 on 21 February 1974, had passed with no indication of any intent
 to publish his works.   The present decisia:, puts Kosygin one up on
 Podgornyy, who outraLks him in the hierarchy and whose 70th birthday
 in February 1973 had similarly passed with no publication of his
 works.
 BREZHNEV SPEECH     PRAVDA's 3 October ac -aunt of the 1-2 October
 c.,uncil session indicated that Brezhnev had
 delivered a "long speech" which analyzed fulfillment of the current
 five-year plan and defined the tasks for its completion.  At the
 council meeting reported in the 2 June 1970 ?'RAVDA, Kosygin had
 appeared in chargE of the session, ouening t},e meeting with a
 "report" on the outlines of the new i:ive-year plan then being prepared.
 Brezhnev had followed with a "long speech," but PRAVDA did not
 report any of Brezhnev's commouts nor even indicate the subject of
 his speech.   By contrast, the 3 October 1974 PRAVDA reported tha.
 Brezhnev's "long speech" analyzing the five-year plan had opened  -he
 meeting, carried five paragraphs on what Brezhnev said--which
 co.?;tituted the bulk of PRAVDA's report--and only noted at the end
 that Kosygin had also delivered a "speech" summing up the discussion,

 dwelling on important economic problems and "es;ecially stressing
 the great significance of the tasks set in Comrade L.I. Brezhnev's
 speech."
 Brezhnev's action--as in 1970--appeared aimed at underscoring his
 call for an increased party role in running the economy made at the
 preceding December plenum.   In his speech Brezhnev pointed out
 shortcomings in the work of some of Kosygin's ministries and
 made proposals to improve economic efficiency.   In line with his
 December plenum attribution of equal weight to "mobilizing the
 widest masses" and improving economic leadership, he gave great
 credit for economic successes to the campaign for socialist
 competition--which appears to be one of his own main contributions
 to economic policy.  In his 13 November 1973 Minsk speech, Kosygin
 had credited Brezhnev personally with proposing the 1973 socialist
 competition campaign.
 KOSYGIN ASSISTANT KILLED      During September Kosygin suffered a
 personal blow with the death of his
 longtime senior aid, A.K. Gcrchakov, in an auto accident.  PRAVDA's
 obituary on 13 September indicated that onetime textile industry
 official Gorchakov had become head of Kosygin's secretariat in
 1942 and had continued in this post until his death 32 years later.
 NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE DECISIONS ON IDEOLOGY
 Two important decisions in the field of ideology were adopted in late
 August:   a Central Commit,~ae decree censuring the Belorussian party
 organization for neglect of ideological work and the belated naming
 of a chief editor for the Central Committee's tofu theoretical
 journal KOMMUNIST.  Though the meaning and relationship of these
 two simultaneous decisions is still unclear, the very fact of their
 adoption n-ay mark the resolution of differences and a new departure
 in the ideological field.   In the matter of appointments, particularly,
 the leadership has clearly been deadlocked:   the post of chief
 editor of KOMMUNIST had remained unfilled for an unprecedented seven
 months, while the Central Committee's ?ropaganda Section has had no
 identified chief for over four years--nor a first deputy head,
 either, until recently.
 Although the Central Committee decree on Belorussian ideological work
 is being presented as the centerpiece of a national campaign to intensify
 ideological work, it will also be read as a censure for Belorussian
 First Secretary and Politburo candidate member P.M. Masherov.  The
 latter aspect of the decree is ironic since Masherov regularly

 Approved For Release 1999/09/~Sl tfATkbP85T0087  j,~   79042-2
 outdistances other leaders in harping on ideological work and political
 orthodoxy.   Belorussia ie~ one of the least likely targets for
 accusations of neglecting ideological work, since it has been virtually
 free of scandals or public cases of ideological errors.  Comments by
 Masherov specify that the censure was the work of the Secretariat--thus
 suggesting that Brezhnev organized the attack.  Although Masherov has
 joined in the chorus of praise for Brezhnev in the last couple years,
 he has long been outspokenly independent and no Brezhnev protege.
 The choice of PRAVDA first deputy chief editor V.G. Afanasyev for chief
 editor of KOMMUNIST ends a long deadlock existing since late January
 when A.G. Yegorov was removed amidst signs of disfavor and controversy.*
 In recent years, Afanasyev, Fresu:'iably enjoying Brezhnev's confidence,
 has become one of the rPgi.^.c's most prolific and authoritative
 spokesmen on theory.  However, his numerous articles do not clearly
 identify his stand in the present bitter philosophical and economic
 disputes, instead suggesting a c.3utious middle-of-the-road position
 reflecting the consensus of the Politburo.
 In a possibly related decision,  :he vacuum in leadership of the Central
 Committee's Propaganda Section r:cently was partially filled.  As
 revealed in an August ZHURNALIST account of a midyear meeting and
 confirmed in the 10 September PRAVDA, longtime Agitprop deputy head
 G.L. Smirnov has been promoted ,:o first deputy head.  Though Smirnov's
 political orientation is not clear, he played a key role in pr,  firing
 the censure of the BelorusF ian party organization, apparently .! ,:aiding
 the commission to investigate Belorussia's ideological problems shortly
 before his promotion.  He succeeds apparent moderate A.N. Yakoviev,
 who had been removed froi,: :his post and exiled to Canada as ambassador
 in mid-1973 after authoring a controversial November 1972 LITERARY
 GAZETTE article attacking Russophiles.   The last identified head of
 Agitprop, V.I. Stepakov, had been ousted in mid-1970, and no
 successor has ever been publicly identified, although Ideology
 Secretary Demichev appears to act as chief in fact if not in title.
 DECREE ON BELORUSSIA      The Central Committee decree on Belorussian
 ideological wor   'a- announced in the
 31 August PRAVDA and, following customary practice, cited both
 positive and negative work.  That the thrust was basically critical,
 however, was indicated by its complaints that some Belorussian organs
 had neglected ideological work and by its order that Belorussian leaders
 improve the choice of ideological cadres and end shortcomings.  The
 negative interpretation was reinforced by details provided in First

 Secretary Masherov's long 13 September speech on the decree at a
 republic aktiv meeting. Although he went to great lengths to
 point out all the positive statements in the decree, he also admitted
 that in adopting the decree Moscow had repudiated as inadequate his
 own efforts to tighten up and had characterized the shortcomings in
 his domain as "serious."
 As Masherov noted in this speech, published in the 14 September SOVIET
 BELORUSSIA, he had already thoroughly criticized ideological short-
 comings at a 29-30 April 1974 Belorussian Central Committee plenum and
 had called for ideological tightening up.   "Nevertheless," he said,
 "we have to admit that the CPSU Central Committee helped us see some
 existing shortcomings more sharply" and to see omissions in local work.
 Masherov mentioned that a commission had been sent from Moscow to
 investigate Belorussian ideological work.   The commission apparently
 was headed by Agitprop deputy head G.L. Smirnov, who visited
 Belorussia about this time and spoke on current ideological problems
 at the 30 April republic plenum.  After the commission's
 investigation, Masherov was called to the Central Committee Secretariat
 to report and, as Masherov remarked, the discussion in the Secretariat
 was marked by "ve;.;; high party demandingness" and the "secretaries
 of the CPSU Central Committee and officials of Central Committee
 sections, while as a whole positively evaluating" the Belorussians'
 work, also made a number of criticisms.   Mzsherov's specifying of
 the Secretariat makes Brezhnev's role in the decree clearer, since
 Brezhnev, as General Secretary, is in a position, both legally and
 politically, to dominate Secretariat decisions.  The only other Politburo
 members in the Secretariat are Suslov and Brezhnev allies Kirilenko
 and Kulakov.
 The new decree and Masherov's discussion of it specified few concrete
 shortcomings; the decree simply calls on the Belorussians to do everything
 better, giving the impression of nitpicking.   Masherov mentioned
 only one specific charge raised by the Central Committee against the
 Belorussians:   that labor absenteeism reached 56,000 for the year
 1973 and rose to 30,000 for just the first half of 1974.  Even Masherov's
 long 29 April plenum speech concentrated on ending administrative
 inefficiency, raising labor productivity and increasing ideological
 aggressiveness and cited few actual ideological mistakes.   Indeed,
 under the tough ideological policies of Masherov and his predecessor
 Mazurov Belorussia has enjoyed a virtually spotless record as far
 as ideological shortcomings are. concerned, and.Masherov speeches have
 been notable for their consistent stress on intensified ideological
 struggle, more aggressive ideological training, suppression of local
 nationalism and prevention of economic abuses.

 AFANASYEV APPOINTMENT     The appointment of 52-year old philosopher
 Afanasyev as chief editor of KOMMUNIST was
 revealed in KOMNUNIST, No. 13, signed to press 5 September.   He had
 not been listed on the board in issue No. 12, signed to press
 13 August, thus dating his appointment in late August--at the same
 time that the decree on Belorussia was announced.   The first issue
 of KOMMUNIST under Afanasyev carried the new Central Committee
 decree.  Other members of the editorial board remain as before.
 Afanasyev was specially favored in late 1968, when after several years
 as head of the scientific communism department of the Academy of
 Social Sciences he was named deputy chief editor of PRAVDA in charge of
 theory--a post created specially for him.   In 1968-69, reflecting
 the leadership's alarm over revisionist trends, he concentrated on
 conservative themes, defending central planning, the leading role
 of the party and proletariat, and the primacy of the USSR in world
 communism.   In mid-1970 he was promoted to first deputy chief editor
 of PRAVDA.
 In recent years he has written numerous articles and books on
 subjects such as administration and management, economic reform and
 the scientific-technical revolution, but his writings appear to
 carefully expound middle-of-the-road positions apparently reflecting
 a consensus of the party leadership, rather than breaking any new
 ground.  A notable November 1971 QUESTIONS OF PHILOSOPHY article
 criticized both "conservatives" who resist cybernetics and also those
 who think computers can run the whole economy, and stated that some
 decentralization of economic management was necessary.   His most
 recent notable articles were a January 1974 QUESTIONS OF PHILOSOPHY
 article which appeared pro-Brezhnev in arguing the need for a strong
 leader and only a minimum of collectivity,* and an 11 January 1974
 PRAVDA article expounding on themes raised at the December 1973
 Central Committee plenum, urging use of modern administrative
 methods and increased power for consumers to force improvement of
 product quality and assortment.   In the PRAVDA article he cited
 all Brezhnev's controversial December plenum statements on
 asserting a "party style" and "party approach" in leading the
 economy, on adopting a "really scientific, party basis" for economic
 administration, and on warning. against a "technocratic" approach.
 But he balanced all this by recalling Lenin's demand for separation
 of the functions of party and state and his warning against
 "petty interference" by the party in running the economy.  Lenin's
 statements, he declared, retain their validity today and cases of
 such party interference still occur.  Despite his prolific writings,

 however, his stance in the controversies between liberals and
 conservatives in the fields of philosophy and economics is not clear.
 Judging by the publication dates given in the journal, the first
 issue of KOMMUNIST under Afanasyev was apparently assembled already
 last July but signed to press only on c September.  Normally issues
 are prepared over a span of one to three weeks. and signed to press
 only a few days later.   Further, the 14-17 July dates would indicate
 that issue No. 13 had been prepared before issues No. 11 (prepared
 11-19 July and signed to press 29 July) and No. 12 (prepared 1-10
 August and signed to press 13 August).   Errors in such matters are
 possible but extremely rare.

 HOXHA ON U.S.1SOVIET TIES:  In a harshly worded speech, Albanian
 party chief Enver Hoxha has rejected any intention of establishing
 diplomatic relations with either the United States or the Soviet
 Union.  His remarks, delivered 3 Octol,er on the eve of Peoples'
 Assembly elections, were directed mainly against alleged diplomatic
 overtures from Moscow and   "traitors"  and  "agents" who favor
 better Moscow-Tirana ties.  Hoxha noted that such elements had
 been "caught redhanded" and that the "iron broom is sweeping our
 ranks clean of them."  In the same context he denied rumors that
 Albania was "split and gnawed at by the worm of dissension."
 These remarks and other indications seem to give substance to
 Western press reports that Defense Minister Beqir Balluku has
 been ousted for disagreeing with 1-loxha's hardline stance toward
 Moscow.  Balluku's activities have not been reported since 18 June,
 and his name was dropped from the list of Peoples' Assembly candidates.
 Hoxha also had particularly harsh words for Bulgaria's Todor
 Zhivkov, but he pointedly expressed interest in improved relations
 with neighbors Yugoslavia and Greece.
