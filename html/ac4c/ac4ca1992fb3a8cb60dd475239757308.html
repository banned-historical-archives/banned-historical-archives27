 INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM
 China and the Lesser Dragons
 Summary
 Following the excesses of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion, one of China's first foreign policy efforts
 was to repair badly frayed relations with its Asian
 Communist allies, North Vietnam and North Korea.
 Both Hanoi and Pyongyang responded positively to
 Peking's overtures, and China's relations with
 both improved steadily.  Over the past year, how-
 ever, the once-parallel tracks of Sino-Vietnamese
 and Sino-Korean relations began to diverge.  Fol-
 lowing the announcement of President Nixon's
 planned trip to China in 1971, Sino - North Viet-
 namese relations moved toward a period of tension,
 while Sino - North Korean relations became more
 cooperative and harmonious.
 The contrast is not hard to explain. North
 Vietnam sees its vital interests threatened by
 warming Sino-US relations.  North Korea appar-
 ently believes that, by welcoming these events,
 it will further many of its own objectives.
 Hanoi suspects that the nascent Sino-US rapproche-
 ment foreshadows reduced Chinese material support
 for North Vietnam as well as reduced backing for its
 war aims. Pyongyang, on the other hand, is not
 actively engaged in a military attempt to reshape
 its position on the peninsula.   It has lived un-
 happily with the status quo for almost 20 years;

 of Current Intelligence and coordinated with the

 now it sees in the Sino-US thaw an opportunity
 to gain increased international recognition and
 to move toward Korean reunification through a
 diplomacy of moderation.
 While Peking is acutely aware of the needs
 of its two allies, its policy toward them has
 been shaped by broader Asian and worldwide inter-
 ests.   Harmony in bilateral relations has been
 important, but not paramount   In the mid-19.60s
 for example, the Chinese not only allowed, but
 furthered, a deterioration of relations with its
 Asian Communist neighbors. Much of Peking's be-
 havior during this period can be attributed to
 the internal stresses of the Cultural Revolution,
 but this is by no means the whole story..  Even
 at the height of the Cultural Revolution, Chou
 En-lai intervened decisively to prevent a sharp
 decline in Sino-Cambodian relations; presumably
 similar measures could have been taken with
 respect to Hanoi and Pyongyang had the Chinese
 wanted to do so.
 Nevertheless, China and the other Asian Com-
 munist states had much in common in addition to
 their Marxist-Leninist background.  The Chinese
 have viewed US troops in South Korea, and more
 recently in South Vietnam, as a threat not only
 to their Communist neighbors but ultimately to
 themselves.  The opening of the Sino-Soviet rift
 notwithstanding, the US "menace" could not be
 ignored.   Peking's views on this matter began to
 change following the Soviet build-up_ on its
 northern border, the shock of the Soviet-led in-
 vasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, and the Sino-
 Soviet border clashes of 1969.  As the level of
 American military involvement in the Vietnam war
 steadily declined and as Peking's rivalry with
 the Soviet Union intensified, Moscow began to
 loom as the greater threat to Chinese security.
 The changes that have occurred in Peking's rela-
 tions with its Asian allies in the past year
 have largely grown out of this changed perspec-
 tive.   In embarking on its current path of cau-
 tiously bettering relations with Washington,

 Peking obviously ran the risk of incurring Hanoi's
 wrath and of making its relations with Pyongyang
 more difficult.
 In these circumstances, Peking has been re-
 markably successful in eliciting praise and even
 policy coordination from the North Koreans; Pyong-
 yang at present is a smiling dragon. Things have
 not gone as well with Hanoi, but Pelting has none-
 theless succeeded in avoiding a drastic deteriora-
 tion in relations.  To some exl:ent, this has been
 possible because Peking has not found it necessary
 to make the hard choices that might endanger its
 relationship with either Washington or Hanoi.   Pe-
 king has been tacitly aided in this by Moscow's
 reluctance to place competition for Hanoi's favor
 ahead of its own efforts to better relations with
 the US,  suggesting that the old Hanoi-Moscow-Peking
 triangle is now overshadowed by the larger Washing-
 ton-Moscow-Peking triangle.   This makes North Viet-
 nam's balancing act that much harder and leaves
 Hanoi a most unhappy and frustrated lesser dragon.

 Background
 Peking's relations with Korea and Vietnam are
 strongly influenced by history.   In addition to
 their proximity, both northern Korea and northern
 Vietnam are parts of the Chinese culture zone; both
 at times were parts of the Chinese empire, and both
 were tributary states of China until well into the
 19th century.   This legacy has contributed tension
 and a fear of Chinese domination as well as strong
 cultural ties that militate against any irrevocable
 break.
 Other links have been forged in the more recent
 past.  The Chinese Communists gave substantial aid
 to Ho Chi Minh's liberation forces well before the
 1954 Geneva conference brought North Vietnam into
 being.  And while Soviet arms were used extensively
 in the Korean War, it was-Chinese troops who fought
 alongside the North Koreans.  The lesser Communist
 powers are also China's only allies in Asia, both
 having signed mutual defense treaties with Peking
 in 1961.
 China's relations with the two states never-
 theless have been stormy at times, especially
 since the Sino-Soviet rift widened in the early
 1960s.  Thereafter, whenever possible, Pyongyang
 has tried to balance Moscow against Peking.  And,
 following the overthrow of Khrushchev in 1964 and
 the Soviet decision to assume an active role in
 supplying North Vietnam militarily, a triangle of
 power relationship emerged involving Hanoi, Mos-
 cow and Peking.  The North Koreans and the North
 Vietnamese accepted aid, assistance, and advice
 from both Communist giants, but by playing one
 off against the other, they retained considerable
 policy independence.
 China's relations with Hanoi and Pyongyang
 declined following the onset of the Cul-'%.ural Rev-
 olution in 1966.  Within a year, North Korean
 Premier Kim Il-song was being viciously attacked
 as a "revisionist," and "Red Guard diplomacy" was
 attempting to export the Cultural Revolution to
 the ethnic Chinese communities in both Asian

 Communist states.  Following a Red Guard attack on
 the North Korean Embassy in Peking in 1967, Pyong-
 yang recalled its ambassador, and Peking responded
 in kind.
 Sino-Vietnamese relations reached a low point
 in the spring of 1968, when Hanoi agreed to par-
 ticipate in peace talks with the US in Paris.   At
 the time, Peking's approach to the war wa  to couple
 cautious practice with strident propaganda; while
 carefully avoiding direct military intervention,
 Peking encouraged Hanoi to continue its protracted
 struggle against the US.   To demonstrate its dis-
 pleasure over the opening of the Paris talks,
 king virtually ceased its propaganda support,
 negotiations as a US hoax.
 In August 1968, Sino-Soviet relations took on
 an added dimension after the Soviet-led military
 intervention in Czechoslovakia and the enunciation
 of the Brezhnev doctrine.   These developments had
 a sobering impact in Peking and contributed to the
 policy shift toward moderation that was to become
 far more evident in 1969 and 1970.
 Following the Ninth Party Congress in April
 1969, the trend toward an "open door" diplomacy
 accelerated, and Peking placed a high priority
 on restoring good relations with both Hanoi and
 Pyongyang.  A high-ranking North Korean delega-
 tion attended China's National Day celebration
 in October 1969, and by February 1970, ambassa-
 dors were again exchanged.   Chou En-lai's visit
 to Pyongyang in the spring of 1970 was his first
 trip outside China since mid-1966 and was highly
 successful.  Sino - North Korean relations were re-
 gaining the warmth of the period before tie Cul-
 tural Revolution.   Relations with North Vietnam
 also steadily improved as Peking began to acknowl-
 edge the existence of the Paris talks and muted
 its previous insistence on uncompromising, pro-
 tracted struggle.     In March 1971. Chou En-lai

 went to Hanoi, repeating the success of his 1970
 visit to Pyongyang, and capping his post - Cul-
 tural Revolution efforts to restore close rela-
 tions with North Vietnam.
 Between late 1968 and early 1971, the re-
 sponse of Hanoi and Pyongyang was similar:  both
 welcomed the changes in Peking's policy as suiting
 their interests in maintaining friendships with
 both the Soviets and the Chinese and enabling them
 to retain their freedom of action.   But, in the
 spring and summer of 1971, China's foreign policy
 entered a new phase to which its Communist neigh-
 bors reacted differently.
 NORTH VIETNAM:   Renewed Strains
 The first sign of apprehension appeared in
 Hanoi immediately following Peking's invitation
 to the American ping pong team in April 1971.
 The signs were greatly multiplied after the July
 announcement of the President's intention to
 visit China.   Hanoi's language in a Nhan Dan
 editorial on 19 April and a Foreign Ministry state-
 ment on 21 April was even more blunt than during
 the worst period of the Cultural Revolution..
 Hanoi warned Peking not to be deceived by the "so-
 called Nixon doctrine," a "counterrevolutionary
 global strategy" that resorts to "insidious tricks
 to sow division among the socialist countries" in
 an attempt to pressure the Vietnamese people into
 accepting US conditions.   Indeed, the general
 thrust of the North Vietnamese rhetoric was that
 big powers could not pressure small powers--a re--
 flection of Hanoi's latent but continuing fear that
 its interests would again be sacrificed to great-
 power politics, as they were at Geneva in 1954.
 This fear was not just the paranoia of a
 small country long at war.   The Chinese response
 to American actions in Vietnam had been restrained
 from the becrinnincr.

 the fact that Mao Tse-tung felt it possible to
 launch the divisive and debilitating Cultural
 Revolution the following year reflected this esti-
 mate.  Throughout the war, Washington and Peking
 had signaled each other that each hoped to avoid
 direct confrontation, and by the autumn of 1970
 Mao told               that he believed Washington
 was indeed getting out of Indochina.   This was
 certainly not what Hanoi believed at the time,
 and the implications for North Vietnamese war
 aims were obvious.
 Indeed, it seems a moot point whether Pe-
 king has ever been greatly interested in Hanoi's
 ultimate war aims.   When Prince Sihanouk was in
 power, Chou En-lai carefully played on the
 Prince's sense of a "special relationship" with
 China that somehow was meant to offset pressures
 from Hanoi.  While Peking has deliberately taken
 a supporting and secondary role to North Vietnam
 in Laos, it has never allowed Hanoi to eclipse
 the Chinese entirely.   Even when Peking's propa-
 ganda on Laos was most bellicose, the Chinese
 maintained a diplomatic mission in Vientiane.
 All of this suggests that China views the pos-
 sibility of ultimate North Vietnamese hegemony
 over all of Indochina with something less than
 equanimity.   Moreover, as the possibility of at
 least a limited rapprochement with Washington--
 for reasons and on issues not directly related
 to Vietnam--became brighter, Peking's view of
 Hanoi's aims probably also changed.  Moscow was
 calling fur an Asian collective security pact,
 which obviously was in very large measure aimed
 against China.   If the US were to leave South-
 east Asia, the Soviets would attempt to fill the
 resultant vacuum, and China would be left to face
 Moscow alone.   In such circumstances, a military
 defeat or political humiliation for Washington
 in Vietnam probably seemed undesirable to Peking.
 At the same time, Peking obviously saw no
 utility in forcing a political humiliation on its
 North Vietnamese ally.  Humiliation was neither
 necessary nor probable since the Chinese appar-
 ently accepted the view that the United States

 was in any event prepared to withdraw militarily
 from Indochina.   There was no sign that China was
 prepared to pay such a price for US friendship,
 and Peking was well aware that its ability to in-
 fluence Hanoi was limited.   The abortive and counter-
 productive effort to turn the screws on North Viet-
 nam in the spring of 1968 was proof--if any were
 needed--that even brutal Chinese pressure did not
 achieve the desired end in Hanoi.  Moreover, the
 North Vietnamese remained balanced between Moscow
 and Peking.   Heavy-handed pressure would simply
 shift Hanoi in Moscow's direction, to China's
 detriment.
 In these circumstances China was obliged to
 tread cautiously.  The war was an obvious irri-
 tant in Sino-US relations, and ending it would be
 in Peking's interest, although not necessarily in
 North Vietnam's so long as Hanoi's maximum terms
 were unrealized.  But China could only advise,
 not coerce.  Above all, Peking could not afford
 to give Hanoi cause to believe that China and the
 US had come to a hard and fast understanding on
 a war settlement behind Hanoi's back.   In the
 months following the announcement of the Presi-
 dent's trip, the Chinese clearly were intent on
 limiting the immediate damage to their position
 and influence in Hanoi.
 To this end, Peking.simply ignored Hanoi's
 invective, while offering general propaganda sup-
 port, although not as much as North Vietnam de-
 sired or expected.  Peking also dispatched to
 -Hanoi an economic delegation headed by politburo
 member Li Hsi'n-nien, the first high-ranking Chi-
 nese leader to make a publicized visit to North
 Vietnam since Chou En-lai's trip.   Li reiterated
 in strong terms Peking's support for the Vietnam-
 ese seven-point peace plan and signed an economic
 aid agreement, a politically significant gesture
 since in previous years the North Vietnamese had
 always come hat in hand to Peking to conclude the
 annual aid deal.

 Two months later, North Vietnamese Premier
 Pham Van Dong was given red-carpet treatment during
 a five-day visit to Peking.  When he left, the com-
 munique noted that Sino-North Vietnamese relations
 were developing "on the basis of Marxism, Leninism,
 and proletarian internationalism"--a Communist catch-
 phrase denoting close solidarity and one that Hanoi
 had avoided using in this context for several months.
 Mao personally greeted Pham Van Dong, and Chou En-
 lai gave explicit assurances to the North Vintna
 These and other
 gestures seemed to mollify Hanoi, and public criti-
 cism of the Chinese subsided.
 It was inevitable that the President's trip
 itself would rekindle and reinforce Hanoi's ap-
 prehensions.  Moreover, the announcement in the
 fall of 1971 that the President would also visit
 Moscow gave the North Vietnamese new cause for
 worry.  On the eve of the President's Peking trip,
 when the Hanoi press began to give heavy play once
 again to its distaste for big-power summitry, Pe-
 king. followed its earlier pattern, overlooking
 Hanoi's rhetoric and taking steps aimed at shoring
 up the confidence of its ally.   In early March,
 Chou En-lai flew secretly to Hanoi and conferred
 with Premier Pham Van Dong and Cambodian Prince
 Sihanouk, who was there for talks with the North
 Vietnamese.   According to Sihanouk, who later
 described the visit to newsmen, Chou assured
 Pham Van Dong that Peking would not act, even
 secretly, as an intermediary between Hanoi and
 Washington in resolving the Indochina war.
 Though this, as far as it went, was exactly
 what the North Vietnamese wanted to hear, Hanoi's
 publicly stated concern continued unabated. The
 communique issued by Sihanouk and the North Viet-
 namese after Chou's visit contained adverse com-
 ments on the communique issued in Shanghai at the
 conclusion of the President's visit, and Hanoi's

 undoubtedly felt they had reason to complain.  Al-
 though the Chinese portion of the Shanghai com-
 muniqu6 did not directly contravene established
 North Vietnamese positions, its language was far
 too vague and pacific to satisfy Hanoi, and the
 Chinese evidently did not. even attempt to con-
 tradict the view of the war set forth in the US
 portion or the communique'.
 The April Offensive
 Despite Soviet and Chinese assurances of con-
 tinued support, the North Vietnamese apparently
 had come to the conclusion by the early spring of
 1972 that things were moving too quickly toward
 some degree of understanding between all the great
 powers with a stake in the Vietnam conflict.   And
 though many factors undoubtedly contributed to the
 decision to launch the April offensive, the goal
 of shattering--or at least cracking--the detente-
 in-the-making between the US and each of the Commu-
 nist great powers must have loomed large in Hanoi's
 calculations.  Through this action, Hanoi, also
 apparently hoped to refuel the lagging competition
 between Peking and Moscow for Hanoi's favor.
 Ironically, the offensive, although certainly
 a production of considerable drama, has had the
 effect of making Hanoi a less important cockpit
 for the Sino-Soviet diplomatic struggle.  Moscow
 had strengthened its position vis-a-vis Peking
 at least marginally the previous autumn and winter
 as the Chinese took their first tentative steps
 toward Washington.   But the timing of the North
 Vietnamese offensive was an obvious embarrassment
 to Moscow.   So was the subsequent US mining of
 NorL. Vietnamese harbors, which also had the ef-
 fect of drawing the Soviets more directly into
 the diplomatic maneuverings connected with the
 war.   Like the Chinese, the Soviets now had good
 reason to want an end to the conflict; they also
 had much less hope of exploiting the situation.
 By going ahead with the Moscow summit, they
 dissipated whatever advantage they had gained in
 Hanoi over the preceding several months.

 Significantly, the Chinese have chosen not to
 try to extract immediate advantage from this situa-
 tion.   Indeed, rather than offering fervid support
 for Hanoi in obvious contrast to the reluctant
 Soviets, Peking has been about as restrained as
 Moscow in responding to the stepped-up war.  As
 ou and other leaders have frequently avoided com-
 ment on the Vietnamese situation, even on occasions--
 such as banquet toasts for visiting dignitaries--
 when normal usage called for it.
 Chinese restraint did not vanish when the
 President announced his decision to mine North
 Vietnamese harbors and resume full-scale bombing
 of the north.   Characteristically, Peking waited
 three days to respond, and when an official govern-
 ment statement was issued on 11 May, it was re-
 strained and moderate.  Although it condemned the
 US military measures as a "grave step," it did not
 characterize them as a threat, challenge, or
 provocation to the Chinese people or government.
 China raised that issue only on 12 June, just 48
 hours before the public announcement that Dr.
 Kissinger would again visit Peking.  The Chinese
 statement on this occasion was clearly designed
 to preserve Peking's credibility in Hanoi, and
 the question of a threat to China has not been
 aired since.
 This lack of vigorous propaganda support for
 Hanoi even when Peking could have been expected to
 attempt to score points against Moscow, speaks elo-
 quently of Chinese distaste for many aspects of cur-
 rent North Vietnamese policy and attitudes.   Chinese
 officials, at home and abroad, have criticized the
 North Vietnamese offensive, implying that Hanoi's

 tactics were a mistake and not likely to succeed.
 Peking has given no indication that it believes the
 vigorous US reaction to be a turnabout in Washing-
 ton's desire to withdraw militarily from Indochina;
 the Chinese obviously believe Hanoi's tactics have
 done little to speed the process.
 The general Chinese point of view on Indochina
 has been fairly consistent both before and after
 Hanoi's offensive began.  Their propaganda line
 has emphasized the importance and necessity of an
 early and rapid US military withdrawal from the
 peninsula; it has treated political questions much
 more summarily and with much less precision.  The
 Chinese have not totally ignored North Vietnam's
 seven-point proposal for ending the war, with its
 emphasis on political change in South Vietnam, but
 they have treated this aspect far more cavalierly
 than Hanoi would have wished.  Moreover, Peking has
 carefully avoided attributing duplicity and evil
 motives to the US--above all to President Nixon him-
 self.  Remarks of this nature have invariably been
 edited out of Hanoi's propaganda before it is re-
 played in China.   Still more striking, Peking has
 at no point condemned the President's proposal of
 8 May for an internationally supervised cease-fire,
 US troop withdrawals within four months, and an end
 to US acts of force in Indochina in exchange for a
 return of US prisoners; Peking has rerun North Viet-
 namese comments rejecting these ideas.   It is quite
 possible that the Chinese have indicated to North
 Vietnam that they believe these terms will give
 Hanoi an opportunity ultimately to achieve its ob-
 jectives.   In fact, the Chinese could at present
 consider Hanoi's intransigence on political issues
 a greater obstacle to the realizations of Chinese
 aims in Indochina than US military actions.
 If the Chinese have been offering Hanoi advice,
 they can be fairly sure that the North Vietnamese
 will at least have been listening closely.   The
 mining of North Vietnamese harbors has made China
 Hanoi's remaining lifeline for supplies.   For the
 first time in the war China is in a position to
 Approved F

 or Release 2004/04/19: CIA-RDP85T00875R00110014
 strangle North Vietnam's war effort--and much of
 Hanoi's civilian economy as well.  All Soviet and
 East European aid, as well as Chinese supplies,
 must now pass through logistic channels controlled
 by Peking.
 There is, of course, no evidence that the Chi-
 nese contemplate a naked assertion of their advan-
 tage in order to force their will on Hanoi.  From
 their point of view, little would be gained by such
 a brutal demonstration, which would amount to an
 obvious abandonment of a Communist ally.   But Hanoi
 surely recognizes that much now depends on Chinese
 good will.  Indeed, the drawn-out argument between
 Peking and Moscow over whether Soviet ships origi-
 nally destined for Vietnam could call at Chinese
 ports may be intended for North Vietnamesc consump-
 tion in more ways than one:  both r'hina and the USSR
 seem to be protesting that Hanoi's supply difficul-
 ties are the other's fault; at the same time they
 are demonstrating that a resolution of these diffi-
 culties is not their highest priority.   Hanoi has
 almost certainly gotten this message, lictle as they
 like it.
 Having conveyed this message, together with
 their presumed advice regarding Hanoi's best course
 of action, the Chinese are also protecting them-
 selves in the event their advice is rejected.   To
 accomplish this, they need only allude to the im-
 port-ant role China must play in keeping North Viet-
 nam militarily and economically afloat; in practice,
 they are also demonstrating that this does not mean
 that Hanoi need expect to be completely abandoned.

 In short, while the Chinese are probably giving
 North Vietnam unpalatable advice, they are simulta-
 neously demonstrating their importance as an ally.
 And, as in the period following the initial announce-
 ment that President Nixon had been invited to China,
 they are attempting to limit the damage to their
 prestige and influence in Hanoi.  Peking and Hanoi
 no longer have parallel policies on Indochina, but
 there appears to be a point beyond which Peking--
 not surprisingly--is unwilling to press the argument.
 NORTH KOREA:   Kind Words
 In marked contrast to the sharp deterioration
 in Sino - North Vietnamese relations that followed
 the announcement of the President's China trip,
 Sino - North Korean relations--which were already
 on the upswing--continued to improve.  North Korean
 Premier Kim Il-song delayed until 6 August, but he
 then weighed in very heavily in favor of the trip,
 the first, and still the only, foreign Communist
 leader to do so.  Kim characterized the trip as a
 great victory for Peking and as a great defeat for
 the US policy of trying to isolate China.  Just as
 important, Kim chose the occasion to strike a new
 note of flexibility in Pyongyang's policy toward
 South Korea.
 It is quite possible that Kim's new note was
 coordinated in advance with Peking.   His formula-
 tion on the President's trip paralleled the line
 of those being used in briefing cadres in China on
 the President's visit.  Moreover, when on 5 August
 Chou restated Peking's views on the Korean question,
 iris formulation almost certainly had been discussed
 earlier with Pyongyang.   In an interview with James
 Reston, Chou said, "'To solve the Korean question, a
 way should be found to bring about a rapprochement
 between the two sides in. Korea to move toward a
 peaceful unification of Korea.   That, of course,
 takes time, but this demand is reasonable."  Chou
 suggested that a peace treaty to replace the armi-
 stice was in order.

 This attempt to focus on Korean issues was not
 isolated.   In the summer of 19 71, Peking took a
 number of steps to indicate that it believed the
 time for movement on the Korean question was at
 hand.    In June, for the first time in five years,
 Peking had appointed a Chinese representative to
 the Military Armistice Commission.   Moreover, the
 Chinese issued a strong and immediate endorsement
 of the North Korean eight-point unification plan
 and the seven demands put forward at the August meet-
 ing of the armistice commission.   Peking also en-
 dorsed and gave wide publicity to the mid-August
 opening of the Red Cross talks between Pyongyang
 and Seoul on the question of divided families.
 A new and expanded economic aid agreement was
 signed on 15 August, and three days later a hich-
 level delegation, headed by North Korea's chief of
 staff and including the commanders of the air force,
 army, and navy, arrived in Peking.   When the delega-
 tion departed on 7 September, a new arms deal had
 been concluded which provided for a significant in-
 crease in both the quantity and variety of military
 goods to be supplied by Peking.
 Coming at a time when   ere
 was little tension on the Korean peninsula, the
 arms deal appeared to be a gesture by Peking to
 consolidate Pyongyang's support for China's opening
 to the US.
 For its part, Pyongyang probably saw definite
 advantages in reaffirming a close relationship with
 Peking and in adopting its own "open door" policy.
 For 20 years the North Koreans have tried sporadic
 border attacks, subversion, and dramatic gestures
 like seizing the Pueblo to undermine South Korea,
 encourage a withdrawal of US troops, and bring all
 Korea under their rule.  This approach yielded few
 successes, and with the lessening of tensions sig-
 naled by the reduction of US forces in Vietnam and
 the thaw in Sino-US relations, Pyongyang must have
 reasoned that more could- be gained by exploiting

 the drift of events than by opposing them.                    By fol-
 lowing in China's footsteps, Pyongyang would gain ex-
 panded international, recognition and eventual accept-
 ance into the United Nations.  This more moderate
 policy line, Pyongyang may have reasoned, would
 hasten the withdrawal of US forces from South Korea
 already under way.   Domestic considerations, such as
 reductions in North Korea's defense budget, may have
 also played a part in the decision.   in addition,
 the North Koreans probably judged that Peking would
 lend no support to the "adventuristic" policies of
 the past.
 If this was indeed the North Koreans' reason-
 ing, they were almost certainly correct.   Even in
 1969-1970, when Peking first made a concerted ef-
 fort to repair relations with Pyongyang, Chinese
 statements and propaganda on Korean issues were
 notable for their lack of belligerency, and they
 almost invariably omitted Pyongyang's fieriest re-
 marks when replaying them for China's audience.
 This public position almost certainly corresponded
 closely to Peking's private views on the matter:
 China clearly did not want to improve relations with
 North Korea if that only increased the chances of
 being dragged into new and dangerous disputes re-
 sulting from Pyongyang's belligerence.   In fact,
 as Chou En-tai's remarks to Reston suggest, Peking
 is now anxious to liquidate the remaining vestiges
 of the Korean war.   This would enhance China's
 image as a reasonable actor on the international
 scene and would remove another obstacle--albeit less
 important than the Vietnam war--to better relations
 with Washington.
 The Chinese are aware that, in addition to the
 two Korean governments, four powers have interests
 in the Korean peninsula--China, the USSR, the US,
 and Japan.  Peking's moves on this complicated
 chessboard suggest that they realize a resolution
 of the long-standing Korean stalemate will have to
 take the interests of all these powers into account,
 but it is also clear that the Chinese hope to maxi-
 mize their own advantages in the process.   Thus,

 Peking appears to recognize that Pyongyang will con-
 tinue to strike a balance between China and the So-
 viet Union, and that too hard a push for North Korean
 support in the dispute with Moscow is likely to be
 counterproductive.   The Chinese expreE. ed neither
 public nor private concern when the North Korean
 foreign minister traveled to Moscow at the very mo-
 ment they were entertaining President Nixon.   In-
 stead, they appear to be making the more subtle argu-
 ment that they can offer Pyongyang more than the
 Soviets in disposing of the remnants of the Korean
 war.   This argument presumably claims that US forces
 remain in South Korea largely to "contain" Chine
 and that the current rather flexible Chinese foreign
 policy--specifically the dialogue with Washington--
 is likely to win Pyongyang benefits the Soviets
 simply cannot deliver.   In reality, Peking is far
 less concerned about the rapid withdrawal of US
 forces than its North Korean ally.  Although their
 public position calls for rapid and total US with-
 drawal, the Chinese may well feel that--as in the
 case of Vietnam--the Nixon doctrine, US budgeting
 problems, and the reduction of troops so far point
 to an eventual eradication of the US military pres-
 ence on the peninsula anyway.   The Chinese probably
 believe that too rapid a US disengagement from Korea
 would merely impel Seoul to turn to Japan for addi-
 tional diplomatic and economic support.  And while
 Peking probably understands that it would be ex-
 tremely difficult to exclude Tokyo from the penin-
 sula entirely, it certainly wishes to minimize the
 Japanese influence there as much as possible.
 In this respect, Peking's present approach to
 the'Korean problem serves the Chinese well.   Peking
 probably reasons that if it can keep the level of
 tension down in Korea, Tokyo will be far less in-
 clined to see its security in jeopardy and therefore
 will be less likely to undertake a major rearmament.
 Pyongyang has followed Peking's lead on Japan.
 Rather than continue to portray Tokyo as being
 forced by its social and economic structure to move
 inexorably toward "militarism," first Peking and
 then Pyongyang began to take the line in the fall of
 1971 that Japan was capable of avoiding this path
 Approved Fo
 and of choosing peaceful coexistence with its Asian
 neighbors.  Moreover, when Peking began in mid-1971
 to move toward normal relations with Japan, North
 Korea agreed in December to allow a semi-official
 Japanese group to set up a trade office along the
 lines of the one handling a part of Sino-Japanese
 trade.   The efforts of both Peking and Pyongyang
 clearly are aimed in considerable part at heading
 off any possible Japanese move to fill the vacuum
 as the US presence in South Korea declines.
 Given the convergence of Chinese and North Ko-
 rean interests, it is not surprising that on the eve
 of the President's visit to China, Peking strongly
 endorsed Kim Il-song's proposal for peaceful unifi-
 cation of the Koreas, and that following the visit,
 Pyongyang issued a lengthy statement commenting
 favorably on the Shanghai communique.   Using the
 visit to further its own interests, Pyongyang sought
 to score points by expressing its willingness to
 enter into its own dialogue with Washington.  The
 North Koreans also urged Seoul to enter into nego-
 tiations that would "break down barriers" and lead
 ultimately to reunification.   The two governments
 announced on 4 July that such talks had in fact
 been undertaken.
 The initial Chinese response, carried in a Peo-
 ple's Daily editorial of 8 July, leaves little doubt
 that Peking generally approved of this development.
 In particular, the Chinese seem pleased with the
 clauses calling for reunification of the peninsula
 "without outside interference."  Like the North
 Koreans, the Chinese will argue that this implies
 a diminution of US influence in Seoul, a check
 against Japan, and--perhaps above all--a fairly
 rapid dismantling of the UN machinery concerned
 with Korea.   Peking associates the UN role in Korea
 with the 195? v to in New York that all but con-
 demned the Chinese Communists as an outlaw govern-
 ment, and for obvious reasons it would like to see
 the Korean machinery phased out.
 Close coordination between Peking and Pyongyang
 on the question of UN consideration of the Korean
 Approved Fhr Release 9004104119 ? CIA_Rn1285100875R001100140013_7
 ?    Approved F
 question this fall has become clearer since the
 joint communique of 4 July.  Soon after its release,
 Chinese Foreign Minister Chi Peng-fei told
 that Peking panne
 to support Pyongyang's desire for a UN debate.  And
 even prior to the announcement on 20 July that China
 would back the draft resolution on Korea sponsored
 by Algeria and other non-aligned countries, the
 Chinese began to lobby in a number of capitals for
 support. After testing the waters earlier this year,
 the Chinese apparently have decided'to abandon
 their previous caution, largely because they now
 feel that the new :resolution, by avoiding the polem-
 ics of past Soviet and Mongolian resolutions, stands
 a much better chance of passage.  Moreover, Peking
 apparently sees an opportunity here to improve its
 already good relations with the North Koreans and
 to score points at the expense of the Soviets, who
 were reluctant to offer early support for the new
 resolution.
 For all their current cordiality, however,
 there are limits to the present relationship between
 the North Koreans and the Chinese.  North Korea is
 not going to put all of its eggs in the Chinese
 basket; the Soviet connection will be maintained.
 Indeed, recent events suggest that considerable
 Korean suspicion of China still exists.   Peking,
 in turn, views questions of concern to Pyongyang
 in a larger and wider prospective; Chinese attitude
 toward the US military presence in the south may be
 a case in point.   But both countries are interested
 in a move away from attitudes on the Korean question
 that have remained frozen for two decades.   So long
 as this is so, they will have good reason for close
 cooperation.
 This cooperation, from China's point of view,
 is largely a product of circumstances rather than
 an end in itself.   There is no reason to doubt
 that Peking wishes to continue working closely
 with Pyongyang, primarily because such a course
 coincides with larger considerations such as the
 Approved Fo
 Approved For Release 2004/04/19 : CIA-RDP85T00875RO01100140013-7
 declining profile of the US in Asia and the Soviet
 threat to Chinese security and influence.   The
 Chinese must fit their relations with their two
 Asian Communist allies into this larger frame of
 reference.   The relationship with Pyongyang fits
 well; that with Hanoi is not nearly so compatible.
 This broader view presupposes a multipolar
 diplomatic environment in which China's interests
 occasionally could coincide with those of the US
 but not often with those of the USSR.   It is cer-
 tainly no coincidence that Chou En-lai has quoted
 several times from President Nixon's speech of June
 1971 in which the President referred to five major
 centers of power, including China.  This does not
 mean that Peking will soon abandon its material,
 diplomatic, or propaganda support for the "libera-
 tion forces" in Indochina, its stronger verbal and
 diplomatic support for Pyongyang, or its champion-
 ing of small states agal.nst both "US imperialism"
 and "Soviet revisionism."  It does seem to mean,
 however, that China will not let these suppor'-ive
 activities interfere with its larger interests,
 and that it will, if necessary, at least partially
 curtail such support in deference to those larger
 interests.
 North Korea has lived with a status quo that
 clearly is distasteful to it for two decades.   Pe-
 king's changed diplomatic posture thus fits Pyong-
 yang's needs, since a relaxation of tension in the
 Korean peninsula implies an eventual change in that
 status quo.   Hanoi, on the other hand, has been
 directly and violently challenging the status quo
 in Indochina for at least 13 years, and a relaxation
 of tensions in that peninsula would mean an accept-
 ance of a status quo abhorred by the North Vietnam-
 ese.   Hence, Hanoi disagrees with certain aspects
 of Peking's present policies.   But because rapproche-
 ment with Washington has become a major element of
 the continuing Sino-Soviet rivalry, neither North
 Korea nor North Vietnam can play off the two Commu-
 nist giants for its own ends as successfully as
 before.   As a result, these lesser dragons in the
 long run are likely to consider--if not necessarily
 accept--Chinese views more carefully than ever be-
 fore.
