 THE TRANSFORMATION OF NATURE IN CHINA
 Agriculture is a critical element in China's present
 and future.  A key question -- and problem -- is the
 ability of the People's Republic of China (PRC) to in-
 crease agricultural output sufficiently to keep pace with
 the annual rate of population increase.  The answer is
 complex, but an important factor is China's progress in
 the protection, improvement, and management of its land
 resources.  Maximum benefits must be realized from
 increased use of chemical fertilizers, larger supplies
 and improved distribution of water for irrigation, new
 crop varieties, and other technological advances.  Although
 the PRC's land area of 3.7 million square miles is exceeded
 only by the USSR and Canada, its agricultural land resources
 are subject to major limitations.  Specifically:
 The amount of cultivated land is virtually
 static; a number of reasons, mostly physical,
 suggest that this will continue to be true for
 th?. foreseeable future.
 Much land now cultivated is of average to
 low productivity.

 Climatic conditions, particularly in North
 China, are highly variable, specifically in the
 amount, distribution, and intensity of rainfall,
 with resultant serious effects upon agricultural
 output.
 A sizable proportion of the land now tilled
 is subject to yearly damage from drought, flooding,
 erosion, and waterlogging.
 Environmental improvements were implicit in the major
 river basin and other water conservancy programs begun in
 the early years of PRC rule.  Additionally, China's rural
 labor was mobilized periodically to engage in local compaigns
 of ditch digging, tree planting, and a host of other activities
 designed to improve agricultural conditions through the up-
 grading of environmental resources.                             Peking characterized
 these menial tasks as an opportunity to "remake nature" and
 to put an end to natural calamities.  Nature, or the
 physical environment, was labeled an "enemy" that caused
 drought, floods, privation, and famine.
 Mastery of nature has not been an easy task,..even to
 those inspired and guided by Mao Thought..  Recent visitors
 to China, however, returning after more than 20 years, have
 been highly impressed by the altered appearance of the
 countryside and have commented on the presence of trees and
 shrubs on previously barren hillsides and extensive tree
 plantings in cities -- the results of China's "greening"
 campaign.  Other observers have remarked about the greatly
 increased water storage facilities and the expansion of
 irrigated land.
 The progress of environmental programs and their effect
 upon agricultural production are speculative and based in
 part on indirect evidence.  The record is not complete but
 at this time would include the following:
 Enough environmental improvements have been
 made to lessen the impact from either prolonged
 rainfall or lengthy dry periods.

 Water impoundments , canal s , and rel aced
 water control and storage facilities have been
 built by the millions, though most are small
 and many inadequate for intended needs.
 The Huang Ho (Yellow River) project, the
 most widely publicized and largest in scope of
 the river basin projects, has been scaled back
 drastically and altered -- principally because
 of the lack of effective anti-erosion work.
 Some improvements in the Huai and Hai basins
 apparently have been made; serious flooding is
 less likely and damage from waterlogging probably
 reduced.
 Millions of young saplings have been planted,
 but results in terms of original goals have been
 a patchwork of success and failure.
 The PRC has not claimed complete victory in its battles
 with nature, but some improver,--nts in the overall picture
 are undeniah e .  That more has not been accomplished and
 initial goal  have not been reached is due not to a lack of
 incentive or official dedication to the tasks at hand, but
 rather to the reliance upon mass labor, lack of technically
 trained personnel , failure to coordinate related projects,
 overall managerial weaknesses, and the immensity of the
 problem.

 1.  The amount of cultivated land in China is
 relatively small -- approximately 11 percent of the
 total area -- and no sizable tracts of good agricultural
 land remain unused.                                        The physical constraints that account
 for this situation can be summarized simply but aptly:
 most of China is too steep, too high, too cold, or too
 dry to support intensive, Chinese-style agriculture.
 2.  Hills, mountains, and high plateaus comprise
 more than two-thirds of the Chinese landscape -- land-
 forms ill-suited to intensive, Chinese agricultural
 practices (Map A).

 is concentrated in only 3 summer months.*  This concentration
 in so short a period poses an annual threat that meager spring
 and early summer rains will stunt the growth of spring-sown

 damage crops by local flooding and erosion.
 5.  The variability of rainfall also is a crucial factor

 conditions exist in North China, where annual variability
 (departure from normal rainfall) ranges from 20 to 30 per-
 cent -- in agricultural terms a high figure because crop
 yields are considered unstable when departures from normal
 exceed 20 percent.*  Spring and summer variability is
 especially critical and is extremely high on the North China
 Plain (Map E).  Absolute variation in rainfall amounts is

 immense in North China:  K'ai-feng has received as much as
 19.5 inches of rain in July and as little as 1.6 inches,
 and at Tientsin the range is from 15 inches to 1.6 inches.
 Finally, how much rainfall occurs during any one "rain" is
 another significant indicator of agricultural stability;
 here again, North China is frequently subject to brief
 gully-washing rains that cause flooding and erosion and
 damage water control works.  Many of the weather stations
 in North China, for example, have recorded as much as 9 to
 10 inches of rain during a single 24-hour period.*
 6.  Not only is most of China's land poorly suited
 for agriculture because of terrain and climatic factors,
 but even the presently cultivated area possesses inherent
 physical liabilities.  Only an estimated 31 percent of
 China's cultivated land is classified by PRC officials as
 "fertile," and of the remainder, 40 percent is "ordinary"
 and 29 percent "low-yielding."  Although the precise
 meaning of these terms is unclear, they at least suggest
 the shortage of good land and the predominance of ordinary
 and relatively poor agricultural land.  The Chinese also
 have been explicit in stating that sizable percentages of
 their cropped land are subject to a variety of environmental
 hazards, all of which threaten yearly crop output and over-
 all economic stability.  Again, evaluation of these assertions
 is difficult, but they do emphasize the necessity for the
 careful management and control of China's physical resources.

 * Average JuZy rainfall for most of North China is 6 to 9
 inches recorded on 9 to 13 days per month; Washington, D.C.,
 averages about the same number of days of recorded rainfall
 but its total for the month is only 4.Z5 inches.

 7.  Harmony between man and nature was a basic
 philosophy of ancient China, originating in Chinese
 folklore with elaborations from these philosophical-
 ethical precepts of Taoism and Buddhism that !,.ere
 assimilated into Chinese culture.  Practical observations
 of what happened when man tampered with his environment
 undoubtedly helped strengthen these philosophical under-
 pinnings, as suggested by the following memorial of
 Ch'eng Hao to Enperor Shen-tsung, ca. A.D. 1075, which
 stated:
 It is not merely that the nature
 of things has been violated, but
 that the mountains from which
 forests and woods grow have all
 been laid bare by indiscriminate
 cutting and burning.  As these
 depredations still go uncurbed,
 the fish of the stream and the
 beasts of the field are cut
 short in their abundance and
 the things of nature are be-
 coming wasted and exhausted.
 What can be done about it?
 8.  The belief that China had achieved a harmonious
 relationship with the earth reinforced the belief of 18th
 century Western humanists in the superiority of Oriental
 culture in general and Chinese culture specifically.
 Chinese philosophical views toward nature were contrasted
 to those of Western man, conditioned by his Judeo-Christian
 heritage: man is crew:ed i17 God's image, he has been given
 dominion over the earth, and he shall subdue nature so that
 progress will continue and a better tomorrow be realized.
 9.  In spite of official injunctions against actions
 "contrary to nature," the Chinese in the course of more
 than three millennia of intensive occupance of their land
 probably altered their environment to a greater extent than
 has any other civilization.  This record is impressive
 whether measured by the changed appearance of the Chinese

 landscape or by the inmense physical labor involved and
 the massive amounts of earth materials removed and re-
 shaped.  The North China Plain, for example, has been
 under intensive cultivation for so long that its "natural"
 vegetation still is a subject of scholarly debate.  Some
 2,000 years ago almost all of the lower Yangtze Valley
 was choked with thick forests and extensive swamps; several
 centuries of clearing and drainage work were necessary
 before the regulated, almost geometrical landscape of
 the present day emerged.  Although c.nntinued tillage and
 expansion of cultivated land produced an often dramatic
 physical modification, the process itself was viewed as
 part of a never-ending cycle of life.  The constant working
 and reworking of the soil, with continual return to the
 earth of its products in the form of compost and fertilizer,
 renewed the soil's ability to produce again sustenance for
 mankind.
 10.  Man thus was a much more active participant in
 altering the physical landscape of China than Western
 humanists realized.  The Chinese recognized that environ-
 mental mastery was not only a legacy of their legendary
 founders but also a necessity.  The manipulation and
 management of the environment were viewed, however, not as
 subjugation of nature but rather as cooperation with and
 adjustment to natural conditions.
 11.  A significant change in man-land relationships
 became apparent by the mid-19th century.  The physical
 resources upon which agriculture depended had been stretched
 to the breaking point, and, increasingly, erosion and
 flooding damaged cropland, famine became more common, and
 the general standard of living of the peasantry declined
 markedly.*  Much of this breakdown can be traced directly
 or indirectly to the rapid increase in population that had
 taken place since the beginning of the 18th century --
 from about 150 million to perhaps 430 million by 1850.
 Other factors such as bureaucratic corruption and
 inefficiency, military ineffectiveness, the impact of
 the Western nations, and fiscal problems also played
 important .roles.

 Although increased agricultural productivity was recorded
 during this time span, -nuch new land was required to pro-
 vide sufficient food for the rapidly growing population.
 Most of thi s new land was in South China, where settlers
 cleared forested uplands and planted mountain fields of
 corn and sweet potatoes.*  But careless tilling of the
 uplands speeded erosion, which in turn led to more frequent
 and serious flooding in the valleys and plains, as indicated
 by a contemporary 19th century source:
 Formerly the bed of the Hsiang River
 [a tributary of the Han River located
 in southwestern Honan and northern
 Hupeh] was several tens of feet deep.
 Ever since the systematic deforesta-
 tion consequent upon maize growing,
 the topsoil has been washed down by
 torrential rains          The further
 upstream one goes, the shallower the
 river bed becomes.  Small wonder that
 from 1821 to the present [ca.1838]
 there has hardly been a year in which
 the Hsiang River did not flood.
 12.  Pessimism permeated the reports of both Western
 and Chinese earth scientists who in the 1912-1949 period
 investigated the status of China's physical resources and
 problems.  The more striking and serious problems were in
 North China.  Although locally some progress had been made
 to combat erosion through contour plowing of slope lands
 and the construction of terraces, erosion was so widespread
 and so little ground cover remained that improvement seemed
 Corn and sweet potatoes, crops native to the Americas,
 were introduced into China in the Zate Z6th century.  They
 soon were well established in the Chinese agricultural
 system because of their high yields and adaptability to
 environmental conditions unsuited to rice, wheat, and other
 traditional staples.

 impossible without major capital-intensive projects under
 government auspices.  In contrast, management of land re-
 sources in the lowlands of South China was more successful
 principally because rice -- the dominant crop -- required
 the leveling and diking of small parcels of land and a
 carefully regulated flow of water into the fields (Figure 1).
 Consequently, irrigated rice farming produced an agricultural
 system that maximized the use of available land resources
 and minimized damage to them.  Reckless use of nearby upland
 fields continued, however, and erosion often was so rapid
 that some land had to be abandoned because of exhausted soil
 fertility after no more than two or three seasons of culti-
 vation.  By the end of Manchu rule in 1911 and the opening
 of China to wide-scale modernization, damage to the
 environment had so worsened that traditional methods of
 combating these problems no longer were effective.  The
 lack of technical knowledge of how best to combat environ-
 mental difficulties remained a serious drawback, and the
 lack of a truly effective national government prevented
 the introduction of enough technical advisors and sufficient
 capital to initiate large-scale land and water conservancy
 programs.

 "conquer" and "transform" nature, to "harness" the deserts,

 of environment-related tasks.  Recently, the "changing
 nature" theme has reappeared in the Chinese press, which
 features articles centered around Mao's instructions, in-
 dicating progress made and work currently underway.
 14.  The view of nature as an "enemy" and the
 glorification of man as an instrument of change contrasts
 with traditional Chinese views of adjustment to and
 harmony with nature.  The aggressive tone of the PRC
 leaders' rhetoric is in keeping with Marxist-Maoist views
 that conflict, contradiction, and the struggle are the
 proper condition of society and, indeed, its most i ii--
 portant dynamic.  The emphasis in Chinese treatment of
 its environmental problems has been on what man can do,
 under the guidance of the Party, to initiate change and
 bring about improvement.
 15.  Major Chinese efforts have focused on water
 conservancy and protective afforestation, including both
 large-scale state-directed and -financed projects and a
 host of local works involving little investment but
 massive amounts of rural labor.  During the early years
 of economic rehabilitation (1949-52), emphasis was on
 repair of dikes, irrigation canals, locks, and similar
 facilities.  Additionally, work commenced almost im-
 mediately on two major flood control projects, the Huai
 River and the Ching -- the latter name applied to that
 portion of the middle Yangtze River down to southern
 Hupeh,*  Later, when the First Five-Year Plan (1953-57)
 was announced, a modest amount of state investment was
 allocated to initiate major, long-term programs designed
 to control the perennially unruly rivers of North China the Huang, the Huai, and the Hai (Map F).
 The Ching project involved the construction of dikes
 and sluice gates to provide a flood retention basin for
 the Yangtze south of Slut-shih.

 16.  More specific plans relating to protection and
 improvement of the physical environment were incorporated
 in the Twelve-Year Plan (1956-67) of the National Agri-
 cultural Development Program, adopted in 1958.  These
 included such basics as increased development of water
 conservancy works, irrigation, and flood and drought
 control projects, with emphasis upon small and medium-
 sized projects, soil improvement, extension of soil and
 water conservation practices, promotion of afforestation,
 and expansion of the network of meteorological and
 hydrological stations.  Use of the commune and its
 organizational structure to mobilize the rural masses
 was the principal means specified to implement the
 objectives of the Plan.

 specific problems.  Priority was given to studies of the
 loess areas of the middle Huang Ho (Yellow River) basin
 and the extensive arid areas of western China.  By the
 late 1950's the results of some of these efforts were
 beginning to be published in the form of major monographs
 and articles in technical and professional journals.
 More specific technical material undoubtedly was forwarded
 to appropriate ministries in Peking for use in particular
 projects.
 Control l i ncl the Huang Ho
 If you wait till the Huang Ho is
 clear, how old will you be?
 18.     Matteo Ricci, the pioneer Jesuit missionary
 to China in the late 16th century, remarked that:  "The
 Yellow River has no respect at all for Chinese law and
 order.  It cc?:;ies from a barbarous region and     . fre-
 quently ravages whole districts of the realm, silting
 them up with sand, and changing its course at will."
 Though news to Europeans, Father Ricci's description and
 characterization of the river merely reiterated what the
 Chinese had known since earliest times:  control of the
 turbulent Huang Ho was the most persistent and serious
 environmental problem in all of China.
 19.  The PRC leadership placed a high priority on
 a plan to permanently control the Huang, eliminating its
 periodic floods and erratic changes in course and at the
 same time more fully utilizing the river both for power
 generation and as a source of irrigation water.  Ac-
 cordingly, in 1955 the "Report on the Multi-Purpose Plan
 for the Permanent Control of the Yellow River and
 Exploitation of Its Water Resources" was presented to the
 National People's Congress.  The plan, ambitious in concept
 and massive in scope, was based upon earlier studies and
 recommendations, plus post-1949 investigations.  It called

 for construction of a series of multi-purpose dams desinn ed
 for flood control, power generation, irrigation, and navi-
 gation purposes.  The most publicized project was the
 building of a giant hydroelectric dam at San-men (Three
 Gates), a point on the Huang upstream a few miles from
 where the river and its valley widen before emerging on
 the North China Plain (Nap F).  Smaller dams were planned
 upstream from San-men, including two on the upper Huang
 near Lan-chou, plus a series of reservoirs on principal
 tributaries.  But the key to success was, in the words of
 the plan, the necessity    , . to develop at the same time
 large-scale water and soil conservation works in Kansu,
 Shensi, and Shansi Provinces and other loess regions."
 Numerous soil and water conservancy targets were spelled
 out in the plan (Figure 2).
 20.  It probably was inevitable that the massive
 physical changes required to reduce soil erosion did not
 in fact occur to any significant degree, given the short
 time schedule for construction of the San-men project
 (1957-61), the immense size of the soil and water conser-
 vancy tasks (only 5 percent of the loess area was covered
 by trees), and the dizzying rural organizational changes
 of the period.  The San-men Dam was essentially completed
 in 1961 and a mammoth reservoir was to have been filled,
 taking several hundred thousand hectares of cropland. out
 of production (Figure 3).  But it was soon discovered that
 the silt load of the river had not been measurably reduced:
 by 1963 the penstocks were clogged with mud.  Since then
 the gates have remained open and the Huang Ho continues as
 before -- ti-nsporting its heavy burden of silt seaward.
 21.  Mention of the Huang Flo project, and particularly
 of San-men Dam, virtually ceased in the PRC press after 1961.
 In late 1963 and continuing until the advent of the Cultural
 Revolution in 1966, an occasional article appeared on proper
 techniques to reduce erosion and soil and water losses in
 the middle Huang Valley.  Only recently have press items
 reappeared commenting on the overall problem of the Huang.
 Progress is related in general terms, usually tied to one
 or more of Chairman Mao's statements, but specific references
 are to small-scale local achievements rather than a review of
 accomplishments throughout the Huang Ho basin.  No mention,
 for example, is made of the 1955 plan nor of the great mass
 of concrete at San-men.

 22.  It is clear that Chinese planners grievously
 underestimated the importance of systematic, lonq term
 soil and water conservancy work in the loess-mantled
 middle reaches (Shensi , Shansi , and eastern Kansu) of the
 Huang, origin of almost nine-tenths of the sediment load
 of the river.  Press reports of 1963 and later clearly
 indicated that diverse physical factors present in the
 middle Huang Valley had not been taken into account.  A
 December 1963 People's Daily article stated that hence-
 forth "geographical considerations based on actual practice"
 would be the criteria to be followed in future local land
 and water conservancy projects.  Earlier, for example,
 projects suitable for a particular physical environment had
 been imposed on other areas with differing physical
 conditions -- with predictable results.  In the future,
 according to the article, ".   . preventive measures [soil
 and water conservancy projects] should be geared exactly to
 the problems as they exist."

 23.     Two other problem rivers, the Huai and Hai,
 received early attention from PRC leaders.  Both river
 basins suffered from excessive loads of silt and from
 their inability to discharge through their silt-clogged
 channels a sufficient volume of water to prevent flooding
 during periods of heavy rains.  Although flood prevention
 was the most immediate } oblem, other objectives included
 water for irrigation and the generation of electricity.
 24.  Early work on the Huai consisted principally of
 repair and rehabilitation of existing facilities.  Because
 considerable engineering data were available from pre-1949
 studies on control of the Huai , the PRC was able to shift
 quickly into a comprehensive program involving the building
 of new outlets, straightening river courses, and the con-
 struction of reservoirs.  The pace, direction, and emphasis

 of the plans, however, frequently changed.  Announced
 successes were often followed by later admissions of
 failure.  Familiar problems arose -- uncoordinated efforts,
 incompetent planning, hasty work, poor maintenance of com-
 pleted works, and failure to complete basic erosion control
 in headwater areas.
 25.  By late 1972 a Chinese article proclaimed that
 the basin " . . . had been transformed."*  The construction
 work of over two decades certainly has superficially trans-
 formed the Huai basin landscape with new reservoirs, new
 river channels and outlets, and a host of lesser works
 completed.  Whether the transformation has completely
 eliminated the chronic problems of the Huai awaits the test
 of prolonged heavy rains and lengthy dry spells before a
 final verdict can be reached (Figure 4).
 26.  The Hai River, a short but important stream in
 the r,,rthern portion of the North China Plain, serves as
 the outlet -For fi vr; major streams that wind across the
 northern Plain and which unite just west of Tientsin.  This
 portion of the Plain long has been subject to serious
 flooding and its agricultural potential limited by consider-
 able amounts of waterlogged and alkalinized or salinized
 land.  Although some flood control projects were completed
 during the 1954-1960 period, very serious flooding in 1963,
 when all five rivers overflowed, prompted a decree from
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung that "The Hai Ho must be brought under
 permanent control."  (See Chronology of Water Control
 Projects and Problems . . . following text.)
 27.  A variety of projects were subsequently under-
 taken, including major drainage projects that have involved
 the digging of new channels and providing new outlets.
 Neverthel   ;, an April 2973 broadcast from i.nhoei told
 of the "first stage" of a Huai project calling for a

 Progress also has been made in relieving waterlogging and
 saline conditions, thus improving existing cultivated land
 and reclaiming additional land.  The area of alkaline land,
 according to recent reports, has been reduced by half.
 Overall, the amount of work done in the Hai basin is
 impressive (MMap G).
 28.  Although the probability of serious flooding in
 the Hai basin certainly  has been greatly reduced, the long
 tee.'m success of the present programs will depend upon
 efficient manageinient of the newly created control and
 drainage systems.  Dikes must be inspected and strengthened,
 protective vegetation on the dikes maintained, water seepage
 from streams to areas of sandy soil controlled, dredging
 continued, and pumps continually maintained and repaired.
 Improved crop yields can be expected over the next few years
 from land that previously had been waterlogged, although
 salinized soil must be leached for years before it becomes
 fully productive.  Some successes have been achieved in
 reducing the area of alkaline land, but the complicated
 network of new channels must he operatively synchronized
 to prevent the development of additional problems of water-
 logging and salinization following periods of above-normal
 rainfall.

 some duplication, including sizahle areas where replanting
 of afforested land previously had been reported as completed.
 In addition, the trees in many areas reported as afforested
 have had low survival rates, and the condition of the land
 is not now markedly different than before.  Still unreached
 is the goal, originally targeted for 1967, of increasing
 China's forested area from the 1957 base figure of 8 percent
 to 19 percent of the total land area.
 30.  Afforestation projects serve several PRC objectives.
 A major goal has been to ease a serious national timber shortage
 and to redress the re' anal imbalance of wood resources.*
 Equally important is the coordination of protective afforesta-
 tion plans with water and soil conservancy work -- erosion
 control, stabilization of sandy areas (particularly where
 they threaten cultivated or cultivable land), and related
 shelter belt plantings (Figure 5).  The PRC also has stressed
 extensive roadside plantings and the planting of trees and
 shrubs in industrial and housing areas -- a program that has
 been highly successful.
 31.  A widely publicized program begun during the late
 1950's was the "great green wall," a series of protective
 vegetative buffers designed to ward off the blowing sands of
 the Inner Mongolian deserts.  Although Chinese sources were
 vague concerning precise locational details, the "wall,"
 consisting of a series of shelter-belt systems, was planned
 to extend from the Greater Khinghan Mountains in Northeast
 China to northwestern Kansu Province.
 32.  Recent Chinese commentary has avoided discussion
 of "green walls," and articles on shelter belts have been
 confi nc.d to those in a few specific areas.  The most ex-
 tensive plantings reported and confirmed occur in the
 Wu-wei -- Min-ch'in area, in the Kansu Corridor, some 250
 kilometers north of Lan-chou.  Here plantings of several
 rows of trees to widths of about 100 meters occur in places;
 As of 1963 approximately ZO percent of China was forested,
 of which about 60 percent was located in Northeast China.

 more conlron are i rrcqul ar plots of t-rees, a situation most
 likely caused by planning and planting at different ti tees
 by separate groups.  Single rows of trees usually line
 roads, irrigation canals, and dry stream channels.  In other
 areas occasional plantings have been started, but evidence
 is lacking elsewhere in the Kansu Corridor of large-scale
 shelter belts cornensurate with the publicity over the
 "green wall."
 33.  The gap between plans and accompl i shn,ents has been
 caused by a combination of physical, political, and economic
 factors. Much of the area to be afforested consists of poor
 lane; deficient in soil nutrients.  Careful preparation of
 sites and use of fertilizers is required to insure a high
 survival rate.  The prolonged periods of dry weather that
 characterize the northern half of China pose additional sur-
 vi val probl ems .  Qualified observers al so have commented
 that in some cases species that are unsuited to the
 particular environment have been planted, with a consequent
 low survival rate.
 34.  Another key obstacle to a successful afforestation
 program has been the lack of trained personnel to oversee the
 managerial and technical aspects of the programs and the
 widespread use of rural and untrained labor to undertake the
 actual pl anti  .  Con hionl y , afforestation drives are mounted
 in late wint,,  and early spring under the direction of local
 rural administrative units that mobilize hundreds or even
 thousands of laborers to plant young saplings.  A New Zealand
 forester, S.D. Richardson, commented after train travel in
 China in 1963 that very dissimilar wooded plots could be
 found adjoining one another.  The explanation was that dif-
 ferent production teams were involved in planting and
 maintenance, and that the care and knowledge of those in
 charge of the tree planting was the major factor relating
 to success or failure.  In some areas, Richardson speculated,
 poor tree survival might be related to the inadequate supply
 of fuel and to regulations that permit individuals to harvest
 dead trees for local use.  This suggested, commented Richardson,
 "a vested interest in early mortality."
 35.  A 1963 editorial in People's Daily stated the
 need to change the idea that trees, once planted, will grow
 naturally without anything further being done.  The editorial

 also stressed the need for idealogical and educational
 work so that individuals understand " . . . the important

 sciousness of the struggle" so that "better results" in
 afforestation had been achieved compared to past years.
 The key word is "better"; quite likely, work in early years
 was done poorly and extensive replanting was necessary.
 Better management and education continue to be highlighted
 in press reports (Figure 6).  A 1972 report from Anhwei
 comments that "the importance of developing forestry is
 not fully appreciated . . . [and] . . . they [referring
 to people in "some localities"] have no time to attend to
 forestry because their grain production is not yet up to
 the quota."  The final paragraph of the article stressed
 anew the key point of management:
 One of the present important tasks
 in afforestation is to strengthen
 forestry management .  In some lo-
 calities there is still a serious
 tendency to stress planting and
 neglect managem,.nt.  Therefore all
 localities must combine the mass
 afforestation movement, as a crash
 program, with constant management
 and protection.  They must at the
 same tir,,e carefully train and de-
 velop a contingent of professional
 workers for afforestation, and set
 up and perfect the system for forest
 protection along with its required
 rules and regulations.  They must
 pay equal attention to planting and
 managing so as to raise the quality
 of afforestation and consolidate
 its gains.

 --China Reconstructs
 37.    According to a recent article in China
 Reconstructs, ". . . nature in old China became more
 unkind with each year," but in recent times the
 picture has changed greatly."  Although visible
 changes in the landscape and environmental modifications
 have occurred since 1949, questions arise as to the
 quantitative and qualitative aspects of the changes:
 How much change actually has taken place?
 How has change been effected?
 How successful have these changes been
 in the context of PRC goals?
 38.  Victory has not been claimed by the PRC in its
 battles with nature.  Reports of environmental damage
 caused by flooding, waterlogged soils, and excessive
 erosion L till continue in the press.  For example, grain
 output in the PRC is estimated to have declined by about
 The 40, 000 hectares figvre seems irrrpZausibZy high since
 it would amount to at least a third to possibly two-fifths
 of the total area of the hsien.

 10 million tons in 1972 (a drop of about 4 percent), and
 the blame for the shortfall has been attributed pri i,nari ly
 to drought, floods, and other environnl2ntal conditions.
 Almost certainly, however, recent crop losses would have
 been grr'  e r had it not been for the two decades of effort
 to contt,ui floods, extend irrigation, and lessen erosion.
 39.   Water conservancy programs have played a key role
 in PRC planning toward control and modification of the en-
 vironment.  Early and ambitious projects to control the
 major rivers of North China produced mixed results.  Initial
 objectives were not achieved because of lack of planning and
 coordination, high costs, and limited technical resources.
 A major problem was a lack of appreciation by PRC planners
 of the importance, massive scope, and complexity of the soil
 conservation and afforestation work required -- particularly
 that needed in the Huang Ho basin (Nap I).
 40.  Publicity on the Huang Ho project recently has
 resumed to the effect that flooding is basically under
 control, though use of the word "basically" strongly im-
 pl ic.s that some but not all required work is done.  In a
 word, flooding now is less likely -- but it still could
 occur.  This likelihood is given added emphasis by the
 recent admission that insufficient attention has been paid
 to silting and that only now is an active study of that
 problem being carried out.  The dimensions of the task
 confronting the Chinese leadership in the Huang Ho basin
 are best reflected in a 1971 article in China Reconstructs:
 The success in harnessing the Yellow
 River over the past 20 years or so is
 only the first step in a long, long
 march.  Advancing along Chairman Mao's
 proletarian revolutionary line, the
 people living in the Yellow River
 valley are continuing their efforts
 to harness it further._jEmphasis added.)
 More evidence of the scope of "continuing efforts" is re-
 ported in a 1972 radio broadcast from Shensi Providence
 that in 20 years of work only 20 percent of the Huang Ho
 basin [in Shensi] had benefited from soil erosion measures.

 41.  China's rural landscape has been altered markedly
 by the construction of vast numbers of water impoundments
 ranging in size from small ponds to a few large reservoirs.*
 A visual impression of the increase in size and number of
 these ponds and reservoirs, based upon a comparison of maps
 compiled prior to 1949 and after 1965, is shown on Map J.**
 Most of these areas had few if any significant t'aater storage
 facilities prior to 1949.  However, an impoundment, though
 it has some intrinsic value in regulating waterflow:-1, does
 not guarantee use of water in adjacent agricultural lands.
 Many of the smaller storage facilities l aci: sufficient
 capacity to be of use during dry spells when irrigation
 needs are greatest.  Other facilities are of limited use
 because of the lack of pumping equipment and distribution
 systems or both.
 42.  Water conservancy projects have enabled the PRC
 to increase the amount of irrigated land substantially over
 pre-1949 levels and, in recent years, to embark upon a
 rapid enlargement of high-yield farmland -- land under con-
 trolled irrigation and drainage and capable of producing
 a crop in spite of either drought or floods.***  Water
 %F
 In the 1949-59 decade, some 29 million projects reportedly
 were completed including 56 large reservoirs, about Z9 million
 small and medium-sized projects other than wells, and about
 ZO million wells.  The small size of the vast majority of
 these is indicated by the statistic that on the average each
 could irrigate slightly less than 2 hectares of farmland.
 Only those impoundments that back up at least one-half mile
 or more of water are shown because of the scale limitations of
 the source map used.  For this reason the more numerous small
 reservoirs and farm ponds that range downward to only a few
 acres in extent are not depicted.

 of high-yield farmland, see China:  Control of Water Resources

 conservancy gains have been made at a cost -- staggering
 use of labor; profligate construction of impoundments,
 canals, and other projects; and frequent ignorance or
 disregard for basic physical conditions, needs, and the
 interrelationship of projects. These shortcomings have
 plagued water conservancy programs from the very beginning
 and continue today. A coientary in the Peool e's Dai l v of
 23 March 1973 summarized the current situation as follows:
 I n evaluating the achievements of 4 rater
 conservation projects, we do not merely
 count their number but consider their
 role in increasing agricultural production.
 Constructing :dater conservation projects
 only to net state targets in disregard
 of efficiency; thinking that these projects
 once built, will naturally play their
 proper role; and only knowing how to open
 sluice gates to discharge water without
 paying attention to the output of agri -
 cultural products -- are all erroneous
 ideas and work styles.
 The key to success is thus in management and technical
 knowledge.  But as before, as acknowledged in People's
 Daily, reliance is placed upon ". . . the broad masses of
 cor,uune and brigade members to properly manage water con-
 servancy projects [and] do a good job in maintaining them."
 43.  Progress has been made in increasing the amount
 of land covered by forests and other types of vegetation
 that will slow erosion.  Although reliable data on the
 extent of progress are lacking, undoubtedly more of China
 is now "green" than has been the case for many decades if
 not longer.   Crude comparisions for one area of North China
 using maps of identical scale but compiled from pre-1949 and
 post-1965 data provide rough indications of gains made (Map H).
 Familiar problems affect the PRC's afforestation schemes:
 proper management and technical knowledge are often limited
 or lacking; investment in fertilizers and pesticides usually
 is inadequate; reliance upon annual mass labor drives to
 reach targets results in a patchwork approach to a problem

 where coordinated efforts are needed: and the result all
 too frequently is a low survival rate of the saplings and
 the consequent necessity for the work to be redone.
 44.  Programs to protect and improve China's physical
 environment have involved both major capital-intensive
 projects and local projects using China's vast, untrained
 pool of rural labor to dig, build, and plant -- making use
 of local resources, simple tools; and strong backs.  Early
 environment-related programs stressed the major projects,
 such as the comprehensive plan for development of the
 Huang Ho.  Later, Chinese planners began to place greater
 emphasis upon small-scale projects in which little i nves t-
 men't other than manpower would he required.  During the
 past decade emphasis increasingly has been on Maoist views
 that individual r.tivation and social organization are the
 keys to environmental improvement.
 45.  The most widely publicized example of this approach
 has been at Ta-chai, the model brigade tucked aw,.y in a loess-
 covered and mountain-ri nn>ed pocket of central Shansi, which
 long has played the role of exemplar for rural China (Map F).
 Dedication and sacrifice have been exalted, together with
 self-reliance, as the key to material advance.  The successes
 attained at Ta-chai have been propagandized throughout rural
 China (and groups from all parts of the country as well as
 foreign visitors have visited this Maoist model) in an effort
 to persuade the individual that handicaps and difficulties
 can he overcome without waiting for the distant promise of
 technology to modernize agriculture (Figure 7).  The "war"
 against the "ene:y," nature, also further emphasizes in
 Chinese minds the revolutionary nature of the struggle and
 the break against the old ways of the past with their passive
 acceptance of the environmental status quo.
 46.  Not all that has been done at Ta-chai seems worthy
 of emulation.  The dam from whose reservoir Ta-chai draws
 its water -- conveyed in a spectacular rock-lined aqueduct --
 has no spilltwray; a period of extensive rain could lead to its
 destruction.  Local officials recently admitted too that the
 reservoir will be filled with silt in a dozen years if erosion
 continues at its present rate.  This official comment from a
 model area urn''e-rscores both the problem and the difficulty of
 successfully applying known remedies.

 47.  It is not possible to measure accurately how
 successful the PRC has been in harnessing its environmental
 assets and lessening damage to them.  The objective has been
 to improve the physical base upon which agriculture rests.
 Food output, except in the disaster years of 1959-51, has
 kept pace wi th .population growth; and in the 1965-71 period
 grain production increased at a somewhat faster rate.  Many
 factors are responsible for increasing agricultural produc-
 tion, but certainly the environment-related measures of the
 past two decades have reversed the trend of environmental
 degradation and helped avert calamities of flood and drought.
 48.  The press in early 1973 reported renewed efforts
 to overcoite natural calamities, as the PRC was forced to
 increase grain and cotton imports and to intensify efforts
 to conserve food.  Chou Fn-lai, interviewed in December 1972,
 blamed last year's grain shortfall on drought and flood
 though, he added, other reasons exist related to the dif-
 ficulty of implementing "plans in practice" and the need
 to cor, ect ri thods.  Nature still remains a critical element,
 however, in the Chinese economy.  "ran can master nature,"
 stated a recent editorial in People's Daily, and good harvests
 are possible if "full preparations as regards morale, measures,
 and material" have been made.

 THE TRANSFORMATION OF NATURE IN CHINA
 Agriculture is a critical element in China's present
 and future.  A key question -- and problem -- is the
 ability of the People's Republic of China (PRC) to in-
 crease agricultural output sufficiently to keep pace with
 the annual rate of population increase.  The answer is
 complex, but an important factor is China's progress in
 the protection, improvement, and management of its land
 resources.  Maximum benefits must be realized from
 increased use of chemical fertilizers, larger supplies
 and improved distribution of water for irrigation, new
 crop varieties, and other technological advances.  Although
 the PRC's land area of 3.7 million square miles is exceeded
 only by the USSR and Canada, its agricultural land resources
 are subject to major limitations.  Specifically:
 The amount of cultivated land is virtually
 static; a number of reasons, mostly physical,
 suggest that this will continue to be true for
 the foreseeable future.
 Much land now cultivated is of average to
 low productivity.

 Climatic conditions, particularly in North
 China, are highly variable, specifically in the
 amount, distribution, and intensity of rainfall,
 with resultant serious effects upon agricultural
 output.
 A sizable proportion of the land now tilled
 is subject to yearly damage from drought, flooding,
 erosion, and waterlogging.
 Environmental improvements were implicit in the major
 river basin and other water conservancy programs begun in
 the early years of PRC rule.  Additionally, China's rural
 labor was mobilized periodically to engage in local compaigns
 of ditch digging, tree planting, and a host of other activities
 designed to improve agricultural conditions through the up-
 grading of environmental resources.                                Peking characterized
 these menial tasks as an opportunity to "remake nature" and
 to put an end to natural calamities.  Nature, or the
 physical environment, was labeled an "enemy" that caused
 drought, floods, privation, and famine.
 Mastery of nature has not been an easy task, even to
 those inspired and guided by Mao Thought,  Recent visitors
 to China, however, returning after more than 20 years, have
 been highly impressed by the altered appearance of the
 countryside and have commented on the presence of trees and
 shrubs on previously barren hillsides and extensive tree
 plantings in cities -- the results of China's "greening"
 campaign.  Other observers have remarked about the greatly
 increased water storage facilities and the expansion of
 irrigated land.
 The progress of environmental programs and their effect
 upon agricultural production are speculative and based in
 part on indirect evidence.  The record is not complete but
 at this time would include the following:
 Enough environmental improvements have been
 made to lessen the impact from either prolonged
 rainfall or lengthy dry periods.

 Water impoundments, canals, and related
 water control and storage facilities have been
 built by the millions, though most are small
 and many inadequate for intended needs.
 The Huang Ho (Yellow River) project, the
 most widely publicized and largest in scope of
 the river basin projects, has been scaled back
 drastically and altered -- principally because
 of the lack of effective anti-erosion work.
 Some improvements in the Huai and Hai basins
 apparently have been made; serious flooding is
 less likely and damage from waterlogging probably
 reduced.
 Millions of young saplings have been planted,
 but results in terms of original goals have been
 a patchwork of success and failure.
 The PRC has not claimed complete victory in its battles
 with nature, but some improvements in the overall picture
 are undeniable.  That more has not been accomplished and
 initial goals have not been reached is due not to a lack of
 incentive or official dedication to the tasks at hand, but
 rather to the reliance upon mass labor, lack of technically
 trained personnel, failure to coordinate related projects,
 overall managerial weaknesses, and the immensity of the
 problem.

 1.  The amount of cultivated land in China is
 relatively small -- approximately 11 percent of the
 total area -- and no sizable tracts of good agricultural
 land remain unused.  The physical constraints that account
 for this situation can be summarized simply but aptly:
 most of China is too steep, too high, too cold, or too
 dry to support intensive, Chinese-style agriculture.
 2.  Hills, mountains, and high plateaus comprise
 more than two-thirds of the Chinese landscape -- land-
 forms ill-suited to intensive, Chinese agricultural
 practices (Map A).

 Much of China is at comparatively high elevations: about
 one-third of the land is above 6,600 feet and two-thirds
 exceeds 3,300 feet.  The lower summer temperatures,
 shortened growing season, and steep slopes usually found
 at these higher elevations combine to preclude much agri-
 culture (Map B).  Nevertheless, the pressure for additional
 agricultural land has been so severe in China that sizable
 upland areas have been painstakingly and laboriously
 terraced to obtain additional fragments of agricultural
 land.
 3.  Nearly half of China receives so little rainfall
 (15 inches or less annually) that crops cannot be grown

 unless under full irrigation (Map C).  Areas of deficient
 precipitation include almost all of western and northwest-
 ern China, but they contain overall only about 4 percent
 of China's total cultivated acreage.  Although additional
 supplies of underground water probably can be tapped, no
 major areas of cultivated land are foreseen being developed
 there.
 4.  Of greater agricultural importance is the seasonal
 amount, variability, and intensity of rainfall in the major
 grain producing provinces.  In North and Northeast China,
 where annual precipitation averages only 25 inches (about
 the same as central Kansas), 60 to 75 percent of this total

 is concentrated in only 3 summer months.*  This concentration
 in so short a period poses an annual threat that meager spring
 and early summer rains will stunt the growth of spring-sown
 crops or that too much summer rain in too short a period will
 damage crops by local flooding and erosion.
 5.  The variability of rainfall also is a crucial factor
 in the major grain growing areas (Map D).  The most serious
 In Kansas only about half the yearly rainfall is recorded
 during the May through August period; furthermore, average
 daily rainfall intensity in July is Zess'than half of the

 conditions exist in North China, where annual variability
 (departure from normal rainfall) ranges from 20 to 30 per-
 cent -- in agricultural terms a high figure because crop
 yields are considered unstable when departures from normal

 immense in North China:  K'ai-feng has received as much as
 19.5 inches of rain in July and as little as 1.6 inches,
 and at Tientsin the range is from 15 inches to 1.6 inches.
 Finally, how much rainfall occurs during any one "rain" is
 another significant indicator of agricultural stability;
 here again, North China is frequently subject to brief
 gully-washing rains that cause flooding and erosion and
 damage water control works.  Many of the weather stations
 in North China, for example, have recorded as much as 9 to
 10 inches of rain during a single 24-hour period.*
 6.  Not only is most of China's land poorly suited
 for agriculture because of terrain and climatic factors,
 but even the presently cultivated area possesses inherent
 physical liabilities.  Only an estimated 31 percent of
 China's cultivated land is classified by PRC officials as
 "fertile," and of the remainder, 40 percent is "ordinary"
 and 29 percent "low-yielding."  Although the precise
 meaning of these terms is unclear, they at least suggest
 the shortage of good land and the predominance of ordinary
 and relatively poor agricultural land.  The Chinese also
 have been explicit in stating that sizable percentages of
 their cropped land are subject to a variety of environmental
 hazards, all of which threaten yearly crop output and over-
 all economic stability.  Again, evaluation of these assertions
 is difficult, but they do emphasize the necessity for the
 careful management and control of China's physical resources.

 7.  Harmony between man and nature was a basic
 philosophy of ancient China, originating in Chinese
 folklore with elaborations from those philosophical-
 ethical precepts of Taoism and Buddhism that were
 assimilated into Chinese culture.  Practical observations
 of what happened when man tampered with his environment
 undoubtedly helped strengthen these philosophical under-
 pinnings, as suggested by the following memorial of
 Ch'eng Hao to Emperor Shen-tsung, ca. A.D. 1075, which
 stated:
 It is not merely that the nature
 of things has been violated, but
 that the mountains from which
 forests and woods grow have all
 been laid bare by indiscriminate
 cutting and burning.  As these
 depredations still go uncurbed,
 the fish of the stream and the
 beasts of the field are cut
 short in their abundance and
 the things of nature are be-
 coming wasted and exhausted.
 What can be done about it?
 8.  The belief that China had achieved a harmonious
 relationship with the earth reinforced the belief of 18th
 century Western humanists in the superiority of Oriental
 culture in general and Chinese culture specifically.
 Chinese philosophical views toward nature were contrasted
 to those of Western man, conditioned by his Judeo-Christian
 heritage: man is created in God's image, he has been given
 dominion over the earth, and he shall subdue nature so that
 progress will continue and a better tomorrow be realized.
 9.  In spite of official injunctions against actions
 "contrary to nature," the Chinese in the course of more
 than three millennia of intensive occupance of their land
 probably altered their environment to a greater extent than
 has any other civilization.  This record is impressive
 whether measured by the changed appearance of the Chinese

 landscape or by the immense physical labor involved and
 the massive amounts of earth materials removed and re-
 shaped.  The North China Plain, for example, has been
 under intensive cultivation for so long that its "natural"
 vegetation still is a subject of scholarly debate.  Some
 2,000 years ago almost all of the lower Yangtze Valley
 was choked with thick forests and extensive swamps; several
 centuries of clearing and drainage work were necessary
 before the regulated, almost geometrical landscape of
 the present day emerged.  Although continued tillage and
 expansion of cultivated land produced an often dramatic
 physical modification, the process itself was viewed as
 part of a never-ending cycle of life.  The constant working
 and reworking of the soil, with continual return to the
 earth of its products in the form of compost and fertilizer,
 renewed the soil's ability to produce again sustenance for
 mankind.
 10.  Man thus was a much more active participant in
 altering the physical landscape of China than Western
 humanists realized.  The Chinese recognized that environ-
 mental mastery was not only a legacy of their legendary
 founders but also a necessity.  The manipulation and
 management of the environment were viewed, however, not as
 subjugation of nature but rather as cooperation with and
 adjustment to natural conditions.
 11.  A significant change in man-land relationships
 became apparent by the mid-19th century.  The physical
 resources upon which agriculture depended had been stretched
 to the breaking point, and, increasingly, erosion and
 flooding damaged cropland, famine became more common, and
 the general standard of living of the peasantry declined
 markedly.*  Much of this breakdown can be traced directly
 or indirectly to the rapid increase in population that had
 taken place since the beginning of the 18th century --
 from about 150 million to perhaps 430 million by 1850.
 Other factors such as bureaucratic corruption and
 inefficiency, military ineffectiveness, the impact of
 the Western nations, and fiscal problems also p Zayed
 important roles.

 Although increased agricultural productivity was recorded
 during this time span, much new land was required to pro-
 vide sufficient food for the rapidly growing population.
 Most of this new land was in South China, where settlers
 cleared forested uplands and planted mountain fields of
 corn and sweet potatoes.*  But careless tilling of the
 uplands speeded erosion, which in turn led to more frequent
 and serious flooding in the valleys and plains, as indicated
 by a contemporary 19th century source:
 Formerly the bed of the Hsiang River
 [a tributary of the Han River located
 in southwestern Honan and northern
 Hupeh] was several tens of feet deep.
 Ever since the systematic deforesta-
 tion consequent upon maize growing,
 the topsoil has been washed down by
 torrential rains          The further
 upstream one goes, the shallower the
 river bed becomes.  Small wonder that
 from 1821 to the present [ca.1838]
 there has hardly been a year in which
 the Hsiang River did not flood.
 12.   Pessimism permeated the reports of both Western
 and Chinese earth scientists who in the 1912-1949 period
 investigated the status of China's physical resources and
 problems.  The more striking and serious problems were in
 North China.  Although locally some progress had been made
 to combat erosion through contour plowing of slope lands
 and the construction of terraces, erosion was so widespread
 and so little ground cover remained that improvement seemed
 Corn and sweet potatoes, crops native to the Americas,
 were introduced into China in the Zate Z6th century.  They
 soon were well established in the Chinese agricultural
 system because of their high yields and adaptability to
 environmental conditions unsuited to rice, wheat, and other
 traditional staples.

 impossible without major capital-intensive projects under
 government auspices.  In contrast, management of land re-
 sources in the lowlands of South China was more successful
 principally because rice -- the dominant crop -- required
 the leveling and diking of small parcels of land and a
 carefully regulated flow of water into the fields (Figure 1).
 Consequently, irrigated rice farming produced an agricultural
 system that maximized the use of available land resources
 and minimized damage to them.  Reckless use of nearby upland
 fields continued, however, and erosion often was so rapid
 that some land had to be abandoned because of exhausted soil
 fertility after no more than two or three seasons of culti-
 vation.  By the end of Manchu rule in 1911 and the opening
 of China to wide-scale modernization, damage to.the
 environment had so worsened that traditional methods of
 combating these problems no longer were effective.  The
 lack of technical knowledge of how best to combat environ-
 mental difficulties remained a serious drawback, and the
 lack of a truly effective national government prevented
 the introduction of enough technical advisors and sufficient
 capital to initiate large-scale land and water conservancy
 programs.

 of environment-related tasks.  Recently, the "changing
 nature" theme has reappeared in the Chinese press, which
 features articles centered around Mao's instructions, in-
 dicating progress made and work currently underway.
 14.  The view of nature as an "enemy" and the
 glorification of man as an instrument of change contrasts
 with traditional Chinese views of adjustment to and
 harmony with nature.  The aggressive tone of the PRC
 leaders' rhetoric is in keeping with Marxist-Maoist views
 that conflict, contradiction, and the struggle are the
 proper condition of society and, indeed, its most im-
 portant dynamic.  The emphasis in Chinese treatment of
 its environmental problems has been on what man can do,
 under the guidance of the Party, to initiate change and
 bring about improvement.
 15.  Major Chinese efforts have focused on water
 conservancy and protective afforestation, including both
 large-scale state-directed and -financed projects and a
 host of local works involving little investment but
 massive amounts of rural labor.  During the early years
 of economic rehabilitation (1949-52), emphasis was on
 repair of dikes, irrigation canals, locks, and similar
 facilities.  Additionally, work commenced almost im-
 mediately on two major flood control projects, the Huai
 River and the Ching -- the latter name applied to that
 portion of the middle Yangtze River down to southern
 Hupeh.*  Later, when the First Five-Year Plan (1953-57)
 was announced, a modest amount of state investment was
 allocated to initiate major, long-term programs designed
 to control the perennially unruly rivers of North China the Huang, the Huai, and the Hai (Map F).
 The Ching project involved the construction of dikes
 and sluice gates to provide a flood retention basin for
 the Yangtze south of Sha-shih.

 16.  More specific plans relating to protection and
 improvement of the physical environment were incorporated
 in the Twelve-Year Plan (1956-67) of the National Agri-
 cultural Development Program, adopted in 1958.  These
 included such basics as increased development of water
 conservancy works, irrigation, and flood and drought
 control projects, with emphasis upon small and medium-
 sized projects, soil improvement, extension of soil and
 water conservation practices, promotion of afforestation,
 and expansion of the network of meteorological and
 hydrological stations.  Use of the commune and its
 organizational structure to mobilize the rural masses
 was the principal means specified to implement the
 objectives of the Plan.
 17.  Planning and work on some early projects was
 hampered by an inadequate data base and the lack of

 specific problems.  Priority was given to studies of the
 loess areas of the middle Huang Ho (Yellow River) basin
 and the extensive arid areas of western China.  By the
 late 1950's the results of some of these efforts were
 beginning to be published in the form of major monographs
 and articles in technical and professional journals.
 More specific technical material undoubtedly was forwarded
 to appropriate ministries in Peking for use in particular
 projects.
 Controlling the Huang Ho
 If you wait till the Huang Ho is
 clear, how old will you be?
 --Chinese Proverb
 18.  Matteo Ricci, the pioneer Jesuit missionary
 to China in the late 16th century, remarked that:  "The
 Yellow River has no respect at all for Chinese law and
 order.  It comes from a barbarous region and     . fre-
 quently ravages whole districts of the realm, silting
 them up with sand, and changing its course at will."
 Though news to Europeans, Father Ricci's description and
 characterization of the river merely reiterated what the
 Chinese had known since earliest times:  control of the
 turbulent Huang Ho was the most persistent and serious
 environmental problem in all of China.
 19.  The PRC leadership placed a high priority on
 a plan to permanently control the Huang, eliminating its
 periodic floods and erratic changes in course and at the
 same time more fully utilizing the river both for power
 generation and as a source of irrigation water.  Ac-
 cordingly, in 1955 the "Report on the Multi-Purpose Plan
 for the Permanent Control of the Yellow River and
 Exploitation of Its Water Resources" was presented to the
 National People's Congress.  The plan, ambitious in concept
 and massive in scope, was based upon earlier studies and
 recommendations, plus post-1949 investigations.  It called

 for construction of a series of multi-purpose dams designed
 for flood control, power generation, irrigation, and navi-
 gation purposes. The most publicized project was the
 building of a giant hydroelectric dam at San-men (Three
 Gates), a point on the Huang upstream a few miles from
 where the river and its valley widen before emerging on
 the North China Plain (Map F).  Smaller dams were planned
 upstream from San-men, including two on the upper Huang
 near Lan-chou, plus a series of reservoirs on principal
 tributaries.  But the key to success was, in the words of
 the plan, the necessity ". . . to develop at the same time
 large-scale water and soil conservation works in Kansu,
 Shensi, and Shansi Provinces and other loess regions."
 Numerous soil and water conservancy targets were spelled
 out in the plan (Figure 2).
 20.  It probably was inevitable that the massive
 physical changes required to reduce soil erosion did not
 in fact occur to any significant degree, given the short
 time schedule for construction of the San-men project
 (1957-61), the immense size of the soil and water conser-
 vancy tasks (only 5 percent of the loess area was covered
 by trees), and the dizzying rural organizational changes
 of the period.  The San-men Dam was essentially completed
 in 1961 and a mammoth reservoir was to have been filled,
 taking several hundred thousand hectares of cropland out
 of production (Figure 3).  But it was soon discovered that
 the silt load of the river had not been measurably reduced:
 by 1963 the penstocks were clogged with mud.  Since then
 the gates have remained open and the Huang Ho continues as
 before -- transporting its heavy burden of silt seaward.
 21.  Mention of the Huang Ho project, and particularly
 of San-men Dam, virtually ceased in the PRC press after 1961.
 In late 1963 and continuing until the advent of the Cultural
 Revolution in 1966, an occasional article appeared on proper
 techniques to reduce erosion and soil and water losses in
 the middle Huang Valley.  Only recently have press items
 reappeared commenting on the overall problem of the Huang.
 Progress is related in general terms, usually tied to one
 or more of Chairman Mao's statements, but specific references
 are to small-scale local achievements rather than a review of
 accomplishments throughout the Huang Ho basin.  No mention,
 for example, is made of the 1955 plan nor of the great mass
 of concrete at San-men.

 22.  It is clear that Chinese planners grievously
 underestimated the importance of systematic, long term
 soil and water conservancy work in the loess-mantled
 middle reaches (Shensi, Shansi, and eastern Kansu) of the
 Huang, origin of almost nine-tenths of the sediment load
 of the river.  Press reports of 1963 and later clearly
 indicated that diverse physical factors present in the
 middle Huang Valley had not been taken into account.  A
 December 1963 People's Daily article stated that hence-
 forth "geographical considerations based on actual practice"
 would be the criteria to be followed in future local land
 and water conservancy projects.  Earlier, for example,
 projects suitable for a particular physical environment had
 been imposed on other areas with differing physical
 conditions -- with predictable results.  In the future,
 according to the article,      . preventive measures [soil
 and water conservancy projects] should be geared exactly to
 the problems as they exist."

 23.  Two other problem rivers, the Huai and Hai,
 received early attention from PRC leaders.  Both river
 basins suffered from excessive loads of silt and from
 their inability to discharge through their silt-clogged
 channels a sufficient volume of water to prevent flooding
 during periods of heavy rains.  Although flood prevention
 was the most immediate problem, other objectives included
 water for irrigation and the generation of electricity.
 24.  Early work on the Huai consisted principally of
 repair and rehabilitation of existing facilities.  Because
 considerable engineering data were available from pre-1949
 studies on control of the Huai, the PRC was able to shift
 quickly into a comprehensive program involving the building
 of new outlets, straightening river courses, and the con-
 struction of reservoirs.  The pace, direction, and emphasis

 of the plans, however, frequently changed.  Announced
 successes were often followed by later admissions of
 failure.  Familiar problems arose -- uncoordinated efforts,
 incompetent planning, hasty work, poor maintenance of com-
 pleted works, and failure to complete basic erosion control
 in headwater areas.
 25.       By late 1972 a Chinese article proclaimed that
 the basin " . . . had been transformed."*  The construction
 work of over two decades certainly has superficially trans-
 formed the Huai basin landscape with new reservoirs, new
 river channels and outlets, and a host of lesser works
 completed.  Whether the transformation has completely
 eliminated the chronic problems of the Huai awaits the test
 of prolonged heavy rains and lengthy dry spells before a
 final verdict can be reached (Figure 4).
 26.  The Hai River, a short but important stream in
 the northern portion of the North China Plain, serves as
 the outlet for five major streams that wind across the
 northern Plain and which unite just west of Tientsin.  This
 portion of the Plain long has been subject to serious
 flooding and its agricultural potential limited by consider-
 able amounts of waterlogged and alkalinized or salinized
 land.  Although some flood control projects were completed
 during the 1954-1960 period, very serious flooding in 1963,
 when all five rivers overflowed, prompted a decree from
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung that "The Hai Ho must be brought under
 permanent control."  (See Chronology of Water Control
 Projects and Problems . . . following text.)
 27.  A variety of projects were subsequently under-
 taken, including major drainage projects that have involved
 the digging of new channels and providing new outlets.
 Nevertheless, an April 2973 broadcast from An1v ei told
 of the "first stage" of a Huai project calling for a
 123-km canal and the construction of bridges, regulators,
 and navigation locks to relieve some 400,000 hectares of
 cultivated land from the threat of flooding.

 Progress also has been made in relieving waterlogging and
 saline conditions, thus improving existing cultivated land
 and reclaiming additional land.  The area of alkaline land,
 according to recent reports, has been reduced by half.
 Overall, the amount of work done in the Hai basin is
 impressive (Map G).
 28.  Although the probability of serious flooding in
 the Hai basin certainly  has been greatly reduced, the long
 term success of the present programs will depend upon
 efficient management of the newly created control and
 drainage systems.  Dikes must be inspected and strengthened,
 protective vegetation on the dikes maintained, water seepage
 from streams to areas of sandy soil controlled, dredging
 continued, and pumps continually maintained and repaired.
 Improved crop yields can be expected over the next few years
 from land that previously had been waterlogged, although
 salinized soil must be leached for years before it becomes
 fully productive.  Some successes have been achieved in
 reducing the area of alkaline land, but the complicated
 network of new channels must be operatively synchronized
 to prevent the development of additional problems of water-
 logging and salinization following periods of above-normal
 rainfall.

 29.  No aspect of present-day China has impressed
 returnees to the Mainland more than the extensive planting
 of trees on previously barren hillsides, along major roads,
 and in the cities.  Visible contrasts between pre-1949
 conditions and the present are great (Map H).  How much
 has actually been accomplished is difficult to determine,
 even though abundant statistics have been released on land
 afforested -- particularly during the first decade of PRC
 rule.  It is clear that the yearly figures have contained

 some duplication, including sizable areas where replanting
 of afforested land previously had been reported as completed.
 In addition, the trees in many areas reported as afforested
 have had low survival rates, and the condition of the land
 is not now markedly different than before.  Still unreached
 is the goal, originally targeted for 1967, of increasing
 China's forested area from the 1957 base figure of 8 percent
 to 19 percent of the total land area.
 30.  Afforestation projects serve several PRC objectives.
 A major goal has been to ease a serious national timber shortage
 and to redress the regional imbalance of wood resources.*
 Equally important is the coordination of protective afforesta-
 tion plans with water and soil conservancy work -- erosion
 control, stabilization of sandy areas (particularly where
 they threaten cultivated or cultivable land), and related
 shelter belt plantings (Figure 5).  The PRC also has stressed
 extensive roadside. plantings and the planting of trees and
 shrubs in industrial and housing areas -- a program that has
 been highly successful.
 31.  A widely publicized program begun during the late
 1950's was the "great green wall," a series of protective
 vegetative buffers designed to ward off the blowing sands of
 the Inner Mongolian deserts.  Although Chinese sources were
 vague concerning precise locational details, the "wall,"
 consisting of a series of shelter-belt systems, was planned
 to extend from the Greater Khinghan Mountains in Northeast
 China to northwestern Kansu Province.
 32.  Recent Chinese commentary has avoided discussion
 of "green walls," and articles on shelter belts have been
 confined to those in a few specific areas.  The most ex-
 tensive plantings reported and confirmed occur in the
 Wu-wei -- Min-chin area, in the Kansu Corridor, some 250
 kilometers north of Lan-chou.  Here plantings of several
 rows of trees to widths of about 100 meters occur in places;
 As of 2963 approximately Z0 percent of China was forested,
 of which about 60 percent was Located in Northeast China.

 more common are irregular plots of trees, a situation most
 likely caused by planning and planting at different times
 by separate groups.  Single rows of trees usually line
 roads, irrigation canals, and dry stream channels.  In other
 areas occasional plantings have been started, but evidence
 is lacking elsewhere in the Kansu Corridor of large-scale
 shelter belts commensurate with the publicity over the
 "green wall."
 33.  The gap between plans and accomplishments has been
 caused by a combination of physical, political, and economic
 factors. Much of the area to be afforested consists of poor
 land deficient in soil nutrients.  Careful preparation of
 sites and use of fertilizers is required to insure a high
 survival rate.  The prolonged periods of dry weather that
 characterize the northern half of China pose additional sur-
 vival problems.  Qualified observers also have commented
 that in some cases species that are unsuited to the
 particular environment have been planted, with a consequent
 low survival rate.
 34.  Another key obstacle to a successful afforestation
 program has been the lack of trained personnel to oversee the
 managerial and technical aspects of the programs and the
 widespread use of rural and untrained labor to undertake the
 actual planting.  Commonly, afforestation drives are mounted
 in late winter and early spring under the direction of local
 rural administrative units that mobilize hundreds or even
 thousands of laborers to plant young saplings.  A New Zealand
 forester, S.D. Richardson, commented after train travel in
 China in 1963 that very dissimilar wooded plots could be
 found adjoining one another.  The explanation was that dif-
 ferent production teams were involved in planting and
 maintenance, and that the care and knowledge of those in
 charge of the tree planting was the major factor relating
 to success or failure.  In some areas, Richardson speculated,
 poor tree survival might be related to the inadequate supply
 of fuel and to regulations that permit individuals to harvest
 dead trees for local use.  This suggested, commented Richardson
 "a vested interest in early mortality."
 35.  A 1963 editorial in People's Dai y stated the
 need to change the idea that trees, once planted, will grow
 naturally without anything further being done.  The editorial

 also stressed the need for idealogical and educational
 work so that individuals understand " . . . the important
 relationships of forests with state construction and
 people's livelihood."  Some progress is suggested by a
 1972 report from Kiangsu that praised the cadres and
 masses in a certain locality for "heightening their con-
 sciousness of the struggle" so that "better results" in
 afforestation had been achieved compared to past years.
 The key word is "better"; quite likely, work in early years
 was done poorly and extensive replanting was necessary.
 Better management and education continue to be highlighted
 in press reports (Figure 6).  A 1972 report from Anhwei
 comments that "the importance of developing forestry is
 not fully appreciated .   . [and] . . . they [referring
 to people in "some localities"] have no time to attend to
 forestry because their grain production is not yet up to
 the quota."  The final paragraph of the article stressed
 anew the key point of management:
 One of the present important tasks
 in afforestation is to strengthen
 forestry management.  In some lo-
 calities there is still a serious
 tendency to stress planting and
 neglect management.  Therefore all
 localities must combine the mass
 afforestation movement, as a crash
 program, with constant management
 and protection.  They must at the
 same time carefully train and de-
 velop a contingent of professional
 workers for afforestation, and set
 up and perfect the system for forest
 protection along with its required
 rules and regulations.  They must
 pay equal attention to planting and
 managing so as to raise the quality
 of afforestation and consolidate
 its gains.

 Nature in Transformation:  Progress and Prospects
 To transform nature we must rely
 on ourselves...
 --China Reconstructs
 37.  According to a recent article in China
 Reconstructs, ". . . nature in old China became more
 unkind with each year," but in recent times the
 "              picture has changed greatly."  Although visible
 changes in the landscape and environmental modifications
 have occurred since 1949, questions arise as to the
 quantitative and qualitative aspects of the changes:
 How much change actually has taken place?
 How has change been effected?
 How successful have these changes been
 in the context of PRC goals?
 38.  Victory has not been claimed by the PRC in its
 battles with nature.  Reports of environmental damage
 caused by flooding, waterlogged soils, and excessive
 erosion still continue in the press.  For example, grain
 output in the PRC is estimated to have declined by about

 of the total-area of the hsien.

 10 million tons in 1972 (a drop of about 4 percent), and
 the blame for the shortfall has been attributed primarily
 to drought, floods, and other environmental conditions.
 Almost certainly, however, recent crop losses would have
 been greater had it not been for the two decades of effort
 to control floods, extend irrigation, and lessen erosion.
 39.  Water conservancy programs have played a key role
 in PRC planning toward control and modification of the en-
 vironment.  Early and ambitious projects to control the
 major rivers of North China produced mixed results.  Initial
 objectives were not achieved because of lack of planning and
 coordination, high costs, and limited technical resources.
 A major problem was a lack of appreciation by PRC planners
 of the importance, massive scope, and complexity of the soil
 conservation and afforestation work required -- particularly
 that needed in the Huang Ho basin (Map I).
 40.  Publicity on the Huang Ho project recently has
 resumed to the effect that flooding is basically under
 control, though use of the word "basically" strongly im-
 plies that some but not all required work is done.  In a
 word, flooding now is less likely -- but it still could
 occur.  This likelihood is given added emphasis by the
 recent admission that insufficient attention has been paid
 to silting and that only now is an active study of that
 problem being carried out.  The dimensions of the task
 confronting the Chinese leadership in the Huang Ho basin
 are best reflected in a 1971 article in China Reconstructs:
 The success in harnessing the Yellow
 River over the past 20 years or so is
 only the first step in a long, long
 march.  Advancing along Chairman Mao's
 proletarian revolutionary line, the
 people living in the Yellow River
 valley are continuing their efforts
 to harness it further. (Emphasis added.)
 More evidence of the scope of "continuing efforts" is re-
 ported in a 1972 radio broadcast from Shensi Providence
 that in 20 years of work only 20 percent of the Huang Ho
 basin [in Shensi] had benefited from soil erosion measures.

 41.  China's rural landscape has been altered markedly
 by the construction of vast numbers of water impoundments
 ranging in size from small ponds to a few large reservoirs.*
 A visual impression of the increase in size and number of
 these ponds and reservoirs, based upon a comparison of maps
 compiled prior to 1949 and after 1965, is shown on Map J.**
 Most of these areas had few if any significant water storage
 facilities prior to 1949.  However, an. impoundment, though
 it has some intrinsic value in regulating waterflow, does
 not guarantee use of water in adjacent agricultural lands.
 Many of the smaller storage facilities lack sufficient
 capacity to be of use during dry spells when irrigation
 needs are greatest.  Other facilities are of limited use
 because of the lack of pumping equipment and distribution
 systems or both.
 42.  Water conservancy projects have enabled the PRC
 to increase the amount of irrigated land substantially over
 pre-1949 levels and, in recent years, to embark upon a
 rapid enlargement of high-yield farmland -- land under con-
 trolled irrigation and drainage and capable of producing
 a crop in spite of either drought or floods.***  Water
 * In the Z949-59 decade, some 29 million projects reportedly
 were completed including 56 large reservoirs, about Z9 million
 small and radium-sized projects other than wells, and about
 ZO million wells.  The small size of the vast majority of
 these is indicated by the statistic that on the average each
 could irrigate slightly less than 2 hectares of farmland.
 *  Only those impoundments that back up at least one-half mile
 or more of water are shown because of the scale limitations of
 the source map used.  For this reason the more numerous small
 reservoirs and farm ponds that range downward to only a few
 acres in extent are not depicted.

 conservancy gains have been made at a cost -- staggering
 use of labor; profligate construction of impoundments,
 canals, and other projects; and frequent ignorance or
 disregard for basic physical conditions, needs, and the
 interrelationship of projects. These shortcomings have
 plagued water conservancy programs from the very beginning
 and continue today.  A commentary in the Peo le's Dail  of
 23 March 1973 summarized the current situation as fo lows:
 In evaluating the achievements of water
 conservation projects, we do not merely
 count their number but consider their
 role in increasing agricultural production.
 Constructing water conservation projects
 only to meet state targets in disregard
 of efficiency; thinking that these projects
 once built, will naturally play their
 proper role; and only knowing how to open
 sluice gates to discharge water without
 paying attention to the output of agri-
 cultural products -- are all erroneous
 ideas and work styles.
 The key to success is thus in management and. technical
 knowledge.  But as before, as acknowledged in People's
 Daily, reliance is placed upon ". . . the broa  masses of
 commune and brigade members to properly manage water con-
 servancy projects [and] do a good job in maintaining them."
 43.  Progress has been made in increasing the amount
 of land covered by forests and other types of vegetation
 that will slow erosion.  Although reliable data on the
 extent of progress are lacking, undoubtedly more of China
 is now "green" than has been the case for many decades if
 not longer.      Crude comparisions for one area of North China
 using maps of identical scale but compiled from pre-1949 and
 post-1965 data provide rough indications of gains made (Map H).
 Familiar problems affect the PRC's afforestation schemes:
 proper management and technical knowledge are often limited
 or lacking; investment in fertilizers and pesticides usually
 is inadequate; reliance upon annual mass labor drives to
 reach targets results in a patchwork approach to a problem

 where coordinated efforts are needed; and the result all
 too frequently is a low survival rate of the saplings and
 the consequent necessity for the work to be redone.
 44.  Programs to protect and improve China's physical
 environment have involved both major capital-intensive
 projects and local projects using China's vast, untrained
 pool of rural labor to dig, build, and plant -- making use
 of local resources, simple tools, and strong backs.  Early
 environment-related programs stressed the major projects,
 such as the comprehensive plan for development of the
 Huang Ho.  Later, Chinese planners began to place greater
 emphasis upon small-scale projects in which little invest-
 ment other than manpower would be required.  During the
 past decade emphasis increasingly has been on Maoist views
 that individual motivation and social organization are the
 keys to environmental improvement.
 45.  The most widely publicized example of this approach
 has been at Ta-chai, the model brigade tucked away in a loess-
 covered and mountain-rimmed pocket of central Shansi, which
 long has played the role of exemplar for rural China (Map F).
 Dedication and sacrifice have been exalted, together with
 self-reliance, as the key to material advance.  The successes
 attained at Ta-chai have been propagandized throughout rural
 China (and groups from all parts of the country as well as
 foreign visitors have visited this Maoist model) in an effort
 to persuade the individual that handicaps and difficulties
 can be overcome without waiting for the distant promise of
 technology to modernize agriculture (Figure 7).  The "war"
 against the "enemy," nature, also further emphasizes in
 Chinese minds the revolutionary nature of the struggle and
 the break against the old ways of the past with their passive
 acceptance of the environmental status quo.
 46.  Not all that has been done at Ta-chai seems worthy
 of emulation.  The dam from whose reservoir Ta-chai draws
 its water -- conveyed in a spectacular rock-lined aqueduct --
 has no spillway; a period of extensive rain could lead to its
 destruction.  Local officials recently admitted too that the
 reservoir will be filled with silt in a dozen years if erosion
 continues at its present rate.  This official comment from a
 model area underscores both the problem and the difficulty of
 successfully applying known remedies.

 47.  It is not possible to measure accurately how
 successful the PRC has been in harnessing its environmental
 assets and lessening damage to them.  The objective has been
 to improve the physical-base upon which agriculture rests.
 Food output, except in the disaster years of 1959-61, has
 kept pace with population growth; and in the 1965-71 period
 grain production increased at a somewhat faster rate.  Many
 factors are responsible for increasing agricultural produc-
 tion, but certainly the environment-related measures of the
 past two decades have reversed the trend of environmental
 degradation and helped avert calamities of flood and drought.
 48.  The press in early 1973 reported renewed efforts
 to overcome natural calamities, as the PRC was forced to
 increase grain and cotton imports and to intensify efforts
 to conserve food.  Chou En-lai, interviewed in December 1972,
 blamed last year's grain shortfall on drought and flood
 though, he added, other reasons exist related to the dif-
 ficulty of implementing "plans in practice" and the need
 to correct methods.  Nature still remains a critical element,
 however, in the Chinese economy.  "Man can master nature,"
 stated a recent editorial in People's Daily, and good harvests
 are possible if "full preparations as regards morale, measures,
 and material" have been made.
