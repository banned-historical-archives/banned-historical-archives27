 Brazil continues to face foreign exchange difficulties despite the conclusion of
 new loan agreements. The government is now making the adjustments
 required to retain crucial bank support, but, with the austerity program
 already drawing fire, it is likely to waver and fail to meet all IMF targets. 25X1
 Venezuela: Worsening Economic Outlook)                                25X1
 The government's unwillingness to adopt a strict adjustment program has left
 international bankers reluctant to cooperate in refinancing Caracas's large
 external debt. To regain banker support, we believe that Venezuela will
 ultimately resort to the IMF this year. F__1

 The Socialist government has proposed a conservative economic program for

 The Philippines: Economic Decisionmaking
 The Philippines's economic decisionmaking system has been geared to striking
 a politically acceptable balance between the views of Western-educated
 technocrats, creditors such as the IMF and the World Bank, and influential
 domestic business interests. The balance currently favors the technocrats and
 creditors, chiefly because Marcos recognizes that the economy is in its worst
 shape in a decade.

 Perspective              South America: Managing Financial Crisis
 The payments problems besetting Brazil and Venezuela illustrate the continu-
 ing tensions that confront the international financial system. Brasilia faces
 difficulties in servicing its $85 billion foreign debt, despite the disbursement of
 new loans last month. Caracas has recently declared a postponement on
 maturing public-sector principal payments through the middle of the year
 because of the breakdown in its refinancing program.
 Brasilia's failure to adjust its economy after the successive oil shocks in the
 1970s is at the root of its problems. The government resorted to heavy foreign
 borrowing to sustain the growth perceived as necessary to prevent social
 unrest. By and large, the borrowing program was well managed and Brazil's
 debt servicing record is impressive. Easy access to foreign credit, however,
 undermined the incentives to take the tough, unpopular steps necessary to
 defeat triple-digit inflation, root out external imbalances, and sweep away the
 inefficiencies plaguing the economy.
 Caracas is now paying the price for blatantly poor economic management.
 This year, for example, it has been lax in meeting debt payments and has yet
 to define exchange controls announced in late February. These problems are
 symptomatic of persistent bumbling in development planning. Despite a large
 investment program facilitated by the oil bonanza, Caracas has been unable to
 diversify its economy. It also has failed to implement necessary economic
 reforms, devise an effective debt restructuring program, and provide incentives
 needed to develop a strong private business sector. We anticipate-based on
 solid evidence from international bankers-that the economic team will have
 difficulty pursuing needed stabilization measures.
 In these-as well as other South American countries-the major unknown
 remains how the IMF and commercial bankers will react to the failure of
 debtors to meet their stabilization targets. If creditors demonstrate reluctance
 to continue lending, the rescue programs will quickly unravel. Lacking reserve
 cushions and with exports still depressed, most debtors will have little choice
 but to move unilaterally to relieve financial strains. The pattern is already set:
 ? Chile suspended debt payments in early January after bankers cut credit.
 ? In early March Argentina announced a postponement in meeting some debt
 repayments, while Peru declared an extension of maturing short-term credits.
 ? Uruguay recently announced a 90-day delay in principal payments as a
 prelude to formal debt rescheduling.
 ? Brazil is now running commercial arrears because bankers remain reluctant
 to provide standby financial support.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/04: CIA-RDP84-00898R000200010006-8
 These events suggest that-at least implicitly-a "debtors' revolt" is already
 under way. South American countries have already rewritten most of the time-
 honored repayment rules by unilaterally suspending payments. Bankers will
 not be the only commercial parties affected. Major debtors, especially Brazil,
 also are pressing suppliers for more liberal terms. Moreover, they are looking
 to new barter trade deals and increased intraregional trade to ease their
 payments stringencies, mainly at the expense of developed country exporters.
 Under these conditions, we believe that Washington probably will be caught in
 the middle. Debtors probably will turn to the US Government for direct
 financial assistance, help in backing efforts to secure additional financing from
 banks, and new initiatives to reschedule official credits. They will also look to
 increase exports to the United States. Creditors, on the other hand, probably
 will insist that Washington press the debtors to sustain politically unpopular
 adjustment programs. They also probably will seek greater official assistance
 in meeting debtors' new money requests and will lobby for more expansionary
 policies in the developed world.

 OPEC Oil Production             OPEC's first-quarter crude oil production of 15.6 million b/d was off 22
 percent from year-earlier levels. March output of about 15 million b/d-
 essentially unchanged from February-reflected the continuing weak demand
 for OPEC oil. After a surge late in the month, Saudi production averaged
 about 3.3 million b/d; output early in March was below 3 million b/d. This in-
 crease probably represents delays by customers in purchasing crude until
 announcement of the OPEC price cut; the late-month increase in demand is
 unlikely to carry over into April.

 Buyer uncertainty also dropped Iranian production to 2.4 million b/d despite
 the cut in official prices to $28 per barrel for Iranian Light. Iranian production
 could go lower because the current price differential of only $1 per barrel
 between Tehran's crudes and Arab Light may not be sufficiently attractive to
 maintain sales. Nigeria increased its production to 900,000 b/d but continued
 to have difficulty selling oil as buyers waited for further price developments. If
 sales fail to pick up soon, high levels of oil in storage could begin to hamper
 Nigerian operations.
 Saudis Cut             Riyadh has cut in half the 50 cents per barrel transit fee it charges for Arab
 Pipeline Fees          Light crude oil delivered to the Red Sea via Petroline, its cross-country
 pipeline. The original fee has long been considered excessive, and most
 customers have refused to accept deliveries from the Red Sea port of Yanbu
 since early in the year. The United States Liaison Office in Riyadh estimates
 average throughput for the pipeline is currently about 300,000 b/d-one-sixth
 its capacity-forcing Petroline to cease operations recently for one- to two-
 week periods when the line's minimum flow rate of 450,000 b/d could not be
 sustained. The new 25 cents per barrel fee still may not be enough to generate
 increased Red Sea liftings, however, because the majority of Saudi crude oil
 now goes to the Far East. Stiff price competition from higher quality African
 and North Sea crudes have effectively pushed Saudi oil out of the European
 market.
 West German            West Germany has again delayed exercising its option as to its willingness to
 Decision on Soviet     purchase the maximum volume of Soviet gas that was provided for in contracts
 Gas Postponed          initialed in November 1981. Last year, natural gas consumption in West
 Germany declined by 7 percent, and Embassy commercial sources continue to
 believe there is no demand in West Germany for the full 10.5 billion cubic me-
 ters of gas originally under contract. Given the postponement, any further
 decision by the West Germans to exercise their option to reduce volumes by 20
 percent will now be delayed until October at the earliest. Because of declining
 oil prices and potentially higher economic growth, the West Germans are
 probably keeping this option open to determine the extent to which gas
 demand recovers. If pressed on the issue by the Soviets, however, the German
 purchasers are likely to immediately exercise their options to reduce the
 volumes taken on a permanent basis.

 Big Seven Electricity          Sluggish economic growth in the Big Seven was primarily responsible for an
 Consumption Falls              unprecedented 1.4-percent decline in total electricity consumption in 1982.
 Electricity use in the United States and the United Kingdom dropped by 2.7
 and 2.0 percent, respectively. Some modest economic growth in France and
 Japan led to a slight increase in electricity demand. Most industry analysts
 now expect electricity demand to return to previous growth rates as the
 economic recovery gains momentum.

 The Pingshuo coal mine will use large-scale extraction equipment imported
 from the United States and could produce 15 million tons of coal annually by
 1987 if construction begins next year. Two additional mines in the same field
 could eventually add another 20-25 million tons of coal, making the Pingshuo
 complex one of China's largets coal producers. China currently ranks third in
 the world in coal production, with an output last year of 650 million tons. F_
 Australian-Japanese    Because of declining projections of future gas demand, Japanese firms have
 LNG Project Delayed    decided to delay the $2.5 billion Northwest Shelf liquefied natural gas export
 project-the second delay in two years. Japanese projections of 1990 gas
 demand have fallen by 15 percent since 1980. Preliminary engineering work on
 the project, which was to have begun late last year, will probably not get under
 way until at least 198
 the plant will not be
 completed until 1990 at the earliest-three years later than the original
 completion date.
 The delay will cost Australia nearly $1.5 billion a year in export revenues at
 current world prices. It is unlikely, however, the project will be scrapped.
 France Relaxes         France has lifted a two-year-old policy that requires oil companies to maintain
 Inventory Requirements extra distillate and gasoline stocks above the compulsory 90-day level. The
 requirement was instituted in late 1980 in response to the outbreak of the Iran-
 Iraq war. According to a press report, the action was taken to reduce the
 French trade deficit. These extra stocks reportedly amount to less than 22
 million barrels. French oil import demand would be reduced by more than
 100,000 b/d if the excess is drawn down over a six-month period.

 Grain traders had anticipated that the Soviets would be buying to fulfill
 purchase commitments made earlier under various long-term grain agree-
 ments and to ensure steady deliveries this spring. As a result, the market has
 taken the reports in stride. If all reports are acccurate, the buying brings total
 Soviet grain purchases for the marketing year ending 30 June to 34-36 million
 tons. It now looks as though total purchases from the United States will be lit-
 tle more than the 6 million tons of grain stipulated under the US-USSR long-
 term grain agreement-far short of the 15.4 million tons purchased last year.
 Japanese Improving    The Japanese have told US officials that Tokyo is moving to improve
 COCOM Enforcement     enforcement of restrictions on exports of high technology to Communist
 countries. Special funds have been allocated to upgrade liaison among the
 ministries and government agencies charged with enforcing COCOM restric-
 tions and to retrain personnel directly involved. Tokyo plans to increase public
 awareness of the restrictions by publishing a handbook on arms control and
 COCOM lists. The Japanese also have indicated a willingness to discuss
 enforcement questions with the United States more often and to support a
 meeting this year of the COCOM Subcommittee on Export Controls. These
 moves are part of Tokyo's continuing efforts to satisfy US concerns about
 Japanese export control procedures. For the most part, they are in direct
 response to suggestions made by US official visitors. A stricter policy on
 entrance visas for visiting Soviet technical delegations is another example of
 Tokyo's growing sensitivity to US appeals.
 The extent to which these moves will stem the flow of strategic technology to
 the USSR and China is unclear. The Trade Ministry's apparent willingness to
 cooperate could improve Japanese performance. On the other hand, the
 Japanese have made no mention of expanding the role of the National Police.
 The National Police monitors the involvement of Soviet intelligence services in
 illegal trade and scientific and technical collection. It also is partly responsible
 for investigating trade violations.

 EC Steel Capacity      According to EC Industry Commissioner Davignon, the EC steel industry has
 Begins To Decline      cut its capacity by nearly 10 million tons since 1980, from around 203 to 193
 million tons. This is the industry's first significant retrenchment since the steel
 crisis began in 1975. It is also the first evidence that years of financial losses
 and EC Commission pressure on the steel companies to reduce their excess
 capacity may finally be having some effect. Meanwhile, the US steel industry
 is beginning to trim down, reducing capacity from 139 to 136 million tons last
 year.
 There is little doubt that the trend toward a smaller steel industry will
 continue. West Germany has announced a plan to cut about 14 million tons of
 capacity if the EC Commission will authorize a subsidy payment of about $1
 billion to its steel industry. After a survey of current planning by the major
 producers, a leading private steel analyst has predicted that the EC and US
 steel industries together will scrap 15 to 20 percent of their combined capacity
 by the mid-1980s. Despite this loss, however, capacity will remain well above
 the production levels that most analysts believe will be required even at the
 peak of the current economic recovery, and excess capacity probably will
 continue to burden the steel market throughout the 1980s.
 IMF Financing          A suspension of IMF lending to El Salvador over the remainder of this year
 for El Salvador        appears increasingly likely. According to Central Bank President Benitez, the
 in Peril                Salvadoran Government may be unwilling to effect IMF-prescribed austerity
 measures in return for the $35 million offered under standby loan arrange-
 ments.

 probably will balk at signing a new agreement with an outgoing government.
 National Developments
 Developed Countries
 South African Budget   The Government's FY 1983/84 budget, presented to Parliament last week by
 South African Finance Minister Horwood, projects a deficit of about $2 billion
 and conforms almost exactly to the guideline of 2 percent of GDP established
 by the IMF as a condition for balance-of-payments assistance last year.
 Overall spending is set to rise by more than 11 percent-slightly less than the
 12-percent rate of inflation projected by the goverment for this year-while
 revenues are to increase by nearly 10 percent.
 Keeping spending down to the budgeted level and controlling the deficit will be
 difficult. Severe drought probably will force Pretoria to import food, and it
 may become necessary to raise further the level of relief spending for farmers.
 Defense, which has received only a 7-percent increase, appears to be under-
 budgeted and-for the second year in a row-may require a supplemental

 appropriation to cover actual spending. Many prominent South African
 bankers believe that the government's revenue assumptions are overly optimis-
 tic, according to the US Embassy. Revenue will be reduced further when a
 5-percent surcharge on imports is eliminated by the end of the year to satisfy
 an IMF condition. Although Horwood probably used a conservative estimate
 of the price of gold in his revenue projections, gold's volatility will be a key fac-
 tor in determining the actual budget outcome.
 Less Developed Countries
 Serious Shortage       Growing import shortages are further slashing private-sector production. New
 of Imported Goods      official trade data indicate that merchandise imports plunged 73 percent in
 in Mexico              January from year-earlier levels. Imports fell 56 percent during September
 through December 1982. We estimate that imports in February and March
 remained at least 60 percent below last year. Mexico's debt moratorium
 interrupted normal trade credit lines, limiting imports to goods that could be
 paid for by cash or barter.
 Mexican industrial and government officials predict, and we agree, that no
 rebound in imports will be possible soon, despite the $5 billion commercial
 credit signed in March. The bulk of the initial $1.7 billion installment is being
 used to repay a $500 million bridge loan, catch up on public- and-private
 sector interest obligations, and partially rebuild depleted reserves. With no
 quick resolution of the debt moratorium or reversal of capital flight in sight,
 we believe imports will remain drastically reduced during the next six months
 at least.
 Because of shortages of critical imported raw materials, manufacturers have
 closed numerous factories, and many industries report current production off
 50 to 65 percent.
 Many exporters have not been able to maintain
 production because of exchange losses suffered under Mexico's tight foreign
 exchange controls. As a result, bankruptcies are up sharply, unemployment is
 growing, local supplies of final goods are dwindling, and inflationary pressures
 are mounting.
 Iraq Seeking           Iraq is negotiating new financial arrangements with France, West Germany,
 Financial Assistance   and Japan to help cover payments for arms purchases and civilian projects.
 Baghdad reportedly agreed last week to provide France $530 million worth of
 crude oil annually to help finance about 60 percent of its $5 billion arms debt.
 Iraq is. seeking the necessary 50,000 barrels of oil per day from Qatar. In addi-
 tion, the Iraqi Foreign Minister says Kuwait will finance at least $100 million
 for the purchase from France of Super Etendard naval strike aircraft and
 Gazelle helicopters. West German companies have offered to defer for two

 years payments due in 1983 on an estimated $1.2 billion that Iraq will owe for
 work on industrial projects, according to the US Interests Section in Baghdad.
 Last week the West German agency that insures export credits agreed to
 guarantee these payments. The Iraqis, however, have turned down a Japanese
 proposal that would enable them to defer only until 1984 payments due Japan.
 Iraq, meanwhile, finally has received a $500 million commercial loan syndicat-
 ed primarily by Arab banks. This syndication is in addition to the $1,050
 million in concessionary loans that Iraq has received thus far from the other
 Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Last year Baghdad received about $5.5 billion
 from those states. Western governments and companies probably will continue
 to beat least partly responsive to Iraqi requests for concessions in hopes of sal-
 vaging their already heavy financial commitments and of gaining lucrative
 contracts in Iraq when the war ends. At the same time, the limited Western
 participation in the commercial loan does not augur well for new bank credits.
 Iraq is likely to count on the Persian Gulf states to provide additional financial
 aid.
 Kuwait Drawing on     The decline last year in Kuwait's oil revenues by almost 35 percent has created
 Investment Income     cash flow problems. Kuwait's investment income of some $7 billion, however,
 now is about the same as its income from oil revenues and provides a cushion
 to cover revenue shortfalls.                           the government is
 using an increasing share of investment income-normally reinvested in
 foreign assets-to cover current expenditures, such as salaries and subsidies.
 In addition, officials are shifting some of the $70 billion in foreign assets to
 high-yield, short-term dollar investments from long-term investments-antici-
 pating that the government will be forced to draw on them. Kuwait is probably
 in a better position to weather the current slack oil market than most Gulf
 states because of its small population, its small-scale domestic capital invest-
 ment program, and its large buildup of foreign assets.
 Cuban Crop Losses     Almost constant rain and high winds have resulted in serious crop losses for
 Cuba. A Western embassy in Havana places the loss of sugar at 1 million tons,
 or about $150 million in hard currency at current market prices. Cuban press
 reports indicate that nearly 30 percent of the tobacco crop was destroyed for
 an additional loss of $25 million. Sixty-five percent of the tomato crop and 25
 percent of other basic foodstuffs also were destroyed, according to the Cuban
 press. Moreover, spring plantings have been interrupted and agricultural
 facilities have been damaged

 Although Havana may be exaggerating the extent of the damage to manipu-
 late the international price of sugar or use weather losses as an excuse for not
 reaching its planned output for sugar,
 excessive rains have delayed the harvest. The heavy press coverage given to
 crop losses by Havana suggests that it will opt for increased consumer
 austerity rather than significantly increase its hard currency debt to accom-
 modate food imports. Without additional Western credits, Havana may appeal
 to Western countries, particularly sympathetic ones such as Spain, for
 favorable financing terms for food imports and may request increased aid from
 the USSR. Moscow will be reluctant to provide much, if any, convertible
 currency assistance to Cuba but may permit Havana to decrease its protocol
 commitment of sugar exports to the Soviet Union, freeing these exports for
 hard currency markets in the West. A loss of revenue from lower sugar and to-
 bacco exports would decrease Cuba's already slim chances for meeting trade
 targets established in its recent debt rescheduling agreement.

 Banana Crop Damage     Foreign exchange losses as a result of extensive wind damage last month to
 in Honduras            Honduras's banana crop could reach $70 million, equal to a 10-percent cut in
 and Guatemala          already depressed export projections for 1983. Guatemala stands to lose about
 $50 million because of similar damage. The resulting reduction in export taxes
 could widen troublesome budget deficits in these countries. Moreover, the
 suspension of a total of 5,000 banana workers will aggravate unemployment in
 the banana-growing regions and could lead to labor unrest. Because the
 multinational fruit companies will be hard pressed to raise the $15 million
 needed in each country to replace ruined banana trees, they may scale down

 and restoration of price controls on essential commodities. The wage restric-

 imposed by President Kaunda in December and January to meet IMF
 conditions for a major loan, which is now being negotiated. Kaunda, who is
 mindful of severe labor unrest in 1981 and anxious for strong support from the
 unions in the national elections scheduled for November, probably will try to
 negotiate a compromise. Nonetheless, he may have difficulty coming up with a

 rest to Barbados. The Guyanese regime is so widely despised in Trinidad that
 the full extent of disbursements has been hidden. Credits to Jamaica never
 materialized because Trinidad tried to wring routing concessions for its
 money-losing national airline out of Kingston. Other Caribbean ministates
 could not comply with the complicated documentation demanded, and addi-

 Improvements at Soviet   The USSR has begun a major program to install advanced grain-handling
 Grain Ports              equipment. The Soviets have ordered 32 high-output, pneumatic unloading

 February, eight of these towers have been put into operation at three grain

 major grain ports by 25 percent, or to at least 6.2 million tons per month. The
 20 towers on order could increase capacity by almost 2 million additional tons
 per month. It is unclear, however, why the Soviets are acquiring so much new
 offloading equipment. Seasonal shortages of grain railcars have prevented full
 year-round use of existing port equipment for several years, and little storage
 capacity is being added at the ports to hold grain awaiting rail transportation.

 Brazil: Bleak Economic Prospects
 Brazil continues to face foreign exchange difficul-
 ties despite the conclusion of new loan agreements.
 The government is now making the adjustments
 required to retain crucial bank support but, with
 the austerity program already drawing fire, it
 probably will waver and fail to meet all IMF
 targets. At best, Brazil this year will experience a
 contraction of 3 to 5 percent in economic activity
 accompanied by a 95-percent rate of inflation, and
 growing political unrest.
 The risk remains that Brasilia may yet declare a
 payments moratorium; indeed, the financial press is
 openly speculating that a payments suspension is
 imminent. Such an event would lead to a cessation
 of all new lending, causing economic activity to
 plummet at a 10-percent annual rate while driving
 inflation into triple digits. Under such conditions,
 Brazil's economic crisis would severely test the
 government's ability to cope with political stress,
 spill over to other South American borrowers, and
 adversely affect US bank and business interests
 The Government Responds
 Since December, Planning Minister Delfim Netto
 has tried to engineer a major rescue operation. To
 regain banker support, he promised a variety of
 policy adjustments. A stabilization plan, endorsed
 by the IMF, calls for tough measures to slash the
 1983 current account deficit 50 percent to $7
 billion and to reduce inflation to an annual rate of
 70 percent by December.
 According to Embassy and press reporting, Brasilia
 has moved to slow the economy and strengthen the
 external accounts. To reduce the public deficit,
 Brasilia ordered new cuts in Treasury spending, a
 20-percent reduction in state corporation invest-
 ment, tax increases, and hikes in public-sector
 tariffs. The National Monetary Council tried to
 slow rapid monetary expansion by increasing agri-
 cultural interest rates, tightening eligibility stand-
 ards for some subsidized credits, and ordering price
 hikes aimed at phasing out wheat and petroleum
 product subsidies. The government's economic
 team also announced a modification of wage policy,
 a large devaluation to stimulate exports and re-
 strain imports, and cuts in overseas tourist allow-
 ances.
 The economic retrenchments have provoked sharp
 criticism of government policies from opposition
 politicians, the media, and union leaders. The
 abrupt shifts in policy have drawn fire, especially in
 the new Congress. Embassy and press reporting
 also indicate that Brazilian businessmen have be-
 come increasingly critical of the government's eco-
 nomic strategy. Moreover, restrictions in the salary
 law and rising unemployment are causing frequent
 Without violating its IMF agreement, Brasilia has
 taken steps to assuage its domestic critics and
 regain business confidence. In February the gov-
 ernment reinstituted price controls on 273 products
 in an effort to dampen inflation. On 4 March the
 government announced three new programs to help
 small businesses obtain additional financing and
 promote exports. Later in the month, the National
 Monetary Council announced a series of measures
 aimed at lowering domestic interest rates and
 ending speculation in the financial markets. Addi-
 tionally, Brasilia has attempted to offset some of
 the adverse impact of the February devaluation by
 instructing banks to make available new credits at
 preferential rates to firms with dollar-denominated
 debts and lowering import taxes on purchases of
 mineral, metal, and chemical products.

 ing Facility. Brazil withdrew $500 million from the
 CFF in December and plans to take $2.5 billion from
 both facilities this year.
 The Private Banks
 Support from the IMF was contingent upon assist-
 ance from private banks. On 20 December 1982
 Brasilia petitioned its leading creditors for a four-
 part financial package including:
 ? Continued access to $8.8 billion in short-term trade
 related credits-mostly for raw material imports
 and export prefinancing.
 ? Restoration of $5 billion in interbank credit lines

 inflation higher in March while doing little to

 growing doubts about Brazil's economic pros-
 pects caused businessmen to channel funds into
 overseas money market accounts this year. Re-
 newed speculation about another large devaluation
 will provide new incentives to get funds out of the
 initial expenditure cuts and revenue measures prob-
 ably will prove inadequate to offset automatic
 spending increases triggered by rising inflation. F-
 country
 Despite the large devaluations, we anticipate lack-
 luster export performance until at least late sum-
 mer. Although Brazil may reach its $22 billion
 export target for 1983, exports will be stalled for a
 while by weak recovery in consumer and industrial
 demand in the developed countries, weak commod-
 ity prices, and tougher import restrictions in Bra-
 zil's major Third World markets. Beyond this, a
 continuation of exports outside of official channels
 could also hinder the government's ability to
 achieve its goals.
 We judge that Brasilia's economic team will also
 have problems in complying with the IMF's domes-
 tic performance targets.' The failure to increase
 interest rates for export credits, the lack of a
 precise timetable for phasing out product subsidies,
 and the application of only a moderate increase in
 agricultural interest rates is already translating
 into stronger-than-anticipated demand for funds.
 According to Embassy reporting, monetary expan-
 sion surged to a 97-percent annual rate in February
 compared with 85 percent for 1982. Beyond this,
 the large devaluation and the failure to apply tough
 wage restraints will continue to fuel inflation.
 Based on Embassy reports, we doubt that Brasilia
 will meet its public-sector financing targets. The
 ' Some problems have already arisen. On 5 March, Brasilia
 amended the original IMF agreement. Because of the large devalu-
 ation, the government revised its inflation target to 85 to 90 percent
 in December. It also respecified quarterly balance-of-payments
 performance requirements but did not modify the annual external
 These problems augur renewed tensions in dealing
 with the international banking community. With     25X1
 arrearages again building, Central Bank President
 Langoni has renewed appeals to creditors-without
 success thus far-to provide new standby credits to
 meet immediate obligations. We and a number of
 banking sources expect Brasilia will seek $2-4
 billion in new loans before the end of September.
 Any such request for funds probaly will be greeted
 by demands for even tougher austerity measures
 Even as difficult new adjustments are required, we
 believe Brasilia will encounter intensifying domes-
 tic criticism of its stabilization program. Based on
 past experience, state corporations, agricultural
 producers, and businessmen probably will bid for
 concessions to blunt the impact of austerity. As
 consumer prices and unemployment rise, opposition
 will broaden to include the middle class and labor.
 The increased assertiveness of the Congress and
 state governors that has grown out of recent politi-
 cal liberalization will complicate efforts to carry
 out the austerity program. At this juncture, we
 believe the government is likely to hold the line on
 the measures already enacted but waver on imple-
 menting unpopular new measures that could spark
 political problems.
 The Economy in 1983
 We believe the only plausible scenarios for Brazil-
 ian economic performance entail declines in real
 output this year. The severity of the decline will
 depend on the willingness of Brazil's foreign credi-
 tors to provide additional financial support. We

 Based on recent conversations, we believe bankers

 Belt tightening and foreign financing constraints
 will cause national output to fall by 3 to 5 percent.
 The economic contraction-borne by industry and
 domestic commerce-will be accompanied by
 growing unemployment and business failures. De-
 spite wage restraints and price controls, the Decem-
 ber over December inflation rate will approach
 triple digits because of the large devaluation, in-
 creases in public utility rates, and import restric-
 tions.
 Another year of worsening economic performance
 will heighten social unrest. Economic deprivation
 following retrenchment and persistent triple-digit
 inflation probably will increase violent crime, wild-
 cat strikes, and cost-of-living demonstrations. Be-
 cause of its firm monopoly on the instruments of
 force, we believe the Figueiredo government will be
 able to avoid serious problems. Moreover, the gov-
 ernment probably will appeal to Brazilian willing-
 ness to make sacrifices for grandeza, major power
 status.
 A Worst Case Scenario. If the government misses
 its stabilization targets by a wide margin, however,
 bankers probably will refuse new credit requests.
 With its reserves depleted, Brasilia would have
 little choice but to declare a temporary moratorium
 on debt payments. Such a declaration would cause
 a cessation of all foreign lending until new austerity
 and rescheduling arrangements are worked out.
 With its borrowings cut, we believe Brasilia would
 be forced to reduce the current account deficit to
 $5.5 billion, mainly by slashing imports.
 The economy probably would go into a severe
 tailspin. The reduced availability of critical raw
 material imports-metals, oil, chemicals-would
 cause severe disruptions in industrial production.
 We estimate that real growth would fall at a
 10-percent annual rate as the industrial downturn
 reduced new investments and caused declines in
 construction and commercial activities. A severe
 cash-flow squeeze probably would result in a wave
 of business failures, sending unemployment into
 double digits. In these circumstances, commodity
 shortages would boost inflation above 100 percent.
 Secret
 8 April 1983
 Such an economic crisis would severely test the
 government's ability to cope with political stress.
 At this juncture, however, we cannot judge the
 likely consequences.
 Signs To Watch
 New external shocks could quickly gut Brasilia's
 stabilization program. With the debt service ratio
 hovering at the 80-percent level, any export short-
 falls induced by climatic disaster, low commodity
 prices, or continued recession in industrial nations
 would pose unmanageable financial strains. Brazil
 also remains vulnerable to higher world interest
 rates; a 1-percentage-point increase in LIBOR
 would add an estimated $500-600 million annually
 to debt servicing obligations. Beyond this, Brasilia
 may yet be forced to declare a payments moratori-
 um if its major creditors split over the country's
 financial strategy and thereby prevent the syndica-
 tion of a large new credit.
 Failure to regain public confidence could also have
 serious economic consequences. Speculation in the
 financial markets would intensify, preventing any
 increase in domestic capital formation. Business-
 men probably would continue to postpone most new
 investment programs at home and persist in capital
 flight.
 Implications for the United States
 We believe Brazil will increasingly look to the
 United States for support in resolving its financial
 problems. Until private bankers reconstitute the
 safety net arrangement, Brasilia probably will call
 on Washington from time to time for emergency
 financial support. Based on Embassy reporting, we
 also expect the Brazilian Government to press
 Washington to lead the effort to reschedule official
 credits maturing in 1983. As the need for new
 money becomes apparent, Brasilia may expect the
 United States to back credits to finance imports
 and assistance in discounting trade receivables with
 US banks.

 Secret
 Any disruption in debt servicing could spur Brasilia
 to seek debt relief. A formal debt rescheduling
 would be forced to consider stretching principal
 and interest payments to lessen Brazil's foreign
 exchange stringencies. Interest payments are now
 the single-largest outflow in the current account,
 claiming 45 percent of export earnings. If, in the
 worst case, bankers were unwilling to cooperate, a
 prolonged interest moratorium would further re-
 duce US bank profits and could cause some severe
 problems. Moreover, Brazil's troubles would ad-
 versely affect other South American borrowers,
 further intensifying the adverse impact on the US
 economy as they make even tougher import cuts
 and suspend repayments.
 A payments moratorium remains a continuing pos-
 sibility. Much of the immediate impact of a mora-
 torium would fall on the nine largest US commer-
 cial banks' profit positions. Brasilia would also face
 the need to make larger-than-anticipated import
 cuts, thereby reducing even further US exports to
 that market.

 Venezuela:
 Worsening Economic Outlook
 Venezuela's economic problems reflect in part its
 extreme dependence on oil exports and bankers'
 reluctance to lend in Latin America. Its basic
 problems, however, are the government's over-
 spending of the oil bonanza, its failure to diversify
 the economy, and its poor management of foreign
 debt. For 1983, Caracas's ability to pursue effective
 adjustment policies will be hampered by mounting
 political pressures spawned by the upcoming
 December presidential elections.
 The government's unwillingness to adopt a strict
 adjustment program has left international bankers
 reluctant to cooperate in refinancing Caracas's
 large external debt. Indeed,
 the Venezuelan Government has yet to realize the
 seriousness of its financial position. To regain
 banker support, we believe that Venezuela will
 ultimately resort to the IMF this year. The imposi-
 tion of a tough IMF stabilization program will
 contribute to further economic decline in the near
 term.
 Venezuela's current financial stress emerged over a
 year ago as oil revenues dropped abruptly. In 1982
 oil export revenues fell by 20 percent. Dependent
 on oil for 70 percent of all budget revenues,
 Caracas was forced to trim planned central govern-
 ment expenditures for 1982 by over $4 billion and
 introduce new revenue measures, including a sharp
 increase in gasoline prices. The government was
 able to avoid even tougher spending cuts-particu-
 larly for politically sacrosanct social programs-by
 boosting oil production from 1.5 million b/d in
 second-quarter 1982 to 2.3 million b/d by the end
 of the year.
 The decline in oil revenues contributed to a loss of
 foreign lender confidence. Wary bankers began
 insisting on sharply higher rates for new borrow-
 ings. Caracas refused to accede to banker demands,
 awaiting a rebound in its oil prospects and credit-
 worthiness. It postponed plans to restructure into
 longer maturities some $8.8 billion in maturing
 short-term debt. This move backfired, however, in
 the wake of Argentine and Mexican repayment
 problems. In September, Caracas was stunned by
 demands to pay off large loans for two cash-
 strapped government agencies suddenly unable to
 roll over debt. A subsequent restructuring attempt
 attracted only half the targeted amounts even
 though Caracas accepted tougher borrowing terms
 and offered to guarantee the debt of less credit-
 worthy state corporations. Looming financial prob-
 lems undermined domestic business confidence and
 promoted large-scale capital flight, which, accord-
 ing to Central Bank estimates, totaled $5 billion for
 the year.
 The decline in oil revenues and consequent spend-
 ing slowdown caused GNP to contract by 2 percent
 in 1982, according to US Embassy estimates. On
 the external front, the current account deteriorated
 by some $6 billion; Venezuela registered a $2.2
 billion deficit on this account as exports dropped 20
 percent. Moreover, the combined effect of loan
 payoffs and capital flight caused international re-
 serves to drop by over 50 percent to $8.5 billion,
 excluding a $3 billion boost from a gold revalua-
 tion. The dropoff in economic activity and a mea-
 ger 1.2-percent increase in the money supply re-
 duced inflation to an 8-percent annual rate.

 Mounting Pressures for Retrenchment
 Anticipating little immediate improvement in the
 world oil market, Venezuelan President Herrera
 had planned to continue austere economic policies
 this year, his last in office. The 1983 budget
 originally called for a 10-percent cut in spending to
 $18.1 billion, petroleum tax revenues of $11.1
 billion, and a zero deficit. For the second year in a
 row, nonoil investment programs bore the brunt of
 the cutbacks. With the latest OPEC accord, how-
 ever, Venezuelan oil exports probably will be limit-
 ed to only 1.4 million b/d instead of 1.6 million
 b/d, while Caracas will also receive at least $1.50
 less per barrel. This would cause projected oil tax
 revenues to decline 25 percent to $8.7 billion. To
 balance this shortfall, even tougher budget and
 import cuts will be required.
 Continuing reserve losses, demands for payments of
 maturing short-term debt, and disarray in oil mar-
 kets are causing Caracas to take stronger measures
 to bolster its external payments position. In late
 February, the government suspended foreign ex-
 change transactions for one week, implemented
 exchange controls, and introduced a three-tiered

 multiple exchange rate-the first in 18 years. At
 the same time, prices on all goods and services were
 frozen for 60 days to prevent offsetting price
 increases in the wake of the implicit devaluation.
 An additional source of pressure on the government
 comes from international banks who want stricter
 austerity measures before committing any funds.
 At a minimum, the current bank advisory group is
 demanding the formation of an intergovernmental
 team to devise a coordinated response to the present
 crisis.
 Resorting to the IMF
 We are skeptical that Caracas will be able to
 initiate an effective stabilization program on its
 own. With the President's Social Christian Party
 trailing in the presidential campaign that is now
 under way, Herrera continues to resist needed
 adjustment measures. He probably will remain

 extremely reluctant to implement measures that
 would raise unemployment and inflation in the
 short run. Moreover, intense squabbling over eco-
 nomic policies between the President's two main
 economic advisers, Finance Minister Sosa and Cen-
 tral Bank President Diaz Bruzual, has prevented
 effective implementation of some policies already
 adopted.
 The government's poor management abilities have
 been alarmingly evident recently. Caracas has
 demonstrated itself incapable of administering the
 complex exchange system that it has been slowly
 defining over the past few weeks. Powerful interest
 groups have been lobbying for access to preferential
 exchange rates, potentially undermining the effec-
 tiveness of the system. Meanwhile, in recent meet-
 ings with bankers, Sosa had been unable to detail
 the actual amount of debt Venezuela wished to
 refinance or to present a realistic economic and
 financial outlook.
 In a recent domestic press conference, Finance
 Minister Sosa indicated that Venezuela would re-
 sort to the IMF if debt refinancing bogs down and
 exchange controls are ineffective in stemming for-
 eign reserve losses. We believe Caracas will soon
 have little choice but to begin formal debt resched-
 uling negotiations in conjunction with the IMF.
 According to the US Embassy, a formal standby
 arrangement with the IMF could enable Venezuela
 to obtain a maximum of $4.5 billion over three
 years.
 Tough adjustments will be required if Venezuela is
 to reach an agreement with the IMF. Press reports
 indicate that an IMF technical mission that recent-
 ly paid a visit to Caracas proposed: (a) cuts of 20
 percent or more in public spending, (b) the restruc-
 turing or liquidation of state-owned enterprises, (c)
 the removal of price controls and the withdrawal of
 consumer subsidies, (d) reductions in the public-
 sector wage bill, (e) continued tight monetary poli-
 cy, and (f) a sharp devaluation.
 Venezuela's Downward Financial Spiral
 The initial debt restructuring plan formulated by
 Caracas last fall fell apart early this year. In
 January international lenders suspended refinanc-
 ings of maturing credits because of mounting
 arrearages on debt repayments and fears of a
 precipitous drop in Venezuela's oil earnings. Con-
 sequently, public entities began informing their
 creditors that only interest would be paid pending
 the conclusion of government rescheduling efforts.
 An international advisory committee was set up in
 early March to respond to Finance Minister Sosa's
 request to stretch debt repayments through 1990 or
 beyond and grant a one- to two-year grace period.
 With bankers unwilling to move forward on Sosa's
 request, Caracas announced on 22 March that the
 suspension of principal payments for most public
 debt was formally extended to 1 July to give the
 government sufficient time to reschedule the entire
 $13 billion in principal due this year. More recent-
 ly, press reports indicate that bankers considered
 the stabilization plan Sosa detailed to them early
 this month inadequate because it failed to incorpo-
 rate many of the tough recommendations proposed
 by the IMF technical team that just left Caracas.
 The Economy in 1983
 For much of the remainder of this year, we expect
 Venezuela to be laboring under an IMF austerity
 program. Caracas will be forced to struggle with
 several budget-balancing tactics at the urging of its
 foreign creditors. These would include increased
 taxation of nonoil revenues, greater efforts to pro-
 mote government efficiency, selected cuts in both
 investment projects and social services, and reduced
 subsidies for some consumer products.

 Signs To Watch
 The current oil and liquidity crises are highlighting
 the failure to diversify the economy, which has left
 Venezuela's economic fortunes closely tied to
 trends in the world oil market. The adoption of
 needed reforms, as urged by international creditors,
 is now being echoed by officials of both major
 parties. We expect some restructuring of unprofit-
 able state corporations to free resources for more
 productive uses. We also anticipate the cutting
 back of the swollen bureaucracy of 1.2 million
 people to improve government services and efficien-
 cy. As depressed oil revenues cause public expendi-
 tures to drop off, officials of both major parties, as
 well as international lenders, are citing the need to
 spur private-sector performance. New initiatives
 are being aired to permit market forces freer rein.
 This changing attitude also may lead to greater
 interest in attracting more foreign investment,
 which could eventually help correct the country's
 existing shortages of capital, technology, and
 skilled management.
 We are concerned, however, about the impact of
 austerity on the highly profitable and efficient oil
 industry. Depressed profits and declining reserves
 already have caused the state-owned oil company,
 PDVSA, to scale back by roughly one-third the $37
 billion initially planned for investment during
 1983-88 and to reconsider its overall development
 strategies. Oil Ministry officials now say they will
 concentrate on increasing production of light and
 medium crudes from traditional fields rather than
 accelerate production from the more costly Orinoco
 Heavy Oil Belt.
 The United States has much at stake in Venezuela:
 ? Venezuela is our largest trading partner in South
 America and has traditionally relied on the Unit-
 ed States for half of its imports.
 ? Venezuela remains our third-largest supplier of
 petroleum.
 ? US banks hold at least one-third of Venezuela's
 total estimated foreign debt of approximately $32
 billion, and US businesses have sizable direct
 investments there.
 ? Venezuela also remains a strong moral and finan-
 cial supporter of democracy in Latin America.
 ing US help in coping with their financial dilemma.
 _____These include the opening of an
 emergency line of credit to the US Treasury, the
 extension of credit for Venezuela's wheat imports,
 prepayment for future petroleum deliveries, and a
 gold swap arrangement. The Venezuelans have
 confirmed that they are especially seeking the
 cooperation of US banks in their debt refinancing
 efforts.
 Declining resources may jeopardize the joint
 Venezuelan/ Mexican oil financing facility. Since
 1974 over $6.5 billion has been disbursed in various
 forms'of economic assistance to the Caribbean
 Basin. Although $400 million was paid out in 1982,
 Venezuela has recently been discouraging the ex-
 pectations of some recipients that it will either
 increase aid or soften credit terms. According to a
 US Embassy source, several administration offi-
 cials have said that prospects are not encouraging
 for renewing the facility for another year when it
 expires in August. The source implied that if
 Mexico withdraws and the agreement lapses Vene-
 zuela probably will continue providing some re-
 duced level of aid and look to the United States to
 step up its assistance. Meanwhile, the prospect of
 increasing Mexican-Venezuelan competition for
 the US oil market will, we believe, complicate
 Washington's relations with both countries.

 Spain: Socialist Economic Policy
 The Socialist government has proposed a conserva-
 tive economic program for 1983 that will do little to
 promote economic recovery. In the election cam-
 paign last fall the Socialists promised to boost real
 economic growth this year to 2.5 percent and to
 create 800,000 new jobs over the next four years.
 Now, however, their primary objectives appear to
 be reducing the inflation rate and the trade deficit.
 Consequently, monetary and fiscal policies will be
 tightened; these policies are unlikely to alleviate
 Spain's growing unemployment problem. Accord-
 ing to Finance and Economic Minister Miguel
 Boyer, the government has no other option because
 expansionary policies would lead to renewed infla-
 tion and even larger payments deficits.
 The Protracted Slump
 According to preliminary estimates, the Spanish
 economy stagnated in 1982 for the fourth consecu-
 tive year. Real GDP growth was approximately 1.1
 percent compared with -0.3 percent in 1981; the
 increase derived almost entirely from the growth of
 public consumption and exports. Agricultural pro-
 duction improved from the drought-affected levels
 in 1981/82, but industrial production was held
 back by continuing problems of overcapacity, over-
 manning, low investment, and slack demand. The
 tourist industry was one of the brighter spots; the
 number of visitors during January- November 1982
 was up about 5 percent from the previous year,
 while gross tourist revenues increased approximate-
 ly 23 percent in pesetas and about 6 percent in
 dollar terms.
 Economic stagnation has produced an unemploy-
 ment rate second only to Turkey in Western Eu-
 rope. Registered unemployment rose by 400,000
 during 1982 reaching 2.2 million, 16.5 percent of
 the labor force, by the end of the year. The number
 of jobless rose most sharply in the industrial and
 service sectors, which employ about two-thirds of
 the labor force. Increased spending on public works
 prevented an even further increase in unemploy-
 Inflation has slowed for five consecutive years but,
 according to provisional statistics, was still 14.4
 percent in 1982. While real wages rose by 2 to
 5 percent each year during 1978-81, they fell last
 year by about 1 percent. The reduction in real
 wages resulted from the 1982 National Employ-
 ment Agreement-a pact involving government,

 business, and labor aimed at preventing further
 increases in unemployment in return for wage
 moderation. Labor unions will have to make even
 greater concessions, however, to achieve Madrid's
 goal of pushing inflation rates closer to those in
 other industrial nations. Spanish inflation has ex-
 ceeded the average rate in the OECD by at least 3
 percentage points in each of the last five years, and
 last year the differential widened to nearly 7
 percentage points.
 Despite high inflation and world recession, the
 current account deficit narrowed by $900 million to
 $4.1 billion in 1982. Export volume increased by
 2.5 percent over 1981, even though the growing
 differential between inflation rates in Spain and the
 rest of the OECD reduced export competitiveness.
 The dollar value of exports shrank by half a billion
 dollars suggesting that exporters accepted lower
 profit margins in return for a larger share of the
 market. Imports are estimated to have fallen $1.4
 billion over the previous year, reflecting lower
 Secret

 energy imports. Consequently, the trade deficit
 narrowed by annroximately $900 million to $9.2
 billion.
 To finance its 1982 balance-of-payments deficit,
 Madrid was forced to draw down its reserves by
 $3.5 billion. Private long-term capital inflows tradi-
 tionally have been large, ranging from $2 billion to
 $4 billion annually in 1978-81. Last year, however,
 negative interest differentials, the continuing de-
 preciation of the peseta, and the introduction of
 peseta-denominated syndications by foreign bank
 branches prompted a shift in corporate borrowing
 from the Eurocurrency market to the domestic
 market. Firms were discouraged from seeking new
 loans abroad by the prospect of rising interest
 payments; in addition, many outstanding foreign
 debts were prepaid and replaced with domestic
 credits. As a result, net private external borrowing

 Secret
 dropped from $2.5 billion to $650 million. More-
 over, increased trade financing contributed to the
 expansion of net private external lending from $627
 million to $1.4 billion.
 Socialist Policy Response
 Despite the severity of Spain's unemployment prob-
 lem, the Socialist program emphasizes controlling
 inflation and improving the balance of payments.
 Consistent with these objectives, the government
 plans to tighten monetary policy this year by
 holding money growth to 13 percent, compared
 with about 16 percent in both 1981 and 1982. In
 addition, Madrid has cut about $1 billion from the
 banks' lendable reserves by increasing the amount
 of cash reserves private banks must hold from 5.75
 percent to 6.75 percent of non-interest-earning
 deposits. The government may tighten credit fur-
 ther by increasing the reserve requirement on se-
 lected interest-earning deposits.
 The government's preoccupation with the trade
 imbalance probably was a factor in the decision to
 stop supporting the peseta in December 1982.
 During the first 11 months of 1982 the peseta had
 depreciated by 18 percent against the dollar, and
 on 4 December Madrid announced a further 8-
 percent devaluation. Although critics charged that
 a devaluation of 25 to 30 percent was needed to
 stimulate export growth, Boyer argued that a larg-
 er devaluation would have caused excessive in-
 creases in import costs. Since December 1982 the
 peseta has depreciated another 7 percent. Never-
 theless, the Bank of Spain is not planning a second
 devaluation. Instead, it intends to manage the
 peseta's downward float.
 The 1983 budget has not yet been presented to
 Parliament, but it is expected to call for a $12
 billion deficit; the 1982 deficit of $10 billion
 equaled 6 percent of GDP. Public statements by
 government officials suggest that greater social
 security and unemployment benefits will be respon-
 sible for most of the increase. Growth in real
 public-sector investment will be limited to about
 3 percent, a sharp drop from the 15- to 20-percent
 increases in the 1981 and 1982 budgets. In addi-
 tion, taxes on larger incomes will be increased, and
 13.4 percent to 14.5 percent.                       25X1
 the proportion of taxes to GDP will be raised from  25X1
 During the election campaign the Socialists prom-
 ised to create 200,000 new jobs each year for the
 next four years. They envisioned that this would
 take care of the 140,000 new entrants into the job
 market each year and reduce the number of unem-
 ployed by 60,000 annually. The plans advanced to
 date have been rather modest and have not entailed
 any government expenditure. The administration
 has sent a bill to Parliament proposing a reduction
 of the workweek from 44 hours to 40 hours and the
 establishment of a minimum 30-day vacation. Ac-
 cording to Joaquin Almunia, the Minister of Labor,
 the measure was intended to prevent job losses in
 the near term. When the economy recovers, the
 Socialists hope that firms will hire more workers.
 The administration has also lowered the permitted     25X1
 ratio of temporary workers to permanent employees
 and reduced the duration of temporary contracts in
 the hope of forcing employers to create permanent
 jobs.
 The Socialists probably will be unable to achieve all
 their economic objectives. Their conservative poli-
 cies, coupled with a weak recovery at best among
 other West European countries, suggest that their
 revised goal of attaining 2-percent real growth in
 GDP is too optimistic. Because of depressed de-
 mand in the developed countries, it is highly likely
 that real export growth will fall well short of the      25X1
 impressive 12-percent average rate of growth over
 the last 10 years. High interest rates and high
 unemployment probably will continue to depress
 private investment and consumption. Most of the
 impetus for economic growth thus will have to
 come from the public sector. The Socialists, howev-
 er, intend to increase expenditures only moderately
 in order to prevent sharp increases in the budget
 deficit and additional inflationary pressure. I   25X1

 Madrid's monetary targets are shaky. Money stock
 growth could exceed the planned 13 percent if-as
 is likely-the budget deficit is financed through
 money creation to the same degree as in the last
 two years. In 1981 and 1982, borrowing from the
 Bank of Spain covered nearly three-fourths of the
 government's total financing requirement. The cen-
 tral bank attempted to offset the inflationary im-
 pact of this approach by limiting the amount of
 credit available to the private sector. If the
 Socialists monetize a similar proportion of the
 deficit through central bank borrowings in 1983,
 they will either have to impose even greater credit
 restrictions, which could dampen private invest-
 ment, or raise their liquidity target.
 The government's ability to meet its targeted infla-
 tion rate of 12 percent will depend on its monetary
 policy and on its success in promoting wage moder-
 ation. Another round of real wage reductions is
 needed to lower inflation to 12 percent. A collective
 bargaining agreement was signed in January be-
 tween the employers' association, the General
 Workers' Union, and the Confederation of Work-
 ers' Commissions, which set the range for 1983
 salary increases at 9.5 to 12.5 percent. Although
 the initial wage increases could on average be
 somewhat lower than the government's target, the
 agreement stipulates that if the consumer price
 index rises by more than 9 percent by 30 Septem-
 ber 1983, wages will be revised in order to maintain
 the workers' real purchasing power.
 Government increases in administered prices, such
 as fuel, electricity, and public transportation, will
 make achievement of Madrid's inflation and wage
 goals difficult. Shortly after taking office, the
 Socialists announced price hikes of approximately
 20 percent for petroleum products. Government
 officials estimate that these increases will add 1.5
 to 2 percentage points to the inflation rate next
 year. A proposed 7-percent increase in electricity
 rates and boosts in coal and natural gas prices of 10
 and 17 percent, respectively, will further aggravate
 inflation.
 Secret
 8 April 1983
 Registered unemployment probably will continue
 to grow and may approach 20 percent by the end of
 1983. A study completed by the National Institute
 of Employment estimates that in order to prevent
 further increases in unemployment, real GDP
 would have to grow by at least 3.5 percent this
 year; we believe that Spanish growth will only be
 about 1 percent in 1983. Moreover, the labor
 proposals advanced by the Socialists may have a
 detrimental effect on the job market. For example,
 the Spanish Confederation of Business Organiza-
 tions contends that a shorter workweek would
 increase employers' costs and reduce productivity
 without providing incentives to hire more workers.
 The confederation also argues that increases in
 employers' contributions to social security make
 labor more expensive. Moreover, government plans
 to rationalize the textile, footwear, shipbuilding,
 and steel industries will cut the work force in these
 industries as much as 20 percent.
 As the ranks of the unemployed grow, Prime
 Minister Felipe Gonzalez probably will face
 mounting pressure to change the direction of eco-
 nomic policy. The Socialists currently have the
 support of the labor unions, but failure to reduce
 unemployment could result in labor unrest. More-
 over, there is a lack of unanimity within the
 government over the priority attached to control-
 ling inflation. Almunia and Boyer appear resigned
 to the proposition that little can be done to prevent
 rising unemployment without rekindling inflation.
 Vice Prime Minister Alfonso Guerra, on the other
 hand, is more concerned about the political ramifi-
 cations of following a conservative policy. In the
 short term, Almunia and Boyer probably will have
 their way. By the end of the year, however, domes-
 tic pressure for more expansionary policies-partic-
 ularly from the Socialists' working-class constitu-
 ency-probably will be too strong for the
 government to ignore. Government leaders will be
 hoping in the meantime for a worldwide economic
 recovery strong enough to allow them to ease their
 policies somewhat without doing serious damage to
 the balance of payments.

 Protectionist Trends
 in Developing Countries
 Most LDCs continue to rely heavily on import
 barriers to protect local industries from foreign
 competition. Although the levels of protection re-
 main high, they tend to rise and fall with the
 countries' foreign financial positions. Recently,
 many LDCs have raised barriers to deal with
 burgeoning debt problems. There are a few excep-
 tions. The more dynamic exporters such as South
 Korea and Taiwan have steadily eased barriers
 since the late 1970s.
 Developed nations have accepted the LDC need for
 protection for both "infant industry" and financial
 reasons. In GATT negotiations, for example, LDCs
 benefit from all developed country trade liberaliza-
 tion on a most-favored-nation basis, but they are
 not obligated to extend reciprocal concessions. In
 practice, many LDCs have interpreted their exemp-
 tion from selected GATT obligations as a license to
 maintain restrictive import regimes. Although ar-
 rangements between LDC debtors and the IMF for
 financing packages customarily include trade liber-
 alization objectives, all parties recognize that a
 reduction in protectionism will be possible only in
 later stages of economic recovery.
 Argentina. Argentina's military government liber-
 alized the country's traditionally protectionist im-
 port policies over the last several years, but strict
 import control measures imposed during the April
 1982 Falklands conflict remain in effect. In April
 1982 a licensing requirement was imposed on all
 imports, and in May nonessential imports, includ-
 ing most consumer goods, were banned. Before the
 Falklands conflict, only about 200 items-primari-
 ly machinery and equipment-required licenses.
 Banned items had been reduced from 700 in 1975
 to a handful in early 1982. As is currently the case
 in other countries with severe payments problems,
 issuance of import licenses may depend on foreign
 exchange availability, administrative determination
 of need for the import, or the influence or pressure
 an importer can exert on government officials
 Brazil. Brazil's import policies have become con-
 siderably more restrictive in the past year in re-
 sponse to its balance-of-payments problems. About
 1,900 items-largely chemicals, pharmaceuticals,
 and machinery-were added to the list of banned
 imports, which consisted mostly of luxuries and
 nonessential goods. The ban, however, does not
 apply to imports from other Latin American Inte-
 gration Association members. Private firms are
 now being required to cut imports by 5 percent on
 top of the announced 10-percent cuts imposed in
 July 1982. State-owned firms have been forced to
 cut back as well. In addition, the Foreign Trade
 Department of the Bank of Brazil is supposed to be
 clamping down on import licenses.
 India. India began to liberalize its import policy
 slightly in the late 1970s when its foreign exchange
 position was comfortable. Licensing-the main ve-
 hicle for controlling imports-has been simplified.
 Raw materials and components may be imported
 relatively easily, and the government now tolerates
 limited import competition for domestic manufac-
 turers. Exporters receive special consideration in
 the granting of import licenses. Nevertheless, im-
 ports of most consumer products are still prohibit-
 ed, and New Delhi views import substitution in
 petroleum, fertilizer, steel, and cement as a major
 aspect of its economic policy. Moreover, India now
 faces a huge foreign trade deficit, and higher tariff
 rates were announced last December and again this

 Automotive Import Barriers:
 An Illustration of LDC Protectionism
 To stimulate industrialization and create employ-
 ment, most advanced developing countries maintain
 extensive barriers to automobile and truck imports.
 Barriers include tariffs, quotas, and import licensing
 requirements, as well as harsh local content rules.
 These policies have forced US, Japanese, and West
 European manufacturers to establish manufacturing
 and assembly facilities or joint ventures in many
 LDCs in order to participate in local markets. Local
 content rules for selected LDCs are as follow:
 Mexico            50 percent local content required for
 cars, 65 percent for trucks, but recom-
 mended levels are 75 percent and 85
 percent.
 Venezuela         55 percent local content required, ris-
 ing to 59 percent in 1985. Producers
 can satisfy part of requirement by
 exporting.
 Argentina  96 percent local content rule-a virtual
 import ban-was being liberalized be-
 fore the 1982 import clampdown, with
 some auto imports and exchanges of
 components between domestic and for-
 eign plants allowed.
 Brazil     Autos must be 99 percent Brazilian by
 value. Rules include partial or total
 bans on imports that compete with
 domestic components.
 Chile      1973 local content rule of 70 percent
 has been phased down to 15 percent.
 Auto consumer tax and tariff had also
 been falling until this year.
 Colombia   Stated goal is 25 percent local content,
 but parts imports are denied only when
 local product is competitive.
 February. New Delhi may be tempted to tighten
 import controls when its annual import-export poli-
 cy is announced in April, but it presumably would
 have to convince the IMF that such moves would
 not violate the conditions laid down for further

 Nigeria. Before Nigeria's current financial diffi-
 culties, import restrictions were very limited. The
 few items that did not enter freely were controlled
 through licensing and import bans-such as those
 on goods coming from South Africa and Namibia.
 In April 1982, however, licensing requirements and
 import bans were broadened significantly, and im-
 port deposits from 25 to 250 percent of the value of
 the import were required. Additional restrictions
 announced in January added 150 general catego-
 ries to the import licensing system, thereby includ-
 ing all remaining significant imports. Lagos also
 raised tariffs substantially-some to 175 percent-
 while reducing compulsory import deposits. F_
 Philippines. With Philippine accession to GATT in
 1980, Manila instituted a four-year program of
 tariff and import license liberalization. A World
 Bank structural adjustment program begun in 1981
 has also resulted in liberalization of trade and
 foreign exchange controls. Some items are no long-
 er restricted, and 960 of 1,300 restricted goods are
 being liberalized over three years beginning in
 1981. Average tariffs have been reduced from
 42 percent in 1978 to 28 percent at present.
 Nevertheless, in response to its worsening payments
 position, Manila in January imposed a 3-percent
 surtax on all imports and required that duties and
 taxes be paid when opening letters of credit. Im-
 ports used in the production of exports are exempt.
 South Korea. South Korea is much less protection-
 ist than most developing countries. In 1979 Seoul
 instituted a plan to liberalize 90 percent of South
 Korean import classifications by 1986. Tariffs were
 ers of strategic items, and many agricultural pro-
 ducers will continue to be protected, but rules for
 machinery, electrical and metal products, petro-
 chemicals, and products in which South Korea is
 internationally competitive have been or are sched-  25X1

 Taiwan. Taiwan has been steadily easing its import
 restraints over the past several years. In 1979 the
 government stated its intention to drop tariffs to
 levels maintained by developed countries, and the
 following year announced plans to drop average
 tariffs from 32 to 13 percent by 1983. Priority was
 given to cutting tariffs on raw materials and capital
 goods not produced in Taiwan. Although all im-
 ports require licenses, about 97 percent of all
 categories are licensed automatically and can be
 imported subject only to the availability of foreign
 exchange. The remaining items, primarily luxuries
 and consumer goods, are controlled to protect
 domestic industries; licenses for them are granted
 on a case-by-case basis.)                    25X1
 Venezuela. Venezuela's traditionally protectionist  25X1
 stance toughened substantially in January of this
 year. Two hundred agricultural and industrial
 products were banned for balance-of-payments and
 competitive reasons, and tariffs, already high on
 consumer goods, were increased. Import licenses
 were made mandatory on 565 new items, including
 foods, auto parts, and construction materials. Also
 in response to the payments crisis, the Venezuelan
 Government announced foreign exchange controls
 in February, with only imports of essential goods
 qualifying for foreign exchange at the preferential
 rate. Press reports quote a Colombian Andean Pact
 official as saying the actions could cut pact trade
 with Venezuela in half this year. In response,
 Venezuela has attacked other members' nontariff
 barriers that harm Venezuelan exports.

 The Philippines:
 Economic Decisionmaking
 Manila is in the midst of its most thorough over-
 haul of economic policy since the 1950s-a two-
 track effort designed both to cope with the current
 global recession and restructure the economy over
 the long run. Economic policy currently is the
 product of a decisionmaking framework created by
 constitutional amendments of President Marcos's
 own design that closely followed the dismantling of
 martial law in January 1981. The Philippines's
 economic decisionmaking system has been geared
 to striking a politically acceptable balance between
 the views of Western-educated technocrats, credi-
 tors such as the IMF and the World Bank, and
 influential domestic business interests. The balance
 currently favors the technocrats and creditors,
 chiefly because Marcos recognizes that the econo-
 my is in its worst shape in a decade. Though it is of-
 ten difficult to tell how actively Marcos is involved
 in the economic policy process, we are certain that
 all major decisions require his approval.
 Manila's present staff of technocrats rose to posi-
 tions of prominence during the financial crisis of
 1981 when the collapse of the domestic commercial
 paper market left the private sector without short-
 term financing and the existing government de-
 cisionmaking apparatus with severely damaged
 credibility both at home and abroad. Best known
 among them is a group respectfully referred to
 within government as "the gang of four"-Prime
 Minister and Minister of Finance Virata, Central
 Bank Governor Laya, Minister of Trade and Indus-
 try Ongpin, and Planning Minister Mapa. A back-
 ground of training in US graduate schools and a
 strong inclination toward nationalism mark the
 technocrats' intellectual makeup. All recognize the
 strength of market forces in designing policy and
 each has earned a reputation for honesty and
 expertise.
 Policy planning and coordinating mechanisms
 headed by the technocrats are being strained by the
 recent growth of government. The Monetary
 Board, chaired by Virata with representation from
 most ministries and government agencies, meets
 weekly to plan financial policy. Its management of
 the foreign borrowing program is well above Third
 World standards, but the expansion of foreign
 borrowing since 1980 has sometimes placed too
 many loans in the international capital market at
 once, making potential lenders nervous and occa-
 sionally aborting the borrowing plans of state agen-
 cies. The board's efforts to develop local capital
 markets by reforming financial regulations have       25X1
 sometimes been at odds with growing government
 deficits, which have soaked up an increasing share
 of national savings even as reforms were imple-
 mented to stimulate savings. Economic nationalism
 has also compromised financial planning by limit-
 ing the role of foreign investment in the Philippines.
 The budget process has become unwieldy and has
 yet to adapt to the recent growth of public-sector
 investment spending. In the early 1970s, capital
 expenditures constituted only 10 percent of the
 national budget, and the role of the state enterprise
 sector was relatively small; capital spending took 30
 percent of total government outlays in 1981, ac-
 cording to the World Bank. Last year, ministries
 and state corporations prepared individual capital
 budgets that exceeded available resources by over
 65 percent, according to reports published by the

 The Executive Committee Considers largely technical matters
 according to agenda forwarded
 from President through Prime
 Minister.
 The National Assembly Essentially a rubber stamp, com-
 pletely dominated by ruling party
 apparatus. Nonetheless plays more
 active role in discussion of policy
 than several years ago.
 Domestic Think Tanks and
 Business Institutions
 The Center for Research A privately funded policy analysis
 and Communications  and forecasting group without for-
 mal ties to the government. Exer-
 cises some influence on government
 through its ties to private investors
 and informal links to the techno-
 crats, but under political pressure
 has reportedly tailored some of its
 judgments to what the government
 wants to hear. Headed by Harvard-
 trained economist Bernardo
 Villegas.
 SGV Accounting (SyCip, A financial consulting and account-
 Gorres, and Verrano)                                                                                ing firm; trained Laya, Virata,
 Ongpin, and other technocrats in
 the practicalities of financial man-
 agement. Not an active advocate of
 a particular economic strategy, we
 believe its alumni nonetheless are
 imbued with a bias against multina-
 tional corporations.
 The Makati Business  A loose conglomeration of business
 Club                 interests, including several opposed

 charges of a "crisis of confidence"
 in government. Headed by Enrique
 Ayala-Zobel, an oligarch whose
 wealth predates the Marcos era.

 World Bank. As for the long-term planning pro-
 cess, the National Economic Development Author-
 ity (NEDA), which sets development priorities
 every five years, and Planning Minister Mapa
 function largely as coordinators between the Cen-
 tral Bank and key ministries. The coordination
 process is described by NEDA officials as "consen-
 sus seeking" and nonconfrontational.
 Recent Battles Over Policy
 The most widely reported and controversial contest
 between the technocrats and influential interest
 groups during the past several years has concerned
 the coconut levy-a tax on processed coconut that
 finances a price stabilization scheme. Several fi-
 nancial institutions run by Assemblyman Eduardo
 Cojuangco administer the program, and the scheme
 has financed industrial consolidation under an um-
 brella organization controlled by Cojuangco and
 Defense Minister Juan Ponce-Enrile. Worried by
 Communist insurgent gains in the coconut-growing
 regions in late 1981, Virata persuaded Marcos to
 drop the levy in favor of higher prices for farmers.
 Industrial management later prevailed to have the
 levy reinstated, prompting a threat by Virata to
 resign. In January 1982 he persuaded Marcos to
 "float" the levy on a sliding scale dictated by
 international prices and later in the year succeeded
 in suspending the levy completely when prices fell
 further.
 The traditionally good relationship between the
 government and its international creditors has been
 strained during the last year. Negotiations with the
 IMF for a new standby loan stalemated over
 domestic fiscal policy. Lack of an agreement with
 the Fund was partly responsible for the deteriora-
 tion in the Philippines's international credit rating
 and has held up the second structural adjustment
 loan from the World Bank. In the face of rapidly
 deteriorating external accounts, however, Manila
 early this year capitulated to IMF demands. The
 $304 million Fund credit stipulates a comprehen-
 sive midterm review of exchange rate management,
 foreign borrowing, budgetary performance, and
 efforts to trim the estimated $4 billion-plus short-
 term foreign debt. To ensure Manila complies, the
 release of most of the funds will be held in abey-
 ance pending satisfactory policy.
 Manila's economic policymaking during the 1980s
 will depend critically on the urgency Marcos atta-
 ches to the economic problems and the ensuing
 political fallout. We believe that the economic
 outlook over the next several years is poor and that
 the most formidable tests of Marcos's economic
 decisionmaking system are just beginning. As a
 result, the technocrats probably will continue as
 prominent actors in the policy arena during the
 next several years, and creditors such as the IMF
 probably will continue exercising substantial lever-
 age on Manila's decisions.
 The system will be tested by two long-term prob-
 lems that may turn out to be more serious than the
 slowdown produced by the global recession: demo-
 graphics assure extremely rapid labor force growth
 during the 1980s, and the maturity structure of the
 foreign debt assures continuing balance-of-pay-
 ments strains. Furthermore, the outlook for impor-
 tant agricultural crops is bleak.
 Manila still has basic decisions to make about the
 direction of policy. These concern the choice be-       25X1
 tween keeping inefficient firms afloat with public
 money and a more realistic approach to economic
 policy. No one, including high-level Philippine offi-
 cials, knows how this dilemma will be resolved.

 The technocrats' suggestions have yet to slow the
 momentum to larger government, however. Gov-
 ernment investment in state enterprises, according
 to Philippine data, reached 5 percent of GNP last
 year, up from 3 percent in 1978. At the same time,
 the public sector has significantly expanded its
 holdings of equity in the private sector because of
 the technocrats' financial rescue program. Manila
 thus faces the task in the 1980s of divesting itself of
 inefficient enterprises if expertise provided by gov-
 ernment financial organizations proves insufficient
 to sort out their problems. A more awkward choice
 financially may turn out to be whether to divest the
 public portfolio of sound enterprises, thus resisting
 the trend to state capitalism.
 Marcos's decisionmaking system must also find
 ways to revitalize the deteriorating rural economy,
 which will not be able to capitalize on the full
 effects of recovery in industrialized countries with-
 out substantial restructuring. The shift out of sugar
 and coconut production-a stated objective of gov-
 ernment agricultural experts-promises to be re-
 tarded by vested interests close to the President. A
 rural investment program begun in 1981, the $125
 million National Livelihood Movement sponsored
 by Imelda Marcos, is not sufficient to offset the
 effects of otherwise weak agricultural policy.
 The key indicator of the decisionmaking system's
 ability to deal with economic and financial strains
 during the next several years will be management
 of its single most powerful policy instrument-the
 foreign exchange rate. Rising debt service obliga-
 tions and a weak balance of trade will demand
 more rapid depreciation of the peso than Manila
 has permitted in the past. The country's estimated
 $1.1 billion balance-of-payments deficit for 1982
 and the simultaneous failure of the peso to depreci-
 ate rapidly against currencies other than the US
 Secret
 8 April 1983
 dollar are evidence of vigorous Central Bank de-
 fense of the exchange rate. Failure to allow suffi-
 cient depreciation could produce serious foreign
 debt management problems by rapidly expanding
 imports beyond a sustainable level of financing.
 The IMF has already concluded that the current
 account deficit, at a record 9 percent of GNP in
 1982, was three times the sustainable level.
