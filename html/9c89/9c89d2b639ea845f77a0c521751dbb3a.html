 The Soviet Government's announcement on 30 August of
 its decision to resume nuclear weapons tests reflects Khru-
 shchev's extreme concern that the prospects for extracting
 Western concessions on Berlin have diminished, especially since
 the closure of the Berlin sector border.   The Soviet lead-
 ers appear to recognize  that the') drastic measures to halt
 the refugee flow have heavily damaged their efforts to pre-
 sent the East German regime as a sovereign and respectable
 negotiating partner and that Khrushchev's objective of
 winning Western acceptance of a Berlin settlement implying
 de facto recognition of East Germany has been seriously
 jeopardized.   In this situation,  Khrushchev has resorted
 to nuclear intimidation in an effort to weaken the ability
 of the Western governments to resist Soviet demands.   He
 probably also feels this announcement will place the bloc
 in the strongest possible position to carry out the long-
 threatened unilateral action to sign a separate peace
 treaty with East Germany in the event negotiations fail or
 do not take place;
 East German spokesmen now are denying that Western ci-
 vilian airlines have the legal right to use the Berlin air
 corridors--the only remaining civilian access routes not
 under East German control.   Ulbricht declared on 25 August
 that his regime is abiding by the terms of the notes ex-
 changed by the USSR and ?East Germany on 20 September 1955,
 calling for the USSR to retain control over Western mili-
 tary access to and presence in the city.   On 29 August, how-
 ever, Deputy Foreign Minister Winzer reiterated,  in the
 strongest terms used to date by a bloc spokesman, the Soviet
 position that use of the corridors by Western civilian air-
 craft has no basis in quadripartite agreements relating to
 Berlin and that their use is exclusively for Western garri-
 sons.
 US Mission officials'in Berlin maintain that West Ber-
 liners regard unrestricted air access as an essential

 The sudden resignation of Janio Quadros from the Bra-
 zilian presidency on 25 August precipitated a constitutional
 crisis because of the adamant opposition of War Minister
 Denys and other military leaders to the assumption of Qua-
 dros' power by leftist Vice President Goulart.   Goulart's
 right to succession has been supported on constitutional
 grounds by most political leaders and a minority of the
 military, particularly ex-War Minister Lott and the command-
 er~ of the powerful Third Army in southern Brazil.   On 31
 August congress overwhelmingly passed a resolution to amend
 the constitution, transforming the presidency into a figure-
 head office in a parliamentary form of government with a
 prime minister appointed by congress.   No party in congress
 has a majority, and the premiership might go to such a leader
 as ex-President Kubitschek of the Social Democratic party
 or Governor Carvalho Pinto of the National Democratic Union.

 UN troops have taken action to detain for repatriation
 approximately 500 white officers of Katanga's armed forces.
 Although they were largely successful in this immediate ob-
 jective, Tshombd continues to resist UN pressure to rein-

 The reorganization of the provisional Algerian gov-
 ernment  (PAG),  in which moderate,  pro-Western Ferhat Abbas
 was replaced as premier by Ben Youssef Ben Khedda, reflects
 the rebels' dissatisfaction over the lack of results so
 far in negotiations with France. The new leadership will
 probably increase the PAG's contacts with the Sino-Soviet
 bloc.  Although the rebel announcement of 27 August did
 not close the door to a negotiated settlement, it indicated
 that the PAG stand would be even less compromising than
 heretofore.  De Gaulle, who wants progress toward a solu-
 tion by the end of the year, can be expected to sound out
 the new PAG's position, but if the rebels are unrespon-
 sive or delay too long in resuming negotiations, he may
 proceed with the establishment of a provisional execu-
 tive authority in Algeria without their participation.

 Peiping has been charging that the US is planning
 to provoke clashes with Chinese armed forces in an attempt'
 to demonstrate Chinese bellicosity and aggressiveness
 prior to the coming UN vote on the Chinese representa-
 tion issue.  Whether Peiping's propaganda reflects real
 condern over potential US moves or is intended to cover
 a new military initiative of its own, the Chinese are
 laying the groundwork for blaming any armed clash on the

 CONSTRUCTION SLUMP IN COMMUNIST CHINA   o  .    .    .    ,  ,  .  .  .  .   Page  20
 The slowdown in construction activity first noted in
 China during mid-1960 has continued through the first half
 of 1961, with little chance of a recovery this year.            The
 difficulties stem from the cumulative effects of two suc-
 cessive years of poor harvests, from the excesses of the
 "leap forward," and in lesser degree from the withdrawal
 of Soviet technicians.   This setback in Peiping's con-
 struction effort will adversely affect industrial                                       roduc-
 tion and economic growth over the next few years.

 Yugoslavia's new constitution, intended to formalize
 the "advances" made since 1953, will be presented to par-
 liament this fall and put into effect next spring.   Al-
 though the regime has divulged few details, the daily
 press is beginning to devote more attention to the sig-
 nificance of the document.   Certain provisions will be
 unpopular in government circles, such as one limiting
 elected terms of office.   The Sino-Soviet bloc will prob-
 ably take sharp exception to the new constitution, which
 formalizes certain features of the Yugoslav system which
 the bloc has already attacked.

 with outside African as well as Communist support, are

 ing a strong parliamentary majority.   Santiago and other
 important industrial areas have been put under military
 rule.   The Communists dominate the leadership of Chile's
 over-all labor confederation, which, while it has little
 influence over most individual federations and unions,
 affords a forum for exploiting general labor unrest.
 They also have some strength in Congress and have gained
 some cooperation from right-wing political elements in a
 nationalistic campaign against private foreign invest-
 ment, particularly the US-owned copper companies.

 by the Republican party, called for formation of a center-

 Nenni's Socialists.   The conservative Liberal party has re-

 RECENT TRENDS IN SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  ,  .  .   Page  1
 Although Moscow and Peiping have muted the open po-
 lemics which attracted world attention to the Sino-Soviet
 dispute last year and have managed to act harmoniously in
 most areas of foreign policy since the Moscow conference
 of world Communist leaders last November, the differences
 underlying the dispute remain unresolved.   The USSR's con-
 duct in such crisis situations as Laos, Congo, Cuba, and
 Berlin has not given the Chinese  any pretext for renewing
 their charge that Moscow's attitude toward the West is not
 sufficiently militant.    Sino-Soviet relations in the eco-
 nomic field have been correct but cool thus far in 1961;
 Soviet technicians have not returned to China.   Moscow
 and Peiping continue to maintain conflicting positions on
 the key issue of authority 'within the world Communist
 movement.   The next confrontation may come at the 22nd
 Soviet party congress in October; the congress is to ap-
 prove the Soviet party's new 20-year program, which includes
 elements unacceptable to the Chinese.                                     25X1
 ECONOMIC ISSUES IN THE COMMON MARKET .  .  .  .  .  .  ,  .  .  .    Page 7
 Britain's application for Common Market (EEC) mem-
 bership coincides with preparation by the EEC for an
 early showdown on a number of economic issues of vital
 importance to its future.   Before December, the member
 states must decide whether to double the next tariff re-
 duction and whether to proceed to the second of the EEC's
 three four-year stages.   Linked to these decisions is
 the necessity of reaching prior agreements on certain
 agricultural, transport, social, and anticartel policies
 in which major economic and political interests areinvolved.
 The talks with London, opening in October, may tempt the
 EEC countries to delay on these decisions, but they are
 aware that this would risk the loss     the EEC's present
 momentum.

 WEEKLY REVIEW
 EAST-WEST RELATIONS
 The Soviet Government's 30
 August announcement of its de-
 cision to resume nuclear weap-
 ons tests reflects Khrushchev's
 extreme concern that the pros-
 pects for extracting Western
 concessions on Berlin have di-
 minished, especially since the closure
 of the Berlin sector border.
 The Soviet leaders appear to
 recognize that the drastic meas-
 ures to halt the refugee flow
 have severely damaged their ef-
 forts to present the East German
 regime as a sovereign and re-
 spectable negotiating partner
 and that their objective of win-
 ning Western acceptance of a
 Berlin settlement implying de
 facto recognition of East Ger-
 many has been seriously  jeop-
 ardized
 In this situation, Khru-
 shchev felt obliged to resort
 to nuclear intimidation in an
 effort to weaken the ability of
 the Western governments to re-
 sist Soviet demands.   He prob-
 ably also feels that this an-
 nouncement will place the bloc
 in the strongest possible posi-
 tion to carry out the long-
 threatened unilateral action to
 sign a separate peace treaty with
 East Germany,  in the event nego-
 tiations fail or do not take
 place.
 The Soviet statement linked
 the decision to test "new types
 of nuclear weapons" to other re-
 cenL measures designed  to
 "strengthen the security of the
 USSR."   It attempted to justify
 this move by citing "threats
 and military preparations" by
 the US and other NATO powers
 and asserted that the USSR had
 no choice but to develop the
 "most effective types of weapons
 that can cool hotheads in the
 capitals of some NATO powers."
 The statement condemned
 recent Western "demonstrations
 of strength," particularly US
 and British measures to strength-
 en the West Berlin garrison. It
 also charged that::the US plans
 to resume testing in the near
 future to develop a "neutron
 bomb" and recalled earlier So-
 viet warnings that the USSR
 would be forced to resume tests
 if France did not halt its test-
 ing.
 Moscow's statement seeks
 to counter Western defense meas-
 ures and to generate heavy pub-
 lic pressure on Western govern-
 ments to concede to Soviet de-
 mands by stressing that even a
 localized armed conflict "would
 inevitably grow into a universal
 rocket and nuclear war should
 the nuclear powers be drawn into
 it."
 In the hope of containing
 the damaging impact of this de-
 cision on world opinion, the
 Soviet statement closed with
 the standard pledge that Soviet
 forces "will never be the first
 to resort to arms" and an ap-
 peal for increased efforts
 throughout the world to achieve
 general and complete disarma-
 ment which will put an end to
 nuclear tests.
 Support From Peiping
 Communist China    quickly
 supported    the Soviet decision
 to resume nuclear testing, again
 demonstrating its readiness to
 endorse Soviet policy when it
 takes a militant stand against
 the West.   The Chinese state-
 ment, issued on 31 August, de-
 scribes the Soviet decision as
 a "cooling dose for the hot-
 headed war plotters and a pow-
 erful inspiration to all the

 It blames the US for fanning
 war hysteria and warns the West
 that the entire imperialist sys-
 tem will be swept from the earth
 in the event of a~:nuclear war.
 Free-World Reaction
 The Soviet decision will
 shock most of the leaders at-
 tending the nonaligned summit
 in Belgrade and will add a
 sobering note to their already
 scheduled debate on the subject
 of nuclear testing.   India's
 Nehru, reflecting the view of
 most of his fellow conferees,
 stated, on his arrival in Bel-
 grade,  "I am against all nu-
 clear tests--any time, any
 place, all the time."
 The Geneva deadlock on the
 testing question must have con-
 vinced others too that a test
 resumption by one side or the
 other was just a matter of time.
 They are likely to be critical--
 at least in private-.-of :the 'So-
 viet Union's decision and will
 probably go on record with a
 vigorous plea for renewed ef-
 forts to restore the test ban.
 At the same time, assuming that
 Western testing will also be
 resumed,  the._nonaligned lead-
 ers are also likely to resort,
 in their deliberations, to
 their more familiar "plague on
 both your houses" pose.
 Echoing the allegations
 contained in the Soviet note
 that the Western powers are con-
 niving in the use of the Berlin
 air corridors by West German
 "revanchists" and "militarists,"
 Deputy Foreign Minister Winzer
 on 29 August spelled out, in the
 strongest terms bloc spokes-
 men have used to date, the So-
 viet position that "the profit-
 able business of American, Brit-
 ish, and French airlines in the
 air corridors is illegal."  He
 asserted that "there is no single
 agreement in which the Western
 powers were granted the right
 to use the air corridors for
 civilian flights."
 Winzer termed "complete
 falsification" Western claims
 that the exchange of letters
 between president Truman and
 Stalin on 14 and 18 June 1945

 the Soviet note of 23 August,
 the brunt of East German prop-

 increase the sense of isolation

 softening them up to support

 East German news agency warned
 that the plan to hold a Home-

 West Berlin from 1 to 3 Septem-
 ber was a "provocation directed
 against the entire socialist

 Last year's Homeland Day--
 celebrations by expellee groups
 from former German territories
 in Poland and Czechoslovakia--
 furnished the excuse for East
 German interference with West
 German ground access to Berlin
 and for other measures to under-
 cut the ties between West Berlin
 and Bonn.   More than 1,000 per-
 sons planning to attend the rally
 at that time were turned back
 by East German police at the
 East - West German frontier, but
 some 700 persons were flown in
 by Western civilian airlines
 without incident despite Com-
 munist warnings that use of the
 air corridors for such purposes
 would not be permitted.   This
 year, 100 to 150 West Germans

 to the city--would probably be
 accompanied by steps on the part
 of the East Germans to interfere
 with ground access by West Ger-
 mans':to the city.   Further moves
 to maintain pressure on the city
 --such as publication of the
 text of a peace treaty--may al-
 so be made in the near future.
 Situation in Berlin
 The East Germans meanwhile
 have somewhat reduced their
 military and security forces
 in East Berlin but are still
 maintaining a substantial show
 of force. Tanks have been with-
 drawn two or three blocks from
 the sector border, where they
 are parked in groups of 4 to
 10.   East German police have
 several times used tear gas or
 riot hoses to disperse crowds
 of West Berliners gathered in
 the city sector border area.
 There have been several minor
 brushes between Allied military
 personnel patrolling in East
 Berlin and East German security
 forces.   Aside from this,  West-
 ern personnel are continuing to
 enter the Soviet sector, general-
 ly without difficulty,  through
 the only checkpoint open to them
 --at Friedrichstrasse.
 Soviet reconnaissance vehi-
 cles now are appearing in great-
 er numbers in West Berlin than
 in the past,  evidently in an
 effort to underline the USSR's
 claim to a role in the occupa-
 tion of the Western sectors.
 Soviet controllers at BASC,  how-
 ever,  have protested the assign-
 ment of US Army vehicles to es-
 cort them to and from the sector
 border.   This Western action was
 taken after West Berliners had
 demonstrated against the Soviets.
 US Mission officials in Ber-
 lin believe that the Soviet note
 of 23 August has caused further
 apprehension among West Berlin-
 31 Aug 61
 ers, who regard unrestricted
 air access as an essential ele-
 ment of their freedom.   Mayor
 Brandt and other leaders of the
 Social Democratic party (SPD)
 believe that despite the tem-
 porary improvement of morale
 resulting from the visit of
 Vice President Johnson and
 reinforcement of the Berlin
 garrison, a feeling of frustra-
 tion and hopelessness is al-
 ready beginning to spread
 through the West Berlin popula-
 tion.
 The West Berlin leaders
 told a US official there is a
 growing public expectation that,
 despite Allied assurances, a
 compromise will be reabhed be-
 tween the Allies and the USSR
 concerning the future status of
 West Berlin which will inevita-
 bly act to undermine the long-
 range viability of the city.
 These leaders claimed that fur-
 ther blows at the Western posi-
 tion--such as Communist inter-
 ference with civilian air ac-
 cess, which they fear the Al-
 lies will be unable to prevent--
 will cause many Berliners to
 leave the city permanently for
 West Germany.
 On 24 August West Berlin
 police closed and sealed the
 thirteen West Berlin offices
 of the East German Socialist
 Unity party  (SED)  in retalia-
 tion for the closing of the
 eight SPD offices in East Ber-
 lin.   West Berlin officials re-
 fused to permit the opening of
 two East German "tourist of-
 fices" at the Zoo and West Kreuz
 stations of the elevated rail-
 way (S-Bahn), and instructed
 West Berlin police to obstruct
 attempts td use the stations to
 issue permits for West Berliners
 to visit East Berlin.   The East
 German regime had announced on
 22 August that passes for enter-
 ing East Berlin would be issued
 at such offices.

 Situation in East Germany
 .The Ulbricht regime is
 steadily hardening its attitude
 toward antiregime elements in
 East Germany.   On26 August
 Neues Deutschlaid published a
 decree ;,under whieh."in special cases,
 on the basis of a judicial:'s-entente or
 at the request of, lotcal. government or-
 gans, restrictions on residence
 can be pronounced." This pro-
 vides a legal basis for removing
 suspected antiregime elements
 from restricted areas along the
 East - West German frontier or
 from the outskirts of Berlin.
 It also will enable the regime
 to resettle East Germans and
 East Berliners who formerly
 worked in West Berlin in dis-
 tricts where their labor is
 needed.  Persons removed from
 frontier areas may be subjected
 to "educational labor." Another
 decree authorizes district and
 town officials to declare local
 "states of emergency" in order
 to impress laborers for the 1961
 harvest.   Further measures to
 tighten up work norms in indus-
 trial plants may be in store.
 The regime has tightened
 security along the East - West
 .German frontier over the past
 three weeks.
 Military Developments
 No significant change oc-
 curred in either the Soviet or
 East German military situation
 in the Berlin area during the
 past week.   There was some evi-
 dence,of the presence of Soviet
 and perhaps East German ele-
 ments in the Letzlinger Heide
 training area on 24 August.
 There are also indications of
 increased tactical reconnais-
 sance at various points near
 the East - West German border.
 The announcement that the
 active duty tours of Soviet mil-
 itary personnel are being ex-
 tended appears merely to formal-
 ize a decision taken some time
 ago. The long-term effect of
 31 Aug 61
 this will depend on the. future
 rate of induction, but a net in-
 crca.se~'iitx 'Soviet military man-
 power is to be expected.
 Bloc Gestures Toward West
 Khrushchev, before Mos-
 cow's statement on nuclear
 testing, continued last week
 to reassure the West of his in-
 terest in arranging negotiations
 on Germany and Berlin.   In an
 interview on 24 August with
 columnist Drew Pearson, he pre-
 sented a written statement, which
 Moscow published on 28 August.
 The most significant aspect of
 this pronouncement was Khrushchev's
 reference to his readiness to meet
 "at any moment with leaders
 of"the Western powers" and to
 come to a "round table for peace-
 ful negotiations" if the Western
 powers--"notably President Ken-
 nedy"--want a "peaceful settle-
 ment." Khrushchev's designation of
 Western. leaders as the partici-
 pants and his special reference to
 the President suggest that he has
 a summit-level meeting in mind,
 or possibly bilateral discussions
 with Washington.
 Rumanian Premier and party
 First Secretary Gheorghiu-Dej
 last week told an American Em-
 bassy official that be plans
 to visit New York this fall.
 This was apparently a hint that
 he might attend the opening of
 the UN General Assembly on 19
 .September.   Since he probably
 would not attend unless other
 bloc leaders came, as was the
 case last fall, the Rumanian
 leader's remark may have been
 intended as a trial balloon to
 determine U$ reaction to a pos-
 sible visit by Khrushchev.  Mos-
 cow would probably assume that
 Khrushchev's presence at the
 UN would lead to a meeting with
 President Kennedy and provide
 an. opportunity to arrange sub-
 sequent four-power negotiations.
 Gheorghiu-Dej stressed in his
 private: remarks that Moscow was
 'entirely flexible"  in  its
 approach to negotiations and
 that a solution could be reached
 which would protect the prestige
 of both sides.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 According to press accounts,
 Khrushchev confirmed his pre-
 vious statements during Fanfani's
 visit to Moscow that the USSR"
 was prepared to negotiate with
 the Western powers on Berlin
 and Germany.
 While the bloc may hope
 to sustain the momentum of re-
 cent East German actions and
 continue to tighten controls in
 Berlin, the Soviets have made a
 point of stating that Western
 interests have not been touched.
 Colonel Solovyev, the Soviet
 commandant in Berlin, adopted
 a friendly tone in his dis-
 cussion with General Watson
 on 26 August, stating that he
 had taken an interest in the
 matter of free passage of US
 personnel into East Berlin and
 had been "informed" that there
 were no obstacles.
 Ulbricht's reaffirmation
 of the validity of the Bolz-
 Zorin letters and Winzer's
 subsequent remarks indicate that
 Allied air access will not be
 affected prior to the signature
 of a peace treaty.   In addition,
 the Soviet Embassy in Bonn has
 issued a statement that the USSR
 is "in favor of normal communi-
 cations" between West Berlin and
 the Federal Republic.   This was
 apparently intended to soften
 the earlier remark by Ambassador
 Smirnov to an American audience
 in Bonn that the "best solution"
 for the Berlin air corridor
 problem would be to transfer
 all civilian flights from
 Tempelhof and Tegel airfields
 in West Berlin to Schoenefeld
 on the outskirts of East Berlin,
 West German Position
 Last September, Bonn,
 citing the interference with the
 refugee meeting and an East
 German decree of that month
 imposing controls on West Ger-
 man access to East Berlin, served
 notice that it would not extend
 the interzonal trade agreement
 expiring in December."  The
 agreement was renewed only after
 East Germany gave assurances of
 free movement for all persons and
 goods to and within Berlin.
 Bonn now would consider any
 interference with West German
 access to Berlin a violation of
 these guarantees.   Chancellor
 Adenauer warned in a speech on
 14 August that Bonn was con-
 sidering cancellation of its
 interzonal trade agreement with
 East Germany and that there
 would be a complete trade em-
 bargo of the Communist bloc if
 the Berlin issue could not be
 settled.   The East Germans
 answered Adenauer by threaten-
 ing on 15 August to cut off
 West German freight traffic to
 West Berlin if Bonn interrupted
 interzonal trading, and Adenauer
 warned again the following day
 of economic sanctions "in the
 case of a  (future) move against
 Berlin."
 Although West German offi-
 cials regard the intensified
 controls imposed by the East
 Germans in Berlin as a violation
 of the assurances of freedom
 of movement given last December,
 Bonn remains undecided on what
 to do about it.   For the time
 being it does not plan to author-
 ize its interzonal trade rep-
 resentative to take up the matter
 with his East German counterpart.
 Fritz Berg, president of the
 West German Federation of In-
 dustries (BDI), stated on 22 Au-
 gust his organization believes can-
 cellation of the interzonal trade
 pact now would be dangerous to Ber-
 lin's security.   He said,  however,
 that West German firms were giving
 over-all support to the BDI-recom-
 mended boycott of the East German
 Leipzig Fair,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The sudden resignation of
 Janio Quadros from the Brazilian
 presidency on 25 August has pre-
 cipitated a constitutional cri-
 sis because of the adamant op-
 position of War Minister Denys
 and other military leaders to
 the assumption. of Quadros' power
 by leftist Vice President Joao
 Goulart.   Goulart's right to
 succession has been supported
 on constitutional grounds by
 most political leaders and a
 minority of the military, partic-
 ularly?former War Minister Lott
 and the commander of the power-
 ful Third Army in southern Bra-
 zil.               On 31 August, Congress
 overwhelmingly passed a reso-
 lution to amend the constitu-
 tion, transforming the presi-
 dency into a figurehead office
 tinder a parliamentary form of
 government with a prime minister
 appointed by congress.
 Quadros' resignation fol-
 lowed a period of growing ten-
 sion with the military over his
 policy of closer relations with
 bloc countries, and an outburst
 of public criticism for having
 given Brazil's highest decora-
 tion to Che Guevara.   The pre-
 cise mot1vations of his impul-
 sive resignation are, however,
 still unclear.   If he was count-
 ing on being swept back quickly
 into the presidency by a wave of
 public protest, he greatly mis-
 judged public opinion.   There
 were a number of initial expres-
 sions of dismay, but the wide-
 spread subsequent reaction was
 criticism of Quadros for acting
 irresponsibly in the face of
 admitted difficulties.   A state-
 ment reportedly made by his ex-
 justice minister as Quadros
 sailed for Europe on 30 August
 suggested that Quadros plans an
 effort to swing public opinion
 in his favor by attributing his
 resignation to US pressure.
 Such a statement might touch
 off anti-US demonstrations on a
 larger scale than those immedi-
 ately following his resignation.
 Goulart's Career
 The 43-year-old "Jango"
 Goulart comes from a well-to-do
 background in the state of Rio
 Grande do Sul, of which his
 brother-in-law,  Leonel Brizola,
 is currently governor.   From
 the beginning of his national
 political career in 1950, Gou-
 lart was a protege of President
 Vargas and was generally regarded
 as his political heir when Vargas
 committed suicide in August 1954.
 Goulart had tried particularly
 to build up labor support for
 himself, cooperating in a number
 of ways with the Communists for
 this purpose.   Military resent-
 ment of his leftist views and
 varied activities as minister
 of labor had caused his forced
 resignation from Vargas' cabi-
 net in February 1954.
 Supported by his own Brazil-
 ian Labor party and several oth-
 ers, and accepted as running mate
 by the popular Kubitschek,Gou-
 lart won the vice presidency in
 the 1955 election and further
 strengthened his political or-
 ganization during Kubitschek's
 presidency.   In the 1960 elec-
 tion both he and his presiden-
 tial running mate, ex-War Minister

 Lott, received Communist en-
 dorsement.   He defeated Quadros'
 running'mate by a considerably
 smaller margin than Quadros'
 edge over Lott.
 Quadros as president tended
 to keep Goulart at arm's length
 Politically but sent him to the
 USSR and Communist China a few
 weeks ago; on an official visit.
 During his Chinese visit, Gou-
 lart went out of his way to
 praise the successes of Mao Tse-
 tung and the Chinese Communists.
 While in Peiping he completed
 a pact, caflIthg, for, trade-o.f
 $28,000,000 each way annually.
 Concern for Constitutionality
 The reaction of Denys and
 the two other service ministers
 to the prospect of Goulart's
 wielding Quadros' powers was
 a natural consequence of Gou-
 lart'$ past career and general
 reputation as a political oppor-
 tunist, as well as the growing
 concern in Brazilian military
 circles over Quadros' policy
 on closer relations with the
 Communist bloc.   Much of the
 support as Goulart has received
 since Quadros' resignation must
 be attributed not to his per-
 sonal political appeal, but to
 the general feeling--much strong-
 er in Brazil than in most Latin
 American countries--that con-
 stitutionality should be re-
 spected in times of crisis.
 Military leaders first
 sought a legal solution where-
 by Congress would amend the con-
 stitution to bar Goulart from
 office and provide for an
 acceptable successor.   A con-
 stitutional amendment can be
 proposed by one fourth of
 either chamber and becomes
 law if passed in two successive
 votes, by two thirds of the to-
 tal membership of each house of
 Congress.   Congressmen apparent-
 ly felt, however, that barring
 Goulart would offend the popu-
 lar Brazilian feeling for legal-
 ity.
 Moreover,  the Brazilian
 constitution provides that if
 both the presidency and the vice
 presidency should be vacated
 during the first half of a presi-
 dential term, elections must be
 held within 60 days.   While such
 elections would normally appeal
 to many of Brazil's political
 leaders, most of the ambitious
 men with a good chance at the
 top post now hold posts which
 would bar them from becoming
 presidential candidates within
 the next several months.   Con-
 stitutional provisions bar from
 candidacy those who have been gov-
 ernors or cabinet ministers with-
 in six months of the election,
 as well as "a President who may
 have exercised the office for any
 time in the term immediately
 preceding."'
 Reactions Abroad
 Latin American public re-
 action to Quadros' resignation
 has reflected almost universal
 surprise,  accompanied by a number
 of parallels drawn by the press
 between this event and President
 Vargas' suicide in 1954.   Except
 from Cuba, there has thus far been
 little commentary on the question
 of the presidential succession.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Ecuadorean President Velasco
 who has faced growing moderate-
 rightist opposition to his pro-
 Castro, leftist foreign policy in
 recent weeks,: including some
 military plotting against his
 regime, is reportedly alarmed by
 Quadros' action and fears that
 similar circumstances in Ecuador
 might force him out of office.
 The intelligence chief of the
 Ecuadorean armed forces advised
 the American army attache in Quito
 on 28 August that Brazilian devel-
 opments could have a pronounced
 effect  in Ecuador because of the
 analogous political-military re-
 lations in the two. countries.
 The.Argentine Government, which
 recently confronted sharply
 adverse reactions from its
 military leaders when Cuba's
 economic czar Che Guevara
 visited President Frondizi
 immediately after his visit
 with Quadros in Brazil, has
 maintained a cautious reserve
 on the Brazilian situation.
 One official characterized
 Quadros' retirement and its
 aftermath as primarily an
 internal Brazilian affair.
 The Mexican Government, which
 along with Ecuador and Brazil
 has followed policies favorable
 to the Castro regime, has
 limited its comments on Bra-
 zilian developments to vague
 generalities.
 The Castro regime has
 attributed Quadros' resigna-
 tion to pressures from the US
 and branded it as part of the
 US "imperialist" plot to en-
 circle and:isolate Cuba.  The
 Cuban reaction reflects con-
 siderable concern over the loss
 of one of its principal friends
 in the hemisphere.   In a public
 address  on 29  August,   Castro
 urged the Brazilian-people to
 "take up arms ...and take to the
 mountains and jungles" to fight
 the military leaders who are
 trying to keep Vice President
 Goulart from becoming president.
 T4e Brazilian Communist party,
 which has often collaborated    25X1
 with Goulart, has generally
 kept in the back round during the
 past few days
 Both Moscow and Peiping,
 following a line similar to that
 of Cuba, have placed the responsi-
 bility for the Brazilian situation
 on "imperialist" US machinations
 designed to oust a statesman who
 was attempting to free his coun-
 try from the US "monopolistic"
 and "colonialist" yoke, and have
 also denounced the efforts of
 "reactionary" elements to block'
 Goulart.
 Local Situation

 tion in Brazil are still fluid
 and confused.  Denys on 30 August

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 UN troops over the past
 week detained for repatriation
 approximately 500 Europeans,
 most of them Belgians serving
 in the Katangan armed forces.
 The evacuation of mercenaries
 is part of a stepped-up UN
 campaign to force Tshomb6 to
 drop his claims of Katangan
 independence and to enter into
 negotiations with Premier Adoula
 aimed at reintegrating Katanga
 with the Congo.
 The UN move began on 25
 August with the airlifting of
 a battalion of Indian troops
 from northern Katanga to Elisa-
 bethville.   The airlift immedi-
 ately triggered rumors that the
 UN, in support of Adoula, would
 attempt to disarm Katanga's
 10,000-man army and 3,000-odd
 police.   On 26 August, UN repre-
 sentative O'Brien delivered a
 virtual ultimatum to Tshomb6,
 warning that if he did not go
 to Leopoldville the "situation
 would worsen," and emphasizing
 that the UN was prepared to
 assist Adoula in military action
 against Katanga.   Tshomb6 re-
 plied that he would not negoti-
 ate with Leopoldville under
 pressure.
 In a swift predawn maneu-
 ver on 28 August,                     Indian troops
 seized key points in Elisabeth-
 ville and began the roundup of
 Belgians.   Although Tshomb6
 announced that he accepted the
 UN action and urged the popu-
 lace to remain calm, the UN
 placed Ir}terior Minister Munongo
 under detention, apparently as
 a precautionary measure.   On 29
 August the UN announced that
 most of the 500 white officers
 of TshombO's army were "controlled"
 by the UN,  and O'Brien observed,
 "Katanga is in secession without
 the means of maintaining it."
 Tshomb6 replied on 29 Au-
 gust that he had toured military
 camps in the past 24 hours and
 that "the army will not mutiny."
 A major disciplinary breakdown,
 however, might well lead to the
 collapse of his government.
 Even prior to the UN roundup
 there were periodic reflections
 of poor discipline and morale in
 army camps near Elisabethville.
 The Belgian consul general has
 stated that, as early as 28 Au-
 gust, there were several "inci-
 dents" between African soldiers
 and whites.
 Belgian Foreign Minister
 Spaak has sent Secretary General
 Hammarskjold an "energetic" pro-
 test over the UN measures against
 Belgian officers in Katanga.   Ini-
 tially he had indicated that his
 government would continue to co-
 operate with the UN and would
 remove Belgian officers from
 Katanga,  provided such measures
 did not lead either to a panicky
 exodus of the European population
 or to ,a mutiny of the Katangan
 armed forces.   However, the dras-
 tic action of the UN in taking
 Belgian officers into custody
 prompted the protest move.   Spaak
 fears that large-scale humiliation
 of Belgian nationals would be
 exploited to the fullest by his
 right-wing critics at home.
 In the Congo proper,  atten-
 tion has centered on the uncer-
 tain relationship between Adoula
 and Gizenga and on maneuverings

 Gizenga is believed to favor

 the meantime, he has refused
 to go to Leopoldville to take
 up his vice premiership.
 A fifth Air Jordan charter
 flight to Stanleyville arrived
 on 26 August, reportedly carry-

 occasions, however, the cargo
 was inspected by UN officials.
 When a US consul attempted to
 contact the plane's American
 pilot, he was threatened at
 the airport by Gizengist sol-
 diers, who apparently blamed
 him for the UN's detention of
 the aircraft. The consul was
 placed under UN protection, and
 subsequently returned to Leopold-

 from Stanleyville on Gizengass
 orders.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 FRANCE-ALGERIA
 The reorganization of the
 provisional Algerian government
 (PAG) announced on 27 August,  in
 which moderate pro-Western
 premier Ferhat Abbas was re
 placed by 51-year-old Ben
 Youssef Ben Khedda, reflects
 dissatisfaction over the failure
 of negotiations with France.
 The new leadership will probably
 be even less compromising than
 the former PAG regime ;  its
 composition is in effect a re-
 tort to French efforts to break
 the deadlocknin negotiations by
 threats to set up a provisional
 Algerian executive or to pares'.
 tition the country.   The new
 leadership will probably renew
 threats, soft-pedaled during
 the preparation for negotia4
 tions, to obtain increased
 diplomatic and material support
 from the Sino-Soviet bloc and
 to "internationalize" the
 Algerian war,
 Ben Khedda is regarded as
 one of the more extreme Algerian
 revolutionaries, although his
 name is less well known among
 the Algerian masses than that
 of Abbas.   He was instrumental
 in organizing the rebel fight-
 ing units within Algeria, where
 he several times narrowly a-
 voided death or capture, and
 has a solid reputation among
 the younger members of the rebel
 army.   His resignation as PAG
 minister of social affairs in
 January 1960 was apparently
 in protest against what he con-
 sidered the PAG's failure to
 push a more vigorous  ;guar
 r:Illa  war;; against ;the
 French and to move the PAG head-
 quarters from Tunis into Algeria.
 He has had a number of contacts
 with bloc nations, especially
 Communist China, and is reported
 to be an admirer of Communist
 organization and an advocate of
 Mao Tse-tung's theory of guerrilla
 warfare.  Ben Khedda is regarded
 as intelligent, shrewd, "hard
 as nails," and extremely able.
 The 62-year-old Abbas, a
 rebel elder statesman, had been
 premier since the PAG was es-
 tablished in 1958,but his in,
 fluence was limited by his
 French cultural background.   His
 popularity within Algeria--
 which appears to have increased
 since the riots last December--
 along with his wide acquaintances
 and acceptability to the French
 made him useful inrestablish?ing
 an.; aura:,, of respectability for,
 the PAG, which may seek to
 utilize these traits in some
 other assignment.
 In other changes, Ben Khedda
 also took over the Ministry of
 Finance, replacing Ahmed Francis,
 Abbas' brother-in-law, who per-
 formed effectively but shared
 Abbas' moderate views.  Another
 moderate, Abdelhamid Mehri, was
 dropped as minister of social and
 cultural affairs, reportedly
 because he had done almost
 nothing with his ministry. Said
 Mohammedi, frequently identified
 as a supporter of Belkacem Krim,
 was removed as minister of state,
 and another vice premier--Mom
 hamed Boudiaf--was added to the
 previous two, Krim and Mohamed
 Ben Bella.  Both Boudiaf and
 Ben Bella are detained in France.
 Krim was shifted from minister
 of foreign affairs to minister
 of interior, replacing "hard-
 liner" Lakhdar Ben Tobbal, who
 was made a minister of state

 without portfoli o. Saad Dahlab,
 formerly under Krim in  the
 Foreign Ministry and a mbmber
 of the PAG negotiating team,
 was moved up to foreign minister.
 Krim and Ben Tobbal appear
 to have suffered demotions, which
 suggests that minister of arma-
 ments Abdelbafid Boussouf, a
 ruthless "hard-liner" reported-
 ly feared by most of the rebel
 leadership, may have enhanced
 his already strong position.
 He has for some time reportedly
 been working to undercut both
 Krim and Ben Tobbal.
 The PAG communique announc-
 ing the changes was careful to
 leave the door open for a re-
 sumption of negotiations with
 the French, although indicating
 that the rebels would take an
 even less compromising stand,
 especially in their demand for
 control of the Sahara.  The
 replacement of Krim as foreign
 minister by Dahlab, whom the
 French consider more able and
 sophisticated than Krim, could
 be an effort to provide the FAG
 negotiating team with a spokes-
 man linguistically and politi-
 cally more able to cope with
 the French delegation. Reports
 indicate that contacts with
 the French are being maintained.
 De Gaulle's press confer-
 ence scheduled for 5 September
 will probably elaborate on his
 reported statement to the French
 cabinet on 30 August that the
 new PAG line-up does not alter
 France's determination to give
 Algeria its independence as
 soon as possible.  The French
 press is interpreting  the
 situation according to the pro-
 or anti - De Gaulle alignment
 of individual editors. Rightist
 papers call it a defeat for his
 policy of negotiating with the
 rebels, but some others profess
 to see prospects for a more
 realistic rebel negotiating team.
 negotiations, he may proceed
 with establishment of a pro-
 visional executive authority in
 Algeria without rebel partici-
 pation.  This would be aimed
 at arranging an early referendum
 which could form the basis for
 any later moves to regroup or
 partition.   Meanwhile, the chief
 straws in the wind are seen in
 the French cabinet reshuffle
 on 24 August, in which a secre-
 tary of state for repatriates
 was created and the former Min-
 istry of the Sahara was down-
 graded to the status of a secre-
 taryship. Secretary for Repatri-
 ates Boulin has already announced
 that when parliament reconvenes,
 the government will propose a
 "framework law" involving large
 credits for repatriates.
 The American Embassy in
 Paris,  in an assessment of De
 Gaulle's over-all position last
 week, commented that none of the
 chief opponents of his Algerian
 policy--the Algerian rebels,
 the army and European settlers
 in Algeria, and rightists in
 metropolitan France--bad yet
 been won over to it; the embassy
 pinpointed the army as still
 the key element with which be
 must reckon as he continues press-
 ing toward an early solution.
 In this regard, the absence
 from recent Defense Committee
 meetings of the chief of staff
 for National Defense, General
 Jean Olie, has been linked to
 reports that he has disagreed
 with De Gaulle over Algerian
 policy.
 Should
 Olie resign or be rel eyed soon
 for any cause, De Gaulle would
 probably have difficulty replac-
 ing him with another senior
 officer both loyal to himself
 and acceptable to the army.
 In view of De Gaulle's de-
 sire to have a solution under
 way by the end of the year, Paris
 can be expected to sound out the
 new PAG, regardless of the un-
 compromising posture of the
 new leadership.   If the PAG is
 unresponsive, however, or if
 it delays too long in resuming

 The Soviet delegates at
 Geneva have referred to the
 drafting committee a number of
 controversial items over which
 the US delegation had expected
 more lengthy argument.  There
 has been no indication, how-
 ever, that the bloc will make
 any substantive concession on
 the basic issue of whether or
 not the International Control
 Commission (ICC) is to be given
 sufficient power to accomplish
 its mission.   Moscow's attempt
 to appear reasonable on the
 matter of controls may be an
 effort to encourage the West to
 exercise a greater restraint on
 General Phoumi and any inde-
 pendent military action the
 Vientiane leader may have in
 mind.   The USSR probably also
 feels that its flexible attitude
 at this time will make it more
 difficult for the West to refuse
 agreement on other matters of
 concern to the bloc; e.g., re-
 tention of Pathet Lao forces
 until elections are held.
 The opposing factions in
 Laos still seem far apart.
 Souvanna Phouma, in an inter-
 view on 27 August with French
 Ambassador Falaize, proposed
 a list of seven individuals who,
 with himself, should constitute
 the "neutralist" center of any
 new government. The list in-
 cluded the extreme  leftist
 Quinim Pholsena, the opportun-
 istic Pheng Phongsavan, and five
 relative nonentities.  There is
 some possibility that this list
 represents Souvanna's initial
 bargaining position, and that
 when and if serious negotiations
 begin on composition of a new
 government, he may be willing
 to consider substitutions drawn
 from stronger and abler moder-
 ates now giving nominal support
 to the Boun Oum government.
 Phoumi, meanwhile, is be-
 coming increasingly more open
 in his expressions of distaste
 for Souvanna and disinclination
 to serve under him in a coali-
 tion government.   He reiter-
 ated to Ambassador Brown re-
 cently that the Vientiane gov-
 ernment had just about decided
 Souvanna would be unacceptable
 as premier, since it was felt
 a government under him would
 simply be an instrument of the
 Patbet Lao.
 The divergence of views
 among the opposing factions is
 reflected in the continuing
 impasse in the Namone talks on
 formation of a government and
 negotiation of a detailed cease-
 fire instrument.  The question
 of who should be premier has
 been bypassed for future nego-
 tiations, in view of the ir-
 reconcilability of the gov-
 ernment's position--that the
 King should have some freedom
 of choice in naming a premier
 --with the insistence of the
 Pathet Lao and the Souvanna
 group that only Souvanna's name
 should be submitted.
 There has been a slow but
 steady  increase in the number
 of incidents between the oppos-
 ing military  forces,   which
 continue to prepare for the
 possible resumption of hostil-
 ities.                                                                     Phoumi over the week
 end went to Hue for talks with
 South Vietnamese military lead-
 ers.  The South Vietnamese
 authorities are said  to have
 promised to make  available
 immediately to Phoumi an infan-
 try regiment and a 105-mm. ar-
 tillery battery to help defend
 central  and  southern Laos.
 These troops would ostensibly
 be incorporated into the Laotian
 Army.  South Vietnam promised
 to reconsider Phoumi's request
 for a whole light infantry di-
 vision in January 1962

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Cuban Minister of Industry
 Che Guevara, on his return from
 the inter-American economic con-
 ference in Uruguay, asserted
 that the US failed to achieve
 its major objective there, that
 of "providing the advance pay-
 ment for support against Cuba."
 The conference, he concluded,
 eliminated the possibility of
 isolating Cuba."  Colombian
 Foreign Minister Turbay, a
 leader in Latin American con-
 sultations looking toward col-
 lective action to isolate the
 Castro regime, told the American
 ambassador in Bogota on 25 Au"
 gust that he is sounding out
 other.. Latin American  governments
 to ascertain if there has been
 any "chipping away of resolve"
 for action against Castro.
 President Dorticos left
 Cuba on 29 August  as head of
 an 18--man delegation to the
 conference of nonaligned nations
 in Belgrade.   After that meeting
 he is scheduled to make state
 visits to the USSR, Czechoslo-
 vakia, and Communist China.
 The regime's concern over
 growing shortages and economic
 dislocations was reflected in
 the three-day "National Produc-
 tiori Conference'! which opened
 in Havana on 26 August.   The
 meetings were billed as sessions
 of "criticism and self-criticism"
 to correct the difficulties
 hampering the economy.   Guevara
 delivered a characteristically
 frank address, admitting that
 "acute" shortages of spare
 parts have "adversely affected"
 production.    He called for more
 coordination among the minis-
 31 Aug 61
 tries and criticized his own min-
 istry for "too much bureaucracy."
 Guevara also criticized
 waste in the armed forces
 and "the tendency to keep
 some of the militia under arms
 when they would be more use-
 ful in production," an issue
 which on at least one previous
 occasion had led to disagree-
 ment with Fidel Castro.   Castro
 responded with a "clarifica-
 tion,'' explaining that the
 "constant threat of armed
 agg ression'' requires the
 mobilization of the people.
 He agreed, however, that "the
 military should take into ac-
 count the problems of produc-
 tion."
 The decree convening the
 "production conference" was
 the first to be signed jointly
 by the government and the
 national directorate of the
 Integrated Revolutionary
 Organization (ORI), the Com-
 munist-led mass "political
 party" being organized through-
 out the country.   The ORI thus
 appears already to be evolv-
 ing toward a relationship with
 the state. comparable to that
 of Communist parties in the
 bloc.

 an increase of about 15 percent
 over 1960.
 The USSR supplied about 85
 percent of the bloc's oil ex-
 ports in 1960, Rumania most of
 the remainder.   The ability of
 the USSR to expand production
 suggests it will continue both
 to meet domestic demand and to
 increase exports--particularly
 of crude oil--to the free world.
 By 1965, the bloc may have as
 much as 50,000,000 tons avail-
 able for export annually--twice
 the amount shipped to the free
 world in 1960.
 The composition of bloc
 POL exports continues to reflect
 the relative increase in the
 supply of crude oil over refined
 petroleum products, in keeping
 with the demands of the free
 world oil markets.   In 1960,
 crude oil accounted for more
 than 40 percent of the bloc's
 exports; this year the figure
 should reach 50 percent.

 Bloc oil is exported to
 about 30 free world countries.

 Burma, Turkey, and Spain were
 added to the list this year.
 European countries, mainly mem-
 bers of NATO, take more than
 three quarters of all bloc pe-
 troleum exports.  Only in Fin-
 land, Iceland, and Greece, how-
 ever, do these imports account
 for a significant amount of do-
 mestic consumption.   Bloc oil
 sales to the industrial countries
 of Western Europe and to Japan--
 about $360,000,000 in 1960--
 are used primarily to finance
 purchases of capital goods and
 equipment required for the ful-
 fillment of Moscow's seven-year
 economic development plan.
 The bulk of bloc petroleum
 exports to underdeveloped coun-
 tries goes to Cuba and the UAR.
 Since mid-1960, the bloc has
 been the sole source of Cuban
 imports of POL, with about
 4,500,000 tons scheduled for
 delivery this year.
 Recent reports concerning
 difficulties in the distribution
 of Soviet petroleum products to
 several widely separated areas
 apparently reflect internal So-
 viet transportation problems,
 caused chiefly by a shortage of
 tank cars.   In addition, the
 oil supply difficulties probably
 were aggravated by the demands

 PEIPING ALLEGES US TRYING TO PROVOKE ARMED CLASHES
 The Chinese Communists have
 expanded their routine propaganda
 blasts against American "provo-
 cations" during the past two
 weeks into a concert of charges
 that the US is engaged in an in-
 tensive military build-up in
 the Far East and that it
 hopes prior to the UN vote on
 the Chinese representation
 issue to provoke Peiping into
 armed clashes in an effort to
 demonstrate Chinese bellicosity
 and aggressiveness.   In its
 charges, Peiping has taken
 particular note of alleged US
 military deployments in the
 Taiwan Strait.   American press
 reports that the strengthening
 of US forces in the area is
 designed to counter any Com-
 munist plans for a diversionary
 venture in connection with the
 Berlin crisis have been labeled
 "fantastic" by Peiping, which
 calls instead for "vigilance
 against the US plot."
 The Chinese could well have
 anticipated some stiffening of
 American forces in the area in
 the wake of the Berlin crisis,
 and their current propaganda
 campaign may be an effort to
 capitalize on the US action in
 such a manner as to add consider-
 able new "evidence" to their
 line that the US is engaged
 in "aggression" against them.
 Peiping may also be trying to
 lay the foundation for blaming
 the US for any Sino-American
 clash--either one that Peiping
 itself plans to initiate or one
 that it conjectures the US
 might provoke in order to capi-
 talize on the current low
 morale and economic difficulties
 of the Chinese populace.
 In its propaganda on the
 alleged US plot, Peiping is not
 at present charging the Nation-
 alists with compixcity.   The
 Communists even passed up a
 chance to include Taipei in
 their accusations following the
 downing on 2 August of a Chinese
 Nationalist reconaissance plane
 by Communist antiaircraft fire.
 To date,  all of Peiping's
 allegations concerning US
 "provocations" have been tied
 to the alleged US hope of dis-
 crediting Communist China before
 the UN session, suggesting that
 the Chinese have given at least
 some thought to the advisability
 of avoiding aggressive displays
 prior to the UN vote.   A Peiping
 broadcast of 24 August cited a
 number of American press reports
 on the US plans, among them a
 statement that US officials be-
 lieve an intensive resumption
 in Communist shelling of the off-
 shore islands would result in
 a "definite failure" for coun-
 tries advocating Peiping's "im-
 mediate admission" to the UN.
 Current Chinese Communist
 statements concerning the UN re-
 veal a greater interest in the
 outcome of the vote than the re-
 gime usually displays--possibly
 because the Chinese feel the is-
 sue may be headed for a showdown
 at the coming General Assembly
 session and wish to do what they
 can to influence the outcome.
 Peiping doubtless hopes its de-
 mands for a UN seat will receive
 a boost on the eve of the General
 Assembly session in the form of
 an endorsement by the conference
 of nonaligned nations at Belgrade.
 In communiques following their
 recent visits to China, both      25X1
 Indonesia's Sukarno and Ghana's
 Nkhrumah called for Peiping's
 admission to the UN.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 CONSTRUCTION SLUMP IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 The slowdown in construc-
 tion activity first noted in
 China during mid-1960 has con-
 tinued through at least the first
 half of 1961.   Current delays
 and cutbacks suggest little
 chance of a recovery this year
 to the high levels of the "leap
 forward" period.  Although there
 is considerable evidence that
 projects have been delayed or
 suspended, the lack of the usual
 economic statistics makes it dif-
 ficult to estimate the magnitude
 of the retrenchment.  This set-
 back in Peiping's construction
 effort will adversely affect in-
 dustrial production and economic
 growth over the next few years.
 a marked  ownturn
 in the rate of construction, in-
 cluding the apparent cessation
 of work on many partially com-
 pleted projects.  Growing short
 ages of construction materials
 contributed to work stoppages
 and resultant failures to
 meet ambitious plans.
 Accumulation of such dif-
 ficulties in late 1960 was suf-
 ficient to cause the regime to
 retreat openly from its "leap
 forward" program and institute
 a policy of retrenchment for
 1961.   The central committee
 plenum. in January ordered that
 the scope of capital construc-
 tion be reduced and more atten-
 tion paid to raising quality
 standards and filling gaps.
 There are indications that,
 shortly after this decision,
 work on a variety of
 projects throughout the
 country came to a virtual
 standstill.
 The poor performance in
 agriculture in 1959 and 1960,
 reducing the ability of the
 regime to pay for imports of
 machinery  and equipment for
 installation in new or planned
 projects, was an important
 factor in a reduction in capital
 investment for 1961.   Poor har-
 rnmetlt
 vests also led the. =gp Ve'
 31 Aug 61
 to pull labor away from construc-
 tion projects in order to boost
 efforts in agriculture.
 The many construction  projects
 of peripheral value started dur-
 ing the "leap forward" period puta
 heavy strain on Peiping's resources.
 Transport bottlenecks inhibited
 the smooth flow of materials; ma-
 chinery in construction materials
 plants was not adequately serviced;
 and an acute shortage of raw ma-
 terials, fuel, spare parts slowed
 construction work throughout the
 country.   Shortages of building
 materials, noted as early as mid-
 1960, worsened during the balance
 of that year and continued into
 1961.   In addition the widespread
 food shortages reduced the ef- 25X1
 ficiency of labor and, in some
 cases, impaired the physical
 'Ability of the workers to carry
 a full workload.
 The withdrawal of Soviet tech-
 nicians probably had its most im-
 mediate effect on construction by
 disrupting the installation of
 machinery and equipment in some
 Soviet aid projects.   The contin-
 ued absence of these specialists
 will particularly affect the de-
 signing and installation phases
 of complex projects such as those
 in the defense industries, elec-
 tronics, and atomic power.  There
 is little doubt, however, that
 the Chinese would have had to  25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 YUGOSLAVIA'S NEW CONSTITUTION
 The preparation of Yugo-
 slavia's new constitution is ap-
 parently proceeding on schedule.
 According to Edvard Kard e.lj,
 the regime's top ideologist., and
 chairman of the commission charged
 with writing the document, a
 draft will be submitted late this
 fall to parliament, which probably
 will approve it before dissolving
 prio3,,'to7.,the national elections
 next April.  Generally, the new
 constitution will formalize the
 changes made in the Yugoslav
 system since the present con-
 stitution, was last revised in
 1953.
 Although Kardelj in an ear-
 ly August press interview attempt-
 ed to limit discussion of the
 new constitution to general
 guide lines, he gave enough
 details to suggest that it is
 likely to engender some con-
 fusion and opposition.  Rep-
 resentatives..tboparliament will
 no longer be elected on a
 geographic basis but on the basis
 of still undefined economic cri-
 teria.,.          will probably
 be resistance in some circles
 to a projected provision limiting
 elected  terms of office.   No
 one will be allowed to serve two
 consecutive terms in parliament
 or to be, a member of the Federal
 Executive Council (cabinet)--with
 some exceptions not yet decided
 --for two conaecutiv:e - election
 periods.  To ensure some conti-
 nuity, half the number of depu-
 ties will be elected every two
 years.
 The regime apparently be-
 lieves any immediate disadvan-
 tages will be offset by the long-
 run benefits derived from
 allowing more people to hold
 office.   Such compulsory
 turnover would facilitate
 the promotion of talented younger
 .2officials.  The regime probably
 also expects to be able to.-,exercise
 greater control over the selec-
 t ion of deput ies,,most of whom now
 will be chosen from candidates
 nominated by local government
 bodies.  These local bodies are
 more vulnerable to federal eco-
 nomic and political pressures
 than SAWPY, the mass political
 organization which has nominated
 candidates in the past.
 The new constitution will
 not be favorably received in
 either the East or the West.
 Kardelj has called the document
 "another big step in the imple-
 mentation of the program of the
 League of Communists of Yugo-
 slavia"-i-a_...program which Mos-
 cow only recently again attacked
 as the fullest existing expres-
 sion of "revisionism."  The con-
 stitution will touch on such
 concepts as "the withering away
 of the state," workers' councils,
 and economic planning, on all of
 which Belgrade and Moscow dis-
 agree,'  Kardelj also stated that
 there will be a chapter on the
 "relations which ought to evolve
 between socialist countries."
 The West will find alien
 and unacceptable the basic con-
 cept of the Yugoslav constitution
 that man has rights, not by vir-
 tue of being a citizen, but only
 by direct participation in the
 economic life of the state.
 Westerners will also find repug-
 nant KardelJ's assertion that
 "certain revolutionary restric-
 tions of the so-called political
 rights are still indispensable!';
 i.e., the constitution will nei-    25X1
 ther extend civil rights in Yu-
 goslavia nor presage a weaken-
 ing pf the secret police.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 ,CAMEROUN
 The federation on 1 October
 of the British trust territory
 of Southern Cameroons and the
 adjoining former French trust
 area,    now the Cameroun Republic,
 will at first be only a paper
 union in many respects.   The
 integration of many normally
 federal activities will be de-
 layed because of the great dif-
 ference in the two areas, and
 the two existing governments
 will continue to function. Pres-
 ident Ahidjo of the former French
 area will become federal presi-
 dent, Premier Foncha of South-
 ern Cameroons vice president.
 A federal assembly will in-
 clude 40 deputies from the Cam-
 eroun Republic and 10 from the
 smaller British area.   Control
 of police is to be a local func-
 tion; control of the armed forces
 and responsibility for security,
 however, will fall to the fed-
 eral government. The talks be-
 tween leaders of the two areas
 on details of the federal opera-
 tion have been smoother than ex-
 pected.
 The principal question mark
 is whether the Cameroun security
 forces, which become the federal
 army, can successfully combat
 the long-standing terrorism of
 the Communist-influenced Union
 of Cameroun People (UPC), which
 sees Ahidjo as a French "puppet"
 whom it hopes to overthrow.
 Ahidjo now has two  French-
 trained light infantry battal-
 ions totaling 1,500 men; a third
 is to be ready by 1 October. He
 also has a gendarmerie of 3,500
 and a special militia of 2,000
 raised to control the trouble-
 some Bamileke tribal area, where
 the UPC has been active.   There
 is a French force of 1,200 in
 the Cameroun Republic, but Ahidjo
 and the French are reluctant to
 use it.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 President Alessandri, faced
 with strikes involving about a
 fourth of Chile's total labor
 force as a result of the wage
 policies,of his economic stabi-
 lization program, has at least
 temporarily strengthened his
 position by bringing the Radi-
 cal party, the country's large
 center party, into his rightist
 coalition government.   The
 government has placed Santiago
 and other important industrial
 areas under military rule.
 The Radicals r.ee6ived the
 cabinet posts of foreign re-
 lations, economy,  agriculture,,.
 and public health.   In an- ,',
 nouncing the new cabinet on 25
 August, the President said he
 wanted to start immediate and
 drastic reforms in the agrarian,
 tax, and educational fields
 as laid out in the Punta del
 Este conference.   Until recently
 Alessandri had been unable to
 win Radical support because
 Conservative and Liberal backers
 of his government were opposed
 to the projected reform meas-
 ures.
 The Radical party's en;
 trance into the government
 coalition gives Alessandri the
 strong parliamentary majority
 needed to hold down wages,  a17-
 though it is likely that com-
 promise wage increases may be
 granted in an effort to concil-
 iate the workers.  He. may still,
 however, face concerted and
 violent opposition to the
 stabilization plan.   The Commu-
 nist-dominated leadership of
 Chile's principal labor confed-
 eration, although it has little
 influence with most individual
 unions and federations, can be
 expected to exploit the present
 unrest.
 Communist spokesmen in Con-
 gress and elsewhere have also been
 campaigning increasingly against
 private foreign investments,
 particularly the US-owned copper
 companies, and have been joined
 in this by various nationalistic
 right-wing elements.   Proposed
 government legislation for the
 exploitation of copper, Chile's
 principal export, is apparently
 designed to accommodate these
 political pressures.
 This apparent shift in
 government policy seems to stem
 chiefly from a rise in nationalism,
 frustration over the lack of eco-
 nomic progress, rightist resent-
 ment over US stipulation that
 socio-economic reforms are a
 prerequisite for participation
 in the Alliance for Progress,  and
 heightened interparty rivalry.
 The minister of mines suggested
 to US Embassy officials in
 Santiago on 21 August that the
 companies should reorganize to
 become Chilean rather than US
 companies in the interest of their
 public and political relations.
 The next day the Chamber of
 Deputies voted unanimously to
 appoint a committee to deter-
 mtne whether the US companies'
 methods of doing business
 serve "the best interests of
 Chile."
 In a separate development,
 the American copper companies
 may be forced to fill a Chilean
 Government contract now under
 negotiation to sell 60,000
 tons of copper--about 10 per-
 cent of Chilean production--

 atomic weapons from,Norwegian soil.
 Labor's prospects are further
 enhanced by the inability of
 the divergent opposition parties
 to agree on any alternative
 program or to cooperate? except
 in a few instances,  in electoral
 alliances.
 There is, however,  latent
 neutralist and pacifist senti-
 ment in Norway, which is being
 exploited by the new Socialist
 People's party, a left-wing
 group which was formed in
 April largely by dissident Labor
 party intellectuals and is at-
 tracting some support among
 Liberals in the Oslo area.  The
 new party is seeking to capital-
 ize on the widespread concern
 over an atomic war Involving
 Norway and has denounced as equiv-
 ocal the the government's position
 of reserving the right to review
 its declared policy against nu-
 clear weapons in Norway.  The
 Communists, who received about
 3,4 percent of the popular vote
 and one mandate in parliament
 in the 1957 election, are not
 expected to improve this
 position.
 Prime Minister Gerhardsen,
 in his initial election speech
 on 20 August, implicitly recog-
 nized the strength of pacifist
 sentiment in Norway by stressing
 the need for negotiation on the
 Berlin issue.  Gerhardsen's sub-
 sequent statement that Norway's
 joining the European Economic
 Community would be considered
 after the elections reflects
 in part a desire to  pacify
 those Norwegians who dislike
 close association with Germany
 and France.
 In view of the proportional
 representation system and Labor's
 slim margin in several electoral
 districts, the governing party
 might lose its absolute majority,
 but it would still be the dominant
 element in any postelection gov-
 ernment because of the disunity
 among Its opponents.   Should the
 Socialist People's party make a
 strong showing--indicating a
 resurgence of neutrality and
 pacifist  sentiment  any post-
 election government, whether
 Labor or coalition, would be
 influenced to proceed more       25X1
 cautiously in defense questions,
 and even modest increases in
 defense appropriations would
 probably be precluded.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 ITALY
 The instability of Ital-
 ian Premier Fanfani's minority
 Christian Democratic govern-
 ment has been highlighted by a
 new controversy touched off in
 mid-August by Giuseppe Saragat,
 Social Democratic leader.   Sar-
 agat on 18 August threatened to
 withhold his support and thus
 bring down Fanfani.  He demanded
 formation of a center-left gov-
 ernment dependent on the sup-
 port of Pietro Nenni's Italian
 Socialist party. (PSI).
 Only a month earlier, Sar-
 ,agat,  in debate over a vote of
 confidence forced by the PSI,
 had argued that it was not ma-
 ture enough to participate in
 a coalition government.  His
 about-face is probably in part
 a tactical move to quiet dis-
 satisfaction in his own party
 over his mid-July statement,
 as well as a bid for broad
 Socialist support in next April's
 presidential election.
 His more basic concerns
 may be that continuing to sup-
 port a government of the center
 might reduce his party's chances
 in the next general elections,
 and that the Christian Demo-
 crats, unless he takes the ini-
 'tiative, might bypass him and

 recent speech by Aldo Moro,
 secretary general of the party.
 For.the first time Sar-

 Democrats' argument that the in-
 ternational situation requires the
 parties supporting the Italian
 Government to remain loyal, and
 he cites the similarity of Nenni's
 and the Italian Government's
 positions on Berlin as indicat-
 ing the eligibility of the
 Socialists to broaden the gov-
 ernment's majority.
 The small Republican party
 supported`Saragat's call for ac-
 commodation with the PSI.  How-
 ever,'Liberal party leader Mala-
 godi, who periodically threatens
 to withdraw support from the gov-
 ernment, responded quickly to
 Saragat by asking for a full-
 scale parliamentary debate--
 which could well lead to a vote
 of confidence--probably hoping
 either to call Saragat's bluff
 or to push him and Fanfani into
 a precipitate attempt--like that
 of April 1960--to form a center-

 RECENT TRENDS IN SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS
 The meeting of world Com-
 munist parties in Moscow in No-
 vember1960 closed one phase of
 the Sino-..,Soviet dispute--that
 of open and violent recrimina-
 tions.   However,  the decisions
 reached there and the resolution
 adopted have not led to any
 fundamental resolution of dif-
 ferences.  The relationship
 between the two powers since
 November has been an uneasy
 and erratic one, cooperative
 at some times and places, com-
 petitive at others.
 The Ideological Argument
 Immediately after publi-
 cation on 6 December of the
 Moscow Declaration which emanated
 from the November meeting, So-
 viet and Chinese media began
 to offer tendentious inter-
 pretations of it.   By late
 January both Moscow and Peiping,
 without resorting to polemics,
 had reaffirmed their positions
 on virtually all the issues of
 strategy which had been in dis-
 pute before and during the
 conference.
 The principal role in re-
 affirming, amplifying, and
 clarifying Soviet positions was
 played by Khrushchev himself,
 in his report on 6 January to
 a party audience in Moscow.   He
 is reported to have criticized
 the Chinese heavily--to have
 said that they were "stupid"
 but that it was necessary to
 reach an agreement with them.
 The published version contained
 only a defense of Soviet views
 without vituperation.
 Since then, the Soviet
 party has been restrained in its
 treatment of disputed questions
 of strategy.   In the first seven
 months of 1961, Moscow's line
 has continued to differ signifi-
 cantly from Peiping's in references
 to the destructive consequences of
 nuclear war and the possibility of
 averting it, in maintaining the
 need for "peaceful coexistence,"
 in reiterating the view that
 negotiations with the West can
 be fruitful, in agitating for
 "universal disarmament" and a
 "world without arms and without
 wars," in holding to the doctrine
 that Communist parties through-
 out the world should cooperate
 with "democratic" forces for
 limited "democratic" aims.   How-
 ever, none of these subjects has
 been treated polemically.  The
 trend during this period, more-
 over, has been toward a more
 militant propaganda stance
 toward the West.
 The Chinese party in the same
 period has also found occasion to
 reaffirm--also without argumenta-
 tion--all of its own positions.
 Several articles have explicitly
 reaffirmed the validity and con-
 tinuing importance of Peiping's
 Lenin Anniversary articles of
 April 1960, which set forth
 systematically its differences
 with Moscow on world Communist
 strategy.   Chinese views on the
 balance of power were reaffirmed
 in a much-advertised article
 on "not fearing ghosts," in
 comment on the failure of the
 Cuban venture as showing again
 that the United States was a
 paper tiger, and in assurances
 to various visitors that the "east
 wind" was prevailing.  The Cuban
 venture and the anniversary of
 the Korean war were used to argue
 that the Chinese party had been
 right in the full range of its
 positions on local wars.   The
 fighting in Algeria and Angola
 served as texts on the importance
 and example of "liberation" wars
 and the need to support them.

 CONFIDENTIAL
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Peiping's audience has
 often been reminded of the immu-
 tably evil character of the
 United States and of Mao Tse-
 tung's estimate that the Kennedy
 administration is "even worse"
 than its predecessor.   In join-
 ing the Soviet quarrel with Nasir
 in May and June, Peiping in
 effect reminded Moscow that the
 Chinese had for two years been
 contending that the UAR leader
 was a bad risk and that aid to
 him would harm the cause of the
 deserving Arab Communists.  The
 anniversary of the Paris Commune
 was the occasion for emphasizing
 the need for armed struggle in
 gaining and keeping power,  and
 Japanese Communist visitors
 were praised for their role in
 leading violent mass actions
 in the past two years.
 In its latest pronouncement
 --the draft of the new Soviet
 party program,  released on 30
 July--Moscow has followed the
 recent pattern of standing firm
 on most of the positions earlier
 disputed with Peiping while re-
 treating somewhat on others.
 Despite the minor modifications
 which bring the Soviet viewpoint
 closer to Peiping's in certain
 instances,  the Soviet program
 poses a dilemma for the Chinese
 leaders.   They have not yet
 originated any comment on it,
 although they have reprinted
 a TASS summary.
 Foreign Policy Coordination
 In addition to this basic
 one, the Chinese apparently made
 two other decisions during or
 soon after the Moscow conference
 which are of importance in
 judging bloc foreign policy
 since that time.   Having been
 heavily criticized at the
 conference for openly attacking
 the Soviet conduct of foreign
 policy (rather than attempting
 to negotiate differences in
 bilateral meetings), the Chinese
 apparently agreed not to resume
 such attacks.   Although there
 is evidence that some of Moscow's
 foreign policy initiatives in
 1961 have not had Peiping's whole-
 hearted approval, there has been
 no recurrence of its vitriolic
 comment on Soviet moves.
 Further,  the Chinese seem
 to have agreed at Moscow to
 another attempt by Khrushchev
 to probe the intentions of the
 West--particularly those of the
 new US administration--through
 personal confrontations.   This
 is not to say that the Chinese
 were agreeable to the kind of
 unorthodox activity that
 characterized Khrushehev'a
 approach to President Eisenhower,
 or even that they endorsed a
 new initiative, but they apparent-
 ly promised not to attempt to
 scuttle any new negotiations
 while they were being launched.
 Although the concept of
 "peaceful coexistence" was held
 high in the Moscow Declaration
 and the way was left open for new
 negotiations with the West,  Khru-
 shchev's flexibility in operating
 within these general policy lines
 was constrained by the bitter
 condemnations of Western  (particu-
 larly American) "imperialism"
 and the emphasis on the need to
 support anticolonial actions in
 underdeveloped areas.
 The contradictions inherent
 in Moscow's support for revolution-
 ary situations while it attempted
 to carry forward negotiations
 with the West became apparent
 almost immediately.   During
 December 1960 and January 1961,
 the Soviet Union,  through propa-
 ganda and diplomatic feelers,
 advocated an early meeting
 between Khrushchev and the new
 US President.   At the same time,
 however,  the rapidly developing
 situation in Laos gave the Soviet

 Union an opportunity it could
 not afford to miss. By ag-
 gressively pursuing common bloc
 aims in Laos, the Soviet Union
 deterred the Chinese from
 charging Moscow with departures
 from the December 1960 declara-
 tion (as Peiping had persistently
 done with regard to the November
 1957 declaration), but at the
 same time it reduced the pos-
 sibility of early and friendly
 meetings with the United States.
 The Soviet Union's tough
 tactics continued through the
 next six months.   In February,
 Patrice Lumumba's death brought
 increasingly violent propaganda
 attacks on UN policy and on
 Secretary General Hammarskjold.
 In March,  the USSR virtually
 ended any chance of agreement in
 the nuclear test ban talks by
 introducing its "troika" concept.
 In April,  in the wake of the
 Cuban invasion which found
 Khrushchev offering to support
 Castro "with all possible aid,"
 the latest phase of the Berlin
 crisis developed.   By the time
 Khrushchev met with President
 Kennedy in June,  there was
 little possibility that the
 result would be a "spirit of
 Vienna."
 The Chinese have also wel-
 comed Khrushchev's challenge to
 the structure of the UN.   Last
 fall, they not only failed to
 endorse his activities at the
 General Assembly but chided him
 for being pushed around by the
 United States.   During 1961,
 however, Peiping has supported
 the Soviet line at the UN and has
 described it as "fruitful" in
 exposing the aggressive nature
 of imperialism.   Khrushchev's
 conduct of the Berlin crisis has
 particularly pleased the Chinese,
 who have consistently supported
 the Soviet deadline on a Berlin
 settlement and have emphasized
 the militant features of
 the   Soviet    remier's`-,state-
 ments.
 The only Soviet initiative
 in 1961 to which the Chinese have
 been cool was Khrushchev's meeting
 with President Kennedy.   Peiping
 has remained concerned about such
 approaches; last January's Foreign
 Ministry briefing noted that the
 USSR was "anxious" to improve its
 relations with the US and that
 China must be particularly on
 guard against a Soviet-Western
 "detente."  Peiping's public
 response to the talks at Vienna,
 therefore, was quite reserved.
 Thus, while the Soviet
 Union has continued throughout
 this period to maintain in
 abstract doctrinal terms that
 the horrors of nuclear war are
 such that "peaceful coexistence"
 is the only answer, that war
 is not inevitable, that the
 peaceful road to power is
 preferable  to the violent,  its
 specific actions have given the
 Chinese little to complain
 about.
 The Chinese, while similarly
 maintaining their doctrinal
 positions, have generally sup-
 ported all major Soviet diplo-
 matic moves during 1961.   In
 Laos, the bloc's principal of-
 fensive during the first half
 of 1961, there have been some
 indications of possible Sino-
 Soviet disagreement over the
 timing and terms for a settle-
 ment, but both sides have been
 able to make adjustments in the
 interest of a coordinated bloc
 policy.
 Relations in Other Fields
 Thus far in 1961 the Sino-
 Soviet economic relationship
 .has seemed correct, but decidedly
 cool.   Apparently content with  ',
 the damage done by the withdrawal
 of its technicians last summer,
 Moscow is not known to have taken
 additional measures to contribute
 to China's economic difficulties.
 Nor has it done anything,.on the
 other hand,  to assist.
 The withdrawal of Soviet
 technicians disrupted a program
 of Chinese industrialization
 for which the USSR had promised
 the necessary machinery, blue-
 prints, and experts to build
 and equip 291 major industrial
 plants by 1967.   Only half of
 these plants had been completed
 when the technicians left., Since
 then,  the program has been
 seriously slowed down,  especially
 in the fields of military industry
 and atomic energy, which depended
 heavily on the Soviet technicians.

 The Soviet aid program--
 or what remained of it--was
 the chief topic of the "eco-
 nomic" and "technical-scjentif-
 ic"' agreements signed in Moscow
 on 19 June 1961.  The talks
 leading to these agreements had
 been going on since February,
 apparently with meager results.
 Neither the communique signed
 by both parties nor Chinese
 commentary on the agreements
 mentioned Soviet aid projects
 or acknowledged, that Soviet aid
 still exists in any form.   So-
 viet officials insist that aid
 continues,  but they have not
 elaborated.
 There is a paucity of in-
 cations of Soviet military de-
 liveries to China thus far in
 1961.   Although the USSR has
 continued to deliver petroleum
 products, no shipments have
 been noted of major equipment,
 such as military aircraft, naval
 vessels,  arm  trucks, tanks, or
 artiller
 Apparently many of the
 Soviet scientists in China were
 withdrawn along with the eco-
 nomic and military specialists
 put in proportionately fewer
 numbers.   Soviet assistance
 in scientific research and
 development activities appears
 to have continued at a. reduced
 level.   The program for training
 Chinese science students in the
 USSR (which had shifted to
 graduate students only in 1957)
 is still going on,  as is that
 for purchasing bloc scientific
 and medical instruments for
 use in China.   Both programs,
 however, have been limited
 by foreign exchange problems.
 With respect to the mil-
 itary research programs,  how-
 ever, Soviet aid has been
 drastically reduced if not
 halted.   Moscow's assistance
 to Peiping's atomic energy pro-
 gram apparently has not been
 resumed, in terms of either
 engineers or material aid.
 SUMMARY
 Chinese
 weapons development and produc-
 tion programs have apparently
 bogged down in 1961 for lack of
 Soviet cooperation.
 Eastern Europe and the Dispute
 The Sino-Soviet com-
 petition for influence among
 members of the bloc has con-
 tinued to be best illustrated
 in Albania, now privately de-
 scribed by Eastern European
 leaders as "Moscow's Cuba.
 Immediately following the Moscow
 conference, East German party
 chief Walter:.Ulbricht publicly
 criticized Tirana's delegation
 for its behavior at Moscow,
 and Albanian party boss Enver
 Hoxha soon replied that he would
 not bow on "matters of principle."
 During the Albanian party
 congress in February, Hoxha bel-
 ligerently reaffirmed the party's
 pro-Chinese positions, and the
 congress was-the occasion for
 another-confrontation of the
 parties along the lines of the
 Moscow conference.   In March,
 the same month that the Chinese
 agreed to provide Albania with
 $125,000,000 worth of economic
 aid,  an Albanian trade delegation
 obtained credit in the European
 satellites but apparently did
 not even approach the USSR.
 An Albanian show trial of
 "spies and traitors" last May
 was in fact an anti-Soviet
 demonstration.   It was followed
 by Soviet evacuation of the
 important submarine base at
 Vlone and by indications that
 all Soviet military forces might
 he leaving Albania.   Moscow also
 ordered the Albanian military
 attach  and certain Albanian
 students to leave the USSR,  and
 Tirana expelled the Soviet mil-
 itary attache and some military
 advisers.  Albania may not be
 fully participating in the
 activities of the Warsaw Pact
 or of the bloc's Council for
 Mutual Economic Assistance  (CEMA).
 The leaders of all other
 Eastern European states have
 continued to support the Soviet
 party in the dispute, have taken
 measures against factionalism in
 their own parties, and have
 exerted pressures on the Chinese
 and especially the Albanians.

 These pressures have included
 attacks by party leaders on
 Chinese and Albanian positions,
 censorship of news about China
 and Albania, restrictions on
 both official and unofficial
 contacts, and a reduction--but
 not a cessation--of trade and
 technical aid.
 The Asian Satellites
 Sino-Soviet competition
 for influence in the three
 other Asian Communist states--
 two of which, North Korea and
 North Vietnam,, were equivocal
 at. the Moscow conference--bass
 seemed to increase since the
 conference.   Although Soviet and
 Chinese policies toward these
 states have complementary as
 well as competitive aspects,
 the impression has been ,that
 each side is acting quickly to
 match the initiatives of the
 other.
 Last Decembrer, Moscow
 provided North Vietnam with
 $112,000,000 in loans and
 grants for the new economic
 plan,     The following.month,
 Peiping gave Hanoi a loan of
 $1,57,000,000.   In late 1960,
 Moscow had topped a Chinese
 credit of $100,000,900 to
 North. Korea by canceling $190-
 000,000 of Pyongyang's debt to
 the USSR.
 On 6 July 1961, Moscow and
 Pyongyang concluded a mutual
 defense pact.   In an apparently
 hasty decision, the Chinese in-
 vited Kim II-sung to stop over
 on his way home from the USSRp
 be was given a lavish welcome,
 and on 11 July Peiping and
 Pyongyang signed a mutual de-
 fense pact virtually identical
 to the one Kim had just signed
 in Moscow.   Like the latter
 accord,.  the Peiping-Pyongyang
 pact mentioned economic aid,
 suggesting a possible Chinese
 intention to match the aid Kim
 was promised in Moscow.
 The Chinese have not
 attempted to match the most
 recent (April 1961) Soviet aid
 to Outer Mongolia.  A Chinese
 credit,of $50,000,000 to Ulan
 Bator in 1960 was soon topped
 by a Soviet o..fer three times
 as large, and the Mongolian party
 lined up. solidly with the
 Soviets at the Moscow conference
 and has continued to do so;
 the Chinese now may feel
 that Mongolia is a bad.invest-
 ment.
 Nonbioc
 Parties and Fronts
 The Chinese challenge
 to Soviet authority in the
 world Communist movement was
 a principal reason for the
 convocation of the Moscow con-
 ference in November 1960.
 Prior to that conference, both
 Moscow and Peiping lobbied
 strenuously for support among
 other. Communist parties.   In
 contrast, thus far in 1961 there
 has not seemed to be an acute
 competition for influence with
 the nonbloc parties.  The Soviet
 and Chinese parties have ap-
 peared instead to be strengthen-
 ing their positions with the
 parties which they already
 dominated, rather than moving
 aggressively to try to capture
 the followers of the other.
 The Sino-Soviet dis-
 pute on the proper use of
 the world Communist fronts
 has apparently continued,
 however, in the early months
 of 1961,  The Chinese insisted,
 particularly in meetings
 sponsored by the World Peace
 Council, the International
 Union of Students, the World
 Federation of Democratic Youth,
 and the Afro-Asian Solidarity
 Organization, that the fronts
 should openly charge US
 imperialism with the prime
 responsibility for all current
 crises and should work primarily
 to promote militant anti-im-
 perialist, national liberation
 struggles,  They wished to de-
 emphasize those front cam-
 paigns which promoted dis-
 armament and publicized the
 benefits non-Communists might
 gain from peaceful coexistence.
 Soviet and pro-Soviet partic-
 ipants in meetings of these
 organizations tried to main-
 tain a certain moderation in
 the language of resolutions,
 to avoid undue emphasis on
 anti-American formulas, and
 to give priority to appeals for

 struggles for disarmament and
 peaceful coexistence. However,
 the Soviets have given greater
 attention than before to ex-
 pressing solidarity with anti-
 colonial and national libera-
 tion struggles along lines long
 advocated by the Chinese.
 The clearest evidence of
 continuing.Sino-Soviet rivalry
 in the fronts has been in or-
 ganizational developments.   In
 the World Federation of Trade
 Unions, steps were taken to
 set up a three-man presiden-
 cy--a Soviet, a Chinese, and an
 Italian known to be anti-Chi-
 nese.   A similar but larger
 "collective presidency" has
 for some time existed in the
 World Peace Council, assuring
 pro-Soviet control of the or-
 ganization's programs.   In the
 World Peace Council and the
 Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee,
 Chinese members--perhaps frus-
 trated in efforts to dominate
 the organizations--have avoided
 participating in the work of
 the secretariats.
 Roth powers apparently rec-
 ognized  the dangers inherent
 in the intemperate and open ex-
 changes of last year, and the
 limited agreements which were
 reached at the Moscow confer-
 ence have served to keep di-
 rect attacks to a minimum.
 However,  the fundamental problem
 n--that of authority within the
 world Communist movement--re-
 mains unresolved, and each side
 is apparently determined to
 maintain its ground.   As a
 consequence, competition can
 be expected to be most marked
 in each party's activities
 within the Communist movement,
 as each seeks to maintain and
 expand its support in and among
 the other parties.   This com-
 petition will probably be
 keenest within the Asian par-
 ties, where both Soviet and
 Chinese influences are strong,
 The Chinese view the par-
 ties of the underdeveloped
 areas as their natural allies
 against the developed, European
 Communism of the USSR and will
 probably.work hard to mobilize
 this potential on their behalf.
 China will almost certainly
 continue its support of Albania
 --support which may have to be
 increased if Khrushchev takes
 further measures open to,'him
 to weaken that satellite.
 The next big test within
 the movement will probably come
 in October, when delegates from
 all the parties attend the 22nd
 Soviet party congress, which is
 to approve the party's 20-year
 program.   The published draft
 pays a certain deference to
 "national peculiarities," but
 it is infused with an author-
 itarian spirit and is clearly
 meant to reassert and project,
 forward the proposition that
 Soviet experience is univer-
 sally valid.   The model of
 socialism, it says,  is to be
 found in the history of the
 USSR, and the detailed defin-i--
 tion of Communism can be found
 in the Soviet program itself.
 These are propositions the
 Chinese cannot accept.   Their
 response at the congress may be
 moderate,  but they will try in
 various ways to limit the appli-
 cability of the congress pro-
 nouncements to the Soviet party.
 The Soviets, for their  part,
 will of course seek to have as
 many parties as possible endorse
 the theses in a way which stresses
 their universality.   If either
 the Chinese protest or the Soviet
 insistence is too strong,  it is
 possible that another internation-
 almeeting,along the lines of the
 November 1957 and November 1960 con-
 ferences, will take place during or
 of ter the congress.

 When the negotiations open
 in October on Britain's appli-
 cation for membership, the Eu-
 ropean Common Market (EEC) will
 already be facing other issues
 of vital. importance to its fu-
 ture.  Ostensibly economic,
 most of these problems have far-
 reaching political implications,
 and several affect basic objec-
 tives of the organization. While
 the EEC has been making notable
 advances in the last four years,
 particularly in the field of
 tariff reductions, these other
 measures of nearly equal impor-
 tance have been delayed, and
 some now have become the subject
 of major 'dispute,   Should the
 present six member countries be
 tempted to delay further be-
 cause of the impending talks
 with London, they would risk
 losing the momentum which is an
 essential element in the drive
 for European union.
 The Agricultural Problem
 The most complex and po-
 tentially most disruptive of all
 these problems is the question
 of a common agricultural pol-
 icy.:The EEC, unlike the Outer
 Seven, provides for full cover-
 age of the farming industry,  in-
 cluding gradual creation of a
 single market for farm produce,
 regulation of competition, and
 eventual replacement of national
 with community marketing organ-
 izations.  Article 43 of the
 EEC treaty gives the EEC.Com-
 mission the task of drafting a
 common policy'to achieve these
 general objectives, but imple-
 mentation is subject to spe-
 cific directives issued by the
 counci.l.:  Until,1966, such di-
 -require the unanimous
 approval`of the council's na-
 tional`representatives--there-
 after,'a prescribed weighted
 majority is sufficient.
 Since 1958, Commissioner
 Mansholt, the responsible EEC
 official, hap been trying to
 produce a program which would
 reconcile conflicting national
 interests with the facts of Eu-
 ropean agriculture--character-
 ized by wide variations in ef-
 ficiency, major differences in

 ECONOMIC ISSUES IN THE COMMON MARKET
 price levels, and a panoply of
 protective devices.   The result
 is a complex plan which, while
 varying from product to product,
 relies heavily on the mechanism
 of variable import levies--in
 effect, protective tariffs.
 These levies would elim-
 inate the difference between im-
 port and domestic prices, or,
 in some cases, differences in
 producers' costs.   In intra-EEC
 trade, the levies would be
 progressively reduced and ulti-
 mately abandoned as EEC prices
 became harmonized.   For imports
 from abroad, however,  they
 would be the principal device
 for supporting EEC prices and
 maintaining a measure of pref-
 erence for the Common Market
 producer. If these prices are
 supported at a high enough level,
 competition from abroad could
 be eliminated--but at the risk
 of encouraging overproduction
 within the EEC.
 Status of the Mansholt Plan
 Despite the Initial crit-
 icism which greeted it, the
 Mansholt Plan was endorsed in
 principle at a council meeting
 last December, and the commis-
 sion has drafted detailed pro-
 grams for many of the products
 to which it applies.   None of
 these programs has yet been
 authorized, however, and sev-
 eral basic decisions--such as
 the criteria for minimum prices--
 are still outstanding.
 The impasse is largely a
 reflection of the differing in-
 terests of the major exporters
 and importers of foodstuffs
 within the EEC.  The exporting
 countries--France, the Nether-
 lands, and Italy--have long in-
 sisted on principle that, if
 the EEC established free trade
 for industrial products only,
 West Germany would have intol-
 erable commercial advantages.
 Moreover, as the discontent of
 the French farmer has flared
 into violence, De Gaulle has
 had increasingly pressing polit-
 ical reasons for demanding im-
 mediate access to the German
 market for French farm products.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Thus far Bonn has done lit-
 tle to meet the demands of its
 EEC partners.         The Mansholt
 plan would mean an ultimate re-
 duction in German farm prices
 and willingness to rely on less
 rigorously protective devices
 than heretofore.   Especially
 during the campaign for West
 Germany's national election on
 17 September, Chancellor Ade-
 nauer has been anxious to mol-
 lify his own farmers, who, po-
 litically powerful themselves,
 are supported by commercial
 interests which feel that a
 reduction of Germany's food im-
 ports from non-EEC countries
 might lead to a corresponding
 reduction of German industrial
 sales outside the Common Market.
 Observers generally agree
 that the only answer in sight is
 an eventual retreat by Bonn,
 and the other EEC countries are
 counting increasingly on a post
 election breakthrough.   This
 possibility,  however, now has
 been complicated by the uncer-
 tain impact of Britain's and
 Denmark's bids for EEC member-
 ship.   The EEC-Danish talks are
 likely to center on continued
 access of Danish foodstuffs to
 the German market.   In Britain's
 case, one of the major obstacles
 to EEC accession is the problem
 of amalgamating  the Continental
 system of farm price supports
 with London's system of defi-
 ciency payments.   Curiously,
 both Bonn and Paris are appar-
 ently counting on Britain's
 support.   The French feel that
 London shares their interest
 in a moderate level for farm
 prices, while the Germans see
 Britain as a potential new out-
 let for French surpluses.
 Transitional Problems
 Adding both heat and ur-
 gency to the farm issue is its
 close connection with the EEC's
 problems in moving next January
 to the second stage of the tran-
 sitional period.   The EEC treaty
 provided for the establishment
 of the Common Market over a
 period of 12-15 years, divided
 into three stages, each with a
 "coordinated group of activities
 which must be undertaken and
 pursued concurrently."  Passage
 to the second stage is contingent
 on unanimous agreement that the
 "main aims" of the first stage
 have been effectively achieved.
 In the absence of such agreement,
 the first stage would be auto-
 matically extended for as long
 as two years, after which major-
 ity opinion could prevail.
 Major psychological, polit-
 ical, and economic importance
 now attaches to the advance to
 the second stage.   At the end of
 this stage,'the EEC becomes
 more supranational" through
 the extension of the majority
 rule to a greater number of
 council decisions.   Even more
 important, much of the success
 of the EEC has been due to its
 provision of a timetable and to
 the probability that the actual
 transition time would be short-
 er than the minimum period pro-
 vided for.   Reversal of this
 expectation might well arrest
 the rapid adjustment of indus-
 try to a larger market--one of
 the most important consequences
 of the EEC.
 This danger is especially
 real, because in the last few
 months the EEC's program for ac-
 celerating the implementation
 of the Common Market  has be-
 come increasingly enmeshed with
 the same problems which have
 arisen over the transition to
 the second stage.   Under this
 program, approved in 1960, the
 10-percent reductions in EEC
 internal tariffs scheduled for
 last January and next December
 were both to have been doubled.
 Added to the 10-percent reduc-
 tions effected in January 1959,
 this would mean a 50-percent
 reduction in intra-EEC tariffs
 by the end of this year--rather
 than at the end of 1964 as pro-
 vided by the treaty.
 After considerable contro-
 versy, the first doubling has
 been carried out, but approval
 of the second now is deadlocked
 in the EEC Council, with Bonn
 again.  a ; minority of one. West
 Germany contends that since
 business conditions are favor-
 able, the 20-percent reduction
 in tariffs should be carried out
 as planned--provided it is con-
 fined to industrial items. None

 cial security rules--for example,

 With strong support from
 the Netherlands,  Italy also at-
 taches special importance to
 the EEC provision for a common
 transport policy.   Rome is pri-
 marily interested in easing na-
 tional restrictions on highway
 transport, and its demands can
 probably be met by next Decem-
 ber.  The Netherlands, however,
 with its favorable geographic
 location and its already exten-
 sive transport services-through-
 out the EEC, is more concerned
 with the rules for the general
 regulation of transportation,

 ably nil,  The relevant treaty
 provisions in this case are

 pipelines) is disputed; and the

 of the other countries is pre-
 pared to do this, however.   Ac-
 celeration, like transition,
 they say, is contingent on equiv-
 alent sacrifices and opportuni
 ties--in other words, on common
 agreement that all the "main
 aims" of the EEC are being
 achieved at an approximately
 equal pace.
 Obstacles to Transition and
 Acceleration
 As might be expected,  the
 list of such aims is headed by
 the agreement on a farm policy,
 but there are a number of other
 items also Of considerable im-
 portance and delicacy.
 Monopoly Practices and Cartels
 Finally, within the last
 few weeks Bonn has requested
 that by the end of the year the
 EEC reach an agreement on regu-
 lations for the control of car-
 tels and the abuse of monopoly
 positions--rules which have
 been overdue since last January.
 Much of this delay is again
 attributable to the EEC treaty,
 which combines a strong state-
 ment of anticartel principle
 with a major loophole and a
 complete absence of enforce-
 ment machinery.   For example,
 the treaty "prohibits" enter-
 prises from taking "unfair ad-
 vantage" of dominant positions
 and declares null and void any
 agreements among them which have
 as their object the restriction
 of competition.   Mergers and
 concerted practices are permitted,
 however, if they contribute to
 an improvement in the production
 or distribution of goods or pro-
 mote technical or "economic"
 progress.   Moreover, pending
 the issuance of implementative
 regulations, enforcement is en-
 trusted to the member states--
 some of which do not have anti-
 cartel laws.
 For example, the EEC treaty
 confers a general obligation on
 its members to foster improve-
 ment in working and living con-
 ditions of labor, harmonize
 their social systems, and col-
 laborate generally in the "so-
 cial field."  These provisions
 are so vague and far-reaching
 that none of the members really
 expects--or probably wants--
 their early implementation.
 Paris, however, which has long
 maintained that its more costly
 system of "social legislation"
 places French industry at a
 competitive disadvantage, has
 insisted on the enforcement at
 least of Article 119, which spe-
 cifically obliges the EEC coun-
 tries to "apply the principle"
 of equal pay for men and women.
 A working group has been set up
 to see what can be done to meet
 the French demand, but agreement
 seems far from certain.
 Italy,  too, has cited as
 "main aims" certain provisions
 initially placed in the EEC
 treaty at Rome's behest and in-
 tended to provide an outlet in
 the Comm?n-Market for surplus
 Italian workers.   Last March,
 the EEC instituted a special
 program to train some 9,000
 Italians for work in West Ger-
 many and the Netherlands, and
 in June, after months of debate,
 regulations were approved look-
 ing toward freer movement of
 workers and eventual creation
 of a single market for labor.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY 'SUMMARY
 As a result of these con-
 tradictory provisions, which
 reflect the equivocal attitude
 Europeans have traditionally
 taken toward cartels, discus-
 sion of enforcement machinery
 during the past year has tended
 to be a dialogue of the deaf.
 In general, West Germany and
 the Netherlands support the EEC
 Commission's proposals which
 require enterprises to notify
 the EEC of existing cartels
 and to seek prior authorization
 of new ones and which give the
 commission powers of investi-
 gation and enforcement.   France
 leads the opposition, charging
 that the notification system
 is unworkable and proposing
 instead a complaint procedure.
 Paris wants a wider participa-
 tion~of the member states in
 the enforcement procedures and
 apparently also fears that the
 commission's plan would bear
 down harder on French cartels
 than on the "giants of German
 industry."
 The EEC Assembly is sched-
 uled to debate these issues at
 a meeting in October,  and the
 council will make another at-
 tempt'to reach a compromise in
 mid-November.   Prospects for any
 advance at that time are prob-
 ably still poor,                      although there
 have been some signs lately of
 increased appreciation of the
 importance of the cartel problem
 to the EEC.   France's influential
 Le Monde recently  wrote   that
 Eat is -really at stake is
 whether "the new world of the
 Common Market,  freed from its
 customs barriers, now is to be cut
 up by the frontiers of cartels."
 Conclusions and Prospects
 The growing conviction of
 the EEC countries that the Com-
 mon Market iq in fact an attempt
 to create a kind of new European
 world may in fact be the basic
 reason for the relative optimism
 among EEC observers that in the
 Yong run there may be no alter-
 native to agreement on most if
 not all these issues, difficult
 though this may be.   While the
 eventual dreation of a full
 customs union is a key feature
 of the Common Market,  its authors
 fully recognized that it is
 difficult in a modern industrial
 CONFIDE
 society to operate such a
 union without proceeding to full
 economic (and political) unifi-
 cation.   In a number of-instances,
 it was impossible to agree in
 detail on the steps to be taken,
 so the treaty drafters had to re-
 sort tm vague statements of:objectives.
 As tariff barriers have
 fallen, however, it has become
 not only more imperative to put
 flesh on the treaty's bones, but
 also more difficult for any one
 member to block an agreement in-
 definitely.   Thus, possibly at
 midpoint in its transition period
 and before its central institu-
 tions have yet become established,
 the EEC is already being com-
 pelled to grapple with problems
 which have been among the most
 difficult in American history--
 regulation of interstate com-
 merce,  enforcement of antitrust
 legislation,  and control of com-
 petition in agriculture.   How-
 ever,  the creation of new agencies
 to accomplish these ends would
 in turn enhance the need for more
 effective central institutions
 to control them.
 The last few weeks have pro-
 duced another significant example
 of this cumulative effect of the
 EEC and of its importance to the
 objective of European union:.   The
 monetary provisions of the EEC
 treaty are perhaps among its
 weakest,  no doubt because con-
 trol over money is the last bas-
 tion of national sovereignty.
 However,  only four years after
 the treaty became effective,
 EEC Commissioner Marjolin has
 succeeded in placing on the
 agenda of the 8 September meet-
 ing of the EEC finance ministers
 Jean Monnet's recent proposal for
 the pooling of the Common Mar-
 ket's monetary reserves.   In
 Marjolin's view, moreover, a
 "financial and monetary under-
 standing" should accompany Britain's
 entry into the European communities.
 As he and Monnet have noted,  the
 EEC's total monetary reserves now
 are.. roughly five times as large
 as Britain's,  the EEC's external
 liabilities are small compared
 with London's, and the EEC is now
 in a position to ease the periodic
 pressure on sterling by assuming
