 PART I
 MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN WORLD COMMUNISM
 DURING APRIL
 During April, Communist activity continued to
 increase in areas where party efforts had praviously been
 latent or small scale such as in Latin America,  Communist
 militancy persisted or increased in areas where the parties
 are strong, such as in Western Europe and Southeast Asia.
 The vigor of these activities is likely to grow during the
 forthcoming months despite the partially cuccessiul measures
 of some governments to restrain or repress the movement,
 The "peace" campaign continues to be one of the
 principal. Communist activities with elaborate preparations
 underway for its continued promotion on an unprecedented
 scale.    Highest priority is being given to mobilization of
 popular support for outlawing the atomic bomb.  Efforts
 will be made by the Communists to extend their "peace
 organization" in some western countries to agricultural and
 religious groups,, formerly not approached because of the
 probable difficulty of enlisting their active support.  In
 this campaign no opportunity is overlooked in impressing
 upon all peoples, and especially upon-all those whose loyalty
 may be wavering between East and West,, that the Soviet Union
 is the 2rl~y powerful nation struggling for peace; while the
 USA is No, 1 in the camp of war--mongers.
 Recent Comu.nist activities in the Middle East
 apparently indicate'. ~n intensified Soviet interest in that
 area which may be aimed at greater area-wide coordination of
 Communist operations.  In pursuit of this objective, the
 USSR is now seeking to strengthen the Communist apparatus
 in the Middle East.  Beirut has again reportedly become the
 center for organizing and coordinating Communist activities
 in the whole area.  In Iran, where economic conditions offer

 fertile grounds for Communist exploitation, Ttzdeh activities
 have further increased during April.  More Communist activity
 was also apparent in Syria and Lebanon.  Moreover, the Soviet
 reversal of its position on the internationalization of Jeru-
 salem was at least partially designed to strengthen the
 Communist element in Israel,
 However, while the apparent Soviet-Communist
 effort in the Middle East is yet in its beginnings and
 expected to make slow progress, the USSR has successfully
 consolidated its position in the Communist movement in the
 Far East.     For example, during April, the HO Chi Minh regime,
 having definitely taken sides with the USSR in several major
 issues, confirmed its Stalinist orientation.  In China,
 available evidence indicates solidarity among the Party
 leaders despite continuous rumors of a split in the leadership.
 There has been more evidence that the "chain of
 command." for the Far Eastern Communist movement is centered
 in Peiping,  There are indications that the Burmese Communist
 (White Flag) Party has abandoned its traditional ties with
 India and now considers Peiping as its link with the inter-
 national Communist apparatuso  It has also been reported that
 the 1 FTU4s Far Eastern Liaison Bureau in Peiping is formulating
 a "plan of action" for dis,",heating Pacific and South Asian
 shipping in accordance with secret Soviet directives issued
 during the VFTU Peiping Conference last November,
 Mounting world-wide intensification of Communist
 aggressiveness in the past year, however, has stimulated
 counter--measures in at least some countries,,  The draft of
 a bill now before the Australian Parliament to outlaw the
 Communist Party, and General MacArthur's remarks which
 questioned the party's right to further legal existence, if
 implemented, would seriously we._.. en the Communist Party

 These measures appear to be part of.a growing
 tendency outside the Soviet orbit toward governmental
 suppression of Communist activities,  Although the immediate
 effect of suppression will., in many instances, increase
 Communist use of violence and intensify efforts to infiltrate
 and control non-Communist organizations, its net effect, as
 in the past, would probably be to reduce Communist strength.
 Because the Communists realize that the loss of legal
 existence denies them important channels of influence, they
 will make a concerted effort to postpone or defeat any
 contemplated action to outlaw them,

 PART II
 SURVEY OF SIGNIFICANT TRENDS
 This survey of significant trends
 in the international Communist movement
 which have become apparent during the
 month of April, contains only those de-
 velopments which are believed to have an
 important effect on the potential of
 world Communism,
 l 9  AREAS OF INCREASING    MUNIST- ACTIVITY
 MIDDLE EAST
 a.  General
 Recent events in and reports from the Middle
 East indicate that there is an intensification of Soviet
 interest and activities in that area, notably in those
 countries in which Communist activities may flourish with
 least interference--Lebanon, Syria, and Israel.  Together
 with the reinvigorated Communist campaign in Iran, this
 regrouping of Communist strength and the acceleration of
 subversive activities may be Lcl.ried at a greater area-wide
 coordinLAtion of Communist operations.
 Communist activity during the past two months
 seems to confirm the varying reports that an important
 meeting of some Middle East Communist leaders, including
 pro-Soviet Kurds, was held in February in Beirut.  Accord-
 ing to reports, the chief purpose of this organization is
 to tighten the links between various Arab Communist parties
 and the Israeli Communist Party, to centralize intelligence
 activities, and to serve as a distributing agency for the
 dissemination of Communist propaganda.

 b.  Iran
 There are indications that the resurgent Tudeh
 Parts, which has hitherto confined its public activity
 largely to wall-scrawling and the publication of its
 clandestine newspapers and pamphlets, is now turning to
 more active forms of agitation.  The Iranian authorities
 charge that Tudeh has not only taken advantage of rural
 distress to encourage the flight of peasants to the cities
 but has also figured in a number of demonstrations which
 have recently taken place, protesting against the admittedly
 had conditions existing in various parts of the country.
 In the vital oil-producing southwest, armed mobs, believed
 to be Communist-inspired, have recently been roaming
 through the Abadan refinery compound, necessitating the
 reinforcement of compaw-q security units with Iranian Navy
 detachments.  The chief of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company
 security forces estimates that the Abadan area now contains
 1,000 Communists, many of them newly arrived Azerbaijanis
 who are trained saboteurs and who would presumably operate
 against the oil fields and. the refinery in case of war
 between the USSR and the Western powers.  Two recent
 student strikes at the University of Tehran Medical School
 and at the University of Meshed, probably also bear the
 marks of Tudeh influence though observers state that the
 universities were open to legitimate criticism?  A Tudeh-
 youth organization, centered in the University of Tehran,
 has reportedly been set up under a leader specially trained
 in the Soviet Union.  Meanwhile, there have been fragmentary
 reports that a violent strike has just taken place at Shahi,
 an important industrial city on the northern branch of the
 Trans-Iranian Railway; the strike, which the Shah and Prince
 Abdor Reza personally went to investigate, has been officially
 ascribed to Tudeh agitation.
 Of a less alarming but still significant nature
 has been the Tudeh'a growing influence in the press and in
 established political circles.  Reports from Meshed, principal

 city of the "open" northeast, indicate that individuals
 either previously members of the Tudeh Party or otherwise
 known to be pro-Soviet have made astonishing inroads into
 the Iran Party (which at one time collaborated with Tudeh)
 and have secured positions with papers published by its
 supporters.  Infiltration of government bureaus is also
 going on--alroady several individuals have been exposed
 and discharged- -:vhile a new leftist party, which will be
 able to serve Tudoh interests without bearing the onus of
 the party label, is being organized.
 In the maze of rumor and unconfirmed reports
 which emanate from Iran today it is impossible to delineate
 to what extent student strikers, armed mobs and migrant
 peasants are inspired by Tudeh and to what extent they are
 spontaneously motivated by legitimate grievances.  Because
 of the wide gulf which exists between the few privileged
 and the many underprivileged, there is undoubtedly great
 demand for extensive social and economic change.  Although
 actual need has probably precipitated most of the disturbances
 thus far, the growing mood of hostility toward the govern-
 ments creates a situation whit'; Tudoh, as the only group
 in Iran which can successfully appeal to mass discontent,
 may well be able to use more directly in the future,,
 Counter-Tudeh efforts by the government including pene-
 tration of the underground cellular-structure of Tudeh
 has resulted in the arrest of some cell. leaders but has
 not managed to offset the gains achieved by Tudeh.  While
 a "revolutionary situation" does not yet exist in Iran,
 the increased skill of Tudeh operations, coupled with
 increasing popular discontent, suggests that a dangerous
 situation may be in the making,

 Continued repressive measures against Communist
 activity in Iraq and Egypt make party operations exceedingly,
 difficult in those two Arab countries.  In Syria and Lebanon,

 Approved For Release 2000/08/23 : CIA-RDP67-00059AO00400160010-9
 however, government repression is less stringent in deal-
 ing with illicit Communist operations,  Recent increases
 in Communist and Soviet activity a;ithin Syria and Lebanon
 sng,rest that the decisions of the February meeting apparently
 may be beginning to be implemented in these areas, which
 provide a favorable focal point for Communist reorganization
 as well as a possible staging area for more widespread activity.
 The increase of Communist activity in Syria and
 Lebanon subsequent to the February meeting is apparently
 being carried out under direct Soviet supervision, while
 the Soviet Legation is also accelerating and reorganiziyl
 its activities within both countries,  The reported February
 meeting of Middle East Commune   leaders is said to have been
 held in the Beirut home of a member of the Soviet Legation,
 Tracts distributed by the LCP originated from a Soviet
 source.  The purging of certain persons from within the
 LOP also seems to have had the sanction of the Soviet Ixga-
 tion,  In ,Syria,, the Soviet Legation is reported to have
 increased its subsidies to the local press, and has also
 shown a marked interest in the collection of economic and
 statistical data.
 Recent Moscow broadcasts appear to reflect this
 increased interest in economic data and have stressed grow-
 ing unemployment conditions in Arab countries.  That the
 USSR is placing increasing stress on its broadcasts to the
 Middle East is indicated by the recent arrival in Mtoscovr
 of Farajallah Hillu, member of the LOP Central Committee,
 to assist in /.rabie language problems.  Meanwhile, a new
 Soviet minister, Ilya & Tavadzo, formerly First Secretary

 significant.

 INDIA
 Previous indications that the Communist Party
 of India (CPI) is in the process of a change of strategy
 from "militancy" to more peaceful methods of attaining
 Party aims are not substantiated by Cornnunist activities
 during the past month.  It is believed, however, that this
 simply means that the new policy is more difficult to
 implement than to dictate.  In recent weeks, Communist activity
 has increased in South India to such an extent that local
 officials have urged the Government of India to take steps
 to protect the populace of Andhra districts and Hyderabad
 against growing Communist violence,, which is considered
 to have passed the stage of local disorders and to have
 assumed the proportions and potency of guerrilla warfare
 against the State,  The Hyderabad State Congress has called
 for an "all-out" effort to eradicate "the Communist menace
 in the State."  Definite indications of a change in Commu-
 nist tactics may yet be forthcoming, however, as Party
 members become apprised of and conditioned to what is believed
 to be the new strategy.

 There are indications that Communism may be
 making gains among three groups in Pakistan, heretofore
 considered largely free of Communist influence,
 ao  -Peasants - A Communist-inspired meeting
 was held in the Punjab in late February, allegedly attended
 by 3.500 kisans (peasants), at which the genuine grievances
 of the kisans against the zamindaris (landlords) were aired?
 A similar meeting was held in ;.,,d in early March and there
 are reports that the Communist Sind Hari (peasant) Committee
 is gaining rapidly in strength among the peasants of that
 province.  If the government does not follow through in
 its avowed purpose of correcting the zamindari systems
 abuses, there will remain grave economic problems on which
 the Communists can be exnoctod to capitalize.
 b0  Labor Groups - Recent reports indicate
 that a probable outcome of tie annual conference at Lahore
 of the extreme left-wing Pakistan Trade Union Foderation
 will be its merger with the Trade' Union Federation Pakistan,
 an East Pakistan group comprising, in part, /x,000 members
 of the East Pakistan Seamen's League, Chittagong.  The
 Pakistan bade Union Federation is heavily infiltrated
 with Communists and maintains liaison with the World Federa-
 tion of Trade Unions,  If the merger of those.two trade
 unions occurs it may be expected that the minority of
 Communist membevs will strive to achieve control of the
 organization or at least attempt to induce it to follow a
 pro-Soviet line,
 c.  Cultural Groups - The Pakistan Civil
 Liberties Union, until now an organization in  which
 Communists and non-Communists participated on equal teri,, is
 well organized only in the Punjab.  Some of its recent state-
 ments against the "Public Safety" Acts have been issued
 jointly \vith the Progressive Writers? Association and have

 Reports indicate the Pakistan Communist Party is currently
 concentrating on taking over control of the Union and making
 it an effective Communist front organization.  Increased
 activity is also reported in the Pakistan-Soviet Cultural
 Association which ho decided to open ten branches in
 Pakistan, one of which will be in East Pakistan.
 MALAYA
 A review of terror i~. 3 operations during March
 reveals the fact that the scale of terrorist operations
 launched during that month, presumably for the purpose of
 countering the effects of the-British-sponsored tnti-Bandit-
 Month  26 February to 3 Aprils were greater than those of
 any preceeding month during the two year emergency.  Observers
 have also reporteda slight but definite-improvement in
 terrorist planning., training and tactics, particularly in
 the use of demolitions.  Furthermore, terrorist casualties
 did not increase~in proportion to their total activity
 during the month, and two harassing incidents were reported
 occurring in Singapore for the first time in almost two
 years.  The scale of the offensive and the improved technique
 apparent during these operations tend to suplDort further
 the conclusion that trained Chinese Communist agents, pre-,
 viously reported to have infiltrated Malaya in early March,
 are actively engaged within the terrorist movement.
 Terrorist attacks in Malaya have shown a marked
 increase in intensity and in number since. October 1949.
 However, those attacks reported during March represent a
 high point in their current offensive and were accomplished
 despite the fact that British security forces (about 100,000)
 were augmented during March by over 400,000 temporary
 volunteers.

 The re-entry of the Communists into Greece's
 political and economic life has been gathering momentum
 since the 1Mj4arch elections,  Two new organizations., just
 appeared, the "united front" and the anti-Fascist Youth
 Union, bear a suspicious resemblance to the outlawed EAM
 and Ei'ON, former front organization of the KKE (Communist
 Party of Greece).  KIT, proclamations appealing to special
 groups (war victims, minorities, labor and youth) are being
 circulated in various areas,,  In Athens the illegal Corulunist
 newspaper, Rizos_pastis, has reappeared after two years of
 silence.  Voices sympathetic to some of the immediate
 Communist objectives (such as a general political amnesty)
 have been found among the eighteen leftist Parliamentary
 deputies, in the new leftist Solonika newspaper, and in
 the growing group of former Communists or fellow-travellers
 now hovering on the fringes of the political world.
 In their attempts to gain ground politically,
 however, the Communists continue to face a number of handi-
 cans.  Internally, the party appears to be still hampered
 by organizational weaknesses, inadequate leadership, faulty
 discipline, and rank-and-file fear of police action.  In
 addition, the Communists still bear the stigma of having
 sponsored the three-year guerrilla war, advocated the
 territorial dismemberment of Greece, and identified them-
 selves with the hated Slavs,  The reluctance of non-Commu-
 nist leftists to cooperate openly with KKE is currently
 evident in the trade unions, where they are ostensibly
 steering independent courses in their efforts to capitalize
 on the recent labor trend, away from the right,..  A similar
 development (about which the K-,' seeris seriously concerned)
 is the effort being made by several groups, probably with
 Ti.to's secret encouragement, to foster a nationalist anti-
 Coriinform Communist movement in Greece.

 PEACE CAMPAIGN
 GENERAL
 The Communist-directed "peace campaign" reached
 unprecedented proportions during April as the major inter-
 national front organizations sought world-wide support for
 the "atomic appeal" adopted by the recent World Peace Partisans?
 Congress in Stockholm,  This appeal, for which signatures are
 being collected in almost every country, calls for unconditional
 prohibition of the atomic bomb and punishment, as a "war crim-
 inal;" of the government first using it,  The scope of the
 efforts which the Communists are making to win support for
 this drive is indicated by:   (a) the Cominform Journal's
 statement that collection of signatures for the Stockholm
 appeal is the "central task in the struggle for peace;"
 (b) Czechoslovakia's presentation to the UN and UN member
 nations of a "peace resolution" adopted by the Czech National
 Assembly in which priority is given to the demand for prohi-
 bition of atomic weapons and reduction in armaments; (c) peace
 partisan efforts to obtain signatures from French Army con--
 scripts prior to their induction;  (d) the Italian Communist
 youth movoment1s claim of half a million signatures for a
 similar "peace petition;" (a) the adoption by "peace con-
 ferences" in Norway and Australia of their own version of
 the Stockholm appeal; (f) the establishment of a Norwegian
 Peace Committee which held its first conference and instituted
 a sizeable administration to implement the peace campaign in
 Norway,,
 These efforts of the Peace Partisans to win the
 widest possible support for the Stockholm appeal appear to
 be aimed at putting the United States on the defensive on
 the atomic issue and stimulating popular war fears to the
 point of forcing a change in the position of the Western
 Governments on the control of nuclear energy.  The actions
 of the Peace Partisans will also probably be utilized by the
 USSR in the 1950 UN General Assembly in support of its

 proposals for prohibition of the atomic bomb., if the Soviet
 boycott over Chinese representatives has ended.  While such
 efforts may increase the apprehensions of atom war already
 felt by Western peoples, it is probable that they will
 generally continue to resist the attempt to turn them
 against their "wara.mongerning" governments and will recognize,
 like the Norwegian Socialists, that the real aim of such.
 peace movements is "disarmament of the democratic countries
 and rearmament of the totalitarian stateso"
 In Guatemala there has been an increasing
 flood of Communist-stimulated anti-US propaganda since
 the affiliation of Pinto Usaga's FSG (Federacian Sindical
 Guatemala) with the Confoderacion de Trabajadores de la
 Lmerica Latina; and the acceptance of labor support by
 Lt, Col? Lrbenz, leftist presidential candidate.  The
 Communist-inspired "peace" propaganda is being faithfully
 echoed, with a particularly militant tone emphasizing
 the "fight for peace',  In ad.. : ion to the usual
 denaa,ciations of "Yankee imperialism" and foreign companies,
 there are also denunciations of the atlantic and Rio
 pacts, the atomic bomb, ibe Marshall Plan, the Truman Plan
 (Point Four), and the Let of Chapultepec as "instruments
 of imperialist aggression" and ''schemes to aid anti-demo-
 cratic governments",  Although most of this propaganda
 emanates from unofficial sources, it is obvious that the
 administration not only tolerates, but also cooperates
 with anti.-US, pro.-Communist agitators.

 defeat for the PCF and PCI.  However, both parties were
 quick to point out to the pu,'_ic that the Governments felt
 compelled to use large detachments of police and troops in
 order to unload over the objections of the "peace-loving"
 neoples,  It is probable that the Communists realized that
 any interference would meet with failure and therefore
 did not attempt to force a showdown,
 In Italy, the PCI will base its main attack
 on  P.4DAP and NATO.  The stringent security measures taken
 by the government, reduce the opportunities for sabotage
 by the PCI during transshipment?
 In Franco, the PCT' does not have as fertile
 ground for future mass action, however, they will make

 NORWAY
 Despite fairly extensive plans and vociferous
 threats of action by NKP groups against I1DAP shipments,
 the first shipment arrived in Oslo and was calmly unloaded,
 to the accompaniment of only a few leaflets. Failure of
 the NKP to organize even a good-sized demonstration is-
 evidence of ito weakness in the Norwegian trade unions,.,
 and unloading of subsequent shipments  will probably be
 unhampered.,

 the orders for such dislocation, designed to prevent the
 flow of military equipment from the Western countries,
 were given by Soviet officials in secret meetings he).d
 with picked Communist trade unionists during the Peiping
 conference,  Under these orders, port and transport workers

 Singapore.  To organize worker support sufficient to
 make the--e orders effective, independent strike committees
 are to be appointed, with instructions to devise anti-

 The Socialist-dominated Trade Union Congress
 (Burma) (TUCK) has again demonstrated its deep sympathy
 for the Communist cause.  At a May Day celebration the
 TUCB leadership rammed through resolutions calling for
 affiliation with the WFTU and condemning the Burmah
 Oil Company as a "challenger of the Government, trans-
 gressor of the law and enemy of the peace,"  It also
 sent "fraternal greetings" to the USSR, WFTU and the
 All-China Fod.eration of Icbor,  While the TUCB has but
 a small dues-paying membership and is more an instrument
 for agitation than a genuine labor movement, its activities
 clearly show the affinity for Communism among elements
 now supporting the Burmese Government which can be
 easily exploited by international Communism.
