WASHINGTON, April 18?
The Central Intelligence 
Agency set up a secret base 
in the Colorado Rockies to train 
Tibetan guerrillas in mountain 
warfare in the late nineteen-

Tibet, a new book discloses. 
In the book, "The Politics of

said that the agency began

Ultra-sophisticated gadgets housed in a 
? well-guarded blockhouse-like structure at 
Wright-Patterson Air Base, near Dayton, Ohio, 
are rapidly replacing the conventional cloak-
and-dagger spy. 
Among the superspy hardware that the 
? United States is now operating is a high-speed 
computer capable of translating foreign scien-
tific and technical documents ? including Rus-
sian and Chinese ? into English at a _rate of 
305,000words an hour. 
? Another exotic unit can convert an ordinary 
snapshot of a foreign airplane into a three-di-
mensional drawing with specifcations accurate 
to less than an inch. 
Super sleuth devices are being used daily in 
the worldwide effort to gather information on 
what other countries are doing so that United 
States leaders have data they need to make 
of [times crucial decisions.. 
In this electronic age the spy who steals 
blueprints or secret plans still has a place in 
the intelligence gathering .activities, but more 
often than not his information will be obt:ained 
and confirmed by scientific instruments. 
? This worldwide intelligence gathering activ-
ity DOW is a $6 billion program for the United 
States, With-Russia probably spending an equal 
amount. 
The livelihood of thousands of Americans, 
and the success or failure of defense plans for 
years in the future depend on up-to-the-minute 
information of what other countries are doing. 
Development and production of major 
weapon systems are. stopped or started on in-
formation about what an enemy is planning. 
World technology is moving so fast that a 
major technological breakthrough in some 
.weapons can upset the world's balance of 
P0 wer. 
Perfection 'of a laser that could destroy bal-
Qstic missiles would nullify this type of 
weapon. A quick means of locating and de-
stroying submerged submarines could cripple 
a nation's sea power. 
Military planners live with the constant fear 
that an enemy will develop some new weapon 
.that they do not have. Hence they demand 
more and more data on trends that of the other 
side in its development effort, plus minute de.-
tails of equipment already in production. 
It wasn't many years ago that a photograph 
or verbal description of enemy equipment was 
the major means of gathering intelligence. 
Today these are only minor items in the fast 
flowing stream of inftiligence coming into the 
d States. 
To keep up with weapons techno  o q v 
n st rurnents s 
cret, new words ai.e , appearing in technical 
publications to show the mighty effort under 
way. 
There are now 10 of these words, each end-
int in int, for intelligence, to show the trend. 
HUMINT ? This is the human element ? 
the individuals or groups who disclose classi-
fied information intentionally or unintention? 
ally. This can be the oldtime spy, of a talkative 
scientist at an international gathering. 
ELINT ? Electronic intelligence can be col-
lected by aircraft, ships and ground stations 
that record transmissions from Other countries 
for analysis to determine the type of equip-
ment producing the signals. 
RADINT ? Radar intelligence is similar to 
Elint except that it is radar transmissions that 
are monitored. 
During the heavy bombing raids on North 
Vietnam last year day to day changes were 
made in equipment, bomber routes and tactics 
based on Radint and Elint. 
WORDINT ? This is kiformation from open 
sources such as technical publications and in-
ternational scientific meeting. The machine 
that translates Russian into English uses this 
material. 
What bothers technicians looking for good 
data from this source is when articles by an 
author-expert concerning interesting develop-
ments in a foreign country stop appearing in 
public manuscripts. This usually means his 
subject has taken on military significance and 
now is secret. 
MANY AMERICAN MILITARY EXPERTS 
are irked because one of the Soviet's newest 
fighter planes is make of large quantities of ti-
tanium, a metal that is extremely hard to 
form, but is much better than aluminum for 
high-speed aircraft. 
The American government spent millions in 
developing processes using titanium in new 
aircraft and then described them in detail in 
books that can be purchased by anyone at the 
Government Printing Office. This was to help 
American industry in using titanium 
There is considerable evidence that the Rus-
sians used this American know-how in forming 
titanium for their new fighters. 
BUNT- ? Infrared data comes from sensors 
that use bands of the light spectrum not visible 
to the human eye. These sensors can take pho-
tos day or night, had weather or good with 
data showing up that would not be seen in 
normal photography. 
Heat shows up in IR films. In Vietnam IR 
TELINT ? Telemetery is used extensively in 
relaying data on missile performance to 
ground stations during test flights. Big rockets 
can have telemetery from more than 100,dif-
ferent spots going back to the ground in a 
steady stream of data about the performance. 
It is common for Russian ships to anchor in 
the Atlantic near Cape Kennedy during missile 
launchings, presumably for intelligence collec-
tion, including Telint. 
PHOTINT ? Photographs can come from a 
wide variety of sources, including spy satel-
lites. 
ACOUSTINT ? Acoustics, or noise from 
machines, can give away detail 8 of how they 
are operating because of new advances in rec-
ording equipment and other instruments that 
can analyze these recordings. Thus details of a 
new jet engine or tank motor can be deter- . 
mined from the noise it makes. 
? 
OPTINT ? Optical intelligence is one of the 
newest means of collecting data. It comes 
from the use of laser beams that help aim mis-
siles and bombs. 
COMINT ? This is information gained from 
communications such as telephone and radio. - 
FME ? Foreign Material Equipment is the 
prize every nation is after. This is the enemy-
built tank, airplane, radar set Or other weap-
ons system that is captured or for some other 
reason is available for inspection. 
The intelligence community also is eager to 
look at commercial equipment offered for sale 
by foreign countries because often this .shows 
the state of the art that -country has i?eached 
in its production capabilities. 
The military services each have their own 
intelligence gathering agencies with the areas 
they work in well defined. Also there is the 
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). There is a 
broad exchange of datawitivi,nforrriation going 
to the National Security Council which advises 
the President. . 
The Foreign Technology Division (FTD) of the 
Air Force Systems- Command at Wright Pat-
terson is the Air Force agency.. 
Its mission is to obtain data on the actual 
and potential technological threats of foreign ? 
nations.

Counterspy Exposes 
by Dorothy McGhee 
They (the US government: CIA, police, 
,welfare officials, defense department, et 
al; and private agencies: banks, insurance 
companies etc.) have been sying and col-
lecting data on us for years without our 
knowledge. But now, we're spying on 
them and beginning to learn about the 
scope and methodology of government 
intelligence operations.. The vehicle is-a 
new group called Committee for Action?
Research on the 'Intelligence Community 
(CARIC). And they have just put out their. 
first bulletin, apPropriately called Counter-
spy which will provide monthly A source 
' of analysis and information on the prac-
tices, organization and objectives of US 
? intelligence. 
The first 22 page issue of Counterspy 
contaias some very lively information: "you can't' tell the people closest to you 
* an anonymous, but obviously well inform- what you're doing." 
Now, however, their work together on 
actively exposing US Intelligence has been 
liberating. "Being able to talk about it 
openly among ourselves has really freed 
us from alot of the fears we had," says 
Peck. All of the former agents are, of 
course, under legal constraints from dis-
closing the classified information to which 
they had access while operating in Intelli-
gence. But, as they put it, you don't 
have to reveal classified information to . 
discuss and to expose the intelligence com. 
munity. It simply gives a perspective and 
a basis of analysis." ' 
The information in Counterspy is care-
fully researched from diverse but publi-
cally Available documents: newspapers, 
congressional hearings, budgets, army re-
ports and their own anonymous sources 
The group wants to create a central Intel-
.ligence Documentation Center, which 
would centralize information on US op-
erations..They are soon coming out with 
a handbook on US intelligence which 
will describe the practical organization 
and objectives of hundreds of agencies. 
And, of course, Counterspy will come 
out monthly. 
CARIC was responsible for leaking to 
the Washington /'ost last March the infor-
mation about the Committee for the Re-
election of the President hiring a George

WILMINGTON, DELA*

Cl 
-type operations 
called embarrassing waste 
Compiled from dispatches 
WASHINGTON?Sen. William 
Proxmire, D-Wis., yesterday 
called for a drastic reduction 
in secret U.S. intelligence op-
erations overseas, estimating 
their cost at $6 billion a year 
and their value greatly exag-
gerated. 
. "Our foreign covert opera-
tions have brought little but 
embarrassment abroad and 
confusion at home," the sena-
tar said. "They should be cut 
to the hone. In the day of so-
phisticated electronic devices, 
no longer is there a sound jus-
tification for covert operations 
to defend the U.S. from sur-
prise attack." 
Proxmire, a critic of De-
fense Department spendin 
policies, also alleged that tije 
U.S. intelligence operation h 
'switched gradually from co 
le cting information to 
becoming involved in the af-
fairs of foreign countries. 
? 
"IN too many cases," he 
said, "we are substituting 
clandestine operations for , 
sound foreign policy. Further-
more, due to the 'spill-over' 
effect, it could lead to covert .1 
domestic operations." 
He said, for example, that 
the responsibilities of the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency 
have been expanded by 
"secret interpretive direc-
tives" which Congress never 
sees. 
Proxmire said the total clas-
sified intelligence budget has 
been estimated at anywhere 
from $4 billion to $8 billion, 
but that he thought $6 billion 
"is most representative." 
ALSO during the weekend, a 
study by the General Account-
ing Office was made public, 
showing that the Defense De-
partment has given away 
large amounts of surplus mili-
tary equipment to make up for 
cuts by congress in foreign 
military aid appropriations. 
The study was made for the 
Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee at the request of 
Chairman J. W. Fulbright, D-
Ark. 
Fulbright said the investiga-
tion show a need for "drastic 
overhaul of the laws control-
ling U.S. military aid policy." 
The GAO found that mili-
tary aid to? 65 foreign countries 
totaled $38.3 151ilion for fiscal 
years 1965 through 1972 and 
that grants of arms and equip-
ment classified as excess and 
loans of ships came to $2.8 bil-
lion. 
T H E auditors calculated 
that $55 million might have 
been saved in 1971 by using 
such excess stocks such as 
trucks instead of buying new 
ones to meet military aid or-
ders. 
They said the U.S. embassy 
and military mission in Tai-
wan were unable to account 
for 105 of the 146 ships loaned 
to the Republic of China since 
1954.

Where There is Success, There is Failure 
The Central Intelligence Agency is that organization that mobilizes 
the greatest amount of human and mechanical intelligence in order to 
serve its cause of world espionage. Yet some of its officials acknow-
ledge that not everything goes smoothly; winds do not always blow as 
the boats of the agency desire. One expert in Central Intelligence 
Agency affairs, Andrew Tully, says that one of the most serious reversals 
handed not only American but Western espionage came with the Iraqi 
revolution in July 1958. Tulli says of the Iraqi revolution, "Dar man 
were asleep at the time; nothing an make up for that loss. The 
Central [Intelligence] Agency suffered after this event its greatest 
humiliation when Allen Dulles had to appear before the American Senate 
to answer questions about why our men had been caught sleeping with no 
advance knowledge of Qasim's coup." The Central [Intelligence] Agency, 
nevertheless, brags a great deal about other of its victories during 
times of well-known world crises. Allen Dulles himself justifies his 
failure in the Iraqi revolution, saying that the agency had proved 
itself several weeks before the coup took place, when, in Jordan, an 
attempt at a military coup was thwarted. Among the world cries in which 
the Central Intelligence Agency has played an important role are the 
Iranian crisis in 1953, when General Mo44deq attempted to do away with 
the throne of the Shah by using a division of the Iranian army that owed 
its allegiance to Mo4iAdeq. During that crisis the Central Intelligence

Agency was the first to inform the Shah of the suspicious movements of 
Mossadeg with certain quarters hostile to the throne (among them his 
numerous meetings with the TUdeh Party) which preceded his open break 
with the Shah. 
There are also other politically valuable roles which have changed 
the course.of events in many instances, among them the difficult task 
that was undertaken by a Soviet spy working for the agency. (Allen 
Dulles gave him the name Andrei.) During the rule of Khrushchev, in 1956, 
this Soviet spy was able to deliver to the agency a copy of the secret 
speech which Khrushchev delivered to the Soviet Communist Party, and 
which was the beginning of the new policy of the Communist Party attacking 
worship of the individual and opening fire on the Stalinist era for 
the first time. At that time Khrushchev wanted to deep the speech secret 
because of his lack of caffidence as to how it would be taken by world 
public opinion, especially his attack of Stalin. He was also very 
concerned with the reaction of the Communist parties of the world. This 
speech became history the day that the Central [Intelligence] Agency gave 
out a text of it to the press, which spread it to the world. The surprise 
was out. 
The other side to success is always failure. The Central Intelligence 
Agency, in return for each victory, claims that it is inevitable that it 
meet with many defeats. There is no doubt that one of the greatest 
defeats met with by the Central Intelligence Agency was the day of the 
tri-partite agression against Egypt in 1956. During this crisis, American

Approved For Releateot001/06/09 : CIA-RDP84-09499R0010W10001-3 
intelligence was put to the test. This time, the intelligence men 
failed to send advance news of the decision of the three hostile countries 
to attack Egypt. Eisenhowever said of the Suez crisis that the only 
source from which he heard of the aggression was the press. What ib 
said about the American failure during the Suez crisis can also be said 
about the Soviet invasion of Czechoslavakial about which the government 
of the United States knew nothing, and most likely, the men of the 
Central [Intelligence] Agelacy themselves, except through the newspapers 
and radio broadcasts. 
One of the more controversial incidents in the history of the 
Central Intelligence Agency was the shooting down of a U-2 plane in 
1960 flown by a Central [Intelligence] Agency man, Francis Gary Powers. 
Another important incident arousing lengthy controversy at the 
time and even now is reverberating in the halls of the Central [Intelli-
gence] Agency, and that is the incident that took place following the , 
involvement of American intelligence with the former German general, 
James Gehlen, Itho is described as being the most competent spy in history. 
4 
He played more than one side turing the post-war era. 
The Central [Intelligence] Agency has carried out highly original 
missions. For example, during a world tour by a Soviet mission a lifelike 
model of the Sputnik spaceship was put on display. While on display in 
a Western capital, a team belonging to the Central [Intelligence] Agency 
was able to enter the exhibition room by stealth, remove the spaceship, 
disassemble it, photograph all its parts, then hand over a complete 
technical descriptio of the model. They returned the Sputnik to the hall, 
and the event went on without anyone knowing.

How Spies are Made in the American Intelligence Agency 
by Samir Hurl 
[This article is composed of selections from the book by Patrick 
J. McGarvey? CIA the Myth and the Madness. The first part of the 
article is-taken from Chapter VIII, Owe My Soul to the Company 
Store," and tells how McGarvey was recruited into the agency and 
trained. After recounting these experiences, the article discusses 
the three main targets of the American intelligence organization, 
which it takes from Chapter II, the Octopus". It covers the SAMOS 
satellites on which the CIA depends, as well as the Thor-Agena rockets, 
and then moves on to discuss COMINT and ELINT operations, all from 
the same chapter.] 
The New Director is an Expert in Nuclear Energy 
It must be pointed out, too, that the Central Intelligence Agency 
occasionally relies on outsiders for help. These persons are given the 
name of 'volunteers" since they are not paid for their labors. They 
are recruited by influential men in the agency who select these volunteers 
from among directors of large American companies, scientists, writers, 
or others who, by virtue of their jobs, travel in different countries. 
They are explained the principle of cooperating with the agency. If 
they accept, the agency provides them with a list explaining the information 
it could use. Ordinarily, the setting for these volunteers' activities is 
in Third World countries and Eastern Europe.

Among the most recent developments which has occured anong the 
higher branches of the Central Intelligence Agency was James Schlesinger's 
taking over last month the task of heading the agency fram his predecessor, 
Richard Helms. It did not take Schlesinger long before he began to make 
radical changes in the Central [Intelligence] Agency. He took it upon 
himself to dismiss three of the agency's top officials. Immediately 
after that, a great fear took hold of the souls of all division heads 
and top men working forthe agency. Mumblings began to be heard in the 
political quarters of Washington concerning decisive other changes to 
which Schlesinger might resort. An important man in the agency commented 
on these changes saying that Schlesinger's dismissal of these three 
employees is an action with far-reaching consequences and extremely 
serious. He said, "Heads of other important men have rolled in the 
past. However, this time, things are different. Schlesinger has . 
carried out the matter very rapidly and has chosen three men considered 
the most important pillars of the agency, the furthest removed from 
suspicion." 
While some American circles are surprised at the speed with which 
Schlesinger moved, the circles of President Nixon appear to be completely 
'satisfied with the rapidity of change. The basic reason behind this 
satisfaction may go back to the fact that Nixon had commissioned Helms 
more than a year ago to determine the agency's course of action and 
regulate its espenses, which amount to six billion dollars annually. 
At that time, Richard Helms was not able to meet the demands of the 
American president completely. What made things even worse is that

Approved For Release A1/06/09 : CIA-RDP84N0499R0010001301-3 
Helms belongs to the Democratic Party, and so does not enjoy mentionable 
support from the White House. Eighty per cent of the agency's human and 
financial resources are controlled and its affairs conducted by the 
Secretary of Defense. It has become known now by all that Laird and 
Helms were constantly in dispute over diffeiret estimates and opinions 
connected with the intelligence agency. 
The new director, Schlesinger, has no former experience in the 
field of intelligence except for his having shown administrative skill 
when he headed the Atomic Energy Commission in the United States. James 
Schlesinger is a man of greater determination and firmness than Helms. 
He also excels him in following a conservative political policy. Informed 
.sources sr that Schlesinger's dismissal of three top officials does 
. not at all mean that he is resolved to do away with most of the agency's 
old timers. These circles demonstrate their viewpoint by pointing out 
that Schlesinger put in the place of one of the dismissed old timers 
another old times, 53 years old, who entered the agency 23 years ago.

THE EVENING STAR and DAILY NEWS 
Washington, D. C., Monday, April 30, 1973 
A-15 
CHARLES BARTLETT 
Sihanouk's War With CIA 
With the enemy knocking on 
the gates of Phnom Penh, Lon 
Nol's grudging acceptance of 
a conciliatory council has the 
look of a reform that has. 
come too late. ? 
Lon Nol is taking help 
where he can get it, and his 
belated agreement to readmit 
Sink Matak to the leadership 
council is combined with some 
strenuous overtures to the 
Soviets. It is a crowning irony 
of Southeast Asia's complex 
diplomacy that a leader who 
wears the brand of an Ameri-
can puppet should reach for a 
lifeline from the Kremlin. 
The Soviets have, it turns 
out, been just as wrong as the 
Americans in calling the turn 
on Cambodia. It was probably 
because they desired to ac-
commodate President Nixon 
and lacked a clear view of the 
Cambodian peasant mentali-
ty. So they left Prince Sihan-
ouk to the mercies of the 
Chinese with confidence that 
he would find no warmth in 
Peking. But-Mao and Chou 
En-lai shrewdly treated the 
god-king like a prince while 
they enabled him to become 
an effective guerrilla leader. 
So the actual hope now is 
not that Lon Nol's new council 
will manage to assert Its au-
thority over Cambodia. It is 
more realistic to hope that the 
council can become the in-
strument for a negotiated set-
Will rinItl n 
government with some bal-
ance in its future outlook. But 
even this may be wishful be-
cause Sihanouk has written 
that he will never enter "any 
coalition or other 
compromise" with the Lon 
Nol group. 
Sihanouk supplies this and 
other timely insights in a new 
book called "My War with the 
' CIA." While the prince writes 
with paranoiac intensity 
about the harassments he has 
allegedly suffered from Amer-
ican intelligence, he writes 
with the clarity of a brilliant 
politician about the forces at 
work in Cambodia and why 
the Nixon doctrine has not 
found this to be favorable ter-
rain. 
An important fact illuminat-
ed by the book is the resilient 
, nature of Sihanouk himself. 
Originally enthroned by the 
French, who mistook him for 
a malleable lamb, he commit-
ted him.self to the tradition of 
his namesake grandfather, a 
fervent champion of Cambodi-
an independence. The passion 
of Sihanouk's ambition to 
keep his people free of foreign 
yokes is attested to by the 
major moves of his career. 
This was why, after forcing 
out the French, he gave up 
the throne in 1955. Ile felt sti-
fled by the sycophancy of 
court life and unable to lead 
or stimulate the nation. He 
eliminated the U.S. aid pro-
gram in 1963 because he be-
lieved it was corrupting the 
people and impinging upon his 
options. Ile broke with the 
United States over a military 
encroachment on his territory 
and risked his standing with 
tho North Viettinti-Wile to Ivo-
test their troops' use of his 
sanctuary. 
He has pursued independ-
ence with a defiant spirit be-
cause his outlook, like his 
people's, has been shaped by 
, 2,000 years of vulnerability. 
He seemed in 1971 to have 
hurt his prospects of regain-
ing power by relying on the 
North Vietnamese army. But 
he seems to have been vindi-
cated by Lon Nol's far greater 
reliance on American bomb-
ers along with South Vietnam-
ese and Thai soldiers. "Lon 
Nol has been," Sihanouk 
writes, "our best recruiting 
officer." 
Sihanouk is not, by his own 
testimony, making his way 
back in order to serve as a 
Communist puppet. Ile writes 
of "neutrality with nuances" 
as his objective in foreign pol-
icy. This apparently means he 
will play the game as he did 
before his overthrow, larding 
his neutrality with manifesta-
tions of a clear preference for 
his strong Communist neigh-
bors. 
Ile wants to preside over a 
Socialist, egalitarian society 
which will not be Communist. 
lie appears bent on recreat-
ing a social structure much 
like the one he left in 1970. Ile 
believes in private property 
for the pheasants and nation-
alization for industry. Ile will 
be wary of Japan's economic 
penetartion because, as he 
writes, "the only real guaran-
tee for maintaining non-align-
ment is to neutralize the 
forces of internal reaction." 
This was the weakness of 
the faction on which the 
Americans and Soviets bet. It 
rnitftIntitilpil the forces of in-
ternal reaction. It was a poor 
choice, and its blatant failure 
makes it important to hope 
.that the U.S. government, 
despite Sihanouk's allega-
tions, had nothing to do with 
the machinations which 
brought it to power.

ARE BEING SHAKEN UP 
Drastic changes are aimed at 
ending rivalries and improving 
the usefulness of U. S. intelli-
gence. One result: Some inner 
workings are being disclosed. 
The supersecret U. S. intelligence ap-
paratus is being rocked from within on 
a scale never before so visible to the 
public. 
What set off the tremor is a major 
overhaul, now in progress, of the ma-
chinery that produces the worldwide 
intelligence assessments on which crucial 
national decisions are based. 
Under James R. Schlesinger, the new 
Director of the Central Intelligence 
Agency and overseer, also, of the vast 
U. S. information-gathering network?mil-
itary as well as civilian?significant 
changes are being made. They have 
these objectives: 
? To shake up the whole system and 
sharply improve its usefulness to the 
President and his top advisers. 
? To process vital intelligence more 
effectively, at less cost. 
Mr. Schlesinger cracked down on 
CIA, his home base, first. Now he is 
expected to focus on other parts of the 
intelligence community?military and 
civilian. 
Payroll reductions. In the reorga-
nization process, wholesale firings have 
occurred at the CIA?a cutback, sources 
say, of perhaps more than 1,000 of the 
agency's estimated 15,000 employes. 
Some professionals assert that Mr. 
Schlesinger is bent on rooting out an 
"intellectually arrogant" clique that has 
been riding high in the CIA hierarchy 
for years. 
Others counter that the chief purpose 
of the housecleanings is to enable the 
Nixon Administration to "politicize" the 
intelligence mechanism to its own ideo-
logical shape?and use Mr. Schlesinger 
to do it. 
Both charges are vigorously denied 
by responsible people on all sides. In-
stead, the charges are cited as examples 
of the bitter bureaucratic infighting go-
ing on in Washington?and spreading 
into the intelligence system. 
On one front, heated feuding between 
the CIA and the Pentagon's Defense In-
telligence Agency?DIA?is out in the 
open. 
78 14?"WrroilYN_ 1G7-
Pentagon intelligence specialists, trying 
to regain control of assessing military 
threats to the U. S,, are citing what they 
characterize as examples of blunders and 
bias by the CIA. 
The military critics admit that their 
own mistakes a decade and more ago 
obliged the Government to turn to the 
civilian CIA for the main assessments 
on military threats. But now, the mili-
tary men contend that DIA has been 
revamped, is more objective?and less of 
a lobby designed to scare Congress into 
voting higher defense budgets. 
Against that background of turbu-
lence, Mr. Schlesinger is moving to 
carry out the sweeping reorganization 
of the U. S. intelligence community orig-
inally ordered by President Nixon a 
year and a half ago?in November, 1971. 
Knowledgeable sources say that Rich-
ard Helms, now Ambassador to Iran, 
was replaced by Mr. Schlesinger as CIA 
Director because he failed to carry out 
the overhaul mandate to Mr. Nixon's 
satisfaction. 
A top man in the intelligence network 
put it this way: "The President and his 
national-security adviser, Henry Kis-
singer, just didn't think they wore getting 
their money's worth." 
The reorganization plan, in fact, is 
Mr. Sehlesinger's own handiwork. He 
drafted it while serving as Assistant 
Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget. Later, lie was named 
Chairman of the Atomic Energy Com-
mission?the job from which he was 
transferred to his present post as Amer-
ica's "superspy." 
Like Mr. Helms before him, Mr. 
Schlesinger is not only Director of the 
CIA but also Director of Central Intel-
ligence?DCI. That makes him boss of 
all American intelligence operations. 
New faces. One thing that Mr. 
Schlesinger has done is to put together 
what he calls the intelligence communi-
ty staff, with offices on the top floor of 
the CIA headquarters building in a 
Virginia suburb of Washington.

CIA Director James R. Schlesinger, who

experts have been assigned to that staff

Maj. Gen, Lew Allen, of the Air Force, 
who has been nominated for promotion 
to lieutenant general. The other is Maj.

advocating reassertion of a dominant 
role for the military in estimating security

ed the blackest possible picture of the 
present Brazilian Government, making 
Brazil look like an imminent threat to 
the' U. S. If the President had acted on 
that report, he would have cut all aid 
to Brazil." 
? The CIA is accused of failing to 
use information it had in hand to alert 
the White House to Russia's acute food 
shortage last year. The point made is 
that the Soviets were able to negotiate 
a billion-dollar grain deal with the 
U. S. on terms favorable to the Krem-
lin?and unfavorable to the American 
housewife, who had to pay more for 
bread. 
The CIA answers this charge by con-
tending that the information was passed 
along to the Department of Agriculture, 
which, in the CIA view, failed to act 
on it promptly enough. 
? A military intelligence official says 
that before the Soviet invasion of Czech-
oslovakia in 1968, the CIA director of 
estimates offered a report prepared for 
the President saying there would be no 
invasion. An aide, disagreeing, used 
various stratagems to avoid forwarding 
the report. The delay prevented embar-
rassment for the CIA when the Russians 
did invade, but, according to the 
source, the aide who blocked 
the erroneous estimate "won 
no friends." 
? In Vietnam, it is now 
revealed, CIA and DIA were 
often at odds. For instance, 
they agreed that some Com-
munist arms were reaching 
South Vietnam through the 
Cambodian port of Sihanouk-
vile, but both were "wildly 
wrong" on how much. But an 
official, not in intelligence, 
recalls that CIA was "much 
further wrong" than DIA?al-
though each was on the low 
side. 
? Another charge by critics of the 
CIA: After the Tet offensive of 1968, 
CIA reported Communists had seized 
vast portions of the countryside, because 
contact was lost with most sources out-
side the cities. This assumption was dis-
proved by on-the-spot checks by DIA 
teams in helicopters. 
An illustration of conflict between 
civilian and military analysts: 
In a recent national estimate, the 
CIA took the position that Japan would 
never consider arming itself with nuclear 
weapons. The DIA argued that the Jap-
anese were keeping abreast of nuclear 
technology and would not hesitate to 
"go nuclear" if Tokyo felt that was 
necessary for survival. 
When the document was brought to 
Mr. Schlesinger, an insider says, the 
CIA analysts emphasized that they had 
put their views first, as the current 
position, and the DIA estimates were 
relegated to the back pages. Mr. Schles-
inger was said to have,"hit the roof" and 
to have ordered that the military view 
be given equal prominence. 
? General Graham, in his writing in 
"Army" magazine, admits serious DIA 
shortcomings in the past. He charges 
that Pentagon intelligence has damaged 
its own status by inflating its estimates 
of threats to the "worst case" possible?

in order to get more money from Con-
gress. He claims that this tendency has 
been largely eliminated. 
? General Graham also charges that, 
in the past, military intelligence has 
been too prone to tailor its assessments 
to the need "users" have for intelli-
gence that "supports the program." 
Assessing blame. In some instances, 
blame is being heaped upon both civil-
ian and military intelligence agencies. 
One thing pointed out is that the entire 
U. S. intelligence community?despite 
warnings from some agents?refused to 
believe that Soviet boss Nikita Khrush-
chev would dare to risk putting offen-
sive missiles in Cuba in 1962. 
Khrushchev did just that, however, 
and the "missile crisis" resulted. 
Some of the military intelligence ex-
perts now insisting on a stronger voice 
in the evaluation of raw data concede 
that, in the past, the armed forces have 
been supplied with exaggerated esti-
mates of the Soviet threat?such as the 
"missile gap" of a decade ago that 
turned out to be nonexistent. 
It is pointed out, however, that the 
DIA has had a thorough housecleaning 
in recent years. 
"Time to reassert." In his article 
for "Army" magazine, General Graham 
wrote: 
?`. . . I think the time is ripe for the 
military profession to reassert its tradi-
tional role in the function of describing 
military threats to national security. Both 
the military user and the military pro-
ducer of strategic intelligence have 
come a long way since the 'missile gap' 
days. DIA has hit its stride in the pro-
duction of respectable military esti-
mates." 
Many CIA professionals in top and 
middle ranks are unhappy about the

present intelligence as it "To be continued." Some projects 
is, rather than as the situa-
tion is seen by those sup-
porting specific policies, 
are being plucked out." 
Aides of Mr. Schlesinger 
deny that he has any inten-
tion of "politicizing" the 
agency. They point out 
that at his confirmation 
hearing before the Senate 
Armed Services Commit-
tee he said he was deter-
mined to maintain the in-
dependence and integrity 
of intelligence evaluations. 
Within the Nixon Ad-
ministration, dissatisfaction with the CIA 
has centered particularly in the Na-
tional Security Council staff, which is 
under the direction of Mr. Kissinger. 
The main complaint has been that 
evaluations of raw intelligence often re-
flected the biases of top men. 
To that, one CIA man retorts: 
"We feel that we do a better job of 
evaluating raw intelligence without bias 
than the military does?or, for that mat-
ter, than people like Kissinger who are 
defending a specific policy." 
The argument is made that?particu-
larly since the days when the late Allen 
Dulles was its Director?the CIA's "con-
trolling voice" in the intelligence com-
munity has sought intelligence estimates 
unaffected by the policies of the Ad-
ministration in power, the Pentagon, the 
so-called military-industrial complex, or 
any other group. 
Changes in the works. Whatever 
the merits of the arguments now boil-
ing, drastic changes are being made by 
Mr. Schlesinger. 
They include: 
1. To reduce costs, overlapping intel-
ligence agencies are to submit "bids" on 
operations that are assigned by President 
Nixon and the National Security Coun-
cil. The Intelligence Resources Advisory 
Committee, set up under the 1971 re-
organization plan, is to consider the 
competing "bids" and accept the least 
expensive if the bidder can . convince 
the Committee that his agency can do 
the job. 
2. Mr. Schlesinger is making it clear 
that he will exercise fully his authority 
over all of the intelligence services. In 
the past, this has been a difficult prob-
lem for the Director of Central 
Intelligence, because the Defense De-
partment gets most of the money and 
most of the manpower. 
3. As DCI, Mr. Schlesinger will de-
cide which of the U. S. intelligence agen-
cies?military and civilian?will carry out 
operations assigned by the White House. 
are being phased out as inefficient or 
outmoded. One report indicated a sharp 
curtailment in clandestine operations. 
But an insider commented: 
"They may not talk about these as 
much as they (lid, but like it or not, 
these activities are part of the way of 
life in the world today, and they will 
be continued." 
One revision put into effect, by Mr. 
Schlesinger has to do with preparation 
of CIA reports requested by the Presi-
dent and other high officials. 
Condensed intelligence. Previously, 
such requests were answered with de-
tailed studies-20, 30, or even 50 pages 
long. Now, the reports run no longer 
than three double-spaced pages. A CIA 
official explained: 
"Instructions from Schlesinger are to 
answer the questions asked?and no 
more. No background. No historical dis-
cussion. just keep in mind that the 
President or the Secretary of the Treas-
ury or whoever else asks the questions 
is a busy man. He rarely has time to 
read long reports. What he needs is 
for use right now?today?in order to 
make a decision." 
The telephone number of the analyst 
or working group responsible for the re-
port appears on the document, so if 
more information is needed, it can be 
obtained without delay. 
In line with Mr. Nixon's efforts to re-
duce federal spending, the intelligence 
agencies are under orders to reduce 
costs. 
Just how much is being spent to piece 
together the information essential to na-
tional security is not a matter of public 
knowledge. 
A 6.2 billion cost? Senator William 
Proxmire (Dom.), of Wisconsin, esti-
mated recently that the cost of gather-
ing military and civilian intelligence is 
6.2 billion dollars a year. But Albert C. 
Hall, Assistant Defense Secretary for 
Intelligence, said that Mr. Proxmire's 
figure is "just plain wrong." 
Without hinting at the actual figures, 
Mr. Hall said that the Pentagon's int& 
ligence budget has been cut by about a 
third in the last three years. 
Other sources say that manpower in 
the CIA and the other intelligence serv-
ices, including the National Security 
Agency, now totals less than 125,000?
a reduction of more than 25,000 since 
1971. 
Thus, a money crunch and diminished 
manpower are added problems at a time 
of sharp change and open conflict for 
the agencies which function as the "eyes 
and ears" of the United States around 
the world. [END]

In /long Kong, an agent of the U.S.

17HESE are only a few of myriad mis-

around; the world. The agency is also 
constantly accused of fantastic James

not it has nothing to do with. The fact 
is that no nation can any longer:accept 
Secretary of State Henry Samson's 
bland dictum of 1929 that "gentlemen 
do not read other people's mail." In a 
nuclear-ringed globe, intelligence is 
more vital than ever. Nor can a world . 
power automatically limit itself to such 
a passive role as mere information gath-

times be necessary. But it can no long-

International Telephone and Telegraph 
Corp. to sow economic chaos in Chile

and yet utilize its immense capabilities 
for keeping the U.S. abreast of world de-
velopments; the ;Nixon Administration 
has ordered the greatest reorganization 
in the agency's 25-year history.

matic Editor Jerrold Schecter, who has 
; been keeping a watch on the CIA: "For 
the first time since its founding the CIA 
is undergoing a thorough shakeup of 
personnel and redirection of mission. 
The two main targets of U.S. intelli-
gence activities continue to be the So-
viet Union and China. But a rapidly de-
veloping detente with those countries 
E has created different demands on the in-
telligence establishment. Along with 
traditional estimates of the missile and 
; military capabilities of Communist 
countries, the White House is insisting 
on a new' 'emphasis on assessments of 
their political and strategic intentions. 
The entire intelligence estimating pro-
cess is being refined to include more 
stress on such developments as Soviet 
; and Chinese grain outputs and comput-
er advances."

Gmcth Cub 
in February took over as director of the 
CIA. Aides quote Schlesinger as saying 
that "the entire intelligence community 
can produce a better product with a low-
er level of resources." In short, the na-
tion's spy network should generate bet-
ter intelligence for less money. 
Schlesinger has ordered the firing or 
forced retirement of 600 of the CIA's 
18,000 worldwide employees; 400 more 
are expected to go by year's end. His 
aim is to cut costs, eliminate marginal 
performers, and change the leadership 
of the agency. Among those who have 
gone are several of the long-entrenched 
top deputies of former cm Director 
Richard Helms, who tended to favor the 
"operational men," or spies in the field,. 
over the cerebral analysts, who ponder 
the intelligence and make policy rec-
ommendations. These two sides of the 
agency, traditionally separated, have or-
ders to cooperate more. 
Paramilitary operations are being 
scaled down. In South Viet Nam, the 
CIA's role in the "Phoenix"?or coun-
terterror?program has already been 
phased out. The program used CIA 
agents to advise the South Vietnamese 
in the "neutralization," or killing, of 
Viet Cong officials. Such covert activ-
ities arc under the CIA's deputy direc-
tor of operation-s, currently William 
Colby, 53, a former ambassador who 
was in charge of pacification in Viet 
Nam from 1969 to mid-1971. 
Often called the agency's "dirty 
tricks department," Colby's section con-
trols field agents who are involved in 
clandestine activities, including keeping 
a watch on the KGB (Soviet intelligence) 
and working with intelligence organi-
zations in Western countries. But Col-
by's group is now placing new empha-

Belgian diplomats in Khartoum two 
months ago. It also knows the financial 
sources of the Black Septernbrists, who 
carried out those assassinations, as well 
as the murders of Israeli athletes at the 
Munich Olympics. 
Rivalry. With the downgrading of 
cloak-and-dagger operations,. one of 
Schlesinger's tasks will be the strength-
ening of the "leadership for the lintel-
ligencel community as a whole," a rec-
ommendation that he himself urged on 
the President in 1971, when he was an 
assistant director of the Office of Man-
agement and Budget. Now, Schlesinger 
not only heads the CIA but also has ul-
timate responsibility for the I entagon s 
Defense Intelligence Agency, which 
provides intelligence for the armed 
forces, and the National Security Agen-
cy, which directs spy planes, satellites 
and a vast communications-monitoring 
apparatus that cracks Codes and gath-
ers data from other countries. 
Schlesinger, as chairman of the In-
telligence Resources Advisory Commit-
tee, will be taking a hard look at the 
combined $6.2 billion (some estimates 
put it as high .as $8 billion) spent by the 
three agencies. Nearly half of the mon-
ey goes for satellite reconnaissance and 
spy planes; about $750 million is bud-
geted to the CIA. 
Schlesinger also must watch out for 
a smoldering rivalry between the CIA 
and the DIA. The rivalry broke out in 
the open recently in the form of an ar-
ticle in the small (circ. 75,000) month-
ly magazine Army, written by Major 
General Daniel 0. Graham last Decem-
ber?before he was picked by Schle-
singer to be a member of his five-man 
Intelligence Resources Advisory Com-
mittee. Graham's article contended that 
the Pentagon should win back from the' 
CIA. primary responsibility 
for analyzing strategic mili-
tary intelligence. To the em-
barrassment of military lead-
ers, he conceded that in the 
past the Pentagon's estimates 
of Communist military po-
tential were vastly ora.rstat-
ed, and that the nation's de-
cision makers rightly regard-
ed those estimates as "self-
serving, budget-oriented and 
generally inflated." But, he 
wrote, the Pentagon has so 
greatly reformed and .im-
?proved its analysis in recent 
?years that there will be no 
more "bad overestimates" 
_like "bomber gaps," "missile 
gaps," and "megaton gaps."

Inducing constructive tensions. 
Helms, CIA analysts had remained aloof 
from the military, and there were bit-
ter battles between the CIA and DIA dur-
ing the Viet Nam War over estimates 
of enemy infiltration and intentions. 
To increase accountability within the 
agency, Schlesinger has told CIA's 
analysts to sign all their intelligence 
reports. He hopes that bylines on 
the blue and white-covered CIA assess-
ments will sharpen analyses and make 
the authors feel personally responsible 
for their assessments. 
Schlesinger seems just the man to 
shake up the CIA. A seasoned scholar, 
bureaucrat and Republican, he enjoys 
the confidence of President Nixon. He 
was graduated sumina cum laude from 
Harvard ('50), later got his Ph.D. in eco-
nomics there, taught at the University 
of Virginia, and was director of stra-
tegic studies at the Rand Corp. He 
joined the old Bureau of the Budget in 
1969, and two years later was named 
chairman of the Atomic Energy Com-
mission. His prodding of utility exec-
utives to pay more attention to envi-
ronmental safeguards impressed the 
President. When industry leaders 
complained. Schlesinger told them: 
"Gentlemen, I'm not here to protect 
your triple-A bond ratings." 
While maintaining traditional secre-
cy about clandestine operations, Schle-
singer is moving fast to lift the veil of 
conspiracy that has shrouded the agen-
cy. In an unprecedented move last 
month, he allowed a CIA agent, William 
Broe,...the former chief of clandestine 
operatiOns for the Western Hemisphere, 
to testify before a Senate subcommittee 
investigating the involvement of the CIA 
and the International Telephone and

Star-News Staff Writer 
:mcs R. Schlesinger, thei 
ww director of Central Intel-
ligence, is giving the military 
a stranger role in assessing 
ifireats posed by other coun-
tries, 'according to the 
pentagon's top civilian 
intelli-
nce official. 
.7 Albert C. Hall, assistant 
defense secretary for intelli-
gence, acknowledged in a in-
terview yesterday that "some 
of the civilians up the river" 
lit the Central Intelligence 
Agency) are quite concerned 
by the new development. 
? Ain Hall, who was brought 
'into the Pentagon by Defense 
Secretary Melvin R. Laird 
two .years ago to strengtheni 
civilian control over intelli-
gence, said he thinks what 
Schlesinger is doing "is really 
Clint? sound." 
? 'SCHLESINGER, who drew 
up a plan for revamping the 
intelligence community when 
he was at the Office of Man-
agement and Budget in 1971, 
has placed two career sol-
diers on his personal staff, 
"Maj. Gen. Lew Allen, a 
West Pointer who holds a 
doctor's degree in physics and 
who has been active in Air 
Force nuclear and space pro-
graft, became one of 
?eblesinger's deputies "for 
JAMES R. SCHLESINGER 
the intelligence community" 
on March 1. He was nominat-
ed yesterday for promotion to 
lieutenant general. Maj. Gen. 
Daniel G. Graham, a career 
intelligence office who is now 
deputy director for estimates 
in the Defense Intelligence 
Agency, is scheduled to be-
come a deputy to Schlesinger 
May 1. 
While Schlesinger is report-
edly embarking on a house 
cleaning to cut about a 1,000 
persons from the CIA payroll 
of about 15,000, he has given 
his stamp of approval ? at 
least for the time being ? to 
the military intelligence oper-
ation, Ilall said. 
"I have told the DCI 
(Schlesinger) what we are 
doing, what our objectives-
are, and how we are going 
about researching them in a 
broad sense ?and he's en-
dorsed them," Hall said. 
TIM; DIA, the key Pentagon 
intelligence office, underWent 
a house cleaning of its own ' 
beginning in 1970, when Lt. 
Gen. Donald V. Bennett be-
came its director. The entire 
defense intelligence communi-
ty has received a further 
shaking up under Hall. 
Over the years, there has 
been a tendency to downgrade 
the military estimate of ' the 
threat from other countries ? 
primarily the Soviet Union ? 
and for the civilian analysis of 
the CIA to be predominant, 
Hall said. 
"On the civilian side ? up 
the river ? they were more 
inclined to regard the Soviet 
Union as a more peaceful ent-
ity than it actually is. Their 
tendency is to regard what 
they (the Soviets) do as a 
reaction to us," Hall said. 
The military picture tends 
to make the Soviets look like 
the fierce guys, and that 
we've got to catch up, he said. 
"In analysis of the Soviet 
Union, one was too far on one 
. are involved. He did say, 
however, that an estimate by 
Sen. William Proxmire, D-
Wis., that the nation's annual 
intelligence bill is $6.2 billion 
is just plan wrong. , 
PROXMIRE SAID yester-
(lay his figijfS were "in_the 
roved For 
ITS/LIC- 3-0 
side, the other too far on the 
other side. I don't want to 
overstate this, because it was 
not that bad a situation. But it 
would be better if they both 
moved toward the middle," 
Hall said. 
VVIIILE the different inter-
pretations seemed to provide 
a broad range of views, the 
opposite was often the case, 
, Hall said. Graham, in an arti-

"planners of all services

The goal now, Hall said, is

"It is important to get the

Unfortunately, he added, 
many of those who receive the

would rather have a specific 
figure than a range of

HALL ALSO STRESSED, 
throughout the interview, that 
he is seriously concerned 
about the nation's intelligence

years, he said, the Pentagon's

cut about a third.

Associated Press , 
Sen. William Proxmire (D-

intelligence community em-
ploys about 148,000 persons' 
and spends about $6.2, billion 
each year. 
Renewing his call for dras-

ties overseas, Proxmire urged 
James Schlesinger, new Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency, Di-
rector, to make public the gov-
ernment's entire intelligence 
budget, which has always been 
secret. 
Proxmire said he is not op-
posed to a first-rate American

does believe that the intel-

swollen out of proportion to 
national , defense needs and 
that congressional controls 
and restraints on it have 
eroded.

Asks Cut in 
U.S. Spying 
United Press International 
Sen. William Proxmire, D-
Wis., has called for a drastic 
reduction in secret U. S. intel-
ligence operations overseas, 
estimating their cost at $6 bil-
lion a year and saying their 
value is greatly exaggerated. 
"Our foreign covert opera-
tions have brought little but 
embarrassment abroad and 
confusion at home," he said 
?yesterday. "They should be 
cut to the bone. In the day of 
sophisticated electronic de-
vices, no longer is there a 
sound justification for covert 
operations to defend the U. S. 
from surprise attack." 
Proxmire, who is also a 
leading congressional critic of 
Defense Department spending 
policies, alleged that the U. S. 
intelligence operation had 
switched gradually from col-
lecting information to becom-
ing involved in the affairs of 
foreign countries, and ex-
pressed fear this could be a 
possible prelude to similar 
tactics in this country. 
"In too many cases," he 
said, "we are substituting 
clandestine operations for 
sound foreign policy. Further-
more, due to the 'spill-over' 
effect, it could lead to covert 
domestic operations." 
He said that, for example, 
the responsibilities of the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency have 
been expanded by "secret 
interpretive directives" 
whieh Congress never sees. 
In a statement issued from 
his office, Proxmire recom-
mended steps which he said 
would permit trimming as 
much as $1 billion from the 
intelligence budget.

Bureaucracy Engulfs Wounded Knee 
By Jack Anderson 
The bureaucratic build-up 
'outside Wounded Kneels a 
testament to the government's 
way 'of doing things.. No less 
than 400 federal officials have 
descended upon the small 
South Dakota village to nego-
tiate, mediate, consult and oc-
casionally exchange gunfire 
with the Indian occupiers. 
Cost to the' takpayers: around 
$2.7' million. 
Yet at this writing, the Indi-
ans remain armed and angry, 
Take the problem of road-
blocks, for example. The daily 
crisis reports from Wounded 
Knee, intended for Justice De-
partment eye's only, tell how 
armed local residents threw 
up their own vigilante road-
block. Assistant Attorney Gen-
eral J. Stanley Pottinger "met 
with them at the roadblock 
shortly after it was established 
but failed to talk it down," de-
clares a crisis report. 
Next clay, the vigilante 
group refused to 'allow the 
Community Relations Serv-
ice's peace-keeping team into 
Woubtled Knee, While "no 
CRS personnel were in 
Wounded Knee" to restrain 
the militants, a "most serious 
incident" took place. Accord-
ing to a report, the incident 
"involved the alleged looting 
of a rancher's home and cattle 
by WK (Wounded Knee) occu-
pants." Three days later seri-
ous shooting broke out, and 
one militant Indian was crit-
ically injured. 
Still, Pottinger took no ac-
tion against the unauthor12ed 
roadblock. "Pottinger has indi-
cated to CRS and at staff 
briefings,' states a report, 
"that he' is inclined to arrest 
the leaders of the roadblock, 
but most other agencies advise 
against it for purposes of pub-
lic relations or convenience." 
? Explaining what is meant by 
"convenience," the report tells 
of "a planned .march on WK 
by clergymen and others 
(Easter) weekend. The govern-
ment would rather have the 
marchers detained by a citi-
zens' roadblock than by an 
FBI one." 
The Easter march fizzled, 
and Pottinger finally ordered 
the roadblock removed. But 
meanwhile, he was having 
trouble with the government's 
own roadblocks. He obtained 
an order from Wshington to 
put all federal roadblocks and 
bunkers under the command 
of U.S. marshals. 
"Previously," notes a report, 
"the marshals, the FBI and 
the MA police each manned 
their own units, and it was dif-
ficult to verify and control the 
repeated incidents of federal 
vehicles and troops (mostly 
FBI and BIA police) moving 
into the WK perimeter." 
The CRS peace-keeping 
team has now returned to 
Wounded Knee. But the Indi-
ans and the federal officers 
are still manning their armed 
bunkers. As one federal offi-
i ? 
cial put it, "We're now back to 
zero again." 
Military Martinet 
Maj. Gen. Daniel Graham, a 
short, ramrod-straight authori-
tarian, is moving from the De-
fense Intelligence Agency to 
the Central Intelligence 
Agency to take charge of stra-
tegic estimates. 
He has already alarmed CIA 
hands by writing in Army 
Magazine that vital security 
estimates should be made by 
military analysts, although he 
acknowledges that DIA esti-
mates have been slanted in 
the past to please the Penta-
gon bosses and the CIA esti-
mates have been more accu-
rate. 
The alarm hasn't been al, 
layed any by reports reaching 
CIA headquarters of his con-
duct as head of the Wakefield 
(Va.) High School PTA. 
He circulated a memo, for 
example, urging that five 
teachers be fired and eight 
others be enlisted as inform-
ers. He wanted them to keep 
an eye on suspicious teachers 
and students. The Graham fac-
tion also brought pressure to 
oust the school's able princi-
pal, who finally left voluntar-
ily, 
In one stormy PTA meeting 
after another, Graham has 
fought student privileges in-
cluding the right to partici-
pate fully, in PTA activities. 
So vehement is he at PTA 
meetings that some neighbor-
hood government officials are 
afraid to argue with him for 
fear he'll retaliate against 
them ? in their jobs. In re-
sponse to our inquiries, Gra-
ham sent word through his 
secretary that he, wouldn't 
speak with us. 
Inside North' Korea?Vii-? 
tors just back from North Ko-
rea remind us that Kim .11 
Sung's Red regime is still one 
of the most oppressive on 
earth. They describe the towns 
as drab, the social life as ste-
rile, the people as regimented 
and the atmosphere as harsh. 
Individually, the North Kore-
ans were friendly and curious. 
But in the presence ? of others, 
they became' stiff and strident. 
Their private opinions sud-
denly ? conformed to the rigid 
official line.- North and South 
Korean delegations, mean- ? 
while, are preparing for an-
other round of negotiations. 
Sikkim Strife ? Hush-hush - 
reports smuggled out of the 
Himalayan kingdom of Sikkim 
charge that India is financing 
riots against the regime of 
King Palden Thondup Nam-
gyal as part of a plot to take 
full control of his land. The 
dashing king became a special 
favorite of Americans when he 
married a pretty New Yorker, 
hope Cooke. Lately, demon-
strations have shaken his mon-
archy, and Indian troops have 
crossed the border "in the in-
terest of law and order." Insid-
ers close to the royal family 
have gotten word to . us that, 
even as the troops moved in, 
Indian political officer K.S. 
Bajpai began to pressure the 
king to "hand over all power" 
to India

By DOANE IIELICK 
Congress and the executive 
branch of the government 
should exercise virogous con-
trol over the nation's in-
stelligence-gathering agencies, 
according to a Brown Univer-
sity political scientist. 
Lyman 13. Kirkpatrick, ? a 
former high-ranking CIA of-
ficial who joined the Brown 
faculty eight years ago, said 
strong controls are needed 
.especially in the field of do-
mestic intelligence. 
"The less we have of do-
mestic intelligence the bet-
ter," he said. 
Mr. Kirkpatrick, is the au-
thor of a new hook: ''The 
Intelligence: Foreign Policy 
and Domestic Activities,". 
which is scheduled for publi-
caton in the fall. , 
It analyzes the nation's in-
telligence Ewan-this and its re-
-lationship to the .President, 
Congress and the public. 
Mr. Kirkpatrick believes both 
the executive and legislative 
branches of the government 
have at their disposal adequate 
means of .overseeing intelli-
gence operations. 
"The- whole- point is that 
they should exercise more ag-
gressive controls," he said. 
Critical of the decision to 
assign the Army a role in 
gathering domestic in-
telligence during the height of 
civil unrest stemming irons 
the war in Southeast Asia, 
Mr. Kirkpatrick maintains that 
"the Army shouldn't be in-
volved in that kind of busi-
ness. Tint is the role of the 
FBI." 
The Brown professor served. 
as a staff officer; assistant 
director, inspector general 
and executive director-comp-
troller of the CIAssduring his 
two-decade career with the 
agency. He emphasized than 
espionage is only a small part 
of the agency's work, and as-
sumes a secondary role to re-
search and the analysis of

At Brown Mr. Kirps ri 
teaches courses on Cold War 
operatons, American miilto 
affairs and problems of na-
tional strategy and policy. 
The seminar on American 
military afairs is new this 
term and was organized with 
the help of a $143,000 grant 
from the Carthage Foundation 
of Pittsburgh. 
A portion of the seminars 
will focus on'a case history_of 
the Vietnam war, using the 
Pentagon Papers as resource 
material. 
Mr. Kirkpatrick rates U.S. 
intelligence in Vietnam as 
generally good in the area of 
strategic matters, but has 
concluded that tactical Infos-
mation was less reliable. 
"Good tactical intelligence 
was difficult to come by since 
the Viet Cong controlled so 
much of the countryside," be 
said. 
Mr. Kirkpatrick said his 
standard reply to criticism of 
the CIA for activities such as 
the Bay of Pigs invasion and 
to charges that the agency 
has too much say in foreign 
policy is that "the CIA does 
what it is told to do." 
"As long as we live in a 
world with intense competi-
tion and hostility we need a, 
good intelligence system," he 
said. 
"But intelligence is, as a 
word, relate. si to military at-
/fairs. My conviction is that in-
telligence work is closely re-
lated to peace," he added. 
-Arr. Kirkpatrick said the 
FBI is the only appropriate 
agency to engage in domestic 
. intelligence gathering activi-
ties and is so designated by 
federal laws, When the Army 
entered this field in 1968, its 
intelligence collecting opera-
pparatus 
tions snowballed to the point 
that dossiers were being 
created almost indiscrim-
inately, he said. 
In the field of . foreign in-
telligence, Congress has the 
options to exercise influence 
and controls through appro-
priations, Mr. Kirkpatrick 
said. 
Lawmakers such as Sen. J. 
William Fulbright, chairman 
of the Senate foreign relations 
committee, and Congressman' 
George Mahan, chairman of 
the House appropriations 
committee, are Continually 
placing CIA activities under 
scrutiny. 
He said be believes .the CIA 
has a legitimate role in inves-
tigating foreign drug traffic, 
adding that the agency has 
been involved in that kind of 
investigative activity for 25 
years. 
It was recently reported 
that the agency would broad-
en its activities in this field 
and also use its intelligence 
gathering resources in an ef-
fort to curb acts of terrorism.

? By Keyes Beech 
Daily News Foreign Service 
Morale of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, once the 
highest of any government agency operating in Southeast 
Asia, has sunk to an all-time, low under the impact of a 
drastic reorganization under the new director, James R. 
Schlesinger. ? 
Most CIA men in the field concede that an overhaul of the 
agency was long overdue, not only to keep pace with chang-
ing times but to eliminate deadwood personnel. Nor have 
they anything against Schlesinger, a budget-minded man-
avement expert who was President Nixon's choice to cut 
down to size not only the CIA but other government in-
telligence services as well. 
But their greatest fear is that in the process, and tinder an 
administration that seems to insist on absolute loyalty to the 
.President, the CIA will lose its most precious assets ? its 
Integrity and independence of judgment regardless of who is 
in power. 
"I have no argument with efficiency and economy," said 
one senior CIA official and oldtime cold warrior. "But. I 
would prefer a little inefficiency and room for initiative 
Instead of seeing the CIA as the best-run agency in the 
government." 
ACCORDING TO REPORTS REACHING Southeast Asian 
_ . 
capitals, more than 1,SW employes hae been lopped-off tie, 
CIA payroll since Schlesinger took charge Feb. 2. One divt-
,sion received an 18 per cent across-the-board cut. 
"For the most part it's the World War II types who are. 
gettingthe axe ? men in their late 40s or 50s," said one CIA 
man recently returned from the United States. "But some 
younger men in their 30s are also losing their jobs. 
William A. Colby, a one time OSS agent who parachuted 
Into France in World War II, transferred to CIA when it was 
born out of OSS and later became director of the 'pacifica-
tion program in South Vietnam with the rank of ambassador 
until he returned to the CIA in a top job, was reported doing 
all he can to ease the pain for some of the old Southeast Asia 
hands. 
Some senior CIA officials are returning to Washington 
without knowing what their next job will be ? if they have 
one. Some are slated for retirement, even though they don't 
know it. Some CIA men are threatening to resign after more 
than two decades of service. The choice may not be theirs. 
ONE CIA VETERAN HAILED the dismissals. "It's about 
time we cut down and got rid o: some of the World War II - 
types," he said. He is a World War II "type" who escaped 
the axe. 
Among the first to be dismissed were such paramilitary 
men as those who for more than a decade helped run the ? 
clandestine war in Laos. Unlike career CIA agents, they 
were under contracts subject to termination in 30 days. 
They had job security because there was always another 
war to go to. "Now," as one remarked, "we've run out of 
wars." 
Schlesinger's takeover capped a changing of the guard ' 
that began at least two years before. Attrition and the dis-
astrous Bay of Pigs affair took their toll of the World War II 
derring-do gentlemen-adventurer ? spies and dirty tricks 
specialists who once dominated the agency. 
"I'm one of the new breed ? a technocrat," said one top 
CIA man. 
, 
BUT IT WAS THE END of the. Cold War more than any-. 
thing else that contributed to the decline of CIA influence in 
foreign affairs. That and the fact that today the most vital 
intelligence is gathered not by men but by computers and 
high-flying satellites. 
The CIA emerged from the Vietnam War looking better 
than any other brand of government involved in the Indo-
china conflict. One reason was that CIA men tried to tell 
it like it was, not like somebody back in Washington wanted. 
This was amply proved by the Pentagon Papers.

ITT Head 
Affirms 
Fund Offer 
By Laurence Stern 
Washington Post Staff Writer 
. ? Harold S. Geneen, chairman 
of the International Telephone 
and Telegraph Corp., acknowl-
edged yesterday that he twice 
offered large sums of money 
ro. the U.S. government in 1970 
to block the election of Chi-
lean President Salvador- Al-
lende. 
The ITT executive, reputed 
to be the nation's highest paid 
corporate . officer, gingerly 
stepped around contradictions 
in previous testimony by ITT 
officials and other witnesses 
which Sen. Frank Church (D-
Idaho) declared might be the 
basis for perjury action. 
? Geneen said he could not 
recall making an offer of a 
"substantial fund" .to a top 
.Central Intelligence Agency 
official, William V. Broe, in 
July, 1970; to finance - an 
agency effort to stop Allende: 
- But he stipulated that he 
would accept Broe's sworn 
version of their conversation 
during a late evening meeting 
in Geneen's room at the Sher-
aton Carlton Hotel here. 
He said the offer to Broe 
might have been ill-advised, 
prompted by his "shock" at 
political developments in 
Chile where he feared confis-
cation by the Allende govern-
ment of ITT holdings. The 
CIA declined his offer, he 
said, and the matter "died 
right there." 
But the offer surfaced ag,ain 
in different form in Septem-
ber after Allende's popular 
election, Geneen conceded un-
der questioning. It came in 
the form of a proposal con-
veyed by ITT to national se-
curity adviser Henry A. Kis-, 
singer and Richard M. Helms, 
then head of the CIA, to do-
nate "up to a million dollars" 
toward a plan to block Al. 
Geneen also disclosed that 
ITT had offered to contribute 
to the CIA in the 1964 elec-
tion When Allende lost to 
Christian Democrat Eduardo 
Frei. The offer, he said, was 
turned down, as was the 1970 
proffer to the agency. 
For three hours under hot 
television lights Geneen spar-
red his Senate questioners. 
At one point Church, chair-
man of the inquiry, exclaimed 
that testimony on ITT's role 
was getting "curiouser and 
curiouser." 
Geneen was flanked by two 
lawyers and a bodyguard. Be-
hind him sat a row of ITT's 
top corporate officers. His 
testimony marked the closing 
session of the inquiry by the 
Senate Foreign Relations Sub-
committee on Multinational 
Corporations into the giant 
comnittnication conglomerate's 
activities in the 1970 Chilean 
election. 
In earlier sessions ITT vice 
president Edward Gerrity said 
G-eneen's second offer of a 
fund "up to seven figures" 
was for some form of devel-
opment aid in housing or agri-
culture. He was never aware, 
said Gerrity, of the purpose 
disclosed by MeCone: to fi-
nance U.S. government efforts 
to block Allende's .confirma-
tion by Chile's Congress. 
But the ITT official . who 
was supposed to convey the 
offer of development aid to 
the White House and State 
Department said yesterday he 
had never been instructed to 
make such an offer. "I passed 
on the message I received," 
said Jack Neal of ITT's Wash-
ington office. 
Gerrity conceded he might 
have failed to pass along that 
ITT was ready to underwrite 
a Si million contribution for 
development aid to Chile. 
Geneen himself took the 
position that the million-dol-
lar offer was a "duel" offer: 
It might have been allocated 
by the goy ernmen t I owa rd 
financing an anti-Allende coal-
ition in the Chilean Congress, 
or it might have been usee for 
Geneen responded: -"That 
depends on what the second 
plan was." i 
" "I don't think I'd ever get. 
aver the first plan," . Case 
snapped back. 
"As the record now stands," 
said Church, "the beneficent 
plan, the constructive propo-
sal, was never communicated 
to the government and died 
somewhere as it was being 
passed down to subordinates 
af the company . . Why was 
something so serious never 
aimmunicated to the govern-
ment?" 
Geneen could not explain 
he communication lapse with-
in ITT. 
In his prepared statement 
Geneen said he used the mag-
nitude of "up to seven figures" 
in order "to show a serious 
intent and to gain serious at-
tention from the Govern-
ment." 
In presenting ITT's role in 
the Chilean affair, Geneen 
said, "all that ITT did was to 
present its views, concerns, 
and ideas to various depart-
ments of the U.S. government. 
This is not only its right, but. 
also its obligation,"

was between the clandestine

By JEFFREY ANTEVIL 
Washington, April 2 (NEWS Bureau).? International Telephone & Telegraph 
Corp. President Harold Geneen said today that he was in a state of "shock"- at the 
prospect of his firm's investment in Chile "going down the. drain" and that is why 
he offered company meney if the Central Intelligence Agency would try to block the 
election of Marxist Salvador 
Geneen told a Senate Foreign 
Relations subcommittee that the 
offer was dropped after ? CIA 
spymaster William V. Broe re-
jected it as a violation of U.S. 
policy. ITT took no steps to keep 
Allende from. taking power in 
1970, Geneen added. "If I had 
given it more serious - considera-
tion," he said of the money of-
fer, "I might have rejected it 
-myself." 
But Geneen defended his firm's 
conduct against charges that it 
conspired with the CIA to in-
terfere improperly in the Chilean 
election. "All that ITT did was 
to present its views, concerns 
and ideas to various departments 
,of the U.S. government," he said, 
calling this the firm's "constitu-
tional right" in light of its fears 
that Allende would nationalize 
the ITT-controlled Chile Tele-
phone Co. 
"If all that was involved was 
petitioning your government," 
asked subcommittee chairman 
Frank Church (D-Idaho), "why 
did you seek out the CIA?" 
Church noted that Broe, who met 
with Geneen several weeks be-
fore the Chilean election, was in 
charge of . CIA clandstine opera--
tions for Latin America. 
Geneen also testified, in the - 
final day of hearings on the ITT-
Chile affair, that a later ITT 
offer tithe government of Alp to 
$1 mi%on was intended for

Chile. He said that he hoped the 
U.S. would come up with a plan 
to offer Allende technical aid for

Star-News Staff Writer 
Chairman Frank Church, D-

tional corporations subcom-
mittee plans to introduce leg; 
islation that would make it a 
federal crime for a business 
organization to contribute 
money to finance operations 
of the Central Intelligence 
Agency. 
- Church announced this in-
tent at the close yesterday of 
two weeks of hearings into the 
machinations pf ITT Corp. 
with CIA and other govern-
ment agencies in the internal 
affairs of Chile. The hearings 
produced testimony that ITT 
and CIA ? approached each 
other at different times in the 
Chilean election period of 1970 
? with suggestions for affecting 
the outcome of the election 
and the Chilean economy. 
? . But Church indicated that 
the subcommittee would not 
pursue his threat to Send the 
transcript ? of the hearings to 
the Justice Department on 
suspicion of perjury. Church 
announced last week that .he, 
believed "someone is lying" 
when testimony of ITT execu-
tives appeared to conflict with 
that of U.S. government wit-
nesses and other ITT officials. 
Church said the 'inconsisten-
cies now seem to be due to 
lapses of -time Or memory, or 
a failure to communicate 
.among those involved in the 
sensational ITT documents on 
? "I feel the wider the dis-
tance between big business 
and the CIA the better for all 
concerned-," Church declared. 
"Legislation to accomplish 
this may be one of the better 
outgrowths of these hearings. 
We cannot have this inces-
tuous relationship between 
the CIA and U.S. companies 
operating abroad." 
Harold S. Geneen, ITT 
board chairman, occupied the 
witness chair for most of yes-
terday as the subcommittee 
wound up the hearings. 
Gelleell'S testimony was that 
there were two distinct plias-
roved (Filo. Rti1ealsiek2OMOS839 : 
in MO; One in the summer 
when Marxist Salvador Al-
lende was campaigning on a 
platform of expropriation that 
ITT believed would cost the 
corporation its $153 million 
investment; the other during 
the autumn when Allende 
looked to be a sure winner 
requiring only confirmation 
by the Chilean Congress. . 
Geneen accepted testimony 
of CIA agent William V. Broe 
that Geneen had offered a 
substantial sum for any gov-
ernment plan that would 
block Allende, although ,he 
said he did not recall doing it. 
But Geneen said that money 
offer "died" when Broe re-
jected the offer in July 1970. 
"The next offer was entire-
ly separate and had a dual 
purpose," Geneen testified. 
"The offer of $1 million was 
openly presented to two de-
partments of government 
(The National Security Coun-
cil and the State Department) 
. It was to make Allende more 
receptive to us and other 
companies if he was elected ? 
or to help the Chileans arrive 
at a democratic coalition solu-
tion. The $1 million figure was 
only a measurement of our 
willingness to join any gov-
ernment program." 
Sen. Clifford Case, It-N.J., 
said, "If I heard someone was 
offering $1 million to defeat 
rue or make me vote better, 
I'd take that as a provoca-
tion." 
"That depends on the sec-
ond part of the plan," Geneen 
said. 
"I don't think I'd get over 
the first plan," Case replied.

WASHINGTON, 
Monday (AAP). ? The 
'Central Intelligence 
Agency apparently is 
planning to curtail some 
of its old activities, not-
ably clandestine military 
operations, and under-
take some new ones, 
such as action against 
political terrorism and 
the international drug 
traffic, the New York 
Times reported. 
Since Mr James R. 
Schlesinger took over as 
director on February 2 
more than 1,000 em-
? ployees of the CIA have 
received dismissal notices. 
? Mr Schlesinger also has 
authority from President 
Nixon to reduce man-
power as well in the mili-
tary intelligence services. 
During the past two 
rat's, personnel in the 
Intelligence establishment 
as a. whole has been re-
duced by about 20% 
according to reliable esti-
mates. , 
In 1971 there were 
more than 150,000 people 
in the military and diplo-
matic intelligence services 
and the CIA. There are 
. now fewer than' 125,000 
according to the estimates, 
and perhaps no more than 
115,000. 
, The man mainly respon-
sible for drafting the Pre-
sident's memorandum on 
reducing duplication of 
functions and improving 
efficiency was Mr Schle-
singer and he has now 
been given the authority 
to put it into effect. 
Apparently Mr Schle-
singer is expected to make 
the Federal bureaucracy 
more responsive to the 
Administration. 
This objective, has led 
to charges from some old 
hands at the CIA that the 
.agency has been "poli-
ticised" by the Nixon 
Ad in inistration. 
Mr Schlesinger met this 
charge, when his CIA 
appointment was up for 
confirmation in the Senate, 
by assuring the Senate 
armed services committee 
that he believed absolutely 
in maintaining the integ-
rity and independence of 
Intelligence estimates.

As of December the 220,000 U.S. snoops, spies, and 
saboteurs have a new boss -- 44- year?old Dr James Rodney 
Schlesinger. President Nixon had several reasons for appoin-
ting this man at precisely this time to the very influential 
position of CIA director: Schlesinger and Nixon both belong 
to the reactionary Republican Party. 
Wall Street Agent 
As a former professor, Schlesinger. is a. member of'uile 
East Berlin llolksarmee, German, 
exclusive American 4-'conomic Society and for many years has 
maintained close contacts with the millionames of the 
military-industrial complex through the American Financial 
Society. Schlesinger is a prominent wall Street agent, 
whom Nixon in 1969 appointed deputy director of the Office 
of the Budget, the state monopoly financial control center 
Ltitj 
in Washington. aine-e 1971 Schlesinger president4of the 
primarily militarily-programed Atomic Energy Commission. 
Santa Nonica Planner of Nassacres 
Schlesinger is not inexperienced in intelligence 
work. After 1963 he served for about 6 years as a staff 
member, i.e.) "director for strategic studies " of the Rand 
Corporation in Santa Monica, Cclifernia. The Rand jorporation 
serves as a "think tank" for a--,ressive air force irojecLd.

Here Schlesinger was involved in the completion of studies 
such as "The Increased Efriciency of Area .pombing" and 
"The Escalation of the. Use of Atomic Weapons." It is not 
surprising that Nixon apc(inted Schlesinger CIA director 
on the very same day that he ordered a ma,-,sive bombing attack 
on the DIN, 
Specialist in Subversion  
With the appointment of this unscrupulous person Nixon 
has undoubtedly fortified his position regarding a presidential 
dictatorship. With the help of the CIA, whose sources will 
of course be kept secret and uncontrolled, Nixon plans to 
implement the global strategy of U.S. imperialism. Schlesinger 
is to assist him in various ways. As a strategist of the 
U.S. Air Force, Schlesinger represents the reactionary 
military clique in the Pentagon, which is constantly brandishing 
its sword and playing world policeman. As a militant anti- . 
communist, Schlesinger was charged with the task of strengthen-
ing NATO. He has also been toll to direct the antisocialist 
activities of NPTO intelligence services, which were expanded 
in 1972 with no less than 20 billion man's, and to spy on 
all NATO countries to assess their reliability. 
As a former economics professor and budget 'expertl 
Schlesinger is to lead his CTA in the merciless economic war 
declared by the United States against all c:mpetotors and 
support the economic expansion of the capitalist world market.

As a successful manager of the U.S. financial oligarchy,

U.S. and military intelligence apparatuses under his 
control in antisocialist and antidemocratic subversion.

COLONEL FLETCHER PROUTY INTERVIEWED 
JOHN HART: Before he retired, Air Force Col. Fletcher 
Prouty spent a lot of his military career as what is called the 
focal point officer between the Department of Defense and the 
Central Intelligence Agency. He's written a book which is highly 
critical of what he calls The Secret Team, which by the way is 
the title of the book. Since there are frequent references in 
the book to information in the Pentagon Papers, CBS News corres-
pendent Fred Graham, who's been covering the Daniel Ellsberg 
trial, has joined me for the interview. 
Col. Prouty, I'd like to ask you first, what is the 
secret team? 
COL. FLETCHER PROUTY: You know, there are quite a few 
people who write about the CIA, and Mr. Dulles has written about' 
CIA; Lyman Kirkpatrick has written about CIA. The secret team 
really is the CIA and other parts of the government. The secret 
team includes, for instance, the participation of the Defense 
Department, of the White House, offices such as today we have 
under Dr. Kissinger. I think it's important to point out that 
in the operational aspects of CIA 'work, the participation of a 
major part of the government, not just CIA is an important 
consideration. 
HART: Well, the secret team's part in such things as 
the assaSsination of Ngo Dinh Diehm, that sort of thing, the ITT-
CIA involvement--alleged involvement?in the election in Chile 
are pretty well documented. Can you tell us anything about what 
you think may be going on right now? 
PROUTY: You mean current operations? 
HART: That's right, yes. 
PROUTY:. Actually, most of the things that I knew in 
current operations ended with my retirement about ten years ago.

Obviously, I've kept in touch with some of the people that are 
in this business, but some of that might be in the area of con-
jecture. I think one of the most important parts is the role of 
Jim McCord and Howard Hunt in the Watergate case--CIA people, 
career men, McCord in his area, FBI man--through my friendship 
with a lawyer, Bernard Fensterwald, we get Mr. McCord moving into 
a different area in the Watergate thing. This is, you might say, 
a civilian application of a CIA or secret team type operation. 
I think it's an example, currently--not of course directed by CIA 
at this present time, but it's an example of the kind of thing 
that's done by people under the cloak of secrecy, under security 
wraps, and in a way that the American people have no way in the 
world to really know what's going on. 
FRED GRAHAM: Colonel, could I ask you to elaborate 
just a minute about--there's been some conjecture in the press 
about Bernard Fensterwald's role. He is the new lawyer for James 
McCord, and it's been pointed out that he was--he is a lifelong 
and at one time very active Democrat, and perhaps one of his 
motives is to bring out into the open more about the Watergate 
and the White House's alleged involvement in it. You said you 
were partially responsible for Mr. Fensterwald being involved 
here. Can you elaborate as to whether or not that might be true? 
PROUTY: Well, I've known him for quite a long time. 
We've discussed this Watergate affair--
HART: You mean Mr. Fensterwald? 
PRQUTY: Mr. Fensterwald, and it just happens that in 
my book, I mention an operation in which Jim McCord did quite a 
bit of work with me and with the Defense Department. As a 
result, I had the feeling all along that McCord was just not 
somebody's little wiretapper or debugging man. He's a pro, he's 
a master at certain things. Allen Dulles introduced him to me.. 
I have a pretty high regard for his capability. It's much 
greater, I would say, than the general concept. So I talked to 
Fensterwald about this, and I believe that the motivation on the 
part of Bud Fensterwald is purely professional and that he sees 
that there's much more to be done in the case. I think that's 
why McCord is working with him now as someone who's willing to 
get into this case and get to the bottom of things. 
HART: You seem to know James McCord fairly well. 
PROUTY: I did at one time. As in the--in one chapter 
in the book, we write about an airplane that belonged to Mr. 
Dulles himself, it was his private plane. It was shot down over 
Russia and a nine-man crew of CIA-Air Force people were captured.

Mr. Dulles called me to his home that evening and then 
after a conference with Dick (Vissal?) and others, introduced me 
to McCord, and said this man is the best man that we have, he's 
an FBI man, trained in their ways, and trained with the CIA both, 
he's an expert. So, yes, I've known him since 1959. 
GRAHAM: Colonel, the incident of the plane being shot 
down--was that the plane that Jack Downey was on? 
PROUTY: No, Downy was shot down as part of the Korean 
War. The one I'm talking about was shot down near Baku. 
GRAHAM: Well, may I ask you then about Jack Downey's? 
Of course, Mr. Downey came out from a Chinese prison earlier 
this month--last month--and he said at that time, without any 
apparent qualms, he said, I told the Chinese all I knew. Now, how 
much did that compromise the CIA's activities, to have a CIA 
operative tell the Chinese all he knew? 
PROUTY: In the context of what Downey knew during the 
Korean War and as a young man just out of jail, operating with 
drop teams over China, I would say that what he knew was good for 
maybe a week or two weeks in a security sense, but what he knew 
in terms of the real CIA relationships with the government I think 
weren't going to hurt things very much. I don't think Downey did 
anything to hurt the government. 
GRAHAM: So you don't think Downey did anything repre-
hensible in telling the Chinese all he knew? 
PROUTY: No, one thing that those people in deep security 
learn is that there are other people involved, other Chinese, let's 
say, or maybe Koreans, or Americans close into these lines. Now, 
we try to protect them, of course, try to protect them for par-
ticipating in this kind of activity. In that sense you have to 
guard knowledge. 
GRAHAM: Let me change the subject. In your book an 
important point--an allegation that you made, is that the CIA 
engineered the disclosure of the Pentagon Papers through Daniel 
Ellsberg, in order to throw favorable light on the CIA's intel-
ligence efforts, because the Pentagon Papers do point out that 
the CIA was quite often right in its warnings that we were being 
drawn into a quagmire, but Colonel, I was flabbergasted to see 
your allegation there, in two points, straight out, that Daniel 
Ellsberg was a CIA agent. What's your source for that statement? 
PROUTY: Well, you know, Dan Ellsberg called me the 
other day, more or less reminding me that he had never worked

for CIA. A lot of people who work in the peripheral areas--
that's really why I talk in terms of a secret team, are not 
necessarily paid by the CIA, you might say, or even sometimes 
don't realize that they are working in support of CIA activi-
ties. I wouldn't say either of these applied, but I do know 
that Ellsberg worked with Lansdale in Viet Nam; I worked with 
Lansdale for many, many years. I don't think Lansdale really, 
other than being an Air Force man, ever did much work that 
wasn't involved with CIA. He was one of their most --
HART: You're talking about retired Major General 
Edward Lansdale. 
PROUTY: --Lansdale, right, and I think the affiliation 
is pretty strong, but the key thing about--going back to your 
earlier point--the key thing about these papers, the thing that 
should interest the American people, because they seem to be put 
forth as a document of the history of Viet Nam, which they are 
not--these papers are 3,000 pages of narrative, 4,000 documents 
that they have been culled out. They're not the complete his-
tory of even the activities that they portray. Somebody got in 
there in took out quite a few of those. I used to have 
file cabinet after file cabinet of it in the JCS, of CIA papers; 
it was my business to take care of those papers. A lot of them 
that I knew aren't in these Pentagon Papers. 
GRAHAM: Well, Colonel, just for the record, though, I 
called Daniel Ellsberg on the telephone yesterday out in Cali-
fornia, and he flatly denies ever having been a CIA agent. Nowy 
you say in your book flatly he was. Now, which is true? 
PROUTY: I'd have to talk with him and find out how 
much he knows about really what he was doing.. 
GRAHAM: He told me that he denied to you that he 
was a CIA man and you accepted that. 
PROUTY: Yes, he told me that--well, he told me that; 
I didn't answer him. He said that he wasn't a CIA agent, and I 
think that's pretty simple, itself. Whether he's a CIA employee 
or whether he's working as a member of the secret team, which is 
a very close thing--
HART: Well, secret team can cover almost anything, by 
your description. 
PROUTY: Ah yes?anything in the area of the CIA opera-
tional activities, activities that develop from secret intelli-
gence, and are generally in support of clandestine areas, whether

clandestine in operational matters, or clandestine in deep intelli-
gence. 
HART: Colonel Prouty, it was never clear to me what 
intelligence agency you were working for. 
PROUTY: I was a member of the United States 'Air Force, 
working for many years in the Office of Secretary of Defense, or 
in the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
HART: Well the question arose in my mind, as T read your 
book, which certainly casts some aspersions upon the CIA, many of 
them, as to what rival agency, whether it was an intelligence agency, 
or perhaps a military agency, would benefit from this characteriza-
tion of the CIA, which comes out very clean as you point out in the 
Pentagon Papers. Is this a kind of a defense answer? 
PROUTY: No, that's a good way to put it. I think, per-
haps, the best answer is something I read in the news letter--
HART: No, no--excuse me--I mean, 
by the Department of Defense? 
is your book an answer 
PROUTY: .1 think to clarify this, John, the story is that 
the CIA likes to cover itself as an intelligence organization, and 
the CIA works very hard to present on one hand that it is an intelli-
gence operation, whereas, 80 or 90 per cent of its activities are 
operational. The Pentagon Papers show that. They talk almost ' 
nothing about their operations. They usually put them in terms of 
military operations. They talk primarily of the CIA's intelligence, 
and at the same time, Mr. Dulles would be delivering an NIL, put 
out by Sherman Cantor--
HART: And that's no intelligence. 
PROUTY: Yes. And then he would, at the same time, in 
the same period of time, be establishing an operation which was 
almost 100 per cent counter to the NIL, or completely different 
from that NIL. The Federation of American Scientists, for example, 
last month, published--
HART: Very quickly, Colonel, we're running out of time. 
PROUTY: They say that the CIA's best cover is its repu-
tation as an intelligence agency. 
HART: Colonel, I have to interrupt you. We've enjoyed 
having you, and we'd like to go on, but we've just run out of time. 
Colonel Fletcher Prouty, thank you very much.

AN INTERVIEW WITH COLONEL FLETCHER PROUTY  
Washington, D.C. 
JOHN HART: Before he retired, Air Force Colonel Fletcher Prouty 
spent a lot of his military career as what is called the "Focal Point 
Officer" between the Department of Defense and the Central intelligence 
Agency. 
He's written a book which is highly critical of what he calls 
"The Secret Team" which, by the way, is the title of the book. Since 
there are frequent references in the book to information in the Pentagon 
Papers, CBS News correspondent Fred Graham, who's been covering the Daniel 
Ellsberg trial, has joined me for the interview. 
Colonel Prouty, I'd like to ask you first what is the secret 
team? 
COLONEL FLETCHER PROUTY: Well, you know, there are quite a 
few people who write about the CIA. Mr. Dulles has written about the 
CIA. Lyman Kirkpatrick has written about the CIA. 
The secret team really is the CIA and other parts of the government. 
The secret team includes the -- for instance, the participation of the 
Defense Department, of the White House -- of offices such as today we 
have under Dr. Kissinger. I think it's important to point out that in 
the operational aspects of CIA work the participation of a major part 
of the government, not just the CIA, is an important consideration. 
HART: Well, the secret team's part in such things as the assassi-
nation of [name unintelligible] Jim, that sort of thing, the ITT and the 
CIA involvement -- alleged involvement -- in the elections of Chile are 
pretty well documented. Can you tell us anything about what you think 
may be going on right now? 
COLONEL PROUTY: You mean current operations? 
HART: That's right. Yes. 
COLONEL PROUTY: Well act -- actually most of the things that 
I knew in current operations ended with my retirement about 10 years ago.

Obviously I've kept in touch with some of the people that are in this 
business, but some of that might be in the area of conjecture. 
I think one of the most important parts is the role of Jim 
McCord and Howard Hunt in the Watergate case -- CIA people, career men. 
McCord in his area as an FBI man. Through my friendship with a lawyer, 
Bernard FensterWaql, we got Mr. McCord moving into a different area in 
the Watergate thing. This is, you might say, a civilian application of 
a CI -- CIA or secret team type operation. I think it's an example, currently, 
not of course directed by CIA at this present time, but it's an example 
of the kind of thing that's done by people under a cloak of secrecy, under 
security wraps, and in -- in a way that the American people have no way 
in the world to -- to really know what's going on. 
FRED GRAHAM: Colonel, could I ask you to elaborate just a 
minute about the -- there's been some conjecture in the press about Bernard 
Fensterwahl's role. He is the new lawyer for James McCord, and it has 
been pointed out that he was -- he is a lifelong and one time very active 
Democrat, and perhaps one of his motives is to bring. out into the open 
more about the Watergate and the White House's alleged involvement in 
it. 
You said you were partly responsible for Mr. Fensterwahl being 
involved here. Can you elaborate as to whether or not that might be true? 
COLONEL PROUTY: Well I've known him for quite a long time. 
We've discussed this Watergate affair... 
i 
GRAHAM: You've known Mr. Fensterwawnhl? 
COLONEL PROUTY: Mr. Fensterwahl. And it just happens that 
in my book I mention an operation in which Jim McCord did quite a bit 
of work with me and with the Defense Department. As a result, I had the 
feeling all along that McCord is not just somebody's little wiretapper, 
debugging man, but he's a pro. He's a master at 'certain things.

sees that there's much more to be done in the case. I think that's why 
McCord is working with him now as someone who's willing to get into this 
case and get to the bottom of things.

Mr. Dulles called me to his home that evening and then after 
a conference with Dick Bissell and others introduced me to McCord and 
said this man is the best man we have. He's an FBI man trained in their 
ways and trained with the CIA booth. He's an expert. 
[Laughter] 
So, yes, I've known him since 1959. 
GRAHAM: Colonel, the incident of the plane being shot down, 
was that the plane that Jack Downey was on? 
COLONEL PROUTY: No. Downey was shot down in -- as a part 
of the Korean war. The one I'm talking about was shore -- was shot down 
near Barcoo (?). 
GRAHAM: May I ask you, then, about Jack Downey? 
COLONEL PROUTY: Of course.. 
.GRAHAM: Mr. Downey came from Chinese prison earlier this month 
last month -- and he said at that time, without any apparent qualms, he 
said "I told the Chinese all I knew." Now, how much did that compromise 
the CIA's activities to have a CIA operative tell the Chinese all he knew? 
COLONEL PROUTY: In the context of what Downey knew during 
the Korean War and as a young man just out of Yale operating with drop 
teams over China, I would say that what he knew was good for maybe a week 
or two weeks in a security sense, but what he knew in terms of the real 
CIA relationships with the government I think weren't going to help things 
very much. I don't think Downey did anything that could hurt the government. 
GRAHAM: So you don't think Downey did anything reprehensible 
in telling the Chinese all he knew? 
COLONEL PROUTY: Well one thing that these people in deep security 
learn is that there are other people involved, other Chinese let's say, 
or Americans close in to the lines. Now we try to protect them, of course. 
We try to protect them for participating in this kind of activity. In 
that sense you have to guard your knowledge.

point -- allegation -- you make is that the CIA engineered the disclosure 
of the Pentagon Papers through Daniel Ellsberg in order to throw a favorable

Shift Sought 
OF CIA Role 
To Pentagon 
By Michael Getler ? 
wilutilogton ['oat Stilt( Wri 
One of the military's top-
ranking intelligence officers 
has called for a reassertion of 
the military's dominant role 
over civilians in the critical 
business of estimating na-
tional security threats to the 
United States. 
The case for giving this re-
sponsibility to the Pentagon 
?rather than the Central In-
telligence Agency (CIA) ? and 
other civilian-dominated intel-
ligence agencies?is laid out 
in a highly unusual article ap-
pearing in the April issue of 
Army magazine. 
The article is by Army Maj. I 
Gen. Daniel 0. Graham, cur-
rently deputy director for esti-
!pates in the Pentagon's De-
fense Intelligence Agency 
(DIA). 
Graham is scheduled to 
move over to the CIA on May 
1 to join the staff of its new 
director, James R. Schle-
singer. ? 
Thus, the appearance of 
Graham's article in public , 
could indicate that at least 
part of his new job at the CIA 
will be to help bring about the 
return of a major portion of 
the highly important intelli-
gence estimating job to the 
Pentagon. The estimates of 
military threats are a major 
factor in planning the Penta- ' 
will's annual budget and in the 
course of U.S. foreig policy. 
While Graham's article re-
flects his. personal judgment, 
U.S. defense officials say the 
appearance of the article at 
this time "was not acciden-
tial," implying that it had an 
official okay. 
Graham's pending transfer 
to the CIA has prompted con-
cern among some civilian in-
telligence officials. They fear 
that the critical annual Intelligence estimates ? on such 
things as Soviet missile devel-,

what the Russians and others 
were up to gradually was won ?(' ? 
over by the CIA ? and other 
agencies. 
Rutin the past three years, 
he says, the new Defense In-
telligence Agency has "come a 
long way since the missile 
gap.". 
He argues that the quality 
of military analysis has now 
improved considerably and 
that most, though not all, of 
the military men who use in-
telligence have learned not to 
bend it for their own self-in-
terest: or force intelligence an-
alysts to do that. 
"To sum up," he writes, "I , 
think that the time is ripe for 
the military profession to reas-
sert its. traditional role in the . 
function of describing military': 
threats to national security." ' 
In a key statement that may ' 
foreshadow some reduction in 
the CIA's estimating role in 
favor of ? the Pentagon, Gra-
ham writes: 
"While there will always he 
a legitimate reason for inde-
penderit? judgments from out-
side the Department of De-
fense'. on. issues of critical im-
portance to not decision-
makers, there Is no longer a 
need,. in my judgment, to du-
plicate the Defense Intelli- 4. 
genm Agency's efforts in 
other agencies." 
Throughout the article, the

Putting the Military- in Charge of' Intelligence 
to "coordinate" an estimate produced 
by military intelligence are quite capa-
ble, he says, of reducing it "to the low-
est common denominator mush," and 
to "inoffensive pap." 
The purpose of this remarkabla con-
fession which Graham makes on behalf 
of his colleagues, if not on his own?
for he implies that his own estimates 
were always right?is not far to seek. 
He says that by "abusing the intelli-
gence process" the military profession-
als have "produced the best arguments 
for taking the responsility for threat 
description out of military hands," and 
have caused the decision-makers to 
turn elsewhere for "objective" assess-
ments. 
It is this distrust of the DIA, which 
has caused successive Presidents to 
turn to the CIA, that Graham has' set 
out to cure. The burden of his argu-
ment is that the military can and will 
now make the right decisions?al-
though he does not make it clear why 
it should be trusted to mend its ways. 
The decisions about the . defense 
budget, and about the nature of U.S. 
forces and weapons development, were 
always supposed to be made in re-
sponse to intelligence estimates of the 
Soviet "threat." But more often than 
not they resulted from a mix of budget-
An article by the Pentagon general 
newly appointed to curb the Central 
Intelligence Agency throws a strong 
light at the murky fog which envelops 
the CIA. 
The article by Maj. Gen. Daniel Gra-
ham, which appears in the current is-
sues of the Army magazine, strongly 
urges the transfer of some of the CIA's 
most important functions to the DIA, 
the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence 
Agency. The fact that Graham has 
been appointed chairman of the inter-
agency committee which will ride herd 
on both the CIA and DIA suggests that 
the case he presented in his article has 
been accepted by the White House. 
What is at issue is not simply a bu-
reaucratic conflict between intelli-
gence agencies or men ambitious for 
promotion, nor even a squabble about 
who is to control the $5 billion spent 
annually by the "intelligence commu-
nity," although all these elements are 
present in the dispute. The real issue 
behind the struggle over the reorgani-
zation of the CIA concerns the whole 
direction of U.S. defense policy and, 
therefore, foreign policy. 
On the face of it, Graham provides 
what looks like the first insider's ac-
of the perversion of the intelli-
gence process by the military in pur-
' ? ? 
suit of bigger defense appropriations. 
He admits that military intelligence 
has often supplied the exaggerated es-
timates of the Soviet threat demanded 
by the defense chiefs?"the bigger the 
better." And when military intelligence 
failed to "maximize enemy threats" as 
instructed, it wai denounced by the 
brasshats for "wishful thinking." 
"More often than not," he says, 
"military intelligence people came to

heel under such criticism and stumped 
hard for the worst-case view." Al-
though he believes that this attitude is 
waning now, "there are Still some old 
hands" in military intelligence who are 
so used to yielding to their Pentagon 
superiors "that they automatically 
produce threat estimates designed to 
please, or at least certain not to of, 
fend." Military planners who profess

ary restraints, intelligence estimates, 
pressures by the military-industrial 
complex pork-barrel interests and 
many others. 
Now a basic change, which is as yet 
barely perceptible, is taking place un-
der the surface. The U.S.-Soviet agree-
ments on the limitation of strategic 
arms, and Mr. Nixon's grand design for 
a "generation of peace," have brought 
entirely new factors into military pol-
icy. The major weapons programs such 
as the B-1 bomber and the Trident sub-
marine-missile systems which are now 
pending are V far more costly than any 
in the past. 'U.S. decisions on V them 
will depend to a considerable extent on 
Mr. Nixon's estimate of the effect they 
have on the strategic balance, and on 
arms reduction bargaining. ? ? 
Therefore, if the Pentagon is to have 
a real influence on the making of de-
fense policy, it must wrest control of 
the intelligence estimates back from 
the CIA. Even if Graham's apPoint-
ment means that his argument about 
the control of intelligence has been 
accepted by the White House, the 
struggle is by no means over. 
The issues involved in this conflict, 
which will have a major bearing on 
strategic arms limitation and disarma-
ment, are so momentous that the next 
battle will be joined almost before the 
last is over.

It apparently is true that, 
under the U.S. Code, it is not 
illegal for a group of corporate 
executives to sit in a Washing-
ton office and conspire, or so-
licit federal officials to join a 
conspiracy, to overthrow the 
government of Chile. 
But the United States has a 
legal commitment under the 
Charter of the Organization of 
American States not to inter-
fere in the internal affairs of 
Latin American countries?
' and it is clear that the CIA, 
' fired up by In', was trying to 
do exactly that to keep Salva-
dor Allende out of the Chilean 
presidency. 
It might be said, of course, 
that in the end no substantive 
action was taken. But the tes-
timony given to Sen. Frank 
Church's Foreign Relations 
subcommittee by CIA and ITT 
officials.make.s. clear that the 
reason nothing was done was 
that no one could devise a plan 
that they agreed was likely to 
work. 
Clearly, the United States, 
did not desist from interfer-
ence in the Chilean election as 
a matter of policy. In fact, the 
policy was quite the contrary. 
What was lacking, as it turned 
out, was a feasible means. 
Having become rather cyni-
cal folks, we Americans might 
say to ourselves that this was 
just another ? ho-ho of 
those lovable CIA capers, the 
kind The New Yorker prints 
funny cartoons about, the kind 
that got us the Watergate 
But William Broe, the CIA 
operative who was at the cen-
ter of this Katzenjammer epi-
sode, testified that he was act-
ing on the authority of the CIA 
director, Richard Helms. And 
helms has told the subcommit-
tee privately that he never 
acted on policy matters with-
out clear White House instruc-
tions. 
So what we are talking 
about here are plans drawn up 
with the knowledge and con-
sent of the National Security 
Council, at the least. And 
though we have no direct in-
formation, it would be naive to 
think that the President didn't 
approve, too. 
? What makes this story more 
unsavory than it might be if all 
we were proposing was to save 
the Chileans from commu-
nism, which we once thought 
had a certain idealism to it, 
are the recurring themes of 
money' and cronyism. 
The man who got this proj-
ect energized is John Mc 
Cone, paragon of the Anion-
can establishment and former 
head of CIA, who went to Hen-
ry Kissinger and to Helms. 
McCone still is carried as a 
consultant to the CIA. 
Did he make his recommen-
dation out of patriotism? 
I'Vlaybe, but it is hard to be-
lieve he was not influenced by 
his membership on the ITT 
board and his considerable 
holdings of ITT stock. In fact, 
he seems also to control large 
holdings inAnaconda Copper 
Who could possibly suspect 
the motives of such a distin-
guished establishmentarian? 
But, let it be said, that if it 
were anyone else, the ugly 
words "conflict of interest" ? 
ethical if not legal ? would 
certainly be spoken. 
Indeed, what is so stunning 
here is that ITT offered the 
CIA a substantial sum of mon-
ey ? much as it offered the 
Republican party a huge dona-
tion when it had an antitrust 
prosecution pending at the 
Justice Department ? to in-
tercede to protect its property 
in Chile. 
Does the AFL-CIO give 
money to the Labor Depart-
ment to influence trade union 
regulations? Do the pharma-
ceutical manufacturers subsi-
dize the FDA to get favorable 
decisions on drugs? 
It seems to me that the fit-
ting response of any self-re-
specting public official, when 
a corporation executive walks 
into his office waving $1 mil-
lion to pay for the overthrow of 
the government of a friendly 
country, would be, "Sir, get 
the hell out of here and don't 
come back." 
If he answers by scheduling 
a meetng to discuss it further, 
then, Whatever the outcome, 
he's playing the dirty game.

U.S. Helped Beat 
Allende in 1964 
By Laurence Stern 
Washington Poet Staff Writer 
Major intervention by the Central Intelligence 
Agency and the State Department helped to defeat 
Socialist Salvador Allende in the 1964 election for 
president of Chile, according to knowledgeable offi-
cial sources. 
American corporate and governmental involvement 
against Allende's successful candidacy in 1970 has 
been the controversial focus of a Senate Foreign Re-
lations subcommittee investigation into the activities 
of U.S. multinational companies abroad. 
, But the previously undisclosed scale of American 
support for Christian Demociat Eduardo Frei against 
Allende six years earlier makes the events of 1970 
seem "like a tea party," according to one former 
intelligence official deeply involved in the 1964 effort. 
Up to $20 million in U.S. funds reportedly were in-
volved, and as many as 100 U.S. personnel. , 
The story of the American campaign, early in the 
Johnson administration, to prevent the first Marxist 
government from corning to power by constitutional 
means in the Western lIethisphere was pieced to-
gether from the accounts of officials who participated 
in the actions and policies of that period. 
Cold war theology lingered, and the shock of Fidel 
Castro's seizure of power in Cuba was still reverberat-
ing in Washington. "No more .Fidels" was the guide-

U.S. Helped

CIA, From Al 
post of American foreign 
policy in Latin America un-
der the Alliance for Prog-
ress. Washington's romantic 
zest for political engage-
ment in tile Third World 
had not yet been dimmed 
by the inconclusive agonies 
of the Vietnamese war. 
"U.S. government inter-
vention in Chile in 1964 was 
blatant and almost obscene," 
said one strategically placed 
intelligence officer at the 
time. "We were shipping 
people off right a iid left, 
mainly State Department 
but also CIA with all sorts 
of covers." 
One of the key figures in 
the 1964 intervention was 
Cord Meyer Jr., the redoubt-
able Cold War liberal. He 
directed the CIA's covert 
programs to neutralize Com-
munist influence in import-
ant opinion-molding sectors 
such as trade unions, farmer 
and peasant organizations, 
student activists and com-
munication media. 
At least one conduit for 
CIA money, the Interna-
tional Development Founda-
tion, was employed in the 
1964 campaign to subsidize 
Chilean . peasant organiza-
tions, according to a former 
official who was responsible 
for 'monitoring assistance to 
Chile from the Agency for 
International Development. 
One former member of 
the IDF board, who quit 
when he discovered it was 
financed by the CIA, said: 
"Some of us had suspected 
for a long time that the 
foundation was subsidized 
by the agency. Then it fi-
nally surfaced, and it was 
impossible to continue serv-
ing on it. Nonetheless, what 
they were doing was conso-
nant with President Kenne-
dy's policiespibiSiterialithirtsr Reie 
?political development.. 
The foundation is still in 
existence, although its CIA 
funding was terminated. It 
now is financed by AID ap-
propriations. 
Covert financing was ar-
ranged for a newspaper 
friendly to the political in-
terests of Christian Demo-
crat Frei. "The layout was 
magnificent. The photo-
graphs were superb. It was 
a Madison Avenue product 
far above the standards of 
Chilean publications," re-
calledanother State Depart-
ment veteran of the cam-
paign. 
One former high-ranking 
diplomat said CIA opera-
tions at the time were by-
passing the ambassador's of-
fice, despite the 1962 Ken-
nedy letter issued by the 
late President after the Bay 
of Pigs debacle in Cuba. The 
letter designated ambassa-
dors as the primary author-
ity for all U.S. operations 
within their countries. 
"I remember discovering 
one operation within my last 
week of service in Chile that 
I didn't know about. The 
boys in the back room told 
me it was 'deep cover' and I 
told them: 'You guys were 
supposed to tell me 
everything,' " the former 
diplomat reminisced. 
As the 1964 election cam-
paign unfolded in Chile, the 
American intelligence and 
diplomatic establishments 
were divided from within 
over whether to support 
Frei or a more conservative 
candidate, Sen. Julio Duran. 
CIA's traditional line or-
ganization, centered in the 
Western Hemisphere divi-
sion and working through 
the traditional station chief 
structure, favored Duran in-
itially. So did then Ambassa-
dor. Charles Cole and the 
bulk of top State Depart-

hand, leaned toward Frei and 1 
the "democratic left" coali-
tion he represented. So, re. I 
portally, did the CIA's Cord ' 
Meyer. 
"For a while, we were at 
war among ourselves on the 
question of who to supports" 
recalled a participant in 
those events. 
Duran dropped from con-
sideration when he lost an 
important by-election to the 
Communists, and gradually 
the entire thrust of Ameri-
can support went to Frei. 
"The State Department 
maintained a facade of neu-
trality and proclaimed it 
from time to time," accord-
ing to one source who 
plaYed an important Wash-
ington role in inter-Ameri-
can policy at the time of the 
election. 
"Individual officers ? an 
economic counselor or a 
political counselor ? would 
look for opportunities. And 
'where it was a question of 
passing money, forming a 
newspaper or community de-
velopment program, the op-
erational people would do 
the work. 
"AID found itself sud- . 
denly overstaffed, looking 
around for peasant groups 
or projects for slum dwell-
ers," he recalled. "Once you 
established a policy of build-
ing support among peasant 
groups, government workers 
and trade unions, the strate-
' ? gies fell into place." 
? A former U.S. ambassador 
' to Chile has privately esti-
mated that the far-flung 
? covert program in Frei's be-
half cost about $20 million. 
In contrast, the figure that 
emerged hi Senate hearings 
as the amount ITT was will-
ing to spend in 1970 to de-
feat Allende was $1 million, 
The number of "special 
personnel" dispatched at 
various stages of the cam-
paign to Chile from Wash-
ington and other posts was 
calculated by one key Latin 
American policy maker at 
the time as being in the 
range of 100. 
, AID funds alone were sub-
. stantially increased for the 
year of the crucial election. 
The first program loan in 
Latin America, a $40 million 
general economic develop-
" ment 'grant, was approved to 
4,.1it/gata P84 -Mt 6a16 III

"we ain not want to have 
a condition of vast unem-
ployment as Chile was going 
into' the election," recalled 
the former AID official. 
In addition to U.S. govern-
ment ?asistance, Christian-
Democratic Party money was 
being funneled into Chile 
In Frel's behalf by the Ger-
man and Italian Christian 
Democratic parties. 
A in on g the important 
channels were the German 
Bishops Fund and the Aden-
auer Foundation, ivhich were 
managed by a Belgian Jesuit 
priest, Roger Vekemans, who 
has long been a controversial 
figure in Chile and other 
Latin American countries. 
Knowledgeable Americans 
believe that the European 
funds had no connection 
with the CIA programs. But 
Vekemans was a natural tar-
get of criticism by Frei's 
opponents in the super-
heated atmosphere of the 
time.

r. Broe said that, at a meeting with 
ITT vice president Edward Gerrity in 
New York, he explored "the feasibility 
of possible actions by the companies to 
apply some economic pressure on Chile." 
Such suggested action, Mr. Brea 
agreed at the Senate hearings, included 
withdrawal of technical help and delays 
in granting credit and in shipping parts. 
Regarding the CIA's attitude toward 
such steps, Mr. Broe testified: 
"These were ideas . . . passed up to 
me by people who work for me. I went 
upstairs, I talked to the people upstairs, 
and I was sent out to check out if they 
made any sense at all." 
But Mr. Broe said he got the idea that 
Mr. Gerrity "did not think it would 
work" and no action was taken. 
Charles Meyer, former Assistant Sec-
retary of State for Inter-American Af-
fairs, told the Senators that the CIA was 
only exploring options in talks with ITT, 
and that over-all U. S. policy of nonin-
tervention in Chile's affairs was main-
tained throughout. 
Wider investigation. What did all 
this add up to? The Senate's look at ITT 
is only part of a broader investigation 
into the activities of multinational corpo-
rations, expected to last several years. 
But testimony at the hearings could 
focus the subcommittee's attention more 
strongly on the part such corporations 
might play in trying to sway foreign 
governments and U. S. foreign policy. 
ITT is one of the largest that will 
come under Senate scrutiny. With sales 
of 8.6 billion dollars in 1972, it was the 
ninth biggest industrial company in the 
U. S. Its operations in 80 countries em-
ploy 428,000 persons. 
ITT subsidiaries in the U. S. bear such 
well-known names as Wonder bread, 
Morton frozen foods, Sheraton hotels, 
Scotts lawn products, the Hartford Fire 
Insurance Company. 
Claim for losses. With the first pub-
lished reports of ITT activity in the 
Chilean election, the Allende Govern-
ment broke off talks about compensating 
ITT for the nationalized telephone com-
pany. ITT has filed a claim for 92 mil-
lion dollars with the Overseas P-Ivate 
Investment Corporation, a federal agency 
that insures investors abroad agairst sev-
eral forms of damage, including exp:,,-
priation. The claim of ITT is under co!).? 
sideration by the OPIC. 
Further testimony by ITT Chairman 
Geneen was scheduled for arly

Said Senator Church, atter wo wc, 3

"It's obvious somebody is lyClg.'r 
Now COMING OUT of a congressional 
hearing are new disclosures on a 
2%-year-old story of international mystery 
concerning this question: 
Did a big multinational corpora-
tion, based in the U. S., attempt 
through the Central Intelligence 
Agency to block the election in 
1970 of Marxist Salvador Allende 
as President of Chile? 
The corporation is one of the world's 
largest?International Telephone & Tele-
graph, with connections extending into 
80 countries. 
The CIA's role was detailed in testi-
mony, before a special Senate Foreign 
Relations subcommittee, that offered 
rare public glimpses into the agency's 
undercover operations. 
Fear of nationalization. ITT's big 
stake in Chile is a telephone company, 
known as Chiltelco, which reportedly 
represents an investment of more than 
150 million dollars. The company, as 
ITT had feared, has been nationalized 
by the Allende Government. 
Main witnesses before th'e subcommit-
tee, headed by Senator Frank Church 
(Dem.), of Idaho, have been a number 
of the huge corporation's officials?and 
William V. Broe, a CIA agent who said 
he was in charge of "clandestine services" 
for the agency in the Western Hemi-
sphere in 1970. 
Their testimony largely related to 
events beginning about midsummer of 
1970, when Mr. Allende's chances of 
winning the Chilean Presidency were 
being assessed. In the September 4 vot-
ing, he gained a plurality. On October 
24, the Chilean Congress named him the 
country's chief executive. 
Election fund. The testimony was 
often conflicting. ITT officials acknowl-
edged that the corporation had been will-
ing to put up a large sum of money to be 
sent to Chile. But they differed on its 
intended use. 
John A. McCone, an ITT director and 
a former Director of the CIA, said 1 mil-
lion dollars was offered "for the purpose 
of bringing about a coalition against 
Allende." 
Another witness said the money was 
meant for a housing program. A third 
testified it would have gone for "any 
program the U. S. might formulate."

Star-News Staff Writer 
Chairman Frank Church, D-
Idaho, of the Senate multina-
tional corporations subcom-
mittee plans to introduce leg-
islation that would make it a 
federal crime for a business 
organization to contribute 
money to finance operations 
of the Central Intelligence 
Agency. 
Church announced this in-
tent at the close yesterday of 
two weeks of hearings into the 
machinations of ITT Corp. 
,with CIA and other gevern-
ment agencies in the internal 
affairs of Chile. The hearings 
produced testimony that ITT 
and CIA approached each 
other at different times in the 
Chilean election period of 1970 
with suggestions for affecting 
the outcome of the election 
and the Chilean economy. 
But Church indicated that 
the subcommittee would not 
pursue his threat to send the 
? 
transcript of the hearings to 
the Justice Department on 
suspicion of perjury. Church 
announced last week that he 
believed "someone is lying" 
when testimony of ITT execu-
tives appeared to conflict with 
that of U.S. government wit-
nesses and other ITT officials. 
Church said the inconsisten-
cies now seem to be due to 
lapses of time or memory, or 
a failure to communicate 
among those involved in the 
sensational ITT documents on 
Chile. 
HS/HC- kr?

"I feel the wider the dis-
tance between big business 
and the CIA the better for all 
concerned," Church declared. 
"Legislation to accomplish 
this may be one of the better, 
outgrowths of these hearings. 
? We cannot have this inces-
tuous relationship between 
the CIA and U.S. companies 
operating abroad." 
Ilarold S. Geneen, ITT 
board chairman, occupied the 
witness chair for most of yes-
terday as the subcommittee 
wound up the hearings. 
Geneen's testimony was that 
there were two distinct phas-
es to ITT's thinking on Chile 
in 1970: One in the summer 
when Marxist Salvador Al-
lende was campaigning on a 
platform of expropriation that 
ITT believed would cost the 
corporation its $153 million 
investment; the other during 
the autumn when Allende 
looked to be a sure winner 
requiring only confirmation ; 
by the Chilean Congress. - 
Geneen accepted testimony 
of CIA agent William V. Broe 
that Geneen had offered a 
substantial sum for any gov-
ernment plan that would 
block Allende, Although he 
said he did not recall doing it. 
But Geneen said that money 
offer "died" when Broe re-
jected the offer in July 1970. 
"The next offer was entire-
ly separate and had a dual 
purpose," Geneen testified. 
"The offer of $1 million was 
openly presented to two de-
partments of government 
(The National Security Coun-
cil and the State Department) 
. It was to make Allende more 
receptive to us and other

verage of the U.S. Government. Those 
days are long past. But executives of the 
International Telephone and Telegraph 
Corp., the largest U.S. conglomerate, 
apparently yearn to carry on in the not-
so-grand old tradition. The testimony in 
two weeks of hearings by the Senate 
Subcommittee on Multinational Corpo-
rations, which showed how ITT and the 
Central Intelligence Agency conferred 
on ways to block the election of Marxist 
Salvador Allende in Chile 2'A years ago, 
provided enough juicy material to keep

busy for years.

JULY 16, 1970. Broe met with ITT 
Chairman Harold Geneen in Washing-
ton. The meeting had been proposed to 
Richard Helms, then the CIA chief, by 
John McCone, an ITT director and for-
mer head of the CIA. Broe said that Ge-
neen told him that ITT was willing to 
put up a "substantial fund" to support a 
conservative candidate for President in 
the elections in Chile to be held Sept. 4. 
According to Broe, at that time the CIA 
declined the proposal because the U.S. 
was not supporting a candidate in the 
Chilean election. 
SEPT. 4. Allende won a 36% plurality 
but still had to face a run-off vote in the 
Chilean Congress Oct. 24.

OCT. 24. Allende was elected by the 
Chilean Congress. Later he nationalized 
many U.S. companies, including M"s 
Chilean telephone subsidiary. 
During the hearings, several wit-
nesses gave conflicting versions of the 
purpose of the million-dollar offer. Con-
trary to McCone's testimony that the 
money was to be used for an anti-Allen-
de coalition, Gerrity maintained that it 
was for constructive programs, such as 
housing and social development, "to 
make Allende happy about the Ameri-
can presence." Later, Charles A. Meyer, 
then Assistant Secretary of State for In-
ter-American Affairs, repeatedly em-
phasized that the U.S. policy towardi 
Chile during this period was one of strict 
non-intervention--a statement that 
seemed to conflict with Broe's testimony 
about CIA suggestions to create econom-
ic disturbances in Chile. 
"It is obvious," said Subcommittee 
Chairman Frank Church, "that some-
body is lying." Members of the subcom-
mittee will review the transcripts of the 
testimony to decide whether to send 
them to the Justice Department for pos-
sible charges of perjury. 
For either private companies or the 
U.S. Government to intervene in a free 
election is, as Church said, "very im-
proper." Beyond the question of propri-
ety, the troubling aspect of the ITT af-
fair is that it will fan suspicions in 
foreign countries that multinational 
corporations commonly use their finan-
cial powers to influence foreign political 
affairs directly. To date, there is little 
public evidence that other companies 
have in recent years tried to meddle as 
ITT sought to do. 
Senator Charles Percy noted during 
the hearings that corporations have an 
obligation to protect their assets and the 
interests of their shareholders. But, he 
said, such protection must not improp-
erly involve the corporation in the inter-
nal affairs of the host country or contra-
dict U.S. foreign policy. In Chile, most 
of the U.S. corporations?except ITT 
?have followed that standard, even at 
a loss. Ford, for instance, simply pulled 
out of Chile, wrote off a $16 million loss 
and settled for a $900,000 payment 
from the federally financed Overseas 
Private Investment Corp. (cow), which 
insures multinational corporations 
against expropriation. ITT now stands 
to lose whatever compensation Allende 
had promised to pay; and unless the 
company can disprove the mounting ev-
idence that its loss resulted from its at-
tempt to interfere in Chilean politics, it 
may also lose its $92.5 million claim 
with the ?Pic. To knock down that ev-
idence will be Harold Geneen's task in

ATEST GOVERNMENT operation to feel 
L. the effects of a shake-up in its estab-
lished bureaucracy is the supersecret 
Central Intelligence Agency. 
The man behind what promises to be a 
sweeping reorganization is the CIA's 
new Director, James H. Schlesinger, who 
has had this tag pinned on him inside 
Government circles: "President Nixon's 
bureaucracy tamer." 
"Tough guy." Mr. Schlesinger came 
to the CIA post from the Chairmanship 
of the Atomic Energy Commission, where 
he was also looked on as ...tough guy." 
Says one Government source: 
? "At the AEC he turned things upside 
down at first. Everyone there was up 
tight. But, in the end, his overhaul 
improved morale at AEC tremendously. 
"Now he has started out the same way 
at CIA?and it looks as if he will get 
the same results." 
As with most activities of the CIA, 
the Schlesinger-ordered shake-up of per-
sonnel is being conducted pretty much 
under wraps. 
No one in authority is saying?if any-
one really knows?bow many of the esti-
mated 15,000 on the payroll will be 
squeezed out before it is all Over. 
Estimates of a 10 per cent cut have 
been reported. Knowledgeable sources 
say that is too high?but it is acknowl-
edged that the reduction now under way 
is the biggest ever at the CIA, which has 
had others in the past. 
Improvements ahead. The overhaul 
is across the board?young and old, peo-
ple from all areas of the agency. 
Every personnel folder is being read. 
The four main directorates in the agency 
?administration, plans, science and in-
telligence?are each handling the me-
chanics of review ill their divisions. 
Some tasks are being eliminated as 
outmoded, no longer needed in the 
changing intelligence ?vorld ()I' today. 
But, at the same time, the word is out 
at CIA that the shake-up is designed to 
improve American in gathering 
?not scuttle it. A slogan that began to 
be heard with Mr. Schlesinger's Jake-
Over was: "Intelligence is Our first Nue 
of defense." 
After the initial shock of the reduc-. 
lions, some CIA officials began to take 
second looks?and decided that what they 
saw was laAt; 
HS/HC-9,r0 
ever said the agency would be strength-
ened by getting rid of fat and deadwood 
?and didn't mind as long as it didn't 
include him?was right." 
The critics' view. Not everyone, of 
course, felt that way. Fears were ex-
pressed that the cuts will result in reduc-
ing the effectiveness of the CIA, and 
that intelligence work as a career will 
be less of an attraction. 
Said one such critic: 
"Whoeyq succeeds Schlesinger will 
have the- job of building the organi-
zation back up to be able to do its job."

promoted. 
For example, the vet-
eran William E. Colby, 
who had been high in the 
hierarchy as executive di-
rector, has been moved up 
to deputy director for 
plans. 
A hard worker, Mr. 
Schlesinger, 44, was named 
to the CIA post by Mr. 
Nixon in December, re-
placing It ichard lidl ins, 
who was appointed Ambas-
sador to Iran. 
The new Director is described as a 
hard worker, usually on the job from 
7 a.m. to 7 p.m. But, an official says, 
he does not demand that kind of day 
from those Nvlio work for him. Instead, 
this source explains: 
"He makes it clear that vhat he wants 
is results, not time-clock punchers. As 
long as the work is done in time, he 
doesn't bother too much about the hours 
spent on it." 
Mr. Schlesinger was a SUSUMU CUM

Ph.D. degree there in 1956.

.1.A. Apparently Plans 
Cut in Some Covert Roles 
By CLIFTON DANIEL 
Speolat to The New leek Times 
WASHINGTON, April 1?
Under its new director the 
Central Intelligence Agency is 
apparently planning to curtail 
some of its old activities, no-
tably clandeStine Military oper-
ations, and undertake some new 
ones. These Include ? action 
against political terrorism and 
the ? international drug traffic. 
Since .James R. .Schlesinger 
took over as director on Feb. 2 
more than 1,000 employes of 
the C.I.A. have received dis-
missal notices. Mr. Schlesinger 
also has authority from Presi-
dent Nixon to apply what one 
official calls "a great deal of 
persuasive influence" to reduce 
manpower as well in the 
Intelligence services. These 
are the Defense Intelligence 
Agency and the National Secu-
rity Agency, which Mr. Schle-
singer oversees but does not 
operate. 
In the last two years ,the in-
telligence establishment as a 
whole has been reduced by' 
something like 25 per cent, ac-
cording to reliable estimates. 
In . 1971 there were, more 
than 150,000 people In the mili-
tary and diplomatic intelligence 
services and the C.I.A. There 
are now fewer than 125,000, ac-
cording to the estimates?per-
haps no more. than , 115,000. 
Since November, 1971, the vari-
ous agencies have been under 
orders in a memorandum from 
the President to reduce dupli-
cation of facilities and func-
tions and make more economi-
cal use of their resources, es-
pecially in -collecting informa-
tion, 
Intelligence information these 
days is gathered more by ma-
chines than by men?by satel-
lites and computers rather than 
by spies meeting informers in 
bars and alleys. 
Each intelligence agency 
seems to want its own machines 
and some systems have report-
edly been made deliberately in-
compdtible so that each agen-
cy keeps its own. 
For that reason and others 
it is said here that President 
Nixon's 1971 memorandum has 
as yet had ,no ,measurable ef-
fect on the operations of the

intelligence community. 
The man principally respon-
sible for drafting the Presi-
dent's memorandum was Mr. 
Schlesinger and he has now 
been given the authority to 
put it into effect. He got the 
job because as assistant direc-
tor of the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget and later as 
chairman of the Atomic Ener-
gy Commission he earned a 
reputation for efficiency and 
effectiveness. 
Apparently Mr. Schlesinger 
G expected to do in the Intel-
litence community what other 
recent Presidential appointees 
have been instructed to do in 
more open departments?that 
is, to make the Federal bu-
reaucracy more responsive to 
the Administration, 
This objective has led to 
charges from some old hands 
at the C.I.A. that the agency 
is being "politicized" by the 
Nixon Administration. Mr. 
Schlesinger met this charge, 
when his C.I.A. appointment 
was up for confirmation in the 
Senate, by assuring the Senate 
Armed Services Committee that 
he believed absolutely in main-
taining the integrity and inde-
pendence of intelligence esti-
mates. 
People who know President 
Nixon 't; attitude say he wants 
ihis intelligence information 
straight even when it is un-
palatable. However, the White 
House does want to see less 
money spent on intelligence, 
and a better intelligence prod-
uct provided. 
By a better product the 
White House apparently means 
among other things a product 
that answers the questions that 
? senior policy makers are inter-
ested in and gives the answers 
In brief and readable form. 
"You can't drop a 90-page 
C.I.A. analysis on a high offi-
cial's desk and say 'You've got 
to read this,'" one such official 
aid recently. 
That Discouraging Thud 
- "The thud it makes when 
It fails on your desk is enough 
to discourage you from open-
ing it," another said. 
" Apparently C.I.A. memoran-
dums under the Schlesinger re-
gime will number more like 
three pages than 90 and will 
have a telephone number to 
call if the recipient wants fur-
ther information.?  ' 
While seeking greater econ-
omy and efficiency the intelli-
gence community is reassess-
ing its tasks. 
There appears to be a ten-
dency to cut back on C.I.A. 
paramilitary operations ? op-
erations such as the abortive 
Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba 
in 1961 and the clandestine 
war still being waged in Laos, 
operations that have some-
times brought the agency as 
much censure as praise. 
In his second Inaugural Ad-
dress, President Nixon said, 
"The time has passed when 
America will make every oth-
er nation's conflict our own, 
or make every other nation's 
future our responsibility, or 
presume to tell the people of 
other nations how to manage 
their own affairs." 
That statement seemed to 
Imply less intervention in oth-
er people's affairs, whether by 
intelligence agencies or other-
wise. 
In any event, operations such 
as the one in Laos, where the 
C.I.A. has long given support 
- and leadership to the anti-
Communist military forces, are 
on such a scale that they can-
not be conducted secretly, and 
thus may not be thought Suit-
able for an undercover agency. 
'Dirty Tricks' Wane 
Operations on a smaller 
scale?sometimes called "dirty 
tricks"?reflect the atmosphere 
of the nineteen-fifties, the cold 
war period, and seem to he 
regarded now as obsolescent. 
Also with the reduction of 
international tensions and sus-
picions, which is the aim of 
President Nixon's dealings with 
the Soviet Union .and China, 
the intelligence community may 
not need to pay so much atten-
tion to the military abilities 
of the major powers. 
However, there may be new 
tasks for the intelligence com-
munity in an era of negotia-
tion. 
For example, the protocol to 
the Soviet-American agreement 
on the limitation of strategic 
offensive weapons provides in 
Article 12 that "for the pur-
pose of providing assurance of 
compliance with provisions of 
this treaty, each party shall 
use national technical means 
of verification." 
In plain language, that means 
that the Soviet Union and the 
United States may each use its 
own photographic satellites and 
other intelligence-collectint de-
vices to see whether the other 
side is abiding by the treaty. 
This is the '"open skies" policy 
proposed by President Dwight 
D. Eisehnower at the Geneva 
summit conference in 1955 and 
rejected at that time by the 
Russians. 
There are also other new 
problems to attract the inter-
est of the intelligence agencies. 
One is the narcotics traffic. 
Intelligence is a major ingredi-
ent in controlling it. 
Another is_ political terror-
ism, a form of warfare that 
cannot be dealt with by ordi-
nary diplomatic means or con 
ventional military forces. 
The interest of the C.I.A. 
in these problems does not 
mean that the agency will no 
longer have an arm that can 
perform paramilitary functions. 
It also does not mean that 
the C.I.A.?to use a term hear 
here?will not "invest" funds 
in the affairs of third coun-
tries on occasion.

proval. 
How did this square with 
the policy of neutrality to 
which both Korry and 
Meyer attested? Meyer sug-
gested that there was no in-
consistency. The govern-. 
ment maintained the right, 
he said, to explore options. 
Subcommittee members 
reacted with skeptical grum-
bles. Had ITT decided to 
carry out Broe's suggestions, 
Chairman Frank Church (D-
Idaho) pointed out, the 
"option" would have become 
an operational policy. ITT, 
as it turned out, felt the 
? plan was unworkable. As 
formulated by Broe and the 
agency, it would have been 
up to ITT to execute on its 
own. 
The gist of the plan was 
for a group of American 
. companies, under ITT prod-
ding, to use their financial 
clout to accelerate?as Broe 
testified?"the deteriorating 
, economic situation" in 
' Chile. The objective was to 
turn wavering Christian 
Democratic congressmen 
away. from Allende in final 
balloting, 
In his conversations with 
ITT Vice President Edward 
Gerrity, Broe told the sub-
committee, "it was under-

be doing it and CIA was not 
involved. It was ITT which 
was looking into the thing."

By OSWALD JOHNSTON 
Star-News Staff Writer 
James R. Schlesinger, , the 
. new director of Central Intelli-
gence, goes before a Congres-
s? 
sional committee today in his 
first formal legislative appear-
ance since reports began to 
? circulate) of a major shakeup 
at the CIA. 
.' ? Schlesinger's testimony be-
' ? fore the House Armed Serv-
ices watchdog subcommittee 
on the Central Intelligence 
Agency will, as usual,, be se-
` c r e t. But congressional 
sources are not hiding their 
? expectations that questioning 
? will focus on two reported as-
pects of an ongoing purge of 
CIA ranks: 
? That the White Howe has 
. ordered a concerted ideologi-
cal attack on the supposedly 
liberal bias of the CIA's small 
but elite Office of National'Es-
timates, which is nominally 
responsible for producing the 
worldwide intelligence assess-
ments upon which President 
Nixon, Henry A..Kissinger and 
the 'National Security Council 
base policy decisions. 
? That Schlesinger is simulta-
neously implementing a White 
House directive first handed 
down 16 months ago to stream-
line both budget and manpow-
er resources in the nation's 
unwielding $5 billion-a-year in-
telligence operation. 
Ostensibly, the question be-
fore the subcommittee chair-
man, Lucien N. Nedzi, 
D-IVfich., is whether Congress 
should raise from 800 to 2,100 
the legal ceiling on the num-
ber of CIA employes who may, 
claim retirement benefits and 
? leave office after ' 20 years ' 
service. 
But Nedzi left no doubt that 
Schlesinger will alsobe 
quizzed on the scope and mo-
tive of the intelligence agency 
purge. "Undoubtedly, ques-
tions will be asked about how 
many men are leaving ? and 
why," Nedzi said in an inter-
view yesterday. 
Speculations aside, it is still 
not clear how far Schlesinger's 
? new broom will sweep, and to 
what end. 
Varying %ports have the 
15,000-man agency facing a 
cutback of from 1,500 to 1,800 
e.mployes. One report, which 
C 
?45thiesinger 
CIA officials sought to mini-
mize, said the agency eventu-
ally would be cleared of as 
many as 3,000 underachievers 
in annual installments of. 1,000. 
At the same time, some 
agency veterans close to 
outgoing Director Richard M. 
Helms, whose own departure a 
few m,onths short of retire-
ment age gave rise to specula-
tion the White House was dis-
enchanted with his perform-
ance, were reportedly asked to 
leave on only a few hours no-
tice. 
Sources close to the intelli-
gence community are appalled 
by what one former CIA'offi-
cial termed the "peculiar bru-
tality" ofSchlesisnger's 
house-cleaning, and apprehen-
sive over what it may mean., 
But they are far from certain.' 
One view, expressed by a 
source of long eperience in the 
intelligence community, sees a 
conscious effort to punish the 
CIA's intelligence assessors by 
? cutting back their influencence 
, and enhancing that of the Pen-
tagon's rival Defense Intelli-
gence Agency. 
In this view, the CIA purge 
JAMES R. SCHLESINGER 
now in progress was foresha-
dowed by the administration's 
bureaucratic assault earlier 
this year on the Arms Control 
and Disarmament Agency, 
which in quick sucession lost 
one-third of its budget, 12 staff 
positions, most of its frontline 
veteran officials and much of 
its influence in the new rounds 
ntroversial CI Shakeup 
? of strategic arms limitation 
talks with the Russians. 
It is pointed out that the CIA 
estimators for years now have 
backed the longstanding disar?
mament argument that on-site 
inspection of Soviet missile fa-
cilities is not necessary to en-
sure that the Russians are liv-
? ing up to a disarmament' 
! agreement. 
At the other extreme, one 
former CIA official dismissed 
the .whole Schlesinger exercise 
as "a phony operation." So 
? far, this source argued, there 
Is no evidence that any really 
Important changes are being 
made. 
. One indication this ma ir be 
so is the fact that the newly 
appointed deputy director of 
? i 
plans?the man n charge of 
the CIA's worldwide clandes-
tine "department of dirty . 
tricks" operations?is William 
E. . Colby, the former bead of 
the American Pacification 
? Program in South Vietnam. 
Despite the CIA's good repu-
tation from the Pentagon Pa- . 
pers as a gloomy but accurate 
forecaster of events in Indo-
rchinar it was Colby's side of 
the agency's operations that in 
large part engineered the orig-
inal U.S. involvement in Laos 
and South Vietnam during the 
early 1960's. 
More generally, however, ? 
speculation is focused on the 
CIA's Intelligence evaluation 
function, rather than on the 
? Operations side. 
In the main, informed 
sources are resisting the 
suggestion that the White 
House would deliberately at-
tack the agency's intelligence 
estimators simply because the 
reports they have produced 
were unwelcome: 
"This is our last h ? ? ? ," one 
source said. "A b? ? y inde-
pendent enough to say a policy 
,is no good if that is what it 
believes." 
At the same time, many in-
telligence experts concede that 
the Office of National Esti-
? mates is "old and tired," and 
out of touch with the needs of , 
? Kissinger and his National Se-
=ray Council specialists. 
These close observers of the 
Intelligence scene note that the 
Office of National Estimates 
consists of at most 30 senior 
officials in the agency. It re-
? mains an elite corps, so far 
untouched by the purge, and 
there are no Immediate signs 
that its chairman, John Hu-
izenga, is being asked to retire 
prematurely.' 
? In the 'main, they see the 
shakeup as motivated more by 
? efficiency than by ideology. 
Helms, the former CIA 
director, received a mandate 
to streamline the intelligence 
community in November 1971, 
when Nixon announced a re-
organization plan of which 
Schlesinger, then in the Budg-
et Bureau, was the main au-
thor. 
On the surface, the plan 
gave Helms sweeping authori-
ty over the whole intelligence 
community. But during his re-
maining year as director, 
Helms did virtually nothing on 
this missoin, and his inaction 
, is viewed as a key reason for 
his premature departure. 
There are some signs Helms 
quietly resented this turn of 
events and felt he was never 
? given the White House back-
ing he believed would be nec-
essary to tarry out the re- ? 
sponsibility he was given. 
It is an open secret that 
some 85 Percent of the esti-
mated $4.5 billion to $5 billion 
intelligence budget each year' 
is under the direct control of 
the Pentagon. But Helms, it is' 
pointed out by former inti-
mates, was never given au-
thority to go up against the 
Defense secretary. 
Nevertheless, these sources 
scoff at speculation that the 
recent CIA recruitment of two 
highly regarded Pentagon in-
telligence analysts ? Maj. 
Gen. Daniel 0. Graham of the 
Army and Maj. Gen. Lew Al- - 
len of the Air Force is a 
means of putting ideological 
pressure on the Office of Na-
tional Estimates. 
Graham and Allen, it is 
pointed out, have been named 
'to purely managerial positions 
on an inter-agency Intelligence 
Resourpe Advisory Commit-
tee, a 'board set up in the 
Schlesinger-Nixon intelligende 
reorganization 'of ? 1971, but

CIA Sent 'Ideas' 
ige to ITT 
? By JEREMIAH O'LEARY 
Star-News Staff Writer 
The Central Intelligence 
Agency has admitted, through 
the testimony of one of its 
agents to Senate investiga-
tors, that it generated and 
passed to ITT a series of ideas 
for disrupting the economy of 
Chile during the crucial Chil-
ean election period in 1970. 
William V. Broe, former 
chief of CIA clandestine ser-
vices in the Western Hemis-
phere, told the Senate sub-
committee on multinational 
corporations in testimony re-
leased yesterday: 
"They were ideas staffed, 
they were passed up to me by 
? people who work.- for me. I 
went upstairs (to his CIA su-
periors) and I was sent out 
to check if they made any 
sense at all." 
Previous testimony by Broe 
revealed that he took the eco-
nomic disruption ideas and a 
list of American firms in Chile 
to New York on Sept. 29, 1970 
and presented them to ITT 
Senior Vice President Edward 
Gerrity. The purpose of do-
ing this, Broe said, was to 
determine whether the ideas 
were feasible. 
But Broe told the subcom-
mittee headed by Sen. Frank 
Church, D-Idaho, that Gerrity 
was negative toward the pro-
sals and said the ideas 
make aneivis 
committee released the sec-
ond phase of Broe's testimony 
yesterday, it was unclear who 
had generated the plans and 
whether the New York meet-
ing was a serious discussion 
of action that might be taken. 
Included in the plans Broe 
suggested to the ITT executive 
were: that banks should delay 
or not renew credits; that 
companies drag their feet on 
spending, making deliveries 
or shipping spare parts; that 
preSsure be created on sav-
ings and loan institutions so 
they would, have to close and 
that all technical assistance 
be withdrawn from Chile. 
Brae also testified about 
other meetings with ITT ex-
ecutives, including one ITT 
President Harold S. Geneen in 
Washington on July 16, 1970, 
at which he said Geneen of-
fered a substantial but un-
specified fund to support any 
U.S. government plan to de-
feat Marxist presidential can-
didate Salvador Alien d e. 
Broe's testimony was that 
Geneen said this money was 
, to be used to back the cam-
paign of conservative candi-
date Jorge Alessandri. Broe 
testified that he rejected the 
offer, just as Gerrity did not 
follow through with later CIA 
proposals when Allende fin-
ished first in the popular 
election and was on the verge 
of a runoff victory, in the Chi-

Washington, March 20 (NEWS Bureau)?A vice president of Inter-

Salvador Allende from becoming president of Chile in 1970. 
The ITT official, William R. Merriam, who headed the

Foreign Relations subcommittee that ITT had committed 
no "improper actions" and did not actually work with the

CIA 
400,000 Ch e 
By Laurence Stern 
Washington Post Staff Writer - 
Senate investigators sought to elab-
orate yesterday on a report that the 
Central Intelligence Agency was au-
thorized to spend $400,000 for covert 
propaganda action against Marxist, 
presidential candidate Salvador Al-
lende in Chile during the summer of 
1970. 
The existence of the fund was first 
broached by Jerome Levinson, counsel 
to the Senate Foreign Relations Sub- - 
committee on Multinational Corpora-
tions,- during the questioning of former 
Ambassador to Chile Edward Korry. 
Korry confirmed that he knew a sen-
ior interdepartmental intelligence' 
group of the National Security Council 
met to discuss the CIA's strategy to-
ward Allende in late May or. early June 
of 1970. 
But he referred the subcommittee 
to CIA Director James R. Schlesinger 
on the question of whether the NSC 
policy group allocated $400,000 for co-
vert propaganda activities against 
Allende. 
The National Security Council com-
mittee to which Levinson referred is 
the government's senior policy forum 
for covert intelligence operations, and 
functions under the direction cf Na-
tional Security Adviser Henry Kis-
singer. 
"Anything to do with activities of 
.the CIA, I am not going to reply to," 
Korry told Levinson. "It is the obliga-
tion of the CIA director to advise you." 
Last week former CIA Director John 
A. McCone told the subcommittee he 
had been advised by Richard M. Helms, 
the agency's director in 1070, that "a 
minimal effort" bad been authorized in 
the Allende election "within the flexi-
bility" of the CIA's budget. 
McCone said Helms also told him 
the senior interdepartmental commit-
tee, known as the Forty Committee, 
had considered the matter and decided 
that nothing of a major nature should 
be clone to block Allende's election. 
The subcommittee is examining whe-
ther the International Telephone and 
Telegraph Corp. exercised improper 
influence in the Chilean presidential 
election to stave off nationalization of 
its Chilean telephone company sub-
sidiary, and whether U.S. government. 
agencies worked in collusion with ITT 
in an attempt to prevent Allende from 
assuming the presidency, 
Korry, in an afternoon of testimonial 
sparring, declined to tell the subcom-
mittee what instructions he had re-
ceived from the State Department in 
the crucial period between Allende's 
popular election on Sept. 4, 1970, and 
his installation by the Chilean Con-
gress the following Oct. 24. 
"I have Aloft iviTor,R6,44. 
-mid Reported 
tween an embassy and its government," , 
the former ambassador told the sub-
committee. 
The question of Washington's in- r 
structions to Korry came in the eon-
text of an ITT document in 
the subcommittee's possessien 
-1-a copy of a cable from two 
executives of the firm on Sept. 
17, 1970, from Santiago to 
ITT's New York headquarters. 
: The message said: "Late 
Tuesday night (Sept. 15) Am-
bassador Edward Korry finally 
received a message from the 
State Department giving him 
the green light to move in the 
name of President Nixon. The 
message gave him maximum 
authority to do all possible ? 
short of a Dominican Republic-
type action?to keep Allende 
from taking power." 
Korry said the ITT cable 
was "erroneous" and that he 
had not received instructions 
to .do all he could .to stop 
Allende. But he persisted in 
refusing to tell his questioners 
what his instructions were. 
'The former ambassador, who 
served in Santiago from 1967 
to 1971, acknowledged that he 
did personally favor a strategy 
to block Allende's election by 
Congress. This strategy, the 
tAlessandri Formula," was de-
signed to pave the way for 
election of former Christian 
Democratic President Eduardo 
'Fret. 
Korry said he discussed the 
Alessandri Formula with rep-
resentatives of American busi-
ness in Chile Who were con-
cerned about expropriation 
under Allende. "But there was 
no concerted effort on their 
part to sell me or on my part 
to sell them," he testified. 
There was strong American 
corporate support for the plan 
until it became clear that it 
did not have enough support 
in the Chilean Congress.

submitted the transcript to 
the CIA for review. Church 
said it was uniwecedented for 
an operating agent of the 
agency to give sworn testi-
mony to a congressional inves-
tigating committee. 
Broe testified that he went 
to the meeting with Geneen at 
the Sheraton Carlton Hotel. on 
I he night of july 16, 1970, un-
der instructions from then 
(71,i. director Richard M. 
Halms, who was recently re-
placed by President Nixon and 
appoint ed Ambassador , to 
Iran - 
The CIA witness said Ge-
neen told him that ITT and 
other American companies 
raised a political fund to influ-
ence the outcome of the 1964 
Chilean .election, when Chris-
tian Democrat Eduardo Frei 
came to power, but that John 
McCone, then the director, did 
not accept the money. 
Brae's testimony indicated. 
that the agency took a more 
cooperative attitude with ITT 
in subsequent meetings, fol-
lowing Allende's narrow popu-
lar plurality on Sept. 4, 1970, 
but before he was installed by 
a vote of the Chilean Congress 
'the following month. 
The CIA's endorsement of 
this economic pressure, said 
Broe, was designed to discour-
age Christian Democratic con-
gressmen from supporting Al-
lende, a Marxist-Socialist, in 
the crucial congressional bal-
loting on the presidency. 
"There was a thesis," said 
Broe, "that additional deterio-
ration in the economic situa-
tion could influence a large 
number of Christian Demo-
cratic Congressmen who were 
planning to vote for Allende." 
He told the subcommittee 
that ITT executives were neg-
ative toward the plan because 
they 'felt it was unworkable. 
The maneuver, described in 
Chile as the "Alessandri For-
mula," was looked ? upan fa-
vorably by then U.S. Ambas-
sador Edward Korry and ITT, 
as well as by Allende's Chilean 
opposition, as a means of re-
storing Frei to the presidency 
by setting the stage for a .new 
election. 
It never came to pass. 
Church said yesterday he 
thought it was "very im-
proper" for any American cor-
poration to offer a large sum 
of money to support a CIA in-
tervention in an election. Ile 
said it was also. "improper pol-
icy" for the U.S. government 
to enlist private corporations 
in the same objective. 
In a meeting with newsmen, 
the Idaho Democrat said he 
could not clarify the apparent 
contradiction between Broe's 
declaration to Geneen that the 
CIA was not supporting a can-
didate in the elction and 
'Pine's subsequent endorse-
ment of economic pressures 
designed to prevent Allende 
from taking office. Broe's tes-
timony, he said, "would have 
to speak for itself." 
Sen, Clifford P. Case (R-
N.J.) also observed that "the' 
record to me is not cleats"! 
One possibility under con-
sideration is that the policy of 
the U.S. government under-
went change between Broe's 
first contact with Geneen and 
his subsequent meeting with 
Gerrity.

On Sept. 16 Kissinger deliv-

whole Western Hemisphere 
. . . So we are taking a close 
look at the situation. It is not 
one in which our capacity for 
influence is very great at this 
particular mornent . . ." 
An intensive lobbying pro-
gram was conducted during 
mid-September by ITT offi-
cials with top administration 
officials for some form of in-
tervention in Chile. Geneen's 
offer of financial aid for a 
CIA operation was rejected. 
But on Sept. 29 Broe, acting 
with the full consent of his su-
periors, endorsed an economic
program to frustrate Allende's 
candidacy in the Chilean Con-
gress. 
Broe testified that he also 
met with ITT's former - Wash-
ington office director Williarn 
Merriam on Sept. 22, a week 
prior to the Gerrity meeting, 
and gave his assent to ITT 
proposals for covert; support 
to anti-Allende newspapers as 
well as the hiring of radio and 
television "propagandists" 
favoring other candidates. 
"Mr. Merriam, without any 
discussion of those (proposals), 
said, 'What do you think of 
the proposals', and I said I 
think they are all right," Broe 
testified. "Then there was no 
discussion." 
The anti-Allende press and 
television campaign was pro-
posed by two ITT field opera-
tives, Hal Hendrix and Robert 
Berrellez from Santiago. ITT 
officials testified that they 
never put the plan into opera-
tion. 
The purpose of Church's in-
quiry is to determine whether 
ITT brought improper influ-
ence in Chile to affect the out-
come of the 1970 election and 
the extent to which it had the 
active cooperation of the CIA. 
Err and a number of other 
companies contended that 
their fears of an Allende ad-
ministration were prompted, 
by campaign pledges of the 
Approved For Release/2001/06/09 : CIA-RDP84-00499R0010^0001-3 
Socialist candidate to national-
ize basic industries, such as 
ITrs telephone subsidiary as 
well as American owned cop-
per and bank holddings. 
Allende's government con-
tended that it was negotiating 
in good faith to compensate 
ITT for the telephone com-
pany until March 21, 1972, 
when columnist Jack Ander-
son published internal ITT 
documents suggesting that the 
corporation had actively en-
gaged in plans to block the 
election of Allende. 
On the day the Anderson 
papers were published, the 
Chilean Ambassador to the 
United States, Orlando Lete-
lier, had just returned from 
Santiago with a counter-offer 
to ITT, according to Chilean 
government sources. After 
publication of the documents, 
Chile broke off its contacts 
with ITT. 
At yesterday's hearing the 
Assistant Treasury Secretary 
for International Affairs, John 
M. Hennessy, said the Nixon 
administration cautioned in-
ternational lending organiza-
tions against extending new 
lines of credit to an Allende 
government because of its 
shaky financial condition, 
He acknowledged, however, 
that the administration ha d 
authorized a $10 million loan 
to the Chilean military last 
year: 
"That seems to me from an 
economic point of view en-
tirely inconsistent," observed 
Case. 
Replied Hennessy: "I would 
have to admit there is some 
inconsistency."

C.I.A. Aide Says He Gave! 
Anti-.Allende Plan to 1.7' .T. 
By E-LEEN SHANAHAN ? d 
.Spocat to T11,, New York Times 
WASHINGTON, March 28?An official of the Central' 
Intelligence Agency-_ has testified that in 1970 he proposed 
to the International Telephone Ind Telegraph Corporation a 
series of steps that it and 
other American companies 
might take to create enough 
economic instability in Chile 
to prevent the election of Dr.1 
Salvador Allende Gossens as I 
President. 
The testimony came from I 
William V. Brae, who was in 
charge of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency's clandestine op-
erations in Lcit'n America in 
1970. Mr. Broe, still a C.I.A. 
official, said that be had acted 
with the full knowledge of the 
man who at the time headed 
the agency, Richard Helms. 
'Substantial Fund' Offered 
Mr. Broe testified yesterday 
before a closed session of the 
subcommittee on multinational 
corporations of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee. 
Twenty-six pages of transcript 
were made public today. The 
subcommittee and the Central 
Intelligence Agency are still 
discussing the release of 18 
more pages, but tile subcom-
mittee chairman, Senator Frank 
Church, Democrat of Idaho, 
said that he thought that the 
remaining pages were of rela-
tively little importance. 
Mr. Broe also said that 
Harold S. Geneen, chairman of 
the board of I.T.T., had initiated 
the first contacts between his 
company and the Central Intel-
ligence Agency in the summer 
of 1970. 
At that time, according to 
Mr. Broe, Mr. Geneen offered 
the C.I.A. "a substantial fund" 
to support the election of Jorge 
Alessandri Rodriguez, one of 
two relatively conservative can-
-Mates running against Dr. Al-
cede, a Marxist who was the 
candidate of a Socialist-Com-
munist coalition. 
Mr. Broe said that he had 
turned down Mr. Gcneen's of-
fer, as I.T.T. officials testified 
earlied had been the case. 
Mr. Broe also said that he 
told Mr. Geneen that the C.I.A. 
could notA _"serve as ja funding 
channel" ifirfPIRY.PaaFHPraft 
"the United States Government 
was not supporting any candid 
date in the Chilean election." 
A Different Position Later I 
About three and a half 
months later, however, Mr. Broe, 
took a different position with 
his proposal to the company 
that steps be taken to create 
such adverse economic condi-
tions in Chile that Dr. Allende 
might be defeated. 
What took place between the 
Geneen-Broe conversation in 
July and Mr. Broe's conversa-
tion with Edward J. Gerrity, 
senior vice president of I.T.T., 
was not made completely clear 
by the transcript. 
A major charge was that the 
first phase of the Chilean elec-
tion had occurred by the time 
of the meeting with Mr. Ger-
rity, Dr. Allende in the popular 
vote on Sept. 4, 1973, had won 
a plurality but not a majority 
of the popular vote and the 
final decision lay with the 
Chilean Congress?which elect-
ed Dr. Allende President on 
Oct. 24. 
The transcript of the testi-
mony line does not show 
whether it was the increasing 
likelihood that Dr. Allende 
would be elected that had 
changed the apparent position 
of the C.I.A. or whether other 
forces had been at work. Inter-
national Telephone and Tele-
graph Corporation officials had, 
in the meantime, been talking 
to the State Department and 
President Nixon's adviser on 
national security, Henry A. Kis-
singer. Properties belonging to 
I.T.T. were seized after Dr. 
Allende took office in Novem-
er, 1970.

rectly approached officials of 
United States banks, suggesting 
that they cut off credit to 
Chilean businesses and citizens, 
Mr. Broe said that "the only 
company that I had anything 
to do with in regard to Chile 
was I.T.T." 
Officials of the First National 
City Bank, the Chase Manhat-
tan Bank and Manufacturers 
Hanover Trust, all in New York 
City, all denied discussing any 
cutoff of credit with either 
C.I.A. or I.T.T. personnel. 
All said, however, that they 
had been approached by Chil-
ean politicians for financial 
help in the presidential cam-
Suggestions Were Rejected paign. 
According to internal I.T.T. Mr. Broe's testimony left 
u 
memorandums that were read unanswered the question of 
whether anyone in a higher 
position than Mr. Helms, the 
Director of Central Intelligence 
at the time, had known of Mr. 
Broe's proposals to Mr. Gerrity 
that the International Tele-
phone and Telegraph Corpora-
tion and other American com-
panies in Chile attempt to cre-
ate economic instability there. 
He was not asked the ques-
tion and subcommittee sources 
said that the reason was that 
the subcommittee had agreed 
in advance to limit its ques-
tions to the subject of Mr. 
Broe's contacts with I.T.T. of-
ficials. 
Since rgeulations covering 
the operations of the Central 
Intelligence Agency are not 
made public, it is not clear 
whether even Mr. Broe's ap-
proach to Mr. Gerrity should 
have been cleared by the so-
called 40 Committee, an inter-
agency body with members 
from the State and Defense 
into the subcommittee's record 
last week, Mr. Genee rejected 
Mr. Broe's suggestions because 
he felt they would not work, 
Mr. Broe also testified, in 
contradiction to the contents of 
other I.T.T. documents, that the 
purpose of attempting to create 
instability was not to encour-
age a take-over by the Chilean 
military. 
Nor, he said, had the C.I.A. 
made any approaches to the 
Chilean military, contrary to 
what appeared to have been re-
ported in a memorandum from, 
William R. Merriam, the head 
of I.T.T.'s Washington office. 
The questions and answers 
on this point were as follows: 
Senator Church: Did you ad-
vise Mr. Merriam that ap-
proaches continue to be made 
to select members of the armed 
forces in an attempt to have 
them lead some sort of uprising? 
Mr. Broe: No. On a number 
of occasions Mr. Merriam ques-
tioned me regarding possible Departments, 'the C.I.A. and 
action by the military, as this the National Security Council.

Were also open to Mr. McCone, 
board chairman Harold S. Geneen and 
lesser company officials. 
To Senator Charles H. Percy, Re-
publican of Illinois, a member of the 
subcommittee and a former corpora-
, tion executive, this seemed only right. 
The Government, he suggested at the 
hearings, ought to listen to the prob-
lems and proposals of big American-
owned companies. Mr. Percy earried 
, that line of reasoning even further: 
Perhaps it is also right that the Gov-
ernment and companies like I.T.T. 
swap intelligence. Reports on political 
developments from I.T.T. personnel in 
Chile were apparently valuable to the 
C.I.A.; the agency regularly sent a 
messenger to the company's Washing-
ton offices to pick up the reports as 
soon as they arrived. 
Others who took a more critical 
view of last week's disclosures, how-
ever, emphasized that the relationship 
between I.T.T. and the Government 
seems to have gone beyond consulta-
tion and exchange of information. 
Testimony disclosed, for instance, 
that in 1970 the company offered, 
both to the C.I.A. 'and to Mr. Kissinger, 
a kitty of $1-million?possibly more, 
if necessary?to help finance any plan 
the Government devised that would be 
aimed at preventing Mr. Allende's elec-
tion. 
There are discrepancies in the testi-
mony as to how the money was to 
be used. Mr. McCone, while admitting 
that the objective was to help finance 
"any Government program for the 
purpose of bringing about a coalition 
in opposition to Allende," insisted that 
nothing "covert's was intended. Other 
evidence, however, hinted at darker 
plans, including a proposal for stirring 
up enough violence in Chile to justify 
a takeover by the Chilean military. 
Mr. McCone and the other I.T.T. 
officials who testified last week had 
? one broad defense: Nothing actually 
happened; the Government never de-
vised any plan for using Mr. Geneen's 
proffered $1-million and all the other 
schemes hatched by lower-level I.T.T. 
I.T.T. & C.I:A. 
A Little 
Plot for 
Chile? 
? WASHINGTON?When Salvador Al-
lende Gossens was elected President 
of Chile in 1970 on a Marxist program, 
the Nixon Administration appeared to 
accept the need for calm if hard-
headed adjustment to a regrettable 
?deVelopment. It was not long, how-
ever, before charges began to fly in 
Santiago of behind-the-scenes American 
pressure to undermine the Allende 
regime. A question arose: Was the 
power of the United States Govern-
ment and United States corporations 
being wielded covertly in a modern 
version of the old policies of "dollar 
diplomacy" and the "big stick"? 
fight on that question is now being 
thrown in hearings before a special 
subcommittee of the Senate. Foreign 
Relations Committee that opened last 
week. Already, as a result of testimony 
thus far, certain things seem clear: 
The United States Ambassador to 
Chile wanted intervention; so did at 
least one high-ranking official of the 
Central Intelligence Agency; and both 
consulted on that option with the 
? International Telephone and Telegraph 
Corporation (I.T.T.). 
The subcommittee, headed by Sen-
ator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho, 
would like to find out if United States 
policy toward Chile was influenced 
Improperly in 1970 and 1971 by pres-
sure on the part of I.T.T., which owned 
a majority interest in Chile's telephone 
company and had other business in-
terests in the country. 
I.T.T. is one of the 10 largest Amer-
lean corporations. It operates in scores 
' of countries around the globe?a "mul-
tinational company," in today's lex-
icon. The Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee is concerned about the ac-
tivities of all the "multinationals," and 
its hearings on I.T.T. represent only 
the first phase of a study of these 
companies and their possible influence 
on governmental policy, a study that 
will stretch over several years. 
The testimony thus far shows that 
one I.T.T. director, John A. McCone, 
a former head of the C.I.A. and still a 
consultant to that agency, was able to 
get an appointment with his successor, 
Richard Helms, to discuss I.T.T.'s fears 
that the Allende Government would 
expropriate its Chilean properties with-
out adequate compe_nsation. Other 
governmeRffreatemileflensey2001/0 
Kissinger's door at the White House--e 
or C.I.A. Officials were rejected at the 
top. But documents placed in the hear-
ing record seemed to indicate that cer. 
taM overt actions were, in fact, taken 
without recorded top-level approval. 
For example, according to one docu-
ment, William R. Merriam, head of 
I.T.T.'s Washington office, wrote a 
memo to Mr. McCone three weeks be-
fore Mr. Allende's final election saying 
that William Broe, head of the C.I.A.'s 
clandestine activities in Latin America, 
had told him that "approaches continue 
to be made to select members of .the 
[Chilean] armed forces in an attempt 
to have them lead some sort of up-
rising?no success to date." The same 
Mr. Broe, who was I.T.T.'s regular con-
tact with the C.I.A., was quoted as 
reporting later on the C.I.A.'s attempts 
to get United States banks to suspend 
lending operations in Chile, thus creat-
ing economic problems that could bring 
down the Allende Government.

Rogers is not expected to 
respond to the invitation of the 
subcommittee, headed by 
Chairman Frank Church, 
D-Idaho. The State Depart-
ment has indicated that a Lat-
in American specialist would 
be sent to testify in Rogers' 
place. 
The subcommittee said it 
would be premature to say 
now whether it will seek sub-
poenas to challenge the gov-
ernment on the executive priv-
ilege issue. 
The subcommittee also 
wants to hear testimony from 
Ambassador to Costa Rica Vi-
ron P. Vaky, former National 
Security Council aide Arnold 
Naehmanoff and William V. 
.Broe, former chief of the 
CIA's Latin American divi-
sion. So far, the subcommittee 
has contented itself with "in-
viting" these individuals to 
testify. 
Vaky was Latin adviser to 
Dr. Henry A.MilitccAlmrillgr Re 
the Clulean drriYeYiddi o`ti NOWS 
which the investigation focus-
es; and Nachmance, no longer 
in government, was his sue- - 
cessor. Neither has responded 
yet to the subcommittee invi-
tation 
Broe's testimony is in a dif-
ferent category because of a 
federal law cloaking the CIA 
with secrecy. Broe and his for-
mer boss, Ambassador Rich-, 
ard Helms, already have 
talked to the subcommittee in 
executive session. 
It is understood that the CIA 
would like to get 13roe's ver-
sion of the agency's role in the 
Chilean affair on the record in 
some form, but does not wish 
to set a precedent for the pub-
lic appearance of one of its 
officials. 
Informed sources say Broe's 
testimony would confirm that 
there were discussions be-
tween him and officials of ITT 
about the situation in Chile, 
but would deny that the CIA 
was running any operation to 
stop Allende's election or to 
induce economic chaos in the 
Marxist dominated regime. 
Some officials were reported 
considering a plan by which 
the subcommittee could read 
into the record a question and 
answer transcript of testimony 
from Broe without the CIA of-
ficial actually appearing at 
public hearings. 
These questions, it was said, 
would cover the discrepancy 
in testimony heard so far from 
ITT officials about whether it 
was ITT or the CIA which was 
making proposals to bar Al-
lende's election or to prevent 
his nationalization of ITT 
property in Chile. 
There also has been a dis-
crepancy in testimony from 
former CIA chief John Mc-
Cane and yrr senior vice pres-
ident Edward Gerrity about 
ses ro lem 
a el n Chile 
the purposes ITT had in mind 
for a fund of $1 million it of-
fered to the CIA for use in 
Chile. 
McCone testified he set up a 
meeting, as an ITT director, 
between Broe and ITT presi-
dent Harold S. Geneen to dis-
cuss ' means of stopping Al-
lende from taking power. But 
Gerrity said the purpose of the 
fund was to spend it on hous-
ing and agricultural projects 
as a means of softening Al-
lende's attitude toward the 
U.S. corporation. 
Geneen is scheduled to testi-
fy this week, along with for-
mer Ambassador to Chile Ed-
ward Korry and officials of 
other companies functioning in 
Chile.

Harold Geneen. president of International, Telephone & Telegraph Corp.. met in 
July. 1970. in a Washington hotel with the U.S. government's chief agent for Latin 
American subversion and espionage. at a time when ITT was said to be trying to 
block the election of Salvador Allende as President of Chile. a Senate subcommittee 
was told yesterday. 
This testimony was given by 
William Merriam, ITT vice-pres-
ident. shortly after a House 
subcommittee made public docu-
ments implicating Vice-Presi-
dent Spiro T. Agnew and five 
other top Nixon administration 
officials in pressuring the Jus-
tice Department to settle its 
anti-trust suits against ITT. 
Merriam also said in his testi-
mony that Geneen might have 
discussed ITT's attempts to de-
rail Allende in a series of Aug-
ust, 1970. meetings with high Nix-
on administration officials, in-
cluding former Attorney-General 
John Mitchell. 
Meeting described 
According to Merriam, on July 
26. 1970. Geneen met in the Sher-
eton Carlton Hotel in Washing-
ton with William V. Broe. chief 
of Clandestine Services, West-
ern Hemisphere, Directorate of 
Plans,? of the U.S. Central Intel-
ligence Agency. 
Merriam said he did not know 
who arranged the meeting, but 
when he escorted Geneen to the 
hotel, Geneen introduced him to 
Broe and told him Broe was 
HS/IIC-f4fp 
"the head of the Latin American 
division" of the CIA. Merriam 
said he left Geneen and Broe 
and waited in the hotel lobby; 
Geneen returned 25 minutes lat-
er and ordered him to -keep in 
touch" with Broe. 
Before yesterday's session, 
Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho, 
chairman of the Senate subcom-
mittee, said it would "seek to 
ascertain whether ITT and the 
CIA cooperated in an effort to 
prevent Allende from being 
elected President of Chile in 
1970." 
Subcommittee sources said yes-
terday that they had "sheafs" 
of documents on ITT-CIA col-
laboration to foment civil strife 
and insurrection against Allende, 
who was elected in September, 
1970. 
More revelations due 
More revelations are expected 
next week when John J. McCone 
is scheduled to testify. McCone, 
former director of the CIA, is 
now a director of ITT. 
Subcommittee sources also said 
that in addition to the ITT-CIA 
eonspiracy against Chit(, the 
subcommittee will take up the 
Justice Department's sudden 1971 
decision to drop anti-trust suits 
against ITT, 10 days after ITT's 
Sheraton Hotels division offered 
$400,000 to help finance the Re-
publican Party national conven-
tion. The probe will also try to 
find out whether this may have 
influenced the Nixon administra-
tion and the CIA in any action 
against Chile. 
A House subcommittee Monday 
released data prepared by the 
Securities and Exchange Com-
mission (SEC) which implicates, 
in the ITT-Justice Department 
"settlement" of the anti-trust 
actions, not only Agnew and 
Mitchell but also former Com-
merce Secretary Maurice Stans, 
former Treasury Secretary -John 
Connally, Nixon aide John Ehr-
Hellman, special Nixon aide Pe-
ter Peterson, a former Commerce 
Secretary, and Charles Colson, 
former special legal counsel to 
Nixon. 
Allende and the Popular Unity 
government in Chile have repeat-
edly charged ITT and the CIA 
with organized subversion.

was a CIA spy when he was shot down over China in 
1952,. although at that time the CIA and the Admin-

The Central Intelligence ing story. He was one of the 
Agency's new station chief in 
London is Cord Meyer, hither-
to the agency's assistant de-
puty director of plans in Wash-
ington. ? 
The planning department of 
the CIA is responsible for 
espionage and clandestine op-
erations. Detractors of the 
CIA call it the "Department 
of Dirty Tricks." 
, Meyer was in line for pro-
motion to be deputy director 
of plans?"DDP," the nearest 
CIA equivalent' of ? James 
Bond's "M." 
Instead, according to CIA 
watchers here, he Is being pro 
meted to the U.S. embassy in 
London. They regard this as a 
"kick upstairs." 
. In 1967, it was revealed that 
Meyer was in charge of cov-
ertly funding Encounter mag-
azine and other organizations. 
Last summer, he became the 
object of further notoriety 
when he asked the New York 
publisher Harper and Row to 
show the CIA proofs of a book 
since published, called "The 
Politics of Heroin in South-
east Asia." The book linked 
the CIA with the drug traffic 
in that area. 
Meyer later denied that it 
had been his intention to sup-
press the book. 
Few details are known 
about the nature or extent of 
CIA operatiens in England. 
Sources here say that there is 
a large base for covert action 
in premises within alew min-
utes walk from the U.S. em-
bassy in Grosvenor Square. 
This is the ? headquarters for 
covert action in western and 
eastern Europe and the Medi-
terranean. It was moved 
from Paris to London at the 
time of Gen. Charles De 
Gaulle's quarrel with NATO 
and the United States. 
The CIA works closely with 
British intelligence and claims 
not to engage in clandestine 
activities in Britain.

most brilliant men a his year 
at Yale University in the early 
1940's. He lost an eye in a Ma-
rine landing in the Pacific war 
and wrote a short story about 
the experience called "Waves 
of Darkness." After the war, 
he became a passionate advo-
cate of world government and 
wrote a book on this subject. 
He was a hero to the student 
generation of the late 1940's. 
He joined the CIA in 1953 at 
the urging of Alan Dulles. At 
that time, the Agency was a 
respectable haven for liberal 
intellectuals. During, the Mc-
Carthy era he was investi-
gated for alleged Communist 
associations but was cleared. 
In Fact, he had never been a 
Communist sympathizer. He 
soon became as ardent for the 
Cold War as he had been for 
the United World Federalist 
movement. 
Meyer's assignment to Lon-
don is seen by CIA watchers 
as a part of the purge which 
the agency is experiencing un-
der its new director, James 
Schlesinger. Reports in Wash-
ington this week say that the 
CIA's 18,000 personnel is to 
be cut by 10' percent by June 
30. Schlesinger, a business-
man with no intelligence back-
