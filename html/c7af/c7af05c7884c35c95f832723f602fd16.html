 ~'NtE~fSURES -TO STRENdTHEN SOVIET MILITIA ADOPTED
 _  The CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers have recen  y
 reviewed the question of steps to further strengthen the Soviet Militia.  A resolution
 adopted on this question notes that in recent years important steps have been taken
 by the party and government to strengthen the struggle against crime, to increase
 the publics role in this matter, and to improve the activity of the militia, prose-
 cutors~ offices, and the courts.  The implementation of these measures has strengthened
 .legal procedures in many cities and regions.  At the same time the interests of build-
 in&.communism require Further attention by party, soviet, public organizations and
 administrative organs to questions concerned with reinforcing public order.
 The organs of the Soviet Militia plap an important role in maintaining law and order'
 'and legality and protecting the interests of the socialist state, creative labor,
 and the legal right~~ 7P,3oviet citizens against criminalf infringements.. The
 ,honorable and nable~~2~a'~or. bf  the Soviet Militia is highly regaz+ded  in socialist
 society; its activities affect many peoples interests, and they occur in constant
 .dealings with the population.  For all their strictness and decisiveness, the
 militias actions must always be dust and understood by the broad working masses.
 Militia workers have an obligation to strengthen and expand their ties with public
 organizations and workers collectives and to rely on their help in forestalling
 any violation of public order.  The resolution draws attention to the necessity for
 .eliminating shortcomings that occur in the militias work and provides for concrete
 measures aimed at the creation of militia organs having the proper conditions for
 .successful fulfillment of their responsible tasks.
 The union republic Communist Party central committees. party kraykoms and obkams,
 -the union republic councils of ministers, and kray and Oblast ispolkoms of the
 soviets of working, peoples deputies have been ordered to strengthen their control
 over militia organs and urgently increase their role in implementing party and
 :government decisions concerned with strengthening the struggle against crime.
 Whi1? increasing their control over the militia, party and soviet organs should
 -.also display constant concern for strengthening the militias authority.
 In the interests of further strengthening the cadres of the militia organs and
 expanding ties between the militia and the people, provision is made for recruiting
 into militia work the best workers and trained and competent people who are capable,
 through their political and business qualities, of successfully fulfilling the tasks
 of the militia organs.  A procedure will be established for recruitment into city
 'and regional militia organs, as a rule ,on recommendation of workers collectives
 'through discussion of those recommended at meetings of party, trade union and,
 Komsomol organizations.  The militia organs are obliged to inform the publfe in
 enterprises, establishments, and organizations of the wark'done in the militia by
 those whom these groups have recommended.
 It has been deemed necessary to widen the practice of speeches by militia workers
 -among the population, and to consult directly with citizens at enterprises,
 establishments, and homes on questions of interest to them.  The militia organs
 should strengthen their ties with the voluntary peoples squads and more widely
 recruit, on a public voluntary basis at militia organs and through consultation
 with citizens, those persons who are qualified lawyers, teachers, journalists
 -and representatives of public organizations.
 Tlie local soviets and their ispolkoms have been ordered to improve their control over
 the work of militia organs, systematically to review their activities at soviet,session
 -and ispolkom meetings, and to help militia organs complete economic, cultural. and
 everyday tasks.  It is planned  to increase the. role of permanent commissions of local
 soviets in effect ingcontrol and rendering assistance to militia organs in order to
 strengthen their ties with workers collectives and improve organizational work to  ,
 ~(~~r~~~1TFor Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400020023-2
 forestall violations of the law.  A procedure has been established by which the
 militiamen authorized for any particular sector are confirmed by ispolkoms of city a;;d
 rayon soviets.
 It is recommended that editorial offices of newspapers and magazines, radio, television
 and publishing houses give comprehensive coverage to the responsible and Honorable
 work of the militia and ~.ts inseparable ties with the people, so as to help strengthen
 i:n every way the militiaF,s authority among the workers.
 Because the title USSR Ministry for the Preservation of Pablic Order and its local
 organs does not reflect all the functions which they fulfill within the system of
 .Soviet Government organs, it has been deemed necessary to rename this ministry tiie
 !USSR Ministry of .Internal Affairs.  The ministries for the preservation of public
 ;order 1n union and autonomous republigs are. being renamed union and, autonomous republic
 .ministries of internal affairs, and the administrations of the lcray or oblispollcoms
 ifor the preservation,o~~pub'lic-order as administrations of the kray or oblispolkoms
 for internal affairs r~~;~~ :.~                            -       ,       ,
 Tl;e USSR 1inistry of Internal Affairs and its organs have the tusk of further impr~~??~?
 their .work on the basis of very strict observance of socialist legality.  Exemplar}?
 fulfillment of service duty, high discipline and culture in work, and in a deep
 understanding by every worker of his ~?ole in the cause of educating the Soviet people
 in a spirit of conscious observance of the laws and rules of socialist society are
 ;demanded of the personnel of the USSR MVD.
 Tl;c attention of the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs, union republic Communist Party
 .central committees, and the party~s kraykoms, oblcoms, gorlcoms, and.raykoms is drawn *,o
 the necessity for strengthening political-educational work among militia personnel.
 It is envisaged that there will be improvement in the teaching and training of special.
 for the militia organs.  The resolution specifies numerous steps concerned with
 equipping the militia with technical means and improving the materia] -~^nvision for
 'militla workers and other organs of the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs.
 The CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of 1?linisters have expressed their
 conviction that party, soviet, trade union, and Komsomol organizations and the USSR
 linistry of Internal Affairs and its local organs will significantly strengthen public
 order in our country by implementing the outlined measures.

 IS COMMUNIST CHINA A MAJOR
 WORLD ECONOMIC POWER?
 1.  Since-the Communists overran the China mainland in 19+9, economists
 in the outside world have wrangled over what Chairman MA0 Tse-tang and his
 revolutionary army would be able to do about the backward economy they had
 so abruptly inherited.  Opinions and estimates on the problem have been for-
 mulated with precious little to go on:  long-range guessing from Hong Kong
 with the help of travelers' tales, heavily censored reports from a few
 foreign correspondents, callings from Chinese newspapers and periodicals,
 and letter and broadcast intercepts.  Scattered statistics have been avail-
 able, since many of China's commercial partners have issued regular trade
 figures.  China herself has published no comprehensive statistics on the
 Chinese economy since 1959?  Understandably, then, the estimates on the
 state of China's economy have varied widely, from claims that China is too
 weak and disordered to feed, clothe and house her own burgeoning population,
 to alarmist forecasts that Peking will soon create economic havoc in Asia
 with price-cutting and dumping on world markets.                25X1 C10b

 IS COMMUNIST CHINA A MAJOR
 I                                          WORLD ECONOMIC POWER?
 The actual strength of Communist China as a world economic-force has
 always been difficult to assess.  The difficulty s.rises in-.part from dis-
 tracting psychological factors, such as the world's long-nourished appre-
 hensions about the "yellow peril," the awesome facts of China's skyrock-
 eting population, the truculence of her foreign .policy., and the intriguing
 possibility that one of the hare-brained schemes, such as the back yard
 iron smelters, might actually work.
 It is impossible to use traditional yardsticks in measuring and
 assessing this most truly inaccessible area of the globe. .Certain sta-
 tistics are available, although these must be laboriously gathered as
 Communist China has not published comprehensive data on her economy for
 more than a decade, nor virtually any statistics at all since the begin-
 ning of the Cultural Revolution.  In the past, China watchers have had the
 tales of foreign travelers and newsmen visiting China -- but they are now
 largely banned.  China experts have had China's newspapers and periodi-
 cals to scan -- but these are now almost totally unavailable to foreign
 subscribers.  Still available is the NCNA (1Vew China News Agency), but
 it continues to offer a diet of polemics in .lieu of facts.  Moreover
 China's few allies are probably no better informed, and certainly are
 little more forthcoming, than she about her internal business.
 However, before the recent clamp-down on visitors, subscriptions,
 and foreign correspondents,  Far East scholars and economists were able
 to piece together a reasonably comprehensive picture of China's ,economy.
 Their consensus is -- ignoring for the moment her long-range potential
 -- that today China is more a poorhouse than a world economic power.
 They base their judgment on the following.
 Industrial Production
 Industrial development in China has been a start-and-stop operation,
 hamstrung from the beginning by political considerations and irrationali-
 ties.  Some gains have been made, but they are relatively small and have
 been achieved at the expense of other sectors of the economy.  And even
 now, 19 years after taking power, the basic products are at a minimal
 level.  Take, for example, steel output, which the experts estimate at
 around 12 million tons annually.  This is roughly a fifth of that of
 Japan, which has only a fraction of the area and population of China.
 Take oil:  new fields have been tapped in the Northwest and China is
 believed to have arrived at a degree of self-sufficiency in petroleum.
 But what are China's needs?  Very modest, indeed, in comparison with
 her  neighbors in the Far East, whose yearly consumption requirements
 per capita are 88-100 liters compared to China's 16-20 liters.  This
 can be compared with Japan at 520 liters, the USSR at 800 liters and
 t:he U.S. at 3600 liters per capita.

 Wl~.atever the industry, (:hina has borrowed her technology almost en-
 tirely from abroad, often in the form of whole plants, but this appears
 to have accomplished little :Por China's economy or China's "modern man."
 Total annual output is so low that Peking refuses to publish statistics.
 Per capita income, which China also refuses to divulge, has been estimated by
 ttie World Bank a~ $95 for 1966 -- well below that of such countries as Thai-
 land, Cambodia and Ceylon.  :Cn contrast, Nationalist China's per capita
 income for 1966 was $189 (and $209 for 1967).
 China's transportation :i.s in a fearful state by modern standards.
 And the difficulties inherent in the primitive nature of the system, in
 which most goods and people -still move by foot, cart and canal, have been
 compounded by the Cultural Revolution.  Red Guards, disgruntled workers,
 and peasants have committed frequent acts of idle mischief and actual
 sabotage against the relatively few rail lines which exist, causing break-
 downs, blockages of shipments and, in some instances, complete disruption
 of an already erratic service.  Other inhibiting factors in China's rail
 transportation are oboslete rolling stock, reliance on steam engines
 rather than Diesels, too few miles of double track for the rolling stock
 that does exist, and the fact that no new lines have been laid for 10
 years.  (China, of course, has been very busy laying tracks -- or pro-
 posing to -- in other countries, such as Laos, North Vietnam, and
 Tanzania.)
 China's enormous labor force has presented many problems for the
 Communist regime since the birth of the Cultural Revolution.  Factional
 struggles have occurred regularly in factories.  Regime-inspired wage
 restrictions, bans on distribution of collectively-owned funds, and can-
 cellations of year-end bonuses have resulted in reactions ranging from
 outspoken dissatisfaction to fighting on factory grounds, destruction of
 m.a:chinery and, ultimately, prolonged strikes which badly crippled the
 plants where they occurred.  In Apr:i_1 1968, some strikers in Canton not
 only refused to obey the orders of the Canton Revolutionary Committee to
 end their strike, but attacked those who were willing to go back to work.
 The foregoing is only the top of the iceberg, so to speak, but ex-
 perts conclude that what they can observe about the industrial sector of
 the economy must reflect in large degree that part they cannot see.  One
 aspect of the economy which can more readily be seen is foreign trade,
 which has been seriously affected by disorders in China's industry.
 Foreign Trade
 China's foreign trade was suffering from chromic ailments even
 before the onset of the Cultural Revolution.  As a result directly
 traceable to the Cultural Revolution, China's foreign trade will decline
 i.n 1968 for the second straight year and may (according to preliminary
 grade figures) even decline more than the eight percent drop registered
 in 1967.  China has been attempting to improve her trade balance by

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400020023-2
 cutting back imports. from the free world and boosting exports appreciably.
 This should reduce her Western trade deficit, which totalled $80 million
 last year.  But the deed is easier in theory than in actuality.  One of
 the major marketplaces for western purchases of Chinese goods. is the Canton
 'T'rade Fair, but the volume of trade at the Autumn Fair (15 October-15 November
 1868) declined approximately 20 percent below last year's level.  Although
 the fair was well attended, a number of buyers left without placing orders
 because prices were "unrealistic," because one-third of the orders x~laced
 at the Canton Spring Trade Fair (May 1968) had not yet been filled, and
 because many of the boasted "30,000 different items on show" proved to be
 just that, and not for export at all.
 Communist customers also attend China's trade fairs and they do not
 appear to enjoy. any discriminatory advantages over their non-Communist
 competitors.  All have equal difficulties with currency exchange; all
 are equally subject to propaganda broadsides on the joys of MAO-style
 Communism; and all suffer delays in shipment and risk breakage or loss.
 In fact, the official People's Insurance Company of China has just an-
 nounced to all its customers its intention to renege on its commitments
 to insure risks of "Strikes, Riots, and Civil Commotion."  Since China
 demands that all nations doing business with her carry insurance with
 the People's Insurance Company of China, this, in effect, means that all
 buyers wanting much-needed insurance against strikes, riots and civil
 disorders will find it necessary to carry two insurance policies to
 protect the same merchandise.
 The overall volume of China's trade with 18 of. her non-Communist
 trading partners fell by 17.8 percent in the first six months of 1968.
 According to the Japan External Trade Organization, which assembled the
 trade figures, Chinese exports fell by 13.5 percent and imports by 22.1
 during that period.  China's trade with Communist countries has also
 suffered reverses, most dramatic of which has- been the drop in trade
 with the USSR.  According to the UN monthly bulletin of statistics for
 July 1968, Soviet imports from China declined from 129 million rubles'
 worth in 1966 to 51 million in 1967, while Chinese imports from the
 USSR fell from 158 million rubles in 1966 to 45 million in 1967.  Sino-
 Soviet trade, then, has fallen to five percent of its peak level in 1959?
 According to TASS, among the factors contributing to the trade decline have
 been -the detention of Soviet vessels in Chinese ports (the Zagorsk in
 December 1966, the Svirsk in August 1967, and the Komsomolets Ukrainy in
 March 1968) and the harassment of Soviet trade officials by Red Guards in
 1967.  China's trade with Eastern Europe will also be below last year's
 level, in part because of disruptions in trade as a result of the Czecho-
 slovak crisis.  China's reported cutback in aid to Hanoi, which has been
 viewed as an ideological reproof  to Hanoi for going to the Paris peace
 talks, may have been as much a matter of necessity as of ideology.

 Agricultural Production
 Experts find it more difficult to ascertain facts about China's ag-
 riculture in assessing the overall economic picture in this rigidly closed
 e.nd badly disorganized society.  Eight out of 10 Chinese live in farm
 villages which are spread oL~t over China's sprawling land mass.  The re-
 g;ime's attempt to keep these remote farm areas in line has been particu-
 l.az?ly difficult following th.e concessions made to the peasants in the re-
 cession following the disaster of the Greap Leap Forward experiment.  It
 requires little imagination to picture the reaction of a man accustomed
 to breeding his own fish in his own pond, or growing and marketing his
 own crops, or raising his own livestock when these "'privileges" are sud-
 denly withdrawn.  Little wor..der that the peasant farmer has claimed in-
 ability to meet the state-determined quota systems for grain and live-
 "tock; little wonder, too, a,t his lack of enthusiasm for participation
 i.n collective farm chores.
 Add to this very personal equation, the chronic material shortcom-
 ings of Chinese Communist-style agriculture, which have been sharpened
 by the Cultural Revolution:  fertilizer and pesticide shortages intensi-
 fied by breakdowns in delivery systems; replacement of archaic farm im-
 x~lements postponed by industrial strikes; food shortages in the communes
 e,harpened by the arrival of unwilling and unseasoned city dwellers (stu-
 dents, intellectuals, administrative personnel) sent by the regime to
 offer unwanted assistance ir. the harvest.  Other relevant factors include
 the disintegration of the rural bureaucracy which shed or lost its respon-
 ti;ibilities in the past two years; the basic  Chinese reluctance to divert
 e,carce funds to costly, large-sca.-L~-: land reclamation projects and to
 adapt the land management methods which have proved effective in the free
 world; and, finally, the calamitous weather the past two growing seasons
 i.n China -- torrential rains and flooding in southern China, drought in
 the wheat-growing regions north of the Yangtse River, and frost in the
 northernmost rice-growing areas.  The foregoing combination -- even as a
 .Long-distance view over China's wall -- is sufficiently discouraging to
 make the experts extremely c_ubious about glowing Chinese Communist claims
 of "bumper crops in 1968."
 Other Problems Connected with the Growth of China's Econom
 There are other problems -- some of which affect the growth of the
 economy and others of which are caused by its :shortcomings -- that indi-
 cate the economy is in difficulty.  Some of these problems find their roots
 i.n the Cultural Revolution, others are chronic and have merely been inten-
 ~;ified by the Cultural Revolution.  Food has always been in short supply
 i.n Communist China; as a result of the Cultural Revolution it has been
 x~articularly scarce.  Before travelers were virtually forbidden to enter
 China, they had reported such incidents as:  famine in :sections of
 Kwangtung Province; peasants looting foodstores; 500 hungary peasants
 stopping a freight train (on the way to liankow) to seize large quantities

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400020023-2
 of food grain; hungry farmers rioting against shipments of rice out of
 China; and posters prepared by city dwellers accusing the regime of
 starving the Chinese people.  Also reported were shortages of matches,
 fish, peanut oil, meat, cotton cloth, medicine, soap, cigarettes, kero-
 sene, and fuel, particularly coal.  Bus service and telegraph and postal
 service are reportedly erratic.  The black market is flourishing and
 farmers are accused of falsifying commune production reports and secretly
 distributing grain instead of turning it over to .the state.
 Population Growth
 China faces at least one economic problem that has little to do with
 the Cultural Revolution, that of an awesome population growth.  Marxian
 principles claim that people (labor power) are the basic source of a na-
 tion's wealth; therefore, there cannot be too many people but only ex-
 ploitative economic systems which create the impression of overpopulation.
 China's leaders have vacillated in their interpretation of Marx on popu-
 lation growth, depending on the state of China's economy.  However,
 is no question treat China has too many people when she is no longer able
 to grow enough food to support the population and when her trade is
 reaching a serious imbalance as she attempts to impart enough food to
 feed her hungry 750 million.  When China's masters return to all-out sup-
 port for the widespread practice of birth control -- as it is generally
 predicted they will be forced to do -- China will have proved once more
 abstract ideology is a poor guide towards a successful economy.
 To return to the initial. question -- is Communist China a major world
 economic power, or is it a poorhouse? -- for the immediate future, and
 viewing the disasters of the Cultural Revolution, the burgeon:i.ng popula-
 tion, tYie sparse agricultural reserves, the disrupted and generally ar-
 chaic state of most of her transportation and industry and her unfavorable
 trade balances, the conclusion is inescapable that the economic experts
 are probably correct:  the Communist Chinese giant is closer to being a
 poorhouse than a world power.

 (i7NCLASSIFIED)                                              September 1968
 Following are examples of conflicting reports on Chinese Communist
 harvest prospects for 1968.  Local provincial authorities issue their
 on-the-scene view of local situations while Peking Radio and the New China
 News Agency (NCNA) view  the provincial picture through their long-range
 rose-colored binoculars:
 Anhwei
 NCNA on June 22 claimed that grain collection in the province exceeded
 the figure at the same date in 1967 by 55.6.  Hopei Radio broadcast an
 urgent call on 23 July, by which time the north of the province was badly
 flooded, to tackle the Huai River floods which were hitting transport and
 threatening the summer harvest.
 Nevertheless NCNA reported on August 19-that a "bumper early rice
 crop" had just been harvested in South Anhwei - one of the main early rice
 growing areas of China.
 Honan
 NCNA on June 21 reported the wheat crop to be "quite good."  Cheng-
 chow Radio issued a series of directives between July ~+-9 on combating
 drought conditions..  On July 17 it reported heavy rain in the Hsinyang
 district of Honan which had necessitated conferences to institute mea-
 sures to deal with floods in that part of Honan.
 Hopei
 Wheat production was reported to be "quite good" by NCNA on 21 June,
 although Tientsin Radio had broadcast on 12 June an urgent appeal for
 increased efforts at manuring the fields to speed growth - almost cer-
 tainly a sign that drought had so far delayed it.  Peking Radio on
 July 6, reported heavy rainfall starting July 5 was causing flooding.
 Hunan
 An NCNA report on June 21, 1968 of "rich harvests" contrasted with a
 Changsha Radio report of June 19 of rain all over the province with ris-
 ing rivers and more rain expected.  However, Peking Radio, August 18,
 spoke of a "good" harvest in Hunan.
 Hupeh
 On June 12 Peking Home Service reported a "bumper harvest" of sum-
 mer crops, including wheat but not rice, with uniformly high yields.
 However, the rice crop being affected by the floods was mentioned fre-
 quently in Wuhan broadcasts from-July 9 to 30.
 Kiangsi
 Floods affected some areas but early rice`was generally said to be
 growing well in July (Nanchang Radio, July 9) and a "bumper"harvest was
 expected.  On July 23, however, Nanchang reported that "barring

 extraordinary calamities there 'was certain to be a 'rich' harvest."  An
 NCNA round-up of August 19 claimed that Kiangsi had reaped "a bumper early
 rice crop."
 Kirin
 Kirin had suffered a drought "seldom equalled in the past" (Chang-
 chun Radio, August 7) and no harvest claims have been noted.
 Kwan~s i
 Reports of serious floods :in Kwangsi in July were followed by a re-
 port by Kwangsi Radio on August 21, surveying the general economic situa-
 tion in the region, claimed that in the first half of 1868 sabatoage
 plots had been smashed, natural calamities had been overcome-and that cer-
 tain areas had achieved "bumper"' harvests.
 Kwan,~,tun~
 Reports in mid-June of the damage being caused by the "worst floods
 in the history of Kwangtung" were confirmed by Canton Radio but early rice
 was maturing in the Pearl River basin according to NCNA_on July 17 and on
 ~fuly 27.  On August 18 Peking claimed a "good" harvest for the province.
 Liaonin~_
 A Shenyang report on August; 3 on fighting drought and insect pests
 suggested that harvest prospect;? in the province are poor.  NCNA has not
 reported on Liaoning's prospect;>.
 Shansi
 NCNA reported on June 15, a "bumper" harvest of wheat despite serious
 frost earlier in the year.
 Shantung; _
 A "bumper" harvest of wheat; was in sight in mid-June (Nanking Radio
 17 June).  Although Shantung suffered both flood and drought conditions,
 "good" and "rich" wheat harvests were on record in some areas. (Tsian,
 .]"une 18) .
 Yunnan
 Kunming reported on June 22 that all sorts of natural calamities had
 been overcome, and that in ane county a "bumper" harvest of grain had been
 reaped which was 20% better than last year.

 ~~   SPRING FAIR AT CANTON
 ~HF~ SPRING Canton Trade Fair, which ended on May
 z5,fproved a disappointment both to the Chinese and to
 the' foreign businessmen who went there expecting to ,
 negotiate trade deals. It vvas far from being "a testimony to the ;~.
 great victory achieved ire the great proletarian cultural revo-='
 lution", :claimed by Neu China News Agency (NCNA) on May `'
 r ~, r g68.
 Merchants from many foreign cities, including Singa-
 pore, 'T'okyo, Hamburg and Hongkong, read with interest that
 there were " 30,000 different items on show", including "70
 products" never before seen in Canton (NCNA, April ry). But
 -they discovered that display did not necessarily mean "for
 export," as many of the: items were not for sale, including a
 new make of Chinese "mini"-type car (although a very limited
 number o#! Chinese-made washing machines and refrigerators
 were offered for the first time). Foreign enquiries for supplies
 of foodstuffs, some ehem'ical and pharmaceutical products, silk,
 bristles, skins, minerals and ores (such as tungsten, antimony
 and mercury) could not be met.
 Many traders attended to enquire about the faiiure of
 the Chinese to deliver goods ordered at the autumn fair in
 rg67; it was estimated by several different merchants that about
 one third of the orders placed at that fair have yet to be ful-
 filled. Some complained that they are still awaiting the delivery
 of goods ordered a year aga at the rg67 spring fair. In the light
 of this experience, most traders tried to pin down the Chinese
 exporters to firm delivery dates foP"[tfl! goods they were then
 ordering; but their efforts were far from successful. The Chinese
 ~Adrnutted that there would be delivery delays varying from an
 average of four months to as long as nine months. They
 refused to quote any definite dates to buyers of some products,
 including ceramics and rejected all orders for delivery in ig6g
 and after.
 Devaluation of sterling and the threat to the franc during
 the French crisis caused the Chinese to be reluctant to deal in
 sterling, US dollars anti, for a short time, French francs and to
 concentrate instead,on Swiss francs. However, they eventually
 decided to continue to accept dealings in French francs and in
 limited quantities of sterling. But all contracts signed at the
 fair had to include a new clause protecting the Chinese expor-
 ters against further devaluations. The same anxiety was reflec-
 ted in the price increases involving many commodities. Many
 businessmen, who have made successful deals at previous fairs,
 came away this year leaving for the first time failed to do any
 business; they found it uneconomic in the face of price increases
 amounting to as much as 2g per cent for some items, compared
 with prices at the autumn, rg67 fair.
 The volume of trade at the fair declined. The Japanese
 Kyodo News Service, fo~? example, stated on May r 6 that despite
 large Chinese purchases of steel and fertilisers from Japan, the
 total value of Sino Japanese export-import deals at this fair fell
 short of the amounts reached at the two previous fairs in rg67.
 The r g68 deals amounted only to ~8o million as compared with

 Visitors reported that the city was suffering power-cuts

 otels and the fair, that food was scarce, especially rice and
 meat; they also saw that same of the factories and workshops
 - they passed were inactive. Most of the posters which had dis-

 1956-1957), the great leap forward (1958-
 1960), the period of. retrcrichrnent a,nd re-
 building (1961-1965.), and the great proms
 letarian  Cultural  revolution  (1966  to  the
 present) . -Each stage contained a number of
 minor substages; some of them mutually con-
 tradictory.  Each stage also revealed policy
 shifts from right to left and back again de-
 pending on whether emphasis was placed on
 economic calculation. or ideological euiphoria..
 The cultural revolution, for example, shows
 at least seven such swings in the revolutionary
 lx:ndulum.         To some extent,  these move-
 ments are consciously directed by the leaders
 ort the theory of alternating tension and re-
 laxation.  Increasingly, hotvcvcr, the swings.
 .appear to be spontaneous and uncontrollable.
 Like other underdeveloped economies, the
 Chinese  economy  is  not  fully  integrated.
 There is a considerable element of localism
 antl 1o~~al self-suflicicncy in the rnerhanism.
 '.['o sonu~ extent this is a legacy of  the past
 which the Communists have tried to eradi-
 cate.  On the other hand, not a few measures
 taken by the Communists since 1958 have
 tended to encourage local economic auton-
 omy.   1'ltc interesting point about this is that
 it enables the economy to withstand upheav-
 als at the center, to keep on functioning lo-
 cally in sl7ite of confusion at the top.l
 ':Che Chinese economy is "aitlless."  It has
 never received any grants from abroad and
 the last long-term (Soviet) loan was received
 in 1954.  China's external economic contacts
 czre based on cash (mostly hard cash) pay-
 ;aients and short-term credits for the purchase
 abroad of specified items.  Two-thirds of the
 country's trade is presently carried on with
 "capitalist" powers.
 .A.t ]east since 1961, the Chinese economy
 l as not been "Marxist-Leninist" in the Stal-
 inisk sense.  In the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Eu-
 rope the Stalinist economic priorities were-
 and to some extent still are-heavy industry,
 light industry, agriculture:  China's official
 priorities after 1960 have been: agriculture,
 light industry, heavy industry.  This depar-
 tw'e from the orthodox pattern was largely
 dictated by the urgent need to feed and
 ~'17t CVSlttatiing Tt1Z-pCiSVrmai~c.o yr vw~.,.s~-
 cconorny one must c:onstantly bear in mind
 the cultural gap between Western and Chi-
 - nese conceptions of life.  It is difficult enough
 to understand the workings of totalitarian
 systems when one has not been exposed to
 them .directly and for considerable periods.
 It is even more difficult to grasp the elusive
 qualities of a totalitarian system imposed on
 a society whose values are very different from
 'ours, and whose language loses more than the
 usual share of meaning in translation.  There
 is no civil or criminal code in Chiria today;.
 nor are there any codes in other areas of law.
 The whole body of Chinese Communist law
 takes up just 600 pages of rather large print,'
 and most of the "laws" are, in fact, admin-
 istrative decrees, many of them applying ret-
 rospectively.  The General Code of Laws of
 tlw Ch'ing Dynasty made it a criminal of-
 fensc to `?do what you ought not to do."
 The Chinese, moreover, have a capacity for
 'separating the public from the private face,
 so that noisy expressions of obeisance on the
 part of private individuals must at all times
 be viewed not only in the context of a sys-
 tem of fear but in the light of a special ethic
 which existed long before Mao and Marx.
 AGRICULTURE
 At the end of December, 1966, the cultural
 revolution was extended  to economic' life.
 Red Guards and Maoist workers' formations
 ("revolutionary rebels") were ordered to take
 over 'offices,  factories and  farms.  At this
 juncture, the upheaval in the "superstruc-
 ture" (politics and cultural life) invaded the
 "base"  (the  economy).  Since  that  time,
 there have been several shifts to the left and
 right, but the important point is that the
 revolutionary turmoil is now common to both
 political and econonuc life and directly af-
 fects the growing of grain and the making of
 steel a

 and  persistent  economic  prob-
 lems f`or China's leaders is how
 to increase 'the populous nation's
 agricultural  lroductivity.
 The acuteness of the problem
 becomes evident when it is rea-
 lizrvd  that  agriculture  in  China
 I ague china
 But it generally averages below
 30 percent,  and it typically oc-
 curs  in  sinuous  and  relatively
 narrow  bands  along  the  river
 valleys and on the immediately
 adjacent  slopes.         '
 pansion  of  land  under  cultiva-
 tion.  Most plans for significant
 increases in agricultural output,
 j therefore,  have  been. geared  to
 ' improving yields.
 Basic Problems
 The   further   expansion   of
 irrigation and multiple cropping
 may increase output.  However,
 a  substantial  improvement  in
 agricultural   productivity   ap-
 pears to  depend  more on the
 greater  use  of  chemical    fer-
 tilizers and the use of improved
 seed.
 Basic to all plans for increas-
 ed agricultural production is the
 need  for  better  land  manage-
 ment  and  coordination  of  the
 land  and   water  conservancy
 programs.
 New Lands Opened
 The cultivated area  of  China
 has  fluctuated within relatively
 narrow limits during the past 15
 years.  Although  new  land  has
 I  been. brought into cultivation it
 I apparently  has  not  been  suf-
 ficient to offset the losses caused
 by greatly expanded urban and
 ' industrial  areas, as well as the
 i construction  of a large number
 ' of  reservoirs, and a number of
 physical factors such as saliniza-
 tion and erosion.
 Most  of  the  new  land  has
 been opened in Northeast China
 and  in  Sinkiang by state farm
 and  military  resettlement  pro-
 f  jects.  Although  a potential for
 opening new land for cultivation
 remains,  most land  that  is  not
 already  in  use  is  in  marginal
 agricultural  area.  Aridity,  al-
 titude, short growing season, and
 other  physical  factors  discour-
 age  farming  there.
 A  reluctance  of  the  Chinese
 Communists to invest in costly,
 accounts for almost 50  percent
 ;of the national income, employs
 -about  80  percent of  the labor
 'force axed provides a  major pro-
 . pox?tion of the country's exports.
 Additionally,  the  size  of  the
 yearly  harvest  vitally  affects
 i consumption,  industrial  produc-
 ,tion,  capital  investment,  rev-
 emte,  foreign  and  retail  trade
 and other economic variables.
 ,'~ln  estimated  ll  percent  of
 Ghina's  land  area  is  now  cul-
 tivated,   and   about   40   per-
 cent  of  it  is  probably  double-
 cropped.   The total sown area is
 roughly    equal  to  that  in  the
 United :hates.   However, almost
 all tilled land   is  located in the
 eastern  half     of  the  country,
 where  there  are  sizable  areas
 with 50 percent or more of the
 land under cultivation.
 These areas include nearly all
 of  the  North  China  Plain  and
 the valley of the lower Yangtze ~

 Rice Dominotes South
 The  most  significant  division
 in China is that which separates
 the  rice-growing  southern  pro-
 vinces .from  the  northern  pro-
 vinces  that  specialize  in  wheat
 and small grains.  Within these
 two broad groups a large variety
 of other crops is grown.
 Rice is dominant almost every-

 erally accounts for 50 percent or
 ~ more of the area sown to food
 crops.  Double-cropping  of  rice
 is  dominant  south  of  the  Nan
 Ling River in Kwangsi, and in
 southern Fukien.
 To the north, in 5zechwang a
 combination  of  corn  and  swcrl
 potatoes is extensively cultivat-
 ed.  Corn is a particularly im-
 portant crop for the non-Chinese
 hill  people  of  Yunnan  and
 Kweichbw     because   it   suits
 the  cooler  temperatures  and
 shorter  growing  season  of ;the
