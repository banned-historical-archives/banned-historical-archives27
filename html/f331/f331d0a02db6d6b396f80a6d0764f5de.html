 BREZHNEV GAINS AUTHORITY, ENDORSEMENT OF SUMMIT DIPLOMACY
 On the eve of Brezhnev's projected visits to the West, the
 Soviet party leader has received strong endorsements of his
 detente policy and his role as a world statesman.  The
 endorsements by the 26-27 April CPSU Central Committee plenum
 were appreciably stronger than those made on the eve of the
 Moscow summit at the May 1972 plenum.  At the same time, the
 Kremlin shakeup approved by the plenum--the most extensive
 change of its kind in over a decade--served not only to
 consolidate Brezhnev's power but also to enhance the status of
 the bureaucracies which have been the instruments and supports
 of his policymaking leadership.
 Brezhnev's role as architect of the Soviet "peace program" and
 his personal identification with the succescps already cl3i.med
 for that program were highlighted in the plenum resolution?
 In addition to acknowledging Brezhnev's "great person-i1 contri-
 bution" to statesmanship, the resolution directed the Politburo
 to adhere to the "principles and conclusions" contained in his
 foreign policy report to the plenum.  Such explicit praise for
 Brezhnev and such explicit acknowledgment of his policymaking
 leadership had been notably absent in the May 1972 plenum
 resolution.  The current resolution also went out of its way to
 endorse the practice of personal diplomacy by the Soviet leaders.
 Although the plenum did not break any new ground in foreign
 police, it reflected the overriding emphasis which Moscow has
 recently placed on expansion of trade and economic relations with
 the West.  The resolution singled out an "activization" of such
 links as an especially effective means of facilitating the
 normalization of international relations.
 0
 In a remarkable show of public support for Brezhnev and his
 detente policy, the plenum was addressed by eight Politburo
 members and three candidate members--by far the largest
 participation by Politburo members in a public party gathering
 in the post-Khrushchev period.  The previous high of four
 members and three candidates was registered at the September
 1965 plenum which approved the regime's industrial reform
 program.
 Brezhnev's personal identification with Soviet foreign policy was
 further underscored by his reception of the Lenin Peace Prize,

 announced in the central press on May Day.  Moreover, his
 enhanced position in the leadership was reflected in a change
 in the Politburo listings occasioned by the elevation of
 lndropov to full membership in that body.  In a departure from
 the standard alphabetical listings of Politburo members, a
 Moscow domestic radio broadcast of the May Day festivities in
 Real Square listed Brezhnev first among those on the reviewing
 stand atop the Lenin Mausoleum, followed by the rest of the
 Politburo in alphabetical order.  Such a device for singling out
 the party leader was utilized sparingly even in the hhrushchev
 period, and it remains to be seen whether it will become
 regularized in the future.
 RED STAR STRESSES MILITARY'S ROLE IN DEFENSE POLICYMAKING
 In the first of a projected series of articles on Soviet military
 theory, RED STAR has taken a subtly partisan position on the
 critical issue of the military's role in the making of defense
 policy.  Authored by Lt. Gen. I. Zavyalov, whose previous
 ;._~.,~~*ifi-^t'nn^ ^?~^^~^* r rr-v!fi.nns ?..+irh the Genera]   Staff,   the
 19 April article goes over familiar ground In describing the
 main characteristics of Soviet military doctrine.  It offers some
 new formulations, however, or. the question of the authorship of
 Soviet military doctrine, suggesting that the military's role in
 this process is the primary one.  It also suggests that the
 driving force behind the changes to be expected in Soviet
 military policy in the future will be a product more of military
 than of pol{tical inputs into the policymaking process.  The
 elevation of Marshal Grechko to the Politburo should serve, at
 least, to strengthen any such tendencies.
 Zavyalov's assignment of a primary role to the military in the
 formulation of Soviet military doctrine is indirect but
 unmistakable.  He begins with an obeisance to party authority by
 noting that military doctrine 3.s in "complete accordance" with
 par!:y policy and that, indeed, its substance is set forth in the
 specific decisions of the party on military matters.  He then
 goes on to state, however, that the "discovery and generalization"
 of the propositions on which party decisions are based  is the
 task of "our military-scientific thought."
 Far from leaving the matter at this level of logical innuendo,
 Zavyalov goes on to reinforce the implications of his definition
 by identifying Soviet military thought with the reigning Soviet

 orthodoxies of the moment.  He describes Soviet military doctrine
 as "scientific," as based on "really exictirig conditions," and
 as representing a considered "teaching" on war that has been
 "adopted in our country and its armed forces."  :ioreover, as
 if to place his definition beyond the reach of criticism, he
 asserts that "a correct, scientific interpretation of the
 concept of 4ni.litary doctrine "'--presumably the one he had Just
 given--is an outstanding expression of the creativity of Soviet
 military doctrine.
 The connection between these scholastic formulas and the
 practical issues of policymaking lies in the peculiar Soviet
 concept of military doctrine.  The Soviets have consistently
 presented military doctrine as virtually indistinguishable
 from military policy itself.  Thus in r_redittng the military
 with a primary role in the formulation of military doctrine,
 Zavyalov is assigning them, in eff-ct, a corresponding
 responsibility for the formulation of military policy.
 According to his own definition, which corresponds in this
 respect with that of other Soviet writers, the military-
 technical aspect of doctrine--that is, the part that would
 seem to fall peculiarly within the province of the military's
 professional expertise--includes the problems of determining
 the strategic nature of a possible future war, the means of
 waging it, how to use these means, how to equip the armed
 forces, and so on.  In sum, it includes all the issues on
 which the military might be expected to have a particular
 institutional interest to press.
 The bias toward the military which Zavyalov has introduced
 into his treatment of thee: subtle formulas is far from
 unprecedented in Soviet military writings.  Military writers
 during Khrushchev's regime also tinkered with these formulas to
 record the military's claim to a share of responsibility for
 determining the nature and scope of the reforms that were then
 being carried out.  In more recent years, there has been little
 evidence of military agitation on this score.  The orthodox
 position during these years seems to have been reflected, for
 example, in an article by Major General Sulimov in RED STAR on
 15 January 1970.  Ascribing the leadership in all military
 affairs to the party, Sulimov went on to say that among the
 party's functions was "the formulation of a military,  doctrine
 in which the state's official views on the nature of a possible
 future war, and the conditions and means of insuring victory,
 are expressed."  Whether Zavyalov's new formulation rei ects
 a new military assertiveness on doctrinal and policy issues may
 be clarified by the subsequent installments of RED STAR's new
 theoretical series.

 EUROPE
 MOSCOW RESERVED, EAST EUROPE MORE VOCAL ON KISSINGER SPEECH
 Limited comment from Moscow and more vocal reaction from its East
 European allies on Presidential adviser Kissinger's 23 April
 speech at the annual Associated Press meeting has pictured it
 as an acknowledgment of the failure of NATO cold war policy
 under the pressure of the foreign policy of the socialist
 countries.  Highlighting passages in which Kissinger referred
 to Western disagreements over economic questions and over
 sharing the burden of defense expenditures, Moscow and its
 allies have also sought to portray the speech as another U.S.
 effort to force economic concessions from West Europe by
 linking the question of the stationing of U.S. troops in
 Europe with the forthcoming trade and monetary negotiations.
 Moscow has conveyed this view, however, largely by quoting
 Western comxrents selected to highlight. alleged frictions
 between Washington and West European capitals.  Negligible
 direct Soviet comment included a claim on 29 April, in the
 Moscow domestic service commentators' roundtable, that the
 speech demonstrated the failure of NATO policy.
 The East European allies, on the other hand, have commented
 at some length on the speech, emphasizing the alleged U.S.
 linkage of economic and military issues to wrest concessions
 from West Europe.  Typical was the comment of the deputy
 chief editor of Sofia's RABOTNICHESKO DELO, Donev, who wrote
 on the 28th that the point of Kissinger's "trial balloon" was
 a search not for a "new charter" but for "new forms to
 pure-le the old policy of domination" by the United States.
 EAST-WEST TALKS      The suggestion that Kissinger's speech
 was in some way intended to influence
 the results of the conference on security and cooperation
 in Europe (CSCE) was raised explicitly in a Bratislava radio
 commentary on the 25th.  Asserting that West European
 capitals had received the speech with "considerable reserve,"
 the commentator asked rhetorically if Kissinger wished to
 "limit the function of the European security charter, which
 is likely to emerge as one of the results of the CSCE."

 The Helsinki talks have not been mentioned in available Soviet
 comment on the speech.  In fact, aside from brief references
 by PRAVDA's Mayevskiy on the 15th and IZVESTIYA's Matveyev on
 the 19th, in general articles on international developments,
 the talks were latgly ignored by Moscow iu any context during
 the 6-25 April adjournment.  However, on the 25th, the day the
 talks resumed, IZVESTIYA's Goloshubov discussed at length the
 progress made at Helsinki, labeling the fourth round the
 "concluding phase" of the talks.  He reviewed all the major
 agenda topics and noted in conclusion--as Matveyev tad done on
 the 19th--that "certain NATO countries" want to slow down the
 multilateral talks in order "to force the Soviet Union to make
 more concessions in Helsinki."

 CHINA
 LOW-KEY CELEBRATIONS MARK MAY DAY; MOST LEADERS APPEAR
 May Day celebrations in Peking followed the low-key style set
 last year, indicating that this may now be pro forma.  Except
 for attending Chen I's funeral in January 1972, Mao has not
 been reported appearing outside his study in two years.  As
 in 1972, there was neither a May Day editorial nor a central
 fireworks display.  In tole new style, all the active Politburo
 members based in Peking "joined the masses and foreign friends
 in the capital in gala activities in the parks."  Leaders were
 listed according to mixed party-state rankings, with Chou En-lai
 at the top followed by NPC Chairman Chu Te.  PRC Acting Chairman
 Tung Pi-wu, ranked immediately after Chou last May Day, was
 absent this time.  Chiang Ching was listed third ahead of
 Yeh Chien-ying, who had been given precedence over her for the
 second time when she last appeared on 12 March.  Politburo members
 Chen Hsi-lien and Hsu Shih-yu appeared at their regional bases.
 With luug s auseuc.e probably sue resuiL ULliail health, the
 turnout among state and government leaders conveyed an impression
 of growing normalcy in Peking.  The presence among NPC vice
 chairmen of Sa.ifudin, who usually appears only in his Sinkiang
 bailiwick, may indicate that consultations involving the NPC have
 taken place.  The recently rehabilitated Teng Hsiao-ping was
 listed with two other vice premiers who lost their Politburo
 status during the cultural revolution, Chen Yun and Li Fu-chun.
 In a telescoped view of the turbulent recent years, an NCNA
 account of the festivities said the celebrants hailed the
 country's "tremendous victories" in the cultural revolution and
 the "new victories in all fields of w6:k thanks to the movement
 to criticize revisionism and rectify the style of work."  The
 criticism and rectification movement has been directed against
 the deviations associated with Chen Po-ta and Lin Piao.
 The absence of a May Day editorial does not in itself indicate
 leadership or policy problems, least of all in internal affairs.
 May Day editorials have traditionally dealt with foreign policy
 issues, and even before Lin's fall the regime had not felt that
 an editorial on this occasion was obligatory.  There was no May
 Day editorial in 1969, but a joint editorial was issued three
 days later to mark the 50th anniversary of the May Fourth movement.
 Last year, after failing to issue a May Day editorial, Peking
 produced a joint editorial on 23 May to commemorate the

 which had been delivered at another time of rectification.
 That editorial called for "deepening the criticism of and
 struggle against . . . political swindlers" and denounced
 "pseudo-Marxist swindlers" who "waved red flags to oppose the
 red flag."
 RED FLAG EXPLAINS LINE ON CONDUCTING RECTIFICATION
 The authoritative journal RED FLAG's April issue, which
 coincided with the reappearance of Teng Hsiao-ping, has
 reflected the regime's problems in coping with the effects of
 the Lin Piao affair and in overcoming bewilderment and uncertainty
 among the cadres and masses.  One article, peg-ed to a 1948
 Mao work at another time when there had been successive campaigns
 against rightist and leftist deviations, explains th- policy of
 rehabilitation and seeks to reinvigorate hesitant cadres by
 distinguishing shortcomings from the mortal sin of "opportunism."*
 Still another article, attributed to a low-level party committee
 and broadcast by Radio Peking on 24 April, pursues a similar
 aim by arguing that "criticism of revisionism" is directed only
 at high-level leaders who betrayed the party but that these
 conflicts at the top should not be reproduced in recriminations
 and fear at lower levels.
 The second article elaborates a line, first appearing around the
 turn of the year, that the heresy of Lin and his cohorts ("swindlers
 like Liu Shao-chi") was "ultrarightist" no less than that of
 Liu Shao-chi and the main targets of the cultural revolution
 ("Liu Shao-chi and his company").  Reflecting the regime's
 anxiety to control the impact of the Lin purge, the criticism
 and rectification campaign has been conducted with the caveats
 that criticism must come first and only then rectification, that
 the target of uncompromising attack is only the narrow group of
 plotters for power, and that a distinction must be made between
 contradictions among the people and those between the people and
 the enemy.   The RED FLAG article makes the point that the latter
 conflicts were concentrated at the top and must not be confused
 with shortcomings at lower levels.  Thus, the article warns against
 becoming "entangled with the minor problems of the basic-level
 units and making the trivialities among the people themselves the
 target of criticism."

 RED FLAG registers the center's dissatisfaction with the development
 of the anti-Lin campaign, indicating that some good had been
 achieved in arousing "the indignation of the masses" but that
 "some comrades" went astray in addressing concrete issues and in
 mistakenly interpreting the problem as a matter of leftist and
 rightist views.  According to the article, some comrades regarded
 Lin-type swindlers as ultraleftists, but they came to realize
 that Lin and Liu both in essence were ultrarightist.  In this context
 the article criticizes the "twu unhealthy tendencies" that resulted
 from an incorrect reading of the successive purges.  At one time,
 when Lin's line was in the ascendancy, production and technical
 work were sacrificed to the highly politicized interests of the
 cultural revolution.  But in early 1972, the article indicates,
 the attacks on Lin's line caused an overreaction in the other
 direction, causing cadres to relax their efforts on the ideological
 and political fronts.  It is presumably in the interest of
 combating the latter tendency that Lin's heresy was redesignated
 one of ultrarightism in a few months ago.

 INDUCHINA
 With the Vietnam cer.se-fire entering its fourth troubled month,
 Hanoi continued to blame the United States and Saigon for the
 failure of the Paris agreement to bring ;?eace and gav3 no public
 sign of readiness to modify its position in order to stop the
 fighting or encourage implementation of  t?he political aspects
 of the accord.  Hanoi predictably used Oe third monthly anniver-
 sary of the agreement, 27 April, as the o,casion for an authorita-
 tive airing of its intransigent  response to U.S. moves to induce
 communiot compliance.  A DRV Foreign Ministry statement that day
 rejected the U.S. note on communist violations, made public three
 days earlier, and maintained that there must be a change in US.
 policies in order to guarantee peace in Vietnam and allow the
 normalization of U.S.-DRV relations.
 The uncompromising communise: position on the situation in S,Juth
 Vietnam was set forth in detail in a six-point PRG proposal,
 presented at the 25 April session of the GVN-PRG consultative
 conference in Paris, which gave priority to the creation of a
 favorable climate in South Vietnam for the political struggle
 against the ('VN.
 Hanoi's resolve tr pursue its long-standing goals was reaffirmed
 by DRV leaders in speeches before an audience gathered in the
 North Vietnamese capital for an unprecedented May Day extravaganza.
 Premier Pham Van Dong and Defense Minister Vo Nguyen Giap routinely
 extolled the "grer:,t victory" represented by the withdrawal of
 U.S. forces.
 FANOI SC^;_S U,S, NOTE, RAISES DOUBT ON KISSINGER-THO MEETING
 The27April DRV Foreign Ministry statement, summing up Hanoi's view
 of the first three months since the signing of the Paris agreement,
 charged that "very serious and systematic" U.S. and Saigon violations
 of the accord have caused peace in South Vietnam to be "directly
 threatened" and have created an increasingly strained situation in
 Indochina.  Like the DRV Foreign Ministry's 16 April note to the
 participants in the 12-power international conference on Vietnmi,
 the foreign m'.nistry statement recounted alleged U.S., and GVN
 violations and, in routine fashion, accused the United States of
 refusing to end its military involvement in Indochina and give up
 the scheme of carrying out the Nixon Doctrine and "imposing
 neocolonialism."  Providing Hanoi's official response to the U.S.

 note to the conference participants, release.] on 24 April, the
 foreign ministry statement disparaged the note aii an effort to
 explain away "flagrant" U.S. violatiors and to shift responsibility
 to the DRV.  The statement ::eclared that the Vietnamese "resolutely
 reject these sophisms and slanders."
 The statement's condemnation of "U.S. ruling circles" for trying
 to present U.S. "vioiati_ins" as a reply to DRV violations echoed
 other Hanoi comment in the wake of the U.S. moves to bring about
 communist compliance with the peace accord--the 17 April halt in
 U.S. mineclearing operations in DRV waters and the 19 April
 suspension of U.S.-DRV economic talks and resumption of aerial
 reconnaissance over the DRV.  Claiming that this U.S. policy was
 aimed in part at preparing the way 'or "new U.S. military
 adventures," the statement charged that "U.S. authorities" have
 also repeated threats designed to pressure the people of Vietnam
 and the rest of Indochina.  It also accused Defense Secretary
 Richardson of "cynically th:?eatening" to bomb North Vietnam again.
 Like the 30 March DRV Government statement marking the conclusion of
 r.hQ  girct  rr.,n  mnnrha of t-hp nngr-avrPPmPnt  nPrind, the foreign
 ministry statement argued that a shift in U.S. policies was the key
 to a stable peace: and to the development of U.S.-DRV relations.  It
 echoed the government statement in calling upon Washington to learn
 a lesson from the war and to give up past policies and implement
 the peace accord.  The earlier government statement said that such
 action would be necessary to usher in an "era of reconciliation"
 between the United States and the DRV and to create conditions for
 establi6hing a new U.S.-DRV relationship.   .he current foreign
 ministry statement was a shade more specific, usinr, language
 contained in the 14 February joint communique on Kissinger's visit
 to Hanoi but not usually repeated in Hanoi statements:  Thus it
 asserted that such a change in U.S. policy would create favorable
 conditions for advancement toward "normalization" of relations
 between the United States and the DRV.
 U.S.-DRV TALKS      Hanoi duly publicized the announcement of
 26 April that DRV Vice Foreign Minister Nguyen
 Co Thach and U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Sullivan
 would meet on the following day to "prepare for the review of the
 implementation of the Paris agreement" and to seek "appropriate
 measures aimed at ensuring the strict implementation of the
 agreement."  Hanoi's announcement did not, however, reflect the
 reports from Washington that the Sullivan-Thach meetings were in
 preparation for a meeting between Kissinger and North Vietnamese

 Politburo member LV Duc Tho In mid-May.        Ilanoi's apparent failure
 to agree to the higher-level. c011nu1tati.ons was made clearer on
 the 28th, when 11n.nol reed la publicized a "communique" from tile
 DRV embassy in Paris which said the embassy had no information
 on the pros reports of the Kissinger-Tho meeting and charged
 that "thin is a case of unil.aterrnl information by the United
 States."
 The continued exacerbation of U.S.-DRV relations in the wake of
 the 27-30 April meetings between Sullivan and Thnch was pointed
 up on 2 May when Hanoi reported that the P RV delegation to the
 U.S.-D161 economic talks had left Paris by Hanoi.  The delegation
 had stn)ed on in Paris since the suspension of the talks on
 19 April, presumably in hopes that they would resume.
 PRG OFFERS SIX-POINT PROGRAM AT CONSULTATIVE MEETING WITH GVN
 The 25 April. GVN-PRG consultative meeting in Paris, held two days
 before the end of the 90-day period suggested in the Paris
 agreement: for the resolution of political issues, provided a
 forum for both sides to put their platforms on the record.
 Starting with the general framework of the Paris agreement, each
 spelled out its respective program to deal with outstanding
 problems in such a way as to assure the advancement of its
 paramount interests.  The PRG's six-point proposal gave priorit~.to achieving ccnditions in South Vietnam suitable for the pursuit
 of a nol.itical struggle and made it clear that the communists do
 not wish to participate in general elections, called for in the
 Paris accord, until the situation in the South has drastically
 altered.
 The PRG's first point, calling for strict implementation of the
 cease-fire, routinely placed the onus on Saigon for the continued
 fighting.  Thus, it stated that both parties must cease hostilities,
 but then specified that the GVN armed forces must "end at once
 all their land-grabbing operations, all bombing and shelling,
 all hostile acts, all terrorism, coercion, and reprisals, and
 immediately bring back their units to the positions held before
 28 January 1973."
 The return of civilian prisoners ranked next in the PRG's list,
 underlining the importance the communists have consistently given
 this issue.  The contrast between communist and GVN priorities
 was stressed in a 29 April commentary in NHAN DAN, pegged to the

 GVN's statement tit the. 25 April meeting, which scored Saigon
 for failing to "say a single word about the two major and urgent
 problems in South Vietnam at present--that is, an effective
 cease-fire and the complete return of- the civilian personnel
 detained by the Saigon a dministiation."
 The PRG's third point, advocating the :insurance of democratic
 liberties, provided a communist interpretation of Article 11 of
 the Paris agreement, which calls in very general terms for the
 guarantee of basic freedoms such as the freedom of movement,
 speech, political activities, and the p?ess.  Spelling out
 conditions the communists undoubtedly view as necessary to the
 pursuit of a political struggle, the PRG proposal specified, for
 example, that freedom of movement must encompass the right to
 move between the zones of the two sides, that there must be
 freedom to "engage in political activities" in both zones, and
 that censorship must be ended and "newspapers of different trends"
 be allowed to circulate in both zones.  The 29 April NIIAN DAN
 article deprecated the Saigon proposal on this score, noting
 that it merely suggested restoring the freedoms that had been
 ~i.1fr.1  1..  h1.n  ..nv  n>.i  nly~.?rr~>n  th-t  thn  r:VN T.'tc "ipnnrinp"  the
 liberties defined by the Paris agreement.
 The PRG's evident concern to guarantee protection for the
 activities of Saigon's opponents was also reflected in the
 fourth poin~, which called for the formation of the National
 Council of National Reconciliation and Concord.  This point
 summarized Article 12 of the accord on cne establishment of the
 ,~runcil and went on to advocate agreement on its structure,
 membership, working reguiLt~ions, ar.-i the "inviolability of the
 council members."
 The PRG proposal underlined the priority of the first four
 points by presenting them ^E the "first stage" in a settlement
 and by stipulating that they must be "fully implemented" before
 the beginning of the second stage, which would include the final
 two points:  general elections and the question of disposition
 of armed forces.  The importance of assuring democratic liberties
 prior to elections was also p,,-ssed again in the proposal's
 fifth point on elections.
 The fifth point reaffirmed the PRG's willingness to reach an
 agreement with the GVN on the institutions to be set up through
 general elections; but it glaringly reflected the difficulty in
 doing so when it recalled the PRG's former proposal--adamantly

 rejected by Saigon--for general. elections for a constituent
 assembly to work out a c;.inntitution and set up a new government.
 This proposal has not been advocated is Vietnamese media since
 last October, prior to the start of the U.S.-DRV negotiat!lons
 leading to the Paris  ccord.
 The PRG's six-point program offered no time frame for the proposed
 elections; by contrast, the GVN proposal at thr, 25 April meeting
 suggested a precise timetable for steps leading to general
 elerti.ons on 26 August 1973--seven months after the conclusion
 of the Paris accord.  Prior to the signing of the peace agreement,
 DRV Premier Pham Van Dong, in an 1.8 October 1972 interview with
 NEWSWEEK, and PRC Foreign Minister Nguyen Thi Dinh, in a 4 December
 1972 Interview with TI.tE, had both indicated that it would be
 "reasonable" to have a six-mont-i delay between a cease-fire and
 elections.  Neither interview was publicized in Vietnamese communist
 media.
 The PRG's sixth point, dealing with "the question of Vietnamese
 armed forces in South Vietnam," is a concession to Saigon's
 repeated deriand that the two sides deal with the problem of
 North Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam.  The proposal merely
 repeated Article 13 of the Paris agreement stipulating that the
 two sides should settle the question of Vietnamese armed forces in
 the South and that their discussions include such questions as
 measures to reduce military effectives and to demobilize troops
 being reduced.   The 29 April NHAN DAN commen:-.ary or. the GVN
 proposal reiterated the communists' opposition to the demand for
 the withdrawal of forces, calling it "at variance with the spirit
 and letter of ti:e Paris agreement."
 MASSIVE HANOI MAY DAY CELEBRATION HAILS COMMiJNIST "VICTORY"
 Hanoi's May Day celebration gave every appearance of a calculated
 effort to present a united leadership and to boost public
 confidence in the situation in Vietnam.  Exultation over the "great
 victory" in resisting the United States provided the keynote for
 the unprecedented festivities.  Commentaries pointed out that the
 celebration came at a time when, for the first time in 115 years,
 Vietnam had been "freed from all foreign aggressor troops"; and
 this theme of historic victory was underscored in the rally speech
 by Premier Pham Van Dong and the Order of the Day address by
 Defense Minister Vo Nguyen Giap.  This is the first time that Giap
 has addressed a May Day meeting and the first time in a decade

 that the main speaker on this occasion was a Politburo member.
 (Truong Chinh delivered the main address in 1963 and Phain Van
 Dong last had this role in 1962.)
 The rally also prompted a turnout of all the Vietnam Workers
 Party (VWP) Politburo members currently in North Vietnam and other
 high-level officials.*  The VNA report on the rally gave unusually
 high praise to the top echelon of Hanoi's g.,vernment and party
 leaders, noting that "outstanding comrades-in-arms and successors
 of President Ho Chi Minh, veteran revolutioiaries steeled in the
 fire of struggle," were on the reviewing stag!.  Those singled
 out by the report were President Ton Duc Thang, Vice President
 Nguyen Luong Bang, and the top members of the Politburo:  Le Duan,
 Truong Chinh, Pham Van Dong, Vo Nguyen Gi.ap, Le Duc Tho, and
 Nguyen Duy Trinh.  Hanoi is not known to have previously used
 such plaudits for its leaders on such occasions,, although Ton Duc
 Thang and Nguyen Luong Bang hale previously be...-,n referred to as
 comrades-in-arms of Ho.
 VNA claimed that the May Day rally was attended by nearly 100,000
 nonn1 0  from  n11  ni+nr Hip  rnnnnrrv--Yhp  1.nrc,f+Gt  rt,rnout  since  the.
 U.S. air strikes in 1965 prompted the curtailment of such gatherings.
 In another departure, Hanoi staged a massive parade of military
 and civilian components, viewed by "hundreds of thousands" of
 people.  Hanoi has not held a May Day parade since 1960 and is not
 known to have ever staged a military parade to mark the occasion.
 Pham Van Dong's speech routinely reaffirmed that the DRV and PRG
 "have always strictly respected and scrupulously implemented the
 Paris agreement," and he repeated charges of U.S. and Hanoi
 violations.  However, the main thrust of his sTueech conveyed
 jubilation over the withdrawal of U.S. troops and certainty of
 eventual victory.  On the sensitive Issue of foreign assistance,
 Dong maintained that "we will always rely mainly on our own forces
 while striving for assl.stance in various fields from the Soviet
 Unicn, China, and the other fraternal socialist countries."
 *  Among the officials present at the rally was VWP Secretariat
 member Nguyen Van Tran who, according to a report in the 28 April
 PRAVDP,, just concluded an 18-27 '.pril visit in the Soviet Union.
 He met with Grishin and, according to the report, "acquainted
 himself with the CPSU's work experience in the field of party
 leadership of industry and mun+.cipal services."  Available Hanoi
 media did not mention the visit.

 Reiterating a point made in his National Assembly speech in
 February, Dong added:   "We are prepared to cooperate in the
 economic fieli with all countries desiring to cooperate with us
 on the basis of respect for each other's independence and
 sovereignty, equality, and mutual benefit."  Dong's concern
 about aid was again reflected in his brief closing statement to
 the i. -ally which included an appeal to socialist countries and
 the world's peoples for "greater sympathy, support, and assistance."
 As in other comment in recent months, Giap's Order of the Day
 credited the communists' "victory" primarily to the party's
 "correct and creative political and military lines."  He went on
 to note routinely that it also represents "a success of
 international support and solidarity."  The editorial on May
 Day in the army paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN not only praised the
 party's role but also struck a decidedly nationalistic note,
 claiming that "Vietnam's victory" was a triumph for Marxism-
 Leninism and a contribution "to further enriching the
 proletariat's treasure of revolutionary theories and further
 enriching the proletarian military science."  Alluding to the
 indebtedness of Hanoi's communist allies, the editorial also
 claimed that the Vietnamese "victory" has "created more favorable
 conditions for the fraternal socialist countries to carry out
 economic construction and development and the development of
 national defense in peace . . . ."

 MOSCOW COMMENT CENTERS ON CONSOLIDATION OF VIETNAM PEACE
 Moscow has sustained a low-key stance on events in Vietnam,
 offering only routine support to the DRV-PRG charges of U.S.
 violations of the peace agreement.  Recent Soviet official
 pronouncements on Vietnam have stressed that the w"r is over
 and that Soviet support will be forthcoming for the consolidation
 of peace.  While Soviet media have continued to report the
 Vietnamese communist charges of violations, the Soviet leadership
 has displayed reluctance to react to these charges directly.
 The 28 April PRAVDA editorial on the recently concluded CPSU
 Central Committee foreign policy plenum addressed by Brezhnev
 made only pausing mention of the communist "victory" in Vietnam
 and the "all-round" assistance provided by the Soviet Union.  The
 editorial stated that the USSR "will facilitate in every way the
 establishment of peace in Indochina."  The plenum resolution,
 adopted on 27 April, listed among the positive trends in world
 affairs the termination of "the imperialist aggression against
 Vietnam" and again stressed Soviet dedication to peace.  These
 theme:, ~acr,  -cif tern'-crl in RrP~hnc~~'s May , av Gpeerh in Red Square
 which also recalled the "powerful" support of the Soviet Union
 and other socialist countries for the Vietnamese communists.
 While focusing on an improved situation in Vietnam, the official
 statements relating to the plenum and the May Day festivities notably
 avoided any reference to violations of the peace agreement.
 In keeping with this stance, Moscow has to date still failed to
 respond officially to the DRV note of 16 April and PRG memorandum of
 14 April, addressed to the participants in the 12?-nation Paris
 conference, which detailed alleged U.S. and Saigon violations of
 the peace agre:--went.
 BACKGROUND      The Soviet leadership's emphasis on the positive
 aspects of the situation in Vietnam was clearly
 ev.dent at Kosygin's 5 April press conference in Sweden.
 According to a report in NEW TIMES on 13 April, Kosygin, in
 response to a question on the possibility of renewed U.S.
 intervention in Vietnam, pointed to the President's statements
 calling for strict observance of the Paris agreements.  Asked
 if Sweden had leveled "sharper and more critical accusations"
 against the United States than the Soviet Unior had made, Kosygin
 skirted the question by noting that for many years the Soviet
 iinion had "waged an active struggle" against aggression in Vietnam
 and had givea great aid and support to Vietnam.

 A similar reluctance to focus on alleged U.S. violations of the
 accords was displayed by Podgornyy in remarks during PRG
 Foreign Minister Binh's official visit to the Soviet Union.
 In presenting Madame Binh with an award on 28 March, Podgornyy
 referred only to Saigon's violations and its "attempts to
 sabotage" the ,.greement.  The joint PRG-USSR communique issued
 on 2 April likewise avoided any reference to U.S. violations.
 A sitrilnr stance was taken in Ustinov's Lenin anniversary speech
 on 20 April.
 H
 Although TASS has duly reported the DRV and PRG charges of U.S.
 violations, comment on the charges has been routine and low-level.
 Following Xuan Thuy's meeting with Suslov on 11 April, PRAVDA
 reported that the latter expressed Moscow's support of the
 statements by the DRV on 30 March and by the PRG on 1 April
 criticizing the United States for violating the accords.  In a
 TASS summary of a 29 April PRAVDA article by Valerian Skvortsov,
 the PRG's six-pc?'nt proposal waa called an "important initiative"
 which "opens up new possibilities for clearing the barriers that
 still stand in the w~.y of the fulfillment of the agreement on
 Vietnam."  While stressing the positive aspects of the proposal,
 the PRAVDA article noted that Saigon has still not released its
 political prisoners and that "Seventh Fleet aircraft carriers"
 continue to bomb Laos and Cambodia and to make overflights of the
 DRV territory.

 PEKING RECEPTION MARKS INDOCHINA SUv1MIT ANNIVERSARY
 The Peking observance of the third anniversary of the Indochinese
 summit conference, which occasioned the usual PRC leaders'
 message and a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial,* was rounded out by a
 reception on 25 April hosted by RGNU Prime Minister Penn Nouth
 and attended by Sihanouk, a strong contingent of Chinese
 leaders headed by Chou En-lai, and diplomatic representatives
 of Sihanouk's Indochinese and Korean allies.  Also attending
 was DRV negotiator Xuan Thuy, stopping over in Peking on his way
 home; on the same day he had "a very cordial and friendly
 conversation" with Chou and Politburo member Chang Chun-chiao.
 In their speeches at the reception Penn Nouth, ranking Chinese
 military leader Yeh Chien-ying, and t':he PRG and DRV envoys
 joined in warm salutes to Sihanouk's recent tour of the Cambodian
 "liberated zone" while expressing each side's views on the
 current Indochina situation.
 Penn Nouth's speech reaffirmed the FUNK's current hard line,
 denouncing the Phnom Penh leaders by name and deriding their
 "serious cabinet crisis," condemning the United States for bombing
 Cambodia and supporting an alleged "new massive invasion" by
 Saigon and Thai forces, and reiterating the FUNK's determination
 to continue the struggle "without compromise or retreat."  This
 line was amplified in a FUNK radio editorial the same day
 denouncing President Nixon as an "international criminal chieftain"
 and pledging a continued armed offensive until the United States
 is driven out and "the gang of traitors Lori Nol, Sirik Matak, Son
 Ngoc Thanh, and In Tam is overthrown and complete".y destroyed."
 The Vietnamese speakers used the occasion to charge U.S. and
 Saigon violations of the Vietnam agreement and to invoke
 Indochinese solidarity as a counterweight to "perfidious schemes"
 and "insolent threats" by the United States and its allies to
 thwart the Indochinese struggle.
 Yeh Chien?-ying took a rather gloomy view of the situation, noting
 that the Indochinese "are still faced with arduous fighting tasks"

 "continual obstruction" by i:he United States and Saigon.  Yeh
 mentioned the U.S. suspension of minesweeping and resumption of
 reconnaissance over the DRV, and he pointed out "in particular"
 that the United States "is still stepping 'ip its armed intervention"

 in Cambodia.  He demanded that the United States and Saigon
 respect the Vietnam Ind Laos agreements and end "all armed
 iicervention" in Cambodia and Laos, but he made no mention of
 the Lon Nol government or of a Cambodian settlement.  According
 to NCNA's account, Yeh offered a rather bland pledge that the
 Chinese will "firmly support" the Indochinese struggles.  VNA
 quoted him as reaffirming Peking's "close militant friendship
 and great solidarity" with the Indochinese and as promising
 assistance for their struggles.
 Although Yeh leveled charges against the United States in some
 detail, the Chinese have been careful not to portray American
 actions as endangering the Indochina accords.  Thus, NCNA's
 account of the 25 April NHAN DAN editorial on the summit
 anniversary omitted passages charging that U.S. violations were
 threatening the peace agreements and accusing Washington of
 attempting to intimidate the DRV.  While carrying the text of
 the six-point proposal presented by the PRG representative in
 Paris on 25 April, NCNA deleted the charge in his introductory
 remarks that the United States is creating an "extremely serious"
 situation '.n Indochina.  While muffling some of the anti-U.S.
 criticism, Peking has replayed comment on Moscow's relations with
 Phnom Penh that has accused the Soviets of attempting to sabotage
 the Cambodian struggle.
 PF?'OM PENH REORGANIZATION      In addition to Penn Nouth's
 reference in his reception speech,
 the recent formation of a four-man council in Phnom Penh has
 drawn critical attacks in FUNK and PRG media that have traced the
 development to U.S. pressure and to General Haig's trip.  A FUNK
 radio editorial on 24 April dwelled on the prospects of continuing
 dissension in Phnori Penh and called for uprisings to "trample and
 bury the group of traitors Lon Nol, Sirik Matak, Son Ngoc Thanh,
 In Tam, Cheng Heng, and their clique forever."  A Liberation Radio
 broadcast or. 30 April derided the new council as a monster given
 birth by the United States.
 NCNA on 27 April carried an account of the reorganization that made
 no mention of the United States and pictured the moves as a
 desperate effort :)y Lon Nol to enlist his "political enemies" in
 a last-ditch struggle against the insurgents.  NCNA quoted an. AP
 report for the judgment that the reorganization will have little
 or no effect on the regime's "bleak prospects for survivai."
 Peking's cautious treatment of the Phnom Penh leadership situation
 was reflected in the omission of Penn Nouth's remarks on the matter
 from the account of the 25 April reception carried in NCNA's
 international service.

 CUBA
 CASTROIS MAY DAY SPEECH RESTATES FOREIGN POLICY POSITIONS
 In a May Day speech devoted mainly to Latin Ame?.ican regional
 affai s and generally devoid of inflammatory rhetoric, Cuban
 Premier ridel Castro restated established positions on relations
 with the United States and on trends in the hemisphere.
 Adamantly denying Western press reports that Cuba had
 softened its terms for restoration with relations with the
 United States, Castro insisted that the Cuban position had
 actually "hardened."  However, the Guantanamo issue was
 notably muted in his speech, and the "unconditional" lifting
 of the U.S. "economic blockade" and the cessation of U.S.
 efforts to act as a "gendarme" in Latin America were again
 cited as Havana's conditions for normalization of relations
 with Washington.  In his only reference to events outside
 the hemisphere, Castro praised the Vietnam settlement as a
 VietnnmPG? virtory impnaad on the United St:nte.c,
 On the issue of Guantanamo, which the Cuban premier had treated
 in notably truculent terms in his May Day speech last year,
 Castro said merely that the issue was overshadowed by Havana's
 concern over the "common problems" of Latin America..  It was
 in this context that he declared that such problems must
 take precedence over Guantanamo in any discussion between
 Cuba and the United States and that relations between the
 two countries could not improve "as long as the United States
 insisted on creating a gendarme power in Latin America."
 On trends in the hemisphere, Castro's remarks were marked by
 cautious optimism over the prospects for lessening U.S.
 influence and promoting the emergence of independent regimes.
 While reaffirming the socialist credentials of the Cuban
 revolution and inviting others to follow its lead, Castro
 welcomed the appearance in Chile, Peru, and Panama of
 independent though ideologically divergent governments
 which he characterized as having embarked on a "decisive
 new path."  Without minimizing the difficulties facing such
 regimes and others in Latin America seeking to defend their
 "national interests vis-a-vis Yankee imperialism," he spoke
 hopefully about developments in Argentina, where the Peronists
 had achieved a "popular-type victory" and an "important"
 political change.  Castro's acceptance of ideological diversity

 was also evidenced by his offer of support to the Venezuelan
 government in the event of a "serious conflict" over the
 nationalization of its oil resources.
 Castro restated the familiar Cuban positions on relations with
 the OAS.  Disavowing any Cuban desire to return to the OAS and
 pointing to signs of growing opposition to the United States in
 that body, he observed that the debate was no longer over Cuban
 readmission but over the very existence of the organization in
 its present form.  Calling for the formation of a new organiza-
 tion composed exclusively of Latin American countries and
 English-speaking Caribbean states, Castro declared:  "There is
 no reason for the United States to be a member of that regional
 organization."
 Castro reserved his sharpest criticism for developments in
 Brazil, where he alleged that the United States was attempting
 to establish an "imperialist enclave" for the purpose of
 suppressing the "liberation movement" in Latin America.  He
 also castigated the United States for "dumping its surplus
 capital" in Brazil and for developing a "capitalist model"
 for economic exploitation in Latin America.

 NOTES
 CHINA-PHILIPPINES:  A 29 April NCNA report on a visiting
 Philippine trade delegation, led by members of the Philippine
 Chamber of Commerce, represents Peking's first coverage of
 contacts with the Philippines since the declaration of martial
 law by the Marcos government last September.  The report said
 that the group was visiting China under the auspices of the
 China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, that it
 had attended the Canton trade fair, and that it had been feted
 at a banquet in Peking on 29 April hosted by a vice-chairman of
 the council and attended by representatives of the foreign trade
 and foreign affairs ministries.  There was no description of the
 atmosphere surrounding the visit.  While eschewing any inflam-
 matory propaganda, Peking had conveyed mild disapproval of the
 Marcos government's declaration of martial law in a lone NCNA
 report last September that replayed foreign press comment critical
 of Marcos and called attention to demonstrations against his
 regime.  Peking at that time also suspended its reporting of
 "friendly" exchanges in Sino-Philippine people's diplo.nacy.
 WATERGATE DLVLLGPi,::.Ni!~:  ieei.cher Moscow nor Peking has mentioned
 the White House staff resignations or President Nixon's 30 April
 address on the Watergate affair.  .?eking has been silent from
 the outset, and Moscow's earlier coverage was negligible.  The
 last monitored mention in Soviet media was on 29 April, when
 PRAVDA carried a TASS report on FBI Director Gray's resignation.
 Other communist media have show. less reticence.  Reports of
 the latest events have been moritored from all the. East European
 countries except Albania and Bulgaria. Some harsh comment has
 come from East Germany and Czechoslovakia in particular, playing
 up the involvement of top-level White House officials and reporting
 dissatisfaction in the United States over the President's handling
 of the affair.  By and large, however, East European media have
 treated the President's personal role in a gingerly fashion.
 Vietnamese communist media, by contrast, have cited Western
 sources to depict the President's national leadership role as
 "threatened."  Hanoi radio on 1 May cited the BBC in observing
 that "the future of some high-ranking officials, and probably
 that of President Nixon himself, seems to be at stake."  Havana
 has commented caustically and at length, with PRENSA LATINA
 saying on 1 May that the affair had by no means reached its
 culmination and that evidence implicating the President himself
 was likely to emerge.
