 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SIM4EY
 29 May 1958
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 FRANCE AND NORTH AFRICA
 De Gaulle's Position
 Although at midday on 29
 May, the question of De Gaulle's
 accession to power was not set-
 tled, it was already evident
 that, once in office, he would
 have to deal immediately with
 critical problems of internal
 security and North Africa.   He
 might subsequently be expected
 to concentrate on internal po-
 litical reforms and on increas-
 ing France's influence in the
 Western alliance.
 Elements of both the So-
 cialist and Communist parties
 have indicated an intention to
 go underground if a De Gaulle
 government comes to power, and
 it is possible that new anti-
 Gaullist demonstrations similar
 to the one of 28 May might pro-
 voke police intervention and
 precipitate violence.
 De Gaulle's long-range
 plans for Algeria will probably
 be too liberal to find easy ac-
 ceptance by right-wing extreme'
 ists.  As far as is known, he
 still favors an autonomous Al-
 gerian state which, along with
 Tunisia and Morocco, would be
 federally associated with France.
 Although he has said it is too
 late for any Algerian policy
 based on assimilation or inte-
 gration, the recent claims of
 success along this line by the
 Algerian Committee of Public
 Safety may lead him to revise
 his position on this issue.
 De Gaulle's reported de-
 mand that Parliament be sus-
 pended for one year while he
 oversees the drafting of a new
 constitution to strengthen the
 executive will run afoul of the
 present constitution.  Any
 formula devised to give De Gaulle
 the  premiership'   in a "legal"
 framework must involve some
 form of investiture Vote by the
 National Assembly and probably
 also the inclusion of a few
 prominent party leaders in his
 cabinet.   This, however, would
 involve his backing down some-
 what from his original position
 that his resumption of power
 must be unconditional.   More-
 over, it would give legal status
 to a parliamentary opposition
 to his regime and would permit
 the machinery of the political
 parties to continue to operate.
 Constitutional provisions also
 stipulate that the National As-
 sembly must convene in October
 and that the parliamentary vaca-
 tion cannot exceed five months
 per year.
 France under De Gaulle
 would probably remain a member
 of NATO --land possibly of-'the
 existing institutions for Euro-
 pean integration.   However, un-
 der a De Gaulle regime, Paris
 would put its greatest empha-
 sis on building up French na-     25X1
 tional strength and using it to 25X1
 push a policy bordering at times

 De Gaulle would not neces-
 sarily be hostile to Moscow and
 may even consider the possibil-
 ity of a French-Soviet "deal"
 to give Europe time to "rebuild
 strength."  He believes the
 USSR is not interested in making
 war, and he may seek to repair
 friendly relations with the So-
 viet Union.               De Gaulle also may
 be influenced by reported as-
 surances of Soviet Ambassador
 Vinogradov that Moscow prefers
 having France rather than the
 United States in North Africa.

 important victory by leaders'of
 the ruling junta in  Algeria.
 The extralegal all-Algeria Com-
 mittee of Public Safety indicated
 the following day, however, that
 only the return to power of De
 Gaulle would be ultimately ac-
 ceptable, and the army, which
 gives the impression of being
 in full control of local devel-
 opments, seems to be in full
 accord with this position.   Indi-
 cations are that plans for some
 sort of direct action, probably
 coordinated with military ele-
 ments in the metropole, are in
 readiness, and the chances for
 their early implementation will
 increase if De Gaulle is not
 actually installed in power soon
 on terms acceptable to
 the junta.
 The new Algerian
 leaders are continuing
 to promote displays
 of what is heralded
 as a "miraculous" rec-
 onciliation  between
 Moslems and Europeans
 in Algeria and to claim
 that the-42-month-old
 guerrilla war has been
 steadily diminishing
 since the events of
 13 May.   This line is
 aimed primarily at
 convincing the metro-
 pole that support of
 the new regime in Al-
 geria is the surest
 means of ending the
 war, but many local
 leaders profess to be-
 lieve that the recent
 show of strength and
 unity by the French
 has had a genuine
 "beneficial" influence
 on Algerian Moslems.
 In an effort to
 maximize this influ-
 ence, virtually all
 public speakers have
 been emphasizing the

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 29 May 19 58
 religious differences have been
 wiped out and that there now
 are only "Frenchmen" in Algeria.
 Led by Jacques Soustelle, who
 accepted membership  on  the
 three-man "coordinating council"
 created to "advise" General
 Salan, these speakers have gone
 on to demand full integration
 of Algeria with metropolitan
 France, and for the time being
 at least this program has gained
 complete ascendancy.
 Such a "solution" faces
 major obstacles, however, in-
 cluding the hostility its prac-
 tical implications are bound
 to arouse in the Metropole and,
 almost certainly,  the eventual
 opposition of European extrem-
 ists in Algeria, who are for
 the moment either going along
 with the tide or remaining si-
 lent.   In addition, the pro-
 gram's advocates are confronted
 with De Gaulle's own apparent
 inclination toward some type
 of federal relationship for Al-
 geria.   Nevertheless, the Amer-
 ican consul general in Algiers
 doubts that even De Gaulle could
 at present overcome the local
 pressures favoring an ambitious
 French Algerian policy.
 It is still most unlikely
 that participation by Moslems
 in  rallies hailing the "new
 French Algeria" really reflects
 their desire to be "Frenchmen."
 In any event,  the junta's at-
 tempt to woo Moslems has made
 no perceptible dent in the de-
 termination of the Algerian Na-
 tional Liberation; Front (FLN)
 to fight on for independence.
 A high-level FLN spokesman in
 Tunis recently insisted there
 has been no "rallying" to the
 French by rebel fighters, and
 this was confirmed by a 27 May
 statement by Salan in which he
 reiterated his earlier offer of
 a "pardon" to rebels who would
 surrender with their weapons.
 Rebel spokesmen have also
 stated categorically that the
 rebels would have nothing to do
 with the Salan junta but would
 deal only with a French govern-
 ment having "real authority"
 and one willing to accept Al-
 gerian independence.  At least
 some elements within the FLN
 are apparently hopeful that a
 De Gaulle - led regime will make
 the adjustments necessary for
 an accommodation acceptable to
 the FLN, but these hopes are
 undoubtedly tempered by distrust
 of many of the forces and per-
 sonalities who are bringing the
 general to power.
 Tunisia
 In Tunisia, where clashes
 between Tunisian and French mil-
 itary units occurred at Gafsa
 on 22 May and at Remada on 24-
 25 May, the government, assisted
 by   the Neo-Destour  party, is
 taking precautions  against a
 feared French military attempt
 to reoccupy the country, but is
 faced with an acute shortage of
 ammunition.   Armed civilians
 under the  direction  of the
 Tunisian Army and police,report-
 edly assisted by Algerian rebel
 units, have taken up defensive
 positions at roadblocks, par-
 ticularly surrounding French
 bases in the central and southern
 partsocf the country.  All Tuni-
 sians                                                        who  have  served with
 the French Army are  being
 recalled.

 CURRENT 'INTELLLGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 29 May 19 58
 The Neo-Destour is chan-
 neling popular anti-French
 agitation into well-policed and
 generally orderly popular demon-
 strations.   The most serious
 incident has been the desecra-
 tion of a French flag which  as
 torn from  French gendarmerie
 headquarters in Tunis.
 The Tunisian Government on
 26 May rejected,an offer of the
 French Government for a partial
 evacuation of French troops from
 Tunisia, and demanded instead
 that a firm timetable be drawn
 up for the evacuation of all
 9,000 French troops outside the
 base at Bizerte when a timetable
 is agreed to.   This offer,   in
 the opinion of American Ambas-
 sador Jones, is a favorable new
 development in French-Tunisian
 relations.
 President Bourguiba an-
 nounced on 26 May his decision
 to return to the Security Coun-
 cil, and his delegation at the
 UN may soon ask for a Security
 Council meeting to present Tu-
 nisia's complaints against
 France.   The delegation is be-
 ing reinforced by Ahmed Mestiri,
 Bourguiba's tough-minded secre-
 tary of state for justice, and
 Ahmed Tlili, leader of the
 most important labor union, who
 has good contacts in Western
 Europe and the United States.
 For the time being,   however,
 Tunis is still trying to avoid
 a showdown in order not to em-
 barrass the United States and
 Britain.
 Bouguiba, however, is em-
 bitter6d by the refusal of the
 United'States and Britain to
 fulfill his request for immedi-'
 ate shipment of arms.   He is re-
 ported to believe that the United
 States is overly concerned about
 the dangers of provoking the re-
 gime in Algiers and is not giv-
 ing him the public backing he
 needs and.deserves.   On 27 May
 when he addressed a crowd of
 100,000 clamoring for arms, he
 pointedly refrained from calling
 for support from  the  United
 States or the free world and ex-
 pressed confidence that Tunisia
 would "win, if necessary, alone."
 Morocco
 The Moroccan Government is
 also fearful of French aggres-
 sion and is rushing military
 and civilian reinforcements to
 the Algerian border.   The gov-
 ernment has committed itself to
 "complete and total solidarity"
 with Tunisia and on 26  May
 reiterated its  earlier  demands

 Efforts to find a politi-
 cal basis for settling the fight-
 ing in Lebanon have failed. Even
 Prime Minister Suhl's public
 declaration on 27 May that the
 cabinet would not try to change
 the constitution to enable
 President Chamoun to seek a sec-
 ond term has  apparently  not
 moved opposition leaders toward
 compromise.   Earlier in the week,
 some moderate opposition leaders
 abandoned attempts to seek a com-
 promise, under which Chamoun would
 have been permitted to serve un-
 til the end of his term in Sep-
 tember, and joined the extreme
 opposition in demanding Chamoun's

 immediate resignation.   The po-
 litical maneuvering, therefore,
 has resulted in a major setback
 to the government in that Chamoun
 has been virtually compelled to
 renounce his ambition to suc-
 ceed himself as president.   The
 opposition, with growing UAR
 support, stands firm.
 The UN Security Council
 has decided to postpone consid-
 eration of the Lebanese com-
 plaint against UAR interference
 until 3 June, in order to permit
 the Arab League, meeting in
 Tripoli, Libya, on 21 May, to
 attempt to reach a solution.
 Lebanese government lead-
 ers, meanwhile, are increasingly
 pessimistic over the ability of
 the security forces of 13,000
 to 14,000 men to maintain order
 against an estimated 8,000 armed
 rebels, assisted by the UAR.
 The rebels now virtually control
 the countryside.   A major factor
 in the deterioration in the gov-
 ernment's position is the ap-
 parent unwillingness
 of army commander
 General Shihab to
 risk alienating re-
 bellious opposition
 leaders by attempting
 vigorous  action
 against rebel forces.
 Despite the third
 week of violence,the
 government had not,
 as of.28 May, pro-
 claimed a state of
 emergency.   Army re-
 luctance to move
 forcefully reflects
 the contention of
 General Shihab that
 such a move might
 cause the conflict
 to degenerate into a
 Moslem-Christian strug-
 gle.
 UAR assistance
 to the rebels con-
 CRY
 tinues in the form of major
 logistical and propaganda sup-
 port and some personnel rein-
 forcements.   A Cairo press re-
 port heralding formation of a
 "popular government" in South
 ern Lebanon, whence forces would
 march on Beirut, may indicate
 that Cairo is attempting to
 unite antigovernment elements
 for more intensive attacks
 against the government.   Severe
 attacks against the Chamoun gov-
 ernment in the Cairo and Damascus
 press have also blasted the
 United States.
 Syrian press reports that
 "volunteers" had petitioned
 Interior Minister Sarraj for
 permission to "fight alongside
 the Lebanese people" against
 the Chamoun government and out-
 side intervention could prepare
 the ground for more open UAR
 participation in Lebanon's
 civil war, or be used in the
 UN Security .Council to refute
 Lebanon's, charges of official
 UAR intervention.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 29 May 19 58
 The manifest UAR interven-
 tion in Lebanon has raised fear
 in other pro-Western Arab states
 as to who will be next.   Suda-
 nese officials have expressed
 concern that UAR success in Leb-
 anon would be followed by                   new
 moves against the Khalil govern-
 ment.   Leaders of Jordan, which
 is now beset by a new UAR-sup-
 ported ultranationalist conspiracy
 among army and political offi-
 cials, are deeply worried.
 Djakarta's  military  cam-
 paign  against  the  North
 Celebes dissidents continues
 with operations to isolate the
 dissident capital of Menado.
 Lt. Col. Jusuf, tactical com-
 mander for the Menado assault,
 states that both paratroops and
 amphibious forces will be used
 and that small marine detach-
 ments and intelligence agents
 have already infiltrated the
 area to prepare for the land-
 ings.   Djakarta forces occupied
 the Sangihe and Talaud island
 groups north of Celebes on 25
 May, and the government claims
 all dissident forces on the is-
 land of Morotai have surrendered-.
 The dissidents apparently are
 continuing  to resist, however,
 in the Djailolo,   Palu,   and
 Gorontalo areas.
 In Central Sumatra, Dja-
 karta administrators are en-
 countering the problems of oc-
 cupation and  reconstruction.
 Principal problems are passive
 resistance to central government
 officials and a lack of school-
 teachers and civil  servants,
 who either fled or were intimi-
 dated by the dissidents. Colonel

 Jani, the military administrator
 for the area, told the American
 assistant army attache trouble

 29 May 1958
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS
 The second session of the
 Chinese Communist party's eighth
 congress, meeting from 5 to 23
 May, reaffirmed hard lines in
 domestic and foreign policy
 which have been developing
 since last fall.   Mao Tse-tung
 apparently continues to domi-
 nate the party.   Liu Shao-chi
 and Teng Hsiao-ping seem to
 have improved their chances to
 capture control of the party
 when Mao dies or retires.
 They are regarded as the lead-
 ing figures of an "organization-
 al" group among Mao's lieuten-
 ants,           so named because of its
 members' roles in directing
 the key organs of the party,
 as distinguished from the
 state.
 Major Speeches
 The most important report,
 summarizing the party's situa-
 tion, general line, and tasks,
 was made by Liu Shao-chi.   The
 other two major reports were
 given by Teng Hsiao-ping, on
 intrabloc relations, and by
 Teng's deputj. ?Tan' Chen-lin, on
 agriculturaldevelopment.    Mao
 himself did not make a major
 report, apparently limiting his
 role to setting the tone for
 the congress.   However, the
 speakers credited Mao person-
 ally with originating the main
 policies which are to guide the
 regime for the next year, poli-
 cies with which "organizational"
 figures have been. particularly
 closely identified.
 In reviewing the _:ifiter-
 national situation, Liu and
 Teng emphasized.Peiping'e close
 ties with Moscow.  The congress
 reiterated the Chinese condem-
 nation of the Yugoslav party
 program, and its resolution ex-
 ceeded in harshness Peiping's
 5 May blast at Tito.   It charged
 Belgrade with the role of "pro-
 vocateur and interventionist"
 in Hungary.   In language reminis-
 cent of the 1948 Cominform reso-
 lution expelling Yugoslavia,
 Peiping declared that Yugoslav
 leaders have "alienated them-
 selves" from the international
 Communist movement.
 In summing up domestic ac-
 complishments, Liu expressed
 satisfaction with party work
 since the last congress, espe-
 cially the party's major effort
 of the past year to cleanse its
 ranks through "rectification."
 He warned that the party must
 be prepared to wage prolonged
 and repeated struggles against
 "rightists" throughout the
 period of "transition to social-
 ism."  The congress rebuked as.
 "rightists," and may drop,
 three alternate members of the
 central committee.
 Industry and Agriculture
 The congress reaffirmed
 the leadership's forced-draft
 program for economic development.
 Various party policies are con-
 solidated in a "general line
 for socialist construction,"
 under the slogan of "utmost
 effort" to achieve "greater,
 faster, better, and more eco-
 nomicAl" results.   The line
 urges the "simultaneous devel-
 opment of industry and agri-
 culture while giving priority
 to heavy industry," and, within
 certain limits, the "simul'taneous
 development of national and local
 industries, and of large, medium,
 and small enterprises."  Liu
 Shao-chi's vigorous defense of
 the program and the congress'
 appeal to close ranks and work
 for it with "one mind and one
 heart" suggest the existence

 of continuing opposition in the
 party.
 Tan Chen-lin, who in the
 past year has displaced Teng
 Tzu-hui as the party's leading
 spokesman on agriculture, ex-
 plained to the congress the
 second revised draft--as yet
 unpublished--of 'the national
 program for agricultural de-
 velopment.   The congress ap-
 proved the revised program "in
 principle," instructing the
 central committee to make any
 necessary changes.   The new
 revision takes into considera-
 tion the greatly increased em-
 phasis given agriculture and
 industries supporting agricul-
 ture since last fall.   The re-
 vised program remains an ambi-
 tious one.   Tan did introduce
 a cautious note, however, in
 warning of the dangers of work-
 ing only for "flashy results."
 Personnel Changes
 Like the other proceedings
 of the congress, new appoint-
 ments to the party politburo
 show the increasing strength of
 the "organizational" group.
 Ko Ching-shih, the party boss
 in East China, has been close
 to.both Liu Shao-chi and Teng
 Hsiao-ping in recent years.
 Tan Chen-lin of the secretariat
 has been closely associated with
 Teng for at least the past three
 years.   Li Ching-chuan, who made
 an unprecedented jump directly
 to the politburo from a provin-
 cial party post, was one of
 Teng's top lieutenants when Teng
 was party boss of the
 Southwest before 1952.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 The politburo as
 a voting body will
 probably continue to
 be responsive to Mao,
 even if "organizational"
 figures should choose
 to stand together in
 opposition to Mao on
 an important issue.
 However, the "organi-
 zational" group seems
 now markedly stronger
 in the politburo than
 another group which
 has been regarded as
 responsive to Chou
 En-lai.
 The One other
 change in the polit-
 buro was the designa-
 tion of Lin Piao as a
 new vice chairman of
 the central committee
 and politburo and as
 a new member of the
 politburo's standing
 committee.   Lin was
 once Mao's favorite
 military leader, but
 for the past six years
 has been seriously ill.

 at least three line divisions,
 or about 50,000 Soviet troops,
 twice the number stationed there
 before the uprising.   There are
 still 35,000 soviet troops in
 Poland and over 350,000 in East
 Germany.   The Warsaw Pact Comte
 mittee'also.announced that the
 forces of all Eastern European
 satellite countries e,dept Hun-
 gary and East Germany would be
 out.  The total reduction would
 be 119,000, which would leave
 the ' er-all strength of the
 Eastern European satellite
 forces at about one million men.
 The announced withdrawals
 and reductions, together with
 the renewal of a fionag ression
 treaty offer to the NANO coun-
 tries, seem intended to Make
 the Soviet stand on the entire
 range of disarmament issues
 appeal more credible during
 presummit talks, as well as
 to reinforce the tSSR's refusal
 to discuss the satellites at a
 summit conference.  Another pur-
 pose is to make NANO defense
 measures appear less urgent.
 These steps were accompanied,
 however, by $hrushchev's warn-
 ing in a speech to the meeting
 that, should missile sites be
 established in Western Europe,
 the Warsaw Pact countries "would
 be forced...to examine the
 question" of establishing mis-
 sile bases in last Germany,
 Poland, and Czechoslovakia.
 The USSR took the occasion
 to ieiterate its demand for par-
 ity at the summit and to attempt
 to enhance the satellites'
 claims for participation.   Cor-
 responding to the Western pow-
 ers' suggestion that Italy be
 included in the talks, the War-
 saw Pact countries proposed that,
 in addition to the USSR, two or
 three Communist states--Poland,
 Czechoslovakia, and possibly
 Rumania--be represented.

 economic boycott, however, is

 sion regarding $90,000,000 in
 Polish and Czech credit--Bel-
 grade's other bloc creditors--
 has been announced.   Unofficial
 reports from Belgrade suggest
 that the Yugoslavs are not
 optimistic regarding their fu-
 ture bloc.economic ties.
 Any other decisions on Yu-
 goslavia reached probably will
 be mirrored in more propaganda
 attacks and other coordinated
 bloc actions concerning Bel-
 grade.
 WARSAW PACT ARMED FORCES
 While some of the East
 European satellite armed forces
 have greatly improved their com-
 bat capability in the three
 years since the inception of
 the Warsaw Pact,  there has ap-
 parently been no concerted ef-
 fort to make them an integrated
 and vital adjunct to the Soviet
 forces, with the possible ex-
 ception of air defense.   The
 recent meeting of the Political
 Consultative Committee of the
 Warsaw Pact probably discussed
 this question.
 There have been some large-
 scale combined maneuvers and
 command-post exercises involv-
 ing both satellite and Soviet
 forces in the past two years,
 but these have been infrequent
 and have never involved all the
 satellites.   A Soviet-Polish
 exercise was held recently in
 Poland.   Soviet, Czech, and
 East German units reportedly
 are planning to conduct a large-
 scale joint maneuver in East
 Germany, or possibly Czeehoslb-
 vakia.                       These same countries
 have engaged in ,dint training
 previously.
 In the satellite ground
 forces, alone, which are in,
 general well equipped ahd or-
 ganized, there are nearly a
 million men  and 63 line divi-
 sions.   These forces have re-
 mained relatively stable in the
 past few years with the excep-
 tion of those in Hungary, which
 were completely disorganized in
 1956, and the East German forces,
 which have been vastly improved.
 Since its organization in
 January 1956, the East German
 Army has undergone reorganiza-
 tion and greatly modernized its
 weapons and equipment.   In sev-
 eral major equipment categories,
 the army now has a decided ad-
 vantage over those of the other
 satellites.   Two mechanized di-
 visions have been converted into
 tank divisions and an antiair-
 craft artillery division has
 been formed.   In addition, the
 rifle divisions have been con-
 verted to "motorized rifle di-
 visions" by increasing the divi-
 sional armored support.
 Other satellites also have
 received new equipment from the
 USSR.   A significant number of
 T-54 medium tanks, which have
 been replacing the T-34's in
 Soviet units since 1954, were
 issued to Polish units in 1957.
 The East German, Czech, and prob-
 ably Bulgarian forces also have
 these tanks.   Major items of
 heavy equipment believed to have
 been stored during the 1956 up-
 risings have been observed re-
 cently in the hands of Hungarian
 troops.   Judging by the type of
 equipment involved, it appears
 that efforts are being made to
 re-establish an effective army
 in Hungary which will probably
 consist of from six to nine line
 divisions but without a signifi-
 cant combat capability until at
 least the fall of 1959.

 about Suslov's present role in
 the Soviet leadership,   He was

 last November in Moscow and by
 the fact that he reported on
 the results of the meetings to

 failure to appear at the re.

 not only economic '.special--'.

 also high party officials, has
 caused the Polish Communists

 had been dropped as a candidate
 member of the party presidium,

 party post.   In mid-April,
 when the Komsomol congress
 elected the entire party pre-
 sidium as honorary delegates
 to the congress, Pervukhin was
 included on the list.   He was
 also listed along with party
 presidium members attending
 dinners given on 22 May in
 honor of Finnish President Kek-

 of bloc delegates to the CEMA
 and Warsaw Pact conferences.
 In addition to Khrushchev,
 party presidium members who
 have been in the forefront late-
 ly are A. I. Mikoyan, F. R.
 Kozlov, and A. I. Kirichenko.
 These four were the party pre-
 sidium members on the Soviet
 delegation to the conference
 of CEMA  representatives.
 SOVIET ATTITUDE TOWARD DE GAULLE
 The caution in the recent
 Soviet propaganda treatment of
 De Gaulle suggests that Moscow
 does not want to handicap any
 future relations with him and
 believes it can benefit from
 some of his nationalistic poli-
 cies.   The remarks of Soviet
 diplomats in Paris before the
 present crisis began suggested
 that the USSR expected that a
 De Gaulle government would be
 a disruptive force in NATO and
 might seek closer. relations
 with the USSR.   On the other
 hand, Moscow may foresee a
 greater possibility under a De
 Gaulle government for the type
 of settlement in Algeria that
 would weaken the chances for
 expanding Communist influence
 in North Africa.
 While Moscow may consider
 that   A  De  Gaulle government
 would be a net gain to the USSR
 in the foreign policy area, it
 is also alert to the possibility
 that united action by the Com-
 munist and                      Socialist  parties
 against De Gaulle might lead
 to a popular front government.
 The USSR probably does not
 anticipate    violent revolution-
 ary activity  leading to a
 Communist seizure of power but
 rather united political action
 by the parties of the left that
 would eventually give the Com-
 munists an influence on French
 foreign policy.   Since present
 Soviet tactics for world Com-
 munism place a high premium on
 Communist cooperation with other
 leftist parties, the prolonged
 isolation of the French Commu-
 nist party has been a source
 of concern to the Soviet lead-
 ership.   The USSR is probably
 uncertain, however, about
 whether De Gaulle would seek
 to establish a dictatorship
 and would suppress the Commu-
 nist party,.
 Soviet propaganda has en-
 dorsed French Communist efforts
 to unite the parties of the left
 and has publicized the Commu-
 nist criticisms of De Gaulle.
 While French Communist attacks
 on De Gaulle have intensified
 and have included the claim
 that the USSR opposes him, Mos-
 cow has restrained its own com-
 mentary on De Gaulle and has
 centered its criticism on the
 military leadership in Algeria.
 Both Soviet and French Commu-
 nist propaganda launched at-
 tacks on the Pflimlin govern-
 ment for its  "compromises"
 and  "capitulation."

 DECENTRALIZATION IN THE NORTHERN SATELLII'SS
 Economic administrations
 are being rapidly decentralized
 in Czechoslovakia, East Germany,
 and Poland, the most highly in-
 dustrialized satellites.   The
 reorganization is designed to
 increase industrial production
 and decrease costs by establish-
 ing more efficient operating
 procedures, while eliminating
 many administrative posts and
 assigning most of the incum-
 bents to production tasks.
 Another aim of the program is
 to curtail the power of the eco-
 nomic  : ministries, which, much
 reduced in size, are to be con-
 cerned mainly with long-range
 planning and bloc coordination.
 The recent elimination, of
 the Polish central  boards--
 transmission belts of authority
 from the ministries to the basic
 enterprises--means that now in
 all three countries, associa-
 tions of enterprises will have
 the operational authority. These
 associations, grouped according
 to a particular type of produc-
 tion, will have responsibility
 for short-term planning, approval
 of investments,and settlement
 of accounts that were formerly
 the responsibility of the min-
 istries.   Other powers formerly
 exercised t?y economic ministries
 are to be. vested in the local
 government councils and in the
 managers of enterprises, who are
 to have more authority.over the
 disposition of investments and
 profits.
 As economic structures are
 being reshaped, the solution of,
 concomitant personnel, problems
 -is proving difficult. "Large
 numbers of administrative per-
 sopnel are being shifted from
 the capitals to work in district
 administrations or in industry.
 Zn.;Czechoslovakia, the number
 of persons so affected ranges
 from 40,000 to 100,000.   Many
 of these-workers refuse to seek
 .manual labor and the  result
 is  a  considerable  group  of
 unemployed,.,   discontented
 people in Prague.
 East Germany seems to be
 having the most trouble with
 its decentralization, partly be-
 cause it is being pushed too
 fast and partly because here,
 unlike Czechoslovakia and Poland,
 the economic ministries are be-
 ing entirely eliminated and:re-
 placed by a state planning com-
 mission.   Further, the vagueness
 of operational directives is
 confounding district officials..
 As in Prague, many party mem-
 bers slated to leave Berlin for
 assignments in the districts
 are resisting the move.
 While Poland's actual ad-
 ministrative reorganization'is
 similar to that of Czechoslovakia
 and East Germany, it is part of
 a larger program to put Polish
 industry on a basis of ;"'profit-
 ability," exemplified by a cam-
 paign to last until 1960 which
 has eliminated 150,000 industrial.
 and administrative workers to
 date.   Next year, as a part of
 this wider economic program, the
 Polish price structure is to. be
 revised as called for by the
 "new economic model."
 The success of the economic
 decentralization is far from
 assured.   Power may~have a ten-..
 dency to shift back to top lev-
 els--the ministries or the
 equivalent state planning .com-
 mission--with.a consequent growth
 of red tape to encumber the pro
 cedures.of procurement, account-
 ing, planning, and. marketing.
 The additional authority of'the
 plant  managers  over  plans,
 profits, and investments may
 lead to conflicts with the party
 representatives, since these lat-
 ter are rarely able to deal with
 economic. problems from a stand-
 point that is solely economic.
 Workers stand to,benefit only if
 they work harder to increase plant
 profits .                        (Pre-  .     25X1

 THE BULGARIAN PARTY ON THE EVE OF ITS, SEVENTH PARTY CONGRESS
 The Bulgarian Communist
 party will convene its seventh
 congress on 2 June in an atmos-
 phere of success and self-
 assurance.  The doctrinaire rul-
 ing triumvirate of party First  '
 Secretary Zhivkov, Premier Yugov,
 and politburo member Vulko
 Chervenkov--Bulgaria's "little
 Stalin"---is no longer under
 pressure to liberalize, and
 its'.:  undeviating "Stalinist"
 approach can be shown to have
 paid off in almost complete
 collectivization and undisputed
 control of the country.
 . The Bulgarian regime also
 ? finds itself in a strong posi-
 tion as far as the renewed
 Soviet-Yugoslav dispute is
 concerned.   Since Bulgaria did
 not establish close relations
 with Yugoslavia during the pe-
 riod When reconciliation with
 Belgrade was in vogue and did
 not set out on its own "road
 to socialism," it will be well
 equipped at its party's congress
 to denounce the Yugoslav "revi-
 sionist heresies" and present
 the Moscow-approved line on
 satellite behavior.   Zhivkov,
 who will report at the congress
 on the activities of the party
 since its sixth congress in 1954,
 will probably deliver the author-
 itative statement on this ques-r
 tios.
 The current Soviet-.Yugoslav
 split and MMcpscow'ss renewed ap-.
 proval of more "orthodox" lines
 of internal policy for the sat-
 ellites make unlikely any sig-
 nificant changes in the Bulgarian
 leadership at the congress.
 Although Chervenkov was demoted
 during Bulgaria's limited thaw,.
 he was replaced by like-minded

 Yugov, while still the
 second most important figure in
 the regime, is said to have
 slipped somewhat because of his
 half-hearted support of the
 Bulgarian party shake-up last
 July.  What little party fac-
 tionalism exists appears to
 stem from dissatisfaction with
 relative power positions rather
 than policy differences, and
 even this has reportedly been
 minimal since'.the July ouster
 of politburo member Georgi
 Chankov.
 Another member of the Bul-
 garian party, party secretary
 and politburo member Dimiter
 Ganev, also appears to have
 risen to top leadership stature
 in the past year,;.supposedly
 with Chervenkov's backing.  Al-
 though there are rumors in Sofia
 that Ganev is attempting to
 replace Zhivkov, evidence does
 not support these rumors at
 this time.
 As a precautionary measure,
 before the congress the Bul-
 garian party at Zhivkov's
 instigation reportedly expelled
 from its ranks last month up to
 30 Kostovites-.-the group ousted
 for Titoism in 1949-50.   These
 individuals, who were rehabil-
 itated in the spring of 1956
 but not readmitted to the top
 party leadership, reportedly
 have been dissatisfied with both
 their positions and the compen-
 sation paid for their years in
 prison.  Although ousted from
 the party, the 30 Kostovites
 have not as yet been removed
 from their jobs or arrested.
 The Bulgarian Army also is
 a cause of some concern to the
 regime.   Some of its leaders
 were readmitted to the central
 committee at the party's sixth
 congress in 1954 after removal
 or arrest in connection with
 the Kostov affair in 1949-50.
 If any of these rehabilitated
 officers have exhibited reluc-
 tance'to go along with the cur
 rent line, which has turned away
 from "liberalization," they may
 be again removed from their jobs.
 Such a process may already have
 begun in the reshuffle of the
 party leadership in July 1957,
 with the removal of central
 committee members Dobri Terpeshev
 and Yonko Panov.

 BRAZILIAN.- SOVIET BLOC TRADE
 Brazil's three-year barter
 agreement  with Poland,   in-
 volving the exchange of coffee
 and other bulk commodities for
 14 merchant ships worth about
 $25,000,000, reflects its con-
 tinuing                     dollar crisis,   its
 growing coffee surplus, and
 its desire to offset the al-
 most inevitable cutbacks in
 dollar and sterling expenditures
 for the government's economic
 development plan.   The Polish
 deal and a reported Czech deal
 involving $12,000,000 worth of
 coffee for agricultural equip-
 ment  probably  foreshadow
 other barter deals with the So-
 viet bloc, even though they do
 not point to any fundamental
 change in Brazil's preference
 for trading within Western
 multilateral arrangements.
 In early May, Brazil's dol-
 lar balances reached the  zero
 mark and continued imports were
 possible only through emergency
 loans from private banks in the
 United States.   Brazil has been
 negotiating with the Interna-
 tional Monetary Fund (IMF) for
 a second drawing but  has in-
 sisted that the reforms asked
 by the IMF will be politically
 infeasible without substantial
 additional US loans and credits.
 Coffee, which normally pro-
 vides up to 80 percent of $ra-
 zil's dollars and 70 percent-of
 total foreign exchange--between
 $800,000,000 and $1 billion an-
 nually--has dropped about 15
 percent in price since last May,
 and Brazil's sales  were  off
 about one half in the first
 quarter of 1958.   World-wide
 overproduction, resulting from
 increased plantings in 1954,
 is expected to continue for
 several years.  A continued
 weakness in the market would
 almost certainly stimulate the
 already serious  nationalist
 campaign against the  United
 States, whose commodity markets
 determine world coffee prices.
 Brazil has trade agree-
 ments with Poland, Hungary, and
 Czechoslovakia, its principal
 trading partners in the bloc.
 Trade with the bloc declined
 some 10 percent in 1957 to a
 level of $76,400,000, but is
 likely to increase in the next
 few years, partly as a result
 of Polish credits already ad-
 vanced during 1957.
 Most Brazilian officials
 see the possibilities of bloc
 trade, however, as limited not
 only by the rigid bilateralism
 of bloc commercial arrangements
 but also by the lack of a broad
 market there for coffee.   They
 fear that large sales of coffee
 to any bloc country would re-
 sult in resales in Brazil's
 usual Western markets.   While
 there has been considerable
 interest in bloc offers of
 heavy equipment, most top of-
 ficials are also fearful of
 large-scale transactions that
 would involve the presence of
 bloc technicians.

 Government officials have
 lately expressed growing anxiety
 over Egypt's intentions, and
 fear that if Nasir's venture

 December.   Mirza hopes to elimi-
 nate the influence of former
 Prime Minister Suhrawardy, who
 is the chief support of the
 present government and Mirza's
 one real rival for political
 supremacy.   The President,
 aware that his political and
 popular. support has diminished
 during the past year, apparent-
 ly intends to ensure his con-
 tinuance in office after the
 elections now scheduled for No-
 vember by maneuvering at this
 time for a new amenable coali-
 tion or, failing this, using
 the current instability as an
 excuse for assuming dictatorial
 rule.
 The forces which support
 the present government, and
 want to prevent any development
 which might delay the elections,
 are working strenuously to avert
 a realignment of the coalition.
 These politicians, helped by
 the court's agreement to hear
 Noon's petition, could make it
 difficult, if not impossible,
 for Mirza to line up a workable
 majority.   Their hand would be
 weakened, however, if the East
 Pakistan provincial government,
 headed by Suhrawardy's Awami
 League, fails to win the pro-
 vincial assembly's confidence
 in crucial sessions early in
 June, and makes it necessary
 for the central government to
 step in.   Both these circum-
 stances could increase the pros-
 pects of a take-over by Mirza.
 THE,BURMESE POLITICAL CRISIS
 On 5 June the Burmese Par-
 liament will choose between the
 leadership of Premier Nu and
 Deputy Premier Ba Swe.   This
 showdown vote will also mark
 the end of the Anti-Fascist
 People's Freedom League (AFPFL),
 which has led Burma since inde-
 pendence in 1948.   The new gov-
 ernment,. whether based on a
 single party with a slender
 parliamentary majority or on
 a coalition of minority parties,
 will probably be short-lived
 and unstable.
 U Nu is expected to call
 for new general elections im-
 mediately following the parlia-
 mentary vote regardless of its
 outcome.   The Communists and
 rightist extremists would be
 the major beneficiaries in such
 elections because former AFPFL
 voters will be divided.
 Civil strife, common to
 Burma in the past, has so far
 been contained.   All top po-
 litical contenders have signed
 pledges to refrain from violence.
 The army, still politically neu-
 tral, appears in firm control
 of the situation in Rangoon.
 Violence in rural districts,
 however, is already reported
 increasing.
 Deputy Premier Ba Swe,
 counting on two thirds of the
 current AFPFL parliamentary votes,
 claims he will obtain a clear
 majority in the 250-seat Chamber
 of Deputies.   However, his con-
 fidence appears to be decreasing
 as Nu's faction reports success
 in converting deputies previous-
 ly pledged to Ba Swe.   In addi-
 tion, the premier has the sup-
 port of the 46 to 49 votes of
 the Communist-dominated Nation-.

 JAPAN CONCERNED OVER CHINESE COMPETITION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
 Japanese government offi-
 cials and businessmen are be-
 coming seriously concerned over
 Chinese Communist competition
 in Southeast Asian markets and
 are seeking means to counter
 this trend.   Representatives of
 the generally depressed Japa-
 nese textile industry, which is
 hardest hit by competition from
 Peiping, have suggested that the
 United States, in order to block
 Communist penetration of the
 area, assist the Japanese with
 long-term,  low-interest credits
 toward purchases of American
 cotton, which would improve
 Japan's competitive position.
 The representatives believe
 that if they can obtain five-
 year credits on low-grade cot-
 ton at 2 percent interest, Ja-
 pan could regain a considerable
 portion of those Southeast Asian
 markets which have been lost
 to Communist China.
 Many Japanese who have be-
 lieved the China mainland could
 become the lucrative market of
 the prewar period are apparent-
 ly undergoing a gradual change
 in attitude.   They are begin-
 ning to realize that the Chi-
 nese economy may be a compet-
 ing rather than a Qomp;iementary
 one.
 There is particular concern
 about Chinese textile exports.
 According to Japanese estimates,
 Peiping's textile sales in four
 Southeast Asian countries in-
 creased from approximately 15,-
 000,000 square yards in 1954 to
 about 300, 000, 000 in 1957, with
 Indonesia the leading buyer.
 The major portion of this in-
 crease has been at the expense
 of Japanese industry.
 Early in 1958, the Chinese
 Communists were reported selling
 Japanese steel in Singapore at
 a price lower than Japan itself
 could offer.  While it is doubt-
 ful that Peiping can significant-
 ly increase its present small-
 scale sales of heavy industrial
 materials in Southeast Asia, the
 Japanese regard this as an ex-
 ample of Communist  willing-      25X1
 mess  to  allow  political
 considerations to outweigh eco-
 nomic factors.

 JAPANESE ELECTION STRENGTHENS PRIME MINISTER KISHI
 The return to power of        I in any election since 1949.
 Prime Minister Kishi's Liberal-
 Democratic party in the 22 May
 election for the lower house of
 the Japanese Diet should
 strengthen his control of the
 government and encourage him to
 continue cooperating with the
 United States.  Because of antip-
 athy aroused in Japan by Sino-
 Soviet efforts to influence the
 election, Kishi now may also
 be in a better position to re-
 sist pressures for political
 concessions to Communist China
 for the sake of trade.
 As a result of the party's
 and his own good showing, Kishi
 is in a stronger position to
 cope with Liberal-Democratic
 factionalism, despite the fact
 that factional strengths are
 relatively unchanged.   If Kishi
 is successful in bringing Hayato
 Ikeda, leader of the adherents
 of former Prime Min-
 ister Yoshida, into
 a cabinet or party
 post following con-
 vocation of the Diet
 on 10 June, the pros-
 pects for political
 stability will be
 enhanced.
 The expected
 addition of independ-
 ent conservatives to
 the ruling party will
 not give it the two-
 thirds majority nec-
 essary for a consti-
 tutional amendment,
 but Kishi  will  ha  in
 This could cause the party's
 right wing to demand that the
 party seek support from elements
 other than labor, which has been
 its mainstay to date.  The par-
 ty's failure to win more seats
 has aggravated the cleavage be-
 tween its right and left wings
 and increased criticism of party
 leaders.
 Communist China is probably
 disappointed in the election re-
 sults, but shows no inclination
 to alter the strategy it adopted
 in hopes of influencing the
 election.  Peiping apparently
 plans to continue its economic
 boycott and insistence on fly-
 ing its national flag over a
 projected trade mission in Japan.
 The Chinese claim Kishi must
 make the next move by abandoning
 his "hostile" attitude toward

 IMPLICATIONS OF THE ITALIAN ELECTIONS
 The center of gravity of
 Italian politics has shifted
 somewhat to the left as a re-
 sult of gains made by the non-
 Communist left and center par-
 ties and the sharp losses suf-
 fered by the right in the 25-
 26 May national elections.   Two
 interrelated problems now face
 Italian politicians--the for-
 mation of a government coali-
 tion led by the Christian Demo-
 crats, and renewed efforts to-
 ward reunification of the Nenni
 and the Saragat Socialists.
 The Christian Democrats,
 although increasing their seats
 in both houses, do not have a
 majority by themselves, and cam-
 paign developments are likely
 to make their former center
 coalition partners reluctant
 to join a Christian Dea,ocratf .
 led coalition.   With the Social
 Democrats committed to attempt
 reunification with the Nenni
 Socialists, and the Liberals

 ICELAND AND THE TERRITORIAL WATERS ISSUE
 After a prolonged dispute
 between the Social Democratic
 and Communist-front Labor Al-

 Iceland's tripartite coalition
 government has decided to delay
 until 30 June the issuance of
 regulations extending the "fish-
 eries conservation
 limits" to 12 miles.
 The decree will be-
 come effective
 September.
 The Communists
 had demanded an im-
 mediate and unquali-

 the present four-mile
 limit, but the Social
 Democrats  had  in-
 sisted that the an-
 nouncement and the
 effective date Should
 allow a period  for
 Iceland to adjust
 differences with its
 NATO allies, particu-
 larly Britain.                   The
 Communists threatened
 to resign on 19 May but appar-
 ently neither they nor the other
 parties want general elections
 at this time, fearing these
 would only strengthen the al-
 ready powerful opposition Con-
 servative party.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 FRANCE AND ALGERIAN OIL
 The opening up of petroleum
 resources in the Sahara in re-
 cent years has enhanced the eco-
 nomic value of Algeria to France
 and encouraged ardent national-
 ists in the belief that Algerian
 oil can assure France great-
 power status. Explorations to
 date indicate very extensive
 deposits, but their exploitation
 is both costly and difficult.
 Successive governments have
 pushed an ambitious oil develop-
 ment program in Algeria despite.
 the financial strain on France's
 economy, and small investors
 have responded enthusiastically.

 future of the Saharan oil devel-
 opment program in particular--
 estimates that tend to under-
 play the cost of developing and
 protecting these resources.
 Oil and French Nationalism
 For many Frenchmen, the
 oil of southern Algeria has had
 greater political than economic
 importance, generating a new
 confidence in France's place
 in the.world.   The shutting off
 of.Middle Eastern oil during
 the Suez crisis was a political
 humiliation to French national-
 ists because it emphasized the
 extent to which the postwar
 economy had become dependent
 on day-to-day supplies from
 countries over which France
 could exercise little control.
 The experience stimulated a de-
 termination to make France as
 independent as possible of for-
 eign sources of basic energy
 and provided a sympathetic audi-
 ence for such predictions as
 the statement that Saharan oil
 could make the French Union
 self-sufficient in petroleum
 by 1972.
 The best expressions of
 the new attitude occurred at
 the 13 January ceremony cele-
 brating the arrival of the first
 oil train at Philippeville on
 the Algerian coast when Max
 Lejeune, then minister for the
 Sahara, said:   "In a few years
 France...will have her own in-
 dependent fuel supply.   France
 will become, after the United
 States and the Soviet Union,
 the third greatest world power
 in terms of energy.   We plan to
 attain the goal and nothing will
 keep us from it."   More recent-
 ly, General de Gaulle, in his
 19 May press conference,- re-
 ferred to the oil discoveries
 as "a card in France's hand."
 Although it is still too
 early to estimate the total
 probable Algerian oil reserves,
 there is little doubt that the
 area is a major oil province.
 In only two years, French com-
 panies have brought in four
 major fields'.
 The first major Algerian
 discovery was at Hassi Messaoud
 in late 1956.   The field was
 producing a token 6,300 barrels,
 a day during March 1958.   The
 field, which is not yet fully
 defined, has proved reserves
 of about 800,000,000 barrels,
 but this figure may reach into
 the billions when exploratory
 work is completed.   Even with
 this conservative reserve esti-
 mate, Hassi Messaoud has about
 five times the crude reserves
 of France itself.
 As is the case with other
 Algerian fields, the major prob-
 lem is transportation.   Pres-
 ently, the Hassi Messaoud oil
 moves through 100 miles of 6-
 inch pipe to a railhead at Toug-
 gourt, from where it is moved
 about 275 miles to the coast
 by tank car.   Work has started
 on a 24-.inch line from Hassi
 Messaoud to the coastal town of
 Bougie, a project which it is
 estimated will cost more than
 $100,000,000 and be finished
 probably by the end of next year.
 The completed line is designed
 to carry initially about 100,-
 000 barrels daily, although its
 ultimate capacity will be over
 300,000 barrels a day.
 The other three Algerian
 fields are located in the east-
 ern Sahara near the Libyan bor-
 der.   Together these three may
 exceed Hassi Messaoud's present
 proved reserves by a considera-
 ble margin.   The Edjele field,
 which has been fairly well de-
 fined, is about 18 riles long
 and 2.5 miles wide.   Its recover-
 able reserves are conservatively
 estimated at about 375,000,000
 barrels.
 Tiguentourine and Zarzaitine
 have not been sufficiently ex-
 ploited to determine their ulti-
 mate size, although the French
 claim that Zarzaitine could very

 well exceed Edjele. These fields
 have crude of excellent quality,
 but extensive and costly pipe-
 lines will be needed before any
 of the three is brought into
 production.
 Marketing Algerian crude
 is more of a political than a
 technical problem.   Ideally, a
 pipeline should be constructed
 linking Hassi Messaoud, Tiguen-
 tourine,  Zarzaitine, and Edjele
 to the Mediterranean by way of
 Tunisia or Libya.   This route
 has several advantages, not the
 least of which is that it is
 about 200 miles shorter than a
 route confined to Algerian ter-
 ritory.   For political reasons,
 however, the French have appar-
 ently considered linking the
 eastern Saharan fields by a
 375-mile pipeline to Hassi Mes-
 saoud in order to bypass any
 foreign territory.
 France's Financing Problems
 The cost of the Saharan
 oil development program puts a
 severe strain on France, which
 has for some time been overcom-
 mitted financially.   In 1957
 ,.alone, over $50,000,000 was
 spent on exploration and drill-
 ing in the Algerian Sahara, and
 total expenditures since the
 first rights were granted in
 1952 amount to $127,200,000.
 Expenditures planned for 1958
 amount to $176,000,000, roughly
 half for exploration and half
 for pipeline construction and
 other transportation facilities.
 Under these circumstances, Paris
 has shown a willingness to bring
 in both foreign and  private
 French investors to help carry
 the burden.
 Funds for exploration and
 development of the Saharan oil
 fields have come largely from
 public sources--about 65 per-
 cent in 1957 and 70 Percent in
 1956.   These-funds have been
 supervised by the Bureau of
 Petroleum Research "(BRP), a
 special branch under the Mints-
 try, of Interior.   The BRP ini-
 SECRET
 ART
 tially licensed seven companies
 --in most of which the French
 Government holds important in-
 terests--to undertake explora-
 tions.   Subsequently, concession
 areas have been opened to bids
 by other companies.' Government
 contributions were required not
 only to improve transportation
 and other facilities in the Sa-
 hara, but also to provide the
 partially government-owned op-
 erating companies with addition-
 al capital for development pur-
 poses.
 Foreign participation has
 been subject to certaih restric-
 tions, such as insistence on at
 least a 51-percent French in-
 terest, incorporation of a sub-
 sidiary company with headquarters
 in France, and priority in mar-
 keting for supply of the franc
 area.   Several American inde-
 pendent oil companies have ac-
 cepted these terms and gone in-
 to Saharan operations, although
 the major international compa-
 nies have remained aloof.
 The government also turned
 to the French nation for financ-
 ing.  Beginning in October 1957,
 the BRP conducted public sales
 of certificates against its hold-
 ings in a number of oil companies
 with remarkable success.   By the
 end of 1957, an estimated $350,-
 000,000 had been raised by public
 subscription from numerous small
 investors who can be counted on
 to back the government's Saharan
 program to the limit.
 Much emphasis has been giv-
 en to the theory that the pro-
 gram will mean a major saving
 in the long run, since over 90
 percent of present French oil
 requirements are paid for in
 foreign exchange.   Optimistic
 French estimates have claimed
 that by 1960 proper exploitation
 of the Saharan fields could
 save France over $500,000,000
 per year, a figure exceeding
 France's recent unfavorable
 balance of trade.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 29 May 19 58
 ALGERIAN REBEL LEADERSHIP
 Leadership of the Algerian
 rebellion, which erupted on 1
 November 1954, is shared by
 about a dozen Algerian Moslems
 of varying political views. Un-
 like the Tunisian or Moroccan
 nationalist movements,  in which
 Habib Bourguiba and King Mohamed
 V were the dominant figures,
 the Algerian drive for independ-
 ence has no single, undisputed
 spokesman.   While the Moroccan
 and Tunisian independence strug-
 gles were the effort largely of
 single parties,  the Algerian
 struggle is being carried on by
 the Algerian National Liberation
 Front (FLN), a coalition of po-
 litical groups, including re-
 ligious scholars banded together
 in the Society for the Algerian
 Ulema, the bourgeoisie of the
 moderate Democratic Union for
 the Algerian Manifesto, and
 splinter groups from the work-
 ers' Triumphant Movement of Dem-
 ocratic Liberties.
 The FLN is governed by a
 54-member National Council of
 the Revolution.   However, the
 executive body--the so-called
 Committee for Coordination and
 Execution--is composed of nine
 members, six of whom are pri-
 marily military leaders and the
 remaining three political fig-
 ures.   Its headquarters was
 transf erred from Cairo to Tunis
 last fall.
 The six military leaders,
 in their early and middle thir-
 ties, are practically unknown.
 Of these, Krim  Belkacem  is
 thought to be the ablest and to.
 have  outmaneuvered Abane Ram-
 dane, who was reported on 27
 May to have died from battle
 wounds, in a struggle for para-
 mount                  military control.   Of
 the other four, Amar Ouamrane is
 known to have worked  closely
 with the Tunisians, probably in
 arranging for the transit of arms
 to Algeria, while Abdelhafiz
 Boussouf, rebel commander in
 western Algeria, is said to fear
 Egypt's influence and to be favor-
 ably disposed toward the Moroc-
 cans.   All six served with the
 French Army during wartime and
 one, Mahmoud Cherif, was awarded
 the Legion of Honor for his per-
 formance as a first lieutenant
 during World War II and also
 served in Indochina.
 Probably best known among
 the three, political leaders is
 58-year-old Ferhat Abbas, a
 moderate who has been prominent
 in Algerian politics for nearly
 three decades.  Abbas has long
 sought more autonomy for an Al-
 geria closely aligned  with
 France.   After vainly attempting
 to obtain commitments from Paris
 for broad, progressive reforms
 for Algeria, he finally fled
 from France  to Cairo in April
 1956, when he announced his sup-
 port of the FLN.   Valued mainly
 for his prestige and personal
 ties, Abbas has given a tone of
 respectability to the FLN and

 Abbas is more likely
 to be foreign minister in a gov-
 ernment headed by Mohamed ben
 Bella, who is not one of the
 nine committeemen but  is  an
 honorary member of the group.
 Ben Bella, a former noncommis-
 sioned officer in the French
 Army, Is an original instigator
 of the rebellion.   At the time
 of his abduction by the French
 in October 1956, he was thought
 to be the rebels' chief of staff.
 Although at present he is im-
 prisoned in Paris with the de
 facto status of a political
 prisoner, he maintains a limited
 contact with the FLN.   Some
 French officials, who consider
 him a moderate and believe
 his incarceration to-.have been
 a major error, would like to
 see the terms ..of his imprison-
 ment relaxed in order to permit
 him to exercise a moderating
 influence on other FLN leaders.
 Other political leaders of
 the FLN are Abdelhamid Mehri,
 the FLN's representative to
 Syria,
 Debaghine, a 41-year-old lawyer,
 who headed an FLN delegation to
 the latest congress of the Yugo-
 slav  Communist party.   Mehri
 was the FLN's spokesman during
 the conference of North African
 political parties held in Tan-
 gier late in April and probably
 was in large part responsible
 .f or the adamant position main-
 tained by its delegation.
 Although the formation of
 an Algerian government after
 consultation with the Moroccan
 and Tunisian governments was ap-
 proved in  principle  by  the
 conference, details on its for-
 mation, composition, and prob-
 able  headquarters are uncer-
 tain.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY.
 29 May 19 58
 KHRUSHCHEV'S STATUS AND THE YUGOSLAV DISPUTE
 Warsaw reports contend
 that Khrushchev did not lead
 the present anti-Tito off en-
 sive  and that his dominance
 as a policy maker may have been
 qualified over this issue. Khru-
 shchev has in fact failed to
 associate himself publicly and
 emphatically with the present
 Soviet position on Yugoslavia,
 but his part in the development
 of the controversy with Tito
 remains 'unclear.  It is possible
 that he had to yield to pres-
 sures for a harder line in East-
 ern Europe.   Continuing prob-
 lems in the satellites, com-
 bined with domestic economic
 issues, could provoke a new
 round of political controversy
 within the party hierarchy.
 Speculation that there has
 been a division  of  opinion
 within the Kremlin on the Yugo-
 slav question has been prompted
 mainly by a hardening in the
 Soviet attitude between 18
 April and 9 May, when Pravda's
 reformulation of the offal
 line threatened to place the
 dispute on the governmental as
 well as the ideological level.
 Conceivably,  the shift may
 have resulted from a policy
 debate in the presidium.   If
 such an issue arose, however,
 it apparently was resolved by
 6 May, when Moscow, before the
 central committee met, published
 in full Peiping's People's Dail
 editorial of 5 May, the mo
 scathing attack on the Yugo-
 slavs yet to appear.   Therefore,
 while  the plenum of 6-7 May
 seems to have heard a state-
 ment on Soviet-Yugoslav rela-
 tions, there is no reason to
 believe that policy conflicts
 were carried there from the
 presidium, nor that any action
 affecting Khrushchev's author-
 ity was taken.   The most that
 can be conjectured with respect
 to Khrushchev's behavior in the
 Yugoslav affair is that, rather
 than allow the issue to degener-
 ate into an internal political con-
 troversy, he gave way under
 pressure within the presidium
 for a stiffer Soviet attitude.
 The Yugoslavs, who have
 long interpreted the shifting
 currents in Soviet policy to-
 ward themselves as expressions
 of factionalism in the Soviet
 leadership, have identified
 Khrushchev as the chief culprit
 in the latest episode.   The
 Yugoslav ambassador in Moscow
 has told diplomatic colleagues
 he does not believe there has
 been conflict within the Soviet
 hierarchy over policy toward
 Yugoslavia.   In his opinion,
 this policy was inaugurated by
 Khrushchev personally  and has
 been fully backed by the party
 presidium.   He rejected the
 idea that Khrushchev is subject
 to pressure either from within
 the Soviet leadership or "from
 without," apparently referring
 to Communist China.
 Ambassador Thompson sup-
 ports this appraisal, with the
 reservation that he thinks the
 Chinese Communist position may
 have influenced Khrushchev's
 Yugoslav policy to some extent.
 Possibly to suppress specula-
 tion that the Chinese were back-
 ing Stalinist opponents of Khru-
 shchev on the issue of Yugoslav
 revisionism, Peiping has point-
 edly endorsed the role of Khru-
 shchev personally.   In its sum-
 mary of the proceedings of the
 Chinese Communist party congress
 held between 5 and 23 May, Pei-
 ping approved as "necessary and
 correct" the steps taken toward
 Yugoslavia since 1954 by the
 Sotiriet party central committee
 "headed by N. S. Khrushchev."

 SUMMARY
 29 May 1958
 has accumulated since Stalin's
 death has put him in a position
 in which a successful challenge
 to his leadership would be ex-
 tremely difficult.
 .  On the plus side is Khru-
 shchev's organizational
 strength and maneuvering abil-
 ity.   The interlocking direc-
 torate which he has built to
 connect the party secretariat
 to the presidium would appear
 to be the best kind of insur-
 ance for preserving his dom-
 inance over both formulation
 and execution of policy.   At
 the same time, the directorate
 does not contain a rising star
 around which a second force
 might coalesce.   There are
 dangers, however, in assuming
 that the five-year round of
 disputes in the presidium has
 suddenly ended, or in trying
 to evaluate these individuals,
 either for leadership poten-
 'tial or for allegiance to a
 particular leader.
 The central committee is
 a somewhat different story.
 Its composition has apparently
 remained relatively unaltered
 during the past two years and
 it has demonstrated consistent
 support for its first secretary,
 Khrushchev.   In return, Khru-
 shchev continually gives the
 impression of going out of his
 way to keep the central com-
 mittee with him.   His con-
 tinued control of the central
 committee is not a foregone
 conclusion, although the odds
 are probably well on, his side.
 The principal factor now is
 that many of Khrushchev's pol-
 icies are reaching the point
 where they are finally getting
 the full test.   If one of his
 major economic policies were
 to fail or his control of the
 satellites slip, a consider-
 ably different evaluation
 would be in order.
 Possible Difficulties
 The aftermath of the Tito
 feud:   If, as some o servers
 suggest, the present feud with
 Tito was prompted primarily by
 Soviet anxiety over continued
 restlessness in Eastern Europe,
 particularly Poland, and a de-
 termination to restore Soviet
 control emphatically, then the
 present course marks not only
 the collapse of the attempt at
 reconciliation with Tito but,
 more importantly, a further re-
 treat from the post-Stalin pol-
 icy of relaxing satellite bonds.
 The "liberalization" policy
 culminated in October 1956 with
 Gomulka's rise in Poland and
 the Hungarian revolution.   It
 is possible  that Khrushchev
 is responsible for the hardening
 of the Soviet line since then.
 .  ',L 'he November 1957 meeting
 of Communist parties in Moscow,
 which touched off a bloc-wide
 campaign against "revisionists,"
 the Khrushchev-Gomulka meeting
 in January. 1958, and the April
 article in Kommunist, which
 seemed to demand an-increased
 tempo of collectivization in
 the satellites, may have been
 steps along the way to the
 break with Tito. Moreover, the
 political situation within the
 Soviet leadership has changed
 considerably as a result of. the
 series of purges of Khrushchev
 rivals.
 On the other hand, since
 this would mean he was totally
 relinquishing an Eastern
 European policy which he had
 pursued fairly consistently
 since at least 1955, the hard-
 ened position may have resulted
 from a shift in the balance of
 opinion in the presidium. Even
 after the shock of Hungary,
 Khrushchev seemed intent on
 saving something of his satel-
 lite policy; for example,  his
 meeting with Tito in Rumania
 last August.
 The problem of Poland: In
 any case, a harder line Vo-ward
 the satellites has Apparently
 emerged.   The question of how
 it will be applied to Poland
 could become a source of polit-
 ical conflict in the Kremlin.

 tain the maximum in bloc unity

 make a mistake in believing
 that Gomulka can be forced to
 adopt the bloc line.   Yet the
 Soviet leaders must realize
 the dangers inherent in demand-
 ing that Gomulka make state-
 ments against Yugoslavia which
 would in effect deny his own
 ideological base for the Polish
 "road to socialism."
 Gomulka's own domestic
 strength rests on his insist-
 ence, in the name of autonomy,
 that the Kremlin and the bloc
 generally must not interfere
 in the internal affairs of any
 individual bloc nation.   If he
 were now to join Moscow in
 what is essentially an attempt
 to dictate to Belgrade on in-
 ternal affairs, such a state-
 ment would deprive him of the
 basis for his own control of
 internal policy, encourage his
 opposition, and possibly even
 lead to a Polish national up-
 rising.
 Khrushchev's speech to
 the recent party plenum indi-
 cates that at least a tenta-
 tive decision has been made
 on the question of economic
 priorities, i.e., the stress
 on a maximum expansion of heavy
 industry has been modified to
 permit greater emphasis than
 before on the consumer sector.
 This decision would result in
 a better balanced economy, but
 in political terms, Khrushchev
 may have some trouble with
 "traditionalist" elements who
 feel that catching up with
 the West in heavy industrial
 production should have first
 priority.  A similar, essen-
 tially ideological-political
 problem is created by the
 policy of soliciting Western
 technical assistance.   The
 question might arise, "Is it
 wise to do anything which
 eases the economic crisis of
 capitalism?"
 Khrushchev seems to be
 raising new issues at a time
 when he is trying to put his
 economic house in order. Granted
 that he will probably gain
 ground with the Soviet people
 by adopting a Malenkov-like
 line on consumer goods, at the
 same time, he is continuing to
 complicate his political prob-
 lems, and these are the ones
 more likely to cause him trouble.
 As for some of the other innova-
 tions, the machine tractor sta-
 tion reorganization still car-
 ries the threat of at least a
 temporary weakening of control
 in the countryside.   Then, too,
 there is the new lands program
 which has not yet proved itself
 over the long run and might
 still be used to discredit its
 author.
 Khrushchev's economic in-
 novations could jeopardize the
 capability of the Soviet lead-
 ership to keep a strong and un-
 contested hand on the throttle
 of Soviet economic development.
 For example, by whetting the
 appetite of the Soviet consumer,
 Khrushchev, to a minor degree
 thus far, has had to restrict
 the availability of Soviet re-
 sources for other important
 national objectives, i.e., for-
 eign economic programs, the con-
 tinued rapid increase of pro-
 ducer  goods, and production
 of military hardware.
 In an attempt to promote
 efficiency and release local
 initiative, the regime is be-
 ginning to shift some of the
 economic decision making out-
 side Moscow.   Moreover, to
 enable local officials to make
 better economic decisions as
 to. the means to be used to
 achieve prescribed ends, the
 regime is giving consideration
 to the possibility of adopting
 a pricing policy which would
 better reflect the real cost
 and relative scarcity of var-
 ious goods and services.  The

 SOVIET-SATELLITE ECONOMIC RELATIONS SINCE 1956
 The Eastern European satel-
 lites have gained important eco-
 nomic concessions from the USSR
 since 1956, and Moscow is now
 attempting to nationalize intra-
 bloc exchanges through the CEMA
 program, rather than draining
 their individual national eco-
 nomies.   The growth of the bloc
 toward an integrated economy,
 however, which began in earnest
 two years ago, has had only
 limited success, and several
 difficult problems will continue
 to hinder it for the next few
 years.
 Increasing coordination
 and integration of bloc economic
 activity  is designed to assure
 the most effective use of total
 resources, and efforts are under
 way to improve satellite eco-
 nomic well-being to forestall
 popular unrest:
 The five-day meeting in
 Moscow of the bloc's Council for
 Mutual Economic Assistance
 (CEMA) issued a communique on
 24 May stating that CEMA had the
 responsibility of taking "prac-
 tical measures" to assure the
 implementation of Soviet bloc
 economic integration.   Khru-
 shchev, during a visit to Hun-
 gary in April, had criticized
 the failure of the satellites
 to cooperate with one another
 in the economic field and stated
 This lack of cooperation
 had led Bulgarian leaders to re-
 quest a special meeting with
 Khrushchev in February to air
 their complaints.   In Hungary
 he pointed out that increased
 economic cooperation and indus-
 trial specialization within the
 bloc rather than national self-
 sufficiency was required to over-
 take the West.   The USSR intends
 to convince satellite leaders
 that Communism's successful com-
 petition with the West in the
 raising of living standards de-
 pends ultimately on a division
 of labor within the bloc and the
 resulting lowering of unit pro-
 duction costs.  The USSR presum-
 ably also is eager to counter
 the growing economic unity of
 Western Europe.
 While the USSR probably is
 willing to continue economic and
 financial assistance to Eastern
 Europe, which during the past
 two years totaled $4 billion,
 it probably will indicate that
 such aid should support economic
 growth through integration ra,th?-
 er than serve as relief payments
 to imbalanced national economies.
 An important manifestation
 of its status vis-a-vis Moscow
 is Eastern Europe's trade and
 credit relations with the West,
 growth of which apparently has
 met with no serious Soviet ab-
 that the next CEMA meeting                                  jections.  The USSR in fact has

 The USSR has argued in jus-

 does not have to rely on free
 world sources, non-Communist
 countries can no longer impose

 has also called for increased
 economic collaboration within
 the bloc through a more rational
 use of economic resources and
 production capabilities.   This
 is to be accomplished by the co-
 ordination of national economic
 plans, production specialization,
 and exchange of industrial and
 technical experience.
 Economic Integration
 Although the satellites
 have moved slowly on integration,
 12 permanent functional commit-
 tees of CEMA have been estab-
 lished to promote industrial
 specialization and the use of
 common standards, and the mem-
 bers have agreed to coordinate
 long-term economic planning.
 As a result, direct ties between
 producing enterprises in satel-
 lite countries are growing, and
 working-level CEMA conferences
 have already engaged in develop-
 ing coordinated economic plans
 to run through 1965, the termi-
 nal date of the yet-to-be an-
 nounced Soviet Seven-Year Plan.
 Other forms of cooperation also
 have begun recently.   Czechoslo-
 vakia and Poland have agreed to
 cooperate in the modernization
 of Polish coal mines, and Prague
 has granted a loan.    On 17 May
 whelming bulk of this trade will
 continue for some time to be
 conducted on a bilateral basis.
 The new system will make intra-
 bloc trade more attractive, how-
 ever, inasmuch as it will not
 require that a country accept
 goods which have only marginal
 use in the settlement of trade
 imbalances.
 The more difficult problem
 in economic integration--the
 reluctance to relinquish inef-
 ficient production--continues
 to delay the achievement of ma-
 jor gains in the field of spe-
 cialization.  Unreliability of
 deliveries from other satellites
 in the past has encouraged each
 country to develop its own sup-
 plier industries despite fre-
 quently higher costs and inef-
 ficiency.   During the next few
 years, nationalistic desires
 for economic independence and
 technical disagreements on basic
 proposals for specialization
 also will continue to hinder
 the growth of bloc economic
 unity.
 Trade is the most impor-
 tant form of Soviet-satellite
 cooperation.  The  European

 satellites account for almost
 50 percent of total Soviet trade.
 The satellites are heavily de-
 pendent on the USSR and, in the
 case of many basic industrial
 raw materials, are receiving
 60 to 90 percent of their re-
 quirements from the Soviet Un-
 ion.   Since the East European
 uprisings of 1956, the USSR
 provides larger quantities of
 industrial raw materials and
 foodstuffs in short supply in
 the satellites, often on credit.
 Prior to 1956 the USSR frequent-
 ly declined to raise such ex-
 ports above the level  of  re-
 quired Soviet imports from each
 satellite.
 Soviet imports also have
 registered changes during the
 now concluded a new series of
 three-year  trade  agreements
 with  most of the satellites.

 loans granted in the last two
 years, will keep the European
 satellites  closely  bound to
 the Soviet economy   for several
 .years.
 Soviet credits and-loans
 to some extent have always al-

 workers' unions and have at
 times threatened to use their
 power against American economic
 interests in Indonesia.   These
 unions constitute the nucleus
 of PKI strength outside Java,
 and are concentrated in such
 important places as the estates
 area in North Sumatra and the
 oil centers of Borneo and Cen-
 tral and South Sumatra.   The
 Communists also operate a wide
 variety of front organizations
 and maintain a paramilitary
 veterans' organization. known as
 PERBEPSI.   Through these groups,
 the PKI has been steadily de-
 veloping its now extensive
 "grass-roots" support.
 The Communists have ex-
 ploited the central government's
 preoccupation with the dissi-
 dents in the past three months
 to strengthen their position in
 several respects.   During the
 anti-Dutch campaign late last
 year, the PKI not only took the
 lead in seizing Dutch firms and
 property but also tried to es-
 tablish its control over the
 management of these enterprises.
 Although the army is technically
 in charge of these operations,
 the PKI probably wields consid-
 erable influence.   With fight-
 ing going On in Sumatra and East
 Indonesia, the army has not been
 inclined to interfere with the
 Communists' efforts to consoli-
 date and expand their influence
 in Indonesia's economy.
 The Communists derive even
 greater strength from their un-
 wavering support of Sukarno's
 "guided democracy" concept and,
 more recently, of the central
 government's campaigns against
 the Dutch and the revolutionary
 movement.   Presumably they have
 influenced the President through
 promises of continued political
 support.
 Finally, the Communists
 can be expected to benefit from
 the propaganda and material sup-
 port the bloc has been extend-
 ing to Indonesia.   This  aid
 probably appears to many Indo-
 nesians as a fulfillment of PKI
 promises and assertions that
 only the Communist world is pre-
 pared unconditionally to back
 the Indonesians in the "defense"
 of their independence.
 The Communists' strategy
 in Indonesia has paid off in
 two important respects. First,
 their party has achieved in-
 creased stature as a loyal, na-
 tionalistic group.   Second, this
 new stature diminishes the pros-
 pects  that Sukarno could repu-
 diate his most ardent supporters,
 even if he wanted to, or that
 the army might suppress them.
 Any effective anti-Commu-
 nist action in the foreseeable
 future would have to depend al-
 most exclusively on the initia-
 tive of the army, which remains
 essentially non-Communist de-
 spite PKI efforts at infiltra-
 tion.   Indonesia's most outspo-
 ken anti-Communist political
 leaders have been discredited
 as dissidents.   The non-Javanese
 wing of the anti-Communist Mas-
 jumi party has suffered because
 of its sympathetic attitude to-
 ward the dissidents.   The lead-
 ers of other political parties,
 notably the Nationalist (PNI)
 and the Moslem Nahdlatul Ulama
 (NU), have for some time pro-
 fessed awareness of the growing
 Communist threat and have re-
 peatedly said they intend to de-
 vise measures to counteract it.
 However, no such countermeasures
 have yet emerged, nor have the
 non-Communist parties shown any
 serious inclination to submerge
 differences among themselves or
 to work harder at "mending their
 fences."
 Army spokesmen have indi-
 cated that in the absence of
 provocation, there would be no
 outright suppression.of the Com-
 munists.   The army, however, has
 recently taken steps to curb
 Communist activity, issuing de-
 tailed regulations for the con-
 duct of May Day celebrations and
 caxiceling an "anti-intervention"

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 29 May 1958
 SECRET
 ACTIVITIES IN FINLAND
 Helsinki are staffed by approx-
 imately 195 officials, ~f whom.
 over two thirds are attached to
 the Soviet Embassy and commer-
 cial mission.
 1. General Bloc Policy:   Sino-
 Soviet bloc activity in Finland
 is aimed at weakening Finland's
 policy of "friendly" neutrality
 in favor of closer relations
 with the bloc and at advancing
 Soviet foreign policy objectives
 toward other countries of north-
 ern Europe.   The USSR can put
 considerable political and eco-
 nomic pressure on Finland; how-
 ever, Kremlin leaders realize
 that such measures might move
 Finland closer to the West, as
 well as cause adverse reactions
 by the Scandinavian countries.
 Moscow has also found it prof-
 itable to point to Soviet-
 Finnish relations as an example
 of peaceful coexistence between
 a small and a large country hav-
 ing opposing social systems.
 Finland has thus been able gen-
 erally to conduct its external
 and internal affairs without
 overt bloc interference.
 2. During the past year, the
 Soviet Union has continued its
 efforts to use Finland to en-
 courage the Scandinavian coun-
 tries to pursue policies which
 would weaken their political
 ties with the West and to les-
 sen the effectiveness of Den-
 mark's and Norway's participa-
 tion in NATO.   The USSR, Poland,
 and East Germany have periodt-
 cally. urged Finland to. support
 the establishment of a Baltic
 "sea of peace" with the objec-
 tive of excluding Western naval
 and air forces from the area.
 Moscow is also attempting to
 strengthen its economic and
 cultural relations with Finland.
 3. Diplomatic Activity:   Fin-
 land maintains diplomatic rela-
 tions with the USSR, Communist
 China, and all the Eastern
 European countries except East
 Germany.   The bloc missions in
 4. Economic Activity:   Fin-
 .land's over-all trade-with bloc
 countries increased from $430,-
 000,000 in 1956 to approximately
 $518,000,000 in 1957, account-
 ing for 29 percent of Finnish
 exports--a slight increase--
 and 31 percent of imports--a
 rise from 25 percent in 1956.
 In the first quarter of 1958,
 Finnish purchases from the
 USSR declined sharply; it can-
 not be determined whether this
 trend will continue, particu-
 larly inasmuch as Finnish offi-
 cials are taking corrective meas-
 ures to restore the level of
 trade.   The Soviet Union sup-
 planted Great Britain last year
 as Finland's principal trading
 partner, and substantial in-
 creases in trade were regis-
 tered with Poland and Czecho-
 slovakia.   Transactions with
 Rumania fell off, however, as
 the Finns shifted from imports
 of refined petroleum to pur-
 chases of crude oil from the
 USSR in order to take advan-
 tage of their expanded refin-
 ery facilities.
 5. Last year's growth in Fin-
 nish commerce with the bloc re-
 sulted from a number of factors.
 Imports rose as delayed deliv-
 eries of Soviet goods were made
 and the Finns tried to liquidate
 a large credit balance with the
 USSR.   The slight rise in ex-
 ports resulted in part from ex-
 panded sales to Poland. Finnish
 inflation also tended to stim-
 ulate trade with the bloc:   the
 Finnish Government increased its
 purchases from the bloc and held
 down Western imports during most
 of 1957 in order to conserve for-
 eign exchange, while some Finnish
 goods which were priced too high
 for Western markets found bloc
 buyers.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 29 May 1958
 6.  On several occasions dur-
 ing the past year the Soviet
 Union has offered credits and
 loans to the.Finnis:h Government
 for industrial expansion.         De-
 spite considerable agitation by
 Finnish Communists to accept.
 Soviet assistance in order to
 industrialize the northernmost
 provinces,  the. Finnish Govern-
 ment has not responded to these
 overtures.
 7.  Cultural and Propaganda
 Activity:   Finland is the pri-
 mary target in northern Europe
 for Soviet cultural and prop-
 aganda activities and has the
 largest program of cultural ex-
 changes with the bloc of any
 free world country.   Exchange
 visits between Finland and the
 bloc rose sharply in 1957 to a
 total of 180 delegations; Fin-
 land sent 106 delegations--in-
 cluding a group of 1,600 to
 2,000 to the Moscow Youth Fes-
 tival--and was visited by 74
 bloc delegations.  Artist groups
 and sports teams accounted for
 two fifths of the exchange vis-
 its, with the balance repre-
 senting labor unions, the pro-
 fessions,  industry, government,
 and acknowledged Communist or
 front organizations.
 8. The bloc supports a total
 of seven friendship and cul-
 tural societies and centers in
 Finland.   The "Finland-Soviet
 Union Society," with 18 branches
 scattered throughout Finland and
 an estimated membership of some
 230,000,  is the largest and
 most active such organization.
 While its members include many
 non-Communist Finns--including
 the President of Finland, who
 is the honorary president--Com-
 munists hold positions of con-
 trol and the society functions
 as a major outlet for Soviet
 propaganda.
 9.  Sino-Soviet bloc radio
 broadcasts in Finnish at present
 total 41.5 hours per week, a
 slight increase since early
 1957.   Some of the bloc's
 broadcasts of about 42 hours
 per week in Swedish probably are
 also intended for listeners in
 Finland.   In addition to a TASS
 representative, three major So-
 viet newspapers have correspond-
 ents in Helsinki, and the Soviet
 Information Bureau--a news dis-
 seminating agency--is represented
 by a sizable staff.
 10.  Subversive Activity:   The
 Finnish Communist party (SKP)
 has a membership of approxi-
 mately 25,000, a drop of about
 5,000 over the past year.   In-
 terest in party activity is cur-
 rently low; only a small per-
 centage of members are partic-
 ipating in meetings and a mood
 of passivity prevails among the
 rank and file, particularly in
 the countryside.   The aftermath
 of the crises in Eastern Europe
 during 1956 and their continuing
 impact on the international Com-
 munist movement apparently are
 the cause of these difficulties.
 SKP leaders are also somewhat
 disquieted over the USSR's of-
 ficial policy toward Finland,
 on the grounds that it strength-
 ens anti-Communist elements to
 the detriment of the Communists.
 The Soviet leadership is reported
 to consider the SKP's operations
 as inadequate despite heavy fi-
 nancial support.
 11. The SKP is participating in
 regional coordination of Commu-
 nist party activities in north-
 ern Europe.   In October and
 again in February, representa-
 tives of the Danish, Norwegian,
 and Swedish Communist parties
 met in Helsinki with SKP lead-
 ers.
 12. The Finnish People's Demo-
 cratic League (SKDL), the po-
 litical-parliamentary front of
 the Finnish Communists,  is Fin-
 land's third largest political
 party and has consistently se-
 cured about one fifth of the
 electoral vote.   The SKDL, like
 other Communist fronts and mass
 organizations, is currently suf-
 fering somewhat from lack of
 interest.   The most important
 target of Communist penetration

 in Finland: is the Confederation
 of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK).
 Communists and their sympathiz-
 ers account for about 40 percent
 of SAK's membership and. hold
 three positions en the 17-man
 SAK executive committee.   Seven
 of the 36 affiliated national
 unions are-dominated by Commu-
 nists,  including the key con-
 struction workers' union.   In
 the metalworkers' union--Fin-
 land's largest--Communist
 strength is close_to one half.
 13. The Communists control four
 fairly important daily newspa-
 pers.  Circulation of Kansan
 Uutiset--official organo  both
 the SKP and SKDL--has fallen
 from almost 58,000 in 1956 to
 about 45,000.
 14. The Communists still con-
 stitute a substantial threat to
 Finland's internal security and
 political stability.   The S.KP
 hard core which forms the basis
 of the Communist capability for
 sabotage has not been notably
 .affected by recent difficulties;
 through their position in the
 trade union movement,  the Com-
 munists are able to stimulate
 labor unrest and inhibit gov-
 ernment efforts to achieve eco-
 nomic stability.
 15. Finnish Reaction to Bloc
 Activities:   Informed  inns and
 governmental figures are well
 aware of the USSR's potential
 for political and economic
 sanctions against Finland, as
 well as the ultimate threat of
 Soviet military action.   The
 Finnish Government is there-
 fore careful to calculate the
 impact of its foreign policy
 actions on Soviet-Finnish rela-
 tions..  On the other hand, Hel-
 sinki has yielded only a limited
 extent to pressure from Moscow
 to further bloc objectives
 among the Scandinavian coun-
 tries.
 16. Trade with the bloc is vi-
 tal to the Finnish economy. The
 USSR is the main foreign outlet
 for the exports of the metal-
 working and shipbuilding indus-
 tries, which are noncompetitive
 in Western markets, and the USSR
 supplies the bulk of Finland's
 coal, Oil, wheat, and fertiliz-
 er.  Nevertheless, the economic
 and political implications of
 the progressive increase in Fin-
 nish trade with the bloc are
 viewed with serious misgivings
 by many Finns, and Helsinki has
 taken steps to maintain the West-
 ern orientation of the economy.
 Finland has concluded multilat-
 eral payments agreements with
 Western European countries, and,
 in September 1957, devaluated
 the finnmark and liberalized im-
 port licenses.   The currency
 devaluation has thus far en-
 abled Finland to hold its West-
 ern markets in spite of a weak-
 ening demand for major Finnish
 products.   The Finns have also
 shown some interest in joining
 OEEC, but are hesitating be-
 cause they are concerned over
 possible disruption of trade
 with the bloc; Soviet inquiries
 in April regarding the economic
 consequences of Finnish member-ship in OEEC have contributed
 to Finland's caution.
 17.  The Finnish Communists are
 scorned by the majority of the
 population as subservient to
 foreign control.   Despite ex-
 tensive cultural exchange and
 propaganda programs, Moscow has
 not been successful in overcom-
 ing the inherent distrust and
 dislike of Russia by most FAhns.
 18.  The Outlook   Finland's rela-
 tions with  he USSR will remain
 potentially dangerous to Helsin-
 ki, and the Soviet Union would
 probably not hesitate to under-
 take drastic measures if Fin-
 nish actions were felt to war-
 rant such a step    Moscow ap-
 pears content, however, to con-
 tinue its policy of "calculated
 tolerance," at least for the
 near future.   Helsinki's abil-
 ity to maintain a balance in
 its economic relationships with
 the West and with the bloc is
 also an important factor: in-
 creased economic dependence on
