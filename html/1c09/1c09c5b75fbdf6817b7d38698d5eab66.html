WHO'S FOOLING -WHOM IN CHILE? 
What does the future hold for those socialist, democratic 
and progressive political parties, national organizations, religious 
groups and other political forces that enter into alliances with 
communist parties? Do the communists enter the alliance in good 
faith, with the thought of acting within the alliance merely as 
equals of the other parties and forces involved? Is it their 
true intention, within the bounds of their own political ideals 
and principles, to remain flexible to the political, social and 
ideological desires of the majority within the alliance for the 
common good of the alliance and the nation? Will the non-Marxist 
parties and forces of the alliance and their political, social and 
ideological ideals survive in the communist party version of the 
socialist state? 
An explicit answer to these questions is found in a theoretical 
trilogy issued in February this year by the top echelon of inter-
national communism, the Central Committee of the Communist Party 
of the Soviet Union (CC, CPSU). The central thesis appeared in 
the main journal of the CC,CPSU, KOMMUnist (issue No. 3, 1972), 
in a lengthy, wide-ranging article entitled, "The Falsifiers of 
Scientific Communism and Their Bankruptcy." Bearing the imprint 
"Prepared by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the CC, CPSU," 
the article carries the authority and political weight of a party 
directive, binding on all party members as well as on all parties 
worldwide. While providing the theoretical basis for upholding 
Moscow's ideological orthodoxy, the article ranges well beyond mere 
theory in prescribing in explicit terms the strategy and tactics for 
unifying and consolidating the "democratic, anti-imperialist and 
revolutionary forces" of the world under Soviet political hegemony. 
To underline the international significance of the pronounce-
ment, the CPSU simultaneously published two other articles further 
clarifying those sections of the KOmMUnist theme most pertinent 
to foreign communist parties. These articles appeared in 
Mezhdunarodnaya Zhizn (issue NO. 3, 1972), a Soviet international 
affairs monthly that appears in English and French editions as 
well as in Russian, and in NewTithes (issue No. 8, 1972), a Soviet 
international affairs weekly that is published in Russian, English, 
French, German, Spanish, Polish and Czech. Both articles Were 
signed by Alexander Sobolev, well known among leadership elements 
of international communism as head of the section of the CC, CPSU 
responsible for history of the international communist movement. 
Regarding political and ideological pluralism and the role of 
the communist party, questions of vital importance to non-communist 
parties and groups in alliances with communists, the "February 
decrees" of the CC, CPSU lay down the law as follows:

) On Political PlUtaliSm:  
"The modern revisionists advocate political 
pluralism. In their opinion, the dictatorship of the 
proletariat and the experience of the socialist 
countries in the organization of political life 
have outlived their time and should be succeeded 
by spontaneous development and competitive struggle 
among all social and political forces, all political 
parties, which in effect signifies abandoning the 
use of the instruments at the disposal of the 
working class organized as the state to uphold the 
people's revolutionary gains. At a time when the 
monopoly bourgeoisie is steadily building up the 
machinery of its domination, its political 
mechanism of self-preservation, the revisionists deny 
the people and their leader, the working class, the 
right to suppress the resistance of the exploiters." 
b) On Ideological Pluralism: 
"The modern revisionists ideabi6a1  
pluralism Negation of the universal, international 
character of Marxism-Leninism is accompanied with the 
claim that there exist different, hational forms 
of Marxism. At the same time it i maintained that 
equal and competitive co-existence of diverse ideological 
concepts is possible in the working-class movement and 
the socialist society." 
c) On the Role Of  the COMMUlli8t Patty; 
"Rejecting the need for a leading role by the 
communist party, as confirmed by the experience of the 
building of socialism in the USSR and the other socialist 
countries, the revisionists try to limit the party 
functions within the socialist society and bring them 
to a minimum. They suggest that the party should be 
considered merely as one of the social organizations not 
distinct from the other mass political, professional, 
or cultural organizations, playing not a leading role but 
merely the role of an "equal partner." The severe con-
sequences which attempts to abandon the Marxist-Leninist 
doctrine on the leading role of the party and the Leninist 
organizational principles may lead to were revealed by 
the 1968 Czechoslovak events. The activities of right-
wing revisionists plunged the country into a profound 
crisis and created the danger of losing the socialist 
achievements." 
World news media pay little or no attention to such weighty 
articles as those carrying the "February decrees" of the CPSU.

As a matter of course only the top leadership elements of local 
communist parties make it a point to read and digest the 
characteristically lengthy and dull theoretical pronouncements 
emanating from Moscow. As a result those who stand to lose the 
most (the non-communist parties and forces who join in common 
causes, alliances or coalitions with communists, other political 
parties and forces in countries and areas where such "united 
fronts" exist, and even the rank and file members of local 
communist parties) normally are unaware of Moscow's latest 
political and theoretical line. Under such circumstances, which 
are considered desirable in most cases by both the local communist 
party and Moscow, the leadership of the local party is allowed 
to formulate its own local line in the manner most politically 
expedient for the local constituency. 
A case in point, and apparently an attempt at deception of a 
most blatant variety, involves the treatment of the CPSU "February 
decrees" by the Communist Party of Chile (PCCh) and the Communist 
Party of the USA (CPUSA). Both parties are considered among the 
most stalwart and conscientious followers of Moscow's brand of 
communism. Neither has ever engaged in anti-Sovietism or denied 
or even questioned "the international significance of the experience 
of the CPSU." On the contrary, both have always considered the 
CPSU the unquestioned leader of communist parties everywhere and 
the essence of actual socialism as built in the USSR as the goal 
to be emulated by all communists. 
How then explain the fact that in the April 1972 edition of 
its leading journal, Political Affairs, the CPUSA chose to publish 
a full English translation of an article from the August-September 
1971 issue of the theoretical journal of the PCCh, PrinCipios, 
that directly contradicts the political and ideological line of 
the CPSU? The article in question is entitled "Ideological 
Pluralism", written by a member of the Central Committee of the PCCh, 
Sergio VUskovic Rojo. It makes the following points: 
a) On Political Pluralism: 
"To Chile, the historical legacy of the workers' 
movement presents us, as one of its most valuable 
experiences, with the durable existence of trade union 
unity, but also with the existence of various parties 
in the political sphere. Therefore, in our country, 
democracy and liberty are guaranteed by political 
pluralism and trade union unity. On the cultural and 
ideological levels the mere existence of a multi-party 
system is a guarantee that no new alienations foreign 
to the history of the Chilean popular movement will 
arise." 
"This style, so typically Chilean, of opening for 
ourselves the road to power was outlined in an interview

with comrade Luis Coral an (Secretary General of the PCCh) 
in the magazine RinaStita of April 30 of this year. In 
it he states the following: 'The Popular Unity coalition 
has won the government of Chile within the bounds of 
the State of Law. Today we operate, and will continue 
to operate within such bounds, because there is no other 
road for the structural transformation of the country 
towards socialism. What if the adversary rushes into 
sedition? Well, the Government of Popular Unity will 
naturally use every means, will make an appeal to the 
masses for the restoration of the law, in view of the 
new conditions created by the reactionary adventure. 
The State of Law is not a cumbersome piece of furniture 
which we must discard at the first opportunity. And I 
repeat: the scope of political and social pluralism 
which points out the road today is that which will 
characterize socialism in Chile tomorrow." 
b) On Ideological Pluralism: 
"Just as political pluralism implies the existence 
of various parties, ideological pluralism implies that 
in the Popular Government now, and under socialism 
tomorrow, there are and there will be various ideologies. 
The corollary of political pluralism is ideological 
pluralism. That is to say that today, and tomorrow in 
socialist Chile, there will be complete freedom of 
religion, of the diffusion of religious or non-religious 
ideas. Besides Marxism, other ideologies will be able 
to defend their points of view, will have their publi-
cations and seminaries, will maintain Catholic churces 
and high schools, Masonic temples, or Protestant places 
of worhip or those of other beliefs. Classes in 
religion of a voluntary character will continue, together 
with the new social and ideological activities which 
will keep arising in the revolutionary process." 
c) On the Role Of the - COMmUrii8t Patty: 
"Starting from the premise that the guarantees which 
are established cannot mean the stopping of change or the 
class struggle, which continues, the fact remains that 
not one of the parties in the Popular Unity coalition 
wants to be the one governing party, either now or in 
the socialist Chile of the future." 
The timing of the appearance of the PoliticalAffairs article 
is especially interesting since one normally would have expected 
that it would be precisely in its April issue that the CPUSA 
would have published its own guidance derived from the CPSU 
"February decrees."

As far as the PCCh is concerned, since the Chilean article 
was published in August-September of last year Rojo should by now 
have been branded as a "revisionist" and a corrected version of 
the PCCh line, in conformity with the CPSU line should have been 
published. Nothing of the kind has happened. In fact, in public 
statements since February, PCCh leaders have continued to reassure 
the electorate of Chile that the PCCh, as "an equal party" of the 
alliance, firmly believes in a permanent state of political and 
ideological pluralism. 
One cannot but conclude that both the PCCh and the CPUSA, 
with the approval of the CPSU, are attempting to deceive not 
only other left-wing political parties but even their own rank 
and file members.

February 1972 
THE FALSIFIERS OF THE THEORY OF SCIENTIFIC  
COWUNISIN AND THEIR BANKRUPTCY  
In the contempornry epoch the progreanive aocial development in 
taking place at an ever faster pace. The leading trend of social develop.. 
ment -- the revolutionary transition from capitalism to socialism and 
communism of mankind -- is making its way in the variegated and complex 
intertwining of historical events. This transition is linked with the 
implementation of the universal-historical mission of the working class, 
the most systematic fighter against all kinds of social and national 
oppression. The main achievement of the international working class and 
the main result of its revolutionary struggle are the formation and con-
i'solidation of the world socialidt system. The growing power of the USSR 
the first country of victorious socialism -- and Of all socialist - 
' countries is:now exerting a decisive impact on the world 'revolutionary 
process. 
Systematically opposing imperialism, the communist and worker 
pnrties are Also engaged in an irreconcilable ideological and political 
ntruggle at5ninnt right-wing and "left-wing" opportunism in the contem-
pornry revolutionnry movement. "Left-wing opportunism, mainly represented 
.by no-Trokakyism nnd Maoism, is trying to replace the scientific 
Mnrxist line of the revolutionary movement with political adventurism? 
and renctionary-utopian and barracks "socialism." Right-wing opportunism 
is trying to replace this line with bourgeois reformism. As a whole, as 
V. I. Lenin taught, revisionism always. means political surrender to the 
difficultiea and 0e,clatia enemy, and the abandonment of proletarian 
positions. 
The characteristic feature of the contemporary stage lie; in the 
fact that right-wing and "left-wing" opportunism frequently merge with 
nationalistic trends and with the most reactionary extreme anticommunism 
and anti-Sovietism. 
I 
The struggle of the working class against revisionism has its 
hietory. Suffice it to recall the political bankruptcy of regenaded 
such as E. Bernshteyn, K. Kautskiy, and others like them. V. I. Lenin 
;provided a clear characterization of revisionism. "In the field of 
'politics," he wrote, "revisionism tried to revise the real foundations 
of Marxism, namely the doctrine of the class struggle. Political 
freedom, democracy, and universal elections eliminate the grounds for 
the class struggle, we were told . . " (Complete Collected Works, 
vol 17, p 22). He also said that "they determine their behavior on 
the bnsis of specific cases, adapting themselves to current :events, to 
political pettiness, forgetting the basic interests of the proletariat 
and the basic featuree of the entire capitalist system and the entire 
capitalist evolution, sacrificing these basic interests for the sake of 
real or surmised temporary advantages. Such is the reviaionist .olicy"

Revisionists members of the "Manifesto" group in Italy, R. Gar.. 
audy in France, E. Fischer, and F. Marek in Austria, and others, 
grossly distorting and falsifying the ideas of K. Marx, F. Engel?, 
and V. I. Lenin, are presenting their "creativity" as the further de-
velopment of the Marxist-Leninist theory. In a relatively short period 
.of time the bourgeois publishing housee have brought to the,book market 
large quantities of their revisionist output. 
An analysis of the revisionist views indicates that on bautc 
matters they are in fact supporting the positions of bourgeois ideolo-
gy, anticommunium, and antt.Sovietism. Beginning with the revision of 
individual Marxist concepts, such people who, formerly, were within the 
ranks of the communist party, have become open renegaeen, abandoning 
the paste principles of the revolutionary doctrine of the working class, 
and replacing them with bourgeois ideological principles. 
The abandonment of the revolution and the preaching of reforms 
which do not affect the political power of cepitalien and a factual re-
conciliation with the bourgeois society is the essence of the revisionist 
views concerning today's revolutionary movements. 
The basic problem of the socialist revolution is that of power, 
of the dictdtorship!of the proletariat. The socialist revolution begins 
with the seizure of:political power which.is used as the main tool for 
economic, social, and cultural changes. Using various pretexts the 
modern revisionists firmly oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, 
identifying it with "party dictatorship," "the rule of the apparatus in 
the name of the party," and so on. They claim that the fact that the 
dictatorship of the proletariatmandatorily presumes the leading role 
of the communist party does, not stem in the least from the Marxist prin-
ciples. 
tor 
We are familiar with V. I. Lenin's numerous statements developing 
the basic Marxist principle to the effect that the dictatorship of the 
proletariat is inconceivable without communist party 'leadership; practical 
experience indicates that a multiparty system does not conflict in the 
least with the need for such leadership. The communist party is n van-
guard of the working class. It is its most conscientious, organized, 
and unified detachment. It is only under the leadership of the party 
that the working class can implement its dictatorship over the overthrown 
exploiting classes, and engage in constructive and educational work., 
Unlike the Marxists, the revisionists speak of the multiplicity 
of "morals of socialism," meaning a variety in the very nature of 
socialism. This is eloquently confirmed by the fact that all those 
supporting Lhe concept of multiple "models of socialism" try, as a rule, 
to fOrmulate "models" of a society whose socioeconomic and political 
system would he entirely differant from those of real socialism. They 
openly proclaim that they are striving toward the type of socialism which 
would be radically different from the models so far knowno.and that the , 
"model" they are building should embody the features of "real socialism."

Thin type socialism is distinct from real socialism above n11 in terms 
of its basis-. According to the Inventors or the "new soeinlisM" the 
socialist state ownership of capital goods, dominating in the world 
socialist system, creates statism, and bureaucrncy. It restricts de-
mocracy and lends to tho distortion of socialism. Foth this raamon they 
reject socialist state ownership, replacing it with an abstract socialist 
"socinl ownership managed by the sum total of working people" (Roger 
Garnudy. Le grand tournant du socialisms, p 191): It is natural that 
the superstructure erected on such a base would be substantielly dif-
ferent from the superstructure of factual socialism. According to its 
inventore, such speculative socialism is "true socialism." 
Such claims are radically different from the Marxist-Leninist 
doctrine. The classics of scientific socialism frequently pointed out 
that state socialist ownership of capital goods is the basis of the 
,entire socialist society. ' 
f What are the "arguments" hrought forth by the revisionists in sub.. 
stantiating their concept of the multiplicity of "models for socialism?" 
They stem, above n11, from the following premises: since unlike the 
slave-owning system, feudalism, and capitalism, socialism is not a 
distinct socioeconomic system, since it carries both the elements of 
the old system -- capitalism or feudalism -- and the prerequisites for 
the future system -- communism. That is precisely what, according to 
the revisionists, predetermines the profound and basic differences 
nmong the various "models for socialism" which depend on the economic, 
sociopolitical, and ideological structure of each country. In other 
words, socialism is considered as a transitional system between capital- $ 
ism and communism. . 
Marxism-Leninism, however, considers socialism not a transitional 
system but the first stage of the communist system. The transitional 
period covers the process of the revolutionary reorganization of capital-
ism into socialism. This view is of basic theoretical and practical 
significance. In fact, in the transitional period, a variety of socio-
economic strata and explOiting clesses exist within the society against 
which the victorious proletariat and its allies are engaged in a class 
Struggle. With the completion of the transitional period, as a result 
or the socialist reorganization of the entire economy, the vestiges of 
exploiting the classes are eliminated. As to the first phase of corn-
-- socialism -- it is characterized by the total and complete 
domination of the socialist ownership, socialist production relations, 
the existence of nothing but socialist type classes and strata, and 
the absence of social contradictions between town and country and 
between intellectual find physical labor. 
Analyzing the building of socialism in the various,countries, 
the revOionists reject nearly all the essential aspects characterizing 
the new society. Their purpose is to develop the type of "model of 
socialism" which would essentially resemble a "hybrid society" which 
combines both socialist and capitalist features.

The revisionists draw the conclusion that the communists must 
perpetuate bourgeois democracy dnd merely broaden its frameworks. Ac-
cording to the revisionist concepts the democratic nature of the future 
socialist society in the European countries and its deeper development 
compared with the existing socialist countries could be ensured only 
through political pluralism, through a multiple-party system which 
allows the existence of political parties with programs basically 
different from those of scientific communism and opposed to the com-
munist party. 
What ip the attitude of Marxist-Leninists towards party pluralism. 
under socialism? This question is inseparably linked with the attitude 
of the communists toward the other working class parties and the non-
proletarian political organizations. 
The communists clearly realize that the working class would be 
unable to build socialism without unity within its ranks or without an 
alliance with the remaining toiling masses. The question of the alliance: 
between communists and other workers parties and political organizations 
of nonproletarian democrats in the various countries depends on the 
d6velopment of the class' struggle and the role which such parties play 
in the revolutionary movement and the political life of their country. 
Uoi4ever, the basic characteristics of this alliance are its socialist 
objectives and the vanguard role of the communist party which ensures 
the reaching of such objectives. 
Having gained political power, the working class strives toward. 
the elimination of the private ownership of capital goods. This pre-
sumes the expropriation of the capitalists and the landowners and the 
reorganization of a petty market economy into a large-scale socialist 
social economy. As historical experience shows this inevitably leads 
to the elimination of class antagonism, to the ever greater rapproche-
ment among class interests and to the establishment of friendly co-
operation relations among all classes and strata within the socialist 
society. In this connection, under socialism, the grounds for the 
existence of any type of opposition parties opposing the communist party, 
is eliminated. 
Development of the world revolutionary process fully confirms 
the Marxist-Leninist view to the effect that the working class can 
destroy Capitalism and create a socialist society only under the leader-
ship of a revolutionary party of a new type, based on the Leninist or-
ganizational principles, and equipped with a knowledge of the basic 
laws governing social development and an understanding of the objec-
tives and paths of itsistruggle. "The experience of the historical 
development of many countries and of the class struggle convincingly, 
proved how necessary to mankind are the activities of communist parties, 
and how fruitful such Activities are in terms of social development," , 
emphasized L. I. Brezhnev, CPSU Central Committee Secretary General, 
at the 1969 International Conference of Communist and Worker Parties.

The revisionists try to present the Leninist doctrine of the party 
and its role in the revolutionary struggle and the building of socialism 
as a 'system of views separate from the basic concepts of Marxist 
theory. Yet, it is well known that the need for a political party of 
the proletariat was proclaimed as early as the ....11_2t...,,..2._)arlyCortzmutManifesto. 
Emphasizing this basic Marxist view, on 18 December 1889, in a letter 
to G. Trier, F. Engels wrote: "In order for the proletariat to turn 
out sufficiently strong and be able to win in .the decisive moment it 
is necesaary a view which Marx and I have defended since 1847 -- for 
it to set up a separate party, separate from all others and opposed to 
them, a party which would consider itself a class party" (K. Marx and 
F. Engels/Works, vol 37, p 275). 
E. Fischer calls for the abolishment of the communist parties as 
they have developed and to act differently, to dissolve them within it 
"left-wing" forces coalition in which the communists would not ha%e their 
own organizational structure. "In my view," he states, "most existing 
parties have become obsolete in terms of their form and type. I see the 
possibility for the formation of rew associations of fighters and people 
thinking alike, despite the old and frozen positions. If you wish, such 
aesociations would consist of Marxists and non-Marxists, of communists 
.And socinl,democrats, Catholics and Protestants." (Stern, No 49, 
1969. p 144). What is left entirely unexplained is how such heterogenous, 
associations could be associations of "alike-thinking people" and what 
,would the objective of their "struggle" be. Tn any cast,--auch naso-
(ciAtiOns deprived Of their proletAtian-Cohscientiousness organization 
And discipline, would represent no serious danger to the Capitalist 
monopolies. 
The modern revisionists are particularly active against the leading 
role of the communist parties in the socialist countries. This is no 
nccident:. The question of the place and role of the communist party 
in the,life of the socialist society is basic for its solution affects, 
/theme ll, the destiries of socialism in each individual country and 
the future of the entire world socialist system. 
Rejecting the need for a leading role by the communist party, as 
confirmed by the experience of the building of socialism in the USSR 
and the other socialist countries, the revisionists try to limit the 
party functions within the socialist society and bring them to a minimum. 
They suggest that the party should be considered merely as one of the 
social organizations not distinct from the other mass political, pro-
fessional, or cultural organizations, playing not a leading role but 
merely the role of an "equal partner." The severe consequences which 
attempts to abandon the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the leading role 
of the party and the Leninist organizational principles may lead to were 
revenled by the 1966 Czechonlovak,events. The activities of right-wing 
revisionists plunged the country into a profound crisis and created the 
danger Of losing the socialist achievements. 
Using various methods the right-wing socialists try not only to 
undermine the leading role of the communist parties in the revolutionary, 
movement and the building of a new society but to destroy the party

undermining its ideological foundations -- Marxist philosophical 
materialism. Attacking the French Communist Party and, through it, the 
communist movement as a whole, R. Garaudy writes as follows: "If the 
party does not wish to be a doctrinary sect but the nucleus of all 
forces which intend to build socialism in France, it cannot have any 
given "official philosophy." It can not be basically neither idealistic 
nor materialistic, neither religious nor atheistic" (Roger Cnraudy. Le 
grand tournant du socialisme, p 284). The abandonment of philosophical 
materialism as the basis for a proletarian outlook and the attempt to 
new-trate party policy from scientific revolutionary philosophy are yet 
another confirmation of the betrayal of the cause of the working class 
11 the revisionists. 
His,rical experience has repeatedly proved that it is precisely 
the communists, guided by the Marxist-Leninist theory in their policies, 
that have made and continue to make a decisive contribution to the re-
volutionary reorganization of the world. Under the circumstances of 
the sharpened ideological conflict between socialism and capitalism 
class ideological principle-mindedness is particularly important to 
the communists. Any retreat from proletarian ideology, whether as a 
concession to idealism which, using Leninist terminology, as before 
"turns to its own use even the slightest possible confusion in philo-
sophical thinking" (Complete Collected Works, vol 18, p 80), or in 
another form, objectively increases the Positions of bourgeois ideology 
and, essentially, is equivalent to the abandonment of an independent 
proletarian policy. That is precisely why the communist parties can not 
remain neutral in the conflict among antagonistic outlooks. 
The revisionists are fiercely attacking the organizational foun-
dations of the Marxist-Leninist parties. Above all they are rejecting 
the international nature of the Leninist organizational principles. 
These principles, naturally stemming from the very essence of the com-
munist party as a party of revolutionary action, the revisionists try 
to\present only as the product of specifically Russian conditions and 
the.circumstances of the political struggle at the turn of the century. 
They claim that, having established the organizational stricture of the 
party, V. I. Lenin considered it unchangeable and that today's Marxist-
Leninist parties are no different at all from the Bolshevik party of 
that time in terms of organizational forms, when Bolshevism operated 
under clandestine conditions. Thus the revisionists deliberately confuse 
the essenee of the matter, trying to replace the question of the prin-
ciples of the organizational structure of the party with the question 
of the specific forms of its organization so that they may more easily 
accuse the communist parties of being out-of-step with modern conditions. 
It is above all the principle of democratic.centra sm that is 
opposed by the contemporary revisionists. They claim that the imple-
mentation of this principle hinders the development of true democracy 
within the party, that it converts the party into a "hierarchic or-
ganization," a "bureaucratic pyramid," and so on. Arbitrarily breaking

tivities:of the communist- portie.s, the revisionists try to preSent 
-Matters as though centralism and discipline within the party allegedly

Revisionist practices clearly show what they would like to mike 
of democrncy in party life. The activities of the "Manifesto" group, of 
R. Garaudy, E. Fischer,?. and other renegades proves that while allegedly

-so on, in fact they favor freedom of activity for antiparty groups and ? 
factions nnd the ndmissioh of the type of ."initiative" which woUld be

INTERNATIONAL POSITION OF THE USSR AND CPSU FOREIGN POLICY 
THE STRUGGLE OF THE CPSU FOR UNITY OF THE WORLD 
COMMUNIST MOVEMENT AND AGAINST OPPORTUNISM AND REVISIONISM 
A. SOBOLE V, 
D. Sc. (Philosophy) 
HNDER the present historical conditions, 
unity is becoming an increasingly impor-
tant factor in the further development of the 
communist movement. This is primarily because 
the communist movement is the most influen-
tial, organised political mass movement of our 
day marching in the vanguard of the democra-
tic, anti-imperialist and revolutionary forces. 
The fate of peace, democracy and socialism, as 
well as the future of all mankind, depend on the 
militancy and cohesion of the communist 
movement. 
An analysis of the laws governing social 
development shows that the consolidation of 
the unity of the world communist movement is 
an objective historical trend. Unity is a politic-
al and ideological expression of the real needs 
of the world revolutionary process in the cohe-
sion of all revolutionary anti-imperialist and 
rznii-monopoly forces. ? 
This historical trend, however, does not 
make itself felt directly, automatically or spon-
taneously. The unity of the world communist 
movement arises out of the vigorous social, 
political and ideological struggle, and various 
objective and subjective difficulties have to be 
overcome to maintain it. 
That is why the problem of unity, the rea-
sons for the urgency of it under the present 
conditions and the prospects for its achievement 
should not only be viewed subjectively as just 
political and ideological struggle against vari-
ous opportunist and faction groups, trends and 
personalities. The gist of the problem of the 
world communist movement's unity can be un-
derstood correctly only by thoroughly analysing 
the present-day confrontation between socialism 
and capitalism, as well as the objective and 
subjective factors and circumstances which 
determine the arrangement of class forces and 
the course of the struggle between them; it can 
be understood only against the general back-
ground of the socio-economic, political and 
ideological battles which form the content and 
development of the world revolutionary process 
and condition the growing role played by com-
munists. 
The CPSU with its diverse political, orga-
nisational, ide,ological, and theoretical activities 
plays an exceptionally important role in the 
struggle for the unity of the world communist 
movement. The struggle to consolidate the com-
munist movement is the internationalist duty 
of each communist party loyal to the banner of 
Marxism-Leninism. The principle of party equa-
lity in the world communist movement organi-
cally includes an equal historical responsibility 
for the militancy of the revolutionary vanguard. 
As equal among equals, the Communist Party 
of the Soviet Union is, at the same time, the 
most experienced contingent of the world corn-1 
munist movement, and it makes a particularly/ 
large contribution to the struggle for consolida-
tion of this movement and for the enhancement; 
of the revolutionary and transforming role' 
played by the communist parties. The CPSU/ 
wages its struggle against the Right and 
"Left" opportunists, against the nationalists 
and splitters and those who, directly or indi-
rectly, undermine the militancy of the commu-
nist movement; this struggle is based on crea-
tive Marxism and proletarian internationalism, 
a Leninist analysis of the present stage of 
historical development and consistent imple-
mentation of a principled political line. 
The 24th Congress of the CPSU has made 
a very valuable contribution to improving the 
communist movement's militancy. The major 
Importance of the decisions adopted by* the 
Congress is that it has furnished an answer 
to many urgent questions of out day and has 
made a new and concrete contribution to the 
theory and practice of the international com-
munist movement. It has further enhanced, and

consolidated Its prestige and historical role as 
the leading force . in the social progress of 
mankind and as the leader of the revolutionary 
activity of the working class and all working 
people. 
? 
TIHE PRESENT epoch is marked mainly by 
the great confrontation between world 
socialism and world capitalism, which is be-
coming more active, multifaceted and dynamic 
with each passing year. It has entered the phase 
when the advantages of socialism come more 
and more clearly, to the fore and thereby mul-
tiply socialism's transforming and magnetic 
force, while the contradictions and social ills 
of capitalist society are becoming increasingly 
more acute, conflicting and explosive, the anti-
popular character of capitalist society manifest-
ing itself particularly vividly. 
The struggle between socialism and capital-
ism finds its real expression in the world revo-
lutionary process with the folloiring characte-
ristic features: 
? Firstly, the revolutionary process has be-
come truly worldwide. All countries have be-
come the arena of the sharpest clashes between 
the forces of peace, democracy, national libera-
tion, revolution and socialism, on the one hand, 
and the monopoly bourgeoisie and its allies, on 
the other. All nations have been drawn into this 
struggle. 
- Secondly, in its social aspect the revolu-
tionary process has become universal. It is 
directed against all outdated socio-economic 
relations, all archaic structures, against capi-
talism, feudalism, the survivals of semi-feudal-
ism, slave-ownership, communal relations, 
against everything that impedes the social 
progress of mankind. General democratic, na-
tional liberation, anti-imperialist, and other 
movements, while retaining their independence 
for a more or less long period, in the final 
analysis, lead to a socialist revolution. In other 
words, the world revolutionary process includes 
socialist and communist construction, socialist 
revolutions in the capitalist countries, broad 
mass democratic movements against reaction, 
agrarian reforms directed against the survivals 
of feudalism, oligarchy and the latifundists; na-
tional liberation movement against imperialism, 
non-capitalist development aimed at eliminat-
ing economic backwardness and archaic socio-
economic structures and paving the way to so-
cialism. 
- - Thirdly, the driving forces of the world 
revolutionary process are expanding, while the 
forms and methods of revolutionary activity are 
developing and becoming enriched. The interna-
tional proletariat is the main driving force of 
the revolution. But fresh contingents of pea-
sants, intelligentsia, white-collar workers, arti-
sans, urban middle-classes, youth and particu-
larly students are joining in the active struggle 
for peace, democracy, national independence, 
revolutionary transformations of society and the 
transition to socialism. Some strata of the na-
tional bourgeoisie take part in the anti-imperia-
list struggle in countries suffering from coloni-
al oppression. 
The substantial expansion of the driving 
forces of the world revolutionary process sets 
before the communists important political and 
Ideological tasks, the principle task being the 
struggle for the masses of people, above all 
for the majority of the working class and its 
consolidation on a revolutionary basis. This 
also envisages a union of manual and white-
collar workers, aimed at overthrowing the pow-
er of the monopoly bourgeoisie, and a union of 
all progressive and patriotic forces directed 
towards liquidating colonialism, neocolonialism 
and all forms of imperialist oppression. Prob-
lems pertaining to the ideological relations be-
tween the allies in the struggle against impe-
rialism inevitably come to the fore. 
The present historical conditions and the 
level of the class struggle make it possible id 
raise the question of inculcating socialist ideo, 
logy into the democratic movement. It is neces-, 
sary primarily to explain the essence of the 
Marxist-Leninist policy and the aims of the 
struggle, as well as to educate the non-prole-
tarian revolutionary masses by using their own 
political experience. All this helps to raise the 
class struggle to a higher level. However, the 
task of political unity of all anti-imperialist 
forces, particularly of ideological relations 
among them has far from been solved. 
?Fourthly, the world revolutionary process 
is indivisible in the broadest sense of the word, 
and this finds expression in the international 
character of the class struggle. 
In their time, Marx and later Lenin, deve 
loping Marxist ideas, discovered the dialectics 
of the international and the national in the deve. 
lopment of the socialist revolution. In our day 
the internationalisation of the class struggle 
has reached a very high level. Today there are 
no isolated revolutionary and liberation acti-
vities and processes in the world. 
The interconnections between the three mair 
revolutionary streams are becoming stronger 
the interdependence in the activity of all na,

tional revolutionary contingents and democratic 
movements and currents is growing while the 
role and significance of the worldwide confron-
tation between socialism and capitalism, be-
tween democracy and reaction for the success of 
the struggle waged by each national revolution-
ary-democratic contingent are becoming more 
important. 
At the same time, a stormy process of 
growing individualisation of the actual histo-
rical conditions of revolution and socialist 
construction takes place. The dialectical con-
nection between the international and the na-
tional has become closer and, at the same time, 
more flexible. 
The individualisation of the concrete histo-
rical conditions in the revolutionary activity is 
in itself a step forward in the general develop-
ment of the revolutionary struggle but, at the 
same time, this individualisation is fraught 
with possibilities of growing nationalistic sen-
timents, isolationism, and propaganda of non-
Marxist views. 
Life repeatedly shows that socialist con-
struction, national liberation movements, and 
revolutionary transformations in any country, 
regardless of the wishes of political leaders 
tind theorists were, arc and will increasingly 
become the results of the world efforts of the 
international working class and its creation ? 
the socialist system. This gives rise to the prob-
lem of further coordinating the international 
and national strategy and tactics. It is becom-
ing perfectly clear that an objective necessity 
to elaborate the international strategy of the 
confrontation between socialism and capital-
ism is growing and, that taking this into ac-
count, it is necessary to improve the national 
strategy for preparing and carrying out the 
revolution in any particular country. Fresh op-
portunities to intensify the dynamics of revolu-
tionary processes will open up as these prob-
lems are solved. 
- Fifthly, the world revolutionary process 
is irreversible. This is the historical law of the 
present social development. In the course of the 
worldwide confrontation between socialism and 
capitalism the reactionary forces may and do 
score temporary and partial successes, and se-
parate setbacks and failures of anti-imperialist 
forces are possible in the course of the strug-
gle. However, historical initiative has irrevo-
cably passed to socialism. Monopoly capital has 
neither socio-political reserves nor spiritual and 
ideological values to meet the decisive historic 
challenge of our age?the challenge of so-
cialism. 
Today it has become even clearer that the 
policy of manoeuvres and adaptation pursued 
by the monopoly bourgeoisie does not consoli-
date capitalism as a social system but inten-
sifies its incurable ills. 
e. 
THE INTERNATIONAL communist movement 
I is the vanguard force in the world revolu-
tionary process. Its prestige, influence and mili-
tancy increase as the successes scored by the 
revolutionary forces it guides grow. This is the 
result of the struggle waged by the communist 
parties for the ideological, political and organi-
sational consolidation of their ranks as they 
master the science and art of political leader-
ship. 
The international communist movement is 
the only political force which has scored the 
greatest historic achievement, namely, the 
establishment of the world socialist system. In 
its triumph, socialism exerts a decisive influ-
ence on the entire course of social development 
and raises the hopes of people throughout the 
world. 
An analysis of the leading trends in pre-
sent world development shows that the growth 
of the prestige and influence of the communist 
parties, as well as the enhancement of their 
revolutionary and transforming role In and 
responsibility for peace, democracy, national 
freedom, revolution and socialism are an histo-
rical regularity of the social life of our day. 
The rapid development of the communist 
movement and the enhancement of its revolu-
tionary and transforming role is in no way a 
series of continuous successes. In the commu-
nist movement there ,are various splitting fac-
tions and groups, opportunist vacillations in 
the policy of some parties, and revisionist 
distortions in theory. The revisionist and 
splitting currents can be singled out approxi-
mately as follows: 
? Right-wing revisionism, which in essence". 
consists of revising Marxist-Leninist theory 
on the objective regularities of the class strug-
gle and socialist construction, and of denying 
revolution as a form of transition from capi-
talism to socialism, as well as of professing 
reformism, trivial evolutionism and spontaneity, 
and of denying the leading role of the com-
munist party and the working class as the main/ 
revolutionary forces; 
? "Left"-wing revisionism which Is an 
attempt to replace the Marxist-Leninist theory 
on laws governing the preparation and imple-
mentation of the revolution by a subjective

CPYRGHT 
and idealist theory of voluntarist violence upon 
history; 
? Nationalism, which denies the dialectics 
of the international and the national and, di-
rectly or indirectly, completely or partly opposes 
the national interests to the international; 
? Maoism which is a specific ideological 
and political trend seeking to replace Marxism-
Leninism with Mao Tse-tung's ideas. 
No single objective or subjective factor can 
account for the emergence of the difficulties, 
sharp contradictions, revisionist ?currents and 
splitting trends in the world communist move-
ment. Moreover, they cannot be explained only 
by mistakes, delusions of illwill of a particular 
political leader. Of course, the subjective qua-
lities of a politician can make a serious imprint 
on the development of the factional and split-
ting struggle but the deep reasons for the 
emergence of different variants of revisionism 
are varied and complicated. 
Lenin taught that every type of revisionism 
should be regarded and studied as a social 
product of the entire historical epoch. All mo-
dern trends and manifestations of revisionism 
should also be regarded as the effects of com-
plicated causes operating on an international 
and national scale. 
One of the main causes is that the monopoly 
bourgeoisie is now intensifying its ideological 
and political struggle against the revolutionary 
forces, primarily communists by combining par-
tial concessions, and social and ideological 
demagogy with the subtlest forms of violence 
and fraud. Using every possible means the rul-
ing classes seek to inculcate in the minds of the 
working people the carefully camouflaged pat-
terns of bourgeois ideology and to carry out, 
directly or indirectly, various ideological sub-
versions among communists. 
It may be said that the gamble on the dis-
integration of the communist and the entire 
revolutionary movement from within is one of 
the most important trends of the class strategy 
of imperialism. In his time Lenin wrote: "The 
more victorious we are, the more the capitalist 
exploiters learn to unite and the more deter-
mined their onslaught". I 
The process of enlarging the social base of 
the world revolutionary movement by Includ-
ing the intermediate strata is a process that 
engenders serious differences in the conscious-
ness and organisation of separate contingents 
of this movement and is an important factor 
that feeds various non-Marxist views. ?lice 
V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 30, p. 450. 
drawn Into the revolutionary movement, the 
mass of non-proletarian working people bring 
with them a powerful revolutionary potential 
and hatred for capitalism. At the same time, 
they have a vague and sometimes utopian or 
even reactionary notion about socialism. They 
lack a clear objective and organisation. All 
this inevitably exerts an influence on the com-
munistmovement. 
We should further note the complicated and 
contradictory effects of the rapid growth of the 
communist parties. The people of non-proleta-
rian origin who join the party have no prole-
tarian training, often lack experience in the 
class struggle, and possess an inadequate 
knowledge of Marxism-Leninism; this also 
facilitates the emergence and dissemination of 
nationalistic views, as well as the Right- and 
"Left"-opportunist deviations. 
One should also bear in mind that countries 
with different levels of development have em-
barked on the road of socialism. That is why 
the difficulties encountered by a country which 
overturns its system of social relations only 
add to the difficulties of levelling out its deve-
lopment and overcoming backwardness. 
It is also necessary to mention the compli-
cated consequences of the awakening and self-
assertion of a nation. The very process of a 
nation's awakening and self-assertion is one 
of the greatest achievements of our age. It is 
the result of scores of nations and hundreds of 
millions of people being drawn into active poli-
tical life, as well as the changes in the politic-
al balance in the world, At the same time, this 
process involves nationalism and infringes 
upon the dialectical connection between the 
national and the international to the detriment 
of the latter. There are also other factors which 
feed the complicated gamut of revisionist, 
anti-Leninist trends in .the communist move-
ment. 
All modern Right and "Left" revisionist 
trends have some common political, methodolo-
gical, gnosiological, ideological and theoretic-
al peculiarities which determine the content and 
pattern of revisionism as a whole. 
The denial of the internationalist character 
of the Marxist-Leninist theory, as well as the 
unity and continuity of Marxism and Leninism, 
and the revision of the basic propositions of 
the revolutionary theory present the most im-
portant features of modern revisionism. The 
aggressive attacks against Marxism-Leninism 
vary in their desigii and arguments. I len' is a 
typical way of reasoning.

Lenin to Marx; a subjectivist and voluntarist 
approach to the reality is slanderously attribut-
ed to V. I. Lcniii, an approach that allegedly 
neither reflects nor explains the latest phenome-

(boils and therefore cafinot serve as an instru-
ment for cognising the present world; 
-- Leninism, as revisionists assert) is a 
phenomenon engendered by the specific condi-
tions in backward Russia, and it cannot be ap-
plied to the explanation and solution of the 
socio-economic problems of developed capital-
ist society, particularly under present-day con-
ditions, when, under the impact of the scientific 
and technological revolution, capitalism has 
allegedly made a qualitative change; 
-- the ideas of_mature Marx are a distor-
tion of the ideas of young Marx, the genuine 
content of Marxism ? "humane Marxism" ? 
having been elaborated in Marx's early works. 
On the basis of this reasoning the revision-
ists have issued the call: Back to young Marx, 
to "genuine, authentic Marxism". Of course, 
they completely distort the true views of young 
Marx. 
E. Fischer, an Austrian revisionist, asserts 
that Marxist philosophy is -a theory about a 
"whole" man. Milovan Djilas, who has complet-
ed his revisionist path as a renegade, said in 
his interview to Sulzberger: "...Young Marx 
was not a 'Marxist'l He was half Hegelian... 
I am for 'open Marxism'... We go back from 
Lenin to Marx like the protestants who went 
from the Vatican to the Bible". 2 
Metaphysical absolutisation of some aspects 
of social relations serves as a methodological 
basis for present-day revisionism. Revisionists 
virtually deny Marxist dialectics. Opposition 
of national peculiarities to international essence 
and international conditionality of social deve-
lopment is typical of revisiOnist methodology, 
while concrete and historical phenomena are 
raised to the level of general laws. 
in the final analysis, all revisionist theore-
tical and methodological propositions lead to 
a denial of the general pattern of social deve-
lopment, of class struggle and revolution. It 
Is also a denial of the entire process of transi-
tions from capitalism to socialism, and of the 
common pattern of organisation of a socialist 
society. They oiler extensive opportunities for 
extolling and worshipping spontaneity, some-
thing which dooms any communist party to po-
litical passivity and loss of revolutionary ini-
tiative, as well as for developing any forms 
I Tagesanzelger, Dec. 7, 1968. 
of voluntarism and subjectivist arbitrariness. 
It is a characteristic of all revisionists that 
they renounce the principle of a proletarian as-
sessment of events and phenomena when de-
termining their political line and their place in 
the. fierce class struggle. 
Politically all trends in present revisionism 
are characterised by various degrees of anti-
Sovietism. The revisionists deny the interna-
tional significance of the experience of the 
CPSU, as well as the historically natural es-
sence of actual socialism as built in the USSR, 
and they slander the domestic and foreign poli-
cies of the Soviet government. 
All modern revisionists oppose the theory 
and practice of the communist parties which 
operate on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, and 
deny the necessity for a general policy in the 
international communist movement. 
Such are some of the common features of 
all trends of modern revisionism. It would be 
erroneous, however, to concentrate attention on 
these general features alone. Each revisionist 
trend has its own peculiarities, specific argu-
ments, political tendencies, as well as tactics, 
methods and forms of struggle. It is important 
to know these peculiarities in order that a suc-
cessful struggle against concrete revisionist 
trends may be waged. 
The exposure of the theory and practices of 
Right-wing revisionism, which constitutes the 
main danger in many parties, is becoming more 
important in the struggle to consolidate the 
communist movement and to enhance the mili-
tancy of the communist parties. Most active in 
elaborating and disseminating Right-wing re-
visionist ideas are such renegades as R. Ga-
randy, E. Fischer, F. Marek and 0. Sik. 
The components of the theoretical and poli-
tical credo of Right revisionism are: denial of 
Marxism-Leninism as the single international 
theory; denial of the general pattern of a revo-
lutionary transition from capitalism to social-
ism and organisation of socialist society; praise 
of the spontaneity of social development; re-
placement of revolution as the cornerstone of the 
transformation of society on a socialist founda-
tion by trivial reformism; denial of the dicta-
torship of the proletariat and its replacement 
by bourgeois-democratic pluralism; denial of 
the common character of the processes of so-
cialist development in society, and propagation 
of a qualitative diversity of "models of social-
ism"; and denial of the party's leading role. 
The political and ideological credo of the 
"Left" revisionists includes all the features of 
modern revisionism. However all these points

ot departure are refracted through the prysm 
of the subjective and idealistic views and ad-
venturist action. It is on this basis that the 
specific features of "Left" revisionism grow. 
The "Left" revisionists underestimate or even 
deny the objective and regular character of the 
preparation for and implementation of the 
revolution and overestimate the role played by 
subjective factors, as well as the importance 
of the accelerating factors. The "Leftists" un-
derrate the role of the masses as a decisive 
force in the revolution, ignore the task of poli-
tical educating the broad sections of the work-
ing people, the use of all forms of drawing the 
masses into the revolution, and at the same 
time absolutise the role played by political 
groups, guerrilla detachments and certain 
personalities. The "Leftists" revise the Leninist 
premise of the abundance and diversity of 
forms and methods of struggle and absolutise 
the armed struggle alone, regarding it as the 
only means of awakening the people and solv-
ing revolutionary problems. 
Lenin always waged a relentless struggle 
against the pseudo-revolutionary "Leftists", 
and showed how to combine revolutionary 
enthusiasm with the most sober assessment of the 
alignment of class forces and the mood of the 
people. The history of the communist move-
ment, the events in Indonesia and some Latin 
American countries in particular, as well as 
the activity of the White Flag Party in Burma 
show that pseudo-revolutionary radicalism has 
done considerable harm to the cause of the 
working class and socialism. 
The struggle against revisionism in 'theory 
and opportunism in practice, and also the 
struggle against every ideological vacillation 
and political uncertainty are, in historical 
significance and social content, a struggle for 
the popular masses. It is an inseparable com-
ponent of the political strategy aimed at unit-
ing the working people of both town and coun-
try and the manual and white-collar workers 
on a revolutionary basis for the purpose of 
solving the actitest problems of social develop-
ment, namely those of peace, consistent demo-
cracy, national prosperity, and social progress. 
It is a constituent of revolutionary tactics, the 
essence of which is to help the masses master 
the most effective forms, ways and means of 
the anti-imperialist and anti-monopoly struggle 
and to ensure the ideological and political rout 
of all those who consciously or unconsciously 
deceive the people and prevent them from 
effectively using their class energy In the strug-
gle against reaction. 
At the present stage, the communist move-
ment has encountered Maoism, another danger 
ous form of revisionism with particularly 
refined methods of splitting and subversive 
activity. 
Maoism is an anti-Leninist trend with spe-
cifically Chinese social, historical and ideolo-
gical sources. Under their influence, Marxism-
Leninism was distorted, changed and adapted 
to the great-Chinese hegernonistic and chauvin-
ist aims. Maoism has borrowed its reasoning 
from various past and present opportunists. 
The essence of Maoism is a revision from 
a chauvinistic point of view of all the basic 
provisions of Marxism-Leninism. It replaces 
Marxism-Leninism with an ideology which 
eclectically combines vulgar materialistic no-
tions of the objective world, a subjective and 
voluntarist understanding of the world histo-
rical process and primitive mechanistic dia-
lectics. Maoism seeks to replace the theory 
of scientific communism with a reactionary and 
utopian theory of barrack socialism with its 
economic equalisation on the basis of poverty 
and spiritual levelling based on illiteracy, as 
well as an amorphous facelessness of the 
people led by a "great personality". It also 
envisages a militarisation of social life under 
the flag of socialism in order to pursue a hege-
monistic policy. 
Politically Maoism is manoeuvring between 
classes, social strata and political trends, op-
posing groups to one another or inciting them 
? against each other. "The thoughts of Mao" are 
aimed at substantiating voluntarism in politics, 
arbitrariness in the economy, a possibility of 
radically changing the political tasks depending 
on a concrete manifestation of the hegemonistic 
goals, as well as at substantiating a striving 
to use Marxist-Leninist ideas and the revolu-
tionary, communist movement in order to at-
tain these goals, 
Maoism advances an anti-Marxist concept 
of the class struggle and the world revolution-
ary process. It denies revolutionary content in 
the competition between socialism and capital-
ism, conceives revolution as a volition, propa-
gates the export of revolution, denies the policy 
of peaceful coexistence, and regards a world 
war as the only form of solving the problem 
of revolution on a worldwide scale. 
Maoist views reflect the historical impa-
tience and confusion of non-proletarlan ele-
ments of Chinese society faced with the coin-
plex problems of transition to socialism, and 
surrender to the difficulties connected with 
socialist construction, particularly great in so

backward a conntry as China. The Maoists 
have completely broken with the principles of 
proletarian internationalism, and have stibsti-
titled for it, taking an overtly 
cotirse aimed at establishing 
China's world hegemony. 
Maoism, more than any other revisionist 
trend, is characterised by rabid anti-Sovietism 
accusing the USSR of capitalist degeneration 
and aggressiveness. As a matter of fact, anti-
Sovietism ensues from the chauvinistic goals. 
In words, the Maoists advocate the most revo-
lutionary aims, while in deeds they pursue a 
reactionary policy. The appeals to fight impe-
rialism are combined with actual flirting with 
imperialist powers, particularly the United 
States, and forming alliances with them against 
the socialist countries. 
The leadership of the Communist Party of 
China has attempted to impose its views on 
other parties. It has set up its own "Marxist-
Leninist communist parties". These "parties" 
arc in a state of crisis or total disintegration. 
However, the task for the communist movement 
to struggle against Maoism remains very 
urgent. 
Erich Honecker, First Secretary of the Cen-
tral Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of 
Germany, emphasised in his Report to the 7th 
Party Congress: "The policies of the Chinese 
leadership keep creating serious obstacles to 
the further consolidation of the unity of the 
socialist states and the entire world communist 
movement, and the union of all anti-imperialist 
forces. The great-power chauvinistic and anti-
Soviet policy pursued by the Mao Tse-tung 
group is spearheaded against all socialist. 
countries and all Marxist-Leninist parties". 
? 
T-I- HE COMMUNIST Party of the Soviet Union, 
I created, educated and hardened by V. I. Lenin 
has always waged a principled struggle 
aimed at enhancing the militancy of the com-
munist movement, consolidating the communist 
ranks on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and 
proletarian internationalism, and surmounting 
all opportunist, revisionist, and 'splitting trends 
and currents. 
The CPSU has most actively participated 
in all international ideological and political 
actions which have enhanced the organisation-
al, revolutionary and transforming influence of 
the communist movement on the historical de-
velopment of modern society. The CPSU was 
one of the initiators and active participants of 
the International Meeting of Communist and 
Workers' Parties held in Moscow in 19(9. 
The Meeting has made an important contri-
bution to consolidating the unity of the 
world communist movement, to further develop-
ing the principles of proletarian international-
ism, overcoming the existing differences in the 
communist movement, and elaborating common 
views on many key problems of our day. The 
Meeting emphasised that the cohesion of the 
communist and workers' parties is a most im-
portant factor in the alliance of all anti-impe-
rialist forces. The Meeting sharply criticised 
the splitting activity of the Maoists in the 
international communist movement, and re-
vealed the fatal consequences of the great-
power chauvinistic, and anti-Soviet stand of 
the CPC leaders. The Meeting denounced na-
tionalism as an ideology and policy which 
feeds various deviations, vacillations and un-
certainties, and is incompatible with Marxism-
Leninism and proletarian internationalism. In 
the course of its work, the Meeting condemned 
Right and "Left" revisionism, and the various 
manifestations of opportunism and dogmatism. 
In addressing the Meeting, Janos Kadar, 
First Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Wor-
kers' Party, said: "We must fight with firmness 
and political courage the different attempts of 
the imperialists to undermine, weaken and 
disunite our ranks. It is necessary to intensify 
the struggle against the bourgeois ideas which 
penetrate into our ranks, against the revisionist 
and dogmatic views which distort the principles 
of Marxism-Leninism and lead people astray". 
An important step aimed at improving the 
ideological arid theoretical arsenal of the com-
munist movement was the Centenary of 
V. I. Lenin's birth, which, both in the USSR 
and throughout the world, was celebrated with 
a view to aiding creative development, enrich-
ing and deepening revolutionary theory. 
The 24th Congress of the CPSU was an 
outstanding event in the life of Soviet Commu-
nists and the entire international communist 
movement. The Congress proved anew that thc 
CPSU was, is, and will continue to be a party

means to be used in strengthening socialism, 
and fostering an economic upsurge, and social 
progress. 
Summarising the latest experience of social-
ist development, the Resolution on the CC 
CPSU Report to the 24th CPSU Congress has 
once again confirmed "the correctness of the 
Leninist tenet that for the successful construc-
tion of socialism it is necessary to proceed 
from the general laws of socialist construction, 
and also to take account of each country's spe-
cific features". The entire work of the Congress, 
as well as the decisions it adopted were a new 
blow at all concepts denying in one way or 
another the dialectics of the international and 
the national and the world significance of the 
CPSU's experience. 
The premises of the Congress concerning 
developed socialist society and the laws govern-
ing its functioning and improvement have been 
further enriched by the theoretical and poli-
tical activity of the communist parties of the 
fraternal countries. At the congresses of the 
fraternal parties of the socialist countries the 
concept of developed socialism has been con-
cretised in accordance with the real and specific 
conditions prevailing in each country and en-
riched with national characteristics. 
The theoretical and political activity of the 
CPSU broadens the initiating revolutionary 
and transforming role of world socialism. At 
every new stage, it more effectively and con-
vincingly proves that the socialist road, as 
scientifically substantiated by Marx, Engels and 
Lenin and as experienced by the Soviet people, 
is the general line of development for all 
mankind, as well as the only way of progres-
sively solving the most acute social problems 
in the interests of the people all over the world, 
The CPSU's contribution to the Marxist-
Leninist theory of developing the world revo-
lutionary process, its driving forces and histo-
rical task of the working class has a great im-
portance for enhancing the militancy and unity 
of the communist movement. The documents of 
the 24th CPSU Congress, which deal with all 
the latest processes show that the International 
working class was and continues to be the only 
force capable of transforming society. 
The working class is the most conscious and 
consistent fighter for the overthrow of the pow-
er of capital, and the genuine creator of social-
ist society. All present attempts of the Right 
and "Left" revisionists to depreciate the role 
played by the working class and minimise its. 
leading role in the present world revolutionary 
process are doomed. 
The Congress stressed that the powerful 
upsurge of the working-class and democratic 
movements reveals that there is evidence of 
impending class battles which may lead to fun-
damental social changes and the establishment 
of working-class power in alliance with the 
other sections of the working people. The 
CPSU has been tirelessly participating in the 
strenuous theoretical work of the communist 
movement which implements Lenin's behest on 
applying the theory of scientific communism to 
the conditions prevailing in countries with a 
backward socio-economic structure. The CPSU 
also takes part in developing the Leninist idea 
of the transition by the peoples of these coun-
tries to socialism, bypassing capitalism. 
During the course of this struggle to find 
the only correct forms of social progress, and 
the strenuous ideological battles, powerful 
blows are delivered at the theories of the 
"Left" extremists, at the Maoists and Trots-
kyists consciously or unconsciously leading 
the peoples of the developing countries to the 
pernicious path which, in the end, brings 
defeat. 
By its political, ideological and organisa-
tional activities the CPSU fosters cohesion of 
the communist ranks. The struggle against re-
visionism is waged on the basis of the creative 
development of Marxism-Leninism, the enrich-
ment of the principles of proletarian interna-
tionalism, the elaboration of a constructive 
and scientifically substantiated programme, 
and its translation into reality.

ANATOMY OF MODERN REVISIONISM 
ALEXANDER SOBOLEV, Ph. D. 
THE Communist and Workers parties are the vanguard of 
social progress, a powerful, organized force with a follow-
ing greater than any other political movement of our time. 
.They guide the constructive labours of the peoples of the 
socialist countries. head the class struggle waged by the in-
tarnational proletariat, and are the leading force of the 
national liberation move.ment. The responsibility that rests on 
'-am for the destinies ol peace, democracy and socialism, for

Hence he importance of struggle against revisionist trends 
and croaps of every shade and hue, of combating the divisive 
machisations anti-Leninist elements out to paralyze the 
activity, VI p the militancy and diminish the fighting capacity 
of the Communist movement. 
Modern revisionism is a complex, multi,faceted phenomenon. 
It eon-Ma-es a variety of trends which, though In many res. 
peck --,sringing from common roots, differ from one another 
as roe lois sncial background, theoretical argurnentation, ide-
olorecal pesitions, organizational forms, the scope of their 
infleenc.e and political activity, and, hence, their role. More-
over, VISigtrif,In has its national features. - 
In the moss then 100 years of Its history, the Communist' 
movcroent has accumulated a wealth of experience in fighting 
the I` ,I?cr el revisionism. This experience has shown that 
oi,Irr cifectivoly to combat opportunist trends a differentiat-
ed approach must he taken to each, and this requires a correct 
under landing of their social roots, ideological essence and po-
lilical role. In some cases ideological struggle on the theoretical 
Orme i3 most effective, in others political and organizational 
action IF needed, and in still others scientifically substantiated 
criticism of mistakes may suffice. 
Ihe political line of the international Communist movement, 
its Marxist-Leninist principles and strategic and tactical plat-
form. and the principles of proletarian internationalism are 
Asnailed and distorted by variety of quarters, namely: 
Pieht.wing revisionist groups and trends of diverse kinds 
which ssek to revise the fundamental Leninist theses con-
terms's! the. universal laws of the socialist revolution and 
soctslist orsanization of society and to replace them with 
abstract utopian piped reams of gradual evolution from 
capitalism to socialism through reform and reactionary 
romancine about the spontaneous development of socialist 
society and the possibliity of qualitatively different models of 
sncialism arising;

? splinter groups that substitute Maoism for Marxism-
Leninism and "drill-ground communism" or scientific 
communism, seek to subordinate the Communist movement to 
the ideological and political hegemony, of Maoism, and work 
to split the ranks of the champions of peace, democracy and 
socialism. 
Pressures are also exerted on the Communist movement by 
various anti-Leninist groups of Trotskyites, anarchists, and the. 
"new Left." 
Besides the openly revisionist trends there are also cam-
ouflaged, ''shamefaced" revisionists, who profess fidelity to 
Marxism/Leninism but ignore its universal internationalist 
essence in propounding their views on the political line, 
strategy and tactics of the Communist movement. They pay lip 
service to the method of Leninism but discard its fundamen-
tal theoretical principles, vow loyalty to proletarian interna-
tionalism but diffuse it in nationalistic hyperbole. 
Bourgeois ideologues make extensive use of the arguments 
advanced by revisionists of all hues to assail the general line 
of the Communist movement, Marxism-Leninism, the Com-
munist Party of the Soviet Union and other truly revolutionary 
parties. 
The opponents of communism harp on the allegedly insur-
mountable differences, dissension rind division in the Communist 
movement, claiming that it is in the throes of crisis and that 
proletarian internationalism has lost to nationalism on the 
battleground of history. Although the facts of life give them 
the lie--witness the growth of the Communist movement 
and the decisive role its influence has come to play in social 
development In our time?it would nevertheless be a mistake 
to underrate the clanger pre.sented by revisionism. 
' Why the Activation 
A cardinal precondition of success in fighting revisionIshs 
Is thorough examination of the factors underlying the riSe and 
spread of its various trends. 
It would be incorrect to attribute the activation of re-
visionism to any ono isolated cause. Every anti-Nfarxist trend 
of course has its social roots, but Right-wing revisionism, 
Left extremism, Maoism, Trotskyism and anarchism, for in-
stance, can hardly be said to stem from a petty-bourgeois 
mentality alone, thaugh it goes without saying that its in-
fluence should not be ignored. 
It k essential to see the social, historical, epistemological, 
and political sources of the various trends, but even more im-
portant is it to explain why they have gained currency. 
"Opportunism Is no chance occurrence, sin, slip, or treach-
ery on the part of individuals, but a social product of an 
entire period of history," Lenin said. 
The causes of the rise and spread of revisionism in general 
and its various trends in particular can be monody grasped 
and explained only in the light of an analysis of the basic 
tendencies in world politics, the sharpening confrontation 
between socialism and capitalism, .the shifts In alignments of

tensity of the Ideoloeical stregele. 
In CX4InInitm the question one must weigh 'a number of 
factors In their complex and fluid interaction. 
Above all it ts necessary to bear In mind the sharpening 
of the confrontation between world socialism and world 
capitalism In all spheres of social life. Although the historical 
initiative ',clones to the forces of socialism, .the monopoly 
boureeoisie Is constantly perfecting its machinery of self-
preservation, seeking in every svay to adapt to the new 
situation and find the social, economic, political and Ideologi-
cal answers to the challenge of sociallsm. 
In the socio-econornIc sphere the monopolies, harnessing the 
scientific and technoloeical revolution to serve their selfish 
ends, on the one hand intensify the exploitation of the 
workers, and on the other make forced conceSsions to the 
fighting working class, concede isolated reforms, and propound 
demagogic policies of social partnership, protit-sharine and the 
like. 
In Ow political sphere they incessantly Modernize the 
system of coercion, seek overtly or covertly to Ruppress the 
revolittionary forces, damp down In every possible way on 
the Communist parties. At the same time, under pressure 
from the rapidly growing activity of the masses, they are 
compelled to preserve and, at times, even to broaden dem-
ocratic freedoms. 
In the aleolegical sphere, hielant anti-commonism and 
anti-Sovleteering, slander of socialism as It eXiSig today, la 
demARoRic.illy Combined with recognition of one or another 
virtue of socialism end attempts to embellish capitalism, to 
discover in it "popular," "democratic" and even "socialist" 
fratiires. Propaoanda of "improved" socialism and concoctions 
miming from tlw convergence concept to all manner of pseudo-
tevolutionary theories have become part of the capitalist 
ideoloeites' stork In trade.. 
In the final nnalysis all the efforts of the monopoly 
bourgeoisie only aegravate the contradictions Of capitalism 
Rod underscore its histerical doom. Yet it would be mistake 
tn Ignore them. flor they Influence the behaviour of social 
strAta and political forces. Among some sections of the work. 
fne pcoplo these complex machinations are capable of eiving 
rise to ithisions, among others, they are apt to heighten 
confusion and the desire artificially to accelerate the march of 
history. In either case they tend to create the soil for the 
emergence and spread of non-Marxist concepts. 
Nor sholild Meld be lost of the fact thnt the need for pro-
reetilation anti forecastIne as conComitants of thci 
scientific and technological revolittion, and the autometion rind 
Mechanizatlen of management lend to rematifiRee the domi? 
mince of the properittel classes and to delude a part of the 
workers into helievine thot the nature of capitalism IS 
chaneing and that it can evolve into socialism. 
The cilect of the. iiitmerical growth of the working elass 
and the structural chances that have taken place In it should 
Also be borne in mind. Even though the dominant historical 
tendency k for the revolutionary role, political activity and 
organized strength of the working class to grow, the inflow 
expandine its ranks comes largely from the middle strata, 
bilneing with it the preconceived concepts and delusions of 
these strata. The structural chanees accompanying technoloei-
cal progress too make the workine class less homogeneous, 
learlIng as they do to a differentiation of Interests among its 
various sections, And not all sectiens of the -working tless 
are at the same level of political Maturity arid ideOlogicat 
clarity, not all are equally class-conscious, oreanized along cleat 
lines, or sell-disciplined. Linder the corrupting influence And 
ideoloeical pressure of the propertied classes, the specific 
interests and outlook of the privileged, and also of the back-
ward, sections of the working class may?and do?breed 
political instability and ideological vacillation in the labour 
movement. 
The constant influx Into the revolutionary liberation move-
ment of ever new. sections of society has its negative aspects 
as well. That more 'and more peasants, intellectuals, clerical 
and service workers and sisiderits are joining the struegle 
against the reactionary policy of the monopoly bourgeoisie, for 
peace, democracy and socialism, is of course testimony le 
steady, Irreversible social progress. But at the same time the 
newcomers bring to -the democratic and liberation movement 
not only a new charge of revolutionary energy, but also 
preconceived notions, not only a burning loathing of cap-
italism, but also utOpian illusions, political waverine, ideolog-
ical Instability. And only too often this finds reflection In the 
emergence of diverse non-Marxist political movements And 
theories. 
It should also be borne in mind that the rapid growth of 
the Communist movement itself is not free of adverse features. 
As a result of the military, moral and political defeat of fasc-
ism, the emergence of the socialist world system. and the, 
crisis of many traditional political parties, the prestige and 
influence of the CoMmunist movement and the numerical 
strength ot 'Communist parties have Increased ereatly. Rot 
while the entry of large numbers of revolutionary-minded 
peasants, clerical workers and intellectuals strengthened the 
parties' ties with the masses. it resulted, wherever ideoloeical 
education was Inadequate, in a lowering of the level of Rs-
Mica! maturity, Ideological. staunchness and theoretical 
grounding of the.membership. 
This beers out, In other conditions and another context, what 
Lenin said In IMO: "One of the most profound causes that per-
iodically give rise to differences over tilttiCS is the very 
growth of the labour movement.. The enlistment of larger 
and larger numbers of new 'recruits,' the attraction of nevr 
sections of the working people must Inevitably be accompa-
nied by wavering In the sphere of theory and tactics, by 
repetition.s of olkl. mistakes, by a temporary reversion to 
antiquated, views and antiquated methods. and so forth. The 
labour movement of every country pericalically? spends a 
varying amount of energy, attentiOn and time on the 'train-
ing' of recruits." 
Oers Is an epoch of struggle by the revolutionary, demo-
cratic forces against national Oppression, Innpoch of the rise. 
development and self-assertion of a growine number of nations 
that were subjected to exploitation and oppresslon. The po-
litical and ideological banner of the fieht these nations rl Tit 
aging for freedom and national Independence Is nationalism, 
various concepts of which have Rained with currency. ilot 
nationalism has two aspects: the national democratic. Pxpins-
sive of the Interests of the working people, and the conserva? 
live. standing for the interests of the propertied classes. 
Moreover, national consciousness Is one of the most complex. 
stable and tenacious forms of social consciousness. 
National consciousness evolves In the process of bitter 
strugele. If the conservative 'aspect prevails, It becomes the 
political and ideological banner of insularity, divides nations and 
sets them one against the other. becomes reactionary and 
degenerates tnto chauvinism. The democratic, popular elements 
can assert themselves and play an Increasingly progressive 
role only if they are transmuted into a .genulne Patriotism or

the. people, socialist patriotism, on the basis of proletarian 
internationalism. Under certain circumstances, however, the 
piessure of nationalism can be extremely great; In many cases 
It penetrates into the labour and even the Communist move-
ment, where It Is hound to coma into Conflict with the 
principles of proletarian internationalism, with the process of 
tho internationalization of the class struggle, and provides a 
fertile soil for the poison weeds of Right and Left revisionism. 
Other factors that tend to animate revisionism are the 
difficulties encountered in building up the revolutionary 
movement and Its slow growth, primarily in the developed 
capitalist countries, as well as the strategic and practical 
mistakes and blunders made by one or another Communist 
party. !fence in some cases it Is the reaction of unstable 
elements to the retarded development of the class struggle, 
an instance of revolutionary impatience, In others it is a matter 
of seizing on difficulties and mistakes in pursuit of ulterior 
ends. And there are also cases that can be traced to both of 
these considerations. 
Modern revisionism can also be a distorted reflection of 
confusion among one or another section of the working people 
In the capitalist as well as the socialist countries in face of 
the formidable tasks involved in building the new society 
and the attendant difficulties, which are accentuated by the 
pronounced unevenness of initial levels of socio-economic 
development. R mirrors the complexity and sharpness of the 
olobal confrontation of socialism and capitalism in the condi-
tions of the scientific and technological revolution. 
Such, then, are the basic objective and subjective causes of 
the rise of revisionist trends. These causes do not operate in 
isolation from one another, but neither can they be regarded 
as the mechanical sum of diverse factors. They are in complex 
dialectical interrelation with one another, an interrelation that 
varies depending on the concrete situation, the national back-
wound of the given country, and the specific features of 
the activity rpf the given Communist party. In some instances 
Rieht-wing revisionism comes to the fore, in others Leftist 
distortion of Marxist-Leninist theory and practice. 
Behind the Screen of Pluralism 
The political and ideological concepts of Right and Left 
revisionism often appear to be diametrically opposed to each 
ether, and within each of these trends too there are different 
shades of opinion. But in the course of the political and 
oteateleical struegle points of contact between them are in-
creesinely revealed. It becomes more and more obvious that 
the fundamental methodological and theoretical tenets of all 
varieties of contemporary iswisionism coincide. 
The prime common denominator is denial of the universal, 
Intermitional significance of Marxism-Leninism, of the laws 
eovernine the world revolutionary process and socialist de-
velopment discovered by Marxism-Leninism. The hallmark 
of all revisionists is anti-dialectical mode of thought, meta-
phrkal absolulization of some aspects and phenomena of 
social life, rejection of the dialectical link between the in-
ternational find the national. This logically leads to denial of 
the international sienificance of the experience of the CPSU 
and other Communist parties. At the same time they maintain 
that the. International Communist movement needs no general 
line, that such a line is not viable, and that unity of its po-
litical, strateeie end tactical principles can be dispensed with, 
Contrary to the impend Internationalist Marxist-Leninist 
doctrine and methodolciey, find at variance with the established 
practice M the international Communist .movement, both Right 
and Left revisionists propound pluralism, 
The modern revisionists advocate social pluralism. Distorting 
the Leninist thesis concerning the diversity of the paths ol 
revolutionary transition to socialism rind forms of Hocialist 
organization of society, they claim that there can brt a variety 
of models of socialism qualitatively different from one enuth-
er, different not only as regards form but also as reeards 
content. It is a stock argument of both overt and covert TOVI? 
sionists that all existing "models of socialism" have evolved cm 
the basis of a backward economy and hence allegedly bear the 
Imprint of historical "inadequacy." In their opinion the victory 
of socialism in the developed capitalist countries will at 
once change the outward features as well as the substance of 
socialism. 
Needless to say, the further development of socialism, the 
growth of the strength of the socialist 'world system, will 
steadily improve the historical setting for the transition of 
more and more countries to socialism, make this transition 
less painful. But as experience arid Marxist-Leninist therm/ 
show, this will be a matter of the further operation of tho 
general laws, not of their negation. 
The modern revisionists advocate political pluralism. In 
their opinion, the dictatorship of the proletariat. and the 
experience of the socialist countries in the organization of ' 
political life have outlived their time and should be succeed-
ed by spontaneous development and coinpetitive struggle 
among all social and political forces, all political parties, 
which in effect signifies abandoning the use of the instru-
ments at the disposal of the working class organized as the 
state to uphold the people's revolutionary gains. At a time 
when the monopoly bourgeoisie is steadily building up the 
machinery of its domination, its political mechanism of self-
preservation, the revisionists deny the people and their leader,; 
the working class, the right to suppresis the resistance of thel 
exploiters. 
The modern revisionists advocate ideological pluralism. Ne- ? 
Ration or ,the universal, international character of Marxism-
Leninism is accompanied with the claim that there exist differ-
ent, national forms of Marxism. At the same time it is 
maintained that equal and competitive. co-existence of diverse 
ideological concepts is possible in the working-class move-
ment and the socialist society. 
All varieties of revisionism find political expression in 
anti-Sovieteering, bellicose anti-communism, and divisive 
activity in the ranks of the Communist movement. 
While rioting the common groundwork on which the 
theoretical-cognitive and methodological principles and po-
litical views of all modern revisionists rest, it is essential 
also to have a clear idea of the specific argumentation 
advanced by the Right and the Leftist trends and the degree 
of danger they present at different staees of the struggle, 
in different countries, and in different historical conditiuns, 
, The Right Revisionists 
Right-wing revisionism remains a serious threat to the 
Communist parties' capacity lor action and the tinily of 
their ranks. Piominent among its most active theorists and 
propagandists are Roger Garaudy (France), Ernst Fischer and 
Franz Merck (Aus(ria), n group, of theolizers associated with 
the journal Praxis (Yugoslavia), O. Sik and K. Kosik. Thuile!)

The Right revisionists seek to recast the fundamental prin. 
doles of the ftlarxist-Lcsninist outlook. They reject Leninisrn. 
which they claim k a variant of tstarxism confined to Russia 
alone. The philosophical works of Lenin and Uneels, they 
argiir, "misitirressdit" the teachings of Marx, anti socialism 
exists today they label a "bureancratic.etatist" distortion 
01 thn Marxist doolinc. of humane socialism. This offensive 
ngainst the substance of Marxist theory is waeed on the 
pretext of "TV-41.111ine the real views of Marx, moreover, the 
views of thr^ young Marx, by removing the "later theoretical 
and practical accretions." 
The Right revisiimisls deny the revolutionary role of the 
working class In the reconstinction of society, malnlaining 
that, as cl result of tile technological revolution, It is being clit. 
fused In the general mass of working people directly 
or indirectly connected with production. In this way the 
leading role of the working class in the fight for socialism 
k disposed of. Garaudy, for instance, advances the idea of 
what he calls a "historical bloc"?a bloc of the workers and 
initAlectissis with the latter playing the leading role. 
? The Right-wing revisionists reject the scientific theory and 
pradtice of socialism, counterposing to them the concept 
of a socialism governed by the blind forces of the Market, 
What this concept so zealously championed by Sik, Garaudy, 
Fischer and other revisionists leads to was convincingly shown 
by what happened In Czechoslovakia. The latest facts offer 
incontrovertible proof that any kind of blind operation of 
economic forces Is bound to have grave social consequences. 
In both theory and practice the Right revisionists often find 
themselves In the same camp with the reformists, who believe 
In spontaneous evolution leading to socialism. The fallacy of 
this concept has been amply proved by the historical -ex. 
perience of the working class, yet for the Objective and 
silbjective reasons mentioned above It still has Its supporters 
and seriously impedes the mobilization of the masses to the 
struggle for peace, democracy, national freedom, and socialism. 
The Lett Extremists 
The need to combat Left revisionism in all its manifestationS 
is as urgent as ever. Its basic premises-.-negatIon of the 
objective laws governing the class struggle, the development 
of the rovoliition, rind organization of socialist society, denial 
of the revointionary mission of the working class and the van. 
guard role nf he. Communist parties, anti-Sovietism, nnti-com-
tnimism. and nMionnlism?do not differ In principle from 
those of tlw Right-wing revisionists. What is specific to the 
Left revisionists dle non-scientific voluntarist and subjectivist 
concepts of revolution, tactics, forms and methods of struggle. 
1-he Slanifesto group in Italy and the Teodore Petkoff group 
In Vrnezueln are to one or another extent exponents of Left 
revisionist views. Left extremism determines also the political 
course of the Communist Party of Burma (the "White Flag" 
party) which, operating In the jungles, has for a long time 
nnw beer% tvagine an armed struggle against the democratic 
government. 
In a ntimisrsr of countries Left revisionism is represented by 
small eroupings raneing from the 5ectadan-dogmadc to the 
revolutionary.adventurist. Some have appropriated the name 
of the Indomitable Latin American revolutionary Che Guevara 
and 'have sot up detachments which call for immediate. 
essentially adventuristtc armed actions without regard for the 
mood of the masses., rir the concrete situation. In Ceylon, for 
Instance. such self-styled "Gitevarists" played a central role in 
the reactionary armed uprising against the democratic forces. 
in some countries there are smell but extremely agerevave 
parties that call themselves "Marxist-Leninist" and seek to 
implant in the workers movement tho ideas, policy and 
tactic's of Maoism. As for Maoism, It is a trend of a specific 
order, which, like the present-day Trotskyttes who Seek to 
infiltrate the revolutionary working-class movement, merits 
special examination. 
The Left extremists underestimate the role of the objective 
conditions in the preparation and carrying out of revolutionary 
changes, and overestimate the subjective factors, the role of 
volition. For them politics Is the Demiurge of history. They 
underrate the role of the masses in the revolution and tbe. 
need to prepare them, and regard the actions of small isolsted 
armed detachments as decisive. They ignore all other forms 
and methods of struggle against the reaction, of rallying the 
masses to active struggle, and rely exclusively on armed force. 
Yet among them there are a great many who are eager to 
come to grips with the oppressors, ready to lay down their 
lives for the revolution, people who sincerely believe that 
isolated armed actions can bring success, but who are captive 
to the most confused revisionist and often anti-Communist 
illusions. To be real revolutionary fighters what these people 
need, besides enthusiasm, is clarity of perpose, political con-
sciousness. 
The Fight Against Revisionism 
The fight against Right and Left revisionism, against the 
nationalists and Maoists that have tacked themselves on to the 
international Communist movement, aeainst the Trotskyites 
and anarchists, is not an end in itself for the Communist 
parties. It is not a matter of intolerance, or a doctrinaire 
striving for abstract purity of theoretical dogma, as 61111-
Marxists of every hue claim in their efforts to slander the 
Communists and mislead the masses. 
For historical and social purport, the fight against revision-
ism in theory and opportunism In practice, against all manner 
..of ideoloeical wavering and political vacillation, iS a fight 
to win the masses. It is a component of a political strategy 
projected towards tinning the working people of town and 
country, manual and mental workers, on a revolutionary plat? 
form with the aim of resolving the most pressing social prob-
lems?strengthening pe.ace, giving effect to consistent democ-
racy. ensuring national prosperity and social progress. It is 
a component of revolutionary lectica designed to Map the 
mnsses master the most effective forms, methods and means 
of anti-Imperialist and anti-monopoly struggle, to ensure the 
ideological and political defeat of all who consciously or un-
consciously deceive the masses. doom them to wander aimlessly 
in the labyrinths of history and prevent them from channel-
ling all their class energy to the defeat of the reaction. 
The political effectiveness of struggle against all valieties 
of opportunism depends primarily on being able to </div></div></div>  </div>
