 VIETNAM AND THE NEW
 ISOLATIONISM
 THE NEW ISOLATIONISM
 Mir. DODD. Mr. President, there has
 been developing in this country in recent
 years a brand of thinking about foreign
 affairs which, I believe, can aptly be de-
 scribed as "the new isolationism." This
 internal phenomenon is, in my opinion,
 potentially more disastrous in terms of
 its consequence than the major external
 problems that confront.us.
 Its background is a growing national
 weariness with cold war burdens we have
 been so- long carrying, a rising frustra-?
 tion with, situations, that are going
 against us in many places? a long-sim-
 mering indignation over the fact that our
 generosity and"eaeriflce. have too often
 I worldwide involvement, should be hum-
 ,'bled and "cut down to size" and stripped
 of their influence in foreign policy
 questions.
 In my judgment all of these proposi-
 tions have one thing in common.  Each
 of them would strike at the heart of our
 national effort to preserve our freedom:
 and our security; and collectively they
 add up to a policy which I can describe
 by no other name. than "appeasement,"
 subtle appeasement, unintentional ap-
 peasement, to be sure, but appeasement
 nonetheless.
 My purpose, this afternoon then, Is to
 oppose these propositions and to enlist
 Senators' . opposition against them--for
 the new isolationism is as bankrupt as
 Irlrst'of all-to tackle the main preim-.
 is" reject the assumption that the
 03aq_,7
 United :'Mates is overextended, or over-
 committe::d, or overinvolved.
 We are enjoying a spectacular growth
 in every Index of national strength.
 Our population, our wealth, our indus-
 trial capacity, our scientific potential,
 our agricultural output, all are enjoying
 great upward surges.  We were informed
 that our gross national product was
 again up iri January, and the trend seems
 ever upward.
 Far front overextending ourselves In
 the cold war, we are actually in a period
 of declining defense budgets, of steadily
 lowered draft calls, of sharply reduced
 foreign aid, of one tax cut after another.
 Let me emphasize this: In every basic
 resource, we have greater capacity today
 than during the past 5 years; by every
 military or economic standard, we are
 stronger; and by every physical measure-
 ment, the percentage of our resources
 going into the cold war is lower.  'hy
 then should we talk of weariness or over.-
 commitment?
 We are not even straining ourselves.
 We are actually pursuing today a policy
 not only of both guns and butter, but of
 less guns and more butter.
 So far as our resources go, we are
 capable of indefinite continuation and
 even intensification of our present ef-
 forts, if need be.  It is only our mental,
 and perhaps our moral, resources which
 seem to be feeling the strain.
 We would, of course, prefer to live in a
 world in which it were possible for us to
 have no commitments, a world in which
 we could devote all of our energies to
 the task of perfecting our society at
 home and enriching the lives of our peo-
 ple.
 But we must face the world as it is.
 And the basic fact of our world is that
 Western civilization, itself terribly rent
 and divided, both politically and philo-
 sophically, has been forced into a twi-
 light war of survival by a relentless and
 remorseless enemy.
 It is incontestable, in terms of peoples
 enslaved and nations gobbled up over
 the past 20 years, that we have not been
 holding our own.  And each year, the
 world Communist movement is com...
 matting more and more of its resources
 to the task of subjugating our allies, all
 around the perimeter of freedom.
 Against this background it is prepos-
 terous to maintain that we should reduce
 our effort and lessen our commitment to
 the great struggle of our century.
 Yet, according to Time magazine, it
 is the widespread sentiment of the aca-
 demic world that we have overreached
 ourselves and ought to pull back.  Walter
 Lippmann, the well-known columnist,
 for whom I have great respect, says that
 "the American tide will have to recede."
 It has been argued that we would be in
 a "precarious situation" if we were at-
 tacked on several fronts.  Of course we.
 would, but does anyone believe that we
 can solve the problem by abandoning
 our, commitments and defensive alli-
 ances?  Would the loss of these coun-
 tries. be any the less disastrous because
 they were given up undefended?
 On the contrary, if we are not strong
 enough to honor, our commitments to-
 day, them we should solve the problem?

 percentage cuts in our defense budget,
 cuts not directed to any specific econ-
 omy, but rather to a principle-the prin-
 ciple that we should be spending less on
 defense and more on welfare.
 Here, In my judgment, are sure-
 fire formulas for defeat.
 Where are the victories In the cold
 war' that would justify such a reversal
 of priorities?  In what global trouble
 spots are there lessened tensions or im-
 proved Postures that would make this
 plausible?  i can see a lot of Cold war
 areas where things are looking worse-
 but Very few Where things are getting
 bMtls?.
 . More effort, more sacrifice-not less-
 is the need of our time. And I speak as
 one who does not disparage the need or
 the importance of domestic improve-
 ments. As a credential of this I recom-
 mend to Senators my scorecard, com-
 piled last year by the ultraconservative
 Americans for Constitutional Action,
 which asserts that I voted right only 13
 percent of the time-one of the worst
 records, alas, in the Congress.
 But I say to you that if our foreign
 affairs are going badly, no aspect of
 internal welfare is secure or stable. And
 if we cope successfully with the great
 problem, the cold war, no internal prob-
 lem can long defy solution.
 Our first national priority is and must
 ever be the survival of our country and
 our freedom-and if the 20th century
 has taught men anything, it is that sur-
 vival and freedom cannot be purchased
 on the cheap, in a discount store or a
 'bargain basement.
 But our situation Is such that we can
 meet our needs both at home and
 abroad-not as handsomely as we would
 prefer, but well enough.  This I take to
 be the objective of the Johnson adminis-.
 tration.  The war on poverty and the
 struggle against tyranny can go hand in
 hand, if our vision be broad.
 Twenty-five years ago, our country,
 comparatively new and untried among
 the great nations of the earth, through
 passage of the Lend-Lease Act, described
 by Winston Churchill as "the most un-
 sordid act of recorded history," em-
 barked irrevocably upon the path that
 has brought us to our present posture in
 history.  Through that act, we affirmed
 the preservation and expansion of liber-
 ty as our highest goal; we acknowledged
 that freedom was insecure everywhere so
 long as tyranny existed anywhere; and
 we assumed the burden, and the glory,
 of being the champion and defender of
 man's highest aspirations.
 Since that embattled hour, when the
 light of freedom was but a flicker in the
 dark, our journey across the pages of his-
 tory has been fantastic and unprece-
 dented: tragic, to be sure, in its mistakes
 and naivities, but heroic in its Innova-
 tions and commitments, prodigious in its
 energy and power, gigantic in its gen-
 erosity and good will, noble in its re-
 straint and patience, and sublime in Its
 purpose and in its historic role.
 We have not realized the high goals
 we set for ourselves in World War II.
 But we have preserved freedom and
 national independence in more than half
 the earth; we have prevented the nu-
 clear holocaust; we have restored West-
 ern Europe; we have helped friend and
 foe to achieve prosperity, freedom and
 stability; we have launched a world peace
 organization and have kept it alive; we
 have offered the hand of friendship and
 help to the impoverished and backward
 peoples of the World if they will but
 take it.
 It may be said of our country today,
 as of no other in history, that wherever
 people are willing to stand up in defense
 of their liberty. Americans stand with
 them.
 We cannot know at this hour whether.
 our Journey has Just begun or is nearing
 its climax; whether the task ahead is the
 work of a generation, or of a century.
 President Kennedy said, In his Inaugural
 Address, that the conflict would not be
 resolved in our lifetime.
 The Chief of Staff of the Army recently
 told the Congress that it might well take
 10 years to decide the issue in Vietnam
 alone.  And Vietnam is only one symp-
 tom of the disease, the epidemic, we are
 resisting.
 Against this somber background, how
 foolish it is to talk of deemphasizing the
 cold war, of pulling out of Vietnam, of
 abandoning the Congo to Communist
 intrigue, of slashing the defense budget
 by 10 percent, or of any of the other ir-
 responsibilities of the new isolationism.
 VIETNAM
 It is against this background that I
 take up today the question of Vietnam,
 which has been the favorite target of
 those who urge withdrawal and re-
 trenchment.
 Over the past several months, a num-
 ber of my most respected colleagues have
 taken the floor to urge that we get out of
 Vietnam or that we enter into negotia-
 tions over Vietnam.
 The propriety of our presence In Viet-
 nam and the validity of our position has
 been challenged. It has even been sug-
 gested that we are the real aggressors in
 Vietnam. The war has been called "Mc-
 Nalxiara's War."  It has been suggested
 that we more or less ignore Asia and
 Africa` and concentrate on Europe and
 the Americas.
 I have listened with growing dismay
 to these presentations-anal with all the
 more dismay because of the respect and
 affection I have for the Senators who
 made them.
 If I have not risen to reply to my
 colleagues before now, It was not be-
 caut,e Vietnam was a new subject to me,
 but because I felt that their arguments
 required the most carefully considered
 and most painstakingly prepared reply.
 I had visited most of the countries
 of southeast Asia in early 1961, and I
 have spoken a number of times on the
 floor of the Senate on the subject of
 Vietnam and Laos and Indonesia since
 my return.  I have endeavored to keep
 up with the situation in that part of the
 world as best one can do by reading
 the press and official publications.  But
 I realized that there were important gaps
 in my information because the press cov-
 erage of Vietnam was, with a few out-
 standing exceptions, weak and in some
 cases .Completely misleading. , I have,
 therefore, sought to fill these gaps by
 correspondence with friends in Vietnam,
 both Vietnamese and American, and by
 conversations with Americans who have
 served in Vietnam in various capacities-
 some of them for long periods of time.
 The senior Senator from Wyoming
 [Mr. MCGEE]  and the senior Senator
 from Oklahoma [Mr. MONRONRY] on the
 one side, and the distinguished minority
 leader, the junior Senator from Illinois
 [Mr. IDIRKBEN] and the senior Senator
 from ..Massachusetts [Mr., SAL'roJssTALL]
 have already spoken eloquently on the
 need for.. standing fast In Vietnam..

 not be reducing our commitments, but
 by becoming stronger, and by aiding our
 allies to become stronger.
 The defense of the free world rests on
 a very delicate balance.  The key ele-
 ments in that balance are American
 power and American determination.  If
 we. lack the power to maintain that bal-
 ance then certainly all is lost.  If we
 reveal that we lack the determination, if
 we, for instance, allow ourselves to be
 pushed out of Vietnam, such a humilia-
 tion may indeed be the second shot heard
 around the world; and a dozen nations
 `might soon throw in the sponge and
 make  whatever  accommodation  they
 could with an enemy that would then
 seem assured of victory.
 Fortunately, at the present time we do
 not lack the power to carry on the de-
 fense of freedom.  Our power is at its
 peak and we have the capacity to in-
 crease it vastly If necessary.  It is our
 spirit, apparently, that needs shoring up.
 Four years ago, after a visit to south-
 east Asia, I said on the floor of the
 Senate:
 If the United States, with its unrivaled
 might,'with its unparalleled wealth, with its
 dominion over sea and air, with its heritage
 as the champion of freedom-if this United
 States and its free world allies have so di-
 minished in spirit that they can be laid in
 the dust by a few thousand primitive guer-
 rillas, then we are far down the road from
 which there is no return.
 In right and in might, we are able to work
 our will on this question.  Southeast Asia
 cannot be lost unless we will it to be lost;
 it cannot be saved unless we will- It to be
 saved.
 This problem, seemingly so remote and
 distant, will in fact be, resolved here in the
 United States, in the Congress, in the ad-
 ministration, and in the minds and hearts
 of the American people.        I
 The passage of 4 years has not dimin-
 ished my belief in this course.
 If the main premise of the new isola-
 tionism is erroneous, then surely the
 lesser premises are fraught with terrible
 1danger.
 It is argued that we should de-
 emphasize the cold war and turn more
 of our resources to domestic welfare.
 The  annual  congressional  revolt
 against the foreign aid bill grows more
 violent and successful each year, and-the
 administration, 'forced to yield, now
 sends foreign aid requests 40 percent
 below what it solemnly declared 2 years
 ago to be the minimum figure tolerable
 for free world survival.
 And a small but growing band of
 Senators have begun offering each year

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                      3269
 A debate has been joined which is
 worthy of the best traditions of the
 Senate.
 I hope that the remarks I make today
 will contribute at least in some measure,
 to the further unfolding of this debate.
 Out of this debate, let us hope, will ulti-
 mately emerge the kind of assistance and
 guidance that every President must have
 in dealing with vital Issues of our for-
 eign policy.
 'What we say here may help to guide
 the President. But in the final analysis
 the terrible responsibility of decision is
 his and his alone. He must listen to the
 exchanges which take place in this
 Chamber.  He must endure a hundred
 conflicting pressures from public sources,
 seeking to push him in this direction
 or that.  He must also endure the im-
 patience of those who demand answers
 to complex questions today, and who
 accuse him of not having made the
 American position clear when he has in
 fact made our position abundantly clear
 on repeated occasions.
 And finally, when all the voices have
 been heard, when he has examined all
 the facts, when he has discussed all as-
 pects of the situation with his most
 trusted advisers, the President must alone .
 decide-for all Americans and for the
 entire free world-what to do about
 Vietnam.
 No President has ever inherited a more
 difficult situation on coming to office.
 No President has ever been called upon
 to make a decision of greater moment.
 At stake may be the survival of freedom.
 At stake may be the peace of the world.
 I believe the United States can count
 itself fortunate that it has found a Presi-
 dent of the stature of Lyndon B. Johnson
 to meet this crisis in its history. I also,
 believe that, whatever differences we in
 this Chamber may have on the question
 of Vietnam, our feelings to a man are
 with the President in the ordeal of deci-
 sion through which he is now passing.
 I have said that I have been dismayed
 by the rising clamor for a negotiated
 settlement.  In the type of war which
 the Communists are now waging against
 us, I fear that, although those who urge
 negotiation would be among the first to
 oppose an outright capitulation, their at-
 titude may not be construed in this way
 by the Communists.
 The Vietnamese war, in the Commu-
 nist lexicon, is described as a "war of
 national liberation."  Its strategy Is
 based on the concept of what the Coln-
 munists call "the long war." This strat-
 egy is premised upon the belief that the
 free  world  lacks  the  patience,  the
 stamina, the fanatical determination to
 persist, which inspires the adherents of
 communism. It is based on the convic-
 tion that if the Communists keep on at-
 tacking and attacking and attacking in
 any given situation, they will ultimately
 be able to destroy the morale and the will
 to resist of those who oppose than in the
 name of freedom..
 China affords the classic example of
 the long war. It took 20 years for Mao
 Tse-tung to prevail. There were several
 times during this period when his entire
 movement seemed on the verge of ool-
 lapse.  But, even; in his blackest days,
 Mao Tse-tung remained confident that,
 if he persevered, ultimately his enemies
 would crack and he would emerge as
 China's undisputed ruler.
 There is no more cruel test of courage
 and staying power than "the long war"
 as it is waged by the Communists. Five
 years, 10 years, 20 years, means nothing
 to them.  And if they detect any sign
 that those opposed to them are flagging,
 that their patience is growing thin or
 that their will to resist has weakened, the
 Communists can be relied upon to re-
 double their efforts, In the belief that vic-
 tory is within their grasp.
 I disagree strongly with my colleagues
 who have spoken up to urge negotiations.
 But If there is any way in which my
 voice could reach to Peiping and to Mos-
 cow, I would warn the Communist lead-
 ers that they should not construe the
 debate that Is now taking place in this
 Chamber as a sign of weakness; it is,
 on the contrary, a testimony to our
 strength.
 Nor should they believe that those who
 speak up in favor of negotiations are the
 forerunners of a larger host of Ameri-
 cans who are prepared to accept sur-
 render.  Because there is no one here
 who believes in surrender or believes in
 capitulation. I believe the senior Sena-
 tor from.Idaho made this abundantly
 clear in his own presentation, in which
 he underscored his complete support for
 the retaliatory air strikes against North
 Vietnam.
 WHY ARE WE IN VIETNAM?
 I have been amazed by a number of
 letters I have received, asking the ques-
 tion, "Why are we in- Vietnam?" or
 "What is our policy in Vietnam?" I have
 been even more amazed to have the same
 questions put ? to me by sophisticated
 members of the press.
 To me the reasons for our presence in
 Vietnam are so crystal clear that I find
 it difficult to comprehend the confusion
 which now appears to exist on this sub-
 ject.
 We are in Vietnam because our own
 security and the security of the entire
 free world demands that a firm line be
 drawn against the further advance of
 Communist  imperialism--in  Asia,  in
 Africa, in Latin America, and in Europe.
 We are in Vietnam because it is our
 national interest to assist every nation,
 large and small, which is seeking to de-
 fend itself against Communist subver-
 sion, infiltration, and aggression. There
 is nothing new about this policy; it is a
 policy, in fact, to which every admin-
 istration has adhered since the procla-
 mation of the Truman doctrine.
 We are in Vietnam because our as-
 sistance was invited by the legitimate
 government of that country.
 We are in Vietnam because, as the dis-
 tinguished majority leader, the Senator
 from Montana [Mr. MANSFIELD], pointed
 out in his 1963 report, Chinese Cominu-
 'nist hostility  to the United  States
 threatens "the whole structure of our
 own security in the Pacific."
 We are in Vietnam not merely to help
 the 14 million South Vietnamese defend
 themselves against communism, but be-
 cause what is at stake is, the Independ- '
 ence and freedom of 240 million people
 in southeast Asia and the future of free-
 dom throughout the western Pacific.
 These are the reasons why we are in
 Vietnam.  There is nothing new about
 them and nothing very complex.  They
 have never been obscure.  They have
 never been concealed.. I cannot, for the
 life of me, see why people fail to under-
 stand them.
 IS THERE A POSSIBILITY Or A NEGOTIATED
 SETTLEMENT?
 The senior Senator from Idaho, and
 several other Senators who spoke last
 Wednesday, repeated the proposal that
 we should seek negotiations for the pur-
 pose of terminating .the bloodshed in
 Vietnam and of avoiding an enlarge-
 ment of the war. We are told by some
 people that negotiations are the way of
 diplomacy and that if we reject negotia-
 tions now, we are in effect rejecting
 diplomacy.
 The proposal that we negotiate now
 overlooks the fact that there does exist
 a negotiated agreement on Vietnam, ap-
 proved by the participants of the Geneva
 Conference of 1964.  The final declara-
 tion of this agreement read, and I think
 it R9 worth while reading it for the REC-
 oaD and for our own recollection:
 Each member * * * undertakes to respect
 the sovereignty, the independence, the unity,
 and the territorial integrity of the above-
 mentioned states and to refrain from any
 interference in their internal affairs.
 Since there is no point to negotiating
 if it simply means reiterating the Gene-
 va agreement, I cannot help wondering
 whether those who urge negotiations en-
 visage rewriting the agreement so that
 it does not "guarantee the territorial in-
 tegrity of the above-mentioned states."
 The history of negotiated agreements
 with the Communists underscores the
 fact that their promises are worthless
 and that only those agreements have
 validity which  are self-enforcing  or
 which we have the power to enforce. A
 report issued by the Senate Subcommit-
 tee on Internal Security---on which I
 have the honor to serve-establishes that
 the Soviet Union has since its inception
 violated more than 1,000 treaties and
 agreements.  The Communists have re-
 peatedly violated the terms of the Ko-
 rean armistice, of the Geneva agreement
 on Vietnam, and of the Laotian armis-
 tice.
 Incidentally, I had hoped the Senator
 from Idaho [Mr. CHURCH] would be pres-
 ent.  He had hoped to be here.  He is
 tied. up on another matter, but hopes to
 get here later.
 The Senator from Idaho has held up
 the Laotian armistice as an example of
 a rational agreement with the Commu-
 nists that has served our interests.  He
 could not possibly have picked a worse
 illustration for his argument.
 I can think of no more dramatic proof
 than the Laotian armistice that agree-
 ments with the Communists are worth-
 less, and that every time-we try to escape
 from today's unpleasantness by entering
 into a new covenant with an implacable
 aggressor, we are always ,confronted on,
 the "morrow by unpleasantness cm
 pounded 10 times over.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE              February 2,
 I traveled through southeast Asia just
 before the conclusion of the Laotian
 armistice.
 I talked to many people at that time.
 It is true that the armistice was favored
 by our Ambassador in Laos, and it ob-
 viously must have had the support of
 important members of the State Depart-
 ment hierarchy.  But the personnel of
 our Embassies in Saigon and in Bangkok
 did not conceal from me their grave ap-
 prehensions over the consequences of
 such an armistice 'for Vietnam and
 southeast Asia.
 All of this I reported on confidentially
 upon my return.
 At that time, the Saigon government
 still controlled the situation throughout
 most of the countryside, although the
 115,000 Vietcong guerrillas were giving it
 increasing difficulty.  Our Embassy per-
 sonnel in Saigon expressed the fear that
 the conclusion of the Laotian armistice
 would enable the Communists to infil-
 trate men and material on a much larger
 scale and would result at an early date
 in a marked intensification of the Viet-
 cong insurgency.  Needless to say, the
 apprehensions which they expressed to
 me have been completely borne out by
 subsequent developments.
 The Laotian armistice has served Laos
 itself as poorly as it has served the cause
 of freedom in Vietnam.  The Commu-
 nists have continued to nibble away at
 what is left of free Laos, in one aggres-
 sive act after another, so that by now
 they firmly control more than half the
 country, while their infiltress and guer-
 rillas are gnawing relentlessly at govern-
 ment authority  in the rest of the
 country.
 In mid-1964, I asked the Library of
 Congress to prepare for me a study of
 Communist violations of the Laotian
 armistice agreement.  The study which
 they submitted to me listed 14 specific
 violations up until that time.
 That was last year. There have been
 .many more since then.
 Mr. President, I plan to insert into the
 RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks
 a copy of the survey of Communist vio-
 lations of the Laotian armistice prepared
 for me by the Library of Congress.  I
 earnestly hope the Senator from Idaho
 will take the time to study this before
 he once again holds up the Lootian armi-
 stice as a model for Vietnam.
 I should also like to quote from a
 statement made on March 30, 1963, by
 Gen. Kong Le, the neutralist military
 commander who, as is common knowl-
 edge, had favored the conclusion of the
 Laotian armistice. Kong Le's statement
 is significant because it illustrates how
 Communists will deal tomorrow with
 non-Communist elements that they are
 prepared to accept into coalition gov-
 ernments today.
 Referring  to  certain  Communist
 stooges, Gen. Kong Le said:
 Despite their 'continual defeats, however,
 'these people learned their lessons from their
 Communist Tosses. I * * When the Prime
 Minister went abroad, they moved rapidly to
 destroy.. the neutralist forces.  They used
 tricks to provoke the soldiers and people to
 overthrgw Colonel 1 etsana.  When these did
 not succeed, oh February 12 they used an as-
 main to murder Ketsana. They also savage-
 ly killed or arrested all neutralist party
 members, and their bloody hands caused the
 death of many people.
 This  was  the statement  of  Gen.
 Kong Le, one of those who had pressed
 the hardest for the Laotian armistice
 when he saw what the armistice did to
 his country.
 Finally, I do not believe that the Lao-
 tian armistice has served the interests
 of the other peoples of southeast Asia.
 I have in my possession a map of north-
 ern Laos showing areas where the Chi-
 nese Communists have been building
 roads that would give China direct ac-
 cess to the borders of Burma and Thai-
 land.                                                    The construction of these roads
 bodes ill for the future peace of south-
 east Asia.  That they are intended for
 future military use is taken for granted
 by everyone in the area.
 So much for the example of the Lao-
 tian armistice.
 All this does not mean to say that we
 must not under any circumstances enter
 into negotiations with the Communists.
 I do not suggest that at all.  It simply
 means that when we do so, we must do
 so with our eyes open and with a clear
 understanding of the ingredients re-
 quired to enforce compliance with the
 agreement about to be entered into.
 That is all I have ever urged. .
 Moreover; there is a time to negotiate
 and a time not to negotiate.
 The demand that we negotiate now
 over Vietnam is akin to asking Churchill
 to negotiate with the Germans at the
 time of Dunkirk, or asking Truman to.
 negotiate with the Communists when
 we stood with our backs to the sea in the
 Pusan perimeter in Korea.  In either
 case, the free world could have negoti-
 ated nothing but total capitulation.
 The situation in Vietnam is probably
 not as desperate and certainly no more
 desperate, than Britain's plight at the
 time of Dunkirk or our own plight at
 the time of Pusan.  If we are of good
 heart, if we refuse to listen to the coun-
 sels of despair, if we again resolve that
 'we will never give in"-as Churchill
 put it-there is every reason to be con-
 fident that a time will arrive when we
 can negotiate with honor and for a more
 acceptable objective than a diplomatic
 surrender.
 There are those who say that the
 whole of southeast Asia will, whether
 we like it or not, go Communist. These
 people are at least consistent in urging
 negotiations how.  But anyone who be-
 lieves that we can negotiate now and
 not lose Vietnam to communism is de-
 luding himself in the worst possible way.
 THE CONSEQUENCES OIL' DEFEAT IN VIETNAM
 It is human to oppose the cost of stay-
 ing on in Vietnam when American boys
 are dying in a faraway land about
 which we understand very little.  I am
 conscious of this.  I am sensitive to it.
 I share the troubled minds of all Sena-
 tors. But I am convinced that the great
 majority of those who advocate that we
 abandon Vietnam to communism, either
 by pulling out or by "negotiating" a set-
 tlement, have not taken the time to
 weigh the consequences of defeat.
 In mar opinion, the consequences of an.
 American defeat if? Vietnam would be
 so catastrophic that we simply cannot
 permit ourselves to think of it.  This is
 truly an "unthinkable thought," to use
 an expression coined by the Senator
 from Arkansas. He was not applying it
 to this problem, I point out, but I find
 the words particularly apt in reference
 to Vietnam.
 GENOCIDE
 For the Vietnamese people, the first
 consequence would be a bloodletting on
 a genocidal scale.
 In the Soviet Union and in Red China,
 tens of millions of "class enemies" were
 eliminated by the victorious Communists.
 While it is true that there are some
 slightly more moderate Communist re-
 gimes in certain countries, Vietnamese
 communism is characterized by utter
 disregard for human life of Stalinism
 and Maoism.  What will happen to the
 more than 1 million refugees from North
 Vietnam?  What will happen to the mil-
 lions of peasants who resisted or bore
 arms against the Vietcong.  I shudder
 to think of it. The massacre of inno-
 cents in Vietnam will be repeated in every
 southeast Asian country that falls to
 communism in its wake, in a gigantic
 bloodletting that will dwarf the agony
 and suffering of the war in Vietnam.
 Those who urge our withdrawal from
 Vietnam in the name of saving human
 lives have the duty to consider the rec-
 ord of Communist terror in every country
 that has fallen under the sway of this
 merciless ideology, with its total disre-
 gard for human life.
 The total number of victims of commu-
 nism will probably never be known.  Stu-
 dents who have followed the Chinese
 Communist press closely claim that it can
 be demonstrated that Chinese commu-
 nism has cost the lives of at least 25
 million and more, probably 50 million
 people, while students of Soviet commu-
 nism put the overall figure for the So-
 viet Union at approximately the same
 level.  They point out that, entirely
 apart from the purges and mass killings,
 at periodic intervals and the forced star-
 vation of 5 million Ukrainian farmers,
 the reported death rate in the Soviet
 forced labor camps ran approximately
 25 percent per annum in bad years, and
 15 to 20 percent in good years.  If one
 accepts the average population of the
 slave labor camps as 10 million over the
 20 odd years of Stalin's undisputed rule,
 this would mean that approximately 2
 :million slave laborers died annually in
 Stalin's camps, or 40 million for the 20-
 year period.
 According to the Polish Government
 in exile, in London, the Soviets deported
 41/2 million Poles to Siberia after they
 had occupied eastern Poland in the wake
 of  the  Hitler-Stalin  pact.  Approxi-
 mately 150,000 were returned through
 Teheran after the Nazi invasion of Rus-
 sia.  Another 300,000 drifted back after
 the war. More than 1 million never
 came back.  Such was the mortality in
 the Soviet slave labor camps.
 All of this seems incredible to the
 Western mind.
 :t remember, when I was in Nuremburg,
 that when I first read the terrible sta-
 tistics about the mass killings by the
 Naisfe, I could not comprehend them. if

 Churchill held that the appeasement
 of a compulsive aggressor simply whet-

 and made war more likely.
 Chamberlain's policy won out, because
 nobody wanted war. When he came back
 from Munich, he was hailed not only by
 the Tories, but by the Liberals, and the
 Labor Party people, including leftwing-
 ers like James Maxton and Fenner
 Brockway.
 Churchill remained a voice crying in
 the wilderness.

 Chamberlain?
 Who was the true man of peace?

 Polish Communist member consistently
 refused to investigate reports of North
 Vietnamese Intervention in South Viet-
 nam.          In this way, this entire massive
 body of evidence of Hanoi's intervention
 in South Vietnam was muted and ren-
 dered ineffective.
 In order to understand the war in Viet-
 nam, we have to get away from tradi-
 tional concepts in which armies with
 their own insignias cross clearly marked
 national demarcation lines after their
 governments have duly declared war.
 Communist guerrilla warfare is waged
 without any declaration of war. In the
 case of Vietnam, it is waged from exter-
 nal sanctuaries which claim immunity to
 attack because the state which harbors
 them has not formally declared war.
 It blends military cadres who have in-.
 filtrated into the country with native
 dissidents and conscripts, in a manner
 which conceals the foreign instigation of
 the! Insurgency, and which enables the
 Communists to pretend that it is merely
 a civil war.
 It is time that we nail the civil war
 lie for what it is, It is time that we rec-
 ognized' it as a form of aggression as
 intolerable as open aggression across
 marked frontiers.
 Why did Ho Chi Minh decide to launch
 the current war for the liberation of
 South Vietnam?  The answer to this
 question is really very simple.
 After the Geneva agreement, it had
 been the expectation of the Communists
 that South Vietnam would collapse in
 administrative and political chaos be-
 fore many months had passed, and that
 it would fall into their hands like an
 overripe plum. Indeed, when Ngo Dinh
 Diem took office as Premier after the
 surrender of North Vietnam to the Com-
 munists, 99 percent of the Western press
 viewed the situation in South Vietnam
 as hopeless and predicted an early take-
 over by the Communist guerrillas.
 Cut off from the mineral and indus-
 trial riches of the north; swamped by
 an influx of 1 million refugees; without
 an adequate army or administration of
 its own; with three major sects, each
 with private armies, openly challenging
 its authority-confronted with this com-
 bination of burdens and handicaps, it
 seemed that nothing could save the new
 born South Vietnamese Government.
 But then there took place something
 that has properly come to be called the
 Diem miracle; this term was used at
 different times by President Kennedy and
 Secretary McNamara prior to Diem's
 overthrow, which most people, I believe,
 now realize was a tragic mistake.
 Diem first of all moved to destroy the
 power of the infamous Binh Xyuen, a
 sect of river pirates who, under the
 French, were given a simultaneous mo
 nopoly on the metropolitan police force
 of Saigon and on the thousands of opium
 dens and houses of prostitution and
 gambling that flourished there.
 73o powerful was the Binh Xyuen and
 so weak were the Diem forces at the
 time that even the American Ambassa-
 dor urged Diem not to attack them. .
 Diem, however, did attack them and
 drove theft our of Saigon..
 Having defeated the military sects
 and integrated them into the Armed
 Forces' of the republic, Diem within a
 few years was able to resettle the 1 mil-
 lion refugees and to create a stable uni-
 fied state where none had previously ex-
 isted. .
 I could not help feeling indignant over
 an article on Vietnam which appeared
 some time ago in the Washington Star.
 The author, Prof. Bernard Fall, who
 wrote the article in ill-concealed admi-
 ration of what the Communists had done
 in their area of Vietnam, mentioned the
 fact that the Communists had built
 schools for the people.  What he did not
 mention was that from 1955 to 1963
 President Diem has doubled the number
 of students in elementary schools, while
 at the secondary school level the in-
 crease has been fivefold.
 The remarkable progress in the field
 of education was no exception.  The en-
 tire South Vietnamese society scored re-
 markable advances in every field of eco-
 nomic and social endeavor, so that in
 1963 South Vietnam for the first time
 had a sizable rice surplus for export.
 There were significant increases in all
 sectors of industry and agriculture, and
 a 20-percent rise in per capita income.
 Meanwhile, in North Vietnam, things
 were going from bad to worse.  As in
 every other Communist country the col-
 lectivization of the peasants resulted in
 a dramatic. reduction of food output and
 in chronic food shortages throughout
 the country.  The resentment of the
 peasants was compounded by the brutal
 and indiscriminate punishment of hun-
 dreds of thousands of peasant farmers
 who were hailed before so-called people's
 courts and charged with being bourgeois
 elements or exploiting landlords.  Dur-
 ing the course of 1955 peasant revolts
 broke out in several areas.  There was
 even a revolt in Ho Chi Minh's own vil-
 lage. And there was some evidence that
 the troops sent to suppress these revolts
 sometimes sympathized with the peas-
 ants.  Shortages increased year by year.
 The people became increasingly apa-
 thetic,
 The contrast between the growing
 prosperity of the South and the growing
 misery in the North confronted the Viet-
 namese Communists with a challenge
 they could not tolerate.  That is why
 they decided that they had to put an
 end  to freedom in  South Vietnam.
 While they have scored some sensational
 victories in their war of subversion
 against the South Vietnamese Govern-
 ment, I think it important to point out
 that this war has gravely complicated
 the already serious internal difficulties
 of the North, so that in 1963, for exam-
 ple, the per capita output of rice in Com-
 munist North Vietnam was 20 percent
 lower than in 1960.
 And I also consider it Important to
 understand the significance of the fact
 that the Vietcong insurgency was di-
 rected not against a government that
 had failed to improve the lot of its peo-
 ple but against a government which,
 over a short period of time, had scored
 some of the most dramatic economic and
 social advances recorded anywhere in
 Asia,
 ESCALATION : FACT AM) FALLACY
 There has been a good deal of talk
 about the United States escalating the
 war in South Vietnam. Several Senators
 who spoke last week warned that if we
 escalate the war by means of air strikes
 against North Vietnam, the escalation
 may get out of hand and wind up as a war
 with Red China or perhaps even a world
 war.
 But it is not we who have escalated the
 war; it is the Communists. Peiping and
 Hanoi have been busy escalating the war
 in South Vietnam for several years now.
 They have sent in tens of thousands of
 soldiers of the North Vietnamese Army;
 they have trained additional tens of thou-
 sands of dissident South Vietnamese;
 they have supplied them with massive
 quantities of equipment; and they have
 stepped up the tempo of their attacks
 against the Vietnamese people.
 Now we are told that if we take any ac-
 tion against the territory of North Viet-
 nam? which has mounted and directed
 the entire attack on South Vietnam, it
 will entail the risk of world war.
 If the Communists are always to be
 permitted the privilege of escalating their
 attempts to take over new countries,
 while we shrink from retaliation for fear
 of further escalation, we might as well
 throw in the sponge now and tell the
 Communists the world is theirs for the
 taking.
 I find it difficult to conceive of Red
 China sending in her armies In response
 to air strikes against carefully selected
 military targets.  After all, if they did
 so, they would be risking retaliation
 against their highly vulnerable coastal
 cities, where most of Red China's indus-
 try is concentrated. They would be risk-
 ing setting back their economy 10 or 20
 years.
 Moreover, both the Chinese Commu-
 nists and the Hanoi Communists are
 aware that the massive introduction of
 Chinese troops would create serious pop-
 ular resentment because of the tradi-
 tional 'Vietnamese suspicion of Chinese
 imperialism.
 That there will be no invasion of the
 North by Vietnamese and American
 forces can, I believe, be taken,as axio-
 matic. Nor do I believe there will be any
 large-scale  involvement of American
 troops on the Korean model.  We will
 have to continue to provide the Viet-
 namese with logistical support and air
 support, as we are doing now. But on
 the ground, the fighting can most effec-
 tively be done by the Vietnamese armed
 forces, supported, I believe, by military
 contingents from the other free Asian
 countries.
 THE FALLACY THAT THE ASIAN PEOPLES DO NOT
 XS.NOW THE MEANING OF FREEDOM
 It has been stated by the senior Sena-
 tor from Idaho [Mr. CHURCH]  and by
 other critics of our foreign policy in. Viet-
 nam that it is pointless to talk about
 fighting for freedom in Asia because the
 Asian people historically do not know the
 meaning of freedom.  It has even been
 implied that, because of their ignorance

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE              February 23
 of freedom and their indifference to it,
 communism exercises a genuine attrac-
 tion for the peoples of Asia.
 I am sure that most Asians would con-
 sider this analysis condescending and
 offensive. I myself would be disposed to
 agree with them. It is an analysis which,
 in my opinion, is false on almost every
 score.
 We have grown accustomed to equat-
 ing freedom with the full range of free-
 doms that we in the United States today
 enjoy.  But, in the world in which we
 line, the word "freedom" has at least
 three separate and perhaps equally im-
 portant connotations.
 First, there is national freedom, or in-
 dependence from foreign control.
 Second, there is freedom of speech
 and press and the other freedoms in-
 herent in parliamentary democracy, such
 as we enjoy.
 And, third, there is the type of natural
 freedom that is enjoyed by primitive
 peasants and tribesmen in many back-
 ward countries, even under political
 autocracies.
 It is true that most Asian governments
 are autocratic; and it is probably true
 that the Vietnamese people do not un-
 derstand or appreciate freedom in the
 sense of parliamentary democracy.  But
 they certainly understand the meaning
 of "freedom" when the word is used to
 mean independence from foreign rule.
 They are, in fact, a people with a long
 and proud history and a strong sense of
 national  identity.  Every  Vietnamese
 schoolboy knows that his people fought
 and  triumphed  over the    hordes  of
 Genghis Khan in defense of their free-
 dom and he also knows that his country
 was free for five centuries before the
 French occupation.  Finally, he knows
 and takes pride in the fact that his peo-
 ple drove out the French colonialists de-
 spite their army of 400,000 men.  Do not
 tell me that these people know nothing
 about freedom.
 To the westernized Saigonese intellec-
 tuals, freedom of speech and freedom of
 the press are certainly very real issues;
 and even though they may have not mas-
 tered the processes, they would unques-
 tionably like to see some kind of parlia-
 mentary democracy in their country.  It
 is completely understandable that they
 should have chafed over the political con-
 trols that existed under the Diem gov-
 ernment, and that have existed, in one
 degree or another, under succeeding gov-
 ernments.            '
 But in the countryside, where the great
 mass of the people reside, the political
 controls that exist in the city are mean-
 ingless.  The peasant is free to own his
 own land, to dispose of his produce, to
 worship according to his beliefs, to guide
 .the upbringing of his children, and to
 'elect his local village officials.  To him,
 these freedoms that touch on his every-
 day life are the freedoms that really'
 count, not the abstract and remote free-
 doms of constitutional and federal gov-
 ernment. "
 . And, if on top of granting him these
 natural freedoms, the government as-
 slats him. by building schools and dis-
 pensarieseind by providing seed and fer-
 tWzer, , then, from. the standpoint of the
 southeast Asian peasant, his life is full
 and he is prepared to fight to defend it
 against the Communists.
 It is, in short, completely untrue that
 the Vietnamese people and the other
 peoples of Asia do not know the mean-
 ing of freedom. And it is equally untrue
 that communism is acceptable to. the
 Asian peasant because of his indiffer-
 ence to freedom.
 Communism has never been freely ac-
 cepted by any people, anywhere, no mat-
 ter how primitive.
 It has never been accepted for the
 simple reason that even primitive peoples
 do not enjoy being pushed around and
 brutalized and terrorized, and told what
 to do and what not to do, and having
 their every activity ordered and super-
 vised by political commissars.
 This is why communism must govern
 by means of ruthless dictatorship wher-
 ever it takes power.
 This is why the primitive mountain
 peoples of both Laos and Vietnam have,
 in  an  overwhelming majority,  sided
 against the Communists.
 This is why there are almost 8 mil-
 lion refugees from Communist rule in
 Asia today-people who have seen the
 reality of the so-called People's Democ-
 racy, and who have given up everything
 they possessed and frequently risked
 their lives to escape from it.
 That is why there is barbed wire and
 iron curtains surrounding the Commu-
 nist countries.  The inhabitants of the
 Communist countries would all leave if
 they could.
 There is one final comment I would like
 to make while dealing with this sub-
 ject.  Too often I have heard it said
 that the Vietnamese people are not fight-
 ing because there is nothing to choose
 between communism and the kind of gov-
 ernment they now have.
 To equate an authoritarian regime like
 that in South Vietnam, or Taiwan, or
 Thailand with the totalitarian rule of
 communism is tantamount to losing all
 sense of proportion.  Not only have these
 regimes never been guilty of the massive
 bloodletting and total direction of per-
 sonal life which has characterized Com-
 munist rule in every country, but, care-
 fully examined, it will turn out that these
 regimes are a mixture of natural democ-
 racy at the bottom with political controls
 of varying rigidity at the top.
 Even at their worst, the political au-
 tocracies that exist in certain free Asian
 countries are a thousand times better
 than communism from the standpoint of
 how they treat their own people.  And
 at their best, some of these autocracies
 have combined control of the press and
 political parties with remarkably pro-
 gressive social programs.
 But perhaps more important from our.
 standpoint is that these free autocracies,
 for lack of a better term, do not threaten
 the peace of their neighbors or of the
 world or threaten our own security,
 whereas world communism has now be-
 come a threat of terrifying dimensions.
 THE FALLACY THAT THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE
 HAVE NO WILL TO RESIST COMMUNISM
 We have been told that the Vietnamese
 people are indifferent to.. communism;
 that they resist it only halfheartedly.
 Some commentators have even sought to
 create the impression that America is in
 a, position of coercing the South Viet-
 namese to fight against communism.
 This estimate of the attitude of the
 ,South Vietnamese people is totally false.
 True, Souh Vietnam is suffering from
 political instability.
 True, the war against the Vietcong is
 going badly.
 But these things by themselves do not
 constitute proof that the Vietnamese
 people are indifferent to communism or
 that they do not have the will to resist.
 The people of South Vietnam are, in
 fact, one of the most anti-Communist
 peoples in the world.  Among them are
 more than 1 million refugees who sacri-
 flred everything they possessed to flee
 from North Vietnam to South Vietnam
 after the country was divided by the
 Geneva agreement of 1954; and it is esti-
 mated that there are another 300,000 in-
 ternal refugees who have .fled from Com-
 munist-controlled areas in the south.
 Among the present population of 14 mil-
 lion, in addition, there are several million
 peasants and workers and students who
 have at one time or another borne arms
 against the Communists, some of them
 in the Vietnamese Army, the majority in
 village self-defense units.
 The overwhelming majority of the
 people of South Vietnam know what com-
 munism means because they have experi-
 enced it on their own backs. There are
 indeed very few South Vietnamese who
 do not have friends or,relatives who have
 been the victims of Communist brutality
 and terror.
 Lot me tell the story of one such act
 of Communist terror, because statistics
 by themselves tend to be meaningless.
 In the village of Phu Hon, there was a
 teenage girl by the name of Giau, the
 pride of her parents and a born leader of
 others. As a member of the Republican
 Youth Organization, she organized the
 village youth and gave talks.  On the
 evening of January 15, 1962, she was ab-
 ducted from her village by Vietcong sol-
 diers. The next morning her mutilated
 and decapitated body-I have a photo-
 graph of it-was discovered in the road-
 way outside the village with a note on
 her breast captioned "Death Sentence
 for Giau," and signed by the "People's
 Front of Liberation."
 For a long period of time, assassina-
 tions such as this were going on at the
 rate of some 500 a month, or 6,000 a
 year.  The victims were most frequently ,
 .active supporters of governlm.ent, local
 administrators, village heads, and school-
 teachers.  The families of village mili-
 tiamen were another favorite target.,
 The Vietcong would entice the miliVa
 away from the village-and when they
 returned they would find their wives and
 children massacred.
 While the facts of these mass assassi-
 nations are not generally known in our
 country, they are. known in Vietnam.
 And this is one of the reasons why the
 Vietnamese people hate the Communists,
 and why they continue to resist them
 despite the chronic politiW Instability
 in Saigon and despite the. seeming hope-
 lessness of their situation.

 And even last year, when the fortunes
 of war turned against the Vietnamese
 government, the Vietnamese Army killed
 17;000 Vietcong against. a loss of 7,000
 men, and took 4,200 Communists captive
 against 5,800 captives lost to them.
 To those who say that the Vietnamese
 Army has not shown the will to resist,
 I point out that, over the 3-year period
 for which I have presented figures, this
 army suffered a total death toll of 17,000
 men, which is almost as Leigh as the total
 American toll in South Korea.  The
 enemy's casualties have been much heav-
 ier. But the Communists have continued
 to attack regardless of losses. And be-
 cause it has not been possible to recon-
 stitute a stable government since the
 overthrow of Diem, and, because no one
 knows where guerrillas may strike next,
 and because unlimited terror is a dread-
 fully effective instrument, the Vietcong,
 over the past 15 months, have been able
 to make most of the Vietnamese country-
 side insecure.
 The fact that the Vietcong seem to be
 winning and that they have been so
 kangaroo courts,  and  executing and
 burying those who were sentenced.
 I also remind them of the scenes that
 tool, place when the prisoners were
 brought before the Communist interro-
 gators under the procedures set up by
 the Neutral Nations Repatriation Com-
 mission. The prisoners had to be dragged
 before the interrogators forcibly, their
 arms pinned behind their backs by In-
 dian soldiers. When the Communist in-
 terrogators spoke to them, urging that
 they return to their homeland, the pris-
 oners spat out their hatred with a vehe-
 mence that Western observers found
 frightening.  So embarrassing were the
 interrogations for the Communists that
 after a, number of sessions they decided
 to call off the whole show.
 In the light of this conclusion, how
 much significance can one attach to the
 seemingly fanatical courage displayed by
 the Chinese and North Korean soldiers
 in attacking our positions, or to the grim
 unity of the Koju prisoners of war in
 resisting their American captors?
 Before we marvel at the apparently
 For some strange reason, the torture
 of one Vietcong prisoner aroused far
 more indignation in our country than
 the assassination of scores of thousands
 of innocent civilians by the Vietcong
 Communists, including the bombing of a
 schoolbus in which a score of children
 cited..
 But, If the Vietnamese people are anti-
 Communist, I have been asked: Why has
 the Vietnamese Army put up so poor a
 show?
 The Vietnamese Army has been handi-
 capped by political instability by the fre-
 quent shifts of officers, by poor staff
 work, by its inadequate use of scouts and
 security patrols, and by the many dis-
 advantages under which counterguer-
 rilla forces must always operate.  But,
 it is simply not true that the Vietnamese
 Army has shown no willingness to fight.
 They have fought bravely in thou-
 sands of engagements. They have taken
 heavy casualties and inflicted much
 heavier casualties on the enemy.
 The belief that the Vietnamese people
 do not have the will to resist the Com-
 munists and that the Vietnamese forces
 have fought poorly against them, is in
 large measure due to the unfortunate
 emphasis which the press always places
 on disasters and defects.
 It probably also springs in part from
 the traditional attitude of the American
 newspaperman that it is his duty to
 mercilessly expose every weakness in
 his city government, in his State govern-
 ment, in his National Government.
 I do not complain about that. I sup-
 pose that is the way it has to be.
 But whatever the reasons may be, the
 emphasis in the press has been so mis-
 leading that even knowledgeable mem-
 bers of the administration have been con-
 fused by it. For example, a member of
 the administration who very recently
 visited Vietnam informed me that, con-
 trary to his impressions from reading the
 press he was amazed to learn that in
 eight engagements of battalion size and
 larger which took place during the
 month of January 1965, the Vietnamese
 Army got the better of the engagement
 in every single case.
 I have here the comparative figures
 for Vietnamese and Vietcong casualties
 -for the 3-year period 1962-64, which
 I have received from an official source.
 I wish to read them, Mr. President, be-
 cause they throw an altogether new light
 on the situation in Vietnam. 'I do not
 know why these figures were not released
 long ago.  I hear people complaining
 that they do not know what is going on
 4n Vietnam. The release of these figures
 would have helped them to understand.
 In 1962 the Vietnamese Army lost 4,400
 killed in action against 21,000 Vietcong
 killed, and 1,300 prisoners against 5,500
 captives taken from the Vietcong.
 Those are pretty good statistics. They
 ought to be read and studied by persons
 who are saying the South Vietnamese
 have no will to fight.
 ]Listen to these further figures :
 In 1963 the figures were 5,700 Vietna-
 anese soldiers killed in action against
 21,000 Vietcong, and 3,300 missing or
 captured . Against 4,000' Vietcong cap=
 erattacks, has led some people to believe
 that the Vietcong soldier is convinced of
 the justice of his cause and that this is
 why he fights more grimly,.
 The Communists are masters of the
 art of imposing iron discipline by means
 of unlimited terror.
 Senators will recall that during the
 Korean war we all marveled at the dis-
 cipline of the Chinese Communist sol-
 diers who kept on marching without
 breaking step while they were being
 bombed and strafed by American planes,
 or who attacked our positions, wave upon
 wave, apparently oblivious to casualties.
 I remember people saying, "See the
 dedication of these Chinese Communists.
 See how they bear themselves against
 bullets and bombs. See how fanatically
 they believe in their cause."  I did not
 think, that was the reason, but I did not
 have an effective answer until after the
 war was over.
 Senators will recall the terrible riots
 in the Koje prisoner-of-war camp, when
 the prisoners seemed so grimly united
 against us that for weeks on end Amer-
 ican soldiers could not venture into the
 POW compound.  Again,. the common
 assumption was that the prisoners were
 all fanatical Communists.
 But then the end of the war came-
 and it turned out that 20,000 out of 25,000
 of the Communist prisoners in our hands
 asked for refugee status rather than
 return to North Korea or China.  And
 these were supposed to be the dedicated
 Communists who believe so fanatically
 in communism.
 Of the 5,000 who returned home, there
 is reason to believe that the majority
 did so with heavy hearts, because of
 strong family ties and not because of
 any love for communism.
 I remind the Senators-because these
 things tend to be forgotten-of the evi-
 dence which emerged that the Koje pris-
 oners- of war had been terrorized by a
 tiny minority of Communist. militants
 who ran the camp with' an iron hand,
 torturing political -opponents, staging
 the experience of the Korean war, be-
 cause 1'he evidence is overwhelming that
 the Vietcong Communists are using ter-
 ror on the same scale and in. the same
 manner that it was employed on the
 Korean battlefront and in the prisoner-
 of-wax camps.
 That the morale of the Vietcong forces
 is not 10 feet tall is demonstrated by the
 substantial number of Vietcong prisoners
 taken over the past 3 years. It is demon-
 strated even more dramatically by the
 fact that from' February 1963 through
 the end of 1964 there were approxi-
 mately :L7,000 Vietcong defections. The
 number of defections would be far
 larger, I am certain, if a stable,govern-
 ment could establish itself in Saigon.
 It is interesting to note that, while
 most of the defectors have been young
 peasants who were conscripted by the
 Vietcong, their ranks also include North
 Vietnamese officers who were 'told that
 they were going south to fight the Amer-
 icans and who broke when they dis-
 covered that they were fighting their
 own people.
 Impatient constituents have sometimes
 asked me why the Communists have been
 able to plan elaborate attacks on. our
 airfields and other installations without
 advance intelligence reaching 11s from
 members of the local population who
 must have observed the Communists.
 The instrument of terror is also appli-
 cable to the control of the civilian popu-
 lation.  'Whenever the Communists take
 over a village or a town, they systemat-
 ically massacre all known anti-Commu-
 nist leaders and those who are suspected
 of informing.  They frequently mutilate
 their bodies as an example to the people.
 If we could give the Vietnamese 'vil-
 lagers a. feeling of greater security, I am
 sure that more intelligence would be
 3orthcoming.   As matters now stand, the
 average. Vietnamese peasant fears that
 the Communists are going to win the
 war, and he knows the terrible punish-
 ment that awaits those who inform on
 the Communists. This is why our in-

 I went to New York and saw Ambas-'
 sador Vollo.  I said, "Mr. Ambassador, I
 understand you were it member of the
 United Nations commission which went
 to Vietnam.   I should like to ask you
 what the facts are." Ambassador Volio
 gave me the facts as I have given them to
 you here.
 Ambassador Pinto, of Dohomey, an-
 other member of the U.N. mission, ex-
 pressed himself in similar terms in
 public.
 The entire tragic story suggests that
 the free world was made the victim of a
 gigantic propaganda hoax, as a result of
 which the legitimate government of
 President Diem was destroyed and a
 chaotic situation created which has in-
 evitably played, into the hands of the
 Communists.
 If Senators have not yet had time to
 read the report of the U.N. factfinding
 mission to Vietnam, I urge them to do so
 because it throws essential light on the
 current  activities  of  the  militant
 Buddhists. I am arranging to have copies
 mailed to every Senator, and I hope that
 all Senators will read it, because they
 will learn a great deal about the present
 Buddhist situation from it.
 The first fact which needs to be estab-
 lished in evaluating the militant Buddhist
 movement is that the Buddhists do not
 constitute 80 or 85 percent of the popula-
 tion, as was widely reported at the time
 of the Buddhist crisis. According to Dr.
 Mai Tho Truyen, one of the greatest au-
 thorities on Vietnam Buddhism, the Viet-
 namese Buddhists number approximately
 4 million people, or about 30 percent of
 the population.
 The second point that must be made is
 that the militant Buddhists constitute
 only a small fraction of the total Bud-
 dhist population.  The millions of the
 Buddhist peasants, in their great ma-
 jority, do not approve of the militant
 political actions and the government-
 toppling intrigues of the Buddhist mili-
 tants in Saigon. Their activities, indeed,
 run completely counter to the pacific
 traditions of the Buddhist religion.
 It is questionable whether the Bud-
 dhist militants have been able to mobilize
 as many as 50,000 active. supporters in
 all the demonstrations they have staged
 in Saigon and Hue and other cities. But
 because political, power resides in the
 cities, the several tens of thousands of
 Buddhist militants, by their clamor and
 their persistent demonstrations and their
 clever propaganda, have succeeded in
 creating the impression that they speak
 for the people of the cities and for the
 majority of the people of Vietnam.
 What do the Buddhist militants want?
 Before the overthrow of President Diem,
 Thich Tri Quang told Marguerite Hig-
 gins frankly: "We cannot get an arrange-
 ment with the north until we get rid Df
 Diem and Nhu."
 The evidence is clear that Thich Tri
 Quang and some of his other militants
 are still bent on an agreement with the
 north.. Indeed, only last Friday, Quang
 called for U.S. negotiations with Ho Chi
 Minh.
 If there 4s reason to believe that Thich
 Tri Quang is a neutralist, there is even
 more reason for fearing that some of the
 other members of the Buddhist opposi-
 tion movement are openly pro-Commu-
 nist or that they have become tools of
 the rather substantial Communist infil-
 tration which is known to exist in the
 Buddhist clergy in the various countries
 of Asia.
 That such an infiltration should exist
 Is not surprising because there are no
 barriers to it.
 A roan who wants to become a Bud-
 dhist monk does not have to prepare him-
 self for his ministry by engaging in
 studies, nor does he have to be ordained,
 nor does he take any vow.
 He simply shaves his head and dons
 the saffron robe and enters a monas-
 tery.--and overnight he becomes' one of
 the religious elite.
 When he wishes to leave the mon-
 astery, he sheds his robe and leaves it;
 if he wishes to reenter, he dons his robe
 again and reenters.  That is all there
 is to it.
 I do not criticize this procedure on
 religious grounds.
 Buddhism is one of the great religions
 of mankind and much can be said for
 an arrangement that enables every man
 of religious disposition to spend at least
 a portion of his life under the 'voluntary
 monastic  discipline  characteristic  of
 Buddhism.
 But, regrettably, it is a procedure that
 leaves the door wide open to Co:imnunist
 Infiltration.
 I remember that when we were digging
 into the files of the Nazis at Nuremberg,
 we found that Hitler had under consider-
 ation a program of infiltrating the
 churches by inducing young people to
 enter seminaries, so that he could have
 them at his disposal.
 When I first began to hear of the
 Buddhist situation, it occurred to me
 that more than likely there was a sim-
 ilar infiltration of religion at work.
 The militant Buddhists have used the
 influence and prestige which accrued to
 them from the overthrow of D1em for
 the prime purpose of making stable gov-
 ernment impossible: in this sense, what-
 ever the intent of their leaders, they
 .have been serving the desires of the
 Communist Vietcong.
 They have organized demonstrations,
 provoked riots, inflamed passions with
 highly publicized fasts and self-irremola-
 tions, and subjected the government to
 a ceaseless propaganda barrage.  They
 overthrew  the  Khanh             government.
 Then they overthrew the Huong govern-
 unent which succeeded it.  And they
 seem to be intent on making things im-
 possible for any government that may
 come to power.
 It Is, of course, difficult to deal with a
 political conspiracy that camouflages it-
 self in religious robes. In any case, this
 is a matter for the Vietnamese Govern-
 ment and not for our own Government.
 But it would make matters immeasur-
 ably easier for the Vietnamese authori-
 ties if the true facts about Buddhism
 in Vietnam were given to the American
 people and if they could be helped to
 understand how little the Buddhist mili-
 tants really represent, how nefarious
 their politioal!activities have really been,

 telligence has admittedly been inade-
 quate--one of the reasons, certainly.
 But this is a situation that could change
 dramatically if we succeeded in convinc-
 ing the Vietnamese people of our deter-
 mination to help them retain their free-
 dom, and if we succeeded in inflicting. a
 number of significant defeats on the
 enemy.                      -
 THE BUDDHIST FALLACY
 I now wish to discuss the Buddhist sit-
 uation, about which we have heard for
 several years now.
 The myth of Buddhist persecution and
 the parallel myth that the Buddhists are
 opposed to the Government, have be-
 cause of the so-called militant Buddhist
 movement, become important political
 factors in Vietnam. It is, therefore, im-
 portant that we should seek to under-
 stand the nature of this movement, the
 motivation of its leaders, and the real
 degree of influence it exerts over the
 Vietnamese people.
 It is, indeed, idle to debate the subject
 of Vietnam and our policy there and not
 understand the so-called Buddhist prob-
 lem.  There has been much loose talk
 about'it, but there has thus far been little
 hard, factual information.
 The campaign which resulted in the
 overthrow of President Diem *as marked
 by the charge that he had subjected the
 Buddhist religion to inhuman persecu-
 tion; and, in protest against this alleged
 persecution,'a number of Buddhist monks
 went through the horrifying ritual of
 self-Immolation.
 Week after week, month after month,
 the American people and the people of
 the world were inundated with stories
 supporting the charge that Diem was
 persecuting the Buddhist religion. There
 were a number of experienced corre-
 spondents of national reputation who
 challenged the authenticity  of these
 stories.  But their voices were drowned
 by, the torrent of charges and allegations
 that appeared in some of our major news-
 papers, and that were  lent  further
 credence because of repetition of our of
 float information agencies.
 At the invitation of President Diem, the
 U.N. General Assembly decided to send a
 factfinding mission to South Vietnam to
 look into the situation. I find this rarely
 referred to in any discussion of the Bud-
 dhist question, but it is a fact that the
 United Nations did send a mission over
 there.
 While the mission was still in the coun-
 try, President Diem and his brother,
 Ngo Dinh Nhu, were overthrown and
 assassinated.
 The mission decided that the overthrow
 of Diem made it unnecessary to come up
 with a formal finding.  I believe that
 this was most regrettable. But the sum-
 mary of the testimony which it had taken
 in Vietnam pointed strongly to the con-
 elusion that the persecution of the
 Buddhists was either nonexistent or
 -vastly exaggerated and that the agita-
 tion was essentially political.  This, in
 essence, was what I was told in a per-
 ? sonal conversation with Ambassador Fer-
 mando Volio Jiminez, of Costa Rica, who
 ',hid introduced the motion calling for, the
 setting up of the.U,N. mission and,who

 for our own foreign service and military
 personnel so that they can help to com-
 municate this knowledge to nationals of
 other countries who, like the South Viet-
 namese, are engaged in a life-and-death
 struggle for survival against the most
 cunning and most ruthless practitioners
 of political warfare history has ever
 known.
 In this connection, I wish to bring
 to the attention of my colleagues the
 fact that there has been pending before
 Congress for some 6 years a bill calling
 for the establishment of a Freedom
 Academy.  This would be an institu-
 tion where Americans and citizens of
 other free countries could receive con-
 centrated training in Communist tech-
 niques and operations, and in tactics and
 methods designed to frustrate the Com-
 munists at every operational level, from
 elections for the control of trade unions
 and student organizations, to street riots,
 to attempted insurrections.
 The Senate Judiciary Committee in
 reporting this measure to the floor in
 May of 1960, described the bill as "one
 of the most important measures ever in-
 troduced in the Congress."  But, unfor-
 tunately, although the bill was passed
 by the Senate, the House took no action.
 When the bill was reintroduced for the
 third time in early 1963, it has the spon-
 sorship  of  the  following  Senators.
 MUNDT, DOUGLAS, CASE, DODD, SMATHERS,
 Goldwater; PROXMIRE,  FOND, HICKEN-
 L~iOOl'ER, MILLER, Keating, LAUSCHE, and
 SCOTT.
 The distinguished senior Senator from
 South Dakota last Friday reintroduced
 the measure for the fourth time, and it is
 now lying on the table, so that those who
 wish to add their names as cosponsors
 may do so.  It is my earnest hope that
 the measure will have the sponsorship
 of an even larger bipartisan group of
 Senators than it did in 1963.  It is my
 hope too that there will be no further
 delay, no foot dragging, in enacting this
 long-overdue measure.  It is time, high
 time, that we recognize the imperative
 need to equip ourselves and our allies
 with the knowledge and the trained per-
 sonnel required to meet the Communist
 onslaught.
 CARRYING THE GUERRILLA WAR TO THE NORTH
 First of all, I think there is a growing
 acceptance of the need for.punishing the
 North with hit-and-run raids. It would
 be much more effective if these raids
 could be carried out in the name of a
 North Vietnamese Liberation Front than
 in the name of the South Vietnamese
 Government.
 Second, I have reason for believing
 that increasing consideration is being
 given to the need for countering the Viet-
 cong insurgency in the South with a
 guerrilla warfare effort in the North.
 In May of 1961, when I returned from
 Laos and Vietnam, I made a statement,
 which I should like to repeat today:'
 The best way for us to stop Communist
 guerrilla action in Laos and in South Viet-
 nary[ is to send guerrilla forces into North
 Vietnam; to equip and supply those patriots
 already in the field; to make every Commu-
 nist omoiM fear theJust retribution of an
 outraged humanity; to.make every Commu-
 nist arsenal, government building, conlmq-
 nications center and transportation facility
 a target for sabotage; to provide a rallying
 point for the great masses of oppressed peo-
 ple who hate communism because they have
 known it.  Only when we give the Commu-
 nists more trouble than they can handle at
 home, will they cease their aggression against
 the outposts of freedom.
 I believe that every word I said in 1961
 is doubly valid today. It is not too late to
 embark upon such a program. And if we
 do give the South Vietnamese Govern-
 ment the green light to embark upon it
 on an effective, hard-hitting scale, again
 I think it would add significantly to the
 psychological impact of the entire pro-
 gram if all guerrilla activities were car-
 ried out in the name of the "Committee
 for the Liberation of the North."
 A FEW ML7.ITARY SUGGESTIONS
 I do not pretend to be a military ex-
 pert. But I have discussed the situation
 in Vietnam with a number of military
 men of considerable experience in the
 area, and I have been encouraged to be..
 lieve that the several suggestions which
 I have to make in this field are realistic.
 I submit them for the consideration
 of my colleagues, because I think they
 make sense.
 My first proposition is that we cannot
 regard the war in Vietnam in isolation
 from the rest of southeast Asia.
 The Communist Party over which Ho
 Chi Minh presided for many years was
 the Communist Party of Indochina. In-
 deed, to this day, there is no such thing
 as a Communist Party in Vietnam.  Ho
 Chi Minh's thinking and strategy are
 directed toward the reunification of all
 the former territories of French Indo-
 china under his personal sway.                                                         This
 makes it imperative for us to develop a
 coordinated strategy for the entire area
 if we are to cope effectively with the
 Communist strategy.
 Proposition No. 2 is that there are
 certain dramatic military actions open
 to us that do not involve the territory of
 North Vietnam.
 The hub of the Ho Chi Minh trail is
 the town of Tchepone, inside the Lao-
 tian frontier, just south of the 17th par-
 allel, the dividing line between North
 Vietnam and South Vietnam.  Through
 Tchepone pour most of the reinforce-
 ments and equipment from North Viet-
 nam.  From Tchepone the men and
 equipment are infiltrated into South
 Vietnam along hundreds of different
 jungle trails.
 I recall that when I met with Presi-
 dent Diem in April of 1961, he urged that
 the Americans assist him and the Laotian
 Government in preemptive action to
 secure three key centers in the Laotian
 Panhandle-Tchepone,  Saravane,  and
 Attopeu-in order to prevent the large-
 scale infiltration which is today taking
 place. I still have a copy of the marked
 map which he gave me in outlining his
 project.  Had Diem's advice been fol-
 lowed there would have been no Ho Chi
 Minh trail. But this was at the time of
 the Laotian armistice and we were not
 disposed to take any actions which might
 provoke the Laotian 'Communists.  So
 nothing was done.
 The seizure of Tchepone by Laotian
 and Vietnamese forces, with American
 air support would, I have been assured,
 be a feasible military operation and one
 that could be carried out with the means
 available to us on the spot.  It would
 do more to put a crimp in the Ho Chi
 Minh trail than. any amount of bombing
 we could attempt.  And it would have
 as dramatic an impact on the situation
 in Laos as on the situation in Vietnam.
 Finally, there is the matter of collec-
 tive action by the SEATO nations.
 As late as April of 1961, the SEATO na-
 tions in the immediate area of the
 Philippines, Thailand, Australia, New
 Zealand, and Pakistan-all favored com-
 mon                                                                                           action  against  the  Communist
 menace in Laos.  But the British and
 French were opposed to such action, and
 we ourselves sat on the fence; and the
 result was that nothing was done.
 The charter of SEATO will have to be
 modified so that one, nation cannot veto
 collective action by all the other nations.
 Britain, I am inclined to believe, would
 now be disposed to support collective ac-
 tion by SEATO because of the situation
 in Malaysia. But, perhaps France should
 be invited to leave SEATO, on the
 grounds that she has no vital interests in
 the area, and her entire attitude toward
 Red China is one of appeasement.  In
 view of the fact that something has to be
 done immediately, however, the sensible
 course is to encourage collective action
 by the free nations in the area, outside
 the framework of SEATO, until SEATO
 can be reorganized. In a manner that
 makes it effective.
 In this connection, I am most encour-
 aged by the news that South Korea has
 decided to send a contingent of several
 thousand military engineers to South
 Vietnam, and the Philippines have de-
 cided to do likewise.  It is infinitely bet-
 ter from every standpoint to have Asian
 troops supporting the Vietnamese forces
 against the Vietcong on the ground, than
 it is to have American, troops actively in-
 volved.
 THE NEED FOR UNDEaSCORING OUR
 LONG-TERM COMMITMENT
 The retaliatory strikes ordered by
 President Johnson against the North
 have had the effect of reiterating our
 commitment in a manner that the Com-
 munists understand; and this, in the
 .long run, is probably more important
 than the damage wrought by these
 strikes.
 But if the Communists are to be dis-
 couraged from continuing this costly
 war, we must seek every possible means
 of underscoring our determination to
 stand by the people of South Vietnam, .
 to pay whatever cost may be necessary,
 and to take whatever risk may be neces-
 sary to prevent the Communists' from
 subjugating the Vietnamese people and
 other people in the area.
 It is important to reiterate our resolve
 at every opportunity.  And it is even
 more important to translate this resolve
 into hard political and military actions.
 The American Friends of Vietnam
 have, suggested another dramatic meas-
 ure.                                                                                           They have suggested a commit-
 ment to a- massive southeast Asian de-
 velopment program based' on the har-
 nessing of the Mekong River-a kind of

 east Asia.  Such a plan, they point out,
 would offer incredible promise to Laos,
 Cambodia, and Thailand as well as to
 South Vietnam, and it would offer equal
 promise to the people of North Vietnam,
 which only the continued belligerence
 and noncooperation of their Government
 could frustrate.
 This, to me, sounds eminently sensi-
 ble.
 FOR A COMMITMENT TO VICTORY
 If we decide to withdraw from Viet-
 nam we can certainly find plenty of ex-
 cuses to ease our path.  We can blame it
 on the geography; or on the topography;
 or on local apathy; or on political in-
 stability; or on religious strife; or even
 on anti-Americanism. But that will fool
 no one but ourselves. These conditions
 make our success there difficult, but only
 our own timidity and vacillation can
 make it impossible.
 It has become obvious that we cannot
 go on fighting this undeclared war under
 the rules laid down by our enemies.  We
 have reached the point where we shall
 have to make a great decision, a decision
 as to whether we are to take the hard
 steps necessary to turn the tide in Viet-
 nam or whether we are to refrain from
 doing so and thus lose inevitably by de-
 ,fault.
 The ultimate outcome of the cold war
 depends upon an affirmative decision to
 do whatever is necessary to achieve vic-
 tory in South Vietnam.  The events of
 recent weeks demonstrate again that the
 administration is not lacking in resolve
 and that it is rapidly approaching such a
 decision.
 Whether that means a larger commit-
 ment of forces, or continued retaliatory
 nizes in its foreign aid program not only
 that the rich are morally obligated to
 help the poor, but also that prosperity
 cannot permanently endure surrounded
 by poverty, and justice cannot conquer
 until its conquest is universal.
 Let us, above all, encourage and inspire
 a national spirit worthy of our history,
 worthy  of  our  burgeoning,  bursting
 strength, in our arms, in our agriculture,
 in industry, in science, in finance, a spirit
 of confidence, of optimism, of willingness
 to accept new risks and exploit new op-
 portunities.
 And let us remember that providence
 has showered upon our people greater
 blessings than on any other, and th&t,
 great though our works have been, much
 greater is expected of us.
 In recent days, the free world has paid
 tribute to its greatest champion of our
 age, Winston Churchill,
 It is a curious thing that though
 Churchill is acknowledged on all sides
 as the preeminent figure of our time
 and as the highest embodiment of West-
 ern statesmanship, he was, throughout
 his life, and remains today, a prophet
 unheeded, a statesman whom men ven-
 erate but will not emulate,
 It may well be that Winston Church-
 ill's greatest legacy will prove to be, not
 the legacy of his immortal deeds, but
 that of his example and his precepts; and
 that freemen of the future will pay him
 the homage denied by his contempo-
 raries, the tribute of imitation and ac-
 ceptance of his message.
 As we ponder the passing of this he-
 roic figure and reflect upon his career
 and try to draw from It lessons which
 we might apply to the aggressive on-
 strikes against the North, or carrying _ slaught that we face today in a hundred
 guerrilla warfare to the enemy home-  ways on a hundred fronts, we might
 land, or completely sealing off South .
 Vietnam from Communist aid-I say to
 the administration, "Give us the plan
 that will do the job, and we will support
 you:'
 Whether our victory be near or far, can
 we, dare we, turn away or begin to turn
 away from the task before us, however
 frustrating or burdensome it may be?
 Here surely is a time for us, to heed
 Santayana's maxim "Those who will not
 learn from the past are destined to re-
 peat it." ,
 And so I speak today not merely to urge
 that we stand fast in Vietnam, but also
 to urge that we meet head on the new
 isolationism in its incipient stages, before
 the long months and years of discontent,
 frustration, and weariness that lie ahead
 have swelled the chorus urging disen-
 gagement and withdrawal to a deafening
 roar.
 Let us expound a foreign policy nur-
 tured in our constantly growing strength,
 not one fed by fear and disillusionment;
 a policy which each year is prepared to
 expend more, not less, in the cause of
 preserving our country and the decencies
 of man.
 Let us insist upon a defense budget
 based upon the dangers we face abroad,
 not upon the benefits we seek at home.
 Let us embrace a doctrine that refuses
 to yield to force, ever; that honors its
 commitments because we know that our
 good faith is the cement binding the free
 world together; _a doctrine that recog-
 take to heart this advice which he gave in
 the dark days of 1941 to the boys of Har-
 row, his old school :
 Never give in.  Never, never, never, never.
 Never yield to force and the apparently over-
 whelming might of the enemy.  Never yield
 in any way, great or small, large or petty,
 except to convictions of honor and good
 sense.
 Let us resolve to nail this message to
 the masthead of our ship of state in this
 year of decision.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed in the RECORD the
 following documents: First, a summary
 of Communist violations of the Laotian
 armistice prepared for me by the Library
 of Congress; second, a copy of a state-
 ment released yesterday by the American
 Friends of Vietnam, under the caption of
 "A New Policy for Vietnam"; third, a
 copy of a telegram to the President from
 the Veterans of Foreign Wars; fourth,
 various newspaper clippings bearing on
 the situation in Vietnam.
 There being no objection, the sundry
 documents were ordered to be printed in
 .agreement on principles to implement a
 truce: forces of each faction will remain in
 their previous positions:  frontline  forces
 and military supplies are not to be increased;
 and troops of the three factions will not at-
 tack each other.
 August 22, 1062: Several companies of pro-
 Communist Pathet Lao troops attack out-
 posts of rightist forces near Sam Neua in
 northeastern Laos.

 flying rice and other supplies to neutralist
 forces, is shot down  over the Plaine des

 plane was shot down by dissident neutralist
 troops tied up with Pathet Lao.
 April 4, 1063: Premier Souvanna Phouma
 announces that Pathet Liao troops have at-
 tacked neutralist troops of Gen. Kong Le in

 a.serious violation of the cease-fire.
 April 15, 1983: Following brief cease-fire,
 fighting breaks out again on the Plains des
 Jarres.  The neutralist forces of Gen. Kong
 Le are attacked and suffer new setbacks. On
 April 16 U.S. Under Secretary of State George
 Ball says that the United States does not
 rule out the possibility of sending troops
 into Laos if the situation should continue to
 deteriorate. Warnings are also issued by Sec-
 retary of State Dean Rusk on April 18 and
 President Kennedy on April 19.
 May 3, 1963: Pathet Lao troops fire on two
 helicopters of the International Control Com-
 mission in the Plains des Jarres, destroying
 one and wounding four occupants.  On May
 10, U.S. Ambassador Leonard Unger accuses
 the Pathet Lao of disrupting the peace and
 violating the Geneva accords, and he says
 that the United States will never leave Laos
 standing alone "to face its enemies from
 within and abroad."
 May 21, 1983: Premier Souvanna Phouma
 issues communique stating that severe fight-
 ing has been going on for 2 clays in the
 Plains des Jarres between Pathet Lao troops
 and neutralist forces.  On May 23, the ICC
 asks Britain and the Soviet Union to issue
 immediate appeal for a cease-fire on the
 Plains des Jarres.

 neutralist positions  near the Plains des
 Jarres.
 September 7, 1983: U.S. C-47 unarmed
 cargo plane is shot down by Pathet Lao in

 rightist police force under Deputy Premier
 Phoumi Nosavan.
 November 17; 1983: Cease-fire is broken as

 Talks between neutralist and Pathet Lao
 military leaders subsequently break down
 as the Pathet Lao rejects a proposal for the
 ICC to police the cease-fire.
 January 29, 1964: Neutralist military head-
 quarters reports that six Pathet Lao and four
 North Vietnamese battalions have launched
 an attack In southern Laos, have defeated
 neutralist and rightist forces at Na Kay, and
 are now heading toward the the strategic

 A NEW PoLTCY FOR VIETNAM
 (Statement by the American Friends of Viet-
 nam)
 THE DILEMMA
 If we are to identify wisely our most effec-
 tive forward course in Vietnam, it is impor-
 tant first to understand the exact nature of
 our dilemma there.  We know the inherent
 generosity, both toward free Vietnam and its
 neighboring countries, which has led us to
 Involve our substance and our blood.  We
 know that but for our commitment, free Viet-
 nam would long since have fallen into the
 political darkness and physical despair which
 oppresses  Communist North  Vietnam.     We
 know that our presence there is in response
 to the wish of most segments of Vietnamese
 leadership, however they differ among them-
 selves on other matters.  We know that our
 presence there is earnestly desired by most
 neighboring countries of southeast Asia.  We
 know that our purpose is to assist responsible
 a:nd responsive government and to enable
 Vietnam and its neighbors to maintain na-
 tional independence  against  external en-
 croachment.  We know that we have neither
 wished to "establish" nor "dominate" a Viet-
 namese government nor to seek for ourselves
 political, military, or economic advantage.
 Our dilemma flows in part from the fact
 that this knowledge is not shared by all of
 the Vietnamese people, is not accepted by the
 members of the Vietcong, is not believed 1n
 parts of  the less developed world still suf-
 fering the scars of recent colonial experience.
 Nor, in fact; is this understanding uniformly
 shared by our own people.
 The  dilemma is  sharpened further by a
 spreading doubt among leadership elements
 In  independent  southeast  Asian  countries
 that the United States has staying power.
 Thailand's  foreign  minister,  Thanat  Kho-
 man, recently warned members of the Over-
 seas  Press  Club:  "The  Thai  Government
 knows much better but some people are not-
 sure we can depend on outside help-especial-
 ly when there is so much talk of quitting and
 going home.    The Communists have never
 spoken that line of quitting.  When they go
 some place they stay there."
 In  part, at least, this skepticism  is fos-
 tered by the doubt among some Americans
 that any valid purpose led to our presence
 in Vietnam in the first place.
 THE ALTERNATIVES
 The lack of public understanding flows in
 part  from  inadequate  examination  of  the
 alternatives  confronting  the  United  States
 now.  In our opinion there are six choices:
 y-'   1. Continue as now.  Whether or not the
 Vietcong  are,  in  fact,  increasing  their  of
 fectlveness there is a growing conviction in
 Salgan, in the United States, and in much
 of  the rest of  the  world,  that this is  so.
 This alone makes continuation of our present
 policy undesirable.      The overriding hazard
 of the present policy is the undeniable fact
 that it has not provided sufficient psycho
 logical  and  political potency  to sustain  a
 Vietnamese Government.
 2. Withdraw.  This would violate our pledge
 not to abandon the  Vietnamese people.  It
 would manifest throughout the world a U.S.
 inability to long sustain an effort designed
 to frustrate Communist intentions.  The lm-
 plications  would  be  read  as  eloquently in
 Berlin or In Cuba, as they would be in Viet-
 nam, Indonesia, or India.  There can be no
 question that this alternative would require
 the Governments of the Philllppines, Thai-
 land, Taiwan, India, Japan, to reassess totally
 present policy and to reorient~toward-what
 would be the dominating new facts of Asian
 life.
 ("Neutralization" of Vietnam is not sug-
 gested here for a simple reason: genuine and
 reliable neutralization of Vietnam is not pos-
 sible at the present time.  What is most often
 talked  of  in  this  connection  is  merely  a,
 rhetorical  euphemism  designed  to  make
 withdrawal more palatable.   On  the other
 hand, the proposals discussed here are valu-
 able to part precisely because they do hold
 the promise that they may generate sufficient
 free  Vietnamese vitality to make true and
 assured  neutralization  possible  at  some
 future time.)
 3. Military  cordon  sanitaire  across  Viet-
 nam and Laos.  An estimated military force
 of up to 100,000 would be involved in mak-
 ing such a cordon truly effective and enemy
 penetration genuinely hazardous,  Its great-
 est contribution would be in providing hard
 evidence of new determination to maintain
 southeast  Asian  integrity.  Although  mili-
 tary  effect  of  interdicting  the  Vietcong's
 transport and supply may be limited, it is
 nonetheless  one  useful  alternative,  espe
 cially when employed with other steps out-
 lined here.
 4. Extend  military  action  to  the  north.
 Until  last  week,  steps  taken  in  this  di-
 rection  were,  In  our  judgment,  not  suffi-
 ciently explicit, either to rekindle Vietnam-
 ese faith in our intentions or to inspire con-
 fidence in other Asian countries that we are
 indeed willing  to accept risk  as  the price
 of  our  commitment  to  freedom.        The  in-
 creased"external, Communist intervention In
 South Vietnam has made it both reasonable
 and essential that there be a vigorous anti-
 Communist military response.  The limited
 air strikes  in North Vietnam by American
 and Vietnamese planes constituted such an
 appropriate response.
 There are many other forms of stronger
 American action and involvement and they
 are not mutually exclusive.  They include:
 (a) Formation of an open, well-publicized
 North  Vietnam liberation movement spon-
 soring major psychological  operations pro-
 grams, including paramilitary action, against
 the North Vietnamese regime.
 (b)  Establishment  of  an  International
 Voluntary  Corps  dedicated to the mainte-
 nance of free nations in the Mekong basin.
 This corps should consist primarily of vol-
 unteers from Asian countries but may also
 contain  a  liberal  admixture  of  Americans
 with  military  experience.   Operating  nor-
 mally in small units with sufficient air sup-
 port,  this force-under the sponsorship of
 the  proposed  North  Vietnam  Liberation
 Movement-would, harass the enemy wher-
 ever suitable targets exist, including targets
 within North  Vietnam.
 (c)  Positioning  of  U.S.  combat  forces
 within South  Vietnam to act as a general
 reserve-a  sizable  firefighting force.      Such
 a military contingent (perhaps as many as
 two brigades) should not be used for routine
 combat or security duties, but as an Imme-
 diate-reaction  fighting  force  intended  to
 engage  Vietcong  troops  in  fixed  positions.
 Desirably, combat elements from other na-
 tions will be attached to this force.
 (d)  Continued bombing of selected mili-
 tary targets In North Vietnam.  In contrast
 to the indiscriminate terrorist activity of the
 Vietcong in South Vietnam, the free world's
 concern for the Vietnamese people in both
 halves of the country make it undesirable for
 us to conduct warfare upon cities where the
 innocent will be hurt.  However, those mili-
 tary targets in North Vietnam which are vital
 to their aggressive capability and which can
 be destroyed with our assistance are, in our
 view,  legitimate  targets  for stage-by-stage
 destruction.
 What is the risk involved in such action?
 In our judgment the possibility of Chinese
 involvement in South Vietnam would be only
 slightly increased.  The ;possibility of Chi-
 nese help thrust upon North Vietnam would
 be greater.  However, this probability may be
 precisely what is needed  to make clear to
 even the most Communist leaders of North
 Vietnam  how  undesirable  such  help  is  to
 them in the long run.  A heightened aware-
 ness .of  this  danger  might,  in  fact,  force
 greater restraint upon  the Government In
 Hanoi than our present policy can achieve.
 Frankly, however, the direct military dam-
 age inflicted on  the  Communist regime in
 North Vietnam is th.e lesser of our reasons
 for  suggesting that these  steps  be  under-
 taken.. In our opinion, it is urgent that the
 people of free Vietnam be assured that Presi-
 dent Johnson means what he says-that we
 mean to stay and help, no matter what risks
 we must  incur.  It  is  equally urgent that
 these  intentions  be  understood  also  in
 Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia,
 the  rest  of  Asia,  and  the  world.  Stanch,
 long-term    American     commitment-fully
 communicated and understood-would pro-
 vide a lift to morale in free Vietnam, inject
 new vitality in the Vietnamese Government
 and require a new assessment of the United
 States  among  neighboring  countries  and
 among Asian allies elsewhere.
 There is one final reason we support this
 painful, course of  action.  Basic  require-
 ments for victory in Viettia.m are not primar-
 fly military.  They are psychological, social,
 a.nd economic.  Below we address ourselves
 to instruments which can meet the nonmili-
 tary aspects of the undertaking.  But neither  -
 the economic nor political measures we pro-
 pose will get off the ground without evidence
 o:f the seriousness of our. military intention
 Nor will our military commitment produce
 the desired results without the companion
 economic and psychological supports.
 America's experience in. relation to the in-
 stability in postwar Europe  is clearly rele-
 vant.  The Marshall plan did not begin to
 come to life until the physical security prom-
 ised by NATO was added.  Nor would NATO
 by itself have been meaningful without the
 human vision and economic future presented
 by the Marshall plan.
 #i. Forging a more popular or responsive
 government.  It is clear that the difficulties
 confronting any Vietnamese Government un-
 der Communist attack are enormous.   We
 can but sympathize  with those who carry
 the burdens of government in circumstances
 so frustrating and continuously demanding.
 It is possible that 20 years of civil war, co-
 lord.al war, and Communist insurrectionary
 war, have so debilitated the structure of gov-
 errunent as to preclude the immediate pos-
 siblity, no matter how desirable, of absolutely
 stable government.  There are political per-
 soriaitiea with nationalist backgrounds who
 are  deserving  of  our  help  and  encourage-
 ment,  We must do what we can to help them
 and. bring them forward.  At t'he same time,
 we must help to diminish the ;present conflict
 of personalities that has proved In past years
 to be so destructive.  In any event, we believe
 it is futile to concentrate, as we have in the
 past, on personalities, rather than on pur-
 poses, ideas, and Institutions.
 d. injection  of new  purpose.  If charis-
 matlr, leadership is unavailable, charismatic
 purpose can be found.  One aspect of that
 purpose  involves  the  modest  extension  of
 military effort discussed above.  It Involves
 the  clear  demonstration  that  the  United
 States means to remain committed even at
 enlarged risk.   And such charismatic pur-
 pose must, of necessity, accept as workable
 "the  best  available  choices  of  Vietnamese
 Government  personnel"-choices  made  by
 the Vietnamese not by us.  But our object
 would be to harness our\milttary commit-
 ment and the Vietnamese effort to an in-
 finitely larger objective than has previously
 motivated our participation.  It would make
 crystal clear that the objectives which unite
 us with the Vietnamese people, as with our
 other allies on southeast Asia, .are construc-
 tive and inextricably. linked to the welfare
 of all doutheaat Asian peoples.

 We suggest that all of  our military, po-
 litical, and economic programs in Vietnam be
 subordinated to a massive southeast Asian
 development program.  A Johnsolt plan for
 the full, flowering of southeast Asian econom-
 ic resources and independence will have as
 much potency  and promise  for  success  in
 that corner of the world ae the Marshall plan
 did !n Europe and the Tennessee Valley Au-
 thorit,y in the United States.
 The: Mekong Basin !s one of the world's
 richest  and  least  developed  areas.   In  an
 area of the world already food rich there ie an
 opportunity to harness the tributaries oP the
 Mekong Basin toward an economic flowering
 offering infinite promise to Laos, Cambodia,
 and Thalland ps well  as  to South Vietnam,
 and offering to the people and the Govern=
 ment  of  North  Vietnam  economic  oppor-
 tunity which only their blindness or non-
 cooperation can frustrate.  To Burma, Malay-
 sia, and even India, this would present an op?
 portunity" in  both  economic  and  political
 terms which, especially at this moment, could
 not  possibly  be  more  desirable.  To  the
 Philippines such a program would  provide
 the ea.me Inagna~tic opportunity for participa-
 tion axs led them generously to create and
 man Operation Brotherhood  a decade  ago.
 It would  also  offer  the first possibllitp of
 really involving the wealth and energy of the
 Japanese Government and people.  A John-
 son  tevelopment  plan  for  southeast  Aata
 would manifest to the entire world that the
 welfare of  the  people of southeast Asia 1s
 our onlq purpose.
 The Mekong Baeln development program
 will  provide  for  the  first' time  a' iuture-
 orient;ed thrust around which a Vietnamese
 resurl;ency program can be made vital and
 toward which the efforts of Americana, Ja-
 panese, Lao, Thai, Cambodians, and Filipinos
 can hopefully ba attracted.
 sustain popular support of Vietnamese Gov-
 ernment leaders.
 2. It will infuse new en.erpp into the Viet-
 namese already risking their lives !n daily
 defense against the Vietcong.
 3. The plan offers concrete reasons for the
 cooperative   involvement   of   neighboring
 southeast Asian countries as well as a gener-
 ous commitment able to ausi,ain emotionally
 an international corps of volunteers.
 4. It  contains  an enormous  Incentive to
 North Vietnam to turn away from its present
 fratricidal course.
 b. Finally, the Johnson plan constitutes a
 pioneering laboratory of hopeful consequence
 to other leas developed arena where Commu-
 nist insurrectionary warfare presently finds
 soil in which to sow the setnal convention,

 only  by  the  judicious  and  willing  use  of
 military power.
 THE MISSING LINK
 Wil;hin the last 3  years  the  Communist
 nations have revealed their inability to meet
 their  own  most  pressing  economio  needs.
 The  shortcut  to  the  future  has  suddenly
 proved to be a dead end of economic failure,
 recrlrpination, and political embarrassment.
 But this has not frustrated the wars of na-
 tionail  liberation  nor  prevented  the  Com-
 muntata from mounting insurrectionary war-
 tare whether in Congo or Vietnam.  Nfltional
 governments and native peoples assaulted by
 such  Communist ? purposes  have,  at -best,
 sought to sustain their own energy through
 defensive effort.  Virtually unused has been
 the enormous potential for hope which can
 be found only in the non-Communist, world,
 cooperatively employing the resources of the
 United  Staten  and  nations  friendly  to  !t
 whether  !n  Asia,  the  Paciflo,  or  Western
 Europe.
 We have offered to the Vietnamese people
 our assistance in their struggle for national
 : independence.  We have Palled, however, to
 harness that struggle and our assistance to
 an al:l but miraculous future, a flowering of
 man, his capab111tiee, his resources, his aspt-
 ratiolxs.  Ours  indeed !s the  truly revolu-
 ~ tionwry  opportunity.  The  Johnson  plan '
 offers  to southeast Asla  a  genuine  oppor-
 tunit;y to harness nature, enlarge justice, ex-
 tend llife, eradicate the scourges of illness and
 illiteracy and enable long-suffering peoples
 to reap the fruits of their soil and the"per-
 manent benefits of national independence.

 There have been no incidents in the valley

 y.rE!'NAM  HAMLET  REPrrLSEa  REDS-PENTAGON
 RELEASEa ACCOUNT OF RECENT CLASH
 (By Mark S. Watson)
 WASHINGTON,     September     2b.-Messages
 from the IIS. command in South  Vietnam
 today permitted the Pentagon to supply in
 almost unprecedented detail an account of a
 well-conducted  defense  and  counterattack
 recently, with the South Vietnam Govern-
 aientforces gaining a substantial euccesa over
 Vietcong guerrillas.
 It was at and near Luong Phu,  a  little
 hamlet of some 76 men, women, and children
 ~   in the swampy delta of the Mekong River,
 southwest  of  Saigon.     This  is  the  region
 where  the  Communist  Vietcong  has  Long
 been generally in control, even before 1964
 grhen  the  beaten  and  discouraged  French
 grlthdrew from southeast Asia.
 LOYAL  TO  GOVERNMENT
 Luong Phu, largely because  it  remained
 loyal to the government has long been sub-
 jected to Communist harassment, the  dis-
 patch from Saigon mentioning b0 incic~enta
 tlhus far in 1984, including 16 genuine  at-
 tacks,  of  which  the  latest  was  the  moat
 violent.
 In  the  official  account  of  this  occasion
 there were several aspects so important as
 t,~ attract attention.
 1. The  40  men  composing  the  hamlot's
 own  defense,  only  lightly  armed,  held  off
 the attack, with temporary lose of only an
 a:nuaunitlon bunker:
 2. A  group  of  them  had  the  a Irit  to
 a~unterattack and regain the bunk~r with-
 out loss of its contents, but wltti four of the
 loyal force killed.
 .RELIEF 1'ORCEa  CALLED
 8. A;ellef ioroe, summoned by radio; Dame
 grithta artlllery range  and provided  qutok
 asstetanae to the defense.,      ,.  .., ,      .
 4. The relief force commander, moving in
 by a II.B. landing craft  (ono of five Sa the
 Mekong Dettn's rivers)  was warned by one
 of his agents that a Vietcong force was in
 ambush near the riverbnnk,  awaiting him,
 after the familiar guerrilla, practice.
 He  opena3  fire  on  the  hidden glerrillas
 and broke u,p the ambush with large cas'ual-
 tlea, his own craft taking only one carious
 shot from tho guerrillas' 67-millimeter .rifle.
 The relief of Luong Phu was completed, with
 40 enemy dead around it and a larger number
 1n the ambush party carried away by river
 boats.
 It was this combination of stout resistance
 at the attack point, prompt radio report to
 the district command, quick advance of relief
 forces, and aleri;ness to the danger of am-
 bush, with which the Saigon authorities are
 obviously moat pleased.
 PATTERN  OI' COUNTERINSURGENCY
 Thta  is  the  pattern  of  their  countorin-
 surgency training, but nobody pretends that
 !t is easy to accomplish that operation with
 all its four phases perfectly executed.  W1:th
 any of  the four missing, the whale opera-
 tion has small chance of success.
 The  landing  craft  and  patrol  boats and
 motorized  junks  on the  several rivers  and
 canals  are-save  for  the  helicopters--tile
 prime  means  of.  rapid  movement of  rolri-
 iorcing  troops  and  weapons.     They  make
 possible a fairly rapid use of gone and heavy
 mortars.
 The  other  artillery  application  is  by'
 mounts of single guns in an entrenched posi-
 tion  (dotted over the countryside)  permit-
 ting movement of the gun throughout 880"
 and  prompt  laying  of  fire  on  any  target
 within range.
 This method presupposes the existence of
 excellent maps and prime ability to use them
 effectively for fire or an unseen target.  A
 moat encouraging aspect of the war in soutlx
 Vietnam !a that the maps do exist and that
 there is inereating skill in their efficient usD.
 CONTINUING  MYSTERY
 There is one continuing mystery- in Viet-
 nam,  namely the  reason  for  tho  Vietcong
 guerrillas' strange failure to tako wide ad-
 vantage of the South Vietnam Government's
 semiparalyais as a result of the most recent
 coup.  It would have seemed the !deal tlma
 for massive assaults.
 A  growing  theory  to  that  the  guerrilla
 movement has been hurt more than fe gen-
 erally realized, and compelled to slow down
 for a time in order tc> regather strength for
 another strong  assault at widely scattered
 points.
 Such an assault is still thought likely, the
 surprise being that 1't was not timed to take
 advantage of governmental confusion.

 VIETNAM VILLAGERa FICHT GN

 MEKONG DELTA, f30VTH VIETNAM:   F'i'Om th0
 distance  the  boom  of  artillery  sounded  a
 steady reminder that ills irontlines of the
 war were at hand.
 A  few  rice  paddies  away  there  was  the _-
 authoritative crackio of small arms fire which
 was, as to be expected, harassing the heli-
 copter that was whirring down on the dirt
 road next to the quaint and charming little
 village of thatched roofs that now gave haven
 to  tho  broken  bodies  of  two  American
 sergeants killed by an electrically detonated
 landmine,                   l
 It  was  a  road  of      bf tier  memories,  this
 muddy,  tortured  dirt  lane  surrounded  by
 emerald green rice paddies and a deceptively
 lyrical and limpid stream is which the b1g-
 eyed children played, not even .looking up
 when  the  angry  machinegun  burets  got
 Close and mere adults looked for cover.
 In the summer of 19f33 there had been a
 nasty fire--fight on the road, in which several
 American reporters lost face but not muck
 else when they made a run for it.  In Novem-
 ber  1969  this  reporter  revisited  the  road
 and its villages an the day that it claimed.
 the lives of twa TJnited Nations agricultural
 workers.  And new the death of the two ser-
 geants.
 FAMII;IEa FIGHT REDS
 Yet,  at the  exld  of  the  road  1s  a email
 village-Van Thien--whose 160 families have
 been overrun six times by the Vietcong and
 who still fight back.  And one reason they
 fight back  is  beraure  every  day  American
 advisers and Vietnamese soldiers, American
 aid  teams  and  Vietnamese  engineers  defy
 the danger and travel back and forth with
 their guns and supplies and medicines to help
 Van Thien try to e;uiy free.
 And this is the re:nl miracle of South Viet-
 nam-this Pact that somehow the war :Is stilt
 sought anywhere at all  with devotion and
 sacrifice and hope despite the selfish joust-
 inga of the politicians in Saigon, the power
 plays of the military, the riots of the draft-
 dodging students and the  political poisons
 spread by a handfill of power-hungry Bud-
 dhiat leaders whose Intrigues are totally dis-
 approved  by  the  genuinely  religious  Bud-
 dhiatshere in the countryside.
 Indeed, here in  tlxis section of the delta,
 I found the progress of the war far less de-
 pressing than I had expected.  Chaos, lack of
 direction, arbitrary arrests, and purges have
 taken their toll, of course.  But in  giddy,
 gaudy Saigon the spoked intellectuals and
 politicians do not knew the Vietcong first-
 hand and can indulge their political death
 wishes with a garlahl.y gay ignorance of what
 would happen to them if  the Communists
 took over.
 VIETCONG .aEPREDATIONa
 But in ,Van Thien it to only a short mo-
 ment in time since tlxe Vietcong disembow-
 eled the wife of the dLvtrict chief and kid-
 naped 14 youngsters of the village.  so long
 ae  there  is  the  aightest  hope  of  real  and
 effective outside help against the Vietcong,
 the people will fight to keep them out of the
 Van Thiens of the delta.
 Mytho  is  the  headquarters  for  the  7th
 Vietnamese Division, wixich guards four key
 provinces in the delta.  When I first visited
 Van Thien 1n the suanmer of  1983, it had
 just been liberated for the first time from a
 long period of Vietcong rule.  And elsewhere
 1n the delta, the fight against the Cotnnlu-
 nists, while tough and hard, was beginning
 to show results.  That:  summer perhaps 64
 ;percent of the population !n these key four
 provinces  were  under  central  Vietnamese
 control.
 Then came' the coup d'etat o! November
 1983, the murder of Diern and Nhu, the die-       .,
 integration of the entire fabric of Vietnam-
 oae  governmental  structure,  ail  of  which
 was taken as a signal by the  Vietcong to
 really go on the warpath.  Ae a consequence,
 `t+hen this reporter revisited the 7th Division
 provinces SII late Novemhrr 1983, it had been
 impossible to even go near :many areas that
 had been clean  and cl~+ar of Vietcong the
 previous summer.  By early 1984, the Viet-
 namese controlled less i,;llan 26 percent of
 these lour provinces.
 f           NEED TO BTAr/1' OVER
 "And  so; ?  said  the  American  colonel  in
 Mytho, "we had to start avor.  By April, we

 of a cove on Vu1xg Ro Bay hero, 240' miles
 northeast of Saigon and about? 80 miles south
 of Nha Trang, site of a majcx' U.S. military

 A routine helicopter patrol uncovered the
 Cacho  Tuesday.   Flying  over  the  bay,  the
 helicopter crew sighted what looked like a
 drifting island.  Then, heavy fire came up
 from the island.  It turned Dili to be a well-
 camouflaged  ship,   about  400-feet         long.
 South   Vietnamese   fighter-bombers         were
 called in and sank the vessel.

 troops into the area.  After heavy fighting,

 COIIRAGE AT VIETNAM OUTPOST
 (Sy Marguerite Higgins)
 PLEB  ME,  VIETMAN,-The morning had be-
 gun a/ith a mine disaster.  Literally.  It was
 a "Jumping Betty" mine-one of those that
 ? jumpli out of the dirt and explodes In the
 sir.   And  so  it  had  cruelly  mangled  the
 bodies of  18 of the work detail that Capt.
 Ronnie Mendoza, of Los Angeles, had sent to
 repair' about three and a half miles of the
 red  flirt  jungle  road  the  Vietcong  had
 severed  by  digging  great,  gaping  ditches
 aGIOSa it.
 ~   Many of the wounded were only 11 to 14
 years  of  age,  children  or  relatives  of  the
 Vietnamese  and  Montagnard  (non-Mongol
 rriountain people)  soldiers who, along with
 Captain Mendoza's  12-man  team, use  this
 isolated  outpost  near  the  Lao  border  for
 patrols and  ambushes and  other  counter-
 guerrlllal operations against the Vietcong.

 lift  out  the  wounded.   The  two  pilots-

 and C1apt. Chsrlio E. Bryant, of Ocilla, Ga.-
 epoke~ feelingly of the courage with which
 the  big-eyed  Vietnamese  and  Montagnard
 children tried to suppress their cries of pain.
 Thla is high, spectacular  country  where
 the jungle covered mountains rise, steeply,
 T,000 feet high and  where air currents in
 the intervening valleys can be tricky.  The
 helicopter bumped and. dipped as it fought
 the turbulent currents,
 From the air, Plei Me is sn eyesore with
 Its barbed wire outer fences, its trenches, its
 mortar emplacements and sandbags, its brick
 and tin barracks building.  It seems an im-
 probable and unexpected scar in the green
 jungle.
 In this part of Vietnam the jungle trails
 are prowled not just by the Communist Viet-
 cong  but by mighty  tigers  that  European
 huntrrs once traveled tar to shoot.
 And despite  the morning tragedy, -Men-.

 his  Iipeclai  forces,  Including  2  American

 mission was to try and spot possible infll-,
 tratiC~n routes and the supply dumps  that
 the C;ommunistm always prepare in advance
 at poffnts a day's march apart.

 CONCEP:C  OF  "INTERNAL  REVOLT"  IN  130IITH

 WABIIINGTON, February S0.-From the tor-

 That is tlxe wall-publicized radio order from
 Communist  Vietcong  headquarters  in  the
 north to all  Vietcong agents south of -the

 The promptness with which the order was

 But more important in its long-raxige politi-

 public opinion, which communism has tried
 for years to delude with this "internal revolt"
 fiction, now is in better position to know that
 even  while  the  Communist  powers  were
 agreeing to the Geneva neutralization pact
 the Communist machine in North Vietnam
 was  already  beginning  !ta  subversion  and
 assassination program in the south.
 In this program of deception a large in-
 fluence was the International Control Com-
 mission, set up to assure that the pledges of
 neutrality  were  kept.     By  1981,  reports of
 ?   1,200  offensive  "incidents"  by  Communist
 agents, ranging from one-man assassinations
 to fairly large scale military actions, had been
 laid before the commission.  None was acted
 on.
 The reason given by an American White
 Paper was that the Polish Communist mem-
 any charge that might embarrass the Com-
 munist Vietcong, and the Indian member re-
 fused to start  an Snquiry that would  em-
 barrass  his  Polish  colleague.        Opposed  by
 two, the one remaining member, the Cana-
 dian, was powerless.
 LEADEAB KNOWN
 For some reason, possibly the dift3culty in
 remembering the oriental names, the Viet-
 cong leaders have, with two exceptions, re-
 maflxed largely unknown  to the  American
 public.
 There is no mystery about the others, for
 captured or defecting Vietcong agents and
 officers have divulged almost all details of the
 Red machine for which they worked.  Full
 information  about  that  complex and  aur-
 prlsingly  efficient mechanism and its oper-
 ators at all levels now can be reported with-
 out endangering security.
 Of the two familiar names one fa that oP
 Ho Chi Minh, head of the North Vietnam
 political  government and of  1ta Lao Dong
 (Workers)  Party, and tirelessly active Sn its
 all-important Central Research (Intelligence
 and Operations)  Agency and other working
 elements.  Tho other fairly familiar name is
 that of Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, Defense Minis-
 ter, one of the world's great guerrilla leaders.
 The Lao Dong Party follows the pattern of
 General, Ho Chi Minh, that of Russia's usual
 one-man-in-two-jobs, premier of the nation
 and secretary general of the party.  The mili-
 tary is subordinate to Ho, the political chief,
 and all the way down the line and Into the
 kindred Lao Dong of South Vietnam at all
 levels the political leaders uniformly com-
 mand the military.  That is one way of as-
 suring unity.
 FRONT CREATED IN 1980
 To provide a cloak of respectability and
 conceal in some measure the responsibility
 ' of the Hanoi organizers with murder and in-
 surrection against Saigon, Ho Chf Minh in
 1980  created  the  "Front for Liberation  of
 South Vietnam:'
 It is still guided wholly by Ho Chi Minh's
 Central  Committee,  immediately  directing
 work in the "South Central" zone (just south
 of  the  17th  parallel  border)  and  in  the
 "Nambo" region  (south and southwest, in-
 cluding Saigon and the Mekong Delta) .
 For the Central Committee, supervision is
 exercised in Hanoi by a "Committee for Su-,
 pervasion of the South;' made up of Le Duc
 Tho,  of  the  Politburo,  Phon  Hung,  Vice
 Premier of North Vietnam, and Brig. Gen. Ng
 uney Van Vlnh, chairman of the board for
 reunification.  Each of the two zones has its
 own secretary general, a deputy and a dozen
 members;  each  its -agencies  for  training,.
 propaganda and action.
 To this political Leadership the military, as
 remarked, 1s subordinate.  Its principals era

 Committee of  the  South  but pointedly. a
 "junior member"; Brig. pen. Nguyen Don, fn

 of the Lao Dong in Hanoi, and Brig. Gen. Van

 politican.

 tion" unit for subversion, forgery, arming,

 command,  fa  actively  directed  by Ho  Chi

 in South Vietnam was at Vlnh Linlx, the tar-
 get of Sunday's fierce bombing attack.  Other
 centers handle Cambodian and overseas 1n-
 te111gerace, with Gen. Hoang Dao, Col. Le Caa
 and Col. Van Trong as principal agents.
 This is regarded as the agency chiefly re-
 sponsible for conveying Ho Chf Minlx's direc-
 tives  straight  to  the  guerrilla  packets  in
 South Vietnam, and seeing that tlxe supply

 AGGRESSION  ADMITTF'D
 (By Joseph Alsop)
 At last, the administration's pol.lcymakera
 are somewhat reluctantly admitting the hn-
 portance  of  the  North  Vietnamese- troop
 movements  into  South  Vietnam and Laos.
 Being  clandestine,  these  Communist  troop
 movements were long and obstinately pooh-
 poohed.  Now, however, they are an? af6cially
 acknowledged fact.        While  the tact is  ad-
 mated,  it.9  meaning  is  still  being  played
 down.    Even  the  resulting  solid  proof  of
 North  Vietnamese  aggression has not been
 greatly stressed.  As for the military lnzplica-
 Lions,  they  have  been  hardly  me~ttioned;
 yet they are potentially very great indeed.
 hx Laos, to begin with, the whole balance
 of the war has bean upset.  It is a tiny war.
 The non-Communist Laotians, although they
 have fought very well against Laotian Com-
 munit]t sympathizers, have always faired 111
 in their rare engagements with Nortlx Viet-
 namese units.  Hence the appearance 1n Laos
 of several additional North Vietnanxeso bat-
 tallona changes the whole local outlook,
 Because Lsoe is both a subsidiary wax thea-
 ter and a corridor to South  Vietnam, it is
 not quite certain how the additional  bat-
 talions are to be used.  Some think they are
 intended for use in Laos, since they :have
 moved into the heart of Ines to the went of
 the corridor-region of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
 If this is correct, the brliliant Communist
 commander, Ge.n. V1 Nguyen Giap, must be
 planning a semifinal test of strength in Latos.
 Because of the generally misty chara.xter
 of every Laotian situation, a prompt Anxeri-
 can riposte to such a test of strength will
 be extra diilicult.  And a major Commurals~t
 thrust in Laos will have the gravest rc+per-
 cussiona in South Vietnam, unless the Anxeri-
 can riposte is both prompt and massive.
 It is equally possible, however, that theses
 new battalions spotted in Laos care eventually
 destined to be axxaved into Soui;h  Vletnarn.
 For n good many rnonths, organized battal-
 ions of the North Vietnamese Army have be+sn
 filtering  into the South  Vietnamese fight-
 ing-moving by truck down the Ho Chi Minll
 Trail to the Chepnae region, crossing the bor-
 der in small bands, and then reforming anal
 marching to thelx assigned areas of  opera-
 tions.
 Thoro  have long been plenty of signs to
 -prove that the North. Vlotnameae had reached
 the  stage  of  sendhxg  arganizrd  battalions
 'into the fighting, Instead of mere cadres to
 lead their guerrillaxs.  As noted, Tor instance,
 !n  this  reporter's  recent  dispatches  from
 Saigon, young North Vietnamese army con-
 scripts are sow  quite  often sound  among
 prisoners of war.
 The invasion of. south Vietnam by two,
 three, or even four new Communist bat-
 talions per month may not sound like muoh
 by the standards oP modern war.  But this
 war la Vietnam 1N ao~ bery' modern.  Ara
 entire province may bo defended by no :mare
 than flue government battalions.
 If the Comnxuntsts already have seven bat-
 talions, as they do in Quang Nat Prov.tnce,
 for instanoe, the addition of two more bat-
 talions may cause the Dien Bien Phu-like
 disaster that Sa General Giap's obvious aim
 In this phase.  That is the real meanirag of
 the persistent Communist troop movement
 into South Vietnam.
 For this very reason, Gen. Maxwell Taylor
 has repeatedly recommended stronger, nxnre
 direct aatiorx against the North Vietnaracae.
 He wanted something much  more effective
 than the brief retaliatory raid after the lrari-
 dent in the Gulf of Tonkin.  He wanted rr..-
 taliation after the attack on the V.S. alrfl~ld
 at Bien Hoa.  Ho again asked for retaliation
 after a V.S. olllcera barracks Sn Saigon waxy
 destroyed by aCommunist-planted bomb,
 The  recommendations of  General  Taylor
 were  disapproved by President  Johnson  in
 all three instances.  As a leas dangerous sort
 of retaliation, the President instead author-
 ized bombing of the Ho Chi Minh T.ra11, first
 by the Laotian air force, and then by the V.S.
 fighter-bombers  that  recently  destroyed  a
 key bridge at Ban Ban.
 The degree of power this deployed against
 the inflltratorra mady be gaged from the fact
 that one-half the Laotian air force has just
 been put out of action by a single accidental
 bomb explosiorx 1n an airplane hangar.  In ,
 any case, mere, air attacks  on the Ho Chl
 Minh Trail  are  wildly unlikely to produce
 any solid result, even fi made with 10 times
 the power,
 The truth is? I:1xa war in southeast Asia la:
 steadily  going  from  bad  to  worse.  The
 enemy fa getting bolder, and he is steadily ',
 reinforcing his frontline troops.  The rein-
 forcement  is  not  being  countered.  Hence
 there is no hope of any counteroffensive, un-
 less President Johnson has important sur-
 prises up his sleeve.

 RED A6IAN BIITLDVF CONFIRMED
 (By Al':uxrey Marder)
 V.S. officials confirmed yesterday that there
 has been increasefi infiltration of Communist
 North Vietnamese tx~oc.>pa into Laos and South
 Vietnam.    But  they  called  it  a  cause  for
 continuing concern, not sudden alarm.
 The Communist buildup of forces in both
 places during 198~I  and continuing into re- '
 cent weeks 1s slgxxlflcant in relative terms,
 but not, a dramatic or grave turn, officials said.
 In  both  on-the-record  and  background
 comments, admtniatration officials sought to
 demonstrate an attitude of skeptical calm-
 ness about recently published reports that
 the conflicts on the Indochina peninsula may
 be approaching a stage of more mass:lve, open
 warfare.
 Few hard facts or figures were disclosed in
 the   process.  Officials  said   more   details
 should be  available.  early  next  week  after
 consultatlona with the i7.S. mission in Saigon,
 capital of South Vietnam.
 It became  lncreardn$ly evident yesterday
 that both in South Vietnam and in Wash-

 about the facts and 'the significance of the
 Increased ~Commwxlst  infiltration.

 To buttress that position, administration
 officiate said that white there has been in-
 crea:eed Communist infiltration, North Viet-
 nam. has by no means committed all its power
 to either the Laotian or South Vietnamese
 conflicts.
 Perhaps more  importantly, these  officials
 assert, the  Chlneae  Communists, who  give
 the  North  Vietnamese  moral and  physical
 support, continue to demonstrate consider-
 able caution about any direct involvement
 with the United States.
 State Department Press Officer Robert J.
 McCloskey Bald  yesterday  that  there  have
 been  indications in  recent weeks of North
 Vietnamese military movements Into south-
 ern and central Laos.
 'McCloskey said he could riot state either
 the size or objective of the inflltratlon.  He
 said? in answer to questions, that the troop
 movements might or might not be a seasonal
 increase coinciding with the ending of the
 rainy season, a shifting of forces, or a move-
 ment designed primarilq to send rainforce-
 menta to South Vietnam.
 Many officials here believe that the troops
 are 'being funneled through the so-called Ho
 Chi Mlnh aetwork of trails in Laos, for use
 fa South Vietnam.
 McCloskey described  the  situation  as "a
 oaus.e for concern but not for alarm."  He
 said, "We're following the situation closely."
 Other authoritative sources said it appears
 that. the thousands of South Vietnamese who
 were being trained in North Vietnam for use
 is the south are about used up, and that the
 Communist  northerners  are  now  sending
 down native-born men from the Red terri-
 tory.
 Brut white there have been published re-
 ports that between  16,000  and 20,000 men
 have been filtered into South Vietnam from
 the north during IB84, official sources here
 yesterday  would  speak  only  of  "several
 thousand" men.  In addition, it was said,
 thesis numbers have been offset bq an in-

 This concentration and the increases  in
 supply convoys during the recent dry season
 are  reported  to  have  raised  fears  among
 U.$. officials, lnficludtng Ambassador Henry

 tions.

 forces across the  Laotian  border into the
 central  Vietnamese highlands  wl1lle  South
 Vietnamese Government forces ware largely
 concentrating on fighting guerrillas south of

 Other officials suspect that the aptivity in
 southern Laos may be a prelude to future
 offensives against Saravane and Attopeu, two
 rightwing  strongholds  in  southern  Laos,
 Hostile forces nearly surround  both .towns
 now.
 Since neither town !s Sn the Mekong Val-
 ley, some analysts here are concerned lest the
 Pathet  Lao  assume  they  can  be  attacked
 without fear of American intervention.  The
 United  States  has  often  warned  that  1te
 mantle  of  protection  extends  over  the
 Mekong Valley bordering Thailand,
 The  stepped-up  operations  in  southern
 Laos, officials said, began last fall and have
 Increased  in tempo  this spring since  pro-
 Communiet Pathet Lao unite gained control
 of the Nakay Plateau in January.
 These officials consider the southern opera-
 tions to be unrelated to recent offensives by

 around the Plains des Jarres lxx north-cen-
 tral Laos.

 Air Force T-28 fighter-bombers, supplied by
 the United 6tates, have parried out strikes
 this month against some Pathet Lao posi-
 tions in southern Lnos as well.
 Officials hors have also dropped hints that
 some plans held Sn readiness would call for
 the South Vietnamese Air Force to raid Com-
 munist supply rautea in Laos and possibly in
 North Vietnam.
 So far such raids are considered a fairly
 distant possibility.  Premier Nguyen I{hanh
 has told U.$. otfictale he fe opposed to carry-

 developed a more stable base at home.
 Tha princlpaf roads from North  Vietnam
 into southern Laos are Route 8, from the city
 of Vlnh through the Nape Pass, and Route

 over the reported shipment last  month  of

 it eniorrrs dollar control, does net ask for
 details of  quetzals-for-dollars  traraaactlons.
 The quetzal is on a par with the d.o.llar.
 Thu theory prevalent here fa thrlt the un-
 dorground  movement  is  being  su;pp:iled  by
 adheres#a    traveling   from    Mexlna.  This
 theory, vaguely defined, holds that h  #xansac-
 tions such as the quetzal-dollar excllange rho
 messengers far the guerrilla forces ext:ruggle
 in the Fonda from Mexico.  The question of
 finances arises from the certainty that the

 mounting and that there is no wf',ry to ac-

 Last year's North Vietnamese harvest was
 at  least  20  percent  below  1982's  middling
 harvest.  Some starvation. to visible but there
 is no general disaster in eight.
 Moscow has flatly turned down  a direct
 Hanoi plea for aid to auppart the war. 'The
 North Vietnamtv;e reason that they can't af-

 Peiping, and that Peiping's gasping economy
 Can give them little help in terms of food
 or weapons.
 Morale  among  the  Co:mraunist  Vietcong
 troops in the guerrilla war is a continuing
 problem for the North Vietnamese Govern-
 ment.  Analysis have seen ak>solutely no evi-
 dence that the dirislon between pro-Peiping'
 and  pro-Moscow  camps, seriously  hampers
 the war effort, as such.  Tlxe major Hanoi
 decision  to  side  openly  with  Peiping  was
 bound to leave a disappointed minority but
 there have been no demotioaxs, no dissident
 voices raised.
 Hanoi has a healthy, decisive respect for
 U.S.  military power  and aeex  the  superior
 weapons, equipment, and manpower of the
 South Vietnamese are still a major obstacle
 to victory.  The bommunlata fear an escala-
 tion of the war, bringing an open U.S. lnva-
 slon of North Vietnam, and this has tRnded
 up to now to keep the Comtnunlat mtlitary
 effort within s limited framework.
 While the Vietcong at tim,os has ate guer-

 It would be a mistake to allow the world
 to  trelieve  that  the  people  of  the  United

 viaion on the question of wlxether we should
 or  i=hould  not  negotiate  a  settlement  in
 South  Vietnam.  There  aro  tiifferencea  of
 opl.nion, but they do not relate to the idea of
 negotiation; they concern a;ho ]rind of nego-

 ly irx favor of negotiations ghat would end
 tho lighting, set up enforceable peace tense,
 preserve the rights of our friends in South
 Vlet:nam and leave intact the honor and pres-

 aentixnent is against negotiations that would
 not do this.  The  choice  is not  "negotia-
 tione+" or "no negotiations."  The question
 is: "'G7hat kind of negotaatlons7"'
 I1~I 1954, the French  were driven into ne-

 Chi Manta and by allowing the EDC treaty to
 fail i'.n  the French chamber her encouraged
 that collaboration.  But Frexich. power was
 being drained away in Indochina.  The na-

 can farglve a weak power at the end of 1te
 resotu'cee for upeotting its allies in Europe,
 for doe+erting its comrades in axms in Indo-
 china ttetd !or closing its eyes to the conso-

 The United States, however, [a not a small
 European power at the end of its military,
 econcrrnic,  and political  resources.   It  is  a
 great  global  power  whose  rxtlglxt  !a  undi-

 standards.  It  cannot  permit .savage  re-

 the Sav Vet Union or any other intervenor po-
 litical ronceasiona at the expense of Euro-

 Many  feared  at  the  time  that  the  13b4

 indeed they permitted it to continue an terms

 up operations on an even greater scale, year

 vital to our interests.
 At the same time, it must be acknowledged
 that nothing is possible without a primary
 effort by the South  Vietnam people them-

 their war.  And it !a a war which only South
 Vietnam forces can  win.  The struggle for

 the South Vietnamese may fail completely on
 these  fronts.  If  that  happens,  regretfully
 and sorrowfully, it will be necessary for u$
 to be governed by what we can do and not
 by what we would like to do or what we ought
 to do.
 At the same time that we proceed to the
 more effective prosecution of the war and the
 more  efficient  organization  of  the  civilian
 Government in  South  Vietnam,  we should
 continuously make known the very limited
 nature of our objectives.  Unlike the French
 in 1964, we have no colonial ambitions.  We
 wish to see an independent South Vietnam,
 safe from external aggression, free to choose
 in pesos the kind of government its people
 wish (even if it Sa a Communist government
 in the end), open to normal trade and lnter-
 caurse with North Vietnam and other Asian
 neighbors  with  whom  it  surely  must  be
 closely  associated  in  the  future.  Such  a
 South Vietnam would not menace any Asian
 neighbor or threaten any legitimate interest
 of North Vietnam.
 Mare than mere oral assurances are needed
 to assure the future of suoh a country.  There
 are, however, many aorta of satisfactory per-

 Surely there is .not much mystery about

 WABHINaTON CLOSE-UP-VIETNAM: Tao
 DOMINO THEORY
 (By Crosby S. Noyes)      1
 With the way things are going in Vietnam
 it !s only natural that a certain amount of
 thought should be given these days to the
 domino theory.
 It was President Eisenhower who first used
 the metaphor to explain and justify our pres-
 ence  !n  Vietnam.  It -our  position  there
 should topple, he thought, a whole series of
 non-Communist  states  !n  southeast  Asla
 .would almost automatically fall under Com-
 munist rule.
 Tho  domino  theory  1a a  good  deal  leas
 popular in adminiatration circles today than
 It once was..  A's the political situation. in
 Vietnam deteriorates and the passibility of
 ?;Co?nmun3st.victory grows, earlous considers-
 ,tloa-fa being .given to the ways and means
 of 1lmltbyg the eatent of a possible defeat
 there.
 Since adminiatratlon leaders tend to ques-         [From the National Observer, Dec. 28, 1984]

 total withdrawal of American military power            THEORY
 from southeast Asia 1n the event of a with-            The speaker was no leftist demagog, though
 drawal from Vietnam. -The argument some- '
 times made by Vietnam bitter-enders, that St-; his attack on U.S. pclicq was full of words
 would mean a retreat back to Hawaii and an  like Lnterference and c;oloninltsm.  The epeak-
 end to our presonce in Asla, is rejected.
 It can be argued otx the contrary that them:
 !s no country In the world harder to defend
 against Communist subversion than South
 Vietnam.  The almost ltnpossiblo task of try-
 ing to create a country where none exists in'
 the midst of a revohttion that had beon in
 progress for a decade before the Americans
 arrived would not confront us elsewhere.
 Thailand, for exrttn,ple, would provide in-
 finitely more favorable ground for resletanca3
 to the  Chinese Communist  thrxtst.        There,
 at least, there !a a sense of national identity
 and  a  tradition  of  government  authority.
 And while the htstaty of the country is not
 exactly one of heroic defense of freedom, the
 Thai,  with  encouragement,  have  shown
 themselves  quite  determined  in  opposing
 Oommunist pressures.
 Tlxeso  pressures,  perhaps,  could  be  ex-
 peeled to increaso  fi the position in  Viet-
 nom were lost.  But the problems of waging
 s subversive war against a country as rela-
 tively well organized. as Thailand are enor-
 mously  different than  in  Vietnam.         There
 is no reason to suppose that Mao Tse-lung's
 guerrillas would find tttD waters of Thailand's
 population very congenial.
 Open military pressure through Laos would
 involve  substantial  risks  for  the  Chinese.
 Aa a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty
 Organization,  Thailand  could  call  on-and
 presumably  receive-~-std      from   Australia,
 France, New. Zealand, Pakistan, the Phllip-
 pines,  Britain,  and  the  United  States.
 Under  the  terms  ai  this treaty, in fact,
 the power of  the Un.lted States !e already
 committed in Thailand, to the enrtent that
 !t  might  be  needed  to resist either .Com-
 munist subversion or outright attack.  And
 though them is little reason to believe that
 our commitment would reach anything like
 the proportions in Vietnam, there !s no rea-
 son whatever  to suppose that it would be
 withdrawn.
 There are those in Washington today who
 deplore this state of nffairs.  The advocates
 of worldwide .American "disengagement" are
 Sncilned to the theory that American power
 and  prestige should never have been com-
 mited in  Vietnam  in tine first place.         And
 from here they argue that its commitment in
 any of the so-called Bait areas of southeast
 Asia-which, presumably, means all of it-
 should be avoided at a11. coat.
 There  are  also  tho:ae  who  contend  that
 any substantial transiel' of American power
 to  Thailand  would  simply  serve  to  invite
 increase  Communist pressures  there.     The
 converse of  the domirxo theory is that the
 only way to contain the spread of militant
 communism in the area is by strict nonin-
 volvement and the encouragement of neutra-
 list states on the periphery of China.
 The trouble with botkt theories is that they
 are belied by the evidence.  The evidence is.
 that strong Communist pressure already is
 being brought to bear on neutral states in
 southeast Asia.  It may lne that these pres-
 sures  can  be  resisted  by  reasonably  well
 Integrated nations with a reasonable amount
 of  political- stability a:nd military backing.
 It is not to minimize the seriousness of s
 defeat in Vietnam to say that 1t would not
 necessarily mean defeat everywhere.
 It is time to facto up ten the fact that we
 are engaged in a contfnufng process of con-
 taining or at least ilntiting  the throat of
 Communist  China  which  threatens  all  of
 southeast Asia.  To pretend that this thrust
 er was, instead, an American ally In a war
 against  communlent,.  .'rauth  Vietnnm's  Lt.
 Gen. Nguyen Khanh.  And his words raised
 serious  questions  nbox.tt  the  very  basis  of
 American policy in southeast Asia.
 It is better, said General Khanh, "to live
 poor but proud as frr..c citizens o! an inde-
 pendent  country  ratTtrr  than  in  ease  and
 shame as sl2vca of th.e foreigners and Com-
 munists."  South Viet;nnm, he added, should
 be prepared to go it alone against the Com-
 munist Vietcong and epxtrll further U.S. help.
 Washington  was  atunn.ed  by  last  week's
 attack  from the  wily  ex-Premier,  once re-
 garded  ns  South  Vlei.nam's  best  hope  of
 achieving victory over lied guerrillas.  And
 the question,  once  aoatn, was being asked
 in the Nation's Capital, "What would hap-
 pen if the United Staaea pulled out7"
 CDRTAILMEN I'  O1F  AID7
 To  be  sure,  no  high  aciministralion  af-
 11cia1 went so far as to urge outright with-
 clrawal.  But Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
 expressing the  Governtnenf,'s opposition  to
 Iaat week's Saigon house. cleaning by young
 army officers, hinted at g curtailment of pro-
 posed  U.S,  aid.  "Obvicntslq,"  ho  said,  'Yi
 taxers are problems of un.ity,. there are certain
 ;binds of assistance that are simply not iea-
 aal.ble."   And  Senate  Majority  Leader  MIxE
 IUdANSr?tEr.D revived his proposaxl to transfer the
 q,ueation of Vietnam's future from the battle-
 tleld to the conference table.  "I don't think
 neutrality is a bad word," he said.
 Indeed,  the voices  urging a sharp  reap-
 Frznisal of America's Asian policy received an
 additional boost on Christmas Eve.  A ter-
 roriet bomb exploded in the garage of tho
 nxaln V.S. officers' billet in Saigon, killing 2
 .Aanericsna  and  Injuring  110 persons.   The
 bomb  apparently  was  smuggled  into  the
 heavily guarded building !n a U.S. jeep, an-
 at;her indication of lncreasitl~ Vietcong bold-
 ness despite the intense U.S. effort in South
 Vietnam.
 Why doesn't the United States pull out of

 WHAT THE REDS wOD'IJ7 GOBBLE
 L:xndlceked  Laos,  alread jr  txvo-thirds  in
 f7ommuniat hands, would be swiftly gobbled
 xtp by the Reds.  Thailand, wlxiclx caved in to
 Japanese invaders after only a'hours of fight-
 ing in December 1941, would sue for some
 ar:c:ommodation with Red Cktina in :hope of
 preserving a semblance of iGs tang-cherished
 independence  from  foreign  rule.   Burma,
 whc~so government already host cut most of its
 ties with the West, would become little more
 tkxall a.Chinese province.  Cambodia, recently
 professing friendship with China, would suc-
 ctun~b quickly to Communist domination.
 7'1te domino theory extends even further.

 A clear-cut Communist victory in South
 Vietnam,  the  domino  theorists  maintain,
 would  have  worldwide  repercusalona.    The
 Commu.nlats !n Peiping would win the argu-
 ment  with  the  Communists  in  Moscow
 over how to spread their ideology.  Commu-
 nlsta would expand their Chinese-style aub-
 versive activities in Africa and South Amer-
 ica, confident that the United States would
 refuse i;o become involved in another expen-
 sive guerrilla war.
 LEAV)4 THE WEAPONB HEHIND7   ~
 The clomino theory is based, of course, on
 the presumption that without U.S, aid South
 Vietnam would collapse before the Commu-
 nista.  But if the United States did withdraw,
 most pIobably American weapons and equip-
 ment now stored in that country would be
 left belxind.  The South  Vietnamese armed
 forces +would certainly not succumb to the
 Communnsat guerrillas overnight.
 But psychologically, South Vietnam would
 be weakened.  Tho South Vietnamese mili-
 ?   tary  ei'tuation,  alter  all,  has  steadily  de-
 teriorated despite American aid of more than
 >a1,600,000 a day and the presence of 22,000
 American advisers.  Without American sup-
 port, tkte best guess fa that the South Viet-
 namese would quickty seek a political, rather
 than a military, solution to the Red threat.
 The Comaiuniats probably would be willing
 to negotiate acease-fire, figuring it would be
 less expensive  t0 diem to subvert the Gov-
 ernment from within.
 '    RATTLE  WITH  NO FRONTLINEa
 The 17nited Staten, even if it pulled out of
 South  Vietnam,  still,  would  remain  the
 atrongelst military power in Aaia.  The  7th
 Fleet  now  protects  Formosa  from  Com-
 monist Chinese lnvnslon and could quickly
 hustle troops to any Asian country threat-
 ened by' Communsst mititary forces.  But, the
 domino  theorists  say,  the  7th  Fleet  has
 felled to prevent Red subversion in Laos and
 South Vietnam.  Although the United States
 is the vvorld'a mightiest military power, they
 say, nuclear bombs, tanks, and aircraft car-
 riers aria of little use against a guerrilla force
 fighting;  a  battle  with  no  front  lines.
 At a prase conference last week, Secretary
 of Statss Dean Ruak ducked a question about
 whether the United States still subscribed to
 He did say, however, that if South Vfet-
 nam  were  lost  to  the  Communists,  "they
 would silmply move the problem to the next
 country' and the next and the next.  And,
 as I sa;f, this is not dominoes.  This is the
 kind oY Marxism that comes out of Peiping."
 Mr, Ruak asserted that South  Vietnam's
 "primax'y requirement" in the fight against
 the Communists 1s national unity.  "Unity,"
 he said? "would be worth many, many divi-
 sions."  But there was no unity in South
 Vietnam last week.
 The latest upheaval began in the same way
 as moat of the previous coups and attempted
 coups~?with  the rumbling  of trucks filled
 with soldiers in the streets of Saigon.  The
 purge vas  carried  out  speedily.          Soldiers,
 under  oommand  of  a  clique  of           9  junior
 officers, arrested moat of the members of the
 ib-man High National Counoil, the country's
 provisional  legislature,  and  several  dozen
 other political figures.
 The officers acted, they said, because the
 council .was dominated by "counter-revolu-
 tionary elements that wore acting against
 thA spirit of national unity."  The arrested
 council members, the officers said, had been
 "conspiring"  against  the  armed  torcee  in

 cers  formed  an  organizatfoxx  called  the
 Armed Forces Council, with no representa-
 tion from the senior  officers.  71xe council
 then drew up an order calling for mandatory
 retirement  of  all  officers  with  at  least  26
 years' service.  This would rehire about 40
 officers,  including  Maj.  Cien.  Duong  Van
 Minh, former Premier who is popular with
 South Vietnam's Buddhists.
 The High National Council refused to ap-
 prove the order.  So the ]union officers abol-
 ished  the  legislative  group.  The  purge
 leaders,  Air  Commodore  Nguyen  Cao  Ky,
 commander of the air force, and Brlg. Gen.
 Nguyen Chanh Thi, commander of the let
 Army Corps, defended the military's right to
 "act  as  mediator"  of  disputes  within  the
 Government.
 The officers stud their move 'ryas aimed at
 eliminating political Interference !n the con-
 duct or the antiguerrilla war.  Ilttt, although
 they disbanded  the  legislative  arm of  the
 Government, they pledged contl:nued support
 to Premier Tran Van Huong and his Cabinet.
 The Premier has been under attack by mili-
 tant Buddhist organizations almost'slnce he
 took office October 30.  The purge leaders in-
 dicated they believed their move would pave
 the way for reconciling the Btxddhlsts and
 the Huong government.
 MOTIVES  CALLED  SINCEIRE
 The U.B. Embassy in Saigon quickty op-
 posed the purge.  Conceding that the officers'
 motives in attempting to atabilaze the Gov-
 ernment  were  sincere,  Embassy  officials
 said the purge would only further disrupt the
 Government.  U.S. Ambassador Maxwell D.
 Taylor held hurried conaultatiotts with the
 ]union officers, General Khanh, and Premier
 Huong.  The officers refused to bstclc down.
 General Khanh'a position in the nxaneuyer-
 ing was  unclear,  but there were plenty of
 rumors.  One said he had been at odds with
 the junior officers in recent weeks because of
 his  refusal  to  pledge  his  support  to  Mr.
 Huong, his successor as Premier.  '.Iris junior
 officers were said to have threatened Decem-
 ber 8 to ]ail General Khanh unless ho pub-
 licly announced support of the Premier.  It
 was rumored, too, that General Khanh wsa
 quietly conferring with Buddhist leaders, pre-
 sumably in hope of capltalizing on a.ny Bud-
 dhist-provoked overthrow of the Huong gov-
 ernment.
 In a radio address niter a meeting with
 Ambassador Taglor, General Khanh accepted
 Lull responsibility for the purge.  Then he
 swung  into  hie  attack  against  the United
 States.   "We make eacriflces for the coun-
 try's independence and the Vietnamese peo-
 ple's liberty, but not to carry out the policy
 of any foreign country," he said.  He defined
 the role of the military as "acting as an in-
 termediary to settle all disputes and differ-
 ences ii they create a situation favorable to
 the  common  enemies:   communism  and
 colonialism in any form:'
 CRITICAL  Or  AMHAaaADOR  TAYLCR
 In             private interviews  with  American re-
 porters, General Khanh case sharply critical
 of Ambassador Taylor.  If he "does not act
 more intelligently, the United States will lose
 southeast Aaia and we will lose our freedom,"
 said General Khanh.   He charged the U.S.
 Envoy had acted '(beyond imagination as far
 as an ambassador is concerned."
 In Washington, the Johnson administra-
 tion replied with a message of support for
 lta  man in Saigon.  "Ambassador Taylor,"
 $aid the State Department, "has been acting
 throughout  with  the full  support  of  the
 U.B. Government; '
 Secretary  Rusk, at  his  news  conference
 the next day, took a more oonaiilstory tone
 toward  the  junior  officeta  and  General
 Khanh.  The  remarks  by  General  Khanh,
 he said, "might have been made in t:ho heat
 of the ru~ament ~  But Mr. Rusk aut,;gested
 that U.S, aid might be curtailed if tits diffi-
 culties in E~~igon continued.
 The late+:~t'11ttI'e-up came just as plaits were
 shaping up for South Vietnamese air strikes
 against  C~'ontmunist  Vietcong  auP131,y  bases
 and infiltration staging areas in Lucca near
 the    Scnt.th   Vietnamese    border.  Gen.
 Phoumi Nctsavan, Deputy Premier of 'Loss,
 visited Sesl~an last week, presumably to put
 the flnie111ng touches on plans to strike at
 the Comxnunlat bases.
 THE FLAMES OF WAa
 These 1>regaarakions were enough to alarm
 the Red Chinese, who threatened to plunge
 Indochina  into  war  if  the  United  States
 bombs  ektpply  lines  through  Laoei.  "The
 flames  o.l 'agar will spread to the whole of
 Indochin[r  1f U.S.  imperialism  succeeds  in
 its  crhnirt.al  scheme,"  warned  the  Peiping
 People's Dttiay.

 thing, it was no longer clear who ao~tttttlly
 held  power'  in  the  country.  U.S.  officials
 were  tlxtstxz~~  whether General  Khanh -had
 again  assumed the role  of strong m.an  or
 whether rte was only acting as the mouth-
 piece of th.a ;lunior officers.  Nor was F'rernier
 Huong's possltlon clear.  Despite strong ges-
 tures of support from Washington, the Pre-
 mier remained in the background, taci'tly', at
 least, giving :his approval to the purge,  'I'ha
 Suddhiata,  too, stayed  quiet,  awaiting the
 military's  next  move.  The  United  Staten
 alone w&a s4a,nding fast publicly against tlha
 purge.  And  the  United  Stag  sudcledly
 seemed to have very few friends in South
 Vietnam.

 emphatically the case in Vietnam in fife years
 of  Ngo  Dinh Diem,  and in  s  considerable
 measure, it is today.
 The rights and wrongs of the young gen-
 erals' renewed  Intervention  in  Vietnamese
 politics cannot be judged from this distance.
 But from any distance, it is perfectly clear
 that these are the men most deeply com-
 mitted to resisting the Communist attack on
 South  Vietnamti  It is also clear that with
 the possible exce~xtlon of Prime Minister Tran
 Van Huong, thep are the most effective per-
 -   sonalltiea on the scene.
 The motives for their renewed Intervention
 may~well have been a great deal more juati-
 flable than one might suppose from a brief
 perusal of the pompous pronouncements of
 the State Department spokesman.  Just be-
 fore  they  acted,  for  example,  there  were
 strong indications that Phan Khac $uu, the
 .. nice, bewildered old gentleman who 1s the
 official chief of state, was about to make a
 dangerously muddled compromise with the
 political Buddhists.
 Moreover, you need only ask any American
 !n Saigon, whether political or military, what
 protectl"on wo have against a neutralist gov-
 the general deterioration in South Vietnam.
 The answer always 1s, "The army leaders will
 not permit at."  In these very possibly clr-
 cumstances, in short, we are actually count-
 ing on the army leaders' intervention.
 Because of American tendency No. 1, how-
 ever, the army leaders are now the targets
 of the State Department's righteous indigna-
 tion.  Aa for tendency No, 2, it is symbolized
 by Phan Khac Suu, the chief of state above
 mentioned.          He has  clean  hands  and  sore
 feet.          And  he  wonderfully  illustrates  the
 usual results of ideal government designing.
 It was a fairly hair raising experience to
 go straight from an audience with this ama-
 able old man, with his white foot bandages
 and obvious  feebleness, to  along meeting
 With one of the ideal government designers.
 "Now," this American kept saying, "we've
 got a government we cari really work with-
 a government with real promise of stability."
 And he went on to talk with pious enthusi-
 asm about the high national council's prontis-
 ing first attempts to prepare a national elec-
 tion !n South Vietnam.
 In reality, it would be flattering to call
 the high national council a basket of eels.
 Aa for the notion of holding a general elec-
 tion in Vietnam at this juneturo or at any
 time  in the 'near future,  this alone  would
 almost excuse  the dissolution  of  the  high
 national council by the young generals.  '
 Working  for  sane  civilian  leadership  by
 men like Prime Minister Huong is one thing.
 Trying to stage a kind of comedy or parody
 of normal, duly elected democratic govern-
 ment in Saigon at this stage of the war, is "
 quite  another  thing.         The  purpose  of  the
 parody is clear, of course.  It looks nice in
 the  papers  back  home,  and  thus  consoles
 -the large element in the U.S. Government
 that  always  worries  about  appearancee.
 The time has come to say, however, "To
 the devil with appearances.  What matters
 is averting a shattering defeat."

 `ON THE SPOT:  VIETNAM  ERRORS  CFFER  VITAL
 LESSON
 (By Marguerite Higgins)
 NEw rSCoaxs.-One way for the United States
 to better its present chances (perhaps 60-60)
 of winning the war !n  Vietnam as to face
 coldly and honestly the consequences of its
 .past mistakes.
 Putting aside matters of America's image,
 :world opinion, and the like, the greatest; and
 possibly disastrous, blunder of the last year
 was the decision to signal the overthrow of
 ,.the Diem regtme?fn .madbattle,  Quite apart
 Ymm, the resulting chaps and. dleorgaatza-
 tion  that  permitted  the  Vietcong  to  take
 over  7  million  (out  of  14  million)  Vlet-
 nameae  in 2 months, the  demoralizing ef-
 fect of the first and second coup d'etats on
 Vietnam's fledgling officer corps has changed
 the very nature of the war.
 The demoralizatiota is such that many Viet-
 namese officers have  Uecome de facto hors
 de combat even though they are nominally
 still at their posts.  'Che morale of many key
 officers has  been  crl.ppled because they  do
 not know whom to trust.  In the wake of the
 successive purgings of the "ins" by the "outs"
 during the two revolts, who can blame these
 officers if they are fearful of taking respon-
 sibility and executing orders.  After all, their
 general or other superior officer may be "!n"
 today "out" tomorrow.  If they do their duty
 today they may be punished tomorrow.
 And  the  United  States  Ss  not  without
 blame for this unceri;aln atmosphere.  If the
 American Embassy in. Saigon had spoken out
 half as forcefully against the reign of terror
 perpetrated. recently  (mainly against Cath-
 olics)  in  Vietnam ae: it did during the so-
 called  Buddhist  cratds,  there  migrit  be  a
 saner atmosphere.  The phony trial of the
 Catholic Mayor Dang Sy, the war hero (seven
 decorations) who wac condemned for having
 carried out orders of lxis Buddhist superiors
 in Hue last May, la but one example of this
 reign of terror.  And if Catholics carry signs'
 saying "Henry Cabot I,cxige Go Home" !t is
 because  they  think the United States has
 stayed strangely sller.[t 1n the face of what
 almost  everybody  on  the  scene  1n  $aigon
 considers  a  mockery  of  jt~atice-only  one
 among many.
 In any case, the morale- of many Vietna-
 mese officers in crucial areas is shot.
 Further, this country is going to have to
 stop trying to fight  this war with its left
 hand.  It is not serious warfare, to give but
 ono example, to send aver military advisers
 for 1 year only.  -The advisers are the first
 to say it.  Said Maj. Ulen O'Connor, of Ari-
 zona: "It takes about 8 to 8 months to get
 to know yottr Vietnamene opposite number
 and work smoothly with him.  And just as
 things are  really  beginning  to mesh,  it is
 time to go home."
 Further, the Commttnasts, who conninced
 themselves  early  in ,1981  that  the  United
 Staten was about to bow out of Asia, must be
 put on notice that this, country will do what-
 ever is necessary to prevent a Communist
 vactorp.  This means, iP necessary, the com-
 mitment of American troops, .sabotage and
 other dirty tricks in Nort]t Vietnam, etc.  The
 Commttnasts  know  that the United States
 has  the  power  to  win  1n  southeast  Aala.
 And if Peking and Hanof are convinced that
 the  United States  is prepared-at last-to
 use it, the invocation of this power may not
 be necessary.

 [From the Washington Star, Jan, 23, 198b]
 ISN'T IT TIME TO FACE TRIITHP
 (By Marguerite Higgins)
 The spectacle in  Saigon  of  brown-robed
 monks egging on delingtxents, both juvenile
 and  adult,  to  smash  fife  windows  of  our
 libraries leads to one insistent question:
 Isn't it  time  the United  States told the
 American people the  truth  concerning the
 way in which a handful of Buddhist poll- ,
 ticians  in  Vietnam. have  used  a  religious
 cover  to  camouflage  a  campaign  of  chaos
 -that for the last 18 months has served only
 Communist ends?
 Is !t embarrassing to admit that the Unit- .
 ed States made a mistake in giving asylum
 at its $aigon embassy no leas than twice (3
 months in 1983, 1 day an 1984) to the in-
 tellectual powerhouse of the rock-throwing
 clique, the Buddhist Monk, 77xich Tri Quang?
 Ie at difficult to acknowledge that perhaps
 we should have checked a little further into
 Quang's.past, hie two arrenta by the French
 for serving with the Comlriunlsts, his state-
 xnents  that  Marxism  and  Buddhism  were
 alike, hie furtive meetings with leaders  of
 the Vietcong National Liberation front?
 W111 laces  turn red ii' we admit further
 that for many months  Quang  bamboozled
 many well-meaning Amrrlcatns into believ-
 ing  his  absurd  claim  that  his  particular
 clique  of  Buddhists  represented  "85  to  90
 percent" of the Vietnamesy people when In
 point of fact Buddhists ix[ Vietnam may just
 possibly constitute 30 perrcnt of the people
 (see "Buddhism in Vietnam" by Dr. Mai Tho
 Tt?uyen, chairman of the 'Uiet.namcae Associ-
 ation  of  Buddhist  Layln.c~n)  and  further,
 Quang's faction is bitterly opposed by truly
 religious Buddhists such Ins those at $aigou's
 ~:a I,o!  Pagoda,  which  is  not  on  speaking
 'terms with the Buddhist neuter run by the
 .Communist-tinged extremists?
 Embarrassing as all this may be, embar-
 rrtssment has become, and resoundingly, the
 lesser of the evils.  The moment of truth fa
 aft hand.
 The truth is vital because otherwise Amer-
 ican opinion is going to fall,  just like that,
 into the trap so cleverly and deviously pre-
 Irau?ed by Quang-the trap of believing that
 tl.[e so-called and in fact nonexistent "Bud-
 dhist  majority"  of  the  Vietnamese  people
 l:i[tve turned agalust the Uxttteai States.
 The truth is, and it needs 'to be repeated
 loud and 'clear, that the man behind the per-
 sona cradling the rocks that smash our li-
 brary Is Quang as well as otxaers who have
 been been intriguing with thr. Vlatcong Com-
 rsuxniats for a very long-time, as the American
 Intelligence record-to its cryciit  shows even
 tlsough the policymakere hsvr? chosen to dls-
 regard the evidence.
 But if and when thy majority of the Anteri-
 cern people begin to believe that utterly false,
 knit so carefully prepared, p1.e:ae of Commu-
 rdat-abetted propaganda to  t'lay  effect that
 1;1ne illusory Buddhist majority wants us to go
 lxome, then the clamor for A[nerl.cans to give
 txp and get out of Vietnam coultl become ir-
 ryveraible.
 d,11 right, so the IInited Sts;tes made a mis-
 ta:ke bank in the summer of 1?133.  We can
 now see, in retrospect, that the Vietnamese
 army,  the  Vietnamese  securF;ty  police,  and
 Vietnamese President Ngo D:Lxth Diem were
 co[xt;pletely right when they tx?1ed to tell us
 freax[  the  very  beginning  of.  the  Buddhist
 crisis that in  Vietnam the 1"o[n:munasts do
 not,  after all, play cricket, 'kitxt play dirty.
 They play real dirty and indufk;y 11t precisely
 srI,st  powerful  Vietnamese  figure  in
 South Vietnam today and that tomorrow he
 may be the moat powerful.
 It is of aigniflcance therefore that General
 Taylor's telegrams on the Buddhist situation
 produced so many somber faces around the
 Department of State.
 For the time being, at any rate, it appears
 according to Ambassador Taylor's assessment
 that the moderates among Vietnam's nearly
 6 milllotn Buddhists (out of a population of
 more titan 14 million of which the majority
 are ancestor worshippers) are being skillfully
 and relentlessly outmaneuvered by the ex-
 tremist wing led by the Reverend Tri Quang,
 whose flamboyant oratory and calls for direct
 action have far more appeal, for example,
 to VIetllam'a aitiSed, riot-prone young people
 than the pleas for caution issued by the Rev-
 erend Talti C1hau.  .
 flop official who had rrnct  General Taylor's   the  etatemont  attributed  to  the       Laotian
 telegrams summed filings up this way:           Buddhists  Association,"'  that  alleged  their

 "A defensible  case can be made for  the
 theory that Tri Quang will sooner or later
 seek to undermino any stable anti-Commu-
 nist  government  in  Vietnam  in  the  belief
 that anarchy will drive the United States to
 go home, permitting the emergence of a neu-
 tralist or possibly pro-Communist state wl'th
 himself at the helm."
 He continued: "Ii Tri Quang wants to de-
 ]iver Vietnam to neutralism or communism
 under hla own leadership, it would explain
 the mystery of why he raised tlxe false issue
 of persecution which is ridiculous in Ilgttt of
 all the concessions-Indeed the favorltism-
 ahovvn  the  Buddhists  by  Khanh's  regime.
 "But the cry of Buddhist persecution-as
 Trl  Quang  well  knows-brings  an  almost
 Pavlovian reaction In the outside world where
 most people are too uninformed and too naive
 to believe that a Buddhist monk might make
 up such accusations out of whole cloth to
 gain his own ends:'
 The issue now seems less and less whether
 the Reverend Trl Quaztg aspires fora neu-
 tralist and pro-Communist  Vietnam under
 his leadership.
 It is focusing more slid more on the fact
 that his actions are painting !n that dhec-

 thing can be dons effectively to stop him as
 he operates from within the privileged psy-

 TO  HEAD  NATIONAL  POLICE
 He currently is slated to be Interior Min-
 ister (l.o., chief of police forces) In the new
 regime at Saigon, having turned revolution-
 tst after being refused the same post 1n the'
 Diem regime,  according  to  reports relayed
 `from Saigon via Washington.
 Today Moscow's radio stations continued
 to denounce the military ]unto  In Saigon
 -Just as they previously had denounced the
 Diem  regime  as an American puppet and
 the United Nations mission to Vietnam as a
 Washington  invention  designed  to protect
 '   and preserve the Diem regime.
 Meanwhile,  it  was  noted  here  that  in
 Burma, homeland of U Thant, United Na-
 tions Secretary General, the military regime
 in control at Rangoon is under attack from
 the  venerable  U  Kaythara,  who,  at  83,  is ,
 the ranking Buddhist  priest at .Mandalay.
 Addressing mass rallies asembled' in deS-
 once of the regime and overtly inviting ar-
 rest, he tae also been predicting that Gen.
 Ne  Win,  the regime's head,  will  meet the
 same end as Gen. Aung Sau, 8urma'e na-
 . tional hero,. who was assassinated in 1947.
 In a statement relayed from Saigon and
 finding mission  that headed  back -to  New
 York yesterday contettded its departure from
 Vietnam was  not occasioned  by  the coup
 d'etat  there,  but  was  "as  scheduled,"  al-
 though in statements prior to the coup the
 mission' had claimed  Inability  to estimate
 when !t would complete its on-the-spot in-
 vestigatton.
 Today's statement also said the mission
 "had not been able to interview Thich Tri
 -   $uang  [a  Buddhist. monk]  who  was  in
 asylum at the U.S. Embassy" in Saigon.  It
 added that "the former government of the
 republic had informed the mission that, ac-
 cording to the laws of asylum, a person !n
 asylum was not allowed to make any con-
 tacts whatsoever While in asylum."
 HIIRMESE  COMPLAINT
 Meanwhile,  there  were  these  additional
 developments at United Nations headquar-
 ters:
 1. James Barrington, Burma's chief dele-
 gate here and its representative in the cur-
 rently recessed disarmament conference at
 Geneva, complained lrr one of the Assembly's
 standing committees about a tendency to-
 ward  "bilateralism"  by  Washington.  and
 Moscow  and  consequent  bypassing  of  the
 lesser powers, including neutralists, in dis-
 armament matters.
 2. Mrs: Agda Rossel, Sweden's chief dele-
 initiate debate On  a resolution-sponsored
 sUso by Austria, Ceylon, Ecuador, Un[guay,
 '-'and Venezuela-that is aimed at getting-all
 governments to follow .the example Liechten-
 stein set in 1798 by abolishing capital ptYil-
 ishment.
 During  the  delivery  of  Mr.  Donna
 speech,
 Mr. DAVITS.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 .     Mr. DODD.  I yield.
 Mr. DAVITS.  I believe that my rec-
 ord on the scoreboard of -the Americans
 for Constitutional. Action is even lower
 than  the  record of  the Senator from
 -Connecticut.
 I share with the Senator from Con-
 necticut the feeling that it only demon-
 . : strates that we are trying fn new ways.
 to have the government use- its powers
 for the people Without at the same time
 .jeopardising  individual  freedom.  We
 can only hope and pray that among the,
 "makers of  these arbitrary scoreboards
 there could be a greater reflection of the
 consensus of our own people in our own
 States.  Then  I  think  the  scoreboard
 would be vc+ry different for the Senator
 from Conncct.lcut and myself.
 Mr. DODD.  I appreciate the Senator's
 making that observation.  Tha Senator
 is one of the great minds in this body.
 He stands out particularly in the area of
 which he has spoken.  I am happy to
 be in his cornpany on that scoreboaxd.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous c[m-
 sent that the colloquy in which I have
 just engaged with the Senator from New
 York be placed at the end of my remarks
 so that I may have my speech in con-
 tinuity.
 The PRESIDING AFFICEIL.  Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. ELLENDER.  Mr. President, am
 I to understand tht~,t the Senator ir[rm
 Connecticut does not wtsh to yield?
 Mr. DODD.  I" am happy to yield.  I
 merely wish that whatever yielding I da
 may appear at the end of my remarks,
 unless there is same reason for it to ala-
 pear elsewhere.
 Mr. ELLENDER.  I have teen Iistexl-
 ing to what the Senator has said with
 much  interest,  because  I  have visited
 southeast Asia on many occasions.  I
 have often described to the Senate-and
 I believe my reports will so indicate--?
 the situation that was prevalent in south-
 east Asia.  I am almost certain that my
 good friend will agree that were he to go
 to South  Vietnarn now, he would find
 things suite different from what they.
 were  when  he  visited  that  country  4
 years ago.
 Mr. DODD.  I am sure that is true.
 Mr. ELLENDER.  There is no doubt
 about that.  On several occasions I made
 the statement on the floor of the Senate
 that unless we could persuade our allies
 to assist us in carrying this load-and I
 am  sure the Senator agrees that that
 ought to be done-and unless a stable
 government could be established in South
 Vietnam, we woul[i be in serious trouble,
 Mr. IIODD.  Ye:t.  I wholly agree with
 those two points.  I refer to a speech I
 made 4 years ago, in which I made the
 same  point.  I said. I  thought it was
 absolutely essential that our friends and
 allies in that part of the world join us in
 the struggle to preserve the freedom of
 the South Vietnamese.  I pointed out-
 and Ishall touch an the issue later to-
 day-that  there  is a basic  structural
 fault in the SEATO organization which
 gives a veto power to any one member;
 and, as the Senator knows, that power
 has been exercised by France and Britain:.
 We must have a st4tble government in
 South Vietnam.  The Senator is a weli-
 informed Member of this body on these.
 .problems.  I have iYreat respect for his
 opinions.
 Mr.  ELLENDER.  The  question"  I
 should  like  to  ask  the  Senator is  as
 follows: Should we s;ontinue to intensify
 our efforts in that area if we cannot get
 our allies to assist us or if a stable gov-
 ernment  is  not  established  in  South
 Vietnam?  That is the question,
 Mr. DODD.  The ~9enator's question is
 part of  a larger question.   There are
 many things we must. do:  Those are two ;
 things that we must do..I believe that
 we must get our friends and allies in
 that part of the world to assist us.  We
 are getting tileln.  Already Korea has
 announced that !t is sending men to that
 area.
 Mr. ELLENIDE~'R.  Two thousand men.
 Mr. DODD.  Two thousand rnen.  The
 Philippines art. sr;,nding in several thou-
 sand men.  All this is encouraging.  They
 are starting, at least.  I would Ilke to
 see other nations do as much or more,
 and I expect t;:xa;t they will.  ][ believe
 we are underw["y, and that this is no
 time to quit, because now we have the
 signs and beginl~ings to indicate that our
 allies are starting to do what the Sen-
 ator from Louisiana and I believe they
 should have done long ago.
 Mr. ELLENDLR..  I am not suggest-
 ing that we quit now.
 Mr. DODD.  I know the Senator is not.
 Mr.  ELLENDER.  We  have  gone  so
 far into it that we na.ay well find ourselves
 in over our heads.
 What Ifear-and I have said so on
 the floor of  the Senate and have in-
 cluded it in my repal?ts-is that the sit-
 uation that now exists in South Vietnam
 may laecome simillr to the one that now
 exists  in  South  Korea.  The  Senator
 will remember that the South Korean
 war was supposed to be a United Nations
 affair, in which a,ll the membership of
 that great organizal;ion was to join us in
 fighting  in  SoutPl  Korea.  But  what
 happened?  We teak hold of the situa-
 tion there;  and as T recall the figures,
 96 percent of the [:cost oP that war was
 paid by the United States, and about
 95 percent of the f[~refgn men who died
 3f1 that conflict we1?c Americans.
 Mr.  DODD.  I  accept  the  Senator's
 statistics.
 Mr. ELLENDER.  "That is as I remem-
 ber them.
 Mr. DODD.  They seem to me to be
 approximately correct.
 Mr. ELLENDER.  "Today we are stuck,
 ns  it  were,  in  South  Korea.  We  are
 trying  to  maintain  1#1  local  divisions
 there.  It is very costly to do that.  In
 addition, we are maintaining 2 oP our
 own divisions there.  As the Senator from .
 Connecticut knows, we cannot :pay the
 expenses of our soldiers there with col-
 lar buttons.  It is necessary to have the
 money and the wherewithal to do .it.
 What I have feare[i all along is that
 lmless  we can  persuade  our  allies  to
 assist us in South Vietlxarn, and unless
 a stable government can be established
 there, a condition ma,y develop which
 will  be worse than tllr, situation that
 confronts us in South Korea.  That is
 what has worried me.
 Mr. DODD.  I know the Senator from
 Louisiana is worried; a,nd so am I.  It
 is  a  proper  problem  to  worry  about.
 There is no question ttlat a stable gov-
 ezzurlent must be establ.shed ir1 South
 ~r.tetnam.
 The  trouble  began,  .in  my  opinion,
 with the assassination o:f Diem.  Diem
 was the best thing we hrtd going for title
 free world in that area, and the tragedy
 ,of. his death still haunts lls.
 I hope that at some time the proper
 cnmmittee  will  conduct a  formal  in-
 qu11y. as to his overthrow a:t1d assassina-
 tion and what part, if arlyr, officials of the
 '[7.t3, Government played in this tragedy.

 Mr. DODD.  If I may interrupt, that

 Mr. DOUGLAS.  I commend the gen- -
 eral elevation of attitude and the pow-
 erful logic of the speech.  This is the.
 most puzzling attic  dangerous problem
 which our country has -faced since Oc-
 tober lOG2.
 I agree with the' Senator from Con-
 necticut that many Americans do not
 suiT'iciently appreciate what the loss of
 South Vietnam would mean to the free
 world and to the anti-Communist forces.
 I am not an exprrt on the subject of
 this territory, but a study of the map in-
 dicates what is involved.  The Senator is
 completely correct in his statement that
 the fall oP South Vietnam, or a with-
 drawal from Soutlt Vietnam, unless con-
 ditions change, would mean the almost
 immediate fall of Cambodia and Laos
 into the Communist camp.  Laos is al-
 ready half there;  Cambodia is perhaps
 half there.
 ..Then, iP Senators will look at a map
 of the area, they will see that Thailand
 would be half encircled.  As the Senator
 from Connecticut itas pointed out, the
 North Vietnamese arinounced a few days
 ago that they were setting up a commit-
 tee for the national liberation for Thai-
 land.  -
 Mr. DODD.  Yes.
 Mr.  DOUGLAS:  With that kind of
 power base, with Nortlt Vietnam push-
 ing, with China behind North Vietnam,
 and wih the United States out of the
 area,  would  not  Communist  influence
 take  over  Thailand  and  then  spread
 north into Burma a,nd south into Ma-
 laysia?
 Mr. DODD.  Most assuredly.
 Mr. DOUGLAS.  Then to the 650 mil-
 lion Chinese would br, added 250 million
 Malays.  What then would be the posi-
 tion of India?
 Mr. DODD.  Then it would be hope-
 less.
 Mr. DOUGLAS.  T '.remember talking
 rnany years ago with an ettiinent Indian,
 who was not pro-Western and not pro-
 Communist, '~ut rather was a neutralist.
 I addressed this question to my Indian
 being attacked now as trot being applic-
 able;but if these were an absence of force
 tit check the Chinese, it would seem to
 nnany of us to be almost inevitable that
 all of Malaysia and virtu~dly all of India
 would go Communist.  We would thou
 face a combination of 350 million In-
 dia,ns, 250 million Malays, and 650 million

 Tf the.Senator from Connecticut would
 permit  me to do so, I should like to
 utxderscot?e some of his remarks on neu-
 tralization, I suppose that iY there could
 be genuine neutralization, that would be
 highly desirable.
 Mr. DODD.  Of course; I should have
 :made that point.  No ono would be hap-
 pier than I if genuine neutralization, as
 the Senator puts it, could be achieved.
 I was talking abut neutralization in the
 sense in which the Communists use it.

 veto and thus stymie. any resolution of
 the U.N.
 As one who has ahvays been a sup-
 porter of .the U.N., and who still is, I
 observe many signs that the United Na-
 tions  is  being  weakened .In  the  same
 fashion  that  the  League  of  Nations
 weakened in the middle and late 1930's.
 I hope that this will not happen.
 Mr. DpDD.  So do I.
 Mr. DOUGLAS.  We should try to pre-
 vent that from happening, but we should
 not ignore reality.                `
 To  those who  say  that there is no
 analogy  betweetx  the  cumulative  con-
 quests  of  Hitler  and Mussollni in the
 late 1930's atxd the cumulative develop-
 ments of  the  Chinese  in Asia in  the
 1960?s, I should say that there is grave
 danger that they delude themselves.  It
 would be a terrible thing if we wake up
 to find all of Asia Communist.
 Mr. DODD.  It would be a dreadful
 disaster.   Earlier I described it as an
 "unthinkable  tlxought,"  borrowing  my
 words from the Senator from Arkansas.
 Mr.  DOUGLAS.  It would have tre-
 mendous propaganda influence in Africa,
 much greater than the Russians alone
 could have, because the Russians, after
 all, are members of the white race.  But
 the members of the. yellow race or the
 brown race can make a much greater
 appeal to the blacks than the wlxite ~na-
 tions can..   .
 The  Senator  from  Connecticut  has
 .performed a real public service in stress-
 ing the dangers.  It should be noted also
 that he cannot be accused of being a war
 hawk.  He does not advocate the indis-
 criminate bombing of North Vietnam or
 a bombing attack on China.
 Mr. DODD.  No.
 Mr. DOUGLAS. He suggests the pos-
 sibflity of guerrilla warfare iu the north,
 which would ]rave to he done by South
 Vietnam,  rather  than.  by  the  United
 States.
 Mr.  DODD.          Only  because  of  what
 North Vietnam is doing to South Viet-
 nam.  This seems to me a proper cor-
 rective measure only so long as North
 .Vietnam  pr_rsists in its activities.
 What we all hope far,"I need not say
 to the Senator, is a settlement of tlxe dif-'
 'ferences between countries, so that they
 can drop their arms and get on wii;h the
 business of improving the lives of their
 people.
 Mr. DOUGLAS.  The Senator proposes
 political warfare and economic aid 'to be
 of real benefit to the people of  Sattth
 Vietnam;  the development of  SEA'.CO;
 and various" other measures.
 I feel certain that the country  will
 appreciate wlxat the Senator from Co.n-
 necticuthas done.  I urge that his wat?n-
 ings and his suggestions should not be
 dismissed summarily.
 I can remember how, in the  1930's,
 after two trips to Europe, I felt that t:he
 combination oP. Hitler and Mussolini urns
 moving to take over 'the free world. . I
 believe that it was the duty of all wlto
 loved fx?eedom to resist that movement.
 There is a similar obligation-upon us to-
 day tb resist totalitarianism of the left,
 as well as totalitarianism of the rig]ht.-
 Mr. DOUGLAS.  Even if it were ap-
 plied to South Vietnam, it would not be
 effective in view of Communist philoso-
 phy and power, unless there were some
 ;adequate supervisory body having real
 authority to police the agreement.
 We  have  all  noticed  press  reports,
 which are authentic, that North Viet-
 nam  has even expelled  the  small  in-
 spection teams which, under the Geneva
 Convention  of  1954,  were  placed both
 in North Vietnam and South Vietnam, to
 see what was taking place and to report.
 'T'hey are being expelled and forced out.
 So there will be no eyes and no voices-
 no eyes to detect and no voices to report
 t;he military preparations and movements
 t>f North Vietnam.
 Mr. DODD.  That is correct,
 Mr.  DOUGLAS.          If  there  were  a
 strong, effective United Nations, with a
 mobile police forre, that force could. be
 placed in tktis area to help fill the power
 vacuum.
 Mr. DODD.  There is no doubt about
 ghat.
 Mr. DOUGLAS,  I was in Egypt and
 Israel in 1956, shot?tly after the Suez hos-
 tilities.  I~, was greatly pleased about the
 e>xcellent work of the United Nations po-
 lice force.  The Senator from Connects-
 cut and I may have differed somewhat
 about the role of a United Nations police
 force in the Congo, but to my mind it
 represented a healthy principle.
 Mr. DODD.  I have no difficulty with
 'the Senator from Illinois on that point.
 I' am sure the Senator would agree that
 +we can make mistakes.  But the prin-
 ciple is correct: A United Nations police
 ? force should be used wherever this is
 feasible.
 Mr. DOUGLAS.  Yes.  Unfortunately,
 as we all know, the Russians and, I am
 sorry to say, the French also, have vir-
 tiually  stymied  the. creation of such a
 force by refusing to contribute to its sup-
 port.
 Mr. DODD.  Yes.
 Mr. DOUGLAS.  So it will be almost
 hnpossible in the Hoar future to finance
 and  to place  a United  Nations police
 -force in the field.
 Another political change is occurring
 inside the U.N:; ?namely, a shift of power
 from the Assembly to the Security Coun-
 c111, where the .Russians can interpose a
 Mr. DODD.  The Senator is correct.
 I am glad that the Senator mt~~de that
 observation.
 Mr. DOUGLAS.  I thank the :>c~nator.'
 Perhalxs crx?tain features of his program,
 such as the proposal to capture a staging
 area lust inside of Laos may not be the
 right thing to do.  But, in general, the
 pragl'alYx SitggE5ted is modest, maiierate,
 and in good temper.  I hope his program
 will be cozLSidered by the American peo-
 ple and that it may serve to offset same
 of the :finely motivated but inco.~nplete
 suggestions that have been made.
 Mr. DODD.  I am deeply grate:ftri for
 the observations of the Senator:
 Mr. DOMINICE~.  Mr, President; will
 the Sentx.tar yield?
 Mr. DGl)D.  I yield.
 Mr.  L~OMINICK.   Mr,  Presidr..nt,  I
 congratulate the distinguished Setxat;or
 from  Camtecticut  on  making  what  I
 think is a valuable contribution to the
 national debate on what we should do
 in southeast Asia.
 I not only had an opportunity to :read
 the statetent before it  was delivered,
 but I_ also had the pleasut?e of listetxing
 to the delivery.  There are several paints
 that the Senator made which I think
 were publicly made for the first time.
 The one that T should like to emphasize
 at  this  palm  concerns  some  of  tlxe
 strategic iml>licatians, gained by looking
 at a map, of what might happen if the
 'Red Chinese decide to move south.
 The implication is rather plain th.ta,t
 the Senator .does not think they will do
 that.  I agree.  Among the things tlxa.t
 would deter -them from doing that is the
 presence in 'T'aiwan of a highly trainer]
 air force.  The Nationalist Chinese very
 much want to So back to the mainland
 if they have a,n opporttucity.  If the Red
 Chinese forces >hrere to lie drawn to the '
 south, that would give them the chance
 to move, which chance they might not
 have again.
 The Senator presented figures on what
 the  Vietcong has done in the way  of
 murder and terror within the country,
 The  Senator  said  that  almost  500  a
 month, or 6,000 a year, within the village
 hamlets have been murdered by the Viet-
 cong:
 Mr. DODD.  The Senator is correct.
 Mr. DOMINIC7K.  I wonder if the Sen-
 ator can tell me where the figures origi-
 note.
 Mr. DODD.  I hope the Senator will
 be satisfied with my statement.  I am
 sure they are f.t?om an official source of
 the administration..
 Mr. DOMINICIf.  The reason I asked
 Ys that figures have been given to me
 which are of a very substantial nature,
 but not quite that large.  When I have
 mentioned the flt?ttt?es from time to time,
 in the process o:f meeting with groups
 and talking about; the terrorism that has
 been inflicted, people had not heard of
 this before.  They had never understood
 what was going an,  They had no con-
 cept of the problem..
 Mr. DODD.  I c1a Hat know whether
 the Senator was izx tlxe Chamber before,
 but when I obtained the figures, I said,
 "Why in the world have the figures not
 been made public 2'"  I -think the figures

 shocald have been made public.  I do not
 see much sense in classifying this mate-
 rial and concealing it.  The people do
 not know these facts.
 Mr.  DOMINICK.  It  is  particularly
 important with respect to the. arguement
 made by those who would like to see us
 negotiate  and  neutralize.  The  South
 Vietnamese villages are not with us.  But
 !t is very difficult to have them cooperate
 with us if they are under the grip of
 "terrorism and  many  people  in  their
 areas  are  being  murdered.  Until  we
 give them the security they need, it is
 harts for them to be able to do anything.
 Mr. DODD.  The Senator is correct.
 M:r. DOMINICK.  Mr. President, one
 of the things that has not been made
 plain in the overall debate, I feel, is the
 fact that there is a contest of willpower
 in this area.  There is no doubt . in my
 mind, from the study that I have made
 of~ the overall situation, that the Com-
 murrists are using the so-called national
 liberalization plan as a test mechanism
 ? to determine how great the willpower
 of tlhe free world is.  If this plan should
 'be .successful in persuading us to nego-
 tiate, or'neutralize, it fs inevitable that
 this   technique      will   spread     widely
 throughout the world, through Africa,
 ,South America,  and Latin America.
 It, is already being used.  But I be-
 lieve it will be accelerated sharply.  I
 think the Senator brought that point
 out very well.  I congratulate him on
 making a very useful contribution.
 Nfr. DODD.  I thank the Senator.
 N[r. MUNDT.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 N[r. DODD.  I yield.
 N[r. MUNDT.  I congratulate the dis-
 tin@;uished  Senator  from  Connecticut
 for having presented a most conclusive
 and  comprehensive  statement  on this
 whole  Vietnamese  problem.  It  is the
 typo of white paper which I hoped the
 State Department would have placed be-
 forea the American people long ago.
 `  I believe it would still be well for them
 to clo so.  In his analysis of the historic
 developanerits of the problems and the
 consequences involved in this important
 theater of the world, the Senator leaves
 littlle doubt as to his accuracy.
 While men may disagree among them-
 selves as to the various processes to be
 used to bring this matter to a successful
 culmination, the matters that the Sena-
 for has anticipated are the type  that
 should emanate frown the State Depart-
 ment, carrying the full weight of the ad-
 ministration and the Government.  I am
 sure  that  would  convince .many  fine
 Atraerican citizens, who are beginning to
 doubt  their  own  judgments  ire  these
 areas, >ts to what is involved.
 I: congratulate the Senator-on a most
 corprehensive study.  I am happy to
 noise the emphasis and the importance.
 which the Senator places on a step-up
 political warfare in this area.
 '.Che distinguished Senator from Con-
 nerticut has long tried to establish a
 .training institution in .this country so
 then we could prepare Americans to eo
 overseas for the type of warfare we wish
 to ;pursue, with a. stablp,.constituted gov-
 er7nment in Vietnam.
 I hope  that  the  State Department,
 which has shown such a stubborn re-
 luctance to  provide the type training
 required for this type of warfare, will
 consider carefully the emphasis that the
 Senator places on this particular recom-
 mendation for future activity.
 The  Senator  talks  about  cadres  of
 trained political leaders and emissaries
 from these countries who are equipped
 and capable so that they could deliver
 the type  of  guidance  and  inspiration
 needed by our friends in South Vietnam.
 Unfortunately, this is always debated in
 a vacuum in our? ability to wage a cold
 war.
 I happen to be one of those who be-
 lieve honestly that had the other body
 approved in 1960 what the Senate then
 did approve, legislation for the creation
 of a freedom academy-following a won-
 derful report written in large part by
 the Senator from Connecticut, e,s a mem-
 ber of the Committee on the Judiciary,
 emphasizing the need for this adjunct
 to our contest against the Cotnrnunists
 overseas-we  would  have  had  5  long
 years within which not only to train our-
 , selves, but also to provide for young gov-
 ernmental officials and career people in
 the government in Saigon to come here
 and learn the full truth about the tech-
 niques and devices employed by the Com-
 munists.  These officials and career peo-
 ple would have learned to understand
 the maneuvers and manipulations of the
 Communist conspiracy, and been trained
 to be better able to convince their fel-
 low citizens on the free side of t:.e Viet-
 namese struggle of the dividends which
 accrue to freedom, and the importance
 of Communists.
 There would not have been the nrelan-
 cholic succession of quick changes in the
 officialdom   of   South   Vietnaru.  We
 would  have   obtained  what  all  ltands
 agree is an indispensable requirement in
 bringing success to our efforts tlzere-
 the creation of a stable government in
 South Vietnam which has not orily the
 will to win, but also the respect of the
 local peaple, so that it in turn would sup-
 port the Government and maintain its
 stabilfty in office, so that the people there
 could get on with the work to be done..
 Mr.  DODD.  The  Senator  gives  me
 credit for the idea of the Freedom Acad-
 emy.  It vaas the idea oP the .Senator
 from  South Dakota.  I  was .merely  a
 minor  help  in getting it through .the
 Senate.  The Senatar from South Da-
 kota deserves great credit for it.
 Mr. TOW1~1Z.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. DODD.  I yield to  the  Senator
 from Texas.
 Mr. TOWlt'.Pti.  I join my distinguished
 colleagues from South Dakota anci Colo-
 rado in commending the able anil distin-
 guished Senator from C'onncctfcut for
 his  comprehensive contribution to the
 dialog on southeast Asia.  It must be
 made clear to the American people that
 we must take stringent action ire sotitlr-
 east Asia iP we are to deter and discotar-
 age further aggressive adventures by the
 Communists.  Again I thank the Sen-
 stor from Connecticut very much.
 Mr. DAVITS,  Mr, president, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. Dc?DD.  I yield to the Setrs3tor
 from New 'York.
 Mr. DAVITS.  The speech of then Sen-
 ator from Connecticut is altogether too
 provocative and he has done his lraxaa.e-
 work altogether too well for him to be
 complimented merely or. a good job.  It
 is a good job, however, and I should lflte
 to join my colleagues from Texas, t_~otrth
 Dakota, a,ncl other States who have said
 so.  Any bane the Senator devote.; :h~ian-
 self to tlxis kind of work, it helps the
 country.
 The  Senator  from  Connecticut  lt.as
 done a thorough job_in presenting ni':w
 ideas.  Thfs is the place for them, .f car
 we are not inhibited by the admini:,tra-
 tion  or  its policies,  especially whin  a
 Democrat puts forth a good idea.
 One lack, as I have said before, is tftat
 retaliation lies been pictured as a policy.
 It is not a policy.  It is a reaction.  We
 support it.  We close ranks behind the
 President.  We have common interests irr
 it and in the losses.  The losses breal.
 our hearts, but we try to do sametlting
 about them.  fIowever, it is not a policy.
 The Senatar from Connecticut is try-
 ing to work out a policy.  Whether it be
 a  good  or  a  bad  policy,  he  is  right
 in trying to work it out, because he pro-
 poses something positive, which takes us
 on a road where there is a big lack.  That
 is what  is  causing doubts  among the
 people as to whether this country is goltrg
 to pull out of South Vietnam or go fa:r-
 ward.
 Granting a,11 that I have said, I shottld
 like to ask t'he Senator some questions.
 In the first place, the Senator does rrot
 deal with something that troubles many
 of us, and that is the question, "Is there
 still a majority in South Vietnam who do
 not want communism?  Do a majority
 of the people want to fight against it?",
 We cannot fight a war without soldiers:
 That statement goes whether the fight i:r
 for an ideology or for freedom.  That is
 one question we must always determine.
 We cannot put our head on other peo-
 ple's  shoulders  and  assume  they  ar, the
 is a refined form of democracy.  How- Mr.  DODD.  That  is  not  what  is                   President would do it.

 There is another kind of freedom, and         of view,                                    trouble.  All you have to do is to retire

 Mr. LAUSCHE.  In addition, to that,
 a new agreement 'was made in 1962, in
 Laos.
 Mr. DODD.  Yes.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  There we followed the
 policy of negotiation..
 Mr. DODD.  Yes. _._I believe it was iri
 1ss1.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  May I ask whether
 the Laotian agreement worked out as it
 was anticipated it wonild work out by the
 sponsors of it?
 Mr. DODD.  Not at all.  It could not
 havA worked out worse than it did.  For
 the people of  Laos and the people of
 southeast Asia and for us it has been a
 complete farce.  It .has been repeatedly  '
 violated, and it is being violated every  ~
 day.  It is another case of our inability` i
 to trust those people.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  I commend the Sen-
 ator from Connecticut; for his presenta-
 tion, because I believe what he has said
 and what others have said on this point
 will bring home  to  the minds  of  the
 American people that what is involved
 is not merely wanting to be in southeast
 Asia, but that our national security is
 involved.  In my ludg.ment, words to the
 contrary, are not at this time helpful to
 the achievement of the common ob~ec-
 tive that we seek to achieve.
 Mr. DODD.  I am grateful to the Sen-
 ator for his compliment, which Y do not
 deserve, but which I enloy.

 Mr. D(~DD.  That is very true.  I do
 not offer these analogies because I tY~ink
 think they are exact parallels.  The ~4en-
 ator understands that, I am sure.  There
 are  always  some  differences.  I know
 that.  However, we learn from what hap-
 pened in the past, certainly from what
 happened in the near past, and we study
 these happenings in order to learn from
 them.   If  others  made  mistakes,  we
 should try to learn how to avoid repeat-

 and in that way a terrible war was
 brought on.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  It has been suggested
 that we negotiate  the  future political
 status of South  Vietnam.         What does'
 ' that mean?  Does it mean that we should.
 negotiate a now type of government for'
 South Vietnam?
 Mr. DODD.  I do not know.  I do not'
 believe that the Senator from New Yorke.
 meant it that way.  As I understood him,`;
 he made a good point.  I am sure the:
 Senator from Ohio shares my feeling one
 that point.  As I understood the Senator;
 from New York, we do not want to doh
 anything that will give the impression
 that we are for unconditional surrender
 and, on the other hand, we do not want
 to give the impression that we will have

 ing them.  I drew these ,analogies for
 that purpose.  There are other examples
 in history-these are not the only ones-
 but the ones that I drew  on are the
 latest and perhaps the most pertinent.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  There was the Ver-
 sailles Treaty and the League of Nations
 covenants,  the  Kellogg-Briand  Treaty,
 and the Lucarno Treaty.  All oP them
 contained provisions which were vioL~ted
 by the Japanese as early as 1922.
 Mr. DODD.  Yes.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  By Hitler begimiing
 about 1932, and by Mussolini at the same
 time.  In instance after instance it was
 thought that  if  we would  give in.,  it
 would be the end of it.
 Mr. DODD.  That is true.  I referred
 to Nuremberg and what we discovered
 there.  One of the thinks we learned was
 that at the time Hitler ordered his troops
 to occupy the Rhineland, he had given
 instructions that 3f  they met any op-
 position at all they should immediately
 retreat.  How easy it would have been
 for us to stop him cold then.  There was
 considerable? dissatisfaction -with Hitler,
 in his own military circles, and, as we
 know, there was an attempt made later
 to get rid of him.
 We failed in that situation to take the
 appropriate steps.  Our failure enabled
 That is all that the Senator Prom New
 York meant, I am sure.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  There is now in exist-'
 ante a pact by which we have abided ands
 by which the South Vietnamese have
 abided, but which the North Vietnamese
 have violated.
