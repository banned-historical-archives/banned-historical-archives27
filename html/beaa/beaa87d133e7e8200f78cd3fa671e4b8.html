 Martial Law Restrictions
 The government is sending mixed signals regarding
 an easing of martial law restrictions.   Since late last
 week it has allowed International Red Cross representa-
 tives to visit and talk privately with some internees
 and has permitted the reopening of foreign libraries and
 cultural centers sponsored by Western governments.   A US
 to diplomat traveling in southern Poland, however, recently
 was stopped four times by police and,once was held at
 gunpoint while his car was searched.
 Comment:   The regime is trying to give the impres-
 sion, particularly for the benefit of some West Europeans,
 that it is easing restrictions significantly.   Neverthe-
 less, the diplomat's experience indicates continuing
 insecurity by the government and suggests that it may
 /I  be tightening controls in some areas.
 Reactions to Jaruzelski's Speech
 TASS yesterday quoted Jaruzelski's address to the
 parliament at length,  including his carefully hedged
 suggestion that martial law might be lifted at the end
 of February.   The Soviets paid particular attention to
 the Premier's criticism of Western "interference" and
 sanctions and took note of his veiled threat that Poland
 would withdraw from the CSCE review session in Madrid if
 it encounters criticism there.

 Comment:   The TASS commentary indicates that the
 Soviets approve the tone of Jaruzelski's remarks.   It
 nonetheless may be significant that TASS the same day
 carried excerpts from an interview with Politburo member
 2 Olszowski, voicing hardline sentiments.   The interview
 could be intended as a signal to Jaruzelski that if he
 fails to pursue satisfactory policies, there are others
 waiting in the wings who would be more willing to do
 so.
 Meat Exports
 The government reportedly has resumed exports of
 meat products from at least one plant as a result of
 increased pork production and procurement.
 Comment:   Warsaw suspended meat exports last month
 in an effort to increase domestic supplies.   The resump-
 tion of the exports--if it becomes widely known--will
 cause considerable resentment among Polish consumers who
 face reduced meat rations in January and February and a
 22-percent reduction in meat supplies this year.
 27 January 1982
 Lebanese Foreign Minister Butrus's visit to Damascus Zast
 weekend and the earlier cancellation of a scheduled meeting of the
 Arab Conciliation Committee on Lebanon suggest that Syria is aban-
 doning the joint Arab effort to promote a reconciliation in Lebanon
 and is returning to bilateral negotiations to protect its interests.
 Butrus's trip followed a visit to Beirut earlier
 last week by Syrian Foreign Minister Khaddam.   The re-
 newed contacts between Syrian and Lebanese officials
 3 come at a time when Syria's talks with the Christian
 Phalange Party, its main rival in Lebanon, reportedly
 also have been expanded.
 3
 Lebanese authorities maintain that the renewed
 emphasis on contacts with the Syrians is intended to
 supplement rather than replace the efforts of the Con-
 ciliation Committee.   Damascus, however, has already
 indicated that it will not allow the Committee to be a
 conduit for progress on reconciliation until after the
 Lebanese presidential election this summer.
 The Syrians have long viewed the Committee as a
 stalking horse for a Saudi-Phalange-US plan to reduce
 their influence in Lebanon before the election.   Since
 last September, they have used their Lebanese Muslim
 allies to stall the Committee's efforts.
 Comment:   Syria's interest in expanded talks with
 both the Lebanese Government and the Phalange suggests
 that Damascus,    like the Phalange,  is trying to preserve
 maximum maneuvering room during the election campaign.
 Earlier this week, Phalange party chief Pierre Jumayyil
 / offered to turn responsibility for security in Phalange-
 controlled East Beirut over to the government.   Although
 2  little is likely to come of this offer, the Phalange
 will use it as a gesture of good faith toward Lebanese
 Muslims.

 France reached agreement with the USSR on the price of gas
 from the Siberian pipeline in part with an eye to negotiations with
 Algiers on an aid and liquefied natural gas pricing package.
 French and Algerian officials resumed talks last
 Comment:   Paris appears to have decided to conclude
 the gas agreement partly because it was convinced that
 the Soviets had made their best offer and because it was
 ?/persuaded of the need to sec
 factor in the Algerian deal.
 Mitterrand believes France's own economic performance
 is tied to Third World economic progress and sees a
 special role for France as a privileged interlocutor of
 the Third World.   The Third World is the area in which
 French export performance has shown the most improvement
 lately, and Algeria is the largest consumer of French
 products among less developed countries.

 The Soviets apparently are probing the              oscow's . -;.rope an proposal that border negotiations be resumed.
 A Western press service reported on Monday that
 Chinese officials have held "secret talks" in Beijing
 over the past 10 days with Sergei Tikhvinskiy--a deputy
 chairman of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Society--about
 a resumption of the border talks, which were last held
 in the Chinese capital in June 1978.   Although there
 is no solid evidence that such preliminary discussions
 have begun,  a Chinese official has confirmed Tikhvinskiy's
 presence in Beijing on an "unofficial visit."
 that Tikhvinskiy probably would meet with
 Foreign Ministry officials but insisted that the Chinese
 would not discuss political issues with him.   Other
 Chinese officials have held off on setting a date for
 ,'\ the talks and have predicted in conversations with in-
 terested third parties that if new talks are held,  they
 moral A  be  nn  more
 rorlnr, ti ve   i-han   the
 revious ones
 p
 p
 Comment:   Tikhvinskiy,          formerly deputy chief of
 the Soviet team at the border talks,                 almost certainly has
 been seeking clarification on what the Chinese meant in
 their diplomatic note on 26 December, when they agreed
 "in principle" to a resumption of the talks but insisted
 on "serious preparations" before beginning them.
 The Soviets have been spreading rumors in Beijing
 that bilateral relations are improving.   At the same
 time,  Soviet media have avoided commenting on relations,
 while continuing to criticize Chinese behavior in Asia
 and Beijing's failure to respond more forcefully to the
 US stand on the Taiwan issue.
 Both sides have good reason to hint that some sort
 of preliminary talks have been held in Beijing.   Moscow
 may have hoped to put pressure on the US on the eve of
 the meetings between Foreign Minister Gromyko and
 Secretary of State Haig.   Beijing may be signaling its
 unhappiness over US arms sales to Taiwan.

 ITALY-USSR:   Reply to Moscow
 The firm, but measured rejoinder yesterday by Italian Communist
 leaders to Moscow's denunciation over the weekend of the Italian
 Party confirms that relations between the two parties have reached
 a new Zow.
 The Italian Party insists that Moscow's attack
 represents a return to tactics of the Stalinist era.   The
 party also reasserts its longstanding argument that each
 Communist party has a right to develop and pursue its
 own brand of "socialism" and suggests that Moscow could
 profit from the Italian Party's attempts to reconcile
 "socialism" and democracy.
 Comment:   Although it may be some time before it
 becomes clear whether current polemics will lead to a
 formal break, the size of the Italian Party and the
 stature of its leaders mean that the dispute could be-
 come a watershed in relations between Moscow and the
 more independent West European Communist parties.
 The new low in party-to-party relations could have
 similarly important implications for domestic politics.
 Party Chief Berlinguer probably saw the Soviet attack
 as an opportunity to enhance his party's democratic
 credentials with the broader Italian electorate at a
 time of growing concern that still another government
 crisis may arise in the spring.
 Most Italian commentators have acknowledged that
 the Communist Party position in the dispute with Moscow
 represents an important turning point in its political
 development, but they caution that the party has to
 evolve further to become an acceptable governing partner.
 It is clear that the party's dispute with Moscow will
 provide new ammunition to those Italian politicians who
 believe it is in their interest to "take another look
 at the Communist question."   These developments could
 convince Socialist Party leader Craxi, whose ambitions
 to become Prime Minister are tempting him to precipitate
 a government crisis,  to forge ahead out of fear of being
 eclipsed by a more acceptable Communist party.

 CHINA:   Deng Out of Public View
 Deng Xiaoping has thus far not made a publicly
 announced appearance during the lunar new year holiday.
 China's media have accounted for all other top leaders
 in the first two days                               appeared
 of the holiday.   Dena in public     1 January
 Comment:   In the past year, Deng has altered the
 pattern of his appearances with the leadership.   He has
 always appeared in public on important occasions, however,
 presumably to forestall speculation about his political
 or physical health.  Although Deng was attended by a
 nurse at the National People's Congress in December, he

 Third Vice President and Minister of State Security
 Tayyib will soon be appointed First Vice President, one
 of the posts from which Abdel Majid Khalil was dismissed
 on Monday.   Nimeiri has assumed Khalil's role as Army
 Chief and Defense Minister.   A number of other officers
 believed to be supporters of Khalil also are being
 purged.
 if they will challenge his action.
 Comment:   Tayyib has little support in the Army,
 and his appointment as the regime's number-two figure
 probably will not be well received by most senior
 officers.   Nimeiri's dismissal of Khalil caught the
 President's critics by surprise, and it is still unclear

 VENEZUELA-CUBA:   Oil Swap Continued
 Venezuela has agreed to continue supplying Cuba
 with 4 million barrels of oil this year under a quadri-
 lateral swap arrangement with the USSR.  Moscow will pay
 $4.85 per barrel above the OPEC market price for the oil
 and in return will supply an equal amount of oil to
 Venezuela's West European customers.   The arrangement
 originated in 1975 under the administration of former
 President Perez and has been maintained on an ad hoc
 basis since 1980.   It coincides with separate discussions
 between representatives of Mexico's state oil company
 and Soviet officials on a longstanding proposal for an
 oil swap that also would involve Cuba.
 V
 Comment:   The amount of oil involved is negligible
 in terms of Venezuela's total exports and represents only
 about 5 percent of Cuba's oil demand.   Venezuelan state
 oil company officials have periodically criticized the
 swap as offering little commercial benefit to Caracas,
 but political leaders emphasize that the contract gives
 Venezuela some leverage with the Castro regime and helps
 to improve strained bilateral relations.

 Retail price hikes, apparently scheduled for
 implementation on Monday, include some steep increases
 on a wide variety of consumer goods.   The increases will
 average about 50 percent.   Concurrent increases in wages,
 pensions, and family allowances will partially offset
 the impact of the price hikes.
 Comment:   These are the first significant price
 hikes on consumer goods since July 1979 and will at a
 /   minimum contribute to the continued stagnation of living
 v standards.   The regime, however, evidently realizes that
 it cannot afford to cater to consumer interests in the
 face of mounting economic pressures.   It probably will
 be able to contain any popular discontent over the in-
 creases.
 A majority of 167 of the 301 first-round electoral
 college ballots went to Prime Minister Koivisto yesterday,
 making him the country's first Social Democratic President.
 ot both the popular election and the electoral college
 decision may make it easier for him to resist possible
 future attempts by the Soviets to push Finland away from
 its self-declared policy of neutrality.

 POLAND:   Reviewing Martial Law
 Six weeks after the imposition of martial law, Premier
 JaruzeZski faces numerous problems that threaten his current firm
 3              hold on power.  The situation in the country is inherently unstable
 as intraparty strife continues, Solidarity activists try to organize
 resistance, the economy slides, and the popular mood sours
 Archbishop Glemp recently has expressed apprehen-
 sion that current trends will lead to popular unrest and
 violence.   A close adviser to Jaruzelski has publicly
 admitted that the economy is deteriorating, blaming West-
 ern sanctions, and fears spontaneous protests against
 v planned price hikes.   The Soviets made their gloomiest
 public assessment yet on the Polish situation in a recent
 article in Pravda.
 Trouble Spots
 Jaruzelski's failure on Monday to chart a comprehen-
 sive program that goes beyond the current emphasis on
 "control" suggests that moderates and hardliners are
 / still jockeying for primacy in the leadership.   Partly
 as a consequence,  local party organizations are in dis-
 array.   Although Jaruzelski's control over the martial
 law mechanism provides him an important political lever,
 a continued impasse in the leadership will undermine his
 authority.
 Solidarity activists still at large are disseminating
 underground leaflets and trying to create a clandestine
 structure.   Organizational work, however,  continues to be
 seriously hampered by the internment or arrest of more

 The Church is increasing its pressure on the govern-

 popular unrest.   Poland's bishops last week issued a

 The economy is the key variable, and production con-
 tinues to decline because of lingering passive resistance
 among workers, bad weather,  and raw material shortages
 aggravated by Western sanctions.   Delay in formulating
 policy may only deepen the economic slide.
 The regime's policy of using threats and blandish-
 ments to induce private farmers to step up deliveries
 has had mixed results.   Reduced meat rations this month
 are only being met with stopgap Soviet shipments.   The
 2   government intends to proceed with massive price hikes
 J   in early February but has increased the partially off-
 setting wage hikes in the hope of heading off manifesta-
 tions of worker resentment.
 Looking Ahead
 Concerns about control probably will prompt the
 government to keep basic martial law restrictions in
 effect beyond spring, despite Jaruzelski's ambiguous
 promise in his speech on Monday to ease restrictions by
 the end of February.   Although many of the participating
 Polish military units have resumed normal training, the
 civilian police remain primarily responsible for main-
 taining order.
 The popular mood has soured now that the initial
 shock of martial law has worn off.   This increases the
 1          likelihood of strikes or other forms of unrest in the
 near future.   The regime, however, will use whatever
 force is necessary to suppress resistance.
 This may be a viable strategy for the short term,
 but it carries the risk of touching off larger scale
 3          unrest that will be more difficult to control.   It also
 delays further the political accommodation that must be
 reached if the economy is to recover.

 policy shifts.
 The death of Mikhail SusZov, the senior member in terms of
 tenure on the Soviet Politburo and the Party Secretariat, will en-
 hance President Brezhnev's authority but will not produce sudden
 influence until his death.
 Suslov ranked second in protocol in the Party
 Secretariat--behind Brezhnev--and third on the Polit-
 buro--behind Brezhnev and Premier Tikhonov.  He served
 as the guardian of ideological purity and of leadership
 collectivity, working to prevent the establishment of
 personal dictatorships under both Khrushchev and Brezh-
 nev.   Suslov's personal power waned as that of Brezhnev
 increased.   Many younger party leaders may have considered
 his ideas outmoded, but he commanded respect and wielded
 has hurt the political position of Andrey Kirilenko,
 long thought to be a potential successor to Brezhnev.
 Since former Premier Kosygin's death in 1980, Suslov
 was the only independent voice on the Politburo other
 than Brezhnev, who now will have a freer hand in person-
 nel appointments.   The political prospects of Konstantin
 Chernenko, a longtime Brezhnev crony who was promoted
 7/ rapidly to top party posts in the late 1970s, probably
 have brightened.   The official announcement of the arrange-
 ments for Suslov's funeral suggests that his departure
 Suslov's death removes a strong force for stability
 during the succession that will occur when Brezhnev
 dies or retires.   He would not have aspired to the top
 post himself, but he would have been a power broker, act-
 ing to limit the influence of the new party chief while
 promoting the leadership's common interest in maintaining
 unity during an uncertain time.
 27 January 198-2
 Impact on Policy
 Suslov's doctrinaire perspective and extraordinary
 concern for the maintenance of domestic security led him
 to oppose economic reform and "populist" programs at
 home.   He apparently argued against greater investment
 in the consumer sector, which Brezhnev and Chernenko
 have promoted, and wider use of wage incentives to spur
 productivity.   Suslov's departure itself will not mean
 any quick change, but it removes an obstacle to the
 possible adoption over time of more flexible domestic
 policies.
 It is doubtful that Suslov's death will have a
 noticeable effect on Moscow's policy toward the West, of
 which Brezhnev has long been the chief architect.   His
 absence may be felt, however,  in areas where Suslov took
 a particular interest, notably Soviet relations with
 Communist parties abroad.
 One of the most outspoken critics of liberalization
 /   in Poland, Suslov argued for a firmer hand in dealings
 with Solidarity.   The recent Soviet decision to confront
 i
 i
 i
 s bless
 the Italian Party probably was made w
 th h
 ng,
 and his departure could bring greater Soviet moderation
 in disputes with West European Communist parties.
 Suslov was suspicious of "national liberation"
 movements that seemed ideologically impure or too inde-
 pendent of Moscow's control, and therefore he sometimes
 appeared less enthusiastic than others in supporting
 the Palestinians.   He was more willing, however, to con-
 front "imperialism" in the Third World and seemed to be
 in the forefront of those uraina Soviet intervention in
 Angola in the mid-1970s.
 Possible Political Shifts
 The funeral will provide an opportunity to observe
 the new lineup of Soviet leaders for clues of possible
 shifts in political standing.   Brezhnev has been absent
 from public view for more than a month, presumably be-
 cause he is on vacation.   Protocol requires his presence
 at the funeral, however, and his failure to attend would
 suggest that he is seriously ill.
