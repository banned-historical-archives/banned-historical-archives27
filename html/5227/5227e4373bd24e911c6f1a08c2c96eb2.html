 CHINA INCORPORATES TIBET
 In 1792 Tibet acknowledged the suzerainty of the Manchu
 Emperors who had invaded the country early in the century.
 Under this domination the Tibetans attained an autonomous
 status.   The Chinese Empire was able to maintain only a nominal
 loose control over Tibet and when the Manchus were overthrown
 in 1911, Tibet expelled the Chinese troops and representatives.
 Between then and 1950 the Chinese government did not attempt
 to exercise control over Tibet, although several attempts were
 made to incorporate it into China as were the eastern sections
 and border lands in 1928.
 Thus, even in modern history, the Chinese hold over Tibet
 has always been a very loose one and Tibet's right to.autonomy
 over its internal affairs has been recorded.and recognized
 in a number of international documents.
 The situation was succinctly stated by Pandit Nehru, speak-
 ing in Madras on 14 April 1959.  He said:  "We accepted the
 Chinese overlordship of Tibet and we stand by it.   But the
 Tibetans are not Chinese and I cannot imagine any feasible
 or practical or happy solution without the autonomy of the
 Tibetan people."
 A degree of autonomy was recognized by China in 1931
 when the original constitution of the self-proclaimed Chinese
 Soviet Republic recognized for national minorities the "right
 to complete separation from China."  Tibet was mentioned as
 being among those who should "enjoy the full, right to self-
 determination; i.e. they may either join the Union of Chinese
 Soviets or secede from it and form their own State as they may
 prefer."  Thus the leaders of Communist China officially pro-
 claimed that the status of Tibet should be determined by that
 country itself.
 But this was swiftly to be changed.   In 1950, Chinese
 Communist troops invaded Tibet who appealed in vain to the
 United Nations.  After unsuccessful resistance against over-
 whelming force, the Tibetans had no recourse but to send a
 delegation to Peking to negotiate the terms of its official
 relationship to the Chinese Communist regime.
 This resulted in a 17-point Agreement which was signed
 on 23 May 1951 and acknowledged by the Dalai Lama on 24 October
 1951.   The main points were as follows;

 "The Central People's Government shall have the

 area of Tibet."
 Suzerainty, Not Sovereignty
 The 1951 Sino-Tibetan Agreement clearly reserved authority
 over internal affairs to the local Tibet government and dele-
 gated control over external affairs to the Central Government.
 The relationship was one of suze ainty, but not of sovereignty.
 The existing political syst m in all its aspects, the
 religious beliefs, customs and h bits of the Tibetan people
 and the monasteries and their in ome were all fully guaranteed
 and compulsory reforms in Tibet  ere explicitly  rejected.
 The Agreement stated that the local government should carry

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02771 R000300440003-5
 out its own reforms in accordance with "actual conditions in
 Tibet."
 This was reinforced through the signing of the Sino-Indian
 Agreement on Tibet in April 1954.   The famed Panch Shila, or
 the five principles of international cooperation, formed the
 preamble of this document.   These five principles, which also
 provided the basis, for the Bandung Principles, proclaimed by
 the Afro-Asian Conference in Bandung, Indonesia, in April 1955
 and subscribed to by the Chinese Communist Government, read
 as follows:
 1.   Mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.
 2.   Mutual non-aggression.
 3.   Mutual non-interference in internal affairs.
 4.   Equality and mutual benefit.
 5.   Peaceful coexistence.
 Premier Nehru thus recognized Chinese suzerainty, but not
 sovereignty, over.Tibet.   It is clear that the Panch Shila
 and the Bandung Principles, plus other international documents
 recognizing the freedom of countries from interference in their
 internal affairs included Tibet.
 If any doubt existed as to the legal status of Tibet as
 proclaimed by the Chinese it was dispelled by their reiteration
 of Tibet's autonomy.   For example, Chou En-lai confirmed the
 independence of Tibet in its internal affairs when he talked
 to Nehru in India in 1956.   These assurances.were recalled by
 Nehru in a speech he gave before the Indian Parliament in the
 late spring of 1959.
 He declared:
 "When Premier Chou En-lai came here two or three
 years ago, he was good enough to discuss Tibet with me
 at considerable length.   He told me that while Tibet had
 long been a part of the Chinese State, they did not con-
 sider Tibet as a province of China.
 "Therefore, they considered Tibet as an autonomous
 region which would enjoy autonomy.  He told me further
 that it was absurd for anyone to Imagine that China was
 going to force Communism on Tibet."

 The Preparatory Committee f :r the Tibetan Autonomous
 Region will have the nature of atate organ, charged
 with the responsibility of making preparations to establish
 the Tibet Autonomous Region and will be directly under
 the State Council.   Its major task is to prepare for
 regional autonomy in Tibet, as provided in the Constitu-
 tion and the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Libera-
 tion of Tibet and according to the concrete conditions
 of Tibet."
 The actual power of the PCART rested in the hands of the
 following representatives of the Central Government, although
 there were many other Chinese officials on the Committee:
 General Chang Kuo-hua, Commander of, the Communist Tibet Military
 District; Lieutenant General Tan Kuan-san, deputy secretary
 of the Party's Tibet Work Committee; Major General Fan Ming,
 deputy political commissar of the Communist army in Tibet and
 deputy secretary of the Party's Tibet Work Committee; and
 Chang Ching-wu, Central Government official representative in
 Tibet and secretary of the Tibet Work Committee..  It was he who
 arranged for the establishment of the Preparatory Committee in
 1956.  When Chang Ching-wu is absent, his functions are assumed
 by Chang Kuo-hua.
 While the structure of Tibet's local government was being
 revised at the highest levels, the Communists were taking over
 functions that directly affected the daily life of the people.
 The Liberation Committee of the Chamdo.Area, for example, formed
 local and regional organs and issued orders affecting Lhasa,
 voided all debts "incurred as a result of former levees,.""
 abolished the ""feudal service system" of the former government
 and established trading companies and schools.
 It is interesting to note that the Central Government
 maintains that the Chamdo Area is not in Tibet although the
 region is inhabited by Tibetans and was once definitely part
 of Tibet, and despite the fact that the.Central Government
 itself included representatives from the People's Liberation
 Committee of the Chamdo Area in the PCART.
 While the Communists were establishing the additional
 government units to,usurp some of the legitimate functions of
 the local government headed by the Dalai Lama in Lhasa, officials
 of the Tibet government were being dismissed by the Central
 Government.  The two premiers, Lukhang and Lobsang Tashi were
 dismissed; the Cabinet was forced to dissolve its Foreign
 Affairs Bureau; and in 1953 the Indian press reported that
 all non-Chinese advisers to the Dalai Lama had been dismissed.
 The foregoing presents clear evidence of.the shift in local
 government authority in terms of the governmental structure.

 On the question of actual control over the internal affairs
 of Tibet, testimony is available from the highest authority.
 The Dalai Lama, after years of ',silence, interspersed only
 with cautious statements, issued a statement in Tezpur on
 18 April 1959, following his escape from the Communist army.
 In it, he clearly stated that: j
 "...after the occupation of Tibet by the Chinese
 armies, the Tibetan Govern ent did not enjoy any measure
 of autonomy, even in inter al matters, and the Chinese
 Government exercised full Powers in Tibetan affairs.
 "In 1956 a preparator  committee was set up for
 Tibet with the Dalai Lama is chairman and the Panchen
 Lama as vice chairman and General Chang Kuo-hua as the
 representative of the Chin se Government.
 "In practice even thi  body had little power and
 decisions in all important matters were taken by the
 Chinese authorities.
 The Dalai Lama and h I s Government tried their best
 to adhere to the 17-point  greement, but interference
 of the Chinese authorities persisted."
 The frantic efforts of the
 dence contained in this stateme

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02771 R000300440003-5
 of Tibet and their leading public figures consider it
 practicable.   It has now been decided not to proceed
 with democratic reform in Tibet during the period of the
 second Five Year Plan (1958-1962) and we can only decide
 whether it will be done in the period of the third Five
 Year Plan in the light of the situation obtaining at
 that time."
 Economic and social reforms had been invoked in several
 areas of Inner Tibet and various preparations for reforms had
 been made in Tibet proper.   Mao's statement to the Tibetans
 was a clear ultimatum--the Central Government would decide
 when the reforms would be imposed and it would decide. their
 nature.  He was, however, quite firm on the point that the
 reforms would have to be carried out sooner or later.
 Mao made a further clarification in the same speech by
 saying that "democratic reforms and socialist transformation
 have, in. general, been completed in most of the national min-
 orit                     areas."  These minority areas had also been promised that
 t ere would be no interference with their. traditional pattern
 of life or with their basic social structure and culture.
 Mao's "contradictions" speech was not the first indication
 that all was not going well in Tibet.   Chang Kuo-hua had announced
 in September 1956 that there would be an alteration in the time-
 table for Tibet.  He said that "democratic reforms" would not
 be effected for "a comparatively long period to come" as they
 had to await the acceptance of a majority of Tibetans.
 The intention to put the Communist program into at least
 partial reverse was given more practical attention by Chang
 Kuo-hua when he said on 22 April 1957:
 ""...organs set up in the past by the various locali-
 ties in preparation for carrying out these democratic
 reforms must ...be properly reorganized.   An appropriate
 number of the work personnel of Han     inese7 nationality
 who came to help prepare for democra is reforms in Tibet
 must also be transferred to other areas of the fatherland
 to. take part in socialist construction."'
 The degree to which the postponement of the reforms was
 to be honored was thrown into further doubt by Chang's admoni-
 tion to Tibetans and Chinese to be ?kconstantly on guard against
 the subversive activities of imperialist elements and the
 rebellious activities of separatists against the fatherland."

 record indicates that'the Communists bombed monasteries, killed
 monks or impressed them into labor brigades, killed women,
 indiscriminately shot civilian males and forcibly deported
 Tibetan adults as conscript labor while shipping Tibetan youths
 to China for "re-education."
 These acts display the intention to destroy all Tibetans
 who oppose the Communist effort.   The opposition appears to
 include the vast majority of the people of Tibet.   In view of
 this, there is no doubt that the Chinese Communists can be
 adjudged guilty of the international crime of genocide.  As
 the world knows, from the beginning of the Chinese occupation
 of Tibet in 1950, the Tibetans have fiercely resisted the occu-
 pation power despite the Sino-Tibetan 17-point Agreement which
 promised administrative autonomy to the country.
 Tibetan resistance to Communist China was sparked by the
 Communists' coordinated political and military policy aimed
 at the communization of Tibet.  A large Communist army, probably
 of some 100,000 men, established garrisons near. major towns
 and along the borders.  Airfields and strategic roads linking
 Tibet with China were built by gangs of Tibetans who had been
 forced into labor.   In his interview with the press in India
 in April 19.59, the Dalai Lama made specific reference to the
 Tibetan "martyrs" who had died working on these projects.
 Most of the measures taken t  communize the country violated
 the 1951 Agreement.  Despite the failure of the Communists to
 register any success with their program of transforming Tibet
 into a Communist society, Tibetans came to the realization that
 the Communist regime threatened their religious institutions
 and their traditions.
 Monks in Forced Labor
 During 1957, the Communists continued their efforts at
 collectivization, resorting'to forced labor and campaigns to
 destroy religious institutions and to undermine religious leaders.
 During this time the Khamba rebels continued their guerrilla
 resistance.
 After anti-Communist demonstrations in Lhasa on 10 March,
 armed revolt broke out in the city on 19 March.   The uprising
 of the lay people and monks was suppressed by the Communists
 who are reported to have bombed several important monasteries
 and destroyed valuable manuscripts and relics.
 Before the full-scale Tibetan uprising in March  the esti-
 mate of the number of Tibetan refugees in India was 8,000.   By
 the end of May this number had increased to 21,000.  Refugees

 reported that the Communists h nted down refugees fleeing to
 India, killing and wounding a treat number of them.
 Various items of information regarding killings, imprison-
 ment, deportations and acts of destruction were reported for
 the first three months of 1959 before the main uprising.   Guer-
 rilla leaders reported that eight monasteries were deliberately
 destroyed by bombing.   The eldest brother of the Dalai Lama,
 Thubten J. Norbu, interviewed  t the University of Washington
 on 24 March, accused the Chine e Communists of having machine-
 gunned thousands of men, women and children; of destroying
 monasteries with populations of up to 5,000; and of slaughtering
 the monks.
 As of 4 April, according to a Tibetan wool merchant now
 a refugee in India, Chinese regression in the Kham Province was
 ruthless.  Monasteries which frmer.ly had 1,000 lamas were
 reduced to populations of 100.   The others were either executed
 or drafted into forced labor o   collective farms.   After the
 revolt in Lhasa, even Khambas who cooperated with the Communists
 were executed simply because they were Khambas.
 Most of the information regarding the suppression of
 resistance in Tibet was obtained from the border towns of
 Darjeeling and Kalimpong.   These reports revealed that the
 Communists shelled many important buildings in Lhasa such as
 the Dalai Lama's summer palace, the offices of the Tibetan
 Cabinet, the medical college, the Jokhang cathedral and the
 Sera and Drepung monasteries.   The entire population of Sera
 and Drepung were reportedly taken into custody for "'screening.
 The number of Tibetan dead in Lhasa was placed at 2,000
 as of 27 March.  By the end of that; month the Communist army
 had sealed off the Indian frontier to prevent the escape of
 Tibetan refugees and guerrillas.   Reports at this time also
 stated that the Communists were shipping Tibetans from Lhasa
 out of the country in military trucks.   Similar deportations
 were reported in progress at G ;antse and Shigatse.
 Information dated 4 April  oted the indiscriminate shooting
 of the Khambas.  Lamas reaching Mismari, India, from Dekaung
 on 14 May stated they had seen Communist machinegun and bombing
 attacks in the Lhikh area, two days' march southeast of Lhasa.
 They reported that thousands were attempting to flee Tibet
 because of the increase in Communist persecution and indoctrina-
 tion.

 As. of 22 May estimates of the number of Tibetans killed in
 Lhasa  anged from 5,000 to 10,000 out of a population of some
 70,000.  About 5,000-10,000 ablebodied men were deportedi'some
 to work on the railroad from Siningfu to Lhasa.   It is estimated
 that a total of 200,000 Tibetans had been killed by the Chinese
 Communists in recent years of fighting.
 On the basis of the foregoing examples of ruthless acts
 by the Communist regime against the Tibetan population over a
 period of some eight years, the conclusion is inescapable that
 there was every intention of using violence in order to imple-
 ment the communization of Tibet.
 It is equally inescapable that all these killings, arrests
 and deportations can only be equated to an outright charge of
 genocide.   This has been done by the International Commission
 of Jurists in Geneva which on 5 June reported that Chinese
 Communist acts in Tibet over the past nine years constituted
 the "crime of genocide" in an attempt to destroy the Tibetan
 people.  A report by this organization representing 35,000
 lawyers from 53 nations said that since 1950 the Chinese
 Communists had killed more than 65,000 Tibetans who had opposed
 them.
 The Commission of Jurists said it would "initiate such
 action as envisaged by the Genocide Convention of 1948 and by
 the Charter of the United Nations for suppression of these
 acts..."
 The Commission's report was-prepared by Shri Purshottam
 Trikamdas, senior advocate of the Indian Supreme Court and
 former secretary to Mohandas Gandhi.   Trikamdas said the report,
 a preliminary one, was based on two months of study of 'documents
 And'interviews with Tibetan refugeeo in India.
 The report also accused the Chinese of over-running Tibet
 with 500,000 Chinese immigrants with another four million to
 come.
 Control over Education
 A concerted effort is being made in Tibet to subvert the
 youth of the country through the establishment of a series of
 schools where they will be indoctrinated in Communism.
 In April 1957 Peking announced that some 70 primary schools
 with accommodation for 6,000 students had been established in
 various localities in Tibet.
 The intent of the program was indicated in the Lhasa news-
 paper Tibet Jih Pao which said on August 2 1957:
