 MEMORANDUM FOR:  See Distribution
 National Intelligence Officer for Warning
 SUBJECT       :  Coping with Diplomatic and Military Surprise
 1.  The attached memorandum has some interesting perspectives
 on coping with diplomatic surprises and sudden military initiatives.
 Although most of the points are oriented toward a specific warning
 function the paper is relevant to the duties of most analysts deal-
 ing with political and military problems.
 2.  The author also does some contingent forecasting by
 describing six situations where circumstances are converging in
 a way that creates a potential for shock diplomacy or sudden military
 initiatives.
 --  Israel - Egypt
 --  China - US - Taiwan
 --  West Germany - NATO Missiles
 --  South Africa - Namibia - Angola
 --  Poland

 Memorandum for:   NIO for Warning
 25X1        From
 February 4, 1982
 Subject           Preparing  the Warning  System to                Cope with  Surprise
 1.   The DCI's  renewed mandate to define  the warning mission broadly
 in terms of avoiding  surprise  to US  decision-makers         requires new and
 more   imaginative analytical methods  and  processes.   The               fundamental
 requirement  for avoiding surprise  is  to  strengthen the warning
 community's  ability  to detect or sense when a  target  government's
 policy  is  ripe  for a significant break with,   or departure  from,
 existing positions and  lines of action.
 2. Most  foreign policies  are based on a high degree    of  continuity,
 inertia,  routine,  and  incremental decision-making.   Political  leaders
 everywhere usually prefer to  cling to  the  "security" of  familiar and
 well-tested  policies rather  than gamble  on leaps  into  the unknown.
 As  a result,  most  actions  taken by  governments  fall within fairly
 narrow limits   and are  thus  reasonably predictable.  Governments  resort
 to major  departures  or  faits accomplis, which often produce   surprise,
 only infrequently,   and usually under the pressures of a combination of
 dometic and international forces and incentives.   Surprise diplomacy
 generally  seeks  to  employ  secrecy,  surprise,  and  shock to  achieve its
 objectives.
 3.   The central task of warning is to monitor both the target
 government's  domestic   and  international  situations and  (even more
 importantly)  its perceptions  of  these    situations  in order to be  in a
 position to   detect or sense when a breakpoint     if imminent.      Even if
 this kind  of detailed   and  exhaustive monitoring enables  the warning
 community  to judge  that  circumstances         exist  that may trigger surprise
 actions,   most warning forecasts necessarily must be  cast   in contingent
 terms  or in a context  of  changes  in a situation that have created a
 potential  for  shock diplomacy or  sudden military initiatives.   The
 intrinsic difficulties  and ambiguities  of warning  intelligence will
 always preclude  clear and    confident  predictions.     Contingent  fore-
 casting             is  the most            that warning can strive  for,  and the demands   of
 this process  are daunting enough.
 4.  Historically, two  of  the most common sources of  policy break-
 points             and surprise have been            (a)  actual or  impending failures  of
 a given line of policy,  a bluff that has been called, or a power play
 that has backfired;     and (b)  changes  in the prevailing balance of
 power--either domestic or  international.
 5.  The current warning agenda offers  four examples   (actual or
 potential) of the first category:        the impending failure of Prime
 Minister Begin's strategy since Sadat's visit to Jerusalem to trade an

 China - U.S.  -   Taiwan
 1. The Chinese leaders  are  facing their most  consequential
 decisions  in relations with the U.S.  since President Nixon's visit  in
 1972.   Their bold attempt  to pressure the Reagan Administration into
 terminating arms  sales  to Taiwan has failed,  and  they now find  themselves
 locked into a position in which  they must   either retreat  or bring this
 sensitive  issue  to a head.  Both options  carry high political  risks  for
 Deng Xiaoping and  his  supporters,  and  the Taiwan dilemma probably has
 intensified  divisions  in the leadership.
 2. A retreat would seem to be excluded because  this  course would
 require  a politically costly admission that    China had been caught  in a
 bluff.     Although some Politburo members  apparently have urged    that
 China demand  an immediate and  explicit   suspension of the Administration's
 decision to  continue arms  sales  to Taiwan,  Peking apparently has
 decided  to  concentrate on extracting a deadline  for  ending U.S.  arms
 sales.     China's  official news  agency contended on 31 January  that a
 time  limit would   "safeguard"  China's  sovereignty over the  island while
 giving  "due  consideration"  to U.S.  interests.  The Chinese may be
 willing to   acquiesce  in a continuation of  limited U.S.  arms  sales  for
 a short  period   (perhaps  one  to three years), but  only on condition that
 the U.S.   accepts the  "principle"  that  the  sales are  incompatible with
 China's  sovereignty and with the December       1978  agreement to establish
 full diplomatic relations.
 3. While pondering their next  steps.     the  Chinese are trying  to
 convey subtle signals  to  the U.S.  that   they retain the option of
 improving relations with   the  Soviet Union  if  the Administration declines
 to negotiate  on Taiwan.   The Chinese on January  25  confirmed   that  they
 have held  "unofficial"  talks with Sergei  Tikvinskiy,  deputy      chairman of
 the  Soviet-Chinese Friendship   Society,  about    a resumption of  the
 stalled border negotiations,    last held  in Peking in June  1978.      Tik-
 vinskiy,  formerly deputy  chief  of  the Soviet                       delegation at the border
 talks,  is said  to be seeking clarification of  Peking's    diplomatic note
 of December  26 which agreed in "principle"  to  resume     the border  talks.
 4. If further  soundings convince    the Chinese  that the U.S. will
 not  agree to  place  limits  on the duration and quantities of arms  sales,
 Peking will  either have  to make  good  on  its  threat  to downgrade  diplo-
 matic relations  from the ambassadorial                      to the charge'level, with  the
 knowledge  that Washington promptly would match  this move,  or accept  the
 consequences of a serious loss of prestige and credibility.   The Chinese
 leaders pride themselves on making good on explicit warnings--the
 intervention in the Korean War,    the border war with India,  and  the
 "lesson" administered to Vietnam in 1979.    In view of this record and
 the probable domestic political repercussions of a backdown,  the Chinese
 probably will act to reduce diplomatic relations with the U.S.      in the
 next  three to  six months.
 5.   A downgrading of  diplomatic  relations,,  accompanied by a
 cooling in Sino-U.S.  economic ties, would represent a potentially

 South Africa - Namibia - Angola
 1.  South Africa's  decision to play the  "Cuban card"  in the contest
 over Namibia  strongly  suggests  that Prime Minister Botha's  government
 has  sharply downgraded  its  assessment of  the chances  for an acceptable
 agreement on Namibia and  that  it may now move within the next  six
 months  toward a unilateral declaration of Namibian  independence under
 the  control  of Pretoria's  client Democratic  Turnhalle Alliance.   On
 January  5,  the acting commander   of South African forces  in Namibia
 announced   that his forces had  clashed with Cuban troops   for the first
 time  in nearly  seven years.   He  claimed  the Cubans had interfered with
 South African and Namibian troops  engaged  in a  "follow-up  operation"
 against  SWAPO  insurgents  in the  "operational area straddling  the
 (Namibia-Angola)  border."           The Angolan Defense Ministry promptly
 challenged  this  claim and asserted that    South African forces had
 attacked  Cuban and Angolan units  190 miles north of  the border deep
 in  the interior  of Angola.
 2. The significance of South Africa's  claim resides  in the  fact
 that    it  is now contending that the clash with the  Cubans  confirms  that
 Soviet-directed Cuban forces  are  taking over  the  Namibian insurgency
 from SWAPO  guerrillas,  thus  "internationalizing"  the  conflict.  South
 African media have  linked  the  incident  to the negotiations  on a Namibian
 settlement and  emphasized  that  the South African public will  not  support
 a settlement unless  Cuban troops  are withdrawn from Angola.    The    South
 African government has   long made it   clear  that  th?re can be no real
 progress  on Nam   bia unless  the U.S.  delivers  a satisfactory Cuban
 withdrawal  from Angola.
 3. South Africa's decision to play  the  "Cuban"  card  at this  time
 almost  certainly reflects  an intention to    stall   the negotiations  and
 blame any breakdown on the  Cubans  and   Soviets  and  on the U.S.'  failure
 to  secure  the departure of  Cuban forces.   The timing of  Botha's decision
 probably was  influenced by his perception of    the significance of     the
 Reagan Administration's    decision to hold high   level talks  in the  State
 Department with UNITA leader Jonas  Savimbi    in late December,  and    the
 Department's  announcment  that,  "'This Administration has  stated      that  the
 U.S.  considers UNITA to be    a legitimate political force  in Angola which
 must be taken into account."
 4.   Botha appears  to have interpreted  this  statement  as meaning
 that  the Administration now endorses South Africa's view that  the
 Namibian problem cannot be settled  in    isolation from a broader
 regional   settlement,  i.e.,  a Cuban withdrawal  from Angola and an internal
 political  settlement  in Angola  itself. If  South Africa now intends  to
 make a Namibian agreement  conditional  on an   Angolan settlement)  this
 will obviously  stalemate indefinitely          the  efforts of  the  five-power
 Western "contact   group"  to  implement the U','N. Security Council's
 resolution calling  for  independence  for  Namibia in 1982.   It will also
 open the way  to a  South African unilateral declaration of    independence
 for Namibia,  probably before  the end of  the year.   This  outcome would
 precipitate an expansion of  the conflict   in southern Africa and  confront
 the U.S.  with an array of problems    that would far overshadow the  stakes
 in  the  immediate Namibian problem.

 Category B:   Changes  in the  domestic balance of power
 Poland
 1.  Developments in the past  two weeks  reinforce  the  impression
 that   sharp differences within  the military and  party  leadership  are
 paralyzing the Military Council's    ability  to make major political and
 economic decisions.    The regime  is also displaying  great  anxiety over
 public reaction to  the massive price  increases   that took effect on
 February 1.
 2.   The most  striking evidence of  the regime's inability to make
 tough decisions was General  Jaruzelski's  failure in his  speech  to
 parliament  on 25  January  to lay out  the kind  of  comprehensive program
 that had been promised in late December.      The speech itself was delayed
 for  three weeks,  almost  certainly because  of  irreconcilable differences
 in  the  leadership.   On the  crucial issue of  the  future of  Solidarity,
 Jaruzelski acknowledged    that proposals  on trade unions remain  to be
 worked out.   In  contrast  to his  forthright  statement  in his  Christmas Eve
 address  that  "there  is room for  self-managing and  really  independent
 trade unions" and for "workers'     self-management," Jaruzelski on 25 January
 could  say only  that he himself  saw a need  for a   self-governing union as
 a  "counterweight  to  the bureaucracy"  and  that  there was  support  for  the
 "idea"  of unity among all  trade unions.     He  said nothing about workers'
 self-management.   The hardline Army newspaper on 20 January had bluntly
 ruled out workers'    self-management and union participation in  the
 selection of enterprise managers.
 3. Jaruzelski's vague    formulations  on  the  future of  Solidarity
 were dictated by disagreements between  "moderates" who  favor preservation
 of  a  Solidarity purged of  "antisocialists,"    restricted to non-political
 issues  such as wages  and working  conditions,   and  reduced  to  a constituent
 member of  a party-controlled national   trade union  federation,  on the one
 hand,  and hardliners who demand  the complete     elimination of   Solidarity,
 on  the other.     Jaruzelski himself probably favors  the moderates'
 prescription,  but he   found  it necessary  in his  25 January speech  to
 avoid  repeating his  earlier  assurances that he has no  intention of
 returning to  the  state of            affairs before  the Gdansk Accords  of August  1980.
 4. The sole  issue  on which Jaruzelski was  able  to express a
 reasonably  clear position--his  pledge  to            ease  some martial law restrictions
 by  the  end of February  "if  no illegal actions develop"--was prompted by
 two  considerations:   (a)  the military regime's desire to  give West
 European  governments  a rationale  for  resisting U.S.  pressure to  impose
 economic  and  political  sanctions; and (b)  concern that  an indefinite
 extension of   full martial   law would  gravely compromise  the Army's  reputa-
 tion in the public mind  and jeopardize  its reliability as                    the only
 effective  instrument  for  ensuring public  order and       guiding economic
 recovery through  the  system of military  commissars        in industry, mines

 of Jaruzelski's ability to keep the lid on open resistance and lay the
 foundations for gradual   economic and political recovery.   Public
 reaction to  the price  increases will be  the  first  significant  test.
 Jaruzelski is counting on his pledge to lift or reduce some martial law
 restrictions by  the  end of February  to buy him crucial  time both at. home
 and abroad in influencing decisions by the Western powers.   He clearly
 hopes  to  counter President Reagan's warning   that  "we're not going to
 wait  forever  for  improvement" by  encouraging the kind of West   European
 interests and sentiments represented by Foreign Minister Genscher's
 statement  on 6 January  that,  "Together with our Western partners,  we  are
 prepared to  grant  financial  aid  in large measure  to  a Poland that returns
 to  the path of reform and  renewal."
 6.   If Jaruzelski is unable to make good on his martial law pledge,
 if he        fails to  reduce  leadership differences  that are paralyzing major
 decision-making,  and  if  the kind of street violence  that occurred in
 Gdansk on  30 January  spreads,  Jaruzelski's   position will become much
 more precarious,  the hardliners will  strengthen     their  influence and
 emerge more  openly,  and  Jaruzelski's days  in power probably will be
 numbered.
 Category B:     Shifts in  the  International Power Balance
 Iran -  Iraq
 1.   A major breakpoint  in  the  conflict  is becoming  increasingly
 likely  in the next  three months.     President  Saddam Hussein's    search  for
 a way to end    his losing war reflects a growing fear of mutinies in
 Iraq's  demoralized army,  especially  if  the  Iranians  carry  the fighting
 into   Iraqi  territory.   Faced with  the prospect of  further military
 setbacks    and rising dangers  of a      threat to his  leadership, Saddar- may
 unleash his  superior air  force against   Iran's remaining oil  facilities.
 Such attacks would  draw Iranian  counterstrikes         against Iraq's  three oil
 pipelines  to ports   in Turkey, Syria and  Lebanon.    Mutual military
 escalation might bring Gulf     shipping  to a halt      and virtually remove
 the oil production of  Iraq,    Iran and possibly some of  the smaller Gulf
 states  from the world market.
 2. If  the Khomeini regime interprets  Saddam Hussein's  peace  feelers
 as  a   sign of  growing weakness  and vulnerability,  it  is  likely  to attempt
 to  intensify Iranian military operations  in an attempt   to bring him down.
 Iran will  therefore  resist  any outside diplomatic  intervention  to
 arrange a ceasefire and  Iraqi withdrawal  from Iranian territory.
 3.   King Hussein's theatrical announcement on 28  January     that Jordan
 will    send volunteer troops to   assist  Iraq and  that he will join this
 force probably was prompted by his  concern that  the overthrow of  Saddam
 Hussein and     a humiliating Iraqi defeat would  greatly enhance  Syria's
 position in the Arab world and expose Jordan to harsher Syrian pressures.
 King Hussein, moreover, probably hopes that his gesture will induce the

 Saudis  to  increase  their  financial support  to Iraq  and perhaps
 prevail on the U.S.  and Western Europe  to  intervene    to arrange a
 ceasefire as  the only way  to avert an Iraqi defeat and a dangerous
 expansion of  Iranian power  in  the Gulf.
 4.          The Administration may  soon receive urgent  appeals  from
 Jordan,  Saudi Arabia and perhaps  Egypt for prompt diplomatic  inter-
 vention to deny  Iran and  Syria what would be potentially highly
 destabilizing changes  in the Gulf and Arab balance of power.

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER FOR WARNING
 SUBJECT:  Southeast Asian Potential for Crisis
 Vietnam's offensive in western Kampuchea has again created conditions
 for a potentially much more serious crisis involving Thailand and China,
 and ultimately even the US.  Indiscriminate Vietnamese violations of the
 Thai border to strike at the support infrastructure of, or to envelop,
 Kampuchean resistance forces could lead to clashes with Thai units
 stationed in the border zone.  Vietnamese battalion-level units have
 already operated up to 5 km inside Thailand, but so far have avoided
 engaging Thai units.  On the other hand the danger of escalation is
 increased by Thai apparent willingness to join the fray, evidently in
 support of Kampuchean allies.  Thai counterbattery artillery fire and
 aerial reconnaissance have already occurred.  One small Thai unit reportedly
 made an incursion into Kampuchea.  Should Thai troops get into serious
 trouble, or just in the way, Bangkok is likely to appeal for support to
 So far the Chinese have been conspicuous by their silence about Vietnam's
 latest predations in Kampuchea.  The, Chinese have yet to even mention the
 Vietnamese offensive in propaganda.  A slight increase in skirmishing and
 shelling across the Sino-Vietnamese border has occurred, as part of the
 annual rites inaugurating the lunar new year. -Chinese mention in press of
 civilian casualties inflicted by the Vietnamese portends some      iation,
 but nothing relates this to the fighting in Kampuchea.
 The Chinese usually do not retaliate immediately along the Sino-
 Vietnamese border for Vietnamese operations in Kampuchea.  It is likely
 that they are watching the performance of the Kampuchean clients in the
 face of the Vietnamese onslaught as well as judging the gravity of the
 latest Vietnamese threat.  The offensive has been underway since at least
 late November, with its most intense phase beginning three weeks ago.  But
 so far it has not even been mentioned by the Chinese, in public or in private.
 Chinese deliberations about a response are probably complicated by
 internal conditions and the presence in Indochina of a Soviet military
 delegation led by Chief of the General Staff Marshal Ogarkov.  Ogarkov's
 visit raises a strong inference of complicity in the offensive beyond
 the provision of required military support, and flaunts Soviet and Vietnamese

 solidarity.     The danger to Chinese allies in Southeast Asia plus Vietnamese
 and Soviet hauteur place heavy pressure on China to make some riposte to
 signal its interests, if not protect its equities.  One explanation for the
 alleged presence of Deng Xiaoping in South China is to plan with local
 commanders the nature and timing of a Chinese military response against
 The linkages make the situation almost unpredictable with a large
 potential for a chain reaction.  A serious clash in Thailand could occur
 at any time without warning.  The amount and quality of warning available
 in the event the Sino-Vietnamese border heats up hinges on the Chinese
 response.  Low level demonstrations of force could begin at any time
 without warning.  A buildup on the scale of the 1979 border war, which
 does not yet seem likely, would be detected several weeks at a minimum
 before major hostilities.
