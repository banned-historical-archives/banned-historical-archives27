The Senate may soon be moving- to break the long-
standing shadowy alliance between big American cor-
porations and the Central Intelligence Agency and 
other United States government organs for carrying 
out covert interventions in the domestic political af-
fairs of foPeign countries. As an outcome of hearings 
held last March by a special Senate subcommittee on 
the joint involvement of the White louse, the CIA, the 
-State Department and the International Telephone and 
Telegraph Company in secret efforts to block the 1970 
election of Chile's Socialist President Salvador Allende 
Gossens, a bill is being introduced this week to declare 
such alliances illegal and punishable by imprisonment 
and fines. 
That US corporations have cooperated. in varying 
degrees in the past with the CIA and foreign opposi-
tion groups to stage revolutions and coups dYtat or to 
interfere in local elections has been widely suspected 
for nearly 20 years though it could never be precisely 
documented. Thus the United Fruit Company was be-
lieved to have worked hand in hand with the CIA in 
organizing the 1954 "rebel" invasion of Guatemala 
(wl here the .company had important holdings) to oust 
the leftist President- jacobo Arbenz Guzman. The com-
pany's Boston headquarters, as I still vividly recall, 
was at the time an excellent source for newsmen in fol-
lowing almost on an hourly basis the progress of the 
. . 
invasion. ? 
In 1964 a number of US compani?es operating in 
Brazil were thought to have secretly contributed funds 
?with the CIA's knowledg,e ? to the Brazilian?Insti-
tute for Democratic Action (IBAD), a civilian rightist 
group that played an important role in triggering the 
military revolution against President jo,5o Goulart, a 
highly incompetent and corrupt leftist. Later that same 
year the ITI provided funds (as did the US govern-
ment) to campaign against Allende in his first but un-
successful bid for Chile's presidency. 
But the first time that Ibis kind of activity could fully 
be documented and made part of official record was 
the March hearings. (by the subcomniittee on multi-
national corporations of the Senate Conunitteeon 
Foreign Relations) op, and Chile. A lengthy sub-
committee report, issued this. week, describes in 
detail the contacts between the Nixon administration 
and FIT during 1(1:(l aimed firstq defeating Allende 
and., later, at keepi 
TAT 
.the Chilean parliament. 
The central points in the report le swum tesinuoily 
that ITT offered the CIA $1 million in 1970 for anti-
Allende operations, that while the agency rejected the 
offer it subsequently suggested to the ITT its own plan 
for creating economic chaos in Chile, and that action 
against Allende was- studied at least twice by the 
White.liouse. 
The- report is the basis for legislation designed to 
outlaw such private alliances between the US govern-
ment and American corporations which is being intro-
duced by Senators Church, Symington, Muskie, Case 
and Percy. The wording of the bill leaves no doubt 
what the subcommittee had in mind after discovering 
the ITT's $1 million offer to the CIA. It thus provides 
that "it is unlawful Thr any citizen or resident of the 
United .States to offer to make, or to make, a contribu-
tion to 'any agency of the United States or officer, em-
ployee, or agent of the United States for the purpose of 
influenting the outcome of an election for public office 
iii,another country." Another section declares it to be 
"unlawful for any officer, employee, or agent of the 
United States 1) to solicit an citizen or resident of the 
United States to contribute to, or make an expenditure 
in support of, any candidate or political party, directly 
or indirectly, for ,the purpose of influencing the out-
come of an election for public office in a foreign coun-
try, or 2) to. accept a contribution from any citizen or 
resident, of the United States for such purpose." 
The attempts to involve the White I-louse and 
the CIA in the attempts to intervene in Chilean politics 
have been generally known since jack Anderson, the 
syndicated columnist, published early in 1972. internal 
UT documents bearing on the proposed anti-Allende 
conspiracy. Until the subcommittee investigation, 
however, the assumption was that 11T was the "ag-
.gressive' party and the administration remained 
passive, virtually ignoring the company's entreaties. 
hat emerges from the subcommittee':t report and 
other information from sources close to the investiga-
tion is that the Nixon :idministration was profoundly 
involved in this whole process in 1970 despite official 
claims of I.j; neutrality in the Chilean elections. Infor-
mation developed by the f-3enate investigatoo, thins
shows that Chile was the subject of a meeting in Juno 
1970 of the top-secret "Forty Commiree" in the

Special correspondent of 
The Christian. Science Monitor 
Washington 
A Senate foreign-relations subcom-
mittee that investigated International 
Telephone & Telegraph Company's 
attempt to manipulate the Chilean 
Tircsi(lential elections charges that 
:such activity thrcatens to give all 
'multinational corporations a bad 
-name. 
If rrr's actions in trying to enlist 
the Central Intelligence Agency's aid 
in subverting the elections came to. be 
-accepted as "normal,' the committee 
..report said, "no co.mtry would. wel-
:come the presence of multinational 
corporations.'' 
The subcommittee chairman, 
'Frank Church (D) of Idaho, plans to 
introduce legislation to mal:e it illegal 
for U.S. citizens or 'corporations to 
offer money to a government agenty 
to interfere in foreign elections, or for 
the agency to accept. Senator Church 
said he was slit prii7ed to find there is 
no law to prevent it liow. 
;I Jo mid that, althr.mgh ITT appal--
vntly OM nothing illegal, the "highest 
'officials.' of the huge conglomerate 
:'.'overstepped the line of acceptable 
!cOrporate behavior." 
? Senator Church also scored the CIA 
'for its cmnplicity in tic, scheme and 
.suggeste'd that appropriate corn-
hiittees of Cmr,-rc.,ss take a good look 
at what goes on in the agency. 
Congress, he said, "knows very little 
about time CIA." 
it is sin posed to be overseen by the 
Senate Armed Services Committr!e 
and by a select corninit.,.2.. of SiMate 
pliers, but the select committee has 
not even met for several ye.ars. 
Senator Church said tin' next phase 
'of his subcommittee's probe ef the 
multin,iticnals would be a look at the 
clverseas Private lever tmont Corpo-
ration, v.tich guarantee.,; American

This year disclosed that in 1970 ITT 
Offered the CIA a substantial fund to 
support Dr. Allende's conservative 
opponent in the election. This was 
:turned down. 
: The company then offered Si roil-
ion any plan the U.S. Govern-
ment might come up with to block the 
election of Dr. Allende. A high CIA 
official then initiated a proposal to 
:create economic chaos in Chile by 
tich means as having banks delay 
loans, putting pressure on shaky 
savings and loan companies in the 
country, and withdrawing technical 
aid. The company rejected this as 
unworkable. 
The negotiations between ITT and: 
the CIA were carried out in part by 
John McCone, a director of the com-t-----
pany who once headed the CIA. After 
extensive- negotiations, the scheme 
never was adopted by either the 
company or the American Govern-
ment. 
Senator Church, in scoring the 
T'I" s role, made a point of noting that 
other U.S. companies in Chile and 
international ba ribs that were ap-
proached about participating in the 
scheme declined to become involved. 
1.Vhile the ,(_lnate committee has 
finished its probe of ITP, the com-
pany's troubles in Washington inay 
not be entirely over. Documents di,a l-

ITT ownership of Hartford hire

inquiry into pos:-ihie connection be-
tween campaign donations and the 
i.vernment action.

ITT Was a Very Good Year...Dila 
Beard, CIA, Chile 
? - A Commentary 
By Nicholas von Hoffman 
- KANSAS CITY, Mo.?The private detectives had kept 
out all those with no title to be there: the Avis girls, 
in their red blazers, had ushered everyone to their 
seats in the meeting room of this strangely chosen, 
second-rate hotel, and now the hired Godslinger. from 
. 
St. John's Methodist Church was making the invoca-
tional praeludium to this exercise in corporate 
democracy. 
"We should recognize that there are eternal values," 
be informed the 200. to 300 people in the room, and 
as he did so Harold S. Geneen, the chairman and 
chief executive officer of ITT, composed his sharp 
face into an expression verging on that of reverence. 
"We .believe we are men of good will," the clergyman. 
continued, and Francis J. Dunleavy, the president and 
Chief operating officer, the 12 senior vice presidents 
and the 41 just plain vice presidents, give or take 
a few absentees, seemed to be reassuring their Maker 
that they did indeed- have a triple A spiritual Dun 
and Bradstreet. 
.The fifty-third annual ITT stockholders meeting then 
? got under way with a lady in red hotpants complaining 
:that she had been mistreated at an ITT-owned Shera-
ton. Geneen told her she should, bring that up later, 
but she replied that "for $800,000 a year you can put 
up with me." 
"I want a raise," he retorted, and then began his 
annual State of the Corporation Message, but you're 
mistaken if you think he expressed any contrition for 
Dita Beard and her shredding machine, neither of 
which were present, or Chile or the CIA. No, for ITT 
1972 was a "realty" good year and the italics are his. 
Geneen has a message for those of us who think 
it was naughty of him to risk precipitating a civil war 
in somebody else's country to save his chintzy tele-
phone company: It is that we, like him, are the bene-
ficiaries of ITT's imperialism: 
"If we in the United States want to drive to work 
in the 300-horsep0wer, 17-foot car, that we consider a 
- normal standard, and yet compete across the globe 
with an industrious worker who counts himself lucky 
to own a small car or bicycle to get to the factory, 
then it is at least time that we learned to 'bury'- our 
differences?business, labor, government and the con-
sumer alike?and be smart enough to at least 'work 
together'   it is worth emphasizing that the United 
States' stake in international investment and produc-
tion is now (italics his) far more important than 
any possible profit from the export of merchandise. 
In 1972, for example, gross income from United States 
investment abroad came to $10.4 billion positive while 
the United States merchandise balance with other 
co came to OA billion negative." 
C 
Geneen's peculiar use of quotation marks aside, what 
the man was actually saying is, "listen! you moralistic 
numbskulls. you self-righteous pests. we're now getting 
to be in the position of pre-Mrld War I England. 
We're all living off these imperialist inve:2tments, 
abroad, so shut up, and join the cartel." 
Approved For Release 2005/11/28 : CIA-RDP91-00901R000600100004-0 
There were a few present to reproach him, but this 
wasn't a Senate committee meeting: inquiring into 
rrrs anti-antitrust dipsydoodles. This was Geneen's 
turf and he could handle all comers. When one proxy 
bolder challenged what ex-CIA Director and current 
ITT board member John McCone had tried to pull 
off In Chile, the chairman and chief executive officer 
replied, "I think we did right. I'm just sorry we were 
unable to persuade our government to take a stronger. 
position." 
When be got hit again on the subject, this time from 
a Chilean clergyman, Hal told him, "You are a bishop. 
. and I believe that you are sincere in what you are 
saying," and then he went on to complain that if the - 
government could drop $163 billion in Vietnam fighting 
Commies, he didn't understand why it couldn't spend 
a little in South America. 
When another skeptic with a single-share proxy from 
a Ralph Nader group wanted a yes or no answer to a 
question involving an alleged conflict-of-interest situa-
tion with Felix Rohatyn, the ITT board member from 
Lazard Freres, Geneen said, "Ah, grow up." 
While this colloquy was taking place Ned Garrity,7* 
ITrs senior vice president for public affairs, was being 
affable and explaining that the only reason the Nixon 
administration had sued.to divorce Hartford Insurance 
from the big momma conglomerate was that they'd 
found out Geneen was a Humphrey -,cupporter in '68. 
But the most telling blows were struck by Red Hot-
pants, who wanted to put John Connally on the all-
white, all-male board because it lacked a good-looking 
man. She got Geneen. to admit, that not only was he 
not active in any charity whatsoever, but that last year 
this company with 400,000 employees in 90 countries 
and revenues of 88.6 billion dollars had contributed
.00035,per cent of its U.S. pre-tax income to philan-
thropy. 
Geneen, who has learned that power is more im-
portant than public relations, commented, "I think 
we've' been on the low side." Profits should be up again 
this year anyway, and, as red pants says, "Harold, 
nobody but you and I can run this company."

outlay that underdeveloped nations re-
quire if they are ever to become devel-
oped. ITT's holdings in the Chile Tele-
phone Co. were worth S153 million, with 
a remaining 30 per cent of the share be-
ing held by Chilean interests.(Under an 
agreement reached between ITT and 
the pre inns government this figure was 
schedulad to rise to 49 per cent.) 
The latest enormity charged to ITT is 
that it tried to interfere in the 1970 pro-
ceedings which resulted in the selection 
of Salvador Allende as president of 
Chile. On the liberal argument, echoing 
Allemde's own, ITT was guilty of 
meddling in the affairs of a foreign na-
tion, hindering the democratic process 
and exporting American "imperialism" 
to the South. 
Revelation of ITT's concern to head 
off Allende occurred a year ago when 
columnist Jack Anderson latched :onto 
company memoranda on the subject, 
documents Allende's government there-
after published in full as a major ex-
pose' of North American gall. In recent 
weeks Sen. Frank Church (D.-Idaho) 
has seen fit to revive the matter in a 
series of publicized congressional hear-
ings?replete with confirmation by for-
(--mer CIA Director John McCone, now 
with ITT, that he had made an offer 
of $1 million in corporate funds to mo-
bilize resistance to Allende. 
To the liberal mind these various 
charges and admissions are proof con-
clusive that ITT has committed irreme-
diable sin?a laboratory specimen of what 
is wronn with multinational corpora-
tions, U.S. dealings in Latin Amei ica, 
and allaged interlocks between the 
American government and corporate big 
business. Careful inspection of the ITT 
merno:-anda and of the factual record on 
Allende, however, provides an alternate 
reading.

communications, not merely the phone 
company but the ? only vigorous opposi-
tion newspapers.

The ITT memoranda which Allende 
himself has published as major dis-
closures of fact are laden with charges 
that his selection was tantamount to a 
Communist power-play, backed by Fi-
del Castro and the SovietEmbassy, and 
that his accession would mean the death 
of freedom in Chile, suppression of dis-
sent and the outright theft of property 
owned by the shareholders of Chiltelco. 
Fact three is that Allende was not a 
popularly chosen president nor?as sug-
gested by "freely elected" one 
at the time of ITT's involvement. He had 
secured a 36 per cent plurality in a three-
man race and when these memoranda 
were being exchanged had not been 
elected president. That procedure rested 
with the Chilean Congress which could 
in theory at least have favored any one 
of the contestants. 
Allende's shard of the vote was smaller 
than that he received in 1964 against 
Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei, and 
in another two-man race with Frei he 
would almost certainly have lost. The 
memoranda dwell on the possibility of 
securing such an election, though 
Alt teir9iNfis840Altiileas6 ktr5tili2 :ICPPROP94 4009Crt R000600100004-0 
to this effect were rejected by the man-
agement of ITT. 
It is also important to note that steps 
concretely proposed by ITT subordi-
nates were geared to keeping some hope 
of freedom alive in Chile, particularly 
freedom of the press. Thus a September 
1970 memo recounts in detail the strug-
gles of the anti-Communist Mercurio 
papers, a midnight visit by the Allende 
representatives threatening them with 
expropriation and the financial woes the 
paper had experienced in recent months. 
The memorandum concludes with this 
series of suggested actions by ITT: 
"1. We and other U.S. firms in Chile 
pump some advertising into Mercurio. 
(This has been started.) 
"2. We help with getting some propa-
gandists working again on radio and. 
television. There are about 20 people 
that the Matte and Edwards groups were 
supporting and that we should make 
certain they are revived. Allende noa. 
controls two of the three TV stations in 
Santiago and has launched an intensw 
radio campaign. 
"3. Assist in support of a 'family re-
location' counter in Mendoza or Baires 
for wives and children of key persons in-
volved in the fight. This will involve 
about 50 families for a period of a month 
to six weeks, maybe two months. 
"4. Bring what pressure we can on 
USIS in Washington to instruct the San-
tiago USIS to start moving the Mercurio 
editorials around Latin America. lja 
until I left they were under orders not 
to move anything out of this country. 
"5. Urge the key European press. 
through our contacts there, to get the 
story of what disaster could fall on Chile 
if Allende LC: Co. win this country." 
Here, indeed, are nefarious proposals: 
A business firm with a substantial threat-
ened investment in Chile actually tryina 
to shore up the remnants of an indepen-
dent press against a confessing Marx-
ist! On the thesis of the liberals, IT F 
should not have attempted to help the 
Mercurio papers nor lifted a finger to 
prevent the theft of its own property.

ITT, The Ca And The Church Committee 
Testimony so far has thoroughly confused 
the initials ITT and CIA, to the point that 
members of the -SL----371-7?Irabcomm1ttee 
investigating plotting against Chile are 
wondering about possible perjury. 
: William V. Broe, a high Central 
*Intelligence Agency officer, told Senators 
under oath that the president of the 
International Telephone & Telegraph Corp. 
offered the CIA a large sum to try to block 
the election of President Allende of Chile. 
Earlier an ITT vice president had testified 
. that the money was offered to finance 
housing and technical assistance in Chile. 
\111 
This is no doubt the first time anyone ever 
card of using the CIA as an economic 
development agency, and it may be the last, 
if\ the Senators can determine who was 
telling the truth. . 
\ 
But there is further confusion. From the 
testisiTiony so far, it is not clear who 
sponsored a proposal for American 
corporations in Chile to create economic 
,c h a (.1s against Dr. Allende's Marxist 
? . . 
movement. Subcommittee Chairman Churc 
of Idaho thought Mr. Broe proposed it for 
the CIA: Senator Case of New jersey ),1 
thought the initiative may have come from 
ITT. But the two agreed that Mr. Broe acted 
with the approval of his superiors in the CIA 
in discussing such things with 111'. 
The immediate superior was CIA Director , ---
Richard Helms. A former superior was. John ., 8---- 
J. McCone who by this time was an ITT vice I 
president, and he told the Senators he had q 
carried an offer of $1,000,000 to Mr. Helms1 
and a White House assistant for use inl 
heading off Dr. Allende's election. 
Witnesses have been insistent that nothing) - 
came from all the talks and all the money tg 
be used for intervention in Chile. Maybe not; 
but we can almost hear Chileans talkirl, 
now, not of "dollar diplomacy," but of 
million-dollar diplomacy. As for American, 
they ought to find the evidence of, dn 
interlocking directorate between the CIA 
and ITT a shocking example of corporate 
arrogance and of a -distortion of puiilie ? -

do exactly that to keep Salva-

presidency. 
It might be said, of course; 
? that in the end no substantive

officials makes clear that the

with the knowledge and con-

though we have no direct in-

approve, too. 
? What makes this story more 
unsavory than it might be if all 
. we were proposing was to save 
the Chileans. from commu-
nism, which we once thought 
had a certain idealism to it, 
are the recurring themes of 
money and cronyism. 
The man who got this proj-

Bather than just being unnerved by 
the revelations of IT'1"s misadventurc? 
in Chile, maybe we oueht to go on to 
hail the case as the best real proof 
we've had so far of the end of the cold 
war. 
For while the CIA was cvldentl)r-
dabbli?g with rrt on the theory that /I 
Marxist government in Chile might 
pose some kind of political or strategic 
disadvantage to the United :iIlates, ITT 
saw the prospect of an Ailciitle victory 
for what it was to 1TT: a kick in the 
wallet. 
Faithful old cold-warhorse John Me-. 
Cone, the former iIA director who'd 
signed on as a director to 1717, may 
have conceived of ITT's idterept to 
purchase a million dollars-. wart!i of 
subversion from :the CIA as an anti-
Communist act tracing its line:tn.:4/ to 
the Berlin Airlift. That's what he told 
the Senate Forel: n Relation:: multina-
tional corporations subcommittee in-
vestigating the af"air. 
But Harold Geneen, president c.f

to make the claim that vhat's bad for 
ITT is had for the country: he went TO

the change even before the U.S.

for the CIA's political put-non-et in

the CIA for its own economic/ pur-

ITT and CIA: Uneasy Riders  
ITT President Harold Geneen had a tough choice. He 
tag:mild support ITT director John McCone's testimony that 
the $1 million the giant conglomerate offered the United 
7States government in September 1970 was meant to 
:aid Chile's development. Or he could support his senior 
vice president Edward Gerrity's _testimony that the 
offer was meant to block the election of Chilean Presi-
dent Salvador Allende. Mr. Geneen showed that at ITT 
the truth too is a conglomerate. He said he could not 
.recall offering a CIA operative the $1 million to under-
? mine the Chilean elections but he would accept the - 
.operative's sworn word to that effect. And he said the 
offer had a "dual" purpose, development and political 
intervention. 
-- On this ambivalent note, Senator Church's Foreign 
Relations subcommittee on multinational corporations 
.concluded the ITT hearings, its first in a continuing 
series on the relationship between corporate activity and 
American, foreign policy. That relationship, the hear-
ings suggest, is deep and dark indeed: ITT, it turns 
out, had offered the CIA money to influence Chile's 
election in 1964; that offer was refused, although the 
?CIA evidently was active in that election. In 1970, 
when it appeared that a Marxist, Mr. Allende, might 
be elected, ITT promptly went again to CIA. The cor-
poration feared Mr. Allende might hurt its Chilean 
interests and it believed, or at least hoped, that the 
U.S. government remained interested in helping sus-
tain "democratic" government in Chile. To its dismay, 
.,ITT found CIA in July in a hands-off posture. CIA 
refused its money, both then and later in September 
-before the runoff election. But meanwhile, turning the 
tables, CIA suggested that ITT take steps to sabotage 
.Mr. Allende in the runoff. Finding the suggested steps 
-unworkable, ITT declined. 
Anyone halfway familiar with the pattern of Ameri-
can involvement in Chile in the 1960s can scarcely 
avoid feeling that both the UniteC States government 
and one or more American corporations doing business 
in Santiago entered the '70s wan a certain mutual 
? or parallel disposition to do something to help their 
friends in Chile again. Contacts were easily made on 
the highest level, information routinely exchanged: for-
mer CIA director McCone was by Low, for instance, an 
ITT director. It seems to have been taken for granted 
that either the government or the corporation could 
and would influence the 1.970 electitn. The (olly question 
was whether ITT would use CIA which, the hearings 
showed, was acting not on its own but under appropri-
ate supervision), or whether CIA would use ITT. In 
the end, though both found an Allende victory unpalat-
able, neither would take direct responsibility for trying 
to stop him and neither would let the other use it for 
that aim. 
Or is it the end? Understandably, the Senate hearings 
told much more of plans discussed in Washington than 
of acts committed in Chile. Yet the public record of 
events in and affecting Chile cannot be ignored. There. 
was and is in that Latin nation severe economic dis-
location and political ferment. Can any N.f it be laid 
to sabotage undertaken by ITT or CIA or?one is tempt-
ed to say?a combination of the two? The administra-
tion ostensibly took a hands-off stance in 1970. Yet 
then and since, the United States has used its influence 
in the international banks to block all new credits to 
Chile on the publicly stated grounds that Chile's finan-
cial condition and creditworthiness were shaky. By its 
own hints or deeds, has the United States contributed 
to the shakiness which it has cited to justify its policy 
on loans? 
Given the secrecy. available to governments and cor-
porations, and given the charged political atmosphere 
between Santiago and Washington, it is illusory to expect 
that questions like these can be definitively answered. 
Precisely because they cannot, however, they must be 
asked: The issues they touch go to the heart of how 
American policy is conceived and conducted and how 
American interests are defined and served in the field. 
It should go without saying that American taxpayers 
should not pay ITT its claim for expropriation insurance 
for its nationalized telephone interests in Chile, the 
more so that Chile's contention stands unrefuted that 
it was considering compensation at the time last year 
when the first, disclosures of an ITT role in 1970 were 
made. Paying the insurance claim would he like pay-
ing hospital Costs to a would-be burglar who, after bring-
ing his jimmy to your window, tripped and fell on your 
garden hose while trying to flee. As to the dispute over. 
the nationalized copper firms, and the issue of debt re-
scheduling, we would put these in the "too hard" basket, 
at least for today. 
The new conventional wisdom holds that, with the 
worst of cold war over, economic activity is to move 
ever more closely to the center of American interna-
tional affairs. The disclosures made at the ITT hearings, 
and the gaps left by the hearings, indicate how vital it 
is to scrutinize the interaction of corporate and official 
policy and to determine where hest the national interest 
lies.

The ITT-CIA Story 
Just imagine this situation: "The United States 
is conducting a presidential election in which one 
candidate holds political views hostile to Super-
Conglomerates Ltd., a mythical multinational 
colossus with home offices in Chile. SCL,.as we will 
call it, approaches Chile's chief intelligence agency 
and offers up to $1 million to finance any govern-
ment plan to undercut the unwanted candidate. 
The agency is tempted but refuses since official 
policy, of course, is noninterference in the internal 
affairs of other countries. After inconclusive bal-
loting throws the choice of a President into the 
Congress (which is possible under the U.S. Consti-
tution), the Chilean agency reconsiders by offering 
'a plan whereby SCL and other interested private 
companies would apply propaganda and economic 
pressure themselves to swing Congress against 
Mr. Unwanted. The scheme then develops one good 
attribute?it fails to conicoff. 
How would you feel about this? Well, if you are 
John A. McCone,..former director of the Central 
Intelligence Agency and presently a director of 
International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, 
you would be "distressed" if any foreign govern-
ment presumed to meddle in an American election, 
And you would. be ."even more distressed" if a 
private corporation tried to interfere .for its own 
corporate purposes. 
Yet, alas, this kind of thing seems to have hap-
pened in real life right out there in the real world. 
In 1970 there was a presidential election not in the 
:United States but in Chile. One of the candidates 
was not Mr. Unwanted but Salvador Allende, cur-
rently Chilels.Marxist_president. And very worried 
about Mr. Allende was not Super-Conglomerates, 
Ltd., but none other than John A. McCone's awn 
ITT. So Mr. McCone himself, who still acts as a 
consultant to the CIA, conveyed ITT's offer to 
subsidiR covert operations to Henry A. Kissinger 
and the then CIA chief, Richard Helms. The CIA, ? 
in turn, later reciprocated by suggesting that ITT 
and other companies take private measures to 
block Mr. Allende. 
This sorry story has been unfolding before the 
Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on mul-. 
tinational corporations. To the credit of the Nixon 
administration, most evidence suggests that the 
ITT financial offer was spurned and the CIA, in. the 
words of Senator Fulbright, was "going off on a 
frolic of its own." - 
Nevertheless, the ITT scandal cannot be written 
off because certain officials in the White House 
and the State Department behaved properly. One 
lesson to be learned is that private companies, and 
especially those of a multinational character, can 
do grave harm to U.S. national interests by using 
their American connection as leverage in the 
affairs of their host countries. Another lesson is 
the danger implicit in an intelligence agency that 
becomes too powerful, too independent, too uncon-
trolled. 
For the time being it is vain to hope for a 
refurbishing of the tattered 'U.S. image that 
emerges from this affair. The Organization of 
American States meeting opening in Washington 
today may attest to that. But if the Senate hearings 
promote- more self-restraint among the multina-
tional corporation3 and if they 'inspire the admin-
istration to continue its curtailment.of CIA covert 
activities they will have served a purpose.

... And Curiouser 
Harold S. Geneen, the ITT president, capped 
the performances of previous company wit-
nesses before a Senate subcommittee investi-
gating the firm's dealings in Chile. After Mr. 
?Geneen had danced nimbly around the contra-
dictions of the case, Chairman Church of?Idaho 
exclaimed that the testimony was getting "curi-
ouser and curiouser." Little Alice's Wonderland 
expression is apt enough. 
. Commenting on a CIA officer's testimony that 
Mr. Geneen had offered a substantial sum to 
the CIA to finance an attempt to block the 
election of Chile's President Allende, Mr. Ge-
neen said he couldn't recall the offer but would 
accept the testimony. He did concede that such 
.an offer surfaced again, because an ITT di-
rector and former CIA. director, John A. 
Cone, had said as much. But all the Interna-
tional Telephone & Telegraph Corp. ever did, 
Mr. Geneen insisted, was to present its views 
to various government agencies. Especially the 
CIA. 
What is even curiouser is Mr. Gencen's com-
ment on the testimony of another ITT execu-
tive that the offer of up to $1,000,000 was not 
to block President Allende's election but to 
provide development aid in housing and agri-
culture. Well, said Mr. Gencen, it was a "dual 
offer" ? either to finance an anti-Allende co-
alition or to finance development. Build a house 
or block a foreign election.. 
While the Senators are trying to figure out 
what to believe, the clear evidence of a cozy 
ITT-CIA relationship suggests one thing. That 
military-industrial complex of which the late 
President Eisenhower warned seems to have 
room for an intelligence-industrial complex, 
perhaps as a subsidiary.

ITT, .CIA and Chile . 
"WHAT did ITT really do in Chile?" The question 
is posed on the cover of an ITT public relations 
packet received here awhile back. The packet offers 
its own answer: "Nothing" . . . except such good 
works as providing employment, investing money ' 
and paying taxes, training students and operating 
the -telephone company. ? 
What International Telephone & Telegraph didn't 
do was subvert the democratic processes to prevent 
the 1970 election of Marxist President Salvador Al-
lende. But as testimony before a U.S. Senate sub-
committee is making pretty clear, it wasn't for lack 
of trying,. The central plan, according to witnesses, 
involved an ITT offer of up to $1 million to help 
finance CIA support for Allende's opponent. 
John A. McCone, an ITT director and former head 
of the CIA, acted as the go-between. He said the 
offer wasn't intended for political sabotage but for 
more good works such as housing and technical as-
sistance. But $1 million doesn't go far in that mar-
ket. It's a'tidy sum, though, with which to buy off 
politicians. 
Let it be admitted that ITT's fears about Allende 
probably were justified. Let it even be conceded 
that ITT had a right to seek protection for its 
Chilean investment in both Santiago and Washing-
ton. But tb attempt to involve the U.S. government 
in the effort through an approach to its spying and 
sabotage specialists strongly suggests that what 
I.TT had in mind was outright U.S. interference in 
Chile's internal politics. Fortunately, someone ? 
perhaps as highly placed as Henry Kissinger?had 
the good sense to say no. 
Still, ITT must have had some expectation?pos-
sibly on the basis of experience?that Washington 
would agree to the deal. Otherwise wouldn't Mc-
Cone have advised a different approach? As it was, 
the CIA apparently offered a counter-plan of its 
own to create economic chaos in Chile, which ITT 
rejected. 
All this suggests that the ultimate question is 
not what did 117 fail to get away with in 1970, but 
what has the CIA helped multinational corporations 
get away with on ot her occasions? If the Senate sub-
committee probes far enough, what ITT did in Chile 
may seem, comparatively speaking, like "nothing.''

ITT Affair 
The admissions, denials and admissions revolving 
around that $1 million that ITT offered the CIA has 
, caused more intrigue in techniques and diverted atten-
tion from the central point. There seems to be more 
interest in how rrr tried to manipulate the CIA than in 
the fact that it attempted the manipulation. 
- First William Merriam who headed ITT's Wash-
: ington office when the offer was made, told the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee that he pressured the 
" White House and the State Department to threaten 
Chile with economic collapse. The idea was to persuade 
. the Allende government to "pay us off" after it expro-
priated the Chile Telephone Co .in which ITT owns 70 
pet. cent. The company is said to be worth $150 million. 
Stich pressure by an American company seeking 
? governmental help in protecting its interests may be 
understandable, but it becomes downright suspicious 
? after, reviewing Tri"s apparently special relationship 
with the administration. It was ITT which made that 
huge contribution to the Republican convention com-
mittee and which received special consideration in an 
? anti-trust case. - 
The current affair became more sordid when John 
J. McCone, who once headed t.lifA ,and is now an t---" 
ITT director, admitted to the Senate committhe that ITT 
did offer $1 million to the White House to implement' 
a plan which would assure defeat of President Allende. 
Two points emerge. One can believe that President 
Allende is not serving the best interests of the Chilean 
people and yet insists that ITT or even the CIA has no 
business interfering in domestic Chilean affairs. 
Secondly it is a bit frightening knowing that firms ? 
of size have millions of dollars available to buy 
!governmental policies. The only encouraging aspect is 
! that as far as we know now, the money was not accepted. ,

Interference in 
? Testimony by a CIA official before a Senate 
committee has confirmed that the intelligence agency 
did play a part, if only a background part, in trying 
to head off the election of Dr. Salvador Allende as 
president of Chile in 1970. That part of the testi-
mony given by William V. Broe, who was in charge 
of clandestine operations in Latin America at that 
time, indicates that the CIA action was confined to 
proposing that International Telephone and Tele-
graph Co. and other American firms bring economic 
pressure on Chile in the hope of swaying some mem-
bers of the Chilean Congress to vote against Dr. 
Allende. But even that is hardly the kind of inter-
ference in the free elections of another nation that 
tiny agency of the U.S. government ought to be en-
gaged in. Mr. Broe's testimony prompted Sen. Frank 
Church, chairman of the Senate subcommittee on mul-
tinational corporations, to observe that "very im-
? proper" moves were made. 
True, that was not so bad as what the president 
of ITT, Harold Geneen, had proposed to Mr. Broe 
before the initial election was held. Mr. Geneen, 
according to the testimony, had offered the CIA 'a 
."substantial sum" to influence the election. Later, 
Vanother ITT official, John A. McCone, former CIA 
director, had indicated willingness to put up one 
million dollars for a plan that would organize opposi-
tion to Allende's choice by the Congress. 
STAT 
0901R000600100004-0 
The attempts to "buy" CIA services Were .quite 
properly refused. If thrT378r7vernment ever feels 
it necessary to oppose actions in another country, it 
certainly should finance the operations itself. But 
more to the point is the impropriety of attempting 
to intervene in another country's election, directly or 
indirectly. Private corporations, we suppose, have a 
right to mix in politics in foreign nations where 
they operate. ITT undoubtedly had the right to op-
pose Allende, although it also had to run the risk of 
retaliation by him and his followers. 
The fact was, of course, that Dr. Allende, an 
avowed Marxist, had announced his intention to ex-
propriate the Chilean telephone holdings of ITT? 
worth an estimated 153 million dollars. ?Moreover,, 
he followed through on his proposal, and no corn-
pensation has been paid thus far. The kind of 
economic pressure the CIA had suggested before 
Mr. Allende's election has been applied sifIce then 
and undoubtedly has contributed to the difficulties 
that Chile has experienced in the last two years. ?The 
campaign has been led more or less openly by the 
Americans; but Dr. Allende came out of the recent 
congressional elections in a stronger position than 
before. 
The 'problem of expropriation is still a very 
sticky one. But the problem. of interference in 
another nation's election processes ought to be clear. 
Very simply stated, it is: stay out.

Washington ? Harold S. 
peneen, the chairman of ITT, 
--said yesterday that if he ever 
' offered to finance CIA activi-
ties in Chile, it was just an 
Impromptu offer that .was re-
jected and quickly forgotten. 
.Mr. Geneen told the Senate 
subcommittee on multina-
tional corporations that he did 
not remember ever telling a 
C.I.A.-4gent that ITT was will-
ing to collect a "substantial 
sum" for the CIA. to spend 
againSt the Chilean Marxist, 
Salvador Allende, itt Allencie's 
1970 presidential campaign. ' 
But he said he does not dis-
Pute testimony to this effect: 
by a CIA agent, William V. 
Broe, who appeared before 
the subcommittee last week. 
Mr. Geneen said he could 
have made such a proposal 
- 'in the shock of recognizing 
- that our Chilean investment 
e was going down the drain." 
One plank in the Allende plat-
form called for expropriation 
of U.S. properties in Chile, 
including ITT's 159-million-
dollar investment in the Chi-
lean Telephone Co. 
The CIA rejected the offer. 
Also, Mr. Geneen.confirmed 
two somewhat conflicting ac-
? counts of a later ITT money 
offer, saying that the com-
pany proposed giving up to a 
Million dollars to supt)ort eny 
U.S. government plan needed 
to block Allende's election or 
to ma Re the ma rx is t more 
friendly toward U.S. interests. 
This offer tvae proposed 
vvith "a hind of dual pur-
- Pose," Mr. Geta.en said. 
Seth Frank Church, I)-
Idaho, the subcom mit t oe's 
chairman, said that either 
put-pose would "represent an 
improper inteeventionA# ed 
can polities,'' am! i - 
.ford Case, It-New Jersey, said 
the ITT move was "provoca-
tive." 
? 
T h e Geneen testimony 
-capped eight days of subcom-
mittee hearings into ITT con-
tacts with the CIA on the 
company's plans, to influence 
Chilean politics. 
As the hearings ended, Mr. 
Church said he is considering 
legislation to prohibit compa-
nies from offering money to 
the CIA for any purpose. 
"The wider the distances be-
tween these big businesses 
and the CIA," he said, "the 
better for all concerned." 
Mr. Broe, who in 1970 was 
the CIA's chief of clandestine 
services, Western Hemi-
sphere, told the subcommittee 
last week that Mr. Geneen 
met with him in July, 1970, 
and offered to raise a "sub-
stantial sum" to support one 
of Allende's opponents in the 
election, Jorge Alessandri, a 
conservative. 
The meeting was arranged 
by an ITT director, John J. 
te? McCone, who also was a 
former CIA director . then 
serving as a consultant to the 
secret agency. 
1R000600100004-0 
The IT).' chief said company 
- policy in foreign countries is 
"a policy of not intervening ? 
a neutrality policy, baSical-
iy.I. 
"YOu certainly violated this 
neutrality when you made your 
offer to Mr. Broe," Sen. Church 
said. - 
The subcommittee also 
questioned Mr. Geneen about 
the .September money offer, 
which witnesses described in 
contradictory terms last 
.week. Mr. McCone had tes-
tified that the company of-
fered up to a million dollars 
to the administration for any 
"constructive": government 
plan to strengthen the anti-
Allende forces in Chile and 
prevent an Allende vie tory 
while ITT's Edward J. Ger-
rity Jr., a senior vice pres-
ident, said the plan was to 
"reassure" Allende. 
Mr. Geneen contended yes-
terday that he had, at the 
time, both kinds of plans in 
mind: either something to en-
courage Allende's opponents, 
or ? if that cause was lost ? 
something to encourage Al-
lende to take a friendlier atti-
tude toward U.S. interests. 
"If I were Dr. Allende," 
Sen. Case declared, "I would 
regard- that -(offer) es a pro-
vocative thing." 
That would depend on what 
the second plan was," Mr. 
Geneen said. 
"I don't think I would ever 
get over the first one," Sen. 
Case replied. 
Mr. Geneen said yesterday 
that his Jul' rendezvous with. 
Mr. Broe "was set up for me

recently, knew of the ITT pro-

Galleerl did not admit directly 
what he had said, and carefully 
skirted issues. At one point he 
stated: 
'I understand 111r. Broe recalls 
that I raised a question whether 
a contribution could be made 
through the agency to support a 
de macro tic can against

'I don't recall this part of the 
conversation, but it is a matter I 
might well have raised in view of

-Since I have no recollection to

Since the figure Geneen is al-
leged to have offered has been re-
ported as ($1. million, it seems rath-
er a big matter about which to 
have so little recollection. 
Witnesses have also testified 
and documents attest. that ITT 
officials eng,,:?ged in discussions 
about crippling, the Chilean eCOT1-
only after the 1970 election. 
Geneen declared, "All that ITT 
did was to present its views, eon-
;r Ir.?,

corns and ideas to various de-

ment. This is not only its right, 
but also its obligation." The 
claim that the use or corporaticn 
funds to control a foreign election 
is a "very important constitution-
al right" is a new angle for U.S. 
monopoly. 
Geneen advanced this argument 
a step further, saying that "the 
management of any company has 
a direct obligation to the share-
holders and to the employes to at-
tempt to protect their interests.-

Misadventures on Chile 
- "Somebody has lied," Senator Frank Church said in 
reference to contradictory testimony before his Foreign 
Relations subcommittee on political schemes proposed 
for Chile by. the International Telephone and Telegraph 
-Corporation and the Central Intelligence Agency. Some-
body certainly has, and it becomes even more imperative 
for the committee to establish who it was?now that 
'I.T.T. chairman Harold S. Geneen has added to the evi-
dent contradictions in sworn testimony. 
? Mr. Geneen insists that the giant firm he heads "did 
not take any steps to block the election of Salvador Al-
lende as President of Chile" and that an director 
:"did not offer to contribute anything to the C.I.A.," in 
?-?"" talks with Richard Helms, then director of the intelligence 
agency, and with Ilenry A. Kissinger in the White house. 
But that I.T.T. director, John A..':,leCone, toid the sub-
committee on March 21 that Mr. Geneen ban instrocted 
him to inform Mr. Helms and Mr. .Nissin: that the 
corporation was ready to contribute a million dollars 
or more "in support of any Govotimicnt plan for bring-
ing about a coalition of oppeaition to Alirtale." 
- Mr. Geneen iriSLLS that all I.T.T. did after the Allende 
Government took over its Chilean subsidiaty in 1971 
was "to present its :views, concerns and ideas" to various 
Government departments in Washirgton, This, he said, 
.was :`not only I.T.T.'s constitutional right but also its 
obligation." ? 
But Willizun R. Merriam, an I.T.T. vice president, 
sent a letter and an "action" memorandum to e White 
-House economic adviser in October 1971 with en eighteen-
point plan for economic action to .insure "that Allende . 
does not get through the next six months." ?N 
Mr. McCone's testimony and 11In Merriam's letter 
and memorandum could seriously jeopardize I.T.T.'s 
claim for S92.5 million in compensation from the United 
States Government's Overseas Private Investment Corpo-
ration for the seizure of its Chilean properties. But the 
C.I.A. has also been severely tarnished in testimony before 
Senator Church's committee. 
0901R000600100004-0 
By making its o vn proposal to I.T.T. for waOrinco-
nomic Nvar against Chile and thus, it hoped, persuading 
the Chilean Congress to reject Dr. Allende in 1970, the 
C.I.A. went wildly beyond any legitimate intelligence 
function and also disclosed incredible ignorance and 
naivet?bout Chile's political situation. 
If a State Department Witness is correct in insisting 
that the official United States policy toward Chile, before 
and after Dr. Allende's election, was one of "noninter-
vention," it is evident that the C.I.A. once again was con-
ducting its own foreign policy, '"going off on a frolic of 
its own," as Senator Fulbright suggested, and raising 
anew the question whether there are effective controls 
over its agents and activities.

Sen. Frank Church (D-Icia.) wants to make it a 
crime for a company or an individual to offer mon-
ey to the Central Iutelligence Aeency, or for the 
supersecret agency to accept it. Testimony before a 
Senate foreign relations subcommittee, which is 
looking into the activities of multinational corpora-
tions, has pl'oduced disturbing evidence that such a 
law is needed. 
There is nothing wrong, of course, with the CIA 
maintaining contacts with American companies 
tioine: business abroad. They can be a valuable 
source of inlinn-ncition about trends and events in 
CAAICT countriCA. 
It, would be quite another thing, however, for the 
intelligence agency to accept financial contribu-
tions from corporations. The national interest is 
not necessarily identical to that of U.S. companies 
doing business in a certain area: no one should ever 
have reason to wonder whether the CIA is working 
for the American people or for a corporate donor.. 
Yet William V. Dice, former head of the CIA's 
Clandestine operations in Latin America, told the 
Church subcommittee t1-1-:t in 1n) the agency was 
offered a substantial sum by Harold S. Geneon, 
board chairman of International Tel.ephone & Teie-
;i-rapli Corp. The purpose of the proposed contribu-
tion, which \vaS; rejected, was to block the election' 
of Dr. Salvador Allende, a Marxist, as president of 
Chile. 
Earlier, John A. MeCone, an ITT director, testi-
fied that several such approaches were made by 
U.S. companies clurin.; the time he was head or the 
CIA. All were rejected, be said, but obviously legis-
lation 15 needed to inal:e sure that this kind of thing 
does not happen. 
According to Brae, the CIA itself at one point 
toyed with the idea of enrolling U.S. comp3nies in a 
scheme to promote economic! instability in Chile and 
thereby influence the Chilean Congress to block. 
Allende's election. 
Former Asst. Secretary of State Charles Meyer 
told the subcommittee Thursday that the CIA 
proposal was never accepted as government policy, 
that the agency was only exploring various options. 
Maybe so, but it is disturbing that intorfeicntiT in a 
free and democratic election ;Process was even con-
sidered. 
If there is a bright side to the Church hearings, it 
is that such vital but sensitive inatiers ,are being 
threshed out in the open, so corrective action can 
.be taken. The Act ninistration dr-serves credit for 
breaking precedent and allowing a CIA .a::-.--,ent.to 
testify before a. Senate committee. This was a case 
Nvhore such testimony \vas clearly in the public in-
terest.

By DOUGLAS C. WILSON 
Journat-BuBeau iru,hingtork Bureau 
Washington ? Sen. Frank 
Church, D4daho, said yester-
day that "somebody is lying" 
to Senate investigators about 
dealings between Interna-
tional Telephone and Tele-
graph and the U.S. govern-
ment with regard to Chile. 
He also suggested that ITT 
officials have been telling 
"fairy tales" about the com-
pany's plan to offer up to. a 
million dollars in economic 
assistance to Chile in 1970, 
during Chile's presidential 
contest. 
Church said, "The record 
before .us, as it now stands, 
suggests that the ITT success-
fully lobbied the CIA on be-
half of a covert operation (in 
Chile)." 
He spoke as chairman of 
the Senate subcommittee on 
? multinational corporal ions, 
which is continuing its inves-
tigation into a 1970 rela-
tionship between Yrr and the 
CIA.. 
dollars for economic assis-
tance to Chile. They disagre,?.1' 
about their intentions, howev-
er. 
John J. McCone, an ITT 
director, and former director 
of the CIA, said the idea was 
to encourage opposition to Al-
lende in Chile's runoff election 
Oct. 24. McCone said he spoke 
about the offer to both Rich-
teeard Helms, then director of 
the CIA, and to Henry Kis-
singer, President Nixon's na-
timal security adviser. 
Aimed to Reassure 
Edward J. Gerrity Jr., a 
senior vice president of ITT, 
said the proposed aid was in-
tended as a move to reassure 
Allende, not to oppose him. 
He said another TIT man, 
Jack Neal, relayed the offer 
to Charles Meyer, then assis-
tant secretary of state for 
Inter-American affairs, and to 
Viron Va.ley of Kissinger's 
staff. 
Sum 'Substantial' 
A CIA agent told the sub-
committee in sworn testimony 
this week that rrr's top exec-
utive, harold Geneen, offered 
his agency a "substantial 
sum" in July, 19T0, for the 
CIA to use to support. the Con-
servative candidate against 
Salvador Allende, a Marxist, 
in the Chilean election. 
In his campaign, Allende 
had threatened to expropriate 
'U.S. properties in Chile, in-
cluding the Chilean Telephone 
Company, which .was owned 
by ITT. 
The CIA nen, William 
tyviroe, said the CIA rejected 
the offer but later, in ;41)-
1e: ober, propesed that ITT 
and other companies try to in-
fluence the election by put ung 
"ecorionic pressure" on 
Chile. 
Ilroe said yin' rejected that 
But the question of possible 
perjury arose yesterday when 
Meyer told the subcommittee 
that the ITT man did not 
make such an offer. "I re-
member neither a figure, nor 
a purpose, nor anything con-
crete being mentioned. And 
;n certain I would re-
member," he 
"It's obvious, based upon 
the sworn testimony that we 
have received to date, that 
somebody is lying," Senator 
Church said. "We must take a 
very serious view of perjury 
under oath," 
Ile said the subcommittee 
will review the testimony to 
see if any iiesaury is involved. 
if it is, he will recommend 
ti-v, Dcmir 
1 sent to tote appropriate ac.-
1 ion. 
In the ceurse of the Meyer 
testimony, the Reiha semoor 
,:bts cvi,c caO?reci

r"--7 (7e7' 
about ITT's willingness to 
provide a million dollars for a 
government plan involving 
Chile. But he said no -specific - 
uses for the money were men-
tioned, and he did nothing 
about the offer. 
He said Kissinger never 
told him about a million-
dollar offer by McCone, and 
that he, in turn, never told Kis-
singer about the million-dollar 
offer by Neal. 
The subcommittee quizzed 
the former assistant secretary 
of state, Meyer, about the 
CIA's approach to ITT to sug-
gest that U.S. companies 
exert "economic pressure" on . 
Chile in an effort to swing the 
election against Allende. 
Meyer said he had not 
? known .about the CIA ap-
proach to TIT; but he main-
tained that U.S. policy 
throughout the entire period 
was one of non-intervention in 
Chilean political affairs. 
"Then we must conclude 
that this was done by the CIA 
on its own. The CIA was being 
lobbied by the ITT and they 
had a little thing going," 
Church said. 
Meyer argued that the Broe 
testimony indicated that the 
CIA's approach to TIT was 
only "to explore the possibili-
ties" for a change in U.S. poli-
cy; that no change occurred; 
and that -"nothing sinister" 
had happened. 
The subcommittee members ? 
disagreed with this. "It's ? 
clear that we've got two poli-
cies: CIA policy and your pol-
icy," Sen. 3. William Fut-
bright, 1)-Ark, .told Meyer. 
"The CIA vets going off on a 
frolic: of its, own at the request 
of withoot even ?

Washington ? A CIA agent "When Mr. Geneen appears, 
told Senate investigators this 
week that the head of the In-

his agency a ''substantial

He said the CIA .rejected 
the offer but ? later ProPosed 
that ITT and other companies 
try to influence the election 
by putting "economic pres-

said ITT, in turn, rejected the 
CIA plan. 
The two attempts to block 
,the election of Salvador Al-
lende, a Marxist, as Chile's 
president were disclosed yes-

released parts of the testimo-

we will read. to him Mr. 
Broe's testimony on these 
very crucial points and then 
ask him to give us his an-

Broe told the subcommittee 
that the ITT head offered to 
collect "a substantial fund'' 
for the CIA to use in support 
of Chile's conservative presi-

tinning against Allende. 
Allende threatened in the 
campaign to expropriate U.S. 
properties including l'FT's

In questioning Broe about 
his July meeting with Geneen, 
Senator Church asked: "Dur-
ing the discussion did Mr. 
Geneen at any time indicate 
thEit the fund that he stood 
ready to contribute was in-
tended for constructive use, 
technical assistance to agri-
culture, the building of houses 
or anything of that charac-:

rectors, John J. McConek--- No. It was to support Jorge

Alessandri," the CIA agent 
replied. 
told the subcommittee last 
week that he had told Helms 
and Henry Kissinger, Pres-
ident Nixon's top foreign poli-
cy adviser, that ITT during 
this period was willing to put 
up one million dollars for any 
U.S. government plan to en-
courage formation of a con-
gressional coalition against 
Allende. This offer apparently 
was separate from Geneen's 
earlier offer in July. 
At that time, while McCone 
was an ITT directot4, he a:"so 
was serving as a CIA consult-
ant. 
McCone and other ITT ?of-
ficers have testified that the 
million dollars was intended 
for "constructive" purposes, 
such as housing and technical 
assistance. 
Bree said Helms had told 
him that his July meeting 
with Gr.neen was set up at 
lieCone's racist. This cor-
rohosate.; the testimony Mc. 
Cone gave last w-cc?ii. 
But McGone also said he - 
knew of no pre-September 
plan to ral-ie merey far use in 
the Chilean (lie c? Lion. 
In his earlier testimony, 
.1IcCone said he believed tha' 
while multinational corpora. ? 
tons could offer support for a 
government plan, they should 
not take "indep.rndent 
initia-
't,.c" to involve 'themselves in. 
the domestic politics of host 
countries.

A CIA agent has told Sen-

York on orders from CIA Di-
rector Ricuard Helms and 
explored with him the feasi-
bility of applykyi, economic 
pres.mre that mint affect the 
outcome of the 1970 Chilean 
presidential election, 
The testimony was from 
6- William V. Brea, former chief 
of CIA clandestine services 
in the Western Hemisphere, 
who testified . Tuesday in 
closed session under oath 
before the Senate Forei;-.1n 
Relations subcommittee ea

Broe described to the sub-
Committee headed by Sen.

the 1970 Chilean election 
which ProPciled Marxist. Sal-

the mectins, Brae told t"..?.2 
subcommit,ee, stemmed from 
suggestoia of John MeCone,

an ITT ddrcestor and former

Helms' instructions to Broe.

Gerrity had testified about an 
earlier offer by ITT to pro-
vide the U.S. with u2 to i31 
million to ?.pply to the Chile 
situation. Gerrity testified the 
ir.oney was to be limited to 
constructive projects, such ps 
heusing, and agricultural ex-

with 1 TT President Darold

Church brought out in cpte.s-

with Gerrity that they discuss-
ed the following, actions: That 
banks should delay or not re-
new credits: that companies 
drag their fe2t in spending 
money, making deliveries and 
shipping spare parts, creating 
pressure on savings and loan 
institutions so they would have

Broe said he considered 
these measures ?,vere to create

but not to lament unrest that 
would load to military inter-

Of U.S. companies doing busi-
