 Our analysts think the.
 -- article puts forward articulate well reasoned arguments
 that, for the most part are historically correct.
 -- There is a quarrel over the tone of the presentation.
 These differences lead our analysts to be generally
 more pessimistic about the SRV's interest in a political
 settlement.   Folks here think that the notion that the
 SRV sort of stumbled across the Mekong is overdrawn.
 SRV is portrayed as being more reluctant on Kampuchea
 than they probably were and as being more anxious to
 settle and able to settle than they probably really are.
 -- OER analyst doubts rebuilding the economy was really
 principal objective after war,with us.   The economy is now
 in a shales, with Kampuchean threat elimated why haven't
 they devoted more attention to it.   They do not know how to
 go about long range economic development.
 -- OSR picks up on          last paragraph about the kind of
 government Hanoi would need and is skeptical that there is
 really sufficient common ground for settlement.   They don't
 see how China could abide government in sympathy with Hanoi.
 -- OPA says it stronger, although they would no doubt prefer
 to establish a viable puppet regime which could gain
 international acceptance and support -- as the regime in
 Laos has done -- they will keep military forces in
 Kampuchea as long as necessary to insure their control.
 -- OPA also notes even during the Vietnamese Foreign Minister's
 recent trip to Malaysia and in preparations for his upcoming
 discussions in Bangkok, the Vietnamese have shown no real
 signs of interest in a political compromise in Kampuchea.
 They may make some gestures to draw out the ASEAN states
 and weaken their unity -- token troop withdrawals or
 consideration of another Khmer leader as a figurehead for
 the regime -- but Hanoi still clearly considers the Kampuchean
 situation to be "irreversible." In the near future, Hanoi is
 not apt to compromise on the central issue of its domination
 there.

 -- There are of course several other key factors that
 figure prominently in a discussion of the prospects
 for a settlement.
 - Chinese attitude
 - SRV's concern at being labeled a Soviet Satellite
 - ASEAN attitude.

 the Vietnamese apparently viewed the Kampucheans as Chinese
 surrogates and a potentially more serious military problem.
 F
 It is true that Kampuchean forces, rather than the
 Vietnamese, provoked the border clashes during 1977 and
 1978, and that the Vietnamese would have preferred in early
 1979 to concentrate on economic development rather than
 becoming embroiled in military operations against the
 Kampucheans.   They showed restraint because of their broader
 priorities.   That does not mean the Vietnamese had no.designs
 on Kampuchea, however--they simply favored economic pressures
 and political subversion at that early point.   With more than
 !50 million people, compared to an estimated 6 million Kampucheans,
 and a much more powerful military apparatus, the Vietnamese
 ,were no doubt confident of their long-term ability to dominate

 Pol Pot, moreover, was acutely aware of the threat.         He
 warned repeatedly that the Vietnamese intended to "swallow"

 Vietnamese assumed.  II

 1.  Apropos of your comments at the NIO meeting on 20 May,
 I would appreciate any guidance you can provide on where you
 think the Key Judgments section of the Sino-Soviet Estimate might
 be expanded to reflect more fully the language of the text.   At
 Dick Lehman's suggestion, I would propose to insert appropriate
 phraseology from the text (which has already been agreed upon by
 the representatives) to insert in the Key Judgments.  In this
 way a further meeting of the representatives might be avoided.
 2.   If this procedure is not feasible, it will probably be
 necessary to convene another meeting of representatives to review
 once again the Key Judgments section.

 Chairman, National Intelligence Council
 25X1
 National Intelligence Officer for

 SUBJECT               PRC Meeting on the Situation in South Korea
 1.   Action Requested:   Review talking points and related materials
 covering matters to be discussed at the PRC meeting scheduled for
 22 May at 1600 hours.
 2.   Background: The meeting, which will be chaired by State,
 has been convened to discuss:
 o  ~v'hat are realistic objectives for us to pursue in
 relation to the current ROK political situation?
 e  How can we best use our leverage?
 General Jones will brief on the military situation and the North Korean
 threat, and you are scheduled to brief on current developments in
 South Korea.  As you know, the serious confrontation between the South
 Korean military leadership and student demonstrations which we
 anticipated in our Alert Memorandum of 9 May (Tab D) has in fact taken
 place, and has led to the arrest by the military authorities of student

 resignation of the Cabinet to leave President Choi as the only
 civilian official presently functioning in the South Korean govern-
 ment.   The southern cities of Kwangju -- Kim Dae Chung's home area --
 has suffered a massive insurrection that has been raging out of
 control for over three days.          The military crackdown has at the minimum
 suspended indefinitely the process of political liberalization which
 had been under way following the assassination of President Park last
 October.  A major breakdown of governmental and military control
 over the country could also take place if rioting spreads.

 1. You will recall that at the 22 May PRC meeting, SECDEF
 and General Jones made frequent references to messages that had
 been received from General Wickham in Korea.   These messages are
 not being made available to CIA and we are therefore deprived of
 a significant source of information and considered judgment
 regarding developments in South Korea.
 2.   I believe it would be helpful in this situation that
 you talk with Secretary Brown, General Jones or General 'Tighe
 and ask them to release messages from General Wickham to us.
 We would of course keep them closely held.

 MEMORANDUM FOR:       Director of Central Intelligence
 Deputy Director for Central Intelligence
 Deputy Director for National Foreign Assessment
 National Intelligence Officer for Warning
 National Intelligence Officer for
 China-East Asia Pacific
 SUBJECT              Warning Assessment:   China-East Asia Pacific
 The following items were discussed by the Community
 Representatives at the 19 May Warning meeting.
 China
 1.  Analysts discussed the apparent contradictions between the
 recent speech of Hua Guofeng which contained criticism of material
 incentives, and a Peoples Daily article the following day defending
 such incentives in strongest terms.  While Hua's speech could have
 represented a. serious division among the leadership, most analysts
 considered it to be more of a personal position of Hua himself,
 who seems to be fighting a losing battle to stay in power.   Deng
 Xiaoping's reported decision to step down in August probably meant that
 he would be taking Hua with him, too, and Hua is "going out with a
 whimper."  The question of incentives would be addressed at the
 forthcoming NPC session according to Vice Premier Zhao Ziyang, but
 there was no reason to believe that present policy lines would be
 reversed even though there were clearly those at lower levels who
 opposed material rewards for production increases.

 2.   On Chinese foreign policy, analysts believe that the
 Chinese are presently quite concerned over their relations with
 the ASEAN countries, particularly the tendency among some of these
 countries -- Indonesia and Malaysia -- to seek out a negotiated
 settlement of the Kampuchean situation.   This may be why Deng
 Xiaoping spoke of accepting a phased Vietnam withdrawal from
 Kampuchea to a German reporter.   There was no question but that
 China is now in a more difficult situation then it was a year
 ago with respect to Vietnam and Kampuchea (see below)
 Indochina
 3.  Analysts did not believe that Vietnam intended to make
 any serious concessions with respect to Thai and the other ASEAN
 countries on troop withdrawal from Vietnam -- the reported VN
 willingness to withdraw some troops was regarded as a token
 gesture and possibly could be related to the practice that Hanoi
 followed in last year's rainy season in withdrawing some units
 back to Vietnam for refitting.   Vietnam Foreign Minister Thach's
 visit to Kuala Lumpur showed no real flexibility despite some
 reference to some troop withdrawals under "certain conditions."
 However, the Vietnamese apparently perceived the existence of
 differences among the ASEAN nations on ne otiations and were
 trying to exploit these differences.
 4.   The purge of the Lao Dong party currently conducted by
 the Vietnamese was not regarded as being particularly serious; the
 Vietnamese were evidently attempting to weed out cadres who were
 "good at war but no good at managing the economy."  The corrupt
 and inefficient were also targeted for elimination.  Nevertheless,
 the purge (which had begun in January) could pickup steam later
 this year as high-ranking party members became involved.  It was
 noted that party members of Chinese ethnic background were being
 6.  Within Kampuchea, analysts commented that the DK forces
 under Pol Pot had evidently developed plans for military operations
 during the rainy season, but no real action had yet occurred.
 However, the rainy season had not yet fully arrived.   The DK forces
 were evidently drawing food supply from UN stocks at the Thai border.
 Arms and equipment from Chinese sources appeared adequate.

 7.  Analysts observed that the Vietnamese were trying hard
 to provide a facade of a Kampuchean governmental structure under
 Heng Samrin, but were still not having much success.  Village
 committees had been set up in some areas of Kampuchea but lacked
 real authority and the only local governmental operations which
 functioned required active Vietnamese support.
 South Korea
 11.   Analysts were not surprised by the declaration of martial
 law in South Korea given the failure of the government's restrained
 approach to student demonstrations.   One analyst characterized General
 Chun Doo Hwan as having a seige mentality which made his strong
 reaction to the student's ultimatum and 22 May deadline predictable.
 It was generally agreed that Chun enjoyed strong support within the

 military for tougher action against the demonstrators and the
 establishment of martial law.  Indeed, a Defense Security Command
 Survey of senior military officers, which has come to light since
 our meeting, appears to back up that judgment.   There is probably
 a good deal less support among military officers for Chun's
 capitalizing on martial law to neutralizes in some cases wipe
 North Korea
 12.  North Korean I&W anomalies were noted, but they were
 thought not to be significant, even in combination in suggesting
 the North was preparing for an attack.

 Korea, the US, and Western Europe/Japan
 I.  Recent events in ROK -- student riots, martial law, Kwangju bloodshed, trend
 away from political liberation and toward a possible military
 dictatorship -- add yet another significant area of tension
 to troubled world scene.   US unavoidably drawn in due to our
 military presence in ROK, 35-year history of close relationship
 with successive ROK governments, commitment to defense against
 North Korean attack.
 II.   Western (including Japanese) concern and relationship derives
 from several considerations
 -- Security, i.e., possibility of hostilities if NK attempts
 to exploit current disarray in the South by launching a
 military attack.   (Due to proximity, Japan particularly
 concerned, and Ohira expressed such fears to visiting PRC
 Premier Hua Guofeng on first day of Hua's visit.          Hua
 said NK would not attack.)
 -- Related issue is that EC and Japan have very large invest-
 ments in ROK, which they stand to lose outright if the North
 attacks.  We also have a very heavy economic stake.    Break-
 down is as follows:

 -- Even if NK exercises restraint, continued political unrest
 in ROK deriving from resistance by student groups,
 intellectuals, the Church, etc. to martial law, moves by
 General Chun Tu Hwan to establish military dictatorship
 and one-man rule, could undercut ROK's "economic miracle"
 and discourage further foreign loans, investments.
 ?  ROK already facing serious economic difficulties prior
 to present crisis:   GNP growth only 3-4% p.a.  (vice 1971-79
 average of 9.9%); inflation running at 25%.  Wage
 increases granted as result of wave of strikes last April
 could push inflation to 30%.
 -- As a result, foreign banking consortia are now seriously
 considering holding back on further development loans.
 But absence of such loans could further exacerbate ROK
 economic strains and add to political tensions.   (Labor
 groups have not joined with students in present situation,
 but might if economic conditions worsen.)
 III.   Western Europe and Japan will inevitably look to US to assist
 in maintaining ROK's political stability and economic progress.
 -- Most importantly, our military responses to the potential
 NK threat will be carefully scrutinized as to adequacy.
 -- We will be expected to apply leverage on General Chun and
 his military colleagues to exercise moderation; restore unity,
 and not stand in way of political liberalization.
 -- We will also be expected to do what we can to safeguard the
 economic stake which WE and Japan have in ROK.
 ?  Our own bankers will also be watching us closely for
 signs that we are playing a positive role with respect
 to ROK economic developments.  If we falter, they will
 cut back.
 -- Our problem is, however, that given our defense commitment
 to the ROK our leverage over General Chun and his colleagues
 is not great.  Our friends. and allies may not understand. this.
