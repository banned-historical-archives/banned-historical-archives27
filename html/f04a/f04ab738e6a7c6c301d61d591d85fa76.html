 C tmmunist military forces and insurgents are now on the offensive in
 areas the~ ughout Indochina. The Cambodian Government has been giving
 ground in''~he face of expanding Communist drives not only in many areas of
 the country .fast of the Mekong River, but also in some areas in the west and
 north. There\s no evidence that allied operations along the South Viet-
 namese - Cambodian border have seriously impeded greater Communist
 activity in the e nbodian interior. The Djakarta conference on Cambodia
 (16-17 May), whd e participants generally are pro-Western, will probably
 offer little more thaw, moral encouragement to the Phnom Penh government.
 A number of indictors suggest that North Vietnam intends a tough
 response to US policy inntndochina. Xuan Thuy, Hanoi's top negotiator in
 Paris, has left for home, al. Viet Cong delegate Madame Binh may leave
 soon. Further, North Vietnatpese party first secretary Le Duan's unusually
 warm reception in Peking, after his cool send-off from Moscow, strongly
 implies that Hanoi has reached policy decisions that are in keeping with
 Peking's hard-line approach.
 In South Vietnam the Communists have increased their attacks in the
 northern provinces and have shelled Stdgon and several other government
 centers farther south. These Communist, raids come at a time when the
 Saigon government appears under increasingg,, strain in carrying out its day-to-
 day duties, and when a political crisis is buif ing. Prime Minister Khiem may
 be on the way out after less than a year in office.
 The Communists in Laos have been concentiting their offensive efforts
 on clearing government forces from the southeastern edge of the Bolovens
 Plateau. The recent upsurge of Communist activity',kin South Laos has begun
 to rattle government leaders, and the Communists  e playing on the pes-
 simism within government ranks by circulating rumors t4 at certain provincial
 capitals in the south will soon be attacked.
 Communist guerrilla operations are also on the rise in -the northern and
 mid-South regions of Thailand. The security situation has deteriorated
 especially along the northern border with Laos. The Thai Gi ernment has
 had some success in joint operations with Malaysia against Ma ysian Com-
 munists based in southern Thailand, however. Several insurgent camps have
 been uprooted.                                               _
 The anniversary of last year's communal riots in Malaysia passed  most
 without incident this week. Stringent government security measures\pre-
 vented any serious trouble. Nevertheless, two Chinese died. as a resultlof
 Malay-initiated incidents, and the country remains a racial tind
 box.

 CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT SUFFERS MORE MILITARY SETBACKS
 Communist operations are
 keeping Cambodian Army troops off
 balance and restricting the gov-
 ernment's overland access to its
 eastern, northern, and southern
 provinces.   Communist inroads in
 these provinces, as well as else-
 where, indicate that allied opera-
 tions along the South Vietnam bor-
 der have not impeded greater Com-
 munist activity in the Cambodian
 interior.
 Phnom Penh appears to be
 growing more concerned over the
 deteriorating situation in Kom-
 pong Cham Province, where Commu-
 nist forces reportedly have been
 moving westward in recent weeks.
 Enemy troops have attacked sev-
 eral towns in the province and
 have cut roads and telephone wires.
 In the adjacent province of Kratie,
 whose capital was captured by the
 Communists on 6 May, local reports
 claim some Communist forces are
 moving north toward Stung Treng
 Province, but thus far no major
 attacks have been reported in
 that area.
 In the south, the Communists
 are still surrounding and attack-
 ing the towns of Angtassom and
 Takeo, and they also have cut the
 main roads north and south of the
 two towns.   In Kampot Province,
 the government still holds the
 provincial capital, but scattered
 enemy attacks have been reported
 along the coast.   Increased Commu-
 nist activity was also reported in
 Kompong Speu Province, where the
 closure of the main road between
 Phnom Penh and the key seaport of
 Kompong Som (Sihanoukville)  appar-
 ently is the primary objective of
 Communist forces there.
 The Communists suffered one
 significant military reverse during
 the week, however, when South Viet-
 namese Marines regained control of
 the Neak Luong ferry south of Phnom
 Penh.   Western journalists reported
 that some North Vietnamese Army
 troops were among enemy casualties.
 It is doubtful that the Cambodians
 can hold this position without the
 continuing presence of South Viet-
 namese forces.
 In Peking, meanwhile, Sihanouk
 has postponed his return to Cam-
 bodia.   He said during a recent
 television interview there that
 "resistance fighters" in Cambodia
 had told him to wait for better
 conditions before joining them.
 In a message addressed to his
 "army," Sihanouk said he was en-
 trusting the management of "lib-
 erated areas" to three leftist
 ministers of his recently formed
 "Royal Government of National
 Union" who he claimed were already
 in Cambodia.
 On the political front, Phnom
 Penh and Bangkok have agreed to re-
 sume full diplomatic and commercial
 relations, and it appears likely
 that the Lon Nol government will
 soon follow suit with Saigon.   Hanoi
 and the Viet Cong have decided to
 withdraw their few remaining dip-
 lomats in Phnom Penh.   They did not,
 however, follow the Chinese Commu-
 nist example and announce a formal
 break in relations.

 VIETNAM
 After its initial temporizing
 and indecision in the wake of US
 actions in Indochina, Hanoi has
 now begun to take a stand.   The
 Communists recalled their top
 negotiator Xuan Thuy from Paris
 on 11 May, and Viet Cong delegate
 Madame Binh is expected to leave
 later this month.   Some Communist
 staffers will probably continue
 to attend the weekly sessions,
 but the Communists obviously do
 not expect worthwhile negotiations
 in this forum for some time.  Hanoi
 has also underscored its rejection
 of recent proposals for wider con-
 sultations on all of Indochina.
 Moscow's treatment of North
 Vietnamese party first secretary
 Le Duan when he departed after
 three weeks of high-level talks
 with the Soviets on 9 May sug-
 gests that Hanoi has opted for
 a tough stance.   The atmospherics
 surrounding his departure intimate
 that Moscow--which has always
 counseled moderation--was ex-
 tremely displeased with the line
 Hanoi has chosen to follow.   TASS
 described Le Duan's discussions
 with Brezhnev as merely an "ex-
 change of opinions on Indochina,"
 and the Vietnamese leader was al-
 lowed to depart without any ges-
 ture of support or any formal
 farewell ceremonies.
 Whatever decisions Hanoi has
 made obviously have been well re-
 ceived in Peking.   Instead of
 ignoring Le Duan, as has fre-
 quently been the case in the past,
 Mao Tse-tung,  Lin Piao,  and a host
 of other leading military and
 party figures turned out to wel-
 come him when he arrived.   The
 implication is strong that the
 North Vietnamese have moved in
 a direction that will bring in-
 creased material and political
 support from China for their
 policy in Cambodia.

 reform or rectify such regime
 malpractices is pending.   Because
 the Saigon government has a large
 stake in preserving the forms of
 constitutional government, partic-
 ularly now that it is under in-
 tense pressure from a number of
 hostile sources, it will be hard
 put not to abide by the court's
 rulings.
 Meanwhile, both student and
 An Quang Buddhist leaders have
 taken steps to control their an-
 tigovernment agitation in order
 to avoid further suppression by
 the regime.   The students report-
 edly have initiated a three-day
 truce in demonstrations in Saigon
 following the government's ban on
 disruptive meetings and demon-
 strations.   While Saigon schools
 are closed, however, some student
 activists have gone to other ci-
 ties to help organize student pro-
 tests.   Although the An Quang
 leadership holds the government
 responsible for its clash with
 rival Buddhists, they have ad-
 vised the faithful to heed only
 the directives of a moderate An
 Quang spokesman and not the calls
 to action of younger, more mili-
 tant monks.
 The government has been
 thrown further off balance by
 recent Supreme Court rulings
 striking down tax decrees of the

 Meanwhile, in South Vietnam,
 the Communists have increased
 their attacks in the northern
 provinces and shelled Saigon
 and several other government cen-
 ters farther south.   Communist
 sappers and artillerymen attacked
 numerous targets in southern I
 Corps, including a thrust into
 the provincial capital of Tam
 Ky that caused heavy casualties
 and damages.   Sporadic heavy
 fighting between allied units and
 North Vietnamese regulars also
 continues in and around the
 large Hiep Duc refugee center
 south of Da Nang.
 It appears likely that the
 Communists intended the recent at-
 tacks to be a country-wide effort
 similar to the upsurge in early
 April, but enemy units located
 in the southern half of the coun-
 try could not participate as
 planned because of their preoc-
 cupation with allied raids into
 their rear base areas in Cambodia.

 COMMUNIST OFFENSIVE STILL. FOCUSING ON SOUTH LAOS
 The Communists have again cap-
 tured the principal artillery base
 overlooking Attopeu town as they
 continue trying to clear government
 forces from the southeastern edge
 of the Bolovens Plateau.   Govern-
 ment guerrillas remain in the area,
 however, and are regrouping in an
 effort to retake the position.
 The recent upsurge of Commu-
 nist military activity in the south
 has begun to rattle government lead-
 ers.   King Savang has instructed
 the chief of the armed forces to
 hold the Bolovens Plateau at all
 costs.   Such admonitions usually
 have little effect on the army's
 performance, but they do reflect
 the concern of the top leadership.

 The Communists appear to be
 capitalizing on the pessimism within
 government ranks.   Employing pres-
 sure that is more psychological than
 military, they are circulating re-
 ports that the provincial capital
 of Saravane and Paksong will soon
 be hit.   The.government announced
 that the threat to Saravane neces-
 sitated the evacuation of depend-
 ents, and by 12 May it had resettled
 some 2,700 civilians in the Mekong
 town of Pakse.                         25X1
 reports
 of substantial new enemy                   orces con-
 verging on Saravane remain uncon-
 firmed, but it is estimated that
 the Communists have upwards of
 1,000 troops in the area.   The Sar-
 avane garrison numbers less than
 600 army, police, and armed civil-
 ian personnel, and it is expected
 to fall quickly if the Communists
 apply even light pressure.
 In the north the military sit-
 uation remains quiet.   The absence
 of a major Communist move against
 Long Tieng in recent weeks has given
 a needed boost to the morale of the
 Meo defenders.   Civilians have be-
 gun to filter back into the Long
 Tieng Valley, and the base hospital
 has reopened.
 Vang Pao has positioned almost
 1,300 troops in the hills immedi-
 ately north of Tha Tam Bleung and
 has plans to push north into an
 enemy staging area near Ban Na.   The
 guerrillas may run into considerable
 opposition if they move this way,
 however.   The North Vietnamese have
 been rotating fresh troops into for-
 ward positions near Ban Na.

 THAI COMMUNIST INSURGENTS INCREASE ACTIVITY
 Communist guerrilla opera-
 tions, which have been moderate
 so far thip dry season, are on
 the increas'-e.   The major threat
 remains in tke remote north and
 north-central,,provinces, where
 a force of som  1,600 insurgents
 continues to erode the govern-
 ment's positions along the Lao
 border.   The security situation
 is especially bad ia. portions of
 Nan and Chiang Rai provinces,
 where guerrillas have'Iiarassed
 several army outposts,'gorcing
 the evacuation of at least one.
 Bangkok has sought to  ase
 guerrilla pressure by the hevy
 use of air and artillery strikes.
 An army sweep operation last math
 into an insurgent stronghold nea\
 the Lao border in eastern Nan
 Province met with disastrous re-
 sults, however.   The guerrillas
 shot down two government heli-
 copters besides managing to over-
 run several government base camps
 and inflicting a number of casual-
 ties on Thai regulars.   The op-
 eration was sparked by a growing
 number of reports that the-insur-
 gents were trying to seize and
 administer whole village6 in this
 region.
 The security suation is
 more favorable in    e northeast,
 where the Communists are still
 on the defensive.   The enemy's
 much-heralded dry-season offen-
 sive has not materialized, a de-
 velopment that may further under-
 mine the wavering morale of many
 rank-and-file guerrillas, as well
 as the appeal of the insurgency
 to villagers.   Guerrilla incidents
 involving the assassination of in-
 formants and ambushes of local
 security teams remain endemic to
 the northeast region, however.

 mid-South region have sharply in-

 ILO FACES SUCCESSION PROBLEM
 The retirement of US citi-
 zen David Morse after 22 years
 as directoi-general of the Inter-
 national LabQr Organization  (ILO)
 has led to a hot, four-way con-
 test over the succession.   The
 ILO's governing board presumably
 will elect one of  the  four an-
 nounced candidates at next week's
 special session, and the outcome
 could have considerable impact on
 both the direction and efficiency
 of ILO operations.
 The ILO was founded in 1919
 under terms of Part XIII of thi
 Versailles Treaty.   Seeking to
 improve conditions of labor by
 international cooperation and
 agreement,  the ILO is based on
 the so-called tripartite pri  i-
 ple--i.e., the representativ s
 on the policy-making insti  tions
 are selected by the emplo ers,
 workers, and member Bove nments.
 In recent years    e princi-
 pal thrust of the ILc  s work has
 been directed at th  problems of
 the less developeq/countries.
 Last year,  for ex&mple,  the ILO
 launched the Word Employment
 Program to encourage ILO members
 to make their-national develop-
 ment programs" provide work oppor-
 tunities and adequate incomes for
 a broader stratum of their popu-
 lations.-The Soviets have also
 taken a--greater interest in ILO
 affairs recently, seeking higher
 positions in the ILO staff but at-?
 tacking the tripartite principle.
 The leading candidate to suc-?
 ceed Morse is his chief deputy,
 C, W. Jenks of the UK, who has
 been with the ILO since 1931.
 In view of Jenks'  age, many gov-
 erning board members"favor his
 election only to complete the
 balance of Morse'.` term, which

 chard's age would permit him
 accept re-election to a full
 en-year term in 1973, and the
 French also argue that it is time
 for the promotion of a "Latin"
 candidate after the lengthy ten-
 ure of the "Anglo-Saxon" Morse.
 Two candidates have emerged
 rom the less developed regions.
 A,tthird Morse deputy, Albert
 Ted odjre of Dahomey, recently
 annonced his interest in the
 positkon.   African ILO members
 previotqs ly had been thinking in
 terms oi~, the 1973 election, but
 concern    at someone other than
 Jenks migh%     selected now has
 prompted an acceleration of
 Teveodjre'sandidacy.
 A fourth c ndidate, Uruguay's

 Espiell, like Tev odjre, prob-
 ably would seek to.ocus ILO ac-
 tivity to an even giVater extent
 on the less develope  regions.

 point, but it will opt foZ the  25X1

 YUGOSLAV PI,,--TY LEADERSHIP TIGHTENS DISCIPLINE
 The Yugoslav party prasiccium
 seems to believe its programs may
 be headed for trouble, especially
 because of opposition within the
 party bureaucracy.      At a meeting
 on 22 April, the presidium adopted
 a resolution calling for the re-
 juvenation of party discipline
 in an effort to motivate the whole
 population to identify with the
 country's controversial self-man-
 agement system.   Under this sys-
 tem, councils are elected by the
 workers and given the power to
 manage their enterprise's own af-
 fairs.
 The presidium's action is
 partly an attempt to breathe new
 life into the "liberal" resolu-
 tions and statutes adopted at
 the 9th party congress in March
 1969.   These provided for the
 opening of party jobs to better
 qualified young people as a part
 of the process of  revitalizing
 the party leadership.   Following
 the invasion of Czechoslovakia,
 party decisions were readily ac-
 cepted as a wave of patriotic
 fervor swept the federation.   The
 momentum of those days is now
 gone,  and there is once again a
 general recognition that party
 members must ensure that the ac-
 cepted party line is incorporated
 in the decisions of the self-man-
 agement councils.
 management system" by Yugoslavs
 both in and out of the party.
 There is even suspicion among
 some leaders that the Soviets are
 behind this dissidence.   The presid-
 ium  resolution is aimed at such

 that everyone take a stand.   Neu-
 trality will not be tolerated.
 Specifically, the presidium
 is intent on ensuring that uncom-
 mitted members be rotated out of
 party jobs and that the economic
 reforms be reoriented to lessen
 the gap between the rich and poor
 regions of Yugoslavia.   In addi-
 tion, the party leadership is in-
 terested in fostering an expansion
 of self-management under enlight-
 ened party guidance, and in a
 democratization of the party's
 reorganization and its manner of

 Although unity is the key-

 SOVIET SHIPS VISITING FOREIGN PORTS
 Ships of the Soviet Navy
 have been making a number of for-
 eign port calls since the conclu-
 sion of exercise "Ocean" earlier
 this month.
 The latest good-will visit
 began on 14 May when two anti-
 submarine ships and two diesel
 submarines arrived at Cienfuegos,
 Cuba.   These units, which had
 been operating in the Caribbean
 for a week, will use Cuban fa-
 cilities for replenishment.
 The ships and two TU-95
 naval reconnaissance aircraft
 that flew from the USSR to Havana
 on 13 May may conduct additional
 operations with a nuclear-powered
 cruise missile submarine sighted
 south of Cuba yesterday.   Some
 of these operations may take place
 in the Gulf of Mexico.   TU-95s
 provide reconnaissance and tar-
 get information to missile-armed
 ships in Soviet naval exercises
 and may do so for these ships if
 they conduct missile exercises.
 A similar group of ships that op-
 erated in the Caribbean in 1969
 had no aerial support.
 A small squadron from the
 Baltic Fleet recently concluded
 a five-day visit to Cherbourg,
 France, to commemorate VE day.
 Similar courtesy visits were
 made to Algiers and Casablanca,
 and on 13 May two guided-missile
 ships and a tanker called at the
 Nigerian port of Lagos.
 Exercise "Ocean," followed
 by such a high number of foreign
 port visits, reflects Moscow's
 continuing effort  to demonstrate
 the world-wide political and mil-
 itary utility of the Soviet Navy.
 USSR BECOMES AN EFFLUENT SOCIETY
 The Soviets are becoming
 aware that environmental problems
 are in inevitable concomitant of
 industrial development and that
 their economic system is not im-
 mune to these problems.   The re-
 cent drafting of water-pollution
 legislation and a willingness to
 participate in international meet-
 ings on the environment illus-
 trate their growing concern.   Al-
 though their pollution problems
 are not yet as serious as those
 of the industrial West, solutions
 will not come easy.
 In the past, the Soviet lead-
 ership has been relatively unre-
 sponsive to the pleas  of conser-
 vationists.   An example is the
 12-year battle to save the unique
 flora and fauna of Lake Baikal
 from destruction by pollution
 from wood-pulp mills. A decree
 finally adopted last year for-
 bids logging in much of the area
 and requires lumber enterprises
 to install purification equip-
 ment.
 A Soviet agriculture offi-
 cial recently claimed that the
 government's failure to pursue a
 coordinated conservation policy
 has resulted in "immense" damage
 to the country's natural re-sources.

 Here we are trying to breed fish in conditions

 He accused the government of ig-
 noring wind and water erosion,
 water pollution by industrial
 and municipal waste, overcutting
 of forests, excessive use of chem-
 cials in agriculture, and air pol-
 lution.
 Press articles have identi-
 fied water pollution as the coun-
 try's most critical environmental
 problem.   Pollution of the Volga
 and the Caspian Sea, a result of
 offshore oil drilling and con-
 tamination by shipping and indus-
 trial sewage, threatens to wipe
 out the caviar-producing sturgeon
 Irrigation projects and hydroelec-
 tric dams also have caused the
 water levels of the Caspian and
 Aral seas to drop, raising their
 salinity and destroying plant and
 animal life.
 The most recent evidence of
 government action to stop this
 environmental mismanagement is a
 draft law to protect lakes and
 rivers from pollution.   Violators
 will be liable to prosecution,
 and authorities will be able to
 shut down the polluting facili-
 ties.   Various officials have
 urged that a comprehensive con-
 servation program be included in
 the upcoming five-year plan  (1971-
 75).   On the international front,
 the Soviets have participated in
 various ecological conferences and
 are currently helping to plan a
 global network of stations
 equipped to monitor changes in
 the earth's environment.
 The Soviets traditionally
 have been good at launching cam-
 paigns but less successful in
 their effective implementation.
 Cleaning up polluted areas and
 preventing further pollution
 would require tremendous alloca-
 tions of resources.   Competition
 over resources is already keen,
 with the military, agriculture,
 industry, and the consumer con-
 stantly fighting for larger al-
 locations.   The antipollution
 forces are probably too weak and
 unorganized to get even a finger
 in the pie.
 Furthermore, enterprise man-
 agers are unlikely to sacrifice
 fulfillment of production targets
 in order to introduce antipollu-
 tion technology.   Finally, the
 slow development of and the dif-
 fusion of innovations, largely the
 reasons for the USSR's present
 technological lag behind the West,
 will also retard antipollution
 technology.

 ISRAEL MAKES STRONG MILITARY THRUST INTO LEBANON
 An Israeli armored force--
 probably no larger than two bat-
 talions at the most--made a heavy
 foray into the southeastern Leba-
 nese districts of Marjayoun and
 Hasibayyah early on 12 May.   The
 action followed a marked step-up
 in activity during the previous
 week by Lebanese-based Arab guer-
 rilla units against Israeli border
 communities,  climaxed by the kill-
 ing of four civilians in the set-
 tlement of Qiryat Shemona.   The
 Israeli strike came after several
 warnings to the Beirut government
 and to the fedayeen of imminent
 retaliation if the terrorist ac-
 tivity was not halted.
 Tel Aviv has given only
 scanty details of the operation,
 but has  flatly denied Arab and
 fedayeen claims of heavy fighting
 and large numbers of casualties.
 Israeli officials have sought--
 perhaps for image-making pur-
 poses--to depict the foray as a
 limited one aimed at capturing
 some guerrillas and destroying
 their bases.   They described the
 action as both a "combing" and a
 "screening" operation.   An Israeli
 spokesman said that 30 guerrillas
 had been killed,  11 taken pris-
 oner,                 and some vehicles and 40
 buildings destroyed.  These numbers
 seem light: in an area believed to
 contain 1,500 to 2,000  fedayeen.
 The fedayeen themselves claim they
 resisted valiantly and success-
 fully,  and the Israelis have ad-
 mitted by implication that they
 Page 2 1
 met more resistance than was ex-
 pected.
 Lebanese communiques   on the
 other hand, made no reference to
 fedayeen involvement in the foray.
 Lebanon publicly and privately
 claimed that it engaged the Is-
 raeli force with its own army,
 destroyed some Israeli tanks,  and 25X1
 suffered casualties.
 Syria made a token show of
 support for the fedayeen--and
 lost three MIG-17s in the proc-
 ess.                                                               Other Arab states, while
 giving strong vocal support,
 stayed clear of the Israeli force.
 Iraqi artillery in Jordan shelled
 Israeli positions along the bor-
 der, but Iraqi forces did not
 enter the fighting in Lebanon.
 President Nasir's contribution
 was to send his army chief of
 staff to Beirut with a message
 for President Hilu.
 Lebanon has officially ac-
 cused Israel of escalating ten-
 sions along the border and of
 using isolated fedayeen incidents
 as a pretext for aggressive pur-
 poses.                                                               n a mPPting with.-..the

 FEDAYEEN GROUPS FORM NEW COORDINATING BODY
 The 11 major fedayeen organ-
 izations announced on 6 May the
 formation of a new central com-
 mittee within the structure of the
 Palestine Liberation Organization
 (PLO).   Membership will include
 the PLO Executive Committee,  the
 chairman of the Palestine National
 Council, the Palestine Liberation
 Army commander, and representa-
 tives of the various fedayeen
 groups as well as of a number of
 independent,  nonmilitary Palestin-
 ian organizations.   The unified
 military command, set up in Amman
 last February, will be dissolved
 and its functions will be absorbed
 by the new committee, which is to
 determine common military and po-
 litical policies.
 According to an unconfirmed
 Syrian press report, the 11 feda-
 yeen organizations are to be al-
 lotted one seat each on the new
 committee.   If this is true,  it
 represents a concession to the
 head of the Popular Front for the
 Liberation of Palestine,   George
 Habbash, and other leaders who
 have refused to join any such uni-
 fied grouping unless each organi-
 zation had equal representation.
 This insistence on collegiality
 stems from fears that any other
 system would lead to eventual dom-
 ination by Fatah.   Since Fatah
 first gained control of the Pal-
 estine Liberation Organization in
 February 1969, it has in fact
 sought to do just that.
 Acceptance of the equal rep-
 resentation arrangement by Fatah
 would be something of a blow to
 Yasir Arafat's pre-eminent posi-
 tion.
 Fatah,
 o  course,  retains contr o of both
 the Palestine National Council and
 the Palestine Liberation Organiza-
 tion's Executive Committee,                                                                               and
 may seek to make the new central
 committee subservient to these
 other entities.
 This would be opposed by Hab-
 bash and the leaders of the other
 organizations, who will probably
 attempt to use the central com-
 mittee as a collegiate grouping
 that would act as a  counterweight
 to the two bodies already con-
 trolled by Fatah.   Moreover, the
 statement issued by the fedayeen
 when they announced the formation
 of the central committee under-
 scored the fact that the new body
 is to play "the command role in
 the resistance movement."
 The coming months could there-
 fore see the emergence of a col-
 lective leadership in the fedayeen
 movement and the gradual eclipse
 of Yasir Arafat.   The possibility
 remains, however, that the new
 body will be merely another paper
 organization and that each feda-
 yeen group will continue to go
 its own way, cooperating when it
 is to the group's advantage: and
 disregarding anythin   considered
 disadvantageous.

 RELIGIOUS REACTIONARIES PROTEST IN AFGHANISTAN
 In sharp contrast with the
 agitation for progessive reform
 troubling many countries, Afghan-
 istan is currently experiencing
 demonstrations by ultraconserva-
 tive religious elements opposing
 the government's cautious program
 of social and political change.
 Afghanistan's Muslim elders--
 the mullahs--have long disapproved
 of King Zahir's efforts to nudge
 his kingdom into the twentieth
 century.   Their discontent has
 been fed by periodic leftist
 street  disorders in Kabul and by
 the government's indecisive and
 ineffective response to the "rab-
 ble."  Nevertheless, since 1929--
 when they helped topple a previous
 regime in Kabul--the mullahs have
 rarely given vent to their dis-
 pleasure with the government.
 Their sporadic, localized out-
 bursts of violence in outlying
 areas have been handled fairly
 easily by the authorities.
 The election last fall, how-
 ever, returned a parliament more
 conservative and more rurally
 oriented than its predecessor,
 and the mullahs may have inter-
 preted this as a go-ahead to carry
 their protests to Kabul.   Govern-
 ment cooperation with the Soviet
 Union on the Lenin centenary cele-
 bration in Afghanistan in late
 April provided the specific oc-
 casion for mass demonstrations.
 The mullahs' demands ranged from
 suspension of a leftist newspaper
 to a ban on women appearing in
 public without the veil.   Rumors
 abounded that elements in the gov-
 ernment had initially encouraged
 the demonstrations in order to
 balance leftist protests but that
 the situation had then gotten out
 of hand.
 As mullahs from the provinces
 began moving toward Kabul, offi-
 cials voiced fears that they might
 clash with leftists celebrating
 May Day.   Security precautions
 in the capital were the heaviest
 in recent history, the authori-
 ties being fully aware that, in
 this devoutly religious country,
 melees involving the mullahs are
 far more explosive than other
 disturbances.
 The mullahs relinquished the
 streets to the leftists on May
 Day, but subsequently resumed
 their protests.   Tensions began
 to lessen, however, when it ap-
 peared that the government had
 reached an agreement with the
 mullahs.
 Moreover, the crisis is tak-
 ing its toll.   Executive-legisla-
 tive relations have been exacer-
 bated by the refusal of the prime
 minister and his cabinet to ap-
 pear before the Lower House for
 questioning, and rumors are cir-
 culating that the government may
 fall.   Leftists are again demon-
 strating, which could provoke
 further clerical reaction. Most
 importantly, the mullahs have re-
 minded the government that they
 still exercise real political
 power.   Official policy over the
 next few months will be shaped
 with this very much in mind.

 IRAN TAKING NEW LOOK AT KURDISH SITUATION
 The peace concluded on 11 March
 between the Baathist government of
 Iraq and the rebelling Kurds has
 forced Iran.into a re-evaluation of
 its relations with the tribesmen.
 The Iranians are aware that previous
 agreements reached by the Iraqis and
 Kurds since 1945-..:have resulted in
 nothing but renew4d hostility.   How-
 ever,  the Iranian 1clief that the
 Soviet union was ins\rumental in the
 present settlement has now added a
 new and--for Iran--a si1ister facet
 to the problem.
 Some high-level Iranis be-
 lieve that the announced agement
 c
 ti
 ons
 tutes merely a cease-fi'te,
 and that Kurdish distrust of the
 central government continues.      e
 to the Kurds tends to substantiate,
 thi
 th
 i
 s
 es
 s.  A number of Iranians,
 however,  interpret the cease-fire
 as creating in effect two autono-
 mous sections of Iraq,  and the im-
 plications of this are causing worry
 in Tehran.
 Although the role played by the
 USSR is still unclear, the Iranians
 are extremely suspicious of Soviet
 motives and believe that the Rus-
 sians have promised to assist the
 Kurds in forming an independent state
 that would include Iranian Kurdistan.
 This independent Kurdistan would re-
 ceive Soviet economic and military
 aid, they fear, and would eventually
 come under Soviet control.   The Iran-
 ians have a vivid memory of the Kurd-
 ish Mahabal Republic of 1946 that,
 Page
 supported but not spo         by Mos-
 cow, appeared for a  ime capable of
 maintaining its in ependence.
 The Irania s are particularly
 jumpy because   f the possibility
 that Baghdad  ill use the Iraqi Kurds
 could als `yutilize exiled former
 u~
 SAVAK chef Telmur Bakhtiar's knowl-
 edge   9t Iran's security organiz-
 ations`to initiate insurgent oper-
 aticzs in several isolated Iranian
 presvinces.  Tehran's nervousness is
 evidenced by its recent,  continu-
 ng military build-up in this area.
 Despite his agreement with the
 Iraqis, Kurdish rebel leader Bar-
 zani continues to express sincer-
 ity and loyalty to the Iranians,
 Iranian aid to Barzani's forces
 has been halted, however,  and con-
 tact is being maintained only at a
 low level.  Most Iranians have lost
 confidence in Barzani~
 W   le the Iranians are still
 in the    ocess of determining the
 amount a    kind of future aid,  if
 any, they   could provide, the
 Iraqi Kurds,they have begun to
 pull out vulrttrable personnel

 CUBA MAY ELIMINATE PRIVATE FARMS
 There are signs that the Cas-   j         More direct criticism of the
 tro regime is losing patience with
 the owners of small farms and may
 be contemplating action against
 them.   A desire for more effi-
 cient land management and dissat-
 isfaction  with the farmers' per-
 formance in the 1970 sugar har-
 vest seem to be the main reasons
 for the government's attitude.
 Any attempt to repossess the
 small farms, however, will prob-
 ably be engineered with considera-
 ble caution.   The farmers, who with
 their families number over a mil-
 lion, constitute an important seg-
 ment of the population, and the
 regime will probably have to
 sweeten the nationalization meas-
 ure with some type of compensation
 to avoid alienating such a key
 group. If the 200,000 small farms
 are nationalized, a few taxicabs
 and some coastal fishing boats
 will be the only remaining pri-
 vately owned enterprises in Cuba.
 Although the peasants in many
 areas have been continually reluc-
 tant to participate fully in the
 government's political campaigns
 and economic schemes, the first
 sign of official exasperation with
 small-farm owners was voiced by
 Fidel Castro during a speech in
 December 1969.   In discussing the
 mechanization of agriculture, Cas-
 tro complained that "small land-
 holding is not a proper method of
 exploiting the land; it is pre-
 historic.       .   It is not a na-
 tural method because small plot
 ownership is not consistent with
 technology.       . Modern technology
 and highly productive machinery
 require expanses of land."
 small-farm owners began to appear
 early this year when the provin-
 cial press and radio in Matanzas,
 Las Villas, and Oriente provinces
 laid partial blame for harvest pro-
 duction problems on the farmers
 and their poor attendance record
 in the canefields.   In one munic-
 ipality,   for example, only 50
 of the 200 peasants available
 showed up in the fields to cut
 cane.   One provincial party offi-
 cial cited poor preparatory politi-
 cal work by the government-con-
 trolled National Association of
 Small Farmers  (ANAP)  as the rea-
 son for the farmers'                                                             recalcitrant
 attitude.
 Government thinking may have
 been indicated last January when
 ANAP president Jose Ramirez headed
 an agricultural delegation to the
 USSR to study collective farms.
 In a speech Ramirez said,  "Al-
 though there have been great eco-
 nomic and sociopolitical changes
 among our peasants and rural work-
 ers, we must state that we are
 only beginning the transformation
 of our agriculture."
 The only positive action
 against the small-farm owners so
 far has occurred in the past. few
 Ives occ is being confiscated. If
 this practice draws only mild reac-
 tion, the government may make more
 drastic moves.   An indication of
 the government's policy may appear
 on 17 May, Peasant's Day, and the
 eleventh anniversary of Cuba's first
 agrarian reform law, or on 26 July,
 when Castro is expected to deliver
 a major speech. x

 CARIBBEAN GOVERNMENTS TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT BLACK POWER.-
 In the aftermath of the Trin-
 idad disorders last month, a ma-
 jority of the Caribbean governments
 are reassessing their public posi-

 adopting more stringent controls
 over its proponents.
 Many of the Caribbean leaders
 are concerned that events similar
 to those in Trinidad could disrupt
 the peace and prosperjty of their
 states if they permit militants to
 agitate and preach racial violence.
 There is general agreement that
 Trinidad's Prime Minister Williams
 waited too long before trying to
 exercise control over Black Power
 elements whose demonstrations 'and
 subsequent arrest led to the recent
 unrest.   As a result, the goveri

 Suharto, president of Indonesia for three years, will visit the United
 States officially and for the first time from 26 May to 2 June. He is expected
 to discuss the Cambodian situation and Southeast Asian affairs generally,
 and probably hopes to reach agreement on a modest military acquisitions
 program that has been under consideration for some weeks. He will express
 his appreciation of past US economic assistance, and, as a means of main-
 taining the so-far favorable climate in Washington toward aid to Indonesia,
 will talk with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and speak to the
 National Press Club.
 The 49-year-old Suharto has placed his stamp of caution and prag-
 matism on his administration. He has eased forward on a number of prob-
 lems while consistently maintaining priority on economic improvement.
 Indonesia under Suharto continues to make progress on the difficult tasks of
 economic rehabilitation and is preparing for national elections in mid-1971.
 The proscribed Communist Party, which remains under strong government
 pressure, is scattered and ineffective.
 Although ultimate government control is in the hands of the army,
 civilian participation is considerable and effective, particularly in the eco-
 nomic sector. The army considers it necessary to perpetuate its political role
 at least until economic recovery has been achieved, and will seek to do so in
 the coming elections and to reinforce its position with civilian alliances.
 Although Indonesia follows a nonaligned foreign policy, its interna-
 tional relations in recent years have been weighted toward the West, from
 which it receives critically needed financial assistance. Largely because of
 Indonesia's strongly anti-Communist domestic stance, relations with the
 USSR and Eastern Europe have been correct but cool in the post-Sukarno
 era; ties with China were suspended in 1967, and prospects for an early
 resumption of diplomatic relations are poor.
 Other than continuing negotiations for economic assistance with both
 non-Communist and Communist nations, Indonesia's principal international
 objective is to develop its influence in Southeast Asia. Major facets of this
 policy have been the founding and subsequent support of the five-member
 Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Djakarta's recent initiative that
 resulted in the scheduling of an Asian conference on Cambodia.

 Suharto's rise from poor boy to the top
 ranks of army and political leadership is still fairly
 unusual in Indonesia, yet not much attention is

 He cannot inspire the colorful copy that former

 with the rank of lieutenant colonel, and then
 began a steady and quietly distinguished rise in
 independent Indonesia. By 1963 Suharto had
 been appointed to the second most senior post in
 the army as head of the Strategic Command, a
 combat-ready strike force. It was logical that he
 should assume temporary leadership of the army
 when the Communists launched their abortive
 coup on the morning of 1 October 1965, kid-
 naping and later murdering army commander
 General Yani and five other generals.
 Suharto was born of humble parents in a
 Central Java village in 1921 and spent a childhood
 eventful chiefly for being shuttled from relative
 to relative after his parents' separation. In June
 1940, bored with his job as a bank clerk, Suharto
 volunteered for the Dutch colonial army, and
 remained in the armed forces under the Japanese.
 He fought effectively against the Dutch, emerged

 alternative but to install him as army commander
 and did so on 16 October 1965.
 As head of the developing new Indonesian
 leadership, Suharto believed that his major tasks
 during the following year and a half were to
 maintain the cohesiveness of the army, crush the
 large Communist Party, and so reduce President
 Sukarno's power and prestige that he could be
 quietly and peacefully removed from office. Su-
 harto accomplished all three objectives, the last in
 an elaborately phased program, which at the time
 was criticized by many of his supporters as need-
 lessly slow. Perhaps it could have been done more
 rapidly without disruptive consequences, but Su-
 harto's schedule gave him and his military and
 civilian colleagues time to sort out some of Indo-
 nesia's economic and political complexities and to
 ease the transition from the old order to the new.
 On 12 March 1967, the Indonesian Congress
 unanimously passed a decree declaring Sukarno
 "no longer capable" of fulfilling his presidential
 duties and naming General Suharto acting presi-
 dent. A year later, on 27 March, Congress elected
 him to a five-year term as full president.
 Suharto's initial image after the 1965 coup
 as a strong and resourceful albeit cautious leader
 has remained valid. He has shown strength and
 resourcefulness in dealing with the nation's urgent
 economic and security difficulties. In approaching
 the baffling problem of the domestic political
 situation, he has demonstrated cautiousness. The
 severe economic deterioration and the threat of
 Communist resurgence both demanded action,
 and these urgent requirements provided both a
 valid and a convenient rationale for imposing,
 until recently, a partial moratorium on political
 activity. Given the fragmented state of Indo-
 nesia's political party system, the task of charting
 the way toward a predominantly civilian govern-
 ment that would be representative, non-Com-
 Special Report
 munist, and still stable is indeed formidable. Su-
 harto's caution, which his critics see as needlessly
 stalemating the political situation, probably stems
 from a variety of reasons. These include a basic
 distrust of politicians, the need to feel his way,
 the priority given economic improvement, and
 the lack of a clear idea as to how to restructure
 and redirect the still-immature Indonesian party
 system from its present fragmented and parochial
 base to one along program-oriented lines.
 Suharto has made no effort to disguise the
 fact that the army is the major political force in
 Indonesia and his own chief support. He and his
 colleagues feel strongly that it is the only organi-
 zation capable of administering the country dur-
 ing this period of economic rehabilitation and
 political reorganization. It is the only cohesive,
 nationally organized group in the country, its
 loyalties are nationally focused, and with the
 passing of time, it has increasingly avoided the
 regional and ethnic divisions that afflict those
 civilian organizations aspiring to a national role.
 When General Suharto, then still commander
 of the army, assumed the presidency in March
 1967, the Indonesian Army achieved greater and
 more effective participation in government than
 ever before in its 25-year role of nation building.
 Although Suharto has since relinquished com-
 mand of the army, he remains the minister of
 defense and as such is commander in chief of the
 armed forces. In the 23-man cabinet the army
 holds three other portfolios, and the navy and air
 force hold one each. The military, particularly the
 army, is well represented in all departments at
 subministerial levels and in industrial and agricul-
 tural state enterprises. Army officers serve as gov-
 ernors in 14 of the nation's 26 provinces, and
 junior officers and noncommissioned officers
 hold a substantial proportion of subprovincial

 jobs down to the village level. Military appointees
 constitute 18 percent of the membership of par-
 liament and congress, and hold approximately
 half of the nation's ambassadorial posts.
 Suharto and the army uphold the doctrine
 of the military's "dual function": the military
 must participate actively in the nation's political
 and economic life, as well as provide its defense
 and security force. Politically, army leaders seek a
 middle road between what they regard as the
 "free-for-all" parliamentary democracy of the
 1950s and former president Sukarno's subsequent
 authoritarian rule. This middle way would permit
 significant popular participation but would retain
 a strong central leadership and a major political
 role for the army.
 In the economic sector, the army vigorously
 argues that economic improvement is a prerequi-
 site for political stability and a necessity in count-
 ering a future renascent Communist Party. Su-
 harto himself is an especially dedicated supporter
 of this line, but he has entrusted the formulation
 of economic policy not to the military but to a
 group of talented and well-trained nonparty ci-
 vilians.
 From the beginning of his leadership role in
 October 1965, Suharto has worked to develop a
 united military team and to eliminate interservice
 rivalries. Although the navy and air force are
 much smaller than the army (army-250,000,
 navy-48,000, air force-30,000), Suharto has con-
 sistently included the two smaller services in the
 military's national role.
 A military reorganization announced in Oc-
 tober 1969 and gradually being implemented pro-
 vides for centralized Department of Defense auth-
 ority over the three services and for an integrated
 command down to the provincial level. The chain
 of command runs from Suharto through six inte-
 Special Report
 grated theatre commands. The change increases
 Suharto's personal control over the armed forces
 and should make for a more flexible andrespon-
 sive instrument for carrying out the military's
 functions.
 In directing national life and interpreting the
 role of the military, Suharto has insisted on the
 observance of legal forms, has tried to listen to
 the civilian voice-although this effort is some-
 times obstructed by the military around him-and
 has displayed sensitivity to civilian charges of
 "creeping militarism" and corruption. These traits
 of sensitivity, caution, and tolerance have inclined
 Suharto to pursue a considerably more liberal
 administration than could have developed under
 more authoritarian military personalities on the
 scene. Although he is unwilling to diminish the
 army's ultimate authority-fearing any one of sev-
 eral results such as political instability, a turn
 toward an Islamic state, or Communist resur-
 gence-he nevertheless strongly believes that the
 military bears heavy responsibilities not to misuse
 its power and authority.
 For example, when students demonstrated
 against rising prices early this year, Suharto or-
 dered that not a shot be fired and that cabinet
 ministers meet with and answer the students'
 questions.  He  has  told  military  com-
 manders-who, because of Indonesia's economic
 predicament and budgeted funds, are compelled
 to engage in fund-raising activities for troop wel-
 fare-that these activities must be truly directed
 toward this purpose and not be "obstacles to
 national development." On the whole, his ap-
 proach to government indicates a continuing in-
 tention to avoid military authoritarianism yet to
 maintain the ascendency of the military as it
 guides the nation in achieving economic develop-
 ment and political modernization.

 Although the army is clearly predominant,
 civilians hold a number of important posts in the
 cabinet, bureaucracy, and legislature. Those hold-
 ing the more responsible positions, however, are
 nonparty technicians or individuals with little po-
 litical support. Political party members, who had
 hoped that the downfall of former president Su-
 karno would restore the parties to greater influ-
 ence, find that although they have a larger voice
 than during the last years of Sukarno's rule, their
 present position falls far short of aspirations.
 There are seventeen civilians, eight of whom
 are members of political parties, in the 23-man
 cabinet, and civilians predominate in the ap-
 pointed congress and parliament. Suharto has en-
 couraged these two bodies to carry out their
 constitutionally prescribed functions (congress
 makes policy and parliament legislates), and they
 have indeed from time to time provided a check
 on the executive. Suharto has urged the army to
 respect and support civilian officials in the prov-
 inces.
 At the same time, however, Suharto relies a
 great deal on a few military colleagues for advice
 on day-to-day affairs, a fact that tends to insulate
 him from civilian views other than those of the
 economists. The inefficiency of the bureaucracy,
 moreover, has caused Suharto to rely consider-
 ably on the army hierarchy for administrative
 assistance.
 Suharto shares the army's distrust of po-
 litical parties in general and, in particular, of
 Moslem parties, which account for a plurality of
 the electorate. This distrust stems from the na-
 tion's experience with parliamentary democracy
 (1949-1956), the parties' irresponsibility during
 those years, their concern for acquiring greater
 power rather than for achieving national goals,
 Special Report
 and the series of unstable coalition cabinets that
 characterized that period. The military's par-
 ticular negativism toward Moslems is rooted in its
 memory of the fanatical Darul Islam movement,
 which tried to establish a theocratic state by
 armed force for more than ten years before it was
 crushed. The army also remembers that the
 Masjumi, the modernist Moslem party dissolved in
 1960, supported the 1958 provincial revolt, an-
 other crisis that the Djakarta government had to
 settle by military force. Reinforcing these fears is
 the suspicion that all faithful Moslems, militant or
 not, want to replace Indonesia's secular society
 with a Moslem state. Of the three major parties in
 Indonesia-the Moslem Scholars (the party of
 traditional Moslems), the Indonesian Moslem
 Party (modernist and successor to the Masjumi),
 and the secular National Party, the army clearly
 prefers the secular Nationalists.
 The parties to a considerable extent have
 earned the army's lack of confidence. As organi-
 zations, they are poorly disciplined, indecisive,
 and unable to formulate a national program. They
 tend to be special-interest groups that are ethni-
 cally or religiously based. Although within the
 parties, particularly the Moslem Party, there are
 individuals who have a strong sense of national
 purpose, they have so far been unable to translate
 this into a program of action. The army's exclu-
 sion from leadership roles, of some of the very
 individuals in both the Moslem and National par-
 ties who might stimulate a healthier development,
 however, merely perpetuates the present stagnant,
 unproductive atmosphere pervading the parties.
 The army is currently trying to develop an
 organization of functional groups as another ci-
 vilian vehicle for political support for the Suharto
 regime. Functional groups (youth, intellectuals,
 labor, women) have long been an element of the
 Indonesian political scene, and the civilians in
 parliament theoretically are about evenly divided

 between functional group representatives and
 those of political parties. These groups have had
 many purposes over the years, but one of them
 consistently has been to give legislative support to
 the executive as a counter to opposition from the
 parties. The army's intended vehicle, the Joint
 Secretariat of Functional Groups (SEKBER
 GOLKAR), as presently constituted is a loosely
 coordinated group of organizations with no sig-
 nificant political experience. It is being reor-
 ganized, restaffed, and groomed to participate in
 the 1971 elections.
 Modernizing civilian groups, mostly compris-
 ing individuals unaffiliated with the political par-
 ties, see SEKBER GOLKAR as possibly offering
 the opening wedge for the restructuring of the
 political party system. If SEKBER GOLKAR can
 indeed be transformed into a political party, it
 could develop into a broadly based organization
 neither dependent on one region nor having only
 a narrow religious appeal. Its candidates would
 ideally run on a pragmatic platform of economic
 improvement and social progress. It is unlikely
 that in the year remaining before elections
 SEKBER GOLKAR can become a major party,
 but if it can develop even a small but firm base
 and a successful working relationship between the
 army and some nationally focused civilians, it will
 have achieved a good deal.
 PROGRAMS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS:.
 ECONOMY, SECURITY, POLITICS
 The primary domestic policies of the Su-
 harto administration are continued economic im-
 provement, the prevention of a Communist resur-
 gence, and movement toward representative,
 stable, non-Communist government. Given the ex-
 treme economic deterioration caused by Su-
 karno's economic excesses and neglect of basic
 needs, the Suharto administration has made im-
 pressive progress in pursuing these policies. The
 Special Report
 major achievement has been to bring the galloping
 inflation of the early post-Sukarno years to a halt.
 In April 1969, a modest five-year development
 program was launched. The program, which calls
 for an expenditure of roughly US 4.5 billion
 dollars, is small in terms of the nation's size and
 needs, but its goals were determined on the basis
 of Indonesia's capabilities and the estimated avail-
 ability of funds. The plan emphasizes agriculture,
 the achievement particularly of self-sufficiency in
 rice, improved transportation and communica-
 tions facilities, and public services.
 Although all recovery targeted for the first
 year of the plan was not achieved, some signifi-
 cant gains were registered. Rice production was
 up in 1969, and most of the main roads in Java
 were improved. Export earnings increased, and
 imports-which also increased-showed a sub-
 stantially higher proportion of capital goods and
 raw materials in 1969 as compared with consumer
 goods than in previous years.
 Indonesia's economic recovery is being un-
 derwritten by a group of Western nations and
 international organizations with the US and Japan
 as principal donors. Since 1966, this group has
 pledged more than $1.5 billion. These same na-
 tions have also annually postponed payments on
 debts that Indonesia negotiated with them during
 the Sukarno era. They now have tentatively
 agreed on a longer term rescheduling of amortiza-
 tion that would permit repayment over a 30-year
 period, with no interest during the first 15 years.
 The Soviet Union, Indonesia's largest single
 creditor, renegotiated debt payments in 1966, but
 so far has refused to arrange a longer term re-
 scheduling. It may be willing to do so now that
 Western creditors have agreed on terms.
 The Suharto government welcomes foreign
 investment. In the past three years, it has signed

 some 30 oil exploration contracts and over 165
 other contracts-chiefly in mining and forestry-
 with foreign companies. Eventually these invest-
 ments will benefit Indonesia but only after the
 long period necessary for exploration and survey
 work. The biggest hope for a quick return is the
 oil industry, which already nets the government
 substantial foreign-exchange receipts.
 On Vie debit side, Indonesia starts its de-
 velopment from a low base with a lamentably
 deteriorated infrastructure and a society oriented
 toward conformity rather than change. Manage-
 rial and technical inadequacies are hampering im-
 plementation of the development plan. There is
 virtually no effective entrepreneurial class beyond
 the small Chinese minority. The country's most
 fundamental problems-a rapidly growing popu-
 lation and unavailability of land-resist early solu-
 tion, and for the present largely negate economic
 growth. The problem is particularly acute on Java
 and Madura, where 65 percent of the population,
 now estimated at 118 million, occupies seven
 percent of the nation's land area. Family planning
 is only beginning and on a very small scale.
 Suharto and many of his civilian and mili-
 tary colleagues believe the latent appeal of the
 left can be defeated only through an improved
 living standard for the average citizen. While giv-
 ing priority to its long-term economic program,
 the government maintains a tight intelligence-
 security effort against Communist Party remnants
 and has continued to screen military and civilian
 organizations for Communist elements.
 The party, crushed in 1965, suffered a sec-
 ond calamitous defeat in 1968 when it failed in
 an effort at military resurgence in East Java and
 lost most of its postcoup leadership. The party's
 present active strength cannot be calculated, but
 it is roughly estimated that about  1,000

 Communists still maintain organizational ties and
 that a far smaller number are engaged in or-
 ganized work. Active cadres appear to fall into
 two groups, both of which are pro-Peking in the
 sense that they see the ultimate need for armed
 struggle. The larger faction, for the present, how-
 ever, preaches peaceful rebuilding, while the
 smaller demands an immediate paramilitary ef-
 fort. Small groups are reportedly engaged in
 minor terrorism in Central Java, but whether they
 are acting out of conviction or have undertaken
 banditry primarily for economic survival is not
 known.
 The government faces a problem on what to
 do with imprisoned Communists who now total
 67,000, some of whom have been in prison since
 1965. These individuals represent a financial bur-
 den and an international embarrassment in that
 their continued incarceration has drawn wide-
 spread criticism. The government has released
 about 4,000 of the some 26,000 Communist pris-
 oners who had little status in the movement, and
 plans to release more this year.
 The better indoctrinated Communist prison-
 ers, about 11,000, are gradually being resettled in
 agricultural colonies either in "closed villages" or
 on remote islands. The hard core, some 5,000,
 will remain in prison and eventually will be
 brought to trial. Another 27,000-presumably
 those more recently arrested-have yet to be
 thoroughly interrogated, and no determination
 has yet been made as to their status.
 As an adjunct to both the security effort and
 the economic plan, the armed forces conduct a
 civic action program. This is essentially carried
 out at the village level, and involves small-scale
 road and bridge building and irrigation projects.
 The US has given modest support to civic action
 and is now expanding its aid program from $5
 million to $15 million. Washington's military as-
 sistance program will continue to be focused on
 civic action, but some combat material probably
 will be included.
 Despite government misgivings over possible
 disruption of the economic development pro-
 gram, national elections in mid-1971 now appear
 definite, but they are unlikely to result in any
 significant change in parliament and congress un-
 less the army's plans go drastically awry. The two
 bodies will not be completely elected; instead,
 their memberships will be chosen by a variety of
 methods.
 Until last fall, the government appeared to
 be moving toward a second postponement of elec-
 tions. It argued that such elections would be
 costly, that the country needed to concentrate on
 economic development, that elections could dis-
 rupt the economic program, or that they might
 even promote political instability. During a series
 of consultations that Suharto held with political
 party leaders last October, however, only one
 party-the small Catholic Party-took the hint
 and agreed that elections should be postponed.
 The other eight pressed Suharto to hold elections
 on schedule. Apparently on the strength of these
 consultations and to the considerable surprise of
 the parties, Suharto decided to move forward.
 Presumably he believed that, all things consid-
 ered, it would be unwise to frustrate the parties
 further by another postponement.
 In November, parliament finally passed the
 enabling legislation; election funds have now been
 budgeted, and election committees formed. Some
 of the parties, particularly the National Party and
 the Indonesian Moslem Party, are actively recruit-
 ing. The army is pushing hard in the provinces
 with its  organization of functional groups
 (SEKBER GOLKAR), and in April it put pressure
 on the National Party to elect a chairman who
 showed promise of being susceptible of army di-
 rection.

 The election bills provide for a 460-member
 parliament and a 920-seat congress. The govern-
 ment will appoint from the military and from
 nonmilitary functional groups 100 members of
 parliament and one third (307) of the congres-
 sional membership. The division between military
 and nonmilitary in this appointed sector is set at
 three to one. The remaining 360 seats in parlia-
 ment will be filled by election, using an elaborate
 system of apportioning seats that should give Java
 approximately 183 seats and the other islands
 177. Parliament sits as a body in congress, and the
 remaining congressional seats will be partially
 elected and partially appointed.
 Present indications are that the government
 hopes to prevent the elections from causing either
 a major disruption of national unity or a serious
 diversion from the economic program. Although
 campaigning, as now scheduled, will be permitted
 for about ten months, parties have been ad-
 monished not to discredit other parties or groups,
 not to take issue with the five basic principles of
 the Indonesian state (nationalism, international-
 ism, democracy, social justice, and belief in God),
 not to disturb national stability and tranquility,
 and to stress the government's economic develop-
 ment program. The military will screen all elec-
 tion slates.
 President Suharto has suggested that the
 nine parties and SEKBER GOLKAR organize
 themselves into three groups-nationalist, re-
 ligious, and functional-to contest the elections.
 If he expects thereby to reduce the number of
 slates from ten to three, he is unlikely to succeed.
 The parties have "agreed in principle" with Su-
 harto's suggestion but so far have shown no will-
 ingness to submerge their respective identities.
 The army hopes, through the use of
 SEKBER GOLKAR and the cultivation of the
 National Party, to see the election of a substantial
 number of proadministration candidates. These,
 with the appointed membership, would give the
 government a more than adequate majority in
 both parliament and congress and would ensure
 Suharto's re-election by the congress in 1973.
 Although Indonesia officially espouses a pol-
 icy of nonalignment, foreign relations are in fact
 oriented toward the non-Communist world. This
 follows partly from the government's domestic
 anti-Communist position but chiefly from Indo-
 nesia's need for foreign economic assistance avail-
 able largely from the West and from Japan. Never-
 theless, Indonesia maintains correct relations with
 the Soviet Union and with other European bloc
 nations and has sought assistance from them as
 well. Relations with Communist China have been
 suspended since 1967 and show no sign of early
 improvement.
 Other than negotiating foreign aid, Indo-
 nesia's principal international interest is that of
 developing regional influence in Southeast Asia.
 With the largest population in the area, Indonesia
 sees itself as the potential area leader, particularly
 as Western forces either withdraw or reduce their
 presence. For the time being, Djakarta views the
 five-member Association of Southeast Asian Na-
 tions (ASEAN), which it established in 1967 with
 Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Singa-
 pore, as the principal vehicle for promoting its
 influence. Indonesia has been the most active
 member in trying to keep the organization alive.
 Indonesia is aware that it needs time to deal
 with its domestic problems and to develop the
 economic, political, and military base necessary
 for the ambitious role it envisions. It is concerned
 that the US may withdraw from Southeast Asia
 before the area has achieved reasonably enduring
 stability and security. At the same time, the
 Nixon Doctrine neatly complements Indonesia's
 aspirations.

 Foreign Minister Malik's recent initiative,
 which led to the scheduling of the 16-17 May
 conference on Cambodia, reflects one facet of
 Indonesia's regional ambitions. Although genu-
 inely concerned over developments in Cambodia,
 Djakarta also sees them as an opportunity per-
 mitting Indonesia to assert itself.
 Djakarta shares Asia's general ambivalence
 toward Japan. Although Indonesia needs and en-
 courages Japanese economic assistance and invest-
 ment, it is concerned over Japan's economic asser-
 tiveness throughout the area and over indications
 of Japan's increased interest in military power.
 Indonesia fears that the US is pushing Japan to-
 ward assuming an increased area role at a time
 when Tokyo may be becoming less responsive to
 US influence.
 The Suharto government is gradually becom-
 ing more active on the international scene, but
 diplomacy remains secondary except as it sup-
 ports domestic needs. The government's major
 preoccupation continues to be with domestic
 problems.
 Although the Suharto government harbors
 many weaknesses, its progress to date more than
 outweighs its defects. The political posturing and
 economic neglect of the Sukarno era have long
 since given way to quiet, steady action toward
 meeting basic economic requirements, to an
 awareness of the need for a restructuring of the
 political party system, and to the responsible con-
 duct of foreign affairs.
 Least progress has been made in the domes-
 tic political sector. Although the government has
 attempted to move toward modernization, it has
 been obstructed by the entrenched parties. This
 mutual distrust between the military and the par-
 ties is more than a military-civilian rivalry. It is
 also fed by long-standing religious-secular differ-
 ences and ethnically based cleavages within Indo-
 nesian society. Ethnic, regional, and religious
 loyalties, less submerged now than in the days of
 Sukarno's emotionally based supernationalism,
 are being more openly expressed under Suharto.
 At this time, however, they do not affect Indo-
 nesia's very real sense of nationhood or threaten
 any dramatic schisms.
 The army sees national elections as tending
 to encourage, under the present party system, the
 centrifugal forces of Indonesian political life. Al-
 though Suharto has reluctantly decided to pro-
 ceed with elections in 1971, they will be carefully
 controlled both to prevent a factionalizing effect
 on political life and to perpetuate the army's role.
 Suharto's outstanding qualities as Indonesian
 leader have been his caution and patient skill in
 restructuring Sukarno's Indonesia. Although
 dynamic and modernist elements, both civilian
 and military, have fretted and criticized, Suharto
 has slowed the pace, and has achieved dramatic
 changes without rending Indonesia's delicately
 structured society. Responsible civilians, both in
 the parties and outside them, see no immediate
 alternative to the army's present role, but hope
 that within ten years enough progress will have
 been made to permit a return to a predominantly
 civilian government based on a more modernized
 political system.
 The  S u h ar t o  government's over-all ac-
 complishments to date, although commendable,
 are only initial steps toward the economic, social,
 and political development required if Indonesia is
 to fulfill the needs of its people, avoid political
 instability, and achieve the area leadership role to
 which it aspires.

 Detente and Defense: The Issues of the NATO Ministerial
 NATO Headquarters in Brussels
 The role of NATO in both detente and defense is in transition. The
 meeting of the foreign ministers of the 15 Alliance members in Rome on
 26-27 May is a way station on the road to an uncertain destination in both
 areas. Soviet and East European initiatives for a Conference on European
 Security-designed to win acceptance of the status quo in Europe-have
 found popular appeal in some West European countries. The Allies are
 attempting to find ways to respond that will enhance NATO's detente image
 without jeopardizing the security of the Alliance. At the same time, they are
 embarking on a wide-ranging survey of the defense needs of the Alliance in
 the 1970s, set in the context of growing uncertainty in Europe about what
 changes will be made in the US commitment to NATO in the future and
 what the European reaction should be.

 Determination of the role NATO should
 play in the pursuit of detente in general and
 European detente in particular is the most im-
 mediate question facing the May ministerial. The
 NATO ministerial last December steered away
 from any new initiatives in the area of European
 security, in spite of the desire of a number of
 Allies to come up with a more enthusiastic re-
 sponse to Warsaw Pact overtures for a Conference
 on European Security. The final communique
 turned a cold shoulder to the Pact proposal for
 early convocation of such a conference on the
 grounds that Moscow does not intend that such a
 gathering negotiate basic political issues leading to
 agreement on a new security arrangement for
 central Europe. The convening of such a meeting,
 for the Soviets, would be an end in itself: to
 confirm the status quo in Europe. The com-
 munique reiterated the Allied offer to discuss
 specific issues, such as balanced force reductions;
 ways to mitigate East-West tensions caused by the
 military situation in Central Europe; and im-
 proved avenues for economic, technical, and cul-
 tural exchanges.
 Alliance members were encouraged to pur-
 sue bilateral contacts with the East, however, and
 the West Germans were specifically supported in
 their bid to the Soviet Union for a renunciation
 of force agreement. A more forthcoming Allied
 position on the security question was left con-
 tingent on visible progress in such bilateral ef-
 forts, which presumably would demonstrate a
 chance  for success for broader East-West
 initiatives.
 Bilateral contacts since last December, al-
 though not very productive so far, have helped
 convince a number of the Allies that there is
 cause to go ahead with a strong NATO overture
 to the East on European security. They cite West
 Special Report
 Germany's negotiations with the Soviet Union
 and Poland, the talks between Chancellor Brandt
 and East German Premier Stoph, and the recent
 agreement between Bonn and Pankow on regu-
 lating and improving postal and telecommunica-
 tions traffic. This progress, together with the re-
 sumption of the SALT in Vienna and renewed
 talks on Berlin between the US, the UK, France,
 and the Soviet Union, has led to'concern on the
 part of some smaller NATO members that
 decisions affecting their security may be taken
 without their having been adequately heard. A
 more ambitious multilateral effort, although it
 might have no great prospect of success, would at
 least give these countries a forum.
 In any case, the prime consideration for
 many of these states is their domestic situation.
 With East-West detente such a popular issue, these
 governments find it politic to deprive their
 opposition of the high ground by appearing them-
 selves to be working zealously for detente. It is
 primarily for this reason that they find US posi-
 tions inadequate, particularly on a Conference on
 European Security (CES).
 MUTUAL AND BALANCED FORCE
 REDUCTIONS
 NATO consideration of the European secu-
 rity question in recent years has revolved around
 the topic of mutual and balanced force reductions
 (MBFR). Meeting in Reykjavik in June 1968, the
 NATO ministers signaled the Soviet Union that
 the Alliance was prepared to discuss MBFR. In,
 answer to the growing domestic pressures in the
 member states for cuts in defense spending, the
 ministers also reaffirmed that the over-all military
 capability of NATO should not be reduced except
 as part of mutual and balanced reductions with
 the Warsaw Pact.
 In the spring of 1968, NATO experts had
 already drawn up some force reduction models as

 a guide for future discussions in the Alliance and
 a possible basis for negotiations at a later date.
 Although the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czecho-
 slovakia in August 1968 brought NATO's study
 of MBFR to a screeching halt and eased domestic
 pressures for cuts in defense expenditures, the
 20th anniversary session of NATO held in Wash-
 ington in April 1969 again announced NATO's
 willingness to join with the Warsaw Pact countries
 in a search for topics that might fruitfully be
 discussed in an East-West forum. The ministers
 referred back to the "Reykjavik Signal" on
 MBFR, to which the Pact countries had not re-
 plied. Work was subsequently resumed on the
 MBFR models, and the continuation of this en-
 deavor was strongly supported at the December
 ministerial that year.
 The working group charged with preparation
 of the MBFR models has produced five illustra-
 tive versions, which after further review are
 scheduled to be submitted to the May ministerial.
 The models fall into two categories: one sym-
 metrical and four asymmetrical. The symmetrical
 version envisions NATO and Warsaw Pact force
 reductions on an equal basis. The four asym-
 metrical versions posit a larger draw-down of War-
 saw Pact than of NATO forces to take into
 account the Warsaw Pact's advantages, particu-
 larly the relative ease of return of its forces to the
 central European area.
 The models point up but do not resolve a
 major difficulty that would be involved in any
 attempt to implement MBFR. To be acceptable
 to the Soviet Union at all, the proposed reduc-
 tions would probably have to be symmetrical, but
 this would pose great difficulties for the West.
 Moreover, it is not clear how a proposed thinning
 out of forces in Central Europe would be related
 to strategic arms limitations. The French lately
 have been warning that the USSR might try to
 use MBFR to obtain a "denuclearization" of the
 areas involved.
 The Federal Republic last year was generally
 dubious about the Warsaw Pact proposals for a
 Conference on European Security, and it still
 rejects a conference in the form proposed by the
 Soviets. Since December, however, West German
 policy has taken a new tack. The Germans now
 appear ready to countenance movement toward
 discussion of European security issues if the main
 subject is mutual and balanced force reductions.
 A principal reason for this is that Bonn,
 more than other NATO capitals, fears that politi-
 cal and financial pressures will lead the US Gov-
 ernment to reduce its forces in Europe after mid-
 1971. No West German Government would wel-
 come a weakening of Western forces in Europe
 while Warsaw Pact forces remain undiminished.
 Yet it would be financially and politically
 difficult for Bonn to make direct budgetary con-
 tributions to the support of US forces. Another
 option, an increase in West German forces, would
 not only be costly and unpopular at home, but
 would also cause a furor abroad and would ter-
 minate Chancellor Brandt's detente policy. This
 policy is based on the strong conviction that the
 division of Europe must be overcome.
 In this situation, Bonn officials view a mu-
 tual and balanced force reduction as a desirable
 program, both for its own value and for tactical
 reasons. If NATO and the Warsaw Pact reduce
 their forces at the same time, the US could carry
 out a reduction without the Soviets gaining a
 preponderance of strength and without the West
 Europeans having to make a greater contribution.
 It is not clear whether West German leaders be-
 lieve that Moscow would actually be interested in
 an MBFR centerpiece for a security conference.
 They have perhaps been encouraged by the So-
 viets' hints that they would consider discussing
 the topic, but only at a conference beyond the
 first  CES. Even if the Soviet response is

 ultimately unfavorable, Bonn probably hopes that
 discussions of the possibility of MBFR will reduce
 pressure within the US for an American draw-
 down. Bonn probably also sees a strong NATO
 stand on MBFR as an aid to West German nego-
 tiations with the Soviets, and indeed, Brandt and
 his colleagues genuinely desire a reduction in
 armaments in both Eastern and Western Europe.
 The Scandinavian NATO members, Denmark
 and Norway, and Belgium and the Netherlands
 consistently have been avid advocates of NATO
 intiatives on European security. Backed strongly
 by public opinion, their governments are eager to
 consider anything they believe will advance de-
 tente. They support NATO proposals on MBFR
 but they really would like to see an affirmative
 Western response to the Warsaw Pact proposal for
 a Conference on European Security. Although
 they believe that MBFR can be accomplished
 only in the context of a general European settle-
 ment, these countries would certainly go along
 with an MBFR initiative in the hope that it would
 lead to a conference dealing with the broad range
 of European security questions.
 A number of NATO countries are prepared
 to support a strong initiative on MBFR without
 necessarily tying it to a broader meeting. Belgium,
 Canada, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, and
 Luxembourg all share Germany's concern about
 the ramifications of any US cutback in its com-
 mitment to NATO, and therefore regard MBFR as
 a possible alternative to increasing their own de-
 fense efforts. They also are genuinely concerned
 with the promotion of detente, and, without
 holding out promises of success that might en-
 courage unrealistic popular expectations, believe
 that NATO must take some forward-looking
 steps.
 In addition to supporting a strong MBFR
 declaration, the UK is still pushing its proposal
 Special Report                              - `i -
 for a Standing Committee on East-West Relations
 (SCEWR) as an alternative to the Warsaw Pact call
 for a security conference in the near future. The
 SCEWR would provide machinery for more or
 less regular contact, exploration, and negotiation
 with the East in an attempt to determine if at
 some future time a CES might produce mean-
 ingful results. This idea, or variants thereof, is
 supported by several other members, including
 Belgium, Canada, and Italy. The Italians think
 that domestic public opinion demands some
 initiative toward detente, and a "historic event"
 at the Rome ministerial would undoubtedly
 please the Rumor government.
 One holdout to the desire of NATO's ma-
 jority for a significant initiative on detente is
 France. Paris objects to anything that smacks of
 bloc-to-bloc negotiations and does not like the
 idea of MBFR as a topic for an East-West con-
 fPr nce.
 Nonetheless, the
 French Government is studying the MBFR ques-
 tion internally to assess its potential impact on
 French security and is keeping a close watch on
 MBFR developments in NATO. The majority
 view, moreover, is not popular with the govern-
 ments of Greece, Turkey, and Portugal, which
 would prefer to maintain a relatively hard line
 toward the Pact's security conference proposals.
 They will go along, however, with as forthcoming
 an approach as the US will accept.
 Moscow may again attempt to nudge NATO
 toward a more positive position on the European
 security issue. Often in the past the Soviet Union
 has convened the Warsaw Pact nations prior to a
 NATO ministerial in an attempt to upstage the
 Allies. Whether Moscow decides on a repetition of
 this procedure or not, no new substantive pro-
 posal is expected from the Pact.

 So far it appears that the US will be able to
 head off any NATO reference to a Conference on
 European Security in the ministerial communique
 going much beyond the reserved position taken at
 the December ministerial. Any direct connection
 between MBFR and a CES can probably be
 avoided as well. The pressure is on, however, for a
 stronger signal on MBFR, and a number of the
 Allies might not be satisfied to see the MBFR
 question buried in the body of the communique.
 The Germans, for example, favor a separate
 MBFR declaration, both to highlight its im-
 portance and to permit France easily to dissociate
 itself from the MBFR initiative while partici-
 pating in the general communique. The Federal
 Republic may be able to win significant Allied
 support for its claim that anything less than a
 separate MBFR declaration would be a step back-
 ward from the December ministerial.
 ALLIED DEFENSE PROBLEMS FOR
 THE 1970s
 The NATO members are agreed that while
 the pursuit of detente is an important Alliance
 priority, the organization must begin in any case
 to prepare itself for the uncertainties of the
 coming decade. Last March, acting on the sug-
 gestion made in President Nixon's foreign policy
 report to Congress, Secretary General Brosio pro-
 posed that NATO conduct a thorough review of
 the military and strategic problems it will face in
 the next ten years, taking into account the politi-
 cal and economic background as well. Starting
 from the premise that all the Allied countries
 have a common and equal interest in the defense
 of Europe, Brosio recommended for particularly
 close attention the enemy threat, the Allied
 strategy, the level of forces, the relations between
 different kinds of weapons, the nature and effec-
 tiveness of deterrence, and the distribution of
 efforts among member countries.
 Ambassador Gerard Smith (SALT), Secretary
 General Brosio, and Ambassador Ellsworth (NATO)
 The Allies have not determined. precisely
 how this comprehensive review will be handled.
 The task is already complicated by France's re-
 fusal to participate in the "military aspects" of
 the study on the grounds that this would not be
 consistent with its position outside the integrated
 NATO military command structure. But the
 French Government is keeping its foot in the
 door with its intention to participate in any "po-
 litical" discussions and its willingness to sit in on
 military talks. A report outlining the plans for the
 study will be presented to the ministerial, and the
 Allies will attempt to come up with a substantive
 report by the next ministerial meeting in Decem-
 ber.
 The study is likely to open up all of the
 most important problems of the Alliance, ranging
 from its strategic theory to the distribution of the
 defense burden among its members. The latter is
 already on everyone's mind, the Europeans being
 fully aware of the possibility of US reductions
 later in the decade even if the line is held in the
 next few years. But the individual European
 states have their own obstacles to any increase in
 their share of the burden, and they have not come
 to grips with the question of softening their
 separate burdens through some form of defense
 cooperation.

 The major difficulty and the reason for the
 study will in fact be the large number of basic
 unknowns. What alternative force structures and
 strategies would preserve a valid deterrent? How
 will Western Europe's security situation be af-
 fected by the Soviets' assessment of their military
 requirements or opportunities in the Far East or
 in the Mediterranean? What implications will the
 SALT hale for NATO? Would limitations on or
 reductions in strategic forces without a reduction
 in conventional Warsaw Pact forces leave Western
 Europe more exposed? Will economic integration
 in Europe, including British entry into the
 European Communities, provide a context for
 European defense cooperation? Could a coopera-
 tive defensive effort evolve out of the British and
 French nuclear capabilities, and if so, what role in
 the effort would the West Germans find accepta-
 ble?
 THE SITUATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
 The increasing Soviet military activity in the
 Mediterranean has continued to concern the Al-
 lies. A report has been prepared describing the
 general situation and pointing to the threat the
 Soviet build-up in the area could pose to NATO's
 southern flank. The US would like Allied agree-
 ment on some concrete action, such as the estab-
 lishment of a special Mediterranean group in
 NATO for consultations on the problem and a
 broadening of member-state participation in
 NATO Mediterranean activities. The report itself
 will likely be approved. Beyond that, however,
 most ministers may be unwilling to do more than
 pledge to consider future additional measures to
 enhance NATO security and improve the opera-
 tional effectiveness of Allied Mediterranean
 forces.

 Society (CCMS), NATO's contribution to inter-
 governmental efforts to improve the environment.
 The Allies, many of whom were dubious about
 the the efficacy of NATO involvement in this area
 when it was originally proposed by the US, seem
 lately to have warmed to the effort. Rapid
 progress was made in the planning stage, and a
 CCMS meeting this April firmed up plans for
 work this year looking toward proposals for gov-
 ernmental action in such areas as air pollution,
 disaster relief, and road safety.
 As the various CCMS projects are about to
 get under way, NATO is trying to work out a
 policy that would permit nonmembers to par-
 ticipate in CCMS activities, or to observe them.
 The US had proposed inviting outside participa-
 tion to preserve good relations with other organi-
 zations working in the environmental field, but
 some European members were uneasy about
 working in the company of countries whose gov-
 ernments they find objectionable, such as Spain.
 A compromise has been worked out, however,
 whereby outside participation will be judged on a
 case-by-case basis, giving any NATO member a
 chance to make a specific objection to any pro-
 posed participant or observer.
 The May ministerial is likely to leave most of
 the important questions facing the Alliance un-
 resolved, but it may also mark some advance in
 the search for answers that will be valid in a
 decade that may see considerable change in
 Europe's security situation.
 In keeping with NATO's pursuit of an image
 of detente as well as defense, some initiative on
 MBFR probably will be approved and an attempt
 will be made again to indicate NATO's interest in
 improving East-West relations in a number of con-
 crete ways. If there is a response or a premin-
 isterial initiative from the Warsaw Pact, it is likely
 to be a renewed call for a Conference on
 European Security under conditions the Alliance
 cannot yet countenance. The more skeptical of
 the Allies will continue to insist on the need to
 wait for some progress in the various bilateral
 Allied efforts. Nevertheless, it is by the means of
 such dialogues that the Alliance will arrive at a
 realistic assessment of the possibilities for negotia-
 tions on basic European issues.
 The approval the ministers are expected to
 give to the study of the defense requirements of
 the 1970s, even if it is not specifically referred to
 in the communique, may open the door for the
 eventual frank consideration of some of the inter-
 nal problems facing the Alliance in the near
 future. This may help to mitigate the European
 concern about possible unilateral US reductions
 in its NATO commitments after mid-1971, but
 the Europeans have a long way to go in finding a
 means of coping with such an eventuality. Move-
 ment toward defense cooperation would not be
 easy for Europe for a variety of reasons, including
 the uncertainty surrounding future French policy
 toward NATO and the lag behind the US and the
 USSR  in  European strategic thinking. The
 Europeans are likely to work in the review to
 minimize any US withdrawals and to avoid re-
 opening the debate on the existing strategy of the
 Alliance. Should it appear that this effort will fail,
 the Europeans may then be encouraged to devote
 more serious attention to the problems of defense
 cooperation.
