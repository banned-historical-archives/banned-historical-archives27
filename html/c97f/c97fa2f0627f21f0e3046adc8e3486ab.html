 The Soviet leaders have expressed their satisfaction
 with the outcome of the East-West exchange which produced
 agreement to convene a foreign minister's conference on
 11 May.  High Soviet Foreign Ministry officials have been
 obviously relieved that a foreign ministers' meeting has
 been arranged.  Moscow is continuing its efforts to dem-

 reaction to the NATO ministerial meetin  was relatively
 restrained.                                                              25X1

 MIDDLE EAST HIGHLIGHTS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  . :Page 8
 The Iraqi regime remains tense and alert to possible
 new efforts to overthrow it, and the Communists continue to
 increase their strength in the country.           Baghdad is con-
 cerned with the Iraqi-Syrian border area.                           There apparently
 has been some small build-up of UAR ground and air units
 in eastern Syria.  Cairo is continuing its propaganda war-
 fare and has instituted a new "Voice of Free Iraq."
 The Baghdad regime meanwhile has accelerated moves
 to oust the few remaining Western business enterprises in
 Iraq.   Since the Mosul uprising, the Iraq Petroleum Com-
 pany has been harassed by arrests of Iraqi personnel,
 although its operations have not yet been affected.  Prime
 Minister Qasim also is considering nationalizing the
 French share in the company and may grant the Soviet Union
 an offshore oil concession in the Persian Gulf.   In at
 least one instance, a development contract formerly held
 by a Western company has been taken over by the USSR.

 Mao Tse-tung's successor as chairman of the Chinese. Com-
 mu.nis.t~ Government, probably Chu Te, will be "elected" at
 the Second National People's Congress opening in Peiping
 on 17 April.  The agenda for the congress will include a
 report on the work of the government, the adoption of the
 national economic plan and state budget for 1959, and the
 election of leading government personnel.                                   25X1
 CHINESE FOREIGN TRADE SLAWS  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 2
 Communist China's foreign trade drive, which reached
 record heights in 1958, is apparently slowing down.              In-
 creased imports from Western Europe to meet the demands
 of the "leap forward" in industry have led to a substantial
 trade deficit with this area which has not been offset by
 the usual large export surplus in trade with Asian
 countries.   In view of China's limited foreign exchange
 reserves, a high export volume must be maintained or
 Peiping may be forced to cut back imports of manufactured                25X1
 goods and raw materials from Western Europe.

 "COMRADES' COURTS" TO AID KHRUSHCHEV'S (DRIVE AGAINST          Page  3
 HOOLIGANISM   .   .   .  .  .   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .       .  .  .  ?  .
 Khrushchev, in his present drive against hooliganism,
 drunkenness, and other types of "social misdemeanors," has
 turned to the "comrades' courts" as another device to
 promote "collective" responsibility 'for the maintenance
 of public order.  These courts--informal tribunals of
 negligible influence in the past--are to be given broader
 powers.  They apparently will supplement the work of the
 newly organized workers' militia in~reburden lieving
 militia and judiciary     some
 minor offenders.
 GUINEA DEVELOPING CONTROLLED ECONOMY                              Page 4
 Recent decrees issued by the Tour4l government in
 Guinea are an effort to establish a: controlled economy
 and lessen dependence on France.  The new republic has
 also shown a receptivity to expanded political and eco-
 nomic relations with the Soviet bloc.  Thoze growing ties
 with the bloc, however, probably reflect a desire for a
 neutral foreign policy rather than a definite alignment
 with the Communists.
 SOUTH VIETNAM'S SECURITY PROBLEM .    . .  .  .  .  .     .                 .  .  Page 5
 Security sweeps being condunted in South Vietnam
 highlight the Diem government's persistent campaign
 against the numerically small but vgell,-entrenched, Com-
 munist military underground.   Sizable government forces
 are attempting to clean out a strong enemy band north-
 east of Saigon, and Vietnemese marines are using commanddoo
 tactics against Communist enclaves in the southwest.
 over-all security problem continues to divert much of the
 government's energy and resources, from the economic field,
 where progress has been slow.
 JAPANESE COURT DECISION HELPS SOCIALIST ANTI-US CAMPAIGN .  Page
 Uncertainty in Japan over the legality of the US-
 Japanese security treaty will make it difficult for prime
 Minister Kishi to effect an early revision of the treaty
 in order to strengthen his political pos`ion prior to
 the upper-house' elections in June.  The government is con-
 fident that the Supreme Court ultimately will reverse a
 lower court declaration that the presence of foreign
 troops In Japan is unconstitutional, but not in time to
 prevent the Socialists from exploiting; the issue in the
 elections,.

 PART II (continued)
 FIDEL CASTRO'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 7
 Fidel Castro, who arrives in Washington on 15 April
 on an unofficial visit, still seems intent on making
 drastic social and economic reforms in Cuba.  The prime
 minister's methods are increasingly those of a dictator.
 Some of his advisers are pro-Communists? and opposition to
 his government is steadily rising.   In :f=oreign affairs he
 has taken an anti-US position.   During his visit here, he
 will probably attempt to Justify his policies and may also
 seek financial aid
 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN MEXICAN LABOR   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 8
 Mexico's expulsion on 3 April of two Soviet diplomats
 accused of complicity in a crippling nationwide railroad
 strike still in progress was evidently an attempt to rally
 national feeling behind the government's decision to curb
 Communist influence in the labor movement.  Dissatisfied
 workers may still support Marxist labor leaders accused of
 conspiracy.  The government's public position will be
 strengthened by Argentina's expulsion on 7 and 8 April of
 five Soviet bloc diplomats similarly                 terfering
 in internal affairs.
 COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN-BRITISH GUIANA   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  9
 The Communist-led People's Progressive party in
 British Guiana, after a year and a hall! in office under
 the limited powers afforded by the colonial constitution,
 remains the strongest political force.  The party, how-
 ever, now faces internal difficulties, some popular dis-
 illusion, and a potentially more competitive opposition.
 Principally because Cheddi and Janet .Tagan are concentrating
 on their ministerial duties, the party's membership. has
 declined, its funds have dwindled, and the Communists'
 efforts to extend their influence in the -arty have
 largely failed.
 FINNISH .G X MENT DIFFICULTIES     .  .    .  .    .  .  .  .  .     Page 10
 Finland's minority Agrarian government has been
 successful in concluding a 1959 trade agreement with the
 Soviet Union, the issue which led to the fall of its pred-
 ecessor, but it still faces serious financial difficulties
 and a high level of unemployment which the Communists are
 seeking to exploit.  Remaining in office largely because
 the other non-Communist parties fear a new cabinet crisis
 might reopen the question of Communist participation, the
 Sukselainen government is making tentative moves toward
 broadening its parliamentary base.

 NEW LABOR UNREST IN SPAIN LIKELY .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 10
 Labor dissatisfaction over inflationary pressures
 and a growing willingness to defy the Franco regime may
 lead to strikes in Spain during the next few weeks.            The
 Communist party may try to force the moderate opposition
 groups to participate to some extent in nationwide labor
 agitation.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 STATUS OF THE FRENCH COMMUNIST PARTY      ..  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 1
 The French Communist party still retains a mass elec-
 toral following and the most extensive political organi-
 zation in France despite the virtual elimination of the
 party's National Assembly representations in the November
 elections and its lesser setbacks in March, when it was
 ousted from numerous municipal administrations.  These
 defeats have caused serious financial problems and
 encouraged criticism among the rank and file over the
 rigidity of party leadership.  The top leaders, however,
 have shown little disposition to change party policies
 and seem to be counting instead on dissatisfaction with
 the government's economic program--such as occurred to
 some extent      h  March elections--to restore Communist
 influence.

 UNREST AMONG PALESTINE REFUGEES  .  .  .  .  .  .    .  .  .  .  .  .  Page   3
 Recent rioting and strikes in Jordan and Lebanon
 again emphasize the potentially disruptive influence of
 the Arab refugees displaced during the Palestine war of
 1948.  Their "temporary" status has assumed a degree of
 permanency, and there is little prospect of a solution to
 the problem of their existence as wards of the United
 Nations.  The refugees, now totaling over one million,
 are still determined to achieve repatriation and compen-
 sation for their losses, while Israel is equally adamant
 in opposing repatriation.  The mandate of the UN Relief
 and Works Agenc  for Palestine Refugees expires on 30               25X1

 SINO-SOVIET BLOC FOREIGN TRADE PRICING PRACTICES .
 25X1
 .  Page  9
 The Sino-Soviet bloc's foreign trade pricing policies
 are designed primarily to acquire scarce foreign exchange.
 The bloc's aim is to expand existing markets or open new
 ones in order to acquire the hard currencies it must have
 to purchase the free world goods necessary for its ambi-
 tious industrialization programs.   In a period of general
 economic contraction, as in late 1957 and 1958, the Soviet
 effort can occur only at the expense of free world sup-
 pliers, whose prices are sometimes undercut severely by
 bloc traders in order to gain a foothold in Western mar-
 kets.
 BULGARIA INTENSIFIES ECONOMIC PACE .  .  ..  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 11
 Bulgaria's political, economic, and cultural life
 has been transformed since the seventh party congress last
 June.  The Bulgarian regime's economic program, mainly an
 effort to reflect the new policies of the Soviet 21st
 party congress and of Khrushchev's theses for the Soviet
 Seven-Year Plan, is also a result of Soviet pressure on
 the satellites to coordinate economic planning, and of
 internal pressures for reforms.  Bulgaria hopes to realize
 startling advances through greatly increased pressures on
 the people, particularly the peasantry.  Growing apprehen-
 sion is already reported among the populace, but the impli-
 cations of this plan are not yet clear to most Bulgarians.

 9 April 1959
 The Soviet leaders are
 preparing for the next phase
 of the contest over Berlin and
 Germany against a background
 of apparent satisfaction with
 the outcome of the exchange of
 notes which produced agreement
 to convene a foreign ministers'
 conference on 11 May.   High
 Soviet officials,  in talks with
 .Ambassador Thompson, have been
 obviously relieved that a min-
 isterial conference has been
 arranged.
 Thompson believes the "al-
 most pleading" attitude of For-
 eign Ministry officials in
 stressing the importance of a
 summit meeting reflects both
 Khrushchev's pressure on them
 to arrange a heads-of-govern-
 ment meeting and their realiza-
 tion of the dangers of the situ-
 ation brought about by  Khru-
 shchev's Berlin move.
 Soviet officials are prob-
 ing for indications of the West-
 ern position in the forthcoming
 talks.   Deputy Foreign Minister
 Zorin attempted to elicit in-
 formation from Ambassador Thomp-
 son on 3 April by  remarking
 that Khrushchev knew what Secre-
 tary Dulles wanted but is now
 uncertain what American policy
 objectives are.   Gosplan direc-
 tor and party presidium candi-
 date member Kbsygin asked Thomp-
 son on 25 March how the United
 States would frame a foreign
 ministers' agenda.   He professed
 fear  that   Washington   will
 attempt to load down the con-
 ference with so many problems
 that the talks would go on for
 years, putting off a summit
 meeting indefinitely.
 The relatively restrained
 Soviet propaganda reaction to
 the NATO ministerial meeting
 in Washington reflects MOs-
 cow's continuing efforts to
 demonstrate its desire for a
 negotiated settlement.
 Corridor Incident
 MMoscow attempted to ex-
 tract further  political ad-
 vantage from the C-130 incident
 in  the Berlin  air  corridor
 on  27 March  by raising the
 question  to the  diplomatic
 level.   The  Foreign Ministry
 note of 4  April to  the United
 States termed  the flights
 above 10,000 feet a  "gross
 violation of existing regula-
 tions" and charged  the United
 States  with attempting  to
 "worsen"  conditions for  a
 foreign ministers' conference,
 if not completely to "frustrate
 the agreement on  East-West
 talks."  The USSR's decision
 to  follow up  an earlier pro-
 test at                                                           the Berlin Air Safety
 Center with  this formal dip-
 lomatic  note probably                                                              was
 an effort to  capitalize  on
 British press and  official
 criticism of the flights.
 After recalling recent
 statements by Western ambassa-
 dors to Gromyko that unilateral
 actions by any government would
 not promote success of the
 forthcoming negotiations, the
 Soviet note said the USSR would
 not only refrain from any uni-
 lateral actions that might ag-
 gravate the situation but would
 also "go out of its way" to
 facilitate negotiations.   The
 note reaffirmed Moscow's in-
 tention to observe "present
 regulations and accepted prac-
 tice of communications along
 the routes linking Berlin with
 West 1:ermany" until East-West
 talks take place.

 In addition to reassuring
 Western public opinion         that
 Berlin access controls would
 not be turned over to the East
 Germans prior to negotiations,
 this formulation probably was
 also intended as a warning that
 the USSR will respond to fur-
 ther flights above 10,000 feet
 by fighter harassment and pos-
 ibly even a staged "accident."
 Western Consultations
 The NATO foreign ministers'
 meeting and the prior discussions
 among the French, British, Ger-
 man, and American representatives
 led to agreement on the broad
 lines for the forthcoming ne-
 gotiations with Moscow.   De-
 spite sharp differences of
 opinion, the general principles
 of positions to be taken on the
 German question, European security
 disarmament, and Berlin were
 agreed on and approved for sub-
 mission to the four-power work-
 ing group which reconvenes in
 Paris on 13 April.   The final
 substantive positions will be
 submitted to the four foreign
 ministers on 29 April for ap-
 proval prior to the 11 May Ge-
 neva conference.   The working
 group will also work out tactics
 for the negotiations.
 In four-power discussions
 on ,31 March, West German Foreign
 Minister Brentano, apparently
 on :Last-minute instructions from
 Adeiauer, rejected the working
 group:'s plan for unification in
 stages, which had originally
 been presented by Bonn.
 In outlining to the North
 Atlantic Council the principles
 which are to guide the working
 group's study of German reuni-
 fication, the four foreign min-
 isters supported proposing the
 establishment of an all-German
 committee, during a transitional
 period provided the principle
 of free elections is accepted.
 This committee would, among other
 tasks, formulate a draft law
 for free elections  for  an

 which would in turn draft a
 constitution and form an all-
 German government.
 The foreign ministers also
 instructed the working group
 to study the possibility of se-
 curity measures in a special
 zone and how such measures, and
 general disarmament progress,
 should be linked with German
 reunification.  The working
 group is also to prepare a
 statement of general principles
 to govern a German peace treaty
 to be presented in East-West ne-
 gotiations and to develop, if
 practicable, a Western draft
 peace treaty for possible use
 at a conference.  The group will
 study whether the West should
 include some proposal on Berlin
 as part of a general Western
 proposal, as well as possible
 separate proposals on Berlin
 for readiness if the USSR re-
 fuses to discuss a general Ger-
 man statement.
 In the meetings, discus-
 sion of the German situation
 showed complete agreement on
 negative  points  such  as  no
 reunification without free
 elections, no neutralization
 of Germany, no abandonment of
 West Berlin, and no US-UK-Ca-
 nadian withdrawal from the Con-
 tinent.
 Aside from a strong desire
 to negotiate a peaceful settle-
 ment,                                                              the  approach  to  posi-
 tive formulas lacked focus,
 largely because no really sub-
 stantive proposals for a West-
 ern position on Berlin were
 evident in the four foreign min-
 isters' report to the North
 Atlantic Council.   Italy and
 the Netherlands in particular
 noted the need for more infor-
 mation in order to win public
 opinion.  Canada, Norway, Bel-
 gium, and Italy expressed will-
 ingness to consider some type
 of  special  security  zone ar-
 rangement provided it is ac-

 Norway also favored exploring

 Foreign Companies in Iraq
 Moves to oust the few re-
 maining Western companies in
 Iraq have been sharply acceler-
 ated since the uprisings at
 Mosul in March.   The Iraq Pe-
 troleum Company (IPC), which
 had been relatively unhampered
 before the revolt, now is being
 harassed by arrest of-:its Iraqi
 personnel; its operations, how-
 ever, have not yet been affect-
 ed.           More than one third of the
 157 Iraqi nationals occupying
 high technical and managerial
 posts on the IPC staff at Kirkuk
 have been arrested.
 Baghdad
 may nave engineered the arrest
 i  an effort t
 v
 ng

 for
 or'nationalizing the company.
 sequestering.
 Prime Minister Qasim had
 previously said he was consider-
 ing nationalization of the 23.-
 75-percent French share of IPC.
 He reportedly is also consider-
 ing whether to grant the USSR a
 concession in the Persian Gulf
 in  an  offshore  area  recent-
 ly relinquished by the Basra
 Petroleum Company--another IPC
 affiliate.
 In a move designed to weak-
 en Nasir's control over the 70
 percent of Iraq's oil transport
 which moves through Syria, the
 strongly pro-Communist Iraqi
 minister of economy has told
 TPC that the government wants
 the company to construct a
 pipeline from the Kirkuk oil
 fields in northern Iraq to the
 Persian Gulf.
 Partly as a consequence of
 the recent $137,500,000 Soviet
 aid agreement, Baghdad canceled
 the contract of the British
 firm making plans for a new
 steel mill and assigned con-
 struction responsibilities to
 the Soviet Union.   The Iraqi
 cabinet also canceled contracts
 on  ;2  April  signed  with  two
 French firms to design a tex-
 tile factory and to construct
 a natural gas pipeline from
 Kirkuk to Baghdad.
 The increasing number of
 arrests of foreign nationals
 is hampering operations of the
 foreign companies.   By refusing
 to  grant  re-entry  visas  to
 technicians returning from home
 leave and by forcing them to
 submit to elaborate restric-
 tion, and surveillance, Bagh-
 dad is rapidly reducing the
 number of competent technicians
 in  the  country.   Moreover,
 these men have not yet been re-
 placed by Communist bloc nation-
 als.   Iraqi Airways has been
 unable to replace most of the
 British pilots and engineers
 hastily dismissed some time
 ago. Baghdad has appealed to
 Western embassies to aid in
 "sajisfying the urgent require-
 ments of the Iraqi Airways"
 for senior pilots and engineers.

 Refinery at Baghdad, the hiring

 of many unqualified pro-Commu-
 nist personnel has resulted in
 a marked deterioration in the
 plant's safety.   Many Americans
 have already left, and the re-
 mainder are planning to leave
 when  their short-term contracts
 expire.
 Barring a sudden reversal
 of the present government's Com-
 munist orientation, most West-
 ern business interests probably
 will have left Iraq by the end
 of 1959.
 Arab League
 After five days of hotel-
 room conclaves in Beirut, the
 Arab League political committee
 on 7 April issued a communique
 which clearly indicated that
 its efforts to calm the UAR-
 Iraq dispute have so far come
 to nothing.   The committee,
 which did not include represent-
 atives from Iraq,  Jordan, Tu-
 nisia, or Libya, urged that all
 Arab states adhere to a policy
 of "nonalignment and nonsub-
 servience," appealed to Iraq
 to be "in harmony" with the
 other Arab states, and charged
 a subcommittee with the task
 of "studying" ways to implement
 these resolutions.   Even this
 seemingly innocuous conclusion
 was too much for the Sudanese
 delegation, which publicly
 stated it approved of only
 "some" of the points.
 Behind the scenes, there
 appears to have been resent-
 ment on the part of many dele-
 gates against the UAR, and par-
 ticularly against its fiery
 deputy foreign minister, Farid
 Zeineddine, for trying to use
 the meeting simply as a sound-
 ing board for UAR attacks on
 Qasim.   There is also in the
 background a sentiment on the
 part of a number of Arab leaders
 that however much they dislike
 the Iraqi regime, they do not
 wish to join in attacking it
 in such a way that Nasir will
 appear the only beneficiary.
 Inside the UAR, the anti-
 Communist campaign has continued,
 with police raids against the
 remaining Egyptian Communist
 party members.   The purge of
 pro-Communist elements from
 official positions has been ac-
 companied by an independent
 drive against corruption,   The
 latter also has been develop-
 ing for some time, and is being
 pushed by Nasir to counter a
 growing feeling that in some re-
 spects his regime has begun to
 match the corruption of the
 old monarchy.
 Nasir may be particularly
 sensitive to domestic political
 currents at this time because
 of reportedly widespread doubts
 in Egypt that he can "get away
 with? a policy which is hostile
 to both the Soviet Union and
 the West.   UAR officials, pos-
 sibly reflecting something of
 this concern, have urged the
 West to make some move, either
 a public gesture or an offer of
 private support, which would
 indicate that the Nest will
 back Nasir if necessary.   Nasir
 himself, however, does not ap-
 pear to desire such gestures
 or to want to take the initia-
 tive in asking for assurances
 of stand-by aid.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 9 April 1951)
 CHINA'S PEOPLES' CONGRESS TO NAME MAO TSE-TUNG'S SUCCESSOR
 Communist China's Second
 National Peoples' Congress (NPC)
 will open in Peiping on 17 April.
 Its most conspicuous action will
 be the "election" of a succes-
 sor to Mao Tse-tung as chairman
 of the regime.  The congress,
 elected every four years by
 lower level congresses, in theo-
 ry is the highest organ of gov-
 ernment, corresponding to the
 USSR Supreme Soviet.   It meets
 annually.   Like the Supreme
 Soviet, however,  its actual
 legislative functions are largely
 ritualistic, but it does pro-
 vide Peiping with a forum in
 which to disclose the main out-
 lines of government policies
 and plans.
 Peiping has announced that
 the agenda for the congress will
 include a report on the work of
 the government--probably by
 Chou En-lai--the adoption of the
 national economic plan and state
 budget for 1959, and the elec-
 tion of leading government per-
 sonnel.
 Mao has said he does not
 want another term as chairman
 of the government..  Instead, he
 wants to concentrate on national
 policy and devote more time to
 writing on theory.   There seems
 little reason to doubt this,
 since he is retaining all of his
 party posts.
 In confirming his decision
 a  he would not
 seek re-election, Mao implied
 that his health was also a fac-
 tor.                              hat
 it wjaz'y ror~ to re-
 linquish his post as chairman
 of the regime because his con-
 current government and party
 responsibilities were "too great"
 and he was
 getting old."
 Mao's successor in the
 largely ceremonial government
 job will probably be: a popular and
 high-ranking   but fairly unim-
 portant party stalwart like the
 present vice chairman,  Chu Te.
 The congress will also select
 a vice chairman,  the chairman
 of  he NPC Standing Committee,
 and the premier.  There has been
 no :indication, however, that
 Liu Shao-chi or Chou En-lai will
 vacate the latter two posts.
 The congress will examine
 the draft 1959 economic plan out-
 liniLng a "bigger, better, and
 more all-around leap forward"
 for this year. The draft plan,
 which was adopted by the party
 central committee last week, re-
 tairLs the highly :ambitious . tar-
 gets first proposed last Decem-
 ber.   The central committee said
 it "firmly believed" the Chinese
 people would continue their "hard,
 faithful, and honorable work"
 to overfulfill the plan.  The
 congress may also hear a report
 on the "tidying up" operations
 in the communes.   The central
 committee has just concluded
 that the work has been carried
 out "properly" and that the com-
 munes are ""healthy.'"
 Foreign policy statements
 at the congress will be designed
 in part to offset the widespread
 view that Communist  China  is
 the most truculent member of the
 bloc.  During the past year Pei-
 ping suffered a decline in prestige

 After reaching record
 heights in 1958, Communist Chi-
 na's foreign trade drive is
 apparently slowing down, and
 recent reports indicate that
 Peiping is encountering diffi-
 culties in meeting its export
 commitments.
 In 1958, Communist China's
 export drive in the free world
 was pursued aggressively, par-
 ticularly in Asia, from which
 Peiping receives a large portion
 of its foreign exchange earn-
 ings.  Toward the end of the
 year, however, shortages de-
 veloped in the supply of com-
 modities normally exported from
 China.
 reports of export shortages and
 complications indicate~,'however,
 that these difficulties are
 probably widespread and not re-

 In the first three months
 of 1959, mainland exports to

 and China began to cancel major
 contracts for exports to Brit-

 These difficulties thus

 from temporary, localized trans-

 immediate effects appear to be
 hindering expansion of foreign
 trade.
 Although the value of can-
 celed contracts has not been
 large, the unfavorable public-
 ity probably has been very em-
 barrassing to Chinese trade
 officials who have worked hard
 to prove China's worth as a
 reliable trading partner.   In-
 demnities have been paid to
 injured firms in some cases,
 and the Chinese have assured
 importers that present diffi-
 culties will soon be corrected.
 Communist China's trade
 with Western Europe in 1958 was
 much greater than in 1957, but
 a 55-percent increase in imports
 was accompanied by only a 25-
 percent increase in exports,
 leaving an import surplus of
 about $240,000,000 with  that
 area.   Previously this deficit
 --$130,000,000 in 1957--was
 covered by China's large sur-
 plus in trade with Asian coun-
 tries.                                                                Peiping's trade deficit
 with its major free world trad-
 ing partners grew from only
 $30,000,000 in 1957 to more
 than $120,000,000 in 1958.
 In view of China's limited
 foreign exchange reserves, the
 present trend probably cannot
 continue for long.   A high ex-
 port volume must be maintained
 or Communist China may be forced
 to cut back imports of manu-
 factured  goods  and  raw  ma-
 terials  from  Western  Euro e.

 "COMRADES' COURTS" TO AID KHRUSHCHEV'S DRIVE AGAINST HOOLIGANISM
 Khrushchev, in his present
 drive  against  hooliganism,
 drunkenness, and other types
 of "social misdemeanors',11 has
 turned to the comrades' courts
 as another device to promote
 "collective" responsibility
 for the maintenance of public
 order.   These courts--informal
 tribunals. of negligible influ-
 ence in the past-are to be
 given broader powers.
 The courts will apparent-
 ly be in the nature of an offi-
 cially organized citizens' vig-
 ilance committee.   In this re-
 spect they have much in common
 with the neighborhood  mass
 meetings empowered under the
 recently enacted "antiparasite"
 laws to exile speculators,
 beggars, and others living on
 money not gained through "so-
 cially useful work."  The
 courts will probably supplement

 The Soviet press was quick
 to follow up Khrushchev's re-
 marks at the 21st party congress
 that "the time has come to pay
 more attention to comrades'
 courts..bwhich should examine
 not only cases of a production
 nature but questions of daily
 conduct and morals."  A number
 of articles have appeared prais-
 ing the idea but pointing out
 the obvious need for altering
 the existing statutes governing
 the courts' operation if they
 are to function as Khrushchev
 has specified.
 One factor which apparent-
 ly has attracted Khrushchev to
 the courts is that they possess
 many of the features of a show
 trial, geared to influence the
 attending spectators as well as
 the defendant.   In these terms,

 the comrades' courts are de-
 signed to supplement the penal
 actions of the regular courts
 with a primarily prophylactic
 function.
 In recent years comrades'
 courts have existed only in
 factories and enterprises.  The
 wnrkers elect members of the
 court who then elect a chair-
 man, usually a member of the
 factory management, and a dep-
 uty chairman.   The court meets
 in open session, and the work-

 couraged not only to attend but
 to take the floor.   The most
 severe sentences the courts can
 recommend to the factory direct-
 or are dismissal or demotion,
 however, and existing statutes
 limit! their jurisdiction to
 cases of absenteeism and produc-
 tion misdemeanors.

 comrades' courts are being estab-

 the suggestion has been made to
 set up similar ones in apartments

 GUINEA DEVELOPING CONTROLLED ECONOMY
 The Sekou Tours government's'
 recent tightening of economic
 controls and its expansion of
 commercial ties with the Soviet
 bloc may presage a major shift
 of Guinea's social and govern-
 mental philosophy away from free
 enterprise and toward state
 socialism.   Moreover, the ar-
 rivals in Conakry in late March
 of two shipments of Czech arms--
 probably a gift for internal
 security needs--and a 30-man
 Czech military mission demon-
 strate Guinea's receptivity to
 close bloc ties. These arrivals,
 according to the French charge
 in Conakry, are in violation
 of the French-Guinean technical
 assistance accord of 7 January.
 A series of presidential
 decrees enabling the government
 to exercise broad controls over
 labor, domestic commerce, in-
 ternational trade, and foreign
 firms reflect the government's
 desire to establish a controlled
 economy.  Quotas have been im-
 posed on principal agricultural
 exports.  Newly imposed import
 restrictions are directed pri-
 marily at the franc zone, which
 accounted for about 75 percent
 of Guinea's total foreign trade
 in 1958.
 The government is refusing
 to grant import certificates
 for articles of French origin
 on the grounds that they must
 be imported from East European
 countries with which Guinea has
 barter agreements.   France charges
 that such actions violate franc
 zone regulations.   In addition,
 African importers in Guinea are
 given preference over foreign--
 largely French--importers in
 handling all goods covered under
 the agreements with Czechoslo-
 vakia and East Germany.
 Recognition of the danger
 of bloc operations in Guinea is
 reflected in the United Nations
 Secretariat's decision to send
 a Swedish consultant to Conakry
 to investigate Communist pene-
 tration efforts there in addition
 to examining prospects for ex-
 tending technical assistance.

 9 April 1959
 Paris, stating that these de-
 velopments in Guinea are detri-
 mental to friendly relations,
 has decided to delay sending
 an ambassador to Conakry for
 at least another two months.
 Guinea's increasing ties
 with the bloc probably are part
 of an attempt to lessen its de-
 pendence on France and to pro-
 South Vietnam's persistent
 security problem posed by the
 well-entrenched Vietnamese Com-
 munist military underground,
 estimated at more than 2,000
 men, is highlighted by recent
 military-operations northeast
 of Bien Hoa and in the Ca Mau
 Peninsula in the southwest.
 These operations, conducted by
 units of the regular armed
 forces, which number some 145,-
 000,  instead of the less effec-

 defined targets.
 The present security sweep
 by a reinforced Vietnamese ma
 rine battalion in,two provinces
 of the Ca Mau Peninsula is being
 conducted by squad and platoon
 units using commando-type hit-
 and-run tactics.   Such factors
 have proved effective in this
 area of interlacing waterways
 and tall marsh grass where the
 Communists have achieved vir-
 tual control over whole vil-
 lages and districts.   The ma-
 rine forces have killed a num-
 ber of Communists, including
 several political commissars,
 and have concentrated on de-
 stroying enemy food sources.
 The Bien Hoa and Ca Mau
 operations are designed to pre-
 vent the growth of dangerous
 concentrations of Communist un-
 derground strength.   Most gov-
 ernment efforts, however, are
 directed toward combating scat-
 tered incidents of Communist
 terrorism in the rural areas
 and in fighting a continuous
 propaganda war for the loyalty
 of the Vietnamese people.   In
 the lace of unrelenting pressure
 by the Communist political and
 military underground, the Diem
 government has been forced to
 divert much of its energy and
 resources from the economic
 field, where the rate of prog-
 ress---which has been slow--is
 a major factor in determining
 South  Vietnam's  long-range
 stability.

 JAPANESE COURT DECISION HELPS SOCIALIST ANTI-US CAMPAIGN
 The opinion of the Tokyo
 district court that the pres-
 ence of foreign troops in Ja-
 pan is unconstitutional may
 make it more difficult for
 Prime Minister Kishi to effect
 an early revision of the US-Jap-
 anese  security treaty.   The
 Kishi government is appealing
 the case directly to the Su-
 preme Court, but a decision is
 not expected for several months.
 In the interim, the Socialists
 will be able to exploit the is-
 sue for the upper-house elec-
 tions in early June.
 The district court on 30
 March acquitted seven Japanese
 nationals who were indicted un-
 der a special criminal law for
 trespassing on an American air
 base in 1957.   The court de-
 clared the law invalid on the
 grounds that it affords protec-
 tion to foreign forces in Japan
 whose  presence is a violation
 of the Japanese Constitution.
 The court cited Article 9 of
 the Constitution which stipu-
 lates that "land, sea, and air
 forces, as well as other war
 potential, will never be main-
 tainE!d."
 Pending the appeal, the
 court's opinion will have no
 immediate effect on the legal
 status of American forces in
 Japan.   Kishi's own party al-
 ready is divided over the ex-
 tent of the revision  of the
 US-Japanese security treaty,
 however, while the opposition
 Socialists have formed a united
 front, with the Communists and
 leftist labor to oppose it.
 The Socialists also hope the
 court opinion can be used to
 offset the damage to their po-
 sition which resulted recently
 when a Socialist mission to
 Peiping identified the party
 with. Chinese Communist objec-
 tives in Asia.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 9 April 1959
 The government is confi-
 dent that the Supreme Court,
 with its more conservative
 judges, will reverse the lower
 court decision, but the con-
 stitutionality of the Japanese
 forces themselves could come'
 into question.   Although the
 government has proceeded with
 a gradual military build-up
 on the premise that every na-
 tion has an inherent right to
 provide for its own defense,
 this interpretation has not been
 tested legally.
 FIDEL CASTRO'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON
 Cuban Prime Minister Fidel
 Castro, who arrives in Washing-
 ton on an unofficial visit on
 15 April, has made very clear
 during his three months in power
 his desire for radical economic
 and social reforms to help
 Cuba's lower classes, which
 suffering from chron-
 ic  unemployment and
 underemployment.  His
 methods, however, are
 ineffective and are
 increasingly those
 of a dictator, and
 opposition to his
 government is steadi-
 ly rising.
 Castro' s actions,
 springing largely
 from his extreme
 nationalism and ideal-
 ism,, may also have
 been influenced by
 the opinions of his
 advisers, some of
 whom are pro-Commu-
 nist.  His programs for agrarian
 reform and reducing the cost
 of living appear to have been
 formulated without concern for
 their ultimate economic reper-
 cussions and have taken on the
 aspects of a campaign against
 "vested interests" and the up-
 per-or middle-class professional
 and business groups.
 The court may rule only
 on the criminal law, avoiding
 an opinion on the status of
 the American and Japanese forces.
 If the Supreme Court overrules
 the lower court decision in
 clear-cut terms, however, the
 public and legal debate which
 has been stimulated may lead
 to  a clarification of Japan's
 right to take  adequate steps
 for self-defense, and be in
 effect a judicial sanction for
 US-Japanese defense arrange-
 ments.
 Castro's policies are man-
 ifested in an isolationist or
 "neutralist" position in foreign
 affairs.    His tendency to blame
 United States economic  and
 political influences for all of
 Cuba's ills has resulted in
 strong anti-US statements, par-
 ticularly his answer
 to former Costa Rican
 President Jose Figueres'
 moderate and pro-US
 speech in Havana on 22
 March.    Consequently,
 Castro is becoming iso-
 jlated from the rest of
 LLatin America, includ-
 ing the liberal bloc
 which supported his rev-
 olution,, as well as
 from the United States.
 Castro continues
 to run a "one-man show"
 and has made little ef-
 fort to relinquish his
 -;position as arbiter of
 all government policies
 and actions.   A man of no pre-
 vious administrative or govern-
 ment experience--he is reported-
 ly showing the strain of a
 heavy schedule.  He tolerates
 no criticism of himself or his
 government and continues to make
 frequent lengthy public speeches
 to bolster his popularity, now
 fading noticeably except among
 the., lower classes.

 Convinced that he is the
 victim of a biased press in the
 United States and elsewhere,
 Castro while here will probably
 attempt to explain and justify
 his actions.   He may also, as
 he stated in a recent televi-
 sion interview, seek financial
 aid and a larger sugar quota in
 the US market.  His aversion to
 foreign investment in Cuba is
 limited to private investment
 which can gain control of Cuban
 industries or resources; it
 does not extend to foreign loans
 on a government-to-government
 basis  or  from  international

 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN MEXICAN LABOR
 Mexico's expulsion on 3
 April of two Soviet diplomats
 accused of complicity in a na-
 tionwide railroad strike was
 evidently an attempt to rally
 national feeling behind the gov-
 ernment's decision to curb Com-
 munist influence in the labor
 movement.   This influence has
 been increasing rapidly, but the
 government evidently minimized
 the threat of Soviet interven-
 tion until evidence of it  be-
 came clear to President Lopez
 Mateos.
 Recent Mexican administra-
 tions have kept-wages very low
 in order to help the country's
 economic development, depending
 on broad social benefits and po-
 litical largesse to union lead-
 ers to keep the well-organized
 labor movement loyal to the dom-
 inant Party of Revolutionary In-
 stitutions (PRI).   Many of the
 anti-Communist labor leaders
 have been discredited because
 of their corruption and polit-
 ical subservience at the expense
 of union interests.   This situa-
 tion has given active Marxists
 increasing opportunities to gain
 influence in many key unions by
 demanding legitimate labor bene-
 fits, and it is a threat to the
 PRI's political power with its
 strong labor base.   The govern-
 ment had, however, hesitated to
 challenge the Communist union
 leaders directly.
 e gov-
 ernatent now has accused the rail-
 way union head, Demetrio Vallejo,
 of involvement with Soviet agents
 in a master plan to foster labor
 agitation in Mexico.   Its case
 will. be strengthened in Mexican
 public opinion by Argentina's
 expulsion on 7 and 8 April of
 five Soviet bloc diplomats simi-
 larly accused of interfering in
 internal affairs.
 There have been frequent
 demonstrations for Vallejo's
 release, and many skilled rail-
 road workers refuse to return to
 work despite strong government
 pressure to end the economically
 serious strike.   Dissatisfied
 workers in the railway and other
 Communist-influenced unions are
 likely to suspect the govern-
 ment's actions as an indication
 of its determination to control
 labor for its own ends,   There
 already have been loud complaints
 that union heads hastily installed
 to replace arrested leaders are
 government stooges.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 9 April 1959
 FINNISH GOVERNMENT DIFFICULTIES
 Finland's minority Agrarian
 government has been successful
 in concluding a 1959 trade agree-
 ment with the Soviet Union, the
 issue which led to the'fall of
 its predecessor, but it still
 faces serious financial diffi-
 culties and a high level of un-
 employment which the Communists
 are seeking to exploit politi-
 cally.
 Prime Minister Sukselainen
 took office on 13 January after
 the USSR refused to conclude a
 trade agreement with the majority
 coalition of the Social Democrat
 Prime Minister Fagerhoim. Under
 the agreement obtained by Suk-
 selainen in mid-March, Finland
 will not have to reduce the level
 of its exports--about $140,000,-
 000--but remains economically
 highly dependent on the USSR,
 particularly as a market for
 Finland's high-cost metalworking
 industry and as a source of some
 raw materials such as petroleum.
 In contrast to its tough
 attitude toward the Fagerholm
 government, the Soviet Union
 granted certain concessions,
 such as carrying over into the
 new agreement Finland's export
 surplus of $13,000,000, reducing
 Finland's quota of Soviet auto-
 mobiles, and allowing Finland
 to repay the ten-year $10,000,-
 000 gold loan made in 1954 with
 exports instead of gold or hard
 currency.
 Domestic financial prob-
 lems, however, are causing Suk-
 selainen serious difficulties,
 principally an anticipated budg-
 etary deficit this year of al-
 most $70,000,000.   The govern-
 ment has obtained some loans
 from domestic banks, but the
 parliament has rejected propos-
 als for increasing revenues. As
 a result,  a "cash crisis" is
 in the offing.   Furthermore, un-
 employment is at a postwar rec-
 ord of almost 100,000, and while
 it appears to have reached its
 peak,  it remains a fruitful
 topic for Communist agitation
 and criticism.
 The Sukselainen government
 remains in office largely because
 the other non-Communist parties
 fear a new cabinet crisis might
 reopen the question of Communist
 participation,   There has been
 considerable talk about broaden-
 ing the cabinet, and informal
 discussions may be going on.
 Fagerholm apparently is seeking
 to prepare the way for future
 participation in the government
 by reconciling the divergent
 elements within his Social Demo-
 cratic party and by making it
 more acceptable to the USSR.
 However,   progress  in  heal-
 ing                                                      the        schisms  within the
 party  and the    trade  unions

 may be an important psycholog-

 activity could be triggered by
 the government's program to re-

 to qualify for aid from the In-
 ternational Monetary Fund, or
 by layoffs of surplus workers
 aimed at lowering production
 costs to enable Spain to com-

 The illegal Spanish Commu-
 nist party--with an estimated
 membership of some 5,000--will
 probably try to persuade the
 moderate opposition groups to
 support  nationwide  strike
 action  in  the  next  few
 weeks.  These  groups  have
 heretofore been reluctant to
 collaborate with the Communists,
 but, if strikes seem likely,
 they may feel obligated to co-
 operate to some extent with
 the Communists, who are the
 best organized of all the
 clandestine parties.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 STATUS OF THE FRENCH COMMUNIST PARTY
 The French Communist party
 (PCF) still retains a mass elec-
 toral following and the most
 extensive political organiza-
 tion in France despite the vir-
 tual elimination of the party's
 National Assembly representa-
 tion in the November elections
 and its lesser setbacks in
 March, when it was ousted from
 numerous municipal administra-
 tions.   These defeats have
 caused serious financial prob-
 lems and encouraged criticism
 among the rank and file over
 the rigidity of party leader-
 ship.
 The top leaders, however,
 have shown little disposition
 to change party policies and
 seem to be counting instead on
 dissatisfaction with the gov-
 ernment's economic program--
 such as occurred to some ex-
 tent in the March elections--
 to restore Communist influence.
 Electoral Decline
 The greatest blow to the
 PCF has been the marked drop
 in its electoral strength. Un-
 der the Fourth Republic, it
 could count on at least one
 quarter of the electorate in
 national elections, but in both
 the constitutional referendum
 last September and the National
 Assembly  elections
 in November, the Com-
 munist vote was well
 under 20 percent, The
 party's loss of po-
 litical power is
 more apparent in the
 reduction of PCF dep-
 uties from 144 to
 10, and in the large
 inroads made in Com-
 munist strength on
 municipal councils
 under the new major-
 ity electoral sys-
 tem.   The result i,,~,
 a severe financial
 and patronage loss to the
 party.
 There was a swing back
 to Communist candidates in the
 municipal elections last month,
 largely because of the popular-
 ity of some local Communist
 personalities and discontent
 with the government's austerity
 program.   On the second round,
 moreover, the Communists unex-
 pectedly benefited from the ma-
 jority system to win some towns
 they had not previously con-
 trolled.                                                                 They were eliminated,
 however,  from many municipal
 posts in smaller towns where
 they had long been entrenched.
 In the elections of 26
 April for the Senate, which is
 chosen by communal and depart-
 mental representatives, the
 Communists will probably win
 at most one or two seats.
 Party Organization
 The top leadership and the
 hard-core organization of the
 PCF have thus far remained vir-
 tually unchanged by France's
 political upheavals, and mem-
 bership is apparently stabi-
 lized at about 250,000, as com-
 pared. with the 5-6,000,000 votes
 the party was able to attract
 under the Fourth Republic. The

 of calling on rank-and-file
 Socialists to abandon their own
 leaders and join the Communists
 in a mass opposition movement.
 Dissatisfied Party Supporters
 Since 1956, many PCF sup-
 porters have been criticizing
 the party for being too rigid,
 and in recent months they have
 expressed dissatisfaction over
 the party's "unrealistic" or
 "obscure" guidelines.   Self-
 justification on the part of
 the leaders after the electoral
 debacles led to a, public airing
 of "left-wing" dissidence in
 the "Sorbonne cell" of the PCF.
 The cell challenged the "blind
 optimism" of the party direc-
 tors, their conservatism, their
 "wrong concept" of political
 unity, their servility toward
 the Soviet Union, and their
 "incapacity to produce a Marx-
 ist analysis" of the French sit-
 uation.   Disciplinary action
 against this cell has been fol-
 lowed up in party publications
 by warnings to other opposition
 elements.
 Criticism by Communist sym-
 pathizers seems to have been
 widespread, however, judging
 from a poll conducted by the
 monthly Realites among French-
 men who are not members of the
 party but who normally vote for
 the PCF.   They complained about
 the clannish, conservative, self-
 perpetuating party bureaucracy,
 and indicated that their loyalty
 had been reduced to a matter of
 feeling their own interests bet-
 ter protected by the Communists
 tharL by some other alternative,
 such as De Gaulle.
 Prospects
 PCF leaders may indulge in
 some "self-criticism'? at the
 party congress scheduled for
 27-31 May, but it seems unlikely
 there will be any major changes
 in party organization or policy,
 especially in view of the good
 reception given by Moscow to the
 French delegation which attended
 the Soviet 21st party congress.
 PCF leaders seem to be count-
 ing rather on the growth of mass
 dissatisfaction with the De
 Gaulle regime to restore the
 party's position.  Having al-
 ready made an electoral come-
 back between November and March
 as a result of the government's
 austerity program and having
 maintained their labor union
 strength unimpaired, they are
 probably confident of profiting
 from any marked deterioration
 of the French economic situa-
 tion.   Their propaganda sug-
 gests that they also hope to
 gain from any decided swing to-
 ward a rightist, authoritaria
 government.

 UNREST. AMONG PALESTINE REFUGEES
 Recent rioting and strikes
 in Jordan and Lebanon again em-

 tially disruptive influence of
 the Arabs who were displaced
 during the Palestine war of
 1948.  Their "temporary" sta-

 supporting the refugees, ex-
 pires on 30 June 1960.   The is-
 sue of continuing international
 support of the refugees beyond
 that date is being considered
 by UN officials. Secretary
 General Hammarskjold plans to
 recommend at the General Assem-
 bly meeting in September.. the
 continuation of UNRWA with some
 minor adjustments.
 The Arab refugees now ex-
 ceed one million according to
 UNRWA, and over half of them
 are living in Jordan.   The re-
 mainder live in Syria, Lebanon,
 and the Gaza strip administered
 by the UAR.  About 70 percent
 of those in Jordan live in West
 Jordan, the area of mandated
 Palestine which did not become
 part of Israel.
 Jordan's refugee
 problem has contr.ib-
 uted : si:gnif icantly to
 the country's inter-
 nal'instability. Fur-
 ther complicating the
 situation is the fact
 that 180,000 frontier
 villagers, not tech-'
 nically defined as
 refugees, are never-
 theless "economic
 refugees" because
 they lost lands which
 now lie on the other
 side of the truce
 line.   UNRWA regards
 these people as the
 most destitute ele-
 ments in Jordan.  A
 total of 270,000 Jor-
 danian refugees are
 not eligible for
 UNRWA aid.
 Rioting in Jor-
 dan occurred late in
 March when Jordanian
 supervisors of UNWRA
 activities were set-
 verely beaten by sev-
 eral refugees who had
 been caught stealing
 and giving short weight
 to relief items. Sub-
 sequently, a threat-
 ened strike and a
 walkout'of students
 at a UNRWA-operated
 commercial training school in
 Jordan resulted in closure of
 the school.   Most of the stu-
 dent strikers came from Nablus,
 long a center of Communist ac-
 tivity among refugees, whose
 living conditions make them
 easy prey for Communist propa-
 ganda and recruitment.   Jorda.ni-
 an  police made several arrests
 and confiscated considerable
 Communist literature there on 1
 April.
 Revelation during the riot
 that the refugees had weapons
 indicates that considerable
 blood might be shed if fighting
 between Communist and pro-Nasir
 refugee elements should break
 out as a result of the Iraqi-UAR
 dispute.   Refugee unrest has also
 been evident in Lebanon where, in

 December and again in late Jan-
 uary, a strike, or boycott, of
 UNRWA services occurred when
 refugees demanded various chang-
 es in the agency's activities,
 administrative procedures, and
 personnel.
 The refugees as a whole
 remain determined to achieve
 their "rights," includingire-
 patriation to their former
 homes in Palestine and compen-
 sation for the losses they have
 suffered.   Most of them resist
 integration where they now re-
 side; they continue to equate:
 any rehabilitation scheme with
 abandonment of their political
 rights.   They are supported in
 this  attitude  by  the  Arab
 states' official policies..

 of~-:.an{..intetpal threat to its,
 security.   Last November, how-
 25X1
 ever, the Israelis expressed a
 willingness to compensate the
 refugees without insisting, as
 previously, that such payments
 be part of a general Arab-Israeli
 peace settlement.   The offer was
 subject to the conditions that
 the displaced Arabs remain out-
 side Israel and that inte.rtia-
 tional financial assistance
 would be made available to help
 settle their claims.
 The prospect of significant
 progress toward reaching a set-
 tlement of the ,refugee issue
 remains remote.   A recent re-
 port regarding UNRWA's activ..
 ities in Jordan states that the
 agency long ago was forced to
 abandon its earlier dreams of
 accomplishing its mission through
 large-scale works programs that
 would integrate the refugees in
 the Arab world.   The report con-
 cludes With the 'observation that
 ne j. the r a long-range solution of
 the Arab refugee problem nor a
 successor organization to UNRWA

 The Greek economy will be
 in a precarious position through-
 out 1959.   A continuing deteri-
 oration of the country's for-
 eign+exchange':position, the ma-
 jor problem facing Athens, is
 not likely to be reversed, and
 the government will push hard
 for more American aid.   Barring
 both a substantial and sustained
 'rise in the level of investment,
 which the Greeks alone cannot
 achieve, there may be a loss of
 popular confidence and a return
 to the chaotic economic dondi-
 tions which prevailed before
 the stabilization program was
 begun in 1952.
 Basic Instability
 Although economic activity
 has expanded steadily in the
 past few years, Athens has made
 little progress in eliminating
 the iountry's basic weaknesses.
 The gross national product, in
 real terms, has risen More than
 5 percent annually since 1955.
 The increase,however, was dis-
 tributed unevenly, causing eco-
 nomic discontent and fostering
 the growth of the extreme left.

 deremployed and unemployed per-
 sons now amount to about 25
 percent of the labor force.
 The archaic landowning sys-
 tem also restricts agricultural
 output.   More than two thirds
 of the family farms are less
 than 12 acres in-size,  usually
 of widely separated
 strips.   Despite the

 Industrial pro-
 duction in 1958 was
 60 percent higher
 than in 1953, but ag-
 ricultural production
 fell in 1958, holding
 down the over-all rise
 in gross national
 product for the year.
 Gross national prop=
 duct had increased 9
 percent in 1957, when
 agricultural output
 was relatively high,
 compared with less
 than 5 percent the

 Problem
 Greek  gold
 and foreign-exchange
 holdings have con-
 tinued to decline
 since 1956, dropping
 by $23,000,000 in
 1958.   While exports
 are expected to in-
 crease in 1959,16wer
 remittances from ship-
 ping and a higher
 level of imports prob-
 ably will produce a
 further loss of $10,-
 000,000 to $15,000,-
 000 by the end of the
 year.   Reserves now
 are barely adequate
 to cover imports for
 three or four months
 and are below the
 $180,000,000 considered "safe"
 by officials of the Interna-
 tional Monetary Fund.

 posits--from about $19,000,000
 in 19153 to over $180,000,000 by
 the end of 1958.
 These officials have been
 concerned that even a modest
 reduction below the "safe"
 level might underminerconfi-
 dence in the national currency.
 Thus far, however, there has
 been no loss of confidence,
 partially because the Greek
 Government has been making
 overoptimistic  statements to
 the press which, according to
 Prime Minister Karamanlis, are
 inconsistent with the facts of
 the economic situation.
 The confidence of the
 Greek public in the currency
 is a relatively new develop-
 ment.   Greece has been subject
 to violent economic and politi-
 cal fluctuations,especially
 since World War II.   Such fluc-
 tuations have conditioned the
 public to hoard gold and other
 "real assets" and to accept
 periodic flights of capital as
 a reality of economic life.
 The drastic currency devalua-
 tion of 1953 and the resultant
 surface stability, however, en-
 gendered confidence and caused
 In the interests of retain-
 ing this new public confidence
 in the Greek drachma, Athens is
 reluctant to take measures, such
 as sharply restricting imports,
 which could precipitate a rtish to
 withdraw funds.   Thus a portion
 of the loss in the gold and for-
 eign exchange reserves is ac-
 counted for by payments for im-
 ports of consumer goods.  A move
 to restrict imports drastically
 is not considered' economically
 and politically feasible by the
 government.
 Balance of Payments
 Even under favorable con-
 ditions, Greek exports rarely
 cover half of the costs of the
 country's imports.   Last year's
 imports were $300,000,000 more
 than exports..   Athens must rely
 largely on earnings from ship-
 ping and,more recently, on the
 tourist trade, and remittances
 from emigrants. .,These funds,

 wide shipping depression.   In
 late 1958, 10,000 Greek seamen
 and about 480 Greek-owned ships
 were idle.
 This year imports are
 likely to rise by at least 8
 percent, and, although exports
 should rise, the gap will widen
 substantially.   Even with an
 appreciable increase in the
 amount of American aid utilized
 this year, Athens will find it
 necessary to use its dwindling
 foreign exchange reserves to
 pay for imports.   The tighter
 import controls inaugurated in
 August 1958 have, however, re-
 duced new credit granted to
 Greek importers by foreign firms.
 Prospects
 Measures taken by the gov-
 ernmebt,`to conserve the coun-
 try's foreign exchange holdings
 are inadequate, and Athens bar-
 ring increased Western aid, may
 face a crisis by midsummer;.
 The government probably fears
 further limitation on imports
 of consumer goods would be ex-
 ploited by the opposition and
 by the growing extreme left
 wing.   Even if imp its are cut
 back sharply,  the   anger of a
 sudden economic crisis would
 persist, since the Greek economy
 is dependent on a high-level of
 economic activity in Europe and
 the world generally.
 Greek Government officials
 claim their country can do noth-
 ing more on its own to avoid a
 possible economic crisis; they
 point out that Athens has al-
 ready adopted sound monetary
 and fiscal policies and liberal-
 ized' its trade and payments ar-
 rangements in accordance with
 American wishes.   These officials
 note that a crisis might tempo-
 rarily be averted if certain do-
 mestic economic measures were
 taken.   Such moves, they assert,
 would result in a serious loss
 of confidence in the country's
 economy and would cause dis-
 astrous results.   In the short
 run, Greece will seek increased
 American aid--$30,000,000 more
 in defense aid alone in fiscal
 1960 thab in 1959.
 Over the long run, Greek
 economic  development  in  pro-
 ductive                                                               areas   will have  to
 be  speeded up and  increased
 consumption  postponed.   Any
 move,   to hold  down the
 rising   Greek standard   of
 living--still  the  lowest in
 Western  Europe--probably
 would  diminish  further  the

 SINO-SOVIET BLOC FOREIGN TRADE PRICING PRACTICES
 The Sino-Soviet bloc's
 foreign trade pricing practices
 are designed primarily to ac-
 quire scarce foreign exchange
 rather than to disrupt the
 free world's economic stability.
 The bloc's aim is to expand
 existing markets or open new
 ones: in order to pay in hard
 currencies for stepped-up pur-
 chases of free world goods re-
 quired for its ambitious in-
 dustrialization programs.   In
 a period of general economic
 contraction, as in late 1957
 and 1958, this can occur. only
 at the expense of free world
 suppliers, whose prices are
 sometimes undercut severely
 by bloc traders.in order to
 gain a foothold in Western
 markets.
 The bloc probably would
 not sacrifice export earnings
 for any extended period by un-
 loading large quantities of
 goods at bargain prices in order
 to disrupt Western economic
 life.   Such large-scale price-
 cutting would mean a large re-
 duction in bloc foreign exchange
 receipts.   This does not mean,
 however,  that a bloc country
 would not cut its price over a
 considerable period in order
 to oust a free world supplier
 permanently from a given com-
 modity market in a particularly
 important target country.
 There is abundant evidence
 that bloc firms have engaged
 in vigorous price-cutting, oc-
 casionally offering discounts
 of. 20 percent or more under
 prevailing prices, in order to
 overcome various obstacles in
 expanding sales or marketing
 their goods abroad.   This action
 on occasion has reduced the
 earnings of certain free world
 producers and temporarily dis-
 rupted some free world com-
 modity markets.   Allegations
 PART III
 that bloc countries are engaged
 in dumping--selling goods abroad
 below domept.le;.pri ces ror costs--
 are:.-virt Tally,unprovable; because
 the -blocd's' foreign prices are pur-
 posely !,isolated, from: internal
 places`or',production costs.
 Most, if not all, of the
 commodities which the USSR has
 recently offered the West in
 exceptionally large quantities
 have at least two features in
 common.   First, they are in
 easy supply, relative to present
 bloc needs; second, the Western
 commodities affected by Soviet
 sales have been characterized
 by limited competition among
 sellers and artificially high
 prices, even in depressed mar-
 kets,   Thus it appears that
 Soviet sales are not being used
 as a means of disrupting the
 economic stability of the free
 world, but as a more efficient
 means of acquiring necessary
 foreign exchange.
 Soviet Sales in Western Europe
 Exceptionally large sup-
 plies of tin, aluminum, asbes-
 tos, and other commodities were.
 offered in 1957 and 1958 by the
 USSR for sale in Western
 Europe--in:-.some cases at prices
 considerably below those pre-
 vailing on the world markets.
 The Soviet justification
 for the more extreme examples
 of price-cutting is that the
 inability of the USSR to guar-
 antes long-term continuity of
 supply makes Western buyers
 unwilling to transfer purchases
 from their normal sources of
 supply to the USSR except at
 bargain prices.   The commodi-
 ties offered by the USSR are
 most often those whose prices
 have been maintained artifi-
 cially despite the recession
 and thus afford   the  :best

 opportunity for acquiring for-
 eign exchange.
 The unprecedented quantity
 of tin offered by the USSR in
 1957-58 for sale in the West
 seriously disrupted the already
 depressed Western market.   Be-
 fore its tin was accepted for
 trading in organized markets,
 the USSR priced this commodity
 below that of free world pro-
 ducers.   With the acceptance
 of Soviet tin on the London
 Metals Exchange, however, its
 sale to the free world at pre-
 vailing market prices was guar-
 anteed, thus raising the price.
 In 1955 the USSR for the
 first time became a net ex-
 porter of aluminum, and since
 that time its sales have of-
 fered increasing competition
 to the major Western producers.
 In 1958 the leading Canadian
 producer cut its price for the
 first time in ten years; the
 USSR responded by offering to
 undersell all bidders by 10
 percent.   In contrast to this
 practice of cutting prices in
 the face of a declining market,
 the USSR charged premium prices
 when aluminum was in short
 supply in 1955.   In both sit-
 uations the prime Soviet ob-
 jective was to maximize foreign
 exchange earnings.
 Western producers of as-
 bestos and flax also have felt
 the impact of large Soviet ex-
 ports since 1956.   Asbestos
 sales, made at reported dis-
 counts of 20 to 25 percent,
 cut deeply into the Western
 European markets of Canada's
 several large producers.
 Chinese Sales in South Asia
 Over the past several
 years,  increasing quantities
 of mainland Chinese goods have
 appeared on South Asian markets
 in direct competition with tradi-
 tional suppliers.   To gain mar-
 kets for their textiles and
 light manufactures, Communist
 China's trade companies have
 offered low prices which permit
 local merchants to profit from
 sizable mark-ups.   Attractive
 credit terms have been arranged
 through local offices of-
 "Com-munist-owned branches of the
 Bank of China.
 Through such inducements,
 South Asian imports from Commu-
 nist China in 1958 increased
 11 percent above those in 1957.
 Although such purchases continue
 to be less than 3 percent of
 the area's total imports, Pei-
 ping's trade balance there pro-
 vides it with foreign exchange
 to be used to pay for its rapidly
 expanding purchases from Western
 Europe.
 The difficulties encoun-
 tered by the traditional sup-
 pliers in South Asian markets,
 however, cannot be attributed
 in any great degree to Chinese
 competition.   Their problems
 result largely from the general
 deterioration in economic con-
 ditions in the area, which is
 an outgrowth of the general
 decline in world commodity
 prices and the'mounting inter-
 nal economic problems in in-
 dividiual countries.
 In 1957 and 1958 there was
 a decline in the world market
 prices of major exports and con-
 sequently foreign exchange earn-
 ings of the South Asian countries.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 9 April 1959
 BULGARIA INTENSIFIES ECONOMIC PACE
 Since early October 1958,
 Bulgaria has made tortuous ef-
 forts to launch a program in
 the spirit of the USSR's Seven-
 Year Plan.   Whereas the old ad-
 ministrative structure and
 tempos of development were "cor-
 rect" for a country making the
 "transition from a capitalist
 to a socialist society," new
 ones now are required which will
 reflect the "victory of social-
 ism" in Bulgaria.  .
 With this ideological jus-
 tification and patterns provid-
 ed by the Seven-Year Plan, Bul-
 garia  has embarked on a cam-
 paign to fulfill its new Five-
 Year Plan in three to four years.
 Its "great leap forward" has
 astronomical production targets
 in many fields and calls for a
 sweeping administrative reorgan-
 ization, ostensibly designed to
 decentralize economic and polit-
 ical controls,
 ers, however, did not feel this
 drive was sufficient either to
 cope with pressing internal prob-
 lems or to fulfill the country's
 share in the new economic surge
 called for by the Soviet Seven-
 Year Plan.   Party First Secre-
 tary Todor Zhivkov on 11 Novem-
 ber told another plenum of the
 central committee that a Bul-
 garian "great leap forward" was
 necessary.
 Concerned with creating the
 "material and spiritual precon-
 ditions" for beginning the gradu-
 al transition to Communism in
 five or six years, the "leap"
 involves all aspects of politi-
 cal,  economic, and cultural life.
 It calls for drastically in-
 creased production goals and
 seeks to enroll all the people
 through such measures as the
 obligatory donation of 30 days'
 free manual or "production" la-
 bor a year and through the in-
 troduction of continuous work
 shifts in industry.
 The collective-farm amal-
 gamation program having been
 virtually completed by mid-De-
 cember, Zhivkov addressed a set
 of theses to the central commit-
 tee at yet another plenum on 15-
 17 January 1959, which called
 for broad administrative and
 economic reorganization of Bul-
 garia along the lines of the
 decentralization Khrushchev or-
 dered in the USSR.   Bulgaria's
 program contains many Bulgarian
 innovations.   The new "adminis-
 trative-economic" region, with
 its general competence over most
 facets of life within its ter-
 ritory, is an expansion of So-
 viet efforts at decentralization
 embodied in the sovnarkhoz.
 Bulgaria's "Leap Forward"
 A special plenum of the
 party central committee, meet-
 ing from 2 to 4 October, called
 for a gradual amalgamation of
 the country's approximately 3,400
 oollective'farms in a :drive to
 fulfill  ahead of schedule the
 Third Five-Year Plan presented
 in June 1958,   Bulgaria's lead-
 The program finally enacted
 by the National Assembly in Febru-
 ary and March, however, does not
 have the radical exuberance of
 the speeches and press comments
 of November and December.

 of excessive local

 evident in his 10
 March report to the
 assembly, in which
 he admitted that "ex-

 curred in the amal-

 a "mechanical" crea-

 How It Came About

 stimuli was the bloc's
 pressure to bring Bul-
 garia's planning cycle
 into accord with those
 of the other European
 satellites, which are
 scheduled to begin new
 plans around 1961.
 Mere fulfillment
 ahead of schedule,
 however, would not of
 itself eliminate the
 serious weaknesses
 which both Soviet and
 Bulgarian officials
 have frequently cited
 in the Bulgarian ad-
 ministrative structure,
 mainly the almost strangling
 growth of red tape and bureauc-

 spreading gradually into the
 lower party echelons, has also
 centered on the problem of un-
 employment and on the disparity
 between living conditions and
 salaries of party or government
 officials and those of common
 peasants or laborers..

 with the party and its program,
 which obviously has not been
 able to fulfill the many prom-
 ises of a better future. This
 disillusion has crystallized
 in demands for reform, which
 caused the Bulgarian leaders,
 acting on the Chinese example,
 to introduce such "leveling"
 features as the "voluntary" la-
 bor schemes.   Talk about a raise
 in the minimum wage, a cut in
 the salaries of top officials,
 and a guaranteed monthly and
 yearly income reflect a similar
 stimulus.
 Factionalism Not an Issue
 Vulko Chervenkov, who in
 the past had been mentioned prom-
 inently as leading a faction in
 the party, now is reported to
 be gradually losing his influ-
 ence. The long-standing mutual
 dislike of Khrushchev and Cher-
 venkov,  which is credited with
 blocking Chervenkov's attempts
 to replace Zhivkov as first
 secretary, has become common
 knowledge in the middle and
 lower party ranks.   These func-
 tionaries now feel less compul-
 sion to cater to Chervenkov's
 wishes, realizing that he can
 never resume the first secretary-
 ship as long as Khrushchev is
 in power.
 Although Zhivkov has the
 firm support of Khrushchev,
 he  'may,  not  be  confident:
 of the loyalty of those func-
 tionaries who once were firm
 supporters of Chervenkov, and
 the likelihood of a gradual
 easing of these people from po-
 sitions of power should not be
 discounted.
 The extent in the rank and
 file of "liberal" opposition to
 the leadership is unclear. While
 the reversion to more demand-
 ing policies over the last six
 months would indicate at best
 the temporary eclipse of those
 who might favor a more liberal
 policy if given the opportunity

 some support from the party
 ranks.
 Kostovism, described as a
 vague feeling rather than an
 organized movement, takes its
 name from Traicho Kostov, second-
 .ranking Bulgarian Communist be-
 fore his execution in 1949 for
 advocating more independence
 from Moscow.   It is doubtful
 that "Kostovism" will in the
 foreseeable future crystallize
 into a movement, however, if
 only because there is no practi-
 cal alternative to continued
 subservience to Moscow.

 answer to the popular clamor for
 reform and for improvement in

 the standard of living, the pro-
 gram 'actually negates these
 effects by placing intense pres-
 sures on all the people.         While
 the regime has decreed the grad-
 ual abolition of the labor-day
 system of payments for the col-
 lective farmers in favor of a
 guaranteed minimum monthly and
 annual wage,'and the increased
 production demanded is supposed
 to result in higher incomes,
 the "leap" will require the farm-
 ers to work more diligently than
 in the past during the winter
 months on local improvement
 projects and, where possible,
 in local industry.
 There is little evidence
 of active opposition during the
 past winter to the increased de-
 mands on the farmers, although
 the press revealed that many
 of the scheduled mass labor pxtoj-
 ects were not completed by the
 beginning of the planting sea-
 son.   Whether because of poor
 preparation or because the goals
 were completely unrealistic, the
 targeted doubling of agricultur-
 al production in 1959 has been
 cut back to a "mere" 74-percent
 increase over the 1958 figure.
 While this may be more realis-
 tic goal,  its achievement is
 probably impossible.
 The regime has stated that
 in the future the minimum month-
 ly wage for industrial workers
 will be raised from 400 to 600
 leva (about $88), and that in
 most industries the workweek
 will be reduced gradually from
 six to five days.   On the other
 hand, the regime apparently in-
 tends immediately to force the
 workers to produce more and
 better.   The anticipated wage
 reform will undoubtedly be ac-
 companied by higher production
 quotas.
 Intelligentsia and Youths
 The two potentially most
 dissident groups, the intelli-
 gentsia and the youths, are
 also to be enrolled in the
 "leap."  Having stamped out the
 last surviving dissidence in
 the Writers' Union early last
 year, the regime now can call
 for an advancement in cultural
 work in' all fields to reflect
 the "popular upsurge."  Fre-
 quent critical press attacks
 suggest that these two groups
 are not cooperating fully.^
 Bulgaria's youths continue
 to be the primary object of re-
 gime dissatisfaction.   The Dimi-
 trov Union of Communist Youth
 was revamped at its ninth con-
 gress and now ruling bodies were
 set up.   In the period from
 October to January, Zhivkov told
 the union it was necessary to
 recruit all youths into the
 "leap;" implying that they must
 play the major role in stamping
 out "bourgeois" tendencies among
 the young people.   That this
 goal has not been achieved is
 indicated by Zhivkov's remarks
 to the National Assembly on 10
 March.   Speaking of the necessity
 to maintain the powers of in-
 ternal security organs, he said
 the punitive measures must be
 increased--"particularly con-
 cerning the youths-.-"
 Lack of enthusiasm among
 youths for the "leap forward"
 and for Communism in general--
 as evidenced by the popularity
 of Western culture--worries the
 regime, which therefore intends
 to combat these "manifestations"
 not only by the youth union, but
 also by the schools and by the
 state.   The proposed reorganiza-
 tion of Bulgaria's educational
 system along the lines of the
 proposed Soviet reorganization,
 designed to create a "love of
 labor" among youths, will mean
 that students will be educated
 for assuming specific jobs and
 will be required to spend part
 of the educational year in "on-
 the-job training."
 Students' leisure time will
 be taken up in union activities
 and "voluntary" labor projects.
 Many of the projects will be
 assigned to the Youth Brigades,
 which were ordered in March to
 expand so as to include consid-
 erably more than the 100,000
 youths who participated in 1958.
