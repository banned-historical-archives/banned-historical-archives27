 New Thinking
 Sino-Soviet Relations:
 Impact of Gorbachev's
 relationship.
 In his speech at Vladivostok in July 1986, General Secretary Gorbachev
 made it clear that Moscow intends to increase its influence in Asia and ex-
 ert itself as an Asian political and economic actor rather than just as a mil-
 itary power. The chief target of Soviet courtship in Asia is China.
 Although efforts to improve Sino-Soviet relations began under General
 Secretary Brezhnev, a watershed was reached in 1986 when Moscow
 agreed to discuss Beijing's "three obstacles" to improved relations-the
 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Moscow's support for Vietnam's occupa-
 tion of Cambodia, and the Soviet military buildup in Mongolia and along
 the Sino-Soviet border. Since then, there has been steady progress in the
 ministers, premiers, or presidents.
 The range and level of political contacts between Soviet and Chinese
 officials have grown, and cultural and other nonpolitical contacts are now
 almost daily occurrences. Border tensions have been reduced, progress has
 been made on the border demarcation issue, and each side has begun to
 portray publicly the other's experience in economic reform in a positive
 light. Although Beijing continues to resist Moscow's calls for a summit and
 resumption of party-to-party ties, there is an increased likelihood of a high-
 level visit to one capital or the other within the next year by foreign
 military contact.
 Both sides seek a stable, nonconfrontational environment in order to
 concentrate on domestic reforms and modernization. They also seek to use
 improved relations to increase their leverage with Washington and other-
 wise improve their respective ability to maneuver within the Sino-Soviet-
 US strategic triangle. The Soviets may still have some hope of bringing the
 Chinese back into the "socialist" fold, but for now and the foreseeable
 future they would settle for a China that follows a middle course between
 the United States and the USSR. In the near term, Moscow would like the
 array of Sino-Soviet contacts to match China's existing relationships with
 the United States-including regular high-level visits and some form of
 Moscow is probably pleased with the progress in relations to date and is un-
 likely to try to force the current pace by making a characteristic "grand
 gesture." Domestic constraints and the risk of damaging relations with
 third-country allies limit the areas in which Gorbachev can even make such
 a gesture. For example, he would face opposition from the military to

 making significant unilateral troop cuts along the border and would be
 unlikely to wage such a domestic battle for an uncertain Chinese re-
 sponse-although constraints are not as great to additional drawdowns
 from the relatively small number of Soviet troops stationed in Mongolia.
 The Soviets, in our view, are also not prepared to withhold economic or mil-
 itary support to Hanoi in an effort to prod the Vietnamese out of
 Cambodia; Moscow does not want to damage its overall relationship with
 Vietnam and is especially reluctant to risk losing access to Cam Ranh Bay.
 Beijing, for its part, is not prepared to respond with a grand gesture of its
 own and would resent Moscow's efforts to force relations forward in this
 way. The Soviets, therefore, are likely to continue to nudge the Chinese to
 upgrade relations by making small unilateral gestures to ensure that
 progress continues toward eventual rapprochement. These could include
 concessions on the border dispute, more movement on a Cambodian
 settlement, or a small withdrawal from the border.
 Although Moscow would probably not offer militarily significant unilateral
 troop cuts along the Sino-Soviet border as a concession, several factors
 could persuade it to consider and implement smaller cuts if the political cli-
 mate were right for such a gesture. Even with small cuts, the Soviets could
 retain an overall advantage in air and ground forces along the border. The
 political leadership, already pressuring the Soviet military to reduce and
 conserve resources, may conclude that reducing tensions along the Sino-
 Soviet frontier is one of the conditions necessary to allow the reallocation of
 some resources from the military to the civilian sector.
 In our view, a resolution of the territorial dispute along the border is a pre-
 requisite to any significant troop cuts in the region but would not
 necessarily block additional troop cuts in Mongolia. Gorbachev could face
 opposition from within the leadership, however, to making more conces-
 sions on troop withdrawals or on the territorial issues. He is unlikely to
 make any bold moves on the disputed islands and "throw away" what could
 be an important bargaining chip in the future for an uncertain Chinese
 response. Gorbachev would probably first need tangible evidence of
 Chinese willingness to agree to a mutually acceptable border accord and
 assurances that the Chinese would be willing to seriously discuss mutual
 force reductions along the border.
 Beijing appears to have decided that Gorbachev is sincerely striving to
 reduce Sino-Soviet tensions as part of his'effort to create a more peaceful
 international environment in which to pursue domestic reform. Chinese
 Kremlin-watchers, however, continue to debate the extent of Gorbachev's

 flexibility and his staying power in the face of continued opposition at
 home. Beijing may also be concerned that warming US-Soviet relations
 will lessen its leverage in the strategic triangle, and it therefore may be
 more receptive to Soviet efforts to move the Sino-Soviet relationship
 forward. China uses the three obstacles as a tool to control the pace of pro-
 gress in political relations with Moscow. By reserving the right to
 determine whether Soviet actions on the obstacles are significant, Beijing
 can raise or lower the price to Moscow of improved relations. The Chinese
 thus are capable of declaring at any time that Moscow has sufficiently met
 Beijing's concerns on the obstacles to warrant an upgrading of political
 relations.
 We can identify no strong pro-Soviet constituency in the Chinese leader-
 ship, and fear of imperiling crucial trade, technology, and other ties
 between China and the West inhibits even those who would like to see Chi-
 na follow a middle road between the superpowers. Some leaders support
 treating the two superpowers as more or less equivalent, but their
 statements suggest that they are not so much pro-Soviet as suspicious of
 the West.
 Perhaps the most important impediment to full normalization of Sino-
 Soviet relations is the firm opposition of China's top leader, Deng
 Xiaoping. Deng is deeply distrustful of the Soviets and skeptical that
 greatly improved relations with the USSR would yield significant benefits
 for China. We believe he has already achieved his main goal-relaxation of
 tensions on the border. Deng tightly controls Chinese policy toward the
 Soviets, and, while some other senior leaders favor a less restrictive policy,
 they have been unable to influence this issue much. After Deng's death, we
 expect some softening on the Chinese side. For pragmatic reasons-trade
 advantage, cheaper goods, increased leverage in the strategic triangle-
 Deng's successors will probably accelerate China's gradual policy of
 relaxation.
 The Chinese belief that the Soviet Union will remain the principal threat to
 China over the long term and recognition that Soviet and Chinese
 aspirations in Asia will continue to be at odds will prevent a return to the
 alliance relationship of the 1950s. The Chinese are sensitive about their
 sovereignty and position within the socialist community, and, despite Soviet
 assurances that Moscow wants a relationship based on equality, Beijing
 will remain skeptical of Soviet overtures. Both countries need Western
 technology and capital for their respective modernization drives, and
 China, in particular, would be careful not to jeopardize its access to the
 West by entering into an alliance with the Soviets.

 Although a closer relationship may lead Moscow and Beijing to be tougher
 in their bargaining positions with the United. States-especially if both see
 their leverage in the strategic triangle as enhanced by closer relations-
 better Sino-Soviet relations would not necessarily have a negative impact
 on US interests across the board. Should the Soviets and Chinese, for
 example, begin to cooperate on such issues as jointly restraining North
 Korea or pressing Vietnam and the resistance toward a Cambodian
 settlement, this cooperation could have positive implications for stability in
 East Asia.

 Sino-Soviet Relations:
 Impact of Gorbachev's
 New Thinking
 In his speech at Vladivostok in July 1986, General
 Secretary Gorbachev made it clear that Moscow
 intends to increase its influence in Asia and exert
 itself as an Asian political and economic actor rather
 than just as a military power. The chief target of
 Soviet courtship in Asia is China. Both the USSR and
 China seek a stable and nonconfrontational relation-
 ship-especially along their border-to concentrate
 on domestic reforms and modernization. Both sides
 also seek to use their improving relations to increase
 their leverage with Washington and their respective
 ability to maneuver within the Sino-Soviet-US strate-
 gic triangle.
 Moscow seeks a normalization of relations with China
 marked by the resumption of party-to-party ties. It
 has repeatedly called for a summit and would proba-
 bly view one between Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping
 as a major step toward the resumption of party ties
 even though Deng is not the leader of the party. The
 Soviets may still have some hope of eventually bring-
 ing the Chinese back into the "socialist" fold but for
 now and the foreseeable future would gladly settle for
 a China that follows a middle course between the
 United States and the USSR. To this end, Moscow
 would like the array of Sino-Soviet contacts eventual-
 ly to match China's existing relationships with the
 United States-including regular high-level visits and
 some form of military contact. In addition, Moscow
 may want to codify the relationship with a statement
 of principles-similar to the declaration on "basic
 principles of relations" signed by the United States
 and USSR in 1972-that would include some form of
 nonaggression clause.
 Moscow is taking advantage of warming Soviet-US
 relations in the wake of the INF agreement and the
 Soviet-US summits in Washington and Moscow to
 encourage China to respond to Soviet initiatives to
 improve bilateral relations. Gorbachev's call for a
 summit in his interview published in January 1988 in
 the Chinese international relations journal, Liaowang,
 was the first Chinese interview with a Soviet leader in
 more than two decades. It was clearly intended to
 capitalize on any nervousness in Beijing created by
 the Soviet-US summit in Washington to encourage
 the Chinese to upgrade the level of the Sino-Soviet
 political dialogue. Although the Chinese told the US
 Embassy in Beijing that Liaowang did not have prior
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs permission for the inter-
 view and Chinese press accounts of the interview
 omitted Gorbachev's call for a summit, we suspect
 Beijing may have intended to prepare educated Chi-
 nese readers for-and remind the West of-the possi-  25X1
 bility of an eventual breakthrough in Sino-Soviet
 political contacts.
 Moscow, for its part, probably is convinced the publi-
 cation of the interview is proof that Soviet efforts to
 address Beijing's "three obstacles" ' to normalization
 are not being dismissed as merely rhetoric. A Soviet
 Foreign Ministry official told US Embassy officials in
 Moscow in February 1988 that the interview could
 not be interpreted as anything but a "calculated
 political move" by Beijing. Moscow also lost little
 time in highlighting the Moscow summit-which
 occurred two weeks before the 12th round of Sino-
 Soviet normalization talks was scheduled to begin-to
 prod the Chinese to move relations forward.
 The recent warming of US-Soviet relations has, in
 fact, apparently left Beijing wondering about the
 implications for China. Chinese officials and scholars
 have expressed concern to US researchers that Wash-
 ington may devalue its relations with Beijing as
 warmer US-Soviet ties develop and may be less
 receptive to Chinese positions on a range of bilateral    25X1
 ' The "three obstacles" are the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,
 Moscow's support for Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia, and the
 Soviet military buildup in Mongolia and along the Sino-Soviet

 issues, such as technology transfer and Taiwan. The
 Soviet-US summit in Washington and the INF agree-
 ment also coincided with a period of Sino-US tensions
 over Tibet, human rights, family planning, and Wash-
 ington's decision in October 1987 to suspend a
 planned liberalization of sensitive high-technology
 exports to China because of Chinese Silkworm missile
 sales to Iran. Although the United States lifted its
 freeze on further liberalization of technology exports
 to China in March 1988, China may still conclude
 that progress in its relations with the USSR might
 make the United States more responsive to Chinese
 concerns on other issues.
 Political Contacts Growing, Moscow Pushing
 for Party and Military Contacts To Follow
 Under Gorbachev the range and level of political
 contacts have grown, although both sides acknowl-
 edge that such contacts are still limited. Moscow
 began briefing the Chinese after Soviet-US arms
 control talks in Geneva and sent Deputy Foreign
 Minister Rogachev to Beijing after the Reagan-
 Gorbachev summits in Washington and Moscow,
 according to press reports. Moscow and Beijing also
 publicized that they have begun to exchange views on
 regional issues such as Latin America.
 The Soviet and Chinese Foreign Ministers meet regu-
 larly under UN auspices at the opening of the General
 Assembly each year, but China has refused to sched-
 ule the exchange of foreign ministers' visits to each
 other's capitals agreed to in 1985. Foreign Minister
 Shevardnadze and the new Chinese Foreign Minister
 Qian Qichen-previously Vice Foreign Minister and
 chief negotiator at the Sino-Soviet normalization and
 border talks-met in June 1988 at the Third UN
 General Assembly Special Session on Disarmament.
 This represented an additional venue for a meeting,
 although still within the auspices of the United Na-
 tions. Because of Qian's focus and expertise on Soviet
 affairs, Moscow may believe that the promotion in
 April 1988 of Qian Qichen to Foreign Minister is a
 sign that the USSR will play a prominent role in
 Chinese foreign policy and that an exchange of visits
 by the foreign ministers within the next year has
 become more likely. In fact, a Soviet diplomat told
 US Embassy officials in Beijing in early July 1988
 that the Chinese proposed a special vice ministerial
 meeting later in the month to discuss Cambodia and
 that a successful meeting could lead to a meeting of
 foreign ministers in September. It is not clear whether
 such a meeting would be at the United Nations or
 whether it would be a separate meeting in either
 Moscow or Beijing.
 Chinese leaders believe that Gorbachev sincerely de-
 sires better relations and are more receptive to Soviet
 political overtures, although they are still careful to
 avoid any appearance of party-to-party relations. The
 distinction between party and state is often murky,
 and many of the delegates visiting each country serve
 in both a governmental and party capacity. In practi-
 cal terms, the resumption of party-to-party connec-
 tions would probably not accomplish much more than
 transactions through existing government channels,
 but it would be of great symbolic significance. Beijing
 is sensitive about its sovereignty and position within
 the socialist community, and, despite Soviet assur-
 ances that Moscow wants a relationship based on
 equality, Beijing is not ready to move as close to
 Moscow as restored party ties would bring it. Moscow
 tends to handle contacts with the Chinese in party
 channels to ease the way for the formal resumption of
 party ties, while China handles them only in govern-
 mental and nonofficial channels, reiterating that it is
 not ready to restore party ties.
 Soviet press coverage of the Chinese party congress
 and Chinese media treatment of the 70th anniversary
 of the Bolshevik Revolution in the fall of 1987
 illustrate Soviet courting of China through party
 channels and China's positive but cautious response

 At a reception in February 1988 marking the 70th

 Defense Minister Yazov-in a speech subsequently

 ed Soviet courting of China to the military sphere by
 putting a positive gloss on Soviet actions in East Asia
 and stressing positive changes in the military situation
 along the Sino-Soviet border. He noted that the
 elimination of SS-20s in Asia under the INF Treaty
 highlighted Soviet efforts toward military detente in
 Asia and claimed that the Soviets had reduced the
 number of their troops along the Sino-Soviet border in
 addition to the partial withdrawal from Mongolia in

 Chinese and Soviet military officers reportedly met in

 The range and level of economic, cultural, and scien-
 tific exchanges have steadily expanded since a sports
 agreement was signed in 1981. The Chinese have been
 more receptive to Soviet overtures under Gorbachev
 for expanding nonpolitical contacts, and exchanges of
 visits to the respective capitals and even to local areas
 have become almost daily occurrences. Moscow sees
 the trend in exchanges in these areas as setting the
 Bilateral trade increased dramatically, from US $300
 million in 1982 to US $2.6 billion in 1986 (see figure
 1). Although trade declined by roughly 20 percent in
 1987, the Soviets expect it to rise by 25 percent in
 1988-a realistic expectation in our view-bringing it
 back roughly to 1986 levels. A number of factors
 contributed to the decline in 1987:
 ? Tight domestic grain supplies constrained Beijing's
 ability to meet export commitments.
 ? Chinese dissatisfaction with the quality and techni-
 cal level of Soviet industrial equipment postponed
 many of the 24 industrial cooperation projects slated
 to take place under the five-year accord signed in
 July 1985.
 ? Trade reform and decentralization in both countries
 have made it more difficult for Beijing and Moscow
 to ensure that individual factories and trade corpo-
 rations adhere to trade commitments made at the
 central level.
 According to the US Embassy in Moscow, a Soviet
 official predicted in February 1988 that trade will
 return to the 1986 level but will not go beyond that in
 the near future, even if the countries iron out some of
 the specific problems that arose in 1987. Temporary
 disruptions resulting from the recent reorganization of
 Soviet foreign trade mechanisms, lack of quality
 products to trade, and lack of real experience in
 modern economics all pose growth constraints on
 trade in the near term. In the long term, both the
 USSR and China consider their access to Western
 technology and trade to be more valuable than their    25X1

 have already surfaced.
 In 1987, Soviet exports consisted primarily of machin-
 ery, transport equipment, and industrial inputs. The
 rise in Chinese exports to the USSR resulted primari-
 ly from large increases in food deliveries and large
 quantities of clothing and basic textile products (see
 figure 2). Beijing is also particularly interested in
 Soviet technology in the energy and heavy-industry
 sectors and could benefit from Soviet assistance in      25X1

 Calculating Sino-Soviet Trade Figures
 As with trade among most other socialist countries,
 the USSR and China exchange goods on a clearing-
 account basis. This practice is tantamount to a barter
 system since it provides for the exchange of goods for
 other goods with no currency changing hands. Tem-
 porary imbalances may occur but are expected to be
 settled over the course of future trade patterns. The
 Sino-Soviet clearing account is not valued in "trans-
 ferable rubles"-an artificial, nonconvertible unit of
 account tied weakly to world prices-but Swiss
 francs in order to use a neutral currency.
 When converted to dollars, Sino-Soviet trade has
 increased at a rate even faster than called for in
 bilateral trade protocols because of the depreciation
 of the dollar in recent years. Dollar figures for trade
 during the past three years have somewhat overstated
 the expansion of Sino-Soviet exchanges, while figures
 for the early 1980s are probably too low because the
 dollar was appreciating. Therefore, what appears to
 be only a 4 -percent decrease in trade from 1986 to
 1987, when calculated in dollars, actually represents
 a roughly 20 percent decrease when calculated in
 Swiss francs.
 USSR as a good source for low-cost imports in the
 energy and heavy-industry sectors, where Soviet ma-
 chinery and equipment, while not on a par with that
 found in the West, are sufficient for many of China's
 present needs. Sino-Soviet border trade also directly
 helps the depressed economies of border regions that
 cannot compete with the exports of the major populat-
 ed areas and represents trade over and above that
 controlled by the annual bilateral agreements.
 Both sides are cooperating to develop the infrastruc-
 ture to accommodate increased border trade, includ-
 ing a railway link between the capital of Xinjiang
 Autonomous Region in China and the Sino-Soviet
 border through the Dzungarian Gate, which is expect-
 ed to become operational in 1991. According to press
 reports, the USSR plans to provide a loan worth US
 $80 million to help China complete the railway link.
 According to Chinese media, Beijing issued a docu-
 ment in March 1988 designed to facilitate develop-
 ment of Xinjiang's export-oriented economy. Growth
 in border trade, however, is constrained in the near
 term by the limited size of the Soviet East Asian
 market and the limited variety of products manufac-
 tured on both sides of the border.
 Scientific, cultural, and academic exchanges occur
 almost daily in the outlying areas as well as in Beijing
 and Moscow. In May 1988, Soviet Minister of Cul-
 ture Zakharov visited China to sign an intergovern-
 mental plan for cultural cooperation for the period
 1988-90 to further develop these contacts, and Pravda
 editor Viktor Afanasyev led a delegation of journal-
 ists. Exchange visits of youth, trade union, media,
 medical, and Academy of Sciences' delegations have
 also become commonplace. Friendship delegations
 have exchanged visits, and scholars have visited to
 learn about the other country's economic reform
 program. Student exchanges resumed in 1983, and
 contacts between Soviet and Chinese think tanks are
 growing.
 These academic and think-tank exchanges have coin-
 cided with an increase in discussions and commentar-
 ies on the parallel nature of Soviet and Chinese
 reforms. Although each side realizes the limited appli-
 cability of the other's reforms, the fact that Soviet and
 Chinese media over the last two years have portrayed
 them in a positive light is a reversal of the critical
 nature of past commentaries. The Soviets are no
 longer presenting the Soviet model of socialism as
 superior and one to be copied by all socialist countries,
 and the Chinese no longer publicly belittle Soviet
 reform efforts as too little, too late. Soviet media
 portray the parallel interest in economic reform as an
 important area of common ground that can form the
 basis for closer bilateral relations across the board.
 The publication of Deng Xiaoping's selected works in
 the USSR and the publication of Gorbachev's book in
 China further underscore the growing interest in
 learning about one another's experiences with reform.

 diplomats have said that Abel Aganbeg'yan, a promi-
 nent Soviet reform economist, is scheduled to visit
 China in the near future.
 Movement on the Obstacles
 At the ninth round of Sino-Soviet normalization talks
 in October 1986, Moscow altered its approach to
 Beijing's three obstacles to normalized relations by
 publicly abandoning its original position that these
 were "third-country" issues that Moscow was not
 empowered to discuss. Although efforts to improve
 Sino-Soviet relations. began under General Secretary
 Brezhnev, the agreement in 1986 to discuss the three
 obstacles-not just listen to what the Chinese had to
 say about them-was a watershed and paved the way
 for the steady progress in the relationship to date.
 Since that time, the Soviets have withdrawn some
 troops from Mongolia and are withdrawing troops
 from Afghanistan.
 Beijing seems to use the three obstacles as a tool to
 control the pace of progress in political relations. By
 reserving the right to determine whether Soviet ac-
 tions on the obstacles are significant, Beijing can raise
 or lower the price to Moscow of improved relations.
 Beijing thus is capable of declaring at anytime that
 Moscow has sufficiently met China's concerns on the
 obstacles to warrant an upgrading of political rela-
 Evolution of the "Three Obstacles"
 In 1982, China first formally enunciated its concerns
 over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Vietnam's
 invasion of Cambodia, and Soviet troops in Mongolia
 and along the border as obstacles to improved rela-
 tions. Chinese Foreign Ministry officials told US
 Embassy officers in June 1982 that the three issues
 precluded a warming in relations. At the first round
 of Sino-Soviet normalization talks in October 1982,
 the Chinese cited these issues as the three main
 "obstacles" to improved relations. The Soviets
 agreed to listen to what the Chinese had to say but
 contended that these were not appropriate subjects
 for the talks because they involved the internal
 affairs of third countries.
 From 1982 to early 1986, Moscow and Beijing talked
 past each other on the obstacles, and Moscow tried to
 improve relations with Beijing without directly ad-
 dressing them. The Soviets contended that the obsta-
 cles were artificial barriers that the Chinese would
 ignore when it suited them. The Chinese, however,
 remained skeptical of Soviet overtures and continued
 to cite the three obstacles as a statement of their
 concerns, as a way to reassure Washington that they
 remain wary of the Soviets, and as a means of letting
 the Chinese domestic audience know that they have
 not acquiesced to the Soviets.
 tions, possibly to include a summit.
 Cambodia
 The USSR wants an eventual political solution in
 Cambodia,                              but
 Moscow's immediate objective is to convince the
 Chinese that it is trying to address their concerns. To
 this end, the Soviets have stepped up the level of their
 involvement in the search for a negotiated settlement.
 They have not yet, however, appeared willing to strain
 relations with Hanoi by publicly adopting positions
 that could undercut Vietnamese interests or by pri-
 vately threatening Hanoi with reduced military or
 economic aid. Moscow is reluctant to jeopardize its
 own position in Vietnam and risk losing access to Cam
 Ranh Bay-the largest Soviet overseas military facili-
 ty outside the Warsaw Pact-especially if the United
 States retains its bases in the Philippines. Instead,
 Moscow clearly hopes that its highly visible public
 efforts to promote negotiations will be enough to
 convince Beijing of its sincerity:

 Government's five-point peace proposal of October
 1987, which calls for, among other things, a coali-

 tance factions and a senior government post for
 Sihanouk.
 The Soviets may also be resorting to indirect public
 pressure on Hanoi to withdraw from Cambodia. A
 report in the Western press in February 1988 quoted
 an unnamed Soviet diplomat in Beijing as saying that
 Vietnam would withdraw by 1990 because the burden
 of its presence in Cambodia was "intolerable"-
 leaving it ambiguous whether the burden was intoler-
 able to Hanoi or to Moscow. A Soviet Embassy
 official in Beijing told the US Embassy that the
 article was meant as a hint to Vietnam of Moscow's
 dissatisfaction with the Cambodian situation. Despite
 the official's claim that the interview was aimed at
 Hanoi, however, the choice of a diplomat in Beijing to
 give the interview to the Western press suggests that
 the article was intended at least as much to impress
 China and the West as to prod Hanoi. In any case, the
 story was the first public statement by the Soviets
 about the financial burden of Vietnam's occupation of
 Cambodia.
 Moscow may also be moving in private to go a step
 further toward satisfying China's demands that the
 USSR "urge" Vietnam to withdraw.
 Soviets have begun to prod the
 Vietnamese more energetically to seek a political
 settlement. Moscow is asking Hanoi to "retreat some-
 what from its maximum demands" concerning Cam-
 bodia,                      and is talking directly
 to Hanoi's client regime in Phnom Penh about a

 the Chinese
 believe the Soviets are becoming more forthcoming on
 the Cambodian issue. They told Under Secretary of
 State Armacost in November 1987 that the Soviets
 were somewhat more flexible during the discussions in
 Beijing in October 1987. Moscow agreed for the first
 time that Cambodia should emerge as a neutral
 country and offered to help bring about a political
 settlement. In June 1988 a Chinese Foreign Ministry
 official told US Embassy officials that Moscow ap-
 parently had exerted pressure on Vietnam to encour-
 age a partial withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from
 Cambodia-referring to Vietnam's announcement
 that it will withdraw 50,000 troops from Cambodia in
 1988-therefore giving Moscow credit for influencing
 Hanoi's decision.
 Beijing has altered its position on the obstacles some-
 what, from demanding resolution of all obstacles to
 singling out Cambodia as a prerequisite for a summit.
 The Chinese have also changed their rhetoric on the
 Cambodian obstacle, from calling on Moscow to force
 Vietnam to withdraw from Cambodia to calling on
 Moscow to "urge" Vietnam to withdraw
 China continues to cite the
 Cambodian obstacle in order to counter Soviet claims
 of progress in relations. Nevertheless, the fact that
 China has singled out Cambodia as the main obsta-
 cle-and links it alone to a Sino-Soviet summit-
 raises the possibility that progress on this issue could
 create an opening for a breakthrough in political
 relations.
 Beijing has also adjusted its position in the past few
 months to demonstrate a willingness to compromise.

 despite reservations by Pol Pot's faction, the Khmer
 Rouge, which is the most powerful resistance group
 no longer support the Khmer Rouge as the "main
 body" in a future government, although they. do want
 the group to be represented. Although Beijing worries
 that Sihanouk might negotiate an agreement it cannot
 live with, it apparently recognizes that Moscow, by
 pressuring Hanoi and Phnom Penh to negotiate with
 Sihanouk, has taken a step toward accommodating
 Chinese interests.
 Beijing is probably concerned about the increase in
 diplomatic activity on Cambodia in the past few
 months-including Vietnam's latest withdrawal an-
 nouncement and media reports of Vietnam's willing-
 ness to participate in informal talks between the
 Khmer parties and some representatives of the Associ-
 ation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Beijing
 probably prefers to see a continued stalemate in
 Cambodia-an impasse that isolates Hanoi and sus-
 tains Beijing's improved ties to ASEAN-but it does
 not want to be seen as the stumblingblock to a
 settlement. Although reluctant to get directly involved
 in the process, Beijing wants to ensure that its inter-
 ests are protected in any talks on a settlement.
 According to the US Embassy in Beijing, after the
 US-Soviet summit in Moscow, Chinese Foreign Min-
 istry and think-tank officials expressed concern that
 the United States and the USSR were negotiating
 behind China's back on the Cambodian issue. Beijing
 apparently was concerned that it was not kept suffi-
 ciently informed on the Afghan negotiations and
 therefore may be sensitive to the increased diplomatic
 activity on Cambodia.
 In early July 1988 the Chinese appeared to be taking
 a more activist approach to Cambodia. Beijing an-
 nounced a four-point proposal on Cambodia, repre-
 senting a departure from its practice of initiating
 proposals through the Cambodian resistance. The
 proposed special meeting on Cambodia between vice
 foreign ministers also took Soviet diplomats in Beijing
 by surprise since the Chinese had taken a very hard
 line on Cambodia at the normalization talks in mid-
 June, according to US Embassy reporting. Mean-
 while, in addition to the four-point proposal, Chinese
 diplomats in Bangkok are claiming that China will
 cut off material supplies to the Khmer Rouge after a
 complete Vietnamese withdrawal. This offer, howev-
 er, is probably contingent on an end to Hanoi's
 support to People's Republic of Kampuchea forces as
 part of a "freeze" on forces alluded to in China's four-
 point proposal.

 Afghanistan
 Chinese officials have stated                 that 25X1
 the Soviet presence in Afghanistan does not threaten
 China, and Afghanistan has clearly been the least
 important of the obstacles to the Chinese. Neverthe- 25X1
 less, Beijing has reacted positively to Moscow's agree-
 ment to withdraw..Even before this agreement, China
 softened its usual media criticism on the anniversary
 of the Soviet invasion in December 1987, and Chinese
 commentaries have highlighted Soviet efforts to cre-
 ate an acceptable environment for withdrawal. A few
 days after Gorbachev's troop withdrawal statement on
 8 February 1988, China's acting defense attache in
 London told the US Army attache that Beijing would
 be willing to cooperate in moving a settlement for-
 ward, perhaps by participating in an observer force to
 monitor the Soviet withdrawal.
 The Chinese continue to debate Gorbachev's "sinceri-
 ty," but, in the longer term, we believe Soviet adher-
 ence to the Geneva accords will have an impact on
 China's assessment of Moscow. Thus far, however,
 China has given no public signal that it is reevaluating
 its relationship with Moscow because of the Geneva
 accords. In the near term, Beijing apparently is
 employing its traditional strategy of asking for more
 once its original conditions have been met. A 16 May
 1988 Chinese news agency report noted that "the
 Soviet troop withdrawal does not mean the final         25X1
 settlement of the Afghanistan question" and called
 for Moscow to undertake "its unshirkable responsibil-
 ity of restoring Afghanistan's peaceful and neutral
 status." According to the US Embassy in Beijing, as
 of late April 1988, China's Foreign Ministry was
 debating whether it would require more than the
 withdrawal of Soviet troops to declare that the Af-
 ghanistan obstacle had been overcome.

 The Military Buildup Along the Border
 The Soviets withdrew one of their five divisions from
 Mongolia last year, playing it up as one more unilat-
 eral gesture to reduce military tensions with China.
 They have given considerable play to the INF agree-
 ment in their propaganda aimed at China, presum-
 ably because the Chinese have included the SS-20s in
 the Soviet Far East as part of the buildup of Soviet
 forces along the border. Defense Minister Yazov
 claimed in his speech in February 1988 that the
 USSR has not added to its ground forces in Asia for a
 number of years and has not increased the size or
 scope of military exercises in the region. In fact,
 although the Soviets have kept the size of their
 exercises constant, they continue to gradually mod-
 ernize their ground, air, and naval forces in the
 region.
 rights before the first flight in December 1984.
 Apparently in return, Moscow promised to provide
 P'yongyang with advanced Soviet weapons.
 Moscow has proposed confidence-building measures
 along the border, such as notification of troop move-
 ments and mobilization and invitations to observe
 military exercises, but Beijing continues to insist that
 Moscow first reduce its forces along China's northern
 perimeter. Moscow probably would not offer signifi-
 cant troop cuts as a unilateral concession, despite its
 overall advantage in air and ground forces along the
 border (see figure 3). Instead, Moscow would probably
 consider such a move only as part of a broader
 political agreement involving some form of Chinese
 reciprocity-either a mutual force reduction agree-
 ment or assurances to move the political relationship
 forward. The Soviets, however, could withdraw two or
 Soviet withdrawal of
 one division as a concession, China, for its part,
 minimized the gesture in its media and public com-
 ments. The Chinese media called for the withdrawal
 of all divisions from Mongolia, and, in Beijing's view,
 the Soviet military presence in Mongolia is only one
 part of the problem of the Soviet military buildup
 along China's northern border
 along the Sino-Mongolian and Sino-Soviet borders
 over the past four or five years. In fact, the Chinese
 media reported in May 1988 that China is exporting
 workers to a small Soviet farm venture across the
 border from the Chinese city of Suifenhe. Beijing was
 previously reluctant to send workers to parts of the
 Soviet Far East that were once under Chinese rule.
 Both sides played down a border incident in July
 1986. The Chinese ignored a wayward Soviet missile
 that apparently landed on,the Sino-Soviet border in
 September 1986 and they continue to ignore occasion-
 al Soviet aircraft intrusions into Chinese airspace. On
 the negative side, the Chinese do take exception to the
 Soviet reconnaissance flights over the sensitive Yellow
 and East China Seas, where Beijing conducts missile
 tests. The reconnaissance missions involve overflights
 of North Korea, which granted the Soviets overflight
 three more divisions from Mongolia.
 Several domestic factors could persuade Moscow to
 consider and implement substantial military draw-
 downs when bilateral relations progress to a point
 where the Chinese are more receptive to such moves:
 ? The political leadership, already pressuring the So-
 viet military to reduce and conserve resources,
 concludes that cuts along the Sino-Soviet frontier
 are necessary to allow the reallocation of some
 resources from the military sector to the civilian.
 ? The warming of relations and increased economic
 ties, including border trade, generally lower tensions
 along the border and reduce threat perceptions.
 ? Soviet technological superiority and the ability to
 monitor Chinese activity along the border reduce
 the element of surprise and therefore enable Soviet
 forces to pull back somewhat from the border
 without substantially lowering defense capabilities.

 ? Organizational and structural changes in Mongo-
 lia's four divisions might enable it to protect Soviet
 security interests to a greater extent in the future.
 The ongoing redeployment of Mongolian Army
 assets to the primary avenues of approach may be
 an indication of Soviet intentions to eventually shift
 more of the defense burden to indigenous forces.
 Although the border demarcation issue is not one of
 the three obstacles, the Soviets, in our view, regard a
 solution to this dispute as a prerequisite to any
 significant troop cuts along the Sino-Soviet border. A
 breakthrough on the border issue could set the stage
 for progress on other issues as well. Soviet concessions
 on the border to date already signal to the Chinese
 that Moscow is no longer treating Beijing as an
 unequal partner-a primary source of continual ten-
 sion.
 Gorbachev broke the impasse on the border issue at
 Vladivostok when he publicly announced Soviet
 agreement with the long-held Chinese position that
 the eastern border passes along the main channel of
 the Amur River, in effect acknowledging Chinese
 claims that the disputed islands in the river are on
 China's side of the border. (This position has been
 privately accepted by Soviet border negotiators since
 the 1960s, but, even so, the Soviets always excluded
 the main islands opposite the Soviet city of Khaba-
 rovsk.) Two months later, in September 1986, Foreign
 Minsters Wu and Shevardnadze announced that both
 sides had agreed to resume border talks at the deputy
 minister level after a nine-year suspension. Beijing
 and Moscow conducted a joint survey of the Amur
 River during the summer of 1987 and signed an
 agreement in November on the use of border water
 resources. The working group agreed in February
 1988 to conduct joint aerial photography of the
 eastern sector. The last meeting of the experts group
 was in early April and focused on the technical
 aspects of organizing joint aerial photography, which
 began in May. The Soviets are certainly aware that
 aerial photography will show that the islands are on
 the Chinese side of the main channel.
 Border talks on the eastern sector, focusing on the
 riverine boundary, are steadily progressing. Talks,
 however, will most likely be protracted because a
 comprehensive border accord would also have to
 include an agreement on the disputed Pamir Knot
 region in the west, which will be addressed after
 negotiations on the east (see figure 4). We believe
 that, although Moscow is prepared eventually to
 return the more than 700 smaller river islands to
 Beijing, the main sticking point in negotiations will
 probably be the fate of the Tarabarovskiy and Bol'-
 shoy Ussuriyskiy islands (jointly known as Heixiazi
 Dao) located directly across from Khabarovsk. The
 Soviets may eventually be willing to acknowledge
 Chinese ownership of those islands but will probably
 withhold such a concession until China seems more
 willing to make compromises in return, such as
 abandoning its claim to the Pamir Knot region or on
 some other issue. Gorbachev is unlikely to "throw
 away" what could be an important bargaining chip in
 the future for an uncertain Chinese response. Moscow
 may even be exaggerating the value of the islands as a
 negotiating tactic to elicit greater concessions from
 China in the future. The Soviets will also probably be
 careful to claim that the natural flow of the river has
 changed the border in order to avoid setting a prece-
 dent that could apply to the Northern Territories
 claimed by Japan or to any other disputed territories
 along the USSR's borders.
 Gorbachev could face opposition within the leadership
 to making concessions to the Chinese on troop with-
 drawals from Mongolia and the Sino-Soviet border or
 on the territorial issues. If so, the sharpest criticism
 would probably come from the military and key
 leaders sympathetic to military concerns, such as
 KGB Chief Chebrikov and "Second Secretary" Liga-
 chev. The military probably would oppose a return of
 the islands opposite Khabarovsk and would almost
 certainly disapprove of any Soviet proposal to unilat-
 erally withdraw troops from the border area that
 could upset the current configuration of forces. Gor-
 bachev would probably need tangible evidence of

 Mongolia has a deep historical fear of Chinese
 expansionism and has looked to Moscow for security
 as well as economic assistance. Ulaanbaatar was
 concerned about the implications of withdrawing one
 Soviet division last year, even though the withdrawal
 made little impact on the military balance. Mongo-
 lia's leadership is probably concerned that future
 Soviet initiatives designed to nudge Beijing toward
 Sino-Soviet rapprochement-such as further troop
 withdrawals-may be made at Mongolia's expense.
 Ulaanbaatar has been reticent to move Sino-Mongo-
 lian relations forward but may be fearful of falling
 too far behind the Soviets. For its part, Moscow may
 also be encouraging Ulaanbaatar to expand contacts
 with Beijing-including economic contacts-to facili-
 tate its own efforts toward China.
 Sino-Mongolian relations, therefore, have improved
 in tandem-albeit on a much smaller scale and with
 reluctance on the Mongolian side-with the improve-
 ment in Sino-Soviet relations. The exchange of stu-
 dents resumed in 1987, and the possibility of initiat-
 ing town-to-town trade along the border is under
 discussion. Both sides also agreed in July 1987 to
 resume scientific and technological cooperation after
 a 20 year suspension, according to the US Embassy
 in Beijing. Progress in Sino-Mongolian relations may
 lessen Mongolian resistance to further Soviet troop
 withdrawals. The following is a chronology of Mon-
 golian-Chinese relations since 1985:i ,
 29 August 1985. Mongolian leader Batmonh, at a
 dinner hosted by Gorbachev, notes that Mongolians
 have been paying close attention to the process of
 normalizing Sino-Soviet relations-hinting at a
 Mongolian intent to respond more positively to recent
 Chinese gestures aimed at improving Sino-Mongolian
 ties.
 8 August 1986. China and Mongolia sign a consular
 treaty in Ulaanbaatar, probably related to Beijing's
 interest in protecting overseas Chinese following the
 expulsion of 1,800 Chinese from Mongolia in 1983.
 9 March 1987. China and Mongolia sign a border
 trade agreement and railway transport protocol in
 Hohhot, China.
 29 April 1987. The Soviets begin a limited withdraw-
 al of troops from Mongolia in a gesture to improve
 relations with China.
 7 June 1987. China and Mongolia sign a border
 treaty in Ulaanbaatar.
 18-25 June 1987. Visit of Chinese parliamentary
 delegation headed by National People's Congress
 Vice.Chairman Peng Chong.
 8 December 1987. Mongolia and China sign a trade
 protocol in Beijing.
 28 January-5 February 1988. First round of Sino-
 Mongolian border trade talks held in Ulaanbaatar.
 1 March 1988. Mongolia, North Korea, China, and
 the USSR sign a railway protocol in Ulaanbaatar.
 11 April 1988. Chairman of the Mongolian Council
 of Ministers sends congratulations to Li Peng on his
 appointment as Premier of China's State Council.
 2 May 1988. The Mongolian Civil Aviation Board
 begins direct air service between Ulaanbaatar and
 Beijing.

 The Soviet Union regards the disputed area

 the area as one, Heixiazi.
 Soviet Union
 Chinese willingness to agree to a mutually acceptable
 border accord in exchange for Soviet concessions on
 the river islands in the east. He may also need
 assurances that the Chinese would be willing to
 seriously discuss mutual force reductions along the
 border, which he could probably sell at home as a way
 to channel savings into the domestic economy.
 Boundary representation is
 not necessarily authoritative.
 Soviet Union
 We can identify no strong pro-Soviet constituency in
 the Chinese leadership, and fear of imperiling crucial
 trade, technology, and other ties between China and -
 the West inhibits even those who would like to see
 China follow a middle road between the two super-
 powers. Many in the party have little interest in

 sharply improved relations with the Soviets. They see
 China's interests as best served by expanded contact
 with the more technologically advanced-and wealth-
 ier-West. Some leaders, especially those in their
 fifties and sixties-many of whom are Soviet
 trained-support treating the two superpowers as
 more or less equivalent. Their statements suggest that
 they are not so much pro-Soviet as suspicious of the
 West. Some, such as .Premier Li Peng, also have
 indicated that they believe greater economic ties to
 the Soviet Union would be advantageous to China. In
 particular, trade with the Soviets would preserve
 scarce foreign currency holdings.
 Perhaps the most important impediment to full nor-
 malization of Sino-Soviet relations is the firm opposi-
 tion of China's top leader; Deng Xiaoping. Deng is
 deeply distrustful of the Soviets and skeptical that
 greatly improved relations with the USSR would yield
 significant benefits for China. We believe he has
 already achieved his main goal-relaxation of ten-
 sions on the border. Deng tightly controls Chinese
 policy toward the Soviets, and, although some other
 senior leaders favor a less restrictive policy, they have
 been unable to influence this issue much.
 Deng has the support of senior military leaders, who
 tend to follow his lead in foreign policy. Moreover, .
 many of them share Deng's suspicions, remembering
 Soviet failure to support the Communists during the
 Chinese civil war and the experiences of the 1960s.
 However, many in the second tier of the military
 leadership, which includes a number of Soviet-trained
 generals, are in favor of a middle course between the
 United States and the USSR.
 We expect some softening on the Chinese side after
 Deng's death; although the successor generation is not
 enthusiastic about the Soviets, most of them probably
 lack Deng's almost visceral dislike. For pragmatic
 reasons-trade advantage, cheaper goods, Soviet con-
 cessions, possible increased leverage in the strategic
 triangle-they will probably accelerate China's grad-
 ual policy of relaxation. We doubt, however, that
 Deng's successors will soon take the step the Soviets
 want-party-to-party relations. It remains an unpopu-
 lar and potentially politically risky move with few
 apparent gains for China.
 Moscow and Beijing appear to be moving toward an
 eventual rapprochement-albeit far short of the close
 relationship of the 1950s. Beijing is giving Moscow
 positive signals while carefully controlling the pace.
 We expect the Soviets will continue to try to nudge
 the Chinese to upgrade political contacts by making
 more unilateral gestures, perhaps including a with-
 drawal of a small number of troops from the border,
 more explicit public commentary on a Cambodian
 settlement, or concessions on the border dispute.
 Moscow may also attempt to elicit Beijing's public      25X1
 support in areas where parallel sentiments already
 exist such as on US policy toward Central America,
 the Strategic Defense Initiative, and concerns about
 Japanese defense policy, as well as to probe for new
 areas of possible convergence.
 25X1
 25X1
 Although unlikely, we cannot altogether rule out a
 characteristic "grand gesture" by Gorbachev to push
 the Chinese further. Moscow is probably pleased with
 the progress in relations to date and is unlikely to try
 to force the current pace. Domestic constraints and
 the risk of damaging relations with third-country
 allies limit the?areas in which Gorbachev can even
 make such a gesture. For example, Gorbachev would    25X1
 face opposition from the military-and probably key
 opponents in the Politburo-to making significant
 unilateral troop cuts along the border and would be
 unlikely to wage such a domestic battle for an uncer-
 tain Chinese response. The Soviets, in our view, are
 also not prepared to withhold economic or military
 support to Hanoi in an effort to prod the Vietnamese
 out of Cambodia; Moscow does not want to damage
 its overall relationship with Vietnam and is especially
 reluctant to risk losing access to Cam Ranh Bay.

 Secret
 Because the Soviets have already begun withdrawing
 their forces from Afghanistan, the only remaining
 area for a grand gesture would be the border demar-
 cation dispute. Gorbachev could, for example, unilat-
 erally announce that Moscow has decided to give
 China the disputed islands opposite Khabarovsk. He
 is, however, unlikely to "throw away" what could be
 an important bargaining chip in the future for an
 uncertain Chinese response.
 The Soviets have had less success eliciting a positive
 Chinese response when they have pushed hard in
 public for a leap forward in relations-the Chinese
 were slow to respond, for example, to the Vladivostok
 speech-and Gorbachev is unlikely to risk destroying
 the current momentum by putting the Chinese on the
 spot. Beijing is not now prepared to respond with a
 grand gesture of its own, such as reestablishing full
 party-to-party ties, and would resent Moscow's effort
 to force the issue in this way.
 Short of an all-out push for a full normalization of
 relations-which probably would include occasional
 summit meetings, periodic high-level meetings, and
 the restoration of formal party-to-party ties-the way
 seems clear for an exchange of visits by foreign
 ministers, premiers, or presidents within the next
 year. Both sides agreed in principle to a foreign
 ministers' meeting apart from the meeting held each
 fall at the UN General Assembly, but they have never
 followed through. This agreement could be reactivat-
 ed, and a meeting could be set in either Beijing or
 Moscow, possibly in conjunction with the border talks
 or normalization discussions. A resumption of some
 form of military contacts would also be a sign of
 significant progress in the relationship.
 Historical animosities, reciprocal perceptions of
 threat, and Beijing's reticence to upgrade relations
 will probably prevent a return to the alliance relation-
 ship of the 1950s. The Chinese are sensitive about
 their sovereignty and position within the socialist
 community, and, despite Soviet assurances that Mos-
 cow wants a relationship based on equality, Beijing
 will remain skeptical of Soviet overtures. Beijing also
 seeks to maintain an independent stance vis-a-vis
 Moscow and Washington and will avoid an alliance to
 maintain leverage within the triangle. Both China and
 the USSR need Western technology and capital for
 their respective modernization drives, and China in
 particular would be careful not to jeopardize its access
 by entering into an alliance with the Soviets.
 Although a closer relationship may lead Moscow and
 Beijing to be tougher in their bargaining positions
 with Washington-especially if both see their lever-
 age in the strategic triangle as enhanced by closer
 relations-better Sino-Soviet relations would not nec-
 essarily have a negative impact on US interests across
 the board. Should the Soviets and Chinese; for exam-
 ple, begin to cooperate on such issues as jointly
 restraining North Korea or pressing Vietnam and the
 resistance toward a Cambodian settlement, this coop-
 eration could have positive implications for stability in
 East Asia. At the same time, however, the Soviets and
 Chinese will continue to compete for influence else-
 where in the region, especially in Southeast Asia and
 eventually in South Korea.
