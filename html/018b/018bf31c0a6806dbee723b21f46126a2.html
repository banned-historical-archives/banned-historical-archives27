Introduction 45ondense7. 
In a world that is divided anew, among and within the nations, the horizon is deal: 
on an -sides, particularly in China, The real crucial problem there is that of 
adjusting relations between the xnw and the CCP. Is such adjustment possible? 
We do not believe it because the CCP calls for collaboration with the government 
in the hope of dominating and reigning alone. An entente between them is impossible, 
as the first attempt at cooperation (1924) has well proved. All the good words 
and lavish promises cannot change that which has been evident from the beginning. 
Beginnings of the CCP (1921-1928) 
Modern Chinese history begins officially with the 1911 revolution, which finished 
the Manchu regime and brought in the Republic. But that was external and did not bring 
the dreamed-of transformation. The real break between ancient and new China dates from 
the "Movement of May 4, 1919", Such was the name given to demonstrations by Peiping 
students against the disappointing provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. This agitation 
by the student class was clothed with a special character for it interpreted China's 
profound aspirations. Politically it resulted in a boycott of Japanese goods. From the 
cultural point of view, it gave a definite impetus to the "New Culture Movement" launched 
by Hu Shih and Ch'en Tu-hsiu (1) in the famous magazine "New Youth" in 1917. These two 
men promoted the spoken style or "Pai-hua" in place of the antique literary style which 
was concise to the point of obscurity. But in their view, this Literary Reform was but 
the first step towards completing the transformation of China; they hoped by putting 
reading matter within the comprehension of the people to spread the new ideas more 
easily. 
A vague enthusiasm swept over the country following these student demonstrations; 
many periodicals appeared, written in colloquial style, seeking a synthesis between the 
old national culture and modern western civilization. Under the influence of "New Youth", 
which gave the tone, they spoke passionately of the slogan "science of democracy", as 
being the last 'word of modern civilization; for they wished to free themselves from 
Confnciasimm, whieh they blamed for the stagnation of China. 
It is not strange that in this ferment of spirit, and intense need of change, 
attention was directed to Soviet experience. The intellectual elite of the nation was 
to be found at that time in Peking. The National Peking University was truly the home 
of new ideas. Its professors and students expressed their thoughts through the medium
of various influential magazines. Among them Ch' en Tu-hsiu, who already was very famous, 
suddenly gave himself to close study of the Russian October Revolution, along with has 
colleague Li Ta-ohao.(2) These two men gathered around themselves a number of young men 
interested in Marxist theories and founded a magazine "The Weekly Review" to diffuse 
their ideas. This was the first center of interest in Marxism in China (1919). 
But if Peking was then the indisputable intellectual center of China, it was not 
the best center for the hatching and growth of Communist ideas. Shanghai, the great 
industrial citye.offered much greater possibilities because of her faotories and her 
labor population. On the other hand staying in Peking had become difficult for Ch' en, 
who had spent several months there in prison. Also he was anxious to come to Shanghai, 
where he had been invited by several social-anarchist groups. Conversations were held 
in the former French Concession, at No 716 on the then Avenue Joftre, in the home of 
Tai Chi-tsao, (3), later a member of the KMT. Their headquarters were camouflaged under 
the name of School of Foreign Languages. In fact a number of students were trained 
there who later went to the Oriental Institute in Moscow or were scattered throughout 
the interior for propaganda purposes. But thanks to the advice of Voitinsky, agent of 
the executive committee of the Comintern (4), to create a Communist party in China, 
the purely anarchist elements were eliminated; a Communist magazine man started 'whose 
expense was defrayed by this same Voitinsky (May 1920). Little by little various members 
were added whose names were to be fam)us in the annals of the party. The group called 
itself "Society of Socialist Youth". 
Some time after the conversations and the purging. out of members adjudged to be 
unorthodox from the Marxist point of view, Vhitinsky proposed to organize a genuine 
Communist party. Chsen Tu-hsiu agreed and gathered the most prominent members of the 
society to a general meeting (May 1921). The result of the discussions was the official 
founding of the Chinese Communist Party (June 1921). Its leaders were Chien Tu-hsiu for 
Shanghai, Li-Ta-chao for Peiping and ran Ping-shan (5) for Canton. A representative 
of the now party was dispatched to Moscow, to the congress of the Proletarians of the 
Far East. That was when the affiliating of the Communist party with the IT was considered 
for the first time, and Moscow showed itself favorable,

While Chien Tu-hziu, the outstanding personage, was clothed with supreme dignity 
as the secretary-general of the party, other Communist groups were formed of Chinese 
etudents abroad; in France with Chou En-la., (6) and Li Li-san; in Germany with the 
future general Chu Teh; in Russia with Chu Ch'iu-pai. In the interior of China, active 
propaganda was begun among laborers and students. Also in Hunan, the Communist section 
of which 7) asthe secretary, founded in a Rem months a score of Red unions. 
The following year (1922) in May, at the second general oongress of the party in 
Shanghai, the Soviet delegate proposed officially an alliance between the two parties0 
a and CCE7 Joffe was specially dispatched to effect this manoeuver. Chten Tu-hsiu 
expressed his disapproval of this policy, which necessitated, for ths tiae being at least, 
a sacrifice of certain essential aims of Communism. His intransiGeance came near causing 
a split and it took all the authority of the Third Internatilnale to make him allow this 
change of attitude. 
In December of that year, while Chen Tu-hsiu vent to help at the third congroun 
of the Third Internationale (Comintern) Joffe had an interview with Sun Ven (Sun Yat-son) 
in Shanghai, endeavoring to make him admit the principle of collaboration between the 
two parties. The result of the talks was the celebrated statement of 26 January, 1923 
in these terms: "Dr, Sun Yat-sen holds that the Communist order or even the Soviet 
system cannot be actually introduced in China, because there do not exist the conditions 
for successfully establishing Communism or bolshevism. This opinion is fully shared by 
M. Joffe, who thinks that the most pressing problem for China is to achieve her national 
unification; also, with regard to this great task, he assures Dr. Sun of the warm sympathy 
and aid of Russia for the Chinese people. And Joffe solemnly promised that Russia would 
abstain from all Communist propaganda in China. Despite this success, his mission in 
aBr points gained nothing for the cause, and the Russian government sent Karahkan in 
his place. This man was more fortunate and succeeded in getting recognition of the 
Soviet regimoo In return, Russia renounced her special rights in China. Soon after this 
interview, Sun Yat-sen obtained Soviet advisers for reorgenizing the KMT. Very soon a 
flood of Russian agents under the direction of Borodin and Galen, came to spread over 
Canton. 
Nevertheless the perplexities or Sun Yat-sen ceased not for a sinele day, so he 
continued his inquires. In March one Liao Chung-Kai, who hadfbllowed Joffe to Japan, 
returned declaring to Sun Yat-sen that there was actually no Communism in Russia. The 
latter, much impressed, sent General Chian, Kai-shek to Moscow for more information. 
After a six months stay in the USSR and many discussions with Trotsky and Stalin, the 
future Generalissimo returned with a verdict also favorable. Furthermore, the CCP met 
in its third national congress at Canton in Juno 1923, and took the historic decinion to 
enter the KMT and co-operate with it (10 July). From that moment, the Comintern worked 
hard in favor of the two parties being friends. Finally, in January 1924, all these 
advances were officially approved by the first national KMT Congress, which voted the 
principle of collaboration between the two parties, leaving to the Communists their 
own separate committees and organs. 
From then on the Communist partydbveted all its efforts to gaining supremacy in 
the ranks of the KMT, with the support and under the direction of the Comintern. 
Ch' en Tu-hsiu, the secretary general was then at the apogee of his glory and influency. 
At his directim, China was divided into three zones: Shanghai, which he administered 
directly, Peiping and Canton, where Li Ta-ohao and T'an P'ing-shan were reepectively in 
command. But in reality, theetrue masters of these two cities were the two sons of 
Ch'en, Yen-nien and Ch'iao-nien. Besides, various kinumenor intimates were slipped lnto 
Important posts of the party here and there, so that one could say not without reason 
that the Communist party had become almost the family fief on Chen Tu-hsiu. The 
growing influence of the party added in like measure to the personal prestige of its 
ohdefs 
This golden age, in which there was bestowed on him the title of Chinese Lenin, 
passed quickly enough. In fact, his authority never was unquestioned., On the one 
hand, he must execute the commissions of the Soviet u?ents. On'the other, the 
Communist Party never did have actual homogeneity; it consisted of three centers, 
divided among themeelves and in disagreement on the principles themselves. Underground 
rivalry broke out between the Shanghai section, which ha directly administered, and that 
of Carton which was controlled by his son Chen Yen-nien and the furture party sentinels,

Mao Tseetung, Chou En-lais etc. The first question which divided the two groups 
was the land nroblem. The Cantonese group, advised by Borodin, sought full appli-
cation of the Communist doctrine of land nationalization. Mao Tse-tung tells 
in his autobiography that after the Nnnking Road incident of 30 May 1925, he gave 
msolf entirely to the peasant movement. He aroused the peasants against the land-
lords, and the latter hounded him. Then he took refuge in Canton at the moment 
when Chiang Kai-shek, director of the Whampoa Military Academy, was named general 
of the First Army and Wang Chingewei took the title of heed of the government in 
place of Sun Yatesen, who bad died in Peiping on 12 March 1925. In Canton, Mao 
opert hiC energies publishing a journal vlich attacked the EMT right wing and in 
organizing the peasant movement. But he was chiefly interested in the peasantry 
from the Communist point of view; it was from this angle that he wrote two 
pamphlets in which he outlined a radical land policy and advocated a vigorous 
organization of peasants under the aegis of the Communist Party. Ch'en Tuehsint, 
faithfel to the policy of union with the NNT? rebuffed these projects and ever. 
Thrbsdo publishing the chief organs of the party. This vas the first incident 
which began to widen the rift between the two man. Mao Tseetung, erstwhile a 
fervent admirer of Cheen Tuehsiu at Peiping University (1910, prepared to become 
his mortal enemy. 
? The progress of the Communists rapidly disturbed KMT circles. At the 
second general party congress (January 1926), in order to curb Communist intrigues 
it was decided to admit them only as auxiliaries, never as regular members, into 
the executive organs; in committees, they must never rise above the rank of 
members. 
On the other hand, the Communist group in Canton continued to agitate and 
advocate a more radical policy. At a meeting held in Canton on 18 Mrrch 1926 
to commemorate the anniversary of the Paris Commune, a leader of the Communist 
Party publicly affirmed that the hour had come to realize dictatorship of the 
proletariat. This was equivalent to rejecting all subordination to the KET. But 
ChgenTuehaiu held above all to the e3liance of the two parties and did not listen 
to these proposals. 
Meanwhile Chiang Kai-shek launched his expedition against the north in order to 
realize the unity of China under the aegis of the KMT. The southern armies quickly 
conquered all south of the Yangtze and at the end of the year the Canton government 
moved to Wuhan, where it came under the dominatien of the left, favorable to the 
Communists. The latter, believing themselves to be on the eve of seizing power 
In China, multiplied their intrigues. They took much leadership in the Wuhan 
government, which brought reactions from Chiang Kai-shek and the KET right; in 
order to check them, the generalissimo took possession of Shanghai, then of Nanking, 
where he established another regime loyal to himself (18 April 1927). Then he 
issued a proclamation condemning Communism and ordering an immediate purge of the 
army and administration. In Shanghaipeoarticularly, severe restraints were put 
upon laborers in the Red unions. 
Despite the growing tempest between the two parties, ChenTw-hsin remained 
firmly attached to the principle of collaboration. When Wang Chingewei? chief 
of the xlm loft wine, returned from Burma, Ch'en went to see him and together 
they signed a declaration reaffirming the principle of alliance between their 
two parties. "Comrades, despite the success of the national revolution, our 
enemies are living and always seeking to profit from our weaknesses; let us remain 
united; our harmony is indispensable. The CCP fully recognizes the place of the 
KNT and of the Three Princinles in the national revolution...This is what China 
needs, not any dictatorship of the proletariat, but coeoperation between the two 
parties. None of the difficulties which may arise between thena their divergences 
of view, are irreconcilable...At any cost collaboration must not be brokenu(5 April 
1927). 
Annoyingly enough, this same ChtlenTu-Tasiu? who had reluctantly accepted the 
Comintern directives to carry out a policy of union between the two parties, 
showed himself now the most persistent champion of this policy. He blamed and 
dismissed Mao Tse-tung for having created troubles in Hunan against the KMT 
authorities. Also be was not surnrised that the situation was very tense since the 
Fifth Congress of the Communist Party which was opened in May 1927; the antienT 
atmosphere was very strong, and the advocates of rupture were very violent in 
presenting their point of view. But Chien Tu-heiu shoved himself inflexible and 
succeeded once mors in irnosing his authority, without even consulting the Central 
Cememittee. Once too often, he rejected the proposals of Mao Tseetueg for a rapid 
intensification of the ariaz struggle. This was his last victory, events soon 
became too much for him and a growing opposition prepared to overthrow him.

On 21 May cane the first militarr putsch by the Communists at Changsha, 
followed by massacres, which greatly increased the suspicions of even the left 
ming of the KET and rendered the position of Borodin more precarious. What 
Elrod the powder was the notable clumsiness of an Indian Communist, Roy, Soviet 
delegate with the IDT forces. On June first, he invited Wang Chingewei to a 
secret conference, expecting to find in him an ally, in his capacity as chief of 
the KET left wing. He sterol with Wang a confidential telegram from Moscow 
demanding the immediate use of revolutionary methods in the territory of the Wuhan 
government; that is to say, land confiscat4on, formation of a strong proletarian 
army of 50,000 men, creation of a revolutionary tribunal, etc. Wang Chingewei? 
amazed, demanded and obtained copies of the document; on 4 June, he went to 
Cheng-chou in Ronan, to inform tho southern generals of the Soviet ultimatum and 
of the coup d'etat which was in preparation. On 13 June, these came back to Wuhan 
and after much discussion took the decision to chase the Communists out of the 
EMT, but kept it secret for a while longer. 
Borodin seeing the error, protested vigorously to Moscow, who recalled Roy 
and demanded of him a reckoning. It is said that Roy disclaimed responsibility 
for the affair, throwing it beck on another Soviet colleague. Trotzky, in one 
of his books, "The Disfigured Revolution" accuees Stalin of opportunism or taking 
the short view in having obliged the COP to submit to the KIAT rather than to follow 
its con essentially Marxist policy. It is his view, the logical opinion of a man 
who advocated permanent revolution. Or perhaps MOSCOW underestimated the strength 
of the KUT in believing themselves capable of giving orders to the loft wing, of 
guiding it as they pleased. In aey case, it did not turn out that may. On 15 
July, aftor a month of preparation, Wong Ching-wei proposed officiallm and obtained 
the expulsion of the Communists. In consequence, Borodin and the other Soviet 
Advisers had to leave China. 
On 1 August, because there was no longer any need for pretense, a portion of 
the troops of Chang Fa-kluei,(8) under the command of two of his officers, Ho. 
Lung (9) and Yeh Teing,(10) revolted and seized Nan-Wang by surprise c For several 
days there was looting, arson, and a reign of terror. On the 5th, the uprising was

Ho Lung established himeelf on the Hunan-Hupeh border, -chile Yeh Tling rent to 
Kraegtung? where between Seaton and Canton he organized the first Red districts 
of Haiefeng and Lu-tong; at the end of the year he took an active part in an uprising 
in Canton. 
While these events were transpiring, the Communist Party Central Committee 
held an extraordinary meeting on 7 August. ChpenTuehsiu was deprived of his 
office as secretary general, and struggle against the KUT was decided on. Never-
thelese, complete rupture did not come at once. The Comintern always counselled 
collaboration, if not with the rovernment, at least with the revolutionary elements 
of the NMT. 
In imitation of Ho Lung and of Yeh T'ing, doubtful elements of the lax army, which 
had been left as rea2-guardy 3evolted and made themselves centers of Communist action. 
In Niangzi Chu Teh rebelled, attacking and mastering in the region of Chao-mei. With 
a reorganized army ho ravaged the north of Rwangtung. On 7 November at Kai-feng the 
first congress of workmen:, soldiers, and soviet proletarians set up the government of 
Hai-feng and Lu-feng. But in tl-e and the most important was the Canton rebellion.

Chung-fa, who was named secretary general of the party, and Li-son. The 
disastrous experience of Canton had proved that the party could not seize political 
power by force; it was then decided to abandon the s'rstem of Putsches and to devote 
all their efforts to organizing the ;ndustrial and naasant classes. This change

In China:, there was a re-grouping of forces wiihin the perte itself. Internal 
aiscord nes ra-pant; there was no unanimity of views. 
Chen Tu-hsiu though dieeosseesed of newer by a nsjorite of the Central 
0 meittee, nevertheless retained much authority in party ranks. He returned to 
Shanghai and continued to deferd nis views by means of hie nen. His influence 
aroug the Red unions was considerable, and they showed hiit much deference. After 
the Canton uprising, he wrote a letter to the Central Committee asking them to 
avoid armed conflict with the British authorities of Hong-Kong and to collaeorate 
with the NUT left and with the Third Party, recently fourded by Tan P'ingeehanv 
ODO of the first dissidents. The Central Committee replied with a lord of blamo 
for his pronosals and accused him of opportunism. Greatly displeased, Ch'en 
redoubled his activity in secret; he constituted for himself a small group of 
faithfuls with the design of overthrowing the Central Committee. His attacks 
against the officials policy of the party continued until the Committee, worn 
out, expelled him with all his following, calling them "the faction of opnosition". 
It is the custom to give him the epithet "Trotzkyits" but that is not fundamentally 
exact. In doctrine, le nee totally opposed to Trotsky. Far from extolling the 
"permanent revolution", he held very mild theories. No recommended to the 
Central Committee the dissolution of the fled army; the cessation of strikes and 
varidus agitations, imputing the check of the Chinese revolution to the Third 
Internationale; he counselled returning to the study of Marxist theory, maintaining 
the revolutionary rorces? and waiting In peace for the return of a favorable 
occasion. The document developing these ideas carried a hundred signatures. 
The Central Committee replied by the irnediate expulsion of Ch' en Tu-hsiu and his 
folloying? somewhat similar to the purge be Stalin lith regard to the "tail" of 
Lenin. 
After his expulsion his dominant feeling towards the Committee was hate rather 
than difference of opinion. He joined other expelled persons who were in fact 
Trotakyites. Then he began forming a Trotskyite party using financial support 
from the Fourth Internationale and Trotzkeite students returned from Russia. 
In a few months he collected thousands of followers and was able to set up a 
new Communist government to rival that of the Central Committee. Affiliated 
graape raeidly eprung up everywhere. Ch' en Tu-hsiu became again "the Red emperor". 
Along with the orgenizatioe of his party, he tried to set forth a new doctrine, 
whose base was his opposition to the Red army, to the Soviet government and their 
agrarian policy. Bitter war ensued between the two parties. The difference was 
chiefly one of method?, Ch'en Tu-hsiu had the fault in Stalinist eyes of posteoning 
the realiztion of Communism to the Greek Ralends 0 
The Trotzkyite parte had only emphemeral success. That which united them 
was rather a common hatred of the Ste linist faction than any profound faith for 
definite action.. NThen the intimates of Chen Tu-hsiu perceived that this 
ideology led nowhere, defection quickly spread among their ranks; some of the 
disillusioned rejoined the Nanking government, others the rival faction. Finally 
Chen Tu-hsiu was turned over to the police by one of his family (15 November 
1932) and imprisoned. Pardoned during the SinceJapanese war (to August 1937) 
be was taken back into the but died soon after (24 Mny 1942). 
The disturbance provoked in Stalinist circles by the activities of Cb.genTur-hsiu 
lasted for some time; nevertheless his "opeortunist" policy, his gentle Communism, 
could not withstand the dangers to the Communist party as well as the policy 
followed by Li Li-san. (11) 
Li Li.-san was a student returned from France, where he had aided in forming 
a section of the Communist party among his fellow countrymen. He was, even in the 
judgment of Mao Tseetung, one of the most brilliant personalities of the party 
and one of the nearest to Trotsky that China had produced, certainly much more than

Impressed by the success of Communist arms in various districts of Kwangtunge 
Nene% Hupet, and Mengel, Li Liesan adopted a policy opposite to that of Chen 
Teelsiu, scorning also the directives of the Comintern and the agrarian policy 
eetoVied by Mao Tseetueg. Exaggerating the maturity of the revolutionary situation 
in 
china, he adopted a policy of extreme violence. Believing the moment propitious 
for overthrowing the Namking goveramentp for Chiang mas engaged with the northern 
general Yen Hsieshan and Fong Yaeheiang? he tried to combine a general offensive 
of the Red armies with popular uprisings stirred up in the big centers. Hn wanted 
to create terror in the villages in order to demoralize the bourgeoisie. This 
extreme revolutionary tactic frightened the Comintern, who had just expressed their 
opposition to putsches, and caused panic among the other members of the CCP, who 
=communicated him. Far from submitting, Li Li-san created a dissident Central 
Committee in Hupah. Sustained in secret by Chquepei, eicretaryegeneral of 
the party, he continued his struggle against the Central Committee; his followers 
rapidly increased. Moscow, having studied reports upon reports, ordered an immediate 
end teethe "line of LI Li-san", and summoned him to Russia to account for his deeds. 
His lack of success or rather his fleeting success before Chang-aha (28 Jigy 1930) 
put him in a bad military situation, and besides he had to obey orders from Moscow. 
' After his departure, the party was entirely disorganized, for the rebellions 
he had provoked were easily suppressed. In the winter of that SSE3 year (1930)0 
the Central Committee ens able to subdue the followers of Li Li-san, and began 
to purge the administrations where they were in control; 25 percent of the total 
were excluded. Then the orthodox embers of the Committee reunited, in the congress 
of 15 January 1931 and severely condemned the policy of Li Li-san. 
Li Li-san disappeared, but "Lilisanism" was not entirely crushed with him. In 
the arpy it caused a very serious incident which imperilled the entire Red armyr, 
At Fuet'ien in Hunan, a group of Red troops under Liu Lietsao, eiehed to follow 
the line of Li Liesan, revolted, arrested the President of the Kiangsi Soviets, and 
disarmed a part ofthe troops. This caused no little excitement in Fuet0ien? which 
was close to Chi-an, at the very center of the Soviet districts. "Indeed," says 
Mho Tse-tung, it seemed that the fate of the revolution depended on the issue 
-of this struggle". After the first moment ef dismay in the Red camp, they set 
themselves to suppress this dancer. Quickly Liu Lietsao was arrested9 his soldiers 
disarmed and "licinidated"! Such was the end of "Lilisanism" but the alarm had 
been hot and the party nearly collapsed as a result of its own internal quarrels. 
Despite these domestic difficulties, the most serious yet experienced by the 
party, the various small bands of Red soldiers took advantage of the conflicts 
betveen Chiang Kei-shek and the northern generals, to develop themselves in the 
provinces of.Keangtung, Fukien:, Kiangsi, Hunan, Hupeh and Anhwei. Soviets were 
established in the eccuoied districts, where they began, from the end of 1928, 
to practice the reforms prescribed by the Comintern; confiscation of large land-
holdings and redivision of the seized lands among poor peasants and the families 
of soldiers. Thus resulted the setting up of many strongly Communist places, from 
which came forth Red troops. Among these bases, a erincipal one was Chla-ling on 
the Hunan border where a Soviet was established in November 1927. A solid base 
was met up in Chingekaneshan (on the HunaneKiangsi border) and a moderate policy 
adopted as against certain violent elements who advocated pillage and massacre. 
The following year, in Man Chu Teh arrived with his troops and joined thee with 
those of Mao Tse-tung. In the autumn there was a meeting of delegates from Sovietized 
"hsien" of this area. A minorite showed some attachment to a more radical and 
violent policy, but the majority rallied around Mao Tse-tung and Chu Teh, (12) 
that is, to the policy of land division and Vie establishment of Soviets. Finally _ 
the Central Cceedttee ratified the leadership of Mao Tse-tung, in accord with the 
Sixth Communist Congress of Moscoe. H,,rmony was restored between the leaders 
of the party and of the Sovietized districts. 
Among other centers of Communist activity,, we mention a district in the 
vest of Hupeh occueied by Ho Lam and another in the rest established by HatHai-
tung (13) nucleus of the future Soviet of 0-yllevan, where two notable Reds, HA 
Haiangechlien (14) and Chang Kuo-t'ao (15) were brought together.

Another zone was Sovietized in the northeast of Kiangsi, which became a 
powerful base (winter of 1927). In the spring of 1928, a movement began armed 
Chi-an? which was destined to become the center of the Soviet rovernment. In 
the west of Fukien, another region was organized, where the Ninth congress of 
the perty was held; there the way was prepared for the future etate of Kiangsi 
. (December 1929)a The following year the entire south of this arovince fell 
into the hands of the Red army.. On the seventh of February, 1930, an imnortant 
local conference reunited delegates of the party, the army and the governmente 
The land problem was discuased at length and in its broad outlines, and the 
decision was taken, against "opnortunists" such as Ch'en Tuahsiu? to proceed 
with land redistribution and to set up the Soviet Government of Kiangsi.. In 
fact more than a year, had to elapse before the definitive organization of a 
regular government. On 8 November 1931, at Juiachin, capital of the new state, 
the first all-China Soviet Congress me held, at which Mao Tse-tung was elected 
President of the Red districts of Kiangai, and Chu Teh was chosen as commander-
inachief. 
25X1A 
From then on, the authority of Mao Tseatung was to dominate the peaty and 
never again to be. seriously questioned. If one wishes by comparisons to place 
the three most influential chiefs who have directed the CCP, it is necessary 
to say that Ch"enTuahsiu was the Chinese Lenin, as has been done several times; 
but the comparison is only external, for if Chnen Tu-hsiu was the creator of 
the party, he had neither the genius nor the audacity of Lenin; expelled from 
the party by another faction, his memory is forever held in execration by Chinese 
Communists. The likeness between Li Li-san and Trotsky is much more striking, 
and their destinies were similar. As to Mao Tseatung? one can bestow on him 
the title of Stalin without forcing the phrase. Of the three Chinese leaders, 
he shows more boldness than Gillen Tuphsta and more flair for politics than 
Li. Li-san; he understands better how to adapt Communism to conditions in China. 
While his predece-sors relied most of all upon the urban proletariat, he on the 
other hand, with a tenacity which Overcame all opposition, put the emehasis 
on agrarian policy. 
We stop awhile cn the State of Kiangsi to examine the work of organization. 
The strategy of the Russian Communist Party, which rose to power thanks chiefly 
to the eupport of the peasant class to which it had promised all the land, has 
been strictly followed by the CCP. These demagogic tactics have chiefly borne 
fruit in the provinces which have suffered most from civil war and where 
extreme poverty was most widespread amongst the nassee. 
When the Red troops take nossession of a district, their first act is 
the calling of a general assembly of delegates of the people to elect a governments 
But the active candidates have been previously chosen by the Communist chiefs 
from among their sympathizers, and once elected, they stay under the vigilant 
control of sections or cells of the party. This holds for all levels of the 
administration. 
The administration establidhed? the first legislative act of the Soviets 
is to issue a decree ordering the destruction of all the documents, titles, 
contracts relating to landownership; confiscation of the lands of "landlords" 
and of comfortable peasants, their redivision into the hands of the poor 
population; and the abolition of taxes collected by the former authorities. 
The distribution or land is effected in proportion to the members of each 
family. Besides, the party drives for the organization of peasants unions 
connosed of poor and moderately well-off peasants, who serve as a means of 
penetration to the heart of the rural population. The more radical of these 
peasant unions are orgaeized into "Committees of the Indigent", charged to 
protect the interests of the reral proletariat. Finally.thnee committees are 
in turn controlled by Communist cella established at their heart. In brief, 
the administrative machinery and control is tne wont solid. The grip of 'Ie 
party is absolute. 
Looking at the situatice particularly of Chinese 'Communism, the party only. 
leans on the working masses with hesitation, because hitherto the Sovietized' 
toms heve been in places of little importance, wnere large industrial nnterpriees 
are not found. Fron the viewpoint of orthodox Communism the artisans, who 
constitute the working proletariat, do not offer the same assurance of support 
as do the urban eroletariat of the industrial centers. Also the party dons 
not depend on itself alone. Nevertheless the role of labor unions is no less 
important in the Red districts than in the UT industrial centers. These 
occupational unions serve well the cause of the party and enable it to meet in 
Important gatherings for study of the workers' movement and the policy to follows

Fieally, to have necessary reserves on hand, the party has introduced a syaieen of 
militarization of the population, according to vhich all the urban and Tura proletaeiat, 
women included, must receive military instruction. 
To complete the outline of the Soviet organization of Riangsi some figures will 
give un accuracy and instructive comparisons. At the second general congress of Soviet 
China, which also vas hold at 3u1-chin, from 22 January to 1 February 1934, Hao Tse-tung 
presented a general aicture ef Communist activities in 'Clangs/ in. nhich Be gave amm 
statistics, valuable for shoeing us the importance of the vork accomplished. Led unions 
in the central region of Kiangei and nearby Sovietized districts totalled 229,000 meubers; 
from 6,988, landlords, 317,539 Uou of land had been confiscated. Farm products had ine 
creased 15 or cent in a year, anricultural offices end schools were started here and,

textile mills and ougarewerks; to peke up for deficiency of ealtf, for the RUT forces

point of ellen, 3052 primary Leninist schools and 6,462 night courses yore being carried on 
in 21,932 villages of Uangsi, Fuld= and Emangtune, with a total of 183,617 pupils. 
Higher education included the Red army University, Soviet University, Larxist and Coneranist 
University' end many other technacal inetitations. 
These developmente vere helped by the ctrugglesnhich Chiang Lai-shek had to carry on

From the military point of view, operations commenced after a conference held in .

As military events, there were no major operations during the course of 1932. Tho 
Coumuniste advanced to the gates of Hankau, Amoy, and even of lianhine. On each side, 
there eere alternations of success and failure. To be definite, the rationalists attacked 
Communist points in Anhwei and Uupoh and wiped out the fortified nest which Ho Lung had 
built for himself in the mid le of Lake Bung on the north bank of the Yangtze. A fifth 
campaign was launched in April 1933 and began successfully but ended in disasters In 
October 1933 or mpedition was undcestanen on a grand scale. On the advice of Gorman ()Moors, 
his uadvisers", Chiang Kai-shok began a new steategy which bore fruit in erecting a oeriee 
of block houses, in general on high ground, at a distance sufficient for mutual defense, 
arornd the Sovietized territory. Satisfying progress had been made when ho 19th Armz-, which

It took several months for the central troops to evell tnis rebellion. in January, ).934,

territory. Despite their manoeuvoring skill, their rapidity of movement, their fiehtieg 
spirit, they were not equal to resisting the very superior government forces. On 16 
October 1934, their general azodus began. 
The causes vhic obliged the Conmunists to leave their base in Kiangsi were not solely 
military. From the economic eoint of view, the Rod renublic had not been a unecess; the 
agrarian policy which had been carried out in a very rigorous fashion had detracted from, 
it seemed, the prosperity of the new stet(); eost of all, in the view of ileoese,tung, the

discriminately, and they agreed to collaborate with anti-imperialist nations on certain 
conditions, Such is a resume of the program of action eublished by Wang fling in "Inter-
national Correspondence" under date of 15 February 1936. The author gives to his article 
a significant title "For a turning in all the domains of our work"; and he says: "It is 
necessary to make a determined end of our regrettable faults and our factional 'left' 
traditions, in both policy and in work on the masses throughout the EUT provinces. But 
in turning, it is equally necessary in the natter of policy that we remain in the Soviet 
regions, particularly in the sense that it is necessary to confer on it a more pronounced 
poplar and national character"..

In August 19350 they began to nroposo cessation of civil Item and the union of all 
parties in a struggle against the Japanese aggreseer, under the aoeis of a deneeratic 
government, which would ally itself with the USSR and other countries friendly to china. 
Skill in this new policy won much sympathy, and event.; more responsible for showing 
opportunism. On 9 December 1935, Peking students, "led by our Party" sego Vac) Ise-tung, 
demonstrated in favor of national liberation. The Japanese intrigued more and more in 
the northern provinces; witness the seizure of Jehol (1933), the autonomy of Hopei-Chaha: 
under a Javanese protectorate (1935), the invasion of Suiyuan (1936). Those events 
greatly increased the national feeling a:ainst the Japanor,0?.who each year since the in-
vasion of nanchuria (1931) had nibbled off a bit of China. The Communists skillfully pro-
fited termaking themselves the champi-ns of patriotism and accusing Nanking of being de-
ficient in boldness. At the beginning of 1936, they attacked the neighboring province of 
Shansi but were quickly repulsed and forced to recross the Yellow Uver. On the other 
hand, in the seath0 the generals Li Tsung-jen (21) and Pal Chung-hsi (22) chieftains of 
luangsi, and Chten Chi-Vang (23) military governor of Ktrangtun: attempted a separatist 
movement in the southwest calling it the national Army of Salvation" against Japan. 
Happily, the crisis vas uickly passed and the rebel generals submitted (June-July 1)36). 
But if the rebellion had been crushed so easily, it vas perhaps not without influence 
on a crisis vhich arose in northwest China at the end of the sane year. To oversee the 
new Red zone of Shensi, Chiang Kai-shek had designated Chang Heteh-liang (24) and his 
northeast army as veil as Yang Huech9eng and the 17th army. Die please. kieere these anpoint-
ments, officers and men easily let themselves be perauaded by Communist propaganda to desie:e 
from the civil var. Seeing their wilful inertia, Chiang Kak-ohek wont in person to eebeke 
theen On 12 December 1936 he nes made prisoner by Chang hsuoh-liang and Yang Hneheng. 
Such vas the famous "Sian Incident", which plunged the people into stupefaction. But 
popular reaction was quite different from what tins hoped for by the captors. On this 
occasion one could put his finger on the profound respect and affection felt by the 
Chinese people for their chief. Before the attitude of t-ne people end of the government, 
the rebellious generals were compelled to release the "oncralieeimo" on tke evening of 
25 December. Mon the news became known throuTeaut the country, the enthusiasm vas as 
delirious as consternation had been keen since ne capture. The authors of the coup d'etat 
were made prisoners or deprived of paver and their troops transferred to the south. A 
loyal army came to replace them and to begin the blockade of the Sovietized zone. 
The non-aseression agreement concluded between the Comnuniets and the 'northwest" 
army was not however effective for lone. Frustrated in their hopes, the Reds intensified 
their eropaganda for mien of all parties against Japan and the ceseacdon of civil var. 
The Comintern, in the course of the Seventh Congrees of the Third Internationale, approved 
this reversal of attitude, for the international situation vies becomine more and more 
menacing, followine the Anti-Comintern Pact of 25 Dovember 1936, between Goemaret Italy 
and Japan; it was necessary to cease civil 11 r in China in order to oppose her aeainet Jaeae, 
and therefore to ask the Chinese Soviets to find a ;round of agreement with the national 
government by sacrificing for a time certain essential points of the Marxist pronenn. 
On 10 February 1937, the Central Committee of the Communist Party sent a letter to the 
Nankine government and to the Third Plenary Assembly of the K12T0 proposing a coesetion 
of the civil very freedom of speech, press, and assembly, zelease of political prisoners, 
settilv up of a plan of resistance to Japanese aggression and return to the "Three Peoplecs 
Principles" of Sun Yat-sen. In return they promised to change the name of the Rod armyand that of Soviet governnent, to realize a democratic form of government in the Red areas, 
to suspend the policy of land confiscation and to concentrate all their efforts on the task 
of resisting the aggressor.

:T we can believe Elmo Tse-tung. in 1943 there were 64 per cent of the Japanese forces in 
territory controlled by the Reds as against 36 per cent in the kW zone; in 1944, the pro-
pertion was slightly different; 56 per cent in "pa-lu" country and 44 per sent on the 
eouthern front. Let us admit for a moment that these figures are exact. Do they nece

.';eese :figures -- if they aro real, we repent -- is quite different, in our opinion. Tho 
apanese lived on north China 412 an economic and industrial way, they supervised all the

From the oelitical point of IRESTRICTEDgoIng to develop a neu ideology utone 
basis is the acceptance of a revolutionary three principles of the people, such as one 
finds in some of the first yorks of Sun Yat-sen. They wore then oolno to dispute with 
the HUT the inheritance of the three principles. According to a small tract circulated 
in the 1943 campalgn, here are the chief lines in this neu body of doctrines. 
China must pass throuoh several steles before arriving at tho goal of a socialist 
earthly paradise. In effect, one can arranse in Um groups all the aspects of revolution; 
one is the democratic revolution, the other is tho socialist revolution. China is not 
yet ripe for the socialist era, she must first pass through the democratic Anse. Th13 
democratic revolution, however, is no longer the French revolution of 1709, that of the 
17th century in England, of 1)11 in China, yhich yore born at a time when capitalism Yes 
in full grouth; in China a neo-democratic revolution is necessery, similar to the hussian 
revolution of February 1905 brought about in the period of imperialism; that is to say, in 
good Marxist doctrine, in the period of decadent capitalism. The one is capitalist 
democracy, the other is socialist democracy, the stage of transition. The Chinese revalue 
tion is of course not an affair of any particular country, it is a linh in an immense chain 
of world revolution vhich began with the Russian revolution of October 1)17. "Assuredly 
socialism is a stage far superior to tho rico domocracy; vie olll realize it some day, but 
actual conditions do not pernit us to do more than dream of it". (27) Ay? Because in China 
there still exist many survivals of the obscurantist past, yhich hinder social nroyess; 
besides China no longer has full political independence to eller: her elbou room. 
The rico-democratic revolution has for its nission to bring the theories of Sun Yat-son 
to full bloom, for the triple revolution, national, political and social, advocated by the 
"Father of the Nation" has not yet been achieved. 
At first what eill be the essence of the ney State? Modified capitalism or 
socialism? Neither one nor the other. "The neo-democratic republic has neither a 
capitalist administration nor a proletarian government; it is a denocracy directed by all 
the revolutionary classes operating togother". In these terms the dictatorship of the 
proletariat is abandoned. The verbal concession is a limited one. 3ofore the skepticism 
ohich this statement- ould cause, Ilao Tse-tuno felt obliged to give reaosreino words 1-et 
year, at the seventh national party congress. "Some ask if the Communists, once in pouer? 
eill establish the dictatorship of the proletariat and a ono-party nsvernment as in tho 
USSR. Ile can say to such persons that a neo-democratic state c netituted by the union of 
all democratic classes is dif"orent in principle from a socialist state uith dictatorship 
of the prole:on:lat. China, during the period of her neo-democratic syoton, cannot have, 
and ought not to have, a government monopolized by one party. :le have no eoason for not 
co-operating with non-Conmunist tartieo yho agree to york yith us and are not hostile to us 
(28, 
The practical form yhich this not; democracy cull adopt oil be a tripartite government: 
ono-third composed of members of the Communist party, one-third of prooreeeive ropreoenta-
Ulm of the capitalist class, and finally a last third of delegates of the middle claso. 
Often this generous  diointereetedness of the party does not prevent them from having a 
high hand for effective direction. Aro not its members the leaven which gives life to 
tho uhole lump? So they will to fully justified in being of first rami: in the new city. 
To assume their role of leadership, they -All have recourse neither to vie:Lome nor to 
dependence on fixed lens like the MIT, but will rely on the confidence ale protection of 
the multitude. 
If the form of the non government is nideuay betmen capitalism and socialism, the 
same is true of the economy of the nevi state. In this field, the grand coacession of the 
party is the recognition of of the right of ounership and the cossatyon of land-
confiscation, a condition gine mom imposed by the MT for collaboratton between the 
two parties. As the rural class comprises the enormous majority of the notion, stay 8) per-
cent, it is the principal force on which the nay regime roots. Moreover in its solicitude 
for the peasants, the nee-democratic state proclaims very hist equality in rights to the 
soil? Yet tho amelioration of peasant conditions must be obtained -without injwf.ng the 
landoeners1 rights- it is stfficient to limit land-rent and interest, that is to say, the 
profits of the lanherds? while leaving to them their lands. In 1945, U20 Tse-tug on 
-
affirmed the some doctrine in the re ort already cited; "Since the outbreae of hostilitlee? 
the Communist Party has madc a great concession in replacing the policy of "Land to the 
tiller by that of reduction of rent and interest -- To unite all classes in the anti-Jap 
anese Common Front, we rapt not deprive tin landlord of his right to prepwty? but namely 
persuade him to accept reascnable rent and interest, and encoura7,e him to tneeei, his

'ens boon the landlord and the usurer, or, in other words, the feudal forces. It was 
then necessary to divide private property and hill landlorde In order to weaken the 
forces of reaction. But gradually tho danger of Japanese invasion has onershadeued the 
evils of Chinese feudalism. You have been able to see with your own eyes that the 
tereor inspired by tho hostile army exceedod by -far the op= ;aion of feudal lords eur 
immediate objective is to free China from her semi-colonial status. This is the actual 
phase ot the Chinese Revolution. The revolutionary forces included peasants above all, 
but else laedloroe ani eeeitalists. That is what re call the National United Front". (SO) 
Such are the verde of the political chiefs, the ideas expressod in journals and re-
v:teas, Did real conditions coereolond to these statement? It seems that it is often 
necesserente eey yes, for reasons entirely different from the motives alleged; but this 
was for from being absolute, and vtried ereetle-vith different sections. 
Collaboration between theNUT and the Communist Party during the war pith Japan was 
marked by several clashes. The Communist press organs in Chunekine yore under close 
eueveillance; at one time the famous "Shongbuo" (Life) bookstore, the .rout center of 
"leftist" publications, was temporarily closed alonseith its numerous branches; con- " 
centration camps were filled with dissidents. One of the most important events was tho 
attack in 1940, south of the Yangtze in the rogioe of Shanghai, of a"Nea Fourth" de-
tachment by a group of governnont soldiers; the chief officer, Yoh Twin, nae eaetured? 
his deputy HsSeng Xing and several of the staff were killed and reelaced in turn by 
Chen Yi; this man took general command of the army in ',lace of Yoh ring, who crashed 
an airplane carrying him from Chungking to Yemen (Uey or Juno 1946) 
Eau the mar is over. Are the theories of "neo-denocracy" still current? It is 
? certain that the press campaign is on the whole much leseened. Is their eropaelnda role 
then finished? Yes, so it would seem; was not that a wartime ideolo;y thousht up to 
camouflage the real ends of the party behind a visible facade of patriotism and to give 
to Narxiam equasi-bourgeaist beniens good and saintly look? But something of it ro-
reine 
in now eloean launched by Mao Tse-tung, "federated government", uhichlexposes his 
peetenr plan: winfiti&i, of the government monopolized by the KW and representation by 
all parties -- liberty of speech, association, publication, thought, and loyalty, ---.---

changed a bet. It is the policy of opportunism, so combated of late by the same Jae Tee-
tueg; for it matters above all else for the success of the propaganda that the Communist 
Paehy repudiate at least in words his political utterances. 
The same American journalist whom tie have quoted oeveral times, finally put the 
foLscaing, question in the course of his interview nith Deo Tse-tang: "Do you mean to say
