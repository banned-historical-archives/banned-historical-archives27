 SUBJECT         :    Warning Assessment:  East Asia
 The following items were discussed by the Community
 Representatives at the 18 June Warning Meeting.
 2.   Korea -- In the ROK, General Chon Doo Huan's recent activities
 suggested to analysts that he is using the textbook written by Park
 Chong Hee to move toward seizing power and establishing one-man rule.
 It was also observed, however, that if Chon hopes to succeed within
 the time-frame now being considered for constitutional reform and

 elections (a completion of the new constitional draft by October, a
 referendum by the end of the year, and elections possibly by next
 June) the only way he can do so would be through massive rigging of
 the polls.   Chon's problem is his unpopularity combined with the
 battered state of the two political parties -- the DRP is decimated
 and although the NDP, while still in being, is weakened -- which
 might require him to organize a new party.   It was speculated that
 if Kim Yong San ran against Chon, Kim would win.
 3.  Analysts added that if Chon does attempt to rig the election,
 he would face the question of public reaction.   There is also the
 question of how the public will accept a new constitution containing
 elements of the old Yushin constitution, e.g., strong one-man rule and
 government control of the National Assembly. Cl
 4.  Analysts agreed that for the moment, at least, the country is
 quiet.   Student activitists had been arrested or frightened into
 passivity and the Kwangju riots have not caused people outside the
 Cholla provinces to react.  Nevertheless, the government will need to
 allow a number of schools to open soon and other unknown factors could
 go to work and create problems.   There is a possibility of
 assassination and terrorist activities generated by Kwangju students.
 The government is watching the schools, and there is a brigade of
 special forces assigned to the campuses. =
 5.  Analysts termed the economic situation less than good, but
 commented also that economic activity was beginning to pick up again.
 The visit of Ex-Im Bank President Moore had helped in this regard by
 restoring a measure of economic confidence.   Commercial banks are
 following a wait and see policy with respect to further investments,
 but have lots of money available and are conscious of the need to
 protect investments already made.   The unemployment figure stands at
 five percent, but there have been no further labor demonstrations;
 workers appear to understand that if they demand too much they will be
 worse off. D
 6.  With the security situation quiet, US-ROK relations are
 satisfactory.   The Combined Forces Command is functioning, and ROK
 troops used to suppress the Kwangju riots are back to normal positions.
 US-ROK military cooperation has resumed.   General Wickham's deputy in
 the CFC has been appointed to the Special Committee National Security
 Matters (the new military  dominated control mechanism) but may be
 removed. II
 7.   In the North, analysts had not perceived any unusual military
 indicators.   Troops were engaged in normal activities for this time
 of year, including agriculture.  However, during May 280,000 people in
 Chongjin had been blood-typed, which suggested that the same thing

 prepared for war.
 had occurred elsewhere.   This could be read as an indication that
 the North Koreans were getting their civilian population better
 8.   China -- Following up last month's discussion, analysts
 called attention to possible frictions at the top on economic issues,
 as indicated by a spate of Peoples Daily editorials.   For example,
 criticisms had been leveled at unnamed people who had favored a
 faster pace of modernization -- an issue on which Hua Guofeng is
 vulnerable, in addition to his vulnerability on the question of
 material incentives.  Nevertheless, the tone of such editorials was
 neither sharp nor accusative.
 9.  Analysts assume that Deng Xiaoping would indeed resign from
 his governmental position in August, taking Li Xiannian, Yeh Jianying,
 and perhaps Hua Guofeng with him.  Hua would thus be left with only
 the Party Chairmanship.   It appeared from editorials and other evidence
 that the top leaders were presently thrashing out issues before the
 major meetings scheduled for later this year.  Analysts referred to
 the differences between Hua Guofeng's and Zhao Ziyang's  definitions of
 Zhao's duties as Vice Premier, which suggested that Hua might try to
 hang on to the Premiership. II
 on Kampuchea and Pol Pot.
 10.   On the subject of Sino-US relations, analysts felt that the
 Chinese are quiet satisfied with the present state of affairs.   The
 4 June Holbrooke speech and Geng Biao's visit to the US had generated
 favorable Chinese comments, along with statements affirming coincidence
 of strategic views between the two countries.   On the Geng Biao visit
 itself, the Peoples Daily commentary spoke first of all about this
 coincidence of views, and accorded less importance to US arms sales.
 There were, however, the "usual differences between the US and China
 11.  As an indicator of the current state of Sino-US relations,
 analysts commented on the large number of people traveling from each
 country to the other.   This had also occurred, it was pointed out, in
 the case of France, when in the early days of Sino-French relations
 similar flow of visits had occurred.   The present volume of US-PRC
 travel nevertheless was much greater. F
 12.   One analyst remarked upon the key role which Hong Kong is
 assuming in Chinese policy.   The Chinese are putting their representatives
 into Hong Kong business and commercial concerns in significant numbers,
 probably to train their people in business practices but also suggesting
 that Hong Kong has a long-term part to play in China's economic develop-
 ment. F I

 13.   Commenting upon the Chinese refusal to respond to Soviet
 feelers on improving Sino-Soviet relations, analysts judged that
 Beijing's present policies, including expanded relations with the US,
 are more valuable to the Chinese then achieving some easing of tensions,
 with the Soviets along the border.   There was agreement that a failure
 to continue to realize such benefits could generate some pressures for
 a change, although there was no sign of this now.   There was some
 speculation that if the Soviets revealed that their bid had been
 rejected, a considerable degree of ferment could be generated within
 the Chinese Foreign Ministry and PLA.  Apropos of possible potential
 problems in US-Communist relations, attention was called to the
 Peoples Daily editorial critizing Governor Reagan's China policy.  F
 14.  No particular change in the Soviet OB along the Chinese
 border had been observed, except for the addition of a new Backfire
 regiment.   The Soviets had also undertaken a succession of command post
 exercises with the Transbaikal and Far Eastern military districts
 25X1
 under command of the new headquarters entity set up last year. I 25X1
 15.   Philippines -- Reference was made to the reported manifesto
 of anti-Marcos activities provided to the Department of State by
 Senator Aquino, which called for a united front including the
 Communists against Marcos as well as armed demonstrations.   Analysts
 recalled that a similar manifesto had occurred during elections some
 two years ago and this added nothing new.   It was agreed that the
 Philippine situation merited close watching, however. ^                       25X1
 16.   Indochina -- Analysts addressed the security situation in
 Kampuchea, noting that the Vietnamese and Heng Semrin forces were
 having difficulties in maintaining control over the roads, although
 the level of DK attacks had not reached a point requiring special
 attention.   Eastern Kampuchea was said to be fairly secure, but
 communications elsewhere were being hit; e.g., Route 4 struck one
 time, and a press report of an attack on a train NW of Phnom Penh
 confirmed.  Not all these attacks were attributable to the DK; some
 were caused by elements which were essentially bandits.  Heavy rains
 were now occurring, and Route 6 was under water.  WN casualties were
 evidently fairly low, and Vietnamese troops were undertaking operations
 of their own.   On the other hand, whole units of Heng Samrin troops
 had been deserting.
 17.   The DK forces were described as being well supplied with small
 arms and mines, with the expectation of receiving 1600 additional tons
 of arms aid by the end of the summer.   Hence they were well able to do
 what they would do -- intensify operations against the Vietnamese.

 So far, though, this intensification had not occurred.   There was no
 disagreement over the thesis that the DK forces would be in a more
 difficult position in the next dry season if they failed to take
 25
 action now.
 18.   Considerable discussion ensued over  the  size of the DK forces,
 with one view maintaining that the total was around 50,000 but with
 the upper limit of combat or main force units being 30-35,000 with the
 rest consisting of transport troops, militia, etc.  Questioned closely
 on the methodology for putting forth this view, the analyst concerned
 outlined the steps through which his judgment was reached.   SIGINT
 was the basic tool.   The possibility was raised that force levels in
 DK communications were purposely inflated as a propaganda device, to
 which the analyst responded that DK activity reports had been collated
 with PAVN reports as well as with Thai intelligence estimates of DK
 troops strengths and all roughly tallied.   The NSA representative added
 that the DK units had been attempting to preserve communications security
 and that there was no reason to question the DK communications.  All
 agreed that the best anyone could come up with on DK strength was an
 educated guess.   Inter alia it was observed that the DK were presently

 10    n?  rhp  nn1;rira1  side-  it was reported that the!
 There was a possibility from this and some other similar in i.ca ions
 of more Chinese aid going to the K'PLF or the Khmer Serai.  The Thai
 had been trying to bring together Son Sann and Khieu Samphan.   The
 Heng Samrin units which had deserted had gone over Son Sann,not to the
 DK, and the Son Sann also claimed penetration into every part of
 Kampuchea.
 20.  Attention was also called to signs of possible increased Chinese
 attention to Northern Laos as an area for stepped-up anti-Vietnamese
 activity, as indicated by an unusual number of air flights between Hainan,
 where the Lao refugees accepted by China from camps in Thailand had been
 relocated, to areas along the Chinese border with Laos.   Conceivably
 the Chin            raining some of these refugees for guerrilla operations
 in Laos.
 21.  Analysts speculated on the motivations and significance of the
 purported decision of the Thai to ask the Chinese to stop supplying
 the DK forces through Thailand.   In this regard, Air Marshal Sitthi was
 quoted as saying that what the DK needed was food, not arms, for rainy
 season operations.   It was conceivable therefore that the DK in fact
 already had all the arms necessary for the current level of attacks.
 Mention was made of an island off Trad province in the Gulf of Thailand

 which was being used as a covert support base, and there was some
 speculation that logistical support efforts might be concentrated there
 in a more secure environment.         There had been agreement between the
 Chinese and Thai to "cool it" on the score of military aid to the DK
 during the Thach visit to Thailand, and the Thai and Chinese might now
 be playing some kind of a shadow game.
 22.   On the subject of the forthcoming ASEAN Foreign Ministers
 Meeting in Kuala Lumpur, analysts assumed that the main question which
 Secretary Muskie would be asked was how the US would vote in the next
 UN General Assembly on Kampuchean representation.   Besides this, there
 was an underlying question on the score of US-Chinese relations and
 what they entailed for Southeast Asia.   The Indonesians and Malaysians
 were not persuaded that the developing relationships between the US
 and China were not being undertaken at their expense.
 F
 25X1

 23.  Analysts suggested that the Thai might run into problems
 connected with the new effort to repatriate Kampuchean refugees from
 the camps located in Thailand.  Nobody much was anxious to return --
 only 500 to 600 people had agreed to go -- and the Vietnamese were
 also objecting.   There was a chance that the Vietnamese might try to
 scare some of the repatriates back into Thailand. I
 communicators remained at Danang.   There was no indication to suggest
 that the Soviets were in any way cutting back on their aid to Vietnam.
 24.   The Soviet presence in Vietnam was touched upon briefly.   It
 appeared that the Soviets were concentrating this presence at Cam Ranh
 Bay by moving their air activities there from Danang.  However, Soviet

 25.   Thailand -- The performance of Prime Minister Prem since he
 assumed office was summed up as not being too good.   So far Prem had
 escaped serious criticism, but a critical point could come in about three 25X1
 months more unless he faced up to some of Thailand's pressing problems.
 This point in time would coincide with the date of announcing new
 military promotions, which could also cause additional trouble for Prem. F-1
