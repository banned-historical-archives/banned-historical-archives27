 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 EAST-WEST RELATIONS   .         .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 1
 While Khrushchev probably did not intend to torpedo
 the summit conference when he began to exploit the air-
 craft incident on 5 May, he completely miscalculated the
 nature of Washington's reaction and then interpreted Ameri-
 can official statements as defiance of the USSR and as an
 affront to his own prestige and that of the Soviet Union.
 Khrushchev apparently had decided before he left for Paris
 on 14 May to break up the summit meeting by confronting
 President Eisenhower with patently unacceptable demands
 regarding the U-2 incident, cast in the most insulting
 terms.
 Khrushchev's press conference in Paris on 18 May sug-
 gests that for the foreseeable future he will vigorously
 press his bitter anti-American campaign on the U-2 issue.
 Moscow has already requested an urgent-session of the UN
 Security Council.  However, his treatment of other East-
 West issues, together with the line being taken both pub-
 licly and privately by other Soviet spokesmen,  is designed
 to create the impression that the USSR does not intend to
 make any sharp reversals in the other major lines of its
 foreign policy.  Khrushchev has continued his threats of
 retaliation against those countries which have Amer_
 bases, and pressure on them will probably increase.
 TURKISH INTERNAL SITUATION .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 3
 There have been few demonstrations in Turkey during
 the past week, but the political climate remains tense,
 and new outbreaks of violence may be imminent.  The cities
 of Istanbul and Ankara continue under martial law, the
 universities in those cities remain closed, and the parlia-
 mentary investigating committee continues to probe the
 activities of the opposition Republican People's party
 (RPP) and the press.  The army continues to maintain pub-
 licly its traditional aloofness from internal politics,

 CUBA AND THE CARIBBEAN .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 4
 Castro's National Institute of Agrarian Reform in its
 first year has transformed most of the Cuban economy and
 is continuing to expropriate agricultural land and estab-
 lish new industrial enterprises, including a refinery to
 process Soviet crude oil.    There are new indications of
 closer relations with Communist China.  Castro's takeover
 on 16 May of Cuba's last outspoken independent newspaper
 will heighten criticism of his regime in Latin America.
 Elsewhere in the Caribbean,  international feeling against
 the Trujillo regime in the Dominican Republic continues
 to grow, but there is little change in Truj?illo's domestic
 situation.
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 ALGERIAN LOCAL ELECTIONS .       .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 1
 The local elections to be held in Algeria on 29 May
 are opposed by both the Algerian rebels and European ex-
 tremists; each group is anxious to prevent the emergence
 of any group favorable to an Algerian solution based on
 association with France.         This opposition, together with
 widespread indifference, appears to jeopardize De Gaulle's
 hope that the elections will create a "third force" of
 Moslem moderates.
 MOROCCAN LEFTISTS SCORE GAINS   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  1
 The left-wing Moroccan National Union of Popular
 .Forces has recently gained in prestige and strength.   Its
 labor wing has received formal backing from the King, and
 it has won numerous seats in local chambers of commerce
 and industry, previously strongholds of the rightist
 Istigial party.   Leftist leaders have also renewed at-
 tempts to wrest control of all military and police forces
 from the King and are demanding a constitution clearly
 defining governmental responsibilities.

 security forces in the wake of recent unrest have been
 denounced by the leader of the National Congo Movement,
 Patrice Lumumba, who may hope to establish himself as the
 de facto premier of a united Congo prior to the agreed 30
 June independence date.
 DISORDERS IN NORTHERN RHODESIA .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 4
 The recent African nationalist disorders in the mining
 areas of the British protectorate of Northern Rhodesia em-
 phasize the growing political and racial tension there.
 The government has acted vigorously to repress the disturb-
 ances and to outlaw the responsible African political party,
 but disorders are likely to recur because native grievances
 are not being satisfied.

 INDIAN COMMUNISTS FAIL TO RESOLVE POLICY SPLIT .              .  .  .  .  .   Page 6
 Indian Communist leaders have failed in a new effort
 to resolve their deep differences over the party's future
 course of action.  The policy dispute between proponents
 of a moderate line and those favoring more aggressive
 tactics is focused on the degree of support to be given
 Nehru.  The moderate faction, supported by Moscow, has re-
 tained control, but the extremists, encouraged by Peiping's
 harder line, seem to be gaining ground.   Should Moscow,
 in the wake of developments at the summit conference, re-
 vert to a hard line, the position of these extremists pre-
 sumably would be strengthened.

 South Korean Acting Chief of State Huh Chung is making
 sweeping personnel changes in the government, but at the
 same time is trying to minimize the adverse effects on gov-
 ernment operations.  Prospects for improved relations be-
 tween Seoul and Tokyo have been dimmed by Huh's firm oppo-
 sition to the present program for the re atriation
 Koreans in Japan to North Korea.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 May 1960
 PART II  (continued)
 POLITICAL MANEUVERING FOR NEW GOVERNMENT IN LAOS  .  .  .  .  .   Page  8
 The Social Democratic party, newly formed by the mili-
 tantly anti-Communist Committee for Defense of National
 Interests (CDNI), will probably be called on by the King
 to form a new Laotian Government.   Selection of a compro-
 mise figure such as the party's parliamentary leader Tiao
 Somsanith seems likely.          Installation of CDNI leader Gen-
 eral Phoumi would probably trigger a renewal of insurgency
 by the Pathet Lao, which retains the capability to wage
 large-scale dissident activity.  Chou En-lai and North
 Vietnamese Premier Pham Van Dong have termed the situation
 in Laos "dangerous" and called for reactivation of the
 International Control Commission.

 CIRCLES   .  .    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page
 Pro-Communists appear to be making steady progress in
 their program of consolidating strength in Singapore's
 labor movement and in Chinese schools, although for the
 time being they are avoiding an open showdown with the
 government.   Increasing pro-Communist influence is reflect-
 ed  in the withdrawal of the Singapore Trades Union Con-
 gress (STUC) from the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions and the appointment of six prominent extrem-

 The Indonesian Government has not developed a mass
 campaign protesting Dutch moves to augment military forces
 in Netherlands New Guinea (West Irian), but the Indonesian
 Communist party has coordinated anti-Dutch student demon-
 strations in four major cities.                                  Army and civilian offi-
 cials appear to be awaiting President Sukarno's return
 from a global tour in early June, presuming that he will
 chart the course of Indonesia's reaction to Dutch moves.
 In the interim,. the Indonesian Navy is conducting training
 exercises in waters adjacent to West Irian.   The West
 Irian issue increasingly diverts public attention from
 the anti-Communist,  anti-Sukarno campaign of the Demo-
 cratic League and from Sino-Indonesian friction over the
 Overseas Chinese problem.
 SINO-INDONESIAN DISPUTE SHARPENS .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 11
 Peiping's determination to champion the "rights and
 interests" of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia has led to new
 frictions in Sino-Indonesian relations and precludes an
 early settlement of the dispute between the two countries-

 PART II  (continued)
 Peiping has
 roug          the dispute into the open with
 an angry protest over the house arrest of a Chinese consul
 for interference in the processing of Overseas Chinese de-
 siring repatriation.   Djakarta's response has been to de-
 mand  the withdrawal of this and another  consul.
 OUTLOOK FOR CHINA'S STEEL INDUSTRY .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 12
 Communist China, which produced only 2,850,000 tons
 of steel in 1955, expects to turn out more than 18,000,000
 tons this year and may well be producing at an annual rate
 in excess of 35,000,000 tons in 1965.    This would make
 China the third or fourth largest steel producer in the
 world. Even this amount, however, would still be far from
 adequate--in terms of quantity, quality, and variety--to
 meet all the demands of the country's burgeoning industry.
 COMMONWEALTH MEETING HIGHLIGHTS   .  .  .. .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 14
 Despite the much-publicized dissension over South
 Africa's racial policies,  the two-week meeting of Common-
 wealth prime ministers which concluded on 13 May found an
 unusually high degree of agreement on general international
 developments.  Nehru's preoccupation with dangers posed by
 Communist China marked the principal change from previous
 meetings, and he refrained from complaining about defense
 pacts.  Cordiality seemed to develop between Nehru and
 Pakistani President Ayub during the meeting.
 COMMON MARKET DEVELOPMENTS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 15
 The decision of the council of the European Economic
 Community (EEC) on 12 May to proceed with a modified ver-
 sion of President Hallstein's acceleration plan is the most
 important EEC development of the past two years.              In sev-
 eral respects, the EEC is already ahead of schedule, and
 its internal development and consolidation are now likely
 to be further advanced.  By reaffirming the intention of
 the six member countries to proceed with the establishment
 of a full customs union, the EEC has apparently given the
 rest of Western Europe little choice but to come to terms
 with it.
 FRENCH COMMUNISTS WINNING ELECTORAL SUPPORT   .  .

 In a number of French local elections since the Janu-
 ary rightist revolt in Algeria, non-Communist candidates
 of the left have demonstrated increased unity and have

 indicate a nationwide pattern,  the trend has received sup-
 port from influential Le Monde editor Jacques Fauvet, who on
 7 May publicly recommended that the left ally itself with
 the Communists to halt the "disappearance" of French democ-
 racy under De Gaulle's Fifth Republic.
 IMPENDING SPLIT IN FINNISH LABOR ORGANIZATION   .
 The defeat of the moderate Social Democrats in the 14
 May meeting of the executive council of the Finnish Confed-
 eration of Labor (SAK) is expected to split Finland's
 major trade union organization.   Some unions will,  in that
 event,  gravitate toward an existing stand-by organization
 under moderate control, leaving the remainuer of SAK domi-
 nated by the Communists and radical Social Democrats.   SAK's
 rupture would aggravate both Socialist factionalism and the
 continuing parliamentary impasse.

 PANAMANIAN ELECTION AFTERMATH   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .            Page 19
 Announcement of the results of Panama's 8 May national
 elections may be delayed for a further week or more.  Oppo-
 sition presidential candidate Roberto Chiari is widely be-
 lieved to have defeated both his opponents,  including the
 favored candidate of the government party.
 RESENTMENT AGAINST US COMPANIES IN PERU   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 20
 Mounting resentment against US and other foreign com-
 panies in Peru was demonstrated in the effective nation-
 wide 24-hour general strike called on 13 May to protest
 recent "massacres" of workers and peasants at two US-
 owned properties and earlier incidents on the premises of
 other foreign companies.  This resentment is likely to
 play a part in the long-standing controversy over the
 legal status of oil lands belonging to a Standard Oil Com-
 pany subsidiary when this issue is considered at a special
 session of the Peruvian Congress some time after 20 May.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 VLADIMIR DUDINTSEV'S A ,NEW YEAR'S TALE .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 1
 The publication of the latest work of controversial
 writer Vladimir Dudintsev again demonstrates the Soviet
 regime's dilemma in attempting to control its restive in-
 telligentsia without sacrificing its post-Stalin relaxa-
 tion of tension.  The story, A New Year's Tale,                       is veiled
 in symbolism and is unorthodox in content.   Its ambigui-
 ties permit it to be interpreted as an attack on dogmatism
 and materialism in the Communist party.  Apparently reluc-
 tant to focus public attention on such an equivocal work,
 Soviet authorities have almost ignored its publication.
 Their restraint, however, will encourage other artists
 and writers to further unorthodoxy.
 PORTUGAL AND ITS AFRICAN POSSESSIONS .  . .  .  .  .       .  .  .  Page 4
 Portugal is increasingly disturbed over the impact of
 Africa's political evolution on its own African possessions,
 which are the last substantial part of the continent under
 unmodified colonial rule.  The territories are of consider-
 able economic importance to Lisbon, which seems determined
 to maintain its paternalistic regime there by tough police
 action and to demand implicit Western support of this policy.
 While no serious native outbreaks in Portuguese Africa have
 been reported, agitation directed from neighboring terri-
 tories is clearly on the rise.
 IRAQ:  NATION OF MINORITIES   .

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 May 1960
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 While Khrushchev probably
 did not intend to torpedo the
 summit conference when on 5
 May he began to exploit the
 aircraft incident, he complete-
 ly miscalculated the nature of
 Washington's reaction and then
 interpreted American official
 statements as defiance of the
 USSR and as an affront to his
 own prestige and that of the
 Soviet Union. Khrushchev ap-
 parently had decided before he
 left for Paris on 14 May to
 break up the summit meeting by
 confronting President Eisen-
 hower with patently unacceptable
 demands regarding the U-2 inci-
 dent, cast in the most insulting
 terms.
 Several Soviet and satel-
 lite sources claim privately
 that Khrushchev's behavior in
 Paris stemmed from a feeling of
 "humiliation" in the face of
 the American "defiance," which
 had the effect of placing the
 USSR in the position of a "sec-
 ond-class power."  Following
 the meeting of the heads of gov-
 ernment on 16 May, the Soviet
 premier reportedly complained
 bitterly to bloc diplomats about
 President Eisenhower.
 Khrushchev also stated he ha
 been prepared to close out the
 incident immediately if the
 President had said he was un-
 aware of the flights or had dis-
 approved.   Bloc diplomats in
 Moscow emphasized to American
 officials that Khrushchev had
 been placed in a "bad position"
 of inequality because of the
 American statements,which they
 viewed as indicating that over-
 flights would continue.
 The abruptness and closely
 held nature of Moscow's shift
 was reflected by considerable
 evidence that the Soviet propa-
 ganda apparatus was forced into
 a complete reversal following
 Khrushchev's opening Statement
 in Paris on 16 May.
 Post-Summit Policy
 Khrushchev's 18 May press
 conference suggests that he will
 vigorously press his bitter anti-
 American campaign in an attempt
 to brand the US as responsible
 for preventing a summit meeting
 and a relaxation of tensions.
 In an effort to secure the ini-
 tiative following the collapse
 of the summit, Gromyko requested
 an urgent meeting of the UN Se-
 curity Council to "examine the
 question of aggressive acts by
 the air  force  of  the  US,
 creating  a threat  to  peace."

 Khrushchev indicated earlier
 that Moscow would counter any
 setback in the Security Council
 with action in the General As-
 sembly.   Moscow will also at-
 tempt to keep the issue alive
 with a trial of the American
 pilot.
 Khrushchev's extemporane-
 ous remarks on other East-West
 issues at his press conference,
 together with the line taken
 privately by Soviet spokesmen,
 are designed to give the im-
 pression that Moscow does not
 intend to make any sharp re-
 versals in the other major lines
 of its foreign policy.
 In an apparent reference
 to   the American  announcement
 of 7 May,   Khrushchev  warned,
 however, that  if  the  US
 conducted tests for research
 purposes, the USSR would follow
 by testing "nuclear weapons."
 He also said that the USSR was
 "almost convinced" that the West
 did not want disarmament and
 that if Moscow met with further
 "procrastination," it -would
 take the disarmament question
 to the UN.
 Khrushchev took a similar
 position in his press conference,
 but he warned that the USSR had
 almost reached the "limits" of
 its effort to conclude a treaty
 with both Germanys  and that
 when this point way reached, the
 treaty would be signed and an-
 nounced to the world.
 The charge that the United
 States wrecked the Paris talks
 with its "provocative" actions
 against the Soviet Union remains
 the central theme of Moscow's
 propaganda.   President Eisen-
 hower's statement of 16 May that
 overflights have been suspended
 was not reported at first, but
 bloc commentators have followed
 Khrushchev's lead in dismissing
 the statement as a mere "maneuver
 to avoid responsibility."  So-
 viet media report mass meetings
 in the Soviet. Union denouncing
 American "treachery and provo-
 cation," and both.President
 Eisenhower and Secretary Herter
 are personally attacked in bit-
 ter terms.   Following selective
 jamming of broadcasts on the
 plane incident, Moscow on 17
 May apparently resumed massive
 jamming of VOA Russian-language
 broadcasts.
 Despite the harsh attacks
 against the US, Moscow broad-
 casts have conveyed no immediate

 sense of crisis and have given
 no undue stress to claims of
 Soviet military strength. In
 an unusual move shortly after
 Khrushchev's 18 May press con-
 ference, TASS began transmitting
 an account of a New York Times
 article in which     p oma     n
 `Moscow" are cited as claiming
 that Khrushchev plans no change
 in his policies of basing mili-
 tary strength on rockets, rais-
 ing the standard of living, and
 widening contacts with the out-
 side world.
 Chinese Communist Reaction
 As the summit approached,
 Chinese leaders seemed resigned
 to the fact that the meetings
 would be held but maintained
 their line that "no unrealistic
 illusions" should be entertained
 toward the United States, the
 "number-one enemy of world peace."
 On 14 May, 'Mao Tse-tung stated
 that despite "big or small a-
 chievements," the winning of
 world peace must depend "ma.inly"
 on resolute struggle.   He went
 on to say that he hoped that
 these people--i.e.,,Khrushchev--
 who have described Eisenhower as
 a man who "cherishes peace"
 would be awakened'by recent'"ag-
 gressivef'  American actions.
 Mao's remarks suggested some
 apprehension that an accord
 might be reached which would
 undercut his policy of unremit-
 ting hostility toward the US
 and a desire to go on record as
 saying that summit results would
 not change China's foreign pol-
 icy.
 Peiping's initial comment
 on the summit breakdown im-
 plies that the conference has
 justified  Peiping's  distrust
 of     Khrushchev's policy of
 detente. It   is  probable,
 however,   that  any  Chinese
 action  in  the  wake of  the
 summit  will  be  in  line
 with  the   over-all  Sino-So-
 viet                                                              bloc  policies  Khru-
 shchev                                                                will  develop  out  of
 the  wreckage  of  the  summit.
 TURKISH INTERNAL SITUATION
 There  have  been  few
 demonstrations in Turkey during
 the past week, but the political
 climate remains tense, and new
 outbreaks of violence may be
 imminent.    The cities  of
 Istanbul and Ankara continue
 under martial law, the univer-
 sities in those cities remain
 closed, and the parliamentary
 investigating committee con-
 tinues to probe the activities
 of the oppposition Republican
 People's party (RPP) and the
 press.
 The large reception staged
 by the Democratic party (DP)
 for Premier Menderes on his
 arrival  at Izmir  on 15 May
 resulted  in  brief scuffles
 between government and  RPP
 supporters.  A small student
 demonstration against the gov-
 ernment                                                                  erupted  in Izmir on
 17 May.  Other  clashes  may
 follow throughout Turkey as the
 DP attempts to stage similar
 rallies in rural districts and
 urban communities--a move which

 would stimulate counterdemon-
 strations by the opposition.
 Menderes' repeated refer-
 ences in Izmir to "early elec-
 tions" have caused some con-
 sternation among RPP leaders,
 who fear that the  government
 might attempt to  capitalize
 on their party's present
 weakened condition by such a
 move.  Other reports from
 Turkey,  however,  indicate that
 the prestige of the government
 has reached an all-time low--
 particularly in the cities--
 and it is unlikely that Menderes
 would call for an election un-
 less he were relatively certain
 of winning it.    The attitude of
 the rural voters, among whom
 Menderes has always enjoyed
 widespread support,  is not
 known, Lat some of them may have
 been influenced by returning
 university students,  sent home
 after the demonstrations began
 in late April.
 Economic activity in
 Turkey's principal commercial
 city of Istanbul is reported at
 a standstill,  with all business-
 men viewing the future as uncer-
 tain. The American consul general
 reports that general services
 are totally dependent on the con-
 tinuation of a martial law and
 that any attempt to return the
 city to normal police control
 would result in new and prob-
 ably more violent disorders.
 The hatred of opposition ele-
 ments--including the RPP,  the
 press,  and the students--for the
 premier reportedly has increased
 in recent days,  and they are
 gaining confidence in their abili-
 ty ultimately to defeat him.
 The next move appears to
 be up to the government,   as
 the RPP continues to follow a
 policy of watchful waiting. The
 possibility that Menderes will
 attempt to placate the opposi-
 tion by purging the police,
 abolishing the parliamentary
 investigating commission,  and
 dropping certain cabinet members
 cannot be precluded 'hut would
 not be in line with his previous
 hard attitude toward the opposi-
 tion.   Failure of the govern-
 ment to take further drastic
 repressive action following the
 recent disorders may indicate
 either conflict within the DP
 or the influence of the army.
 The army, while carrying
 out directives to maintain order,
 has publicly continued its tra-
 ditional aloofness from politics;
 The Castro regime completed
 on 17 May the first year of its
 agrarian reform program, which
 .has already transformed most
 of the Cuban economy.   On 15 May
 the National Institute  of
 Agrarian Reform (INRA)  took over
 the entire 272,000 acres of
 the United Fruit Company's sugar
 growing lands and divided them
 into 27 cooperatives.   The com-
 pany's two sugar mills were not
 taken, but INRA Director Nunez

 growers that if the mills did
 not want to handle the harvest
 from the seized lands, the
 workers have the right to take
 over the mills in the name of
 INRA.
 Nunez Jimenez said that
 $6,000,000 in 20-year bonds
 would be paid for the cane
 land,  although the company.
 values them at $56,000,000.
 Following several recent Su-
 preme Court decisions raising
 evaluations of expropriated
 properties,, a government-con-
 trolled agrarian court system
 headed by the Communist legal
 adviser of INRA reportedly will
 be established soon.
 By the end of the 1960
 sugar harvest, which is now al-
 most completed, most cane land
 will have been taken over by
 INRA.   There is an unverified
 report that INRA will seize the
 mills just before the grinding
 ends in order to have the pro-
 ceeds of at least part of the
 year's sugar sales available to
 help meet its very high expenses.
 INRA admits to having spent
 over $100,000,000 in its first
 year, and at its current esti-
 mated rate of outlay will triple
 that amount soon.
 It is the government's most
 powerful  'instrument, since be-
 sides its dominance of agricul-
 ture,  fishing, cattle raising,
 and commodity marketing,  INRA
 controls much rural construc-
 tion,  18 radio channels, a num-
 ber of hospitals and tourist
 centers, 36 sugar mills, and
 various other industrial enter-
 prises.   It is building a re-
 finery to process Soviet crude
 oil which is already being de-
 livered in small but increasing
 quantities under the Soviet-
 Cuban trade agreement ratified
 on 12 May.
 INRA Director,Nunez Jimenez
 reportedly will leave in the
 near future to study collective
 farms in the USSR, presumably
 as a model for the 764 coopera-
 tives now operating in Cuba and
 the 800 sugar cooperatives he
 announced in. April would be es-
 tablished on nearly 3,000,000
 acres of expropriated cane land.
 When its planned takeovers are
 completed, probably in mid-
 summer,  INRA will control about
 half Cuba's land area and the
 largest part of the arable land.
 Meanwhile, there are new
 indications of closer relations
 with Communist China.   Major
 William Galvez Rodriguez, in-
 spector general of the Cuban
 Armed Forces, reached Peiping
 in early May on an extended
 good-will tour of neutralist and
 bloc countries.   He had at
 least two audiences with Mao-
 Tse-t'ung and,  according to the
 New China News Agency, said on
 12 May that the Cuban people
 desired to intensify their "in-
 timate relationship" with the
 Chinese people and to unite
 with them in opposition to the
 "imperialists of  the US."
 On 16 May, Castro's former
 minister of finance is reported
 to have said that the Cuban Gov-
 ernment is "under heavy pressure"
 to recognize Communist China
 immediately and that he felt
 the move was imminent.   A Cuban-
 China Friendship Association was
 inaugurated in Havana on 14 May,
 with enthusiastic support from
 Cuban extremists, including some
 Castro officials.

 agency, Prensa Latina, which is
 increasingly criticized in oth-
 er Latin American countries for
 its biased reporting, is widen-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 May 1960
 The local elections to be
 held in Algeria on 29 May are
 opposed by both the Algerian
 rebels and European extremists;
 each group is anxious to pre-
 vent the emergence of any group
 favorable to an Algerian solu-
 tion based on association with
 France as envisioned by De
 Gaulle.  This opposition, to-
 gether with widespread. indif-
 ference, appears to jeopardize
 De Gaulle's hope that the elec-
 tions will create a "third
 force" of Moslem moderates.
 Up for election are 452
 seats on advisory "general
 councils" in Algeria's 13 de-
 partments.   French spokesmen
 have indicated that voter par-
 ticipation of 60 percent would
 constitute a "victory" for De
 Gaulle.   It appears doubtful,
 however, that voter participa-
 tion will reach 50 percent with-
 out the army playing an active
 role in turning out the vote.
 Army spokesmen have said they
 will not provide transportation
 for voters except where securi-
 ty,- conditions so require.
 The Algerian rebels have
 attacked the elections  as a
 "sinful masquerade," and have
 exhorted Algerians to boycott
 them.   Rightist Europeans, al-
 though still disorganized as a
 result of arrests in connection
 with the January insurrection,
 are apathetic concerning the
 The left-wing Moroccan
 National Union of Popular Forces
 (UNFP) has recently gained in
 prestige and strength.   Its
 labor wing has received formal
 elections and opposed to any
 candidate who does not favor the
 integration of Algeria with
 France.   In addition, French
 authorities are faced with a
 general discouragement among
 Moslems concerning the prospects
 for an early cease-fire and
 with traditional voter apathy
 concerning local elections.
 Ignoring rumors that the
 elections might be postponed,
 French authorities are working
 to achieve a maximum turnout
 and arguing that "abstention
 aids the rebellion." The rebels,
 however, are expected to step
 up terrorism in the time remain-
 ing before the balloting. The
 near-fatal assassination attempt
 on Algerian deputy Robert Abdes-
 selam in early May may have al-
 ready discouraged some Moslems
 from.running for..off ice .
 general councils.
 Paris hoped at one time
 that these elections would pro-
 duce a new groups of "valid"
 Moslem spokesmen who would co-
 operate with the French Govern-
 ment and previously elected Al-
 gerian representatives in working
 out an Algerian settlement. Al-
 though the new general councilors
 may participate in a proposed
 Paris round table on the Algerian
 problem, the present tendency in
 the French Government is to play
 down the significance of the       25X1
 elections and to stress the merely
 administrative nature of the
 backing from the King, and it
 has won numerous seats on local
 chambers of commerce and in-

 was persuaded last year
 by the crown prince and other
 conservative advisers to permit
 the police to move against the
 leftists. Several score lead-
 ers were imprisoned and some
 clandestine arms; seized by
 the police.   Left-wing leaders,
 who occupy most cabinet-rank
 posts, remained in office, how-
 ever.
 Since then,  the King ap-
 parently has become skeptical
 of the activities of the crown
 prince and other conservatives;
 he appears to be attempting to
 redress the balance between
 rightist and leftist groups.
 Investigation of a purported
 leftist plot to assassinate the
 prince has notably slawed,,
 and some of the leftists im-
 prisoned on this charge have
 been released,  probably on the
 King's intervention.
 The King has recently en-
 couraged the left by granting
 audiences to leftist leaders of
 the Moroccan Labor Union (UMT)--
 which forms the base of the
 UNFP--and by presiding over the
 May Day labor celebration in
 Casablanca.   At the same time,
 he has declined to recognize
 the rival labor group formed in
 March by the Istiqlal party.
 The UMT also gained materially
 when representatives of the non-
 Communist International Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU) strongly backed it and   25X6
 snubbed rightist Moroccan labor
 leaders seeking ICFTU affilia-
 tion.
 The "astonishing victories"
 won by the UNFP in the chambers
 of commerce and industry in
 nationwide elections on 8 May
 include all seats in Tangier and
 a majority in Casablanca.   Em-
 boldened by these gains, the UNFP
 can be expected to seek the max-
 imum number of seats when com-
 munal councils are elected on
 29 May.
 It will also press for
 early provincial and national
 elections and demand the promul-
 gation of a Moroccan constitu-
 tion clearly defining govern-
 ment responsibilities, e.g.,
 limiting the King's authoritarian
 power.  Toward this end the
 Moroccan cabinet recently ap-
 proved a draft decree reorgan-
 izing the government and subor-
 dinating police and military
 services to the appropriate
 ministries.   This measure ap-
 parently has been quietly vetoed
 by the King.   Nevertheless,
 leftist sympathizers within the
 government are certain to con-
 tinue to harass the director
 of national security and to be

 TENSION HIGH IN BELGIAN CONGO
 Prospects for an orderly
 transfer of authority from Bel-
 gium to a Congo government have
 decreased as a result of spread-
 ing racial disorders and a
 sharpened power struggle among
 Congolese leaders.   Belgium's
 moves to reinforce its secu-

 have been denounced by the lead-

 prior to the agreed 30 June in-
 dependence date.

 Although Lumumba has

 strong adverse reactions in

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 May 1960
 80,000 Europeans in Northern
 :Rhodesia wield an influence dis-
 proportionate to their numbers
 and can count on strong support
 from the dominant whites of
 Southern Rhodesia, who would op-
 pose any concessions giving the
 copper riches to Africans.  Thus
 London faces a difficult task in
 trying to balance white settler
 and African interests and in
 avoiding widespread African
 rioting or a breakup of the
 Federation.
 The security situation in
 Northern Rhodesia has been de-
 teriorating in the last few
 months.   The Africans have im-
 proved their political organi-
 zations and have been aroused
 to nationalist extremism by the
 Belgian Congo's rapid approach
 to independence.  In common with
 the natives of Nyasaland--the
 Federation's other protectorate
 under British Colonial Office
 control--the Africans in North-
 ern Rhodesia are increasingly
 opposed to the settler-dominated
 Federation.   The nationalists
 demand its early breakup, and
 they believe they have the sym-
 pathy of British Colonial Secre-
 tary Macleod, who recently toured
 the area.
 UNIP leader Kenneth Kaunda,
 who visited the United States
 during the period of rioting, is
 expected to see Macleod this
 month.   If Kaunda does not ob-
 tain support for his nationalist
 stand, he will probably be forced
 by extremists among the leader-  25X1
 ship of the UNIP to instigate
 further disturbances in Northern
 Rhodesia.
 Although much maneuvering
 is taking place and negotia-
 tions are going on between vari-
 ous interested politicians to-
 ward the formation of alliances,
 there is still no clear picture
 of election lists.   A neutral
 caretaker cabinet headed by
 Ahmad Dauq, former ambassador
 in Paris and a Sunni Moslem,
 has assumed office and will
 carry out the elections begin-
 ning 12 June.   It is planned
 that his cabinet will resign
 shortly after 3 July when the
 elections are complete.
 appear to be still siding with
 President Shihab, who is en-
 deavoring to keep Jumayyil from
 joining forces with Chamoun.
 Frictions in the non-Mos-
 lem community are continuing. A
 cleavage in the Phalange is said
 to be developing between a group
 led by Jumayyil and others who
 desire a moderate attitude to-
 ward the 1 May killing of
 Christians, and a group whose
 leaders are pressing for co-
 operation with Chamoun.   The
 Greek Orthodox minority is also
 split between pro- and anti-
 Chamoun factions.
 The reconciliation between
 former President Chamoun and
 Maronite Patriarch Maushi has
 stiffened the morale of candi-
 dates not supported by the UAR
 and improved the chances for
 collaboration among them. Pierre
 Jumayyil and his Phalange party
 Lebanese Moslems are also
 split.    Sunni Moslem politicians
 are competing for UAR support
 and are unable to agree on elec-
 tion slates.   Some incidents
 of  violence    have  occurred
 between   various     factions.

 Communist Party of India  (CPI)
 meanwhile is to be guided by the
 moderate "Amritsar thesis" a-
 dopted at the last congress in
 1958;  this emphasized a peace-
 ful,  parliamentary approach to
 gain power.
 Chronic factionalism among
 CPI leaders was greatly accentu-
 ated as a result of the damaging
 effects on the party of the
 Sino-Indian border dispute and
 the Communist electoral defeat
 in Kerala'State.   Several meet-
 ings of the party secretariat
 and central executive committee
 during the past few months have
 ended in a deadlock between the
 "moderates" and the hard-line
 extremists.
 The policy dispute now
 seems to be centered on the de-
 gree of cooperation which the
 party should extend to Prime
 Minister Nehru personally and
 to his more "progressive" poli-
 cies.   The extremists have ar-
 gued for some time that Nehru
 has surrendered to "reactionary"
 Congress party leaders; they
 point to his acceptance of 'large
 scale Western economic aid and
 his firm stand during Chou En-
 lai's recent visit as proof.
 The moderate faction con-
 tends that Nehru should be "res-
 cued" and that certain govern-
 ment economic policies must
 be supported.    On  the  Sino-
 Indian  border                                                                     issue,  which
 nearly   precipitated a breakup
 of  the  CPI   last fall,      the
 party  outwardly  has       closed
 ranks.   Sharp  differences re-
 main, however,                                                                    between the
 "nationalist" moderates and
 the "internationalist" radicals
 on the question of relations
 with Peiping.
 Ideological  confusion a-
 mong the Indian                                                               Communists
 has been compounded by recent
 indications of similar differ-
 ences over  theory                                                                between
 Peiping and Moscow.   Extremist
 leaders  have seized on the
 Chinese party's articles in
 Red Flag to bQlster   their ar-
 guments  in favor of a  harder
 line.   The moderate  faction
 has drawn on Moscow's support
 and has patterned its tactics
 on Khrushchev's policy of eas-
 ing cold-war tensions.  While
 the moderate leadership so far
 has  retained  control,   advo-
 cates  of more  aggressive
 tactics have gained some ground
 recently.   Should Moscow,   in
 the wake of  developments at
 the  summit conference,   revert   25X1
 to  a hard   line,   the posi-

 POLITICAL MANEUVERING FOR NEW GOVERNMENT IN LAOS
 The militantly anti-Commu-

 National Interests (CDNI) ap-
 pears to have gained a decided
 edge in the maneuvering for a
 dominant voice in the formation
 of a new Laotian government.
 The CDNI has formed a new polit-
 ical party, the Social  Demo-
 cratic party (SDP),  based prima-
 rily on the National Assembly
 deputies who ran under CDNI auspices
 in the 24 April elections.   The
 new party has apparently also
 attracted a few defectors from
 former Premier Phoui's Rally of
 the Lao People  (RLP),  the other
 major non-Communist political
 grouping in Laos.   Reports vary as
 to the SDP's potential parliamen-
 tary strength, but it probably now
 controls from 30 to 40 of the 59
 deputies in the new assembly.
 The King will in all like-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 May 1960
 The SDP may attempt to form a
 government without the partici-
 pation of the two remaining ma-
 jor factions of the RLP,  head-
 ed respectively by Phoui and
 Souvanna Phouma, another former
 premier who was the architect
 of the 1957 integration agree-
 ment between the royal govern-
 ment and the Pathet Lao.
 The RLP seems in imminent
 danger of dissolution, with Sou-
 vanna Phouma hinting strongly
 that he would like to form his
 own party.   Both Phoui and Sou-
 vanna probably still cherish the
 hope that international pressures
 on the King will assure their
 inclusion in the new government,
 and they can be expected to do
 what they can in the assembly
 to prevent the early installa-
 tion of a largely CDNI govern-
 ment.
 Which of the SDP leaders
 the King will designate to form
 a cabinet is still in doubt. The
 party membership reportedly pro-
 fesses a strong preference for
 Gen. Phoumi, the CDNI strong man
 and defense minister in the pres-
 ent. caretaker government.
 Phoumi, however, perhaps unde-
 servedly,  has come to symbolize
 anti-Communist extremism in Laos.
 Even if he divests himself of
 his military associations by re-
 signing his commission, his in-
 stallation as premier would prob-
 ably be the single development
 most likely to trigger a revival
 of Pathet Lao insurgency.  .
 :recent elections dictates a return
 to widespread open hostilities,
 A number of centers designed to
 indoctrinate cadres and train
 them in guerrilla tactics report-
 edly are in operation in North
 Vietnam.
 A significant step-up of dis-
 sidence, however, would require
 'the prior approval of Peiping and
 Hanoi, and there is no indication
 that these regimes wish to pro-
 voke a Laotian crisis at present.
 The joint communique issued
 by Chou En-laiand Premier Pham
 Van Dong on 14 May at the end of
 Chou's visit suggests that the
 Communists do not intend to launch
 a major propaganda campaign a-
 gainst Laos,  at least until a
 new government is formed in Vien-
 tiane and there is some clear in-
 dication that it will pursue a
 strongly pro-Western course simi-
 lar to that of its predecessor.
 The communique largely re-
 iterated standard Communist de-
 mands, and made no mention of
 the recent election irregular-
 ities which virtually eliminated
 Communist representation in the
 Laotian National Assembly. Al-
 though Chou and Pham Van Dong
 termed the present situation in
 Laos "dangerous," they indicated
 that it could be restored to
 normal by "peaceful consulta-
 tion" between the,parties con-
 cerned'--presumably including
 Communist China and North Viet-
 nam, who were signatories to
 the Geneva agreements of 1954.
 Phoumi would probably be
 content with the deputy premier-
 ship or the defense portfolio,
 with someone like Tiao Somsanith,
 the present interior minister,
 fronting for him as premier.
 3omsanith's selection as the
 SDP's parliamentary leader sug-
 gests he may well be designated
 'to make the first attempt to
 form a government.
 The Pathet Lao, probably
 have increased  -its.  capability
 to wage large-scale dissidence
 in Laos and may feel that its
 loss of legal strength in the
 Peiping and Hanoi also
 called for the reactivation of
 the International Control Com-
 mission created in the Geneva
 agreements and for the implemen-
 tation of a policy of strict
 neutrality in Laos.   The Commu-
 nists believe such a policy would
 provide the best environment for
 the Neo Lao Hak Sat,  the Pathet
 Lao's political front, to strengthen
 its position as a legal party     25X1
 while continuing to benefit from
 low-level dissident activity.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMM&RY
 19 May 1960
 PRO-COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SINGAPORE LABOR AND STUDENT CIRCLES
 Pro-Communists in Singa-
 pore appear to be making steady
 progress in their program of
 consolidating their strength,
 especially in labor unions and
 Chinese schools, although for
 the time being they are avoid-
 ing an open showdown with the
 government.
 Increasing pro-Communist
 influence was also reflected
 in the appointment to the STUC
 secretariat of six prominent
 extremists who had served jail
 terms for subversive activities
 under the previous Singapore
 government.   Prime Minister
 Lee Kuan Yew justifies the ap-
 pointments as a means of iden-
 tifying the extremists with
 the government's labor policy
 of "industrial peace with
 justice" and places the moder-
 ate leaders of the ruling Peo-
 ple's Action party (PAP) in a
 better position to control ex-
 tremist activities.
 Although the top STUC of-
 fices remain in moderate hands,
 the US Consulate General fears
 that the organization's Indian,
 Malay, and moderate Chinese lead-
 ers will be no competition for
 the extremist Chinese in Singa-
 pore's predominantly Chinese
 labor movement.   It believes the
 entire labor movement may fall
 into the hands of extremists
 sooner than previously feared.
 The PAP government is also
 disturbed over the amount of Com-
 munist influence in Nanyang Uni-
 versity--a privately operated
 all-Chinese institution in Singa-
 pore--as well as in numerous
 Chinese middle schools. The gov-
 ernment is engaged in moves de-
 signed to gain administrative
 control over the university and
 to make it into a "national,"
 rather than a purely Chinese,
 institution. This is an extreme-
 ly touchy maneuver because of
 Communist influence among, and
 the strong chauvinistic feelings
 of, many Nanyang University stu-
 dents and key financial supporters.
 Indonesian domestic and
 diplomatic activity now is con-
 cerned mainly with Dutch plans
 to augment land and air forces
 in Netherlands New Guinea (West
 Irian) and to send naval units
 on a flag-showing cruise to the
 Far East.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 May 1960
 against Dutch plans, the Indo-
 nesian Communist party has at-
 tempted to seize the initiative.
 Despite an army ban, student
 anti-Dutch demonstrations--
 clearly coordinated by the Com-
 munists--occurred in four major
 cities in Java in mid-Allay,
 and earlier in the month stu-
 dents attacked and damaged the
 Dutch chancery in Djakarta.
 The Communist platform which
 emerged during the demonstra-
 tions called for severance of
 relations with the Dutch, sei-
 zure of remaining Dutch assets
 in Indonesia, submission of the
 dispute to the United Nations,
 and all-out support of Presi-
 dent Sukarno.
 Caught off guard, civilian
 government officials took no
 action against the demonstra-
 tions, apparently being reluc-
 tant to crack down on activi-
 ties which ostensibly reflected
 genuine national apprehension.
 Immediately following the demon-
 strations, however, the govern-
 ment announced that action would
 be taken against assemblies
 which violate regulations, and
 in East Java the army commander
 specifically banned demonstra-
 tions on West Irian.
 The army has reiterated
 that all anti-Dutch activities
 must be channeled through the
 army-controlled West Irian
 Liberation Front.   Both civilian
 and army officials appear to
 be awaiting President Sukarno's
 return in early June from a
 global tour, presuming that he
 will chart the course of Indo-
 nesia's reaction to Dutch moves.
 The Indonesian Navy, in a
 show of force, is conducting      25X1
 in waters adjacent to West Irian.
 The Foreign Ministry con-
 tinues its approaches to Afro-
 Asian governments for coopera-
 tion in obstructing Dutch moves.
 The ambassadors of the UAR,
 Pakistan, and Iraq have made
 public statements in Djakarta
 denouncing Dutch actions.
 The West Irian issue in-
 creasingly diverts public atten-
 tion from the anti-Communist,
 anti-Sukarno campaign of the Demo-
 cratic League. The Communists
 are using the issue against the
 league, identifying both the
 Dutch and the league as opposed
 to President Sukarno. The party
 is also eager to use West Irian
 to divert attention from the
 Overseas Chinese issue. Although
 official attention will be tempo-
 rarily deflected from West Irian
 to renewed friction over Chinese
 problems, the general public is
 likely to remain preoccupied with
 anti-Dutch issues.
 SINO-INDONESIAN DISPUTE SHARPENS
 Peiping's determination to
 champion the "rights and inter-
 ests" of Overseas Chinese in
 Indonesia has led to new fric-
 tions in Sino-Indonesian rela-
 tions and precludes an early
 settlement of the dispute be-
 tween the two countries.

 istry official termed "improper
 diplomatic practice" the Chi-
 nese Communists' publication of
 their protest without waiting
 for an Indonesian reply, and he
 explained that the Chinese con-
 sul's abusive manner forced
 army authorities to confine him.
 Djakarta has asked for the with-
 drawal of this and another con-
 sul for interference in the
 repatriation program.
 Peiping's decision to issue
 the protest is the culmination
 of a series of behind-the-scenes
 recriminations between China and
 Indonesia.   On 10 April the In-
 donesian charge in Peiping
 walked out of the National Peo-
 ple's Congress during a speech
 by Fang Fang, deputy chairman
 of the Overseas Chinese Affairs
 Commission, in which Fang had
 accused the Djakarta regime of
 showing a "comprador mentality"
 and said it was in danger of be-
 coming a military dictatorship.
 Relations have also been
 exacerbated by Indonesia's mis-
 handling of the departure from
 Sumatra of  .a  Chinese ship car-
 rying repatriates.
 Ambassador Huang Chen ob-
 viously has made little progress
 in the joint Sino-Indonesian
 committee which was set up osten-
 sibly to handle problems arising
 from implementation of the dual
 nationality treaty but actually
 has been used as a channel to
 convey Peiping's "demands" on
 Djakarta concerning persecution
 of Overseas Chinese.   The Chi-
 nese can be expected to use
 various methods of maintaining
 their pressure, including petty
 harassment of the Indonesian
 Embassy in Peiping
 Communist China, which pro-
 duced only 2,850,000 tons of
 steel in 1955, expects to turn
 out more than 18,000,000 tons
 this year.     No long-range goals
 for 1965 have been announced,
 but China may well be producing
 at a rate in excess of 35,000,-
 000 tons annually by that time,
 making it the third of fourth
 largest producer of steel in
 the world.   To reach this level,
 the Chinese would have to add
 little more in the way of steel-
 making capacity during the next
 five years than was installed
 over the past five--3,400,000
 tons a year as against 3,100,000.
 Additions to capacity at this rate
 should prove feasible for Peiping.
 In pursuit of these large
 increases,  the regime is depending

 will be able to turn out up-to-
 date,  highly productive compo-
 nents for China's iron  and
 steel plants--should be com-
 pleted by 1962.
 At 35, 000, 000 tons, China's
 steel output in 1965 will top
 the 29,400,000 tons produced
 in 1959 by West Germany--the
 world's third largest producer
 last year.   Even at this rate,
 however, China's steel produc-
 tion will be far from adequate
 --in terms of quantity, quality,
 and variety--for all the require-
 ments of its burgeoning industry.
 China's rapid industrialization
 drive
 is already beginning
 to
 place
 demands on the steel
 in-
 dustry
 to produce not just
 more
 steel
 but a  wider  variety
 of
 quality products.
 The scope of these demands
 will almost certainly broaden
 as the technological complexity
 of China's industry grows.   In
 the past the regime has concen-
 trated on producing a limited
 range of products featuring
 crude steel of simple specifica-
 tions.   Finishing capacity has
 lagged behind, and, in 1959,an
 estimated 2,000,000 tons of
 crude steel had either to be
 stockpiled, remelted, or assigned
 to primitive handicraft use.
 These  aspects  of  the  indus-
 try  will have                                                             to  be given
 more attention in the future,
 even at the cost of a lowering
 in the rate of growth in crude
 steel output, if Peiping's in-
 dustrial  and  military  econo-
 is to mature.
 COMMONWEALTH
 MEETING HIGHLIGHTS
 Despite the much-publicized
 dissension over South Africa's
 racial policies,  the two-week
 meeting of Commonwealth prime
 ministers which concluded on
 13 May found an unusually high
 degree of agreement on general
 international developments.
 The   Indian   prime minis-
 ter's preoccupation  with  prob-
 lems            posed by Communist China
 marked the principal change from
 previous years.   Even  though
 Nehru saw Peiping as unlikely
 to embark on any substantial
 aggressive moves soon,  he was
 greatly worried about   future
 relations and seemed to regard
 Communist China as "bursting at
 the seams."
 Nehru still advocated ad-
 mitting the Peiping regime to the
 United Nations,  but he thought
 perhaps the Chinese Communists
 preferred to remain outside in
 order to have an issue to complain
 about.   In contrast to former
 conferences, Nehru and others re-
 frained from objecting to defense
 pacts   and
 was general support for the West's 25X1
 approach to dealings with Khru -
 shchev in the pre-summit period.
 A cordiality seemed to have
 developed between Nehru and Paki-
 stani President Ayub during the
 meetings.   Ayub is said'to have
 refrained from making an issue of
 Kashmir, and
 he may have decided to   25X1

 accept that situation as it is.
 Although the Indus waters agree-
 ment was not ready for signing
 during the conference,       Nehru
 agreed to go to Rawalpindi to
 sign it.
 Nehru and Ayub found them-
 selves in accord in appraising
 Indonesian domestic instability,
 and neither saw anything that
 could be done.   In an effort to
 strengthen British ties with
 Pakistan, Macmillan acceded to
 Ayub's pressure to reiterate
 British recognition of the
 Durand line as Pakistan's border
 with Afghanistan.
 Anger at South Africa's
 racial policies was aggravated
 by the undiplomatic behavior of
 Pretoria's representative,
 External Affairs Minister Louw.
 The bitter aftertaste of the
 "informal" debates will prob-
 ably increase the inclination
 of the Malayans or others to
 ease South Africa out of the
 Commonwealth  when South Africa
 makes its formal appeal to con-
 tinue its membership as a
 republic following the ref-
 erendum which is to be held
 in the Union on this subject.
 COMMON MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
 The decision of the council
 of the European Economic Commu-
 nity (EEC) on 12 May concerning
 the "rate of realization of
 treaty objectives" is the most
 important EEC development of the
 past two years.   The EEC is
 already ahead of schedule in
 several respects,  and its inter-
 nal development and consolidation
 are now likely to be further
 advanced.   By reaffirming the
 intention of the six member
 countries to proceed with the
 establishment of a full economic
 union,  the council has appar-
 ently given the rest of Western
 Europe little choice but to come
 to terms with it.
 The council's decisions
 are generally in keeping.with
 the acceleration plan advanced
 by President Hallstein last
 March.   Tariffs among the EEC
 members, which would have been
 reduced another 10 percent on
 1 July, will be reduced instead
 20 percent.   This will mean
 a 30-percent reduction in in-
 ternal tariffs in just 18
 months,  and unless there are
 unfavorable developments in
 the business cycle, the 10-
 percent reduction scheduled for
 December 1961 may also be
 doubled,   A new timetable has
 been drawn up for the institution
 of a common agricultural policy,
 and the members have declared
 their willingness to proceed as
 "rapidly as possible" to im-
 plement other community policies.
 On the crucial problem of
 the EEC's common external tariff,
 the council also accepted the
 substance of Hallstein's pro-
 posals but not the timing.   The
 rates eventually applicable to
 imports from nonmembers will be
 "provisionally" reduced by 20
 percent, and the initial step
 toward putting them into effect
 will be taken "no later" than
 31 December,   This is six months
 later than Hallstein had proposed
 but a year ahead of the schedule
 set forth in the EEC treaty.
 Although interpreted as a concili-
 atory gesture toward the European
 Free Trade Association (EFTA
 or Outer Seven),  the delay is
 due in part to a need for par-
 liamentary action in some of
 the EEC countries.

 take comfort either from this
 delay-    or _-the. icouftcil's
 "declaration of intent" to
 negotiate actively to maintain
 "traditional trade ties, "pprtiew

 that "GATT principles" must be
 observed, and specifically re-
 calls the EEC offer of late 1959
 to establish a "contact commit-

 These provisos suggest that
 the EEC has no new approach in
 mind--that it is willing to

 FRENCH COMMUNISTS WINNING ELECTORAL SUPPORT
 In a number of French local
 elections since the  January
 rightist revolt in Algeria,non-
 Communist leftist, candidates
 have demonstrated increased uni-
 ty and have formed some success-
 ful tactical alliances with the
 French Communist :party. (PCF) .' Inflii
 ential Le Monde editor Jacques
 Fauvet publicly recommended on
 7 May that the left ally itself
 with the Communists to halt the
 "disappearance" of French de-
 mocracy.
 The Communist candidate in
 a February cantonal by-election
 to replace a Radical in Calvados
 Department won a surprise vic-
 tory over the Independent party
 candidate, with the Communist
 vote increasing 1,000 votes over
 its 1955 total.   The PCF with-
 drawal in the March municipal
 elections at Quimper, Finistere
 Department,  gave:the Socialist-
 Radical list a surprise victory
 over the favored Gaullist - Popu-
 lar Republican list.   Opposi-
 tion to the government's policy
 of expanded aid to church schools
 was a major factor in the Quinper
 upset and also in a cantonal elec-
 tion in April at Dormans, Marne
 Department, where a Socialist
 candidate who won 352 votes on
 the first round withdrew and the
 Communist candidate picked up
 351 votes in the runoff.
 The strategic position of
 the newly formed Unified Social-
 ist party (PSU) is apparent in
 this context,   The PSU, which
 counts former Premier Mendes-
 France in its :ranks,,  was con-
 stituted to provide a non-Commu-
 nist opposition to De Gaulle,
 One component of the party,  how-
 ever, has long been committed
 to cooperation with the Commu-
 nists,  and another is composed
 of former PCF members.
 PSU successes in several al-
 liances with the Communists may
 give increasing pause to the
 French Socialist party, which
 has rejected a popular front.
 Shortly before the PSU was formed,
 its Mendes-France group won a
 cantonal by-election in the Seine-
 Maritime Department over the
 Gaullist  candidate when the

 by a Gaullist, and at Castenet,

 between non-,Communists and Com-

 Isolated instances of local
 alliances with the PCF occurred
 in the Fourth Republic. While al-

 year suggest that the new will-

 ed left-wing splinter groups to
 cooperate among themselves will
 increasingly lead to what Fauvet

 Communists, as a logical reac-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 May 1960
 The defeat of the moderate
 Social Democrats in the 14 May
 meeting of the executive coun-
 cil of the Confederation of
 Labor (SAK) and the resignation
 of Chairman Heinonen are ex-
 pected to split Finland's larg-
 est trade union organization
 into two rival groups.   Some
 unions in that event will grav-
 itate  to the moderate Joint
 Organization of Trade Unions
 (AYJ), leaving the remainder
 of SAK dominated by the Commu-
 nists and left-wing Socialists.
 The trade union split has
 been shat*ing  up even since Vice
 Chairman Vihtori  Rantanen
 failed to win the SAK chairman-
 ship in 1959 and began building
 up a working coalition of radi-
 cal Social Democrats and Com-
 munists.   In an effort to coun-
 ter Rantanen's strategy, Hei-
 nonen had sought the admission
 of four additional right-wing
 unions and declared he would
 resign if the vote was unfa-
 vorable.
 At the 14 May meeting,
 Rantanen countered by seeking
 the admission also of two left-
 wing unions, and Heinonen was
 defeated 48 to 43.   Heinonen
 has resigned effective 18 June.
 Rantanen is expected to take
 over as acting chairman until
 the SAK congress in early 1961,
 when his formal election as
 chairman is likely.
 While the withdrawal of
 the moderate unions may be
 gradual and will be complicated
 by internecine struggles in the
 local unions,  Finland may soon
 have two strong trade union or-
 ganizations.                           At present, AYJ
 has about 26,000 members. SAK
 has about 240,000, of whom an
 estimated 100,000 are pro-Com-
 munist; there are also some in-
 dependent Communist unions, and
 they would probably join the
 rump SAK.  AYJ may benefit
 from the inclination of employ-
 ers to deal with moderate So-
 cial Democrats and thus ultimate-
 ly win the affiliation of some
 former left-wing Social Demo-
 cratic workers.
 The factional struggle
 within the trade union movement
 will also aggravate the Social
 Democratic party's split, recent-
 ly confirmed by the re-election
 of right-wing Chairman Vaino
 Tanner, between the regulars
 and the Opposition Social Demo-
 crats.   The continued division
 of the Social Democrats pre-
 cludes any reconciliation with
 the Agrarian party and conse-
 quently the formation of a
 strong majority government sim-
 ilar to those formed in the
 postwar period by these two
 groups.  The minority Agrarian
 cabinet in turn will become in-
 creasingly dependent on the
 parliamentary support of the
 Communist-front Finnish People's
 Democratic League

 PANAMANIAN ELECTION AFTERMATH
 The De la Guardia govern-

 the 8 May presidential and leg-
 islative election in Panama.
 Opposition presidential candi-
 date Roberto Chiari is widely
 believed to have defeated Ri-
 cardo Arias, the government-
 backed pre-election favorite,
 and both Arias and Victor Goy-
 tia--who apparently finished
 third in the race--have charged
 that improper procedures were
 permitted during the balloting.
 An official tabulation of re-
 turns begun on 14 May will re-

 Political tension has sub-
 sided since election day.
 Chiari is a member of Pana-
 ma's wealthy ruling clique and
 a former vice president who
 served briefly as president in
 1949 before being ousted in a
 coup.   He was supported for the
 presidency in the recent elec-
 tions by the National Opposition
 Union (UNO), one of two four-
 party alliances aligned against
 the government's National Pa-
 triotic Coalition party.   His
 platform included the pledge to
 bring the National Guard, Pana-
 ma's only military force, under
 civilian control.
 Although Chiari joined all
 other candidates during the pre-
 election campaign in vowing to
 continue the nationalistic canal
 policies of the present govern-
 ment,
 if Chiari became
 president, the period of "name-
 calling" and exacerbation of US-
 Panamanian difficulties should
 be over.
 the Chiar  government would seek
 an early increase in the annual
 canal payment to Panama and
 would  press  for  the  right
 to  fly  the  Panamanian  flag
 in  the  Canal  Zone.

 PART III
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 VLADIMIR DUDINTSEV'S A NEW YEAR'S TALE
 The publication by the
 Soviet literary journal Novy
 Mir of Vladimir Dudintsev's-
 Taoest work, A New Year's Tale,
 is one more sfep Tn     stub- -
 born efforts of Soviet writers
 to push back the boundaries
 prescribed by the regime's cul-
 tural policy.   As such, it a-
 gain demonstrates the regime's
 dilemma in attempting to con-
 trol and use the restive in-
 telligentsia without sacrific-
 ing the limited relaxation of
 tension.
 Both Dudintsev and Novy
 Mir are old offenders against
 le party's literary canons.
 Dudintsev's stubborn defense
 of his first novel, Not By
 Bread Alone, ended in Tis par-
 ticipation in "the feat of si-
 lence" in the spring of 1957,
 when 12 rebellious writers re-
 fused to recant in the face of
 massive official criticism.
 Since the beginning of the post-
 Stalin literary "thaw," Novy
 Mir has been a leader in puu-
 Ishing unorthodox works, de-
 spite disciplinary replace-
 ments on its editorial board.
 Both in content and in
 form,   A  New  Year's  Tale
 represents a sharp break with
 the approved "socialist real-
 ism," the task of which is to
 inspire enthusiasm in the broad-
 est possible audience for the
 regime's economic and political
 programs.   The scene is laid
 "in a city created by my imagi-
 nation," writes the author;
 nevertheless, "it is possible
 to set our watches according to
 Moscow time," and Dudintsev
 hopes that "perhaps there is
 some curious person who will
 find places in my fable that
 interest his own sober routine
 life."
 The plot deals with a
 scientist working in a research
 institute and concerned only
 for his academic prestige and
 material comfort until a colleague
 convinces him that love is more
 precious than prestige and physi-
 cal well-being.   Simultaneously,
 he is shocked into a recognition
 of the value of time by the dis-
 covery that he has only a year
 to live.   He decides to devote
 that year to earning his fellow
 man's gratitude by bringing light
 to the people of the dark land
 on the other side of Dudintsev's
 fantasy world.   In the pursuit
 of this goal, he also earns
 friendship and a woman's love,
 and in bringing light also cures
 his own illness.
 Unorthodoxy in Content
 The most startling of the
 passages which the author warns
 may "interest" the reader's real
 life are narrated by a second-
 ary character in a flashback
 which lays the scene for the
 story itself:
 "Some years ago, not far,
 far away but in our own city,
 the following thing happened.

 ture, in one of its shadiest

 secluded spots, sixty or maybe
 a hundred well-dressed men
 gathered for a discussion which
 they had decided to conduct in
 the open air.   Later it became
 known that in our park there
 had taken place, one might say,
 a two-hour symposium of bandits
 and thieves who belonged, as
 they say,  'to the law'  (appar-
 ently intended to imply a soci-
 ety or brotherhood).
 "Among those;  in that au-
 dience, there are strict regu-
 lations; the breaking of these
 regulations means a death pen-
 alty.   Those who are accepted
 into the 'law' must be recom-
 mended by several sponsors. A
 motto is engraved in India ink
 on the chest of a new member
 of the society; several words
 by which it is possible to rec-
 ognize immediately that he is
 their man....The congress of
 'bandits - law experts' passed
 six death sentences, five of
 which were carried out....(The
 sixth man) was the leader, the
 president, or as they say, the
 'pakhan'  of the whole society
 of 'law experts,'?the oldest
 and cleverest of all the ban-
 dits."
 In Dudintsev's world, there
 ire only three groups of people
 --the bandits, the scientists,
 and the nameless, faceless masses
 who work, mine coal, and grow
 cabbages on the other side of
 the planet.   The bandits and
 scientists  coexist in self-
 contained groups whose paths
 never cross, but who share the
 sunlight of their side of the
 planet.  The masses, however,
 live in darkness on a distant
 "continent."  The Russians,  in
 fact, traditionally refer to
 themselves as the "dark" people,
 and coal and cabbages are often
 cited as typical Russian prod-
 ucts.
 The bandits value material
 possessions. Their "pakhan,"
 however, had suffered a change
 of heart and desired only to
 win friendship and real love.
 He had resigned from the so-
 ciety, explaining his position
 in a long letter which was
 printed in a special leaflet
 "because it was a document of
 great importance and it was
 quite necessary to make use of
 it."
 Dudintsev emphasizes his
 use of the word "law," for
 which there appears to be no
 idiomatic justification, by
 enclosing it in quotation marks.
 Its sole function in the plot
 is to identify the bandit so-
 ciety.   The related word "za-
 konniki" which he applies to the
 "bandits - law.ex5erts" usually
 applies to those who study the
 letter of the law in minute de-
 tail.   Dogmatism and authoritari-
 anism in the USSR are usually
 justified on the basis of the
 Communist party's alleged posi-
 tion as the unique repository
 and infallible interpreter of
 the "law" of historical devel-
 opment.
 Candidates for party mem-
 bership must be vouched for by
 three sponsors, and members re-
 ceive a party identification
 card.  There have been ample
 instances of dogmatic  party:
 elements  passing  sentence
 on erring members.   It must be
 noted, however, that the anal-
 ogy is incomplete, since there
 are also unidentified ?'prison
 authorities" who arrest and im-
 prison the chief bandit.
 A further parallel can be
 drawn between the renegade ban-
 dit's letter of resignation,
 printed in a special leaflet,
 and Khrushchev's ?secret speech"
 which was widely disseminated in
 party circles in pamphlet form.
 The ex post facto  discovery
 that the "congress" of well-
 dressed men was in reality a
 meeting of bandits and thieves

 recalls the revelations of this
 speech.     This analogy is also
 incomplete, however.   The re-
 formed bandit is soon murdered
 by his ex-followers, and it is
 the hero who brings light to
 masses laboring in darkness.  It
 seems probable that Dudintsev
 was deliberately ambiguous on
 these as on many other points.
 One of the more serious
 criticisms leveled against Not
 B Bread Alone was the charge
 that the hero had not turned to
 the party for help.   Dudintsev
 may have compounded his earlier
 "error" here.   Not only are the
 "law experts" revealed as greedy
 and materialistic bandits and
 thieves,  but there is also a
 veiled implication that they
 are alien to the life around
 them.   The title which they
 gave their leader--"pakhan"--
 is not a Russian but a Tadzhik
 word,   And far from being a
 possible source of help, the
 bandits murder the only man
 who understands the hero's prob-
 lem.
 Another possible reflection
 of the party is found in the
 character of the. "cadre direc-
 tor" who works with the scien-
 tists.  He and his wife flaunt
 rich clothes; in contrast to the
 two heroes, who find happiness
 in working for others, he re-
 gards these as mutually exclu-
 sive goals, and he is unable to
 imagine any standard of values
 other than material possessions.
 His angry query--"If time is
 nothing but a tiny particle, do
 we have no heroic past?  Do we
 have no great solar future?"--
 remains unanswered.   It is also
 the cadre    director who in-
 sists that the reformed bandit
 should be reported to the au-
 thorities as an escaped criminal.
 A similar argument,  centering
 around a story published in the
 Leningrad literary journal Neva,
 shook Soviet literary circles
 last fall.
 Criticism of Soviet Society
 Dudintsev refers to the
 area in which the dark masses
 live as "'materik,'" not "konti-
 nent."   Both words mean conti-
 nent,  but "materik" has a sec-
 ond meaning of "subsoil,"  Some
 Western critics have considered
 and rejected the idea that these
 masses might be laboring in the
 "darkness of capitalism." It is
 also possible to interpret the
 three groups as a savage com-
 mentary on the gulf between the
 dogmatic authority of the party,
 the intelligentsia, and the
 workers in the USSR.
 The hero's personal philoso-
 phy also implies criticism of
 aspects of life in the USSR.
 "The most precious thoughts are
 not those squeezed out labori-
 ously at a desk, but those which
 come to us like a whiff of wind.'"
 Books are available "even if they
 were locked up in the state safe
 behind seven seals."   "The wor-
 ship of material things must un-
 mistakably give way to the beauty
 of man's soul, which cannot be
 bought or stolen.   We cannot
 force anyone to love us by threat-
 ening him with weapons."
 There are hints of rebirth
 and reincarnation, and an in-
 sistence on the link between the
 present and antiquity in the re-
 curring theme of a lotus blos-
 som grown from a seed which "had
 lain for 2,000 years in a stone
 tomb."  A second recurring theme--
 an owl, which appears to repre-
 sent a reminder of the finite-
 ness of the individual's life
 span and hence of the need for
 individual integrity--"looks as
 if it had been hewn by a paleo-
 lithic man."   It too is asso-
 ciated with antiquity, having
 been drawn and carved by unknown
 races in many lands.
 Nowhere in the story is
 there any trace of the "new
 element".. Which, according to

 Communist orthodoxy, was inter-
 jected into the historical proo-
 ess,-. in 1917, and which the 7.4
 regime has always insisted must
 be reflected in literature.
 Unorthodoxy In Form
 The heavy use of symbolism
 is itself a break with official
 esthetic standards.   According
 to a recent pronouncement of
 the Soviet Academy of Arts,
 revisionism--one facet of which
 is experimentation with form
 and style--is introducing chaos
 into Marxist-Leninist esthetics.
 Leninist principles demand that
 art "serve not the selected
 few, not the upper 10,000, but
 millions."  Symbolism is not
 only suspect as a possible
 attempt to bypass the censor,
 but it is also unintelligible
 to these "millions."
 Dudintsev's symbolism is
 both a protection and a hand-
 icap.   Its ambiguities make it
 difficult for his critics to
 pin down any more grievous
 error than lack of socialist
 form, but it also limits his
 audience.   The authorities'
 recognition of this latter
 factor probably explains the
 paucity of Soviet critical
 comment thus far.
 The newspaper of the USSR
 Writers' Union, Literary Ga-
 zette, praised tiie au h'or~s
 idea of bringing happiness to
 others but deplored the am-
 biguities which aroused "per-
 plexing questions" in the
 reader's mind.   A Moscow youth
 paper noted that the "transpar-
 ent" story contained "serious
 ideological errors" and was
 written from "exactly the same
 ideological position" for
 which Dudintsev had previously
 been "justly" criticized.
 If the regime's reaction
 has not been sufficiently
 strong either to risk focusing
 public attention on an unortho-
 dox, work or to undermine  the
 carefully cultivated relaxation
 of tension, neither will it be
 sufficient to deter other writ-
 ers and journals from following
 the example set by A New Year's
 Tale in questioning esiab  she
 values.   It is this problem
 which the regime has not yet
 solved and which it will contin-
 ue to face.  A Polish newpaper
 reprinted. the story immediately,
 without comment.   A Hungarian
 journal has just published it
 with a faintly defensive note
 to the effect that the author
 had been misinterpreted in the
 West.   Other writers and artists
 both in the USSR and in the
 bloc may be encouraged to fur-
 ther unorthodox works, each       25X1
 time confronting the authorities
 with the problem of discipline
 versus relaxation.
 PORTUGAL AND ITS AFRICAN POSSESSIONS
 Portugal is increasingly
 disturbed over the impact of
 Africa's political evolution on
 its own African possessions,
 thich are the last substantial
 part of the continent under
 unmodified colonial rule.   The
 territories are of considerable
 economic importance to Lisbon,
 which seems determined to main-

 Portuguese' Colonial Theory
 The Portuguese are con-
 vinced that their long colonial
 experience has given them great-
 er understanding than other
 powers on how to deal with the
 Africans.   In general Portugal
 wants evolution "without panic
 and excessive haste,"
 The African territories
 are all regarded legally as
 overseas provinces of metropol-
 itan Portugal.    Portuguese
 Africans who meet certain edu-
 cational requirements are re-
 garded as "assimilated" members
 of European society; those with-
 out assimilated status are ruled
 in a strict paternalistic manner,
 The Portuguese believe this
 system will eventually lead to
 a society in which whites and
 blacks cooperate with little or
 no racial antagonism.
 In practice, however, the
 assimilation policy has made
 little progress.   Efforts to
 provide educational and other
 welfare facilities--such as
 Belgium provided for Africans
 in the Congo--have been limited
 by Portugal's paucity of human
 and material resources. Further-
 more, even: the assimilated
 Africans are forced into menial
 jobs by the general availability
 of immigrant Portuguese labor,
 since Angola has a white minor-
 ity of some 115,000,and Mozam   '.
 bique 50,000.   As a result, po-
 litical or economic advancement
 is impossible for most of the
 10,000,000 natives in Portuguese
 Africa, and the relatively ad-
 vanced Africans are often dis-
 contented and critical of the
 regime.
 Lisbon nevertheless pro-
 fesses to see itself as defend-
 ing Western interests by hanging
 on to Angola and Mozambique at
 all costs.   Early in April the
 director of the Portuguese
 Lusitania News Agency stated
 in an address at Oxford Uni-
 versity that the Portuguese
 "intend to remain in Angola and
 Mozambique--dead or alive."
 Although drawn toward the
 Union of South Africa as a re-
 sult of their common opposition
 to African nationalism,   the
 Portuguese apparently disapprove
 of South Africa's extreme racial
 policies,

 Portugal's chief reliance
 for preventing "excessive haste"
 in Africa seems to be in firm
 police action.

 Portugal has also made an
 unofficial agreement with Bel-
 gium to take over control of.
 the mouth of the Congo River
 after 30 June, according to a
 statement made by the commander
 of the Belgian Navy  to the
 American  naval  attache in
 mid-May.
 Diplomatic Moves
 Maintenance of Portugal's
 position in Africa seems to have
 become one of the major aims of
 Portuguese diplomacy.  There is
 little doubt that Lisbon at-
 taches more importance to a
 continuation of the status quo
 in the overseas provinces than
 to NATO?
 At the United Nations, Por-
 tugal's activities center mainly
 on varied efforts to forestall
 any moves for UN intervention
 in matters relating to the ad-
 ministration of Portuguese Africa.
 This is probably a major reason
 for Portugal's present strenuous
 efforts to win "the Western Euro-
 pean seat" on the Security
 Council at the end of this year.

 subversive activity from neigh-
 boring  territories  as
 they  come  under  African con-
 trol.
 Such movements, directed
 at Portuguese Guinea and Angola,
 are now active in Guinea and
 the Belgian Congo, and similar
 organizations, aimed at the over-
 throw of Portugal's rule in Mo-
 zambique, may be set up in Nyasa-
 land and Tanganyika when Africans
 in those territories take over
 the governments.   Nationalist
 ideas may also enter Mozambique
 from South Africa, to which an
 estimated 250,000 natives
 migrate annually to work in the
 mines and elsewhere in the Union's
 industrial economy.   With ex-
 ternal pressure increasing and
 internal discontent among the
 Africans on the rise, the Por-
 tuguese security police and the
 military are likely to find
 the task  of  maintaining
 public order  increasingly
 difficult.

 national framework of the Iraqi
 state.
 Under the monarchy these
 forces were for the most part
 suppressed.   Iraq's minorities
 have bitter memories of the
 Assyrian massacres of 1933, and
 Kurdish uprisings of 19229 1927,
 1930, 1932, and 1943, as well
 as numerous tribal uprisings.
 Since the 1958 revolution, ten-
 sions between the various com-
 munities have increased with the
 continuing instability of the
 revolutionary regime.
 The Arab Moslems are basi---
 ily divided into the two anti-
 pathetic sects--Sunnis and Shias,
 each with its own shrines, lead-
 ers, and even religibus law
 courts.
 Sunni Moslems
 The Sunni Moslems are com-
 posed of Arabs, Kurds, and Tur.
 komans whose sole meeting ground
 is a common religion. The Sunni
 religious community has no
 priesthood or religious hierachy
 which might serve to unify its
 members, although there are a
 number of religious offices for
 dealing with and guiding Sunni
 spiritual life.   The Sunnis are
 "orthodox" Moslems who claim to
 stand for the original simplicity
 of Islam.   They regard the Ko-
 SECRET
 ran supplemented by the tradi-
 tions of the Prophet Mohammed
 as the sole and sufficient re-
 pository of the Moslem faith.
 The Sunni Arabs, political-
 ly dominant since the time of
 the Ottoman Empire, regard them-
 selves as superior to their
 Kurdish and Tukkoman coreligion-?-
 ists.                                                               The Arabs of the seat num-
 ber about 1,250,000 and inhabit
 the Western half of the country.
 The nomadic Arab Bedouin tribes
 are mainly Sunnis.
 Iraq's estimated 800,000
 Kurds are concentrated along the
 northeastern borders with Tur-
 key and Iran.   They speak various
 dialects of Kurdish, an Indo-
 European language distantly re-
 lated to Persian.   Dour and
 somewhat fatalistic, they are
 noted for their warlike behavior.
 and despise the Arabs.   Their
 social organization is based on
 tribe and clan, but a Kurdish
 leader in modern times--the so-
 called sheik--has been either
 a holy man or the head of a
 family renowned for its holi-
 ness, rather than a tribal chief.
 Although the Kurds are often
 stereotyped as a single cohesive
 element, tribal rivalries keep
 them in almost constant turmoil.
 The most important tribes are
 the Babans, Barzinjis, Baradostis,

 Zibaris,  and Barzanis.   The
 Zibaris and Barzanis are pres-
 ently at odds with each other,
 and the Iraqi security forces
 are attempting to umpire the
 fighting.
 It is doubtful that the
 Kurds could be unified into an
 effective force.   Dreams of a
 Kurdish state carved out of
 parts of Turkey,  Iraq,  and Iran
 nevertheless are still nurtured
 by many Kurds
 E___-F-However, Muller Mus-
 tafa, leader of the Barzanis
 who returned from refuge in
 the Soviet Union with some 800
 followers after the 1958 Iraqi
 revolution, has followed a pol-
 icy of supporting the Qasim re-
 gime.
 Qasim has sought to em-
 phasize Kurdish participation
 in the Iraqi Government and
 cultural autonomy by such ges-
 tures as the founding of
 Kurdish Academy, a medical
 school in the Kurdish center
 of Mosul, and broadcasts in
 Kurdish over Radio Baghdad.  In-
 deed, Qasim's emphasis on Arab
 unity and the brotherhood of
 Arabs and Kurds has disturbed
 many Kurdish leaders, who fear
 being engulfed in a larger
 Arab mass.
 The Turkomans, numbering
 about 100,000, are village and
 town dwellers also living in the
 northeastern part of the coun-
 try and are descendants of the
 pre-Ottoman Turkish invaders
 of Iraq.   Speaking Turki,  a
 dialect of Turkish, many Turko-
 mans have been government func-
 tionaries since Ottoman times,
 while many others are small
 shopkeepers.   During the Kirkuk
 disturbances of July 1959, many
 Turkoman shops were burned and
 their owners killed by Commu-
 nist-led mobs.   Politically
 the Turkomans look toward Tur-
 key; however,  they too have
 been the object of Qasim's so-
 licitation.
 Iraq's Shia population is
 approximately 3,800,000, out-
 numbering Sunni Arabs and Kurds
 together.   They are mostly farm-
 ers and are concentrated in
 southeastern Iraq.   The split
 between the Sunnis and Shias
 began in the first century of
 Islam; the Sunnis called for an
 elected caliph--commander of the
 faithful--while the Shias ad-
 vocated a hereditary succession
 through the Prophet Mohammed's
 son-in-law All. Shia Islam be-    25X1
 came the state religion of Persia
 in the 16th century, and Persian
 cultural influence has been
 strong among the Shias of Iraq
 ever since.
 The gulf between the Shias
 and their Sunni compatriots is
 deepened by a number of strange
 Shia practices--the passion play
 each year commemorating the death
 of All, their cult of saints,
 practice of temporary marriages,
 and the concept that some day a
 last "Hidden Imam" will reap-
 pear to rule the world and give
 his faithful adherents their
 due.
 Shia resentment of the
 Sunnis is especially strong in
 the predominantly Shia areas
 around Diwaniya and Nasiriya,
 centers of unrest during periods
 of political or economic crises.
 The influence of religious lead-
 ers among the Shias is much
 stronger than among the Sunnis.
 The mujtahids,  earthly repre-
 sentatives of the Hidden Imam,
 guide their followers in all
 aspects of life and have repre-
 sentatives throughout the Shia
 communities.   The more revered
 mujtahids reside in Karbala and
 especially Najaf; they can,
 when they wish,  exercise con-
 siderable political influence.
 It is these divines who
 have aroused the greatest re-
 sistance among the Shias to pol-
 icies of the Qasim regime which
 they considered pro-Communist.

 They have encouraged their fol-

 Najaf and Karbala is strong;
 these cities are the most im=

 sands of Iranians visit and
 study there every year.
