 Terrorism Review
 29 July 1985
 Focus                     The Impact of Middle Eastern Terrorism
 International terrorism is increasingly a problem of Middle Eastern origin. In
 1984 and the first half of 1985, Middle Eastern groups committed almost
 50 percent of all international terrorist incidents around the world. Not only has
 terrorism increased in the Middle East itself, but terrorists of Middle Eastern
 origin are also operating more frequently in other areas, particularly in Western
 Europe.
 Middle Eastern terrorism is becoming more lethal, while terrorists from other
 regions continue to target property more often than people. If present trends
 continue, 1985 will be the third year in a row in which over 50 percent of the
 casualties in international terrorist incidents will be caused by Middle Easterners.
 The majority of US casualties continue to occur in Middle Eastern incidents:
 ? Middle Eastern terrorists are the world's primary agents of armed attacks
 intended to kill specific victims.
 ? Middle Eastern terrorist bombs tend to be larger, more sophisticated, and use
 higher grade explosives.
 ? Terrorists from the Middle East are generally more professional and proficient
 in clandestine operations. Thus they are more difficult to detect and stop than
 terrorists from other parts of the world
 The Israeli-Palestinian dispute and state-sponsored terrorism involving Iran, Syria,
 and Libya are the wellsprings of our increasingly dangerous Middle Eastern
 problem:
 ? After being thrown off balance by the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982,
 Palestinian terrorism has made a comeback in the last two years. Virtually every
 Palestinian group has claimed credit for attacks on Israel, and the split between
 pro- and anti-Arafat groups in the PLO has led to increasing intra-Palestinian
 violence as well as attacks on states on both sides of the dispute. We are
 concerned that Palestinian terrorism is occurring with greater frequency in
 Western Europe.
 ? Radical Shia groups directly backed and, in some instances, controlled by Iran
 pose the greatest threat to the United States. Most anti-American attacks
 involve Iranian-backed groups such as the Hizballah in Lebanon and the Dawa
 in the Persian Gulf. These groups also target France and the interests of Iraq
 and other moderate Arab states. There are no signs that radical Shia terrorism
 will decline in the remainder of this year.

 ? Libyan-sponsored terrorism continues to be active this year. In 1984 Libyan-
 sponsored attacks focused on Libyan exiles in Western Europe and the enemies
 of Libyan expansion in Africa. In addition, several Libyan assassination plots
 ? Two Syrian-backed groups-Abu Nidal and the Jordanian People's
 Revolutionary Party-were responsible for over a dozen attacks on Jordanian
 interests in 1984 and 1985. Some of these incidents have involved US facilities in
 Jordan. In addition, the continued acquiescence of Damascus to Iranian and
 Hizballah activities in Lebanon contributes to the terrorist threat faced there.
 I
 Without the active involvement of these three states, we doubt the problem of
 Middle Eastern terrorism would have grown to the same extent. Virtually all of
 the Middle Eastern terrorist threat to US interests stems from activities backed by
 these states. The involvement of the governments in Tehran, Damascus, and
 Tripoli in recruiting, indoctrinating, training, arming, and moving terrorists from
 place to place has created an institutionalized quality in Middle Eastern terrorism
 that is largely absent in other parts of the world.

 several future targets, including Rhein Main Airbase, NATO communications
 centers, the NATO pipeline system in the Darmstadt area, pumping stations, and
 connections to the NATO central system and included a map of the Darmstadt
 area with detailed markings of NATO pipeline locations. Several specific
 installations may be at risk because they were mentioned in the letter: the
 Eberstadt, Mainhausen and Kleinsteim storage tanks, the Ginsheim central
 pumping station, Hessenane German Army Depot, and the Babenhausen US
 helicopter landing area and installations.
 Though the letter uses terminology reminiscent of previous messages identified as
 having come from the periphery of the Red Army Faction, West German
 authorities believe it was authored by the Revolutionary Cells (RZ). The NATO
 pipeline has been surveilled by both the RZ and RAF in the past.
 V.......:. Ilawa Party Prisoners To Be Executed
 Dawa prisoners sentenced to death for their part in the December 1983 bombings
 of the US Embassy and other targets. The executions reportedly were to have
 taken place shortly after the end of Ramadan (19 June) but were delayed, possibly
 because the Kuwaiti Government did not want the action to complicate the TWA
 hostage crisis. Meanwhile, security has been tightened around key Kuwaiti
 installations and public figures.
 If Kuwait executes the three prisoners, Hizballah elements in Lebanon are likely
 to retaliate by killing some of the seven American hostages still held there. Islamic
 Jihad communiques have demanded the release of the Dawa prisoners as the price
 for release of the American hostages. Radical Shias probably would also attack
 Kuwaiti Government personnel if the executions take place.

 West Germany-Libya      Bonn Responds to Increased Libyan-Sponsored Terrorism
 A Libyan terrorist hit team leader was reportedly arrested and deported from
 West Germany in early June after attempting to extend his expired visa. He
 claimed to have been seeking medical treatment in Germany, but he was believed
 to be planning to assassinate a Libyan dissident. Later that month, three officials
 assigned to the People's Bureau and a nonofficial Libyan were expelled. One was
 expelled for his involvement in two assassinations in April. Three others were
 deported for their alleged recruitment of two West German citizens for terrorist
 activities. The two were reportedly sent to Tripoli for terrorist training and then
 tasked to kill Libyan dissidents residing in Europe. The West German Government
 publicly denied reports of expulsions.
 Fatah Implicated in Terrorist Attacks
 Swiss investigations of three bombings of Syrian and Libyan targets in
 Switzerland in April suggest Yasir Arafat's Fatah organization was responsible.
 The two Palestinians arrested for the bombings, Jalal al-Bin `Abd al-Fattah
 Ahmid and Muhammad Harridan Tahir, maintained that they were acting for a
 small independent Lebanese group, but documents in their possession, including
 telephone numbers, addresses, names, and financial receipts, have led police to
 Fatah's doorstep. In particular, the Swiss have concluded that they were supported
 This is the first confirmation that Fatah has returned to terrorism outside Israel
 and to the West Bank since Yasir Arafat banned such attacks in 1974. In the last
 year, pro-Arafat PLO members have been attacked by radical Palestinian groups
 backed by Syria, and Fatah appears to be undertaking a campaign of terrorism in
 response. The arrest of three Palestinians on 11 July in Madrid for plotting to
 attack the Syrian Ambassador to Spain suggests the campaign is continuing and
 France-Caribbean         Dealing With Terrorists?
 Luc Reinette, fugitive leader of the Caribbean Revolutionary Alliance, a pro-
 independence terrorist group in the French Antilles, announced on 2 July that he
 met twice last year with emissaries of the French Government. He claimed that
 French officials wanted to work out a moratorium on terrorist acts. Reinette's
 account has been disputed by one government spokesman, who acknowledged only
 that an intermediary from Foreign Minister Dumas met with the terrorist leader
 at Reinette's request. His charges, however, may be more accurate than the
 French have so far admitted; French officials have previously sought to work out
 accommodations with similar groups elsewhere.

 These charges could be particularly embarrassing, coming as they do at a time
 when world attention is focused on ways to combat terrorism. Paris is sensitive to
 recurring charges that France under Socialist rule has become a haven for
 international terrorists. In addition to foreign criticism, opposition politicians have
 been quick to bludgeon the leftist government with accusations of softness on
 end of the investigation.
 Suspect in Anti-American Bar Bombing?
 On 1 1 June the Athens public prosecutor issued a warrant for an unknown Greek-
 American allegedly responsible for the bombing of "Bobby's l1"-a bar in
 Glyfada-that wounded 67 people on 2 February 1985. However, unconfirmed
 reports indicate that an unidentified Palestinian was responsible for the attack.

 prosecute is apparently a legal maneuver commonly used in Greece when a
 suspect's identity is unknown. The authorities may intend the action to signal the

 Aid to Confrontation States Terminated
 On 17 July the National Assembly voted to cancel Kuwaiti aid commitments to
 Syria, Jordan, and the PLO under the 1978 Baghdad Pact. Assembly members
 charged that the nearly $300 million per year that Kuwait has paid out to those
 states has been used neither for confrontation with Israel nor for direct aid to the
 Palestinian people. A factor in the decision may have been the popular beliefs that
 Syria was behind the I I July cafe bombings in Kuwait and that Jordan may reach
 an agreement with Israel that would preclude the resettlement of Kuwait's large

 way to deliver the aid to the confrontation states, possibly tying Syrian funds to a
 promise by Damascus to control terrorism. Syria and Jordan are reportedly
 Surge in Terrorist Violence
 Increased kidnapings and murders in the capital area in recent weeks prompted
 Guatemalan Chief of State Mcjia on 4 July to threaten to impose a "state of
 exception," restricting the press and other civil liberties. Public reaction from
 Guatemala's politicians has been uniformly negative, and some have charged that
 the military intelligence components probably are responsible for some of these
 incidents:
 ? On 1 July a youth was killed on the campus of the University of San Carlos in
 Guatemala City. This was the third murder on the campus in a month.
 ? On 2 July a student at the Quetzaltenango campus of the University of San
 Carlos was abducted by unknown persons.
 ? On 5 July a leader of the student workers' union and his family sought refuge at
 the Venezuelan Embassy in Guatemala City, presumably to escape the violence.
 ? On 12 July a professor and financial expert who had helped draft Guatemala's
 new value-added tax was found shot to death. He had disappeared several days

 On 4 July six Mormon churches were the targets of coordinated bombings
 throughout Chile. There were no injuries and property damage was extensive at
 only one location. The chapels were also spray painted with slogans saying, "Yanks

 use the tiny Pacific island as an emergency landing site for the space shuttle. The
 Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR) claimed responsibility for the
 bombings in a communique that charged that the Mormon church is the
 "spearhead of the United States intelligence services." In addition, the US-
 Chilean Binational Center at Rancauga, just south of Santiago, was bombed. No

 Bombings of US-related facilities in Chile have increased markedly over the past
 three years. Reporting from the US Embassy indicates that there was one such
 bombing in 1982, five in 1983, 14 in 1984, and, as of early July, 15 in 1985.
 Mormon facilities were bombed eight times prior to the new spate of attacks.

 in bombing attacks on four district headquarters of the American Popular

 to the bombings, most of the capital was blacked out for nearly 20 minutes after

 Soweto riots. After the 20 June explosion of a pamphlet bomb, police-in an
 unusual display of concern-cordoned off the area and began routinely checking
 suspicious packages. Two additional bombings occurred on 12 and 15 July. Only a

 the device contained about a kilogram of explosive and screws and other bits of
 metal that acted as shrapnel. No one has claimed responsibility, but a letter was
 delivered to the US Embassy in Islamabad that afternoon that threatened
 "unexampled punishment" for the United States in Pakistan because of the US

 Terrorism in Europe,
 1984/85 (Part I)'
 European countries rank high on the list of those
 afflicted by political terrorism. Occasional terrorist
 acts take place in countries of the Eastern Bloc, but
 the strong and repressive security establishments and
 the limited observance of civil rights in these countries
 inhibit most would-be terrorists. Thus, it is in the
 liberal democratic states of Western Europe that
 terrorists seem to thrive.
 Most of the terrorists operating in Western Europe
 fall into three broad categories:
 ? Indigenous leftwing extremists.
 ? Indigenous separatists and irredentists.
 ? Foreigners, chiefly from the Middle East.
 During the past year and a half, leftwing terrorist
 groups in West Germany, France, and Italy
 rebounded from government counterterrorism
 successes and demonstrated violently that predictions
 of their imminent demise had been premature.
 Established groups in Spain, Portugal, and Greece
 continued their terrorist campaigns, while new groups
 surfaced in Belgium and the Netherlands, both
 countries hitherto relatively free from terrorism.
 There were disturbing indications that leftwing
 terrorists of several nationalities were beginning to
 band together.
 Leftwing Terrorism-the "Euroterrorist Alliance"
 In France, the leftwing extremist group Action
 Directe (AD) conducted a number of bombings in the
 summer of 1984 against targets that it declared to be
 involved with NATO and the Western defense effort.
 Among them were the Atlantic Institute for
 International Affairs, the European Space Agency,
 and the Western European Union. Two similar AD
 bombings against defense-related industrial firms
 followed in October. Especially galling to the French
 Government, most of the AD terrorists involved had
 been in prison until released in an amnesty following
 the election of Francois Mitterrand in 1981.
 In Belgium, a new leftwing extremist group, the
 Communist Combatant Cells (CCC), surfaced on
 2 October with a number of bombings in Brussels.
 The targets were facilities of Litton Data Systems,
 Honeywell-Europe, and the West German truck
 manufacturer M.A.N. In its communiques claiming
 credit for the actions, the CCC linked the targets to
 NATO, in particular to the deployment of the new
 NATO cruise missiles. In December the CCC
 bombed the headquarters of Prime Minister Martens'
 Democratic Party (which had supported deployment
 of the new missiles). It also bombed, at six points, the
 pipeline bringing fuel from West Germany for NATO
 forces. And it bombed a communications antenna at
 Bierset Airfield near Liege, where aircraft assigned to
 The Irish, Basque, and Corsican separatists all
 suffered severe blows at the hands of the governments
 with which they have been warring but demonstrated
 their staying power by continuing nevertheless to
 engage in terrorist acts. Armenian terrorism also
 continued, although at a lower level than in previous
 years. In 1984 over 60 incidents in Europe involved
 citizens of the Middle East, most frequently
 Palestinians and Libyans. Overall, nearly 250
 international terrorist incidents took place in Europe,
 more than in any other region of the world.

 NATO are based.
 In West Germany, although the Red Army Faction
 (RAF) did not physically enter the fray until
 December, a general outline of the part it was to play
 in the international anti-NATO campaign was found
 in documents discovered in an RAF safehouse raided
 by West German security forces in July 1984. The
 documents depicted a three-pronged campaign:

 Secret
 ? First, the RAF prisoners would stage yet another
 hunger strike to press their longstanding demands to
 be collocated (potentially making them easier to
 rescue) and to be treated as political prisoners.
 ? Second, the members of the RAF Periphery (the
 militant supporters and sympathizers) would
 conduct a "low-level" bombing campaign against
 NATO and West German Government targets.
 ? Third, the RAF Commando (the hardcore urban
 guerrillas) would conduct a number of unspecified
 "spectacular" terrorist operations against targets
 related to NATO  presumably assassinations or
 kidnapings of important persons associated with
 NATO or bombings resulting in massive damage or
 casualties at NATO-related facilities.
 The RAF documents were discovered pursuant to the
 arrest in Frankfurt of six members of the RAF
 hardcore (one of them had accidentally discharged a
 pistol into the floor of their apartment). The
 documents contained the names of many potential
 individual targets, along with casing information on a
 number of facilities and installations related to
 NATO.
 The arrest of seven leading members -' and the
 compromise of their targeting information would lead
 most groups to lie low, but in the past the RAF had
 tenaciously followed its plans even after they had been
 compromised. Consequently, West German
 authorities were not surprised when on 4 December,
 the opening day of their trial, leading RAF members
 Brigitte Mohnhaupt and Christian Klar announced
 the beginning of a hunger strike by RAF prisoners in
 support of their demands. More than 30 other RAF
 prisoners joined the hunger strike.
 The violent phase began on 17 December, when RAF
 supporters firebombed a Siemens Company
 warehouse in Frankfurt. The next day the RAF
 Commando attempted a spectacular attack: a man
 dressed in a US Marine Corps uniform drove a car
 rigged with explosives onto the grounds of the NATO
 officer's training school in Oberammergau, parked it,
 and then ran off. Only a faulty timing mechanism
 prevented a potentially devastating explosion. By the
 end of December, more than a dozen related incidents
 of violence had been recorded in West Germany,
 including incendiary or bombing attacks against
 French, US, and Turkish diplomatic installations.
 Culmination of the Campaign. The apparently
 coordinated international campaign continued
 through January, as reports spread that some of the
 RAF hunger strikers were nearing death. In the
 ,Netherlands, a new group, the Northern Terror
 Front, conducted a number of bombings in sympathy
 with the RAF, though there is debate whether this
 was not simply the work of an individual. A group in
 Greece conducted a similar bombing. In Brussels, a
 CCC team bombed the guardpost at the US NATO
 Support Activity building: two US servicemen would
 have been killed, except that they ran out of the
 building. The CCC declared in its subsequent
 communique that the group would no longer try to
 avoid causing casualties. In Paris, an AD team
 assassinated Gen. Rene Audran, the Defense Ministry
 official in charge of selling French arms abroad: it
 was the first ever premeditated AD killing with
 possible RAF participation. In West Germany, one
 RAF terrorist was killed and another seriously injured
 as they bombed a computer facility. On 1 February in
 Munich, an RAF team murdered Dr. Ernst
 Zimmermann, head of the German firm Motoren and
 Turbinen Union (MTU) as well as of the West
 German association of aerospace firms.
 Shortly after the Zimmermann assassination, the
 RAF prisoners abandoned their hunger strike,
 declaring that their underlying objectives had been
 achieved. This signaled the end of the campaign: for
 several months thereafter, all three groups refrained
 from terrorist attacks. Even lucrative events where
 terrorist attacks would earn the perpetrators
 enormous publicity  such as the Bonn Economic
 Summit and the Paris Air Show- passed without
 major incident. Nevertheless, since none of the
 perpetrators have been captured, the groups clearly
 retain the capability to conduct further major
 terrorist attacks.

 Secret
 Evidence of Links. The timing of the attacks and the
 similarity of the targets suggested that the three
 groups were in some fashion working together in what
 was termed a "Euroterrorist alliance." There was
 more specific evidence as well, some rhetorical, some
 physical:
 ? The CCC indicated that its attack on a
 communications antenna at Bierset Airfield was in
 commemoration of the 1981 bombing by the RAF
 of facilities at the US airbase in Ramstein, West
 Germany. It dedicated its attack on the US NATO
 Support Activity building to past RAF martyrs and
 current RAF hunger strikers.
 ? The points at which the CCC bombed the NATO
 pipeline in Belgium in December had been marked
 on a document found at the RAF safehouse in
 Frankfurt the previous July.
 ? Examination of the RAF's Oberammergau device
 revealed it contained dynamite from a batch of
 explosives stolen the previous year from a Belgian
 quarry. A car bomb planted earlier in 1984 in Paris
 by Action Directe had contained dynamite from the
 same source, and more of it was found in the
 possession of a Turkish emigre associated with
 Action Directe when he was arrested trying to enter
 France in April 1985.
 ? In mid-January 1985 the RAF and Action Directe
 issued an unprecedented joint communique in Paris
 declaring they had united in a war against NATO.
 ? Later the same month, Action Directe dedicated its
 slaying of General Audran to the memory of an
 RAF terrorist who had died some years earlier in a
 shootout with West German police.
 ? RAF press releases crowed over the enormous
 reaction the international anti-NATO campaign
 had generated both in the media and in the halls of
 government; one took particular note of the fact that
 US Secretary of State Shultz had mentioned the
 campaign in a speech.
 More Smoke Than Fire? The abundant evidence,
 however, indicates that such cooperation as did occur
 was minimal. Cooperation on the logistic front has
 been common among West European terrorist groups
 in the past, and many of them have long opposed
 capitalism, NATO, and the US role in Europe. What
 these ideologically compatible groups apparently did
 was to conduct similar operations, during a particular
 time period, against local elements of a mutual
 international enemy. There is no evidence of a merger
 among them, a point that was made by some members
 of Action Directe who specifically denied that their
 organization had merged with the RAF. Moreover,
 membership in the alliance was far from universal.
 Other Leftwing Terrorism
 In Italy, the Red Brigades did not participate in the
 anti-NATO campaign, despite their known anti-
 "imperialist" and anti-NATO sentiments.' In fact,
 the Red Brigades did very little in 1984; they claimed
 responsibility for the assassination in Rome in
 February 1984 of US citizen Leamon Hunt, Director
 General of the Multi-National Task Force in the
 Sinai. Authorities have considerable doubt that this
 claim was genuine. The Lebanese Armed
 Revolutionary Faction (LARF) also claimed credit for
 the act, but the evidence of culpability is sparse and
 ambiguous
 In 1984 the BR underwent a serious factional
 struggle, with those who favored a primary reliance
 on violence-generally the newer members-besting
 and ejecting those members who advocated that the
 organization split its efforts between violence and
 political action. The first confirmed BR terrorist act
 in more than a year took place in March 1985, with
 the murder of a Rome University economist involved
 with government efforts to reduce cost-of-living wage
 adjustments. In the first half of 1985, the authorities
 arrested a number of important BR fugitives,
 including Barbara Balzarani, believed to be the senior
 Red Brigades member still at large (she was wanted
 for numerous offenses, including involvement in the
 assassination of Aldo Moro). These arrests should set
 the organization back for a few months at least.
 ' In the past, expatriate Italian terrorists in France have been
 connected with Action Directe, and it is possible that some Italians

 In Spain, the October First Antifascist Resistance
 Group (GRAPO) continued sporadically to conduct
 attacks against government, military, and business
 targets, as well as against interests of foreign
 countries it regards as "imperialist." The group also
 robbed banks and launched an extortion campaign to
 raise funds. Some of GRAPO's attacks were against
 French businesses in Spain, in support of the protest
 by the Spanish Basque terrorist group ETA of a
 French crackdown on its operations and personnel in
 southern France.' Similarly, in mid-January 1985
 GRAPO attacked a Mercedes-Benz dealership in
 Barcelona, declaring its solidarity with the "political
 prisoners" of West Germany; there is no evidence,
 however, of any concrete linkage between GRAPO
 and the other Euroterrorists. On 19 January 1985
 Spanish police and security forces rounded up some
 30 members of GRAPO-all the members they knew
 about, except for one who fled to France. The group
 has been very quiet since then.
 In Portugal, the Popular Forces of 25 April (FP-25)
 suffered a devastating police crackdown in mid-1984
 in which several dozen of its members-including its
 political leaders-were arrested. Within a few
 months, however, the group rebounded with a new
 round of terrorist attacks against landowners,
 business leaders, and government interests. In
 addition, beginning in October the group began
 attacking foreign targets as well. In solidarity with
 ETA, FP-25 struck at French business targets. In

 There was no previous evidence of operational cooperation
 between GRAPO and ETA, and, considering the disparities
 between their memberships, philosophies, and goals, such
 cooperation seems unlikely. Thus, these incidents probably were

 Recent Developments in Armenian Terrorism
 Because the homeland of their forebears lies largely in
 Europe and because the primary focus of their
 animosity is the Turkish Government, the Armenian
 terrorists are often thought of as European irredentists.
 In fact, most of the Armenian terrorists hail from the
 Middle East, and the "country" that they aim to
 reestablish never actually existed in modern history
 Although the names of the groups and their operatives
 have changed repeatedly, over the past few years the
 Armenian terrorists have been concentrated in two main
 strands: a leftwing strand centered on the Armenian
 Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA)
 and a rightwing strand associated with the international
 Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), better
 known as the Dashnak Party.
 ASALA originated in the mid-1970s in the Armenian
 quarter of East Beirut. Its members, heavily influenced
 by radical and left-leaning Lebanese and Palestinians,
 offered a direct challenge to the traditional dominance
 of the once revolutionary but now conservative Dashnak
 Party, not only in Lebanon but in other countries-
 France, Canada, and the United States-in which large
 numbers of Armenians had settled following their
 diaspora. The Dashnak response was to establish a
 competing terrorist group, the Justice Commandos of
 the Armenian Genocide (JCAG), also headquartered in
 East Beirut and composed largely of Lebanese
 Armenians.
 The Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 made it difficult
 for the Armenian terrorists to continue using their
 convenient operational bases in Beirut, and the
 extremists reportedly dispersed to Iran, Syria, and the
 Syrian-controlled part of Lebanon. ASALA also
 maintains a propaganda office in Greece.
 Already weakened by a serious internal division over the
 use of indiscriminate violence, ASALA suffered a crisis
 in mid-1983, after hardliners set off a bomb at Orly
 Airport outside Paris that killed seven persons and
 wounded more than 60, most of them innocent
 bystanders. A faction that believed ASALA should
 attack only Turkish targets split from the more militant
 members, establishing a separate group called the
 ASALA Revolutionary Movement (ASALA-RM). The
 intensity of their disagreement reportedly resulted in an
 armed clash between the two factions in the Bekaa
 Valley in July 1983 that left four ASALA members
 As a result of these problems, ASALA terrorist activity
 has been at a low level during the past 18 months, with
 only the following incidents on record:
 ? In March 1984 in Tehran, following an announcement
 by Turkish Prime Minister Ozal that he would visit
 Iran, terrorists associated with ASALA (faction
 unknown) shot and wounded two Turkish diplomats as
 they were leaving their homes to go to work. Another
 Armenian terrorist was killed when the bomb he was
 trying to install in another Turkish diplomats car
 blew up in his face.
 ? In April 1984 in Tehran, an ASALA operative (faction
 unknown) shot and killed a Turkish businessman.
 ? In August 1984 in Beirut, ASALA bombed the shops
 of three allegedly "reactionary" Armenian merchants.
 ? In December 1984 in Beirut, the Air France ticket
 office was bombed, probably by ASALA-RM, to
 protest the imprisonment of Armenian extremists in
 Nothing has been heard from the Justice Commandos
 for some time. In their place, however, a new group has
 sprung up called the Armenian Revolutionary Army
 (ARA). Like the rightist JCAG, it is believed to be a
 creature of the Dashnaks, and like JCAG its raison
 d'etre seems to be competing with the leftist ASALA for
 the allegiance of the young adult activists of the
 Armenian diaspora. The ARA conducted only three
 operations in the past year and a half, but all of them
 were major incidents:
 ? In June 1984 in Vienna, an ARA car bomb killed the
 Turkish labor attache and injured five other persons.
 ? In September in Istanbul, two ARA members died
 while preparing explosive devices for use against an
 unknown Turkish target.
 ? In November in Vienna, ARA members shot and
 killed the Turkish Deputy Director of the UN Center
 for Social Development and Humanitarian Alfairs.
 ? In March 1985 in Ottawa, three members of ARA
 seized the Turkish Embassy. The Ambassador was
 injured when he escaped by jumping from a window. A
 Canadian security guard was killed and 13 persons
 were held hostage for several hours before the
 terrorists surrendered.

 deeply rooted that there is little their opponents can
 do to mollify them. The Irish Catholic citizens on
 whose behalf the Provisional Irish Republican Army
 (IRA) claims to be operating, for example, constitute
 only about a third of Ulster's population. Not all of
 them support the Provos's, goals-much less their
 tactics-while the Protestant majority is uniformly
 and adamantly opposed to them. Thus, the demands
 of the Provos cannot reasonably be accommodated
 The desires of many Armenians for redress of
 historical grievances are also both understandable and
 exceedingly difficult to satisfy. Few Armenians
 remain in Turkey-almost none in the Turkish part of
 the historical Armenian homeland-and the modern
 Turks deny responsibility for what may have
 happened under the Ottomans there 70 years ago. The
 expatriate Armenian terrorists-a tiny minority of all
 Armenians-who prey upon Turkish targets therefore
 have no rational prospect of success
 Sometimes, enlightened government policies lure
 supporters away from the separatist extremists until
 only a small, embittered, and recalcitrant hardcore
 remains to continue the struggle. In Spain, for
 example, the Basque separatists have slowly lost the
 influence they had developed during the Franco years,
 as decentralization and democratization have
 unfolded under the present constitutional monarchy;
 nevertheless, the Military Wing of Basque Fatherland
 and Liberty (ETA/M) refuses to give up. Similarly,
 the French Government believes that almost all
 Corsicans are basically satisfied with the present
 governing arrangement, and that no more than
 2 percent of the Corsican people favor independence
 from France. Among the few who do favor
 independence are some very active terrorists from the
 National Front for the Liberation of Corsica (FNLC).

 Secret
 In Spain, the ETA suffered a series of stiff blows
 during the past 18 months. Tougher antiterrorism
 laws were proposed, and budget increases led to the
 bolstering of the counterterrorism forces, permitting
 them to adopt more aggressive tactics within the
 country. In addition, a series of political initiatives
 from Madrid enhanced the political and economic
 autonomy of the Basque region, thereby undercutting
 the support of the Basque community the ETA needs
 to remain viable over the long term.
 During the same period, in response to continuing
 Spanish diplomatic pressure, French security forces
 began arresting accused Basque terrorists who had
 long enjoyed sanctuary in southern France and who
 were believed to be using such sanctuaries as bases
 from which to stage terrorist operations into Spain.
 Some were forcibly resettled in northern France (of
 those, some later infiltrated back to the Basque area
 of southern France); others were deported to various
 African and Latin American countries. Three,
 accused on apparently credible evidence of capital
 crimes, were extradited to Spain to stand trial, in a
 notable break with the French tradition (on which the
 "etarras" had long relied) of refusing extradition in
 political cases. The extraditions were criticized by
 French supporters of this tradition.'
 The Counterterrorists. Not the least of ETA's
 problems in France were the activities of the
 mysterious Antiterrorism Liberation Group (GAL),
 which surfaced in December 1983 with a number of
 attacks on ETA members and supporters in their
 French sanctuaries. During the last 18 months, GAL
 attackers killed 12 persons accused of being members
 or supporters of ETA, and wounded at least 23 others.
 Anonymous spokesmen explicitly identified most of
 these attacks as retaliation for specific ETA attacks
 against Spanish officials and police.
 A number of GAL operatives have been apprehended.
 They constitute a mixed bag of members of the
 Spanish and French criminal underworld-often
 veterans of the Spanish or French Foreign Legions.
 Neither the identity of GAL's directors, however, nor
 the sources of its funding, equipment, and intelligence
 have been firmly established. Some observers have
 speculated that Basque businessmen and
 industrialists, tired of ETA's attacks on their
 personnel and facilities, as well as ETA's
 "revolutionary taxes," may be behind GAL. More
 likely to be true are the persistent rumors and
 allegations that local or national elements of the
 Spanish Government are involved-although
 government spokesmen have denied it.
 Inevitably, the extradition of ettaras produced a
 backlash in Spain in the form of dozens of attacks by
 ETA on French-registered vehicles and French
 businesses-especially French auto dealers whose
 large show windows offered attractive and vulnerable
 targets. Because both the GAL attacks in France and
 the ETA responses in Spain cut across national
 boundaries, they were included in our count of
 international incidents. They were, in fact, the
 primary cause of the increase in the number of
 international terrorist incidents recorded in Western
 Europe in 1984.
 In France, the FNLC remained active during the past
 year and a half but, owing to the arrests, trials, and
 convictions of several leading members, on a
 downward trend. Although precise numbers are not
 available, the FNLC is believed to have carried out
 about 800 bombings in 1982, about 600 in 1983, and
 probably fewer than 400 last year (most on the island,
 a few on the mainland). At midyear 1985, in fact,
 after a night of numerous bombings, the group
 declared a cease-fire. The pause, however, is likely to
 be a short one. Nevertheless, since most of the
 FNLC's bombs cause no casualties and little damage,
 and since it receives very little support from the
 Corsicans, the FNLC constitutes more of a nuisance
 than a serious terrorist threat.
 " One of the two who had been acquitted subsequently applied for
 political asylum in France on the basis that his acquittal proved the
 accusations against him were politically motivated. The French
 Government denied the request.

 Secret
 Counterterrorism Prospects
 Indigenous Efforts. The democratic countries have
 found that the most effective and legal means of
 dealing with terrorists are to improve the security
 around probable targets, tighten their laws-by
 making membership in a terrorist group a crime, for
 example-and enhance security service and police
 capabilities so they can find the terrorists and put
 last year the Spanish Government passed new laws to
 make it easier to bring suspected terrorists to trial.
 International Cooperation. After every major
 international terrorist event, affected countries seek
 ways to improve cooperation among their police,
 security, and intelligence services. At the current
 time, virtually all relevant information about
 terrorists in the possession of one West European
 government is shared with the others that need it; and
 all of the governments concerned have continued to
 search actively for ways in which they can work
 together more closely and effectively.
 The impediments to expanding cooperation rest
 largely on basic political or philosophical differences
 among the countries. The French tradition of offering
 political asylum, for example, usually prevents Paris
 from agreeing to extradite accused terrorists unless
 they are indicted on purely criminal charges-but this
 indicate that Turkey also adopted a "repentance" law
 in June 1985 to encourage members of subversive
 groups to become informers.
 Not all the legal developments have favored the
 counterterrorism forces, however. In Italy the judicial
 and penal system had been under heavy criticism for
 years over abuses of the preventive detention laws.
 More than half of the inmates, including many who
 had been imprisoned for years, were still awaiting
 trial or the processing of their appeals. In some cases,
 this was merely a reflection of the slowness of the
 Italian legal process; in other cases, authorities were
 keeping suspects (especially accused terrorists and
 gangsters) in "pretrial detention" as long as they
 could before admitting they lacked the evidence to
 obtain convictions. In an attempt to redress abuses, a
 reform law scheduled to take effect later this year
 would limit the imposition of preventive detention-to
 be called "protective custody"-and could result in
 the release of some 300 suspected or convicted
 terrorists.
 Greece an Exception. Most of the West European
 governments suffering from terrorism have
 established aggressive and sophisticated
 counterterrorism programs and cooperate actively
 with one another. The Greek Government is an
 exception. Although Athens participates in some of
 the international counterterrorism working groups
 that have been established in recent years, it has not

 is rarely possible in terrorist cases.
 Innovative Legal Measures. Besides improving police
 and security capabilities and international
 cooperation, some West European governments have
 tried innovative measures in the legal realm. One
 example is the
 temporary legislation in Italy several years ago that
 permitted authorities to offer vastly reduced sentences
 to truly "penitent" terrorists. Several hundred
 accused terrorists turned informer, enabling
 authorities to put the major leftwing terrorist groups
 all but out of business for nearly two years. In view of
 such successes, Spain last year instituted a de facto
 "penitent" policy, with formal provisions included in
 an antiterrorism bill before parliament. Press reports
 done so in the spirit of expanded cooperation.
 Athens has been frequently criticized for its lack of
 success in, and Prime Minister Papandreou's
 ambivalance to, pursuing and neutralizing indigenous
 terrorists, and for its failure to provide adequate
 security for likely terrorist targets. Security at the
 Athens airport, for example, has been notoriously lax.
 The terrorist who fired the rocket against the Alia
 aircraft on 4 April walked into the airport through a
 hole in the perimeter fence. The Lebanese terrorists
 who hijacked TWA Flight 847 on 14 June after it
 took off from the Athens airport may have brought
 their pistol and handgrenades right through the

 airport security check system. (There is some
 reporting, however, that suggests the hijackers had
 accomplices who helped them circumvent airport
 security.) The Greek Government did its
 counterterrorism reputation no good either, when it
 released from custody one of the skyjackers' comrades
 who had missed the plane in Athens in return for the
 subsequent release of three passengers, two of whom
 were of Greek extraction.
 A Standof. In summary, then, many West European
 countries enjoyed considerable success against
 terrorists in the past 18 months-especially the
 United Kingdom, West Germany, Italy, Spain, and
 Portugal. On the other hand, the French, the
 Belgians, and the Greeks had relatively little to show
 for their efforts. In most cases, however, even groups
 that suffered great blows from the authorities
 demonstrated the capability and determination to
 continue their terrorist operations-if at reduced
 levels for a while.
 The consequence appears to be a standoff. The
 counterterrorism forces seem able to limit but not
 eliminate the activities of terrorists, since the
 advantage lies always with the terrorist, who can pick
 the time, target, and tactic. Moreover, although most
 individual terorists will be caught over the long term,
 terrorist groups have shown they can replenish such
 losses. Indeed, some terrorist groups in Western
 Europe seem to have acquired a kind of institutional
 permanence that enables them to withstand repeated
 operational failures and decimations of personnel.
 And terrorism itself seems to have become a kind of
 "profession" that attracts a small but consistent
 stream of volunteers who think of themselves as part
 of an international brotherhood.

 Romania's Arab Students:
 A Growing Terrorist Problem
 for the Regime
 The growing political activism of Arab students
 attending Romanian universities is complicating
 President Ceausescu's efforts to maintain good
 relations with all the countries and political
 movements in the Middle East and may portend
 further terrorist activities in Romania. Intra-Arab
 student rivalries have resulted in several violent
 incidents in Romania in recent months, and we
 believe the situation is ripe for additional flareups.
 Ceausescu's efforts to promote a negotiated
 settlement in the Middle East, his open support for
 PLO chief Yasir Arafat, and Romania's ties to Israel
 could even make the Romanians themselves a target
 for supporters of the radical Arab states and their
 client Palestinian groups. Terrorists could also use the
 student network to carry out attacks against US or
 other Western targets. Bucharest probably has
 increased surveillance of its Arab students, but it is no
 doubt concerned that the security apparatus cannot
 ensure complete control.
 Foreign Students
 Bucharest actively promotes a large-scale educational
 program for foreign university students, mostly from
 Africa and the Middle East, as part of its efforts to
 expand relations with the Third World and to bolster
 its maverick foreign policy. The foreign students-
 especially the wealthy Arabs-also provide badly
 needed foreign exchange; since 1979, students not on
 scholarship must pay their tuition in hard currency.
 According to official statistics, in 1982 there were
 aproximately 20,000 foreign students in Romania;
 more than half of them were Arabs
 group, formerly known as the Black June
 Organization, which operates out of Syria. Its
 members have repeatedly attacked Jordanian targets
 elsewhere and threatened further violence since King
 Hussein agreed last November to allow PLO leader
 Arafat to chair a meeting of the Palestine National
 Council in Amman.
 Infighting among Arab students escalated again to
 terrorist violence in late May when two Romanian
 security officials were killed attempting to defuse a
 bomb planted in a Syrian student leader's car. The
 Romanian police apprehended two suspects but have
 been unwilling to provide information on their
 identity. A Romanian official did tell a US diplomat
 that the bomb had a sophisticated, antitamper
 detonation device so sensitive that the slightest
 movement could set it off. The force of the explosion
 was so great that metal car parts were blown four
 stories into the air. A second bomb was successfully
 defused.
 "Kid Glove" Security Response
 Since the December assassination, the Romanians
 have no doubt been bracing for further trouble and at
 a minimum have probably stepped up surveillance of
 the Arab students. In contrast to the often heavy-
 handed tactics the security service uses with its own
 citizens, however, Bucharest is extremely careful not
 to take actions that might provoke the Arabs or create
 a messy diplomatic incident. In most cases, we
 believe, they avoid active harassment, restricting their
 activities to intelligence collection. Only on rare
 occasions-when very alarmed by the volatility of the
 estimate the number of Palestinian students alone at
 6,000.
 The most serious incident to date involving Arab
 rivalries was the assassination in Bucharest last
 December of a Jordanian diplomat by a radical
 Palestinian student. The attack clearly surprised
 Romania's security network and caused a major
 political embarrassment for President Ceausescu. We
 believe the perpetrator was the Abu Nidal terrorist
 situation-does the regime resort to force.

 facilitate peace in the Middle East has given him

 all sides.          I
 Outlook
 Romania is unlikely to become a large-scale terrorist
 battleground because of its generally tight police
 controls, but the potential for occasional incidents of
 violence has increased. For example, the Jordanian
 Ceausescu's activities earlier this year no doubt
 attracted much criticism from radical Arabs in
 Romania and abroad. In February he had highly
 publicized meetings in Bucharest with Arafat, Israeli
 Prime Minister Peres, and a special envoy of Egyptian
 President Mubarak, and he also endorsed the PLO-
 Jordanian accord of I1 February between Arafat and
 King Hussein.
 Ceausescu is also experiencing pressure from Arab
 moderates. During a visit to Bucharest in April,
 Jordanian Foreign Minister Al Masri expressed anger
 over Ceausescu's refusal to extradite the assassin of
 the Jordanian diplomat or to allow a Jordanian
 security team to conduct an interrogation. Even
 personal appeals from King Hussein did not persuade
 Ceausescu to cooperate. Consequently, all other
 bilateral issues-including the King's response to a
 longstanding invitation to visit Romania-are on
 hold. While anxious for close ties with Amman,
 Bucharest no doubt fears that cooperation on the
 assassination investigation will jeopardize Romania's
 ties with radical Arabs-Syria and Libya  especially
 if they are implicated in the murder. The Romanians
 may also be concerned that the prisoner might reveal
 embarrassing information about Bucharest's
 cooperation with various Palestinian groups and that
 the extradition of the assassin might touch off
 violence from radical Palestinian students in
 Romania. To avoid taking sides, the Romanians
 probably will stage-manage a low-profile trial that
 will portray the assassin as being mentally unstable

 30 years in prison."
 We think there is also a risk that Ceausescu's role in
 Middle Eastern politics will sooner or later lead
 radical Arab students, for the first time, to attack
 Romanian targets. Ceausescu's initiatives to promote
 a negotiated Middle East settlement or the conviction
 and sentencing of the assassin of the Jordanian
 diplomat might be the catalyst. According to the US
 Embassy, Ceausescu has privately assured the
 Jordanian Foreign Minister that the outcome of the

 Ceausescu almost certainly recognizes that his Middle
 East balancing act is becoming more precarious and
 probably feels particularly vulnerable because the
 security apparatus cannot ensure complete control of
 the Arab students. As a result, we think Ceausescu,
 while not abandoning his evenhanded stand, will be
 cautious in pursuing activities that would anger Libya
 and having acted independently.

 El Salvador:
 Tracking Down the Terrorists
 Concerted Army operations against the guerrilla
 faction whose terrorist cadres were responsible for the
 19 June massacre of US Marines and civilians are
 hurting the insurgents. At the same time, the
 operations have uncovered evidence of an increasing
 emphasis on coordinated urban warfare by most
 elements of the five-faction guerrilla alliance, as well

 Outlook
 Although some rebel political leaders and other
 elements have condemned the Zona Rosa attacks, the
 influence of the hardliners is on the ascendancy. As a
 result, the population centers appear to be in for a
 period of low-risk, high-profile guerrilla operations.
 Within this milieu, threats against US personnel and
 interests in El Salvador will grow accordingly
 For their part, the armed forces will intensify
 operations against terrorist bases in the countryside
 and step up security in the capital. If PRTC losses
 continue to mount as a result of a sustained
 Salvadoran armed forces effort, it will help generate
 stronger arguments and divisions over tactics in the
 guerrilla alliance as a whole. Overall, government
 efforts probably will help contain terrorist
 capabilities, but the movement already under way by
 growing numbers of factions toward urban warfare
 suggests that the military will be unable to thwart all
