 Soviet Arms Transfers to Perspective
 the Third World
 Arms transfers have been the USSR's main instrument for advanc-
 ing its interests in the Third World as well as a major factor in
 improving its foreign trade and hard currency positions. Moscow
 currently faces challenges to the expansion of its export program
 from increased competition, rising consumer expectations, and the
 diminished ability of purchasers to pay. Moscow's lack of expertise
 in marketing and servicing may also hamper its sales efforts in the
 years ahead. But the Soviets' ability to sell and deliver equipment
 rapidly and their willingness to extend generous terms will continue
 to work to their advantage, and they will remain a major participant
 in the world arms trade for the foreseeable future
 Trends in Soviet Military Assistance to the Third World
 The USSR has aggressively promoted its military assistance pro-
 gram in the less developed countries for political and economic
 gains. The program has been highly profitable for Moscow, earning
 $5-6 billion annually in hard currency since the late 1970s. In-
 creased competition from other arms exporters, the current outlook
 for a stagnant or declining Third World arms market, and LDC
 financial problems will hamper expansion of Soviet arms sales and
 earnings.
 The most tangible political benefit the Soviets have obtained from
 Third World arms transfers has been entree to areas where they
 previously had little or no presence. They have almost always been
 able to establish a military advisory presence in the recipient state
 and to develop a corps of Soviet-trained nationals, both officers and
 soldiers. This provides opportunities for Soviet intelligence activities

 strong interest in maintaining ties to the USSR.

 weapons.
 The highest levels of the party, government, and military are
 involved in decisions on arms transfers because such decisions are an
 integral part of Soviet foreign policy and may have important
 consequences for domestic economic policy. Because of the need to
 coordinate arms transfers with annual economic plans and to await
 decisions from higher authorities at almost every level, the process is
 usually lengthy and creates a measure of inflexibility in negotia-
 tions. On the other hand, Politburo approval constitutes a national
 commitment, making the Soviet Union a fairly dependable source of
 new customers.

 The Hind is the Soviet entry in one of the most active sectors of the
 international arms market-attack helicopters. It has sold well to
 Moscow's traditional arms customers, but its operational shortcom-

 In 1984 the USSR produced 12.23 million barrels per day of crude
 oil and condensate-100,000 b/d less than in 1983. This decline (the
 first since World War II) reflects a host of problems in the oilfields.
 With production stagnant in West Siberia and falling in other
 regions, 1985 could see a nationwide decline of 200,000 to 300,000

 requirements and maintain exports to Eastern Europe without

 Over the past decade the Soviets have made sweeping changes in the
 production methods of their tank industry to facilitate production of
 tanks with increasingly expensive and complex components and
 subassemblies. Overall production of tanks has declined, while the
 industry's plant and equipment holdings have grown dramatically.
 This modernization will enable the Soviets to produce increasingly
 sophisticated and capable tanks more efficiently.

 Winning the Battle But Losing the War?
 Soviet agriculture is short of skilled workers. With the emphasis on
 rapid mechanization and widespread use of more sophisticated
 cropping and livestock-raising practices, the level of training and
 skills of the work force must be raised and the better educated
 workers must be retained on the farms. This will be difficult to
 achieve because the incentives the regime is offering do not go far
 enough to raise the average quality of the agricultural labor force.

 Soviet Arms Transfers
 to the Third World
 Perspective
 For the past two decades, arms transfers have been the USSR's main
 means of promoting its interests in the Third World. Initially designed to
 strengthen the Soviet Union's political and military position, this program
 also became, in the 1970s, a key factor in improving the USSR's foreign
 trade position. It has served the Soviets well in both respects. Largely as a
 result of security assistance, they have:
 ? Established and perpetuated relationships with many Third World states.
 ? Helped friendly regimes to survive.
 ? Gained access to air and naval facilities, thereby strengthening their
 global position vis-a-vis the United States and enhancing their ability to
 project force in most regions of the world.
 ? Increased pressure on the United States and its allies by bolstering the
 confidence and capabilities of leftist, "anti-imperialist" regimes.
 ? Established a favorable trade balance with the non-Communist Third
 World.'
 ? Earned hard currency (an estimated $5-6 billion annually).
 ? Made recipient states dependent on the USSR for compatible equipment,
 spare parts, maintenance, repairs, and training.
 ? Expanded their military advisory and technical presence in recipient
 states (to over 18,000 in 1984), thus increasing their ability to establish
 contact with and penetrate local institutions.
 ? Created a ripple effect by which recipient states such as Cuba and Libya
 become arms suppliers, enabling Moscow to distance itself from risky or
 questionable ventures.
 ? Gained support for many of their positions in international forums.
 Soviet-LDC trade figures do not include statistics for Soviet trade with Cuba and
 Vietnam, which, as CEMA members, are considered part of the., socialist" community. The
 amount of economic and military aid extended to these two countries (over $5 billion to
 Cuba and almost $2 billion to Vietnam in 1983) obviously affects the USSR's current
 account balance negatively.

 As an instrument of policy, security assistance has a number of important
 advantages for the Soviets. Many Third World regimes face internal
 instability and external pressure and are receptive to offers of military aid.
 It thus offers an easy point of entry for establishing a relationship.
 Secondly, the Soviets can compete successfully with the West in terms of
 the quality and quantity of military equipment supplied, the speed of
 delivery, and the extension of generous repayment terms; this is not the
 case in most areas of civilian technology. In addition, military equipment is
 a convenient commodity for Moscow. The Soviets can deliver obsolete
 systems (being retired from their own forces) to lesser Third World clients,
 particularly those to whom they are extending generous repayment terms.
 And they can sell more sophisticated systems to more important clients,
 either for hard currency or in exchange for geopolitical advantages.
 Arms transfers have assumed a major role in the Soviet foreign trade
 picture. In 1983 they accounted for 70 percent of all Soviet exports to the
 developing world and made up over 20 percent of total hard currency
 exports. While Moscow still makes concessionary arrangements with very
 close and very poor clients, the focus of the Soviet program has shifted to
 lucrative markets. In spite of the economic crisis in the Third World,
 continuing Soviet sales and the accumulated debt of its customers suggest
 that Moscow will continue to earn substantial income from its export
 program into the 1990s
 The article "Management of Arms Transfers to the Third World"
 describes the prolonged, bureaucratic process by which decisions concern-
 ing security assistance are made and implemented by the USSR. Because
 the program has important implications for foreign policy, foreign trade,
 and resource allocations, the highest party and government organs are
 involved in determining its direction and size. The complex military and
 civilian bureaucracy that oversees the negotiation and implementation of
 the program is cumbersome, and Soviet industry lacks the sophistication in
 marketing and servicing that its Western competitors possess. But the
 Soviets are dependable and predictable arms suppliers and can, if need be,
 respond rapidly to client needs.
 In spite of its many advantages, military assistance is limited as an
 instrument of policy. It is one dimensional in nature and often fails to
 satisfy other aspects of the recipient country's needs. When political or
 economic considerations become dominant, Moscow is far less able to
 compete successfully with the West. Egypt in the early 1970s provides the
 most striking example of this phenomenon. When Sadat decided to move
 politically to resolve differences with Israel, he turned away from the
 Soviet Union, which had no ability to help bring about a political solution.
 Moscow currently faces similar tendencies in southern Africa, where the
 United States has played a far more active role in the Angolan-South
 African negotiations over Namibia than have the Soviets.

 The Soviets also have proved both unable and unwilling to provide the
 economic assistance desperately needed in the Third World, and a number
 of Soviet arms recipients currently are trying to maintain security ties to
 the USSR while pursuing economic assistance in the West. Over the long
 term, such countries may be more reluctant to become closely tied to either
 East or West as they seek the advantages of dealing with both.
 Military assistance has failed to give the Soviets the leverage they seek to  25X1
 manipulate the behavior of their Third World clients. While they have
 gained support from recipient states for policies that are mutually advanta-
 geous or of secondary importance to those states, their efforts to use the
 arms supply lever to advance their own policy objectives at their clients' ex-
 pense generally have failed. The article examining Moscow's relations with
 three different arms clients demonstrates this shortcoming. Iraq has been
 one of Moscow's largest clients (almost $13 billion worth of arms), and
 Moscow has benefited in terms of hard currency and regional presence.
 But the USSR's numerous efforts to use arms supplies to gain policy
 concessions from Iraq (for example, to ease pressure on Iraqi Communists,
 cease attacks on Kurds, and stop the war with Iran) have failed and have 25X1
 served primarily to exacerbate strains in the bilateral relationship. Similar-
 ly, arms transfers to Guinea and Peru have provided Moscow entree to
 each but have not bought it significant political influence in either
 Moscow faces a number of constraints in its efforts to expand arms sales
 and thus further advance its position in the Third World. The article
 "Trends in Soviet Military Assistance to the Third World" suggests that
 the value of identified accords may be showing a downward trend. There
 are a number of factors involved in this trend. Some are cyclical (for
 example, the normal period of consolidation after the signing of a major
 contract) and some may prove transient (for example, the impact of the oil
 glut). Others appear to be long term in nature, however, and could have an
 impact on Moscow's ability to expand arms sales appreciably in coming
 years. These include:
 ? The diminished ability of Third World clients, including important
 purchasers, to pay for arms. Most developing countries are carrying
 heavy debts, and even wealthier arms purchasers are facing problems of
 overextension and debt. Moscow has been willing to renegotiate repay-
 ment terms with valued clients but has proved hard-nosed in dealing with
 others. The Soviets have been reluctant to make concessions even to
 Libya, their largest arms purchaser (over $15 billion in arms contracts).
 ? Shifting needs and expectations of recipient states. Many clients have
 become more demanding as they have had problems absorbing equip-
 ment already received or have perceived difficulties absorbing more
 systems. Some are unhappy with Soviet arms and seek better or more so-
 phisticated equipment. Others want to diversify their arms sources for
 political reasons.

 ? Increased competition from the West and the Third World. Traditional
 suppliers, including the United States, Western Europe, and China, have
 been joined by new ones, such as Brazil, in aggressive and successful
 marketing efforts. This has eaten into what might otherwise have proved
 strong markets for Moscow.
 In an effort to respond to rising demands and increased competition in
 recent years, the Soviets have upgraded their own marketing efforts,
 offering attractive packages and exporting some of their most sophisticated
 weapon systems. They have, for example, agreed to sell India the MIG-29,
 which is not yet fully integrated into the Warsaw Pact force structure. And
 they have entered into licensing and coproduction agreements with New
 Delhi on T-72 tanks and armored vehicles. These Soviet decisions almost
 certainly were driven by the desire to prevent India's purchasing such
 systems elsewhere.
 The article "The Soviet Hind Helicopter: Prospects for Exports" assesses
 Moscow's effort to market a sophisticated system that is not yet fully
 integrated into its own force structure. Moscow has sold the Hind in its tra-
 ditional markets, but has had difficulty breaking into new markets. This in-
 ability reflects the USSR's lack of marketing expertise as well as concern
 about military technology being compromised. The Soviets will have to
 become more adept and flexible in both areas if they are to compete
 effectively with sophisticated Western systems.
 The Soviets will continue aggressive efforts to maintain and increase their
 share of the Third World arms market in the years ahead. They will be
 particularly accommodating in negotiations with hard currency customers
 and countries they perceive as having geopolitical importance, but they will
 continue to use security assistance as a means to advance their position
 generally. Moscow almost certainly will be able to maintain an extensive
 arms export program, but may not expand it significantly or return to the
 hard currency bonanza enjoyed in the late 1970s. Continuing regional
 tensions, the desire for additional systems by old clients, competitive Soviet
 marketing of new and sophisticated systems, and a desire for diversification
 by many states guarantee Moscow a significant share of the Third World
 arms market.

 Trends in Soviet Military Assistance
 to the Third World
 Military assistance is by far Moscow's most important
 foreign policy tool for gaining access to less developed
 countries (LDCs). The Soviet security assistance pro-
 gram was begun in the mid-1950s primarily as a
 means of helping to establish a strong geopolitical
 position vis-a-vis the West, especially the United
 States. To this end, the Soviets made arms and other
 materiel available to almost any LDC at low prices
 and offered exceptionally generous repayment terms
 characterized by grace periods, eight- to 10-year
 repayment periods, and 2-percent interest rates.
 Moreover, Moscow provided rapid delivery and free
 training and maintenance services. By the mid- 1960s,
 the annual value of the program had reached half a
 billion dollars, concentrated mainly in Iraq, Syria,
 Egypt, and Afghanistan.
 Military Agreements
 In the early 1970s the Soviet quest for political and
 military advantage over the West, while still preemi-
 nent, was supplemented by a growing emphasis on
 hard currency earnings from security assistance. The
 newfound oil-based wealth of key customers in the
 Middle East and North Africa led the Soviets to
 charge these and some other LDCs higher prices for
 military assistance-a policy they could enforce be-
 cause Moscow's prices were below those for compar-
 able Western support. At the same time, the USSR's
 willingness to sell its most modern weapons set the
 stage for full-scale competition with Western suppli-
 ers in the lucrative Middle Eastern market. Continu-
 ing tensions in that region, along with increasingly
 active nationalist movements and revolutions in Sub-
 Saharan Africa, bolstered the Soviet role, and Mos-
 cow's generally rapid responses established a reputa-
 tion for dependability. These circumstances,
 accompanied by higher prices and the transfer of
 complex weapons (sometimes before Eastern Europe
 received them), propelled the USSR into second place
 behind the United States in the global market in
 1974-79, with agreements estimated at some $35
 After reaching a yearly high of $14 billion in 1980,
 the values of identified accords have averaged about
 $9 billion annually (in current dollars), compared with
 $6 billion between 1975 and 1979 (see table 1).
 Despite the growth-probably about 35 percent in
 constant terms-cyclical, political, and financial fac-
 tors held down expansion of the Soviet program:
 ? The sizable agreements signed in 1980 by Algeria
 and Libya largely obviated the need for new pur-
 chases by these countries in the short term.
 ? The Soviets decided to withhold full support from
 Iraq in 1980 after it initiated hostilities with Iran.
 ? Growing financial problems limited the ability of
 LDCs, even well-off clients like Libya, to make
 payments on Soviet military purchases.
 ? Western and Third World suppliers became more
 competitive.
 ? Many clients tended to upgrade inventories only
 selectively by acquiring follow-on support equip-
 ment, rather than making wholesale replacements of
 weapon systems.
 Recent E orts To Increase Arms Sales
 To help maintain its position in the Third World
 market, Moscow has in recent years supplied more
 advanced hardware, especially to the Middle East and
 Sub-Saharan Africa. In 1983, for example, large
 quantities of aircraft, tanks, and missiles were provid-
 ed to Iraq. In the face of a rapidly deteriorating
 security situation in Angola, Moscow, after several
 refusals, provided Luanda with its first SA-8 surface-
 to-air missiles and MI-24 helicopter gunships. A
 similar circumstance in Mozambique finally led to
 sizable aircraft deliveries to counter Western initia-
 tives. The Soviets also have become more willing to
 provide advanced systems to states not engaged in
 hostilities. Their most impressive success has been in
 India where, to head off an intense French sales

 effort, they sold production technology for T-72 tanks
 and armored vehicles. Even more important is a 1984
 agreement with India for the purchase and assembly
 of about 170 advanced MIG-29 fighter aircraft, val-
 ued at over $1 billion.
 The Soviets have capitalized on windfalls to acquire
 new customers in the Third World. The reliance of
 Nicaragua's Sandinistas on the Bloc and Cuba for
 military materiel is predicated largely on ideology
 (assistance began well before the July 1979 revolu-
 tion), although attractive financial terms also are an
 important factor. Jordan-in the wake of Israel's raid
 on Iraq's nuclear facilities-turned to Moscow in
 1981 for air defense equipment after failing to obtain
 similar weapons from the United States. Kuwait's
 $260 million deal in 1982 (the first with Moscow in
 five years) reflected a renewed diversification effort,
 despite opposition by Kuwaiti military officers.
 Soviet aggressiveness, however, has not been global.

 USSR: Exports to the LDCs, 1970-83
 purchases of some $15 billion, wanted to buy addi-
 tional advanced Soviet weapons last year, but report-
 edly was refused for financial and political reasons.
 And in several other cases, Moscow has pursued
 additional sales but met with failure. For example,
 Algeria has showed no inclination to reverse its policy
 of shifting to purchases from Western suppliers, and
 Egypt, recognizing US sensitivities, has kept its dis-
 tance from Moscow despite persistent Soviet efforts.
 Military Exports and Technical Services
 The USSR's security assistance program has been the
 major element in the expansion of Moscow's economic
 ties to the LDCs (see graph). The value of Soviet
 military exports to LDCs (including deliveries of
 major weapon systems, spare parts, ordnance and
 other support materials) rose from $1 billion in 1970
 to a record of more than $9 billion in 1982 and
 remained at about that level in 1983.' The hard
 ' These estimates are derived from Soviet trade statistics for the
 purposes of estimating trade flows. They are generally higher than
 the Intelligence Community's estimates of the value of observed
 military deliveries. The main difference between these two esti-
 mates is the valuation of follow-on supplies needed to maintain
 LDC inventories of Soviet military equipment
 currency portion of these exports totaled an estimated
 $7 billion in 1983, ranking second only to oil in Soviet
 hard currency exports. Exports of military supplies
 accounted for over 20 percent of total hard currency
 exports in 1983
 million annually since the late 1970s
 The Soviet military technical presence also has grown
 rapidly. In 1984 more than 18,000 Soviet military
 technicians and advisers were stationed in the LDCs,
 compared with an annual average of 7,500 during
 1970-75. This program focuses primarily on advisory,
 technical servicing, and training functions in Africa
 and the Middle East. Charges for advisory and tech-
 nical services can be high, with concessions usually
 made only for Moscow's poorest clients. These ser-
 vices are estimated to have earned Moscow over $100
 The Balance-of-Payments Perspective
 The USSR's military trade and aid program is largely
 responsible for Moscow's favorable balance-of-
 payments position vis-a-vis the LDCs (see table 2).
 Without the military exports, the USSR would have
 run sizable deficits in its trade with the LDCs rather
 than the surpluses its trade accounts show. Further-
 more, credits have financed a smaller share of total
 Soviet military exports than in the early 1970s.
 Credits financed almost 80 percent of arms exports in
 1970, but the share in 1979 was just over 20 percent.
 The share increased to about 40 percent in 1982 and
 almost 50 percent in 1983, largely because of Soviet
 credits to Syria. In addition, repayments on military
 credits offset a substantial share of credit drawings.
 According to our calculations, the USSR has been
 earning $6-8 billion annually from its military pro-
 gram (see table 3). Of this amount, we believe that at
 least $5-6 billion is paid for in hard currency or its
 equivalent.' These revenues not only pay for Soviet
 imports from the LDCs but also permit Moscow to
 purchase machinery and equipment and other prod-
 ucts from the developed West, where the USSR
 generally runs a trade deficit.
 ' In recent years, the USSR has been accepting oil in lieu of cash
 payments from Libya and Iraq, including some Saudi oil on Iraq's
 account. This represents a second-best solution to Moscow, in that

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/30: CIA-RDP88T00799R000200030003-5
 The USSR's financial support for its military exports
 to the LDCs can best be described as realistic. While
 generally expecting payment in cash or its equivalent
 from its wealthier customers, Moscow probably does
 not expect to conclude military sales agreements with
 its poorer customers without offering concessionary
 credits. Generally, the Soviets offer their clients 10-
 year credit terms with interest rates of 2 to 4 percent
 and a grace period of up to two years. These terms,
 however, can vary considerably, depending on the
 country purchasing the equipment and the type of
 equipment being sold. More generous credit arrange-
 ments have been extended to India and Afghanistan.
 Under the terms of the Indo-Soviet military trade
 agreement of 1980, for example, credits to India
 carry 15-year repayment terms at 2- to 3 -percent
 interest and a two-year grace period.
 These easy credit arrangements apparently apply
 only to sales of major weapon systems. For follow-on
 support and resupply of spares, maintenance, and
 ordnance, Moscow usually demands cash in advance
 or at the time of delivery. It does not hesitate to
 pressure even key client states like Libya, Syria,
 Angola, and Mozambique to make the required
 payments. According to a US Embassy source in
 Maputo, for instance, half of Mozambique's aircraft
 were grounded in late 1982 because of a lack of hard
 currency to purchase the required spare parts.
 In some cases, Moscow has been willing to adapt to
 the financial circumstances of its customers. Afghani-
 stan and Ethiopia, in particular, have received dis-
 counts of 75 percent and 50 percent, respectively, off
 the list prices. These discounts, which represent a
 substantial grant element in Soviet military trade
 with these clients, are valued at $1.6 billion for the
 1975-82 period. Moreover, following the Syrian set-
 back in Lebanon in the summer of 1982, Moscow
 replaced Syrian losses on terms that included grants
 and favorable credits
 Moscow's military sales program has also generated a
 sizable LDC debt to the USSR, estimated at almost
 $18 billion at yearend 1983. This debt ensures that
 LDC repayment obligations will remain considerable
 through 1990. A sizable portion of this debt (perhaps
 as much as 50 percent), however, is owed by countries
 that may well be unable to make their payments on
 schedule-for example, Ethiopia, South Yemen,
 North Yemen, Tanzania, and Mozambique. The
 USSR has already rescheduled the debt owed by
 many of these countries.
 The Domestic Economic Costs and Benefits
 The domestic cost to Moscow of its military exports is
 the resources used in their production. Until the early
 1970s, much of the equipment that the USSR sold to
 LDCs consisted of used items being retired from
 Soviet military forces. The cost to Moscow was
 represented by the resources necessary to overhaul,
 adapt, and ship the arms. Since then, however, the
 competition in the world arms market has led the
 Soviets to export mostly new equipment. In recent
 years sales have, on occasion, also included sophisti-
 cated equipment that only recently had been intro-
 duced into the USSR's military forces. The advanced
 air defense system delivered to Syria and the MIG-
 29s promised to India, for example, have not been
 fully integrated into the Warsaw Pact forces.
 The opportunity cost to the USSR of these exports
 has also risen as the growth of Soviet machine-
 building capacity has lagged behind the increase in
 requirements for investment goods, consumer dura-
 bles, and military hardware. When the growth rate of
 military procurement for its own forces slowed after
 1976, the continued growth in exports of military
 hardware probably was thrown into especially sharp
 relief.
 Moreover, the Soviets face some security and logistic
 problems when they instruct their clients in the use of
 exported systems. The problems of translating and
 sanitizing documentation have appeared to overwhelm
 them at times. The Soviets can limit or deny access to
 classified manuals by offering hands-on training to

 Prospects
 The prospect for substantial growth in Soviet military
 exports is dim although some increases in sales are
 possible. Several of Moscow's major arms clients have
 sought to diversify their sources of arms. With greater
 competition from other arms sellers and the current
 outlook for a stagnant or declining Third World arms
 market, an even more aggressive sales campaign will
 be required to expand sales beyond the present level.
 Moreover, financial problems facing most of the
 USSR's major arms customers will further hamper
 increased sales and earnings. Under these circum-
 stances, Moscow will probably have to offer better
 financial terms to LDC customers and agree to
 reschedule some debt payments, thus reducing the
 immediate economic payoff.
 Soviet arms exports will, nevertheless, remain sizable
 and will continue to be the dominant element in
 Soviet-LDC relations. Even with LDC financial prob-
 lems, arms exports will be an important earner of
 hard currency for Moscow. With the larger and more
 sophisticated LDC inventories of Soviet-built equip-
 ment, the provision of spare parts, ordnance, follow-on
 items, and services will play a larger role in the
 USSR's military export programs.

 Soviet Arms Transfers
 and Political Influence
 In some cases, potential political payoff appears to
 have been the primary motive in Soviet arms transfer
 programs in the Third World. The most tangible
 political benefit has been entree to areas where the
 USSR had little or no presence before. Arms deals
 have almost always been followed by the establish-
 ment of a Soviet military advisory presence and the
 development of a corps of Soviet-trained officers and
 soldiers. This provides opportunities for Soviet intelli-
 gence activities and, in many instances, has created a
 local constituency with a strong interest in maintain-
 ing ties to the USSR.
 This article excludes such Third World countries as
 Angola, Ethiopia, Vietnam, and Cuba, which enjoy a
 special client relationship with the USSR. These
 states are dependent on Soviet Bloc troops and/or
 large-scale military and economic backing that goes
 well beyond the arms transfers discussed here. Here
 we deal with the much larger and more varied group
 of nonclient arms recipients.
 The Soviets have often reinforced their ties to non-
 client states by manipulating the supply of equipment
 and spare parts. That is, once initial arms deliveries
 have been made, training and spare parts are doled
 out sparingly, prolonging the recipient's dependence
 on Moscow. When local complaints reach a high
 enough level, Moscow will offer a new arms package,
 followed by a new cycle of training and spares parts
 rationing. Prosperous Third World countries may be
 able to find alternative sources for some Soviet-made
 equipment, but many cannot.
 Even after the Soviet presence is established and a
 certain degree of recipient dependence has developed,
 Moscow's record in realizing political benefits has
 been mixed:
 ? Arms recipients have echoed Soviet positions on
 international issues, but this is almost always when
 they hold that position in any case (for example,
 Guinea's strong anticolonialist stand in the early
 1960s) or are relatively unconcerned (as in the case
 of Iraq's position on the invasion of Czechoslovakia).
 Seldom have the Soviets been able to impose their
 view when it conflicts with that of the recipient
 country. Indeed, they have sometimes followed the
 lead of their nonclient recipients or become em-
 broiled in regional disputes.
 ? The Soviets have gained access to some air and
 naval facilities, but it has usually been limited and
 carefully controlled. Many military aid recipients
 (including India, Madagascar, Congo, and Sey-
 chelles) have refused Soviet requests for access.
 ? The Soviets have also found it difficult to gain
 influence over domestic politics in nonclient recipi-
 ent states. Even a leader with close military ties to
 the Kremlin usually reacts strongly against per-
 ceived interference in his country's internal affairs,
 especially if he sees a challenge to his own position.
 Some who have received the most Soviet aid have
 been the harshest repressors of local Communist
 parties. The leverage that Moscow can develop is
 almost always restricted to specific military issues
 like future arms procurement.
 Given the fading appeal of Soviet-style socialism as a
 development model, the Soviets' difficulties in build-
 ing commercial ties, and their unwillingness to supply
 purely economic aid, the transfer of arms is the
 Kremlin's most effective instrument for developing
 and sustaining a position in the Third World coun-
 tries. Arms deals may not yield all of the benefits the
 Soviets may be seeking in a particular state, but they
 are usually the most effective instrument and often
 the only one available.
 Arms Transfer Relationships
 With Key Regional Actors. States in this category-
 probably the most important Soviet arms customers-
 generally play important roles in their region and are
 usually adjacent to and frequently at odds with pro-
 Western countries. Many can pay for weapons in hard

 currency and thus are able to diversify their sources of
 supply and put pressure on Moscow to be more
 forthcoming with sophisticated equipment. Recipients
 in this category include Libya, Algeria, Syria, India,
 and Iraq.
 Arms ties with these states have helped the Soviets to
 expand their presence in strategically important re-
 gions and to establish themselves as key players in
 regional diplomacy. The Soviets have also used these
 ties to broaden support for their positions on regional
 and international issues, when there was no conflict
 with the position of the recipient. India's support of
 Moscow's call for a ban on space weapons is an
 example.
 Moscow frequently "needs" the states in this first
 category and thus is reluctant to jeopardize its ties
 with them by applying pressure on key issues. With
 many of these governments, the arms relationship is
 the only real link, and Moscow hesitates to tinker with
 In some cases, recipient states have been a drag on
 Soviet policy, and often they can make Moscow bid
 against Western suppliers seeking to reenter that
 particular arms market. There are other risks as well.
 Soviet deliveries can fuel regional arms races, and
 some recipients (the Syrians, for example) could be
 emboldened to consider solving their foreign problems
 by military action, in the belief that the Soviets would
 have to back them up. From a Soviet standpoint,
 however, the benefits of the arms transfer ties with
 these potential clients probably outweigh the risks.
 With Third World Socialists. There are a number of
 Third World countries that are of little direct military
 importance to the Soviets but have leaders who
 profess to be fellow socialists, anti-imperialists, and
 anticolonialists. Almost always unable to pay in full
 for arms and training, these leaders usually want the
 arms to protect themselves from or to placate key
 domestic constituencies (military and security forces,
 for example), as well as for meeting foreign threats.
 Countries in this group include Zambia, Tanzania,
 Congo, Seychelles, and Guinea.
 To such regimes, Moscow offers weapons, support,
 and training on terms that at first are favorable, even
 concessionary. The equipment is usually unsophisti-
 cated, but, in many cases, it soon constitutes the
 recipient's entire arsenal. A relatively large Soviet
 advisory presence is established, and nationals are
 sent for military training in the USSR. Later, spare
 parts are supplied on less generous terms, and the
 recipient state finds that its military effectiveness
 depends heavily on Soviet largess.
 In most countries in this category, the Soviets have
 established a substantial military and diplomatic pres-
 ence to back up their arms transfer programs. In
 many, they have been able to create a body of high-
 ranking local military personnel who see that Soviet
 arms supplies are vital to their livelihood and who
 may exercise influence over future procurement deci-
 sions.
 Most of the recipients in this category also require
 large amounts of economic aid, however, which Mos-
 cow is unwilling to provide. Consequently, even the
 most radical recipient states try to avoid alienating
 Western aid donors by drawing too close to the
 Soviets. Moreover, their leaders invariably have been
 sensitive to perceived Soviet interference in their
 internal affairs and careful to guard their nonaligned
 status.
 With Western-Oriented Nations. The third type of
 arms transfer relationship encompasses countries that
 usually are not sympathetic to the USSR, ideological-
 ly or politically. They have generally turned to Mos-
 cow to score a political point or for a particular
 weapon system that they could not obtain, for political
 or financial reasons, from the West. These countries
 may or may not be in areas of immediate military
 interest to the USSR, and they generally do not
 receive state-of-the-art weapons. Countries in this
 category include Peru, Kuwait, Jordan, and Nigeria.

 The Soviets usually respond to nations of this group
 by offering the desired arms, training, and support on
 good terms. They tend to try to prolong the relation-
 ship by doling out spare parts over an extended period
 Israel's defeat of the Arabs in the 1967 and 1973 wars
 reinforced Iraq's dependence on the USSR. It also
 enabled the Iraqis to acquire more sophisticated
 weapon systems by exploiting Moscow's desire to
 and occasionally offering new equipment.
 In these cases, arms transfers have enabled Moscow
 to build connections with Western-oriented military
 establishments and to expand its presence in countries
 otherwise reluctant to host large numbers of Soviets.
 These recipient regimes, however, still receive most of
 their arms and training from the West, and they
 generally limit their ties with the USSR strictly to the
 military and economic channels associated with the
 arms relationship. The Soviets recognize that they
 risk their relationship with states of this type if they
 use it as a lever.
 Case Studies
 Iraq-A Key Regional Actor. The Iraqis who toppled
 the monarchy and came to power in July 1958 quickly
 turned to Moscow for arms no longer available from
 Western governments unhappy with the vocal radical-
 ism of the new regime. Since then, successive regimes
 have signed more than 40 identified arms agreements
 worth almost $13 billion. These have made Iraq one
 of the top three Third World recipients of Soviet
 arms-and an important source of hard currency for
 the USSR1
 The Iraqis' nationalism and strong anti-Communism
 have always complicated the relationship. During the
 Ba'thists' first brief reign in 1963, for example, they
 executed several members of the Iraqi Communist
 Party (CPI}-and observed Soviet arms deliveries
 ceased, although it is possible that a few deliveries
 continued. The Soviets did not, however, allow the
 troubles of the CPI to become a major source of
 tension. In 1966 they made Iraq the first Arab
 country to receive supersonic aircraft by delivering
 MIG-21s. This was probably an effort to court the
 regime by offsetting French sales of Mirage III
 fighters to Israel, and it illustrated a new pattern in
 Soviet arms transfers to the Middle East: keeping a
 potential client happy by providing sophisticated
 arms.
 demonstrate its credibility as an arms supplier.
 The need for inexpensive military equipment to fight 25X1
 the Iraqi Kurds and to offset Iran's military superior-
 ity led Baghdad to sign a friendship and cooperation
 treaty with Moscow in 1972 and accept two members
 of the CPI in the cabinet in 1973. In 1973 Iraq also
 granted the USSR contracts in oil development and
 some access to the ports of Umm Qasr and Al Basrah
 for ship replenishment.
 In 1975 Baghdad began to use its cash from higher oil
 prices to purchase military equipment from the West,
 primarily from France. To restore his country's wan-
 ing influence, Premier Kosygin visited Baghdad in
 1976, and shortly thereafter Iraq signed a $4 billion
 agreement for Soviet arms.
 This large arms agreement did not prevent a deterio-
 ration in political relations. Iraq opposed Soviet and
 Cuban involvement in Ethiopia in 1977 and the
 Marxist coup in Afghanistan in 1978. Saddam
 Husayn again cracked down on the CPI in 1978, and
 the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan at the end of 1979
 strengthened Iraqi suspicion of Moscow's intentions in
 the region. Nevertheless, in 1979 Iraq and the USSR
 concluded a $2 billion arms sales agreement.
 In the early days of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980,
 Moscow cut off direct arms shipments to both sides, 25X1
 ostensibly claiming a neutral position. Because Soviet
 arms deliveries to Iran had been negligible, the em-
 bargo reflected Soviet opposition to Iraq's invasion as
 well as efforts to curry favor with Iran.
 This brought Soviet-Iraqi relations to a new low,
 without producing closer ties in Tehran. Finding the

 embargo counterproductive, the Soviets lifted it in
 1981 and eventually delivered arms worth over $1
 billion to Iraq. A new $3 billion agreement was signed
 in 1982 and another, for $2 billion, in 1984.
 The war has prolonged Iraq's dependence on Soviet
 arms, despite Baghdad's efforts to diversify. The
 USSR still provides two-thirds of Baghdad's military
 equipment-a relationship that may account for the
 Iraqis' abstention from the UN votes on Afghanistan
 beginning in 1983 and their silence on the downing of
 the Korean airliner
 The improvement in political relations notwithstand-
 ing, Baghdad remembers Moscow's 1980-81 embar-
 go, distrusts Soviet intentions, and is well aware of
 Moscow's effort to cultivate Tehran; and Saddam
 Husayn has not eased his repression of the CPI. Once
 the war ends, Baghdad is likely to move to reduce its
 dependence on Soviet arms. The renewal of diplomat-
 ic relations with the United States in November 1984
 indicated that Husayn intends to balance his ties with
 the USSR somewhat.
 In sum, Baghdad has exploited the Soviet desire to
 maintain a position in the Gulf region more success-
 fully than Moscow has exploited Iraqi military needs.
 Iraq has generally been able to buy arms from the
 USSR on terms more favorable than those usually
 available in the West, without conceding its national
 interests or independence. And Moscow has been
 unable to bolster the CPI's influence in the Iraqi
 Government.
 As long as Iran remains adamantly anti-Soviet, Bagh-
 dad probably will continue to receive Soviet weapons
 on favorable terms, as the Soviets seek to preserve
 their existing position. Even if the Soviets respond
 positively to recent Iranian overtures to improve ties,
 Moscow would probably try to protect its relationship
 with Iraq through further arms deals.
 Guinea-A Socialist Dependent. Arms transfers were
 an important part of the rapid expansion of Soviet-
 Guinean relations that occurred in 1959. Isolated
 after France's precipitate withdrawal in 1958 and
 intent on ending his country's dependence on the
 Western economic system, Sekou Toure turned east-
 ward for political, economic, and military support.
 Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev saw that the provi-
 sion of such support could be a means of undermining
 the European powers in Africa, making socialism a
 model for Third World development, and gaining
 support for Soviet foreign policy positions in his
 growing rivalry with China's Mao Tse-tung.
 In March 1959 Czechoslovakia supplied about $1
 million in small arms and armored cars, and in 1960
 the USSR agreed to provide, on favorable terms, $8
 million worth of artillery, radar, armored vehicles,
 and fighter aircraft. The Soviets also brought Guin-
 ean officers to the USSR for training and sent a
 number of military advisers to Conakry. The military
 side of the relationship, however, was overshadowed
 during this period by political cooperation on African
 and Third World issues, by trade, and by economic
 aid; the Soviet Bloc offered almost $100 million in
 credits between 1958 and 1962.
 Both sides grew disillusioned, and ties cooled by late
 1961. With justification, Toure accused the Soviets of
 interfering in Guinea's internal affairs, and he ex-
 pelled the Soviet Ambassador in December. Many
 Guineans also complained about the unsuitability of
 Soviet aid to local conditions and the often high-
 handed behavior of Soviet advisers. In Moscow, opti-
 mism about Guinea's prospects for building socialism
 faded, and doubts about Toure's political reliability
 grew when he applied to the World Bank and IMF for
 economic aid. Soviet economic and military assistance
 fell off sharply; but, because its military equipment
 was almost entirely of Soviet origin, Conakry contin-
 ued to depend on the USSR for spare parts and
 training.
 Bilateral relations improved in the mid-1960s, as
 Toure consolidated his one-man control of Guinean
 politics and his fear of internal and external threats
 led him again to Moscow for military aid. The Soviets
 responded in 1965 by providing $2 million in small
 arms. In 1970 an attack on Conakry by Portuguese-
 backed Guinean exiles reinforced Toure's fears, and

 Moscow sent a small naval patrol in response to his
 appeal. That naval presence grew into the Soviet West
 Africa patrol. In April 1971 the Soviets stepped up
 arms shipments, providing coastal patrol boats, tanks,
 MIG-17 fighters, and antiaircraft guns. In turn, they
 gained access to Conakry's airport for naval recon-
 naissance and military transport flights and to its
 harbor for support of the naval patrol.
 Relations cooled again in 1977. Toure's security fears
 diminished, and he was becoming disenchanted by
 Moscow's unwillingness to provide extensive economic
 aid. He suspended Soviet reconnaissance flight access
 rights and, over the next few years, cut back the
 number of Soviet military advisers.
 The US Embassy in Conakry reports that Moscow
 responded by driving a hard bargain on spare parts,
 demanding payment for items previously supplied on
 concessionary terms. This was probably to indicate its
 unhappiness with Toure's actions and to remind him
 of his military dependence.
 the Soviets tried to tie their continued provision
 of maintenance and spare parts to renewal of access
 for reconnaissance flights. Since that time, they have
 occasionally offered new equipment that would keep
 Guinea dependent and justify their requests for ex-
 panded access to its air and naval facilities.
 Soviet-Guinean relations were cool but correct
 through the death of Toure in March 1984 and the
 military coup that followed. Conakry has not acquired
 any significant new equipment from Moscow since
 1980, but it remains dependent on Soviet ammunition,
 spare parts, training, and advisory support. The new
 leaders have sought increased Western aid and invest-
 ment and, according to State Department sources,
 would like to reduce the Soviet military presence in
 Guinea. However, they probably believe, on the basis
 of their discussions with Washington and Paris, that
 the West is unlikely to provide much new military aid
 on favorable terms and that a continued military
 relationship with the USSR is essential for the armed
 forces.
 In 1968 a coup replaced pro-Western President Fer-
 nando Belaunde Terry with a junta of leftist army
 officers. They nationalized US-owned businesses in
 Peru, opened diplomatic relations with Communist
 nations, and seized several US fishing boats in Lima's
 claimed 200-nautical-mile territorial sea. In 1969
 Washington suspended arms sales and military assis-
 tance, and Lima expelled the US Military Advisory
 Group.
 The junta still faced a number of traditional security
 concerns. Peru's periodic border clashes with Ecuador
 and its irredentist designs on northern Chile kept
 For their part, the Soviets will probably offer new
 equipment occasionally, while providing enough spare
 parts and training to ensure Conakry's continued
 dependence. They may also renew their request for
 reconnaissance flight access, but, as long as they
 believe their present access rights are secure, they
 probably will not devote many more military and
 economic resources to Guinea
 In sum, arms transfers helped Moscow get a foothold
 in Guinea and enabled it to expand its role in         25X1
 Guinea's military to the point that Conakry has no
 realistic alternative to continuing that role. The arms
 relationship enabled the Soviets to gain some access to
 Guinean facilities but was not sufficient to prevent
 Toure from reducing it. The Soviets have been unable
 to establish significant leverage in Guinean political
 and economic life. Toure jealously guarded his politi-   25X1
 cal independence, and the new military government
 has continued his policies of opening Guinea's econo-
 my and moving it toward genuine nonalignment.
 Peru: A Target of Opportunity. Through the early
 1970s, Peru's armed forces were equipped with a          25X1
 variety of US and European arms, and the United          25X1
 States was Lima's primary source of military assis-
 tance. Relations with the United States began to cool
 as early as the mid-1960s, however, when Peru asked
 for the relatively advanced F-5A fighter aircraft to
 modernize its Air Force. For fear of upsetting the       25X1
 military balance in the region, the United States        25X1
 refused to sell them. This caused a strain in relations,
 and the Air Force bought French Mirage 5's instead.

 defense a high priority. With US aid cut off, the
 officers had to turn elsewhere to modernize their
 forces.
 While the Soviets undoubtedly were pleased by this
 turn of events, they remained noncommittal until
 1973. Then they stepped in with offers of quick
 delivery of relatively sophisticated weapons at low
 prices and on easy terms. Peru became the first South
 American country to buy Soviet military equipment,
 with the delivery in 1973 of five MI-8 Hip helicopters
 and 35 T-55 tanks.
 This marked the beginning of an expanding military
 relationship. Soviet military sales to Peru through
 1984 exceeded $1.5 billion. Equipment has included
 fighters, helicopters, tanks, and surface-to-air mis-
 siles, and the agreements have also involved spare
 parts, training for Peruvian military personnel in the
 USSR, and the presence of Soviet advisers and tech-
 nicians in Peru. All the military sales have been for
 credit, with virtually no downpayment, a mere 2- to 5-
 percent interest, and the balance due in 10 to 20
 years.
 Peru now has so much Soviet equipment that it
 depends heavily on Soviet spare parts and mainte-
 nance to sustain vital sectors of its armed forces.
 Nearly one-third of the Air Force's planes and about
 two-thirds of the Army's tanks are Soviet made, and
 both forces rely almost entirely on Soviet-supplied air
 defense equipment. The US Embassy in Lima reports
 that, because of this dependency, the Peruvian mili-
 tary occasionally exerts pressure on the government to
 maintain cordial relations with the USSR. The Navy
 has thus far turned down Soviet offers, and it contin-
 ues to rely on the West for equipment and training.
 Moscow recognizes the value of its arms-linked ties.
 The military has traditionally been the dominant
 voice in determining who governs Peru, intervening
 against civilian regimes it considers inept, ideological-
 ly suspect, or threatening to its own institutional
 interests. Since World War II the military has held
 power itself four times (most recently from 1968 to
 1980), for a total of 22 years.
 Military aid to Peru has yielded some political and
 economic benefits. Since 1971, for example, Moscow
 has been allowed to use Peruvian ports for the logistic
 support and maintenance of its 200 fishing vessels
 operating off the coast of South America. More
 important, Peru is a foothold in South America. The
 Soviets in Lima have identified the Bolivian and
 Argentine military attaches as priority targets for
 cultivation. The US Embassy indicates that there are
 350 Soviets in Peru-far more than are needed for
 normal diplomatic relations-and that 150 of them
 are military advisers.
 On the other hand, Peru's armed forces have been
 dissatisfied with Soviet logistic support for the equip-
 ment provided.                       mainte-
 nance is a serious problem because spare parts are
 unavailable and repairs are slow. Aircraft reportedly
 are unflyable for months while they await servicing.
 Lima is trying-apparently with little success-to
 reduce this dependence by replacing Soviet with
 Peruvian technicians. It is also trying to diversify its
 sources of military aid: last year it negotiated an
 agreement with France for the purchase of 26 Mirage
 2000 fighters. The poor state of the Peruvian econo-
 my, however, probably will limit Lima's freedom of
 maneuver.
 Moscow gained its foothold in the Peruvian military
 largely through attractive financing terms and prom-
 ises of quick delivery, and it apparently is taking steps
 to protect that foothold.
 the USSR has agreed (in 1984) to refinance Lima's
 military debt, is increasing its efforts to provide
 equipment and training to all three services, and
 probably will continue to offer attractive financing
 terms. A new agreement signed last summer appar-
 ently ensured the military that spare parts would be
 forthcoming

 Management of Arms Transfers
 to the Third World
 Arms transfers to the Third World are instruments of
 Soviet foreign and military policies and also have an
 impact on the Soviet economy. They therefore con-
 cern the highest levels of the party, government, and
 military establishments. They include sales and grants
 of arms and military equipment, supply of spare parts
 and munitions, training and technical assistance, and,
 recently, support for Third World arms industries. F_
 Determining Policy
 The Politburo establishes arms transfer policy and
 reviews transfer proposals that have significant politi-
 cal and strategic implications or that would have a
 substantial impact on the Soviet economy. The Polit-
 buro is advised by: the Ministry of Defense on the
 military significance of the proposed transfer; the
 Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade' on
 foreign policy implications; the Council of Ministers,
 and particularly the Military-Industrial Commission
 and State Planning Committee, on the economic
 impact, especially for defense industries; and the
 Commission for CEMA Affairs on coordination of
 CEMA-wide deliveries. These organizations consider
 whether to provide military assistance to a country,
 the magnitude of the support, and what types of
 weapons should be included. They also make recom-
 mendations on various aspects of the terms of trade,
 such as the amount of subsidy, timing of deliveries,
 and terms of payment. If a military assistance agree-
 ment is already in effect, the Ministry of Defense,
 working with other government organizations, is given
 latitude to interpret and administer policy for limited

 cash sales or for unsophisticated equipment.
 Major transfer proposals are considered when they  25X1
 arise, but also are reviewed by the Politburo and
 Council of Ministers in the annual and five-year
 defense and economic plans. As a result of the long-
 term commitment and advance planning, the Soviets
 are a fairly reliable supplier of weapons. Some flexi-
 bility to deal with unanticipated arms exports is built

 The Tenth Main Directorate of the General Staff
 oversees the entire foreign military assistance pro-
 gram. Its senior officers participate in general policy
 discussions on major prospective agreements. They
 are supported by staff analyses of the military, politi-
 cal, and economic situation of the potential recipient
 country. Directorate personnel prepare the annual and
 five-year military aid plans, which become part of the
 defense component of the national annual and five-
 year plans
 The Directorate oversees and monitors the delivery of
 weapons and equipment and selects and trains foreign
 nationals in Soviet military schools. It can also be-
 come involved in the later stages and details of the
 management of arms transfers, such as the delivery of
 spare parts, financial arrangements, and supply prob-
 lems. The Directorate is instrumental in providing
 quick-reaction assistance and resupply, exemplified
 by its role in supplying arms to India in 1971 and to
 Egypt during the 1967 and 1973 Middle East wars.
 The Tenth Main Directorate controls military assis-
 tance groups in foreign countries, a vital mechanism
 for influencing the client. These groups train clients in
 the use and maintenance of weapons and equipment
 and in a few cases also provide command and control
 support. They include both military advisers and
 military technical specialists:

 forces and advise on the deployment of military
 equipment. In Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and Angola,

 volved in guiding military operations.

 ? Military specialists train troops in the use and
 maintenance of weapons and equipment. They gen-

 The State Committee for Foreign Economic Rela-
 tions administers all Soviet economic and technical
 assistance agreements-including military exports.
 Two sections within the GKES handle all military
 aid: the Chief Engineering Directorate (GIU) for
 weapons and other military equipment, and the Chief
 Technical Directorate (GTU) for military construc-
 tion. These organizations negotiate and administer
 contracts for training personnel in the operation of
 equipment. They also handle supplemental purchase
 contracts for additional equipment, spare parts, or
 services.
 Establishing Agreements
 Establishing an arms transfer agreement is normally a
 long, multistaged process. It usually takes a year to
 complete negotiations and sign the contracts. The
 need to await Politburo decisions at almost every
 stage is the major source of delay. The Soviets then
 require 12 to 24 months for production and delivery.
 Thus, a prospective recipient of Soviet arms would
 normally have to project requirements some three
 years in advance. The Soviets do, however, speed the
 entire process in special situations, for example, when
 an important client country is engaged in a conflict
 (see inset).
 Exploratory Phase. After receiving a request from a
 prospective foreign client or a proposal from the
 Soviet leadership, the Tenth Main Directorate pre-
 pares a Feasibility Report, which includes an exten-
 sive military, political, and economic analysis of the
 prospective recipient, including background on prior
 military assistance provided, the extent of non-Soviet
 military aid received, price data, and the customer's
 repayment record. The GIU provides to the Tenth
 Main Directorate all necessary financial information
 and detailed contract data.

 Soviet Rapid Responses in Crisis Situations
 Syria-1982
 The Soviets substantially increased their military
 commitment to Syria within seven months of Israel's
 defeat of Soviet-equipped Syrian forces in Lebanon in
 June 1982. They sent more SA-8 surface-to-air mis-
 siles and introduced the SA-5 system, the most
 advanced model of the MIG-23 interceptor, and
 several hundred military advisers and technicians.
 Ethiopia-1977
 During the Ethiopian-Somali conflict, the USSR
 initially supplied arms to both sides. As hostilities
 increased during the summer of 1977, the USSR
 began to lean toward the Ethiopian side. In mid-
 October the Soviets ceased arms shipments to Soma-
 lia. In late November 1977, a massive Soviet airlift of
 arms to Ethiopia was launched. By early December
 1977 approximately 400 Soviet military advisers
 were in Ethiopia and another 900 or more were
 scheduled to arrive. Throughout December and Janu-
 ary, Soviet arms-including MIG-21s, trucks, tanks,
 and small arms poured into Ethiopia. By March
 1978 the rearmed Ethiopian forces had crushed the
 Somali offensive. The speed and extent of Soviet and
 Cuban military assistance was the decisive difference.
 Negotiating Phase. The negotiation process usually
 begins with a series of discussions primarily political
 in nature. Depending on the country and circum-
 stances, the discussions may include the top Soviet
 leaders; frequently they are led by the Minister of
 Defense. Often political conditions for any military
 aid are set during these discussions. With the satisfac-
 tory resolution of the political discussions, the client's
 request is reviewed by the Politburo, and the USSR
 agrees "in principle" to provide military aid to the
 customer. The client in turn signs a purchase state-
 ment affirming serious interest in obtaining assis-
 tance
 The Politburo forwards the initial agreements to the
 Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Trade,
 Military-Industrial Commission, Gosplan, and other
 organizations to work out the details. The Politburo
 reconsiders the proposal after these inputs are re-
 ceived and an official Soviet position is developed.
 Procedural negotiations at the working levels cover
 the terms of the General Agreement, laying out the
 nature of the assistance, administrative aspects of the
 project, and the extent of credit. After the General
 Agreement is approved in draft by the Politburo, the
 customer is usually given only one or two days to
 25X1
 25X1
 The Project Requirements Document of the General
 Agreement states what services and equipment are to
 be offered by the USSR. The document is developed
 from the feasibility report, the customer's request,
 and field studies made by officers from the military
 services involved in the aid project. The document is
 assembled by the Tenth Main Directorate with a
 minimum of civilian input and submitted via the
 Minister of Defense to the Politburo for final approv-  25X1
 al. The document then is presented to the client, who
 is allowed 60 to 90 days for a written response.
 Purchase Contracts. The actual purchase of weapons,
 equipment, and services is covered by a separate    25X1
 purchase contract, usually negotiated along with the
 General Agreement or as a supplement to an existing
 General Agreement.
 25X1
 Contract Management. Once a General Agreement
 has been signed, the Foreign Trade Bank (Vneshtorg-
 bank) opens a special credit account for use only as
 specified in the Agreement. For each contract, a
 portion of the credit is set aside for spare parts and
 ammunition; however, additional spare parts and
 ammunition must be purchased through separate
 contracts.

 Organization of Arms Production for Export
 In many cases the Soviets have not exported weapon
 systems until they have been in Soviet inventories
 eight to 10 years. Although this practice is changing
 and the percentage of new systems being exported has
 been growing in the last 10 years, older weapons have
 proved highly marketable to Third World countries.
 Their relatively low cost and simplicity are compati-
 ble with the resources, tactics, and support capabili-
 ties of Third World military services.
 The concentration on these older models for export
 has influenced the organization and scheduling of
 weapons production. Although most weapons for ex-
 port are manufactured concurrently with domestic
 production, the Soviets have serviced many export
 obligations by dedicating entire production lines and
 runs to the export variant. In extreme cases, the
 demand has warranted temporarily dedicating all or
 most of a plant to export production:
 ? The Omsk Tank Plant produced T-55s at least
 until the late 1970s, long after Soviet forces began
 receiving more modern systems.
 ? In the 1960s Moscow Airframe Plant 30 produced
 MIG-21 s for export while preparing for production
 of the MIG-23.
 ? Arsenyev Airframe Plant 116 currently exports
 most of the SS-N-2 Styx cruise missiles it
 produces.
 ? Rybinsk Shipyard 341 produces minor surface
 combatants almost entirely for export, while other
 shipyards produce the same vessels for Soviet cus-
 tomers.
 The GKES implements the purchase contract within
 the terms of the General Agreement, overseeing the
 relationship between foreign customers and Soviet
 industrial ministries and plants and ensuring that
 production meets delivery obligations (see inset). It
 arranges for the assignment and transportation of
 specialists to support aid contracts and for the trans-
 fer of the client's personnel to the USSR for training.
 GIU and GTU representatives are the liaison with the
 client in all matters, negotiating supplements to exist-
 ing contracts, conveying client complaints, and han-
 dling any disciplinary problems that involve Soviet
 specialists in the host country.
 Producing for export at the end of a production run
 facilitates scheduling and eliminates the need for
 frequent changes in equipment, tooling, and material
 supply to accommodate any differences in the design
 of an export variant. It also extends the production
 run, increasing the benefits of having mastered the
 design and production process. Plant managers some-
 times are allowed to use a portion of hard currency
 earned to purchase foreign manufacturing equipment.
 Staying competitive in Third World arms markets,
 however, is complicating the export business for
 Soviet defense industry. Countries like India are
 demanding state-of-the-art hardware, such as the
 MIG-29, requiring Soviet plants to produce concur-
 rently for Soviet and foreign military services. Ex-
 porting more sophisticated weapons also means es-
 tablishing a more complex training and logistic
 support pipeline. Some countries-again India is
 preeminent-are purchasing licenses to produce Sovi-
 et weapons. This obligates Soviet plants to transfer
 and install equipment and tooling, train indigenous
 managers and laborers, and provide ongoing material
 support and technical consultation. Soviet industry
 has little experience in nurturing Third World de-
 fense industrial development. It is not clear to what
 degree these more aggressive moves to provide a
 broader array of arms transfer services will become a
 part of Soviet international arms dealings.
 Implications
 The authority of the Tenth Main Directorate in
 overseeing the arms transfer program enables the
 military to exercise influence over a crucial dimension
 of Soviet foreign policy, the national economy, and
 particularly the defense industry. This directorate and
 the GKES nevertheless share responsibilities, and
 conflicts often arise between them. This could reflect
 conflicts between policymakers who use the different

 organizations to support their positions on arms trans-
 fers.
 The Soviet process for implementing arms transfers
 takes considerable time and can constrain both Soviet
 and client flexibility to respond to fluctuating mili-
 tary, political, or economic conditions. As previously
 shown, the Soviets can and have responded rapidly
 and flexibly in a number of cases, but quick responses
 cause dislocations in defense industries and weapon
 stockpiles. Overall, Soviet central planning and the
 long leadtimes for production of arms exports work to
 make the management of the arms transfer program
 slow and deliberate.
 On the other hand, Politburo approval constitutes a
 national commitment, which makes the Soviets a
 fairly dependable source of weapons. It allows them to
 provide weapons, equipment, and training on a pre-
 dictable schedule. It facilitates the manipulation of
 sales and credit terms to break into new markets,
 retain old ones, and promote client dependency. De-
 pendency, in turn, affords the Soviets some latitude in
 changing negotiated agreements without bringing
 these changes to the clients' attention. A number of
 clients contend that the Soviets exploit the entire
 process, at least partly offsetting the advantage of a
 quick and firm Soviet commitment.

 The Soviet Hind Helicopter:
 Prospects for Exports
 The MI-24 Hind helicopter is the Soviet entry in one
 of the most active sectors of the international arms
 market-attack helicopters. Third World countries
 are seeking armed helicopters for antitank and anti-
 personnel missions in conventional warfare and
 counterinsurgency operations. Moscow has delivered
 as many as 390 Hinds to 14 Third World countries
 since 1978. The helicopter's operational shortcomings
 could limit additional sales over the long term, partic-
 ularly to new customers. Nonetheless, involvement of
 Soviet customers in conventional conflicts and coun-
 terinsurgencies plus favorable financial terms from
 the USSR will ensure a substantial number of addi-
 tional Hind sales, mostly to countries already possess-
 ing the system.
 Hind Missions and Capabilities
 The MI-24 Hind (and its export model, the MI-25) is
 a large attack helicopter about the size of the stan-
 dard Soviet transport helicopter, the MI-8 Hip. It has
 a higher airspeed than the Hip, armor for the cockpit
 and other components, and formidable armament that
 can include either a four-barrel 12.7-mm Gatling gun
 or a fixed twin-barrel 23-mm cannon plus rockets,
 bombs, and antitank guided missiles. Its ability to
 deliver a high volume of gun and rocket fire makes it
 a potent counterinsurgency weapon. The Hind differs
 from Western attack helicopters in that it has a small
 cargo- or troop-carrying bay that, along with its
 rugged fuselage, large engines, and heavy armor and
 ordnance, makes it the largest attack helicopter in the
 world.
 Hinds exported to the Third World are externally
 similar to those provided to Soviet forces except that
 they carry an older antitank guided missile and fire-
 control system. A few of the advanced systems that
 may be carried by Hinds in Soviet forces-for exam-
 ple, low-light-level television for night operations-
 almost certainly have not been exported. The Hind's
 laser rangefinders probably have been exported, since
 similar equipment is contained in other Soviet aircraft
 sold outside the Warsaw Pact.
 The Soviets have exported about 15 percent of the
 Hinds they have built so far despite a competing
 requirement for attack helicopters to fulfill three
 missions within their own forces: escort and support of
 heliborne or airmobile assault operations, close air
 support for armor and mechanized infantry forces,
 and operations in rugged and remote areas such as
 along the Sino-Soviet border. The invasion of Afghan-
 istan in 1979 gave the MI-24 an important counter-
 insurgency mission as well.
 Soviet Motivations
 The Soviets have evidently exported the Hind to
 expand their arms relationships with the USSR's
 traditional arms customers, some of which are among
 Moscow's best sources of hard currency. This consid-
 eration may have been particularly important in the
 cases of Iraq and Syria, which continue to buy attack
 helicopters of West European origin as well as Hinds.
 An additional incentive in the case of Peru probably
 was the desire to make Peru into a showcase of
 advanced Soviet military hardware that would attract
 other Latin American customers.

 Afghanistan
 Vietnam
 Most of the initial purchasers of the Hind apparently
 sought it for use in conventional roles rather than in
 counterinsurgencies or unconventional warfare. The
 first three purchasers-Algeria, Iraq, and Libya-
 deploy most of their Hinds opposite unfriendly neigh-
 bors, although Libya has used small numbers in
 Chad, and Iraq has used them against the Kurds.
 India, Peru, South Yemen, Syria, and Vietnam also
 purchased Hinds primarily for conventional warfare
 against traditional enemies. Peru, to our knowledge,
 has not used its Hinds in its counterinsurgency
 against the Sendero Luminoso; and Vietnam, which
 has had Hinds since 1980, only last year began to use
 them in a limited way in Cambodia.
 About 1979, Moscow also began exporting the Hind
 to support counterinsurgency efforts. The Soviets
 found themselves committed to helping suppress in-
 surgencies in several client states, including Angola,
 Ethiopia, Mozambique, Afghanistan, and, most re-
 cently, Nicaragua. All of these countries are using
 Hinds, or are likely to use them, primarily against
 insurgents. In addition, Cuba probably uses its Hinds
 primarily to train pilots that it sends to these coun-
 tries. Moscow probably provided Hinds in these cases

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/30: CIA-RDP88T00799R000200030003-5
 not only to nurture arms relationships but also to
 support its objective of maintaining socialist regimes
 in these countries. Several of these Hind recipients
 have very little ability to pay for complex arms,
 suggesting that in these cases Moscow believes the
 political benefits outweigh the economic costs.
 Combat Performance
 The success of the Hind as an export will depend in
 part on its combat record. It has seen heavy action in
 Afghanistan and in the Iran-Iraq war and smaller
 scale use in Angola, Ethiopia, Cambodia, and Chad.
 These actions have revealed both strengths and weak-
 nesses in the system.
 The most commonly praised feature of the Hind is its
 armament. The volume and precision of its fire have
 reportedly made it the most feared weapon in Afghan-
 istan.
 The main problem with the Hind, according to Third
 World observers, is its size, which makes it an easy
 target for air defenses. It lacks the thin silhouette of
 some Western helicopters, notably the Cobra. Al-
 though the cockpit is well armored, there are large
 areas on the aircraft, including parts of the cargo bay
 and the tail boom, which are unprotected and which
 contain vital hydraulic lines and control surfaces. In
 Afghanistan the Hind's worst enemy has been the
 heavy machinegun, especially when the helicopter
 operates in valleys where rebel gunners can fire on it
 from above. Afghan insurgents have also scored hits
 with shoulder-launched SA-7s

 of even modest air defenses has forced Hinds to fly
 higher and minimize their on-target time, reducing
 their overall effectiveness. The Hind has also been
 criticized for its lack of agility (a result of its large     25X1
 Market Experience
 The Hind has been sold mainly to customers that
 traditionally have bought large numbers of helicopters
 from the USSR. It has not proved successful in
 opening new Third World markets for the Soviets.              25X1
 countries more closely aligned with the West.(
 Many countries that operate small numbers of Soviet
 MI-8 Hips, like Congo, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali,
 and Zambia, have not purchased the Hind, probably
 because most of them do not need to counter insur-
 gencies, are unable to pay, and are wary of the
 Soviets-in part because of experiences in earlier
 deals. For its part, Moscow may be unwilling to sell to
 terms.
 Mo-
 zambique and Nicaragua, Hind recipients that had
 not previously been important Soviet helicopter cus-
 tomers, are special cases. Both are fighting for surviv-
 al against insurgencies and are isolated from Western
 suppliers-Nicaragua for political reasons and Mo-
 zambique by an inability to afford Western payment
 Moreover, the Hind lacks what is normally one of the
 most attractive features of Soviet equipment-a low
 price. In the case of large cargo helicopters, the Soviet
 asking price for the MI-17 is about $2.8 million, while
 Western manufacturers were recently asking over $6
 million for somewhat smaller models. In the attack
 helicopter market, however, the top of the Western
 line, the US Cobra, is now being sold to Jordan for
 $3.3 million and to Pakistan for $5.2 million each
 (prices that probably exclude some avionics and arma-
 ment)
 Although such figures must be
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/30: CIA-RDP88T00799R000200030003-5
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/30: CIA-RDP88T00799R000200030003-5
 regarded as approximate, the Hind clearly does not
 have a decisive price advantage over Western attack
 helicopters. In addition, a country that cannot afford
 an aircraft like the Cobra can turn to any of several
 much smaller Western helicopters, which are cheaper
 than the Hind and better in some ways, notably in
 maneuverability. The main advantage of the Hind for
 a poor country is that in a benign air defense environ-
 ment it can be used for utility as well as attack
 purposes.
 Prospects
 The Hind is likely to continue to help Moscow
 reinforce arms supply relationships it has already
 established. Some current Hind customers are likely
 to make additional large purchases because the sys-
 tem has an established place in their forces. The
 Soviets also may offer attractive financial terms to
 mitigate the noncompetitive price of the Hind. Others,
 like Syria and Iraq, are showing increasing interest in
 Western helicopters as combat weaknesses in the
 Hind become apparent, but they will probably contin-
 ue to buy some Hinds to maintain their fleets. So far,
 however, the Hind has not proved attractive to coun-
 tries that are not in some way already tied to the
 Soviets.
 The Soviets currently have in the late stages of
 development two attack helicopters, the Havoc
 (MI-28) and the Hokum (a Kamov product). Design
 improvements, advances in key subsystems, and the
 absence of a cargo bay should make them more
 capable in attack missions than the multirole Hind.
 Production rates for the new models, however, are
 likely to be slower than for the Hind because of the
 use of advanced technology and more exacting manu-
 facturing procedures. We therefore expect the new
 models to augment, rather than totally replace, the
 Hind in Soviet forces. Moscow is likely to export one
 or both of its new attack helicopters to preferred
 customers within a few years of their entry into Soviet
 service, as it has done recently with some other
 advanced systems, but we expect the Hind to remain
 the main Soviet export attack helicopter at least
 through the end of this decade.
 Implications
 Moscow's experience with the Hind suggests that the
 Soviets will have to overcome several problems if they
 wish to retain or improve their position in the highly
 competitive world arms market. The failure to sell the
 Hind outside a select circle of traditional customers in
 large part reflects Moscow's traditional lack of ag-
 gressive marketing of military equipment. Unlike the
 Soviet civil aircraft exporter, Aviaexport, which has
 recently conducted demonstration flights of the AN-
 32 transport aircraft in much of the Third World, the
 military exporters (notably the Tenth Main Director-
 ate) apparently wait for customers to come to it. This
 probably results from Soviet reluctance to sell mili-
 tary equipment to countries in which technical details
 might be compromised. If Moscow persists in selling
 advanced military equipment only to countries with
 which it already has reliable political relations, how-
 ever, it is unlikely to enlarge its circle of arms
 customers much further. Such a policy would also
 reduce Soviet ability to use arms sales to open the way
 to political influence.
 Even among its traditional arms customers, Moscow
 will almost certainly find itself under increasing pres-
 sure to provide even more recent technology. If Mos-
 cow procrastinates on exporting new models, some
 customers could be tempted by highly competitive
 Western equipment. The Hind experience suggests
 that Moscow can rise to this challenge, although the
 expected lower production rates for newer Soviet
 equipment may make the export decision more diffi-
 cult in the late 1980s than in the 1970s. In addition,
 the fact that Moscow still has not exported Hinds
 with its latest missile or fire-control systems suggests
 that it may try, at least initially, to withhold a few of
 its most advanced subsystems from even its best
 customers.

 Short-Term Outlook
 Posting its first annual decline since World War II,
 production of Soviet crude oil and gas condensate
 slipped to 12.23 million barrels per day (b/d) in 1984.
 The decline-by 100,000 b/d-from the rate in 1983
 reflects a host of problems associated with the ad-
 vanced age of most of the USSR's largest oilfields,
 and it may continue. With West Siberian oil produc-
 tion stagnant or possibly declining and output in other
 regions falling, a nationwide decline of about 200,000
 to 300,000 b/d is possible this year. If it occurs, the
 Soviets might have to cut back their net exports for
 hard currency if they are to satisfy domestic oil
 requirements and maintain their exports to Eastern
 Europe.
 The Soviet leaders recently implemented a series of
 personnel and administrative changes that reflect
 distress over the oil industry's problems. A large
 number of production managers in West Siberia were
 fired, and Nikolay Mal'tsev was replaced as Petro-
 leum Industry Minister by Vasiliy Dinkov, who as
 Minister of the Gas Industry scored notable successes
 in the rapid development of West Siberian natural gas
 production. Vladimir Filanovskiy-Zenkov, chief of the
 oil and gas section of the State Planning Committee
 (Gosplan), will be Dinkov's new deputy. No new
 combination of administrators, however, is likely to
 restore growth in oil output.
 Background
 Soviet oil production soared for three decades-from
 750,000 b/d in 1950 to a record 12.33 million b/d in
 1983 (figure 1). The ready availability of oil in turn
 prompted a massive conversion of Soviet industrial
 facilities from coal to oil.

 The period was characterized by annual production
 increments of generally increasing size until 1975,
 after which growth tapered off (figure 2). Oil output
 reached 12.03 million b/d in 1980 and inched up to
 the 12.33 million b/d posted in 1983.

 In 1984, production in West Siberia's Tyumen' Oblast
 increased by only 140,000 b/d-about 200,000 b/d
 less than the planned increment. This was too little to
 cover the declines in oil output elsewhere in the
 USSR, let alone provide for any net growth in oil
 output nationwide. The overall result was the drop of
 100,000 b/d.
 High-Level Concern
 The slowdown in the growth of Tyumen' production
 and the region's below-plan performance in 1983 and
 1984 caused consternation in Moscow and brought
 West Siberian operations under high-level scrutiny. In
 late 1983, leading officials from Gosplan, the oil
 ministry, and the Communist Party mounted an on-
 site investigation, according to the Soviet press. Early
 in 1984 the depth of leadership concern was shown by
 the assignment of a deputy oil minister as chief of oil
 operations in Tyumen'. The continuing dissatisfaction
 culminated in the firing of most of the managers of
 the region's production associations late in the year
 and the replacement of Mal'tsev in February 1985.
 Several news articles indicate that, in an unprecedent-
 ed move to improve efficiency, two major organiza-
 tions that control oil operations in the European
 USSR have been given responsibility for three West
 Siberian production directorates.
 In a parallel effort, the party apparatus is focusing on
 mobilizing Tyumen' workers to meet oil and gas
 production plans. Vladimir Dolgikh (candidate mem-
 ber of the Politburo and party secretary concerned
 with energy matters and Siberian development) has
 cited poor management as a basic problem. Oil
 officials, he said, had failed to foresee the growing
 requirements for artificial lift and to provide for
 adequate maintenance and logistic services. Dolgikh
 attributed part of the failure to laxity on the part of
 local party units and called upon party members to
 coordinate their activities more effectively.
 Problems in Tyumen'
 The most serious technical problems affecting Tyu-
 men' oil production are occurring in the production
 associations that manage Samotlor and Federovo, two
 of the largest oilfields in the USSR. Difficulties are
 accumulating, especially those associated with water
 injection systems and the sharply rising water content
 of fluid recovered from producing wells. Samotlor's
 pressure-maintenance and oil-gathering systems, for
 example, have severe corrosion problems. The oil flow
 lines leak, and the lines for the waterflood system are
 so corroded that full pressure cannot be maintained.
 With the average water-cut (the percentage of water
 in the fluid produced from oil wells) estimated to
 exceed 50 percent, oil production is declining at both
 fields.
 Bright expectations for a newly developed area north
 of Fedorovo apparently have dimmed. Soviet press
 articles cited serious production shortfalls and report-
 ed that some newly drilled wells were not flowing.
 Many wells at the Sutorminsk field have been
 switched over to pumps far earlier than was envisaged
 in the original development plan. If the reservoir
 characteristics in nearby oil deposits resemble those at
 Sutorminsk, oil extraction from the whole new area
 may require more wells, equipment, manpower, and
 time than the planners anticipated.

 What Went Wrong
 The shortfall in West Siberian production can be
 traced in part to overoptimism: the quality of the
 newly exploited reserves has not met official expecta-
 tions. Another factor is the failure of Soviet industry
 to supply pumps and other oilfield equipment in
 adequate quantity and quality. As a consequence,
 Soviet planners and oil industry leaders are falling
 behind in the race against rising investment and
 manpower requirements.
 Lower Well Flows
 Last April a Pravda article commented that many
 Soviet oil wells had stopped flowing naturally, and the
 oil now had to be "extracted," literally-pulled out of
 the ground. To do this, the article added, the produc-
 tion associations had to have special equipment
 (pumps, workover rigs, and tools) in amounts and
 kinds that they were not receiving. The situation is
 particularly serious in Tyumen', where some of the
 new wells will not flow. Moreover, according to oil
 industry officials and some Soviet geologists, recent
 experience shows that the initial Soviet reserve esti-
 mates for the Tyumen' oilfields were exaggerated and
 the estimated recovery rates were too high.
 When Soviet oil industry planners and managers
 continue to use such estimates (which understate the
 difficulty of reaching production goals) as a basis for
 ordering equipment and allocating manpower, pro-
 duction shortfalls are inevitable. The original plan-
 ning error is then exacerbated by frequent failures in
 equipment, electricity supply, and logistic support.
 Rising Requirements for Investment and Manpower
 Since 1980, high-ranking Gosplan officials have
 pointed out the alarming decline in the average flow
 of new wells-from 1,183 b/d in 1975 to 518 b/d in
 1980 and an estimated 277 b/d in 1981-85. In late
 1982, Oil Minister Mal'tsev illustrated the problem
 by pointing out that, to achieve a 20,000-b/d increase
 in oil production (allowing for normal depletion rates),
 the USSR had drilled 265,000 meters of wells in 1970
 and 866,000 meters in 1980, but would have to drill 7
 million meters of wells in 1985.
 Siberia have been in operation for 12 to 15 years.
 Giant fields play a vital role in maintaining steady
 growth in total output even though their production
 slows down after a decade or so of exploitation. As oil
 is extracted, the natural reservoir pressure declines,
 reservoir permeability tends to decrease, and the
 water-cut increases markedly. These changes speed
 up the use of artificial lift, and pumps break down
 more frequently because of corrosion and the buildup
 of salts in the well bore.
 Such conditions multiply the requirements for well
 maintenance. Tyumen', however, reported a shortage
 of 100 workover crews in 1984. Furthermore, in the
 hostile Tyumen' environment each workover crew is
 expected to maintain 55 to 85 wells scattered over
 difficult terrain, whereas in the mild climate of Baku
 a single crew looks after 29 wells. The lack of
 appropriate maintenance in West Siberia results in
 idle wells and lower production there.
 ber 1984, according to Izvestiya, the administration's
 investment allocation was reduced for unspecified

 25X1
 Oil production planning is fraught with uncertainty  25X1
 even under the best of circumstances. It appears,
 however, that Soviet planners have repeatedly missed
 windows of opportunity for timely and efficient acqui- 25X1
 sition and use of equipment. A glaring example of
 ineptitude was reported by Izvestiya last April. In
 1980 the Tyumen' oil administration submitted a
 1985 production goal of 6.8 million b/d, using this
 figure as the basis for its equipment orders and
 investment plans. Moscow raised the goal to 7.5-7.6
 million b/d but did not allocate additional funds,
 equipment, or manpower. On the contrary, in Decem-
 reasons.
 Outlook
 Soviet oil output in 1985 probably will be well below
 the planned 12.56 million b/d-it may not even
 match the 12.23 million b/d posted in 1984. We base
 this conclusion on the recent production record and on
 Soviet media evidence of continuing difficulties. Daily
 oil production in the first quarter of 1985 was 11.92
 million barrels, a figure well below the planned level
 and 300,000 b/d below the average production level   25X1
 A fundamental factor underlying many of the oil
 industry's production problems is the increasing age
 of the oilfields. The dozen largest fields in West

 achieved in 1984. With oil production in the key West
 Siberian region growing less rapidly-and possibly
 flattening out or even declining-we estimate that a
 further decline nationwide is possible this year. Ef-
 forts to check the decline will become progressively
 more costly in terms of manpower and investment
 resources.
 In the longer run, the USSR will have to reconsider
 its Long-Term Energy Program, which postulates that
 nationwide production of crude oil and gas condensate
 will hold steady at a high level through the end of the
 century. Given the situation in West Siberia, the
 leaders may find that to carry out these plans they
 would have to divert to the oil sector an unacceptably
 large share of national investment.
 Last year, Moscow was apparently able to raise
 exports by increasing reexports of OPEC oil, trim-
 ming domestic consumption, and drawing down do-
 mestic stocks. If production shortfalls are larger in
 1985, Moscow may be unable to satisfy domestic oil
 requirements and maintain exports to Eastern Europe
 without some cutbacks in net exports for hard curren-
 cy. The Soviets have sold very little oil on the spot
 market since January, and they suspended shipments
 to many West European and Japanese customers in
 February and March. Some exports were reported in
 late March, but at a slightly lower level than a year
 ago. Whether the Soviets will be able to maintain or
 increase sales during the rest of the year is unclear at
 this time

 The Soviet Tank Industry:
 Modernization for the 1990s
 The USSR, driven by the need to build tanks with
 increasingly expensive and complex components and
 subassemblies, has undertaken sweeping changes in
 the production methods of its tank industry over the
 past decade. Overall production of tanks has declined,
 while the industry's plant and equipment holdings
 have grown dramatically. This modernization will
 enable the Soviets to produce increasingly sophisticat-
 ed and capable tanks more efficiently.
 The Postwar Tank Industry
 After World War II, the Soviets produced a genera-
 tion of medium battle tanks (the T-54, T-55, and
 T-62) that were simple in design, easily manufac-
 tured, rugged in operation, and that could be operated
 by crewmen with limited mechanical training. Large-
 scale manufacture of these tanks was facilitated by
 the application of traditional Soviet manufacturing
 practices, including the use of proven designs, stan-
 dard, off-the-shelf components and subassemblies,
 and standardized, labor-intensive fabrication meth-
 ods. Institutional continuities in the industry also
 contributed to the ability to manufacture tanks rapid-
 ly and in large numbers. The tank industry has a
 centralized executive structure, stable organizations
 and research teams, and plants that have manufac-
 tured tanks or related equipment for almost half a
 century.
 New tactical requirements and the development in the
 mid-1950s of new tank technologies in the West
 compelled the Soviets to introduce in the mid-1960s a
 radically new tank-the T-64. However, the tank was
 produced using manufacturing technology that was
 little changed from that employed for the previous
 generation, and various production problems were
 encountered.
 During the 1970s, two new tank models and at least
 four variants were introduced, including the T-64A
 and B, the T-72 and its variants, and the T-80. These
 tanks variously incorporate laminated nonhomoge-
 neous armor, advanced fire control, improved diesel
 and gas turbine engines and power trains, variable-
 height suspension systems, and equipment for the use
 of armor-piercing ammunition and tank-fired guided
 missiles-all substantial advances over 1960s-vintage 25X1
 tanks. These more sophisticated components have led
 to a marked growth in cost (see figure 1).
 Modernization
 The incorporation of these new components and sub-
 systems, combined with growing unit costs and pro-
 duction requirements, led the Soviets to modernize
 manufacturing processes throughout the 1970s at    25X1
 their three primary tank assembly plants-in Omsk,
 Kharkov, and Nizhniy Tagil 2-as well as at numer-
 ous component supplier plants.
 The installation of automated equipment will facili-
 tate the manufacture of higher quality components
 and reduce costs. It will enable the Soviet tank

 Note: The procurement costs expressed in this article are estimated in 1982
 dollars and are not actual Soviet expenditures. Dollar cost estimates are
 intended to represent what it would cost the United States to produce the
 Soviet design using US production technology, input prices, and profit
 margins. Dollar cost estimates cannot be used in isolation to draw
 inferences about the relative effectiveness of Soviet equipment or the
 industry to process materials that are harder to shape,
 meet closer component tolerances, and decrease the
 leadtime required to gear up for new tank programs.
 The use of numerically controlled (NC) or computer-
 aided numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools
 drastically reduces materials handling, preparation
 time, setups, machining time, and material consump-
 tion (see table 1)
 Such automated machine tools enable the manufac-
 turer to perform metal-cutting or finishing operations
 with great precision and speed even on complex
 surfaces. A machining center, with its magazine of
 several dozen automatically installed tools, can per-
 form complex machining operations on the same
 workpiece, which would otherwise be done on several
 conventional machines. Thus, CNC machining cen-
 ters with sensors, such as those bought from the
 Italians, will enable the Soviet tank plants to do
 contour milling on tank turrets in three dimensions or
 to switch easily to continuous-path cutting and finish-
 ing on the upper hull. Once a large enough array of
 NC machine tools is integrated into production lines,
 Soviet tank plants will be able to change over quickly
 to machining parts for two or more tank models
 simultaneously, or to shift quickly from one tank
 program to another. This will also enhance Soviet
 industrial mobilization potential in wartime, when
 civilian production is shifted to defense at dual-use
 plants.
 Foreign Machine Tool Acquisitions
 In the mid-1960s the Soviets also began to step up the
 importation of precision industrial equipment from
 the West for the tank industry. We have identified 20
 Soviet acquisitions, including rotary forging equip-
 ment for gun barrels; multiaxis CNC machine tools
 capable of handling very large castings, such as tank
 turrets; presses for the fabrication of steel plates and
 other components; and foundry, mold line, and casting
 shop equipment used in the manufacture of engine
 cylinder block castings           The imported
 equipment has enabled the Soviets to fabricate com-
 ponents more precisely, cheaply, and efficiently. The
 tank industry will probably continue to install West-
 ern equipment, given the lack of high-quality conven-
 tional tools and the relative scarcity of advanced
 manufacturing process technology in the USSR.
 Expansion of Production Capacity
 To accommodate the modern production equipment
 and processes, the Soviets expanded and rebuilt their
 main tank plant facilities. Soviet tank plants histori-
 cally had undertaken new programs using renovated
 facilities or additions to general purpose buildings of
 standard design. In 1971, however, beginning with the
 construction of a new final-assembly building at the
 Kharkov tank plant, the Soviets augmented tradition-
 al expansion with a new approach-designing build-
 ings dedicated specifically to accommodate modern,

 special-purpose tooling and equipment. New produc-
 tion buildings at Omsk and Kharkov now combine
 under one roof administration and engineering, small-
 parts production, the fabrication of large components,
 finishing, and final assembly. These buildings also
 enable the Soviets to use the new equipment properly,
 providing, for example, the more vibration-free envi-
 ronment required by automated precision machine
 tools and the strong foundation needed for the em-
 ployment of overhead cranes with twice the carrying
 capacity of those used previously.
 In addition to the growth of assembly facilities, there
 has been an increase in the size of the outside supplier
 network in the tank industry.
 Tank production has not risen in step with the
 expansion of facilities. We estimate that annual pro-
 duction peaked at 4,500 tanks in 1969-primarily
 because of large-scale serial production of the last of
 the older generation tanks, the T-62, at Nizhniy
 Tagil. Thereafter, total annual production fell, in part
 because the Soviets introduced new and more complex
 tanks. Even production of the T-72, the tank with the
 greatest design inheritance, at Nizhniy Tagil during
 1974-79 fell far short of the maximum annual output
 reached for the T-62. Indeed, we estimate that total
 annual output for all three major tank plants dropped
 as low as 2,100 tanks in 1983 (see figure 2).
 The large-scale changes caused by the construction of
 modern facilities and the refurbishment of others
 along with new methods of production and adminis-
 tration undoubtedly contributed to the slowdown in
 production. Even after new facilities and supplier
 relationships are fully operational, however, the in-
 volved fabrication and assembly requirements of com-
 plex, modern tanks suggest that larger facilities will
 be required to support the previous level of tank
 assembly
 Problems and Outlook
 Despite the advances of the 1970s, the dissemination
 of new technology has been slow, and the Soviet tank
 industry continues to face problems in modernizing.
 The industry is still having difficulty bringing equip-
 ment up to Western standards and securing adequate
 supplies of sophisticated components. For example, in
 the 1970s, grinders, important in armored vehicle
 production, were produced in the USSR in only one

 plant and in small numbers because of the shortage of
 parts, such as spindles and precision bearings. Anoth-
 er example involves gear-cutting machine tools, which
 have not reached the quality of American Gleason
 machines.
 The Soviets also express concern over the slow pace of
 production automation. Emigre sources indicate, for
 example, that welding automation has gone very
 slowly in the tank industry because of the reluctance
 of some plant managers to undertake automation,
 which is seen as too risky. Other reasons include:
 ? The belief that manual welding by skilled welders is
 in some cases better than automated welding.
 ? The unwillingness of plant managers to install spe-
 cific automated systems, including robots, until
 these have been proved in the West.
 ? The absence of welding specialists with automation
 or computer experience.
 ? The shortage of key components for automation,
 including controls, microprocessors, and computers.
 The tank industry also experienced problems in the
 use of Soviet NC machine tools and automated
 welding systems and other equipment-the result of a
 lag in Soviet electronics, unsophisticated control sys-
 tems, problems with hardware and hydraulics, and the
 lack of qualified service personnel and programers.
 We believe uneven progress and resistance to innova-
 tion will impede Soviet efforts to modernize the
 industry.
 fully.
 The expansion of the vendor network in the tank
 industry has brought additional problems. Frequently,
 suppliers do not meet production quotas, and, from
 time to time, parts and materials required at the main
 tank plants are in short supply. The maintenance of
 quality control over vendor parts also poses a problem.
 Sometimes vendors themselves struggle with upgrad-
 ing their own production processes and cannot meet
 production schedules or quality requirements success-
 The upgraded, concentrated tank assembly backed by
 a large network of specialized component manufac-
 turers should produce savings that will partly offset
 rising costs. We believe that plant modernization will
 continue into the 1990s, based in part on acquisition
 of Western equipment. The versatility and production
 flexibilities inherent in the new facilities and equip-
 ment should afford greater possibilities for converting
 existing plants and lines to support new programs,
 rather than constructing entirely new dedicated facili-
 ties. Thus, the heavy initial outlays generated in
 modernizing the industry in the 1970s and 1980s may
 enable the USSR to save considerably in the 1990s on
 costs for equipment, floorspace, process time, and
 labor.

 Educating the Agricultural
 Labor Force: Winning the Battle
 But Losing the War?
 Soviet agriculture has traditionally been short of
 skilled workers, and the problem has worsened in the
 1980s. With the emphasis on rapid mechanization and
 widespread use of more sophisticated cropping and
 livestock-raising practices, the level of training and
 skills of the work force must be raised. But the quality
 of education in rural areas continues to suffer from ill-
 equipped schools, outdated training equipment, and
 underpaid and undertrained teachers. The low pres-
 tige of agricultural occupations in turn makes it hard
 to attract qualified students.
 Retaining better educated workers on the farms has
 proved to be even more difficult. Skilled workers are
 especially dissatisfied with living and working condi-
 tions in rural areas. The regime is offering various
 incentives such as lump-sum financial grants and
 interest-free housing construction loans to make agri-
 cultural employment more attractive. Thus far, how-
 ever, the improvements do not go far enough to
 substantially raise the average quality of the agricul-
 tural labor force.'
 Background
 The shortage of skilled labor is reflected in the annual
 influx of mechanics and other skilled workers from
 industry and other sectors, mostly during the harvest-
 ing season of July through mid-October. Moreover,
 the number of machinery operators has not kept pace
 with the growth of machinery and equipment on
 farms, so that industrial enterprises frequently "loan"
 farms mechanics and other skilled workers on a year-
 round basis. These measures provide a critical substi-
 tute source of skilled workers but lead to work
 disruption in nonagricultural sectors and a more-than-
 usual indifference to machinery maintenance and
 harvesting losses.
 The gap in educational attainment between urban and
 rural workers has narrowed considerably since 1970
 and will narrow even further as the older, less well-
 educated generation dies off. Still, according to the
 ' There are about 25 million workers employed in socialized
 agriculture-12 million on state farms and 13 million on collective
 farms. During the period 1950 to 1983, agricultural employment
 declined from 46 percent to 19 percent of total socialized employ-

 The Quality of Rural Education
 Soviet authorities frequently complain about the low
 quality of all levels of education in rural areas. Rural
 general education has been shortchanged on re-
 sources; schools are generally small and staffed with
 poorly trained faculty. Some schools do not offer even
 certain basic courses because of the shortage of
 trained staff. Farm officials also criticize the quality 25X1
 of the training of rural vocational-technical school
 graduates, citing ill-equipped schools, outdated train-
 ing equipment, and poorly qualified teachers.
 Vocational-Technical Schools
 Vocational-technical schools, which train students for
 skilled blue-collar trades, supply about half of agricul-
 ture's demand for new workers. During 1981-85,
 vocational-technical schools will graduate 13 million
 workers, of whom about 3 million will be trained in
 rural schools for agriculture. Of the latter, 1.1 million
 will be assigned to work in Siberia, the Far East, and
 the Non-Black Soil Zone (NBSZ).

 Although some rural areas have an adequate number
 of schools, there are many regions where the lack of
 schools is a serious problem. Yet, despite an apparent
 priority for school construction, the Ministry of Rural
 Construction is behind schedule in school commission-
 ings. School construction in some Siberian regions, for
 example, has not increased even though funding has
 been allocated. Rural vocational-technical schools are
 operating in only 70 percent of rural rayons in the
 USSR. Because of the shortage of schools, rural youth
 have enrolled in those urban vocational schools which
 have had difficulty recruiting urban students. In
 1983, about half of the students admitted to urban
 vocational-technical schools in Lithuania came from
 rural areas.
 Teacher Shortage
 Teachers are in short supply at all school grades
 because of the general unattractiveness of rural life.
 Teachers are among the lowest paid workers in the
 USSR and often have to teach subjects that are
 outside their areas of specialization. This dilutes the
 quality of rural education and reinforces teacher
 reluctance to accept positions in the countryside.
 Many graduates of teachers colleges, particularly
 those assigned to Siberia or the Far East, either do not
 report for their assignments or begin making plans to
 leave soon after they arrive. The teachers' negative
 attitude toward the countryside also encourages mi-
 gration among rural young people.
 The problem is self-perpetuating; poor-quality train-
 ing puts rural youngsters at a disadvantage when
 competing for admission to higher schools, even to
 higher agricultural schools. This is especially true in
 Central Asia where many children attend school for
 only half the year because of agricultural require-
 ments. Special preparatory departments have been
 organized at higher schools to prepare rural students
 for college work.
 Rural vocational-technical schools also find it hard to
 attract students because of the low prestige of agricul-
 tural occupations and widespread criticism of the
 training. In the Baltic republics, about 30 percent of
 rural eighth-grade graduates enroll in rural vocational
 schools, while in Central Asia the share is only 10
 percent. Farm managers are reluctant to release
 young people for training because of the three-year
 absence from work and the risk that they will not
 return after graduation. Education officials accuse
 farm managers of indifference, claiming they fail to
 stimulate interest in agricultural occupations either
 through career counseling or by giving newly trained
 workers appropriate work and equipment.
 Retaining Skilled Workers on the Farm
 In 1982 General Secretary Brezhnev indicated that
 less than half of all trained agricultural specialists are
 employed on state or collective farms. About 35 to 40
 percent of the higher and specialized secondary school
 graduates who are directed to farms either do not
 report for their assignments or leave shortly there-
 after-largely because of dissatisfaction with working
 and living conditions in rural areas.
 Very few of those trained to operate farm machinery
 actually end up doing so. For example, about 4.4
 million farm machinery operators were trained in
 vocational-technical schools or on farms during. 1981-
 83, but the total number of operators working in
 agriculture increased by only 56,000 during that
 period (table 2). Between 1965 and 1980, the tractor
 pool in agriculture increased by 58 percent, but the
 number of tractor and combine operators increased by
 only 35 percent.
 Some agricultural specialists are dissatisfied because
 they are not working at the jobs for which they were
 trained. For example, a survey taken among Central
 Asian agricultural specialists suggests the degree to
 which workers are used ineffectively:

 a Includes tractor machinists, tractor drivers, and combine opera-
 tors as of April.
 b Includes those trained in vocational-technical schools for work in
 agriculture and directly on collective and state farms and other
 agricultural enterprises.
 Rural vocational-technical schools have been criti-
 cized for neglecting specialties in short supply-such
 as animal husbandry, construction, and repair and
 technical servicing of machinery. Meanwhile, three-
 quarters of those enrolled in such schools are trained
 as farm machinery operators, even though most of
 them take jobs in other fields.
 It has been especially difficult to keep females on
 farms because of their dissatisfaction with employ-
 ment opportunities. Women comprise a substantial
 portion of technical agricultural specialists: 30 per-
 cent of agronomists, more than 50 percent of livestock
 specialists, and 40 percent of veterinary personnel.
 But they are greatly underrepresented in line-
 management positions. Only 1.6 percent of state farm
 directors and 2 percent of collective farm chairpersons
 are females, proportions which have remained un-
 changed since the mid-1950s.
 Females in agriculture are employed primarily in
 unappealing manual jobs involving livestock and crop-
 work-areas that have had low priority in terms of
 mechanization. With the emphasis on training farm
 machinery operators, educational and employment
 opportunities for females are better in urban areas,
 and young females are more likely to migrate than

 regardless.'

 males. Currently, females comprise 28 percent of total
 enrollment in vocational schools in Moldavia, but only
 7 percent of enrollment in rural schools. The share of
 female enrollment in rural schools in the RSFSR is
 about 10 percent.
 Another obstacle to retaining skilled workers is the
 practice of admitting urban students to higher insti-
 tutes in rural areas to fill enrollment quotas. These
 students enroll in higher agricultural schools merely
 to complete higher education, never intending to work
 on farms. Urban students have also been recruited to
 fill places in the lower level rural vocational-technical
 schools, but most return to the city for jobs with
 higher pay.

 Turnover is particularly high among machinery oper-
 ators who cite the farms' shortcomings in providing
 workers with adequate housing and equipment in good
 repair. An additional inducement for experienced
 operators to migrate is their preference for the regular
 working hours of a factory schedule. Other reasons for
 dissatisfaction include the uneven work schedule,
 nonregulated time off, and shoddy equipment repair
 service. In addition to the trained workers who leave
 for jobs in urban areas, many skilled workers take
 nonagricultural jobs in rural areas.
 New Incentives
 The regime is trying new measures to attract young
 people into agricultural training and, after gradua-
 tion, to convince them to stay on farms. In 1982,
 several agricultural schools were among about 40
 higher education schools excluded from the policy of
 ending draft deferments for education. Graduates of
 higher and specialized secondary schools in the fields
 of agronomy and animal husbandry will receive three
 years of free housing upon accepting a farm job. In
 addition, 50 percent of the passenger cars and 30
 percent of the motorcycles designated for sale in rural
 areas are to be earmarked for priority sale to young
 professionals with agricultural training.
 Similar incentives are being offered to agricultural
 specialists who will transfer from off-farm adminis-
 trative positions to employment directly on the farm.
 According to Mikhail Gorbachev, then the party
 secretary in charge of agriculture, the abolition of
 many of the trusts and specialized agricultural associ-
 ations announced in January 1983 would shift special-
 ists from administrative work back to "practical
 work" on the farms. As part of this plan, about 8,000
 people were transferred in early 1983, including 4,600
 in the RSFSR, 1,200 in the Ukraine, 450 in Kazakh-
 stan, and 400 in Belorussia.
 Current plans call for expanding and improving train-
 ing and incentives for vocational-technical students in
 rural areas as well. General secondary school gradu-
 ates with animal husbandry training who enroll in
 rural vocational-technical schools will receive monthly
 stipends of 96 to 104 rubles. Also, state farm and
 other agricultural enterprises will pay rural vocational
 school graduates who accept employment in agricul-
 ture lump-sum grants of 500 rubles (equivalent to
 about 30 percent of their first year's pay). Rural youth
 will be given preference for admission to these schools,
 and special efforts will be made to recruit more
 females. The quota for females will be set at one-third
 of total enrollment, and training in nonagricultural
 occupations in rural areas will be expanded to keep
 young females from migrating to urban areas.
 In 1981 the admissions policy in higher schools was
 changed to provide for noncompetitive admission to
 the correspondence (home-study) division for rural
 students sponsored by farms. Plans call for increasing
 the share of students enrolled in these part-time
 programs in higher agricultural schools from the
 current level of 46 percent. Educators readily admit
 the qualitative drawbacks of part-time education, but
 they believe that workers sponsored by their farms for
 training in the home-study programs will be more
 likely to continue working on those farms once they
 have completed their education.
 The authorities recognize the importance of improv-
 ing rural living conditions in retaining younger work-
 ers, in particular, in farm jobs. They have increased      25X1
 salaries and rural homebuilding and are making
 headway in improving consumer services, medical
 care, transportation, and cultural facilities.
 The prospects for raising the quality of rural educa-
 tion are uncertain at best. The regime has upgraded
 the plant, the staff, and the curriculum of rural
 schools. The scheduled increase in teacher salaries
 this year should make the profession more attractive
 to young people. More schools are being opened in
 rural areas, and enrollment in rural general education
 schools with extended day programs has risen sharply.
 However, as long as the policy of keeping rural
 children out of school for weeks at a time to help with
 the harvest persists, the commitment to improvement
 will be limited. Moreover, even if rural education does
 improve, the problems of retaining skilled workers will
 not be solved. The incentives the regime is offering to
 make agricultural employment more attractive are
 not very strong, particularly since the regime has
 neither the will nor the resources to bring about a
 substantial improvement in rural living standards, at
 least in the short run.
