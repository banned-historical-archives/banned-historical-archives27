 --   Finally, you may wish to share your views on the
 official Pakistani report of the crash that killed
 President Zia.  Predictably, the report rejects
 mechanical failure as the cause of the crash.   The
 Pakistanis clearly find possible sabotage a more
 politically powerful explanation.  We have
 maintained the position throughout this
 investigation that the matter is being handled by
 the Pakistani government.   We have no information
 in addition to that contained in the report.
 TAB C     China.   The Secretary of State has asked for your views
 on two issues currently of importance in China.   At TAB
 C are papers on each of these issues; the likelihood of
 Sino-Soviet summit in the near future and the impact of
 slowed economic reform in China.   In brief, the DI
 believes a Sino-Soviet summit to be likely,  after the
 U.S. elections, but as early as next spring.   The DI
 notes the outcome will not presage a return to the
 close relationship between the two countries of the
 1950's.   In domestic politics General Secretary Zhao
 Ziyang and his market-oriented policies suffered a
 setback on 30 September, but Zhao remains the front
 runner in the race to succeed Deng Xiaoping.
 TAB D    Yugoslavia and the Baltic States.   The Secretary of
 State has expressed interest in our assessment of the
 'ferment'  in Yugoslavia and the Baltic States.   In our
 view, Gorbachev's economic and political experiment in
 the Baltic represents the leading edge of his overall
 reform agenda with all the risks and rewards
 attendant.   The conclusion of the talking points at TAB
 D is that the odds for success are approximately
 fifty-fifty.   In a separate paper addressing the crisis
 in Yugoslavia, the analysts foresee greater resistance
 to Serb nationalist leader Milosevic from federal and
 regional leaders who are interested in maintaining the
 system of collective, ethnically-balanced
 decisionmaking in Yugoslavia.  While they believe the
 post-Tito system will remain, the analysts point out
 enduring stability is unlikely until the country's
 underlying ethnic and economic problems are dealt with
 more satisfactorily.

 The Run-Up to a Sino-Soviet Summit
 China's leaders clearly are preparing the West and their domestic audience for a
 summit meeting next year between Deng Xiaoping and Gorbachev.  Premier Li Peng
 expressed the hope that Sino-Soviet relations would be normalized at "an early
 date" during his 1 October national day addres
 tseiling,
 however,  remains  vague  about  the  timing,  apparently  hoping to  wrest   new
 concessions from Moscow during the coming exchange of visits by the Foreign
 Ministers.
 ? The Chinese are encouraged by Moscow's flexibility on Cambodia, but we believe
 Foreign Minister Qian will push during his visit to Moscow in late November for a
 firm commitment from Moscow on an early timetable for a full Vietnamese
 withdrawal. Qian may also try to encourage Moscow to join with China to initiate
 a meeting on Cambodia of the five permanent members of the UN Security
 Council and encourage Moscow to accept an international peacekeeping force in
 Cambodia.
 ? Chinese leaders may have raised the border forces issue--after letting it remain
 dormant for some time--to assuage the Chinese military's concerns over the
 pace of Sino-Soviet normalization and to gauge the price Moscow is willing to
 pay for a summit.
 Mao in 1959 will bring increased trade and technological cooperation, a larger Soviet
 presence in Beijing, and more contacts at all levels.

 ? The two may also be ready to move toward a border agreement, a resumption of.
 party-to-party ties, and a statement of principles on relations roughly similar to
 the Sino-US Shanghai Communique, but we believe the Chinese are still inclined
 to move slowly on these issues and may at most be prepared to craft a
 statement of principles in time for a summit.
 ? We also  expect  military  contacts  to  develop  as  confidence  building
 measures--particularly along the lengthy Sino-Soviet frontier--are agreed upon
 and implemented, but we do not believe they will extend to major Chinese arms
 purchases, advanced technology transfer, or genuine military cooperation.
 Past   disputes,  lingering distrust,  geopolitical rivalry, and conflicting national
 ambitions will continue to bound the reconciliation.  Recognition that Soviet and
 Chinese aspirations in Asia will continue to be at odds will prevent a return to the
 alliance relationship of the 1950s.
 ? The Chinese believe that the Soviet Union will remain the principal threat to
 Beijing over the long term. The Chinese are well aware that they are outgunned
 in every category of equipment along the Sino-Soviet frontier except manpower
 and that the Pacific Fleet has become the largest in the Soviet navy.
 ? A commentary in China's military newspaper this week dismissed Gorbachev's
 offer to withdraw forces from Cam Ranh Bay as a ploy to weaken US forces in
 Asia and focused attention on the continuing expansion of the Soviet Pacific
 Fleet.
 Beijing  reportedly stalled  on  setting  a  summit this year in  part to prevent
 Sino-Soviet relations from becoming a US election issue.  China may believe that
 the ideal timing for a summit will be in the Spring shortly after the new US
 administration takes office to gain leverage with Washington and remind the
 administration not to take its relations with China for granted.
 ? Beijing will continue to carefully assess Washington's reaction to each adjustment
 in Sino-Soviet bilateral ties, however, to avoid alarming the United States and
 jeopardizing  Chinese access to Western technology, trade, and  investment.
 Though Sino-Soviet trade has increased to some $2.5 billion annually, for
 example, China's trade with the United States and Japan reached $24 billion last
 year.

 Recent Political Developments in China
 On September 30, General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and the more
 market-oriented reformers sustained a setback when the 3rd Plenum of the
 Communist Party announced a decision to shelve price reform and
 concentrate for the next two years on dampening inflation and gaining
 control of the overheated economy.  The strategy adopted by the plenum--
 cutting spending on capital construction, tightening credit, and
 strengthening administrative controls over the economy--is largely that
 advocated by Zhao's more cautious rivals, Premier Li Peng and Vice
 Premier Yao Yilin.
 ^ Li and Yao capitalized on soaring inflation--20-50% in major
 cities--panic buying, bank runs, and worker protests in August and
 early September to win support for their approach.  Many leaders
 are fearful that the high-growth, high-inflation strategy Zhao was
 pushing was contributing to social unrest that could get out of
 hand if inflation were not checked.
 ^ However, the steps taken thus far--lending limits, higher interest
 on savings, and a media campaign--are not likely to slow inflation
 quickly.   In fact, the government must print more money soon to
 pay for the fall grain harvest, which is likely to exacerbate the
 problems in the short run.
 ^ Zhao's opponents may thus press to toughen controls even more,
 which would lead to protests from provincial officials and
 consumers facing scarcities.
 Zhao and his supporters will be seeking an opportunity to reassert
 themselves and their more ambitious agenda.  They recognize that
 allowing more traditional policies to dominate for two years, as the
 decision announced, would make it very difficult to revive-momentum for
 their market-oriented policies.
 ^ We doubt that, over the short term, Zhao's market reforms will be
 effective in maintaining growth without fueling inflation.  Thus
 neither side will have much success in handling China's economic
 problems and defusing popular criticism.
 ^ Moreover, the balance within the leadership between advocates of
 cautious and radical policies is so fine that neither group is in
 control long enough for its policies to have lasting effects.
 Zigs and zags in policy are likely to continue, and the risk of
 policy paralysis is high.
 Over time, this struggle could affect the succession to Deng
 Xiaoping. In our view, Zhao's influence has been weakened, and his

 SECRET
 efforts to establish himself firmly as successor to Deng Xiaoping's
 position as de facto leader have been hurt.  He has apparently ceded
 important areas of economic policy--for example, the inflation-fighting
 campaign--to Li Peng.  However, Zhao remains the front-runner in the
 succession race, and we do not believe he is now in danger of losing the
 general secretaryship.
 ^ There is some disagreement in the community over how seriously
 Zhao's prestige has been damaged, and State analysts tend to be
 more optimistic than we.  Some State analysts believe Zhao may
 have let Li have the anti-inflation portfolio because it is a no-
 win job.
 ^ Deng Xiaoping, 84, still backs Zhao, but seems to be increasingly
 in the background.  As the succession draws closer, many leaders
 are taking a wait-and-see attitude.  Deng himself may also realize
 that, to succeed him, Zhao has to be seen as capable of fighting
 his own battles.

 Talking Points for DCI on USSR: Unrest in the Baltic
 President Gorbachev's economic and political experiment in the
 Baltic represents the leading edge of his overall reform agenda,
 with all its risks and rewards.  His apparent tolerance and even
 encouragement of some aspects of Baltic autonomy is based on the
 hope that the region can provide a model for revitalizing the
 stagnant Soviet economy.
 He sees the Baltic as a critical testbed for his reform efforts.
 o He uses examples from the Baltic area to cite success for
 some aspects of his agricultural reforms, particularly
 family leasing.
 Gorbachev hopes
 to make the Baltic into a non-confrontational model for
 dealing with nationality problems in contrast to his tough
 response to the conflict between Azerbaijanis and Armenians.
 of                      lalso indicated that Gorbachev is
 considering more liberal joint venture arrangements in late
 November, possibly paving the way for the region's ultimate
 entry into international financial organizations.
 o                      planning a sweeping purge of the local
 party organizations replacing hardliners who, constituted
 half of the local personnel and are blocking his progress.
 However, he also realizes that Baltic nationalism could undermine
 his entire program.
 o The driving force behind the recent surge of national
 self-consciousness and political activism in the Baltic is a
 resentment of Moscow's policies which Baltic nationalists
 view as colonial.

 violence could derail his reforms.
 has compared the situation to ethnic problems in Yugoslavia,
 and warned that the likely economic success of the Baltic
 will fuel resentment among the Russians and people in less
 developed regions.
 In particular, Gorbachev experiment in allowing more autonomy to
 the Baltic carries four major risks:
 --the loss of party control
 --the risk of a violent Russian backlash
 --encouragement for vetting similar nationalist demands

 IN .
 --the risk that local nationalists will get carried away and
 demand independence.
 Gorbachev is counting on political maturity and moderation among
 the Balts, who have less of a tradition of violent nationalism
 than some groups and have a stake in working within the system,
 but it remains a major gamble.
 o Instead of coopting the Popular Fronts, which have become
 de facto opposition parties, the party is coming
 increasingly under their control.
 o Dissidents in Lithuania claim that the front there has
 "practically usurped control" from the party and state and
 the new president of Latvia admitted that he could not rule
 out the possibly that non-communist delgates would be a
 majority in the Latvian congress in the near future.
 Signs are mounting of a violent Russian backlash in the Baltic.
 o The appearance of appeals to violence among
 Russian-speakers in Estonia and Latvia, who see themselves
 as the main losers as the region becomes more independent,
 and reports that some party hardliners are encouraging
 ethnic tensions to_derail the process are danger signs for
 Gorbachev's program.
 o A major inter-ethnic clash, like that occuring in the
 Caucasus, could torpedo any progress, as Gorbachev
 reportedly realizes.
 Moreover, the Baltic popular nationalist movement is increasingly
 becoming an inspiration to non-Russian minorities in other regions
 of the Soviet Union.
 o Other nationalists have parroted the Baltic demands on
 language, the environment, economic autonomy, and
 restrictions on military service to their home republic.
 o Renewed national fervor is reported in the Western Ukraine,
 Georgia, and Moldavia--in addition to Armenia and
 Azerbaijan--and there is evidence that these nationalist
 groups are increasingly coordinating their activity.
 The recent leadership changes in the Politburo have relieved some
 of the pressure for a crackdown on national unrest and tilted
 Moscow's leadership in the direction of tolerance.
 o With less pressure from the more orthodox members of the
 Politburo, Gorbachev has bought some time to work out his
 economic and political experiment in the Baltic republics

 where support for his'most radical proposals is the
 strongest and where he believes his programs have the
 greatest chance for success.
 o Despite this, considerable reservation remains in the
 Politburo and Central Committee to which Gorbachev is
 answerable.  His challenge will be to maintain control,
 forestall unacceptable demands for independence, and prevent
 a violent backlash from the local Russian minority.   His
 prospects for success are probably no better than
 fifty-fifty, and a major policy failure here could severely
 damage the credibility of his whole reform program.

 Yugoslavia:  No Quick Solutions to the Crisis
 Federal and regional officials are likely to blunt Serbian party chief
 Slobodan Milosevic's (pronounced Mee-LOH-sheh-veech) bid to overturn the
 post-Tito system of collective, ethnically balanced decisionmaking in favor
 of strong Serbian-led rule.  In the coming weeks they are likely to put up
 greater resistance and have a good chance to curtail the mass Serb
 demonstrations and other pressure tactics that Milosevic has used to create
 the most serious threat to stability in decades.  Even so, enduring
 stability is unlikely until the country's underlying ethnic and economic
 problems are dealt with more satisfactorily.
 National and regional leaders this week began to stand up to Milosevic's
 strongarm tactics and his bid to reimpose Serbian hegemony with himself as
 the country's dominant powerbroker.
 -- National Party Chief Stipe Suvar (SHOO-vahr) in the keynote address
 to a Central Committee Plenum Monday indirectly criticized Serbia
 for promoting nationalism and tolerating attacks on former President
 Tito.
 -- Other officials at the plenum also denounced ethnic Serb
 demonstrations, a key source of Milosevic's recently increased
 prominence.
 -- Six of Yugoslavia's eight regions in recent days have increasingly
 criticized Serbian nationalism.  Some even have implied that
 Milosevic is seeking dictatorial powers.
 -- Senior officials in the mainly Serb military leadership, who have
 been silent for most of the current crisis, have begun implicitly
 warning against Serbian nationalism and Milosevic's tactics.  They
 have indicated the Army will accept whatever orders it receives from
 the national leadership to ensure the country's unity.
 A failure by Milosevic at this week's Plenum to replace his many foes with
 more compliant officials would set back his larger goals but is unlikely to
 wholly shunt aside his pro-Serbian agenda.
 -- While up to one-third of the national Party leadership may be
 replaced at the plenum, the new national leadership may not be
 beholden to or supportive of Milosevic.  Press reports indicate that

 the replacements will continue to represent their regions and
 reflect traditional parochial ethnic interests.
 -- Nevertheless, Milosevic could play down any losses and refocus
 efforts within Serbia by consolidating his recently gained greater
 power over the autonomous province of Vojvodina and stepping up
 efforts to remove the leadership in Kosovo, Serbia's other
 autonomous province.  This would give Serbia a somewhat stronger
 voice in national policy.
 -- Milosevic could also continue to defy the national Party leadership
 by using his mass popular following to push for greater Serbian
 influence in the country.  He may exploit a planned march in
 Belgrade next weekend by hundreds of thousands of Serb demonstrators
 to again air his demands or even sharpen them.
 Even if Belgrade can rein in Milosevic, the prospects of instability will
 remain high as long as the weak national leadership fails to take tough
 steps to dampen ethnic nationalism--especially among his Serb
 supporters--and improve economic performance.
 -- The new leaders chosen at Tuesday's plenum will probably be no more
 effective than their predecessors in solving key problems.
 -- Dissatisfaction with Premier Branko Mikulic's (MEE-koo-leech)
 handling of the economy is so great that he and his cabinet could
 face a vote of confidence within six months.  No new
 government--including one led by Milosevic--is likely to implement
 the kind of economic reforms needed.to promote recovery and stem
 inflation now running at more than 200 percent.
 The current developments in Yugoslavia threaten US interests for several
 reasons:
 -- While the current political turmoil is indicative of the partial
 democracy that has evolved in Yugoslavia, Milosevic's goals and the
 escalation of ethnic antagonisms are a danger to previously
 developing democratic processes and pluralistic institutions.
 -- Military intervention would likely be accompanied by significant
 human rights abuses.
 -- Yugoslav economic objectives and the likelihood of Belgrade's
 meeting commitments to the IMF are further threatened, and new
 demands for Western economic aid are likely to be more vociferous.
