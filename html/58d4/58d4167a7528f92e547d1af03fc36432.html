FOREWORD  
Estimates,The 1958 Annual  here presented, is 
a revision of the fourth edition of a series of analyses 
of the political and demographic composition of Com-
munist-ruled countries. A summary of estimates which 
is part of ARD research during the year 1956-57 and 
historical changes noted during that time, it also 
includes certain revisions and adjustments necessitated 
by new data received or evaluated since the publication 
of the original edition on 1 May 1957. An attempt has 
been made to initiate a system of rating the relative 
accuracy of estimates or groups of estimates, and this 
system, presently employed only in estimates of urban 
population, will be refined and extended in subsequent 
editions. 
The volume of new data relating both to the 
current period and the past has increased tremendously 
during the past year, although the quality of the mater-
ial is highly variable--both from country to country 
and topic to topic. The present edition, for the first 
time, encompasses the entire Sino-Soviet Bloc, having 
been expanded to include the Korean People's Demo-
cratic Republic (North Korea), the Democratic Republic 
of Vietnam (North Vietnam), and the Mongolian People's 
Republic (Outer Mongolia). Available data relating 
to these newly included areas are incomplete, however, 
and in many cases the material presented is limited 
to the crudest estimates, This volume, as revised, 
also includes an analysis of the initial effects of 
the program of economic decentralization, as well as 
certain adjustments occasioned by new or revised data 
appearing in the recently received statistical hahd-
books Narodnoye khozyaystvo RSFSR, Narodne gospodar-
stvo Ukrainskoi RSR, and the 1956 supplement to 
Narodnoye khozyaystvo SSSR. Additional material 
dealing with the structure and distribution of the 
population of the USSR and of ethnic groups within 
the Soviet Union is anticipated, and further adjust-
ments will be prepared for inclusion in subsequent 
editions.

PART ONE. THE SINO-SOVIET BLOC 
The Sino Soviet Bloc, comprising the Communist-ruled 
countries of the world, is a vast domain stretching from Central 
Europe to the Pacific Ocean and from the North Pole to the shores 
of the South China Sea. It covers more than 25 per cent of the 
total land area of the earth and inc ludes about 35 per cent of 
the world's populatinn. 
The 1958 population of this bloc of Communist states is 
estimated to total more than 950 million (see Table 1-1). By

1962 the population will have increasecl about 6 per cent, or 57 mil-
lion, approximately the same rate of increase as for the world popu-
lation during the period 1950-51+. About 69 per cent of the increase 
is expected to occur in the Asiatic sector. The USSR and most of the 
East European satellites are areas of comparatively low birth and 
death rates whereas high birth and death rates prevail in China and 
the Asiatic satellites. The population increase in the Asiatic 
countries is expected to result primarily from a declining death rate, 
since fertility is expected to remain high despite recent Chinese 
attempts to institute birth control measures. In the USSR and the 
East European satellites, death rates have decreased tremendously 
since World War II--by more than 50 per cent in the USSR and by almost 
as much in some of the satellite countries, but as a result of a 
lower birth rate, population will increase at a slower rate than in 
Asia. 
In terms of population, the People's Republic of China 
dominates the bloc. Here are found an estimated 623 million.

This vast complex, and particularly the Asiatic sector, is 
primarily agricultural: of the total population 76.11- per cent live 
in rural areas (see Table 1-3). It is necessary, however, to point 
out certain distinctions between the two chief components. The USSR 
and the East European satellites form a comparatively modern, urban-
ized technological society in which industrial production plays a 
large role. China and the Asiatic satellites are predominantly agri-
cultural countries, even though industrialization is increasing under 
the Communists.

The most highly urbanized section of the Sino-Soviet Bloc 
is the region of the East European satellites, where almost 48 per 
cent of the population live in cities and towns. Even among these 
countries, however, there is considerable variation, ranging from 
23.6 per cent in Albania to 72.7 per cent in East Germany. By 
1962, it is estimated that at least one-half of the population will 
live in urban areas. 
The USSR, straddling 'Europe and Asia, is now almost as 
highly urbanized as the East European satellites, with almost 44. 
per cent of its population living in cities and towns. The Soviet 
urban population is growing steadily at the expense of the rural, 
chiefly through a continuous in-migration from the countryside to 
the city. Of the reported 17 million urban increase during the 
Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951-55), 9 million were rural in-migrants. 
Although increasing industrialization will help maintain a steady 
flow of in-migrants, the number coming to urban areas has already 
begun to decline from the peak period of 1951-55.

Part One 
In the Asiatic sector, urban definitions are somewhat tenu-
ous and the rate of urbanization continues to increase slowly, par-
ticularly since China, which contains almost 97 per cent of the urban 
population, is currently following a policy designed to control the 
unrestricted flow of population from the countryside to the cities. 
Only 13.5 per cent of the total population of the Asiatic sector 
live in cities or towns, making it one of the least urbanized areas 
in the world. 
The labor force in the Sino-Soviet Bloc consists chiefly 
of workers and employees (i.e., wage and salary earners) and farmers, 
(both individual and collective) Workers and employees are the 
more highly skilled component; they are essentially urban in character, 
but include a small group living in rural areas who are employed 
in agriculture and various services.

PART TWO. 
THE USSR 
POLITICAL 
A. The Communist Party, 
1. Growth  
By 1 January 1958 the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 
(CPSU) will total an estimated 7,458,000. Thirty-six of every 
1,000 persons or 56 of every 1,000 adults will be Party members 
(see Table 1-1). 
Since 1939 the rate of growth of the CPSU has been uneven, 
reflecting the adjustments of Soviet leadership to changing foreign 
and domestic situations. The greatest increase in membership occur-
red during the early months of World War II; by the end of the war 
the Party had increased by 1.8 million, an average annual rate of 
10 per cent since 1940. From 15Lq to 1952, during the period of 
postwar recovery and reconstruction and a deepening political crisis 
within the aging Stalinist regime, the annual rate of growth de-
creased to about 2 per cent. In the period of consolidation of 
power following Stalin's death, the rate further decreased to one 
per cent and since 1956 has remained nearly constant. 
The number of Communists per 1,000 total and adult popula-
tions has decreased slightly since 1952, as the rate of Party growth 
has fallen behind the natural increase in the population. Since 
1956 quantitative growth in the Party ranks has been deemphasized 
and given a role of relatively minor importance. The Party leader-
ship has assigned priority importance to qualitative growth in Party 
membership, calling on all Party organizations to admit to member-
ship only the most advanced workers, agriculturalists, and intellec-
tuals. It is estimated, therefore, that the number of Communists 
per 1,000 total and adult populationswi 1 I remain constant through 
1957, and may even decrease slightly if current policy is continued. 
2. Distribution  
Note: Following the Twentieth Party Congress in 1956, 
data were published for the first time since 1939 which 
permits the application of a single method (the extrapo-
lation of delegate listings) to determine the distribution 
of Party members and candidates for all administrative 
divisions.. ThArAforAl each entry in the tablas which 
follow is more accurate and the conclusions drawn from the 
entries are considered more reliable than in previous ed-
itions of The Annual Estimates.

All figures reported, except 1951+ and 1958. For discussion

of the 15 union republics; the 1957 estimates of Party membership 
in the armed forces and MVD troops by union republics were kept 
constgnt. 
All figures reported, except 1954. For discussion of 1954

The distribution of the Party among the various administra-
tive divisions is extremely irregular, and the variations in the 
incidence of Party membership can be considered one of the useful 
indices for assessing the significance of an area. The geographic 
distribution of Party membership reflects the Kremlin's evaluation 
of the importance of various groups in Soviet society and a desire 
to place Communists in what it considers strategically important 
occupations. 
Party membership, therefore, is concentrated in areas which 
are Highly urbanized and? industrialized or which contain large mili-
tary contingents. It is estimated that Party incidence is six times 
as high in urban centers as inrural areas, and is significantly higher 
in highly industrialized areas (Kiyevskaya Oblast, Ukrainskaya SSR) 
than ih predominantly agricultural areas (Sumskaya Oblast, Ukrain-
skaya SSR). Party incidence is also much higher in areas in which 
there are relatively large military contingents (Murmanskaya Oblast, 
RSFSR). National minorities, with the striking exception of the

Transcaucasian ethnic groups, have a much lower participation than 
have Great Russians. Thirty-six of every 1,000 persons in the So-
viet Union are members of the Communist Party; 56 of every 1,000 
age 18 and above are Party members. Party membership within the 
union republics varies from a high of 81+ per 1,000 adult population 
in the Gruzinskaya SSR to a low of 26 in the Litovskaya SSR (see 
Table 2-2). Party membership among the ?b lasts, krays, and ASSR's 
varies from a high o185 per 1,000 total population in Murmanskaya 
Oblast to a low of 9 per 1,000 in Ternopolskaya 0blast5 in the 
Ukrainskaya SSR (see Table A-2, Appendix, and Map 1). 
3. Composition 
During the past year the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, 
theoretically a "union ... of people of the working class, the work-
ing peasantry, and the working intelligentsia," has continued to 
develop as an elite group dominated by a large bureaucratic appa-
ratus intent upon maintaining its monopoly of political power. 
, A re-analysis of data dealing with the full-time employees 
of the Party who comprise the staff of the Party apparatus has 
necessitated an upward revision of previous estimates. It is esti-
mated that by January 1958 the Party bureaucracy will total approxi-
mately 440,000, or almost 6 per cent of total Party membership. 
Of this to*lmore than one-third will appear on the nomenclature 
or "patronage list" of the USSR Party Secretariat, 10 per cent on 
those of the republics, and almost 60 per cent on those of the local 
Party committees. 
One of the principal means by which the Party bureaucracy 
attempts to assure the continuation of its dominant status in the 
Soviet power structure is by staffing all important positions with 
Communists through placement and highly selective recruitment of 
Party members in certain occupations. Since Soviet society places 
a high premium upon education, the more highly educated an indi-
vidual, the more likely that he is a Party member. Data:published 
during and following the XX Party Congress reveal that Par.ty members 
with a higher or incomplete higher education, constituting 15 per 
cent-of Party membership-(see Table 2-3), represent more than 1+5' 
per cent of all such persons in the USSR .More-than 33 percent 
of Soviet scientists, engineers, and technicians are Communists. 
It is felt that the proportion of Party members with specialized 
and higher educations will continue to increase significantly.

Based on projections of data reported by The Mandate Commission 
at the XX Party Congress, February 1956. 
Further research also indicates that 812,000 Communists, 
or slightly more than 11 per cent of total Party membership, we 
serving in the armed forces and MVD troops (see Table 2-1) in 1956. 
This figure represents a reported decline of about 145,000 from a 
high believed to have been reached during the first years of the 
Korean War. Since 1946, however, it is believed that Communists 
in the military have continued to represent about 19 or 20 per cent 
of total military personnel. Although details of the social compo-
sition of Communists serving in the military are not known, reported 
data dealing with the pre-World Wei' II period indicate that virtual-
ly all officers, almost 50 per cent of the NCO's, and 10 per cent 
of the lower grades are Party members. It is felt that the 1956 
incidence of Party membership in the military and possibly also the 
1956 total in the military will be applicable to the 1958 situation. 
The estimated postwar distribution of Party members serving 
in the armed forces and MVD troops (see Table 2-4) is believed to 
reflect the disposition and internal movement of military personnel. 
Generally speaking, the number of troops in the western border areas 
such as the Litovskaya SSR declined steadily during the 1549-56 
"period, while the number in interior areas increased. Perhaps the 
most striking example is in Moskovskaya.Oblast where the number of 
Communists in the military, and probably the military itself, in-

Part Two  
4. 
I. Political 
Although the function and basic organization of the Communist 
Party apparatus have remained essentially unaltered during the past 
year, by the end of 1956 a trend toward a decrease in intra-Party 
"democracy" had developed. The trend is most noticeable within the 
lower echelons of the Party, where the responsibilities of local 
Party officials are being increased in conjunction with the "decentral-
ization" of the economic apparatus (see Section C.2. Trends in Ad-
ministration). 
Since Stalin's death in 1953, and particularly since the 
XX Party Congress in February 1956, the Party press has featured 
numerous calls for greater exercise of intra-Party democracy. Ap-
parently some members of the Party's rank-and-file accepted this 
call at face value and leveled strong criticism at lower- and middle-
rank officials. Some of these contained implied criticism of the 
highest Party officials and the basic tenets of Communist ideology. 
Even before the Polish and Hungarian trouble, however, it became 
apparent that the call for greater freedom of discussion was meant 
to apply only to particular aspects of certain subjects, and many 
of those who had criticized most frankly were censured for violat-
ing the principle of "democratic-centralism."1 The end result has 
been that although public discussion continues, it has again been 
limited to details or implementation of plans or "theses," rather 
than to the rationale behind the proposals af top leadership. 
'.86incident with theii.estriction on baic.discussions, Party 
leaders lengthened the periods between the general membership meet-
ings, thereby altering one of the weakest tenets of democratic-
centralism--"the periodic accountability of Party bodies to their 
Party organizations." Party officials, particularly in the'lower 
Party units, are thus less subject to criticism from the rank-and-
file. In general, Party officials in republics, ()blasts, kray 
okrugs, cities, and rayons now report to their "constituents" once 
every two years rather than every 12 or 18 months; in the Ukraine, 
Belorussia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, republic officials now 
? 
in we official definition of "democratic-centralism" the most 
important clauses are: 1) "the decisions of higher (Party) bodies 
are unconditionally binding upon lower ones"; and 2) "strict Party 
discipline and subordination of the minority to the majority."

report only once every four years.1 The responsibility of these 
officials to report to the higher echelons on every occasion remains, 
however. And the appointments of all officials must be confirmed 
and in most cases initiated by the USSR Party officials. 
At the lowest level of the Party structure, the Party Prima-
ry Organization (formerly cell), changes have been introduced which 
lead to the compartmentalization of membership, thereby decreasing 
the possibility of any "united" action oh a significant scale by 
the rank-and-file. In enterprises with more than 300 members, the 
primary organization, as such, has been abolished, and separate shop, 
brigade, or similar Primary Organizations have been established. 
These smaller organizations no? longer elect representatives to an 
enterprise Party unit but are supervised by Party professionals 
at the plant who are appointed by the higher echelons of the Party 
apparatus. Primary Organizations with less than 300 but more than 
50 members (formerly 100) are now subdivided into shop, brigade, 
or similar units; and are administered by an elected bureau which 
must be confirmed by the. Party apparatus. 0 
While the long-range significance of these changes is de-
batable, the immediate consequences are obvious. The initial 
"loosening of the bonds" resulted in unforeseen difficulties and 
was followed by a significant decrease in "intra-Party" democracy 
as far as general Party membership was concerned. Local Party 
officials, however, have gained greater freedom of action vis-a-
vis the general membership. The March 1957 pronouncements of First 
Secretary Khrushchev on governmental reorganization, when implement-
ed, will place even greater demands upon the capacities of local 
Party officials without, however, significantly increasing their 
freedom of action vis-a-vis the Kremlin.

All figures reported in the Soviet press, except for the 
1958 estimate. Figures for 1949 and 1954 reported during the All-
, Union Komsomol Congresses held in those years. 
Based on ARD estimates for total population. 
The rate of growth of the Komsomol has been extremely ir-
regular. In 1936 the main task of the organization was redefined 
and stressed as the Communist indoctrination of youth, with the 
result that membership increased sharply in the late thirties and 
during World War II. By 1947, however, total membership still had 
not reached the 1941 level of 10.5 million. Komsomol membership 
more than doubled between 1949 and 1954, reflecting the increased 
importance the regime attached to the ideological preparation of 
the most promising of Soviet youth for Party membership and for the 
organization and indoctrination of Soviet youp, in general for 
service to the regime. 
Given the widespread unrest among educated Soviet youth, 
particularly noticeable since the Polish-Hungarian uprising in 1956, 
the Komsomol may be expected to re-emphasize political conformity 
for its membership. Since more than 80 per cent of students in 
higher educational establishments and 20 per cent of students in 
general are members, the Komsomol will become increasingly important 
as an organ of control over the nonconformist elements of Soviet 
youth.

Part Two Political  
C. Government  
1, The USSR Control Force  
Note: Data published since The 1957 Annual Estimates has 
permitted an extension in the coverage of the primary and secondary 
control force categories. A more rigorous definition of subgroups 
has separated officers and ACOs into the primary and secondary 
categories, respectively, and as a result some subgroups and totals 
are not comparable with figures presented previously. The possible 
effects of the proposed (March 1957) decentralization program on 
the numbers, subordination' and distribution of control force per-
sonnel, where known, are discussed. Since the situation remains 
dynamic, the estimates for primary government and economic control 
forces continue subject to change. 
The USSR control force totals an estimated 18,696,000 per-
sons, or approximately 9 per cent of the USSR population and 20 
per cent of the USSR labor force. It consists of persons who, be-
cause of military or administrative rank, type of employment, or 
character of professional activities, direct, supervise, or control 
at least part of the activities of others. The primary control 
force is that segment which is responsible for the formulation of 
policy or for the exercise of general administrative or command 
functions; the secondary control force provides certain professional 
services of a public nature or has supervisory or command status 
involving the direct control of a limited number of persons engaged 
in the production of goods or provision of physical services. 
The most important of the various components of the control 
force is the Communist Party, followed in order of imprtance by 
the primary government and military sectors (see Table 2-6). 
Each of these possesses either the position or the means to command 
the activities of large segments of the population. The least im-
portant are the secondary government and economic sectors, in which 
control functions are limited to small groups and occasionally are 
dependent upon an individual's prestige. 
The functions and status of the control force create inter-
ests and relationships which tend 'co set its members apart from 
other sectors of the population. And although officially there are 
no classes in Soviet society, nevertheless these differences serve 
in the free world as criteria for the determination of social classes. 
Members of the Soviet control force, therefore, may be equated with the 
upper- and middle-classes in other secieties. As elsewhere, they 
hold a more favored economic position than the mass of the populntinn.

The rewards for their services range from the high salary and ex-

to the meager pay and limited privileges of a rural primary-school 
teacher. 
The growth of the USSR control force will probably continue 
in the near future, since the increasing industrialization and 
urbanization of the economy demands more and varied administrative 
and supervisory positions. 
Distribution. The estimated distribution of the USSR . 
? primary and secondary control forces among the major ad-

the single most important component of the USSR control force, for

Party Central Committee. A similar situation exists at the union 
republic level, but at the local level Party officials are full-
time professionals. At all administrative-territorial or organ-

through selection and placement of personnel; some Oblast Party 
Committees are responsible for personnel in as many as 2,600 types 
of positions.

At the highest level, the central USSR authorities 
have great power and prestige. They are the leaders in the 
determination of policy and they tend to act without considering 
the wishes or needs of peripheral areas. Although the authority 
of republic and local authorities has increased considerably dur-
ing the past year and may be expected to increase further as the 
decentralization movement continues, it will continue to be limited 
largely to implementation of directives issued by agencies at the 
USSR level. 
Since 1955 there has been an estimated decrease of 
122,000 in the total primary control force, reflecting the transfer 
of certain controls to nongovernmental agencies and the results of 
a campaign for the reduction in administrative personnel. The 
number of USSR employees has decreased considerably airing the past 
year, but the decrease has been almost compensated for by increases 
in the number of emp1o5tees a.E.,u4on republic level. Prior cam-
paigns to reduce the number of administrative personnel have been 
effective at first, but have always been followed by increases 
which sometimes exceeded the reduction. It is felt, therefore, 
that the long-term trend toward growth will reassert itself, and 
that while some components may be reduced, the to;tal primary con-
trol force will increase as republic governments extend their 
activities. 
Secondary Government Control Force. The 8,856,000

publics, oblasts, krays, okrugs, cities, and rayons. They include

health and educational personnel and those employed in various 
public service and utility activities. Although the secondary 
control force has no responsibility for policy determination or 
planning, it carries out the policies set by the primary control 
force and also directs certain activities of a public nature. 
Its influence is significant, particularly since its members in-
clude workers in the health and educational services who are 
important forces in most urbanized and industrialized economies. 
The economic status of this group is far less favorable than that 
of members of the primary control force. 
Significant changes in the subordination of the secon-
dary control force as a result of the increasing decentralization 
of governmental activities have resulted in an increase in the 
number of employees during the past year as the central govern-
ment has transferred the responsibility for specific functions 
to lower agencies. This increase will continue as the Soviet 
State becomes more consumer-oriented. 
Military Control Force. The Soviet military control force 
comprises the 1.71 million officers and NCOs of the USSR 
army, navy, and air force (see Table 2-9). The key position of the 
military is reflected in the high incidence of Party membership 
in its ranks: a reported 77 per cent of the total armed forces 
and 86.4 per cent of Soviet officers are members either of the 
Party or of the Komsomol.

The primary control force of the military consists of the 
estimated 620,000 Soviet officers. The officer corps occupies a 
privileged position in Soviet society and receives special treat-
ment, such as access to normally unobtainable consumer. goods at 
nominal prices. The lowest ranking Soviet officer receives abase 
pay which is 13 times as great as that of a private soldier; the 
pay of the highest ranking officer is more than 100 times. as. great. 
The estimated 1.09 million professional NCOs comprise the. 
secondary .control force. They receive substantially the same priv-
ileges, on a reduced scale, as commissioned.officers. Their base 
pay ranges from 3 to 10 times greater than that of the private 
soldier. 
Among the branches of service,. officers and NCOs.serving 
in.the air force have higher status 'than. those in the navy and army. 
Within each. branch, those serving in combat units, such as air crews 
and submarine service, receive preferential treatment.

Affairs (MVD) and Committee of State. Security (KGB) control 
force totals an estimated 390,000 officers and ACO's (see Table 
2-10). As members of the Soviet state security organs, they are 
firmly controlled by and act as the enforcement arm of the central 
apparatus of the Ctmmunist Party.. While their status and prestige 
has declined' in recent years, they continue to control the only

recently have lost their autonomous status and have become sub-
ordinate to local organs of the civil government. 
The Economic Control Force. The economic control force, 
estimated to 6,061,000, equates roughly with the Soviet 
"managerial' class" (see Table 2-11). Members of the economic control

Primary Economic Control Force. The primary economic 
control force, totaling 732,000, is responsible for 
the supervision of groups of producing enter prises. Its members 
are the "middlemen" between the ministries and other governmental 
agencies and the actual producers. They are employed by economic 
organizations (trusts, combines, associations, and departments) 
which are generally organized on a geographical basis to control 
activities of specific types of enterprises within a given area 
(e.g., the Karaganda Coal Combine which controls a number of 
trusts operating coal mines in the Karaganda fields in Kazakhstan, 
or an oblast state farm trust which supervises a regionally 
defined group of state farms). They receive relatively high re-
wards for their services, and by virtue of the level at which 
they work are somewhat remote from the rest of the population. 
Indirect evidence suggests that the centralization of policy and 
planning at the USSR level tends to make this intermediate group 
somewhat superfluous, and its authority is resented by those at 
the plant level. However, the current plan for the decentraliza-
tion of the control of economic activity will propbably increase 
the importance of the primary control force and bring about a 
corresponding growth in its numbers, for, given the local 
experience, it will form the nucleus of the new type of control 
agency, the regional Councils of National Economy. 
Secondary Economic Control Force. The estimated 
5,329,000 persons who comprise the secondary economic 
control force range in position from the director of the Magni-
togorsk Metallurgical Combine, with its thousands of employees, to 
the foreman of a small work group on a collective farm. Theirs 
is the responsibility of supervising the actual production of 
goods or services and of controlling to that end the activities 
of a group of workers. The closer contact between the working and 
the managerial group at this level, AR contrasted With groups at 
other levels, promotes frequent clashes of interest. In compari-
son with groups at lower levels, members of the secondary economic 
control force receive substantial economic benefits and enjoy

Part Two L Political  
2. Trends  in Administration 
Soviet Communist Party Secretary Nikita N. Khrushchev's 
grand scheme to reduce the extreme centralization of Soviet 
economic administration entered its operational phase in the early 
summer of 1957. The new system, which transfers working re-
sponsibility for many spheres of industrial and construction 
activity to local control, divides the USSR into 105 economic re-
gions, each supervised by a national economic council (sovnarkhoz). 
It is based on proposals, made by Khrushchev in late March, modified 
during a subsequent "nationwide" discussion, and enacted into law 
by the USSR Supreme Soviet on 10 May and by the 15 republic Supreme 
Soviets in late May and early June. 
Although first presented to Soviet citizens with dramatic 
suddenness in early spring, the new system of economic administra-
tion had been in the making for several months. It was foreshadowed 
by a two-year Soviet campaign against the evils of overcentralization, 
bureaucratic gigantism, and irrational business practices in the 
Soviet economic-administrative system. in previous actions Soviet 
leaders had already reduced all light industrial and some heavy in-
dustrial ministries from all-union to union-republic status, had 
ordered them to divest themselves of superfluous departments and 
personnel, and had attempted to transplant the offices of numerous 
directorates and administrations from'Moskva to industrial and con-
struction sites throughout the country. In the course of these 
two years, some 15,000 separate enterprises were transferred to 
republic jurisdiction. 
The policy suffered a fleeting setback in December 1956 when 
a plenary session of the Party Central Committee called for measures 
"to ensure a further extension of? the powere of ministries, chief 
directorates of ministries, soviets, and economic enterprises" in 
the name of "eliminating excessive centralization in management.," 
But the crisis passed quickly, and two months later the February 
(1957) Plenum of the Central Committee demanded a reorganization 
of industrial and construction administration "according to the 
territorial principle on the basis of definite economic eegions." 
Even then the scope of the proposed reform was not apparent; ii 
did not become apparent until late March when Khrushchev outlined 
his grand plan to scrap the existing functional, or ministerial,

approach to economic management and to return to the territorial-
production system which had dominated Soviet economic management 
during the 1920s. Although certain of Khrushchev's specific re-
commendations were abandoned in the subsequent legal enactments, 
there was no effective challenge to the main princiOles he pro-i 
pounded. The consequence was abolition of many functional economic 
ministries, the removal of direct significant managerial functions 
from All but two of the remaining industrial ministries (Medium 
Machine Building and Transport Construction), and the delegation 
of responsibility for industrial and construction work to sovnarkhozy 
in each of 105 economic regions. 
The entrance of Khrushchev's new system into operation on 
1 July marked the opening of a third major phase of organizational 
development in the Soviet scheme of indus'tr'ial management. During 
the earliest period of Soviet rule, while Lenin's personality still 
dominated and shaped the attitudes of the Communist Party's lead-
ing economic thinkers, the concept prevailed of large regional in-
dustrial conglomerates. These attitudes were Ixpressed organiza-
tionally and territorially in the formation of10-ge economic regions 
whose productive activity was arranged and coordinated by regional 
councils of national economy. Central direction and coordination 
were achieved througha Supreme Council of National Economy (VSNKh), 
which at the height of its authority during the period of War Commu-
nism (191'7120), acted as a central state institution for the general 
administration of all nationalized industry in the Soviet state. 
Although initially the authority of the VSNKh was ills-defined, 
it had by mid-1918 assumed control of industrial activity, with 
special emphasis on fulfillment of military orders for the Red Army. 
On the basis of this authority, it was able by year's end to abolish 
the principle of local supervision of industry and to introduce 
strict centalization. The largest and most important industries 
were' subordinated directly to agencies of the VSNKII; medium-size 
enterprises were jointly subordinated to VSNKh and local economic 
councils, and only small enterprises fell under local jurisdiction. 
After the New Economic Policy was adopted in 1921, the power 
of the VSNKh began? to decline. Industrial financing passed into 
the hands of the State Bank (Gosbank) in 1921, and denationalized 
industries fell outside the system of industrial control. In that

year, too, the Soviet government organized 22;478 trusts but placed 
only 133 of them under VSNKh jurisdiction. The remainder were as-
signed to local economic councils and other agencies. Further re-
organizations in 1923 and 1926 affirmed the competence of the VSNKh 
(1) to direct policy and to frame legislation for industry as a 
whole, and (2) to administer state industry. But the XVI Party 
conference, meeting in 1929, stripped the agency of the former func-
, 
tion and transformed it into an "organ of the actual technical ad-
ministration of industry." The VSNKh continued in this role, con-
ducting its operations through combines and trusts which in turn 
directed entire branches of industry, until 1932 when it was finally 
reorganized out of existence. In its place, the central government 
formed three industrial commissariats (ministries): the People's 
Commissariat of Heavy Industry, the People's Commissariat of Light 
Industry, and the People's Commisariat of the Timber and Woodwork-
ing Industry. The era of industrial functionalism at the ministerial 
level--of creating commissariats which governed the activities of 
individual and increasingly specialized branches of industry--had 
opened. 
, The years 1914-37 witnessed a short-lived attempt to revive 
the territorial-production principle. Criticisms of industrial 
management at the XVII Party Congress in 1934 led to the formation 
within commissariats of a number of chief directorates which ad-
ministrated their own branches of the conomy within defined territor-
ial limits. Operative industrial agencies, however, continued to 
exist within ministries, and the miOstries themselves remained 
organized along functional lines. Ai industrial production became 
increasingly specialized during the Second and Third Five-Year Plans 
there occurred not only a further narrowing of the competences of 
the economic commissariats and their division into a large number 
of specialized commissariats but a proliferation of independent 
chief directorates. By 1940 industrial administration had already 
passed to the hands of commissariats and to scores of chief 
directorates. The Soviet Union's entrance into World War II in-
terrupted but did not halt the trend; and in the early postwar years 
it was resumed with full vigor. A peak was reached in 1947 when 
59 individual all-union and union-republic ministries, 50 of which 
directed various aspects of Soviet economic life, were simultaneously

in being, A wave of economy led to the abolition or consolidation 
of 12 ministries in 1948 and 1949; but it passed and the process 
of ministerial atomization continued. 
, Stalin's passing momentarily reversed the trend. His 
anxious legatees, doubtless fearing the worst, moved quickly to 
consolidate their positions. On 7 March two days after Stalin died, 
Soviet leaders by merger and consolidation reduced the number of 
ministries from 60 to 25. However, the unwieldiness of the new 
administrative structure 'soon led to a new division of ministries. 
By April 1954 the number of ministries had increased to 46, and in 
1956 it had reached 52. Despite this new multiplication of functional 
administrative agencies. Khrushchev's rise to eminence in the Soviet 
leadership group brought with it an attack of mounting intensity 
against the rigidities and inefficiencies of the ministerial system 
of industrial administration. The basic themes were epitomized in 
a three-count indictment with which Krushchev in March 1957 pre-
faced the revelation of his plan to cupplant the existing_industrial 
ministries with a system of territorially organized economic councils. 
The most damaging point of-the indictment was Khrushchev's hint of 
a rising trend toward ministerial autarky. lnduirial ministries, 
he complained, "often seek to manufacture [for themselves] every-
thing they need," and erect departmental barriers which "disturb. 
normal economic connecti-ons between enterprises of different branches 
of industry" located within the same territorial unit. This system, 
he declared, had encouraged the growth of irrational construction, 
egocentric tendencies in ministerial planning, and ineffective 
utilization of the nation's industrial and manpower. resources. - 
in addition to such tendencies as these, Khrushchev argued, 
the ministerial system had promoted a growing isolation of manage-
ment from production. Not only were numerous directing agencies in 
Moskva located physically at great distances from the sites of 
production, but the ministries and their departments had also failed 
to make rational use of specialists and local nadrAs in the guidance 
of industry and construction. As his third point Khrushchev again 
singled out the Soviet Union's huge and growing bureaucratic machine 
for criticism and repeated his frequent demand for a reduction and 
simplification of the entire managerial apparatus. 
For Khrushchev's purposes, these faults constituted REL.%

facie evidence of the inability of the existing economic-adminis-
trative system--and the functional principle upon which it was based 
--to meet the requirements of future Soviet economic development. 
In that it had created a "powerful technical and material base, 
specialists, mature managers, and a large labor force," 'the system 
had served its purpose. But, he argued, it had also created 
"favorable conditions" and the need to return to the territorial 
principle in economic management. 
While Khrushchev's plans were presented to the public with 
the imperator of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
the Soviet Union and the USSR Council of Ministers after a discus-
sion which reportedly lasted for four Months, it was apparent that 
considerable disagreement existed as to details and fundamental 
principles. In his presentation Khrushchev pointedly referred to 
'certain Comrades'lwho had attempted to obstruct Party approval 
of the plan, and during the nationwide discussion of the plan, not 
a single prominent member of the "Stalinist" 'old guard lent public 
support to the reorganization proposal. In the provinces there 
appeared contending groups which vigorously debated the detils--
although not the principles--of the planned reorganization. By 
May, the opposition was ready to contest openly the principles of 
the plan itself. At the USSR Supreme Soviet Meeting two nonpolitic-
al specialists presented arguments for the preservation of the in-
dustrial ministries and continued centralization of economic manage-
ment, complaining that the "dismemberment [of industry] on a regional 
principle'( contradicted the economic experience of the most advanced 
industrial countries and that the dispersal of engineering and tech-
nical experience could result in grave setbacks to the' continued 
progress of Soviet industry. Faced with the opposition of at least 
some of his colleagues in the Presidium of the Party and the Argu-
ments of prominent experts, Khrushchev hedged. 
In his own report to the Supreme Soviet Khrushchev t'-etreated 
somewhat from his earlier stand, leaving some of his supporters

at both union and republic levels, he now admitted the need to re-
tain eight key industrial ministries connected with national de-
fense, but insisted that all but two of them, the ministries of

retain certain industrial ministries at the republic level. In its 
legislative enactments, the USSR Supreme Soviet promptly abolished 
25 industrial and construction ministries and ordered their enter-
prises transferred to the jurisdiction of appropriate sovnarkhozy. 
Two other ministries were merged out of existence, and eix of the 
eight remaining economic ministries were divested of operational 
control over industrial enterprises and trantformed into planning 
and coordinating organizations (see Figure 2-1). 
In the republics, similar scenes were enacted at Supreme 
Soviet sessions in late May and early June. The RSFSR Supreme 
Soviet abolished eight union-republic and two republic industrial 
ministries and reduced two from union-republic to republic status 
(see Figure 2-2). The Ukrainian Supreme Soviet abolished eleven 
union-republic-and two republic ministries and reduced one ministry 
from union-republic to republic status The Latvian Supreme Soviet 
liquidated six union-republic ministrieb, merged the republic 
ministries of Municipal Economy and Fuel and Local Industry into 
a single republic ministry of Municipal and Local Economy, and re-
designated an enlarged republic ministry of the Timber Industry as 
the republic ministry of the Foresfry and Timber Industry. The 
reorganization of industrial administration followed similar lines 
in the other republics (see Figure 2-3). 
Khurshchev's plans for the organization of the sovnarkhozy 
and the establishment of a new system of territorial economic ad-
ministration underwent a somewhat similar metamorphosis in the 
period between March and July. Even when the March theses were 
published, a plan for the territorial and administrative organ-
ization of the proposed new system had apparently been under dis-
cussion for several months at high Party and governmeOt levels. 
And as subsequent developments seemed to indicate, it had been

Part Two I. Political  
drawn up in considerable detail. But the theses limned only its 
main outlines. Three principles, nevertheless, emerged as decisive 
in the creation of the forthcoming arrangement of economic-territor-
ial units: 
1. Economic regions would be based primarily upon the country's 
largest industrial centers or upon foci of projected large-scale 
industrial investment; 
2. Despite the absence of industrial bases--and largely for lack 
of a suitable alternative?remote and territorially sr 
di -0- 
erbed arect 
would be organized as separate economic regions; and 
3. The boundaries of existing political-administrative divisions 
at oblast or superior levels would generally be respected. 
Khrushchev's report stipulated no specific number of econom-
ic regions, but it appeared from his explanation that most of the 
regions would consist either of entire republics or of oblast con-
glomerates in the largest andf-economically strongest republics. 
During the subsequent public discussion, the number cited rose 
from 50 to 70. And Khrushchev recommended 92--presumably 68 in the 
RSFSR, 11 in the Ukraine, and one each in the remaining 13 repub-
lics--in his report to the USSR Supreme Soviet in May. At the 
meetings of the republic Supreme Soviets which followed enactment 
of the new system into law at the USSR level, the number was raised 
to 105. The RSFSR increased the number of its economic administra-
tive regions from 68 to 701; the Kazakh Supreme Soviet organized 
9 regions, and the Uzbek body created four. Of the total 105 eco-
nomic regions which thus emerged from the reform, one encompassed 
a single city (Moskva), 77 embraced single oblasts or equivalent 
administrative-territorial units (autonomous ()blasts or autonomous 
soviet socialist republics), 16 were composed of more than one 
Oblast, and 11 comprised entire union republics (see Figure 2-4). 
In no case was the territorial integrity of an oblast or superior 
territorial administrative unit compromised. 
According to the new economic order, the sovnarkhozy, or-
ganized in each of the 105 economic regions, act as the basic 
1 No economic council was organized in the Tuvinskaya 
Autonomous Oblast, making Tuva the only ritgion of the USSR which 
does not participate in the new organization of industry and 
construction.

Part  Two I. Political  
agencies of Soviet economic administration in their areas. For all 
industrial and construction enterprises of greater than local sig-
nificance within their areas (and according to Soviet reports this 
accounts for 70 to 80 per cent of the total industrial production 
of each area) they function as supreme administrative, coordinating 
and planning agencies. For the USSR as a whole, the sovnarkhozy 
control enterprises producing three-fourths of the total volume of 
industrial output. They control the entire production of iron, 
metallurgical equipment; steam and gas turbines, and automobiles. 
Their administration covers enterprises supplying nearly all 
steel, rolled ferrous metals, oil, mineral fertilizers and cement, 
98 per cent of coal, 97 per cent of textiles, and more than 80 per 
cent of leather goods and footwear (for production data on selected 
sovnarkhozy, see Table A-3, Appendix). Moat of the remaining en-
terprises which produce the other 25 per cent of the USSRs indus-
trial output have been placed under the jurisdiction of local 
executive committees. However, certain plants, whose production 
is deemed vital to the national defense and which were named in 
a secret list prepared by the USSR Council of Ministers, remain 
under direct central administration. Within the framework of gen-
eral decisions, taken at higher levels, the sovnarkhozy have Te-
sponsibility for elaborating and thmplementing long-range and current 
production plans, for promoting industrial specialization within 
their regions, for arranging deliveries of raw materials and semi-
finished products within and between regions, and for determining 
the financial and economic activities of subordinate agencies 
(economic organizations, trusts, combines, and branch administra-
tions). 
The March theses did not spell out the organizational 
format through which these responsibilities would be discharged, 
but later proposals, advanced by prominent members of the 
Khrushchev team, laid bare the main organizational forms. These 
were later standardized and confirmed by the USSR Supreme Soviet 
and by appropriate republic Supreme Soviets. Although each of the 
organizational schemes differs from the others in detail, an obvious

as well as research and experimental institutes and designing bu-
reaus, appear as advisory bodies attached directly to the sovnarkhozy. 
Below the central apparatus of the sovnarkhozy are ranged a series 
of functional and industrial branch administrations and trusts. 
Where warranted, thepe agencies have also established their own 
research institutes and designing bureaus and, according to Khrushchev, 
will enjoy the right of operating on a self-sustaining basis (see 
Figure 2-5). In their administrative capacity, they are charged 
with direct control of the nation's factories and productive enter-
prises. 
Direct supervision and controi of the activities of the 
sovnarkhozy themselves will, according io the established Soviet 
principle of dual subordination, be exercised both by the govern-
ments of the union republics and by the government of the USSR. 
Territorial-administrative units below the republic level (oblasts, 
krays, ASSRs, etc. ) which are located within economic regions 
have the right to be informed of the activities of the sovnarkhozy, 
but they exercise no jurisdiction over them. At the republic level, 
supervision is exercised both through the formal system of subordina-
tion and through the appointment of chairmen (and in some cases, 
members) of the sovnarkhozy as members of the republic councils of 
ministers (see Figure 2-6). 
This system of control appears to be an outgrowth of Khrushchev's 
proposals for changes in the organization of the USSR Council of 
Ministers which faces on a larger scale the same problem of co-
ordination and supervision. In his theses, Khrushchev indicated 
three direct avenues of control and accountancy over the subordin-
ate economic agencies, and all three proposals'were' subsequently 
enacted into law. One was a suggestion that the chairmen of the 
15 inion'republic Councils of Ministers be admitted to the USSR 
Council of Ministersias ex-officio members, a situation which would 
make them immediately and directly accountable to the central govern-
ment for economic activities within their? republics. Khrushchev 
proposed further that the head of the State Statistical Board, 
which will have sole charge of statistical accounting in the USSR, 
also be seated on the Council. And he argued lastly for admission 
to the Council not only of the Chairman of the State Planning 
Commission (Gosplan) but the vice chairmen and heads of the most

important divisions of that agency. Since these persons (who will 
enjoy ministerial rank) are in many cases the former directors of 
liquidated industrial ministries, their entrance into the Council 
of Ministers has created within the Council what amounts to a sub 
council of individuals who have long been associated with the prob-
lems of economic planning, control, and management, 
Aside from its direct association with ministerial control 
of industrial development, the enhanced status of Gosplan accords 
With that body's expected rise in importance both as a planning 
and coordinating agency and as an indirect agent of central control 
over the activities of local economic councils. As in the past 
Gosplan is destined to play its chief role in the sphere of plan-
ning. It will continue to draft integrated national economic 
plans on the basis both of the national economic interest as 
defined by leading Party and governmental bodies and of economic 
pians drawn up at subordinate levels by economic councils and re-
public Gosplans. Its plans, Khrushchev pointed out, must envisage 
a proper and rational distribution of the Soviet Union's productive 
forces, regional industrial specialization, the establishment of 
economic bonds between regions, and the integrated development of 
economic areas in terms both of current productive possibilities 
and of future national economic requirements 
In the Khrushchev view, Gosplan's capacity to plan also 
provides a rationale for a broadening of its powers and operative 
functions. If Gosplan constructs a national plan, he argued in 
his theses, it must have the'responsibility for the fulfillment of 
that plan. If its plans provide for interregional deliveries of 
goodsand services, it must exer6se "control over the strict 
observance of state discipline" regarding such deliveries. If its 
task is the promotion through planning 'of 'a unified national economy, 
it must be empowered to "nip in the bud" every tendency toward the 
development of regional autarkie4. 
The precise form .which such powers would ultimately take 
remained an open question in midsummer 1957. The reorganization 
law, enacted at the May session of the USSR Supreme Soviet, charged 
the USSR-Gosplan with responsibility to conduct thorough studies 
of the needs of the national economy, to elaborate current and 
long-range eopnomic plans, to ensure the proper distribution of

production forces throughout the country, and to plan the distribu-
tion of material and technical supplies on a nation-wide scale. 
But neither the March theses, the ensuing newspaper discussion of 
Gosplan's role, nor the reorganization law made provision for Gos-
plan inspection of economic activities at the local level; and the 
theses specifically denied the agency the right to interfere in the 
administrative management of the economic administrative areas. 
At the USSR level its sole coercive weapon remained its right "6 
submit major questions for consideration" to the USSR Council of 
Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communtsf Party. 
The subsequent discussion of Gosplan's role in the RSFSR 
and the Ukrainian ,SSR provides a somewhat greater degree of enlighten-
ment. At the Fourth Session of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet, Yasnov 
declared not only that the RSFSR Gosplan must supervise continually 
the fulfillment of state plans but that it must "take operative 
measures" through the sovnarkhozy and ministries "to overcome any 
lag revealed in individual economic administrative regions or branches. 
Independently and with complete responsibility for matters entivsted 
[to it]," he pointed out, "the Gosplan of the RSFSR must solve opera-
tional questions linked with guaranteeing fulfillment of the state 
plan.q To solve at least one part of the problem of supervision 
at the operative level, the Ukrainian government organized under 
the republic Gosplan three specialized supply departments for the 
purpose of achieving ta "unified system of material-technicil supply" 
fbr enterprises and building sites. According to the plan) these 
three departments-6-raw materials and materials, equipment, and supply 
organization and the control of material resources utilizaiion--
exercise control over 18 republic supply-distribution administrations 
whit+ in turn allocate moierials imported from other union-republics 
and export goods to other republics according to the national economic 
plan. 
, Although many details of the new economic dispensation re-
mained clouded in the summer of 1957, the legislative enactments 
of the USSR Supreme Soviet and the republic Supreme Soviets drew 
the main outlines of the 8oviet Union's new system of economic 
management. Despite Khrushchev's emphasis upon decentralization, 
it was clear that the newisystem was aimed at increasing the effec-
, 
tiveness -of centralized.domination of. the.USSR economy. . In this 
it spelled a return to the. Leninist principle that centralism is 
best realized through an organizational system which features

centralization of the decision-making process and decentralization 
of the execution of decisions. The removal of agencies, involved 
directly in production, from the center will certainly relieve 
the top leadership of much of the welter of administrative detail 
which has tended in the past to obscure and to obfuscate their 
participation in the crucial processes of rational policy forma-
tion at the national level. At the same time, the retention of 
eight all-union ministries, involved in defense and defense-related 
production, will continue to afford the central authorities a direct 
channel of supervision and control over many of the most critical 
branches of industry. Moreover, the crucial features of central-
ized control--centralized planning, ttle allocation of fixed and 
working capital, centralized price fixing, and control over distribu-
tion--have been strengthened and reinforced. 
At the same time the authority and prestige of republic 
governments--and of republic Party organizations, since these bodies 
in practice will advance candidates for leading positions in the 
new administrative agencies--in economic matters has? been enhanced 
considerably. This is the crux of the decentralization, for the 
republic governments and, to some extent, the sovnarkhozy rill 
doubtless be called upon to exercise many of the routine adminis-
trative functions now performed at the USSR ministerial level. 
Economic policy formation of a restricted nature will also be pos-
sible at the republic level, but it will be geared closely to de-
cisions taken previously at the center. 
Whether regional economic management will actually create 
a greater degree of economic efficiency, as Khrushchev has argued, 
is a question that will receive no final answer for many years. 
Elements of greater efficiencywere present in the removal of economic 
directing agencies and theltransfer of an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 
officials to the scenes of production and in the latitude given 
to regional economic councils to solve local economic problems. 
But tendencies toward bureaucratic empire-building and industrial 
self-sufficiency are inherent in the Soviet system of production 
and distribution. The new economic dispensation will not eliminate 
them; it will merely postpone them and transfer them from the 
ministerial to the territorial level.

complications, confusion and even a certain amount of passive re-
sistance are inevitable. The ink was hardly dry on the RSFSR re-
organization law before a' sovnarkhoz official was complaining that 
neighboring government agencies were refusing to deliver needed 
industrial supplies. In other cases, it was reported that trained 
specialists and technicians were? being relieved of production re-
sponsibilities so that they might serve as administrators in the 
sovnarkhozy and the chairman of ehe sovnarkhoz protested in July 
that only 18 of 83 specialists requisitioned from Moskva had reported 
for duty. These and other reports reveal also that certain of the 
remaining all-union and republic industrial ministries have resisted 
orders to turn over agencies to local control and that supply and 
distribution organizations are in a turmoil. 
While economic considerations appear to have furnished the 
major motivating force for the reform, strategic military con-
siderations may well have played an auxiliary role. From a purely 
military standpoint, reversion to the territorial productive princi-
ple in economic organization will probably represent a net gain for 
the defensive capabilities of the USSR, even though the new economic 
regions do not appear to be coordinated with the'-odd Soviet mil-
itary districts. Within the present century, Russia has learned 
two costly and historic lessons concerning the military importance 
of a proper distribution of its manpower and productive capacity. 
Defeat in the Russo-Japanese war showed the country's leaders the 
necessity for creating an independent economic Oase in the Far East; 
and Soviet planners took cognizance of the lesson by investing 
heavily in the economy of Trans-Baykal and the Maritime regions 
during the early Five-Year Plans. World War. II demonstrated the" 
necessity' 
necessity for creating a stable economic base'in the middle regions 
of Siberia and Central Asia; and this objective constitutes the 
critical goal of the Sixth Five-Year Plan. Khrushchev's system, 
therefore, represents a continuation of this trend in that if en-
visages the establishment of regional economic entities capable of 
continuing production even though some of their number are lost or 
communication between them is interrupted. "If-this is how bourgeois 
politicians understand our reorganizationfh Khrushchev commented, 
"we shall not deny it."

3. ,gOvernment Control Centers  
The growth of USSR major and alternate government control 
centers and their distribution among the various administrative 
divisions reflect accurately economic development in the U$SR.1 
Analysis of the political significance and subordination of these 
control centers provides an excellent guide for determining channels 
of control over the peoples and economy of the Soviet Union. In 
general, there has been a significant increase in the number of 
major and alternate control centers since 19O, reflecting increased 
' urbanization and industrialization accompanied by an increase 
of administrative divisions in economically important areas, 
The capitals of 14- union republics and all cities of union-
republic subordination in the RSFSR and Ukrainskaya SSR are the 
Soviet Unions most important major government control centers and 
may be considered alternate control centers for Moskva. In addi-
tion to their all-union political and economic significance, most 
of these cities have Major military, transportation, and/or power 
control functions. Headquarters for 10 of the 20 military districts, 
19 of the 45 railroad systems, and 23 of 'the 1+5regional power 
systems in the USSR are located within these cities (see Table 
2-112). The USSR military establishment could be directed from 
any of these military headquarters, if the national headquarters 
in Moskva were incapacitated. 
Of the total number of major and alternate control centers, 
more than half are located in the RSFSR (see Table 2-1113 and Map MI 
including 47 per cent of major centers and 67 per cent of alternate 
centers. The largest concentrations are found in the Central 
Industrial Region, particularly in and around Moskovskaya Oblast, 
and the Urals. Outside the RSFSR the greatest concentration is 
in the Ukrainskaya SSR, which contains 37 per cent of all centers 
in the other 14 republics. 
1Major control centers house executive agencies which exercise 
direct control over the population and all types of economic and 
civic activity within major administrative subdivisions of the USSR. 
They include union republic, ASSR, kray, and oblast capitals. 
Alternate control centers exercise administrative control 
over lesser areas. They contain skeletal prototypes of executive 
agencies in major centers and would probably assume the control 
functions of major centers if the latker were incapacitated. They 
include autonomousoblast and okrug capitals, and all urban centers 
of union republic, ASSR, kray, oblast, autonomous oblast, and okrug 
suboi-dination. (For complete list see Table A-1, Appendix).

The most significant changes in the number and distribution

in the Urals, Central Industrial, Western Siberian, and Eastern

II. _EMOTION AND MANPOWER  
A. Total Population  
1. Variations in Soyiet Policies on Statistics  
Judging by their guarded secrecy, the Soviet government of 
the Stalinist era attributed far more significance to their popula-
tion statistics than did any other government in the world. The 
presumable motive of withholding military and-ecOnomic information 
from potential -enemies was apparently reinforced by a desire to 
conceal certain facts (such as the extent of population 
imam 
4,WWW 
the period of enforced collectivization) from the Soviet people 
themselves. And as a corollary to the policy of suppression, and 
in direct contrast to Russia's advances in other fields of science, 
the study of population within the Soviet Union was pursued on? an 
exceedin2ly primitive level. 
The policy of suppressing population and manpower statistics 
was rigorously pursued in the late 1930s. The regular statistical 
series on wage and salary earners did not appear after 1936, and 
the all-union population census of 1937 was suppressed in toto. 
Only summary data comprising less than ten pages were released from 
the all-union census of 1939, in striking contrast to the publica-
tion in some 50 volumes of the 1926 census results. A year later, 
on the eve of the German invasion, an official handbook on education-
al statistics appeared. Understandably, only scraps of data were

tory encompassed an area which previously had been inhabited by 
some 85 million persons; and one aspect of the severe disruption 
of life during this period was the impossibility of collecting and 
publishirig population data. 
Although a scattering of material appearing in the reconstruc-
tion period of 194547 included several significant items, it seem-
ingly was a selective presentation. Aieksandrov, the director of 
the Communist Party's propaganda and agitation organization, stated 
on 22 January 1946 that the Soviet Union's population totaled 193 
million, a figure which indicates that war losses were 15 million 
below those now implied by official Soviet'data' Various demographers 
have observed that Aleksandrov's figure corresponds to the announced 
prewar population of the Soviet Union. It was presented as if it

were the then current population, however, and included a rein-
forcing remark that 100 million had been born since the Revolution. 
This latter figure could not have been derived from the previous 
Soviet all-union census of 1939 so must have been derived from a 
new estimate. 
In March 1946 Stalin announced, as a result of the German 
invasion the Soviet Union has irrevocably lost...about 7 million 
people." The Soviet historian Tarle in a 1947 broadcast from Moskva 
then spoke of the "7 million Soviet soldiers (italics added) who 
laid down thAir livec [in the war]." Stalin wAs thmt 
total losses amounted to 7 million, even specifying the individual 
categories, yet lane's specified loss of 7 million soldiers is 
more in conformance with western estimates of Soviet military 
casualties. 
It is difficult to distinguish between lack of data and 
attempts at deception during this period. Aleksandrov may not have 
had new data on the size of the total population, but he certainly 
knew that it was not 193 million, as stated. Stalin cannot possi-
bly have had accurate war loss data, but he certainly knew that 
war losses were higher than 7 million. And if one conjectures that 
Stalin was deliberately being deceptive, he then is faced with 
explaining why lane was permitted to criticize western interpreta-
tions of Stalin's statement. 
It is evident, however, that precise population data were 
not available as late as 1 7. In that year it was announced that 
the Academy of Medical Science and the Ministry of Public Health 
were to investigate and study Soviet vital rates and their trends, 
migration, and the effects of war on the population. The results 
of this planned study were never released, although 1950 marked the 
end of the Fourth Five-Year Plan. 
Although reconstruction was certainly essentially completed 
by 1948-49 and it is known that important measures were being taken 
to improve the internal flow of data concerning rural pop:dation 
and labor force to branches of the Soviet government, such material 
was not published. In this period, too, Soviet statisticians attempted 
to conceal and distort the wartime birth deficit by reporting only 
total enrollment in schools after 1949. Instead of reporting enroll-
ment in the general school (grades 1-10) separately, as had been

the Soviet practice, to the number in the general school were added 
students in tekhnikums and related institutions. A similar decep-
tion was practiced with regard to housing: in order to cloak the 
serious housing shortage Soviet statisticians reported total re-
sidential floor space rather than living space (which excludes 
certain nonliving areas). Western scholars, however, recognized 
these deceptions, and in recently published Soviet literature the 
true situation has been delineated. 
Stalin's last days represent the nadir of social science 
statistins in the qovictrt Union, when the policy of suppression 
reached an all-time peak. Outright deception, however, seems to 
have been the exception rather than the rule; rather, the figures 
were manipulated, and even manipulated figures must? have some basis 
in reality. Infinitely more important than the instances of out-
right deception was the failure to publish data. Virtually the 
whole flow of information was cut off, which, in effect, amounted 
to deception. The picture that emerges in Stalin's last days is 
of a government unwi 1 ling to face real i ty?the enormity of war 
losses, the enormity of the birth deficit, unparalleled in the 
history of any modern nation, and the economic and social con-
sequences of a rutal population seriotiSly depleted of males in the 
prime of life. 
Not until 1955-56 was the policy of suppressing population 
data relaxed. Previously unpublished statistics from the 1939 
census were released and in 1956 the first of a new series of 
official handbooks, Narodnoye khozyaysitSSS9,.appeared. This 
handbook included general data on population and manpower as :well 
as data on vital rates which had not been published regularly since 
the late 1920s. It was followed in rapid succession by Sovetskaya  
torgovlya, doling primarily with trade by., including rates which 
make it possible to infer a 1955/ distribution of Soviet population 
among the ?blasts,'and- J.L.ILtuinme.L_troitelstvo., which presented 
an abundance of' material on education at the general and higher

centers; and a new edition of IlalzingmislauxultajgElAich in-
cludes population figures for all ()blasts of the USSR and 1956 
birth and death rates. A bulletin or pamphlet dealing explicitly 
with Soviet population (Naseleniyeigle was to have been published 
in the first quarter of 1957 and may already be available in the 
Soviet Union. This publication is to include data on Soviet popom 
ulation and its distribution by administrative divisions, including 
the urban-rural distribution of the population of each oblast. 
Still more important, the Soviet government apparently is going 
ahead with plans for 'a new all-union populaon census, which is 
plant* for January 1959. 
It is important to ascertain how post-Stalin policies differ 
from those of his last days. The most significant difference seems 
to be in the increased availability of data. In reading some of 
the new books, hciwever7 one still has the impression that the Soviet 
world is being viewed through a screen held selectively upon differ-
ent aspects of Soviet life. In a few cases it can be demonstrated 
that Soviet statisticians are aitempting to conceal the facts, as 
in the case of the crude labor force percentages presented in 
N rod o e Khoz a stvo U1(1956), although in this instance the 
very primitiveness of the definitions is also impressive. 
Fortunately, there are few such instances surprisingly enough, 
some of the leading relics of the Stalinist era, such as the contrived 
1939 social classification of population repurted in most earlier 
Soviet writings on population, are excluded from the new materials. 
In general, however, the new data are imperfect and approximate, 
are often crudely expressed, and lack the methodological footnotes 
and technical explanations befitting a modern demographic study. 
An outstanding exception appears in Sovetskaya torgovlyal where a 
footnote indicates that percentages have been computed before round-
ing the basic figures--a type of technical detail which virtually 
disappeared from Soviet works during the last two decades. 
The proposed 1959 census will undoubtedly be held, for the 
Soviet Union desperately needs population and manpower data for 
planning purposes in view of the new strains now apparent in her 
economy, a situation which will soon worsen when remnants of the 
wartime and immediate postwar deficit years enter the labor force. 
It is doubtful, however, that the forthcoming census will be published

Soviet domination. 
2. Total POulation: 1958  
Extrapolation of official Soviet population data indicate 
a population of 206.3 million, as of 1 January 1958. This figure 
is utilized throughout The 1958 Annual Estimates, despite evidence 
that the official Soviet estimate of 200.2 million for April 1956, 
used as a base, involves an underenumeration of 1 to 10 million. 
The decision to use the Soviet figure is motivated by two practical 
considerations, apart from the obvious gain in terms of convenience 
and usefulness in maintaining direct comparability among various 
types of Soviet data: 1) there are no data which. yield a firm. 
estimate of the."true" population; and 2) although some data at 
the national level suggest the general magnitude of underenumer-, 
ation, none has been found usable in terms of differential distri-
bution of the assumed underenumeration among administrative divisions 
of the USSR. 
Evaluation. The "official" Soviet population figures for 
1950-56 are based on a system of population registers which 
are subject to many errors of omission and incorrect registration. 
Populations of isolated areas and the most mobile groups (e.g., 
young adult in-migrants to cities) are often omitted; certain seg-
ments of the population are omitted in part, as in the underregi-
stration of births and deaths and the failure to register children 
of migrants even when ti.e parents are registered. Incorrect regi-
stration mainly cpncerns the double registration of an individual, 
in particular some migrants who are counted both as residents of 
the.areas which they leave and residents of the areas into which 
they migrate Intentional errors are also included, as in the 
failure "?o report manpower on collective farms in order to minimize 
the labor supply which might have to be released for other state 
uses, and the failure to register births out of wedlock to avoid 
the stigma of such births and to make it possible for these children 
to use their father's name. 
At local levels, efforts apparently are made io adjust the 
registration data. The recording secretary of the local selsovet

Part Two II. Population and Manpower  
is instructed to reconcile his own registry of birth5and deaths, 
?name by name, against the official listing prepared by the agency 
in charge of registering vital statistics. This type of reconcili-
ation, however, cannot possibly influence the errors which lie out-
side the scope of both systems. With regard to the more important 
errors, such as those pertaining to population groups on the move, 
double listings for checking purposes are not available to the local 
authorities. And the massive agglomerations of populations at 
higher levels preclude any name-by-name crosschecking. Although a 
tear-off coupon system is in effect for "permanent" migrants to 
and from cities, Soviet authorities, including Boyarskiy (1955), 
consider the data Oh migrants defective and unreliable. 
At the national level, it would appear to be still more 
difficult to rectify the Soviet registration data, in view of the 
increased scope of the problAm;Ii  
and .the lack ^A^^garn 
muuw4vugv 
ing adjustments made at lower levels. Samples could be employed, 
but thene is only fragmentary evidence that this type of sample of 
population has been made in the Soviet Union. And, since the first 
edition of Narodnoy.e. khozyayetvo,SSSR s"sent for typesetting on 
,6 April 1956," time considerations also militate against precise 
adjustments. The registry data are collected as of 1 January and 
forwarded to the regional statistical offices by 28 January. This 
leaves little time for processing and analysis at the all-union 
level. Furthermore, final tabulatbns on births and deaths' apparently 
are not available until several months after the preliminary tabu-
lations are obtained. Thus, in April 1951+ Mikoyan reported a death 
rate for 1953 of 8.9 per 1,000 inkabitants. Narodno-elvo 
two years later reported a figure for 1953, presumably the result 
of a more complete tabulation, of 9.0 per 1,000. Also, in January 
1957 a death rate of 8.2 per 1,000 was reported for the year 1955, 
as compared with the figure of 8.14 per 1,000 for the same year re-
ported in Narodnoye khozyaystvo in April 1956. 
To the above points must be added the apparent unconcern 
of Soviet authorities for glaring inaccuracies in their population 
statistics. For example, in Narodnomel, the 1940 popu-
lation of the Soviet Union by official estimate is reported 
no 
191.7 million, excluding "the areas given to Poland by the treaty 
of 1945 which had a population of 1.4 million persons." When in

Part ?Two II. Population 04 Manpower  
Moskva, Warren Eason, of Princeton University, queried the respon-
sible Soviet authority as to the time reference for the estimate 
and was told that it was an "annual average for 1940" and specif-
ically that it included the natural increase of the population 
within the 1939 Soviet boundaries. Comparison of returns from the 
1939 census for republics ,not affected by the bound4ry changes 
and Soviet annexations reveals that the data cited inhitmlauft 
,khozyaystvo for 1940 are identical to the 1939 census returns? for 
these areas. Furthermore, "1940" population data derived from 
Sovetskaya torgovlya for oblasts and selected cities are identical 
to data of the 1939 census in cases where no internal boundary 
changes occurred. The effect of this exclusion of the natural 
irderease within the 1939 boundaries is to understate the true 
1 population within these boundaries by at least 3 million. 
Estimated Underenumeration. It is not possible to study 
available data without obtaining an impression of signi-
ficant inaccuracies, and errors of underenumeration appear to out-
weigh those of overenumration. Characteristically in population 
counts underenumeration tends to outweigh overenumerat ion, even 
in modern censuses. The most objective Ota pertinent to the 
problem are Soviet statistics showing the birth rate in the 1950-55 
period and regular statistics covering school enrollment and 
eligible voters. These materials maybe 'used to build up an esti-
mate of the age composition of the Soviet population which can be 
used to assess the size of the total population. The 0-6 age group 
is estimated from-the reported birth rates; the 7-17 age group is 
derived from school enrollment data; and the population age 18 and 
above, from lists of eligible voters. Unfortunately, these compon-
ents cannot beiestimated with precision, partly as a result of the 
need for modifying the materials to allow for underregistration of 
births, for infant and child mortality between birth and age 6, 
and for adults legally ineligible to vote. An estimaie derived in 
this way, however, implies that the reported population for 1956 
underrepresents the trcie population by 3 to 10 million. If this 
is the degree of underenumeration, the performance of the Soviet 
authorities should be commended, for the error would amount to only 
2.5=5 per cent. Even full-fledged population censuses often yield 
far from perfect results, as indicated by the fact that in the U.S.,

the annual rate of natural increase of population for 1950-55 is 
also reported, which makes it possible to impute an "official es-
timate" of the size of the USSR's population in 1950 and subse-
quent years to 195'6. 
World War I'and Civil War. Russia had an average annual 
growth of only 0.354- per cent from 1913 to 1926, and the 
population loss involved in this low rate of increase can better 
be appreciated if one compares the actual population in 1926 with 
the expected population on the basis of "normal" trends in the 
rate of growth of population of 1.66 per cent per annum. The ex-
pected population of 1926 would have been 172 million, in compar-
ison with the population enumerated in the 1926 census of 147 
million. The difference of 25 million can be attributed to the 
excess deaths of the subsequent Civil War and its attendant as-
pects of famine and widespread epidemics. The major components 
of the figure, exceeding 20 million, were civilian excess deaths 
and birth deficits. Military casualties and emigration together 
amounted totonly about -i-'million of the total loss. 
Collectivization and Famine. The rate of population 
growth in the period 1926-1939 was much higher than in 
1913-1926, and amounted to 1.3 per cent annum. Nevertheless, the 
actual population shown by the census in 1939 was 6 million below 
the expected population. This 6 million represents losses from 
the Soviet collectivization program of the early 1930's partic-
ularly from famine. 
World War II. The Second World War not only swallowed up 
the whole natural increase of Soviet population between 
1940 and 1950, but also led to an outright decline of population. 
If the reported Soviet population data for the prewar and postwar 
years are assumed to be accurate, the decline of population would 
amount to 0.6 per cent per annum. The 1 Soviet population 
figure reported intNarodnoye ktmaxlialuir is known to be in-
correct, however, and a better estimate than the reported 191.7 
million probably would be 196 million. In the absence of the war, 
the Soviet population could have been expected to increase by at 
least 1.5 per cent per annum, the decline in the death rate off-
setting or more than offsetting the decline in the birth rate. 
Given this hypothesis, the population in 1950 would be expected 
to number about 225 million persons, or 45 million more than the

figure of 180 million to be derived from Soviet data. If, on the 
other hand, the figure of 180 million represents an underenumer-
ation of 3-10 million, the implied population deficit in the war 
and immediate postwar period decreases to 35-42 million. 
School enrollment statistics covering the first four grades 
of school in 1950-56 indicate a decrease in the number of children 
by 11 million as of 1950 if compared with the prewar period, as a 
consequence mainly of birth deficit and to a lesser extent of excess 
mortality in the years 1943-50. Migratory losses amounted to 3 
million, military losses are reported to have been 7 million, and 
civilian losses are thought to have constituted about 10 million. 
The sum of these groups exceeds 30 million, although the extent to 
which the estimate of civilian losses may exclude or include other 
known losses not directly related to the war is not clear. indirect 
losses include excess mortality resulting from terroristic practices 
by the Soviet government in deporting various groups as well as 
excess mortality of inmates of Soviet concentration camps, the ex-
cess mortality in the immediate postwar period of servicement total-
ly disabled during the war, and excess mortality from the drought 
and other causes in 1946-47. Despite the enormity of the? figure,

2 million in 1948. The combined increase for 1947,a0i under these 
assumptions, was 6-7 million. It is doubtful that any increase of

a net decrease of population as a result of the drought-created 
famine 
in the western regions of the USSR in that year. Also, it 
seems likely that the death rate in 1946 would be inflated by excess 
mortality of totally disabled soldiers who, characteristically, have 
an extremely high death rate in the years immediately following 
disablement. 
1950116... Between 1950 and 1956 the average annual growth 
of Soviet population, following official Soviet data, was 
1.8 per cent. The high level of the immediate prewar period had 
once again been reached. The main factor in this high rate of 
growth was the strikingly low death rate, whereaa before World War 
II the high rate was the product of a high birth rate and a high 
death rate. 
1956-62. The rate of population growth in the Soviet Union 
is expected to taper off between 1956 and 1958 and decrease 
even more in the 1958-62 period, under the assumption of a gradual 
decline in fertility, while the low level of death rate remains 
constant or even increases somewhat owing to an increased propor-
tion of older persons in the population. However, in these two 
periods there is no reason to expect any drastic change in popula-
tion growth, whereas in the years that follow a sharp reduction 
in the rate of population increase is anticipated. The number of 
potential parents will be drastically reduced as those born during 
the war and postwar birth-deficit years begin to enter the marrying 
ages (the main child-bearing period is from ages 20 through 34). 
The first significant wartime birth deficit year was 1943; this 
reduced cohort will become age 20 in 1963 and in successive sub-
sequent years will be joined by at least two more age cohorts 
drastically reduced by birth deficits in the years of their birth. 
Thereafter, the number of potential parents will stabilize at a 
somewhat higher level. 
4, g,ftilamphic Distribution of USSR Population. 
The Soviet handbook, Sovetskaya torgovlya (1955), presents 
data expressing relationships between population and various aspects 
of trade. Although the relationships are expressed in the form of

statistics have been derived for the USSR as a whole, for its con-
stituent republics, and for autonomous areas and oblasts for 1939/40 
and 055 (see Table A4, Appendix). Comparison of the total pop-
ulation figure of 197,539,000 derived from data in the trade volume 
with the figure 200.2 million reported in ImplIngyftmmatta 
in April 1956 suggests that the 1955 statistids refer to the middle 
(1 July) of 1955. 
Despite evidence of the existence of underenumerationl the 
1955 geographic distributions of population derived from Soviet 
estimates are considered fairly accurate representations of the 
true geographic distribution of population. This statement, how-
ever, should be qualified in two important ways:, 1) Soviet popula-
tion estimates for 1955 (as shown in Table A4), as well as more 
summary data by union republics for 1956, shown in Nar261401 
IllauLaylly9Apildo not reflect the actual distribution of the 
population; and 2) underenumeration tends characteristically to 
have significant area differentials. 
A de facto, or actual, population count is an enumeration 
of the population present in a given area at a given time. An 
alternative method of counting, often utilized in population cen-
suses, is to assess the number of legal residents, or de jurt 
population. Soviet practice represents a combination of these two 
methods. Thus, in the' 1939 census, forced laborers were not listed 
as inhabitants of the places in which they were actually located 
in 1939, but as inhabitants of their birthplaces or places of trial 
or arrest. Military personnel, on the other hand, are thought to 
have been included in the census in terms of their actual residence, 
except in the case of naval p4sonne1, where the base of operation 
was used as the place of legal residenm. Since the "1940" Soviet 
data in reality are a reproduction of the results of the 1939 cen-
sus, it is obvious that these figures as reported in Table Aal-
are comparable in definition to the 1939 census. The same appears 
true with the 1955 and 1956 population data. Thus, the reported 
population by union republics adds exactly to the reported all-
union population (a de facto count would show about 500,000 
Soviet citizens residing abroad). Also, in the case or the stu-
dent and voting populations it is known that a de facto enumeration 
procedure is followed. Comparison of voters and school children

by union republic with SoViet estimates of total population in each 
republic reveal glaring discrepancies* For example, in Estonia the 
voting and student populations alone constitute more than 90 per 
cent of the reported population, which could not possiblii be true. 
The explanation is that undoubtedly the population estimates do 
not represent de facto enumOrations. 
Underenumeration tends characteristically to have signi-
? ficant area differentials*? For example, on the eve of World War 
II it was reported that underenumeration of population in the Soviet 
Union was greatest within the more backward areas. Also, election 
data underrepresent the population more in the areas of most rapid 
population increase. 
Projection of Data, 1955-58.. Soviet data showing the geo-
graphic distribution of population by oblast were projected to 
?J January 1958 as follows: 
? 1., The rate of population increase 1955-56, derived from 
1955 oblast data appearing in Sovetskaya torgovlya and 1956 data 
in Laadnilyt_khaatatto (1956), was used to project the 1956 
population to 1 January 1958. 
2. Certain adjustments were made to allow for the repatri-
ation of ethnic groups deported in 1943-14 from North Caucasus areas. 
3. The figures were then forced to the previously calculated 
republic totals. 
Results. The geographic distribution of population 
in 1939/40, 1955, and 1958, presented in detail in 
Table Ali., are summarized in Tables 2-15, 2-16, and 2-17. 
Table 2-15 shows the distribution of USSR population by 
broad areas. While European USSR still accounts'for' the great mass 
of the Soviet Union's population, its share of the national total 
dropped from 82.2 per cent in 1939 to 78.5 per cent in 1955. Mean-
while, Asiatic Russials proportion increased from 17.8 to 21.5 per 
cent. Between 1939 and 1955 Asiatic USSR had an average annual 
growth of populati'on' of about 2 percent, as compared with only 1.6 
per cent in the prewar period 1926-39* This difference resulted 
from prewar collectivization losses in Kazakhstan; and considering 
Asiatic USSR apart from Kazakhstan, the average annual rate of 
population growth in the 1926-39 period was 2.9 per cent, or 
more than double the 1939-55 rate of the same area of 1.3 per cent 
per year.

Part Two 1,14.22:1.21 and Manpower , 
Two factors have been of prime importance in the eastward 
shift of the Soviet Union's center of population: 1) The incidence 
of war losses was much higher in European Russia; and 2) there has 
been a steady flow of migants from the western to the eastern 
territories. With the present emphasis on the industrialization 
of Siberia and Kazakhstan and with continuing agricultural colon-
ization connected in part with ihe new lands program, it can be 
expected that Asia's share in the over-all population of the \USSR 
will continue to grow. 
The decline in European Russia's proportion of the Soviet 
Union's populatbn can best be understood through a discussion of 
its various regions (see Tables 2-16 and 2-417). Four areas of 
European Russia--the Central Industrial Region of the RSFSR, and 
the Ukrainskaya, Belorusskaya, and Litovskaya,SSRs--have a lower 
population and consequently represent a less significant segment 
of the USSR total than in 1939/40. In all cases this results 
primarily from the heavy concentration of war losses in these areas 
during World War di., Even in recent years, however, their Share 
of the national whole has declined. 
Except for the Central Industrial Region, populations of the 
territories of the European RSFSR have increased. In the North-
western Region the rate of increase was above the national average 
in the 1939/40-55 period but during 1955-58 was below average, In 
the Southeastern Region the growth was above average in both periods 
while in the Volga Region it was below average. 
Population within the two Baltic republics of Latvia and 
Estonia increased more slowly than did the over-all population of 
the Soviet Union in the earlier period. War losses were heavy in 
both areas, but Russian in-migration tended to counteract their 
depressive effect. Since 1955, the population of Latvia has con-
tinued to increase, while that of Estonia has remained static. 
The rate of growth in the Transcaucasian republics was be-
low average between 1939 and 1955, except in the Armyanskaya,SSR 
which in the years 1946-47 received a large number of immigrants. 
Since 19555 however, Armenia's and Azerbaydzhan's growth has been 
considerably above that of the USSR as a whole, although in Georgia 
where the natural increase is relatively low for the area the rate 
has been below the national average.

Asiatic Russia's relatively high rate of population in-
crease is reflected in all of its regions. Without exception the 
rate of growth has been above the national average. Of the various 
regions of the Asiatic RSFSR, the Far East grew most rapidly in the 
earlier period, while West Siberia showed the greatest growth in 
the later period. In both cases in-migration was a significant 
factor in the increase. Two other factors in West Siberia's 
growth have been the new lands and the eastern industrialization 
programs. 
Of the areas of Asiatic Russia outside the RSFSR, Kazakhstan 
shows the mpst rapid rate of growth. It has risen from fifth to 
third place in number of inhabitants while its proportion of the 
over-all population will have increased from 3.2 per cent to an 
estimated 4..3 per cent by 1 January 1958. In the World War II 
period this growth resulted largely through the evacuation of pop-
ulation? from the threatened western border regions of the USSR, 
and in the postwar years through agricultural colonization and 
immigration to the republic's rapidly growing industrial centers, 
Of all the areas of Asiatic Russia, the republics of Central 
Asia show the lowest rate of population increase. In the earlier 
period many wartime evacuees from European Russia came into the area, 
but the great majority returned to their homes after the war. 
Since 1955, the concentration on the development of Siberia and 
Kazakhstan has probably drawn off many of the migrants that other-
wise would have come to Central Asia. Consequently, net in-migration 
has been low, exercising a restraining influence on population 
growth. 
Population Redistribution Produced by Calamities and Migra-
tion. The existence of data for 1939/40 and for 1955 
makes it possible to study thee-geographic redistribution of Soviet 
population within a'1&1/2. year period. if each subarea of the. 
Soviet Union' had increased by the same proportion as did-the total 
population of the Soviet Union. in the -1939-55 'period, the geo-
graphic distribution of the. population would ,have remained constant. 
This hypothetical assumption. is used to measure actual differences 
in the growth or decline. of area populations (see Table 2-!18).. 
The areas have been grouped so as to gain maximum comparability 
with an earlier study of redistribution of Soviet population by

Part Two II. Population and Manpower  
Frank Lorimer, covering the periods 1897-1926 and 1926-39. For ter-
ritories annexed by the Soviet Union after 1540, no comparability 
can be achieved, but for the remainder of the Soviet Union the areas 
are approximately comparable. 
Predistribution increment or decrement, as shown in Table 
2-18, is the product of several factors, apart from any question 
of the accuracy of the data. Of great importance is the factor 
of differential exposure of various areas' to calamities, such as 
World War I, the Civil War, the famine and the epidemic years of 
1921-22, collectivization of the Ivarly 1930s, and World War II. 
Also of basic significance is the factor of internal migration 
(international migration, although significant in the western pro-
vinces following several of Russia*s calamities, has never been as 
important as in the more developed European nations a America). 
Internal migration often acts to fill in the irregularities of pop-
ulation distribution created by calamities. Immediately after 
World War for example differential population losses were much 
more evident than a few years later when there was a return move-
ment of displaced peoples to'the occupied areas and even a migra-
tory gain of population in certain newly acquired areas such as 
Kaliningrad and the former Baltic States. Internal migration in 
the Soviet Union as in other modern nations, however, is basically 
influenced by industrialization and urbanization. Of less impor-
tance as a factor in population redistribution except in certain 
subareas of the Soviet Union (such as the Transcaucasus) is the 
factor of markedly different birth and death rates. 
For the period 1939-55, the data in Table 2-18 indicate a 
gross transfer of population among Lorimer4s study areas of 
11,059,000 persons, or 5.5 per cent of the average population in 
the period 1939-55, as compared with a gross transfer of population 
within the pre-1540 Soviet boundaries of 10,577,000 persons in the 
1926-39 period (6.6 per cent of the average population size 1926.39). 
Virtually all of the population redisttibution has occurred as a 
result of an increase in Asiatic USSR and the Urals and a Oecrease 
in the remainder of Luropean USSR. It is interesting that these 
same trends, in general, characterize the redistribution of Russia's 
population in the preceding four decades. Two exceptions can be 
noted in the 1926-39 period when rapid industrialization produced-
substantial in-migration into the Old Industrial Center (including

Moskva, Ivanovo, Gorkiy, Yaroslavl) and the Leningrad and Karelia-
Murmansk regions. The same areas also show redistribution incre-
ments in the 1939-55 period, although the repopulation of former 
Finnish provinces of Karelia with Soviet settlers overcompensates 
for a decline of population in and around Leningrad. 
Although the use of the redistribution increment or decre-
ment method provides insight into the differential growth or decline 
of population, it should be remembered that the results are an ex-
pression only of the net effects of various changes. Thus, to take 
an extreme example, the former Baltic republics show a redistribu-
tion increment of only1400,000, whereas in reality some 1.2 million 
Soviet migrants entered these areas after 1940; but 800,000 of this 
gain was cancelled by wartime and postwar population losses in ex-
cess of losses suffered by the Soviet population on the average. 
Migratory Trends within the Unocupied Area, 1939-55. What 
part of the all-union population redistribution increment 
or decrement for a given area 1939-55 is due to losses associated 
with the Second World War and what part is due to migration? if 
either component could be estimated, the other could be obtained as 
a residual. Unfortunately, neither factor can be estimated directly 
with any degree of reliability for the whole USSR. However, it is 
possible to establish the direction of migratory trends within the 
area of the Soviet Union which was not directly touched by the Ger-
man occupation of World War II. The unoccupied area of the Soviet 
Union includes both areas of in-migration -(the'Urale and.Asiatic-
Ruseia)-end'aeas of out-iligration (such as-theTeastei.n periphery 
of the Central Industrial Region and the Volga)* Between 1926 and 
1939 the area equivalent to the unoccupied area had a modest migra-
tory gain of some 500,000 persons, or less than one per cent of the 
areals population. By roughly estimating military casualties and 
birth deficit of the area, it appears that the unoccupied area had 
little or no net migration gain or loss 1940-55 at the expense of 
the remainder of the Soviet Union. Using only the hypothesis that 
war losses in the unoccupied area would tend to be spread evenly 
over the oblasts comprising this area, an assumption which is not 
inconsistent with an ()blast distribution of birth deficit computed 
from school enrollment daia, it is possible to compute population 
redistribution increments and decrements within the unoccupied

in the unoccupied area was the Central Region, constituting 72 per 
cent of the total population decrement of the unoccupied area, or 
3.9 million. Out-migration was also substantial from the Volga 
Region and ?o 'a' lesser extent in the Southeast and the North and 
Northwest Regions. Almost all of the migratory gain within the 
unoccupied area was registered by the Urals Region, Kazakhstan, 
and the Far East. Unlike other parts of the unoccupied area, the 
Armyanskaya ,SSR attracted in-migrants from outside the Soviet Union 
in the return-home drive sponsored by the Soviet Government in 
1946-48. Within the Soviet Union, however, little internal migra-
tion from and to the Transcaucasus Region took place in the period 
1939-55, a tendency characteristic of much of the modern history 
of this region. 
All Union M.  rator Trends 1 8 Migration to the new 
lands areas is expected to continue in 1955-58, although 
the rate of migration will he greatly reduced. Two migratory trends 
of far greater significance are associated with 1) the Sixth Five-
Year Plan of industrialization in the east; and 2) migration to and 
from acquired areas. 
Industrialization in the East. Soviet reports of April 1956 
indicate that 3 million migrants will be required to supply 
the manpower requirements of a vast program of industrialization 
in the east (apparently in the Urals, Siberia, Kazakhstan, and the 
Soviet Far East) during the period of the Sixth Five-Year Plan. 
Over a five-year period, this would mean an average of 600,000 per 
year. An authoritative Soviet source, however, has given a some-
what smaller figure: Khrushchev in May 1956 called for 500,000 
migrants per year. Internal migration within the RSFSR yields an 
estimated "normal" migration to the entire area of the Urals, Siberia, 
Kazakhstan, the Soviet Far East, and Central Asia of 440,000 migrants 
per year, of which 350,000 per year would migrate into the areas 
directly affected by the new industrialization program. Thus, it 
seems likely that the total volume of migration to Asia will be 
intensified only modestly, whereas the new industrialization pro-
gm will to some extent effectuate a redistribution of migrants 
in terms of where they settle. 
It is too early to foresee the degree to which the proposed 
industrial program will have advanced by 1958. However, high rates

was only in the ?blasts which did not have high rates of "normal"

need of adjustment to allow for the new program. An arbitrary 
100,000 migrants were added to the latter areas and distributed 
among different oblasts in proportion to the "normal" migration

be Novosibirskaya, Omskaya, Akmolinskaya, Karagandinskaya, Kokche-

tion of the former Japanese territories included now 
in the Sakhalinskaya Oblast in the Soviet Far East appears to have 
been basically completed. The Japanese nationals have been repa-
triated and their places taken by Soviet in-migrants. This in 
-
migration is still proceeding, although at a reduced rate, and 
therefore the estimated in-migration in 1955-58 on the basis of 
1940-55 data was adjusted downward. The repopulation of the former 
German territory included now in Kaliningradskaya Oblast on the 
western periphery of the RSFSR is still continuing at a rapid pace. 
The former German population has been completely resettled, with ? 
virtually all having been returned to Germany. A German source in 
April 1956 reported that the Soviet government had decided to send 
another 600,000 Soviet settlers to Kaliningrad, at the rate of 120,000

Part TWO II. Population and Manpower. 
9 million persons from rural to urban areas., The figures also 
indicate a significant decrease in the rate of urban growth start-
ing with 1955: the average annual rate of urban growth was 4.6 
per cent between 1951 and 1955 but dropped to 2.3 per cent after 
1955. 
There are several plausible explanations for this reduced 
rate. In the past, Sovieturban growth has drawn heavily. on.the 
rural population, and the present supply of rural manpower is no 
longer as abundant. -As.a result of war losses ?the rural segment 
of the population cannot spare the manpower-to relieve the short-
age caused .by the continuing growth of urban complexes. The new 
emphasis on agricultural production, as evidenced in the develop-
ment of the virgin lands, contributes to the tight labor force 
situation in the rural .regions-of -the Soviet Union 
Assuming an annual natural growth of urban population of 
1 7 per cent-, a yearly increase of only 2 million-Persons allows 
for a'minimal flow of migrants from rural to urban areas. Since 
a certain urban' increment is added as a result of reclassification 
of populated points as urban, the .annual rural-to-urban migration 
is estimated' atslightly less than 500,000 persons. 
2. Urban Population Ranges  
In the 1926-55 period the urban population of the Soviet 
Union increased by more than 200 per cent, from 26.3 million to 
86.6 million, while the number of urban settlements more than 
doubled (see Table 2-21). Although most of this growth occurred 
betWeen 1926. and 1939; during the period of rapid industrial growth, 
a high rate of urban growth continued in the postwar period. In 
the-1939-56 period, the gyeatest percentual increase in.the number 
of cities occurred in-the over-5?0,000 class. The greatest per-
centual growth of 'population occurred.in the Under-10,000class, 
chiefly-as the result of reclassification of rural settlements. 
The future.will'probably see a decrease in'the rate of.growth of the 
largest cities and an attempt to decentralize. some.of the industrial 
complexes. Even prior to World War certain restrictions were 
issued on continued growth of the.large Soviet. cities. Comparing 
the prewar and the present populations of these cities, it becomes
obvious that the restrictions have not been effective 'Nevertheless, 
more recent comments in the Soviet press indicate that perhaps some

further measures will be taken in this direction. 
3. BgIblic Distribution and Rate of Growth  
The proportion and the rate of growth of the urban popula-
tion eachvariisgreatly among the republics and ?blasts of the Soviet 
Union (see Tables 2-22 and A-6, Appendix). As is true of the total 
population a general eastward shift of the urban population has 
been in process for several decades. The growth of cities in Siberia, 
the Urals, and Central Asia received an impetus during the war years, 
when millions of persons were evacuated with industriaJ installwo 
tions to the east. Although many of the evacuees returned to the 
west after the war, -a' large number settled in the new areas. More 
important, as a result of the war the Soviet Union realized the 
necessity of developing the less accessible hinterlands, of the 
country. Continued urban growth in these regions is insured by the 
current plans to accelerate industrialization in Siberia, a process 
which will involve a redistribution of millions of persons. 
n Only about 20 per cent of the urban population were located 
in Asiatic Russia (including the Urals) in 1926. This proportion 
had increased to about 25 per cent in 1939 and to slightly more 
than 30 per cent in 1958, despite the annexation of urban popula-
tion in the Baltics, the Ukraine, Belorussia, and Moldavia. Al-
though the bulk of the urban population is located in the Central 
A Industrial Region of the RSFSR, the areas with the highest pro-
portions of urban population are usually in regions where conditions 
preclude the possibility of important agricultural development, as 
in the case of the Northwestern and Far Eastenn Regions of the RSFSR. 
Ukrainskaya,SSR, on the other hand, with important industrial centers 
and a large urban population,is 63 per cent rural, because of the 
high density of the agricultural population. 
, Urban population in Asiatic Russia doubled in the 1939-58 
period, while European Russia showed a rate-of growth about one-
third as high. Since the RSFSR spreads across both continents, 
the estimated growth of 56.2 per cent (see Table 2-23) is deceiving, 
since it includes both the regions of rapid urban growth and the 
war-devastated areas in the west. For example, the urban popula-
ion of the Far East increased-more -than 170 per cent between 1939 
and 1958, while in the Volga Region during the same period, it 
grew by less than 20 per cent. In the Kazakhskaya SSR and the

With few exceptions, the distribution of urban growth fol-
lowed the regional pattern established between 1926-39, during the 
period of greatest urbanization, and there is no reason to believe 
that any major changes in this growth will occur in the near future. 
Siberia and Central Asia will continue to receive a disproportional 
number of urban in-migrants, concurrent with the planned develop-
ment in that area, while the urban growth in the western regions 
will be substantially more moderate. 
4. Population of Cities  
Table A-7, Appendix, presents the 1958 estimated populations 
for urban areas of oblast subordination or above and the 1939/40 
populations of those-cities which currently have populations of more 
than 50,000. Cities with populations of 100,000 and above wee 
included in the list published in Narodnoye khozyaystwo ,SSSR. The

habitants and/or those which are administrative centers were listed

estimates for the remainder of the cities are based on numerous 
reports and indexes, scattered population data from both Russian 
and German sources, data on election districts, and the 1926 and 
1939 census. 
It should be recognized that the validity of each estimate 
is directly proportional to the size of the city. Thus, estimates 
for cities of 100,000 and above (including about half the Urban 
population) are the most accurate. Estimates for cities which were 
Over 50,000 in 1939 and were reported in the census of that year 
are also considered relatively reliable. For urban areas under 
50,0001 the estimates are more tentative. They are usually more 
accurate for cities outsidA thP RSFSR and the Ukraine, where an 
accurate indication of the size of a town may be'obtained from 
small election districts (based on populations of 5,000-20,000), 
and less accurate for cities within these two republics, where 
election districts are based on populations of 150,000 and 1001000, 
respectively, and where other indexes and rates of projection had 
to be used. 
5. Rural Population  
The rural population of the Soviet Union is estimated at 
116 million as of 1 January 1958. This total is derived on the 
basis of projections of the total and urban populations as reported 
for 1956 in AtudnomishozygystvojpR. Since the system of registra-
tions in the urban areas is more complete and the urban statistics 
are more reliable, the problem of inaccurate data is essentially 
concentrated in the rural regions of the Soviet Union (see Section 
IL A. 2 for a discussion of underenumeration). For example, prior 
to the 1939 census, Soviet sources freely admitted that for all 
practical purposes the rural population of the country was an un-
known quantity. Although definite improvements have been made in 
the system of registration in rural areas, particularly in 1948-49, 
there is still no evidence of complete enumeration, and undoubtedly 
current data reflect a serious underenumeration. 
The rural population has decreased as a result of the high

greatest urban grOwth more than wiped oUt the natural increase of 
the rural population, In terms of outright War tosses, the rural 
segment of the population sustained a much higher proportion of the 
casualties than did. the urban population. Not only did the military 
services recruit more heavily from the rural population, but a higher 
proportion of the. urban population was evacuated to the east and 
the return movement to the cities was higher. Postwar rural-to-

a birth deficit. These factors, however, were somewhat compensated 
for by an eastward movement of the rural population. Although. rela 
tively small in -volume, this movement was accentuated by the devel-
opment of virgin and fallow lands in Kazakhstan and western Siberia. 
During the height of the program (1954-56), a large number of rural 
migrants from European RSFSR, the Ukraine, and Belorussia, as well 
as from the-other republics of the, USSR, came to settle on-the 
previously uncultivated lands. On a much smaller scale, rural 
settlement has also been taking place in the Far East and eastern 
Siberia.

The Soviet Union has perhaps reached the point where it 
can-no longer afford. to continue a policy which builds up-the urban 
population at the expense of the rural population. Although a re-
duced rate of rural-to-urban.migration will continue, it is ex-
pected that the rural population will grow for the next few years 
at an annual- rate of about one percent Only a significant in-' 
crease in agricultural productivity, necessary to feed a constantly 
growing urban population, would release.additional rural manpower 
for the growing industrial capacity of the Soviet Union. 
6. Population Density

pattern of the Soviet population is extremely irregular. Table 
2-25.presents.the population density -outside the-major urban areas 
for the 15 union republics and for the major economic regions-of 
the. RSFSR. The estimated populations in this table -exclude all 
urban areas of oblast -subordination and.abovel so-that the den-

proportion of the population in these areas is urban, the exclusion 
of major urban settlements reduces sharply the population density. 
As a result of the general redistribution of the popul&-
'lion of the USSR and the tendency to migrate to the east, the popu-
lation density east of the Urals will increase. However, the con-
sequences will be significant only for local areas and will have 
little effect on the over-all figures of the large economic regions. 
C. Age-Sex Structure  
1. 1958 Age-Sex Structure 
The estimated 1958 age composition of the USSR population 
is a projection of the mid-values of the 1956 age structure esti-
mate, based on scattered Soviet data (discussed in Section 3, fol-
lowing). The sex structure is an adaptation of the ratios pre-
sented in &Estimate of the Develo ments in USSR Po ulation Struc-
ture from January 17, 1939, to January 1, 1952 (ARD Technical 
Paper, 1-3). 
The excess of females in the Soviet population (see Table 
2-26) reflects the heavy male losses during World War. 11 and many 
of the other disasters of the past half century which periodically 
have produced excess mortality among the males* The estimated sex 
ratio in 1958 is 113 females per 100 males; in 1950 it was 118 per 
100. Although an excess of females in the Soviet Union will persist 
for several decades, the tendency to approach an equality between 
the sexes will continue.

of mortality in the Soviet Union and the effects of past calamities 
are reflected in the low proportion of the population over 60 years 
of age. This is particularly striking when faced with the exceed-
ingly low crude death rate of the Soviet Union and is more repre-
sentative of a country with high death rates. Nevertheless, the 
60-plus cohort for the first time reflects a relative growth and 
is well above the 13 million reported in 1954. 
2. Problem of Enumeration  
An estimate of the age compopition of Soviet population was 
constructed by synthesizing scattered Soviet data pertaining to 
various components of the total population in 1956. 'As 'a first 
step, statistics on births, school enrollment, and eligible voters 
were utilized to form a set of preliminary estimates of population 
ages 0-6, 7-17, and 18 and over, respectively. It was necessary, 
of course, to modify the basic data in part. Mortality occurring 
between birth and age 6 was subtracted from the computed number of 
births; similarly, as the relationship between school enrollment 
and population of school age is not perfect, allowance was made 
for nonattendance at school and for the continuation in primary 
school of children above the "normal" four ages (7-110) of primary 
school. 
The technical aspects of these modifications may be summa-
rized as follows: 
1 Infant mortality was computed on the basis of state-
ments in the Soviet press concerning the decline of infant 
mortality in various postwar years as compared with the pre-
war period. The resulting level of infant mortality was 
found to be consistent with infant mortality in the model 
United Nations life table for a population with an average 
life expectancy at birth of 64 years, the level of life ex-
pectancy recently reported as obtaining for the Soviet Union. 
Of far less significance statistically, child mortality rates 
were derived by averaging the child mortality rates of seven 
countries having similar levels of infant mortality as that 
estimated for the Soviet Union. 
2. The population ages 7-17 was estimated by utiliz-
ing reported information on enrollment in grades 1-4, per-
centages of age classes attending school, and drop-out and 
failure rates. Thus, enrollment in grades 1-4 in 1948-49, 
1951-52, and 1955-56 was utilized to establish the number 
7,. 8, 9, and 10 years olefin these three school years. By

3. The percentage which eligible voters constituted of 
the reported total Soviet population in 199+ and 1955 was 
relatively constant (62.7 and 6209, respectively), and 
therefore the 1955 percentage was applied to the 1956 re-
ported population to derive an estimate of eligible voters 
In that year. 
The groups 0-61 7-17, and 18 and over total 196,389,0001 
or 2,978,000 less than the 1956 reported total population of 
199,347,000. Under the tentative assumption that this residual 
can be interpreted as an allowance by Soviet authorities for the 
nonvoting adult population, the conclusion is implied that the 
scattered materials pertaining to the age composition of Soviet 
population basically confirm the official population reported by 
Soviet authorities. It should be kept in mind, however, that the 
preceding computations make no allowance for adjustments to the 
0-6 and 7-17 estimates and that the allowance of about 3 million 
nonvoting adults would seem to understate significantly the true 
size of this group. The possible scope of such adjustments is 
discussed below. 
Underregistration of births. Russia's experience in birth 
registration is extensive, as church registers date back 
to the early eighteenth century. Following the Bolshevik Revolution 
in 1917, responsibility for maintenance of vital statistics was 
transferred from eccles4astical to civil authorities. By 1939 reg-
istration was considered by Soviet authorities to be satisfactory 
except in the more backward areas. In Soviet sources, the effec-
tiveness of birth registration is usually measured against the 
results of a census, disregarding the well-known fact that censuses 
themselves nearly always involve underenumeration of infants and 
children. The scope of the problem is suggested by the estimate 
made by rrank-Lorimer, the demographer, that the 1939 census under-
enumerated the children under two years of age by 6.3 percent. 
Effectiveness of registration has undoubtedly improved since 1939,

but it appears that births still may be under registered by 5 to 10 
per cent. In comparison, underregistrat ion of births in the U.S., 
according to official data of the U.S.. Bureau of the Census, amounted 
to 8 per cent in 1940 and to 1.5 per cent in 1954, (Ansley Coale 
has"estimated that the 1950 U.S. census underenumerated the popula-
tion under age five by 3 per cent-4 per cent of all white children 
and 10 per cent of nonwhite children ) 
, School enrollment in relation to ?o ulation o school ..e 
School participation, drop-out, and failure rates for the 
prewar period were utilize0. to test'the.method of deriving postwar 
data on population of-school age from statistics on school enroll-
ment in primary grades. The population as-predicted from school 
enrollment data was 4.5 per cent lower than the population reported 
in the official 1939 census. School participation rates tend to 
expand gradually to optimal levels, whereas failure and drop-out 
rate tend to decrease gradually to minimal levels, in such a way 
that there is a general tendency for primary school enrollment to 
approach a state of perfect correlation with the actual population 
of school age. Thus, it is doubtful if school enrollment data in 
the postwar period underrepresents the actual population of school 
age by as much as was found in the prewar comparison. Alternatiie

included as It has been offi-
cially reported that in 1931+ disfranchised adults consti-
tuted 2.5 per cent of the population of voting age (age 18 and 
over). In the absence of reliable population data for 1934 (the 
previous all-union census was in 1926), it appears likely that the 
reported percentage refers to those explicitly deprived of .voting 
eligibility rather than constituting the difference between the 
lists ofeligible voters and .the population age 18 and over. Thus, 
the total number of adults in 193+ probably exceeded somewhat the 
reported percentage who were explicitly deprived of voting eligi-
bility. Comparison of.reported voters for 1938-39 with the adult 
population counted in the 1939 census indicates. that eligible voter 
statistics underrepresented the recensed population age 18 and over 
in 1938-39 by 6.2-6.3 per cent. It is known that the number of perr. 
sons disfranchised for political reasons increased significantly 
after 1934 as "a result of the purges of the late 1930s. If the 
estimate of forced laborers from the 1541 plan, made by the Soviet 
specialist Jasny, is accepted as an estimate for this group as of 
1939, it would appear that forced laborers would account for some-
what more than half, or 3.5 million, of the computed 6.2-6.3 per 
cent discrepancy and that the remaining 2.7 million would consist 
of insane and senile persons, common criminals, and unregistered 
eligible voters. 
During the war and immediate postwar years, the number of 
forced laborers increased radically as a result of various Soviet 
deportations. In the post-Stalin period many forced laborers have 
been released, and it must not be forgotten that the high forced 
labor camp population has been continuously decimated by excess 
mortality caused by severe living conditions, inadequate food and 
clothing, and overwork. However, despite Soviet propaganda to the 
contrary, forced labor camps still exist, and the proportion of 
nonvoting adults as a whole undoubtedly falls within the range of 
3-6 per cent implied for 1934-39. 
Table 2-27 suggests that the 1956 reported total population 
may understate the size of the USSR's population by 3-10 million. 
However, the relationships among the three broad age groups would 
not be significantly altered by the indicated ranges of underenumer-
ation, as shown in Table 2-28, where the age structure of Soviet

birth deficit and excess mortality of the 7-17 age group during 
World War The 0-6 age group in 1956 still constituted a rela-
tively high proportion of the total population, despite a drop by 
one-third in the birth rate, as a consequence of the reduction by 
over two-thirds of infant mortality between 194.4-1956.

selective effects of the war, which killed off the sick and aged 
who otherwise would have died later; and 3) the changed age-sex 
structure of the population which places a larger proportion of 
the total population in the ages of lowest mortality rates. 
TL- last e 
importance of thes point, in particular,is emphasiz-
ed by new Soviet data indicating that average life expectancy reached 
61+ years in 1955, a rate corresponding to a life table death rate 
(i.e., actual Soviet mortality rates for each age-sex group in the 
population computed in relation to a hypothetically stationary popu-
lation) of 15.6 per 1,000. Since the life table death rate is not 
computed in relation to the? actual age-sex composition of the 
pOpulatiOht it adequateljr expresses the actual level of mortality 
rates and makes possible the following comparison. Although the 
crude death rate in the Soviet Union was lower than the crude death 
rate in the U.S. in 1955, the actual level of mortality rates was 
10 per cent higher.in the Soviet Unibn in the same year. Never-
theless, the reduction of 'mortality rates in the Soviet Union has 
been-enormous, the current life table death rate being 28 per cent 
lower in 1955 than the life table death rate of 1939. 
Although the change in the crude birth rate has been less 
spectacular than that of the death rate, the degree of.change is 
actually quite large--a reduction in the number of births on

average, of about 2 million per year. This phenomenon may be viewed 
as the anticipated consequence of increased industrialization and 
urbanization in the USSR, and since it is contrary to the Soviet 
government's pronatalist policies, an attempt was made to hide 
the greatly lowered birth rate as recently as the last World Popu-
lation Conference held in 1951+. Since that time, however, Khrushchev 
has castigated bachelors and argued for the achievement of a three-
child family. The birth rate in the next five years will probably 
not decline significantly, as persons in the reproductive ages of 
20-34 will be drawn essentially from age classes born in high birth-
rate years. After 1962, however, a precipitous decline in the birth 
rate can be expected, for the number of potential parents will have 
been reduced by nearly 10 million as a consequence of the war and 
immediate postwar birth deficit. Under the assumption of a slowly 
rising crude death rate and aprecipitous decline in the birth rate, 
the natural increase rate is expected to drop sharply in the future. 
E. Ethnic Composition  
1. Ethnic Groups  
An outstanding characteristic of the ethnic composition of 
the Soviet Union is its great complexity. Aside from the Great 
Russians, who constitute only a bare majority of the population 
(54.58 percent), probably 168 other ethnic groups of the most 
diverse linguistic and cultural background are represented. Only 
twelve of the groups are large enough to constitute more than one 
per cent of the population (see Table 2-30). Of the remainder 
moriu'amount' to 
only 'a 'few thousand, some having been classified 
separately purely on the basis of dialect or tribal distinctiveness. 
The diversity of the Soviet Union's ethnic composition be-
comes less formidable when it is realized that an estimated 76 per 
cent of the population belong to the single linguistic-cultural 
grouping of the Eastern Slays. In addition to the Great Russians, 
this cactegory includes the Ukrainians and the Belorussians, the 
second and third largest nationalities of the Soviet Union. Al-
though all three groups speak Eastern Slavic languages and share 
a common Eastern Orthodox cultural heritage, important differences 
exist among them. Great Russian culture tends to dominate the other 
two groups, particularly the Belorussian, and there has been con-
siderable assimilation of the two smaller groups by the Russians.

The Turkic-language groups constitute an important bloc in 
the Soviet Union's population. The more important nationalities 
are the Uzbeks, the Kazakhs, the Turkmen, and the Kirghiz of Turkestan; 
the Azerbaydzhani of the Transcaucasus area; and the Tatars and 
Bashkirs who reside in the region between the Volga River and the 
Ural Mountains. These groups share a common Islamic cultural her-
itage. 
The Tadzhiks of southern Turkestan are closely related to 
the-Turkic nationalities of-Turkestan but differ from them in their 
Iranian -speech. The "influence' of Turkic languages has been impor-
tant within this group and a large number now speak Uzbek.

Part Two I I. Population and Manpor 
The more important Finnic groups of the USSR are the Mord-
vinians in the Volga region and the Estonians in the Baltic litto-
ral. Other smaller groups speaking Finnic languages inhabit the 
northern portion of European Russia and'western Siberia and the 
Volga valley. Despite similarities among their languages, wide 
cultural differences exist. 
The nationalities constituting the Baltic linguistic group 
are the Lithuanians and the Latvians, who with the Finnic Estonians 
make up the population of the Baltic littoral. Primarily Protestant 
or Catholic in religion and culturally oriented toward the west, 
these groups have little in common with their Russian neighbors. 
Prior to the Soviet occupation in 1940 they enjoyed national inde-
pendence. 
The most numerous of the ethnic groups of the Transcaucasus 
area, aside from the Azerbaydzhani, are the Georgians and Armenians. 
These two peoples have independent civilizations which date back to 
ancient times but are related in that their cultures are basically 
Christian. 
The MnIdAviAns, the basic' population'of the Moldmvsknyn ,SSR, 
are closely connected lingustically, culturally, and religiously 
with the Rumanians. Until 1940 they formed a part of the Rumanian 
Kingdom.

Although there has been a tendency toward nationality dis-
persion and intermixture in the USSR, most of the ethnic groups are 
still largely concentrated in compact areas of settlement. There 
are, however, exceptions to this rule, the most notable of which 
are the Jews, the Poles and the Germans. The Jews and Poles are 
located primarily in the Ukrainskaya, Belorusskaya, and Litovskaya 
SSRs and the RSFSR. The Germans, previously centered in-the Lower 
Volga Region of the RSFSR and the Ukrainskaya,SSR, are now dis-
persed through the eastern regions of the RSFSR and Central Asia.

dispersion and intermingling of nationalities, characteristic of 
the Soviet period as a whole; and 2) a regathering of previously 
scattered groups into their original areas of settlement. 
The intermingling of Russia's ethnic groups has resulted 
primarily from the continuing migration sof .Russians, Ukrainians, 
and Belorussians into the underdeveloped areas of the Union, the 
most publicized aspect of which has been the "new lands" movement. 
The effect of this migration as far as the non-Russian areas of 
the USSR are concerned has been one of gradual Slavification, 
and the trend has been more apparent in Kazakhstan than in any 
other area. Reduced to a minority prior to World War the 
Kazakhs now constitute only about one-third of the population of 
their? native republic. The new-lands program, bringing an influx 
of settlers into the republic, is to be continued until the end 
of the current five-year plan, and it is also planned to direct 
a great flow of in-migrants into the republic during the extensive 
industrialization program envisaged for the next few years. The 
realization of these plans will make the Kazakhs a small minority 
in their own land and may in time lead to the absorption of Kazakh-
stan by the RSFSR. 
The probable fate of Kazakhstan has been foreshadowed 
during the past year by the incorporafin of the Karelo-Finskaya 
SSR into the RSFSR. One of the determinants in this change in 
administrative status was the heavy Russian movement into the 
republic which reduced the Karelian and Finnish population, 
depleted by prewar and World War II migrations into Finland, to 
small minorities. 
The effects of Russian migration on the indigenous na-
tionalities of Kazakhstan and Karelo-Finland cannot be considered 
typical of non-Russian areas of the USSR. Actually,-the intensive 
campaigns to develop the new-lands areas and to industrialize 
Kazakhstan and Siberia have probably absorbed and will continue 
to absorb a large part of any excess agrarian population from 
the traditional areas of out-migration--the northwest and north-
central Ukraine, Belorussia, and central RSFSR--which normally 
would be directed to other areas in which the Russians are in 
the minority. The only other republic imminently threatened with 
Slavification is the Kirgizskaya,SSR, where in a few years the

majority of the population will probably be Russian and Ukrainian. 
Of the other central As republics, none has *a Slavic minority 
numbering more than a quarter of the population. The same is true 
of the Transcaucasian republics, while in the Baltic area only 
Latvia is more than one-quarter Slavic. In the Ukraine and Belo-
russia, probably 15 per cent and 10 per cent of the population, 
respectively, are Russian, although a considerable additional 
segment has undergone partial Russification. 
The second significant trend in the dynamics of Soviet 
nationality distribution during the past year has been the re-
gathering of ethnic groups dispersed wholly or in part during the 
Stalinist period. This trend is intimately connected with the 
de-Stalinization program of the present regime and was clearly 
presaged in the section of Khrushchev's speech to the Twentieth 
Party Conference which attacked the Stalinist policy of deporting 
entire nationalities from their homelands, as weJl as by a 1955 
decree restoring civil rights to the Caucasian expellees. Probably 
the most significant aspect of this repatriation--that involving 
the return of the North Caucasian groups and the Kalmyks exiled in 
1943-4- for alleged collaboration with the Germans?was provided 
for in a 1956 decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. This 
enactment provided for the restoration of the Balkars, Chechens, 
Ingush, Kalmyks, and Karachai to their homelands and the recreation 
of their prewar administrative-territorial unitse The transfer of 
the Kalmyks, Karachai, and Balkar is to be nnmpleted by 1958, 
while the terminal date for the return of the Chechens and lngush 
has been set for 1960. 
It should be emphasized that this measure does not com-
pletely reverse the mass deportation policy of the World Wan II 
period. No provision has been made, for example, for the return 
of the Volga Germans and the Crimean Tatars to their homelands, 
and it is presumed that these groups will be forced to remain in 
the areas to which they were deported. 
The trend toward a regrouping of the ethnic groups wholly 
or partially dispersed during the Stalinist period has not been 
limited to the nationalities deported during World War il. It has 
also involved a repatriation of some Estonians, Latvians, an0 Lithu-
anians from exile or forced labor. Large numbers of these groups

were exiled after the Soviet seizure of the Baltic republics in 
1540-41, in the immediate postwar period, and during collectiviza-
tion. It is possible, moreover, that the amnesty decrees of 1953 
and 1955 have led to the return of other groups from forced labor 
camps and areas of deportation, but data are insufficient to 
reach any definite conclusions. 
A final current in the repatriation trend involves the 
return to their homeland of persons who had Polish citizenship 
on 17 September 1939, This is a return to the policy of 1946-47 
when approximately 1.5 million Poles were sent to Poland in ex-
change for a lesser number of Ukrainians, Belorussians, and 
Lithuanians resident in Poland. The current emigration received 
its first impetus under the repatriation agreement of November 
1956 and is expected to be intensified under a new accord of March 
1957. Forty thousand were repatriated in 1956 and about 120,000 
are expected to emigrate in 19570 The total number of potential 
repatriates has been estimated at 500,000.

Part Two II. Population.
F. Labor Force  
1. The "Gainfully Occupied" Population  
The 1958 "gainfully occupied" population of the USSR totals 
an estimated 113.8 million persons (see Table 2-32), or 55 per cent 
of the total population as derived from Soviet sources. The large 
proportion which are estimated to be gainfully occupied may in 
large part be associated with the problem of underenumeration (see 
Section II. C.) of the total population. However, it is also the 
result of using in the present study the "gainfully occupied" con-
cept which has been traditionally utilized in Soviet censuses. A 
more restrictive Soviet concept of employment will be discussed 
later in this section, where certain new Soviet data will be pre-
sented.

Urban 27.1 17.0 114. I 
Rural 34.5 35.2 69.7 
The estimated gainfully occupied population in Soviet urban 
areas closely approximates the western concept of labor force, in 
that men and women engaged for the most part in full-time economic 
activities are included, while youths under age 16 are included 
only if they engage in full-time employment. The number of females 
gainfully occupied in Soviet urban areas appears low in comparison'l 
with the number of males, but aaually the proportion of urbanife-
males who are working is quite high. In 1958, 35 percent'of all 
urban females (and 50 per cent of women ages 16-49) were gainfully 
occupied as compared with only 31 per cent in 1939. 
In rural areas, approximately the same number of males and 
females are gainfully occupied, although the number of women 
greatly exceeds the number of men in the total rural population. 
The estimate of persons gainfully occupied in rural areas is arti-
ficially high, as is true for any predominantly agricultural

population where the gainfully occupied concept is utilized. Youths 
who work part-time after school hours, on weekends, and during the 
summer school vacation are considered gainfully occupied. Similarly, 
womem who work only during the harvesting season are also included. 
Even the level of employment of men is exaggerated, since off-
season and other unemployment is not taken into account. 
In general, it is considered that the above estimates for 
the? urban population are a fairly accurate representation of the 
actual urban labor force, whereas the estimates for the rural pop-
ulation more closely approach an estimate of the potential rural 
labor force. 
2. Categories of Gainful Employment  
The largest single category of the gainfully occupied in

per cent of the gainfully occupied population. In the 1939-55 
period, however, workers and employees increased from about one-
third of the total gainfully occupied to 45 per cent, while col-
lective and individual farmers, despite annexations of predomi-
nantly agricultural populations after 1939, decreased from more 
than 50 per cent of the 1939 gainfully occupied population to 
about 40 per cent of the 1958 gainfully employed. These trends 
are expected to continue. 
Reported Soviet data in 1955 confirm ARD's estimate that 
females constituted 4-5 per cent of the total number of workers 
and employees in that year. In the immediate future, the pro-
portion of such persons who are women is expected to remain 
relatively constant and may even decline slightly. The dis-
torted sex ratio among collective and individual farmers as a 
consequence of heavy male military casualties in World War II 
is becoming more normal each year, as the number of persons enter-
ing the working ages are about equally split between males and 
fAmAlAc, The cistimated sex ratio in 1958 is 110 females for each 
100 males gainfully occupied. 
30 Etported Data on ____.........nledPersone 
Unlike much of the new data concerning Soviet population 
and workers and employees, material concerning "employett persons" 
is of questionable usefulneqs and, in fact, taken as a whole, is 
perhaps one of the grossest statistical monstrosities to appear in 
Soviet literature. This may be illustrated as follows: Three 
thisles in Narodnoye khozyaystvo (1956) have a direct bearing? on 
the total USSR labor force. The first (on page 19) deals with 
social classes of the working population and their dependents, but 
the definition of such groups as lworkers an' employees" and-"col-
lective farmers" apparently differs significantly from data shown 
in two general labor force tables. The first of the general labor 
force tables (on page 187) deals with the "distribution of the 
population employed in the USSR national economy by branches." 
Only percentages are shown, however, and these are rounded so 
severOy as to make them almost worthless. In the second (on page 
188) the "distribution of the population employed in the USSR nat-
ional economy in productive and nonproductive branches" is reported, 
but again only as percentages of an unknown total, although they 
are rounded by one less digit. Comparison of ffiese two tables is

further impaired by the use of different classifications of "branches 
of national economy" in each, and one is also confronted with the 
problem of components which are not compatible. It has been offical-
ly stated that student-members of families of collective farmers 
(probably those 16 years of age and above) who work part-time 
(e.g., during their vacation periods) on collectives are listed in 
the balance of labor resources as collective farmers, converted to 
year-round employment. Members of families of workers and employees 
Who are employed in auxiliary private economy, however, are cal-
culated by determining the quantity of labor (man-days) expended. 
Thus, the problem arises of interpreting A rARult whinh is 
com-
pounded of amounts of accredited time worked and the number of 
persons working. 
Study of available materials leaves the following impres-
sions: 1) Soviet authorities appear more interested in obscuring 
than in clarifying the size and distribution of the Soviet labor 
force; 2) the materials on which these tables are based are un-
certain, both in terms of quality and scope; and 3) the components 
are often not compatible and the labor force concept which emerges, 
in some respects, is similar in meaning to that which might obtain 
from counting watermelons and grapes. 
Two methods may be utilized in attempting to derive abso-
lute data on employment from the table appearing on pagec188 
1) Members of industrial artels, according to the table, constitute 
1.8 per cent of the "total employed (excluding military personnel)." 
If an absolute figure were available for members-of artels, the 
total labor force could be derived, and as a consequence of obiain-
ing this total, the numbers in all other branches of national 
economy. On the following page, members of artels in 1955 are re-
ported to have totalled "1.8 million persons." However, on page 
44 of the same source members of artels are reported in the same 
year to have totalled 1 6 million persons. To this should be added 
the note that various Soviet sources in the postwar years have 
consistently reported the- number of artel members as on the order 
of 1.8 million. For example, Pravda has reported that members of 
artels totaled 1,865,000 in 1953 and 1,961,000 in 1956. The effects 
of using either 1.6 million, 1.8 million, or 1,961,000 on the size

Thus, there is a difference of 20 million in total employed depend-
ing upon which figure is used for members of artels. Various hypo-
theses can be offered as a possible explanation of the divergences 
in the reported number of artel members. It is possible that i6 
million represents an annual average, while the other figures are 
end-of-year figures. A more plausible conjecture by specialists 
outside the USSR is that the smaller figure is a ?less inclusive 
one, excluding members of artels who are not engaged in "material 
branches of production." 
(2) Another method may be used to check the above results 
By combining subcategories of the table on page 188 (appearing as 
Subcategories a and 'b of Category land all of Category 2 in Table 
2-3+)'a percentage can be obtained of the tptal employed which is 
roughly equivalent to the data on workers and employees as reported 
in Nrodnoelmastvo on page 189. Dividing the latter by the 
former, a? 1955 total employment figure (excluding military) of 
85,43$1162 is obtained. This result is not basically incompatible 
with the result of 88,888,889 obtained by Method 1 above, since 
the subcategories as combined from the table on page 188 have been 
admitted by the Central Statistical Administration to be "slightly 
more complete (included are hired personnel of collectives, social 
organizations and other small groups)" than the data on workers and 
employees alone. 
To summarize available statistics on total Soviet employ-
ment are exceedingly crude and of unknown reliability. However, 
it appears that in preparing Narodnoye khozyaystvo Soviet statis-
ticians used a figure on total employment) excluding military and 
nonworking students, of about 89 million. This figure, as well as 
the implied distribution among branches of national economy, is 
shown in Table 2-11-. In Column 4-of the table, the results ob-
tained for 1955 by Method "l are shown (assumOtion: members of

were obtained by Method 2 (assumption: Subcategories a and b of Cat-
egory 1 and all of Category 2 are approximately equal to exactly re-
ported data on the number of workers and-employees). However, in 
the absence of a comparable figure on artel members for 1940 and 1955, 
the results of utilizing Method 2 are considered more valid in study-
ing the changes through time among the branches of national economy) 
since the method can be held constant. 
The most striking change? suggested in Table 2-34 is the de-
cline in the number of EA.rsons employed in the two subcategories 
"kolkhoz workers employed on collectivized farms of kolkhozes and 
an private subsidiary farms" and "individual peasants and unincor-
porated handicraftsmen." In 1940, 42 million persons, or 54.7 per 
cent of the total employed (excluding military), were doing such 
work, as compared with only 36 million in 1950 and about 33 mil-
lion in 1955. In 1955 the two categories amount to only 37.9 per 
cent of the total employed (excluding military). 
A second trend of interest in Table 2-31+ is the indication 
that wage earners (rabochiye or, roughly, blue collar workers) 
almost doubled between 1940, from about 15 million to about 28;

million. The subcategory "engineers, salary earners, subordinate 
maintenance personnel, and trade workers" also expanded significant-
ly, by about 2 million persons between 1940 and 1955. 
In Table 2-35 the distribution of employed persons among 
somewhat different branches of the national economy is quoted di-
rectly from Narodnoye khozyaystvo SSSR. Rough estimates for each 
of the categories specified can be obtained by multiplying the approx-
imate reported percentages for 1955 by the assumed total employed 
(excluding military) of 89 million. A similar absolute figure for 
total employed (excluding military) in 1913, 1928, and 1937 is not 
given in the Soviet source. However, the reported percentages 
illustrate very well the long-term effects of industrialization--
the enormous decline in agriculture and forestry going hand in hand 
with an expansion of employment in industry, education, and public 
health. 
It is possible to estimate roughly the proportion of collec-
tive farmers engaged primarily in nonagricultural activities. By 
comparing Tables 241- and 2-35 a residual of 4 per cent, or 3.6 
million persons, can be obtained for farmers engaged primarily in 
construction and subsidiary enterprises on collective farms. From 
a breakdown of labor days earned in terms of various types of activi 
ties, it is estimated that about 1.1 million collective farmers 
worked primarily in administrative-service activities on collective 
farms in 1955, and that the number of collective farmers employed 
primarily in nonagricultural activities totaled 4.7 million, or 11+ 
per cent of persons reportedly employed on collective farms. 
1+. The Concepts of Gainfully Occupied and Employed Persons  
Explicitly excluded from "employd persons" as reported in 
112rodnuLthayilyiLILNELE were military personnel, and inspection 
of Tables 2-34 and 2-35 does not reveal any subcategory where 
the work of concentration camp inmates and similar laboring groups 
might be conveniently hidden. Reductions of military personnel in 
the last few years have been reported, but the Order of Battle esti-
mate as of May 1957 indicates that the USSR still has under arms 
4.5 million men, including some 400,000 MVD and KGB personnel. 
Most of the nonvoting adults, including forced laborers, are of 
prime working age (see Section C.I. 1958 Age-Sex Structure) and 
may therefore be presumed actually employed.

Part Two II. Population and Manpower  
researchers have attempted to derive an estimate of the "gainfully 
occupied" population in 1939 by using as a starting point the age-
sex composition of the 1939 population, and by modifying where,posi-
ble 1926 labor force participation ratios for different age and sex 
groups to reflect as much as possible the actual conditions of 1939. 
These studies have consistently estimated that the 1939 "gainfully 
occupied" population (including military) amounted to approximately 
50 per cent of the total population, a finding which is compatible 
with the results of the 1926 Soviet census after subtracting the 
number of very young children counted in that census a; part of 
the "gainfully occupied" and is also compatible with studies of 
various other countries similar to the Soviet Union. However, the 
computations as indicated in Table 2-34 imply that Soviet statis-.. 
ticians used ,a total employment figure of about 77 million for 1940. 
In July 1939 military personnel constituted less than 3 million 
persons (including MVD), and forced laborers have been estimated 
at 3.5 million. Combining these three figures--771 3, and 3.5--
yields an employment figure of 8-81+ million, or only 43-44 per 
cent of the total 1940 population. 
Such an all-inclusive approach to the problem of assessing 
labor force as the "gainfully occupied" concept, however, is known 
to err in the direction of overstating actual employment due to the 
inclusion of large numbers of women and youths in rural areas who 
are engaged in farm work only on a part-time or seasonal basis. 
The concept of "employed persons" used in Narodnoye khozvavstvo, 
on the other hand, probably understates actual employment. This 
may occur in two ways: 1) the actual labor force is minimized by 
use of averages or man-year equivalents instead of "counting heads" 
employed at a given time; and 2) the actual labor force is minimized 
by disregarding persons not officially employed, marginal labor, 
and, in particular, miscellimeous and nondescript occupations. The 
most important difference between ARD estimates of "gainfully occu-
poWand Soviet data on "employed persons" refers to the category 
of collective and individual farmers. ARD's estimate, obtained as 
a residual by subracting other groups from the computed total gain-
fully occupied, amounts to 46 million, whereas as shown in Table 
2-34, following data in Narodnoye khozyaystvo SSSR a rough estimate 
of 34 million is obtained. Apart from questions of the accuracy

Part Two II. Population and Manpower  
of the method used to derive the figure of 34 million, as described 
above, it appears that the lower figure partially or fully excludes 
youths "gainfully occupied" under age 16 which, according to the 
ARD estimate, amounts to about 7 million. The remaining difference 
of 5 million could presumably be due to the use of different con-
cepts and/or inaccuracies in the methods of derivation. 
5. Distribution of Gainfully Occupied Population by Union  
Republics  
Reported Soviet data imply an employed population (exclud-
in military, forced laborers, self-employed persons, and persons 
officially not employed) in 1958 of 92.8 million (see Section F. 4). 
ARD's estimate of the gainfully occupied popullation, more compreii 
hensive in coverage than the Soviet data, indicates a gainfully 
occupied population in 1958 of nearly 111+ million. A distribution 
of the gainfully occupied population by union republic (see Table 
2-36) was obtained by computine the prewar coefficients between 
gainfully occupied in each union republic to eligible voters) 
multiplying these coefficients by the postwar number of eligible 
voters in each republic, and adjusting the resulting preliminary 
estimate to the required total. By utilizing the voting statistics 
which are tabulated on a de facto population basis, the effect is 
to produce a de facto distribution of the gainfully occupied popu-
lation, in contrast to the de jure distribution of total population 
among union republics as derived from recent Soviet data. For this 
reason, gainful employment cannot be legitimately expressed as per 
cent of the population of each union republic, but rather as the 1-
ratio of the gainfully occupied population to the total population 
of each republic (shown in Column 2 of Table 2-36). 
Inspection of Table 2-36 reveals that the ratio of gain-
fully occupied population to total population is highest in Estonia 
and Latvia. This is not surprising since it is known that the 
de jure population of these republics is significantly lower than 
the de facto population and, in addition, that these areas have a 
higher percentage of population in the working ages as a consequence 
of relatively low birth rates and relatively high proportions of 
persons in the older ages. In the Ukraine, Belorussia, and Lithuania 
the ratio of gainful employment to population is also high) in part 
due to the extensive participation of the rural population in farm

6. Trends in Main Working, Ages  
The number of persons expected to be within the main work-
ing ages (15-51) during the period 1955-75 is based upon projec-
tions of the 1955 estimated Soviet population to 1960, 1965, 1970, 
_(see Table 2-37). It has been assumed that no major war 
or calamity or significant volume of immigration or emigration will 
occur during this period. 
The number of persons in the main working ages will increase 
modestly until 1965 as a consequence of the entrance into the work-
ing ages of persons in the severely reduced birth cohorts born dur-
ing and immediately following World War I. For example annual

entrants are expected to decline from 1-i- million in 1957 to about 
2 million in 1960, but thereafter the annual number of entrants will 
again increase. The total number of persons in the main working 
ages, however, is not expected to decline between 1955 and 1960, 
since the aging of the population will, place a larger number of 
persons in the older proportion of the 15-54 age span. Thus, the 
average age of the Soviet working population in this period will 
increase significantly. This could be of importance to the Soviet 
aim of increasing worker productivity. After 1965 the working age 
population will grow at a rate approximately double that of the 
ten preceding years. 
The greatest increases in the period 1955-75 are expected 
in the male population of working age, principally as 'a result of 
the replacement of war-reduced age groups by age groups having a 
relatively equal number of men and women., Under the hypotheses 
of no wars and no international migr'ation, by 1975 the number of 
men will approximate the number of women of working age in the 
Soviet Union. 
The male population ages 15-54 is usually a rather accurate 
index of labor force, the small number of nonworking males (prin-
cipally students and technically unemployed) being compensated or 
overcompensated by persons in the labor fore above age 55 or be-
low age 15. The female population ages 15-5+ is much less accurate 
as an index of labor force and more closely approximates what 
might be termed the maximum potential female labor force under 
conditions approaching optimum stress.

' The male population eligible for military mobilization 
during the next several years is also expected to increase at a 
rapid rate. Soviet males in the prime military ages (20-34) will 
number about 29 million in 1960, as compared with about 25 million 
in 1955 (see Table 2-38), an increase of 16 per cent. In the same 
period, the number of males ages 20-34 in the U.S. is expected to 
remain constant. After 1960, however, it is anticipated that the 
number of USSR males in this age group will decline sharply and 
will show an increase only in 1975.

7. Workers and Employees1 
The current trend in Soviet planning is to achieve greater 
industrial output through increased labor productivity rather than 
through an increase in Manpower. Soviet authorities have attested 
t6 the key role of increased industrial productivity for the future 
of the Soviet economy in such recent statements as "...The growth 
of labor productivity is the decisive factor in raising the entire 
national economy. Our task is now to surpass the United States in 
the level of labor productivity... In the Sixth Five-Year Plan 
1 
Workers and employees as used here (approximating wage and sal-
ary earners in this country) comprise all persons employed by the 
state and paid wages or salaries, with the exception of the military 
and the MVD and KGB, defense workers, and full-time Communist Party 
and Komsomol workers. Includes three major groups: production 
workers, white-collar and administrative employees, and engineering-
technical personnel (ITR).

increased labor productivity must secure 85 per cent of all increase 
in industrial output." 
Although sizable increments of workers and employees will 
undoubtedly continue, the total number recruited in the future 
will probably decline, particularly during the next decade when the 
large wartime birth deficit will seriously inhibit the manpower 
reserve available for the labor force. Recent Soviet data provide 
for the first time since 1935 a consistent set of figures for 
workers and employees in terms of the total and by sectors of em-
ployment. Utilizing these data it is now possible to assess with 
greater accuracy postwar trends in the worker and employee segment 
of the economy. 
Table 2-39 reveals a gradually smaller increment of workers 
and employees during successive Five-Year Plan periods. Between 
1945-50 the total increment was 11.5 million, almost as large as 
the 12 million recruited during the First FivA-Yanr Plan, 1Q2P-12. 
At that time a large pool of workers was required immediately to 
operate the expanding industrial economy; during the remainder of 
the prewar period the increment declined considerably. During the 
initial period of postwar reconstruction it was necessary to re-
cruit vast numbers of workers and employees to replace war losses 
and rehabilitate the economy. The subsequent increment was almost 
3 million less at that time. The 8.1 million recruited during 
1951-55 included 1.4 million tractor drivers transferred in October

1953 from collective farm to MTS payrolls so that the actual in, 
-
crease of unskilled labor and trained reserves was only 6.4 million, 
or an annual average of 13- million. 
The current Five-Year Plan (1956-60) provides for an in-
crease of 7.1 million, or an average 'annual increaSe of i1+2 million. 
Reports on the 1956 Plan fulfillment, however, indicate an increment 
of 2.1 million, including 600,000 members of artels of a number of 
enterprises of producers cooperatives who officially became workers 
and employees when these enterprises became a part of state industry. 
This levy of manpower augmenting the planned increase of workers 
and employees may have been necessary to meet production goals.. 
If the plan for 55 million workers and employees by 1961 is main-
tamed, the annual average increase during the next 1+ years will 
be only 1.25 million, the lowest of any of the previous Plans. 
Of course, a gradual increase in productivity per worker may require 
a further revision of manpower needs during the remainder of the 
current Plan period. 
In January 1957 the goal of 50 mi1lidn1 workers and em-
ployees in the USSR was finally reached, and this group exceeded 
in number those working on collective farms. Since workers and 
employees are essentially urban in characteri the disparity be-
tween this group and agricultural labor should continue to increase, 
particularly as the urban population continues to expand.

the Ukrainskaya SSR, and although several of the smaller republics 
have gained at the expense of the Ukraine, the decrease in this 
republic in the 18-year period has amounted to only 2 per cent. 
Perhaps the best index in measuring the significance of 
the distribution of workers and employees is by means of differ-
ential rate of growth of the individual republics in the periods

1940-50 and 1950-58. Wartime devastation and reconstruction in the 
western areas, the transfer of industry eastward to the Urals and 
Siberia, and the postwar establishment of new industrial concentra-
tions in the east have led to the shift of workers and employees 
to the new areas. The large increases within the Kazakhskaya SSR 
during these two periods (see Table 2-40), reflect the transfer of 
evacuated industries during the war, the exploitation of local 
mineral resources, and the construction of a multitude of state 
farms and MTSs during the virgin lands program in 1954-55. The 
outstanding increases within the Moldvaskaya, Litovskaya, and Latviy-
skaya SSRs--all prewar annexations of the USSR--are the result of 
great postwar expansion and the absorption of many formerly self-
employed persons into the workers and employee segment of the labor 
force. The increments in the Ukrainskaya and Belorusskaya SSNs, 
among the lowest for the period 1940-583 were limited in ..he years

workers and employees in these two republics have increased at a 
rate which is slightly above average. 
Industrial Workers and Employees. Industrial workers 
and employees in the USSR in 1958 constitute slightly 
more than one-third of total workers and employees, and their 
geographic distribution, in general, follows the pattern of distri-
bution of the larger group. For example, 65.1 per cent of all 
workers and employees and 68.5 per cent of industrial workers and 
employees are found within the RSFSR; within many of the smaller 
republics the correspondence is even closer. 
A comparison of the rates of growth of total and industrial 
workers and employees in the period 1950-58 reveals that in about 
half the republics the magnitude of change has been fairly close 
to the national average of 32.4 per ceni. Within the RSFSR, total 
workers and employees increased 30 per cent; the industrial sector 
increased 28.5 per cent (see Tables 2-40 and 2-41). Kazakhstan is 
the outstanding exception: the increase in the over-all group was 
almost twice that of the industrial sector. An influx durinethe 
virgin lands program of approximately 200,000 agricultural workers 
plus workers and employees in the various supporting services, how-
ever, in large part contributed to this disparity. 
Within the individual republics, the increase of industrial 
workers and employees ranges from a low of 28.5 per cent in the 
RSFSR to a high of 117.6 per cent in the Litovskaya SSR (see Table 
2-41). Although in absolute terms the increase in the RSFSR was 
greatest, the low percentual increase reflects the location in this 
area of many old, relatively well-established industrial centers 
Which, in many cases, have probably reached the peak of their 
development. All other republics increased at the expense of the 
the RSFSR, although for the majority the increase was not substantial. 
The greatest increases occurred within the Litovskaya, Moldavskaya, 
Kirgizskaya, and Armyanskaya SSRst indicating that postwar industrial-
ization in the Soviet Union has not been confined to any particular 
geographic region. The outstanding growth in the Litovskaya SSR 
reflects the development of the republic's industrial potential 
to an extent comparable with that of the other two Baltic republics. 
Increases within the Ukrainskaya and Belorusskaya SSRs sugest 
continuing industrialization within these areas even though the locus

of industrial concentrations has continued to move eastivOrd. In 
those republics which in the period 1950-58 show the greatest inr 
creases, the relationship of industHal to total workers will con-
tinue to fluctuate for some years, as industrialization usually

newly released data on the distribution of industrial

Siberia together had less than 25 per cent (see Table 2-142). The 
tremendous industrial expansion in eastern areas during the war, 
when many industrial complexes were developed to offset the de-
struction of industry in the west, is reflected in the increases 
in the number of industrial workers and employees: 102 per cent 
in West Siberia, 84.6 per cent in East Siberia, and 81.5 per cent 
in the Urals (see Table 2-42).

Part Two II. Population and Manpower  
In the period 1950-58, regional increases tended to stabil-
ize. The greatest increase was in the North Caucasus Region (00.9 
per cent). The Far East, which in the earlier period had increased 
more than 90 per cent, showed a minimal growth of 6.5 per cent. 
The increases in the Urals and Siberia, about average, are rather 
surprising in the light of recent Soviet announcements of industrial 
expansion in these areas. 
Sectors of Employment. The new body of postwar data in-
'cludes information on the various branches of the Soviet 
national economy, or sectors of employment. Between 191+0 and 1958 
the total number of workers and employees increased by 20,058,000, 
or 64.3 per cent (see Table 2-43). This includes the 1.4 million 
tractor drivers and the 600,000 members of producers' cooperatives 
transferred to government payrolls. Excluding this group the in-
crease would be 18,058,000, or 57.9 per cent. 
The 1958 estimateslbased on these reported data, reveal t 
that UUSpILU au auoviuu, increase in every sector except govern-
ment administration, 7 of the 12 sectors have not kept pace with 
the total increase (see Table 240. Industry remains the largest 
sector in the national economy, comprising more than one-third of 
1 
all workers and employees, although it has not increased as much 
as has rural economy, public health, or construction. Sizable in-
crements are expected in the future, but the Soviet leaders are 
continuing to stress increased labor productivity, so-that the rate 
of increase in the futur.. P."kv decline. 
Rural economy underwent a greater percentual increase than 
any other sector; part of this increase, however, is due to the 
transfer of the 1.'4 million tractor drivers. Even without this 
groupi the increase would be 96.1 per cent, reflecting the in-
creasing role of agricultural mechanization in the national economy. 
The large increase in the construction sector betokens the 
continuing importance of construction projects of all types in Soviet 
planning. The postwar expansion of health and medical facilities, 
particularly in rural areas, and the extension of compulsory educa-
tion to 7-year and secondary schools, plus the rapid training of 
specialists for every sector of the economy, have contributed to 
the large percentual increases of the public health and education 
sectors.

In the transportation sector, the most significant post-
war development has been the rapid increase in motor vehiale and 
other nonrail and nonwater transport, so that the number of workers 
and employees in this branch is now larger than that in railroad 
transportation. 
Only one sector, government administration, has undergone 
a decrease in workers and employees, Principally the result of the 
attempt during the past few years to limit the size of the Soviet 
bureaucracy by the transfer of technically trained personnel from 
desk jobs to positions in factory and field. 
Despite comparatively laro percentual increases, none of 
the sectors, compared with 1940, comprises a much higher or lower 
proportion of the total number of workers and employees, except 
rural economy and government administration, Where the changes - 
are partly the result of arbitrary measures. Rural economy, con-h 
struction, industry, and public health show increases in per cent 
of total workers and employees, ranging from 4,8 for rural economy 
to 0.7 for public health. No change is evident in education. 
The remaining sectors have declined in per cent of total, particularly 
government administration which in 1958 is 3.14- per cent lower than 
in 1940.

Part Two II. Population and Manuffejl 
Considering the development of comparatively stable relation-
ships among the sectors, particularly during the postwar period, 
similar relationships are indicated for the future, barring further 
arbitrary changes such as the transfer in 1957 of 600,000 members 
of producers' cooperatives to industry. Industry, construction, 
rural economy, and government administration, discussed below, 
have experienced the most significant changes. 
Industry. Since the advent of the Five-Year Plan in 
1928, industry has commanded the largest share of 
workers and employees within the nonagricultural section of the 
economy. No other branch of the national economy has grown so 
rapidly (with the exception of machine-tractor stations in the post-
war period--a special case). This rapid increase occurred initially 
and at the expense of the other sectors. After reaching a peak in? 
1937, when the sector represented 37.8 per cant of, total workers and 
employees, it declined to 35.2 per cent in 1940. Since that time, 
the increase has closely approximated the total increase of workers 
and employees and in 1955 was only slightly higher than in 19140. 
As a result of attempts during the past few years to increase pro-
duction through technological advance, stimulated in part by an 
impending shortage of manpower, it appears likely that no great 
increment will occur in the near future, certainly none that will 
increase the percentage. The slight percentual increase indicated 
by the 1958 estimate reflects the addition through reclassification 
of 6010,000 members of producer cooperative artels. If this number 
were excluded, the industrial sector would represent only 35.2 per 
cent of the total, exactly the same as in 1940. 
For the first time since World War Il Soviet data have been 
reported for the ten basic industrial categories, according to per 
cent of total industrial workers. Applied to the total for workers 
and employees, these percentages yield absolute figures for each 
category. Table 2-45 lists the increase of each industrial -category 
between 1940 and 1958. To some extent the variations are ihdica-
tive of the growth and relative importance of each category. Never-
theless, more advanced technology and greater labor productivity 
may vary considerably from industry to industry, obviating the need 
for greater numbers of workers. Until more detailed information is 
available, however, an increase in the number of workers and employees

may he considered an index of increased production and expanded 
operation. Among the most significant postwar developments has 
been the rapid increase in the number of workers and employees in 
the construction materials and power industries (204 and 160 per 
cent, respectively), reflecting the emphasis on industrial con-
struction and the need for additional industrial power. The in-

flects this emphasis. The development of producers' goods indus-
tries at the expense of consumers' goods industries apparently 
continues. Since 1940, the number in the food industry has in-
creased only 27.7 per cent, less than all other categories; the 
increase in the printing industry was only 30.9 percent, and in 
light industry 41.4 per cent. As a result, light industry has 
dropped to 16.9 per cent of the total and food industry to 8.7 
per cent (see Table 2-46). Machine-building and metalworking re-
mains the largest category, representing almost one-third of all 
industrial worker.

Construction. The construction sector has continued 
? to advance slowly but steadily since the end of World 
War II, evidencing the greatest percentual increase of any sector 
other than those which have acquired personnel through the trans-
fer from other sections of the economy. The number of construction 
workers has more than doubled since 1940 and may continue to increase 
under.present Soviet plans. The 1957 plan to expand housing con-
struction, from about 30 million sq. meters in 1956 to more than 
35 million in 1957, may require additional woi-kers despite a re-
ported 10 per cent increase of labor produCtivity in 1956 by workers 
in construction. On the other hand, the reported suspension of 
some of the larger construction projects in the Soviet Far East as 
a result .of the decrease in some production goals for 1957 may 
offset any great increase in this sector. 
Rural Economy. The number of personnel in the agri-
cultural sector has fluctuated during the postwar 
period depending upon' changes in emphasis on agricultural produc-
tion and techniques of exploitation. The number of machine-tractor 
stations and state farms has increased steadily since the end of

World War II, particularly during 19514-55 when 581 new state farms 
were organized. This has resulted in a great increase in person-
nel, mostly during the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1950-55). The appar-
ently large percentual increase within this sector is somewhat 
artificial, however, since it includes the 1.:14- million tractor 
drivers transferred from collective farms to MTSs. Excluding this 
group, the per cent of total in 1955 would be only 9.2, almost the 
same as it was in 1945, although certainly an absolute increase 
over the prewar figure. The training of technical and professional 
personnel in agriculture continues to play an important role in the 
economy: in 1956, of 650,000 persons trained in factory, railroad,

Government Administration. In the 1950-55 period, 
470,000 persons employed in central government admin-
istrative posts were transferred to positions in other sectors of 
employment, notably to industry and agriculture. During 1956 the 
transfer of personnel continued and the recently revised Soviet 
economic plan for 1957 provides for an even further decrease as 
greater jurisdiction in the economic field is placed in the hands 
of republic and regional councils of the national economy. Most 
of those discharged from the state apparatus will continue to serve 
in administrative capacities on the staffs of economic institutions. 
? 8. Specialists  
Soviet leaders are exceeding proud and boastful of their 
"army nj of specialists," as they term the rapidly growing elite of 
doctors, lawyers, engineers, scientists, economists, teachers, 
agricultural experts, and managers and technicians in every branch 
of industry. This is the group which will contribute the most to-
ward the development of ihe Soviet economy into a more advanced 
technological state. That the Soviet leaders are aware of the nec-
essity to outstrip the "capitalist countries" in technology and 
science is readily apparent from their continual comparisons of 
the rate of development of their own specialists with those of 
the western countries, particularly with those of the U.S. Bul-
ganin, in a speech delivered last year to the XX Communist Party 
Congress regarding the Sixth Five-Year Plan, stated that "special-
ists are our gold reserve; we are proud of them and treasure them.

It is not surprising that some public figures in the capitalist 
countries hnv., notPd with AlArm tht their countries

The Soviet hierarchy is exerting every effort, not only 
to increase compulsory education for the masses but also to accel-
erate the production of their specialists--the "professionals" 
(those with college and advanced degrees) and the semiprofessionals 
(graduates of technical and special secondary schools). If the 
plan to train million additional specialists during the current 
Five-Year Plan (1956-60) is fulfilled, it would mean that almost 
as many will be trained during this period as were trained during 
the two previous Five-Year Plan periods, 1946-55 (see Table 2-47). 
That this plan is not exaggerated is indicated in the re-
port that 2 million students were attending higher educational 
institutions (including correspondence courses) during 1956 and 
that about 2 million were studying in technical colleges and 
other specialized secondary educational' institutions (including 
correspondence courses). In addition, the 760,000 new specialists 
reported in 1956 approaches the planned annual average of 800,000 
for the five-year period. 
During the current five-year period the emphasis on the 
training of engineers and, during the last few years, of agri-
cultural specialists, is pointed up by the plan to train more than 
650,000 of these specialists for industry, transport, construction, 
and agriculture. This would represent approximately 34 per cent of

the total professionals to be trained, and about twice the number 
of these specialists trained during the last Five-Year Plan (1951-
5'5). Serious attention is also being given to the training of 
specialists for new branches of science and technology, such as 
automation, telemechanics,radiotechnology, and atomic energy. 
In addition to regular students, a vast number of persons 
(3)+ million in 1956) employed in the various branches of the econ-
omy were attending evening schools or taking correspondence courses 
in higher and specialized secondary educational institutions. The 
other source of skilled labor and technicians is the labor reserve 
program--the factory, railroad, trade, and agricultural schools 
training young people between the ages 16-19 for positions in indus-
try, transportation, construction, and agriculture. In 1956'; of 'more 
than 650,000 finishing courses in these schools, approximately 38 
per cent were assigned to work in agriculture and the remainder were 
assigned to industry, transportation, and construction. 
In the recently published Narodnoye khozyaystvo ?SSSR, the 
specialists were listed under six basic categories: engineering 
agriculture, economics, law, health, and education. A residual num-
ber not reported has been designated "others." Among both the pro-
fessionals and semiprofessionals the greatest number are employed 
in the fields of engineering, scientific research, and teaching and 
related cultural activities. Professional engineers, although com-
prising a smaller per cent of total professionals than in 1941, are 
gradually regaining their position after heavy losses.sustained 
during the war. If the trend' continues, engineers may eventually 
comprise one-third of all professionals (see Table 2-48) 
The number of graduate research workers, mostly engaged in 
scientific research, has increased considerably during the postwar 
period. As of 1 January 1957 there were 239,000 scientists and 
scientific research workers, including over 95,000 with doctors' 
or candidate of sciences' degrees. The number of physicians has 
increased from approximately less than one per thousand in 1541 
to 1.7 per thousand in January 1958. 
Among the semiprofessionals, the number of graduates of 
engineering technical schools has increased tremendously since 
1541, outstripping the number of semiprofessionals in all other 
categories. This trend promises to continue during the current

represented only 7.7 per cent of the total number of workers and 
employees; in 1958 they are estimated to represent 18.6 per cent. 
G. Urban Living Space in the Soviet Union  
1. Urban Housing and the Growth of Urban Population  
A primary factor in any discussion of the Soviet housing 
problem is the relationship of housing construction to the growth 
of urban population. Urban population in the Soviet Union has 
been increasing since IL? beginning 
of +km%.? SovietAr 
nind.?hui: it 
%.11_ 
was not until 1929, at the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan, 
that a serious disparity between available urban housing and the 
size of the urban population manifested itself. At that time, 
materials which could have been used for new housing for the great 
influx of in-migrants were diverted into the construction of 
factories. Urban population increased 125 per cent between 1926 
and 1941, from 26.3 million to 60.6 million, and to keep pace 
with this increase, total living space should, at the least, have 
doubled. At the end of 1541, however, living space totaled only 
1-1-2.1 million sq. meters (approximately 2.5 billlion sq. ft.), as 
compared with 153.8 million sq0 meters in 1926. This is reflected 
in a per-capita decrease from 5.85 sq. meters in 1926 to sq. meters 
in 1910 (see Table 2-50). 
Official Soviet estimates place urban housing losses (total-
ly and partially destroyed) at 70 million sq. meters. And although 
the urban population also decreased during the war, the growth in 
the postwar period (1946-50) was even greater than in the immediate 
prewar period. It is evident that with the dual problem of restor-
ing destroyed housing and providing housing for the increasing 
urban population, the Soviet government was faced with a tremendous 
task. Reconstruction began almost on the heels of the retreating 
Germans and the Fourth Five-Year Plan (19)-6-50) was devoted large-
ly to the problems of restoration. In the postwar years the down-
ward trend in per-capita living space was finally reversed. By

1951 per-capita living space had increased to 4,46 sq. meters. 
It is important to note that during the period of the 
Fourth Five-Year Plan Soviet statisticians began to report urban 
"total floor space" as if it were "living space." Prior to that 
time it had been Soviet practice to divide living quarters into 
living and nonliving space--nonliving space including kitchens, 
bathrooms, hallways, vestibules, and storerooms; living space 
including rooms used solely for living purposes. Since 1948 the 
unit "total floor space," defined as the sum total of all floor 
space within living quarters, has been used. The official 
VIN 
planation for this change is that it was made to bring Soviet 
-
statistical practices in line with other countries, and it has 
also been stated that living space represents, on average, 62 
per cent of total floor space. Thus, the failure to allow for 
the changed unit of measure creates the illusion that the ratio 
of housing to population is more favorable than it actually is. 
A.total of 115.14 million sq. meters was constructed under the 
Fifth-Five-Year Plan (the planned goal was 105.14 million sq. meters 
of floor space, to be financed from state funds). In addition, 
there was constructed 38.8 million sq. meters of floor space by 
individuals, at their own expense and with state credit. By 1956 
urban housing stock had increased to 640 million sq. meters of

floor space, or 396.8 million sq. meters of living space, and per-
capita living space totaled 4.59 sq. meters (see Table 2-50). 
The Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956-60) has a planned goal of 
205 million sq. meters of floor space to be constructed by the 
state and its various agencies. No goal for the construction of 
housing by individuals has been reported. The construction of 205 
million sq. meters of floor space is nearly double the amount of 
construction completed during the previous five years, but for the 
first time construction in rural communities has been included in 
the plan figures. The living space figures in Table 2-50 for the 
years 1957-61 have been projected on the assumption that the 
Soviet Union will meet its planned objective in housing construc-
tion. As can be seen in the table, even if the planned objective 
is f,ulfilled, the per-capita living space at the beginning of 1961 
will still be less than the per-capita living space in 1926. This 
means that even by 1961 the average Soviet urbanite will occupy an 
area less than that occupied by a 9 x 12-ft. rug. 
2. Large Cities 
In analyzing Table A-91 Appendix, it should be noted that 
most of the large cities have a lower per-capita floor space in 
1956 than in 1939-40 or 1926. There is also a large regional vari-
ation in per-capita floor space. In general, the further east 
the city is located the lower the per-capita floor space. To 
some extent these regional differences may be due to the methods 
used in population counts, that is, the Soviet procedure of in-
cluding certain groups (such as forced laborers and deportees) in 
the population counts in terms of de jure rather than de facto 
residence.

With the virtual collapse of the urban Communist movement, 
the Party turned its efforts toward expansion into the rural areas 
and established its base in south-central China. The? land reform 
movement, instituted by the Party in the areas under its control, 
increased Party membership to 3000 by-1933, but repeated attacks 
by Kuomintang troops against Communist-controlled areas during the 
1934-37 period and a severe inta-Party struggle for dominance re-
duced membership to 40,000. 
Late in 1937 the Communists returned to the "United front" 
tactics of the pre-1927 period and joined the Kuomintang in resist-
ing the Japanese invasion of China. ,Membership again began to climb, 
reaching 800,000 by 1940. Members were recruited largely from the 
peasarrb-y, and the low educational level and lack of political 
training of most of the recruits create 'serious disciplinary 
problems. An "indoctrination" campaign within the Party was launched 
in 1941.42, and by 1943 Party membership was reduced to 736,151 
Thereafter, the Party expanded rapidly and by October 1949, the date 
of the founding of the People's Republic of China, membership totaled 
4,4881o80. 
Prior to the conquest of the mainland, the Party was pre-

began an intensive recruitment campaign among urban workers and 
employees and virtually halted recruitment of peasants Between 
1950 and 1954 more than two million joined the Party, and most of 
the recruits were office workers or from the industrial labor force. 
Since the inauguration of the enforced cooperative farming movement 
in 1954, the recruitment policy has again changed, and almost all 
of the six million new members have come from rural areas. 
2. Geographic Distribution of the Party  
The geographic distribution of Communist Party membership 
varies greatly both in terms of absolute size and in proportion to 
the populations of the administrative divisions. In general, vari-
ations in the incidence of Party membership may be considered one 
of the useful indices for assessing the sigWicance of an area to 
the Communist regime. 
Areas in which the incidence of Party membership is above 
average are highly urbanized and industrialized or have large.mili-
tary contingents. Those with high incidence reflect combinations 
of these factors. The heaviest concentrations of Party membership 
are found in the administrative and industrial centers of the 
northern and northeastern provinces; the lightest concentrations 
are in the southwestern and northwestern regions (see Table 3-3 
and Map IV). In only three provinces--Hopeh, Shantung, and Kiangsu--
is total membership in excess of one million. And only in Tsinghai 
Province are more than 5 per cent of the total populatioim Party 
members. Proportionally, there are almost twice as many civilian 
Party 'members in;urban areas as in rural areas (see Table 3-10 and 
in only five administrative divisions--Fukien, Inner Mongolian 
Autonomous Region, Kweichow, Kirin, and Tsinghai--are more than 5 
per cent of the urban population in-the Party. Provinces-in which 
the incidence of Party membership is above.gtverage in-rurii areas 
reflect, in partl.the presence of Communists, assoeiated.with the. 
enforced cooperative farming movement, and, in effect,.ihe extent 
of that movement.

3. Social Composition 
On the basis of current social status, it is estimated that 
almost 8.6 million Party members, or 69.1 per cent of total member-
ship, are peasants (see Table 3-5). Despite their numerical pre-
ponderance, however, the peasantry remains less "communized" than 
other sectors of the social complex, and the incidence of Party 
membership in this group is much lower. Approximately 3 per cent

status reported 
of peasants are Party members, as compared with 7 per cent of the 
total number of workers. And within the two smaller categories--
"intellectuals" (white-collar workers) and "others" (in general, 
members of the armed forces)--the proportion of Party members is 
more than four times greater than among the peasants. 
The numerical preponderance of the peasantry will continue 
in the foreseeable future and may even increase as the regime ad-
vances its collectivization program. The numerical growth of 
Party membership in the other categories will probably parallel 
the growth of the categories themselves, resulting in slight pro-
portional increases. 
4. Occupational Composition  
The occupational composition of Partymembership reflects 
the same phenomena as does the social composition: numerically, 
agriculture is the largest category but is weakest in terms of 
proportional relationship. More than 7 million Communists, or 
57.9 per cent of total Party membership, are engaged in agriculture 
(see Table 3-6), but this number represents only slightly more than

breakdown of the nonagricultural labor force is ayailable, it is 
estimated that Communists in the industrial labor force are pro-
portionally more than five times as numerous as in the agricultural 
labor force. In the other categories (excluding Party professionals) 
it is believed that the proportion of Communists is at least as high 
as in the industrial labor force and probably is highest in the 
people's organization category, which includes state administrative 
employees. The estimated 715,000 Party professionals, the full-
time employees of the Party apparatus constitute the most important

5. Age-Sex Structure  
By 1 January 1958 it is estimated that more than 8 million 
Party members, or 67.6 per cent of the total membership, will be 
between the ages of 25 and 46 (see Table 3-7). The top leadership 
of the Party falls mostly within the more-than-46 age cohort, and 
most of the older members are, of course, also senior in terms of 
Party tenure. The emphasis in current recruitment campaigns, how-
ever, is on the younger elements of Chinese society, for it is felt 
that they are not only more enthusiastic and patriotic but are also 
more pliable. Proportionally, this group may be expected to in-
crease more rapidly in the near future while the older elements will

Male membership in the Chinese Communist Party, as of 1 
January 1958, is estimated to total 11.2 million, or almost 90 
per cent of total membership. Females constitute a small Party 
minority nationally; however, in a few provinces in the northern 
and eastern regions, female membership reportedly is as high as 30 
per cent of total provincial membership. Nationally, there are 9 
female Party members per 1,000 adult women and approximately 142 
male Communists per 1,000 adult males. 
6. Epliy Organization  
Under the revision of the Communist Party Constitution by 
the VIII National Congress in 1956, the Central Party organization 
was expanded but ihe structure of the Party as a whole remained 
unchanged. Membership of the Eighth Central Committee was increased 
from 144 to 97 full members and from 23 to 73 alternate members. 
Membership of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee was also 
increased from 13 to 17 full members and a Standing Committee of the 
Political Bureau was created. According to the new Party statute, 
representatives to the National Party Congress are now elected for 
five-year terms and the Congress convenes annually. (As of April 
1957, however, no call had been made for the 1957 Congress.) 
Despite the expansion of central organizations, however, 
leadership at the top remains unchanged. Thirty-eight of the 41 
Seventh Central Committee full members were reelected and all but 
two of the former alternates were elected full members. Mao Tse-tung 
continued as chairman of the Committee, with four vice-chairmen and a 
secretary general.

The Cheng feng movement will probably continue through most 
of 1957 in preparation for the Second Five-Year Plan which opens 
in 1958. Consequently, Party recruitment will probably operate at 
a low level during the campaign period. 
8. The Communi0. Party Youth, Leaue 
Growth and Distribution. Founded only eight years ago, the 
Youth League of the Chinese Communist Party will have a 
membership in excess of 22 million by 1958. In 1952, three years 
after its organization, the League had 8.3 million members, organ-
ized in 360,000 League brancheso later, the Communist press 
reported 12 million members or 500,000 branches. League member.-
totaled 16 million in 1955, and toward the end of 1956, re-
portedly totaled 20 million, or 17 per cent of all Chinese youth. 
Judging from recruitment plans and reports of League activities 
appearing in official publications, membership will exceed 22 mu-
ship 
A year 
lion by 19 
estimated that by 1958 League members in 
rural areas will total 13 million, or 21.8 per cent of all rural 
Youth; about 75 per cant of these are members ni agricultural 
Producers cooperatives and about 270,000 hold key positions in 
cooperative administration. 
The heaviest concentration of Youth League members, about 
6 million, is found in the eastern provinces. Four million are in 
the northeastern and northern provinces, including the Inner Mong-
olian Autonomous Region; and 5 million are in the central and south-
ern provinces. Only 2 million members are from the northwestern 
and southwestern provinces; another 2 million are estimated to be 
in the armed forces. The remaining 2 million have not been located.

May 1957 in Peking, the Communist Party Youth League was 
called the New Democratic Youth League. Sponsored by the Chinese 
Communist Party, the League is the equivalent of the Komsomol in 
the Soviet Union. Its members are youths from 15 to 26 years of 
age (approximately the same age range as the Komsomol). And al-
though officially a league member must resign upon reaching 26 
years of age, there are indications that a few members are between 
the ages of 26 and 28. The League is used as a tool to organize 
China's younger generation and to build a strong base for future 
support of its aims and policies. It also serves as ,a Party school 
for teaching Marxist-Leninist principles and for preparing future

Communist Party members. It is estimated that 2)4- million former 
Youth Leaguers will be members of the Communist Party by 1958. 
Although organizationally independent, the League functions 
under the political direction of the Communist Party. All League 
committee secretaries are Party members and serve dually as provincial 
or hsien Party committee members League members also occupy im-
portant positions as assistants in the promotion of the Party's 
programs and objectives. They are used most frequently in local 
administration as members of administrative committees, people's 
supervisory committees, and cultural or educational committees. 
The organization of tha Youth LK"gue follows ^1^sely the 
organization

organization of the Communist Party itself. The League has a 
Central Committee, a provincial committee in each province, a city 
committee in each city, and local working committees-throughout the 
country, with branches or primary organs in all factories, mining 
districts, and other industrial organizations, as well as in schools, 
military units, and rural areas. 
B. Government  
The functions, role, philosophy, and fundamental organiza-
tion of the government of the Chinese People's Republic, as outlined 
in the 1957 Annual Estimates, have remained intact, and little 
change is foreseen in the immediate future. The highest positions 
in the governmental apparatus will continue to be held by the ranking 
officials of the Communist Party and most, if not all, officials 
down to and including hsiang (township) committeemen will be Party 
members and therfore responsible to the Party apparatus for their 
acts as government officials. The trAnd toward decentralization of 
decision-making so noticeable in the Soviet Union and its European 
satellites will probably not be manifest in China by January 1958. 
On the contrary, the trend toward greater centralization and 
specialization of agencies observed during the past few years will 
probably continue well into 1958. It is feat that only substantial 
successes by those Communist states participating in the decentral-
ization movement, would encourage China to follow suit. The availa-
bility of reliable cadres, requisite skills and techniques, and the 
dictates of tf)e geographic complex indicate that the "loosening 
of the bonds" in China will only occur in the more distant future.

1. Central Government  
The most significant changes which have occurred during the 
past year at the central government level have been in the details 
of organization of the State Council, the operational focus of state 
power. The trend toward proliferation of specialized economic min-
istries and agencies has continued, and the current (April 1957) 
Council now comprises the premier, 42 ministries, 7 commissioners, 
16 bureaus, and 3 aencies attached to the Council (see Figure 3-1).

in the role of the apparatus of the premier in order that adequate 
coordination if not control is exercised. 
Available data suggest that there has been no public dis-
cussion of possible alternate solutions which include a simplifica-
tion of the central apparatus through merger of complementary agen-
cies or, more significantly, a transfer of authority over economic 
activities to the lower levels of government. Of the possible al-
ternatives, it is felt that the merger approach will probably be 
tried before any attempt at decentralization. 
2. Provincial Government  
There have been no significant changes in the functions, 
role, or organization of China's 23 provinces and 2 autonomous re-
gions.1

to have been completed and no significant changes in administrative 
boundaries have occurred since April 1956. It is felt that the 
status and geographic areas of the major administrative divisions 
of Communist China will remain fairly constant in the immediate future. 
3. Local Government  
Developments at the local governmental level during the past 
year have been intimately connected with the progress of the co-
operative farming movement. The authority of hsiang (township) 
governments has grown considerably as the farmlands within their 
territorial confines have been organized and reorganized into co-
operative and collective farms. Earlier, their authority in agri-
culture was limited largely to serving as channels for the trans-
mission of orders from the provincial government to the thousands 
of individual peasant households which worked the land. At present 
they are at least indirectly responsible for the administration and 
plan fullfillment of the dozens of "unified" farms under their 
jurisdiction. 
1A Preparatory Committee for Tibetan Autonomy was created in 
April 1955, but no formal grant of autonomy has been made as of this 
date. The theoretically special status of autonomous divisions in 
China (regions, chou, hsien, and hsiang) is largely limited to 
"titles" and they have functions and roles identical with their 
nonautonomous equivalents.

Part Three I. The People's Republic of China  
Coincident with the growth in the authority of the township 
government there has been a great increase in their territorial 
jurisdiction. Their number has been reduced from more than 200,000 
in 1955 to approximately 100,000 in 1957. This augmentation of the 
power and jurisdiction of local government has had two basic aims: 
1) to destroy the remnants of the Pao-Chia or "village elder" 
system and 2) to make government units coincide territorially with 
the planned areas of the new collective farms. The Pao-Chia system 
is based on households, with 10 households equaling a chia; 20 chia, 
a pao; and 15 pao, a township. At each level the heads of house-f 
hol-ds, usually 'he senior male members of the family, are in author-
ity. The system has been conservative in outlook and highly re-
sistant to pressures from the outside, whether from war lords, the 
Nationalists, or the Communists. Initially the Communists attempted 
to govern the villages through the system by placing their own 
personnel at the township and pao levels. Failing this attemPil 
they are now trying to destroy the system in its entirety by re-
placing the pao and chia with "people's congresses" and by alter-
ing the apex through the amalgamation of townships* While the 
formal structure may change completely in the year ahead, the in-
formal relationships established over centuries will probably con-
tinue and will seriously inhibit the implementation of Communist 
control over Chinese agriculture. 
1+. Government C9ntrol Centers  
The growth and distribution of major and alternate govern-
ment control centers in The People's Republic of China accurately 
reflects the development and location of channels of Communist con-
trol over the peoples of China "in general, the number-of major 
centers has decreased while the number of alternates has grown. 
These changes reflect the centralization of control over regions 
and the development of new industrial bases. 
The reduction in the number of major government control 
centers from 35 in 1947 under the Nationalist regime to 26 in 1957 
(see Table 3-8 and Map V) is a direct result of the consolidation 
of provinces undertaken by the Communists shortly after their assump-
tion of power. These major centers consist of the republic capital, 
Peking, and the capitals of the 23 provinces and 2 autonomous re-
gions. Each of the provincial or regional capitals administers

Chi-nan, Ha-erh-pin, Shanghai, T'ien-ching,are regional headquarters 
of the Chinese railroad system, which is the only reliable all-

Kuang-chou and Shen-yang are also military control centers. 
? The number of alternate government control centers, cities 
of provincial and autonomous region subordination exclusive of the 
capitals, has increased from 29 to 110 since 1947. Most of this 
increase results directly from the development of new industrial 
and mining centers in the interior regions. The majority of secon-
dary industrial centers, however, remain concentrated in such 
established industrial provinces as Hopeh, Liaoning, and Szechwan. 
Each of these cities contains agencies which could assume province-
wide authority if their counterparts at the province capital were 
incapable of functioning. 
C. Political Economy  
, On 1 January 1958 the People's Republic of China will begin 
its Second Five-Year Plan which envisages a doubling of the gross 
national product. Thus will open the second stage of the long-
term Chinese effort to solve China's desperate triangle of food, 
population, and forced industrial growth. China's burgeoning 
population will continue to press inexorably upon available food 
supplies, perpetuating the internal pressures which curb and 
circumscribe Peking's ambitious program of industrial expansion. 
1. Agriculture  
Since 1949 China's population has grown from 540 million 
to an estimated 623 million (1958); and with each year it increases 
by an additional 10 million. Meanwhile, food production?although 
it too has grown--has failed to surpass the minimal requirements

for sustaining these millions and for investment in industrial 
construction. Already Communist leaders have revealed the critical 
nature of the problem by adopting drastic measures to increase 
supplies of food available to the state, to control rigidly the 
distribution of foodstuffs, and even to retard future population 
growth. 
Although competing demands for industrial investment have 
compelled the regime to maintain at low levels its investment in 
improving the conditions and techniques of agriculture, unceasing 
Communist pressures have led to the expansion of agriculture into 
marginal and submarginal farming areas. Corresponding pressures 
upon the peasant population to join cooperative and collective 
farms in which the state enforces a policy of "grain distribution 
first to the state and second to the cooperative members" have 
brought control of agricultural products firmly into the hands of 
the regime. And these practices have been accompanied since 1955 
by a direct Communist effort to curb population growth by popular-
izing and encouraging birth-control measures despite the fact that 
such measures run counter both to Marxist principles and to Chinese 
social mores. 
The foregoing policies have led to some increases in food 
production and to state seizure of "hidden" agricultural reserves, 
but the food shortage remains acute. Moreover, the regime's birth 
control measures have had no visible impact upon the pattern of 
population growth, nor are they likely to in the foreseeable future. 
While the government has carefully maintained the illusion of public 
well-being through the publication of apparently inflated statistics 
on crop production, the real consequence of Communist policy has 
been a steady decline in living standards in town and country and 
the delivery of a destructive blow to peasant initiative. 
2. Industry  
An atmosphere of official optimism pervades the Communist 
approach to the problem of economic construction in the coming 
five-year plan, but serious obstacles still stand in the way of 
China's industrial growth. Despite the regime's plan to expend 
60 per cent of the total national revenue on industry, and two-thirds 
of that on capital mnstruction, the country's industrial growth 
will continue to lag behind official expectations. Limited means

for capital investment, barriers to increases in industrial produc-
tion, and the absence of trained manpower reserves will circOmscribe 
severely the Communist Party's ability to establish and sustain 
high levels of economic growth. 
Sources for capital investment have been limited largely 
to surpluses which could be drawn from agricultural production 
and to Soviet economic aid. Since these not only have remained at 
comparatively low levels throughout the period of the First Five-
Year Plan but exhibit no ability to increase significantly in the 
near future, it cannot be expected that the pace of investment will 
quicken. The seriousness with which the regime regards this restric-
tion is evidenced by the strenuous efforts of Communist leaders to 
encourage economy at every level of production and consumption in 
the country. There has been, in fact, a hint that the government 
might consider future foreign investment in China's economy in 
Chou En-lai's recent suggestion that China would be willing to 
develop "economic, technical, and cultural contacts" with non-
Soviet countries. 
The problem of investment has been and will continue to be 
magnified by inefficient use of available resources. Largely, 
this is the consequence of Communist inexperience in planning, the 
absence of sufficient knowledge of internal economic conditions, 
and the effort to maximize the pace of industrialization at any 
cost. During the First Five-Year Plan, these factors led, among 
other things, to overinvestment in capital constructbn at the ex-
pense of current production, to faulty allocation of scarce materials 
among industries, to breakdowns and bottlehecks in the distribution 
system, to irrational uses of available materials and to a general 
decline in the quality of goods produced. 
That these same problems will recur during the Second Fivp-
Year Plan is a certainty. Indeed, many of them still afflict in-
dustrial production in the USSR which boasts 30 years of experience 
in total economic planning. In China the problems are infinitely 
more serious. For one thing, the absence of a modern transporta-
tion system has hindered and will continue to hinder the orderly 
exchange of goods and services on a nationwide scale. The rigid-
ities of the bureaucratic system of economic administration, more-
over, prevent easy adaptations by parts of the industrial machinery

to unexpected changes in local economic conditions. Of far greater 
significance, the Communist regime has eliminated the market as a 
controlling factor in economic production without replacing it 
with a reliable system of economic indices and barometers. And 
this factor has tended to obscure the perception by planners and 
managers of the realities of their economic situation and has often 
prevented them from acting rationally. 
Beyond this, the Communist shock calTipaign to create a modern 
economy in China continues to lag for lack of trained troops to 
? 
man the industrial battlements, 
still remains a country with vast reserves of unskilled labor and 
acute shortages of experienced managerial personnel and skilled 
industrial workers. Many of the most striking instances of indus-
trialwaste and inefficiency during the past several years can be 
traced directly to this source. To overcome this problem, the re-
gime has introduced broad-scale programs to train cadres of man-
agers, technicians, and skilled workers 'at every level of the ed-
ucational system. But the training periods are by their nature 
lengthy; and several years will pass before their graduates enter 
the industrial area in etfective numbers. In the interim, the 
mistakes of managerial and technical inexperience will continue 
to hamper achievement of the regime's economic goals. 
3. Consumer Industry and Trade 
It is characteristic of the Soviet type of economic adminis-
tration to show little real interest in the development of light 
and consumer goods industries and in the organization of an efficient 
system of retail trade outlets during the initial period of planned 
industrial expansion. As have their counterparts in the Soviet 
Union during an earlier period, Communist China's economic planners 
have neglected and are continuing to neglect this area of economic 
activity. Inattention to the development of the light and con-
sumer goods industries led to a sharp decline in the availability 
of consumer goods during the First Five-Year Plan. And-the state 
compounded the difficulty by interfering in the existing system 
of retail distribution. In the winter of 1955-56, the regime herded 
90 per cent of the country's urban small producers into cooperatives 
and joint state-private enterprises. Originally Communist leaders 
bkad planned to complete the socialization of small traders and pro-
ducers by 1957, but the deepening consumer goods crisis which followed

the original assault compelled them to postpone action until the 
end of the Second Five-Year Plan. 
The same kind of problems have plagued Communist policy in 
the rural areas. The collectivization of agriculture and the re-
sulting state seizure of agricultural surpluses have forced rural 
incomes to new lows and have provided the impetus for a new migra-
tion of destitute peasants to urban centers. To overcome the crisis 
and to reestablish the flow of consumer goods in rural China, the 
government began in 1956 to encourage "subsidiary" production 
(cottage industry) among the collectivized peasantry. The year 
1957 thus witnessed a rapid rise in the number of smal producers 
and traders on the countryside, a trend which is destined to con-
tinue well into the period of the Second Five-Year Plan. 
D. Population and Manpower  
1. Size 
The crucial population problem is one of many that face the 
Chinese Communists. For centuries the balance between food supply 
and population in China has been a fine one, and seldom has a year 
passed without famine in some area. Nevertheless, each year the 
population increases by ten million, and now totals an estimated 
623 million (1958). The Communists have been slow to admit the 
problem and until recently the official line, in effect, stated 
that China is a country of vast new lands and unexploited natural 
resources where the rate of production is increasing more rapidly 
than the population. Now, although the problem is admitted it 
remains veiled in Communist gobbledygook. A birth-control program 
has been initiated, attempts are being made to cultivate previously 
unused lands, and people are being resettled in areas where a better 
balance exists between food production and population. It is ques-
tionable, however, whether the regime can adequately provide for 
the rapid population growth through these reforms. It is also 
doubtful whether the Chinese economy can develop rapidly enough 
to provide employment for so many new hands when unemployment and 
underemployment admittedly prevail in both the urban and rural seg-
ments of the population. 
It is estimated that by 1 January 1958 the population of 
the Chinese People's Republic will total 623 million (see Table 
3-9). A projection of the 1953 Census figure of 582.6 million,

the 1958 estimate contradicts the 2 per cent rate of natural in-
crease reported in the Census but is supported by a figure pub-
lished in 1956 which indicates that the annual rate of population 
increase in China has averaged 1.5 per cent since the Census. 
Based on the latter rate, it is estimated that by 1962 China's 
population will have increased 38 million over the 1958 figure 
and will total 661.2 million. This estimate is probably conserva-
tive, since an anticipated drop in the current mortality rate will 
probably be coupled with a continuing high birth rate.

2. Migration  
For several years the Chinese Communists have been engaged 
in a program of resettlement to increase food production through 
reclamation of waste lands and to relieve the pressure of surplus 
population in the densely populated regions of central and coastal 
China. Migrants have been drawn chiefly from the provinces of 
Shantung, Honan, Hopeh, and Kiangsu and from several of the larger 
cities such as Shanghai, Tientsin, Peking and Canton. The majn 
regions of the new settlement are within Heilungkiang, Tsinghai, 
Kansu, and Inner Mongolia. 
Although the mainland press has devoted considerable space 
to this program and the general volume of the movement is apparent, 
it is not possible to determine the distribution of the migrants 
between the provinces of departure and settlement. The time ele-
ment is often vague, and data are generally presented for groups

of provinces in such a way that there is no possibility of extract-
ing figures for a particular province. 
A Chinese report states that in 1956, the first year of 
organized migration, more than 725,000 persons migrated to new 
areas and that this number exceeds the total number of migrants 
between 1949 and 1955. On the basis of this statement, 1.4 million 
migrants since 1949 would be a reasonable estimate. Assuming, for 
illustrative purposes, that the transfer of population took place 
between the eight provinces mentioned as principal participants, 
the 1:4 million constituted 1+.3 per cent of the population of the 
four provinces of in-migration but only 0.8 per cent of the popula-
tion of the four provinces of departure. The significance is ob-
vious: although migration could substantially alter the relative 
size of the population and modify the economic life of the sparsely 
settled areas of in-migration, a minimal rate of natural increase 
would more than compensate for the migratory losses. 
The migrants may be roughly divided into three groups. 
The first and the largest are the peasants, who usually migrate 
by households. In the spring of 1956, for example, 143,698 rural 
families moved into Heilunekiang to cultivate new lands. Another 
large group consists of young volunteers who come from both urban 
and rural areas. For example, 90 per cent of the 40,000 persons 
who recently arrived in Sinkiang were between the ages of 18 and 
25. The third group consists of urban unemployed, vagrants, and 
small groups of specialists, who provide labor for projects in the 
isolated regions. 
The future rate of migration will probably be greater than 
in 1956, for the Chinese government estimates that China has 250 
million acres of wasteland and that one-third of this can be re-
claimed during the course of several five-year plans. Assuming 
that this reclaimed land will be settled as densely as China as a 
whole, it would provide a living for some 22 million persons. This 
would involve a tremendous migratory movement but would result in 
the resettlement of a number equivalent only to the nations natural 
increase over a two-year period.

made, it has not been possible to allow for population changes as 
a result of migratory shifts. Even if it were possible, however, 
to estimate the variations by province, the changes would hardly 
be significant. In the province of Heilungkiang, for example, 
which received the largest share of the in-migrants, the total 
population has reportedly increased only two per cent as a result 
of the arrival of the settlers; and in the provinces of out-migration,

Part Three I. The People's Republic of China 
Since in the West, industrialization and urbanization gen-
erally go hand in hand, it may seem surprising to find such a slow 
rate of urban growth in China. However, several compensatory fac-
tors tend to produce a minimal growth. Factors tending to increase 
the size of the urban population in China are 1) industrialization, 
with an accompanying influx of rural in-migrants to the cities; 
2) the building of new industrial towns in the interior of the 
country; and 3) natural increase of the urban population. Factors 
contributing to a decrease of the urban population or hindering its 
growth are 1) government restrictions on urban in migration; 2) 
government efforts to return peasants to the land and the movement 
of urban population into new areas of agricultural development; 
3) shortages of skilled labor, capital investment, and equipment; 
and LO the existing urban unemployment which has to be absorbed 
by the economy. After a decade or so, with the absorption of the 
urban unemployed and an increasing number of skilled personnel and 
continued industrial growth, the rate of growth of the urban popula-
tion will accelerate. 
Provincial Distribution. The size of the urban population 
of China and its provincial distribution have remained 
relatively stable since the turn of the century. The greatest 
change occurred as a result of the industrialization of Manchuria, 
where a number of cities experienced sizable increases in popula-
tion during the 1920s and 1930s. This growth in the northeastern 
provinces has continued under the Communists, and therefore the 
three Manchurian provinces of Liaoning, Heilungkiang, and Kirin 
constitute the most highly urbanized region of China (see Table 
3-12). 
The new policy to develop the national economy will probably 
result in a modest redistribution of urban population. The Second 
Five-Year Plan calls for the construction of new industrial bases 
in the inland areas "according to the principle of location of 
natural resources and sensible distribution of productivity," whigh 
indicates that provinces in the western part of China will receive 
disproportionate amounts of capital for economic expansion and 
urban growth. it is too early to quantify the results of these plans, 
however, to the extent of making adjustments in provincial distribu-
tions of the urban populations.
