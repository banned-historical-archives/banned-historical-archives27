 INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM
 Communist China:   Some Economic Aspects
 Of The New Educational System
 Introduction
 For three years formal education in Communist
 China effectively ceased while teachers and
 students participated in the intrigues and struggles
 of the Cultural Revolution. By the 1969-70 school
 year, classes had resumed in most primary and
 secondary schools,  Teachers and students in China's
 colleges and universities, however, were still
 being "re-educated" by the workers and peasants.
 This phase of re-education now seems to be coming
 to an end, and higher education is beginning to
 function again.
 Most appraisals have centered on the effects
 of the four-year break in higher education on
 China's chronically short supply of scientific
 and technical marpower and have dealt only
 peripherally with the effects of the upheavals in
 the primary and secondary educational systems.
 This memorandum outlines some of the longstanding
 problems which have beset primary and secondary
 school education in China and discusses the reforms
 adopted during and subsequent to the Cultural
 Revolution to meet these problems.  It then relates
 these reforms to Chinese Communist economic develop-
 ment policy and concludes with an assessment of
 the long-term outcome of the reforms.
 Note:  This memorandum was produced solely by CIA.
 It was prepared by the Office of Euonomi.c Research
 and was coordinated with the Office of Scientific
 Intelligence.

 Students trained under this system
 were not accustomed to physical
 labor, could not tell one variety
 of grain from another, had no
 praoticaZ knowledge of the struggle
 for production and scientific ex-
 periment, and divorced themselves
 from the working people.
 Peking domestic broadcast,
 20 September 1970
 Early Developments
 1.   The educational system taken over by the
 Communist regime in 1949 provided for six years
 of primary school, six years of middle school
 (three lower and three upper), and four or more
 years of college and was open to only minuscule
 segments of the population.  The old system was
 humanistic, urban-oriented, elitist, and responsive
 to the needs of the ruling classes -- the land-
 owners, the military, and the big businessmen.
 2.  The long-term aim of the new regime was
 to reverse this traditional orientation and to
 root out the scholar mentality of aloofness from
 technology, manual labor, political struggle,
 and contact with the lower classes.  Under the
 Communists, science and engineering rapidly ex-
 panded in the curriculum at the expense of the
 humanities in order to meet the requirements
 of a Soviet-style economic development strategy
 which emphasized the growth of heavy industry.
 3.  The number of students enrolled was rapidly
 expanded in the first years of Communist rule, as
 follows:

 Practical Problems
 4.  A number of practical problems for educa-
 tion soon appeared during these early years of
 expansion:
 -- competition for resources for
 education when industry and construc-
 tion werls being pushed forward so
 vigorously.
 -- special difficulties of the
 countryside, where school facilities
 were limited, teachers fewer and less
 competent, and dropout rates higher.
 -- continued necessary reliance
 on teachers, books, and methods in-
 herited from the old eras.
 -- the small number of places in
 the schools in relation to the popu-
 lation of student age and the con-
 tinued advantage enjoyed by well-
 connected people in gettirg their
 children into the schools.  Despite
 rapidly increased enrollments, only
 1% of the college-age group was in
 college in 1957/58.
 5.  Whereas the small numbers of graduates of
 higher level scientific and technica? schools were
 readily absorbed by China's rapidly expanding
 modern industry, large numbers of primary and
 middle school graduates were unable either to
 continue schooling or to find employment.  Accord-
 ing to one estimate, urban unemployment grew by
 at least 400,000 annually during the First Five-
 Year Plan period  (1953-57).
 Leap Forward Developments
 6.  In 1958 the regime touted t,,e Great Leap
 Forward as the solution to the i;ajor problems of
 education and unemployment.  A rapid expansion of
 economic activities along labor-intensive lines
 and the enthusiastic establishment of "part-work,
 part-study" schools for a time seemed to have

 CONFIDENTIAL
 accommodated everyone who wanted employment or
 schooling.  But it soon became obvious that these
 solutions were illusive.  Many of the new factories
 produced unusable items and eventually were shut
 down; many of the work-study schools did not educate
 and gradually disappeared.
 7.  As the Leap Forward ebbed in 1959, the old
 problems reappeared in aggravated form.   The
 authorities again turned to their propaganda
 apparatus and encouraged China's youth to carve out
 careers in the rural areas.  The regime backed up
 its propaganda by penalizing those who refused to
 "go down to the countryside."  During the early
 and mid-1960s perhaps as many as 40 million edu-
 cated youths and other urban residents were com-
 pelled or otherwise persuaded to go to the rural
 areas to relieve the pressures on China's cities.
 8.  Many of those sent to the countryside in the
 late 1950s and early 1960s made valuable contribu-
 tions.                                    Education in the rural areas lagged far
 behind urban education, and the injection of ad-
 ditional educated people almost certainly had some
 positive effect.   In rural areas, only 50%-60% of
 primary-age children were attending schools in some
 places, and the attrition rate was so high in these
 areas that perhaps only half of those attending
 graduated.  Furthermore, fewer than 25% of local
 cadres had more than a primary education.   This
 contrasted with urban areas where frequently
 80%-90% of primary-age children were enrolled and
 where cadres often had some higher education --
 for example, 52% of the major governing body in
 Wuhan had some higher education.  But by-and-large
 those sent down from urban to rural areas knew
 little or nothing about agriculture and thus were
 of little use in solving the basic rural problem --
 that of modernizing agriculture and raising output.
 Skills Required in the Countryside
 9.  In 1962 the regime adopted a series of
 policies aimed at restoring growth in China's
 agriculture chiefly through increasing the availa-
 bility of modern inputs -- chemical fertilizer,
 irrigation pumps, electric power, better seed,
 and more advanced technology.  The regime also

 CONFIDENTIAL
 recognized that efficient use of these capital
 inputs to agriculture required more highly skilled
 agricultural labor.  Several national conferences
 were held in 1964 and 1965 to discuss the expansion
 of rural work-study schools with an agro-technical
 curriculum.  The focus of these conferences on
 primary and secondary education suggested that the
 increasingly large numbers of half-educated and
 chronically underemployed youth would be used in
 the struggle for increased agricultural production.
 These tentative steps toward reorienting primary
 and secondary education were essentially suspended
 in 1966-68 during the Cultural Revolution.  In 1969,
 however, the regime readdressed itself to the
 problem of making better use of China's youth in
 the countryside.
 10.  Throughout China, small, yet relatively
 complete systems of plants currently are being
 financed and constructed by counties, communes,
 and production brigades to provide modern and
 semi-modern inputs for agriculture.  Although the
 small plants are probably most important in the
 chemical fertilizer industry, small plants for
 manufacturing and repairing agricultu3al machinery
 also have been built, as have small steel, cement,
 and hydroelectric plants.  Agricultural. supply,
 marketing, and credit functions have also been
 shifted to the local levels --- communes and production
 brigades -- and personnel working in they a fields
 have been instructed to exert themselves to pro-
 vide the peasants with timely supplies and credit,
 11.  These new plants and the commercial and
 credit network require managers and workers with a
 basic knowledge of agriculture -- its needs, the
 timing of activities, and the like -- in order to
 provide usable, timely inputs.  A main objective
 of the reforms of primary and secondary education
 adopted in 1969 and 1970 is the expansion of the
 number of people with such knowledge.  An expansion
 of rural education facilities and a focusing of
 curriculum on agricultural knowledge is seen by
 the leadership as a major means of providing China

 with a rapidly growing supply of educated manpower
 on which to base the rural development effort.*
 Nature of the Reform:w
 12.  Most of the educational reform proposals
 are not new to the Chinese leadership.  Rather,
 they are the product of experiences gaine: from
 the Resist-Japan University of the Yenan days, the
 work-study schools of the Great Leap Forward, and
 those agricultural middle schools and other part-
 Work, part-study people's schools that continued
 to exist throughout the 1960s.  The reforms are
 spelled out, in the paragraphs that follow, but for
 a quick look at the main features of the old and
 the new systems, see the chart.
 13.  Two politically authoritative sources are
 given as the point of departure for the reforms.
 One is Mao Tse-tung's 7 May 1966 letter to Lin Piao;
 the other is Mao's Shanghai Machine Tool Plant
 directive publicized in July 1968.  The former
 asserts that "while the students' main'task is to
 study, they should, in addition to their studies,
 learn other things; that is, industrial work,
 farming and military affairs."  In the Shanghai
 Machine Tool Plant directive, Mao reportedly
 remarked:   "It is essential to shorten the lengtr
 of schooling, revolutionize education, put pro-
 letarian politics in command, and take the road
 of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant in training
 technicians from among the workers.  Students
 should be selected from among workers and peasants
 with practical experience, and they should return
 to production after a few years' study."
 *  The conclusions of several Western economists
 notably, Abramovitz, Kendrick, Denison, and
 Schultz -- that the tremendous increases in per
 capita pro,.4"uct in the now-developed countries de-
 rive primarily from a rise in efficiency, point
 out the importance of an educated work force.
 Technical knowledge does not automatically take
 root in a traditional society.   It can, and does,
 establish itself when that society has had many of
 its members exposed to a more systematic approach
 to knowledge, especially knowledge related to pro-
 duction and distribution.

 14.  The specifics of the reforms which stemmed
 from these directives vary by locale and type of
 school, but the reforms can be outlined briefly,
 as follows,
 The heretofore twelve years of primary/
 middle school education is to he shortened
 to nine or ten years, while higher educa-
 tion is generally to be of two or three
 years' duration;
 The curriculum is to be pared to a core
 of essential courses -- including politics
 and the thought of Mao Tse-tung;
 More importantly, courses are to be more
 specifically related to industrial and
 agricultural production and examinations
 are to test the students' ability to
 analyze and solve problems rather than
 their ability to memorize;

 ?                             CONFIDENTIAL
 The responsibilities for financing and
 operating primary and middle schools are
 to be shifted from the central authorities
 to local units, and workers and peasants
 are to participate in administration and
 management as well as assist in teaching
 the practice-oriented courses;
 Both theory and its applications are to
 be taught, but productive labor is to
 receive greater emphasis than in earlier
 years;
 Finally, criteria for admission of
 students to intermediate schools and
 colleges are heavily weighted toward
 those having work experience.
 Reforms in College-level and Intermediate Technical
 Education
 15.  For intermediate technical schools, agri-
 cultural colleges, and medical colleges the reforms
 give top priority to the "popularization of
 knowledge."  For many institutions of higher edu-
 cation this means relocation in the ccuntryside.
 It is reported that all colleges and universities

 and that only nine of 62 colleges remained in
 Peking as of February 1970.  A common method of
 popularization is the mobile team of instructors
 who not only teach the peasants but also help
 them solve immediate problems.  For example,
 technical teams will be teaching the peasants
 the basic principles of electric power generation
 as well as helping them solve the more difficult
 problems they encounter in constructing small
 hydroelectric plants.
 16.  Although the emphasis is on popularization,
 quality education and research are not to be
 neglected.   "Barefoot doctors" are acknowledged
 ?                to be lacking in systematic theoretical knowledge
 and consequently are unable to "save patients in
 a critical state or to perform surgical operations."
 ?                Thus advanced courses are to be run for select
 students in order to train medical personnel "com-
 plete with ability and integrity."  As for medical

 research, it has been suggested that "some teaching
 staff should also be kept in the colleges  them-
 selves .  .  . for carrying out research in doubtful
 and difficult cases and for essential high-standard,
 incisive, and pioneering projects."  Clearly,
 quality education and research are not being
 abandoned.
 17.  Reform in volleges of science and tech-
 nology focuses on closer cooperation of schools,
 factories,.and scientific research units.   In-
 terestingly, reforms with similar cooperative
 objectives are being undertaken in the USSR.  In
 East Germany, such cooperzf;ion has existed for
 some time.   Important features of the Chinese
 reforms are student labor in nearby factories,
 selection of students from among workers and
 technicians, the combination'' of theory and prac-.
 tice, and cooperation with factory labor and
 management to solve production problems.
 18.  The regular course of study is to last two
 to three years, broken into three stages.   In the
 first stage the student goes into the factory
 where teaching is combined with production of
 typical products.   In the second stage the student
 returns to school to improve his theoretical under-
 standing of what he has learned in the factory.
 Finally, he goes back to the factory where he does
 research and develops his skills in a;ialyzing and
 solving production problems.
 The Tsinghua Example
 19.  A recent Red Flag article revealed that
 Tsinghua University, perhaps China's most prestig-
 ious scientific and technical university, enrolled
 "nearly 600" students for experimental clas'sos in
 March 1969.*  This year the university plans to
 enroll a total of 2,500 students.  Citing how
 Tsinghua has carried out the basic reforms., the
 article goes on to criticise those who "put on an

 extremely 'left' appearance" nd distort the party's
 policy toward the intellectuals.  Those of the
 original .teaching staff who cannot be politically
 remoulded are "very small in number" and the in-
 tellectuals must be used while being re-educated.
 The article also concedes that the education of
 quality scientific-technical manpower may take more
 than two or three years; aside from the two-year
 or three-year "ordinary" system there are to be
 "advanced" classes.
 20.  Although an enrollment of 2,500 students Is
 still far below Tsinghua's 10,000 student capacity,
 the developments reported in the article demon-
 strate that progress has been made in restoring
 higher education.  The report also suggests the
 possibility that university education may reach a
 semblance of normality in the fall of 1971.
 Liberal Arts Colleges
 21.  Liberal arts colleges present a particular
 problem to the leadership, and the role these
 schools will play is not yet clear.  By the mid-
 1960s, many of China's new economic, cultural and
 educational, and administrative cadres were graduates
 of liberal arts colleges.  The schools are ap-
 parently to continue to provide administrators for
 the state apparatus.  But under the reforms, liberal
 arts students will no longer be exposed to general
 education in the humanities but will concentrate
 on more practical subjects, such as economics,
 accounting, and modern languages.   in addition, a
 system of participation in "social surveys" is
 envisioned whereby students will be exposed to the
 problems confronting factory and farm management
 in making administrative and economic decisions.
 Press discussions of the reforms suggest that new
 liberal arts curricula will not be firmed up until
 the = esults of- some of these surveys provide in-
 formation as to which subjects and skills are
 particularly needed.
 Primary and Middle School Reforms

 the constraints upon continuing education in
 communist China have particularly affected those

 members of the population betwe. , 7 and 18 years
 of age.  The re2 rms of primary a..   middle school
 education are aimed at this group, w.,,o constitute
 about one-fourth of the total pcppulation.  The key
 document for reforming the lower levels of education
 is the "Program for Primary and Middle School Edu-
 cation in the Rural Areas," published in May 1969.
 While the draft program is focused on reforms in
 rural areas, other statements by the regime have
 made it clear that parallel reforms are being under-
 taken in urban areas.   In general, the reforms are
 aimed at shifting the responsibilities for primary
 and middle school curriculum control, administra-
 tion, and financing from central and provincial
 governments to local units.  In the rural areas,
 this means that, generally, production brigades
 will be responsible for primary education while
 communes will be respoi?sible for middle schools.
 In the urban areas, such tanks will be undertaken
 by neighborhood associations and factories, re-
 spectively.  These are not hard-and-fast rules,
 however; whenever such arrangements are not feasible
 or convenient, other arrangements may be made.
 23.  Funds for rural education apparently must
 now come from commune or production brigade accumu-
 lation funds and/or a system of fees.  While school-
 owned farm plots cultivated by students and teachers
 could contribute to the support of the schools,
 this source of funds is not likely to be large.  In
 the urban areas the welfare funds of factory workers
 and a system of fees will probably be the sources
 of funds.
 24.  Several reasons have been given for the
 shift of formerly state-operated schools to local
 units.   Initially, the point was made that local
 financial support would free state funds for other
 tasks.   More recently, however, the benefits of
 local or neighborhood control have been stressed.
 It is now argued that with workers and peasants
 assuming greater responsibilities for operating
 the schools, worker-peasant children: will not be
 excluded as they were in the past.  While all
 children are eligible to attend primary schools,
 enrollment for middle schools is to be both by
 recommendation and selection, with priority given
 to children of workers, poor and lower middle

 peasants, revolutionary martyrs, and the
 military.  Reports of significantly increased
 enrollments in the countryside indicate that es-
 tablishing schools at the brigade and commune
 levels has apparently made it possible for more
 peasant children to attend school.  The actual im-
 pact may be less than currently reported, however,
 because dropout rates are very high.  Local finan-
 cial control also appears to be having additional
 effects on rural education.  Because they are pay-
 ing for the schools, peasants appear to be demand-
 ing that the schools produce accountants, technical
 personnel, and the like who will be of practical
 use to the brigade in production or administration.
 Curriculum Reforms in Primary and Middle Schools
 25.  The changes in curriculum in primary and
 middle schools have so far been extremely general
 in nature.  Five courses are to be taught in rural
 and urban primary schools:  politics and language,
 arithmetic, revolutionary art and literature,
 military training and physical culture, and pro-
 ductive labor.  The proposed middle school curricu-
 lum for rural schools is similar, with arithmetic
 replaced by a course in "basic knowledge for
 agriculture" -- including mathematics, physics,
 chemistry, and economic geography.  Another version
 includes mathematics, physics, and chemistry in
 addition to the course in agriculture.
 26.   Besides courses in Mao Tse-tung thought,
 revolutionary art and literature, and military
 training and physical culture, the urban middle
 school curriculum will contain courses in both
 "basic industry" and "basic agriculture."  The
 basic industry course will contain lectures on
 mathematics, physics, and chemistry "relating basic
 industrial knowledge and theory to practice" as
 well as to "Chairman Mao's directive on building
 industry."*  The basic agriculture course will tie
 in "Mao's directive on agricultural production"*
 *  There is no indication of the actual content of
 these directives.

 agro-techniques, there has been continuing discus-
 sion in the Chinese press as to how much class time
 is to be spent on these courses compared with that
 spent on political study.  Acknowledging the
 primacy of politics, the rural draft program notes
 that "it is appropriate for these courses (on
 general knowledge and culture) to account for
 about 60% of the periods for study in middle school
 and not less than 70% in primary school."  Although
 no similar caveats exist for urban schools it is
 clear that they too are to devote relatively more
 time to academic subjects.
 28.  The difficulty of convincing local educa-
 tion cadres that a curriculum containing academic
 subjects is not "revisionist" has been a persistent
 obstacle.  An incident reported by the South China
 Daily describes how local authorities handled this
 aspect of the educational revolution.   In one
 brigade the peasants had taken over the adminis-
 tration of a school and had immediately turned
 everyone's attention to the study of the thought
 of Mao Tse-tung.   Soon, however, some of the students
 and teachers complained that the curriculum was
 "monotonous."  They were taught only politics and
 nothing else, and morale and study habits began to
 suffer.  The commune revolutionary committee then
 expanded the curriculum to include courses in
 industrial techniques, agricultural techniques, and
 military affairs.  By holding up this action as
 exemplary, the Canton authorities apparently were
 attempting to give guidance to other communes en-
 countering similar difficulties.
 with lectures on economic geography, biology,
 meteorology, physics, chemistry, and mathematics
 all as applied to farm techniques.  Students will
 also be taught about fertilizers, insecticides,
 water conservation, and farm industry.
 27.  While these courses are intended to give
 a basic understanding of the sciences involved in
 Productive Labor
 29.  The draft reforms dealing with curriculum
 in rural areas call for formal courses in "productive
 labor" and the establishment by primary and middle
 schools of "bases for production."  The relationship

 between productive labor and bases of production
 is clarified in the draft, as follows:  "The
 primary way is for the students to participate in
 production in the people's communes, the produc-
 tion brigade and the production team, while their
 participation in labor arranged by the schools is
 supplementary.  .  .  ."  This implies that, on the
 one hand, productive labor classes will be related
 to basic agricultural sciences perhaps as applied
 to school experimental plots; on the other hand,
 ordinary farm tasks in their home teams or brigades
 will continue to occupy most of the students' time.
 30.  Establishing a system whereby students at
 urban schools participate in productive labor is
 more complex.   One solution to this problem is the
 establishment of branch schools in the rural areas.
 In Canton, reports indicate that as many as 50%
 of the students are being sent to rural branch
 schools where they spend six months.   Each week
 they "are required to do two days' general farm
 husbandry, two days' normal school study, and two
 days' practical farm work on the land."  Such
 branch schools also serve to facilitate the assign-
 ment of students to rural areas upon graduation.
 Teachers
 31.  The problem of staffing an expanded primary
 and secondary school system stems from both the
 general shortage of trained teachers and the fact
 that few teachers are familiar with the new
 curriculum.  The regime has insisted that the over-
 whelming majority of old teachers can be used
 while undergoing ideological "re-education."  The
 state has also increased the number of teachers
 in the countryside by ordering many urban teachers
 back to their home villages to teach in the now
 schools.  Other additions to the rural teaching force
 will come from educated young people and cadres
 sent down to the countryside as well as from local
 peasants who possess practical agricultural skills.
 Other categories of personnel will provide part-
 time teachers for the applied courses -- that is,
 a brigade accountant will be teaching accounting
 principles, and demobilized soldiers will teach
 military affairs and physical cultui,e.

 32.  The regime is aware that most of the new
 teachers are not qualified and arrangements
 have boon made to upgrade professional competence.
 Recently, the press has reported the establishment
 of training classes for middle school teachers.
 Though the length of the classes -- six months in
 one case and 40 days in another -- reflects a low
 level of training, these classes do indicate that
 the authorities are attempting to upgrade the
 quality of rural teaching.  At least one province
 (Kiangsu) is reportedly assigning most of its recent
 college graduates to teach in rural middle schools,
 with many actually being assigned to primary
 schools.
 Outlook and Conclusions
 33.   The proposed reforms are broad in scone
 and affect the entire educational system.  They
 have not been under way long enough, however, to
 determine precisely the details of their operation
 or to judge their effectiveness.  The permanence
 of the reforms seems very much dependent upon the
 cotit Hued influence of Mao Tse-tung -- who has
 been closely associated with educational reform
 since the mid-1960s.  His death could lead to a
 return to the methods and emphases of the early
 19609.   On the other hand, a decision on his part
 to pursue the reforms with more speed or in more
 radical form could lead to chaos in the educational
 system.   So long as a roasonablc balance between
 politics and practical education in curricula is
 maintained and there continua to be allowances for
 diversity in administration and orientation, the
 outlook is for a quantitative upgrading of Chinese
 education.  That is, while the overall quality
 of education in China almost certainly will decline
 under these reforms, a much larger proportion of
 the population may be able to acquire the rudiments
 of education.
 34.   As presently administered, the reforms are
 likely to have a mixed impact on the Chinese Com-
 munist economy.   In higher education, Chinese
 discussions of the simplification of curricula and
 the Ahortoning of courses imply that the leadership
 may be hazarding the flow of well-trained scientific
 and technical personnel required for their priority

 programs.  But this interpretation appears mis-
 leading.  It seems more likely that roformn in
 higher education will be selectively applied in
 scientific and technical areas.  'thus it appears
 that provin!onn are being made to ensure that a
 now system of higher education will continue to
 supply highly trained individuals who are capable
 of dealing with the complex problems of military
 and industrial science and technology.  The deep-
 rooted priority of China's development of modern
 weapone will outweigh the politicnl aims of the
 educational reforms when it comes to the concrete
 application of the reforms.
 35.  The reforms of primary and middle schools
 in general appear to be a systematic and realistic
 method of providing a modicum of education for
 larger numbers of hitherto uneducated youth.
 Furthermore, the emphasis on practical knowledge
 for industry and agriculture appears part of a
 schema aimed at solving the unemployment problem
 among China's youth.
 36.   The main economic significance of these
 reforms, however, lien in the role they are in-
 tended to play in the regime's effort to speed up
 rural economic development.  The success of the
 small plant construction program and of the attempt
 .o raise agricultural output through the mobiliza-
 tion of local resources is partly dependent on the
 provision of more highly skilled labor from thORo
 new schools.  By shifting the responsibilities
 for those progrr,ma from central to local authorities
 in the spirit of "self-reliance", the regime has
 sot into motion a local cost-benefit calculus
 whereby the returns from education, an well as from
 now small plant construction, will be weighed
 against the costs inv 'vad.   The regime clearly
 believes that the prL..pects of these programs for
 raising incomes and increasing job opportunities in
 the rural areas constitute sufficient incontjvoo
 for the local authorities to pursue rhea, aggrea=
