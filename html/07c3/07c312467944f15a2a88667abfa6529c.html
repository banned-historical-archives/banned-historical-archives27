 The Honorable George Murphy, Director
 Reflections on an Anniversary
 U.S. POWER: ITS SWIFT RISE AND SWIFTER FALL
 Remarks of Charles J. V. Murphy on the occasion of the
 50th reunion of the Harvard Class of 1926, at Cambridge,
 Mass., June 16, 1976.
 I have been asked to discuss American defense poli-
 cies--a subject about which I wrote for Fortune and Life
 and The Reader's Digest more years than I care to remem-
 ber. A serious subject--too serious, possibly, for what
 should be a festive occasion.
 The foremost question in that quarter today is a moot
 one: How does the United States rank militarily? Have we
 ceased or are we only ceasing to be Number One?
 The question is one that never concerned us on the 10th
 anniversary of this class. In 1936, the only military tasks
 that American forces had been put to after the first great
 war were guerrilla harrassments in Nicaragua, Santo Do-
 mingo and Haiti.
 And when the class came together again for the 20th,
 the nation had only just emerged victorious from the
 second great war in our lifetimes. The vast fleets,
 the air forces and the armies that we had known in one as-
 pect or another had been scattered to the four winds, in
 the mistaken belief they would not be needed again.
 And our 30th reunion, in 1956, found the nation
 between wars--between the grinding and unavailing or-
 deal in Korea in 1950-53 and the onset in 1960-61 of a suc-
 cession of untidy, vexing experiences in the Bay of Pigs,
 Laos, and Vietnam and what used to be called the Congo.
 The forces had meanwhile been rebuilt, the draft rein-
 stituted; but now our sons were being called to serve, and
 the Pentagon budget was taking some 9 percent of the
 GNP.
 By our 40th reunion, a scant ten years ago, war had be-
 come a serious and continuing business with Americans.
 In 1966, the Johnson Administration was moving tardily
 and uncertainly to save South Vietnam from an aggression
 supported by the entire communist bloc--China with the
 that war was being fought sensibly, and whether Ameri-
 cans should even be in Indochina at all, were beginning
 to divide the nation.
 Now, on our 50th, we meet in what President Ford as-
 sures us is a condition of peace. But we know that only
 yesterday we accepted a disastrous--and in the view of
 some, of whom I am one--a shameless and unnecessary
 defeat in Indochina. Last winter we stood aside in Angola
 and this summer we are standing aside in Lebanon, ner-
 vously averting our gaze from savage little wars of which
 the outcome will in the first instance affect the military
 balance in the Mediterranean and in the other in southern
 Africa.
 Governor Reagan warns us that we have fallen behind
 the Soviet Union, that the military balance has swung a-
 gainst us. And many good men say that he is right.
 President Ford assures us that the United States is still
 Number One and that the forces in place are adequate for
 any likely task.
 Among the Democrats there is a strange  silence.
 Jimmy Carter has said little on the subject of defense or
 foreign policy or the power balance.  He has suggested
 that a cut of some $7 billion in defense spending might be
 a good thing and he favors, in principle, a pullback of
 American troops from Korea and the NATO line.
 The other Democratic candidates, with the sole excep-
 tion of Senator Jackson, have simply ignored these prickly
 issues.
 So the rest of us are left with two questions: Have we
 indeed slipped down the power scale? And if we have,
 does it really matter?
 To know where we stand, it is useful to look back to the
 beginnings of the present situation and to examine afresh
 the circumstances that have governed national actions
 in what has certainly been a ride on the roller coaster of
 history.

 off years in the American experience with world power
 and influence in two historical respects:
 *On the side of military policy, they began with the Armistice in Korea
 early in 1953 and extended through a dramatic interval of invention that
 revolutionized military technologies and settled the balance to the side of
 the West.
 *And on the foreign policy side, these eight years were marked by the
 consolidation of the alliance first strung together by Det n Acheson under
 Truman. The most important of these alliances produced in 1950 the
 North Atlantic Treaty Organization--NATO. The other was the mutual
 defense treaty with Japan, which had been preceded by the commitment
 to defend South Korea and would soon be amplified ty the mutual de-
 fense treaty with the Republic of China on Taiwan.
 The practical consequence of these arrangements was to
 move the American defense line eastward to the Elbe in
 the heart of Europe and to the 37th Parallel in Korea. The
 containment policy enunciated by Truman and Acheson
 was thus crystalized under Eisenhower an I Dulles as a
 forward strategy sustained by interlocking coalitions on
 the far side of both oceans.
 Stalin was still alive, still in dictatorial charge of the
 Soviet Union when Eisenhower entered the Presidency.
 Truman had blocked his threat against Greece and Tur-
 key, but had chosen to hold aloof in Asia in 1945-49 when
 China was lost to communism. Then in 1950-52 he met
 and defeated the North Korean aggression banked by the
 Soviet Stalin and Mao Tse-tung. So the two systems were
 in collision across the width of the world when Eisenhower
 came to power some seven years after the end of the
 Second World War.
 A profound change in American strategy now occurred.
 In 1954-55, Eisenhower directed the Defense Department
 to proceed under the highest national pri )city with the
 development of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Sys-
 tem and the various other systems required for their sup-
 port and use. He did so to exploit the thermonuclear solu-
 tion which Truman had put in train several years earlier.
 The eventual result of these decisions was to bring into
 being by the end of the 1950s the awesome panoply of
 strategic range ballistic missiles that we know as the
 ICBMs--the Minuteman, Polaris, Titan, A':las and lately
 the Poseidon.
 As matters turned out, we were none too soon.  The
 Soviet Union arrived at the thermonuclear solution for the
 warhead almost as soon as we did, and were first with the
 strategic range rocket.
 But once embarked, the Pentagon and the scientific
 community--all but a small minority that blamed American
 bellicosity for goading the Russians into tie arms race--
 rapidly outdistanced the other side.  In 1960, Eisen-
 hower's last year, the United States had achieved un-
 equivocal ascendancy in all the decisive military technol-
 ogies--in numbers   otw4d I oll%K%s Obi  1  ~8
 land based; in jet aircraft; in radar; in lcgisttcs; in t e
 :newtp$iF1W61id0bfagiftance from our
 shores.
 We also developed the means, first with the U-2 air-
 craft and then the reconnaissance satellite, to look
 down from great heights into the Soviet Union and
 communist China and photograph what was going on be-
 hind their closed frontiers.
 Thus when the Cuban missile crisis burst upon him in
 October 1962, President Kennedy knew for sure that
 Khrushchev could command no more than 70 ICBMs of
 dubious accuracy deployed in the Soviet operational
 forces. And he had many times that number and more re-
 liable ones in place.
 In fact, at that point the United States was deploying the
 Minuteman at the rate of one a day., and launching a new
 Polaris submarine and adding a dozen or so B-52s to the
 Strategic Air Command every month.
 I cite these statistics not out of a vulgar and simple-
 minded obsession with numbers, but only to make the
 point that 15 short years ago the United States had clear
 ascendancy in the military technologies, especially the nu-
 clear. and our capacity to act reflected the power situation.
 Today we see Lebanon being torn apart. Only 18 years
 ago, in 1958, Eisenhower put a relative handful of Marines
 ashore--less than 5,000--in that country to save it from be-
 ing taken over by Syrians and Egyptians armed by the
 Soviet. Their mere appearance on the sunny beaches dis-
 pelled the threat. It evaporated in an afternoon.
 The same year, on the other side of the world, an unos-
 tentatious show of force by the Seventh Fleet in the For-
 mosa Straits, combined with the gift of a few sidewinder
 missiles to a highly competent Nationalist Air Force,
 stopped in its tracks a massive invasion of the Quemoy-
 Matsu islands by communist China that was to have been
 prelude to the reduction of Taiwan itself.
 Here was the high tide of American influence in a world
 in change.  The alliances were firm.  When in 1962
 Kennedy dispatched Dean Acheson to Paris to show Pres-
 ident de Gaulle the U-2 photographs of the Soviet mis-
 siles in Cuba and to explain why the United States was
 making ready to move against them, de Gaulle answered
 calmly that he assumed the United States would act de-
 cisively in defense of its interests.
 Things worked better for us then not alone because of
 Eisenhower's strength and resolution. They worked be-
 cause he was able to maneuver within alliances and
 means started by Truman and Acheson and supported by
 the nation.
 What has gone wrong? How did the power slip away?
 The turn in our fortunes started in the Kennedy years
 and it began with a return to isolationism wearing a new
 bfA-RDTFb 810}8h    064WM~{~ ~yiof deep and far
 back into American character. Wha `was new about the
 phenomenon in the ~~ltl~e~t~8
 foreign involvements and heavy military investments now
 came more forcefully from the intellectual community--
 from the political scientists and historians who were per-
 suaded that communism was a dynamic but mellowing
 force; the social scientists who wanted the capital given to
 defense invested instead in social programs and the physi-
 cal scientists who felt they had sinned in bringing nuclear
 weapons into the world.
 The fashionable view was that it was the American ob-
 session with nuclear supremacy which had inspired
 Soviet fears of the West and that the way to stop the arms
 race was for the United States to stop accumulating stra-
 tegic nuclear weapons.
 That reasoning gripped the Kennedy planners hard.
 It gave rise during Kennedy's second year to two crucial
 decisions largely constructed by Defense Secretary McNa-
 mara.
 Under the first decision the growth of the strategic
 forces was halted in 1964-65.  The idea was to let the
 Russians catch up and achieve parity with us, if they
 wished.
 Under the other, the U.S. strategic forces were moved
 into what was called a second-strike or strictly retaliatory
 posture.  They would be left durable enough to emerge
 from a first strike by an aggressor with remnants strong
 enough to inflict in riposte destruction far too severe for
 any rational enemy to accept. Hence the term mutual as-
 sured destruction--the think tank jargon for Robert Oppen-
 heimer's colorful figure of speech, Two Scorpions in a
 Bottle.
 The confident expectation that went with this shift in
 strategic emphasis was that once the Soviet Union moved
 up to nuclear parity--to stalemate, that is--the Kremlin's
 fear of American perfidy would be removed, tensions
 would relax, and the arms race would slow down.
 That is the reasoning that gave direction to American
 security policies in the middle 1960s--about the time of
 this class's 40th reunion.
 Now the consequences of the Kennedy reasoning are in
 view.
 What went wrong is that the Russians were not content
 with parity. They arrived at parity in purposeful momen-
 tum and went on accumulating more and heavier stra-
 tegic weapons.  They are proceeding on to full ascen-
 dancy.
 This is what the SALT negotiations are about.
 It supplies the principal issue between Reagan and
 Ford.
 It made for the breach between Schlesinger and Kis-
 singer--graduates together in a Harvard class, professors
 (5 e1 9P8l  le34%R0bc1   31dN2-7
 The mathematics of the balance as they relate to wea-
 pon systems involve factors beyond the experience of most
 of us. But there is one fairly simple way of judging how we
 have fared.
 It is to look at the map.
 The dominos have fallen. True, they did not all stand in
 a single line. But some are certainly down.
 South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are gone.
 Thailand has asked us to fold our tents there and depart.
 It is no secret that the Ford Administration would like to
 dissolve the commitment to Taiwan and move on to full
 diplomatic relations with communist China.
 Our intervention in the struggle for Angola was covert,
 feeble, brief and failing.
 Now Rhodesia and the Union of South Africa--their
 white populations, their minerals and other natural re-
 sources, and their strategic geography--lie quite naked
 and exposed to communist-supported aggression.  And
 who among us today is calling out as Winston Churchill
 did some 40 years ago, when another totalitarian imperial-
 ism was in the flood, "Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it nowt "
 It is hard to mark a place in the world where the Ameri-
 can government of the hour would make war in defense of
 principle.
 For that matter, it is hard to think of a principle af-
 fecting foreign policy that would unite Americans again
 for serious work abroad.
 How profound has been the change in our former vision
 of ourselves that few of us care to dwell on may be judged
 by contemplating the spectacular improvement in Fidel
 Castro's fortunes.
 Only 14 years ago, he stood by, seeming helpless and
 humiliated, while some 20,000 Soviet troops and technic-
 ians sailed home with the nuclear missiles which they had
 sneaked into Cuba in a gamble to redress the nuclear bal-
 ance.
 Last year a Cuban expeditionary force, almost as large
 as that one, armed by the Soviet bloc, crossed the South
 Atlantic and took up an imperial task halfway into Africa.
 There it provided, with some considerable dexterity and
 resolution, the principal means of an important conquest.
 What are older Americans to make of the present un-
 willingness to act and to risk? Can the United States safe-
 ly and in good conscience turn away and let the rest of the
 non-communist world go, too?
 My good friend the late Arthur Krock concluded sorrow-
 fully toward the end of an honest and wise career:  "the
 tenure of the United States as the world's foremost power
 may well be the briefest in the annals of history."

 in the failure of our po  ca le~-a'              lie course
 of the intellectuals on the liberal side of poli:ics to recog-
 nize a change in Soviet strategy that occurred after Stalin.
 Stalin at the end of the war found himself faced in Eur-
 ope by political parties sharing much th,: same prin-
 ciples of constitutional government and all inherently anti-
 communist.  His counter was to subjugate the eastern
 European nations overrun by the Red Army  In so doing
 he destroyed the basic Leninist principle for regulating the
 relationship of the national communist patties and pro-
 moting world revolution. It was Lenin's thesis that com-
 munist parties should agree on common objectives for
 the overthrow of capitalism but that each national party
 should be left free in a life of its own.
 Stalin cast that principle aside.  He toot. Soviet com-
 munism down the imperialist path. The Molotov-Ribben-
 trop pact which ushered in the second great war was a cyn-
 ical act. The German communist party was sacrificed for
 Soviet security.
 Soviet foreign policy from Malenkov through Khrush-
 diev to Brezhnev can be read in general terms as a patient
 and deliberate return to Leninism.
 It took six years for the communist parties--the Soviet
 party in debate with the leaders of other national parties--
 to hammer out the terms of a common world strategy and
 the conditions for their future cooperation one with the
 other. The objectives agreed upon are now in view:
 To mark the United States as the main enemy ant: to isolate it.
 To neutralize the American nuclear advantage b;' political action--
 whipping up world sentiment against the alleged American monopoly
 that had cpased to be a monopoly--and then wipe it out with superior
 means.
 To weaken and divide the American alliances throw,;h political action,
 espionage and deception.
 To separate the underdeveloped societies of the Third World from
 their European and American connections through wars of national liber-
 ation--wars designed not only to jeopardize the noncommunist nations
 access to crucial raw materials and commodities, but also to provide
 bases for extending political action to communist appa ?atus in the adjoin-
 ing societies.
 *To row toward these objectives on the muffled oa-s of co-existence,
 lately called detente, fostering the illusion of opennes! and reciprocity in
 tactical situations, but changing nothing, yielding nothing of strategical
 importance.
 How close the Soviet Union has come to bringing off the
 neo-Leninist strategy we are each of us free to decide for
 ourselves.
 You and I may differ on how independe:it of Moscow's
 aims the French and Italian communist Earties are pre-
 pared to be. But any one who paid attention to the recent
 prolonged proceedings of the 25th Party Congress in Mos-
 cow would have observed that the leaders cf the European
 nationalist communist parties were as one with the lead-
 ers of the eastern    pg~ ~~at224fj3

 alliances.
 Cuba under Castro is a splendid example of neo-Lenin-
 ism in early flowering.  Castro did not send his people
 deep into darkest Africa--troops, doctors, bridge builders,
 administrators--as puppets on Moscow's strings. On the
 contrary, he made his debut in that far-off place as a
 Marxist international statesman-dictator possessing
 collegial equality with the Moscow brethren. His technic-
 ians and soldiers dominated the battle there in league with
 the Soviet quartermasters.  To be sure, he failed with
 Allende in Chile in 1973 and earlier with Che Guevara in
 Bolivia. but today his agents operate with increasing ef-
 fectiveness in Puerto Rico, Panama, Jamaica and Vene-
 zuela. He is a young man as communist leaders go. Dar-
 ing, too. We shall no doubt be hearing more of him, but
 not, I pray, as Dr. Kissinger's next friendly host.
 I've refrained from any specific comment on Harvard's
 current celebrity, wishing to mind my manners on these
 hallowed grounds. And in any case, the debits and cred-
 its attaching to his diplomacy are coming into full view.
 In your middle years and mine, Dean Acheson and
 Foster Dulles conducted  foreign  policy for  strong-
 willed, intelligent and experienced men.  Neither courted
 the favor of journalists. Neither cavorted with Hollywood
 stars or indulged in the cult of personality. Neither was
 known to lie or deceive and even less to consort with those
 who would do the United States in.  They were much
 loser to each other in their faiths than their tempera-
 ments ever allowed them to admit.
 For me, past 70, the most grievous waste flowing from
 current policies has been decay of the alliances these two
 men strung, the sapping of the confidence of famous allies
 in American purpose.
 The United States is still far from being surpassed in
 the permanent  assets that determine the  relative
 strengths of nations over the long haul. Our unequalled
 resources of capital, our unmatched skill in growing food,
 our command of technology and invention leave us still
 with means in reserve to close the power margin at will.
 The trouble, as Dr. Schlesinger keeps telling us, is a
 question of will and of moral purpose.
 Do Americans have the will to return to world leader-
 ship? Do we have the stamina to stay the course? Do we
 have good purposes to serve in the world?
 I want to believe so. What a pleasant thing it would be
 for those of us still around to return to Cambridge for our
 60th reunion, to find that the Charles River Basin and Har-
 vard itself were again the fertile seedbed of the principles
