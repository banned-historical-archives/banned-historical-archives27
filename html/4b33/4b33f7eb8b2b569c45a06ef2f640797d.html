 MAO TSE-TUNG AND HISTORICAL MATERIALISM
 IV.  THE "TRANSITION TO SOCIALISM"
 This is a working paper, the fourth of a series on Mao
 Tse-tung as a Marxist philosopher.  Another paper, concerned
 with Mao's treatment of the concept of "contradictions,"
 originally scheduled to precede this paper, will soon follow.
 This paper, like the first three in this series, was
 written by Arthur Cohen of the China Division of the Sino-
 ,Soviet Bloc Area.  Useful comments on the paper have been
 offered in particular by John Heidemann of China Division
 and by Philip Jones of the Far East Branch of Analysis
 Division of ORR.  The Sino-Soviet Studies Group would,wel-
 come additional comment, directed to Mr. Cohen
 SUMMARY
 Marx and Lenin originated the dogma that the elimination
 of the bourgeoisie as a class and the expropriation of their
 holdings must be carried out during the "socialist" stage of
 revolution.  Lenin-was willing to make use of certain Russian
 capitalists until the Soviet regime was less unstable, but,
 as it turned out, he expropriated capitalist property violently,
 and in Stalin's Russia the "transition to socialism" was car-
 ried out following the total destruction of the capitalists:.:
 as a class.
 The Chinese Communists claim, in contrast, that Mao Tse-
 tung has discovered a peaceful method of handling capitalists.
 The "national" capitalists--i.e       se who remained after the
 "bureaucratic" capitalists had been "smashed" in 1949--are said
 .to be a part of the advancing "transition to socialism" in
 .China, and it is asserted that such a transition is unprecedented.
 This claim is in part valid.
 .  Whereas Eastern European leaders after 1948, following
 Soviet practices, felt obliged to reject the "peaceful trans-
 formation" of capitalists, Mao was able to work out the details
 and put into practice the Marx-Engels-Lenin theory of  '._uy ng
 out" the capitalists during a period of gradual transformation.
 Although the relatively peaceful socialist transformation of
 Chinese agriculture in 1955 was a more impressive accomplish-
 ment, Chinese Communist claims for Mao center on the transforma-
 tion of small capitalist enterprises.
 What Mao did, in stages, was to transform capitalist in-
 dustry and commerce into mixed public-private industry and
 commerce, to transform capitalists into shareholders, and to
 transfer administration of private enterprises into party and
 government hands.
 The'st.ages of Mao's policy toward capitalist enterprise
 were reflected in Chinese pronouncements on the progress from
 "new democracy" to the "transition to socialism."  During the
 period of a moderate line toward the economic activities of
 small capitalists (1949-52), China was still in the stage of
 "new democracy."  In 1953, after tougher policies had been
 introduced, the "transition to socialism" was said to be at.
 hand.   Indeed, in 1953; it was held that "new democracy" had
 ended and the "socialist" stage begun back in 1949.  Mao appar-
 ently took this line in order not to be regarded as less advanced
 than the regimes in Eastern Europe.
 Mao's claim that the "socialist" stage was at hand appar-
 ently took the Soviets by surprise.  As of 1953, Moscow was
 unwilling to grant that the Chinese had begun the "transition
 to socialism" even in 1953.  During 1954, Moscow gradually and
 grudgingly acknowledged that the Chinese were "building social-
 ism."  At the same time, Soviet theorists insisted that this
 step must entail the change from "democratic dictatorship" to
 "dictatorship of the proletariat"--a declaration Peiping was
 unwilling to make until. 1956.
 The Chinese Communists claim not only that Mao discovered
 a new form and method for the "transition to socialism" by
 peacefully transforming (gradually taking over) capitalist enter-
 prises, but that the capitalists themselves are being trans-
 formed.  This transformation is effected by intensive indoctri-
 nation, which, differing somewhat from Soviet, practices, seeks
 to effect permanent changes, makes extensive use of group
 pressures, is applied to non-party as well as party people,
 and is a very prolonged process.  The small capitalists are
 generally not sent to prison or camps for this transformation;
 they keep working in their businesses.
 Even Khrushchev, no admirer of Chinese practices, has paid
 a backhanded compliment to Mao's innovations in dealing with
 the capitalists.   So has Mikoyan.   Soviet spokesmen have been
 careful, however, to restrict the applicability of these prac-
 tices to China.
 One interesting sidelight on the development of Mao's policy
 toward capitalists is that Chou En-lai claims some of the credit
 for it.   It is most unusual for anyone but Mao to be "creative."
 Mao's doctrines on the "transition to socialism," in par-
 ticular on the means of "buying out" and "transforming" capital-
 ists, are communicated by the Chinese to other Communists with
 a missionary zeal.  The doctrines are said to be of "universal
 significance"--for Communists in underdeveloped areas and even
 in the West.  This kind of proselytizing has angered the Soviet
 leaders, who are now attempting to take the wind from Mao's
 sails by insisting that Marx and Lenin had been the first to
 discuss the "buying out" policy and by incorporating' the policy
 into the Draft Program of the 22nd Soviet party congress.  The
 Draft Program does not mention Mao in this connection.

 MAO TSE-TUNG AND HISTORICAL MATERIALISM
 IV.  THE "TRANSITION TO SOCIALISM"
 In Chapter V. of State and Revolution (August 1917), Lenin
 makes a distinction between "socialist" society and Communist.
 society in discussing the "transition from capitalism to Com-
 munism."  Citing Marx's Critique of the Gotha Program (1875),
 Lenin says that the "political transition period" of which
 Marx spoke "must undoubtedly be a special stage or epoch" of
 transition, and this stage, he says, has been designated by
 Marx as the "'first" phase of Communist society.   It is, he
 continues, "generally called socialism."
 "Peaceful Transformation" of Capitalist Enterprises
 The view that the elimination of the bourgeoisie as a class
 and the expropriation of their holdings must be carried out
 during the first, transitional ("socialist") stage became for
 Communists a dogma.  Marx, Engels and Lenin, however, saw the
 need for more than one method of expropriating the bourgeoisie
 and thereby eliminating it as a class.  Faced with economic
 problems in the Soviet state, Lenin was willing to make use of
 certain capitalists until the Soviet regime was able to estab-
 lish a degree of economic stability.  Lenin later claimed that
 he was compelled to resort to direct, violent methods of ex-
 propriating all capitalist property, as the capitalists had
 resisted his effort to "gradually and peacefully" transfer
 their holdings to the Soviet government.
 There really never had been for Stalin a "soft" policy,
 toward the capitalists, and his writings concerning them are
 not marked by any gentle phrases.  The bourgeoisie must be
 "smashed," capitalists, merchants, kulaks, and profiteers must
 be "eliminated," and the exploiting class must be "liquidated"
 during the "transition to socialism."  Describing in 1925 the
 New Economic Policy (NEP), Stalin says that it would be an "in-
 evitable phase of the socialist revolution in all countries."
 Adhering to Lenin's view, Stalin goes on to concede that capital-
 ists will be tolerated, but that is all he concedes:
 NEP is a special policy of the proletarian state,
 counting on the toleration of capitalist elements,
 the commanding heights being in the hands of the pro-
 letarian state, counting on the growth of the role of
 the socialist elements to the detriment of the capital-
 ist elements, counting on the victory of socialist ele-
 ments over capitalist elements, counting on the aboli-
 tion of classes and the laying of the foundation of a
 socialist economy.   (1)
 In the-History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (B)
 of 1938, his writers strongly condemn as  a  arini a opposition
 the theory of the "peaceful growing of the bourgeoisie into
 socialism.... and the fostering and encircling of the bourgeoisie,
 not destroying it."   (2)  Thus the "transition to socialism"
 in the USSR was carried out following the liquidation of the
 capitalists and the total destruction of them as a class.
 The Chinese Communists claim that Mao has discovered a
 peaceful method for handling capitalists, that the "transition
 to social si m" in China is advancing with the continued exist-
 ence of the "national" capitalists, and that such a transition
 is unprecedented.  The claim in large part is valid.
 The Chinese are, of course, referring to the only capital-
 ists who were permitted to continue in their businesses after
 1949, viz. the enterpreneurs engaged in the production and
 sale of consumer goods.  All other capitalists had been char-
 acterized as "bureaucratic-capitalists" and had been expropriated
 and "smashed" in 1949.   They no longer exist as a stratum.
 The remaining small entrepreneurs are designated the "middle"
 or "national" bourgeoisie and it is their enterprises which
 gradually have been transformed.
 Because the capitalists (national bourgeoisie) in'China
 are (a) weak,  (b) obedient to the CCP and its program, and (c)
 willing to be transformed, the "transition to. socialism" can
 be a "peaceful" process.   Chinese writers contrast this with the
 history of the transition in the USSR, where the capitalists
 were "smashed" because they were (a) strong,  (b) antagonistic
 to the CPSU, and (c) unwilling to change their ways.
 The contrast between the Soviet and Chinese situations
 was made in 1956 by theorists Wu Chuan-che among others:
 Unlike the violent expropriation of the means of
 production of the bourgeoisie which was the form
 of struggle adopted in the USSR in the transition
 period, in China we have adopted peaceful transforma-
 tion of the capitalists' enterprises during transi-
 tion....
 Regarding the elimination of classes, it can be car-
 ried out only by class struggle, as there is no other
 road.  But the form of struggle adopted--armed or
 peaceful, bloody or bloodless struggle--must be
 changed according to the objective conditions.   (3)
 This "peaceful transformation" of the capitalists' enter-
 prises into state-run enterprises has been made possible, Wu
 says in an earlier article (1955), because Mao had mastered
 the law of "bloodless change."  Wu says that "Because of his
 profound knowledge of this law, Chairman Mao has adhered to
 the correct line for the last 30 years of revolutionary strug-
 gle, opposing both tailism and adventurism, and thus has led
 the revolution to a victorious conclusion.  He has created
 the basic conditions for a transition to socialism by peace-
 ful means."   (4)
 We have suggested above that there is a warrant in Lenin's
 works for a transition by peaceful means.  During the period
 of the NEP, Lenin spoke of the Soviet government's desire for
 a gradual transition.   In his report delivered at the 7th Moscow
 Gubernia Party Conference, 29 October 1921, Lenin stated that
 the Soviet government in 1917 and 19.8 "attempted to introduce
 its economic policy...which was originally calculated to bring
 about a number of gradual changes, to bring about a more cau-
 tious transition to the new system."   (5)   In discussing the
 policy of spring 1921, Lenin again referred to gradual, in
 direct methods:   "The political situation in the spring of
 1921 revealed to us that retreat to the position of state
 capitalism, the substitution of 'siege' tactics for 'direct.
 assault' tactics was inevitable on a number of economic gues
 tions."   (6)  But when NEP was brought to an end, so was the
 existence of the "new bourgeoisie," i.e. the nepmen as a class.
 The idea of "peaceful transformation" of capitalists' en-
 terprises in China, therefore, may well have been a concept
 which Mao took over from Marx, Engels and Lenin.   In his
 Peasant Question in France and Germany of,1894;  Engels had
 stated triat "once our party has se ze-- state power, it should
 immediately expropriate the big landowners . and. the factory
 owners.  Whether this expropriation requires the use of buying
 out, is a matter primarily to be determined not by us, but by
 the conditions prevailing when we attain political power, and
 is even more determined by the actions of the big landowners
 themselves.  We absolutely do not state that ransom is imper-
 missible under all conditions.   Marx told me (and how many.'
 times!) that in his opinion we would get off cheapest if we
 could buy out the whole lot of them."   (7)  Thus Engels had
 sanctioned a relatively moderate form of expropriation, e.g.
 buying out rather-than violent requisition.. Like Marx, he
 was less revolutionary in his late years.
 Lenin goes beyond Engels' position and speaks of using
 the skills of capitalists in the service of the new state.
 Thus in Unavoidable  Catastrophe and Boundless Promises (May
 1917), Lenin says:
 As to the individual capitalists, or even the majority
 of capitalists, not only does the proletariat not
 intend to "strip" them (as Shulgin has been "scaring"
 himself and his ilk), not only does it not intend to
 deprive them of "everything," but, on the contrary,
 it intends to place them at useful, honorable tasks,
 subject to the control of the workers themselves.   (8)
 One year later,  in his "Left-Wing" Childishness and Petty Bour-
 geois Mentality (May 1918), he speaks of "buying off" the
 capi-
 talists and of a.peace u  transition to "socialism:"                      "Marx
 was profoundly right when he taught the workers the importance
 of preserving the organization of large-scale production pre-
 cisely for the purpose of facilitating the transition to soci-
 alism and that (as an exception; and England was then an excep-
 tion) the idea was conceivable of paying the capitalists well,
 of buying them off,  if the circumstances were suc  asp com-
 pel the capitalists to submit peacefully and to come over to
 socialism in a cultured and organized fashion, provided they
 were bought off."  "Well, and what about Soviet Russia?.
 Is it not clear that certain conditions  prevail which cor
 .respond to those which might have existed in England half a
 century ago had a peaceful transition to socialism begun then.?"
 /Lenin's emphasis?  (9)              .
 State capitalism was common to both NEP-Russia and the
 transitional economy of Communist China. Lenin appears to
 have combined Engels' idea of "buying off" withrthe concept
 of.state capitalism.   In his  The Tax in Kind of April 1921,
 Lenin says:
 We can and ought to combine the method of ruthless
 suppression of the uncultured capitalists, who re-
 fuse to have anything to do with "state capitalism"
 or to consider any form of compromise, and who con-
 tinue by means of profiteering, by bribing the poor
 peasantry, etc., to hinder the application of. the
 measures taken by the Soviets, with the method of.
 compromise, or "state capitalism," or buying of f the
 cultured capitalists who agree to practice and who
 are useful to the proletariat as clever:.- and experi-
 enced organizers of very large enterprises, which
 supply commodities to tens of millions of people..
 Benin's emphasis?  (10)
 The NEP, defined succinctly by Lenin as "capitalism plus
 socialism" was shortlived.  Within several yea-r-s-iff was ended
 and remaining capitalists were expropriated outright..   In China,
 however, the Communists are buying off the "national" capital-
 ists by compensating them with fixed interest and combining
 this with the gradual takeover ("socialist transformation")
 of their enterprises.
 Some of the Chinese methods of "peaceful" takeover of
 capitalist enterprises may have been taken over from early NEP
 experiences and from the, considerable experience of the Eastern
 European satellite regimes from mid-1945 to 1948, but some.
 methods are probably unique--e.g. the nationwide campaigns,of
 "struggle" against the capital ists which intimidated them ('gave
 them a lesson in political power;" as the Chinese Communists
 put it) but did not entirely liquidate the private capitalist
 sector of the economy.  Moreover, the precise details on how
 to "buy out" and on the matter of how to use the "national"
 capitalists in the production effort while permitting them no
 independent economic activity are probably uniquely Chinese
 Communist details.  For a brief peripd in 1960, the East Ger-
 mans were prepared to learn something from the.Chinese on the
 matter of using capitalists.  On 13 May 1960, two members of
 the Berlin Bezirk organization of the National Democratic Party
 discussed with Chinese embassy officials "a number of questions
 concerning the incorporation of the members of the middle class
 /national bourgeoisie7 in the building of socialism in the Ger-
 man Democratic Republic and democratic Berlin."   (11)  But the
 East. Germans retreated from this teacher-pupil., relationship
 with the Chinese, almost certainly as a result of Soviet. op-
 position to it.
 Whereas the nepmen--the small capitalists--were "smashed,"
 together with the kulaks in the countryside,  in the 1920s fol-
 lowing the NEP period and whereas Eastern European satellite
 leaders felt compelled to reject "peaceful transformation" of
 capitalists in 1948, Mao was able to move more slowly.  He in-
 sisted that small capitalist holdings would be taken over. one
 step at a time by "peaceful" means and that "national" capital-
 ists would continue to exist as capitalists, working in their
 own firms under CCPsupervision.
 Marx, Engels, and Lenin had set forth a theory of "buying
 out" the capitalists, of purchasing their means of production.
 Mao put the theory into practice, working out the policy of
 gradual "socialist transformation" of the capitalists enter-
 prises.  This is his contribution to the doctrine of expropria-
 tion`of the bourgeoisie.
 Actually, the "socialist" transformation of agriculture"
 in'1955 was a more noteworthy accomplishment of Mao's than
 the transformation of small capitalist enterprises.  The 1955
 collectivization of hundreds of millions of peasants without
 large-scale bloodshed stands in stark contrast with Stalin's
 brutal and chaotic collectivization in the late 1920s.  The
 methods employed by Mao in 1955 in collectivizing the Chinese
 .peasants could well serve as the basis for a claim that the
 Chinese leader had made an original contribution to Communist
 doctrine on rural collectivization.  But while the Chinese
 theorists praise the achievement they'make no such claim.
 Their attention has been and is centered on the contribution
 Mao, made in transforming small capitalist enterprises.
 Precisely what were the details of the policy worked out
 by Mao for gradual, trans-format ion?
 In the first years following the establishment of the PRC
 in 1949, transformation of the private-capitalist enterprises
 took the following form:   a number of the most simple forms
 of'state capitalism were applied, such as private enterprises
 working on government-orders, the sale of their products to
 the state,-trading on government commission, etc.  At the same
 time, the administration of the enterprises was completely in
 the hands of the capitalists.
 Beginning in 1952-53, that is, after the end of the recon-
 struction period, the CCP began to create mixed, public-private
 enterprises, administered jointly by representatives(-Of the
 government and private capitalists, but with the government
 having the deciding role.   Actually, there was nothing very
 "peaceful" about the process.  The "Five-Anti" movement of
 January to June 1952 was used by Mao to take a big step for-
 ward in the direction of placing private business more completely
 under CCP control; this required, in Mao's view, mobilization
 of the party and the masses for a class war against the bour-
 geoisie.  Even the smallest merchants were forced to exhaust
 their savings and liquidate all concealed assets under condi-
 tions of persecution and terror.  There were many suicides,
 and those who escaped with their lives saved nothing else ex-
 cept a small share in their own businesses.  This latter con-
 sideration meant that they continued to exist: as capitalists,
 and for this reason the Communists insist that the buying out
 is a "peaceful" process.
 From 1952-53 until 1955, the capitalists were bought out
 by means of a system of distributing profits according to the
 principle of "four horses per measure of oats."  That is, the
 capitalists received 25% of the profits of the enterprises.
 But in 1955, the process of transforming capitalist enterprises
 into state-capitalist enterprises was intensified.  The CCP
 began to create specialized companies in entire branches of
 industry and commerce; to which the individual enterprises
 were subordinate.  The administration of the small enterprises
 went entirely into the hands of the party.  The new (1955)
 situation is described by the Chinese as follows:
 After this change-over (to joint state-private opera-
 tion by whole trades) was realized, the state made the
 following important provisions which are still current..
 A fixed rate of interest was paid by the state for the
 total investment of the capitalists in the joint state-
 private enterprises.   Irrespective of locality and
 trade, the interest was fixed at a rate of 5 percent
 per annum.   In the meantime, the state declared that
 this system would not be changed for seven years
 starting from 1956.  This. was the continuation of the
 policy of "buying off" the capitalists after the change-
 over by whole trades, only the form of payment was
 changed.  The fixed rate of interest took the place
 of the distribution of profit according to definite

 FOR. OF                                                 AL USE ONLY
 proportions.   In all the joint state-private enterprises,
 the total investment of the capitalists amounted to
 about 2,'418 million yuan, of which 1,693 million yuan
 were in industry; 586 million yuan in commercial and
 catering trades; 102 million yuan in communications
 and transport; and 36 million yuan in personal services.
 Under the fixed interest system, the annual outlay
 from the state treasury was over 120 million yuan.
 There were 1,140,000 recipients in all."   (12)
 As a result of the complete transformation of small capital-
 ist enterprises into state-capitalist enterprises in 1956, and
 the introduction of a new:"form of "buying out"--in the form
 of a guaranteed percentage of the capital invested in the mixed
 enterprises--all private ownership of the means of production
 was converted into joint enterprises.
 Thus Mao showed considerable originality in applying Marx's,
 Engels', and Lenin's theory of "buying out" --by.transQfining
 capitalist industry and commerce into mixed, public-private
 industry and commerce, transforming capitalists into shareholders,
 and transferring the administration of private enterprises into
 party and government hands.
 From New Democracy to the "Transition to'Socialism"
 Before the Chinese Communists seized national power in
 1949, Mao had promised that the,!capitalist sector of the economy
 would be permitted to develop.  As early as 1934, Mao stated
 in Our Economic Policy that "so long as private enterprises
 do not transgress the legal limits set by our government, we
 shall not,only refrain from prohibiting them, but shall pro-
 mote and encourage them."   (13)   In The Chinese Revolution and
 the CCP (December 1939), Mao described an important aspect oir-
 New Democracy:   "Economically,  it means nationalization of all
 brig capital and big enterprises of the imperialists, collabora-
 tors, and reactionaries, distribution of the land of the land-
 lords among the peasants, and at the same time the general pre-
 servation of private capitalist enterprises without the elimina-
 tion of the rich-peasant economy."  /emphasis supplied? -(14)
 In his report to the 7th Congress of the CCP of April-1945,
 Mao stated that "The task of the New Democracy we advocate...
 is to assure the Chinese people the possibility of...freely
 developing a private capitalist economy which, however, must
 not 'hold in its grasp the livelihood of the people."'
 Following the. establishment of the Chinese Communist regime
 in 1949, Mao reaffirmed his New Democracy view that a private
 capitalist sector of the national economy should exist along-
 side a state-owned "socialist" sector.   In his report to the
 party's central committee of 5 June 1950, Mao made it policy
 that national planning must take into account the interests
 of "all sections" of the economy and improve relations between
 state-run and private capitalist enterprises.  Ten days later,
 politburo member Chen Yun stated that "The state allows private
 capital to conduct commercial activities in order to develop
 the circulation of commodities....  The People's Government
 protects the interests of all capitalists who benefit the
 nation's welfare and the people's livelihood."
 Thus in 1950, Mao and his lieutenants in the party continued
 to stress.a moderate line toward the economic activities of
 small capitalists in China.  The "transition to socialism" was
 not mentioned as an immediate goal.  This was still the period
 of New Democracy which had:,been discussed by Mao ever since
 the 1930s.  That is, it was still the period which was to pre-
 cede the start of China's "transition to socialism."  "New
 Democracy," not "socialism," was the term used and most fully
 discussed by Chinese Communist writers throughout the period
 from 1940 to 1953.
 But in mid-1953, following Stalin's death and as hostilities
 in Korea were subsiding, the Chinese leaders changed the line.
 In July 1953, the Chinese began to claim that the "transition
 to socialism" was at hand in China.
 On 10 July 1953, the transition had been made the immediate
 task in a decision of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
 (ACFTU) at a closed session of the union's executive committee.
 This was indicated by the following statement which appeared
 in an August issue of the official newspaper of the CCP:
 The task of attaining national industrialization
 and the gradual transition to socialism is now.placed
 before the people of the entire nation.   (15)
 By October, the phrase "transition to socialism" began to appear
 with increasing_frequency.in Chinese published materials and
 on 27 October a full-blown "general line" for the transition
 was discussed by Li Wei-han, director of the CCP central com-
 mittee's United Front Work Department.  Like Stalin, Mao laid
 down a general line for building "socialism."
 Li Wei-han presented the official formulation of the gen-
 eral line for the "transition to socialism" in the form of a
 directive from Mao Tse-tung.  He quoted Mao's directive in
 full:
 With regard to the general line of the state in
 the transition, Chairman Mao has given the follow-
 ing directive:   "From the founding of the People's
 Republic of China /PRC7 to the basic conclusion of
 socialist reform is the period of transition.  Dur-
 ing this stage of transition, the general line and
 the general task of the state is the gradual realiza-
 tion, over a relatively long period of time, of
 the socialist industrialization of the state, and
 the gradual realization of the socialist trans-
 formation by the. state of agriculture, handicrafts,
 and private industry and commerce.  This general
 line is the lighthouse that illuminates our various
 tasks.  Divorced from this general line, we shall
 commit rightist or leftist mistakes in.our various
 tasks."   (16)
 Li did not reveal the occasion on which this directive was is-
 sued, but in view of the circumstance that the gradual "transi-
 tion to socialism" was laid down as an immediate mission at
 the 10 July session of the AC rU's executive. committee, referred
 to above, it is likely that the formulation of the general line
 was under active consideration by Mao in summer 1953.
 Why was the line on transition gradually introduced in the
 period from July to October and raised to a nationwide propa-
 ganda campaign only in October?  A possible answer is that Mao
 went slow at first.   By going slow at first, the Chinese leader
 and administrators in the party were able to "grope their way"
 toward the best methods of carrying out the politburo decision
 on transition and, when these methods were finally determindd
 through trial-and-error, the nation-wide campaign to*implement
 the new policy was launched.
 According to Mao's directive revealed by Li in October
 1953, private industry and commerce would now be subjected to
 "socialist transformation by the state."  This statement and
 the announcement that the "New Democracy" stage had ended and
 the "socialist" stage simultaneously begun in October 1949
 (founding of the PRC), apparently came as a surprise to many
 people in China.
 Starting in late October 1953, as the national campaign
 for the transition grew in intensity, the notion of the New
 Democracy economy as one in which the private sector of the
 economy is allowed to "flourish" unimpeded by central controls
 was. brought under attack and gave way to the line that the
 private sector gradually was to be crowded out and eventually
 taken over by the state.
 Indicative of this change in line, theorist Yao Peng-chang,
 in criticizing the heretofore authoritative book in which Meng
 Hsien-chang had recorded the concept of an expanding private
 sector, found it a matterct concern that "this book was able
 to circulate for threeyears without having been censured." (17)
 Meng was berated for "not criticizing private capitalism" which
 inevitably would be displaced from the economy.   Capitalism
 would not be permitted to develop at will, Yao continued, and
 the leniency toward private business would be qualified.  Yao
 condemned Meng'sinterpretation of New Democracy in the fol-
 lowing manner:
 The author's information concerning the leading role
 of the state-run economy is incorrect.  He says that
 "State-run enterprises in their so-called leading
 role merely guide, but do not squeeze out; merely
 are of relative not preponderant  mposrtance; merely
 pose as hosts, not as monopolists; merely function
 in coordinating, not in opposing; and merely have the
 power to help, not to restrain."   (A Course on New
 Democracy Economy, p.3      hese phrases reveal    e
 phasis/  (18)
 au  ors ignorance of the corrupt, backward face of
 private capitalist economy....   From the viewpoint
 of the leading role of the state-run economy, for it
 merely to help is incorrect and to say that it merely
 shall coordinate is even more erroneous-.   /Yao's,em-
 The attack suggested that Mao's general line formulation was
 significantly more radical, more restrictive of private capi-
 talism than his earlier concept of New Democracy in which
 "socialist" and capitalist economic sectors were to grow side
 by side.  Private enterprise becomes more and more a.declining,
 temporary supplement to the swelling state economic sector.
 Mao's statements made ever since 1934 that the small pri-
 vate sector would be protected and. permitted to develop sud-
 denly were revealed to be part-of a certain kind of promise,
 viz. a dialectical promise.  The early promise of a freely
 developing small-capitalist economy had been transformed:  al-
 though the private sector would be  'used," it was now to be
 "restricted and reformed."
 That this change was unexpected--that is, that New Demo-
 cracy was to be replaced by the "transition to socialism"--is
 also attested to by ChU Kuang-chien, the seemingly bewildered
 professor of the Western Language Department, Peking University,
 when he wrote the following:
 Upon studying the general line,  I heard that the
 period of transition to socialism actually had begun
 when the PRC was founded.   I also heard that the
 general line was not suddenly espoused.  /7.
 It was mentioned by Chairman Mao in On New Democracy
 and On the People's Democratic Dictatorship and
 clearly was stipulated in the Common Program.   I
 read these documents again and found that the
 general line governing the transition from the New
 Democracy stage to socialism clearly had been out-
 lined.   I had read these essays many times in the
 past, but now I know that I had failed to under=
 stand them.   I did not grasp the essence of New
 Democracy and failed to appreciate that it was a
 period of transition to socialism.   (19)
 Reading Professor Chu's confession in a manner that does justice
 to his intelligence and literary ability, one concludes that
 he was only seemingly, bewildered and was in fact writing between
 the lines.  That is, Professor Chu apparently was informing
 careful readers that he "failed to appreciate" that the New
 Democracy was a period of "transition to socialism" precisely
 because the documents he cites are ambiguous on the matter.
 12 -
 He apparently was also telling his readers that in the 1953
 directive, Mao for the first time, and in one stroke, had pushed
 back to October          e s arting date for the transition and
 the completion date for New Democracy.  Professor Chu concluded:
 "I have come to understand that studying is no easy matter.
 One might have read an essay a number of times and thought its
 import had been comprehended.  Actually, however, one had not
 grasped it at all."
 The authoritative understanding of the New.Democracy so-
 ciety prior to the general line campaign. of October 1953 was
 that it consisted of two stages, the first of which prepared
 for "socialism," and the second, which made the direct transi-
 tion to "socialism."  This pre-October 1953 concept was attack-
 ed by Yao Peng-chang, who would merge these stages and blur
 them.  Yao's assertion that the "New Democracy society is the
 transitional society" on the road to "socialism"--a poif of
 particular emphasis in general line propaganda--exemplified
 the new element in the CCP claim of Chinese political and eco-
 nomic progress.   It was a claim to the prestige which accrues
 to a Communist-led state when it proclaims that "building
 socialism" is the new task at hand.
 Mao apparently was reluctant to accept a position for China
 which placed it in a doctrinally inferior status.  That is,
 according to Soviet theorists, the "democratic," or "New Demo-
 cracy," stage in Eastern Europe had been completed in late 1947,
 after which time all Eastern European Communist regimes were
 acknowledged to be in the second stage, the-:more advanced stage
 of "transition to socialism."  China, however, was still held
 to be in the -.first stage, and this clearly was intended to im-
 ply that the Chinese Communist regime was less advanced and
 revolutionary than the regimes of Eastern Europe.  Mao appar-
 ently decided, therefore, to move at least abreast of these
 regimes by proclaiming that the transition eras in.progress and
 had been ever since October 1949.
 Mao did not begin the transitional campaign until after
 (a) the national economy had been "rehabilitated" and the first .
 five year plan was being prepared (December 1952),  (b) Stalin
 died (March 1953), and (c) the Korean hostilities had ended
 (July 1953).   The timing of the campaign was probably influenced
 by all three factors.
 Soviet Re1uctanee ;to:.Accept Chin. as: T'Buihding Socialism':.'
 As of October 1953, when the Chinese made clear, through
 the propaganda on their general line, that they had entered
 upon the "building of socialism," two key statements constituted
 the Soviet line on the nature and general tasks of the Chinese
 state and the developmental stages of a "people's democracy."
 These were A. Sobolev's October 1951 Bol'shevik article and
 Ye. Zhukov's November 1951 report to a Soviet conference. of
 orientalists.
 Sobolev stated that the first stage of people's democracy
 was the stage of an agrarian, anti-feudal, anti-imperialist
 revolution.  He then asserted:
 The second stage is the stage of the establish-
 ment of the dictatorship of the working class in
 the form of people's democracy and the building
 of socialism....
 As a result of basic political and social-economic
 transformations, people's democracy in the countries
 of central and southeast Europe has entered into the
 second stage of its-development--the stage of the
 dictatorship of the proletariat and the building of
 socialism....
 The PRC is a state of people's democracy in the first
 stage of its development.  People's democracy in
 China does not yet fulfill the functions of a dic-
 tatorship of the proletariat.   In the present stage
 socialist . tasks, as immediate tasks, are not being
 proposed and are-not being resolved.  This is a matter
 for the future.   Mao Tse-tung has pointed out that
 only after a flourishing national economy and culture
 have been established, only after the necessary condi-
 tions have been establishjed, will China, in conformity
 with the will of its people, undertake to solve the
 tasks of building socialism.   (20)
 That China was in the first stage, and that this fact marked
 it and other Asian Communist regimes as less advanced than the
 Eastern European satellites, is indicated by Zhukov.   He says:
 "The basic distinction between the people's democracies in the
 - 14 -        /
 Orient and the European people's democracies lies in the fact
 that in the present stage in China, Mongolia, Korea, and Viet-
 nam, people's democracy is solving the national-liberation and
 anti-feudal tasks of the bourgeois-democratic revolution and
 does not set for itself as a task to be resolved in the near
 future, the building of socialism..."   (21)
 According to the Soviet line, then, China was still in
 the first stage of a people's democratic revolution, the task
 of which was to carry out "general democratic" reforms and to
 establish the prerequisites for the future proclamation of the
 "transition to socialism."
 Soviet propagandists were unprepared for the turn of events
 in China--Mao's general line claim that the transition was at
 hand--and were uncertain and confused.  They were confused about
 the way to fit it into the orthodox Soviet theory on the transi-
 tion from capitalism to "socialism" in general, and theoes tab
 lished line on the development of. people's democratic revolu-
 tions in particular.  The Soviet :leaders themselves seemed re
 luctant to accept the transition claim.
 The Russian October Revolution slogans, which   d been
 promulgated on 25 October 1953, had sent greetings to the Chi-
 nese people "who are struggling-.-for industrialization, economic
 and cultural advance, and for the strengthening of the people's
 democratic state."  The specification, "socialist," did not
 appear.  Nor did the Pravda editorial of 9 November take into
 account. Mao's character anion of China's new.stage.  The edi-
 torial merely repeated the formulation as given in the October
 Revolution slogans, while explicitly referring to the building
 of "socialism" in the European Communist countries:
 The great Chinese people are successfully struggling
 for the industrialization of their country, for
 the further advance of their economy and culture, and
 for the all-round strengthening of their people's
 democratic state....  The European people's demo-
 cracies are marching forward with confidence.
 Utilizing the rich Soviet experience, the toilers
 of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Rumania, Hungary, Bulgaria,
 and Albania are successfully struggling for the
 further advance of their national economy and for an
 increase in the material and cultural level of the
 life of the people, and for the building of a social-
 ist society.  /emphasis supplied
 And, Pravda's year-end editorial on 31 December read:
 Shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union along
 this path of progress and happiness march the great
 Chinese people, who have rapidly rebuilt their
 economy and have raised the banner of struggle for
 further economic progress and for industrializa-
 tion, and the European people's democracies, which
 are confidently building socialism.   (23)
 The first overt acknowledgement by a Soviet publicist of
 China's !transition to socialism" came around the middle of
 January 1954.   In the Kommunist review of the fourth volume
 of Mao Tse-tung's Selected Wor s (third volume in the-Chinese
 edition), G. Yefimov stated:
 The People's Government and the Communist party
 are planning to bring about, over a relatively pro-
 longed period of time, the socialist industrializa-
 tion of the country, socialist transformations in
 agriculture, trade, and other sectors of the nation-
 al economy.  The policy of the People's Government
 and the CCP is directed, thus, to the gradual transi-
 tion from the minimum program, the creation of a new
 democratic state, to the maximum program, the building
 of a socialist society in China.   (24)
 The entire statement stands as unique in the January issues of
 Soviet journals and magazines.   There was no Soviet-originated
 statement in any other Soviet publications in January 1954 that
 China was "building socialism."  On the contrary, the traditional
 distinction between European satellites and China continued
 to be made in a number of the January publications.
 Thus,  in an article on Lenin's revolutionary doctrine in
 the 17 January issue of Pravda, the following statement appeared:
 Marxist-Leninist theory and the colossal historic
 experience of the Soviet Union are helping the
 toilers of the European people's democracies to
 build socialism successfully and are inspiring
 the great Chinese people in the building of a new
 life.   (25)
 In quoting Chinese statements, however, the Soviet.wi hers did
 not delete Chime-originated references to the' transition.
 - 16 -
 Thus in the 14 Febuary 1954 Pravda editorial on the occasion
 of the fourth anniversary of-the Sino-Soviet treaty, the state-
 ment was made that "Comrade Mao Tse-tung has characterized the
 present period in the history of China as a new stage--the stage
 of socialist transformations."   (26)
 The testimonials to Sino-Soviet friendship, which commemo-
 rated the Sino-Soviet treaty and appeared on Pravda's third
 page in the form of short articles by various Soviet and Chinese
 workers, peasants, and artists, also reflected the difference
 between Russian and Chinese sources in the references to China's
 stage of development.  Whereas the Russians spoke only in terms
 of China's "building a new life" and being engaged in "build-
 ing up its heavy industry," the Chinese referred to their build-
 ing of a "socialist society," or "building socialism."  ,
 It was in February 1954 that the second direct acknowledge-
 ment of China's entry into the phase of "socialism" appeared
 from a Soviet source.   It came-in an article.on China by I.
 Kurdov in the February issue of Kommunist.   (27)  Now although
 Kurdov acknowledged the new state of affairs in China, he had
 not yet caught up completely with the new Chinese line:  he
 had written that the first stage of the Chinese revolution.was
 concluded only after the completion of the anti-imperialist
 and anti-feudal tasks, which took place, as far as the anti
 feudal tasks were concerned, "in subsequent years" after the
 establishment of the PRC.  The Chinese were claiming, however,
 that the first stage of the revolution was completed, and the
 second stage initiated, with the founding of the PRC.
 The next Soviet-initiated reference to China's new stage
 came toward the end of April from a variety of sources.
 The first was made in the May Day slogans, which were is-
 sued on 21 April 1954.  Number 6 in the list of the slogans
 read in part:   "Greetings to the Chinese people, who are suc-
 cessfully struggling for the socialist industrialization of
 the country, for economic and cultural advance, for the further
 development and strengthening of their people's democratic
 system."   (28)   Compared with the above-cited October Revolu-
 tion slogan on China (1953), it emerges that they are identical
 except for the significant qualifier "socialist" before the
 word "industrialization" in the May Day slogan.
 Toward the end of April, Kaganovich declared to the Soviet
 of the Union of the USSR Supreme Soviet that "The ruling circles
 FOR OFFICJAM USE ONLY
 of the imperialist states, especially the US, are following
 with hatred and anger the successes of Communist construction
 in the USSR and the successes of socialist construction in'the
 great PRC and in all countries of people's democracy."   (29)
 Toward the end of April 1954, then, the Soviets began to
 give general recognition to the claim advanced by the Chinese
 the preceding October that they were engaged in the building
 of "socialism," that they were in the period of "transition
 to socialism."  However, until the end of May, there was no
 discussion by a Soviet theoretician or publicist directed
 specifically to this new phenomenon, no extended article on
 the stages of the Chinese revolution in the light of this new
 development, no echoing of the Chinese claim that the second
 stage--the stage of "socialism"--had begun in October 1949.
 Soviet theorists did insist, however, that with the second
 stage in any Communist country must appear the change from
 "democratic dictatorship" of the proletariat and peasantry to
 "dictatorship of the proletariat."  But this, as we have sug-
 gested, is precisely what Mao refused to do until 1956.  Mao
 had taken the unorthodox step, therefore, of entering the stage
 of "transition to socialism" without declaring a proletarian
 dictatorship.   Mao's formula for transition is in this sense
 different from that prescribed by the Soviets.
 The long delay in Soviet recognition of China's "transi-
 tion to socialism" suggests that Moscow opposed the unorthodox--
 that is, Chinese Communist--line on transition under a "people's
 democratic dictatorship."  During the entire period of Soviet
 resistance, Moscow may have attempted to persuade Peiping to
 declare the proletarian dictatorship.   Certainly, Soviet pro-
 paganda made it clear that this should be done, as the prole-
 tarian dictatorship was held to be necessary for the transition.
 Peiping's failure to yield and the compromise of 1956, which
 was required to conceal the Sino-Soviet variance on proletarian
 dictatorship, can be taken as a measure of Mao's ability even
 in 1953-54 to undertake a policy of which Moscow did not approve.
 By insisting that "peaceful transformation" of capitalists'
 enterprises differs from that of the Soviet Union and the European
 people's democracies, the Chinese claim that Mao has arrived
 at a new form and method for the "transition to socialism."
 To nations engaged in drawing up plans for "mixed economies"
 the claim that"socialism" is being built in this "peculiar"
 way in China would keep the Chinese post-revolutionary example
 of economic behavior at the center of their attention.  (30)
 "Peaceful Transformation" of Capitalists Themselves
 Now the claim for Mao that the Chinese make is not merely
 that the capitalists' enterprises will be transformed (gradually
 placed under state control), but that the capitalists will be
 transformed as men,  i.e. they will be mentally changed or re-
 molded.  Wu C huan-che says that "The ideology of the capital-
 ists, who car&, only for profits, is not absolutely impossible
 to transform...:,  We..can...use the method of education to trans-
 form this ideology."   (31)  The term, "education," actually
 means intensive indoctrination and, in practice,  it is a mild
 form of brainwashing.
 The claim was stated with considerable precision by the
 writer Shu Wei-kuang in 1955:
 .In a state where the proletariat has seized political
 power, under definite social and historical condi-
 tions, establishment of the principle that capital-
 ists can be basically transformed under socialist gui-
 dance is another brilliant contribution of Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung to the treasure house of Marxism-
 Leninism.  This theory has never appeared in the
 classical works of Marxism-Leninism, and no country
 in the world has ever gone through this kind of experi-
 ence.
 In the USSR and the states of people's democracy in
 Eastern Europe, violent and forcible methods of ex-
 propriation were used to eliminate the bourgeoisie.
 But, under our concrete conditions in China, the
 identical goal of eliminating the bourgeoisie can
 be attained by taking the::?road of peaceful trans-
 formation.   (32)
 Shu's claim appears to be valid.
 As notedabove, there is some evidence that the concept
 of a peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce
 was seminal in Lenin and, to a lesser degree, Engels.   But whereas
 - 19 -
 Engels and Lenin gave a warrant for "buying out" the capitalists
 and Lenin saw that they could be put to work for the Soviet
 state,  they never went as far as Mao.   For what Mao wants,. and
 believes he can get,  is not just the capitalists' business,
 their cooperation,and the use of their talents.  He wants their
 souls as well.
 Mao believes that capitalists can be mentally changed and
 will be willing, uvd.er "education," to exchange their capital-
 ist soul for that of a wage earner.   In his report to the 8th
 CCP Congress in 1956, Liu Shao-chi expressed this view With
 considerable confidence:
 In the course of bringing about the socialist trans-
 formation of capitalist industry and commerce, we have
 carried out the transformation of enterprises in con-
 junction with the remolding of individuals.  That is,
 while the enterprises are being transformed, educa-
 tional measures are adopted to remold the capital-
 ists gradually, enabling them to be transformed from
 exploiters into working people earning their own
 living....
 It can now be stated with conviction. that with the
 exception of a very few diehards who still attempt
 to put up resistance,  it is possible,  in the economic
 sphere, for the overwhelming majority of the national
 bourgeoisie to accept socialist transformation and
 gradually change into real working people.   (33)
 Liu's confidence is not based on the belief that the capital-
 ists.will trans~prm their ideology, their world-view, voluntarily.
 This is, of course, possible, but experience undoubtedly shows
 Liu that only few individuals will accept a complete change
 of their moral, political, and economic outlook except when
 they are compelled to do so.
 When Liu says that the capitalists must be "educated and
 remolded"into a "socialist" world-view, he is paraphrasing
 Mao.   In 1949 and in 1950, Mao had stated that:-.the capitalists
 would be educated when the time came.   In his report to the
 party plenum of June 1950, Mao says that "Toward the people,
 /?he people's democratic dictatorship7...does not use compul-
 sion, but democratic methods, namely:                   it does not compel them
 to do this or that, but uses democratic methods in educating
 and persuading them."   (34)
 But both Liu and Mao are using euphemisms, for the line
 between persuasion (through education) and compulsion (through
 terror and threats)  is a fine one indeed in China.   Education
 of the capitalists has been carried out in conjunction with
 "struggle" campaigns of various degrees of intensity.   As Li
 Wei-han, director of the CCP's United Front Work Department
 put it in 1960,  "During the past 10 years, we have waged
 several violent struggles against the national bourgeoisie,
 while at the same time we have launched massive and regular
 educational work among them....  They have gradually turned
 from their passiveness into an active attitude, and they have
 accepted socialist transformation without too much reluctance."
 (35)
 Li concedes that there are still difficulties, as "human
 transformation is an unprecedented andgreat task in the history
 of mankind....  While transformation on' the economic front is
 relatively easy, the real-difficulty lies in the transformation
 of man,  i.e. political and ideological transformation."   (36)
 The "rightists,.  of course, are a problem.  Regarding non-
 Communist "rightists" among intellectuals and capitalists, Li
 speaks of transforming them gradually by means of "criticism,
 isolation, education, and help."  He uses the term, "isolation,"
 again in connection with bourgeois intellectuals in general,
 and it emerges that he is not referring to physical. isolation
 but rather to:.the feeling of having been left out:   "Intellect-
 uals among the working class have made unprecedented progress
 and in this situation, some of the bourgeois intellectuals feel
 they are isolated.   I see nothing wrong in this; it is rather
 desirable."   (37)  Li's remark that it is "desirable" implies
 that creation of this feeling of isolation is deliberately
 fostered by the CCP cadres, whose responsibility it is to "help"
 transform the capitalists.
 The Chinese Communists are clearly aware of the psycholo-
 gical effects of each of their tactics in transforming the minds
 of the capitalists and bourgeois intellectuals, and Li says
 that "Basic transformation is a thorough-going process which
 entails pains and shocks."  Transforming the world-view of the
 capitalists, remolding their thinking through thought reform,
 is a protracted process.   In his On the Correct Handling of
 Contradictions Among the People  June 1957),  Mao predicts that
 the capitalists "will still need   eologica1 remolding for quite
 some time" even in the future when they rid themselves of the
 label "bourgeoisie."   (38)  Mao recommends a combination of
 work among wage earners inthe.)enterprises and "study."
 FOR OFFIC.AL USE ONLY
 FOR . OFF I C,IAr USE ONLY
 To help them in their "study," the Chinese Communists ap-
 parently apply certain aspects of their experiments  in brain-
 washing criminals and political prisoners to more recalcitrant
 capitalists--they are called "diehards"--many of whom are either
 too old and/or have too much self-respect to submit easily to
 the degrading process of thought reform.
 The methods used by the Chinese Communists in indoctrinat-
 ing political prisonsers are decisively different in several
 respects from Soviet methods.  These differences are:
 1.  Unlike the Russians, the Chinese attempt to ensure
 that the political prisoner will develop a long-lasting change
 in his attitude and overt behavior, which will be sustained
 after his release.- Nothing less than the establishment of a
 "new moral code" in the prisoner's mind is a major goal.
 2.  Unlike the Russians, the Chinese make extensive use
 of group interaction among prisoners in obtaining information,
 applying pressures, and carrying out indoctrination.
 3.  Whereas in the USSR and the satellites in Eastern Europe
 the ritual of public self-criticism, confession, self-degrada-
 tion, punishment, and rehabilitation is a party procedure, the
 Chinese have extended this practice to the non-party population,
 and have made it an important aspect of their thought reform
 procedure.
 4.   In China, the period of detention is greatly prolonged.
 Whereas in the USSR trial and sentencing take place fairly soon
 after the completion of the interregation,  in China the prepara-
 tion of a first confession is only a prelude to a long period
 of indoctrination and re-education, which may go on for years
 and is not terminated until the authorities believe that the
 prisoner has finally adopted a "correct" attitude and behavior.
 (39)
 Now a small capitalist, unlike a criminal or political
 offender,  is generally not sent to prison to be mentally trans-
 formed.                    His prison is familiar to him:  his enterprise.
 It appears that Mao has taken over the Soviet practice
 of requiring a public confession, or "self-criticism," and
 further developed it with traditional Chinese methods of sus-
 tained learning by rote and endless repetition.  One Chinese
 writer described protracted learning and self-reform as follows:
 Many businessmen call for a change in their status.
 Certainly a good sign, this is comprehensible to us.
 It indicates that they realize exploitation is shame-
 ful and labor glorious.  But tflchange an exploiter
 into a real laborer is a matter which requires colos-
 sal effort in self-reform.   If any capitalist thinks
 that he can be made into a real laborer simply by
 acquiring the status of laborer and if he pays no
 attention to the bourgeois mentality hatched and
 developed through a long life of exploitation and,
 therefore, relaxes his effort, his self-reform will
 be impeded...A change in status cannot be attained
 simply by waiving his interest income.  He must be
 subjected to a tough course of ideological remold-
 ing.  For this reason, the problem of changing
 status can be solved only gradually and individually,
 according to the actual conditions of each person,
 the principle of voluntariness, and the possibilities
 of success.   (40)
 Capitalists presumably will continue to be capitalists until
 1963 or later.  The payment of fixed interest to industrial-
 ists "will continue until after the second Five-Year Plan,"
 according to Vice Premier Po I-po's statement of 10 December
 1956.  Thus the Chinese Communists envisage a prolonged period
 of thought reform for the capitalists, and Li Wei-han says
 that "We must be patient and meticulous in our work."   (41)
 Patient and meticulous work has indeed produced in China
 a type of capitalist never seen before in other countries.
 And a new type of. capitalist in a Communist country is indeed
 an innovation.  Even Khrushchev was compelled to make, however
 ambiguously, an acknowledgement of the novelty.   In a speech
 at the Chinese embassy in Moscow on 29 November 1956, Khru-
 shchev praised the "original forms" of revolution in China and
 then centered his attention on the capitalists in the Chinese
 delegation.   "I am no longer a young man and in the days gone
 by,  I worked in capitalist enterprises.   I had occasion to
 take part in strikes, to be in workers' delegations, and to
 negotiate with capitalists.  But at that time, we did not sit
 side by side, but were opposed to each other and our interests
 were irreconciable."
 FOR OFFI      USE ONLY
 There is a definite note of orthodoxy in Khrushchev's last
 remark.  This was his backhanded way of flattering the Chinese.
 Moreover, he paid tribute to Mao's innovation without' praising,
 Mao himself.   In 1956, the Soviet leaders felt the need to
 agree with the cocky Chinese at least to the extent that in
 China a new approach to the capitalist man had been discovered.
 But they credited the Chinese party or the Chinese people for
 the unique approach, not Mao, who was the object of the same
 kind of personality cult in China which they were trying to
 discouragpin the USSR and the bloc.
 Choosing his words carefully, Mikoyan had told the Chinese
 party congress in September 1956 that "each country has its
 distinctive features and contributes something specifically its
 own in effecting the transition to socialism."  He stated that
 the bourgeoisie in China had "found it more convenient not to
 clash with the people's state, but to work under its control,"
 and thkt, as compared with the setting of the Russian revolu-
 tion, there had ben in China "new historical conditions, a
 more favorable situation."  This fact explained differences
 in Soviet and Chinese "experience," and left room for certain
 innovations.
 While conceding that the Chinese view on "peaceful trans-
 formation" of small capitalists was something new, Moscow had
 reserved a special kind of praise for the Chinese Communists.
 On 23 November 1956, the Pravda editorial applauded the Chinese
 "who always make it clear that their methods, though perfectly
 correct in their country, are not necessarily of universal-
 ap-plication."  The international significance of Chinese innova-
 tions was a constant source of concern for the Soviet leaders
 then as it is today.
 The idea that a capitalist could be made to change his
 stripes, so to speak,..appears to have evolved from Mao's works
 in the late 1930s and 1940s.   Mao speaks repeatedly in this
 period of "preserving" the capitalist economy in China and of
 sustaining the alliance with the "patriotic capitalists."  But
 it is difficult to determine just when and how the thought oc-
 cured to him that the capitalist man could be transformed into
 the working man.
 Chou En-lai claims some of the credit.  During a discus-
 sion with former premier of France, Edgar Faure, who was visit-
 ing China in 1956, Chou recalled his own stay in France between
 1924 and 1927.  He had worked there as a student and as a manual
 worker, in Paris and Rouen.  Chou stated:
 It was while I was amongst you that I was converted
 to Communism.  I observed, I shared the life of my
 fellow-workers and I came to the conclusion that
 it was not possible to transform the wage earners
 into capitalists, but that it was possible to trans-
 form the capitalists into wage earners.   (42)
 Mr. Faure says that this was a jest on Chou's part, but Chou's
 statement stands as an explicit and unambiguous assertion of
 a bit of personal creativity which is very unusual among Chinese
 leaders other than Mao.
 Chou's "jest" appears as a slender reed beside the claims
 made for Mao regarding transition--claims which proliferated
 in 1960.  According to his eulogists, Mao had shown originality
 on all aspects of the "transition to socialism."  No other Chi-
 nese leader is given credit for any of the policies dealing
 with the construction of "socialism."
 As few doctrines in the world today, Mao's doctrines on
 "buying out" during the "transition to socialism" command a
 devoted service.  The practical way of "buying out" capital
 ists and of transforming them into wage earners is communicated
 by the Chinese Communists to other Communists with the passion-
 ate zeal of a missionary who sets out to conquer a new world
 for his creed.   In the words of Tao Chu, first secretary of
 the Kwangtung Provincial Party Committee,
 Peaceful transformation of the capitalists' enter-
 prises has now been attained in China.  China's ex-.
 perience in this matter is of universal significance.
 The truth underlying this experience is not limited
 to colonial aid semi-colonial countries. We are
 .aware that with the East Wind prevailing over the
 West Wind, revolution will triumph in several capital-
 ist countries and the big capitalists will be de-
 prived of their rights.  At that time, it is entirely
 possible for these countries to adopt the guideline
 of peaceful redemption toward the middle  "national"7
 and small capitalists.   (43)
 This kind of proselytizing has angered the Soviet leaders,
 who are now attempting to take the wind from Mao's sails by
 insisting that'.Marx and Lenin had been the first to discuss
 the policy of "buying out" the bourgeoisie.  The policy has
 been incorporated into the Draft Program of the 22nd Soviet
 party congress as one which had been "foreseen by Marx and
 Lenin."  There is in this connection no mention of Mao.

 30.   Mao's application of the Marx-Engels-Lenin concept of "buy-
 ing out" the capitalists and taking over their busi-
 nesses is alleged to constitute a "model" for under-
 developed countries.   In 1956, Wu Chuan-che stated:
 The experiences and achievements of China's
 socialist transformation of capitalist indus-
 try and commerce have created the following
 model:   for countries which at one time were
 semi-feudal and semi-colonial, just as China
 had been, . .the model  shows how the working
 class should handle its relations with the
 national capitalists and, after revolutionary
 victory, how to eliminate exploitation and
 complete the transition to socialism.  There-
 fore, China's peaceful transformation of
 capitalist industry and commerce as a form
 of class struggle has a very crucial signifi-
 cance.                              We may say that China's experience
 in transition regarding elimination of ex-
 ploitation and of classes certainly has en-
 riched the Marxist-Leninist theory of the
 transition period.
 (Cf. Wu Chuan-che:  note 3 above.)
 In 1960, the Chinese extended the relevance of their
 "model" beyond "semi-colonial" countries to include
 capitalist states.   (Cf. Tao Chu:   note 42 below.)
