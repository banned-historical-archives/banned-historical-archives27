 China:  Second Thoughts on Shenzhen
 Summary
 In a significant about-face, reform leaders have moderated their
 support for the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, once touted as the
 model for economic reform and the 'opening to the outside.'
 Shenzhen's poor
 export performance, its disappointing results in attracting high tech foreign
 firms, and continuing problems with corruption have drawn increasing fire
 from conservative critics, forcing Deng to concede that the zone has not
 been a success.  Signs of Shenzhen's diminished stature include a freeze
 on state funding to the zone and postponement of measures that would
 have increased Shenzhen's autonomy.  Beijing has also cut back on plans
 to develop Shenzhen-like zones in 14 coasta'I cities.
 We believe the downgrading of Shenzhen signals an adjustment of
 China's development strategy.  Although foreign trade and investment will
 still be encouraged, the 'Shenzhen model' of granting foreign trade
 autonomy to selected localities will probably be curtailed in favor of
 renewed central control.  China will probably place greater emphasis on

 the invigoration of established industrial bases, such as Shanghai, instead
 of building zones from scratch.  New foreign investment will be scrutinized
 in terms of supplying needed technologies and contributing to China's
 export potential.  Efforts may be made to curtail the booming trade in
 consumer goods from Hong Kong through Shenzhen, which some Chinese
 leaders view as counterproductive and uncontrollable.  The new trade
 strategy will continue to provide opportunities for US and other Western
 businesses, along with Soviet Bloc countries, to participate in China's
 modernization.  Shenzhen's fall from grace may bolster the reputations of
 conservative critics of reform and harm the careers of several
 Shenzhen and the Opening to the Outside
 By far the largest and most developed of the four Special Economic Zones (SEZ),1
 Shenzhen was once called the 'key to the future' by China's reform leaders.  Established
 in late 1980, Shenzhen was to offer foreigners an improved investment climate through
 the use of tariff concessions,  tax breaks, relatively cheap labor, and simplified
 administrative procedures for setting up joint ventures.  After an initial period of
 infrastructure development, Shenzhen was expected to attract western high-tech firms
 with the latest in production facilities for the Chinese to study, and the zone's
 production was to be keyed to the export market to generate foreign exchange.
 Since its establishment, Shenzhen has been the model for a key element of Deng
 Xiaoping's policy of 'opening to the outside' -- encouraging local initiative in foreign
 trade by granting limited trade autonomy to selected areas.  Deng has told both national
 and regional leaders to learn from Shenzhen, and a stream of officials has visited the
 zone to study its methods of attracting and employing foreign technology and
 investment.  Against the advice of conservative leaders, in early 1984 Deng pushed for
 establishment of 14 open coastal cities2 which were to follow Shenzhen's example.
 An added- incentive for the development of the SEZs was the desire to showcase
 China's ability and willingness to tolerate different economic systems as part of efforts
 to "reunite" with Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan.  Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Xiamen officials
 have been encouraged to build business ties with investors in Hong Kong, Macao, and
 Taiwan, respectively.
 1 Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou SEZs are located in? Guangdong Province.  Xiamen SEZ
 is located in Fujian Province.
 2 Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Dalian, Zhanjiang, Nantou, Ningbo, Wenzhou,
 Qinhuangdao, Fuzhou, Lianyungang, Yantai, Beihai, and Qingdao were declared the "14
 open coastal cities" in April 1984.  Yinkou was added to the, list in April 1985, but PRC
 reports have continued to refer to "14 open coastal` cities."

 Second Thoughts on Shenzhen
 We believe two key issues led reform leaders to reevaluate their support for
 Shenzhen early this year: the campaign to control official corruption, and the sharp,
 unexpected drop in China's foreign exchange reserves.  As the leadership focused on
 these issues, Shenzhen's disappointing economic record and reputation as a center of
 corrupt activities made the zone a target of high-level criticism.
 Deng Xiaoping's comment in late June to an Algerian delegation that Shenzhen
 was an 'experiment' which he hoped would, succeed, but which might fail, was the first
 public indication that reform- leaders had tempered their support for the zone.  Although
 Shenzhen leaders have since claimed that Deng's comment does not represent any
 change in his position, evidence suggests that Deng had earlier moderated his position
 on the SEZs in the face of high-level criticism of the 'opening to the outside.'
 We believe that Deng's
 comment to the Algerians signaled his intention to stop expending political capital to
 defend Shenzhen against its critics.  State Councillor Gu Mu -- who heads the State
 Council office in charge of the SEZs -- stated on 15 July that plans to develop the 14
 open coastal cities have been scaled back to focus on the four most developed of the
 cities (Shanghai, Tianjin, Dalian, and Guangzhou).  We view this as evidence of a further
 reorientation in China's trade policy.
 Shenzhen's Disappointing Record
 Nearly five years after its establishment, Shenzhen has yet to fulfill the
 expectations of its supporters by becoming an economically viable generator of foreign
 exchange earnings.  Specifically:
 o  An unexpectedly large portion of Shenzhen investment has come from inland
 Chinese sources as provinces and government ministries have sought to get a
 share of Shenzhen's expertise, foreign exchange, and goods.
 by the end of 1982
 foreign investment accounted for about 60 percent of total capital construction
 investment in the zone.  Earlier this year, Premier Zhao Ziyang reportedly
 indicated that foreign investment is now only 40 percent of the total.
 o   The type of foreign investment in Shenzhen has drawn leadership criticism.
 Between late 1979 and mid-1983, only about 1'2 percent of investment was in
 industrial projects; the remainder was almost entirely devoted to real estate
 development and tourism facilities.  The industrial projects which have been
 established are primarily low technology -- out of 585 industrial projects funded
 in the first half of 1983, 517 were in textiles and food processing, and only 16
 were electronics firms.  Shenzhen officials have had to offer concessionary terms
 to attract the few showcase high-tech firms which do exist in the zone.  Roughly
 90 percent of foreign investment in Shenzhen has come from Hong Kong sources,

 primarily a spinoff from the real estate boom in the colony in the early 1980s.
 Few US, Japanese, or West European firms have participated in the zone's
 development.
 o   Shenzhen has not lived up to expectations of ..,producing primarily for export.
 During a March interview with Hong Kong reporters, Vice Premier Yao Yilin stated
 that only one-third of SEZ production is actually exported.  A Hong Kong press
 article quoted Gu Mu as stating that since mid-1984 Shenzhen's foreign exchange
 earnings have been dropping.  Other leadership statements imply that the zone
 has become a net drain on China's foreign exchange reserves.  Shenzhen's poor
 export performance has become a source of acute embarrassment in light of
 Beijing's discovery early this year of an unexpectedly large drop in foreign
 exchange reserves.
 Corruption in Shenzhen
 Shenzhen`s disappointing economic results have left its backers with little
 defense against charges that the zone is a center of'.corruption.  Since late 1984,
 mounting official corruption in China -- the so-called 'unhealthy practices' -- has
 become a central political issue.  The extent of corruption belies reformist claims that
 they can control the corrosive aspects of Western society while promoting trade with
 the West.  Although Shenzhen has not been singled out for public rebuke -- perhaps
 because such charges would embarrass Deng Xiaoping -~
 Forms of corruption evident in Shenzhen include black-market currency
 speculation, unauthorized export of agricultural products to Hong Kong, the widespread
 practice of officials soliciting bribes to handle nearly all transactions, and smuggling of
 consumer goods and what the government terms pornographic videotapes and literature
 into China.  Perpetrators include individual entrepreneurs, party cadre, government
 departments, and provincial trade representatives.  Efforts by Shenzhen officials to
 attract tourists from Hong Kong reportedly have led them to establish casinos, massage
 parlors, and brothels, all of which contribute to the image of the zone as being rife with
 decadence and corruption.
 As a result of Shenzhen's demotion from 'model' status, the zone will probably be
 exposed to keener competition from other SEZs, the remaining open cities, and other
 regions in China for new investments and development credits.  The end result may be
 to force Shenzhen officials to deal more aggressively, with problems in the zone, to work
 harder to acquire high-technology industries, and to push exports.
 According to Hong Kong press reporting, central financial support of the zone is
 being frozen and may be cut back.  Yao Yilin reportedly told Shenzhen officials in late
 April that the "blood transfusions" of central funds to keep the zone alive couldn't

 continue.  During a late June State Council conference on special zones and open cities,
 Shenzhen was ordered to keep 1985 capital construction investments at last year's level
 of 1.6 billion yuan, instead of the planned 2.5 billion Yuan.  Budgets of the other three
 SEZs were also frozen or cut back.
 Several reforms that would have granted Shenzhen greater trade autonomy have
 been delayed repeatedly, and may now be postponed indefinitely.  They include the
 activation of strengthened border facilities -- including a fence and numerous guard
 posts --between Shenzhen and Guangdong Province and the issuing of a special
 currency for the zone.
 The "Opening to the Outside" Without Shenzhen
 We believe China's policy of 'opening to the outside' will continue, both in
 propaganda and in fact.  China's need for foreign technology and investment is widely
 recognized, and Chinese leaders understand that the country cannot afford to be seen
 as a fickle business partner.  The SEZs themselves won't be simply abandoned; China
 will attempt to realize some return on its investment in the zones, and the Xiamen SEZ
 will probably continue to receive preferential treatment as part of Beijing's efforts to
 build commercial links with Taiwan.
 China's development strategy with regard to foreign technology and investment
 is likely to shift, however.  Chinese leaders now admit that Shanghai and other
 established industrial areas have been a better long-term economic success than
 Shenzhen and can probably make better use of new ,development funds, whether from
 domestic or overseas sources.  As an example of this kind of thinking, a recent
 economic article by a Peoples' Bank of China official', called for ending the emphasis on
 attracting foreign investment to the southern special economic zones and replacing it
 with a "northern strategy" which would bring more investment to China's interior and
 permit greater access to China's domestic market by foreigners.  While supporting, and
 indeed expanding the open door policy, the article criticized the SEZs for leading to
 unbalanced and narrowly focused foreign investment.
 One of the lessons Chinese leaders may draw from Shenzhen is that the
 decentralization of foreign trade authority leads to unacceptable confusion.  The
 unexpected drop in foreign currency reserves is regarded as one symptom of the lack of
 central oversight over trade arrangements.  Chinese leaders have also complained about
 unnecessary duplication in imports, competition between imported products and
 domestically produced goods, and encroachment of undesirable elements of foreign
 culture, all of which have accompanied open trade between Shenzhen and Hong Kong.
 Beijing moved to recentralize control over foreign trade this spring, setting restrictions
 on localities' use of foreign exchange and banning local imports of motor vehicles,
 videorecorders, and other consumer goods.
 In our view, a shift to an 'opening to the outside' strategy which stresses
 developing China's established bases and inland resources will provide continued
 opportunities for US and other Western businessmen.  Priority projects will include

 revitalization of the transportation network, energy development, natural resource
 exploitation, and export promotion.  Firms doing business in China probably will find
 renewed involvement of central authorities in project approval and stiff bargaining over
 financing arrangements.
 The new trade strategy may also increase access for the Soviet Union and other
 Eastern Btoc countries to Chinese trade opportunities.  Soviet officials have complained
 of being frozen out of the SEZs and the 14 open coastal cities, and they probably will
 welcome a downgrading of the zones.  It is widely believed that renovation of existing
 plants, many of which were originally established by the Soviets in the 1950s, is an area
 in which Soviet assistance is needed.  Under the Economic Cooperation Agreement
 signed in Moscow on 10 July, the Soviets will help China upgrade 17 plants arid may
 transfer additional technology and capital goods.  Chinese leaders may well regard
 trading with Soviet government bureaus less threatening and troublesome than dealing
 with the corrupting influence of Western businesses.
 The Political Consequences of Shenzhen's Reevaluation
 The SEZs' clear identification with Deng Xiaoping and his reformist proteges
 suggest that a reevaluation of Shenzhen could be seen as a setback for the reform
 program.  Deng has visited Shenzhen several times and has encouraged other Chinese
 leaders to do so in order to get a glimpse of the future China which reformers
 envisioned.  Deng's withdrawal of public support for Shenzhen has cost the SEZs their
 most ardent and powerful supporter.  Although Shenzhen's problems clearly have caused
 Deng some political embarrassment, we do not believe that Deng's own leadership will
 be significantly affected by Shenzhen's decline in stature.
 Further political fallout from the downgrading. of Shenzhen is not yet evident, but
 conservatives will almost certainly attempt to gain some political capital from Deng's
 admission that the SEZs have been a mistake.  Among second-echelon leaders, Premier

 Zhao Ziyang has been closely associated with the development of the zones, and he
 may have continued to encourage deals in the zones which used foreign exchange until
 signs of the drop in reserves became evident.  Zhao was reportedly criticized for
 economic problems during the National People's Congress session in April, and problems .
 in Shenzhen may have been part of the charges leveled against him.  State Councillor
 Gu Mu is also a prime candidate for criticism over Shenzhen's record.  It is possible he
 wilt be among those scheduled to "retire" from the Party Secretariat at the party
 delegates conference in September.
