 VIETNAM
 Communist-initiated incidents in South Vietnam reached
 a record high last week, sustaining the accelerated
 pace of the past few weeks.  A number of unusual devel-
 opments  suggest that additional deployments of regular
 North Vietnamese Army units may be under way.  Asian
 Communist propaganda capitalized heavily on last week's
 protest demonstrations in the ITS against policy in Viet-
 nam.   Hanoi appears to be seeking new bloc commitments
 of economic assistance to counter the effects of US
 bombings.

 SOVIET POLITICS AND THE INDUSTRIAL REORGANIZATION                             4
 Political intrigue continues in the USSR.  Last Septem-
 ber's political compromises affecting the economy appar-
 ently did not stabilize the political situation and par-
 ticularly did not settle the question of where the di-
 viding line lies between party and government authority
 --and, by extension, between that of Brezhnev and Kosygin.
 MOSCOW'S CALIBRATED RESPONSE TO CHINESE POLEMICAL ATTACK         6
 Pravda recently responded forcefully to the latest  Chi-
 nese anti-Soviet tirade in an effort to discredit and
 isolate Peking.  Moscow, however, will probably continue
 to avoid the tit-for-tat acrimony reminiscent of the
 Khrushchev era.
 COMMUNIST CHINA PUTS POLITICAL PRESSURE ON SCIENTISTS             7
 Peking's demand for more political subservience from
 physicists and other natural scientists could ultimately
 have an impact comparable to Lysenkoism, which hampered
 science in the USSR for many years,

 Peking has agreed to increase its military aid commit-

 vexation with Phnom Penh's pro-Chinese attitude.

 are exerting pressure in other areas.
 ISRAEL, THE ARAB STATES, AND PALESTINE "LIBERATION" ACTIVITIES
 The Arab states have differing policies toward the or-
 ganizations dedicated to the "liberation" of Palestine.
 Jordan, the haven for most of the Palestine Arab refu-
 gees, keeps a damper on both their political and terror-
 ist activities because it is the Arab state most suscep-
 tible to Israeli reprisals and is vulnerable to Nasirite
 subversion among the Palestinians.  Syria, far less ex-
 posed to Israeli retaliation, encourages the Palestinian
 refugee raids into Israel.  Egypt is cautious in support-
 ing the Arab-Palestine cause because a wrong move could,
 with little warning, provoke the worst Arab-Israeli con-
 frontation since the Suez conflict.   (Publishes separately

 VIETNAM
 Communist-initiated inci-
 dents in South Vietnam last week
 reached a record high, sustain-
 ing the accelerated pace of Viet
 Cong activity during the past
 few weeks.   One of the most
 damaging large-scale actions of
 the war occurred on 27 November,
 when a Viet Cong force of at
 least regimental strength
 launched a dawn attack on the
 Vietnamese 7th Regiment in Binh
 Duong Province.   Although the
 7th had beaten off an attack in
 the same area five days before,
 enemy forces this time achieved
 complete surprise, overran two
 battalions, and inflicted 600-
 700 casualties in four hours
 of severe fighting. Allied rein-
 forcements searching the area
 afterward failed to make contact
 with the enemy force.   The Viet
 Cong also attacked several gov-
 ernment outposts and positions
 in the coastal provinces of I
 and II Corps.
 Incidents of terrorism,
 also at record levels last week,
 were concentrated in government-
 controlled areas in the delta
 region and near Saigon where
 seven hamlet chiefs and one dis-
 trict official have been killed
 in the past three months.
 US military officials have
 confirmed two new Viet Cong
 regiments in Phuoc Tuy Province
 and list a probable additional
 enemy regiment near Saigon.
 Confirmed enemy regiments in
 South Vietnam now number 18,  in-
 cluding seven North Vietnamese
 regiments.   Confirmed enemy
 strength now totals 68,OCC main
 force troops.   In addition there
 are some 39,000 political cadres,
 17,000 combat support troops,
 and over 100,000 guerrillas.

 Three more surface-to-air
 missile sites have been found in
 North Vietnam,
 bringing the total number to 52.
 Sites 50 and 51 are located
 about 25 miles west-northwest
 of Hanoi and one is apparently
 still under construction.   The
 52nd site is located eight miles
 northeast of Thanh Hoa.    None
 of the three sites contained
 missiles or missile-associated
 equipment.
 The Asian Communists capi-
 talized heavily on last week's
 protest demonstrations in the
 US against policy in Vietnam. The
 principal Vietnamese Communist
 moves were a special message
 from Ho Chi Minh to the protest
 leaders, and the Viet Cong's re-
 lease of the two long-captive
 US soldiers who subsequently
 told the press in Cambodia of
 their desire to "tell the Ameri-
 can people the truth about Viet-
 nam."    Peking characterized the
 protests as "quite different"
 from past peace campaigns be-
 cause they did not stop at de-
 manding peace in general terms
 but clearly directed their "fire
 at the US ruling circle's pol-
 icies of aggression and war."
 The Chinese may see the protest
 movement as an important element
 in US policy considerations in
 the long term.    Over the short
 run,   they probably hope the
 protests will serve to bolster
 Vietnamese Communist morale in   25X1
 the face of the US buildup.
 The need for this kind of
 support was illustrated by the
 defensive tone of a South Viet-
 namese Liberation Radio broad-
 cast of 20 November.    The broad-
 cast lashed out at unidentified
 critics of the Vietnamese Commu-
 nist decision to continue fight-
 ing,   accusing those who advo-
 cate negotiating unconditionally

 with the US of being "lackeys of

 betraying the revolution,  their

 Although this broadcast may have
 been aimed at foreign Communist
 critics,  it may also have been
 a remonstration to some Vietnamese
 Communists who have lost confi-
 dence in Viet Cong military pros-
 pects.
 For the second time in five
 months,  the DRV has dispatched
 high-ranking economic specialist
 Le Thanh Nghi to Peking, Moscow,
 and Pyongyang.   Nghi's return to
 both Moscow and Peking in such
 a short time suggests that  im-
 portant or difficult economic
 problems may be under negotia-
 tion.   However, Hanoi may be seek-

 equipment for bomb damage repair
 and perhaps even food,   clothing,
 and other necessities whose pro-
 duction may have been disrupted
 by the bombings.   Hanoi may also
 believe it essential to get some
 long range commitment on future
 bloc assistance in the event that
 US bombings destroy most of North
 Vietnam's industry and transporta-
 tion system.
 Canadian Communist Party
 president Tim Buck is presently
 heading a delegation to Hanoi.
 This is the third free world
 Communist party delegation to
 Hanoi this year and appears to
 be part of an effort by the
 North Vietnamese to elicit more
 vigorous support.  The Canadians
 were received by Ho Chi Minh and
 have conducted talks with party
 First Secretary Le Duan.
 The Com!iunist World
 Recent developments suggest
 that the compromises reached in
 September which enabled the So-
 viet regime to move ahead with
 industrial reorganization did not
 entail any real stabilization of
 the political situation.   In
 particular, the question of where
 the dividing line lies between
 party and government authority--
 and, by extension, between that
 of Brezhnev and Kosygin--clearly
 was not settled.
 Political maneuvering, seen
 chiefly in personnel shifts,  has
 continued and apparently has cen-
 tered on the party-government is-

 sue.   An important issue at any
 time,  it  is given a special
 urgency by the approach of the
 23rd Party Congress, set for 29
 March 1966.   Thus far the party
 seems to be ahead.
 Only a week after the Supreme
 Soviet had reorganized the gov-
 ernment and amended the constitu-
 tion, 18 members were dropled from
 the Council of Ministers, leav-
 ing 65, exclusive of the 15 re-
 public premiers who seldom at-
 tend council meetings.   In the
 process, four of the eleven state
 committees whose chairmen, by the

 amended constitution, were auto-
 matically members of the council
 were dropped from that status.
 In mid-November Mikhail Yefremov
 was added to the council as a
 deputy premier.
 These changes so soon after
 the Supreme Soviet met clearly
 indicate continuing political
 strife.   Yefremov is a party pro-
 fessional without previous gov-
 ernment experience.   His appoint-
 ment is indicative of the party's
 tactics of infiltrating the gov-
 ernment to ensure a strong party
 role in economic adminstration.
 One of the clearest state-
 ments of the party's claims to
 jurisdiction  in  the new system
 is an Armenian party decree giv-
 ing the, republic's party organ-
 izations the task of selecting
 personnel for the newly formed
 republic executive agencies.
 Concrete evidence of party incur-
 sions into the government sphere
 is the large number of party
 professionals who have recently
 been given government posts:   in
 the republics, one premier, one
 first deputy premier, 4 deputy
 premiers, and 17 ministers;  in
 the USSR Council of Ministers,
 one deputy premier, one minister,
 and two deputy ministers (all high
 party officials).  The promotion
 of Dmitry Polyansky to first
 deputy premier perhaps should
 also be added since he too, al-
 though most recently serving the
 party as a deputy premier, has
 made his career as a party pro-
 fessional.
 In other respects the
 reorganization has been carried
 out more or less as expected.
 The republics have completed
 theirs--at least on paper--
 and staffing of the new agencies
 is well advanced.   The republic
 party organizations, responding
 to the convening of the 23rd
 Congress of the CPSU, have set

 MOSCOW'S CALIBRATED RESPONSE
 Confronted with Communist
 China's stepped-up anti-Soviet
 campaign, Moscow has been rela-
 tively restrained in its public
 reaction.   This tactic, however,
 has not prevented the Soviet lead-
 ers from responding forcefully
 to a particularly galling Chinese
 affront, especially when they con-
 sidered Peking vulnerable.
 Such was the case on 28 No-
 vember when Pravda,  in a  lengthy
 editorial, attempted to exploit
 the 11 November Peking People's
 Daily - Red Flag polemic:e-
 ec ing   ovie   satisfaction at
 the setbacks the Chinese have
 suffered in their world-wide pol-
 icies, Pravda set out to demon-
 strate   gat Cina's obstruction-
 ist tactics have isolated it from
 the  "overwhelming majority" of
 revolutionary forces which have
 endorsed Moscow's call for united
 action against the  "common enemy,
 imperialism."
 The Soviet response reflects,
 in part, concern lest continued
 silence be interpreted as a sign
 of weakness -or-an admisssion of
 guilt.   It is, however, even more
 indicative of Moscow's view that
 Peking's open refusal to cooperate
 with the USSR in defense of Viet-
 nam has played into Soviet hands.
 Pravda continues to appeal
 for join   action, even though it
 has long since become obvious
 that there is little possibility
 of coordinating either aid or
 policies in support of Hanoi.
 Moscow's tactic has been designed
 to draw a rejection from Peking
 and thus lay the blame for
 TO CHINESE POLEMICAL ATTACK
 intrabloc difficulties squarely
 on the Chinese.   Not until China's
 most recent full-scale polemic,
 however, have the Soviets been
 able to point to an open admis-
 sion by Peking of its adamant
 stand.
 The Pravda editorial does
 not refer specifically to the
 People's Daily - Red Flag tirade,
 nor does     attempt To -counter
 or refute all the Chinese charges.
 The target is clear, however,
 particularly when Pravda condemns
 the "line of political and or-
 ganizational division, of split-
 ting the Communist movement now
 counterposed to the clearcut po-
 sition of Marxist-Leninist parties
 which advocate unity of action."
 The editorial lays special stress
 on the serious harm to the Viet-
 namese Communists caused by "this
 splitting."
 Apart from these refinements,
 Pravda covered familiar ground in
 comparatively nonpolemical fash-
 ion, and generally reflected the
 satisfaction with which Khru -
 shchev's successors view the gains
 achieved by their more subtle ap-
 proach to bloc affairs.   Despite
 the recent Chinese challenge to
 "carry on public polemics," the
 Soviets will probably continue
 to avoid the heated, tit-for-tat
 acrimony reminiscent of the
 Khrushchev era, but will speak
 out when the occasion demands,
 as they now have done  sever
 times over the past year.

 COMMUNIST CHINA PUTS POLITICAL PRESSURE ON SCIENTISTS
 The Peking regime is demand-
 ing more political subservience
 from physicists and other natural
 scientists.   Although the lead-
 ership has always insisted that
 all intellectuals be "red" as
 well as "expert," it put rela-
 tively little pressure on natu-
 ral scientists for several years
 after the Soviets withdrew their
 technical experts in 1960.
 In January 1965, however,
 the authoritative theoretical
 journal of the Chinese Communist
 Party, Red Flag, lashed out at
 natural scientists with a, demand
 that they, like everybody else,
 consider the "class struggle"
 their foremost task.   On 4 June
 1965, People's Daily published
 an a.rt    ems ggnedby Chien Hsueh-
 sen, US-trained rocket specialist,
 apologizing for having belittled
 politics in the past.  He warned
 that scientists must not consider
 themselves an elite group, but
 must humbly study and apply Mao's
 ideas.
 Since last summer Red Flag
 has published several a.r?T 1es
 exhorting scientists to spend
 more time reading Mao Tse-tung's
 revolutionary political tracts
 and to use his ideas, buttressed
 by dialectical materialism, to
 guide their research work.   Pub-
 lication of the series in Red
 Flag suggests that a, major pol-
 y-decision on this issue was
 made at the highest level.
 The Red Flag articles, exud-
 ing typicTChi~nese arrogance,
 attack several prominent Western
 scientists--including Niels Bohr,
 Werner Heisenberg, and Linus
 Pauling--for alleged philosophi-
 cal failings.   Red Flag charges
 that Bohr's Cope-nTiagen school of
 theoretical physics mislead the
 world of physics for 40 years by
 failing to adopt a dialectical
 approach.  This criticism is sig-
 nificant because the Bohr Insti-
 tute--center of the Copenhagen
 school--has been giving postdocto-
 ra.l training to two junior Chi-
 nese Communist nuclear physicists
 since 1963.
 Red Flag had high praise for
 one foreigner, a Japanese named
 Sakata, whose work on subatomic
 particles allegedly proves the
 universal validity of Mao Tse-
 tung's thesis that "one always
 splits into two."  This previously
 had been applied only in a poli-
 tical context, to justify Chinese
 efforts to split the international
 Communist movement and to support
 divisive revolutionary activities
 a.broa.d.
 The recent Red Flag articles
 indicate that hencefor    Chinese
 scientists will be expected to use
 political as well as scientific
 criteria, to determine the suit-
 ability of Western scientific
 theories.   The effects of this
 policy cannot yet be judged, but
 it could ultimately have an im-
 pact comparable to Lysenkoism,
 which hampered science in the USSR
 for many years.  The damage done
 in China, will depend on the extent
 to which scientists are allowed
 to continue their serious work
 while merely giving lip service
 to political shibboleths.

 PEKING OUTBURST AT BOURGUIBA REFLECTS HARDER POLICY LINE
 Peking recently lashed out at
 Tunisian President Bourguiba for
 his outspoken criticism of China's
 leaders in an interview with the
 French journal Realities.   Bour-
 guiba had apparently referred to
 Peking's "limitless pretentions."
 A sharply worded diplomatic pro-
 test on 19 November was followed
 by an editorial in People's Daily
 the following day which    ok   our-
 guiba to task for "railing at China"
 whenever he wants US aid.
 The Chinese Communists had
 never before attacked by name the
 leader of an African country with
 which they maintain diplomatic rela-
 tions.   Their annoyance in this in-
 stance was probably due mainly to
 Tunisia's decision to abstain this
 year on the Chinese representation
 vote in the UN.   The Tunisians had
 voted in favor of seating Communist
 China in 1963.
 Although the bitter Chinese
 outburst may presage a further de-
 terioration in the no-more-than-cor-
 rect relations between the two coun-
 tries, a complete break is probably
 not imminent.   The Chinese are un-
 doubtedly loath to reduce their dip-
 lomatic presence in Africa.   In the
 last year only one additional Afri-
 can country recognized China.   On
 the other hand, recent Chinese for-
 eign policy moves have shown signs
 of growing inflexibility and doc-
 trinal fanaticism.    The Chinese
 now are certainly less solicitous
 of the feelings of African moder-
 ates and even tend to ignore those
 of many of the more radical Afri-
 cans.

 INDONESIAN ARMY PRESSES ANTI-COMMUNIST DRIVE
 The Indonesian Army continues
 to put pressure on President Sukarno
 and to push its attack on the Com-
 munist Party (PKI).   Although the
 army clearly has the upper hand over
 the Communists, the power struggle
 with Sukarno remains unresolved.
 Sukarno has dismissed air
 force chief Dani, a prime target of
 the army for his role in October's
 abortive coup.   Although Dani re-
 tains his cabinet post, his dis-
 charge is a virtual admission by
 Sukarno of Dani's complicity. Sev-
 eral prominent left-wing politi-
 cians, previously under Sukarno's
 protection, are apparently under de-
 tention.   Foreign Minister Suban=
 drio, another army target, has pub-
 licly accused the PKI of master-
 minding the uprising, a reversal

 of his  earlier efforts to play
 down the party's role.
 There are indications that
 Indonesian political parties hope
 to exploit the deteriorating eco-
 nomic situation to force cabinet
 changes on Sukarno.   Rice sup-
 plies are shrinking and infla-
 tion is rampant.   Catholic Party
 leaders, backed by six other
 parties, are reportedly asking
 for an emergency inner cabinet
 to "settle economic problems and
 stabilize the situation."   If
 Sukarno bows, the army and its
 allies presumably intend to
 capitalize on any foreign aid
 they may obtain in the future to
 cement their position.
 The piecemeal dissolution
 of the PKI and its affiliates
 continues, and there is consider-
 able speculation that Sukarno,
 who now may have accepted the
 PKI's demise, will soon issue a
 formal ban.   The army apparently

 strengthened by recent new com-

 SCATTERED FIGHTING CONTINUES IN LAOS
 Fighting continues in
 widely separated areas of Laos
 although no major Communist at-
 tacks have been reported in the
 past week.
 In the Thakhek area  in cen-
 tral Laos, reinforced government
 forces have regained several po-
 sitions lost to the Communists
 in early November and now are
 mounting cautious sweeps to the
 east along Route 12 and south
 along Route 13.   The Communists
 have withdrawn from one position
 straddling Route 13 some ten miles
 southeast of Thakhek.   However,
 reports indicating that substan-
 tial numbers of Communist troops
 moved west on Route 12 in mid-
 November suggest that renewed
 Communist pressure in the Thakhek
 area may be in the offing.
 The Communists have in-
 creased pressure against govern-
 ment positions south of Muong
 Phalane.   Several companies of
 friendly troops withdrew on 28
 November from positions along
 the Se Kum Kam river to fall-
 back positions around Ban Nong
 Boualao, a key defensive posi-
 tion.   Reinforcements have been
 brought in to defend the village.
 In northern Laos,  friendly
 guerrillas have recaptured Vieng
 Pou Kha, some 90 miles northwest
 of Luang Prabang, which was lost
 to the Pathet Lao last May. In
 the Samneua area, light Communist
 probes over the past two weeks
 have been rebuffed by friendly
 forces positioned along Route 6.
 Roadwatch reports indicating that
 the Communists are moving large
 supply convoys south of Samneua
 town to their advanced positions
 suggest that some step-up in their
 efforts to clear Route 6 may be

 CONGO QUIET AFTER MOBUTU TAKE-OVER
 Congolese politics seem
 headed for a period of relative
 calm following last week's coup
 by army chief Mobutu.
 Mobutu,  who installed him-
 self as President on 25 November,
 has kept extensive power in his
 own hands. He has assumed the
 authority to legislate by decree,
 and has taken charge of the coun-
 try's security police.   He also
 holds the defense and information
 ministries in the cabinet, headed
 by army Colonel Mulamba,which re-
 ceived parliamentary approval on
 27 November.
 This is a considerable con-
 centration of authority for one
 who has never been a brilliant ad-
 ministrator.   Moreover,  Mobutu
 will have to spend a good deal of
 time monitoring the politicians
 in the cabinet, since Mulamba, al-
 though he is one of the few com-
 petent officers in the army, has
 no experience in Leopoldville pol-
 itics.   Their first task is to
 get the ministers to transcend
 regional and personal interests--
 and in this regard Mulamba's ap-
 pointment of relatives to impor-
 tant positions is an inauspicious
 first step.
 The position of the politi-
 cians themselves is still uncer-
 tain.   Ex-President Kasavubu is
 at his house in the Leopoldville
 paracommando camp.   He does not
 seem to be pressing for permission
 to return to his tribal area west
 of Leopoldville, and the army
 probably would not allow him to
 leave if he wanted to.   Former
 premier Tshombd apparently is
 biding his time on the theory
 that Mobutu will eventually turn
 to him.   In the meantime he is
 cultivating Mulamba, who has al-
 ready consulted him several times.
 Tshombd is said to be thinking of
 developing an image as the cham-
 pion of "legality" in the face of
 the "illegal" army take-over.
 Several other politicians, in-
 cluding former premier Adoula,
 are holding aloof from politics.
 Ex-Interior Minister Nendaka's
 status is uncertain.   He is in-
 cluded in the government, but in
 the less important transport min-
 istry.                                                                  Mulamba distrusts him, and
 Mobutu in the days before the
 coup was concerned about his am-
 bition and opportunism.   The ex-
 tent to which he can regain his
 influence depends on the degree
 to which Mobutu's proverbial loy-
 alty to  long-time associates
 overcomes his qualms about Nen-
 daka's recent activites.
 The coup's long-term signif-
 icance may turn out to be the im-
 mersion of the army in politics.
 For a few months the country may
 be carried along on the euphoria
 attendant on the partial dis-
 placement of Leopoldville polit-
 icos.    Later, however,  the coun-
 try may find itself with compet-
 ing military factions added to
 the traditional civilian maneuver-
 ing.

 Dahomey's chronic political
 instability has again produced
 an abrupt change of regime and a
 provisional government installed
 by the country's military leaders.
 The new system which emerges seems
 likely to be based, at the insist-
 ence  of the army, on support
 from all three of Dahomey's major
 regions.
 Dahomey has a political tra-
 dition of depending on a coali-
 tion of two of its three princi-
 pal regional leaders, with the
 third excluded and often in
 prison.   The roles were rotated
 periodically.  The most recent
 arrangement, initiated after an
 army-supported revolt in late
 1963, had a dual executive--
 Sourou-Migan Apithy as president
 and chief of state and Justin
 Ahomadegbe as the slightly more
 powerful vice president and chief
 of government--and former presi-
 dent Hubert Maga in prison. Vir-
 tually from their inauguration,
 Apithy and Ahomadegbe began in-
 triguing against one another.
 On 25 November, after releasing
 Maga and lining up the support
 of a broad range of organiza-
 tions, Ahomadegbe launched his
 attempt to oust Apithy.
 Apithy refused to budge from
 the presidential palace in Porto
 Novo, the center of his political
 support, and some popular agita-
 tion in his favor ensued. Faced
 with a developing stalemate, the
 army stepped in and, after a
 minimal show of force, secured
 the resignations of both execu-
 tives.  From that point, the
 situation was returned to consti-
 tutional procedures and the pres-
 idency passed to the president
 of the National Assembly, Tahirou
 Congacou, who is favorable to
 Maga.   Apithy, Ahomadegbe, and
 Congacou on 29 November made a
 joint radio appeal for calm and
 conditions returned to normal.
 The provisional government plans
 to complete a constitutional re-
 vision and to hold new presiden-
 tial elections within 50 days.
 Army Chief of Staff Soglo,
 who is being credited with bring-
 ing off this coup, has not yet
 clarified his own political po-
 sition. He is believed to have
 personal ambitions for the presi-
 dency.  However, the army is it-
 self divided and Soglo seems un-
 willing to gamble on a move which
 might lack the support of a ma-
 jority of the officers.
 The apparent popular indif-
 ference to the overthrow of the
 regime indicates that the people
 of Dahomey are tiring of thel con-
 stant maneuvering of their leaders.
 They probably would accept any
 government, particularly one with
 high-level representation from
 all three regions, which showed
 an inclination to come to grips
 with the country's serious eco-
 nomic problems.  France, which
 continues to make heavy budge-
 tary contributions to Dahomey,
 is evidently prepared to support  25X1
 any political settlement that
 safeguards its own interests in
 the country.

 hydroelectric complex on the
 Rhodesian side of the border.

 Wilson also revealed that
 he had offered Zambia an RAF
 jet fighter squadron, to be
 stationed at Ndola in northern
 Zambia, and RAF ground forces
 to go to airfields there, at
 Lusaka, and possibly Living-
 stone.  The move, however, is
 reportedly contingent on Zam-
 bia's promise not to accept
 military forces from other
 countries unless the UK agrees.
 Commonwealth Relations Secre-
 tary Bottomley is in Lusaka to
 discuss Kaunda's reservations,
 as well as his request for ad-
 ditional British ground forces.
 The outcome of the talks is
 not known.  RAF units are ap-
 parently on the move to Zambia,
 but negotiations reportedly
 are continuing on the use of
 British Army units.
 The UK has announced it
 will ban imports of Rhodesian
 food, minerals, and metals, in
 addition to its earlier ban on
 tobacco and sugar.  This will
 eliminate over 90 percent of
 UK imports from Rhodesia.
 Stringent new financial con-
 trols forbid nearly all pay-
 ments, including pensions and
 dividends, to all residents of
 Rhodesia.   These new measures
 are unlikely to harm the Rho-
 desian economy appreciably,
 but they do strike directly at
 many white Rhodesians who are
 dependent on this income.
 London is still considering
 selective export controls and
 an oil embargo, but is not con-
 vinced other countries will
 cooperate enough to make these
 measures effective.  London
 also plans soon to dispatch a
 high-level ministerial mission
 to Zambia to discuss economic
 aid in the event of Rhodesian
 countermeasures.
 Kaunda wants British mili-
 tary forces in order to allay
 rising fears of Rhodesian re-
 taliation among the populace and
 to counteract radical African
 pressures for the dispatch of a
 military force under auspices of
 the Organization of African
 Unity.   He apparently still hopes
 to avoid provocative action
 against the Smith regime and to
 allow British economic sanctions
 to take effect.   However, Brit-
 ish  repr3sentatives believe
 that even Kaunda, hitherto the
 mainstay of African moderates,
 fully shares the conviction of
 Zambian militants that Rhodesia
 must not be permitted to retain
 its independence.
 Zambian militants, strongly
 entrenched in the cabinet and
 the ruling political party, ad-
 vocate a total trade boycott
 against Rhodesia, unstinting
 support for paramilitary action
 by Rhodesian African national-
 ists, and allowing Zambia to be-
 come a staging area for OAU mili-
 tary intervention, despite the
 risk of reprisals.   Wilson has
 bluntly reminded Kaunda that no
 available alternative can possibly
 maintain Zambia's copper produc-
 tion if Rhodesia withholds power,
 coal, and rail access.   The mili-
 tants, however, insist that a
 British force in Zambia will
 dieter the Smith regime from

 economic reprisals, and that a
 British-US airlift and other
 emergency measures could somehow
 replace the vital economic links
 with Rhodesia.
 Incidents of sabotage or
 racial friction within Zambia
 could at any time trigger dras-
 tic action by the Kaunda govern-
 ment.    Last week unknown sabo-
 teurs dynamited a main power
 line to the Copperbelt, and a
 street brawl between whites and
 members of the Zambian Youth
 League in  Livingstone sparked a
 wildcat strike by white railway
 workers.
 The apparent UK-Zambia
 deadlock over troops has strength-
 ened the radicals in the OAU who
 insist on the need for sending
 an African force to Zambia.   In
 this atmosphere,  the DAU foreign
 ministers--meeting in extra-
 ordinary session on 3 Iecember

 FINNISH COMMUNIST PARTY UNDER PRESSURE TO LIBERALIZE
 The leadership of the Fin-
 nish Communist Party (FCP)--one
 of the last Stalinist holdouts
 of the West European parties--is
 under continuing pressure from
 liberal and intellectual elements
 to revamp its orthodox Marxism.
 As an initial gesture to
 the liberals and in order to head
 off a showdown at the 14th party
 congress from 29 to 31 January,
 the leadership convened a special
 meeting of the central committee
 in October to consider a resolu-
 tion updating the FCP's position
 on basic ideological issues. The
 need for such a step had become
 apparent as the liberal ferment
 continued unabated and the party
 faced the prospect of entering
 national elections next spring
 or summer divided and in disar-
 The liberals maintained that
 the party must declare publicly
 that it was abandoning violence
 as a means of achieving power.
 They apparently had been greatly
 influenced by the success of the
 "national" Communist parties in
 Denmark and Norway, and the popu-
 larity of the Swedish Communist
 Party under its new, liberal lead-
 ership.
 The "manifesto" which emerged
 from the October meeting, how-
 ever, represented little more than
 a gesture to the liberals.   It
 stopped short of a clear rejec-
 tion of violence, explaining that
 the party "believed" that it could
 achieve power by legal and demo-
 cratic means but could not "guar-
 antee that this will be so in
 real life."   The resolintion went
 on to shelve the term "dictatorship
 of the proletariat" as unsuited
 to Finnish conditions and, in-
 stead, declared the expression
 "labor regime" more appropriate.
 These half-hearted gestures
 are not likely to satisfy the
 liberals, who now may not accept
 anything less than the removal
 of such symbols of Stalinism as
 Chairman Aaltonen and Secretary
 General Pessi.   In their efforts
 to secure more far-reaching re-
 forms, the liberals are undoubt-
 edly encouraged by the evident
 sympathy of some Soviet party of-
 ficials who have hinted that
 changes in the FCP are overdue.
 The congress next month may
 therefore produce a fight that
 could have an important effect
 on the party's fortunes in the
 national elections.    In the
 1962 elections the Communists
 received more than one fifth of
 the popular vote and won al-
 most one fourth of the seats in
 parliament.    A sharp electoral
 setback for the FCP would most
 directly benefit the Social
 Democrats and bring about a ma-
 jor shift on the Finnish politi-
 cal scene.    This would have
 repercussions on Soviet-Finnish
 relations in light of Moscow's
 view that the Social Democratic
 Party continues to be influenced
 by anti-Soviet spokesmen.   Mos-
 cow,   however,   has been careful
 to avoid outright condemnation
 of the party,   evidently be-
 cause of its optimistic election
 prospects.

 British Guiana will receive
 its independence on 26 May 1966.
 Under the name "Guyana," the new
 country will be a constitutional
 monarchy under the British Queen
 until at least January 1969, when
 the National Assembly will prob-
 ably vote to change it to a re-
 public.
 At the independence confer-
 ence in London from 2 to 19 No-
 vember, Premier Burnham and his
 coalition partner, Peter D'Aguiar,
 were able to reach substantial
 agreement on constitutional pro-
 visions.   Nevertheless,  it is un-
 likely that agreements reached
 on paper will enable the two lead-
 ers to forget past differences
 and, overnight, turn themselves
 into a smoothly running team.
 Chances appear to be declin-
 ing that Cheddi Jagan, leader of
 the opposition People's Progres-
 sive Party (PPP), which boycotted
 the constitutional talks, will
 soon rouse his East Indian fol-
 lowers to effective violence
 against the Burnham government.
 Some of the PPP's key activists
 are in prison and others have left
 the party or been expelled for
 antiparty activity.   Although
 riots such as those of last year
 cannot be ruled out, many of the
 East Indians now seem inclined
 to put violent political protest
 aside and get down to the more
 practical business of making a
 living.
 At the conference of active
 OAS members (except Venezuela),
 held in Rio from 17 to 30 Novem-
 ber, the foreign ministers ap-
 proved resolutions calling for
 study of political and economic
 measures to amend the OAS charter
 and strengthen the inter-Ameri-
 can system.
 The resolutions, styled "Act
 of Rio de Janeiro," comprise
 guidelines for a "special prepara-
 tory committee" to meet next
 February in Panama.   This is to
 draft charter amendments for
 consideration by another foreign
 ministers' conference scheduled
 for July in Buenos Aires.   Ap-
 proved amendments would then be
 subject to ratification by the
 individual governments.
 The conference produced rela-
 tively little public dissension.
 The only direct criticism of US
 intervention in the Dominican
 Republic was a Colombian resolu-
 tion, which was side-tracked.
 Disagreement centered on enlarg-

 of peace and the peaceful settle-
 ment of disputes.  The section

 long-standing objection to the
 1942 protocol governing their

 presented.
 The guidelines endorse the
 principle of an annual inter -

 the principles of the Alliance
 for Progress be made a juridically
 binding part of the OAS charter.
 The economic resolutions also
 call for greater cooperation in

 GENERAL STRIKE FAILS IN PANAMA
 Determined action by Presi-
 dent Marco Robles prevented Com-
 munist and opposition elements
 from exploiting a 72-hour general
 strike which began in Panama on
 23 November.
 A union of public employees
 dissatisfied with the government's
 offer of a. $4.5-million wage in-
 crease in the face of their de-
 mands for raises amounting to
 about $20 million, called the
 strike despite lack of popular
 sympathy.   Commercial activity
 was nearly normal in Panama. City,
 although roving bands of students
 and teachers, supporting the
 strike, tried to disrupt traffic
 and force merchants to close down.
 Communist leaders, searching for
 some means of provoking a. govern-
 ment. crisis, had directed the
 student groups to take to the
 streets.
 National Guard units, using
 only tear ga.s and batons, effec-
 tively dispersed the demonstrators
 on 23 and 24 November, arresting
 over 300 in Panama City and Colon.
 Security forces also surrounded
 the University of Panama and a.
 secondary school where relatively
 small bands of armed students
 had barricaded themselves and
 were hurling gasoline -filled bot-
 tles and rocks onto adjacent
 streets.
 Officials had feared that
 former president Arnulfo Arias
 would call on his supporters to
 Join the disorders in order to
 topple the government.   However,
 Arias apparently saw that the     25X1
 strike was foredoomed and merely
 published a manifesto which
 supported its objectives.

 The President's relations

 Divisive issues remain,

 It appears likely that the "po-

 six months of the provisional
 government--will be observed in
 name only.   Joaquin  Balaguer's
 Reformist Party (PR) already has
 launched its well-prepared cam-

 SIGNIFICANCE OF RAUL CASTR O'S VISIT TO USSR
 Raul Castro's recent visit
 to the USSR was a further step
 toward closer Soviet-Cuban rela-
 tions.   The younger Castro's visit,
 which began in early October,  in-
 cluded lengthy conversations with
 top Soviet political and military
 figures,  observation of the Warsaw
 Pact "October Storm" exercise,
 talks with East German and Czech
 officials,  and seating in the
 place of honor at the Soviet Revo-
 lution Day ceremonies.   Castro,
 who is both armed forces minister
 and deputy premier, was accompanied
 by Cuban party and governmental
 personnel as well as military of-
 ficials.
 Although the only formal
 agreement announced covered "eco-
 nomic and technological coopera-
 tion," a wide range of topics un-
 doubtedly was discussed and an ar-
 rangement for continued Soviet
 military aid was probably worked
 out.   An exchange of economic dele-
 gations earlier this year,  lead-
 ing to an agreement in September
 for large  new  aid for the Cuban
 sugar industry, suggests that the
 Castro delegation concentrated on
 military and political subjects.
 Soviet military deliveries
 to Cuba have declined steadil
 since 1962.
 The importance Soviet lead-
 ers attach to Cuba was also high-
 lighted by Foreign Minister
 G:romyko's 19-24 October visit to
 Havana.   The USSR is evidently
 satisfied with the degree to
 which Fidel Castro has moderated
 his policies toward both the US
 and the Latin American continent.
 Soviet leaders have almost
 certainly counseled the Cubans
 to adopt a more flexible ap-
 proach in their relations with
 the US and have urged Castro
 to follow a more cautious policy
 in supporting militant,  insur-
 gent groups in Latin America.
 According to the UK ambassador
 in Havana, Gromyko emphasized
 the necessity for Castro to probe
 those areas where some limited
 agreements with the US might be
 reached.   Moscow probably hopes
 that if Cuba continues to pur-
 sue this course, the US will find
 it increasingly difficult to
 maintain its political and eco-   25X1

 FRICTION AMONG BRAZIL'S LEADERS
 A serious rift seems to be
 developing in Brazil between
 President Castello Branco and
 War Minister Costa e Silva, who
 has long been a mediating influ-
 ence between the President and
 his critics among the military
 25X1   hard-liners.
 The war minister apparently feels
 there is undue interference by
 Magalhaes in military matters.
 Costa e Silva's wife reportedly
 has commented that there no longer
 is mutual confidence between her
 husband and the President.
 Costa e Silva probably is
 irritated by the lack of enthu-
 siasm for his presidential ambi-

 He is known to be interested in
 becoming the candidate of the
 revolution to succeed Castello
 Branco in the 1966 presidential
 election.
 The reports of friction
 among the regime's top leaders
 coincide with increasingly open

 criticism of the President by

 This attitude was highlighted this

 tura Cavalcanti, who has been
 placed under arrest for publish-

 ISRAEL, THE ARAB STATES, AND PALESTINE "LIBERATION" ACTIVITIES
 The frustrations of more than a million Arab
 refugees from Israel are leading to new efforts,
 both peaceful and violent, dedicated to the "liber-
 ation" of Palestine.            Formation of the Palestine
 Liberation Organization is the latest of several
 attempts to provide a political focus for the refu-
 gees, and it has the nominal backing of the Arab
 League.   At the same time, however, two independent
 terrorist groups seem to be trying to trigger inci-
 dents which would bring the Arab states into'mili-
 tary action against Israel.
 Jordanian King Husayn opposes either approach
 to eliminating Israeli rule because his country is
 the Arab state most exposed to any Israeli reprisal
 Moreover,  Jordan includes part of Palestine and is
 the haven for half of the refugees, and Husayn is
 wary of pro-Nasir subversion among Jordan's Pales-
 tinians.                                        Syria,  on the other hand, whose support
 of the terrorism offers greater provocation to the
 Israelis,  enjoys the advantage of being more diffi-
 cult to retaliate against.
 Although Nasir,  like Husayn,  seems anxious to
 avoid any escalation of the sporadic border incidents,
 these Palestine-Arab activities could,  with little
 advance notice,  lead to the largest Arab-Israeli
 clashes since Suez.
 The Refugee Problem
 Israel's victory in its
 1948-49 war of independence left
 more than 700,000 Arabs homeless.
 Two thirds of them encamped in
 the part of Britain's Palestine
 mandate that was later attached
 to the kingdom of Jordan, and
 the remainder were assembled in
 the Egyptian-occupied Gaza strip
 and in Syria and Lebanon.   In 17
 years, with the addition of
 children born in exile, their
 number has grown to 1,280,000,
 according to UN figures.
 While a large majority of
 the refugees still live in camps,
 some have taken jobs elsewhere
 in the Arab states and have been
 at least partially integrated
 into the local life of their
 host countries.   This slow proc-
 ess,   together with the passage
 of time and the lesser resentment
 of younger refugees who have no
 strong attachment to the former
 homes of their parents,  has
 tended to reduce "liberation"
 pressure.   As a matter of princi-
 ple,                                                                           however,  the refugees con-

 mainly from UN relief funds.
 Lacking employment  and frustrated
 by their inability to oust Israel,
 their misfortune is a source of
 constant unrest, and they tend
 to look to any figure of strength
 who offers the greatest promise
 of a return.  Their resentment
 makes many of them susceptible
 to proposals for radical action.
 Through much of the past

 looked to Nasir as their poten-

 The problem for Jordan's
 rulers from the beginning has
 been to maintain control of these
 troublesome people against all

 own. King Abdullah's formal an-
 nexation of the West Bank in
 1950 dramatized his hostility to
 those promoting this Palestine
 nationhood concept.
 Early Palestine Arab Efforts
 The oldest effort to organ-
 ize Palestine Arabs, the "All-
 Palestine Government" of the for-
 mer Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin
 al-Husayni, is moribund from
 neglect.   Formed during the war
 with Israel and located in Gaza,
 it gained recognition from all Arab
 governments other than Jordan.
 Nasir, however, became disil-
 lusioned with this movement and
 ceased supporting it a few years
 ago.   From his present headquar-
 ters in Lebanon Hajj Amin still
 claims to represent all of Pales-
 tine's Arabs, but his once-major
 role has been assumed by others.
 During the next five years
 a succession of new proposals for
 a Palestine "entity" were ad-
 vanced, but got nowhere.   They
 foundered on the rivalries be-
 tween Nasir and other Arab lead-
 ers, especially Iraq's Qasim.
 Husayn adamantly opposed all such
 schemes, but in 1960 felt obliged
 to announce that he would hold a
 plebiscite on Jordan's West Bank
 "if necessary."  He probably be-
 lieved that the majority would
 vote for separation from Jordan,
 and managed to stall on implement-
 ing the offer.
 The PLO
 In the uncommon atmosphere
 of cooperation at the first Arab
 summit meeting in January 1964,
 however, a proposal for a govern-
 rient that omitted any reference
 to the controversial "entity"
 was accepted by Husayn, as well
 as the other heads of govern-
 ment.   Four months later the
 Palestine Liberation Organiza-
 tion (PLO) was formally launched
 at a congress held in Jordanian-
 controlled Jerusalem.   Its con-
 stitution provided for a national
 assembly, an executive committee,
 and an army.   The second Arab
 summit in September 1964 formally
 approved these decisions, and

 Syrian and Saudi UN delegations.
 On the PLO's executive committee,
 which he heads,  Shuqayri has
 brought together representatives
 from various segments of Pales-
 tine society.   A PLO "Voice of
 Palestine" radio station now
 broadcasts daily from Cairo.
 A Palestine Liberation Army
 of 15,000-25,000 troops is en-
 visaged.   About 5,000 are active
 thus far.   Six Egyptian-officered
 Palestinian battalions in Gaza
 make up the bulk of these, and
 the Syrian Army has also made a
 paper transfer of one commando
 battalion to the Palestine force.
 Recruiting and training of addi-
 tional units for the force appar-
 ently have begun in Iraq and Ku-
 wait, as well as in Egypt, Syria,
 and the Gaza strip.
 Shuqayri is seeking to at-
 tract worldwide support.   A PLO
 delegation began a three-month
 promotional tour of Latin America
 in mid-November.   The PLO also
 plans to send representatives to
 Washington,  London, Paris, Mos-
 cow,  Peking,  Belgrade, New Delhi,
 Djakarta, and other capitals.
 So far Communist China has
 shown the most interest in the
 PLO.   Last March Shuqayri led
 a 12-man delegation to Peking
 where the group met Mao Tse-tung
 and Chou En-lai and was offered
 arms aid and training facilities.
 Since the visit,  Peking radio
 has broadcast periodic state-
 ments in support of the cause of
 Palestine "liberation."
 PLO Problems
 The PLO is encountering
 some of the same problems that
 beset previous efforts to gal-
 vanize the Palestinians.   In ad-
 dition, Shugayri's flamboyant
 and aggressive personality has
 antagonized many people. Dis-
 sension within the executive com-
 mittee has resulted in resigna-
 tions which have already brought
 one reorganization.
 Shuqayri has had only
 limited success in supplementing
 the Arab League's subsidy.   He
 says he has secured Iraq's and
 Kuwait's agreement to deduct for
 the PLO 3 to 5 percent from the
 salaries of the many Palestinians
 employed by their governments,
 but there is no confirmation that
 such payments are being made. A
 Shuqayri proposal to raise funds
 for the PLO by imposing a one-
 percent tax on every barrel of
 oil produced in the Arab states
 has not been accepted.
 As with earlier ventures,
 Nasir is the PLO's principal
 patron, apparently because he
 wants to protect his own inter-
 est in any such organization and
 also because he sees it as a po-
 tential instrument for influenc-
 ing politics in Jordan and other
 Arab states.   There are signs
 he is less than enthusiastic
 about Shuqayri's freewheeling
 leadership, and seems to be try-
 ing to secure closer control over
 the PLO.   At the same time Syria's
 ruling Baath party is trying to
 penetrate the PLO to prevent its
 domination by Nasir.   According
 to the Jordanians, the Syrian
 Government has offered Shuqayri
 the use of its radio and press
 facilities to attack Egypt, Jor-
 dan, and any other Arab state
 which is not sufficiently aggres-
 sive on the Palestine question.

 He has not yet taken up this of-
 fer.
 For all its international
 backing and dynamic leadership,
 the PLO does not seem to have
 gained the loyalty of great num-
 bers of the people it purports
 to represent.   The US Embassy in
 Amman reports that the general
 feeling among the Palestinian
 refugees and other West Bank
 Arabs appears to be that the PLO
 is going nowhere and is not
 worthy of serious consideration
 unless it produces better re-
 sults.                       The embassy believes
 that unless Nasir gives it more
 support, it has little chance of
 becoming strong.
 Whatever its inherent
 strength or weakness, the PLO
 provides a major source of irri-
 tation in Jordan.
 Despite his current friend-
 liness with Nasir, King Husayn
 recognizes the potential threat
 to his regime posed by the PLO
 and Nasir's influence in it.   He
 appealed to Nasir to end the PLO
 radio's attacks on him from
 Cairo, and Nasir apparently
 obliged since the propaganda bat-
 tle has subsided.   Husayn has
 refused to permit the recruit-
 mep-t` or formation of separate
 Palestinian units in his coun-
 try, and has also rejected PLO
 requests to station troops in
 Jordan to reinforce border vil-
 lages  against Israeli raids, He
 has noted that Palestinians in
 Jordan serve in the Jordanian
 Army, thus eliminating any need
 to form separate units.   His gov-
 ernment has expressed willing-
 ness only to accept financial
 aid and arms to bolster Jordanian
 defenses.
 Yet Jordan is sensitive to
 Nasir's pressures in the name of
 the PLO.   The recent Jordanian
 decision to form six new infantry
 battalions was made in part to
 resist the PLO's bid to station
 units of its own along the Jor-
 danian-Israeli border.   The raids
 mounted from Jordan by the ter-
 rorist organization "Fatah" this
 year pose a pressing security
 problem for Husayn, who fears
 that Jordanian weakness in the
 face of Israeli reprisals would
 also give substance to the PLO's
 claims that reinforcement is
 necessary.
 The Fatah
 The Fatah--an Arabic acronym
 for "Palestine liberation move-
 ment"--apparently was formed as
 early as 1958 by Palestinians who
 had become disgusted and discour-
 aged with the inaction of Arab
 governments on behalf of the
 Palestinian cause.   It is small,
 and tightly organized into cells,
 with headquarters variously re-
 ported as being in Damascus,
 Beirut, and Kuwait.   The organi-
 zation's paramilitary arm--called
 "Asifah," meaning "storm"--re-
 cruits its members from among a
 few hundred professional infil-
 trators and smugglers who have
 operated across Israel's borders
 for many years.   Some formerly
 served Egypt as fedayeen com-
 mandos before the Sinai war of
 1956.

 Most of Fatah's financial
 support comes from wealthy Pales-
 tinians now living in Kuwait and
 Saudi Arabia.   A Fatah delegation
 was scheduled to leave for Latin
 America in late November to seek
 funds from the sizable Arab
 emigre communities there.   Local
 governmental support has come
 principally from Syria, which
 provides training facilities and
 a propaganda outlet.   Fatah re-
 portedly has had some contacts
 with the Chinese Communists, who
 offered training in guerrilla
 warfare.
 Fatah's sabotage activities
 began only last January.   The
 Israelis claim it has been re-
 sponsible for about forty raids
 into Israel, mainly involving
 sabotage of buildings, water-
 works, and irrigation facilities.
 Some of these missions have re-
 sulted in severe injuries to Is-
 raelis but as yet apparently no
 fatalities have occurred.
 Almost all have been
 launched from Jordanian terri-
 tory; the remainder have origi-
 nated in Lebanon.   Fatah's objec-
 tive may be to force an Arab show-
 down with Israel by provoking
 Israeli retaliation.
 The Israelis know that
 neither the Jordanian nor Leb-
 anese government approves of
 these raids, and that neither
 wants any trouble with Israel.
 The Eshkol government, however,
 is critical of their failure to
 stop the raids and contends that
 border inhabitants of those coun-
 tries have cooperated with the
 terrorists.   Twice Israel struck
 back against suspected terror-
 ist bases in Jordan--on 28-29 May
 and 5 September--and once against
 a base in Lebanon--on 29 October
 --to give emphasis to its view.
 In recent weeks reports
 have been received about the
 formation of another organiza-
 tion which intends to conduct
 sabotage raids into Israel.
 Called the "Palestine Libera-
 tion Front," it appears to be
 based in Syria like Fatah but
 allegedly does not have the sup-
 port of either the Syrian Gov-
 ernment or the Baath Party.
 This group, too, is said to be
 disappointed in the reluctance
 of Arab governments to take
 meaningful action against Is-
 rael, but it also is critical
 of what it considers Fatah's
 ineptness and mere "noise making."
 Fatah's Implications
 For the moment, however,
 Fatah is the group that is worry-
 ing Nasir as well as Husayn for
 its troublemaking potential. The
 Nasir-backed PLO initially op-
 posed the Fatah's raids for this
 reason.   More recently, however,
 the two organizations report-
 edly have arranged contact in
 order to take cooperative action.
 Nasir is said to have encouraged

 these contacts.   He probably
 wants to achieve some influence
 over Fatah in order to keep it
 from creating a situation which
 might draw Egypt into a confronta-
 tion with Israel.
 Further Israeli reprisals
 against Fatah bases in Jordan
 might at any time cause Husayn
 to take drastic action to under-
 cut charges of weakness against
 Israel.   He might be goaded into
 striking back across the border,
 despite the inherent dangers in
 such a move.   On the other hand
 suppression of the terrorists
 could prompt them to turn against
 his regime, and attempt to as-
 sassinate Jordanian leaders.
 (Husayn's grandfather fell to a
 Palestinian assassin's bullet
 14 years ago.)   Lebanon faces
 similar problems on a lesser scale.
 SECRET
 Israel, too, may feel im-
 pelled to take more drastic ac-
 tion if the new Liberation Front
 begins operations and Fatah con-
 tinues its raids.   This could in-
 volve a strike against more
 heavily defended Syria despite
 the remoteness from the border
 of suspected Fatah training cen-
 ters.   Some Israeli press com-
 ment has suggested such a step.
 In contrast to the rela-
 tively open Lebanese and Jor-
 danian frontiers, the short
 Syrian border and the rough ter-
 rain favors the Arab defenders.
 Any Israeli reprisal operation
 into Syria would therefore have
 to be larger in scope than those  25X1
 against Jordan and Lebanon, with
 correspondingly greater danger
 of touching off a broader con-
 flict.
