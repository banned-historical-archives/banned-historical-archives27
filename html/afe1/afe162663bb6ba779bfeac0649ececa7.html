25X6A 
Despite recent purges, the Korean National Assembly has demonstrated 
its continued independence by overriding a Rhee veto (p. 3). 
Moderation appears to have been the theme in activities surrounding 
the establishment of the "Peoples' Repoblic of China" (p. 3). Meanwhile, 
a Communist-dictated solution to the differences between the rebel Ili group 
and the am-Nationalists in remote Sinkiang can be expected (p. 4)p and the 
Nationalist blockade of Shanghai, while causing mass unemployment, has not 
disrupted life in that city as much as might be expected (p. 5). 
In Burma, the Government has announced liberal plans for industrializa-
tion which may serve to entice foreign capital and the leader of the Karma 
has indicated the peace terms his people are willing to accept (p. 7). 
Premier Matta, chief Indonesian Republican negotiator at The Hague 
is, under attack by Indonesians at home and abroad for being too conciliatory 
towards the Dutch (p. 8). 
Philippine constabulary and Manila police have raided one of the 
city's toughest districts, following reports of Huk infiltration (p. B).

SaCTION 11. DEVELOPMENTS IN SPECIFIED AREAS 
Cold shoulder_fromOATT--A further US attempt to assist Japan's resumption 
a-raiinationirresponsibilities has failed. The GATT (General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade) 4orking Party, meeting in London in late September, 
while extending an invitation to aestern Germany and the Republic of Korea 
to enter into the 1950 tariff negotiations, reached a majority decision not 
to send a similar invitation to Japan. 
4hi1e the intransigence of various coantries in postponing Japan's 
reentry into international affairs ostensibly stems from dread of Japanese 
commercial competition and military resurgence, it may well be that those 
GATT representatives whose governments also sit on the Far Eastern Commission 
feel that only this sort of veto power can be exercised over the nearly 
unilateral Occupation in Japan.

PAL0 Presidential veto on the Law on the Organization of the Courts. Rhea's 
etand that the Constitation gave him the power to appoint the Chief Justice

3f the new Government is CHOU En-lai, who served as chief Communist 
negotiator duriag the Marshall mediation mission, and who is generally 
regarded as the most nearly 'pro-Oestern' CCP leader. 
roderate "New Democracy" propaganda extends even to the design of 
the national flag - red with a large yellow star at the upper left (repre-
venting the Communist Party), flanked by a row of four smaller yellow 
stars, (representing the four "friendly" classes of. people - farmers, 
workers, petty bourgeoisie, and "national capitalists"). This action 
iends further weight to LIU Shao-chi's "minimum program" speech, in which 
er'0, a leading extremist, waa chosen to announce MAO 's policy of gradeal-
iem in achieving the ultimate "socialist" aims of the Chinese Communist 
Party. In the 'field of foreign relations, as well, policy statements were 
notably moderate. Denunciation of United States "imperialism" was 00141-
earatively restrained, and the desire for establishment of diplomatic rela-
tions with all countries on a basis of "eqeelity and mutual respect" was 
reiterated. Especially close friendship with the Soviet Union was, however, 
announced as a cardinal policy of the new Government. 
The formal establishment of the Peoples' Republic of China does 
nothing to alter the basic political realities in China. Within the frame-
work of a 4coa1itionrof political groups and a proliferating administrative 
structure, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party will con-
tinue to wield ultimate authority in the areas over which it has won control 
through military conquest and political negotiation. In the international 
field, however, the claims of the new Government, already recognized by 
the Soviet Union and various Eastern European satellites, to the National-
Intel position in the United Nations, will create immediate and concrete 
problems. 
Sinkiang's future?With the recent capitulation of the Nationalist-held 
portion of remote Sinkiang, which for the past five years has been a 
divided province, 'with its three richest zones controlled by the Soviet-
dominated rebel Ili regime, it IX possible to forecast the probable course 
of future events there. 
19811 - 
Until recently, the rebel Ili Group, which stands for native self-
eovernment and against Chinese control, has shown no interest in the XMT-CCP 
conflict in China proper. During the peat summer, however, Ili propaganda 
organs began to champion the Communist cause in China, and, in mid-September, 
a delegation, headed by SETFUDDIN of the Ili Group, arrived in Peiping for 
the CPPC meetings, during the course of which the III Group firmly aligned 
itself with the victorious Communists.

Ir the Nettonalist psrt of the province, meanwhile, the withdrawal 
-J. NA el-faegss 5th Cavalry Army, following the Moalem collapse in Kansu? 
left the area virtually undefended. Various native anti-Ili Group and 
aeei-CCP leaders, who had supported the Nationalist regime, made plans for 
immediate flight. General TAO Shih-yueh, commander of the province's 
Neelenalist forces, LIU eene-chun, Sinkiang Secretary-General, and CRU ea, 
Mseor of Tihwa, all followers of General CHANG Chih-chung who joined the 
Chinese Commnnists in April, were able, once la's Army withdrew, to declare 
their allegiance to the Peiping regime (see deekly Highlights #69). 
Thus, with the Ili rebels committed to the support of the CCP0and 
4118 Tihwa Uationalists nturned over", it remains for the CCP to settle the 
dispute between the two. The CCP can be expected to award a dominant role 
le the new provincial Government to the vigorous Ili Group, possibly through 
a "coalition" structure -which will include some of the surrendering Tihwa 
offieials. ehile such a Sinkiang Provincial Government would be nominally 
subject to the Chinese COMMUni3t Central Government, it would actually 
exercise a high degree of autonomy, would be strongly Soviet-influenced, 
end would give high priority to Soviet interests. One of the first measures 
to be expected of such an Ili-dominated Government would be conclusion of 
the long-delayed "trade agreement with the USSR which has been under nego-
tiation between the Soviet and the Chinese Nationalists for some time. 
afects of the Shanehai blockade--Communist authorities in Shanghai have ten 
proved themselves fairly efficient in meeting the economic problems arising 
Srom the eationalist blockade. Although the lack of such imports as cotton 
and oil has cut deeply into industrial output and caused widespread unem-
ployment, the Communists have attained some measure of success thus far in 
maintaining the flow of domestic supplies into the city. The present 
situation in several sectors of the Shanghai economy is outlined below: 
a. Food--Thusfar, the Communists have demostrated an ability to feed 
Shanghai without foreign food imports. In large part, the Communists have 
been aided by the feet that crops are now being harvested and moving to 
market. The prospects for next year are considerably less favorable, due 
to crop damage from typhoons and floods, which will cause serious shortages 
unless foreign supplies can be imported. 
h. Fuel--Tho shortage of petroleum imports has forced the conversion 
of many facilitiee to coal. Deterred from coastwise shipments of coal by 
the blockade, the Communists have succeeded in transporting the cityle 
present requirements by rail and inland waterway. Since the Communist take-
over, coal shipments into Shanghai have averaged close to 100,000 tons 
moethly - ample for the present low level of industrial requirements.

SECRET 
Serious winter shortages for private consumers are anticipated, however, 
if the blockade continues. 
c. Cottone-The lack of cotton imports has hurt Shanghai's Rost. 
imnortant industry-- textiles. At present, cotton mills are operating at 
less than one third capacity, with resultant hardship to about a million 
persons directly dependent on cotton mill operations. Although the cotton 
eiteation is expected to improve with the arrival of new domestic craps 
tnie month, the mills will probably run short again next spring unless 
170reign importatioer are resumed. 
d. Srlduqtat-Industries generally are operating at about one third 
e.m: normal levels, eith raw material stocks being steadily depleted. Current 
nandicspeto production result from sagging buying power in Shanghai and the 
interior, lack of adequate transport for commercial shipments because of 
military priorities, unavailability of Southeast Asian, American, and 
European export outlets, and high labor costs. 
C. ShIpplpge-The bulk of the Chinese ocean-going fleet escaped cap-
ture when the Communists took Shanghai.. The Communists are thus very much 
dependent on foreigneflag vessels to move cargoes into Shanehai. For the 
present, however, almost all ocean shipping into the city has ceased.. While 
few ships have successfully ran the blockade, the visible economic effects 
have been Infinitesimal. 
f. Railweyse-The Communists are making vigorous efforts to counter 
the blockade by increased use of railway facilitiee. Their measures in this 
regard, however, are being hampered by Nationalist strafing and bombing 
attacks on rolling stock, bridges and repair depots. Trains around Shang-
hai and Nanking are forced to operate at night only. 
g. Labor?Since the Communist takeover, trade union membership in 
Shallots/ has increased and the number of local unions has doubled. The most 
troublesome labor problem resulting from the blockade arose when foreign 
Arms, attempting to liquidate or to make staff reductions, were confronted 
with exorbitant termination pee, demands. Although the Communists have 
recently published regulations setting a maximum of three-months' severance 
pay, the regulations have been ignored in the settling of many cases. 
h. Priceo--Although prices increased several-fold in the first six 
weeks of the Communist occupation, the inflationary spiral has, for the time 
being at least, been halted. Current crop harvests, as well as decreased 
purchasing power resulting from lowered industrial activity, constitute de-
flationary forces. Food shortages next spring may bring a resumption of 
price increases.

b4MA. 
industrialization plan announced?A new industrialization policy, presented 
by Prime Minister Thakin Nu to the Burmese Parliament contains significant 
proposals concerning private and foreign enterprise. All present and future 
industrial enterprises in Burma were assigned tows of three categories: 
(1) those completely Government-controlled, such as the development of 
atomic energy (sic) and the manufacture of munitions; (2) those operated 
either privately or in partnership with the Government until the Govern-
nent is capable of aesaming control, such as public utilities and transper-
tation, and (3) all other, which are open to anlimited private ownernhip. 
eoides being permitted to remit money from Burma for capital renewal and 
dividends, foreign firms will be guaranteed against nationalization during 
a fixed period, determined through negotiations with the Government. The 
reaeonable conditions imposed provide for Governmental selection of those 
endertakings to be permitted entry into Burma. Such undertakinge must be 
the sort that will provide foreign exchange as a result of operatione and 
the industries must train Burmans for administrative and technical postions. 
All things considered, the plan offers a constructive and realistic approach 
to Burma's long-term economic problems and should serve to attract foreign 
capital to Burma once the present problem of restoring law and order is 
solved. 
PiBt1 
Karen peace terms?In a recent interview, saw Ba U Gyi, leader of the Karen "B" 
rebellion, stated that an independent Karen State was an accomplished fact 
and would remein so. He indicated: however, that the Karens were still 
amenable to peace with the Burmese Government and would be "glad" to remain 
in the Union of Burma as a self-governing state, Ba U Gyi reiterated the 
Keren argument that they 'were fighting for survival, not for partition, and 
specified the following conditions for a settlement: (1) the Burmese Govern-
ment would not speak in terms of "surrender", (2) the Karens must be permitted 
to retain their arms, (3) the Burmese Government should recognize an auto-
nomous Karen State, and (4) the Karene should be guaranteed the right to 
secede from the Union at their discretion. Significantly, Ba U Gyi added 
that any settlement would have to be ratified by the other hill peoples of 
burma (the Shane, Chins and Kachins), thus indicating that there has, in 
fact, been some liaison between these peoples regarding common aspirations 
and action. 
Such terms have been unacceptable to the Government in the past, and 
probably will continue to be so, even though a settlement of the Karen 
problem would constitute a long step towards a restoration of stable condi-
tions in Burma.

been reported to disagree with Hatta's policy at The Hague, while Paler, 
the Republican representative to the UN Security Council, who has recently 
arrived at The Hague, has joined the attacks on Hatta's position. 
This development means that President Sukarno is faced with the urgent 
problem of reconcilihg dissatisfied party leaders and convincing the people 
that Hatta's negotiations have not in fact compromised Indonesia's sover-
eignty, If he fails, lack of popular support in Indonesia at this juncture 
could fatally weaken the Republican delegation at The Hague. Should the 
Dutch then demand more comprehensive safeguards from a weakened Republican 
delegations the likelihood of reaching an effective agreement of any sort 
eould be slight. Even it this developaent is avoided, continued indigenous 
opposition to Premier Hatta will ahdermine the strength of the Repablican 
Government at a time when it will be facing many grave problems.

Manila police launch Mak drive?Following reports of the presence in Manila 
ee Luiserarac and other Hmk leaders, local police--in cooperation with the 
Philippine Constabulary?launched a raid on one of the city's toughest 
districts early Suaday morning, 2 October, which netted 64 suspects. Most 
of the persons arrested were subsequently released, but the eanila police 
announced that the search for seven link leaders?who are reported to be 
organizing "planned sabotage" in Manila during the elections?will continue. 
Adverse reaction to the raid was immediate. Both Laurel's Nationalista 
and Avelino's Liberal Party headquarters denounced the move as "fascistic". 
Mariano Halgos, Communist Party secretary-general and officer of the mili-
tant Congress of Labor Organizations, has advocated a general strike in 
protest. The administration, however, probably mill continuo to push its 
investigation of subversive activities not only in Manila but throughout 
the Philippines. Adainistration motives are, first, to counter opposition 
charges that it is ineompotent to maintain law and order, and, second, to 
discredit Laurel, whoso Communist supporters, according to the Quirino 
administration, are plotting the overthrow of the Government,

ii0Tk: Following are extracts from the Summary of OIR's Report en-
tieled uProblems of Oomestic and Foreign Policy Confronting the Chinese 
_emaeniete." 
ere probable combination of internal and external circumstances justi-
':iee en exeectation that the new Chinese Commanist regime will be over-
eeeoen within the next five years. The CCP, in all probability, will con-
eieea eo consolidate its political power. 
Because Communist doctrine, as now applied to China, sanctions greater 
flexibility in domestic than in foreign policies, the initial CCP response 
to adveree developments may be expected to take the form of adjusting domes-
tic programs rather than international alignments. No early change in the 
atrongly pro-Soviet orientation of the CCP is to be anticipated. 
The CCP must construct a new political system which will elicit the 
eaeport of key social groups and neutralize the ever-present tendency to-
ward regionalization of poLitioal interests, while still. maintaining Party 
authority in policy matters; effect a radical reorganization of the etructure 
clf production, while at the same time striving to raise production from its 
current inadequate levels; enlist the cooperation of the peaeantry, urban 
labor, and the middle class, while restricting consumption in the interest 
of maximizing -investment, and expand foreign trade in the face of an ideologi-
cal compulsion to resist foreign "imperialism.' 
Tne most likely manner it which ideology might operate to defeat the 
CCP's program is through inducing a premature application of extreme measures 
of social change. 
The CCP's need to realize the maximum possible return from foreign trade 
nay lead Party leaders to seek close economic relations with non-Communist 
nations. Should these relations be minimized by inept Soviet intervention, 
the CUP would be seriously handicapped in its attempts at economic rsoonstru.o--
tion. Concerted application of restrictions on trade with Communist China 
-by the major astern powers would produce similar restate. 
The CCP would suffer severely from an attempt by the USSR to exploit 
Manchuria. By absorbing Manchuria's export surplus at less than world market 
prices, or by demanding extortionate returns from Soviet holdings and rights 
in the area, the USSR would sharply reduce the volome of domestic resources 
availabie for investment especially those resoacee readily exchangeable for 
fereign imports..

A rational survey of the conflicts and identities of interest be-
tween China and the US, and between China and the USSR, would indicate a 
gore nearly neutral Chinese Communist position in the "cold war' than now 
obtains. However, ideology, perhaps reinforced by a fear of "imperial-
inti o aggressionln at present appears to be the dominant force in the formu-
lation of Chinese Communist foreign policy.
