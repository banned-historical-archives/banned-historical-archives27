 PREFACE
 Whether nationalist or Marxist in ideology, many present day sub-
 versives have opted for urban-oriented violence.  They have largely
 rejected the rural-based guerrilla tactics advocated by Mao Tse-tung,
 Ho Chi Minh, and Ernesto "Che" Guevara, among other insurgent theoreticians.
 The change to.an urban focus is attributable to a combination of
 factors to include (1) accelerated urbanization; (2) massive discontent
 among students, intellectuals, labor, minorities, and impoverished ghetto
 residents; (3) non-adaptability of guerrilla tactics for largely passive
 rural populations; (4) conspicuous failure of recent rural-oriented sub-
 version; and (5) significant success achieved by urban terrorist groups.
 Thus, kidnapping, hijacking, assassination, bombing, riots, strikes,
 and other forms of urban violence will probably continue to be familiar
 hazards of life in the 1970's.  The sponsors of such acts are essentially
 political partisans.  Success or failure depends on the partisan's ability
 to.induce a "climate of collapse" which stimulates the defeat or overthrow
 of a target regime.  Such a climate is created by the effective use of
 violence designed to gain control of men's minds, erode moral consensus,
 harden political battle lines, and stimulate radical right-wing response.
 This violent battle of psychological manipulation has appeared
 in Montevideo, Guatemala City, Sao Paulo, New Delhi, Calcutta, Saigon,
 Belfast, Montreal and other cities.  Urban violence has also occurred
 _ iin the United States, but its scope and influ-
 ence Is far greater in.the less developed nations.
 Given the expanded threat, it is the purpose of this study to
 explore the various forms of violence and recommend adequate control
 systems.

 URBAN ENVIRONMENT
 Most urban centers generally afford a "hot bed" for political
 dissidence.  The growth media&+"e the various discontented population
 elements to include (1) idealistic students and intellectuals frus-
 trated by the status quo; (2) underpaid and underemployed labor antagonized
 by corporate exploitation; (3) religious, ethnic, class, or social groups
 who suffer from inferiority complexes; (4) unemployed slum dwellers out-
 raged by their inability to achieve even marginal subsistence within the
 existing social-political-economic systems; and (5) other groups who
 sense some relative deprivation.
 If any combination of the above circumstances exist, violence only
 awaits the addition of leadership, organization, agitation, propaganda,
 support, and development of a "cause".  All of these factors can be
 provided by a small-clandestine cadre dedicated to defeat or overthrow of
 the existing target government.
 These cadre can readily recruit action agents from among dissident
 population elements.  Funds are often obtained via kidnappings, bank
 robberies, extortion, or other similar actions.  Food and other basic
 supplies can be purchased or stolen as needed.  Medical supplies and
 services are generally available from hospitals, pharmacies, universities,
 and medical students.  Chemicals, explosives, arms and ammunition may be
 purchased openly or on the Black Market.  Failing this, these items can
 be stolen from manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers or depots such as
 armories. Intelligence on government forces may be obtained via human
 or technical penetration operations, bribery, communications intercept,
 and simple theft of documents.
 Target acquisition is a relatively simple process since most
 urban areas contain government facilities or installations, official
 or diplomatic personnel, foreign embassies, business firms, etc.
 Meeting places can be located in residences, offices, factories, parks,
 public facilities, or any other location where small groupings of
 personnel can gather with some degree of secrecy.  Likewise, safe sites
 and "drops" are also readily available in similar locations. Mobility
 options include movement by foot, private or stolen vehicles, and
 public transport.  Route selection is relatively simple given the quantity
 of streets, alleys, and walkways.  Cover and concealment is achieved by
 blending with metropolitan population masses which accept "casual" contact

 with strangers and generally ignore unusual activity undertaken by any
 individual.  Communication techniques include use of telephone, tele-
 graph, mails, couriers and radios with appropriate utilization of simple
 word or phrase codes to provide security.  Terrain advantage can be
 gained by using tops of buildings.  Underground structures such as base-
 ments, subways and sewer lines may also be used to facilitate movement
 or concealment.
 In brief, a metropolitan area affords the total gamut of resources
 (men, money, material and intelligence) needed for the conduct of violence
 operations.  The only remaining ingredient is the development of sub-
 versive tactics, strategy and organization.
 OPPOSITION TACTICS
 In terms of tactics, urban violence is similar to rural-oriented
 guerrilla warfare.  From the communist point of view, the former is
 basically an extension of guerrilla principles to a metropolitan setting.
 However, the rural-based operatives have a much greater capability to
 maneuver using isolated or controlled "sanctuaries" to facilitate the
 conduct of extensive paramilitary warfare tactics.  The urban insurgents
 are confined to a potentially hostile environment.   This necessarily
 limits their efforts to small-scale clandestine acts of violence which
 will avoid direct sustained confrontation with superior security forces.
 An urban and/or rural-based subversive effort may be simultaneous
 but separate, mutually supporting or limited to a singular approach.
 Primary doctrinal emphasis has been on rural-oriented guerrilla warfare.
 It is for this reason that communist urban violence doctrine is not
 particularly well developed.  However, even if detailed concepts existed,
 there would be great variation of form since approaches will vary
 according to the social, economic, political, psychological and security
 factors relating to a specific urban environment.  The primary communist
 input (from Moscow, Peking, Havana or elsewhere) is the offer of sympathy,
 training and limited support to dissidents who are the potential or
 existing cadre for a subversive movement.                         %
 Creation of various national cadre elements can result from
 recruitment programs conducted by external and/or internal forces of
 subversion, or the necessary leadership may arise from internal conflicts

 causing the aggravated "elite" citizen to seeks ways and means to over-
 throw his government.                     In either case, communist models of revolution
 are usually duplicated because they offer the most prevalent example of
 a proven means for dramatically and forcibly altering conditions per-
 ceived as being intolerable.
 Once the leader elements are created, the process of clandestine
 organization may be initiated.  The basic principle is that personnel,
 mechanisms, modus operandi, ideology and goals of subversion must necessarily
 remain secret to survive repressive government reaction or to maintain deception.
 Further, experience has proven that personnel can most effectively and
 safely function in small specialized clandestine "cells  each compartmented.
 from the other.  Types of cells include cadre, agitators, saboteurs,
 terrorists, informants and agents, propagandists, political activists,
 psychological and action elements, communication nets, support assets,
 "front" or population organizers, and other functional units contributing
 to the conduct of subversion.  Sources of recruits are as indicated in the
 previous section.
 The existence of elite direction and effective clandestine organi-
 zation     facilitates the implementation of propaganda, agitation, and
 action programs designed to erode popular confidence in the target regime.
 These efforts combine grievance, exploitation and fear inducing terror
 designed to cause a target population to ignore, condone or support sub-
 versive activities.  Approaches include (1) the "carrot" which promises
 to somehow eliminate all those conditions the target populace conceives
 as being intolerable, and (2) the "stick" which threatens to punish
 government supporters and all those who resist the forces of subversion.
 Both techniques are designed to allow a small activist force to gain
 positive or negative psychological control over a population majority.
 Once this situation is achieved, it is assumed that subversive elements
 will have sufficient power to force the collapse, defeat, or overthrow of a
 target government.  Failing the achievement of these primary methods,
 a subversive force may attempt coups, palace revolutions, election engineering
 or induced social-economic-political "collapse" to accomplish an expedient
 victory.
 Examples of urban guerrilla tactics include (1) terrorism or the
 systematic use of intimidation for political ends;
 to disrupt socio-economic development and impede government's gability nto
 meet the population's "felt needs"; (3) propaganda and agitation oriented
 toward creating a "crisis of confidence" regarding government's intent or
 ability to resolve major problems; (4) armed violence intended to expose

 the weakness of government security forces; (5) kidnapping operations to
 free political prisoners, extract concessions, capture publicity and provoke
 controversy; (6) demonstrations, strikes, and riots to exploit popular
 grievances or establish a mutuality of "cause" between subversives and
 dissident population elements; and (7) infiltration and selective assassi-
 nation designed to neutralize the effective functioning of security forces
 or other government agencies.
 Despite the multiplicity of tactical options, the perpetrators of
 contemporary urban-oriented subversion have frequently failed to mobilize
 popular support.  This failure is due largely to the inability of sub-
 versive elements to convince potential supporters that there are no
 prospects for constitutional change or non-violent reform.  Future doc-
 trine on urban violence techniques may therefore concentrate on better
 tactics to erode public confidence in any governmental system.  Possible
 conceptual solutions include a massive breakdown of internal security,
 economic chaos, and a polarization of political forces around-the "law
 and order" issue.  Ideally, this approach would also cause'target govern-
 ments'to implement repressive measures which would help convince the
 population that non-violent change is impossible.
 Urban violence tactics and strategy arethus in an evolutionary
 process which has yet to produce the ultimate conceptual or doctrinal
 approach.  Unfortunately, as various-revolutionaries learn by trial and
 error, previous weaknesses will be noted and appropriate corrective action
 taken.                                                .,
 Despite the fluid status of urban-oriented.xpvolutionary doctrine,
 essential working principles should remain the same as those discussed
 herein.  Given the valjdity of this assumption, we will attempt to out-
 line appropriate urban violence control systems in the next section.
 NOTE:  Reference materials will include a listing of contemporary urban
 guerrilla doctrine for individual officers who may be concerned with a
 more detailed tactical or strategic analysis.
 CONTROL SYSTEMS
 Psychological and Political
 Attitudes of the target population must be manipulated to create
 favorable impressions regarding government and unfavorable opinions of

 the urban guerrillas.  In the battle for men's minds, essential actions
 should include (1) development of programs designed to meet "felt needs"
 and resolve conditions perceived as being intolerable by various popula-
 tion elements; (2) upgrading of security force capabilities to provide
 population protection and freedom from fear; (3) effective utilization
 of "law and due process" to convince the populace that government will
 defeat the subversives without utilizing repressive measures; and (4)
 creation of institutional and governmental mechanisms that provide the
 means for effective "change" without violence.
 The developmental or modernization approach usually requires human,
 technological and capital inputs at a rate which will provide substantial
 agricultural and/or industrial growth.  This is a long-term and complex
 solution which cannot be achieved easily without adequate savings,trade,
 aid, or credit.  In addition to the above inputs, markets must be developed;
 producer incentives created; income and employment levels increased;
 educational programs expanded; birth rates reduced to something less than
 Gross National Product increases; and skilled manpower, energy sources,
 raw materials, machinery or other capital items must be assembled at the
 production point.  Apart from these overall development efforts, dissident
 Wi. overished population elements should be provided with basic minimal
 e"
 5~
 e-e
 plus the opportunity Tor socio-economic self-advancement.
 Security improvement programs should be based upon legislative
 actions which provide the police and other internal defense forces with
 appropriate increases in leadership, manpower, training, finance, commu-
 nications, mobility, weapons, equipment and material.  Essential tactical
 innovations will be discussed under the sections or 'terrorism, sabotage,
 riots, etc.  The fundamental basis for improving security operations is
 via better intelligence collection and collation.  Human/technical pene-
 trations, agent or informant operations, prisoner interrogation, communications
 intercept, and investigative techniques all provide essential information
 inputs.  Effective collation of this data should result eventually. in the
 identification of subversive leadership, cadre, action and suooort elements ,-ideoloc
 modus operandi, organizational patterns, strength, capability, plans or
 intentions, facilities, mechanisms, and other details.  In turn, the
 finished intelligence product is used to provide targets or operational
 leads and as legal evidence for judicial processing of subversives.
 Regarding "law and due process", it is essential that judicial pro-
 cedures be established to assure that violence control measures are
 politically, legally and morally justifiable.  This is particularly true
 of methods used to arrest, detain, interrogate, convict and imprison or
 execute individual members of a subversive movement.  If repressive, brutal,
 or illegal tactics are used by the government to attack subversive forces,
 popular sentiment may favor  success of the latter.

 Creation of adaptive and responsible institutions provide government
 with its most effective psychological weapon against violence.  Assuming
 such organizations provide the basis for peaceful constructive change,
 the perpetrators of violence cannot  justify their methods to a target
 populace.  In fact, history has proven that the urban guerrilla cannot
 long survive in an environment where popular political, economic, or
 social aspirations can be achieved by non-violent methods.
 Subversion and social unrest thrives on the inability of a nation
 to modernize existing private or governmental institutions in a manner
 which will facilitate the effective, peaceful resolution of intolerable
 conditions,  It is therefore essential that government assure that there
 is an adaptive organizational basis for reform, modernization and progres-
 sive change.  This process must include government bureaucracy, political
 parties, unions, cooperatives, youth groups, and other private institutions.
 Past experience has shown that governments or societies least vul-
 nerable to subversion are those at the political extremes, to include
 (1) the most permissive and pluralistic because they are best able to
 remove the causes of revolt; and (2) the most repressive and totalitarian
 because they are best able to supress the first stirrings of revolt.
 Since the U.S. must necessarily reject the latter, we have attempted to
 outline effective approaches to the former, as indcated above;
 Terrorist
 0 fensive terror tactics involve the use of.discriminate or indis-
 criminate v o ence designed to aid the subversive overthrow of a target
 government, or to expand the influence of terrorist sponsors.  By exten-
 sive use of assassination and bombing, the terrorists' primary objective
 is to__cow a target population and create a crisis of confidence in
 government.  As a result, the terrorists hope to isolate the population
 from target government influence for the purpose of control, or to erode
 socio-economic development and the effective employment of security forces.
 In addition, terrorist action may be undertaken to expand the potential
 source of intelligence, recruitment, sympathy or support.
 The strategic intent of offensive terror is oriented toward stimu-
 lating massive population agitation over goverments seeming inability to
 Drovide freedom from fear and developmental progress designed to meet
 felt needs.--  As previously noted, additional purposes are to erode moral
 consensus, harden political battle lines, and stimulate radical right-wing
 response.  Terror is thus primarily political in nature and normally a

 tactic of subversive or criminal elements who seek viability and power by
 creating an antagonistic barrier between a population and its government.
 To be effective, the terrorist is dependent upon clandestine organi-
 zation, leadership, target intelligence, ideology, tactical mobility,
 technical skills, cover and concealment, plus a neutral target population.
 However, an exception to this latter requirement must be made for inter-
 national terrorists who operate from "base areas" outside the target nation.
 A current example is provided by Arab terrorist organizations operating
 against Israel.
 Although the objectives of international terrorists usually conform
 to the norm, they may have the additional goal of influencing other nations
 not to support a particular government against which they are targetted.
 It is a kind of influencing subversion designed to erode! the political,
 economic and defensive strength of any country the terrorists are attempting
 to destroy.
 Defensive terror is the employment of violence against the offensi
 ve
 errorists.  This may be overtly or covertly undertaken by a target
 government, or it may be employed by independent groups who are in oppo-
 sition to terrorist forces and objectives.  The key to defensive terror
 is intelligence collection and collation for the purpose of identifying
 the principal personalities and action elements of a terrorist movement.
 Overt, covert or semi-covert operations may then be mounted to eliminate
 violently terrorist cadre, functionaries. and supporting imechanisms.
 The fundamental problem with this approach_ is that terror begets more

 9              government
 because of this consequence.  Even if government is not the overt or
 covert sponsor of defensive terror, suspicion and accusation will
 eventually lead to an official image of brutal repression which does
 not enhance the legal government's chances for survival.
 Counterterror is often mistaken for defensive terror to which it
 is only remotely related.  The technique of counterterror employs
 intelligence to identify terrorists who are then neutralized by
 organized controlled government forces within accepted parameters of
 Justice within the law.  The basic ingredientsfbr an effective counter-
 terror program are as follows:

 close scrutiny as potential participants in acts of violence.  This approach
 facilitates narrowing the focus of investigative and intelligence operations
 designed to identify members of terrorist organizations.    Further, the pro-
 file improves routine observation by police and other authorities responsible
 for internal security.
 An example profile of a potential terrorist might indicate
 `basic characteristics to include (1)  male or female age 16 to 58; (2)
 'member of potentially dissident group; (3) person with emotional or
 fanatical tendency; (4) individual who has evidenced violent behavior or
 emotional instability; (5) citizens who are isolated from the national
 socio-economic or political "mainstream"; (6) radicals who have engaged   j
 in demands for revolutionary change; and (7) individuals who obviously
 have nothing to lose by engaging in terrorism.
 Potential terrorist traits should be evaluated in accordance
 with each particular local or national environment.  The main objective
 being to create a system that is easily developed and readily applied by
 all. security or intelligence personnel.
 b.  Documentation Controls - facilitate security forces in
 their efforts to identify suspect terrorists and their supporters.  Popu-
 lation identification papers should be designed to allow the police to
 spot-check any individual's name, date and place of birth, residence, family
 status, employment, race, religion, and physical description.  Photographs
 and fingerprints can also be added to documents.  In cases of emergency,
 citizens may be required to obtain special documentation for travel and
 resource control permits for the purchase of any item that might be used
 to aid a terrorist act.
 The intended objective of detailed documentation is to aid
 the-screening of an entire population.  When used in conjunction with
 terrorist profiles and when properly focused on areas where violence has
 occurred, the system can be effective in providing investigative leads.,
 c.  Biographic Registry - involves the establishment of a   W~l
 central security reference containing biographic card files or computer
 data on all known criminals, subversives, terrorists, dissidents and
 suspicious personalities.  Each security and intelligence service would
 provide appropriate biographic inputs, and have controlled access to the
 complete registry.  Sources and information would be protected by appro-
 priate compartmentation and security clearance procedures.

 YdI
 In effect, a national biographic reference is created to
 facilitate collation of all-source intelligence on confirmed or suspect
 terrorists.  If the quality and quantity of information inputs are ade-
 quate, all security personnel can use existing files as the basis for
 rapidly determining any person's possible association with terrorist.
 or subversive activity.  By establishing secure radio procedures for \.
 sending queries to the biographic registry, any policeman with appropriate
 communication can immediately validate the suspect status of individuals
 .stopped for spot-checks.
 The biographic registry does not negate the need to investi-
 gate or collect intelligence on potential terrorists having or not having
 files, but it does preclude suspect persons from going unnoticed easily.
 d.  Personnel and-Physical Security - must necessarily be
 provided for the indigenous leaders and government personnel who will
 likely be targetted for terrorist violence.  This requirement. includes
 protection of individuals from threats, coercion, assassination and
 bombing:  the latter action will prompt the need for physical security
 of offices, homes, meeting places and transportation facilities.
 General defensive procedures include (1) personnel security
 clearances; (2) entry and exit control for offices; (3) protective fences
 for fixed facilities; (4) guards for. personnel and buildings;.(5)
 screening of communications, mail and cargo; (6) use of metal detectors
 for routine weapon's search; (7) utilization of bomb squads with dogs
 trained to smell out plastic explosives; (8) travel control procedures
 emphasizing alternate routes and various methodsof transportation; (9)
 street patrols in the area of offices and individual homes; and (10)
 other tar-hniniine

 to
 The-primary objective of such elaborate precautions is to
 frustrate the effective conduct of terrorist actions and thereby prevent
 those spectacular successes which encourage expanded future violence.
 To focus defensive efforts better and conserve resource
 allocation, it is essential that hard intelligence be obtained on
 terrorist intentions and modus operandi.  This intelligence effort
 also provides the basis for offensive actions designed to negate terrorist
 violence before it can be employed.  Personnel and physical security is
 thus achieved by a combination of defensive and offensive programs, the
 latter of which can be the most effective.  The offensive methods will be
 discussed further in subsequent sections.

 e.  Intelligence Collection - is essential to the conduct of
 effective counterterror operations.  Neutralization of violence is dependent
 upon government having some knowledge of terrorist personalities, organi-
 zation, plans, intentions, ideology, modus operandi and support mechanisms.
 Without such knowledge, security forces will be unable to focus properly
 defensive or offensive actions.  Unfocused countermeasures are usually
 doomed to failure since the terrorists will be largely unaffected.  Detailed
 information on terrorists can best be obtained by clandestine human or
 ? technical penetration operations.  Failin  this, intelligence must be
 gathered by alternate means to include (13 recruitment of informants; (2)
 suspect surveillance; (3) police investigation of potential terrorists;
 (4) search for weapons, explosives or other incriminating evidence; (5)
 prisoner interrogation; (6) monitoring of possible targets and suspected
 terrorist supply sources; and (7) mass population education in observation
 and reporting techniques related to terrorist activity.
 To narrow the focus of the above collection operations,
 demographic data and terrorist profiles can be used to fix specific
 geographic areas where terrorists could reside and organize with some
 degree of relative safety.  Although terrorists may operate anywhere,
 they normally maintain their residence and meeting places among dissident
 population elements who evidence negative or hostile reaction to government
 security forces.  This fact, therefore, allows selective elimination of
 those urban and rural areas which would not provide a hospitable terrorist
 environment.
 Physical data on roads, communication facilities, residential
 patterns, buildings and isolated areas can also be  used to help determine
 likely patternsof terrorist organizational activity within suspect geo-
 graphic areas.  Trash.collectors, building inspectors, electricians and
 other personnel with natural access can be recruited to aid collection
 of this physical information.  Again, this effort further serves to pin-
 point where intelligence operations should be targetted.
 Counterintelligence/counterespionage operations will also be
 needed to supplement the above efforts.  The objective of these operations
 include (1) penetrating and manipulating terrorist cells; (2) stopping,
 disrupting, misorienting or negating terrorist intelligence collection
 activities; and (3) developing passive or specialized defenses against
 planned terrorist acts of violence.
 In summary, intelligence and counterintelligence operations
 form the foundation for counterterror campaigns.  Those security services

 or personnel not familiar with essential clandestine'tradecraft should
 seek appropriate guidance and assistance.
 f.  Intelligence Collation - provides the detailed compilation
 and analysis of information needed to help identify, arrest and convict the
 _perpetrators of violence. and their leaders or directors.  It also facilitates
 the location and elimination of terrorist support mechanisms and other hard target
 To function effectively, any collation center must have access
 to all sources of information.  This implies cooperation with all security
 and intelligence services using appropriate clearances, "'source" protection
 and compartmentation.  In addition, the centers must have the legal right and
 authority to pinpoint specific targets and assign collection or action requirement
 to individual government components.  Without such follow-on authority,
 the collation centers become little more than repositories of unexploited
 intelligence.
 All source information inputs should include (1) biographic
 data; (2) pertinent socio-economic, demographic and geographic publications;
 (3) details on transportation, communications and material resources; (4)
 target assessments; (5) analysis of terrorist organizations and modus
 operandi; and (6) all reporting on criminals, dissidents,, radicals, sub-
 versives or terrorists.  After collecting every scrap of available information,
 trained analysts then collate data with the objective of developing inves-
 tjgatiye and target leads and detailed target folders for use by the operating
 e men s.
 The primary advantage to central collation is simply that all
 available pieces of an investigative puzzle are laid before personnel
 experienced in the art of formulating a composite intelligence picture
 which provides the sharpest available detail on any terrorist organization.
 If this collation process is absent or fragmented, any intelligence product
 cannot be properly exploited and subsequent counterterror activities may
 be expected to be largely ineffective.  It is, therefore? imperative
 that any government targetted by terrorists. seek to establish the best
 possible intelligence collation system.
 g.  Security Force Requirements - generally include (1)
 defense of officia  personnel and physical facilities; ('.).riot control,
 bomb disposal and population protection from acts of viollence;. (3)
 enforcement of law and order; (4) preparation for national defense against
 internal or external acts of aggression; (5) investigation leading to
 location, arrest and conviction of criminals, dissidents, subversives or
 terrorists; and (6) other actions required to resist lawlessness, violence,
 subversion and warfare originating within or outside the state.

 The conduct of counterterror operations burden police forces
 with the requirement to provide the population freedom from fear and violence,
 while undertaking legal investigation which will ultimately result in con-
 viction and punishment of terrorists after "due process".  As previously
 stated, the foundation for this effort is based upon adequate intelligence
 collection which may be a primary or secondary function of various security
 services.
 Once., intelligence leads are provided, the lengthy and arduous
 process begins to. obtain sufficient evidence for a court trial which will
 attempt to prove the suspect terrorist guilty of accomplished or planned
 crimes of violence.  This requirement demands the skilled and extensive
 application of modern criminal investigation.  It is, therefore, essential
 that police or other security forces be provided with adequate authority,
 leadership, manpower, funds, training and equipment needed to accomplish
 the task.
 Defensive terror and other repressive acts can be covertly or
 overtly undertaken by government security forces to avoid massive investi-
 gative requirements.  However, both covert and overt actions present the
 definite possibility that populations concerned will become agitated with
 their government.  Further, some elements may actually sympathize with or
 support terrorist organizations because of illegal acts of repression.
 (See comments on defensive terror.)"  Illegal acts of repression  by
 government or "private" elements are generally counterproductive in the
 long run and should be avoided.
 Under most circumstances, it is recommended that target
 governments seek whatever resources deemed necessary to upgrade security
 forces and give them-the capability to deal with terrorists by acting
 within existing legal parameers.  Even though this is often the most
 difficult course of action, it has proven to be the most successful.
 h.  Population Mobilization - is initiated by advising and
 informing the target nation's citizenry of the nature of any terrorist
 threat and motivating mass popular participation in negating acts of
 violence.  To accomplish this objective, the populace should be organized
 and instructed in the techniques of aiding security forces in the identi-
 fication of possible terrorists and otherwise assisting in their
 apprehension.
 The latter may be accomplished by launching an aggressive
 educational program designed to establish citizen procedures for reporting
 suspicious activities or personalities that are observed by local
 inhabitants.  Carried to Its ultimate conclusion, each village and
 Approved For'Release 1999/09/24: CIA-RDP85-00671 R000200240001-5
 Approved For Release.-1,999/09/24: CIA-RDP85-00671 R000200240001-5
 city block would have resident protection committees with direct commu-
 nications to local police forces.  Possible investigative leads would
 thus be immediately relayed for exploitation by security forces.
 The unique advantage of such citizen participation is based
 on the fact that local residents are most keenly aware of unusual events
 or the appearance of strangers in their neighborhoods.  Another obvious
 benefit is the increase in the number of eyes and ears that terrorists
 will be forced to avoid.
 Actual techniques of population mobilization will vary
 according to environmental situations and citizens' receptivity or moti-
 vation.  Procedural approaches are the same as for so-called "block
 warning systems."  As stated in the introductory note? implementation
 should not be attempted prior to consultation with appropriate specialists.
 i.  Judcial Base - is created by formulating those laws which
 support fully security forces in their conduct of counterterror operations.
 In addition, such laws should insure that all efforts are politically,
 legally and morally justifiable.  This i_s particularly true of methods
 used to arrest, detain, interrogate, try, convict and imprison or execute
 ihndividual members of a.terrorist movement, as well as; to search suspected
 eou s an  caches.
 . As previously stated, populations are not likely to support
 fully and consistently any government that engages in brutal, repressive,
 illegal or indiscriminate actions, regardless of the intenIed target.
 Sabotage
 The essential purpose - of sabotage is effective disruption of the
 economic-political-security activities within a state whose government
 is targetted for ruin or overthrow.  It is a tactic that may be employed
 by urban guerrillas and terrorists, or by specialized "cells" of saboteurs.
 Fundamental objectives include (1) reduction of agricultural and indus-
 trial production; (2) impeding the effective functioning of essential
 services such as communication, transportation and utilities; and/or (3)
 limiting the conduct of various government activities with emphasis on
 internal security services and political machinery.
 Most sabotage is based upon covert destruction attack using explo-
 sives, combustibles, abrasives or subtle disruptive action.  Other
 methods include (1) mechanical breakage; (2) use of damaging chemicals;
 (3) arson; (4) electronic'interruptions; (5) pilferage of vital components;

 can have disastrous consequences on the economy and security of a state.
 Further, the systematic employment of sabotage erodes public    morale
 and confidence in government while advertizing the success and apparent
 invincibility of subversive forces.
 roof of sabotage is frequently difficult since-the ultimate
 target may not be apparent, and specific evidence destroyed in the act
 of destruction.  Individual saboteurs will frequently maintain the cover
 of a normal life and commit their disruptive actions during the course
 of regular work or travel.  It is for this reason that sabotage is such a
 potent revolutionary tactic.  Fortunately, saboteurs have a general
 tendency to become overly confident or aggressive, thereby exposing them-
 selves.  The lack of rigid compartmentation may stimulate the use of
 saboteurs for violent acts which unnecessarily expose their cover.  In
 addition, saboteurs may be asked or forced to provide their own sabotage
 materials, thereby risking identification during procurement activities.
 Effective control of saboteurs requires a combination of psycho-
 logical and terrorist control systems discussed in the previous sections.
 These techniques must be supplemented by extensive security procedures
 for industry, communication and transportation facilities, government
 offices, or other lucrative targets.  Emphasis is placed on physical
 protection, repetitive screening of personnel, and strict control of
 potential sabotage materials.  If such systems still fail to deter the
 saboteur, it may be necessary to install television monitors to observe
 all human activity in the area of critical targets,  Further, a rotating
 "buddy system" can be used to assure that individual saboteurs are con-
 stantly observed by a fellow worker.
 In sum, effective prevention of sabotage is a difficult but not
 impossible task.  Governments confronted with this problem will need
 to seek further guidance and assistance on implementation of plant and
 physical security procedures. Moreover, they must recognize that they are
 dealing with a movement which is conspiratorial in nature and organization.
 (6) dissemination of incorrect information, falsification of data,mis-
 filing and records manipulation; (7) tampering; (8) fatal "flawing" of
 materials or equipment; (9) work slowdowns; (10) interruption of command
 or control procedures; and (11) use of laws, courts, and parlimentary
 rules to impede the effective functioning of government.

 Propaganda and Agitation
 In order to be successful, most subversive movements must convince
 a majority of a target population that the conditions under which they
 exist are intolerable.  This attitude will then provide the motivation
 and "cause" needed to stimulate the popular dissidence essential to
 ruining or overthrowing any government.
 Propaganda comes in many and varied forms to include (1) leaflets;
 (2) letter campaigns; (3) wall slogans; (4) rumors; (5) oratory; and (6)
 radio, newspapers or other media.  However, the latter forum exists only
 where free speech is guaranteed or for low-level efforts which might not
 be supressed.
 Agitation is usually accomplished by influence agents who seize
 upon controversial issue to "inflame" specific audiences for the purpose
 of stimulating the development of particular attitudes, actions or
 reactions.  These individuals usually focus their attention on labor,
 student or other population organizations that have banded together because
 of common interests they wish to protect or promote.  By identifying
 with their cause, the agitator can thus seek to exploit any known grievance.
 Once again, the previously discussed psychological control systems
 afford. on effective means to negate the influence of subversive-sponsored
 agitation and propaganda.  The most important technique beinq the guarantee
 of,credible, institutional and constitutional processes for non-violent reso-___
 -lution of conditions that any population segment conceives"as being intolerable
 To enhance the above, government should ativertize merits of its
 own efforts to institute reform and constructive change.  They must
 discredit the subversives and prove that government will and can overcome
 major problems while defeating the urban guerrillas within established
 parameters of law and order.
 Any government also has the option of silence or direct counter-
 propaganda activities.  Leaflets can be discredited, manipulated or answered,
 Letter campaigns may be countered by confusing the issues, mail censor-
 ship, and letters containing alternative opinions.  Wall slogans can
 be painted out, sand-blasted or sometimes manipulated by adding or sub-
 tracting letters and words.  Rumors can be distorted, discredited or
 burried in an avalanche of other rumors.  Oratory is negated by argumen-
 tative oratory.  Media owners can usually be influenced or pressured to
 avoid "playing" issues giving credibility to the subversive cause.
 Additionally, government can effectively utilize various media to convey
 its counterpropaganda message.

 Agitator activity may be observed by low-level informants recruited
 from among those organizations or institutions the former is attempting to
 influence.  Specific agitators can then be harassed, surveiled, detained
 or arrested until they cease and desist their activity.  The government
 can also recruit their own agents of influence to be targetted against
 potential dissident groups.  These individuals act as counteragitators
 who attempt to "dampen" subversive attitudes or actions, and convince
 their audiences to seek desired changes by legal and peaceful.means.  This
 latter approach, of course, assumes that government is not repressive and
 has provided some basis for reform.
 Armed Violence
 Snipers or "firing groups" of four or five men may undertake limited
 hit and run attacks to erode popular confidence in government security
 forces and to force the initiation of repressive acts antagonistic to a
 target populace.  Weapons include rifles, shotguns, pistols, grenades,
 Molotov cocktails, explosives and other light-weight, easily concealable
 items.  Targets may be discriminately or indiscriminately selected.
 Police, firemen, government officials, foreign diplomats or businessmen
 and leaders of moderating forces are high on the discriminate list.
 Indiscriminate targets are usually selected to incite population fear.
 These armed action groups may also be used to undertake robbery, kid-
 napping, assassination or other select activity in support of overall
 subversive objectives.
 In the urban environment, such guerrilla action is at close
 quarters for extremely short duration.  Specific, tactics will depend
 on the target, the metropolitan terrain, attack options, movement
 alternatives, type of, weapons, accepted modus operandi and the potential
 for surprise/retreat.  The net effect being a great diversification of
 tactical approach from one situation to another.
 The sniper or armed guerrilla squad often appear to have little
 distinction from terrorists; however, the latter are usually limited
 to covert acts of assassination and bombing.  Whereas the so-called
 "fire teams" engage in more overt and flagrant hostilities that
 separate them from the normal terrorists.  A basic difference in tactics
 also necessitate handling the two groups separately.
 Effective intelligence collection and collation or other tech-
 niques discussed under terrorist control may aid the apprehension and
 arrest of snipers or members of fire teams.  However, defeat of these

 particular urban. guerrilla components will require-a major effort on
 the part of internal security forces.
 Snipers are a specialized problem in themselves.  The instant
 a sniper opens fire, the police and/or other security elements must
 have the immediate capability to "cordon" the fire zone and safely
 remove all civilians or other targets enclosed within.  Security
 forces must then utilize available protective cover while moving to
 locate, encircle and entrap the sniper.  Any counterfire should be
 undertaken only by skilled marksmen using high-powered rifles with
 scopes.  Massive amounts of uncontrolled firepower only serve to
 endanger civilians and property while providing the sniper with addi-
 tional targets.  Terrain advantage may be achieved by use of multi-storied
 buildings or helicopters.  The overall objective being to quickly and
 efficiently eliminate the sniper while protecting the populace and
 avoiding any retaliatory action which could serve the guerrilla cause.
 Fire teams are the urban guerrillas' paramilitary arm and must
 usually be countered by employment of basic counterguerrilla tactics.
 Police and other internal security elements will need the type of
 training, arms, equipment, communication and mobility that will prepare
 them to undertake such action.  This normally will involve some funda-
 mental changes in the organization and deployment of all internal
 security forces.  An "initial reaction force" may be composed of
 specially augmented police squads that are strategically deployed
 throughout the urban target area.  These units should be capable of
 momentary response to any guerrilla attack and they must be`prepared
 to immediately engage guerrilla fire groups in a street battle.  How-
 ever, counteraction must be delayed until such time as the civilian
 populace. has been lead to escape from the fire zone.
 Reserve units should be created to provide a backup for the
 initial reaction forces.  The reserve is normally composed of police
 companies or specially trained military organizations held on a stand-
 by basis.  Such units can be called in to cordon and search an area or
 they may be deployed to directly engage guerrilla elements.  It is
 also essential that military reserve forces be prepared to react against
 a series of widely dispersed guerrilla actions designed to overwhelm
 the police.
 Assassination and Kidnapping
 The urban guerrillas may employ assassination and/or kidnapping
 operations to eliminate "key" leaders within government or the private

 ? Approved For ReleasaeA999/09/24: CIA-RDP85-00671 R000200240001-5
 sector.  Liquidation of existing leadership is the oldest method of.
 revolution and affords a relatively simple means to dislocate or dis-
 organize political-social-economic institutions.
 Targets may be limited to "heads" of state, representatives of
 government, local leaders, or other individuals who act to support the
 status quo.  The primary aim of a systematic campaign of assassination is
 to alienate a populace from their government by establishing the omni-
 potent power of the guerrillas.  Kidnapping operations may also be
 designed to accomplish this same objective, and to extract concessions,
 capture publicity, provoke controversy or free political prisoners.
 Targets for kidnapping may also include foreign diplomats or business
 executives and various personalities who might be useful for propaganda
 purposes.  In some cases, the kidnap victim may be executed after his
 usefulness has ended, so the net effect is that of a combined kidnapping
 and assassinW on.
 Individuals or select three- to five-man guerrilla teams are
 usually employed to conduct the above types of operations.  Normally,
 such individuals are selected on the basis of their proven courage,
 dedication, resourcefulness and cunning.  Preferably, they are not
 persons wanted by the authorities, but ordinary citizens capable of
 moving about freely.  Assassinations or kidnappings are planned in
 detail and special surveillance parties first check on the movements
 of propective vistims.  The target is shadowed to learn his habits,
 hours, movement patterns and usual security procedures.  When a pattern
 is established, the guerrillas then develop and rehearse their specific
 modus operandi.
 To counter the threat of assassination or kidnapping, all potential
 targets must be advised to constantly vary their routes of movement and
 patterns of activity.  Prospective security procedures should be devised
 fQr all key personalities.  Every effort must be made to avoid unneces-
 sarily exposing potential targets.  When they must be exposed, threatened
 subjects should not be at a specific location at the time guerrilla
 elements might expect them to be there.  Special security arrangements
 may be required for routine travel between a target's home and office.
 In urban areas where a high threat exists, special buses with armed
 guards can be used to pick up and escort key leaders between home and
 office.  Physical security of offices can be increased and potential
 target personalities, plus their families, may all be moved into a
 ? protected residential compound with fences, guards, etc.

 Additional countermeasures include the various control systems
 discussed under the previous section on terrorists.  Primary emphasis
 is on intelligence operations designed to identify assassins and
 kidnappers.
 Infiltration
 The security and operational potential of an urban guerrilla
 force is usually predicated on the quantity of intelligence obtained
 by successful-infiltration.  If police and internal security organi-
 zations can be penetrated, the guerrillas may thus be forewarned of
 actions planned against them.  The infiltration of security forces was
 seen by Lenin as one of the essential preconditions for a successful
 urban uprising.  Lenin's theory being that urban guerrillas would always
 be outgunned unless they neutralized the police and other security elements
 by infiltrating their own agents at all levels.
 In addition, the subversive movement cannot be expected to succeed
 unless it attacks and erodes any official programs designed to establish
 or sustain population confidence in government.  To help accomplish this
 goal, the urban guerrillas will attempt to infiltrate all elements of
 the target regime.  The net objective is to obtain information which
 can be used to plan disruptive or destructive attacks against socio-
 economic development projects or other programs designed to alleivate
 popular grievances.
 Select infiltration operations may be used'-to obtain specific
 target intelligence, particularly as regards procurement of funds,
 weapons, or other supplies.  Penetration agents can also provide
 information on potential targets for terrorist, sabotage, assassination
 and kidnap operations.
 Classic clandestine "tradecraft" techniques are used as the
 basis for organizing and accomplishing infiltration operations.
 We are first concerned with human penetrations and to a lesser
 degree, theft,tribery, technical penetrations and other ancillary types
 of espionage.  However, the primary danger is that guerrillas may obtain
 a popular following from among elements of the population having existing
 intelligence access.  This situation will then create a more spontaneous
 flow of information which the urban guerrillas can use for protection
 or advantage.

 An effective counterintelligence operation requires (1) trained
 espionage officers; (2) secure communication and facilities; (3) bio-
 graphic files to facilitate security clearances and name traces; (4)
 physical securit  and document control systems; (5) human and electronic
 surveillance; (6) informant nets; (7) double agents; (8) "block warning
 systems"; and (9) a variety of other specialized techniques.  All of this
 should be supplemented by modern criminal investigative practices usually
 requiring an upgrading of overall police capabilities.
 Thus, a major and essential function of target government is. to
 stop, disrupt, manipulate or negate rebel intelligence operations.
 Accomplishment of this objective requires massive utilization of counter-
 intelligence procedures and police investigative techniques.  The initial
 action is to identify specific agents, their guerrilla contacts, their
 couriers and courier routes, dead drops, and other communication or con-
 tact procedures.  Once a subversive agent is identified? an operation
 may be carefully planned to attempt to double the agent. Failing this,
 the agent should be apprehended, interrogated, convicted and imprisoned
 according to "due process".
 Mob Violence
 Street tactics of the urban guerrillas include the instigation and/
 or manipulation of demonstrations, mobs, and strikes.  The objective is
 to create a situation wherein peaceful protect groups can be agitated to
 participate in acts of civil disobedience or riot.
 Agents of influence and subversive agitators may seize upon any
 popular grievance to stimulate the formation of protest: groups.  The
 next objective is for agitators to encourage the type of public demon-
 stration that could easily "flare" into a confrontation with police.
 Having created a proper environment, various guerrilla elements
 can infiltrate the street mobs to incite a riot or undertake acts of
 violence using the protestors for cover.
 Guerrilla tactics are simple.  Bottles, bricks, and stones can
 be hurled at police.  Hasty barricades may be used to block streets.
 Business establishments, factories and/or government buildings can be
 looted or burned.  Snipers can-be deployed to fire at police, hoping
 they in turn will retaliate by killing innocent members of the mob.
 When the police attempt to arrest an agitator, a larger group of urban

 Approved For Release 1999/09/24: CIA-RDP85-00671 R000200240001-5
 guerrillas may attempt to aid his escape.  If internal security forces
 effectively contain the riot, the guerrillas will retreat along pre-
 planned avenues of escape.
 The primary objective of such group agitation is to force the
 government to take strong repressive measures, thereby further alienating
 the population.  Promoting general disorder also helps to disrupt the
 economy and undermine the government.  Last but not least, by organizing
 social discontent, the urban guerrillas induce the population to accept
 their leadership while demonstrating the regime's lack of authority.
 Basic ingredients for group agitation include (1) leadership
 trained in mob psychology and tactics; (2) an executive committee
 responsible for overall planning and execution; (3) propaganda efforts
 to rally public sympathy for a cause; (4) compilation and continuous
 review of exploitable grievances; (5) registration of potential dissi-
 dents; (6) study of overall environment; (7) profiling of radical
 organizations; (8) enlistment of financial and moral support; (9)
 tactical training for agitators; (10) development of community support;
 (11) recruitment of "crowd-roving" orators; (12) preparation of music,
 chants and slogans; (13) creation of demands and ultimatums; (14)
 planning for pivotal events designed to precipitate conflict; (15)
 public announcement of time and place for planned demonstration; (16)
 stimulation of actions to incite media coverage; and (17) encouraging
 demonstrators to participate in dramatic mass arrests.
 By effective manipulation of mob psychology, the urban guerrilla
 thus plans to push the aggrieved citizen into outright breaches of
 law that will lead to heightened outbursts of violence.  In addition,
 all-out revolution must be rapidly precipitated or mob participants will
 lose stamina in the face of prolonged adversity.  To succeed, group
 agitation must be carefully timed to coincide and "peak." with other
 guerrilla actions.
 A target government has only two types of countermeasures for
 controlling group agitation.  The first is to quickly and mercilessly
 crush any protestors by use of totalitarian force.  Obviously, this is
 not feasible for any democratic society.  A second option is to
 institute political and psychological control systems previously dis-
 cussed and to prepare internal security forces for non-violent mob/riot
 control.  The principal technique being to control effectively a mob
 without repressive or brutal tactics which further agitate the population
 mass.

 CONCLUSION
 Throughout history, violence has been an integral part  of the
 political process.  Urban guerrillaHarfare is a modern ,popular form
 of this activity advocated by communists and various national revolu-
 tionaries.                            More civil and humane states have limited violence by
 developing the type of laws, custom, consensus and responsiveness which
 limit the need or purpose of such hostility.  However, no system has
 eliminated violence on the periphery of its consensual and support base.
 When violence remains peripheral, police powers of the state are
 usually adequate to "deal" with the problem in a manner acceptable to
 the population majority.  If dissident forces are more than peripheral,
 the typical response is one of absorption, cooptation, and acceptance
 of essential reform as the basis for re-establishing a broad popular
 consensus.  Those. governments which fail to perceive the significance of
 popular grievance are inviting an outbreak of violence.  The same is
 true for regimes that fail to move toward accommodation when they are
 unable to repress significant population demands for reform.
 Even though a subversive conspiracy may exist, it. is not the
 revolutionaries or social deviates who cause the major problem.  They
 are merely the tip of an iceberg which government may take repressive
 action to destroy.  However, a new peak may be pushed to the surface
 by that "base" of popular dissent which originally stimulated and
 supported the initial violence.
 An urban guerrilla organization cannot be a serious threat unless
 it maintains a_symbiotic relationship between themselves, as the tip
 of the iceberg, and their underwater population base.  Thus, any acts
 of violence must be controlled politically as regards timing, target,
 theater of operation and precise selectivity; the primary purpose being
 augmentation of the subversive base and not annihilation of an enemy.
 In essence, the damage to a regime is incidental to political objectives.
 It is for this reason that subversive elements seek to force government
 .to engage in repressive acts which will alienate the population.
 The incumbent target regime must avoid use of repression and take
 those actions necessary to expand its political base commensurate with
 the threat imposed by urban guerrillas.  In this regard, the age-old
 techniques of cooptation and absorption are often more important than
 security measures in dealing with the threat of violence.  Hostilities

 do not alter effectively the political process, but intensify the diffi-
 culty of coalition building to arrive at a consensual agreement that
 will create the basis for popular support.  Only a totalitarian state
 has the potential for the type of complete repression that does not
 require cooptation or adaptation.  The absorption of an urban guerrilla
 movement requires modification of governmental policy, which is seldom
 severe or detrimental to an existing regime if initiated during early
 stages of violence.
 In sum, we. can conclude that increased government fire power or
 external aid to a'regime does not alter the political reality of the
 situation so long as subversive forces retain minimal viability.  In
 the final analysis, the remediat actions suggested in this study are
 of little value unless accompanied by enlightened political solutions.
