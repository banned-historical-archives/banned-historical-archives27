 House of Representatives
 WEDNESDAY, JULY 22, 1959
 The House met at 12 o'clock noon.
 The Chaplain, Rev. Bernard Braskam.p,
 D.D., offered the following prayer:
 Psalm 23: 6: Surely goodness and
 mercy shall follow me all the days of my
 ,life.
 Almighty God, of whose bounty we
 have all received and whose mercies can-
 not be numbered, may we ever be mind-
 ful of the attendant responsibility to.
 prove worthy stewards of Thy manifold
 blessings.
 Grant that through the miracle and
 ministry of Thy grace and goodness we
 may be inspired to be more sensitive in
 our sympathies and more responsive to
 the needs of the less.fortunate members
 of the human family.
 May our longings and labors for the
 welfare of mankind be an earnest of our
 love toward Thee and a manifestation
 of our gratitude for the gift of Thy Son,
 our Saviour, with whom Thou hast freely
 given us all things.
 In His name we offer our prayer.
 Amen.

 A message in writing from the Presi-
 dent of the United States was communi-

 his secretaries.
 MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE
 A message from the Senate by Mr.
 McGown, one of its clerks, announced
 that the Senate had passed a bill of the
 following title, in which concurrence of
 the House is requested :
 S. 1138. An act to provide readjustment
 assistance to veterans who serve in the
 Armed Forces between January 31, 1955, anal
 July 1, 1963.
 The message also announced that the
 Vice President has appointed Mr. Joszr-
 STON of South Carolina and Mr. CARLSON,
 members of -the Joint Select Committee
 on the part of the Senate, as provided for
 in the act of August 5, 1939, entitled "An
 act to provide for the-disposition of cer-
 tain records of the U.S. Government," for
 the disposition of executive papers re-
 ferred to in the report of the Archivist
 of the United States numbered 60-1.

 The question was taken; and (two-

 the rules were suspended and the bill

 than the Executive request, and is $13,-

 There was no objection.
 The Clerk read the statement.
 (For conference report and statement
 see proceedings of the House of July 21,
 1959.)
 Mr. MORGAN.  Mr. Speaker, I yield
 myself 10 minutes.
 Mr. Speaker, the conferees bring back
 to the House a bill which represents a
 compromise between a bill that passed
 the House and a Senate bill which dif-
 fered from it in some, 57 instances, a
 number of which were of major impor-
 tance.  The money differences between
 the two bills this year were relatively less
 important, and the differences with re-
 spect to the relationship of the two bills
 to our foreign policy and to congressional
 control over the mutual security program
 were of relative large importance.
 Let, me make clear at the very begin-
 ning that this bill contains no authority
 to use foreign currencies without appro-
 priation nor does it authorize any back
 door approach to the Treasury.  The
 House conferees kept in mind the rules
 of the House and the sentiment prevail-
 ing in the House on these matters, and
 were careful that no such provisions were
 included.
 It is difficult to make a meaningful
 comparison of the total dollar authori-
 zations in the two bills. This is true be-
 cause the bill as it passed the Senate in-
 cluded an authorization for 2 years for
 the Development Loan Fund and a con-
 tinuing authorization for the military
 No funds after fiscal 1960 were author-
 ized in the bill that passed the House.
 The total of the authorizations for fiscal
 year 1960 approved by the House was
 $3,542,600,000 and the total of the au-
 thorizations approved by the Senate was
 amount  originally  approved  by  the
 House; in 1957 the authorization ap-
 proved by the conference was $250,250,-
 000 higher than the authorization in-
 cluded in the House bill; last year the
 conference agreed to an aggregate au-
 thorization which was $72,500,000 above
 the bill approved by the House. I think
 everyone will recognize that we have
 done pretty well this year.
 As I said a moment ago, the major
 problems which confronted the House
 conferees involved matters of congres-
 sional practice and congressional con-
 trol, as well as major aspects of our for-
 eign policy.
 The Senate bill included an author-
 ization to transfer up to 30 percent of
 military assistance funds to economic
 assistance. The House had made its po-
 sition very clear to the House conferees
 during the consideration of the bill on
 the House floor, and we gave this issue
 top priority.  I am glad to be able to
 report that the Senate receded with re-
 spect to this provision.
 Another major issue with which the
 conference was confronted involved the
 continuing authorization for military as-
 sistance.  The Senate bill included such
 an authorization, which was supported
 by the executive branch.  The Draper
 Commission, as you know, had recom-
 mended only a couple of weeks ago that
 military assistance be authorized on a
 continuing basis, and the Senate held
 very strongly to its position on this mat-
 ter. After prolonged discussion, a com-
 promise was agreed to by which, after
 the current fiscal year, such funds are
 authorized for military assistance as may
 be required for fiscal year 1961 and fiscal
 year 1962. After this 2-year period, fur-
 ther authorization will be necessary. It
 is the belief of the House conferees that
 this 2-year period should be regarded as
 experimental in nature and that the
 House will have an opportunity to ob-
 serve the consequences of this type of
 authorization before reaching a final de-
 termination.
 The conference faced a major issue
 also in the case of the authorization for
 the Development Loan Fund.  The Sen-
 ate bill authorized $2 billion for a 2-year

 period with the provision that $750 mil-
 lion could be advanced to the Fund in
 fiscal 1960 and the remaining $1,250
 million could be advanced during fiscal
 1961.  We were able to arrive at a com-
 promise, which held the fiscal 1960 au-
 thorization to $700 million-the figure
 approved by the House-and provided an
 authorization for fiscal 1961 of $1,100
 million.. This involved an overall reduc-
 ,'tion from the Senate figure of $200 mil-
 lion.  This was the best that we were able
 to do, and I believe it is a reasonable
 arrangement considering the situation
 which exists in the Senate and supported
 by the Executive.
 There were two provisions of the Sen-
 ate bill which had major implications to
 our foreign policy. The first was a re-
 quirement that $893,750,000 of the funds
 authorized for military assistance had
 to be used to provide assistance to the
 NATO countries. Had this requirement
 prevailed it would have made necessary
 a cut s~f.43;ercent in military assistance
 to the non-N ATTO nations.  I firmly be-
 lieve that,  cut of?this magnitude in the
 Msistance to he countries outside NATO
 tvoui  have seriously impaired our rela-
 tions with, other nations and would have
 been dang~ggrglls to our national security.
 I am gfad-to be able to report that the
 Senate receded on_,this point and the re-
 quirezn`ent that a' specified amount of
 t5yyassistance money should go to
 the   A`l`beopntries was completely
 eliminated.
 other ilnportant foreign policy
 %i
 problem presented by the Senate bill in-
 volved the requirement that $31,500,000
 of military assistance for Latin America
 had to be used either for assistance to a
 military'force organized and directed by
 the Or          of American' States or,
 if not so used could be used only to pro-
 vide economic assistance to Latin Ameri-
 can Count; ies               In this case 'the Organ-
 ization of imericari States had no plans,
 uo'a1lt hority or no7 desire to create such
 a military;, force, and the result would
 inevitably  lave teen that the money
 would have beep diverted from military
 assistance to economic assistance. I am
 glad to be'able to report that the House
 conferees"were successful in their opposi-
 tion to tni",s )provision and that this was
 deleted from the bill.
 It gives me great personal satisfaction
 to be able to info"rm the House that the
 prpvisiq`eontaied in the House bill for
 the: se,11111111 tting lip of" an Inspector General
 and Comptroller to supervise the opera-
 tion of the mutual security program was
 accepted by the Senate.  I believe that
 this provision will make a major contri-
 bution to tightening up the administra-
 tion of the mutual security program and
 to  improving  its  effectiveness.   We
 worked very hard in conference to secure
 the approval of the Senate conferees to
 this provision and feel great satisfaction
 that we were successful.
 With regard to other provisions of the
 bill, we compromised on what seems to
 me to be on the whole a 50-50 basis.  It
 was necessary for the House to recede
 completely with respect to some amend-
 znents and the Senate to recede com-
 pletely with respect to others. Most dif-
 ferences were resolved by the adoption of
 compromise language. I do not believe
 that we receded on any matter which
 will handicap the United States in the
 conduct of its foreign relations or which
 involves the policies or precedents of the
 House. in any conference it is necessary
 to give and take in order to reach agree-
 ment.  I believe that the managers on
 the part of the House have done a good
 job, and I urge that the conference report
 be adopted.
 Mr. WALTER.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. MORGAN.  I yield to the gentle-
 man from Pennsylvania.
 Mr. WALTER.  Mr. Speaker, I am
 gratified by the splendid assistance, those
 of us who are interested in the surplus
 population problem received from the
 distinguished chairman of the Commit-
 tee on Foreign Affairs and his colleagues
 who participated in the conference on
 this legislation in obtaining a clear and
 unequivocal statement regarding the
 availablity of counterpart funds for land
 resettlement programs in Latin America.
 We are hopeful that the administration
 will now be guided in their negotiations
 with some of our Latin American neigh-
 bors by the findings and recommenda-
 tions of the conferees.
 For the purpose of further clarification
 of the RECORD, I request unanimous con-
 sent to include at this point copies of my
 correspondence on this subject with the
 Acting Secretary of State, Mr. C. Douglas
 Dillon.
 The SPEAKER.  Is there objection to
 the request'of the gentleman from Penn-
 sylvania?
 There was no objection.
 The matter referred to follows:
 JULY 10, 1959.
 Hon. C. DOUGLAS DILLON,
 Undersecretary of State,
 Department of State,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. DILLON: You are aware, of course,
 of the fact that the House of Representa-
 tives has included in the mutual security bill
 (H.R. 7500)  section 205(a)(3) authorizing
 the use of counterpart funds for the financ-
 ing of land settlement projects defined in
 section 400(b) (C) of the Mutual Security
 Act of 1954, as amended.
 This provision was originally submitted to
 the House Committee on Foreign Affairs by
 myself after it has been repeatedly indicated
 to me in the course of negotiations leading
 to the granting by the Development Loan
 Fund of certain loans (in U.S. dollars) de-
 signed to assist in the development of such
 projects in Latin America, that existing law
 does not authorize the use of foreign cur-
 rency accruing either under the Mutual
 Security Act or under the Agricultural Trade
 Development and Assistance Act (Public Law
 480 of the 83d Congress).
 Having made an effort to have the Senate
 include in their companion bill the provision
 approved by the House, I am now informed
 by the Senate Committee on Foreign Rela-
 tions that according to comments received
 by             that  committee  from  the  executive
 branch, the House provision is not deemed
 to be necessary in view of the fact that "the
 President presently has authority to make
 loans for land resettlement purposes with-
 out regard to section 1415 (of the Supple-
 mental Appropriations Act of 1953)  from
 foreign currencies accruing" under either of
 the above cited acts,  I am further informed
 that according to the opinion of the execu-
 tive branch, "neither of these authorities is
 subject to the requirement that foreign cur-
 rencles for such loans be authorized from
 time to time in appropriation acts."  Conse-
 quently, according to the Committee on
 Foreign Relations of the Senate, the present
 statutory authority is sufficient to make for-
 eign currencies available for loans to finance
 land settlement projects determined to pro-
 mote economic development of certain Latin
 American countries as defined in clause (C)
 of subsection (b) of section 400, supra.
 The purpose of this letter is to obtain
 from you a definitive determination whether
 or not the views attributed to the executive
 branch in the Senate committee's analysis
 of the Mutual Security Act of 1959 reflect the'
 official findings of the administration and
 whether you are of the opinion that existing
 law contains sufficient authority for the
 granting of foreign currency loans for the
 above defined land settlement projects.
 In view of the fact that the House-Senate
 conference committee on the Mutual Secu-
 rity Act of 1959 is expected to begin their
 work within the next few days, your early
 attention to this request would be very much
 appreciated.
 Sincerely yours,
 FRANCIS E. WALTER,
 Chairman.
 DEPARTMENT OF STATE,'
 Washington, July 15, 1959.
 The Honorable FRANCIS E. WALTER,
 Chairman, Subcommittee No. 1, Committee
 on the Judiciary, House of Representa-
 tives.
 DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: In your letter of July
 10, 1959, you asked me to confirm informa-
 tion you have received from the Senate Com-
 mittee on Foreign Relations concerning com-
 ments supplied to it by the executive branch
 regarding section 205(a)(3)  of H.R. 7500
 authorizing the use of counterpart funds for
 financing certain land settlement projects.
 I can confirm that the expressions quoted
 in the third paragraph of your letter do rep-
 resent the views of the executive branch.
 These views are stated as follows in theposi-
 tion paper on this matter provided by the
 executive branch to the conferees on the mu-
 tual security authorizing bill:
 "The President presently has authority to-
 make loans for land resettlement purposes
 without regard to section 1415 of the Supple-
 mental Appropriation Act, 1953, from foreign
 currencies accruing under section 402 of the
 Mutual Security Act and under Public Law
 480 when such loans are determined to pro-
 mote economic development under section
 104(g) of Public Law 480.  Neither of these
 authorities is subject to the requirement
 that foreign currencies for such loans be
 specified from time to time in appropriation
 acts.
 If the intent of this amendment, apart
 from Its effect, is to provide additional au-
 thority to assist land resettlement' programs
 in Latin America, on the assumption that
 the present authorities for such assistance
 were inadequate, the fact is, as indicated
 above, that the existing authorities are al-
 ready adequate for this purpose and there-
 fore such an amendment would be unnec-
 essary."
 I am enclosing a copy of this position for
 your convenience.
 Sincerely yours,
 Acting Secretary.
 Mr. MORGAN. I am sure that there is
 spelled out in the statement of the man-
 agers on the part of the House protective
 language that will satisfy the gentleman
 from Pennsylvania, on this matter that
 I know he has been deeply interested in
 for a great many years.
 Mr. GARY.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- HOUSE          =          12773
 Mr. MORGAN. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Virginia.
 Mr. GARY. Is it true that this bill as
 now presented by the conferees has elimi-
 nated all so-called back door approaches
 to the Treasury, such as permitting the
 organizations to borrow directly from the
 Treasury rather than to go through the
 appropriation processes?
 Mr. MORGAN. That is correct..
 Mr. GARY. All of the appropriations
 are now required to go through the regu-
 lar appropriation processes?
 Mr. MORGAN. All of the appropria-
 tions are now required to go through the
 Committee on Appropriations.
 Mr. GARY. It is not a question of go-
 ing through the Committee on Appro-
 priations, but a question of using the
 appropriation processes so that they will
 be acted upon by the Congress.
 Mr. MORGAN.  They all go through
 that process.
 Mr. GARY. I thank the gentleman.
 Mr. PASSMAN. Mr. Speaker, will the
 distinguished Chairman yield?
 Mr. MORGAN. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Louisiana.
 Mr. PASSMAN. I observe, on page 8,
 the following: "Of the funds appropri-
 ated pursuant to section 451(b) of this
 act."
 That is for the small business orgard-
 zation within the program.  The lan-
 guage would indicate that the $2,500,000
 requested would come out of the Presi-
 dent's contingent fund; is that correct?
 Mr. MORGAN. That is correct.
 Mr. PASSMAN. Then, as we go over to
 page 12 there is a new organization, In-
 ternational Cooperation in Health.  Is
 that not a new section in the bill?
 Mr. MORGAN. Did the gentleman say
 on page 12?
 Mr. PASSMAN.  The item starts on
 page 11.
 Mr. MORGAN.   Again, that money.
 would come out of the contingency fund
 if the President felt he wanted to use it.
 Mr. PASSMAN.  But under the pres-
 ent legislation, the gentleman is not ask-
 ing for an appropriation for this, so it
 would naturally come out of the contin-
 gency fund, and it so states.
 Mr., MORGAN.  We are not making
 any separate authorization for the In-
 ternational Cooperation in Health pro-
 gram.
 Mr. PASSMAN. Then, on page 14, we
 find "United States participation in
 World Refugee Year."  That is a new
 item or section of the bill, is it not?
 Mr. MORGAN. That is a new item.
 Mr. PASSMAN.  And the money for
 that also comes out of the President's
 contingency fund?
 Mr. MORGAN.   Again, that is in sea-
 tion 451(b), which is the contingency
 fund.
 Mr. PASSMAN.  In that connection,
 this legislation would set up a new or-
 ganization, for which the future expense,
 could be very substantial.  If you get
 them started out of the contingent fund,
 then in he fuure they could come in for
 a regular appropriation, and it is im-
 possible at this time to determine what
 the cost would be; is it not?
 Mr; MORGAN. Well, we are now par-
 ticipating in a number of international
 refugee organizations.  This does not
 involve any new organization that I
 know of.
 Mr. PASSMAN.  How about the small
 business section and the health organ-
 ization?
 Mr.  MORGAN. These amendments
 were put in by the other body.  They
 had testimony that our own Govern-
 ment agencies had a large surplus of
 machine tools.  They felt very strongly
 about the amendment.  I think the
 House  by  eliminating the  separate
 authorizations and incorporating them
 in section 451(b) was a victory for the
 House.
 Mr. PASSMAN.  In both of these in-
 stances, there is being set up, in effect,
 two new organizations and in future
 years the cost of operating the program
 could be many, many times the amount
 requested this year; is that not so?
 Mr. MORGAN,.  I do not believe any
 new organization is necessarily involved,
 some new operations may result.  The
 international health organization and
 the world refugee organizations are not
 new.
 Mr. PASSMAN. How about the inter-
 national health organization and this
 proposed organization that you would
 set up in Hawaii, the cultural program?
 Mr. MORGAN. There is no money in
 section 451(b) for that.
 Mr. PASSMAN. I would like to ask a
 further question, if the distinguished
 chairman will yield.
 Is this not true: Are these items, items
 that you propose to finance out of the
 contingent fund.  Prom our experience
 of what has happened in the past, the
 executive to a very large extent has nul-
 lified acts of Congress by reinstating the
 cuts that we have made in a program,
 because of this large contingent fund.
 Mr. MORGAN.  Well, you cannot
 make that interpretation because these
 provisions were not requested by the Ex-
 ecutive and the Executive opposed put-
 ting them -in the contingent fund.
 Mr. PASSMAN. Is it not true, if I
 may ask this final question, that prac-
 tically all the money that was spent last
 year out of the President's contingent
 fund went to offset cuts made in other
 programs by the Congress?
 Mr. MORGAN.  Of course, these pro-
 grams are all subject to appropriation
 limitations, as the gentleman knows.
 The gentleman from Louisiana is the
 chairman of the appropriations subcom-
 mittee which can put limitations on ex-
 penditures for them.
 Mr. PASSMAN. I just wanted to find
 out if the distinguished chairman un-
 derstood that 80 percent of the con-
 tingent fund last year was used to offset
 cuts made by the Congress and the reg-
 ular committees.
 Mr. MORGAN. I have had no report
 on this matter since the Foreign Affairs
 .Committee concluded its hearings on
 the mutual security bill.
 Mr. PASSMAN.  I thank the gentle-
 man.
 Mr. MORGAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to
 ,the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. MA-
 sON] to make a unanimous consent re-
 guest.
 - Mr. MASON. Mr. Speaker, I  ask
 unanimous consent to extend my re-
 marks in the Appendix of the RECORD on
 the subject that the bills S. 2014 and
 H.R. 7391 should not pass.
 The SPEAKER. Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from
 Illionis?
 There was no objection.
 Mr. MORGAN.  Mr. Speaker, I yield
 such time as he may desire to the gen-
 tleman from Wisconsin [Mr: ZABLOCKII.
 Mr. ZABI4OCKI. Mr. Speaker, I be-
 lieve that .tlie conference report on the
 Mutual Security Act of 1959 contains a
 reasonable and constructive compromise
 between the provisions approved by the
 House and those which originated in the
 other body.
 The conference report cuts deeply into
 the request of the President-deeper, I
 would say, than some of us have con-
 sidered advisable in view of the overall
 Communist threat. Further, it proposes
 to put into effect certain reforms intend-
 ed to eliminate those abuses in the ad-
 ministration of our foreign aid program
 which were brought to light by the Com-
 mittee on Foreign Affairs and by other
 sources. This legislation has been care-
 fully drafted to safeguard our public in-
 terest.  The reforms it proposes are
 sound and needed.  I am pleased that
 they remain in the final version of this
 measure.
 I sincerely hope that the conference
 report on the Mutual Security Act of
 1959 will receive prompt and overwhelm-
 ing approval of this House.
 At this point, I would like to devote a
 few minutes to a discussion of an amend-
 ment to the Mutual Security Act of 1959
 which I proposed in the Committee on
 Foreign Affairs, and which was adopted
 by the committee and approved by the
 House.
 I am referring to the amendment to
 section 400(c) of the mutual security
 law, which authorizes the President to
 use foreign currencies, credited to the
 United States from the sale of our farm
 surplus commodities and under certain
 other programs, for medical research
 and treatment centers founded or spon-
 sored abroad by American citizens. This
 amendment, in a clarified form, is in-
 cluded in the conference report.
 I would like to begin with  a. brief
 background of this amendment.
 Several months ago, I was invited to
 join a national committee organized for
 the purpose of realizing the construction,
 In Cracow, Poland, of a hospital for chil-
 dren's  diseases.  This  committee,  the
 American Research Hospital for Chil-
 dren in Poland Committee, includes a
 number of outstanding Americans.
 Among them are the Honorable Ave-
 rell Harriman, former Governor of the
 State of New York; Hon. Percival F.
 Brundage, former Director of the Bu-
 reau of the Budget; Hon. Harrison A.
 Williams, U.S. Senator from New Jersey;
 Hon. Walter H. Judd, Member -of Con-
 gress from Minnesota;  Mr. Norman
 Cousins, editor of Saturday Review; Mr.
 Gardner Cowles, publisher of Cowles
 magazines; Very Reverend Msgr. Aloy-

 CofYittee. ,   o " organization has pre-
 pared the desins for the proposed hos-
 pital, and he "has expended considerable
 effort on behalf of this project.
 Dr,. Froward A. Rusk, director of phys-
 ical rehabilitation at the New York
 Hospital,arid associate editor of the New
 York Times, serves as a special consult-
 ant to the committee.
 The project envisioned by the commit-
 tee involves the construction of a re-
 search. ,hospital in childrens' diseases,
 of approximately 200 beds, in Cracow,
 Poland, This hospital, made possible by
 private contributions and Polish zlotys
 sredited to our; Government, would serve
 as a living testimonial of the friendship
 of the people "of the United States for
 the people of l {land.  It would become
 a part of the 'Medical Academy of the
 t1nlver ity of Cracow, which university
 Id1U celebrate its 600th anniversary in
 1963  It .tt the fond hope of all inter-
 ested Sersons that the project may be
 completed In tfine'to be presented to the
 people ,6f i nland during the Cracow Uni-
 yerity's, 600th anniversary ceremonies.
 'The cost of this project has been esti-
 mated ata pproximately$4 million. The
 American'esearch Hospital for Chil-
 dred in Poland Committee hopes to raise
 $1.5 million through voluntary contri-
 butions in the United States.  In addi-
 tion, the equivalent of $2.5 million in
 zlotys will be needed to pay for services,
 labor, and materials purchased in Po-
 land.
 This is a constructive and humanitar-
 Ian project.  The need for such medical
 facilities in Poland is extremely great.
 It is particularly pressing in Cracow,
 where even the passage of time and in-
 dustrialization have done little to allevi-
 ate the tragic consequences and the
 ravages of war.  The children in Poland
 are still suffering sickness and miseries
 of the postwar period, and, according to
 reports from reliable people who have
 surveyed the situation, medical facilities
 available to them are most inadequate.
 What could be finer, more construc-
 tive, and more humanitarian on our part
 than to extend a helping hand to the
 suffering children of Poland by aiding
 in the construction of this proposed hos-
 pital?  The bonds of friendship between
 the people of the United States and the
 people of Poland.are of long standing.
 Sons of Poland fought for our freedom in
 the Revolutionary War, and Americans
 of Polish descent have contributed sub-
 tantially, over the years, to the develop-
 ment of our continent, and to the eco-
 nomic and cultural progress of our Na-
 tion.  Then, too, the people of Poland
 have long shared our love for liberty and
 democracy.  To this very day, In spite
 of Communist domination, the people of
 Poland retain their deep-seated respect
 for the ideals of freedom and independ-
 ence which we cherish so greatly.
 I fully concurred with the American
 Research Hospital for Children in Poland
 Committee that this project warrants
 and deserves the support and aid of our
 Government.  I have already described
 the need for this hospital in children's
 diseases.  Further, the sponsoring com-
 mittee has been organized, the plans for
 the hospital prepared, and the cost has
 been estimated.  The initial steps have
 been taken to raise through voluntary
 contributions, the dollars necessary to
 cover part of the expense.  This is,
 therefore, a clearly outlined, positive,
 and going project.
 The project does, however, need help,
 particularly with respect to the portion
 of construction expenses which will be
 incurred in Poland.  Those expenses can
 be paid in zlotys, and will be equivalent
 to approximately $2.5 million.
 Several months ago, the Honorable
 FRANK THOMPSON, Jr., of New Jersey,
 prepared a draft of a bill to provide for
 Government assistance to this project.
 Legislation on this subject was subse-
 quently introduced in the House of Rep-
 resentatives.- This, legislative proposal,
 in a modified form, became the core of
 the amendment which I offered to sec-
 tion 400(c) of the mutual security law.
 Under my amendment, the President
 will be authorized to use foreign cur-
 rencies credited to the United States,
 and appropriated from time to time, to
 aid medical research centers sponsored
 abroad by American citizens.  It was
 my specific intent, endorsed by the Com-
 mittee on Foreign Affairs, by the House
 of Representatives, and by the conferees
 on the mutual security bill of 1959, that
 the proposed research hospital for chil-
 dren's diseases in Cracow, Poland, be
 aided by our Government under the au-
 thority provided in this amendment.
 I am particularly pleased that, under
 this amendment, we will be able to con-
 tinue our efforts to use our farm sur-
 pluses in a constructive way.  We have
 been trying to reduce those surpluses-
 which cost the American taxpayers an
 estimated million. dollars a day in stor-
 age fees alone-for several years.  By
 using foreign currency accrued from the
 sale of those surpluses to aid the con-
 struction of the childrens' hospital in
 Cracow, we will be turning our abun-
 dance of food into a blessing for the suf-
 fering children of Poland.
 'There is one last point that I want to
 The type of assistance made available
 for the childrens' hospital in Cracow is
 fully consistent with the objectives of
 U.S. foreign policy. This assistance has
 the basic purpose of advancing better
 understanding and friendly relations be-
 tween the people of the United Ctates
 and  the  anti-Communist  people  of
 Poland.  It is intended to demonstrate
 to the freedom loving peoples every-
 where that the central objective of U.S.
 foreign policy is to foster the attainment
 of peace in. the world, and to aid and
 assist others in their efforts to conquer
 disease and to improve their level of
 living.
 Mr. Speaker, I am making this state-
 ment for the RECORD, so that the legis-
 lative history of my amendment to sec-
 tion 400(c) of the mutual security law
 may clearly indicate congressional in-
 tent to aid the proposed American Ile-
 search Hospital for Children in Poland
 under the authority given the President
 in this provision.
 Mr. McDOWELL.  Mr. Speaker, as a
 member of the Foreign Affairs Commit-
 tee of the House of Representatives I
 had the pleasure of supporting my col-
 league the gentleman from Wisconsin
 [Mr. ZABLOCKII, who offered the amend-
 ment to use foreign currencies, credited
 to the United States for our surplus farm
 products, to establish centers devoted to
 medical research and treatment which
 are founded by American citizens.
 It seems to me that this is a historic
 and significant use for these currencies.
 It is particularly significant that one of
 the first hospitals which may be estab-
 lished pursuant to this legislation will
 be located in Cracow, Poland, because at
 this very moment Poland seems to be the
 object of a considerable amount of woo-
 ing on the part of the leaders of the
 U.S.S.R.  Poland undoubtedly has been
 successful in freeing herself from com-
 plete and absolute domination and con-
 trol by the U.S.S.R. just as Yugoslavia
 was successful in doing some years ear-
 lier. And a hospital there could -play a
 major role in further loosening Poland
 from the web, indeed the shroud, which,
 the U.S.S.R. is so busily weaving for the
 proud and history-conscious peoples of
 Poland who throughout history have
 fiercely resisted and fought against for-
 eign masters.
 It seems to me that here is indeed al-
 most a revolutionary instrument for the
 cause of freedom which the United
 States can wield in the cause of mankind
 throughout the world.
 Under this amendment, as has been
 pointed out by our able colleague from
 Wisconsin [Mr. ZABLOCKII, the President
 will be authorized to use foreign cur-
 rencies credited to the United, States,,
 and appropriated from time to time, to
 aid medical research centers sponsored
 abroad by American citizens.
 There is offered us, through this
 amendment, the golden opportunity to
 use our farm surpluses constructively in
 the cause of peace.
 There is a growing awareness of the
 importance of using surplus food for
 peace, and what we as a nation can do
 to advance the cause of free men every-
 where by this means.
 We are blessed as no other nation has
 ever. been through the long history of
 mankind with food in abundance.
 What a blessing this is, and, at the
 same time, what a fearful responsibility
 it is to use it wisely and well.
 No other nation in the world at this
 time has food in abundance and a sur-
 plus of food.
 The U.S.S.R. is a food deficit nation, its
 vast and much-advertised agricultural
 program is well known to be an almost
 total flop.
 Too few Americans appreciate the full
 sweep of the possibilities open to us to

 zation of American States for the pro-
 tection of American states against ex-
 ternal aggression."  If the funds were
 not used for that purpose, then they had
 to go into the special assistance account
 to promote economic development in
 Latin America. This seemed to us to be
 an unwise idea. Latin Americans have
 not expressed any desire to have any
 such Western Hemisphere armed force.
 How large a force would it be?  How
 would it be constituted and organized?
 Where would it be stationed?    Who
 would command it?  Setting aside funds
 now for such a nonexistent force would
 not in our opinion improve the security
 of the Western Hemisphere.  As for
 using the additional $30 billion for eco-
 nomic  assistance,                                                                                                   only  two  Latin
 American countries need grant assist-
 ance, and they are taken care of in the
 present program.   The  others need
 loans, but they can get loans from exist-
 ing loaning agencies.                                                                                              The Other body
 receded and the conference report spee-
 ifles that military assistance funds for
 Latin America for this year shall not
 exceed the amounts used for this pur-
 pose last year.
 Again, they had an authorization In
 their bill that up to 30 percent of the
 funds in "Title I, Military Assistance,"
 could be transferred by the President
 to other titles.  This would mean that
 more than $400 million could be trans-
 ferred here or there as the President
 pleased.  It could make a shambles of
 the military assistance program, and it
 would make a farce of the military as-
 sistance programing and of presenta-
 tions before our appropriations commit-
 tees. The House had rejected this same
 provision in an amendment offered by
 the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. ADAm1
 and we persuaded the other body to
 accept our position.
 Again, in several places in the other
 body's bill, funds were to be made avail-
 able without going through the appro-
 priation process.  The House conferees
 insisted on its position and the other
 body eventually agreed.
 As you recall we had a provision in
 our bill setting up an Inspector General
 and Comptroller, in order to focus in
 one place responsibility for supervising
 the accounting and the checking of end
 use of all forms of assistance.  The In-
 spector General is to be responsible only
 to the Under Secretary of State, so he
 could get around bureaucratic attempts
 to hide mistakes or waste, and do some-
 thing about situations that needed cor-
 recting.  Complaints will go to him
 about things being badly handled or
 mismanaged. One difficulty in the past
 has been that when conscientious em-
 ployees have protested, their protests
 have sometimes been smothered.  Con-

 tention to it, he has got to investigate
 and correct, if needed, or else be held
 accountable by us. The State Depart-
 ment did not want this Inspector Gen-
 eral, but the House put it in and it Is
 in the conference report. We think it
 can be the most important step we have
 taken In years to try to correct mistakes,
 errors, abuses and, frankly, corruption
 in certain instances.  These cases in-
 volve only a very small percentage of
 the total operations, but they are what
 give the whole program a black eye with
 the public and with the Congress.
 Mr.,, GROSS,  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr ~rUDD.  I yield.
 Ml' GIOSS.. Would this Inspector
 General, ins anyway circumscribe the
 Comptroller General if he tried to go
 into thee questions?
 Mr..JUDD.. No; it would not. If the
 ?gentleni li . will look at page 10 of the
 bill and~pages $I and 33 of the committee
 report, he will see that we have made it
 perfectly clear that this Inspector Gen-
 oral has tq coordinate his work with that
 of the Comptroller General. The Comp-
 troller  eneral is the agent of the Con-
 gress , We can send him to investigate
 what we  an        inspector General
 will be the chef tag of the Department
 of State t police its own mutual assist-
 anee operations.;, and also to advise and
 c rsult J, Itb .the Defense Department re-
 gardin  is operations in this field.
 Mr. At'. Mr. Speaker, will the gen-
 tleman yield?
 Mr JUD    T
 I r. U4   Yiil the gentleman please
 explain w   in, providing for the com-
 pensation of 'the office of the Inspector
 General, and Cojilptroller, instead of
 making, the expenses of his office pay-
 able out- of the, general expense fund
 where there would besome control over
 it, it is provided.. that these expenses
 should be paid ot of the field funds
 without any check and without any limi-
 tation?
 Mr. it3pI). The reason is this: if this
 officer's funds, corm out of the adminis-
 trative Rinds, fie can be frozen out. We
 have seen that l aapen in- the past.
 Xf we E1 a et1 ejuuds for this officer
 and his, f a#I available out of the program
 funds fhemae_Tvea it _will prevent his
 being: smothered by.. the bureaucrats
 whale work lie ii inspecting, to the point
 where he,cairiot really, do a good job.
 Mr`. GAMY'. !%e bill does not provide
 any limitation at all.  Should there not
 be a limitation as to the amount of funds
 that he can expend in his work?
 Mr. JUDD. The gentleman ys correct
 that the bill does not provide any limita-
 tion. I really think that probably more
 of the funds ought to be spent on inspec-
 tion than in the past. When we are deal-
 Ing with operations involving $372 billion
 spread all over the world, and we have
 used only a tiny fraction of that for ad-
 ministration, I think we have invited
 some of the very irregularities, about
 which we are unhappy.
 Mr. PASSMAN. Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. JUDD.  I yield to the gentleman
 from Louisiana.
 Mr. PASSMAN. That is a tremendous
 increase in the amount for administra-
 tive expenses for the ICA.  Would the
 gentleman agree-that there should be
 some type of limitation on the amount
 of money that this new Inspector General
 expends for travel and entertainment?
 Mr. JUDD.  No; I do not think we
 ought to have any limitation on this new
 officer except the limitation of the funds
 that are in the bill, because I don't know
 what the limitation should be.  If Mr.
 Dillon, Under Secretary of State for Eco-
 nomic Affairs, sees fit to use more of the
 program funds for inspection and polic-
 ing rather than for just programs, I
 think that is a good thing to do, at least
 for  this  year,  on  an  experimental
 basis.
 Mr. PASSMAN.  In other words, the
 gentleman does not believe there should
 be any limitation as to what this gentle-
 man could and should spend?
 Mr. JUDD.  That is correct, because
 we are not in any position as yet to know
 what a reasonable limitation would be.
 This is a new function, and I think the
 Inspector General's problem is going to
 be to get enough funds from the De-
 partment.  I am not worried about his
 getting too much. It will not take any
 more out of the taxpayers' pockets, if
 he does use more.
 Mr. PASSMAN.  Is this program out
 of the taxpayers' money?
 Mr. JUDD.  Yes.
 Mr. PASSMAN.  So it would come out
 of the pockets of the taxpayers?
 Mr. JUDD.  Certainly, but it will not
 be additional funds out of their pockets.
 If there is more for inspection, there is
 that much less for operations.  I think
 more of the funds should go into the
 policing of the operations, rather than
 continue to be used all for more of the
 same kind of operations that have been
 wasteful.
 Mr. PASSMAN.  Does the gentleman
 have a precedent for establishing a posi-
 tion of this kind without any limitation
 on expenditures?
 Mr. JUDD.  Yes. In the State De-
 partment basic legislation there is pro-
 vision for an Inspector in the Foreign
 Service.  He has even greater authority
 than this man will have.  He can go
 into a post and suspend a person or sus-
 pend anoperation on his own authority,
 subject to the decision of the Secretary.
 I read that act and there is no limita-
 tion on the amount of money available
 for the Inspector in the Foreign Service.
 Mr. PASSMAN.  It is rather loose,
 and the sky is the limit?
 Mr. JUDD.  No; the sky is not the
 limit.  There is only so much money
 provided in the whole bill.  Some can
 be used for administrtion and some can
 be used for programs.  Do you not want
 to use more of the money for policing
 programs that we are criticing?
 Mr. PASSMAN.  Oh, we know the
 same gentleman is going to run it.
 Mr. JUDD.  The gentleman to whom
 my friend is perhaps referring discovered
 on his own almost everything wrong
 brought out by the gentleman's commit-
 tee and by the Hardy committee, as well
 as our own committee. This gentleman
 reported these things that were wrong,
 r      -July 22
 he protested, but the protest was buried.
 We want to correct that situation. Un-
 der this new setup, he will.have full
 responsibility and if he does not take
 care of it, he will be held accountable.
 Mr. BENTLEY.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. JUDD.  I yield to the gentleman
 from Michigan.
 Mr. BENTLEY.  Will the gentleman
 explain to the House this section 101:
 Programs of military assistance subsequent
 to  the  fiscal year  1960  program shall be
 budgeted so as to come into competition for
 financial support with other activities and
 programs of the Department of Defense.
 Mr. JUDD.  This is amodification of
 language that was put in by the other
 body.  The purpose is to test out the
 statement made again and again by our
 military leaders that mutual security is
 part and parcel of our defense, it is just
 as important as our own Armed Forces.
 For the next 2 years they will have to
 bring in a defense budget with one part
 of it, or one title or one chapter of it, for
 military assistance, alongside its requests
 for our own Military Establishment.  If
 they ask more for military assistance to
 others, they will have to take more out
 of their own funds.  We will find out
 whether they really believe that military
 assistance is part and parcel of our de-
 fense and just as important as their own
 flattops, planes, or submarines.
 Mr. Speaker, one of the two maj or
 items of compromise was the Develop-
 ment Loan Fund. The other body had
 authorized $750 million this year and
 the second year's authorization of $1,250
 million. - The conferees compromised on
 $700 million for fiscal year 1960 and
 $1,100 million for fiscal year 1961-a re-
 duction of $200 million.
 The other was the Senate provision
 giving continuing authorization without
 limitation for appropriations for military
 assistance. The House conferees reject-
 ed any such permanent authorization
 and got the Senate to accept a continu-
 ing authorization for the next 2 fiscal
 years- on an experimental basis.  We
 make clear in our statement that the
 legislative committees will review the
 military assistance programs as in the
 past, we will have a military assistance
 title in our bill each year just as now,
 and we will legislate as heretofore on
 all matters of policy. In1962 the whole
 program will come back to us for what-
 ever action we decide on as the result
 of the experiment.
 Many Members have favored complete
 separation of military and economic as-
 sistance.  This will give partial separa-
 tion for 2 years. I believe it is a reason-
 able compromise.
 Mr. MORGAN.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
 minutes to the gentleman from Mon-
 tana [Mr. ANDERSON].
 (Mr. ANDERSON of Montana asked
 and was given permission to revise and
 extend his remarks.)
 Mr. ANDERSON of Montana.  Mr.
 Speaker, I want to defend the American
 mutual security program in Vietnam.
 I visited Vietnam last November, and I
 speak against the backdrop of what I
 learned on the ground.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE                     12777
 Of course, we want to get the most
 out of our mutual security dollar. But
 let us remember the devastation wracked
 on this little country by the Commu-
 nists-let us remember the heroism with
 which they have rolled back the Com-
 munists in Southeast Asia.
 Certainly a sensation seeking reporter
 can go into any operation, military, gov-
 erment-yes, or private business-and
 advertise for the troublemakers and dis-
 sidents to air their beefs; and in any
 operation, including almost any big busi-
 ness you care to name, he can come out
 with a story more sensational than the
 one currently being aired on Vietnam.
 Mr. Speaker, I spent some time in
 Vietnam, and I have studied the situa-
 tion there. I want to express my opinion
 that we have gotten more than cur
 money's worth for the dollars spent in
 Vietnam to halt the spread of commu-
 nism in Southeast Asia.  General Wil-
 liams, chief of JUSMAAG in Vietnam,
 has done an outstanding job of building
 an efficient military machine that wi11
 do the job there. He has created from
 nothing one of the best small armies in
 Asia, and it is 100 percent anti-Commu-
 nist.  General Williams has worked
 miracles, but at the same time he has
 been vigilant and dedicated as -a watch-
 dog over the dollars spent in military aid
 in Vietnam.  Newspaper accounts are
 guilty of inaccurate reporting when they
 allege that our expenditures are not
 properly supervised.
 The aid to Vietnam has of necessity
 been largely directed toward establishing
 a military force capable of defending this
 little  country.  The  officers  of  the
 MAAG, under General Williams' ex-
 tremely competent direction, have estab-
 lished a very close, working relationship
 with the Vietnamese Government and
 actively assist not only in the prepara-
 tion of the Vietnamese military budget,
 but in supervising the execution of that
 budget.  The relationship between t:he
 Vietnamese Government officials and the
 MAAG is possibly as close and fruitful as
 any such relationship in the world.
 When MAAG-Vietnam started its opera-
 tions, the Vietnamese Government had
 not had experience in preparing budgets
 or supervising the expenditure of funds,
 and the Government has accepted whole-
 heartedly the guidance of the American
 officers in establishing effective controls
 on the use not only of the U.S. money,
 but of the Vietnamese funds.
 In addition, the American officers ad-
 vise on the training and the logistical op-
 erations of the Vietnamese armed forces
 from the highest level in defense down
 to and including the combat battalions,
 and they have established controls and
 records utilizing the most modern cost-
 saving methods.
 When I was in Vietnam last year, I had
 an opportunity to observe this small but
 highly efficient army which has operated
 under difficult conditions.  The country-
 side still has Communist bands supplied
 and directed from the North, operating
 against not only the Vietnamese Gov-
 ernment, but the American personnel
 helping the Vietnamese.      When I was
 there, I noticed the protection provided
 to me and was impressed with the efforts
 the Vietnamese made to safeguard those
 who are trying to help them.  The Com-
 munists have threatened and attempted
 on numerous occasions to assassinate
 American personnel, and all Americans
 working in Vietnam know that they are
 in danger.  Numerous attempts on their
 lives have been made, but fortunately,
 so far, only two Americans have died at
 the hands of Communist agents.  These
 two men, Maj. Dale R. Buis and M. Sgt.
 Chester M. Ovnand, gave their lives as
 much for the free world in Vietnam as
 they would have on the battlefields of
 Korea.  Attempts to make such people
 appear as living too well are ill advised.
 During the last 5 fiscal years, exclud-
 ing the months of April, May, and June,
 1959, for which figures are not yet avail-
 able, the ICA has shown expenditures
 of $922,651,000 in Vietnam, which, if
 broken down, would probably show two-
 thirds going to defense support to in-
 clude the pay and allowance of Viet-
 namese troops, construction of barracks,
 and similar items. The remainder, prob-
 ably not exceeding $50 million a year,
 has been directed towards the economic
 development of the country.  Notable
 progress has been made in opening the
 road net closed by years of war so that
 commerce could again move.      With
 American help, nearly a million refugees
 from the Communist terror are $eing
 resettled' in South Vietnam, new lands
 are being cultivated and old lands re-
 opened.  This is particularly praise-
 worthy when one considers the lots of
 refugees in other parts of the world,
 such as the Middle East. American help
 has also brought new crops to Vietnam
 to permit a diversification of the old
 two-crop agricultural system. Fisheries
 have been established, providing liveli-
 hood for additional people, reducing the
 price of food, and creating a new export
 commodity.
 The United States has assisted in the
 importing of equipment to renovate the
 industries destroyed during the long war
 and to establish new ones. In this cate-
 gory one finds textiles, plastics, clothing
 manufacture, rubber and tire processing,
 power generating facilities, assembly
 plants  for  vehicles,  pharmaceutical
 processing plants, numerous secondary
 processing industries, and new home
 handicraft industries.
 An industrial development center has
 been established looking forward to still
 further industrial expansion, and con-
 siderable aid has been given in the field
 of education, including the training of
 teachers,  providing  equipment  for
 schools, and general advice to the Viet-
 namese Ministry of Education.
 Despite all these advances, made un-
 der the brillant leadership of President
 Ngo Dinh Diem, it is true that Vietnam
 must look to the free world for con-
 tinuing assistance for some years to
 come. As a principal bastion of the free
 world, she must maintain forces ade-
 quate to defend herself and to act as a
 deterrent to Communist onslaughts in
 southeast Asia.  The very presence of
 this force in being has created the sta-
 bility that exists in Indochina, and it is
 interesting to note that the only place
 in the world where a Communist-occu-
 pled area has been recovered by the free
 world is in Indochina.  The two north-
 ern provinces of Laos were once under
 Communist rule, and only very recently
 has the free government of Laos been
 able to reestablish its control.
 The United States is currently assist-
 ing South Vietnam in establishing a
 number of small radio stations and one
 medium-size station near the border of
 Communist North Vietnam, in an at-
 tempt to counteract the powerful and
 effective radio propaganda emanating
 from Communist North Vietnam and
 from Communist China.  In Phnom
 Penh, Cambodia, there is now a powerful
 transmitter, given to the Cambodian
 Government by Communist China, with
 Communist technicians  operating  it,
 which comes strongly into South Viet-
 nam with all its criticisms of the Viet-
 namese Government. From North Viet-
 nam come also the powerful transmis-
 sions of the Communist forces, and there
 are many places in Vietnam where today
 only the voice of Vietnam's enemies can
 be heard. Radio Hanoi is now broadcast-
 ing the most violent hate America cam-
 paign, including such vile inventions as
 the story that American officers use help-
 less women and children as machine gun
 targets and for bayonet practice.  It is
 essential that we move fast in assisting
 the Vietnamese in counteracting this sit-
 uation, for Radio Hanoi in North Viet-
 nam is joining Peking and Moscow as one
 of the three most powerful stations in the
 world.
 Negotiations are underway in ICA,
 Washington, for purchase and delivery of
 a 50,000 watt medium wave station to be
 constructed in Hue in the northern por-
 tion of South Vietnam. This station will
 enable the South Vietnam Government
 to influence sympathetic Vietnamese
 north of the 17th parallel and counter
 the enemy propaganda.
 In the Far East a grim struggle con-
 tinues against communism, in Taiwan
 Straits, in Indonesia, in Burma. In this
 struggle Vietnam represents the only
 clearcut major victory for the free world
 ill the last 5 years. This is an aid pro-
 gram which has paid dividends far be-
 yond expectations and the United States
 can be proud of the results. Any efforts
 to diminish or disrupt this assistance
 could well lead to disaster not only to us
 but to the entire free world. I honestly
 believe Vietnam can be properly used as
 as example of how we should assist other
 new countries.
 Mr. MORGAN.  Mr. Speaker, I yield
 3  minutes  to  the  gentleman  from
 Michigan [Mr. BENTLEY].
 Mr. BENTLEY. Mr. Speaker, my re-
 marks should under no circumstances be
 taken as criticizing the conferees on the
 part of the House who, I am sure, did
 the best job capable in conference with
 the members from the other body on
 this bill.  Nevertheless, I point out the
 rather remarkable fact that the House
 authorized a figure of $3,542,600,000, the
 Senate amendment to the House bill was
 less than $1 million in excess of that,
 and the conferees then came. up with a
 figure of $3,556,200,000 which is higher
 than the authorization figure either as
 it passed the House or as it passed the

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE                   July 22
 Senate. I suppose that is possible, but it
 is rather remarkable, I think, that the
 conferees did increase the authorization
 figure of the bill both as it passed the
 House and also as it passed the Senate.
 I would also like to point out to Mem-
 bers that in addition to the $3.5 plus bil-
 lion contained in the conference author-
 isation, there is, for the purposes of the
 Developlnent I,oan Fund, an additional
 authorization of $1.1 billion to be ad-
 vanced7 prior to July 1, 1961.  So, as I
 say, we are faced with an additional 2-
 year authorization for this program in
 excess of this $3.5 billion plus figure
 which we are considering today.
 Mr. BURLESON.  Mr. Speaker, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. BENTLEY. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Texas.
 Mr. BURLESON.  I take it that ex-
 plains why the conferees have actually
 agreed 'on a greater amount than that
 approved,, by the House or the other
 body.
 Mr. BENTLEY.  No.  I think, If the
 gentleman from Texas will look at these
 figures, he will find that the figure as -
 approved by the conferees is in excess
 (?t .both the Senate and the House figure
 even without that $1.1 billion to be
 authorized over the next 2 years:
 Mr.  "BUFtLESON.  The  gentleman
 was complimentary to our conferees. I
 am complimentary to the conferees, and
 as. I look at"_ this report, which I have
 not pact, time to study, it seems to me
 that `the conferees on the part of the
 House have done all the yielding. Here
 Is 6. total flgilre in this report that is in
 . excess o f the House or the Senate figure.
 I just did not know that was done, but
 It is.
 Mr $DNY"f,F,,Y,  I prefer to yield to
 the chairman if he desires to refer to
 that fact.
 Mr. MORGIAll. Of course, if the gen-
 tleman. will examine the table in the
 confer" eilce report, he will see, item by
 item, that the conferees stayed within
 the limitations of the two bills.
 Mr." l        4.  But then how was
 the fixl  fig re in excess of both au-
 thgrizations, Mr. Chairman? 11 ?.Mr. MORGAN. The final figure was
 in excess because the compromise fig-
 ures-arrived at added up that way.
 Mr.,BZN'X LEY. But it is not included
 In:this $l.1 billion adi ance authorization
 foil. tale pevelopment Loan Fund, is it?
 Mr`. MORGAN.      No.  That is not in-
 Mr. BENTLEY. i thank the gentle-
 man. As I say, I am sure the conferees
 of the House did the best job they could
 with the bill that passed the House, but
 obviously,those of us who opposed the
 bill in the House would have no reason
 for changing our position now with this
 conference report.
 I thank the gentleman.
 Mr. MORGAN.  Mr. Speaker, I yield
 such time as she may desire to the gentle-
 woman from Ohio [Mrs. BOLTON].
 Mrs.  BOLTON. Mr.  Speaker,  the
 House can be proud of the works of its
 conference committee. It was a difficult
 conference, starting with 56 points in
 disagreement.  It ended with all Im-
 portant differences resolved in our favor.
 No conference is ever entirely one-sided,
 there has to be some give and take, es-
 pecially when most of the take Is on our
 side.  That our conferees were such ex-
 cellent traders is something we can feel
 extremely pleased with the results.  I
 congratulate the chairman and those
 who accompanied him and this House
 for having men of tact, patience, and wis-
 dom to serve on the conference com-
 mittee for the mutual security bill.
 (Mrs. BOLTON asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend her re-
 marks.)                    -
 Mr. MORGAN.  Mr. Speaker, I yield
 such time as he may desire to the gen-
 tleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Mc-
 CORMACK].
 Mr. McCORMACK.  Mr. Speaker, I
 ask unanimous consent that the Com-
 mittee on Rules may have until midnight
 tonight to file certain reports.
 The SPEAKER.  Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from Mas-
 sachusetts?
 There was no objection.
 Mr. MORGAN.   Mr; Speaker, I yield
 8 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
 ginia [Mr. GARY].
 Mr. GARY.  Mr. Speaker, what I have
 to say is certainly not to be construed as
 any criticism of the conferees on the
 part of the House. I think they have
 dor! the best job that they could.  I
 particularly desire to commend them for
 their success in eliminating from the
 bill all direct borrowing from the Treas-
 ury, which has been frequently referred
 to on this floor as the back-door ap-
 proach to the Treasury, because I think
 that was one of the most dangerous fea-
 tures of the bill.  Iri my judgment it is
 one of the most dangerous tendencies
 that we are facing in the Congress to-
 day, and I know that some of the Mem-
 bers of the other body were very in-
 sistent on that approach in this bill.
 I do want to call attention, however,
 to two things in the bill.  I have always
 voted for the mutual security bill, al-
 though I have tried to hold the appro-
 priations down to a reasonable mini-
 mum.  I find it difficult now, however,
 to convince myself that this is the time
 for new programs.  It seems to me that
 the time has come when the program
 should be tapering off, and we should be
 cutting down activities instead of em-
 barking on new programs. Yet, there
 are two entirely new programs in this
 bill.  One is to be found on page 11,
 International Cooperation in Health.
 We did not have that in the House bill.
 It never came before the House.  Yet
 here we are entering upon a brandnew
 program without a committee of the
 House having  had  any opportunity
 whatever to study it, to consider it, to
 pass upon it.
 We are  already  spending  approxi-
 mately $85 million a year for health ac-
 tivities under this program.                                                          We con-
 tribute nearly $5 million a year to the
 World  Health    Organization of  the
 United Nations.  Now this new program
 is proposed.  Let me read it to you:
 The Congress of the United States recog-
 nizes that large areas of the world are being
 ravaged by diseases and other health defi-
 ciencies which are causing widespread suf-
 fering, debility, and death, and are seriously
 deterring the efforts of peoples in such areas
 to develop their resources and productive ca-
 pacities and to Improve their living condi-
 tions. The Congress also recognizes that in-
 ternational efforts are needed to assist such
 peoples in bringing diseases and other health
 deficiencies under control, in preventing
 their spread or reappearance, and in elimi-
 nating their basic causes.  Accordingly, the
 Congress affirms that it is the policy of the
 United States to accelerate its efforts to en-
 courage and support international coopera-
 tion in programs directed toward the con-
 quest of diseases and other health defi-
 ' ciencies.
 It is true they do not ask for any direct
 appropriation to implement the pro-
 gram, but they do provide that $2 million
 may be taken from the contingency fund.
 We have heard how costly socialized
 medicine is in England.  I am afraid
 once we begin this program, we will soon
 be trying to establish a program of so-
 cialized medicine for the entire world.
 I think it is a very dangerous step.
 In the second place, section 601 pro-
 vides-and here is another new program :
 The purpose of this chapter is to promote
 better relations and understanding between
 the United States and the nations of Asia
 and the Pacific (hereinafter referred to as
 "the East") through cooperative study and
 research, by establishing in Hawaii a Center
 for Cultural and Technical Interchange Be-
 tween East and West, either as a branch of
 an existing institution of higher learning
 or as a separate institution, where scholars
 and students, in various fields from the na-
 tions of the East and the Western World
 may meet, study, exchange Ideas and views,
 and conduct other activities primarily in
 support of the objectives of the U.S. Infor-
 mation and Educational Exchange Act of
 1948, as amended, and title III of chapter
 II of the Mutual Security Act of 1954 ands
 other acts promoting the international edu-
 cational, cultural, and related activities of
 the United States.
 That contemplates the establishment
 of a school.  It contemplates grants,
 fellowships, and scholarships and various
 other inducements, because, the law says,
 we must make it attractive so people will
 attend the school.
 I submit, Mr. Speaker, that if we are
 going to embark upon programs of this
 kind, at least they should have the con-
 sideration and the study of a House
 committee.  That has not been done in
 this instance.
 Mr. BAILEY.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. GARY.  I yield.
 Mr. BAILEY.  I should like to ask the
 gentleman this question, since he par-
 ticipated in redrafting section 505(b)
 when this legislation was before the
 House.  Just what changes are made in
 the Senate version of this proposal to
 divert the payment of interest and prin-
 cipal on loans that now are coming into
 the Treasury to  the Redevelopment
 Fund, in counterpart funds?  Just what
 did the Senate do to the House bill in
 that respect?
 Mr. GARY.  It is my understanding
 that the use of any funds now has to be
 authorized by the Congress under regu-
 lar appropriation procedures.  They are
 not permitted to use those funds unless
 they are so authorized in appropriation
 bills.  The chairman of the committee
 has so stated.

 tain visas charged against the quota allotted
 to the country of their forebears.         In 1958
 North and South America contributed 9.1,827
 nonquota  immigrants.  Subtracting       this
 number from the 253,000-odd who entered
 we find that 161,438 quota and nonquota
 immigrants from Europe and Asia joined us
 in the last year *  * * against a quota of
 about 155,000.  Had the quotas been filled
 our total for 1953 would have been 306,000.
 What are some of the legislative proposals
 now being pushed so hard in Congress?
 Some of the most prominent measures
 would provide that unused quotas be reallo-
 cated on a prorata basis to other countries.
 This would immediately mean that our Im-
 migration would be increased by more than
 50,000 annually * * * taking us over the
 300,000 figure.
 But that is not all.  Some of the promi-
 nent proposals would change the 1920 cen-
 sus base for the national origins quota sys-
 tem to the 1950 census which would mean
 an increase in the quotas by about 65,000.
 This, added to the present quota of about
 155,000, would total 220,000.
 So, the two proposals * * * reallocation of
 unused quotas-53,000 * * * and the new
 quota increase of 65,000, would add 116,000
 to the present rate of immigration, or an
 annual total of 371,000.
 Now watch this: In addition to the fore-
 going there is strong urging in Congress that
 we set up a permanent refugee program to
 provide for an additional 60,000 per year-
 over and above the potential 371,000 already
 discussed.  This  makes  a  new  total  of
 431,000.
 Even  this    is  not  enough.  Aided by  a
 White House Conference on Refugees, ea:rlier
 this year which represents the United States'
 part in a "World Refugee Year," it is urged
 that  Congress    provide  for  an additional
 20,000 refugees during the next 2 years, for
 a grand total of 451,000.  The World Refugee
 Year program is now being propagandized
 all over the United States.
 All the proponents of this type legislation
 point to the need for the United States to do
 its share in accepting and encouraging the
 immigration of refugees and those from the
 overpopulated areas. All claim that it will be
 for the good of America, economically, sc-
 cially, and from a foreign relations point of
 view. None appears to worry about our abil-
 ity to absorb the extra immigration.
 Population statisticians now estimate that
 the U.S. population in the year 2000 will be
 from 330 to 350 million.  Presumably that is
 based on natural growth plus the present
 immigration flow.  The year 2000 is only 41
 years ahead.  How will the-natural resources
 within our own borders stack up to the needs
 of that many people?  And what about the
 years after 2000?  Will the bare necessities
 of water and land be sufficient, or will we be
 like other overpopulated countries of the
 world?  Today the cry is for more schoob-
 more hospitals, and more of many other
 things that makes America the place that so
 many now want to come to.  Do weneeil to
 artificially increase our population by liber-
 .;ali23ng our Immigration policies?
 Have you ever done the arithmetic to..flgure
 'our What e8'ect,lsnznigration has on the pop-
 ulation, growth of this country?  The current
 population growth in the United States is

 efforts in assisting the House District
 Committee in enacting H.R. 836, having

 Judge Kronheim and Judge Walsh
 called to my attention on numerous oc-
 casions the abuses of the Garnishee Act
 by certain merchants here in the District
 of Columbia.  I have learned after in-

 District of Columbia were making a col-

 court under the provisions of the pres-

 of any act on the statute- books that has

 1959                     CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                !J  12743
 Let us either extend the orphans' immi-
 gration program for a period of 1 year
 as it existed previously, in order that we
 may have the opportunity to study the
 matter further, or let us provide an
 amendment that is truly effective.
 In my opinion a truly effective amend-
 ment would be that of vesting the check
 of adoptive homes not in the Attorney
 General, but in the Department of
 Health, Education, and Welfare which is
 primarily concerned with the health and
 well-being of our Nation and wh;nch,
 with its regional offices and experience
 in functioning in cooperation with wel-
 fare agencies throughout the country
 and abroad, is best qualified to determine
 that the right children are placed in
 the right homes. It is true that innocent
 children brought here  from foreign
 countries deserve the same measure of
 protection as do those adopted children
 born in this country, and it is my sin-
 cere belief that the Department of
 Health, Education, and Welfare is best
 qualified to undertake this serious re-
 sponsibility.
 Mr. JAVITS.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. MORSE.   I. yield.
 Mr. JAVITS.  I entirely agree with
 the Senator from Oregon.  I very much
 hope that the conferees will pay serious
 attention to the human welfare issue
 which is involved, and will vest authority
 in the Department of Health, Education,
 and Welfare, if it is to be vested in any
 Government agency.
 Mr. MORSE.  I appreciate the sup-
 port. of the Senator from New York.
 The record should show that the Sen-
 ator from New York is a man who, from
 professional experience in this field,
 knows whereof he speaks.  I happen to
 know something about the record of
 the Senator from New York in connec-
 tion with the subject of adoption, and
 I am greatly gratified, and feel that my
 case has been greatly strengthened by
 the support of the Senator from New
 York.
 For the RECORD, Mr. President, this is
 the time for me to say this.  I wish to
 make very clear, in view of some of the
 mail I have received from my he me
 State, that the senior - Senator from
 Oregon is in no way seeking to prevent
 the great program of adoption of Korean
 war orphans which has been carried on
 by a fine family of humanitarians in
 my State, Mr. and Mrs. Holt.  For the
 past several years, they have gone. to
 Korea, and have adopted, by proxy for
 American adoption parents,    a large
 number of Korean orphans, many of
 whom, as I understand, in fact most of
 whom, are the children of American
 veterans who served in the Armed Forces
 in Korea.
 It has been said, Mr. President, be-
 cause the senior Senator from Oregon
 has supported the Department of Health,
 Education, and Welfare program for all
 adoptions that at least one of the adopt-
 ing parents see the child before he Or
 she in fact is adopted, that I am under-
 mining this great humanitarian pro-
 gram of the Holts.  That is not my in-
 tention.  However, in my judgment, I
 have a, duty as a U.S. Senator, to look
 at adoption policy problems nationwide,
 and do so without reference to any spe-
 cific individual program, wonderful as it
 may be, such as that the Holts have been
 conducting.  I have no doubt, that the
 Holts have been very successful in carry-
 ing out the desires of the adopting par-
 ents by selecting children the parents
 probably would have accepted anyway
 had they seen them in the first instance.
 In my opinion the, remedy is not to
 continue the proxy procedure indefi-
 nitely, but the remedy is to -work. out a
 procedure under which the Holts could
 bring the children to the United States
 and give the prospective parents an op-
 portunity to see them before the final
 adoption is arranged.  Thereafter, in a
 given case if a prospective adoting par-
 ent should say, "Well, I prefer not to
 have that child," every effort should be
 made to have some other prospective
 adopting parent see the child and adopt
 it in the United states.
 Mr. President, I think that has such
 a good procedural merit that it can be
 worked out.  However I do not believe
 we ought to sacrifice what the evidence
 shows very clearly is a needed general
 policy recommended by. government of-
 ficials simply because a magnificient job
 has been done by way of the proxy pro-
 cedure followed so successfully in re-
 spect to the Korean enterprise. Officials
 of the Government who have presented
 us evidence on this matter point, out
 that in regard to other adoptions there
 have been many cases which have not
 worked out as well as have the Holt
 adoptions.
 So I am suggesting to the chairman
 of the Judiciary Committee, first, that 1,
 in the conference he should try to get
 the House conferees to at least shift the
 so-called inspection function to the De-
 partment of Health, Education, and
 Welfare, because that is the agency of
 government which really has jurisdic-
 tion over our whole children's program.
 Second, I should like to have language
 in some way, somehow, written into- the
 bill, so that the kind of project the Holts
 are conducting can be carried on pro-
 cedurally by allowing them to bring the
 children over to the United States to
 some central point, such as San Francis-
 co or Portland, and then have the pro-
 spective adopting parents complete the
 adoption there on the basis of their in-
 spection of a given child, and their de-
 cision then that the child is one they
 really want.
 If a given child is rejected on this side
 of the water, I do not think there will
 be any difficulty in finding many other
 adopting parents who would be glad to
 have the particular child.  I think the
 officials of the Department of Health,
 Education, and Welfare are right in the
 position they have taken that there
 should be a general rule that at least
 one of the adopting parents ought to see
 the child before the adoption papers are
 completed.
 Mr. President, that is the burden of
 the argument I desired to make for the
 RECORD,  because my position is badly
 misunderstood in the State of Oregon on
 the part of those who feel that I 'should
 not be raising any question about proxy
 adoptions.
 lie policy, without at least one of the
 adopting parents seeing the particular
 child and agreeing to take it in my opin-
 ion lead to a great many mistakes and
 abuses, to which the Federal officials
 have already testified.
 I yield to the Senator from New York.
 Mr. JAVITS.  Mr. President, I merely
 desire to say to the Senator from
 Mississippi that I favor the Senate bill
 for a 1-year extension of the articula-
 tion of the rules within that time, be-
 cause we -really need to take it under
 consideration.  But I agree with my col-
 league from Oregon, if we must accept
 anything from the House, we should
 certainly vest the jurisdiction in the
 Department of Health, Education, and
 Welfare.,
 Mr. MORSE.  I agree, if we cannot
 have the 1-year extension.  That is what
 we passed in the Senate.    That is what
 I voted for.  If we cannot have the 1-
 year extension of the present program
 so that we can go into the procedural
 questions I have raised, then at least we
 ought to try to get an agreement that
 the Department of Health, Education,
 and Welfare will administer the program.
 I yield the floor.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 question is on agreeing to the motion of
 the Senator from Mississippi [Mr. EAST-
 LAND].
 The motion was agreed to; and the
 Presiding Officer appointed Mr. EAST-
 LAND, Mr. JOHNSTON of South Carolina,
 Mr. MCCLELLAN, Mr. DIRKSEN, and Mr.
 KEATING conferees on the part of the
 A NEW KIND OF WAR
 Mr. MUNDT.  Mr. President, as one
 of the coauthors of the legislation pro-
 posed to establish a Freedom Commis-
 sion and Freedom Academy to train citi-
 zens in the conspiratorial techniques of
 communism  and  the  most  effective
 methods to meet this new type of politi-
 cal warfare, I call the attention of Sen-
 ators to an important article on the cold
 war struggle written by Preston J.
 Moore, national commander  of  the
 American Legion.
 Speaking as the leader of one of our
 great veterans' organizations, Command-
 er Moore's comments are both signifi-
 cant and enlightening as to the new '
 challenges confronting this Nation.
 Commander Moore most capably puts
 his finger on one of our major problems
 in the ideological struggle against Com-
 munist tyranny, the fact that as a whole,
 we, the American people, fail to under-
 stand the strategy employed against us
 by the Kremlin leaders.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed in the RECORD the
 excellent article written by Command-
 er Moore and published in the August
 issue of American Legion magazine.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD.
 as follows:
 WE MUST LEARN To FIGHT A NEW KIND OF WAR

 the American Legion)

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE               , July 22
 It has already begun.  We see it clearly-
 it is only the beginning."
 We in America must see this picture just
 as clearly as the Communist master strate-
 gist did, and we must see it in relation to
 our own personal affairs.  This is a matter
 that we must recognize and help solve as
 individuals.  We cannot pass thebuck to the
 State and go on the assumption that if we
 allow our politicians to spend enough money
 on foreign aid and armament, the unpleas-
 ant picture painted by Lenin will automat-
 ically disappear.
 The new kind of war is not fought that
 Way.  We 'cannot-like the  peasants and
 burghers of the 18th century-unconcern-
 edly watch soldiers dying as we plow our
 fields and engage in trade. We are directly
 involved in war right now, regardless of
 what our business is, where we are located,
 and what station in life we occupy.  And
 keep in mind that it is official-this war
 was declared when Marxism began, and it is
 now  rapidly  approaching  the  showdown
 stage, "the final struggle," as various mani-
 festations of war erupt in Berlin, Iraq, Tibet,
 Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere,
 A few weeks ago the biggest and blackest
 headlines in our newspapers dealt with Ber-
 lin, and by the time this article appears in
 print it is quite likely that Berlin will again
 be  the  world's  greatest  danger  spot.
 Khrushchev has served notice on us that if
 we want access to Berlin, we must deal with
 his puppet East German regime; and he has
 been told without equivocation that this we
 will not do. The Russian action means the
 breaking of another treaty, but this Is a mat-
 ter of no consequence to a people who are
 pathologically insistent on signing treaties of
 no worth whatsoever.  From our standpoint,
 to give up Berlin would mean the end of the
 allied  position  not only  in  Berlin  but
 throughout the world.   It would dramatize
 a point that the reds constantly try to prove
 to the rest of the world: that the United
 States is weak, vacillating, and cannot be
 counted on.   As a corollary, the writing off of
 Berlin would mean the end of NATO.
 While the Berlin crisis was diverting the
 world, the Communists pulled another coup
 by seizing power In Iraq.  This highly stra-
 tegic, oil-rich country is now firmly in the
 hands of the reds, and you may be sure they
 will exert leverage from this position to bring
 other Middle Eastern countries under their
 control.  The results could be disastrous to
 the free world.  Europe uses 137 million tons
 of oil every year, and 85 percent of it comes
 from the Near East.  Any cut in the flow of
 oil from there would paralyze European in-
 dustry and cripple NATO.
 However, on the credit side there have been
 two happenings which should impede the
 flow of the red tide. Nasser is currently un-
 happy about Soviet moves in the Middle
 East, and has made some critical remarks in-
 dicating that the honeymoon between the So-
 viet Union and the United Arab Republic is
 definitely over.  It is to be hoped that our
 State Department can and will exploit this
 rift.
 In the Far East the Communists lost a tre-
 mendous amount of face when Red China
 tried and failed In its attempt to seize the
 Dalai Lama of Tibet.  Even the greatest ef-
 forts by Mao Tse-tung's armies were unable
 to keep the spiritual leader of the Tibetans
 fromigaining sanctuary in India, and the bru-
 tal action of the Red Chinese in seeking out
 the Dalai Lama's followers and in destroying
 their ages-old lamaseries has made a pro-
 foundly unfavorable impression, notably in
 the Orient.  Even Nehru's limitless tolerance
 toward the reds has been put to a strain,
 particularly since his own people are in an.
 uproad over the outrage.
 In Africa events are shaping up which
 strongly indicate that we can expect much
 trouble there.  The issue is presented as a
 reaction from colonialism, with new nations
 the same.  The man who fought in the
 trenches in World War I and then as a "re-
 tread" in World War II found himself fighting
 an entirely new kind of war.  The World
 War II vet who was called back to light in
 Korea learned that the warfare there was
 different in many important respects, notably
 in certain strange concepts of strategy.
 More than a century ago a famous military
 Writer, Clausewitz, described the changing
 .concept of war in a series of books that have
 become classics.  As a youth Clausewitz had
 fought in were that were almost idyllic.
 Peasants plowed their fields as battles raged
 a short distance away, and as soldiers died
 In those Tattles,' burghers in nearby towns
 carried on their business as usual.   But
 CClsuscwItzsa* that situation changing, and
 we . have been Iiving through the change he
 predicted and discussed.
 One of the key phrases in his works is this,
 "'War'ts nothing else than the continuation
 Of    to policy by different means."
 In other words, no longer do two mighty
 armies face ea.&h other on a field and, at a
 given signal and with a flourish of trumpets,
 join battle. ` Warfare is subtler and more
 abstract, tl'ie front fs everywhere, and what-
 -ever can hurt the enemy is permissible as a
 weapon.
 All of us have seen this terrible evolution
 of;warfare. We are familiar with the way in
 Which Hitler used various kinds of pressure
 and persecution to force the capitulation of
 his weaker net$hbors.  We saw how Japan,
 without  any  formal   declaration of  war,
 eV'61ved Its greater east Asia coprosperity
 sphere.  We certainly have not forgotten how
 emerging.  Ghana, formerly the British Gold
 Coast,  has  become  independent;  as  has
 French Guinea.  Nigeria becomes an inde-
 pendent nation next year.                                                                                                                         The Belgian
 Congo, a major source of uranium, has ex-
 ploded into a civil war between whites and
 blacks. The Mau Mau seem to be back in'
 the business of bloodletting in Kenya and
 Tanganyika, and there are disturbing rum-
 bles from the French Sudan.
 We can sympathize with any nation which
 wants its freedom, but all too often the
 people of these new nations are not prepared
 for nationhood, democracy, and law.  That,
 however, does not stop the hellbent rush for
 national freedom, and in this rush they are
 being prodded by outside agitators.  Those
 fellows are helping to develop a strong anti-
 white-man complex which can cause a great
 deal of trouble for us in the future.  The
 same Communist agitators cause us trouble
 in another way.  As the new nations emerge
 they Invariably look to the United States for
 help. If we do not come through with suffi-
 cient foreign aid, the Russians move in with
 big promises and at lenest some token assist-
 ance, usually in the form of loans to permit
 the purchase of Russian goods. This in turn
 creates more mischief because with the Rus-
 sian goods come Communist technical advis-
 ers who specialize in subversion of various
 kinds.
 In our own backyard, Latin America, we
 have plenty to worry about.  In Venezuela,
 we witnessed the humiliating spectacle of a
 Vice President of the United States being
 stoned and spat upon by a howling mob
 which. had been stirred up by the reds.  In
 Mexico  an  ambitious  strike  which     was
 planned to cripple the country was fomented
 by reds, and the Mexican Government coura-
 geously showed where the strike had origi-
 nated by kicking two Soviet diplomats out
 of the country.  In Cuba, we find ourselves
 in a.dilemma.    Fidel Castro insists that he
 is not a Communist, but he is equally in-
 sistent that he is going to be independent of
 both the East and the West,  Some of the
 people surrounding him, who seem to be
 preoccupied with exporting revolutions, are
 certainly not reassuring.  Meanwhile, execu-
 tions go on in Cuba, popular elections are
 years off, and there are charges that the
 country is being used as a base for operations
 against other Caribbean countries which are
 anti-Communist and on friendly terms with
 the United States.  Elsewhere in Latin Amer-
 ica there Is political turmoil as the Commu-
 nists busy themselves stirring up hatred of
 the gringos when they are not in a position
 to manipulate the governments themselves.
 There was a time when many people
 thought that the Russian people themselves
 could be counted on to side with us in case
 of trouble with their rulers.  No people was
 ever more harshly treated by the men in the
 Kremlin than the Russian people themselves.
 Millions had been purged and millions more
 had suffered in slave-labor camps.  It seemed
 logical that, given a chance, the Russians
 would rise and overthrow their brutal mas-
 ters.                                                                                                             But from all accounts there is a dif-
 ferent feeling in the Soviet Union today.
 The image of Stalin is gone and Khrushchev
 is not hated as his predecessor was.  Also,
 the Russians are beginning to get some of
 the consumer goods they had been promised
 for many years.  By American standards
 they are not getting much, but visitors to
 the Soviet Union report that the people seem
 content.
 Probably most important, however, is the
 fact that the Russians are beginning to take
 pride in the Communist regime.  They see
 material evidence of Soviet scientiffic prog-
 ress in such things as their sputniks and
 Lunik, their massive armament, their nuclear
 bombs, and their excellent planes. They no
 longer feel that they are looked upon as a
 backward people, and they areshowing more
 enthusiasm for the idea of catching up with
 the interplay of political pressures between
 the United States and Japan culminated In
 the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.. And since
 the end of World War II we have seen in the
 actions of the Soviet Union the greatest dem-
 onstration of. all in the way of brutal, relent-
 less war,
 In 13 years we have seen how Soviet Russia
 has absorbed 11 nations into its bloody em-
 pire, and we. are well aware that today one-
 third of all the people on earth-923 million
 -are now arrayed against us in what the
 Communists bavealways referred to as "the
 final struggle" between communism and the
 free world.  In not a single case did the con-
 spirators in the Kremlin formally declare
 war against the' countries they took over.
 Instead tley eniployed espionage, treason,
 sabotage, political blackmail, threats, perse-
 cuttion, murder, and other methods that
 decent people 'abhor.  Even  though  their
 methods, are tteacherous and evil, they did
 get results  It is time that we understood
 those metb9i s and how they are being used
 against us; to fall to do so is to go under
 without realigin  what happened to us.
 -Actually, there is no reason why there
 should, be any misunderstanding as to our
 true relations with the Soviet Union.    No
 one  will  dispute  the  fact  that  Nikita
 Khrushchev is the boss Communist, and that
 what he says is law.     When Khrushchev
 tells us that he intends to bury us, he is
 merely reminding ` us in a few words of a
 basic premise of Communist doctrine.  Years
 ago Lenin spelled it out in the following
 statement:
 "Marxists have never forgotten that vio-
 lence will be an inevitable accompaniment
 of the collapse of capitalism . * * and of the
 birth of a socialist society. And this violence
 will cover a historical period; a whole era of
 wars of the most varied kinds-imperialist
 wars, civil wars within the country, the inter-
 weaving of the former with the latter, ngtion-
 al wars, the emanciaption of the nationalists
 crushed by the imperialist powers which will
 inevitably form various alliances with each
 other in the era of vast state-capitalist and
 military trusts and combines.  This is an era
 of tremendous collapses, of wholesale mili-
 tary decisions of a violent nature, of crises.

 and overtaking the great United States of
 America. They have a timetable for this.
 By 1965, they are told, their production will
 be ahead of any European nation, and by
 1970 they will surpass the United States of
 America.
 In this race with the United States they
 are competing with Red China.  The Chinese
 are in fact being driven far more brutally
 than the Russians are today, and they are
 being given an outlet for the resentment they
 must feel.  The United States, they are told,
 is the enemy of the Chinese people, and if
 they don't work hard and make their country
 strong, the American imperialists will in-
 vade their land and slaughter them with
 germ warfare and atomic bombs.  So they :are
 taking what is called "the long leap for-
 ward," and this exercise is keeping them
 busy, literally, from sunup till far into the
 night, building an economy that by the year
 2000 will have to accommodate an estimated
 1.59 billion Chinese.
 I don't have to emphasize the danger that
 this population pressure represents to us and
 to the world generally.  There are some wish-
 ful thinkers who say that the big danger is to
 Soviet Russia, but I think differently. There
 is no, sign of friction between the two na-
 tions.  Years hence Russia and China may
 turn on each other, but that will come only
 if they are able to vanquish the West. ` In
 that case, like jackals, they could tackle each
 other over the spoils.
 Since the new kind of warfare does not
 necessarily mean marching armies or firing of
 guns, most Americans are not aware of the
 true  situation.  They  may  arouse  them-
 selves when a flight of Mig's blasts down an
 unarmed American transport and murders
 American men, and they may become indig-
 nant when the Soviets Insult us when we in-
 quire about the bodies of the murdered air-
 men.  But we forget quickly and turn back
 to the sports pages and television screen,
 While the Communists use violence and
 brush-fire wars where those things serve
 their purpose, the main battles of this war
 are now being fought on other fronts-eco-
 nomic, psychological, and moral.  And it is
 high time that all Americana received some
 basic training in these things so that they
 can understand exactly how the enemy em-
 ploys them in this strange new warfare.
 Obviously the Soviet Union is not paring
 down its military might.  There is no hint
 that the Red army is being reduced in size.
 The Red air force, fromall accounts, is being
 steadily augmented.  The Red navy's far-
 ranging fleet of hundreds of modern sub-
 marines is being increased.  And we know
 that the Russians are far advanced in the
 nuclear and missile fields.  In short, the men
 In the Kremlin many propagandize for peace
 and peaceful coexistence, but they are ready
 to smash us militarily if they think it pos-
 sible that they can do so without our re-
 taliatory power destroying Russia.
 We would be foolish indeed to give them
 any reason to think they could do so.  There-
 fore our only possible course is to keep build-
 ing a powerful and balanced military force
 which can defend this Nation and devastate
 the Soviet homeland if Khrushchev should
 ever dare to launch an attack against us or
 the allies to whom we are committed.
 Military power costs money, a lot of money,
 and this means big budgets which, in turn,
 mean high taxes.  We have to make sacrifices
 to maintain this power, but the only alterna-
 tive is the sacrifice of our freedom.
 Although military force is not being em-
 ployed at present against us, other pressures
 are being built up.  One of these is what
 Khrushchev had in mind when he chal-
 lenged us to a trade war.
 As I stated earlier, the people behind the
 Iron and Bamboo Curtains are `being ex-
 horted in every way to beat America in pro-
 duction.  This is not just for national pride
 nor to give the peoples of those countries
 more of the good things of life.  This pro-
 duction is wanted for a trade war.  Khru-
 shchev has challenged us to this war and says
 that he will beat us at it.  If he does, he
 will be well on the way to defeating us.
 Molotov explains why in a statement he
 made in 1946:
 "We are not fighting America as Yet,. he
 said, "but once we have deprived her of her
 markets, crises will follow and cause con-
 fusion.  After we have taken her markets in
 Europe, expelled her from Asia and else-
 where, she will have no market where to
 dump her merchandise.  She will curtail her
 production,-and there will follow unemploy-
 ment.  Our opportunity to square accounts
 with America will be at hand."
 What are we doing to meet this threat?
 In the 5 years from 1950 to 1955 we had an
 unparalleled growth in this country.   Even
 so, we were beaten by many countries.  Ger-
 many led with an annual growth of 10,per-
 cent.  Japan was second with 8 percent, and
 the Soviet Union was third with 7 percent.
 Actually,  the  United  States  of  America
 turned up in the bottom half with a rate
 of growth of only 4 percent.    Ahead of us
 were Canada, France, Netherlands, and Italy.
 But what has happened since then is even
 more shocking.  The Soviet rate of growth
 has jumped to an estimated 9 to 11 percent
 in the past 2 years, and our own rate of
 growth has stood still.  Is it any wonder
 that Khrushchev boasts about licking us in
 a trade war?
 In their calculations for this new kind of
 warfare, the canny Communists count heav-
 ily on a weakness they attribute to us which
 they call "decadence."  In Communist liter-
 ature there is frequent reference,to the "de-
 cadent bourgeoisie," and the Communists
 look upon them with contempt as weaklings
 who are no match for their so-called Soviet
 man.
 Unfortunately,  cynical  men  such  as
 Khrushchev do not have to look far to find
 evidence of this kind of weakness. They
 recognize as a sign of decadence, or weak-
 ness, the way in which some businessmen
 will do anything if they can make a profit
 from it.  In the late 1920's and early 1930's,
 for example, the Reds desperately wanted
 diplomatic recognition by the United States
 for their shaky regime.  A good case can be
 made for the thesis that if we had with-
 held this recognition we would not today be
 facing the Red colossus that threatens to
 bury us.  One of the arguments advanced
 for recognition was trade.  The Communists
 and their apologists in this country insisted
 that with recognition we could expect a tre-
 mendous and highly profitable volume of
 business with the Soviet Union.
 The American Legion, I am proud to'say,
 did its best to prevent the Communists from
 achieving this great diplomatic triumph, but
 the pressures were too great.  The papers
 were signed in 1933, and the Soviet was
 thereby given another lease on life.  And
 I might add that the promised trade with
 the Reds never materialized.
 Not long ago the Red line was baited once
 again with promises of big business.  This
 was when Khrushchev sent the wily Anastas
 Mikoyan to this country to sound us out
 on a new deal, and while doing so to give
 the United States a sound drubbing in the
 psychological war that is going on between
 this country and the U.S.S.R.  The Ameri-
 cans who promoted the trip may have had
 the naive idea that it would show him our
 strength, but what it really did was dem-
 onstrate to the subjugated peoples, the neu-
 tralists, and our allies that some Americans
 probably are as decadent as the Reds say we
 are.
 Years ago Lenin made the cynical obser-
 vation: "When we Communists are ready
 to hang the capitalists, they'll try to outbid
 each other for the sale of hemp to us."
 12745
 The truth of that saying was proved by
 the way in which Anastas Mikoyan was
 wined and dined by some of our so-called
 best people. Here was a man who had ruth-
 lessly purged working people, and he was
 being honored by some of our best known
 labor leaders.  Here was a man who had
 boasted of robbing banks, and he was being
 treated with deference by officials of some of
 New York's largest banking houses.  Here
 was a man dedicated to the overthrow of the
 free enterprise system, not to mention the
 United States, and he was being given stand-
 ing ovations by some of America's foremost
 industrialists.
 Here indeed were capitalists and others,
 competing to sell the rope that the Commu-
 nists would need for their hanging.
 What was back of this shameful spectacle?
 Mikoyan was tempting these people with
 hints of trade.  The U.S.S.R. needs many
 things, and would like to get them from the
 United States. Never mind if those things,
 such items as chemical plants, would even-
 tually be used to destroy us.  The impor-
 tant thing was that profits could be made
 out of this kind of coexistence. But Mikoyan
 subsequently let the cat out of the bag when
 he told Under Secretary of State Dillon that
 he wanted $300 million from the United
 States to make the purchases he had dis-
 cussed with the businessmen who had done
 him such honor.  And when Mr. Dillon po-
 litely rejected the audacious deal, Mikoyan
 turned the true face of communism toward
 him.  According to the press, it was not a
 pleasant face.
 But let it not be thought that only cer-
 tain members of banking and business cir-
 cles are afflicted with weaknesses that the
 Reds can exploit.  Because of selfish, un-
 realistic, and unsound thinking with regard
 to production, we are making it increasingly
 easy for Khrushchev to make good his boast
 that he can beat us in a trade war.
 . In this country we once went on the the-
 ory that the more that people produced, the
 more money was available for wages, im-
 provements, profits, and so forth.  Henry
 Ford demonstrated this when he set up his
 assembly lines to makes the Model T. By
 turning out a lot of cars, he was able to
 pay his workers an unheard-of salary of $5
 and more a day.  Our economy became
 geared to mass production, and the flood of
 goods that poured from our factories not
 only gave us a standard of living that was
 the envy of the world but made it possible
 for the allies to win two World Wars.
 But there has been a change in our think-
 ing.                                                                                                                Now the policy of certain highly influ-
 ential labor leaders is to insist on producing
 the absolute minimum for the greatest pos-
 sible wages, plus various and sundry fringe
 benefits.  This would'be bad enough in nor-
 mal times, since it would mean high prices:
 but faced as we are with a trade war with
 friends and avowed enemies, this sort of
 boondoggling can lead to national suicide.
 Unless there is a return to some basic funda-
 mentals of production and sound economics,
 we are going to find our goods priced out of
 markets around the world. This could bring
 on still another aspect of this new kind of
 warfare, one the Reds have confidently pre-
 dicted:- a crippling depression that could
 turn our country sharply into orbit with the
 Soviet Union,
 Certainly capital and labor are not the
 only offenders.  The actions of these two
 groups have their counterparts throughout
 our entire economy as millions of people
 strive to get something for nothing.  This
 may give these people a temporary advan-
 tage, but it is the Communist hierarchy
 which will gain the final victory If we con-
 tinue in this way.
 Specifically, what can we do to fight this
 new kind of war?  We must first of all put
 our faith ,,in divine pprovidence, just as our
 Founding Fathers did when they threw
 down the gauntlet to the British in the

 Declaration of Independence.  It is no acci-
 dent, to use a Communist cliche, that the
 Communists fight religion.  They recognize
 it as a mortal enemy which must be de-
 stroyed lest it destroy them.  Lenin laid
 down the dictum: "We must combat re-
 ligion-this is the ABC of all materialism,
 and consequently Marxism." Let us not
 throw away this weapon so greatly feared
 by the anti-Christs of the Kremlin.
 And let us make greater use than we have
 of  patriotism.  Americans  have  too long
 been too sensitive to the sneers of self-styled
 intellectuals who label love of country as
 "flag waving."   Quite often these people are
 actually scornful of the flag itself, rather
 than what they choose to mock as "flag
 waving."  And some of them have given
 their loyalty, for whatever it is worth, to the
 blood-redbanner of socialism.
 The end result of our shamefaced atti-
 tude toward patriotism can be found in a
 study of brainwashing made by Army Maj.
 William E. Mayer.  He studied the case his-
 tories of a thousand of our soldiers who had
 been captured in Korea and found that
 many of  them    were  so weak  in  their
 patriotism that they succumbed easily under
 pressure from their Chinese interrogators.
 A Chinese intelligence report found in
 North_Eorea in 1951 gives further evidence
 of what is wrong in certain quarters. Here
 is whatthe Red Chinese said about some of
 the men they captured and studied:
 "The American soldier has weak loyalties
 to his family, his community, his country,
 his religion, and his fellow soldiers. His
 concepts of right and  wrong are hazy;
 opportunism  is  easy. He  underestimates
 his own worth, his own strength, and his
 ability to survive. He is largely ignorant
 of social values, social tensions, and con-
 flicts.  There is little knowledge or under-
 standing, even among U.S. graduates of
 American political history and philosophy,
 of the Federal, State, and community or-
 ganizations; of States rights and civil rights;
 of safeguards to freedom, and of how these
 things supposedly operate within his own
 system."
 This is a terrible indictment of the men
 who succumbed to Red brainwashing, but
 it is an even greater indictment of those
 educators who offer students Intellectual
 shoddy instead of the truth.
 In this new kind of war we can taipe an-
 other lesson from the Founding Fathers, this
 time from Benjamin Franklin who assured
 his fellows: "We must all hang together. or
 assuredly we shall all  hang separately."
 Recognizing that we are in a war, we should
 show the enemy a united front. I do not by
 any means counsel unthinking conformity,
 but we must not allow ourselves to be split
 assunder by false prophets who are trying
 to divide us.
 There are, unfortunately, many such peo-
 ple among us, and their ringleaders have
 recently been authorized to go their way
 without much hindrance, war or no war. But

 The basic idea has much to recommend it,
 and you might give it a try.  You may dis-
 cover some weaknesses within you of a type
 that the Communists count on and hope to
 exploit.  Discovering them at this stage, you
 will have the opportunity to correct them
 without having an armed guard to assist In

 fools at best, or traitors at worst. These are
 the people who suffer from a strange myopia
 when the Soviet Union is concerned, but who
 showed amazing clarity of vision when other
 countries menaced world peace. They had no
 illusions about Mussolini when his legions
 marched into Ethiopia. When the Japanese
 seized Manchuria, they were quick to recog-
 nize where that aggression was likely to lead.
 When Hitler's troops started  to overrun
 Europe, while at home he conducted diaboli-
 cal persecutions, they called for retribution-
 hut only after the Hitler-Stalin Pact was
 broken.  But when the Soviet Union com-
 mits the mostunspeakable atrocities against
 humanity, these people are either silent or
 they raise their voices to excuse and condone
 the brutalities of the Kremlin. Consistently,
 of course, such people viciously attack any
 and all who oppose communism. I am proud
 that the American Legion rates high on their
 list.
 Such people are entitled to their opinions,
 even when their expressions come close to
 being treasonable in view of the war in which
 we are engaged. But there is no reason what-
 soever why these pro-Communists and anti-
 anti-Communists should be given the pres-
 tige and prominence that is often accorded
 them, and their propaganda, by our press
 and our broadcasting systems. The best they
 merit is a form of quarantine in which the
 .Red virus they hope to spread can die put
 harmlessly without being disseminated to
 further infect and weaken Americans.
 Recognizing that we are engaged in war,
 one in which every conceivable weapon Is
 being used or threatened against us, we
 must be prepared to make sacrifices.  How-
 ever, this time it Is essential that the bur-
 dens be borne more equitably than they
 have been in the past. We cannot have peo-
 ple enduring privations in order to create a
 specially privileged class such as the infa-
 mous black-marketeers of World War II.
 Taxes will have to be high, but let us make
 certain that the money isn't wasted by self-
 ish politicians on extravagant Utopias or in
 personal empire building.
 We need the best we can get in the way
 of armament, but we cannot afford the
 waste, stupidity, or chicanery exemplified by
 vast stockpiles of equipment that is worth-
 less for one reason or another.  Production
 for defense is vital, but such production
 should not be used as an excuse for manage-
 ment to make inordinate profits or for labor
 to demand outrageously high wages. Where
 foreign aid is necessary, let us make sure
 that the billions being spent will benefit our
 country.  We cannot afford at this time the
 luxury of keeping an army of bureaucrats
 abroad or of providing vast slush funds for
 foreign politicians who may be of doubtful
 value to us in this new kind of warfare.   `
 There are many more things which have to
 be done, and done properly, and It is the re-
 sponsibility of every American to take an ac-
 tive interest in what is being done and how
 these things are being worked out.  To re-
 peat what I said earlier, in a war like this
 we are all active participants and we cannot
 delegate to others the job of winning it.
 What, specifically, can an individual do?
 Maybe a good way to answer this would be
 to try a routine that the Communists use In
 a distorted manner-self-criticism.  Com-
 munists and prisoners of`the Reds are re-
 quired to engage In extensive soul searching
 with the idea of learning their weaknesses
 and bow they can overcome these weak-
 nesses.
