PHILIPPINES: 
Decisive Weekend for Military Rebels 
A military pay increase to take effect next week may neutralize 
the threat to the Philippine Government from rebel Colonel  
Honasan and his supporters,  
President Aquino signed legislation on Thursday authorizing pay 
hikes?averaging 60 percent?for all active-duty soldiers, ending 
rumors the government would renege on its promise. The raise takes 
effect on Tuesday and is scheduled to appear in paychecks on 
15 December, although there is some uncertainty about the source of 
funding, 
Yesterday a Manila newspaper ran a letter reportedly authorized by 
Honasan that states he and his supporters will desist from hostile 
action against the government because of the pay increase and other 
efforts by Aquino to address military grievances and improve the 
government's performance. Various press reports suggest Honasan 
may surrender this weekend because he and his supporters will lose 
their military pay and family benefits if they remain absent without 
leave after Monday 
25X1 
25X1 
25X1 
25X1 ;1 
Comment: Honasan has been losing supporters and credibility as 
Aquino has moved to address military grievances. The pay increase is 
a major concession to the military and a strong incentive to surrender 
for rebels who do not want to be dropped from the payroll. But 
dissension in the ranks will begin to grow again if funding becomes a 
problem and the pay hike is slow in coming.

HAITI: 
Tension Persists on Eve of Election 
Tensions are high throughout Haiti on the eve of a national 
election as vigilante groups engage in retaliatory violence 
against rightwing attempts t7 derail the electr process. 
Neighborhood vigilante groups`have killed at least six people this 
week. Several attack ' ' s1 
appear indiscriminate. The ruling council has denounced the 
vigilantes and affirmed that the Army has sole responsibility for 
providing security during the election period. Some troops have been 
deployed to trouble spots in Port-au-Prince in the past several days, 
and military commanders have said they will provide election workers 
security and transoortati including helicopters if ordered to do so 
by the councils  
The council, however, continues to shoW little regard for the security 
of the election and the electoral commission. On Erm.8452 two leading 
commission members publicly accused the council of failing to 
provide deauate security and of  ignoring their requests for logistic 
support. 
Vearrovh-i5 campaigning by the many candidates who are running for 
__pLesident)hai intensified, and several centrists are exploring the 
possibility of forming coalitions after the first round of balloting. 
Campaigning for legislative 
offices also has increased: there now are 76 candidates for 27 senate 
seats, and 247 candidates for 77 seats in the chamber of deputies. 
More than 70 percent of the eligible voters have been registered, but 
some pollin places may not have ballots and other supplies  
tomorrow. 
Comment: The emergence of_vigilante groups to protect the election 
process increases the likelihood that balloting will proceed but also 
risks a rising spiral of violence. Such violence, regardless of the 
motivations of the perpetrators, might drive a large number of voters 
from the polls and give rightists in the military an excuse to attempt a 
coup in the hope of preempting the elections. Although balloting 
probably will occur on scheduleComeffoB continued violence at the 
current level could seriously(com_plicate efforts to install a democratic 
civilian government in February)

NICARAGUA: Military Developments 
The Sandinistas have increased counterinsurgency operations in 
the north amid continued insurgent hit-and-run attacks.

A government sweep operation that began two weeks ago to relieve 
rebel pressure on towns in the north has intensified as the Sandinistas 
have committed additional troops to encircle rebels.

early last week, destroying two 30-meter towers  and a control

communications between Managua ana tne south of the country were 
interrupted for at least six days as a result of the attack, according to 
press reports 
Comment: The Sandinistas probably hope any rebels not killed or 
captured in the current operation will be forced to seek haven farther 
east in one of the government's proposed cease-fire zones. Thus far, 
however, government forces have failed to dislodge rebel units from 
the Quilali area 
The rebels have evaded government forces by dispersing into smaller 
groups, reforming, and ambushing their pursuers. The insurgents-

USSRfritUS: Propagandists Preparing for Summit 
Some 100 Soviet journalists have reque`sted US visas for next 
month's summit, 
underscoring the regime's awareness of the importance of image 
building to a successful foreign policy and to General Secretary 
Gorbachev's prestige at home. They include the heads of Novosti, 
TASS, and the State Television and Radio Committee, as well as 
several leading newspaper editors and political commentators. The 
rank of the applicants exceeds that of the Soviet media 
representation at either the Geneva or the Reykjavik summit 
: ? 
Comment: Gorbachev's propaganda chief, Politburo member 
Aleksandr Yakovlev, reportedly ordered the strengthening of Soviet 
press representation at Reykjavik and apparently is aiming higher for 
Washington. Several of the media officials planning to attend are 
members of the party Central Committee. The presence of such 
senior media figures might presage a major Soviet statement on 
Afghanistan or some other key issue. 
UK-USSR: Gorbachev Invited for Presummit Meeting 
25X1

25X1 
25X1 
Prime Minister Thatcher's invitation to General Secretary Gorbachev 
for a meeting in the UK on 7 December on his way to Washington will 
buttress her image as a world leader and provide her with an 
opportunity to help shape the post-INF agenda. Thatcher told the 
House of Commons she plans to discuss internal reforms in the USSR 
and prospects for arms control in post-INF Europe; the Soviets have 
not announced the issues they will raise 
Comment: Thatcher is likely to use her meeting to ensure that 
Gorbachev understands European interests and priorities in arms 
control before he signs an INF deal in Washington. She has stated 
that the West should not remove other categories of nuclear weapons 
from Europe without progress in reducing conventional and chemical 
weapons. Foreign Secretary Howe said this week the UK had not 
absolutely ruled out putting its submarine-launched missiles on the 
negotiating table, and Gorbachev may want to explore British 
attitudes toward limiting the number of warheads in London's 
modernization program if the US and the USSR negotiate 50-percent 
cuts in strategic weapons. He may also be seeking Thatcher's views 
on a prospective START agreement and support for continued US 
adherence to the ABM Treaty.

ROMANIA: Popular Hatred of Ceausescu Grows 
Popular hatred of Romanian President Ceausescu, which has been 
building for several years, has taken on a harder edge in recent 
weeks,  a/recent 
series of minor and unconnected protestsslirected against the  
President and his even less popular wife 
increased grumbling that the time has come for someone to kill the 
Ceausescus. Still other Romanians reportedly amuse themselves by 
speculating openly about painful ways for them to die 
25X1 
25X1 
25X1 
25X1 
25X1 
Comment: The reemergence of grim humor and bitter grumbling 
undoubtedly reflects intense concern about the approaching winter. 
Many Romanians believe they face record food, heat, and energy 
shortages as well as crumbling social services and punitive wage cuts 
and layoffs. As in late 1985, when memories of the previous severe 
winter produced similar fears, exaggerated rumors of further 
draconian restrictions might trigger spontaneous protests such as the 
recent riot in Brasov. The situation is likely to be most tense in late 
winter when privately stored supplies are depleted and economic 
production slows in the face of energy cutbacks and transportation 
bottlenecks. Ceausescu probably faces little direct threat from 
popular discontent, but the grim mood contributes to his growing 
isolation within the party leadership, where a move against him would 
have a greater chance of succeeding. 
BANGLADESH: Ershad Declares State of Emergency 
President Ersh?declared a state of emergency throughout 
Bangladesh steiin a bid to head off a 72-hour general strike 
scheduled to be teffter-fea3 According to press reports, the 
measure was taken after opposition parties announced plans for fresh 
protests in defiance of earlier orders banning demonstrations. The  
overnment rrested nearly 50 people onrUtifs?1,2147rto weaken further

the opposi ion's organizational ability. 
Comment: Ershad almost certainly is under pressure from the military 
to end the general strikes that have crippled the Bangladesh 
economy. He is likely to order his police and paramilitary forces to do 
whatever is necessary to bring order to the streets. Heavy casualties, 
however, might provoke military intervention and Ershad's 
deposition, even though the Army fears Ershad's removal could split it 
into competing factions. Possible successors include Major Generals 
Noor Uddin Khan, Abdul Wahed, or Mohammed Salam. Chief of Army 
Staff Maj. Gen. Atiqur Rahman also could be called upon to head a 
new government, but his advanced age and poor health would 
probably make him an interim figure. No successor military 
government would offer a civilian replacement more than a figurehead 
position

CHILE-US: New Strains in Relations 
25X1 
The Chilean Ambassador to Washington has warned the US 
Ambassador to Chile of potential adverse reactions in Santiago to 
certain US initiatives. He charged the US was putting increasing 
pressure on Chile by lifting privileges for Chilean imports under the 
Generalized System of Preferences, supporting postponement of a 
World Bank vote on a structural adjustment loan for Santiago, and 
leaking false information about alleged Chilean cluster bomb sales to 
Nicaragua. He warned that these steps might harm bilateral trade and 
threaten Chile's free market economic model and implied that?in 
response to US pressure?President Pinochet might reverse the 
"progress" being made in opening up the political system and easing 
restrictions on the moderate opposition. 
Comment: Senior Chilean officials, who are customarily defensive 25X1 
about foreign criticism, have shown even more sensitivity in recent 
months. They probably fear a broad international effort to reject the 
World Bank loan in order to undermine Pinochet's campaign for 
reelection. At least some of them apparently believe that loss of GSP 
privileges and of the World Bank loan will be followed by US trade 
sanctions unless Pinochet shows more political flexibility. Pinochet, 
however, is not likely to abandon his reelection plans or democratize 
the political s stem si nifi a ly in response to foreign pressure.

PANAMA: Anti-US Resolution 
25X1 
25X1 
A nonbinding resolution calling for the closure of "unauthorized" US 
military facilities and restrictions on the entry of US military personnel 
is the Panamanian Legislative Assembly's response to US Senate 
draft legislation that would end aid to Panama. The resolution 
accuses Washington of attempting to overturn the 1977 Canal 
Treaties and calls on the government to refuse to negotiate an 
agreement on US base rights after 1999. The US Embassy says that 
members of the ruling coalition supported the resolution unanimously 
and that opposition deputies abstained or walked out. 
Comment: The ruling coalition, presumably with the approval of 25X1 
Defense Chief Noriega, is probably trying to marshal public support 
for the regime by highlighting perceived US interference in Panama's 
domestic affairs. Opposition members routinely boycott any 
legislative proposal by the majority. President Delvalle ignored 
Assembly demands for the expulsion of the US Ambassador and the 
Deputy Chief of Mission last summer and is not likely to act on most 
of the new proposals. The regime, however, may limit entry of US

PHILIPPINES: Aquino Focusing on Economic Problems 
President  Aquino is taking a renewed interest in the Philippine 
economy, frequently asking her 
advisers on how best to promote economic growth. Over the past few 
weeks, she has made several tough policy speeches, promising to 
reduce the government's role in the economy and to enforce labor 
and anticorruption laws. According to the US Embassy, government 
officials are following up on Aquino's agenda and increasing efforts to 
sell government-owned and -run companies to private investors, 
while the Labor Department is enforcing back-to-work orders and 
removing illegal barriers from strike sites. 
25X1 
K 25X1 
Comment: During the first half of the year, the economy grew at 
5 percent, well short of Manila's 6.5-percent target?largely because of 
lackluster performance in exports, agriculture, and foreign investment?
and some private economists believe growth for the year will be no more 
than 4 percent. Moreover, any slowdown in world trade would 
undermine the export growth that Manila is counting on to sustain the 
recovery. Foreign investors are reacting cautiously to Aquino's 
speeches, citing bureaucratic red tape, political uncertainty, and 
electricity shortages as reasons for not investing. The attacks on US 
servicemen and multinational companies by the New People's Army 
probably will deter additional investment by US companies, which 
account for more than half of foreign investment

Moscow and Beijing seem to be narrowing their differences on 
Cambodia and reportedly have made headway on their border 
dispute. Although neither matter is likely to be resolved soon, the 
two sides may be making progress on one or more of the key 
points dividing them.

and have tried to convince the Chinese?who have called Vietnam's 
occupation the major obstacle to improved Sino-Soviet relations?
that Moscow is interested in a political solution.The-Chinese-Feeeritly

somewhat more flexible during discussionsAp Beijing last month in 
that they agreed for the first time that Cambodia should emerge as a 
neutral country and offered to help bring about apolitical settlement. 
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping this month reiterated his willingness to 
meet with General Secretary Gorbachev if Moscow persuades Hanoi 
to withdraw its troops from Cambodia, according to press reports. 
This time, however, Deng stipulated the withdrawal must take place 
within two years?ostensibly because of his advanced age but 
probably to remind the Vietnamese that Beijing is holding them to

Border Marathon 
Although the Sino-Soviet border dispute is not one of Beijing's "three 
obstacles" to improved relations with Moscow, resolution of this 
longstanding problem could create a favorable environment for other 
agreements. The two sides have already made progress toward 
resolving the status of a contested group of islands opposite the 
Soviet city of Khabarovsk,,

Outlook 
Both sides handled the recent Chinese party congress and 
70th anniversary of the Soviet Bolshevik Revolution in ways that 
underscored their interest in putting a gloss on their relationship. This 
may encourage them to look for new steps to narrow their differences 
on one or more of the key issues dividing them. 
Moscow and Beijing will consider a number of domestic and foreign 
policy factors?including the results of the forthcoming US-Soviet 
summit?before making major moves. Although a successful summit 
41-WerAftejtei9 might reduce the Soviets' immediate interest in their 
own "China card" and encourage them to stand firm against Chinese 
demands, it might stimulate Chinese interest in improved relations 
with Moscow, if only to balance progress in Soviet-US relations.

PAKISTAN: 
Local Elections 
25X1 
Prime Minister Junejo's Pakistan Muslim League probably will 
defeat Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party in local elections 25X1 
on Monday. The ground rules have been shaped to favor 
incumbents, most of whom are PML members. Even a fraudulent 
PML victory would not incite Benazir to launch street 
demonstrations. Violence would undercut her long-term strategy 
of positioning the PPP as a moderate nationalist partv for the 
1990 National Assembly elections. 25X1 
Although the local elections are nominally nonpartisan, they shape up 
as a test of strength between the two parties. Voters will elect officials 
to district, township, and municipal governments. Both parties are 
making major commitments to the nationwide campaigns because 
the local overnments disburse federal and provincial development 
funds 
Party Maneuvering 
Election ground rules favor incumbents, most of whom are PML 
members. Under these rules, candidates will run on a nonpartisan 
basis; the use of political party names or platforms is prohibited, and 
political rallies are forbidden. But officeholders can exploit the 
patronage?historically a powerful tool?their position gives them. 
Despite these PML advantages, the PPP regards the local elections 
as its best chance to regain the momentum lost after street 
confrontations with the government in August 1986. 
The PPP faces a stiff uphill battle in trying to defeat the PML. Prime 
Minister Junejo has sought to throw the PPP off balance by 
establishing a short election campaign that will limit the opposition's 
ability to organize. Moreover, the party has been weakened by 
defections of many of its local leaders since it fell from power in 1977. 
The most recent setback occurred in a National Assembly byelection 
in Punjab in September when the PPP candidate was roundly 
defeated, accelerating defections to the PML. 
best hope for th 
rganizational 
PP is that the PML may be overconfident The

Outlook 
The PML will probably win the elections because candidates 
associated with it will win a majority of the seats in Punjab Province, 
which includes more than half of Pakistan's population. Victories 
outside Punjab would  enhance the PML's success but are not crucial 
to a credible showing 
A PML defeat would be a severe blow to Junejo's prestige, 
particularly if many PML candidates who also are members of the 
provincial and national assemblies are defeated. Junejo might face a 
parliamentary vote of no confidence, but no strong challenger to his 
authority has emerged within the PML. Benazir would probably still 
bide her time until 1990, fearing that President Zia and the Army 
would rally to Junejo's side and that the public would be unwilling to 
face Army bullets to force a change  in government

Special Analysis 
USSR- Soviet Initiatives Advance 
NORDIC STATES: 
Keen Nordic interest in Soviet economic and environmental 
proposals is providing openings for Moscow's regional security 
initiatives and might ultimate! sow disagreement within NATO. 
In a speech in Murmansk last month, General Secretary Gorbachev 
proposed Nordic-Soviet cooperation on arctic research, resource 
exploitation, environmental protection, and the opening of a northern 
sea shipping route. He also revived two longstanding regional security 
concepts: a Nordic nuclear-weapons-free zone and naval confidence-
building measures in northern waters. Gorbachev expanded previous 
Soviet arms control proposals by suggesting NATO-Warsaw Pact 
consultations on the reduction of naval and air activity in northern 
seas. 
Gorbachev tried to project an image of sensitivity to Nordic concerns 
and support for broad arms control measures. Moscow hopes to 
engender a regional discussion of security issues and erode support 
in the area for any increase in regional NATO activity or defense 
spending 
Although Nordic governments are skeptical of Soviet security 
proposals?Copenhagen labeled them a step backward?they take 
pride in being treated as a distinct region with special concerns and 
are actively pursuing Soviet economic and environmental offers. Oslo 
and Moscow are planning joint projects in oil exploration, fishing, and 
mining. The Finns and the Soviets have launched three joint 
ventures?two more are being negotiated?and recently renewed a 
longstanding barter trade agreement. All the Nordics are anxious to 
negotiate pacts with Moscow on environmental protection. 
25X1 
Forthcoming high-level visits will provide the Soviets opportunities to 
renew offers of cooperation on nonsecurity issues, helping to foster a 
favorable atmosphere for Soviet security proposals. The leader of 
Denmark's opposition Social Democrats told the US Embassy he is 
willing to discuss security issues with Moscow in order to obtain 
economic and environmental benefits. Nordic governments have 
shown interest in advance notification of NATO and Warsaw Pact 
naval exercises and in exchanges of observers?issues that NATO 
successfully kept out of the CSCE and that, if pursued, would create 
friction within the Alliance. Moscow may also try to exploit Nordic 
fears of increased NATO deployments of nuclear-capable air- and 
sea-based systems in Western Europe to compensate for INF 
reductions
