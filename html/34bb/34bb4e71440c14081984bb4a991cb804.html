 it was advisable to join the trade union. to protect one's interests.
 It was particularly beneficial in times. of accident or sickness when
 the union, which always backed its members, negotiated with the mine
 administrators for payment of disability benefits.  Although legally
 there was no distinction between disabled miners who belonged to the
 union and those who did not, in practice the procedure was too com-
 ed for the miner    obtain benefits without support               25X1

 mine each miner reported to this room where he received a 2k-volt
 battery flashlight of one of the types presented below.
 This room was equipped with low current transformers for charging
 batteries; a battery lasted eight hours., Some lamps used were
 .gasoline lamps.
 15.   Coal Washing and Gradin  Room.  Coal was mined at Yuzhnys,  in various
 size lumps; a large quantity 'was received as-coal dust.  The 'coal,
 which was always mixed with rock:, was se crated from the rocks'''graded,
 and walphed in a shop called fabrika.   See Annex B.7  The coal was
 hoisted from the mine, by elevator, to A conveyer on the fifth floor
 of fabrika.  On every shift, there,.were approximately 35 girls working
 here separating the rocks and stones from the coal as it moved on the
 .conveyer line,. Lumps rejected were placed in special containers
 which were eventually shot down through special hoppers (chutes),
 loaded on cars, and taken from the mine grounds.  The clean coal was
 directed to a series of shaking sieves located on the second, third,
 and fourth floors where it was graded, in groups, according to. the
 size of the lumps.  Lumps of 30 to 35 cm. in diameter and large'r
 usually remained on the last sieve.  Upon completion of grading,'' the'
 coal was directed to the coal bath where it was washed inseveral ,.
 large basins with-water, at high pressure, from special hose.  From
 here the coal was taken, by conveyer, to 'the drying room where it was
 dried by hot air while being conveyed.  The coal-was stored in bunkers`
 to which it had been taken by conveyer, until shipment.
 16.   Repair.Shops..   Annex B-7  Repair shops consisted of:
 a.  Forge:  Welding and similar work required for repairing equipment
 was done in the forge; three to five workers were'employed here.
 b.  Lathe Shop:  This shop was equipped with one lathe, DIP'-200 type;
 one old lathe; three new drilling machines; and one new planing
 machine.  Repair and maintenance of,mining machinery was done here

 COAL PRODUCTION
 18.     The coal bed in the Yuzhnaya Mine was from 1.5 to 1.8 m. thick.   It
 ran in a. north-south direction at a 380 angle from the horizontal.
 Z'ee Annex C.    The bed was under exploitation in 1951.  There were
 rumor   in      re werp nthpr coal beds in the mine  either. below or
 above                                                               if       25X1
 there were, they were not being exploited in 1951 an  that prepara-
 tions for exploitation were not being made.  In 1951 mining was done
 Pt  the Vntihnava Mine from 105 to 280 m. underground /See Annex 0.7
 Ino coal was mined except that in   e      e
 described above.  The Yuzhnaya Mine was divided into six sections
 (uchastok).  Sections 1., 2, 3, and 4 were Coal Mining Sections (ugol'nyy
 uchastok).  Sections 5 and 6 were auxiliary sections (podsobnyy ili
 vspomogatel'nyy uchastok).  Section 5, responsible for driving new
 entries, expansion of the mine, and for repair and maintenance of
 working entries, was called the Entry Opening Section (Uchastok
 kapital'nogo remonta -- ORR).  Section 6, responsible for the admini-
 stration and operation-of electric railroads, was called the Under-
 ground Transportation Section.
 19.   Sections 1 and 4 were located in the western wing of the mine; Sections
 2 and 3 in the eastern.  Zee Annex DJ
 a. Section 1 was composed of two coal faces (lava):  the first and
 third face.
 b. Section 4 had one face, the first bis.(pervayalava bis).  This
 face.began approximately 600 m. west of the beginning of the
 first face.  (The first face began approximately 500 M. from the
 main shaft.)
 c. Section 2 had two coal faces:   the second and fourth faces.
 Section I had one coal face.:  the second bis (vtorayalavabis)
 the distances there were similar to those
 mentioned  Paragraph b, above7.  All faces in the mine were
 120 m. long.
 20.    The mine was provided with two shafts (stvol);  one, called ski ovoy
 stvol, was used for hoisting coal; the other, called a cage g a
 (klet'yevoy stvol),.was used for miners and for cars loaded with-rock.
 The two shafts were  c    ed wit" elevators.  All machinery and equip-
 ment in the min                       were of Soviet make.                25X1

 21.  The mine had the following entries underground See Annex  7 :
 a.   Main Entry.  This entry, eight meters wide and three meters high,
 was provided with a double-track rail line. .90.m. wide. The sec-
 tions where the main entry merged with-the miners' entry had
 single track.  A tipper (oprokid) was located opposite the entry_
 at the 105 horizontal.  The tipper, a metal drum two by three
 meters, had an opening for the entrance of loaded cars (capacity
 li tn.).  Inside the car was tipped electrically (by a'push'button:)
 and.the coal was dumped into one of two hoppers which were under..`
 the tipper.  Two electrically operated skip hoists'hauled the
 coal from the hoppers to the sutface.
 b.   Miners' Entry (lyudskoy shtrek).  The miners' entry was provided
 with a double-track rail line of .90 m? gauge.  The entry was
 six meters wide and three meters high.
 c.   Entry at the 105 horizontal (shtrek stopyatogo gorizonta).  This
 entry, six meters wide and three meters high, was provided with
 a double-track line of .90 m. gauge.  At the highest point of the
 entry there was a pit (shurf) approximately two meters in diameter
 through which, by means of'an electrically operated bucket (dia-
 meter 1. m.), props and lumber were delivered to the mine.
 d.  Entry 105 (stopyatyyshtrek).  This entry was equipped with a
 single track of .90 m. gauge.  Size of the entry was 4 by 2.8 m.
 Entries /F and 7 were used for miners' communications  removal of
 rock, an  delivery of lumber.  Electric locomotives (14 tbs.) which
 could pull four loaded oars operated in these entries.    ee Annex K
 Six 10-ton electric locomotives each of which could pull 35 loaded
 cars operated in entries r and bj
 e.  First and second subentries. (pervyy i vtoroy promezhutochnyy
 shtrek).  These subentries, 4 x 2j m., were provided,, in the far
 sections with single rail track lines of, .90 m. gauge., Sub-
 entzf3,es were used for the removal of rock.  Cars were moved by
 hand.'to special chutes through which rocks were dumped into the
 main entry,loaded on cars, and taken to the hoisting Cage located
 in the center of the miners' entry.  The hoisting cage could carry.
 either one li-ton oar or 15 miners.  (The same cage was used for
 lumber, machinery, etc.)  The remaining part of the first and
 second subentries contained scraper-conveyers and conveyer belts.
 22.  Coal Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 were. organized as follows:
 a.   Personnel in charge:
 (1)  One mining technician, section chief.
 (2)  Three mining technicians, assistant section. chiefs (one per
 shift).
 (3)  Three foremen (desyatnik) (one per shift).
 b.   Workers:  125 to 150 workers were assigned to each coal section,
 as  o  ows:
 (1)  Two gangs of coal loaders (navalootbo tohik)    each composed
 of 10-12 men.
 (2)  One gang of three to four prop removers ('posadchik).

 23.   All sections of the mine were operated on a 24-hour bapis.  There
 were three eight-hour shifts:  from 0800 to 1600 hours, from 1600
 to 2400 hours, and from 2400 to 0800 hours.  In the coal sections
 one shift was called the preparatory shift (podgotovitel'naya), the
 other two loading shifts (krutel'naya).  /The meaning and origin of
 this Russian term could not be explained 5y DS-5632.   When necessary,
 all workers on the loading shifts could be shifted, to the prepara-
 tory shift.
 24.  It was the task of the preparatory shift to make ready a sufficient
 amount of coal for the work of the other two shifts.   A 1i-m. out
 was made on a 120-m. stretch of coal face (cycle), the coal room
 was timbered; and blasting was done.  Blasting the first 40 m. of
 the cycle always took place during the last 15 minutes of this shift.
 The coal cutter was not moved from the room during blasting but was
 hooked to its winch.  Subsequent blastin  was done in the:following
 sections:  from the 40th to the 60th m. (by the hole man,.of the
 first loading shift 1-1 hours prior to the end of the shift); from
 the 60th to the 100th m. (by the same man 15 minutes before the end
 of the shift) ; from the 100th to the 120th m. (by the hole, man of
 the second loading shift l2 hours, prior to the shift's end), as  .

 25.             The preparatory shift was composed of the following gangs:  a timber
 gang, rock-drilling gang, prop-moving gang, chute-setting gang, coal-
 cutting gang, and a lumber-transport gang, in addition to one hole man,
 one electrician, and one coal driller.  These gangs worked in the
 following way:
 a.  The timber gang placed the second line of props (vtoraya nitka
 organki) five to seven centimeters from the first line of props
 (pervaya nitka organki), as shown below.,

 b.   Chute-setting gang.  When the timber gang had placed 5 to 10
 meters of .the second line of props, the chute-setting gang
 began replacing chutes close to the second line of props.  The
 chutes were fastened to the props, particularly the first few
 placed. at the foot of the mound.  There was no delay in replacing
 chutes since this work was done more rapidly than the cutter
 moved up.  The chutes used in the Yuzhnaya Mine were one meter
 long, eight meters wide,'and five meters high.  Every fourth
 chute had a side opening of 50 x 40 em. through which'coal was
 pushed into the chutes.  f'ee Annex E.7

 It also had a winch See Annex Mto which the cutter was tied.
 .The face was cut approximately          above the floor of the    25X1
 entry, or as low as possible.  The cutter bar was 11 m. long,
 experi-
 ments were made with two 1.75 in. bars but. the pressure resulting
 from such deep cuts was too great for the props to stand.             In
 this way a coal face of 120 m. could be out in.six hours.       Usually,
 after 15 m. had been out, there was a break of 10 to 15 minutes25X1
 when the towing rope was replaced.  Inspection of bits was made
 when the shift ended at which time some bits were replaced
 d.  Coal-drilling gang.  When the cutter had advanced 20 in., the       25X1
 driller assigned to the preparatory shift began drillings for
 explosive charges.  Drillings were made in two rows:   the first
 row was made five meters above the ground, the second three
 meters.  Drillings in-the two rows were always interspaced at
 1.4-m. intervals; depth.of the shafts was 1.5 m.  The upper row
 of shafts was always made at a'150 angle toward the side of the
 natural fall of the coal bed, as shown below.
 -:Six hundred grams (three 200 gram fillings) of ammonite were
 provided for each shaft.  Drilling was first done with a seven-
 meter drill (zaburok) and then with a 1.5-m; drill referred to
 as*bur or shtanga.  Eight or nine minutes were required for a
 depth of 14 in.  A pobedit drilling head could make approximately
 20 shafts without replacement.  The electric borer, referred
 to as baranchik (battering ram) wee Annex U,.used for this     25X1
 e.   Lumber-transporting gang.  Lumber and props for Coal Faces 3
 and 4 were brought to the mine through the pit located at'the.
 most elevated point of the 105th entry.  Here they were loaded
 on flat oars pulled by a li-ton trolley locomotive through the
 105th entry to the crosscuts called pechka.  Five loaded flat
 cars could be pulled by this locomotive.  The; lumber was unloaded
 at the.crassouts and pushed to the third subentry where it rolled
 because of,the natural fall of the crosscut. Lunft er for Coal
 Face 2 and the second bis and for Coal Face 1 and the first bis

 flat cars and pulled by a 10-ton trolley locomotive to the
 appropriate miners' passage (lyudskoy khodok).  Here it was
 unloaded and pulled by electrically-operated winches to the
 second subentry from where it was taken manually,.or by trans-
 porters which were put into reverse gear for this purpose, up
 to the working coal face.  If taken manually, the transporting
 equipment blocking the way was dismantled.  Depending on the
 coal face mined, the lumber transporting sang took over the lum-
 ber and props at pechka (for Faces 3 and k) or at the inter-
 sections of the second subentry (for Face 2 and the second bis
 and for Face 1 and the first bis), and lowered it to the working
 chamber.  One hundred eighty props were needed for the construc-
 tion of one support line with an additional 60 half-props
 (raspilok) for upper beams.`  See Annex Gj
 f..  Drilling gang.   In preparation for blasting this gang drilled
 shafts in the rock ceiling of the coal chamber on the side
 opposite the coal face.  Blasting was done for two purposes:
 to reduce pressure by removing a layer of rock from the ceiling
 and, secondly, to obtain material for building butts (buty).
 Butts were made to serve as supporting walls for vault-like
 openings caused by blasting.  Usually the space between butts
 was 10 m, (a butt was approximately eight meters :bride) and four
 1.5-m. holes were made by the drillers in each area between
 butts.  Drilling was done with a core-drill (kolonkovaya mashina)
 which I am unable to describe. Drills of 3, 5, 7, 1.2, and 1.5 M.
 were used here in succession. At least 20 minutes were needed
 to drill a hole of 1.5 m.
 Prop-moving gang.  When drilling between the butts was completed,
 this gang began to out the props located between the butts, thus
 preparing the areas for clogging. The props were out with axes
 until they bent under pressure, as whown below.
 h.     The electrician attached to the shift had the task of laying
 a cable for 12-volt current between the chute and the reserve
 lines. '~This..wa.s~the.line which had been taken, from the props
 located between the reserve line and the fourth line and which
 was now used by]t~e miners to plug in their bulbs, provided with
 cord, after the outlets were made.  These lights were used for
 light in the coal room; the lamps described above were used in
 transit to the working area atd in emergencies.  The machinery
 (coal cutters, conveyers, core drilling machines, rock-loading
 machines, tipper, and locomotives) operated on a 380-volt current.
 The battering ram operated on approximately 220 volts.  Each '
 coal face was equipped with two transformers to reduce the 380
 volts to 220 and to 12.
 i.     During the shift the hole man placed explosive charges and made
 connections in order to blow the first?40 m. of the new coal
 face and, simultaneously, the rocks located opposite this coal

 section in the last 15 minutes of the shift.  Usually this was
 a section made up of three butts and the.two areas between.
 The Bickford. fuse, approximately 1.7 m. for each hole, was used
 for blowing.  Each hole was blown separately at two or three-
 second Intervals.
 26.    The lst and 2nd Loading Shifts.  Working on each shift were:   one
 gang of coal loaders of 10 or 12 men; five or six women working-as
 hatchway operators; two women conveyer motor operators; one gang of
 rubble fillers.of six or seven men; one or two entry drivers; two
 lumber transporters; one hole man; one electrician.  The function
 of the loading shifts was the removal of coal cut by the cutter during
 the preparatory shift.  The work performed by the shifts is described
 below.
 a. Coal loaders.  Upon entering the coal room, the loaders divided
 the 140-m. blown face into four-meter sections for each man., as
 shown'=, below.
 4                                               7\
 Each four-meter section yielded approximately 3.2 to 3.3 tons
 of coal which had to be removed by a loader in eight hours.
 Loading was done with spades; the auxiliary chutes (poperechnyy
 reshtak) were also used.,
 From the chutes the coal went to the conveyer line.  That  art
 of the line close to the working area was a s.cr'aper type  see
 Annex H 7; farther down the line was a belt type.  From the con-
 veyere coal. went to the hatchway  skat).  The hatchway was
 opened and closed by a metal hatch  see Annex 7 on the lower
 part which made it possible to reguTate the flow of coal to the
 entry where it was loaded into cams pulled by a trolley locomo-
 tive.  The hatchway operators regulated the opening and closing
 of the hatches.  They were further respongible for moving the
 oars, for filling them with coal which streamed through the
 hatchway, and for linking the loaded cars together.  They then

 Conveyer-motor operators.  These operators supervised work.done
 on conveyer motors, lubricated and kept them running.  Normally,
 the conveyer motor ran without interruption for two shifts,. that
 is, for 16 hours.  They stopped for short intervals during the
 blasting periods.
 d.   Rubble-fillers.  The rubble fillers on the previous day's loading
 shift prepared stacks (kletki) from props and sometimes from dis-
 carded lumber to. fill the butts.  Stacks were made in the follow-
 .ing shape.
 The stacks were placed in the lower corner of each butt.  When
 the first 40 m. of the coal face and the equivalent section of
 rock was blasted, the rubble fillers attached to the next loading
 shift filled the butts with rocks.  The work was done with spades.
 Large rocks, however, were moved by hand.
 e.   The lumber transporters functioned as described above ffaragraph
 25.-9.
 f.   Crosscut entries called pechka were made by entry drivers every
 50 m. on Coal Faces 3 and 4.  These entries were used as'''emer-
 gency exits and for ventilation purposes.  Equipment used by
 entry drivers were battering rams (baranchik), spades, and axes.

 on Face No. 1.       This was supposed to be a universal coal-cutting,
 scraping, loading, and transporting machine.  The machine was called
 when mentioned to me, something like NVD.
 as a coal combine (ugol'nyy kombayn) was tested in the Yuzhnaya Mine
 was approx ma e y          ong, pro a  y m. w  e, an   n appearance:
 was similar to a.coal-cutting machine.                                   25X1
 30.    In general the morale of the miners in the Yuzhnaya Mine was low
 because of the hard, dangerous work.      The relatively high wages paid
 to miners did not alleviate this situation.   The miners received no
 .food rations.. Food rationing was abolished in the USSR in 1947 and
 since that time consumer goods and food have been sold on a free
 marke t
 31.    Production quotas were never posted on the bulletin board.  They
 were not known to miners unless some friend working in the adminis-
 trative office gave the information privately.                         25X1
 32.    Approximately 55 to 60 freight cars (30 tn. capacity) were loaded
 daily with coal from the. Yuzhnaya Mine and were transported to some
 unknown destination.
 33.
 34.    Miners could buy coal at the Yuzhnaya Mine for 40 rubles per ton.''
 Purchase price included loading, delivery to the home of the purchaser
 in trucks owned by the mine, and unloading there.
