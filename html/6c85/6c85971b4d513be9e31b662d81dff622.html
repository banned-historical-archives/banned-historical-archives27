mon-use areas such as hallways and lobbies, 
and in placement of plumbing and other 
utility systems, 
(d) Ratio of assignable area to interior 
space area of the building, 
(e) Relationship between the number of 
floors in the construction and the cost of 
land in the immediate vicinity, 
* 
(g) Reasonable allowance, where appropri-
ate and justified, for harmonious integration 
of a new facility with architectural charac-
teristics of surrounding buildings, for cre-
ative application of proved new developments 
_ in educational media and methods, for 
planned future expansion of the facility. 
Regulation 170.15 of the Commissioner 
of Education also allows a State to in-
clude the following standard for deter-
mining relative priorities of projects: 
(d) (6) The relationship of the proposed 
facilities to an adopted plan for development 
of the institution or branch campus for 
which it will be constructed. 
Yet, I think more is needed. We 
should amend the law to make clear that 
campus renewal should be an important 
part of our long-range program of fi-
nancing higher education facilities in 
every State across the land. 
It is for this reason, Mr. Speaker, that 
I have today introduced the College 
Campus Renewal Act. Under unanimous 
consent, I include in the Appendix of the 
RECORD the text of this new bill. It is a 
simple bill that makes the removal of 
obsolescence on college campuses part of 
the national policy of development for 
higher education. A 10-percent bonus 
for constructing facilities in accordance 
with comprehensive planning for the in-
stitution should encourage and help fi-
nance this important activity. 
This Congress is voting bold new pro-
grams in shaping a partnership between 
the Federal and local level in meeting the 
challenge of education. We have a re-
sponsibility to do the job well. 
Campus renewal is a necessary part of 
the development of higher education fa-
cilities in the decade ahead. 
The text of the bill follows: 
H.R. 11816 
A bill to authorize assistance to public and 
other nonprofit institutions of higher 
education in financing the construction, 
rehabilitation, or improvement of needed 
academic and related facilities in under-
graduate and graduate institutions 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of 
Representatives of the United States of 
America in Congress assembled, That this 
Act may be cited as the "College Campus 
Renewal Act". 
FINDINGS 
SEC. 2. The growing obsolescence of many 
buildings on the campuses of institutions 
of higher education in the Nation presents 
a problem that demands immediate action. 
Many buildings are no longer adapted to the 
academic purposes for which they were 
originally constructed. Many buildings are 
unsafe, expensive to maintain, and located 
In such a way as not to allow the most 
efficient and best arrangement of buildings 
on the campus. Functional or structural 
obsolescence and inefficient utilization of 
facilities and land area on the camp 
cause an Unnecessary drain on the budgets 
of public and private colleges, and can 
reduce the effectiveness of grants and loans 
made under Federal programs in support of 
higher education. The expansion of facili-
ties to accommodate' the ever-increasing 
numbers of youth in need of higher educa-
tion must now be accompanied by a care-
fully planned program for modernization 
and replacement of obsolete or inefficient 
facilities on our college campuses. 
AMENDMENTS TO HIGHER EDUCATION FACILITIES 
ACT OF 1963 
SEC. 3. (a) Section 106 of the Higher Edu-
cation Facilities Act of 1963 is amended to 
read as follows: 
"ELIGIBILITY FOR GRANTS 
"SEC. 106. An institution of higher edu-
cation shall be eligible for a grant for con-
struction of an academic facility under this 
title only if such construction will, either 
alone or together with other construction to 
be undertaken within a reasonable time, (1) 
result in an urgently needed substantial 
expansion of the institution's student en-
rollment capacity or capacity to carry out 
extension and continuing education pro-
grams on the campus of such institution, or 
(2) in the case of a new institution of higher 
education, result in creating urgently needed 
enrollment capacity or capacity to carry 
out extension and continuing education pro-
grams on the campus of such institution, or 
(3) result in modernization or removal or 
replacement of a facility that is functionally 
or structurally obsolete or inefficient." 
(b) Section 401 (b) (1) of the Higher 
Education Facilities Act of 1963sis amended 
to read as follows: 
"(b) (1) The term `construction' means 
(A) erection of new or expansion of existing 
structures, and the acquisition and installa-
tion of intial equipment therefor; or (B) 
acquisition of existing structures not owned 
by the institution involved; or (C) rehabili-
tation, alteration, conversion, or improve-
ment (including the acquisition and instal-
lation of initial equipment, or modernization 
or replacement of built-in equipment) of 
existing structures; or (D) removal of an 
obsolete facility and restoring and land-
scaping the land in its place; or (E) a com-
bination of any two or more of the fore-
going." 
(c) The third sentence of section 107(a) 
of the Higher Education Facilities Act of 
1963 is amended by inserting after the words 
"utilizing existing facilities", the words 
"and making progress towards eliminating 
obsolete and inefficient structures". 
(d) Section 108(b) (5) of the Higher Edu-
cation Facilities Act of 1963 is amended to 
read as follows: 
"(5) The commissioner determines that 
the construction will be undertaken in an 
economical manner and will not be of elab-
orate or extravagant design or materials, and 
(if applicable) will remove functional or 
structural obsolescence and increase the 
efficient utilization of the campus or a 
facility; and". 
(e) Section 107(b) of the Higher Educa-
tion Facilities Act of 1963 is amended by 
adding a sentence to read, "The Commis-
sioner may increase the amount of a grant 
by an additional 10 per centum of the 
amount of the grant for any project which 
has been certified to him by the appropriate 
State commission as being in conformity 
with a comprehensive plan developed for 
the institution." 
Protests on Vietnam War Aim at Wrong 
Target 
XTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. GLENN R. DAVIS 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 1965 
Mr. DAVIS of Wisconsin. Mr. 
Speaker, those who deliberately violate 
A6059 
the law and those who deliberately set 
out to encourage and incite others to do 
so, do a disservice to themselves, their 
families, and their country. 
There has been too much of the 
attitude that "boys will be boys" in con-
nection with the violent demonstrations 
across our land, including my own State 
of Wisconsin. Those misguided people 
who seek to take the law into their own 
hands, who seek to "make a point" 
through violence need to be taught the 
errors of their ways. They are being 
used as dupes, and they ought to be 
smart enough to see that. 
A recent editorial in the Milwaukee 
Journal well and thoughtfully brings the 
latest rash of demonstrations into per-
spective. I commend its reading to my 
colleagues: 
PROTESTS ON VIETNAM WAR AIM AT WRONG 
TARGET 
The basic fault of those who are honestly 
demonstrating against the war in Vietnam 
is that they are talking to the wrong people. 
They are admonishing the administration 
and the Congress. They should be directing 
their complaints to Peiping, Hanoi, and that 
part of the Communist world which gives 
those forces support. 
For some months now the Iinited States 
has made repeated offers to go to the con-
ference table to seek an honorable way out 
of the Vietnamese war. We have offered to 
meet with everyone concerned, including 
the Vietcong. The President has invited any 
members of the United Nations and the 
United Nations itself to take the lead in 
mediating. But the only answer is continued 
war. 
Some months ago the policy of the Govern-
ment seemed uncertain and rigid. Protest 
then had validity. It has little now. 
Of course, as some Members of Congress 
and the Attorney General himself have an-
grily charged, the demonstrations have at-
tracted Communists, who may even have in-
spired some of them. That is to be expected. 
Our history since World War II has given us 
plenty of experience with the way in which 
they seize and instigate opportunities for 
troublemaking. Those who demonstrate 
honestly, even if mistakenly, owe it to them-
selves and their Nation not to be misled by 
such anti-American factions. 
The demonstrators do our country no good. 
They may even mislead our enemies in Viet-
nam as to the determination of this country 
not to be pushed out of Vietnam and to ac-
cept nothing but honorable peace. They 
obscure the fact that for some time the ad-
ministration has had the overwhelming sup-
port of the people. The protesters have been 
a small minority. 
We also face another danger. In criticiz-
ing the demonstrators some officials have 
come close to denying the right of dissent 
and equating all who participate with Com-
munists and traitors. 
Senator PROXMIRE, Democrat, of Wiscon-
sin, who thinks the demonstrators are woe-
fully in error, nevertheless points out that 
"the right to protest is feeble and empty if 
it must confine itself to matters that con-
cern us little or on which the Nation's vital 
interests are not touched. It is only when 
protest offends us and seems to strike at 
our country's deepest purposes that the 
meaning of our bill of rights, the right to 
dissent and protest in this democracy, is 
really tested." 
Paralleling the Vietnam protests is an in-
creasingly organized movement against the 
draft. When this is confined to peaceful 
demonstration and argument, no one has 
a right to deny it. But when it reaches or-
ganized methods of defying the legal draft, 
of teaching young men how to cheat and 
mislead authority to escape the draft, of

how to become conscientious objectors"?as 
though conscience could be shaped artifi-
cially?then Government has a right to be 
concerned. 
Military service and fighting have never 
been popular in our democracy. But when 
public policy determines the necessity of 
the draft and of war, our duty is clear. We 
need not like it. But physically to interfere 
with it is to weaken the Nation in time of 
crisis and can become treason. 
Protest is one thing. To be meaningful 
it must be honest. To be effective it must 
have a proper goal. It is an Arnerican 
right?but the right is balanced, too, by a 
duty to act thoughtfully and legally, 
Utah's Cultural Attractions 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. LAURENCE J. BURTON 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 1965 
Mr. BURTON of Utah. Mr. Speaker, 
under leave to extend my remarks in the 
REcoaa, I include the following editorial 
from the Ogden Standard-Examiner of 
Monday, October 18, 1965. The editorial 
takes note of the fact that, in addition 
to the well-known scenic and recrea-
tional attractions to be found in Utah, 
there are also available some very at-
tractive cultural opportunities. These 
are of interest to many of the workers 
moving to Utah to take new jobs in busi-
ness and industry there, and to their 
families. 
I might add, for the interest of my col-
leagues, that the editorial lists only a 
fraction of the many cultural attractions 
to be found in communities from one 
end to the other of my great State. 
The editorial follows: 
UTAH'S CULTURAL ATTRACT/ON LIST 
Something unusual came to our atten-
tion recently?something we should have 
thought about before. 
An Ogden couple was visiting with a 
man and wife who had just moved here 
from Pennsylvania as part of the force be-
ing redeployed to Hill Air Force Base. 
The new arrivals were talking about some 
of the friends they'd left behind in the 
East. 
"They're reluctant to move to Utah," it 
was explained, "because they don't think 
you folks out here have any real cultural 
attractions. They know about your skiing, 
your hunting, your fishing, and your sce-
nery. But they're older folks and are more 
interested in music and the theater." 
Those of us who have been in Utah a long 
time know well how this State has long 
prided itself in its culture. Music and the 
theater came to our State with the first 
pioneers?and has been an important part of 
Utah life since. 
But for the new arrivals?and those who 
might hesitate about becoming Utahans?
let's take at least a partial inventory. 
Let's start with music. The Utah Sym-
phony Orchestra, which makes frequent ap-
pearances in Ogden, is tops among the Na-
tion's State orchestras. Maestro Maurice 
AbravaneI is constantly receiving awards for 
his talents and showmanship. 
Music is an important part of the Weber 
State College lecture and artists series, es-
pecially since the new, 1,800 seat Pine Arts 
Auditorium came into use this year. In 
the summer, Ogden's proud of its "All Faces 
West" pageant, featuring Igor Garin. 
Few musical groups in the world are bet-
ter known than the Salt Lake Tabernacle 
choir and organ. 
Dance? The Utah Ballet Co., directed 
by Willem Christensen, attracts a wide fol-
lowing for its appearances throughout the 
area, including in Ogden. 
The Bertha Eccles Art Center in Ogden 
now has a permanent collection, plus the 
unique rental library that just opened. The 
University of Utah has its famed Hudnut 
Collection and, nearby, the Art Barn. 
For theater, Ogdenites have a wide choice. 
The Weber State College Theater series is 
improving each year?the Fine Arts Audi-
torium helps with this, too. Soon to be 
placed in service in the WSC Fine Arts 
Building are the smaller, more intimate 
cellar theater and Little Theater. 
Just down the highway from Hill Air 
Force Base, the Valley Music Hall?opened 
this past summer?brings top musical stars 
from all over the country for its frequently 
changed shows in one of the country's best 
theaters in the round. University of Utah 
has a summer theater and in winters has its 
Pioneer Theater. 
Typical of world-renown performers who 
come to Utah is Louis Untermeyer, appear-
ing tonight at Weber State College in the 
lecture and artists series to read a collection 
of letters by Robert Frost. He'll be followed 
later in the season by such diverse person-
alities as columnist Art Buchwald and 
essayist Harry Golden. 
WSC also has a series of Audubon lecturers. 
The Ogden Knife & Fork Club helps add 
depth and variety to the area's attractions 
by inviting speakers of national reputation 
to appear at its dinner meetings. 
Museums? The arms collection at the 
Browning Museum in South Ogden is unique 
because it has the original inventor's models 
of most of the Nation's important guns. 
Utah's pioneers are remembered in the 
Goodyear Cabin and Museum at Ogden's 
Tabernacle Park, in the Daughters of Utah 
Pioneers Museum near the Utah Capitol, at 
the Lion House in downtown Salt Lake City 
and the Pioneer Village in Holliday. 
The list could go on. The Springville Art 
Museum. The Shakespeare festival each 
summer in Cedar City. Indian dances at 
the Intermountain School in Brigham City. 
But these should answer the new arrival's 
question. Yea, Utah does believe in culture. 
And we have the attractions to prove it. 
Linn County's Economic Action Program 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JOHN C. CULVER 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 1965 
Mr. CULVER. Mr. Speaker, I am very 
proud of the efforts being made in the 
Second District of Iowa to implement 
the economic opportunity program. On 
May 12, the United Community Services 
Agency received the first community 
action program grant awarded in the 
district to begin the necessary study of 
conditions in Linn County and to estab-
lish an organization to carry out this 
program. 
Perhaps the most significant feature 
of the poverty program is the require-
ment that projects be initiated and ad-
ministered by local officials in the com-
munity who are understandably most 
familiar with the problems in their area, 
and. the resources available to meet these 
needs. It is a fine example of the proper 
coordination of the activities of all levels 
of government and private organizations 
to deal with problems which are of local, 
statewide, and national concern. 
Since May, a most ambitious and com-
prehensive program has been developed 
for Linn County. Officials of the county's 
economic action program?LEAP?have 
worked closely and effectively with 
United Community Services and other 
community leaders in formulating imagi-
native proposals covering a broad range 
of areas which promise to give meaning 
to the goal of creating greater oppor-
tunity. 
WMT radio and television stations in 
Cedar Rapids have recently carried on 
a commendable study of the efforts of 
the Linn County economic action pro-
gram and brought their findings to the 
attention of the people of northeast Iowa. 
I would like to introduce into the 
RECORD at this point the news analysis 
of this matter carried by WMT on Octo-
ber 11, 1965: 
WMT NEWS CENTER BROADCAST, 6 P.M., MON-
DAY, Odrcoma 11, 1965 
Linn County's economic action program?
EAP as its initiates?is trying to fight pov-
erty by diagnosing it, finding out where it 
Is and who has it, then treating it by helping 
the disadvantaged to help themselves on a 
nighborhood basis. 
In our last night's report we saw how coun-
cils of residents in each of three low-income 
neighborhoods are doing this locally with 
the help of LEAP administrator Leslie Num-
mela and his staff, through an extension of 
existing social service programs. On a broader 
level, LEAP and its parent organization?
United Community Services?have held sev-
eral meetings with four volunteer task force 
committees studying what's needed and how 
to fill the need in urban renewal and hous-
ing, education, health, and welfare, and em-
ployment. 
But the most intriguing part of all this is 
the system of services the LEAP staff is build-
ing?a dozen new programs to attack poverty 
from 12 different angles. 
Furthest along is the neighborhood in-
school youth crops which should be getting 
a $150,000 Federal grant sometime next week, 
to help 228 students in 13 Linn County high 
schools finance their education by finding 
work in the schools for 10 hours a week. This 
is being administered by the County Board 
of Education and should be underway by 
November 1. 
For high school dropouts, there's an out-
of-school youth corps for 30 to 50 young 
men, providing up to 32 hours of work with 
a local sponsoring agency, in this case, the 
YMCA. It's aimed at getting the dropout 
back in school, ultimately. USC approval of 
this is expected shortly. 
Then there's Operation Head Start, de-
signed to prepare disadvantaged children for 
a formal education, through a 30-week pre-
school. A State administered 8-week pro-
gram of this type was held last summer, and 
volunteer teachers had nothing but praise 
for it. LEAP is now working up an ap-
plication to make it year-round. 
LEAP has worked up an application for 
about $16,000 for a foster home finding serv-
ice to overcome a serious local shortage of 
such homes in this area.

lthat when we have passed a law, we have 
solved a problem. But it is not that easy. 
You don't win a war just by giving your 
troops some uniforms and ammunition. This 
Congress has drafted many charters of na-
tional progress this year, but making laws 
is only the first step in the resolution of 
national problents. 
LAWS TO ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
These laws must be transformed by dedi-
cated people at all levels, into solid accom-
plishments. A voting rights law must be 
tested and implemented. A poverty pro-
gram will fp without dedicated efforts in 
communities throughout America. An aid-
to-education program stands or falls on the 
efforts. of our teachers, educators, and ad-
ministrators. And all of our legislative 
achievements must be guarded against those 
who fought them all the way and are de-
termined that they shall fail. 
And it must be added that most of these 
programs will require substantially greater 
appropriations by the Congress in future 
years. 
I deeply believe that, in the programs we 
have enacted this year and in years_ before, 
we have the beginning of the answer to 
Selma, or Watts, or Appalachia. But we 
don't have the answer to Berkeley. We are 
working as never before to break down un-
just racial or economic or social or geographic 
barriers, but we have not always provided 
meaningful lives to those who have over-
come these barriers, or who never had to 
face them. 
This is the problem of Berkeley, the prob-
lem of those who seem to have everything 
but feel they have nothing. 
Men search for their identity, for a sense 
of their importance and worth, for work 
where they can make a personal creative con-
tribution to the life of their community, 
State, Nation, and world. Too often today 
they do not find it. 
As Goodwin said, "We went swiftly and 
hopefully ahead, assuming that if we built 
and grew rich we would create the conditions 
? of a full life. We were wrong. These things 
were good and necessary. But they were way 
stations, not the destination, on the road 
to the Great Society." 
BUILDING GREAT SOCIETY 
And the answer to our larger predicament 
still escapes us. How do we build a Great 
Society which gives every individual a chance 
to live a meaningful life, to feel like a par-
ticipant in America and not some distant 
spectator, to do work in which he can take 
pride? 
I don't know the answer, and I wonder if 
anyone does yet. And since we don't know 
the answer, we don't know yet whether this 
is something that can be solved by legisla-
tion, whether at the Federal or at the State 
or local level. But we do know we must 
search for solutions wherever they can be 
found. 
We do know that we cannot provide a con-
trived answer. You can't do it with some 
giant advertising campaign, with billboards 
and TV spot announcements telling people to 
"feel important." We can't solve the prob-
lem with computers, by developing a system 
of electronic people processing such as some 
people have proposed. 
And just as we know what we can't do, I 
think we also know some of the things we 
can do. 
For example, we can ask not just whether 
our economy is producing enough jobs, but 
whether they are the kind of jobs that are 
worthy of a lifetime of human effort. We 
must seek to develop the kind of national 
life which provides, above all, opportunities 
for men to give, to create, to build, to sense 
In their own lives their ?personal contribution 
to their society. 
We can think of men not just as spec-
tators, but as participants. 
And we can, above all, call upon all Amer-
ican citizens to rise to a higher plateau of 
public commitment. John F. Kennedy put 
this call in memorable form when he said, 
"Ask not what your country can do for you?
ask what you can do for your country." 
YOUNG AIVIERIGA ANSWERS 
Young America answered that call with 
enthusiasm beyond all we could have ex-
pected, and the Peace Corps is a monu-
ment to that response, irrefutable evidence 
of your thirst for work that is important and 
meaningful. 
And, there are hundreds and thousands 
of opportunities in teaching, in youth coun-
seling, and work with the poor, in civil 
rights, in conservation, in humane law en-
forcement, in the clergy, in arts and human-
ities and in many other walks of life where 
young Americans can make a public com-
mitment to serve their country and their 
communities, and in this process bring new 
State, or Nation. 
And finally, as so many of you at the con-
vention have already discovered, you can 
find much of your answer, as individuals, by 
your participation in this political party. 
Your lives are richer, more meaningful, 
because of your commitment to a lifetime of 
liberal involvement, to making America the 
kind of just, progressive, human society we 
all know it can be and must be. 
Some of you can fulfill this commitment 
by running for political office?as a number 
of you already have?by seeking the rare 
privilege of political leadership in your town, 
State, or Nation. 
Others of you will do work that is equally 
imported by active participation at all 
levels of our political party. 
MEANING to LIFE 
By making this commitment, you know 
that you are sharing in the accomplishments 
which are and will be our greatest reward. 
And in working with others who share this 
commitment, you will build lasting human 
friendships with the Nation's best citizens. 
These things, as so many of you have already 
found in our Democratic Party, can bring 
deep and permanent meaning to your lives. 
For those persons who are in politics for 
money, or ego satisfaction or to pull the 
strings of political power, our answer is?
we'd all be better off if they would quit right 
now. 
But the overwhelming majority of dele-
gates here tonight would not be here if they 
had not already made their commitment to 
a lifetime of meaningful dedication to a 
better America. 
You have joined this great political party 
not for what you hope to receive, but what 
you can give. You are asking to serve your 
fellow Americans, and to work to build the 
Great Society. 
By making this commitment, you can pro-
vide your own personal answer to the search 
for meaning in modern life. 
And in finding your own answer, you are 
helping to find an answer for the Nation as a 
whole. 
t's Time To Speak Up 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. WILLIAM J. GREEN 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 1965 
Mr. GREEN of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, a lot has been said and written 
about the war in Vietnam and the reac-
tion to our commitments in that country 
here at home. This week, the commu-
nity newspaper chain which publishes 
four weekly neighborhood papers in 
Philadelphia, ran an unprecedented front 
page editorial on the recent demonstra-
tions against our policy. This editorial 
impressed me as a sound and mature ex-
pression of opinion which I feel is indica-
tive of the feelings of the vast majority 
of the American people. 
Under unanimous consent, I insert this 
editorial in the Appendix of the RECORD: 
IT'S TIME To SPEAK UP 
The circus-like demonstrations over the 
past weekend protesting our Nation's pres-
ence in Vietnam was insulting to the in-
telligence of most thinking Americans. We 
uphold the right of any group, no matter 
how small in numbers and how fuzzy in 
thinking, to demonstrate for or against any-
thing they choose. In this recent nationwide 
series of demonstrations it is perfectly un-
derstandable why so many young people and 
college students participated. The draft 
boards are breathing closely down the backs 
of so many of our youth, and they, as well 
as the rest of the Nation, have every right 
to be very concerned about events in Vietnam 
and other places in the world. 
But it seems to us that the demonstra-
tors have completely missed the whole point 
of our presence in Vietnam. We are there 
because of commitments made by our Gov-
ernment some time ago. Our President has 
made it abundantly clear many times that 
our Government is willing to negotiate a 
cessation of hostilities any time and any 
place without any qualifications. 
No one in the country, certainly not our 
President nor our chosen leaders, wishes to 
continue the costly warfare in South Viet-
nam for its own sake. We are there to fulfill 
one of many of our Nation's commitments 
to free and peaceful nations throughout the 
world. For our country to renege or back 
out of any commitment at this juncture in 
world history would be, in our opinion, fool-
hardy and disastrous. It would completely 
undermine our commitments and relations 
with all countries of the world. It would cer-
tainly weaken our role as one of the leaders 
of the free world. 
It is certainly not an easy task our Nation 
faces. No words here will console the be-
reaved families of men who are killed or 
wounded in Vietnam. But peace and freedom 
exact a terrible and high price from its 
champions. And a responsibility, too. Our 
responsibility is to keep faith with those 
people with whom we have made commit-
ments and alliances. We agree that the price 
may be high, but we feel that our honor is 
at stake.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? APPENDIX October 22, 1965 
Jerry Leopaldi, president of Local 447, ME, 
AFL-CIO, which represents the employees at 
ITTFL, Clifton, N.J., has been named chair-
man and coordinator of this committee, as 
the idea for the committee originated at the 
executive board of Local 447 ICE, AFL-CIO. 
Gov. Richard J. Hughes has accepted the 
honorary chairmanship of the committee. 
The Governor stated that "I and the full 
resources of my office will be placed squarely 
behind this fine effort. This type of activity 
goes a long way in helping to offset the false 
illusion of nonsupport of our Government's 
role in Vietnam caused in many instances 
by what appears to be Communist inspired 
anti-American activities." 
Mr. Leopaldi announced that all inter-
ested people, regardless of their party affili-
ations, and whether or not they are members 
of the labor movement, are invited to join 
and support the efforts of the committee. 
Anyone interested in joining can write or 
phone Mr. Leopaldi at 25 Washington Ave-
nue, Nutley, N.J., 07110. Phone: 667-4107. 
The committee is presently evaluating 
several projects to be undertaken for our 
troops in Vietnam which are designed to help 
improve their morale and make the coming 
religious holidays more meaningful. 
When the final decision on these projects 
is reached, a fund drive will be immediately 
undertaken to finance and implement this 
program which will demonstrate to our sons 
and relatives in Vietnam that we do care. 
Toward the Great Society?Appalachia 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. ROBERT E. JONES 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 1965 
Mr. JONES of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, 
wedged between the rich east coast and 
the prosperous Middle West is Appal-
achia, the Nation's largest economically 
depressed area. In this 165,000-square-
mile area, 16 million people live. One 
out of every three families lives on an 
annual income of $3,000 or less. Annual 
per capita income in Appalachia is 35 
percent below that for the rest of the 
Nation. Unemployment is 50 percent 
higher than the national rate. The gen-
eral low standard of living prevailing 
means poor educational opportunities, 
Inadequate food, substandard housing, 
poor clothing, poor health and sanita-
tion facilities. There is one overriding 
characteristic of the entire 11-State 
area?the burning desire of the young 
to get away and the diminishing hope of 
the older folks who stay behind. 
At the request of the Governors of the 
Appalachian States, the Democratic ad-
ministration proposed a program of re-
vitalization for this economically starved 
area. The 89th Congress approved the 
Appalachia Regional Development Act 
to accelerate the economic development 
of the area in order to raise the stand-
ards of human existence in Appalachia 
to a level comparable to the rest of the 
United States. This new program is 
aimed at overcoming the basic deficien-
cies of the region?difficult access, un-
controlled water resources, poorly man-
aged physical resources, and a general 
lack of the public facilities which stim-
ulate economic growth. 
The Federal-State-local effort to bring 
new economic life to this area is coordi-
nated by the Appalachian Regional Com-
mission composed of the 11 State Gov-
ernors. Congress has authorized $1.1 bil-
lion to get Appalachia moving again?
to open the doors of this economically 
isolated area to more tourists and to 
more industry. 
Lying between two great population 
centers, the eastern seaboard and the 
Midwest, Appalachia represents a poten-
tial market and source of raw materials, 
as well as a major recreational area for 
these enormous concentrations of popu-
lation. None of this potential can be 
realized until the isolation of the region 
is overcome. Over the next 5 years $840 
million will be used to construct 2,350 
miles of development highways and 1,000 
miles of local access roads. The Federal 
share will be 70 percent and the State 
share 30 percent. 
Another $41 million will go for the con-
struction of health facilities, including 
hospitals, regional diagnostic and treat-
ment centers, and $28 million will go for 
the operation of the health facilities. 
The Federal Government will pay 80 per-
cent of the construction costs and 100 
percent of the initial operating cost. 
After the first 2 years the Federal share 
of operating costs will be 50 percent. 
Other millions of dollars will go into 
construction of vocational education 
schools, development of water resources, 
sewerage treatment plants, soil con-
servation and land improvement, im-
provement of timber production and 
marketing, and restoration of mine-
scarred land. 
The program is designed only to pro-
vide initial Federal assistance, until 
July 1971. By that time it is hoped that 
revitalization will be sufficiently under-
way, and the States will continue their 
cooperative effort to develop the full po-
tential of the region. 
This is but part of the overall effort to 
bring Appalachia out of the poverty 
straits. It is geared largely to economic 
needs. Other Federal efforts, such as 
the antipoverty program and the elemen-
tary and secondary education bill, are 
concentrating on human needs. 
In the words of President Johnson: 
Giving a man a chance to work and feed 
his family and provide for his children does 
not destroy his initiative. Hunger destroys 
initiative. Hopelessness destroys initiative. 
Ignorance destroys initiative. A cold and 
indifferent government destroys initiative. 
How the United States Got Involved in 
Vietnam 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. GEORGE E. BROWN, JR. 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 1965 
Mr. BROWN of California. Mr. 
Speaker, one of my colleagues was kind 
enough to insert in the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD, October 20, 1965, page '26788, a 
letter from the Honorable RICHARD 
Icnosn to me on the subject of Robert 
Scheer's pamphlet entitled "How the 
United States Got Involved in Vietnam." 
The letter was accompanied by an en-
closure containing information on Mr. 
'Scheer's background?taken from the 
files of the House Committee on Un-
American Activities. I am taking the 
Iliberty, therefore, of inserting in the 
RECORD my reply to Mr. ICHORD'S letter. 
The reply follows: 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, D.C., October 21, 1965. 
Hon. RICHARD ICHORD, 
Longworth House Office Building. 
DEAR Dicx: I appreciate the fact that you 
took the trouble to read the pamphlet, "How 
the United States Got Involved in Vietnam," 
by Robert Scheer, and also took the trouble 
to give me your evaluation of it. 
I should make it clear that I am not al-
leging the authenticity of everything Mr. 
Scheer says. However, this material is re-
ceiving widespread publication, not only 
through this pamphlet but in other publica-
tions, and deserves review and analysis by 
those concerned with our role in Vietnam. 
Only by such review and analysis, not just 
of this but of other pertinent material, can 
we reach an understanding of history and 
avoid some of the errors of the past. We all 
know how difficult it is to get reliable infor-
mation on controversial issues such as Viet-
nam, sometimes even from Government 
sources. While I do not share the view of 
nry Republican colleagues that "The figures 
that are fed to the press and the public by 
the administration contradict each other 
and surpass belief" (Vietnam?Some Ne-
glected Aspects of the Historical Record?
issued by the Republican Conference of the 
House of Representatives, Aug. 25, 1965), 
I do agree that adequate and accurate in-
formation is a problem. 
As to Mr. Scheer's background, as revealed 
by the files of the Committee on Un-Ameri-
can Activities, I can understand how that 
would trouble you. I do not intend to de-
fend his associations and activities, since I 
presume that he can do that more ably than 
I, if necessary. However, I am concerned 
about the two points which you take issue 
with in his pamphlet. 
You state first that "the publication is 
filled with half-tfuths, distortions, implica-
tions, innuendos and inferences which lead 
one to believe that Ho Chi Minh is the George 
Washington of Vietnam ? ? *." Mr. Scheer 
is certainly not unique in thus representing 
Ho Chi Minh. Numerous prior writers have 
done so, of which I will cite only Robert 
Trumbull, who refers to him thus on page 
204 of his book, "The Scrutable East," and 
Edgar Snow, on page 695 of his book, "The 
Other Side of the River." Your own Com-
mittee on Un-American Activities, in its bi-
ography of Ho Chi Minh published October 
25, 1957, which obviously was not trying to 
be complimentary, said,"* ? ? the legendary 
figure of 'Uncle Ho' was entrenched in the 
minds of the Vietnamese people?not as a 
Communist but as a revered father of inde-
pendence. The myth of the national libera-
tor was so effectively instilled that not even 
the French risked a personal attack upon 
the name of Ho Chi Minh as they endeavored 
to bare the threat of communism." 
If it is true that Ho Chi Minh has a public 
image as a "revered father of independence" 
or a "national liberator" as your committee 
states, then attacking Mr. Scheer for saying 
it may not be very logical. Perhaps we ought 
to deal with the fact, rather than attack 
Mr. Scheer.

October 22, 1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- APPENDIX 
ALR AND WATER POLLUTION 
We urge the State to take steps to avoid 
the serious problems of air pollution because 
of industry or automobiles. The time to 
act is now, not when air pollution has 
reached a dangerous level. 
We regret the defeat of Senator Berman's 
bill calling for antismog devices to be in-
stalled in autos. We hope the next session 
of the State legislature will approve such a 
measure. 
We commend the legislature for passing 
a program designed to alleviate water pol-
lution conditions in New York State. 
We commend Councilman Robert Low, of 
Manhattan, in his fight against air pollution 
in this State. 
FLOURIDATION 
We support the institution of foundation 
of the water supply of all communities of 
New York State. We urge all Democratic 
Party organizations to support this proven 
health measure. 
MENTAL HEALTH 
We believe that the State of New York 
should increase its role in the field of men-
tal health. The problems of the diseases 
of the mind and their high degree of in-
stances, plagues our whole society. 
We 'urge the State to increase its center 
for mental health. We also urge greater 
State aid to increse and expand facilities 
of existing mental health centers. Present 
facilities are simply not enbugh to cope 
with the large amount of our citizens who 
are stricken with the tragic problems of 
mental illness. 
SPEAKER BAN DECISION 
We strongly support the decision of the 
New York State Appellate Court permitting 
Communists to speak at the State univer-
? We believe that the essence of democracy 
is to give free reign to ideas and criticism. 
We are confident that in an atmosphere in 
which all thoughts can be examined, men 
have the right to decide for themselves and 
Will not be misled to accept concepts which 
would destroy those conditions which permit 
them the fullest opportunity to develop as 
individuals. 
We urge the university of the State of New 
York to abide by the court's decision and we 
hope that New York's private institutions of 
higher education will follow the spirit of the 
decision. 
DIVORCE LAWS 
We urge the State legislature to modify 
New York's present antiquated divorce laws 
to include at least mental and physical 
cruelty as grounds for divorce. 
MARRIAGE COUNSELORS 
We urge the legislature to pass legislation 
to license all marriage counselors. 
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
That higher taxes may be needed to sup-
port this effort should not provent its pro-
motion. Those segments of the community 
which are well off have a moral responsibility 
to help those who need assistance. We also 
urge the board of education to continue its 
efforts for more State aid to help meet the 
costs of New York City's educational system. 
In addition, we believe that the board of 
education should take steps to provide for a 
cultural training program for teachers so 
that all teachers will be familiar with the 
cultural background of their pupils. 
We urge the continuance and expansion 
of the prekindergarten program which has 
been tried and has proven successful. 
NEW YORK CITY FINANCES 
It is clear that the city of New York does 
not have the revenues it needs to meet the 
requirements of the people of the city, nor 
has it always utilized the finances at its 
Command wisely. In order to correct this 
situation, we strongly recommend (1) imple-
mentation of a city income tax and elimina-
tion of the city sales tax; (2) appointment of 
a committee of outstanding economists, 
businessmen, and labor leaders to investi-
gate and recommend new areas for taxation 
and elimination of unfair or antiquated 
taxes in existence today; (3) passage of 
Mayor Wagner's off-track betting proposals. 
We regret the inaction of many local legis-
lators in behalf of the latter bill. 
We further recommend that New York 
City and its suburbs receive a fairer propor-
tion of State revenues. It is unfair for New 
York City to pay 60 percent of the New York 
State taxes and receive only 40 percent back 
in terms of services. 
MOBILIZATION FOR YOUTH 
We support mobilization for youth and the 
fine work it has done in combating juvenile 
delinquency on the Lower East Side. We 
hope this organization's programs will be 
continued for many years to come, and we 
deplore the nature of the attacks that a 
number of public officials have leveled 
against mobilization for youth. 
RECREATIONAL FACILITIES 
To prevent the human waste that all too 
often results from deprivation and boredom, 
we urge the mayor to consider the construc-
tion of more and better equipped recreation 
facilities. We urge Governor Rockefeller to 
pursue a similar policy with respect to the 
State as a whole. 
We applaud the efforts of the committee 
on parks and playgrounds in this area. We 
hope the mayor will continue his efforts in 
this area, as recreational facilities are one 
remedy for the delinquency problem. 
We urge the creation of several small vest-
pocket parks to make life more bearable in 
ghetto neighborhoods. 
Newbold Morris has done much fine work. 
The mayor, board of estimate, and city plan-
ning commission should support his efforts 
to obtain additional municipal park acreage 
on Staten Island; at least 2,000 acres should 
be acquired in the next few years, since by 
1976 the island's population will have soared. 
WOMEN'S HOUSE OF DETENTION 
The overcrowding and moral transgression 
in this miserable jail must be relieved, and 
charges of brutality against prison guards 
must be thoroughly investigated. The wom-
en's house of detention has survived many 
scandals, but it must not be allowed to sur-
vive the latest one. The city has been talk-
ing about doing something to improve this 
jail for more than 10 years; the time for 
action is now. 
Ralph Coghlan 
MCTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. PRANK THOMPSON, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 1965 
Mr. THOMPSON of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, it is always saddening to re-
ceive news of the passing of a friend. 
It is especially regretful when that death 
removes from our midst a person who 
has honored his profession and bright-
ened the national scene. Such a man 
was Ralph Coghlan, a distinguished 
journalist and a warm and witty human 
being. I know of no better tribute a 
man can receive than the honor and 
esteem of his colleagues. The following 
editorial from the October 20 edition of 
the Washington Post sets forth a view 
?A5995 
of Ralph Coghlan which, I am sure, will 
find wide favor among those who ad-
mired and respected him. It reads as 
follows!, 
RALPH COCHLAN 
Ralph Ooghlan probably was not widely 
known to the general public, but a great 
many newspaper readers enjoy more cogent 
commentaries today because of his stimulus. 
As editor of the editorial page of the St. Louis 
Post-Dispatch until his retirement in 1960, 
he was a foremost practitioner of his belief 
that editorials should have something to say 
and should say it crisply and forcefully. 
Ralph _Coghlan ran a great editorial page. 
He was not always reasonable, and his cru-
sades sometimes led to distortions, but he 
was always warmhearted, scrappy, provoca-
tive and indignant with dithering. 
Editorials, he felt, should serve a higher 
purpose than "pants pressing"?a phrase he 
borrowed from Henry Meneken?and he 
could be just as scathing in attacking the 
pomposity of the press as he could be ir-
reverent in categorizing the foibles of public 
officials. His ability to infuse others with 
his enthusiasm brought formation of the 
National Conference of Editorial Writers, 
which has spread his concern with the con-
science and the equality of the editorial page. 
Although he is now dead at 68, his influerce 
continues to make itself felt. 
Support of Vietnam Policy by Newark, 
NJ., International Electrical, Radio & 
Machine Workers 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JOSEPH G. MINISH 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 1965 
Mr. MINISH. Mr. Speaker, as coun-
teraction to the current demonstrations 
against our Vietnam policy, District 3, 
International Union of Electrical, Radio, 
& Machine Workers, AFL-CIO, Newark, 
N.J., has undertaken a vigorous cam-
paign to make clear that the great 
majority of Americans are opposed to 
capitulation to Communist aggression. 
The men and women who comprise dis-
trict 3 are most anxious to achieve an 
honorable settlement of the critical 
Vietnamese situation. Indeed they have 
an especial stake since for the most part 
it is the sons of working people who must 
bear the brunt of battle. But, never 
having dwelled in ivory towers, the peo-
ple's sturdy commonsense tells them 
that aggressors are impressed only by 
strength and determination. 
As a longtime member of district 3 
prior to my service in Congress, I am 
proud of my fellow members and I salute 
their efforts. 
The following statement gives the de-
tails of the campaign: 
PRESS RELEASE BY DLSTRICT No, 3, IUE 
Milton Weihrauch, president of District 3, 
IUE AFL-CIO, announced that a committee 
is now being formed for the purpose of 
undertaking a campaign designed to let our 
troops in Vietnam, the South Vietnamese 
people, and everyone else, know that the 
overwhelming majority of American citizens 
support the policy of our Government in 
Vietnam.

October:12, 1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD APPENDIX 
Your other point of difference with the 
pamphlet was that it "* * * implies that 
our involvement in Vietnam was the result 
of a plot carried out by such distinguished 
Americans as ? * 5" and you name several 
names. 1 share your belief that such impli-
cations have very little foundation. Again, 
however, it is a position taken by other pre-
sumably well-informed people and needs to 
be dealt with. For example, Mr. Hilaire du 
Barrier, a former member of the French Re-
sistance in Indochina, an employee of the 
OBS., an "aide" to a Diem delegate to Wash-
ington, and a frequest writer for conservative 
publications, is quoted as being "* * * in 
agreement with some liberal critics of' our 
Vietnam policy in regarding the American 
Friends of Vietnam Committee as having 
functioned as a pro-Diem `Lobby'." 
The point I am trying to make, Dick, is 
that it is better to deal with the realities 
of whatever Scheer says rather than to at-
tack his reputation or associations. 
Sincerely, 
GEORGE E. BROWN, JR., 
Member of Congress. 
'Wizardry' on Trial 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. WILLIAM F. RYAN 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 1965 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, Murray 
Kempton writing in the New York World 
Telegram and Sun on October 20, 1965, 
reported on the current hearings being 
conducted by the House Committee on 
Un-American Activities. I am sure all 
of my colleagues will be interested in 
reading the following article: 
[From the New York World Telegram and 
Sun, Oct. 20, 1965] 
KEMPTON SEES WIZARDRY ON TR/AL 
(By Murray Kempton) 
WASHINGTON, October 20.?In Alabama, 
Lowndes County gives every sign of moving 
to acquit Collie Wilkins Jr., a Ku Klux 
Klansman without visible rank, of murder 
on the highway. - 
And up here the House Committee on 
Un-American Activities is trying, in full 
passion, to hang Robert Shelton, imperial 
wizard of all the United mans, for fooling 
the First National Bank of Tuscaloosa with 
the forged signature of a fictitious party on 
his corporation's checking account. 
There are crimes no nation under law can 
brook. 
The Un-American Activities Committee 
began its trip through the invisible empire 
the way it begins all its great occasions, with 
its chairman invisible behind the backs of 
cameramen. 
Chairman Enwix E. WILLIS, Democrat, of 
Louisiana, managed at last to lower that 
curtain and got over the formal insincerities 
about how fairly every fair witness could 
expect to be treated and introduced Chief 
Investigator Don Appell, to give us a sum-
mary of the many books and treaties that 
exist on the subject. 
Don Appell responded with a handsome 
summary of the Klan's history; but he did 
not read any formal text of what wild sur-
mise had hoped might be a freshly discovered 
treaty between some Alabama wizard and 
some Alabama Governor, and that was the 
first disappointment. Chairman WILLIS had 
meant to say "treatise." 
Appell then moved to the present tense. 
He described an invisible empire split rather 
like our own Democratic Party, among small 
businessmen. As always the Un-American 
Activities Committee was dealing with a 
menace too terrible to distract anyone's at-
tention with concrete membership figures; 
but the largest seemed to be the United 
Klans of America, Robert Shelton, imperial 
wizard, with such attendant genii as the im-
perial klockard, his propaganda director, and 
the imperial kludd, his chaplain. 
We had begun in comedy, and for the 
moment one forgot that Robert Shelton's 
koustomers quite often end their hours of 
recreation with the murder of strangers and 
could begin to reflect how the country's sense 
of proportion might be improved if Jack 
Valenti could be introduced as special klock-
ard for the President of the United States 
and Norman Vincent Peale as resident kludd 
of the Marble Collegiate Church. 
There was put in exhibit a list of all the 
Klanklaverns known to exist: the Paul Re-
vere Historical Society of Jacksonville; the 
Ancient City Gun Club of St. Augustine; the 
West Orange Sportsmen's Club; the South 
Pikymarksmen's Association of McComb, 
Miss.; the Craven County Improvement As-
sociation of New Bern, N.C.; the Saddle Club 
of Bunn, N.C. 
All these documents seemed harmless 
enough in the Un-American Activities Com-
mittee's tradition, which is to compile lists 
without ever saying just what it is the peo-
ple on them do. But they must have terrified 
Robert Shelton, perhaps because it is so 
much an article of the Klan's faith that any 
list is evidence of a conspiracy; and he seems 
to have decided that the committee had 
him. 
He had promised the committee on Mon-
day that he would testify freely and no 
doubt with patriotic gusto, but then he went 
off to lunch at the congressional with his 
counsel and his genii and he came to the 
stand stooped and sullen under the mantle 
of the fifth amendment. 
He began clutching at the only dignity 
he had left, which was that of the small, 
free enterpriser. "Are you asking me as an 
individual or the president of a corporation?" 
he replied when first requested to produce 
his books and records. "That question is 
not relevant and germaine to this inquiry." 
Then Chairman WI:ma instructed him to 
reply and he answered that he honestly 
believed that an answer might incriminate 
him and that he was availing himself of his 
rights under "amendments (low voice) 5th, 
(loud voice) 1st, 4th (lowered voice), and 
14th to the Constitution of the (full bellow) 
United States of America." 
There followed the unappetizing congres-
sional sport of clumsy enticements and clum-
sier taunts to see how many different times 
a hostile witness can be put through the 
recital of his resort to the fifth amendment. 
The record is generally accepted as 115 and 
was set by one of Jimmy Hoffa's bravoes un-
der treatment by Senator JoHrr L. MoCLEL-
LAN, Democrat, of Arkansas. Chairman 
Wrims got Robert Shelton up to an unofficial 
78 by such ingenious devices as asking him 
occasionally whether he was taking the fifth 
amendment to avoid incriminating himself 
and getting the reply, "I decline to answer, 
etc." Shelton was to be back today and 
seems a cinch for the record. 
After such sport, Don Appell turned to 
the subject of the Alabama Rescue Fund, 
a Klan subsidiary organized by Shelton in 
the early 1960's. Like those of any proper 
Alabama corporation, its checks required the 
Signature of a president and treasurer; and 
Shelton, like any proper president, had filed 
with the First National Bank of Tuscaloosa 
as authorized to draw on the Alabama Res-
cue Fund's account his signature as presi-
dent and those first of T. L. Montgomery and 
later of James J. Hendrix as treasurer. 
A5997 
Now, Appell asked, weren't T. L. Mont-
gomery and James J. Hendrix entirely fic-
tional characters and wasn't the signature 
purporting to be Montgomery's that of Carol 
Long, Shelton's secretary, and wasn't indeed 
the signature purporting to be Hendrix' that 
of Mrs. Robert L. Shelton herself? 
Shelton continued his litany of refusal to 
answer, and Carol Long and Mrs. Shelton ap-
peared to join him in involving, among other 
things, that 14th amendment which en-
chanted the South. Then they all sat down 
and the committee produced its handwriting 
expert whose pointer danced over blown-up 
photostats of signatures, convincing nobody 
of his proof quite so much as the Sheltons, 
who were riveted in the attention every 
Klansman knows any document deserves as 
evidence, just for being a piece of paper no 
matter what it says. 
The hour is at hand. No southern jury 
will take this. Mrs. Viola Lee Liuzzo is un-
likely ever to be avenged, but the First Na-
tional Bank of Tuscaloosa is sure to be. You 
might be able to get away with murder but 
Just don't try messing with a bank. 
Higher Education Act of 1965 
SPEECH 
Or 
HON. WILLIAM F. RYAN 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE ROUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 1965 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, today we 
are committed to the war against poverty 
in our country. 
The different forms poverty takes are 
sadly familiar. There is hunger and 
undernourishment. Many schoolchil-
dren arrive each day at school without 
any breakfast and return home to din-
ners of peanut butter and jelly. There 
is chronic ill health. There is unem-
ployment and underemployment. For 
too many Americans there is no home 
arid no joy. 
The causes of this devastating poverty 
are many, surely. But, at the heart of 
this problem is lack of education. For 
lack of education and training is what, 
in most cases, makes it impossible for a 
person to qualify for available jobs. It 
is what limits a mother's knowledge of 
how to budget properly and how best to 
feed her family. And, it is what inhibits 
learning and putting into practice bene-
ficial health measures. 
A National Teacher Corps, specially 
trained and dedicated, can be one of the 
best instruments for providing disadvan-
taged youngsters in our urban and rural 
slums with the kind of education they 
need to lift themselves out of poverty. 
The National Teacher Corps proposed 
by title V of the Higher Education Act is 
patterned after the Peace Corps. 
The National Teacher Corps would 
give highly motivated individuals who are 
now teachers, or who want to become 
teachers, the opportunity to serve their 
country and their fellow man by teach-
ing the children of our poor. 
Basically, the program would operate 
in this way. 
First, members of the National Teach-
ers Corps will be specially trained and 
oriented for teaching service in schools

with large numbers of underprivileged 
youth. Equipped with these special 
teaching skills, and with a broad under-
standing of the problems of the under-
privileged, they will be ready to go into 
schools to teach. 
Once in these schools, the members 
of the National Teaching Corps will ap-
ply specialized training to help give edu-
cationally underprivileged youngsters the 
particular enriched learning experiences 
they need in order to bridge the heritage 
of dispair. Understanding the children's 
handicaps, the teachers will be better 
able and prepared to teach these stu-
dents the academic skills that must be 
mastered to be successful in school and 
in life, and to begin to enjoy both. And, 
they will introduce their pupils to the re-
warding world of cultural life around 
them?a life which heretofore has been 
remote or unknown. 
In order to attract a wide variety of 
dedicated teachers, and also, to train a 
new supply of teachers, the membership 
of the National Teacher Corps will com-
prise both experienced teachers and col-
lege graduates who wish to be teachers. 
The experienced teachers will work in 
schools singly or as members or leaders 
of teaching teams. They will contribute 
both to the schools in which they will 
teach and to the young would-be teach-
ers at their side. 
To the classrooms of the disad-
vantaged the experienced teachers will 
bring their many years of teaching. The 
children and youth they teach will have 
the opportunity of being instructed by 
individuals who have had a wide range 
of educational experience and a deep 
knowledge of the art of teaching. 
To the young teacher-interns in the 
program, these experienced teachers 
would also serve as instructors through 
leading in-service training programs 
carried out in cooperation with institu-
tions of, higher education. They would 
help, to teach these young teacher-in-
terns classroom skills while these young 
Instructors are actually on the job in the 
schools of the underprivileged. 
The teacher-interns, for their part, 
will contribute vigor and enthusiasm to 
the classrooms of the disadvantaged. 
Their original and fresh ideas and ap-
proaches will stimulate an atmosphere 
of excitement about learning which can-
not help but communicate itself to chil-
dren and youth who need to be convinced 
of the. value, wonder, and pleasure of 
learning. 
Teacher interns who will already have 
BA, degrees would also be continuing 
their schooling at a nearby institution of 
higher education while they are actually 
teaching. At the end of their 2 years of 
service in the Corps teacher-interns 
would be able to have earned an advanced 
degree in education. With this degree, 
plus their training in the teaching of the 
disadvantaged and their actual 2 years 
of practicing this knowledge, members of 
the National Teacher Corps would be well 
prepared to teach underprivileged chil-
? dren. As a group, they would also pro-
vide a valuable supply of well-prepared 
future teachers for America's youth. 
Although the cost of the program 
would be borne entirely by the Federal 
Government, the members of the Na-
tional Teacher Corps will not be em-
ployees of the Federal Government but 
will be, in effect, a part of the local 
school system. Federal funds will go to 
the local education agency which will 
pay the Teacher Corps members and di-
rectly supervise them. 
The pay of the teacher in the Teacher 
Corps will be the same as for teachers 
in the local school system. Members of 
the Corps who are experienced will be 
paid the same as a teacher with similar 
training, experience and duties in the 
local system plus an extra amount if they 
are leading a teaching team. Teacher-
interns will be paid at the beginning of 
the scale at the lowest rate paid by the 
local agency for full-time teachers in a 
particular school and grade. 
Mr. Speaker, the National Teacher 
Corps offers a concrete plan for attempt-
ing to raise the quality of education in 
our schools. 
It will also stimulate respect for learn-
ing on the part not only of disadvantaged 
youngsters, but also on the part of youths 
and citizens in all parts of America. 
I urge support for the Teacher Corps 
and trust that the Quie motion to re-
commit will be defeated. 
Let's Take a Real Good Look at 
Plastic Pipe 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. ROBERT E. SWEENEY 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 200.1965 
Mr. SWEENEY. Mr. Speaker, in re-
cent years there has arisen a substantial 
Federal interest in the use of ABS plastic 
pipe and fittings for DWV plumbing sys-
tems in residential and other structures. 
So profound is the general lack of knowl-
edge about this question that even the 
vocabulary is a stumbling block to one of 
the uninitiated, like myself. The letters 
DWV stand for drain, waste and vent, 
and describe the plumbing system, with 
its pipe and fittings, which is used for 
these purposes in a structure. The let-
ters ABS stand for "acrylonitrile-buta-
diene-styrene." I trust that a layman 
such as myself may be pardoned if he 
Is unable to pronounce the name of this 
complicated chemical compound. 
The area of legitimate and proper Fed-
eral concern with this problem has sev-
eral dimensions. 
A very important one arises from the 
fact that the Federal Housing Admin-
istration?FHA?must lay down condi-
tions under which it will approve the in-
surability of home loans. I, for one, 
have become very much alarmed at the 
increased rate at which homes are being 
repossessed by the Federal Government 
under terms of the FHA home loan pro-
gram. Certainly our Federal Govern-
ment should be deeply and justifiably 
concerned with the materials that go in-
to FHA-insured homes. 
To my dismay, however, I have learned 
October 21-, 1965 
that in some instances negligence exists 
in properly safeguarding FHA home 
loans. For example, homes are being 
built today in certain sections in this 
country wherein the builder has failed to 
provide the homeowner with a 5-year 
warranty which he is required to give 
under Use of Materials Bulletin No. 
UM-33, dated December 15, 1961, of the 
Architectural Standards Division, FHA. 
Specifically, the builder must, under pro-
visions of this bulletin, furnish a properly 
executed warranty to the homeowner 
which provides that the builder will "re-
pair or replace any part of ABS plastic 
vent and drainage system, hereinafter 
referred to as 'system,' installed during 
construction in the house built by seller 
on the aforementioned lot, which, during 
a period of 5 years from the date of ini-
tial occupance of original purchaser, 
proves to be defective in material or 
workmanship, provided that the defect 
shall be material to the intended use of 
the system and shall have occurred as a 
result of normal domestic usage for 
which the system was intended." 
The sad commentary is that in many 
instances the builder, the mortgage 
lender, the purchasing public, and others 
are totally unaware of this FHA require-
ment. Cases have been called to my at-
tention in which none of the parties in-
volved had ever so much as heard of the 
PHA requirement of a 5-year warranty 
for ABS plastic drainage and vent pipe 
and fittings. 
This lack of awareness of the 5-year 
warranty requirement in our building 
community is not surprising. Already 
one manufacturer of ABS plastic pipe 
has been sent a warning letter, as of 
July 29, 1965, from FHA Commissioner 
Philip N. Brownstein for circulating mis-
leading advertising and statements rela-
tive to FHA's acceptance of building ma-
terials. The company involved in this 
case stated in its advertising copy that its 
plastic pipe was "FHA-accepted." 
Even more astonishing to me?an item 
which the Commissioner could not take 
official notice of?was the preposterous 
claim by this manufacturer that his plas-
tic pipe is "never affected by chemical 
action of household waste or drain 
cleaners or by boiling water." 
For example, in the case of ABS plas-
tic pipe carrying a different brand name, 
I have seen installation Instructions is-
sued by the manufacturer describing 
this pipe as an unsatisfactory conductor 
at 72 F., for such familiar agents as ace-
tic acid, ammonia?both wet and dry?
benzene, borax, chloroform, manufac-
tured gas, iodine, naphtha, and a long 
list of other materials including the 
familiar cleaning compound, carbon 
tetrachloride. 
Does ABS plastic pipe mean one thing 
in the case of this latter pipe and some-
thing entirely different in the case of the 
manufacturer cited in the letter of Com-
missioner Brownstein? 
As recently as September 27 of this 
year, the independent testing laboratory, 
Smith-Emery Co., of Los Angeles, de-
scribes the results obtained by submerg-
ing specimens of ABS plastic pipe in 
separate containers of 28 different mate-
rials for a period of 48 hours. To me, the

resources in the way they politically wish. 
While he offers an interesting argument, it 
seems to us that he saddles the monetary 
system with more than its share of the blame. 
To see why, it is useful to recall how 
Britain came to its present pass. The exer-
cise is particularly pertinent because the 
United States to some extent seems bent on 
heading in the same direction. 
Britains balance-of-payments troubles, 
and the consequent weakness of the pound, 
stem in part from the lack of competitive-
ness of its domestic economy. The growing 
political power of unions, together with the 
complacence of management, has threaded 
make-work rules and practices throughout 
Britains industry. Featherbedding, which is 
hardly unknown in the United States, saps 
industrys domestic vitality and lessens its 
ability to sell goods abroad. Its stretching 
things to blame those conditions on undue 
obeisance to stable money. 
As a matter of fact, the behavior of both 
nations is cause for skepticism about their 
devotion to such stability. In both, govern-
mental budget deficits and artificially easy 
money long have been almost a way of life. 
In Britain this proclivity already has led to 
substantial price inflation, which has helped 
push up wage costs at home and made Brit-
ish goods even harder to market abroad. 
Britain at least appears to be, trying to 
come to grips with its twin problems of in-
efficiency and inflation, though the outlook 
for some of its efforts is at best dubious. 
It is questionable, for example, whether the 
nation will actually revitalize its industries 
with its tax on imports, which in effect puts 
a higher protective tariff wall around its do-
mestic factories. 
Moreover, it's doubtful that the London 
government will have the political courage to 
try to curb the insatiable demands of labor 
unions. If anything, labor unions seem 
more out of hand under a labor government 
than they did under the Tory regime. 
Conceivably matters may by now have de-
generated so far in Britain that, as Mr. 
Hirsch contends, the pound should be at 
once devalued. No matter how highly any-
one values monetary stability, it's only fool-
ish to insist that it exists when it patently 
? doesn't. 
It would be even more foolish, Mr. Hirsch 
also recognizes, to believe that devaluation 
by itself would solve everything; at best it 
is only a recognition of past mistakes. With 
the slate wiped clean, a nation then must 
manage its monetary affairs sensibly if it is 
not to sink into one devaluation after an-
other. 
That does not require a government to run 
budget surpluses every single year and keep 
money right under all circumstances. But 
it does mean it cannot forever insist on the 
opposite. To do so is not to promote sound 
economic growth but, in the not very long 
run, to seriously endanger it. 
A government runs such risks when, as in 
the United States it seems determined not to 
dampen the union urge for inefficiency but 
to enhance it, when it follows inflationary 
domestic policies, when it applies no more 
than paliatives at best to its balance-of-
payments deficits. 
It boils down, we think, to a fairly simple 
equation: If governments could control 
their political passions, they would not con-
front the problem of money becoming a 
master. It is precisely because they abuse 
money that it finally forces a choice?tyran-
nical thought it may appear to the poli-
ticians?between discipline and disaster. 
Therein lies the essential point about al-
tering the world monetary system. Intelli-
gent reforms might improve it; they cannot 
substitute for common monetary sense. 
The Viet Protesters 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. EDWARD J. DERWINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 1965 
Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Speaker, 
throughout the country the public has 
risen in indignation against the Com-
munist-infiltrated demonstrations last 
weekend in which our Vietnam policy 
was attacked. Chicago's American, in 
its edition of October 18 contained an 
impressive editorial on the demonstra-
tions of the past weekend: 
THE VIET PROTESTERS 
Some of the people demonstrating against 
the U.S. involvement in Vietnam may be 
sincere in their beliefs, but they certainly 
are misguided. Mothers of sons naturally 
don't want to see young men drafted into 
military service for action anywhere. Many 
of the young men object to giving service 
and risking their lives for a cause that seems 
distant and incomprehensible. A few of the 
demonstrators are natural born pacifists and 
dissenters. And some are Communist fellow 
travelers and sympathizers who always take 
a position for communism and against the 
best interests of the free world. 
These dissimilar persons are now banded 
together to cause as much mischief as they 
can for the American Vietnam policy. In so 
doing they are aiding the Communist cause, 
and helping to prolong the Vietnam war. 
The Vietcong launched a summer offensive 
against our military forces in Vietnam which 
has proved to be a failure. What the Com-
munists failed to win in Vietnam last sum-
mer, however, they may hope to gain by suc-
cesses on the domestic front within the 
United States. 
Former President Dwight Eisenhower most 
properly points out that the Vietnam demon-
strators don't know what they are talking 
about. Three U.S. President's, Mr. Eisen-
hower, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Johnson, have 
persisted in the prosecution of the war in 
Vietnam after a thorough examination and 
review of the facts. And what are the facts? 
The Government of South Vietnam has 
been menaced by a Communist invasion from 
the north. The Geneva International Con-
trol Commission has indicted North Vietnam 
for this invasion, and no objective person 
doubts that the legally constituted Govern-
ment of South Vietnam has indeed been 
menaced. The United States assured the 
South Vietnamese that they would have help 
from us. We are now providing that aid. 
Is it in our own self-interest to do so now? 
It is certainly in our own self-interest to stop 
the advancement of militant communism. 
China and North Vietnam are now the lead-
ing exponents of militant communism. 
China has repeatedly called on the rest of the 
Communist world to destroy American "im-
perialistic capitalism" by force and violence 
wherever it appears. North Vietnam and the 
Vietcong are engaged in the attempted de-
struction of a capitalist outpost by bringing 
down the Government of the Vietnam 
Republic. 
Unless we stop this assault, the whole of 
southeast Asia and ultimately the Pacific will 
go Communist. If we do not fight now on 
the Vietnam front, we ultimately will be 
fighting on a hundred fronts much closer 
to home. 
A5975 
Our purpose in South Vietnam is to defend 
a free and independent people, as we have 
promised to do, and to prove to the Commu-
ists that violent aggression does not pay. 
No one likes the cost of this policy, any 
more than we wanted to get involved in 
World War II. But we are involved, and we 
had better stay involved until there is a just 
settlement in Vietnam. Otherwise, we ulti-
mately will be even more deeply involved in 
a worldwide catastrophe that will be called 
world war III, if anyone remains to give it 
a name. 
The demonstrators and protesters against 
Vietnam policy are doing a great disservice to 
all of us. They are helping to prolong the 
war. If they succeed in getting their way, 
they'll help to bring on conflict everywhere 
with a resurgent communism which will 
prove once again that violence does pay. 
This is a course that those of us who love 
this Natton, and who prize a free world, can-
not accept. 
Trade Expansion Act?A Threat 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. ROBERT T. SECREST 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 1965 
Mr. SECREST. Mr. Speaker, earlier 
in this session I reintroduced a bill to 
amend the Trade Expansion Act, identi-
cal to a bill that I had introduced last 
year. It was designed to remove certain 
items from the President's list marked 
for a 50 percent tariff reduction. I am 
now introducing a bill that has also been 
introduced by some 15 to 26 other Mem-
bers which repeats the earlier bill but 
goes further in amending the act of 1962 
by modifying some of its extreme provi-
sions and authorizing the imposition of 
import quotas under certain conditions. 
The Trade Expansion Act has been a 
deep disappointment in what was to be 
one of its principal features, namely "ad-
justment assistance." This provision has 
become a dead letter. The Tariff Com-
mission is now without a single case on 
its docket after nearly 3 years from the 
time the act was passed. This is not sur-
prising because no case out of the 17 that 
have come before the Commission has 
succeeded in gaining any assistance. 
The turn-down has been unanimous in 
all cases but one, and that one was nega-
tive by a majority vote of the Commis-
sion. This record would hardly be con-
ducive to further efforts to gain relief. 
I can only conclude that the law was 
too strictly drawn. The bill I am intro-
ducing now would relax the severe re-
quirements of the law so that its avowed 
intent could be, carried out. This would 
be accomplished by striking the "major" 
where it is used to describe the degree of 
cause necessary to prove serious injury 
suffered by petitioning industries, firms 
or labor groups. The law says that a 
tariff reduction must have been the ma-
jor cause of an increase in imports and 
the higher volume of imports must have 
been the major cause of the injury suf-
fered by the industry or labor group seek-

ing relief. This is a double condition and 
represents an excessive burden of proof. 
Today there may be a number of causes 
of disturbance or disruption of normal 
operations of a manufacturing enterprise. 
To be asked to identify one cause and 
then to establish it as a major cause not 
only once but twice, the second one de-
pendent on the first, is to demand what 
no applicant to the Commission has been 
able to satisfy. The requirement must 
be relaxed if adjustment assistance is 
to come to life. 
Mr. Speaker, I do not understand the 
reasoning of those who believe in the 
high labor standards of this country and 
yet lend support to a trade policy that 
undermines those standards. We call 
for full employment in this country and 
seek a good level of prosperity for busi-
ness but then turn about and vote for a 
trade program that works in the oppo-
site direction. While I say "we" do this, 
I am not among those who voted in this. 
fashion. I mean the 1962 congressional 
majority. 
I do not understand how we can ex-
pect to maintain our labor standards and 
achieve full employment by calling for a 
sharp reduction in the tariff. No one 
can question the wide margin by which 
wages in this country exceed those in all 
other countries except Canada. The day 
Is past when this discrepancy could be 
dismissed by simply saying that our in-
dustry is much more productive than the 
foreign. Other industrial countries have 
escalated their technological develop-
ment more rapidly than this country if 
for no other reason than their lower level 
as a starting point after the war. We 
assisted them immeasurably in this 
escalation. I think it is safe to say that 
we presented the countries of Europe 
and Japan with a technological leap that 
saved them two or three decades of re-
search and development. 
This leap increased the competitive 
advantage they already enjoyed in many 
lines of good as a result of their lower 
wages; for while their wages have risen 
considerably, wages in this country have 
also gone up. If their wages have come 
up faster percentagewise than ours the 
increases here have exceeded theirs in 
actual dollars and cents. 
Yet there are those who generally sup-
port the principle of high wages and full 
employment who seem to believe that 
growing import competition is economi-
cally not only harmless but beneficial. 
Granted that fair competition is a 
healthy economic factor and that some 
Imports do no harm because they are 
not competitive or do not represent un-
fair competition; it is nonetheless true 
that import competition that owes its 
advantage to lower wages may retard 
employment in this country by discour-
aging industrial expansion while increas-
ing pressure for more mechanization and 
automation. 
I am not one who opposes mechani-
zation or automation as such. The bene-
fits of technological progress are too 
evident to take such a position. How-
ever, we must ask what is the purpose 
of our feverish modernization. Ideally, 
the purpose should be to lower the cost 
of production so that goods may be sold 
to the consuming public at lower prices. 
Our very system of mass production in-
deed got its inception from such efforts. 
When the link between mass production 
and mass consumption came to be ap-
preciated we began also to appreciate 
the function of fair competition, which 
was to reduce prices and thus allow more 
production in relation to consumer in-
come. More production soon meant 
more employment. The workers who 
were displaced initially by radical mech-
anization were in time rehired or re-
placed in greater numbers throughout 
the economy as a result of greater pro-
duction and greater activity in the sup-
porting activities, such as selling, distri-
bution, insuring, financing, transporting, 
and so forth. 
These benefits, however, do not accrue 
under all circumstances. For one thing, 
If the product is one for which the de-
mand is inelastic, consumption will not 
be stimulated perceptibly. The price of 
salt, flour, or sugar, within reason, has 
little effect on consumption. The price 
of some other goods if dropped sharply 
may lead to a doubling or tripling of 
consumption, or, in time, even a yet 
higher multiple. Our industrial history 
as it moved into mass production, from 
automobiles to telephones, radio to tele-
vision, all sorts of household appliances 
to a great variety of gadgets?I say, the 
industrial history of this country during 
the past two generations has been a suc-
cession of invention and innovation, pro-
ducing new products under the impetus 
of efforts to bring the costs within the 
reach of the mass pocketbook. The re-
sult has been what we see before us. It 
brought us the industrial leadership of 
the world. 
Now, however, confront these same in-
dustries with the alternative of reducing 
costs sharply or seeing their domestic 
market supplied in rising degree by im-
ports and the situation is different. The 
advantage of imports may lie in the 
very objective that was looked to as 
opening up a broader market, that is, 
lower prices. The domestic industry 
then faces a double problem. First, it 
may for the time being have gone as far 
as it can in cost reduction. New de-
velopments that increase productivity do 
not spring up over night. The foreign 
producers may be technologically abreast 
of our industry and because of their 
much lower wages can undersell us. 
Second, even though the time is in-
opportune and the industry must reduce 
its cost nevertheless it will scour the 
capital market for means of increasing 
productivity regardless of the state of 
unreadiness. It can hope to hold its 
share of the market only by cutting 
costs; and the principal source of cost 
reduction lies in the decreasing the num-
ber of workers. Yet, in doing this, sales 
will not respond as in the days when the 
market was virgin and free of already 
low-cost imported goods. Now these 
skim the cream, and the displaced 
workers remain displaced. 
Two negative effects, rather than 
only one, are produced. The work 
force is reduced, and plans for ex-
pansion that seemed opportune before 
must now be put on ice. Therefore the 
impact on unemployment is double. Not 
only are workers displaced; new workers 
who would have been hired had the in-
dustry expanded are left unhired and 
are added instead to the unemployment 
rolls. Thus we add to the retraining and 
relocation burdens no less than the dis-
tress that marks the poverty-stricken 
areas. 
Mr. Speaker, it is a common human 
weakness to wish to eat our cake and 
yet also have it left over for future corn-
sumption. We all know that this does 
not work. Yet there are economists, doc-
trinal free traders and others who are 
strong suporters, as I have already said, 
of the high-wage high-income economy 
that characterizes our national state to-
day. They adhere at the same time to 
a contradictory position that demands 
an impossible competition with foreign 
systems that base their competitive posi-
tion on low wages. We cannot maintain 
our system and at the same time adhere 
to policies that render our position 
untenable. 
We can meet the challenge in one of 
two ways: we can reduce wages or do 
what I have already described, namely 
mechanize and automate as relentlessly 
as possible in order to bring down OUT 
costs. Either course would undermine 
the income base that is necessary to sus-
tain our high level of production. The 
day of reducing wages is gone, not only 
because of the strength of labor organiza-
tions but because it would diminish the 
market by reducing the number of dol-
lars in the hands of consumers. 
Let us examine briefly the extent of 
the dependence of our economy on per-
sonal income, or more truly, disposable, 
that is, spendable personal income, on 
the one hand, and the preponderate de-
pendence of personal income on em-
ployee compensation. 
In 1964 disposable personal income in 
this country was $431 billion. In the 
second quarter of this year it had risen 
to an annual level of $455 billion. This 
compares with $384 billion in 1962: 
Wage and salary disbursements in 1964 
were $331 billion, rising to an -annual 
rate of $352 billion in the second quarter 
of 1965. In 1962 they were $29'7 billion. 
These figures are in current dollars and 
therefore exaggerate the real income and 
real wages by the amount of price in-
creases since 1962. 
It will be seen that wage and salary 
disbursements represent a very high 
proportion of all disposable personal in-
come which includes proprietors' in-
come, rental income and dividends?see 
Survey of Current Business, U.S. Depart-
ment of Commerce, July 1965, table 3, 
page 4?the proportion during the years 
I have cited was 77 percent. 
The percentage runs even higher when 
the comparison is made with personal 
consumption expenditures. In 1964, for 
example, wage and salary disbursements 
of $331 billion represented 82 percent of 
personal consumption expenditures of 
$399 billion. 
It is obvious that our high wages rep-
resent the principal underpinning of 
total consumer purchasing power while 
the latter is what sustains our high 
volume of production from farms and 
mines to ,rnills and factories.

October 22, 1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? APPENDIX 
Actually, there are about 34.1 million poor 
people in the United States. This is about 
one-fifth of our population. New Hamp-
shire has its share of poor people. Accord-
ing to Prof. James R. Bowring, of the Uni-
versity of New Hampshire, there are some 
28,383 families, or' about 85,000 people in our 
State who are poor. This means that about 
15.2 percent of our people in this State are 
poor, which is 6 percent less than in the 
country as a whole. In Manchester, there 
are 3,142 poor people. Now, these figures are 
based on a level of family income which is 
less than $3,000 a year. The average family 
has about 4 people in it; ask yourself, could 
my family live adequately on less than $3,000 
a year? The Federal Government estimates 
that a family of four ought to have an in-
come of $6,317 in order to live adequately 
but modestly. Think of it: one-fifth of 
American families try to live on less than 
$3,000 a year. This one-fifth gets only 4.7 
percent of the country's personal wealth, 
while the upper one-fifth with the largest 
incomes gets 45.5 of the Nation's income. 
This one-fifth of the Nation which is poor 
by this standard really suffer a great deal. 
Some 2,000 of them die of malnutrition each 
year. They die sooner than the rest of us 
because their whole lives are spent from one 
Illness to another. Because of this, the 
death rate in America is higher than in 
Holland, Sweden, Israel, and Great Britain. 
They suffer three-times the mental illness 
rate as the rest of us experience. They live 
in substandard, decaying houses, shacks and 
slums. In the U.S. as a whole, there are 58 
million such houses, and in New Hampshire, 
there are 38,489 substandard houses in which 
the poor are forced to live. And I have been 
In some of them. Our New Hampshire poor 
suffer more, perhaps, than poor in other 
parts of the country because the average 
wage scale for manufacturing is only $2 an 
hour, while in United States as a whole, the 
rate is $2.53 an hour. Our wage scale is 
lower than any other State in New England. 
To try to compensate for this low wage scale, 
there is a larger percentage of families in our 
State where the wife works and an older 
child works than in any other State in the 
country. This means neglected children, at 
least. 
The poor in the United States, as well as 
in New Hampshire, include 15 million chil-
dren. Forty percent of the poor are non-
white, usually Negro, who are usually the 
last to be hired and the first to be fired. 
Forty percent of the poor are farmers trying 
to eke out a living on substandard farms. 
Fifty percent of poor families are headed by 
a divorced, widowed, or abandoned woman. 
The poor generally lack a good education. 
Two-thirds of the poor families are headed 
by people with no more than a grade school 
education. Lack of good education is obvi-
ously one of the causes of poverty. Inci-
dentally, in Manchester the median school 
grade that has been achieved is only 9.3, 
which helps to explain, surely, some of the 
poverty in our own city. 
This, then, is something of a description 
of the one-fifth of our Nation which com-
prise the poor. They are a challenge to this 
great country of ours. What should be our 
attitude toward these poor? Well, there are 
always some who have said down through 
the centuries that we will always have the 
poor with us and that there is nothing really 
that needs to be done or even can be done. 
They often quote, out of centext, a saying 
of Jesus, "* * * you always have the poor 
with you." This has undoubtedly been the 
case, but I am sure Jesus did not consider 
this as ideal or something that we ought to 
consider as final. You know, men used to 
say that people would never fly, but we do 
indeed fly. 
Another attitude which many people have 
is that poverty is one's own fault. They 
say, one is poor because one is lazy, or crimi-
nal; poverty then becomes a kind of divine 
punishment upon character defects. People 
who say this are usually those who them-
selves have worked hard and have, through 
their own efforts, achieved some kind of 
financial security. Now, there is undoubt-
edly some truth in this. Undoubtedly, some 
poor people could rise above poverty by hard 
effort and industry. However, the bootstrap 
theory does not take into account the Negro 
who just can't find a job because of the 
prejudice of his white brother. After all, 
the Negro can't help the color of his own 
skin. This theory does not take into ac-
count the mother of three children whose 
husband deserted her; it does not take into 
account the children of the poor who are 
too young to work; it does not take into 
account the victims of automation or cyber-
nation, which is eliminating some 40,000 
jobs a week. Poor, slum schools, often with 
at least de facto segregation, which fail even 
to teach some children even how to read, 
cannot be blamed on the children who at-
tend them. This bootstrap theory does not 
take into effect the debilitating effect of 
poverty and ghettos on people, the despair 
and numbness and hopelessness which it 
spawns in people, so that they lose their 
nerve and sink back into more and more 
poverty. No, this bootstrap theory which 
may be true in a few cases, is not a worthy 
attitude of the modern American when con-
fronted with the facts of poverty in our 
midst. 
This attitude is especially unworthy of the 
Christian. And so, may I suggest what ought 
to be our attitude toward poverty, an atti-
tude which is American and Christian. We 
ought to develop an attitude of genuine 
sympathy and concern toward the poor. We 
should look upon them as our brothers and 
sisters, children of the one God, along with 
us. And we should be challenged to try to 
help them in every possible way. This is 
made very clear in our Scripture passage: 
"For this is the message * * that we 
should love one another. * * * If anyone 
'has the world's goods and sees his brother 
In need, yet closes his heart against him, 
how does God's love abide in him? Little 
children, let us not love in word and in 
speech but in deed and in truth." 
This loving in word, directed to the poor 
in our midst, will take, of course, many 
forms. One, there will always be a need for 
acts of personal charity, on a person-to-
person basis. More often than not, however, 
this personal charity will be through private 
Institutions, such as those represented in the 
community chest, and through all kinds of 
church institutions such as Church World 
Service. But such help is really inadequate 
to meet people's real needs in depth. This is 
where the government comes in, local, State, 
and Federal. Government represents you 
and me, and the taxes we pay for govern-
ment help is really Christian charity work-
ing through government. We need, certainly, 
the kind of welfare which is available, and 
It ought to be made more adequate. We 
need social security and aid to dependent 
children. And we need the kind of massive 
Governmnet programs which have recently 
been provided by the Congress, especially 
those programs which aim at job retraining, 
and helping deprived children get a Head 
Start, and giving youth Job Corps training, 
etc. All this is needed, and much more. 
We have just begun to fight against poverty. 
Michael Harrington, in "The Other America," 
has written, "I wanfto tell every well-fed and 
optimistic American that it is intolerable 
that so many millions should be maimed in 
body and in spirit."

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
Os, 
HON. JOHN R. HANSEN 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 1965 
Mr. HANSEN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, 
last May in a speech before the Political 
Action Institute in Des Moines, Iowa, I 
urged a course in Vietnam that paralleled 
the one taken by the Johnson adminis-
tration. It seemed to me then and it 
still seems to me that the United States 
could not ethically shrug off the mantel 
of world leadership that has been thrust 
upon us by the free world. 
The wisdom of that administration 
policy has been pointed out in a recent 
column by Joseph Alsop in the Washing-
ton Post. I feel this article makes quite 
clear the need for and purpose of our 
action in Vietnam. I hope this will add 
to the understanding of those who were 
not afforded the opportunity of reading 
this column. 
Mr. Alsop's column and my speech 
follow: 
SMARTY'S PARTY 
(By Joseph Alsop) 
Toxyo.?Both in Hong Kong, and here in 
Tokyo, the China-watehers are currently 
playing a game that is both amusing and in-
structive. It starts with the fact that the 
Chinese Communists' great annual celebra-
tion of their revolutionary anniversary on 
October 1 was painfully like Smarty's party, 
to which nobody came. 
Maybe that is going too far, for Prince 
Sihanouk of Cambodia was certainly on 
hand, there was also a commercial delegation 
from Pakistan, and there was a very minor 
member of the preupheaval Indonesian 
Cabinet. 
But there were no Japanese or Filipinos 
or Burmans or Singaporeans. Africa, where 
Mao Tse-tung and his colleagues have lately 
been spending millions that China can ill 
afford, was strikingly poorly represented. 
The absence of the North Koreans?once the 
closest of Peiping's allies?and even the 
North Vietnamese?so widely supposed to be 
entirely under Peiping's thumb?was rather 
glaringly conspicuous. 
In short, this was a party like one of the 
more ghastly diplomatic receptions in Wash-
ington, which are unattended by anyone ex-
cept poor duty-State Department officials 
and old ladies who go to eat free canapes. 
The game of the China-watchers consists of 
making up the very different kind of guest 
list the Chinese Communists would surely 
have been able to announce, if only the 
Americans had duly proved to be "paper 
tigers" in Vietnam this winter and spring, 
just as Mao Tse-tung always said we would. 
A minimum hypothetical guest list in-
cludes heads of state or foreign ministers 
from the two other Asian Communist coun-
tries and perhaps some Eastern European 
Communist states as well; plus heads or 
foreign ministers from all the unalined 
Asian counties except India and a good many 
in Africa too; plus discreetly inconspicuous 
yet highly significant delegations from Japan, 
the Philippines, and maybe one or two more 
westward-leaning states in Asia. 
The China-watchers' game is no light joke. 
It is expertly played by men with long and 
intimate Asian experience. Hence it should

be of interest to those lacking serious Asian 
experience, who are so constantly warning 
that the United States is "losing friends in 
Asia" by refusing to be a paper tiger in 
Vietnam. 
The upheaval in Indonesia should also be 
vividly interesting to these same people. 
From the vantage point of Tokyo (and very 
likely in Djakarta itself) the final outcome 
cannot yet be predicted with confidence. 
But it is already quite clear that the Com-
munist coup was attempted hastily and 
brutally, in the way people act when they 
are apprehensive and off balance. 
It is equally clear that there would have 
been very little resistance, even to such an 
outrageous assault on Indonesia's independ-
ence, if the Indonesian nationalists had be-
come convinced that communism was the 
wave of the future. A Communist timetable 
in Vietnam would have implanted just that 
without conviction. If Indonesia remains a 
truly independent state, in fact, Mao's error 
about Americans being paper tigers will have 
much to do with it. 
:Finally, there is the not unimportant 
matter of the vital American bases here in 
Japan and on Okinawa. Those who want 
the United States to justify Mao's thesis 
have told us we can take a catastrophic de-
feat in Vietnam, and still stay in business 
as a Pacific power with the aid of our ocean-
wide net of naval and other bases. That 
view evokes tired grins from the extremely 
competent official Americans who have to 
'concern themselves with the Japanese base-
problem on the spot. 
The United States bases in Japan are a very 
real problem?no doubt about it. A rising 
tide of nationalism, deriving from a justified 
sense of national accomplishment, is making 
more and more Japanese impatient of the 
present arrangements. Above all, the quasi-
colonial status of Okinawa, where the Japa-
nese Government's writ does not run, is 
daily becoming harder and harder to defend. 
Sensible adjustments are going to have to be, 
and ought to be, made in the base-
agreements. 
But in the present circumstances, there is 
time and room for maneuver to make these 
adjustments, about which our very able Am-
bassador, Edwin 0. Reischauer, is already 
conducting a dialog with Washington. And 
in the very different circumstances that 
would have been created by U.S. acceptance 
of the paper tiger role in Vietnam, there 
would have been neither time nor room for 
maneuver. 
After such a demonstration of American 
unreliability, the Japanese would surely 
have been driven to see to their own defense, 
without further reliance on 'U.S. strength. 
The American base agreements, instead of 
being sensibly adjusted, would soon have 
been torn up and thrown in our faces. De-
feat in Vietnam would in fact have cost us 
the bases. Such, at any rate, is the unani-
mous judgment of those closest to the prob-
lem, who are by no means illiberal or hard-
nosed men. Maybe that phrase, "losing 
friends in Asia," requires a little further 
definition. 
--
ADDRESS BY CONGRESSMAN HANSEN OF IOWA 
The problem in Vietnam is a complex one 
as we all have repeatedly been told. Viet-
nam is somewhat like marriage. It was easy 
to get into, and it is hard to get out of. We 
have so many emotional arguments going 
both for a stronger position in Vietnam and 
for an immediate withdrawal that it is some-
times difficult to take a long, hard, look at the 
situation there. Let us try to do this. 
First of all, It should be clearly under-
stood that part of the problem in the United 
States in accepting this position has to do 
with our changing role of leadership over the 
past 40 years. Our acceptance of responsi-
bility in world politics has grown to the 
place where we now have almost completely 
replaced Great Britain as the leader of the 
free world. We are called upon to do what 
the British did prior to 1900. She was some-
what the World police force. Scandinavian 
seamen could rove the fishing waters in the 
North Atlantic because they knew the Brit-
ish Navy would protect them if any difficulty 
arose. We, in the 'United States, now fulfill 
this same role for many small nations. This 
may not be as we would prefer, but at the 
moment, we have no real alternative but to 
accept our obligation as a Nation to main-
tain peace and order and to develop a politi-
cal and economic climate where people can 
work and live as they wish under a Demo-
cratic system. 
One criticism has been that the Vietna-
mese themselves cannot and do not fight. 
This is simply not true. This is a tough 
war, and the Vietnamese are a tough people 
to have stood up under it and to be holding 
their heads above water after 20 years of vio-
lence and uncertainty. 
To see the situation in true perspective, 
take, for example, one fact alone?that in 
the first 8 months of 1964 the Vietcong as-
sassinated more than 400 local officials and 
kidnaped another '700. Now try to project 
what an equivalent amount of gangsterism 
would do to government performance in this 
country. Then attempt to project that ef-
fect, in turn, into the situation in a country 
such as South Vietnam which is just learn-
ing the art of self-government. 
This procedure has been a continuation of, 
the policy of the Communists, to weaken the 
country by reducing the number of trained 
administrators. 
The Vietnamese military forces continue 
to fight well. Our own military men con-
sider most of them as tough and brave as 
any in the world. Though there have been 
military reverses, there have also been vic-
tories?which sometimes do not make head-
lines. 
Living conditions in the south are superior 
to those in the north. There has been a 
continued flow, or flight, of people from 
North Vietnam Since the Communist take-
over?to the south. There is no like move-
ment to the north. 
This shows that the Vietnamese people are 
not voting with their feet or their hearts for 
communism. 
The campaign that is going on is some-
times referred to as a civil war. But this 
is a misnomer. If this were a true civil war, 
let me ask why then have not the majority 
of the Buddhist and Catholic leaders and 
their people joined this Communist cause? 
Discontent, there may have been?and local 
recruiting by the Vietcong, largely through 
intimidation, has taken place. This whole 
campaign, however, would never have been 
possible without the direction, personnel, 
key material, and total support coming from 
the north. Nor would it have been possible 
either, without the strong moral support 
and key material, when needed, provided 
by Peiping and, up to 1962 at least, by the 
Soviet Union. Thousands of highly trained 
men coming from the north, along with the 
crucial items of equipment and munitions, 
have been from the start the mainspring of 
the Vietcong insurgency. This has been all 
along a Communist subversive aggression, 
in total violation of the Geneva accords as 
Well as general principles of international 
behavior. 
Indeed the true nature of the struggle has 
been publicly stated many times by Hanoi 
itself, beginning with a 1960 Communist 
Party conference in North Vietnam which 
declared the policy of?as they put it?"lib-
erating" the south. In February, President 
Johnson gave the anti-Communist war in 
Vietnam a new dimension. The significance 
of his action is both military and political. 
By ordering American warplanes to attack 
targets in North Vietnam, Mr. Johnson de-
stroyed any illusion that the Hanoi regime 
enjoyed a "privileged sanctuary" from which 
to continue to supply leadership and ma-
terial for the Vietcong attacking American 
and South Vietnemese forces below the 17th 
parallel. 
When he acquiesced in the decision to let 
South Vietnam's own air force join in the 
retaliatory strikes, he gave a much needed 
boost in morale to the military forces of that 
country, which were so long at the mercy of 
hit-and-run guerrilla tactics difficult to 
counter. 
The immediate effect in the United States 
of the President's decision to retaliate 
against North Vietnam for the actions of its 
agents in South Vietnam was to lessen criti-
cism from both ends of the spectrum. 
Those who had been demanding more de-
cisive action were pleased, although the 
limited retaliatory responses did not satisfy 
those who would like an all-out assault on 
Hanoi and even Red China. But it appre-
ciably diminished the clamor of those critics 
who had felt the United States was turning 
the other cheek too often. 
At the other extreme, Mr. Johnson's de-
cision to demonstrate that the United States 
is not a "paper tiger" halted mounting 
speculation both in this country and abroad 
that Washington was inclined toward some 
sort of international negotiation which 
would lead to "neutralization of South Viet-
nam." This speculative trend had to be 
stopped before it sapped the will of the 
Americans and their South Vietnamese al-
lies to continue the struggle. 
Having had one unfortunate experience in 
negotiating a "neutralization" deal?the 
1962 agreement of Laos?the United States 
wanted nothing like that at this point in the 
southeast Asian conflict. 
It might be well at this point to recall 
what happened after the 1954 agreement 
when the south fulfilled its commitment to 
disarm?a circumstance which did not take 
place in the north. Recently McGeorge 
Bundy said that all wars eventually end by 
negotiation. 
But wiser men than Bundy learned and 
said long ago that a nation never wins at 
the conference table anything that it was 
not prepared to win by force of arms on the 
battlefield if it had to. We suspect that 
President Johnson knows this. 
When we analyze the Vietnamese situation 
as it prevails, we must not fail to take into 
account the Communist activities in Thai-
land which completely belie the assertion 
that they are only interested in liberation 
of peace-loving people from oppressors and 
are fostering a program of nationalism 
among the emerging nations. If there is 
any nation that has become a national state 
and whose people are peace loving and which 
has been living in peace with its neighbors, 
It is that of the Thai. Yet this country 
must operate almost in a state of war to 
prevent and halt Communist efforts to in-
sidiously subject their land. 
Thus we see that based on their own 
rationalization, the Communists have abso-
lutely no business in Thailand. 
As to the basic alternatives, so long as 
South Vietnam is ready to carry on the fight, 
withdrawal is unthinkable. A negotiation 
that produced a return to the essentials of 
the 1954 accord and thus an independent 
and secure South Vietnam would of course 
be an answer, indeed the answer. But nego-
tiation would hardly be promising that ad-
mitted communism to South Vietnam?that 
did not control the Hanoi regime?that ex-
posed South Vietnam, and perhaps other 
countries in the area, to renewed Communist 
aggression at will, with only nebulous or re-
mote guarantees?this sort of negotiation is 
likewise unthinkable. 
As for enlarging our own actions, we can-
not speak surely about the future, for the 
aggressors themselves share the responsibili-

. for such eventualities. We have shown, 
our reaction to North Vietnam's attacks 
against us in the Gulf of Tonkin and else-
where, that We can act, and North Vietnam 
knows this and must know its own weak-
nesses. 
The root of the problem is in South Viet-
nam. We must persist in our efforts there, 
with patience rather than petulance, cool-
ness rather than recklessness, and with a 
continuing ability to separate the real from 
the merely wished-for. 
As a great power, we are now and will con-
tinue to find ourselves in situations where 
we simply do not have easy choices, where 
there simply are not immediate or ideal 
solutions, available. We cannot then allow 
ourselves to yield to frustration, but must 
stick to the job, doing all we can and doing 
it better. 
The national Interests that have brought 
us into the Vietnam struggle are valid, and 
they do not become less so just because the 
going gets rot.gh, and the end is not yet in 
sight. President Johnson said in his state 
of the Union message, "Our goal is peace in 
southeast Asia. That will come only when 
aggressors leave their neighbors in peace. 
What is at stake is the cause of freedom, and 
in that cause, America will never be found 
wanting."

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
or 
HON. HUGH SCOTT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 
Thursday, October 21, 1965 
Mr. scow. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that there be print-
ed in the Appendix of the RECORD an edi-
torial in the Washington Star, of Tues-
day, October 19, 1965, entitled "The 
Book," which is recognition of National 
Bible Week, the third week of October. 
This is one of the most beautifully writ-
ten summaries of what the Bible means 
to all of us that it has been my pleasure 
and privilege to read. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
THE Boox 
It isn't a book at all, really; it's a col-
lection of books and it tells a rambling, dis-
jointed story that begins with Middle East-
ern musings on how the world was made 
and ends in late Greek poetry on how it shall 
be saved. 
From the creation and the fall, we whirl 
through the early generations of man, the 
famous "begats," to the catastrophes of Lot 
and Noah and God's bow set in the clouds as 
a sign of peace. Then Abraham comes out 
of Ur and all before seems prelude. Pacts 
with God are made and renewed. Problems 
of marriage and inheritance are solved in 
strange ways. The patriarchs consistently 
show a wry humor in their dealings with 
God and with them. He often speaks in 
sublime irony, both sides thus completely 
different from the slave-master reiigious re-
lationship common to the time. 
Jacob becomes Israel, the people of God, 
and his son, Joseph, rules in Egypt, a light 
to the gentiles. Abruptly, darkness falls on 
Egypt and out of it rises a new leader, Moses, 
who fashions a new people of God out of 
slaves and leads them fitfully and rebel-
liously toward the Promised Land. Battles 
follow and civil wars and the rearing of a 
throne in Israel, whereon finally sits David 
the King, shepherd, hero, warrior and cor-
rupt, ruler, yet a poet of piercing sweet 
power, whose songs still solace and lift up 
the heart of man. 
The corruption of power, which began with 
Saul, continues through the kings, splits the 
kingdom, leads the people into captivity be-
side the waters of Babylon. 
Now the jumbled, crowded story begins to 
shift as if to another key, that of prophecy. 
From this point on, in good times or bad, and 
there are more bad than good, the spirit of 
the people of God is found no more in kings 
but in the lonely, insistent outraged, mourn-
ing voices of God's prophets. The voice is 
one of increasing ethical precision in a call to 
the people to return to God's ways. 
Throughout all this long tale there have 
been interludes of great human pathos and 
love: Ruth amid the alien corn, Susannah 
and the elders, the trials of Job, the song 
which is Solomon's. 
For the Christian reader, the New Testa-
ment is another change in key, the grand 
climax of the elaborate story, in which all 
the major themes of the past?the fashion-
ing and preservation of the people of God, 
the building of His city, the understanding 
of His law, the human notes of pathos and 
tragedy?all these are brought to resolution 
in the birth, teachings, death, and resurrec-
tion of Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah. 
At the end, the thousands of people and 
events reveal their substantial unity and a 
dynamic, directed movement through time 
toward God and eternity. 
Jews or Christians, or vaguely agnostic sur-
vivors of those faiths, we are indeed people 
of the Book. It has formed us, our minds, 
our ways, our laws, and institutions. This 
third week of October is National Bible Week. 
There can be no observance more fitting and 
more rewarding than to open and read the 
Holy Book.

and Currency to expose and combat the ex-
ploitation of U.S. military personnel by un-
scrupulous loan companies have been com-
mended by National Commander Milton A. 
Waldor of the Jewish War Veterans of the 
United States of America. 
Mr. Waldor, of Newark, N.J., called the at-
tention of Chairman PATMAN, Democrat, of 
Texas, to a resolution on the subject adopted 
by JWV at its recent national convention. 
Mr. Waldor said that Representative PAT-
MAN'S investigation and hearings comple-
mented the objectives sought by his organi-
zation. 
The JWV resolution noted that American 
soldiers and sailors pay an estimated $50 mil-
lion a year in exorbitant interest and excess 
charges on consumer credit. Aiming at mili-
tary patronage, loan companies have hired 
former high-ranking military officers to serve 
as officers of the firms, giving enlisted men a 
false sense of confidence. 
In the opinion of JWV the exploitation of 
servicemen "is bound to effect their per-
formance in the line of duty." 
National Commander Waldor hailed new 
Department of Defense directives aimed at 
achieving more ethical practices by busi-
nesses catering to military personnel. "This 
response to the disclosures made by Chair-
man PATMAN'S committee is in consonance 
with JWV recommendations as enacted by 
resolution of our national convention." 
During last month's national convention 
the JWV went on record in support of De-
partment of Defense cooperation with the 
Domestic Finance Subcommittee of the 
House Committee on Banking and Currency 
in exposing the sharp practices of a number 
of loan companies specializing in loans to 
armed services personnel. At that time the 
JWV convention urged that such companies 
be placed "off limits." 
The Jewish War Veterans of the United 
States of America is the oldest active war 
veterans organization in the country. 
The Artist and His Studies 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JACOB K. JAVITS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 
Thursday, October 21, 1965 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, the dean 
of the College of Fine Arts at Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, Dr. Norman 0. 
Rice, has recently written an illuminat-
ing article, "The Artist and His Studies," 
which appeared in the September 15 is-
sue of the Carnegie Tech Tartan. This 
article is especially pertinent in the 
light of the recent enactment into law 
of the National Foundation for the Arts 
and Humanities Act of 1965. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
article may be printed in the Appendix 
of the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
THE ARTIST AND HIS STUDIES 
(By Dr. Norman 0. Rice, dean of the College 
of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology, Pittsburgh, Pa) 
A "fine arts student" is scarcely a type 
that can be pinned down by generalities. 4

A5962 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? APPENDIX October 22, 1, 
The arts themselves differ from each other 
and attract different kinds of people. In the 
end we have everything from pragmatists to 
poets, with a range of characteristics in be-
tween that would astonish most people. 
Some of the arts require tremendous physi-
cal control, others do not. Sometimes the 
control is one of narrow tolerances, as in 
the fingering of a violin or the delineation 
of an exact shape; sometimes it is perhaps no 
less precise but involves the whole body, as 
in tumbling around the stage. The mental 
controls have to be there, too. These are 
built up very systematically in all of the 
arts, starting with quite simple ideas and de-
veloping elaboration to the point at which 
reaction becomes instinctive. If one has to 
think about the mechanics of drawing he 
does not draw, if one is preoccupied with the 
techniques of acting he doesn't act. Stu-
dents are bound to have deep concern for the 
craft they are learning, but in my judgment 
the craft is perhaps the least part of their 
problem. Craft must he mastered and ex-
cessible,.but the arts begin by assuming an 
adequate base in craftsmanship, adequate, 
that is, for whatever expression has to be 
made. If the expressive urge is there, the 
means for turning it into art will generally be 
found. 
MORE THAN CRAFT LEARNING 
The problem of the school then is not to 
bear down on craft training exclusively for 
4 college years. The kind of digital dex-
terity that musicians and draftsmen need 
goes on and on and must be encouraged and 
practiced and developed to whatever strength 
the artist needs. The same can be said of 
voice controls as they are practiced by sing-
ers and actors. The projection of a tone is 
important just as the projection of a word 
may be. If education in the arts ended at 
teaching these things, our task ivould be 
much less complex and much duller. As it 
is, we begin in each of our programs with 
the business of mastering adequate tech-
niques. The departments approach this 
problem differently?each in its own way. 
In general, then, all fine arts programs build 
on the assumption of adequate techniques 
with ultimate emphasis on the adequate ex-
pression of ideas, stress on expressive capa-
bility increasing as a student matures. 
EDUCATION IN THE SCIENCES 
The educational process in the arts is one 
of indirection, suggestion, intimation, stimu-
lation, speculation, demonstration, critical 
evaluation and then usually recapitulation 
and a new beginning. In my observation, 
everything that an artist knows he can even-
tually use. But learning in the arts is con-
siderably more than assembling facts. Of 
course, artists need to know something about 
history and about the great ideas of man-
kind. Of course, artists should understand 
the sciences and the political systems of the 
world, and, of course, an artist should know 
all of the best literature in his own field and 
the best that has been written and said in 
all related fields. The humanities are ex-
tremely important to us if they are humanely 
taught, just as the sciences are important to 
us if they are taught with some recognition 
of the artist's particular kind of sensitivity 
and response. The world has placed, in re-
cent years, a high premium on the capacity 
to deal knowledgeably with verbal and 
mathematical symbols and it has tended to 
ignore the fact that ideas can be communi-
cated with great force and clarity through 
other kinds of symbols?through structure, 
through gesture, through the ordering of 
sights and sounds among which creative peo-
ple of some varities feel most at home. 
CIRCUMVENTING OBSOLESCENCE 
There is nothing magical about 4 years as 
an educational term for anyone and I sup-
pose 4 years is never enough time to give an 
artist to learn his trade. We talk a good 
deal on this campus about preparing stu-
dents to circumvent the pull toward obso-
lescence. We do not have, in fine arts, quite 
the same problems that are found elsewhere, 
but I think we can say that the College of 
Fine Arts tries to do precisely this for the 
people it touches. The obsolescence we face, 
as I have indicated, is of a different kind. A 
good new idea in architecture does not make 
obsolete a good old idea. It is pointless, 
however, to go on simply reproducing old 
ideas or forms or encouraging their repro-
duction in a school. 
Artists, that is to say creative and imagi-
native people, must learn how to make out 
of all the impingements in their lives a syn-
thesis resulting in an overt statement, one 
of fresh interpretation or of new import. 
"Heard melodies are sweet but those un-
heard are sweeter" is hardly the analysis 
of a musician; it is a poetic verbal image 
based on still another visual image. A 
musician needs to hear the melody to judge 
its "sweetness" and unless he can create it 
according to his standards he has no func-
tion. We can proceed through all the arts 
and find parallels. A design which is de-
scribed in words does not exist for the 
architect, the potter, the painter, the play-
wright, the printer?they can imagine all 
they choose but ultimately they have to 
produce. It is only by making external 
whatever ideas have been generated that the 
artist's ideas can be judged. 
FINE, ARTS CURRICULUM 
With all of the preamble, what can I say 
about the curriculum in the college? I can 
describe it in fairly succinct terms. Archi-
tecture has 5 years and the other depart-
ments have 4 years; into these time limits 
(which as I have suggested are purely arbi-
trary and which may not be at all realistic 
for their purpose) we have developed pro-
grams which vary from department to de-
partment and even between options in the 
same department. About 25 percent of the 
total credit required in the college is in the 
general area of the humanities. 
Some years ago the faculties of this college, 
working with humanities and social sciences, 
developed two basic courses. The first year 
we provide a combination writing and read-
ing course, which we call thought and ex-
pression; in the second year we require a sur-
vey of man's cultural history (that is to say 
history with emphasis on man's cultural 
achievement rather than on his military, 
political or economic mutations). This 
course is called History of Arts and Civiliza-
tion. It is passible for scholars to be scorn-
ful of both of these courses because they at-
tempt far too much in the time we give 
them. They are intensive, they require a 
great deal of reading and writing and they 
are taught with varying levels of success by 
various members of the faculty who have at-
tempted them over the years. In spite of 
their limitations, they do stimulate a desire 
in many students to read more widely and 
they provide a base for intelligent reading. 
In the 10 years I have been on the campus 
there have been many changes in both of 
these courses. The English and history de-
partments have worked hard and helpfully 
with our own faculties in the hope of max-
imizing their interest and effectiveness. Al-, 
though these courses are taken by all fine 
arts students, I am not sure that they are 
necessarily ideal for all students in the col-
lege. For various reasons It is simpler to 
mandate these two courses than to give be-
ginning students a wide option, as many 
more complex and diversified universities 
have done. In general, I believe ours are 
good courses for our people; if I did not 
think they were good college level courses 
for anyone, I would not judge them to be 
good enough for the College of Fine Arts. 
It follows that we would be inconsistent 
were we to deny the privilege of taking tli 
courses to anyone on campus. 
CAN OTHERS BENEFIT? 
Within the college we are integrated to the 
degree that schedules will permit. We do 
not exclude architects from sections which 
are basically for music students, and so on. 
The long laboratory hours required in the 
college make scheduling for mixed groups 
extremely difficult. Because of our own 
scheduling problem, the pattern of classes 
designed for fine arts is apt to be unpopu-
lar elsewhere on the campus and this is one 
partical situation, I suppose, which keeps 
us from enrolling students from other col-
leges in these courses. There is nothing 
mystical in thought and expression or history 
of arts and civilization, however, that in it-
self makes either course more or less valuable 
than another course in the same field. I 
happen to agree that cultural history for 
people in the arts has more meaning and ex-
cites more interest and response than does 
political history. To a historian who is dif-
ferently oriented, this may seem incompre-
hensible but for many people man's cultural 
achievements can be as significant as his ex-
changes of power. Because man leaves be-
hind him artifacts that can be looked at and 
evaluated, his record in cultural terms is 
quite clear: it does not depend on a phrase or 
value judgment seen through an overlay of 
many years. 
ELECTIVE TIME 
Most students in the college take a psy-
chology course in the third year and there-
after they are free to spend their elective 
time on anything that presents itself. A 
year or two ago I made a survey of the kinds 
of courses that art students get into at jun-
ior and senior levels. The range is surpris-
ingly wide, and the number of students mov-
ing into areas of mathematics, science, lan-
guages, humanities and the arts other than 
their own, surprisingly great. Artists are, 
after all, people--sometimes, if they are good 
artists, people with perceptions heightened 
by experience and possessing a vast curiosity 
about everything that goes on. 
We do not, of course, achieve this high 
state of receptivity with every student. No 
art school does. We have our full share of 
good people, however, and in my view we are 
one of the more highly favored schools in 
this respect. I have lived among student 
and faculty artists through all of my days, 
and I assure you they are as diverse, as sub-
ject to period of exaltation and exhaustion, 
as keenly concerned about the world as it is 
or as it could be, as anxious to assist others, 
as full of frailty and nobility, as prone to the 
ordinary and the exotic as any other group 
you can imagine. 
THE OVERPPROJECTORS 
Art students tend to respond externally to 
the ideas they are trying to absorb internally. 
Thus drama students who are learning how 
to project, sometimes overproject in the pres-
ence of others. I suppose this is disturbing 
to the underprojectors around them. In the 
interest of international goad will and un-
derstanding, however, I suggest that we could 
practice on this campus a bit of tolerance 
toward those whose ideas are not like our 
own, and this applies to the painters who 
look at the actors, the actors who look at the 
musicians, the musicians who look at the 
architects, and all of the engineers, scientists, 
and humanitarians who regard the College of 
Fine Arts and its inhabitants. Some of the 
most luxuriant beards a few years ago were 
being worn (I think) by electrical engineers, 
though the College of Fine Arts got the 
credit for them. College years are expressive 
years and a time when young artists (and 
Others) are rapidly growing in their aware-
ness of all the possibilities the world holds 
for them. It neither shocks nor surprises me 
when the evidence of this phenomenon is

longer; more than 4.5 million Ameri-
cans, living today, would be dead if the 
U.S. death rate had remained at the 1935 
level. 
Additionally, in only the short time of 
10 years?by 1975?the average Ameri-
can family will be earning $9,525 a year; 
the average wage earner will be working 
37 hours a week, and the chances are 
good that half of us will be under 26 
years of age. 
Yes, we are making great progress. 
But, in one particular field, we are barely 
above the level of the Stone Age. The 
field of living together?in peace and 
mutual respect?as free human beings 
and responsible nations. 
Today, the world's peoples are becom-
ing increasingly more interdependent 
and less self-sufficient. The bare facts 
of life tell us we cannot afford to hide 
behind "fortress America" or be isola-
tionists ever again. 
I believe the late Adlai Stevenson 
summed up what I am attempting to say 
rather well when he cautioned: 
Most of us recognize that a real with-
drawal from the affairs of the world is im-
possible. We killed isolationism at Los 
Alamos, for ourselves, and for everybody 
else. Our planetary society is now one, even 
If only in the unity of potential destruction. 
We cannot get off and float outside this 
particular spaceship. We and the human 
race are going to survive?or not?together. 
Today, it is more important than ever 
before that nations talk over their dif-
ferences. For today, as imperfect an 
organization as it may be, the United 
Nations, nevertheless, stands as a useful 
forum for discussion and reason among 
nations, for the airing of tensions and 
age-old hatreds and misunderstandings 
so that peaceful settlements may be 
order of the day rather than the dis-
astrous terror and human misery of re-
sort to the habits of the Stone Age. 
And what is the alternative to this? 
To peaceful settlements and a policy of 
remaining strong on the one hand, while 
maintaining a powerful and ready re-
talitory force on the other? To pur-
suing peace, while ready to defend it 
at the same time? 
Nuclear holocaust. That is the alter-
native. The American battle deaths of 
World War I totaled 53,000. In World 
War II, 291,000 died. By comparison, a 
full-scale nuclear exchange between the 
United States and the Soviet Union to-
day, lasting less than an hour, could kill 
almost 100 million Americans and over 
100 million Russians. This nuclear toll 
of Americans alone would be equal to 
300 World War II's. 
Today, the military might of the Unit-
ed States is terrifyingly overwhelming. 
Our forces are so large as to be able to 
survive a sneak nuclear attack on this 
country, and survive with such sufficient 
force to literally blow the society of the 
attacker off the face of the map. Our 
adversaries know this full well. And we 
are confident in our awareness of this, 
too. 
General Curtis Lemay put his finger 
right on the heart of the matter when he 
said: 
No one actually wins a modern war. 
We must learn to live together in our 
constantly shrinking little terrestrial 
ball. Ready and alert we are. Willing 
to negotiate in Vietnam. And I am 
happy to say we are also anxious and 
willing to pursue peace in the councils 
of the United Nations. For, as imperfect 
as it may be, it is also our only hope for 
a world body with the majority of respon-
sible nations sitting in it, and where the 
weight of world opinion watches as a 
silent, but ever-present and ever-import-
ant ingredient. 
Mr. Speaker, I am far from being a 
one7worlder. But, I believe I am an 
optimist. The world today is not yet 
ready for an effective, strong world gov-
ernment, but we continue to need the 
services and the forum presented by the 
United Nations. Perhaps, someday man 
will have learned enough in the ways of 
living together to want to live under one. 
While today, the world is far from a per-
fect place in which to live, I sincerely be-
lieve it is a far better place in which to 
live because of the presence of the Unit-
ed Nations. 
I believe Americans, in all walks of life, 
should reflect, even for a moment, this 
Sunday, October 24, United Nations Day. 
Reflect on what kind of world we live-in 
now. And, whether we are willing to ac-
knowledge it or not, what kind of place 
it might have been or would be today 
without this imperfect, yet hopefully 
struggling world body. 
As the late beloved President John F. 
Kennedy pointed out: 
We seek a relaxation of tensions without 
relaxing our guard. 
Today our guard is up and ready. And 
just as surely as the great American 
eagle on our national seal holds the ar-
rows of war in one claw, he also tightly 
grips the olive branch of peace in the 
other. And if you look closely, you will 
note that he is looking in the direction 
of the olive branch and away from the 
former. This symbolizes what this Na-
tion has attempted to do, and what I 
firmly believe we must continue to do. 
No, the United Nations is not perfect. 
Neither is man himself. 
But an important ingredient of man's 
climb from the cave of the stone age to 
today's radiant promise has been hope. 
And I find reassuringly that it is also an 
important part of the atmosphere at the 
United Nations. The historic visit of 
Pope Paul VI dramatized that. All 
Americans should support their Nation's 
continued dedication to the pursuit of 
peace. 
Let us all hope and pray that the men 
and women meeting at the United Na-
tions will be divinely inspired and 
guided. The very future of mankind 
may well hang in the balance of their 
deliberations. 
Let us hope and pray that it will be 
strengthened and improved and thus 
become an even more potent force for 
lasting world peace. 
And finally, let us as Americans, al-
ways recall the American eagle and the 
arrows and the olive branch he clutches. 
And the balance between the two. 
GALLANT GI DIES WORRYING 
ABOUT VIET PROTESTS IN UNITED 
STATES 
(Mr. GIBBONS (at the request of Mr. 
DYAL) was granted permission to extend 
his remarks at this point in the RECORD 
and to include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Speaker, in the 
Wednesday, October 20 edition of my 
hometown newspaper, the Tampa Trib-
une, appeared an Associated Press story 
by Hugh A. Mulligan. It is about Viet-
nam, and why a young American U.S. 
naval officer was willing to risk his life 
trying to help the people of South 
Vietnam. 
Today, protests and counterprotests 
are much in the news. I would hope all 
Americans could read Mr. Mulligan'S 
story about Navy Lt. Ray Ellis and what 
he died for. - 
The story speaks for itself: 
[From the Tampa (Fla.) Tribune, 
Oct. 20? 1965] 
GALLANT GI DIES WORRYING ABOUT VIET 
PROTESTS IN 'UNITED STATES 
(By Hugh A. Mulligan) 
SAIGON?The last time I saw Ray Ellis he 
was sitting on the deck of his RAG (river 
assault group) boat deep in the mangrove 
swamps and talking earnestly about col-
lege kids tearing up their draft cards and 
picketing the Army terminals. 
Dawn was Just breaking over the Mekong 
Delta, and Vietnamese infantry troops were 
piling off the little steel river boats and 
haoking their way into the swamps. It was 
one of those exquisite delta dawns, with a 
vast flamingo sky swallowing up the morning 
star and luminous white clouds already puff-
ing up into thunderheads far out over' the 
South China Sea. Ray loved the beauty of 
it all as much as he hated the horror of war. 
"If only these kids could come out to Viet-
nam and see for themselves what it's all 
about," he was saying in the quiet, patient 
way he had of making a point, without ran-
cor, without argument. 
"If they could see how nothing moves on 
these rivers once the sun goes down because 
of the Communists, and what it means for 
a peasant to give half his rice crop to a 
roving Vietcong tax collector, and what cal-
culated terror and murder can do to disrupt 
any semblance of government control in even 
the humblest fishing hamlet. If they could 
just spend a few hours on my boat talking 
to these Vietnamese sailors, they might learn 
why these people still go on fighting after 
20 years of it." 
But, no, that wasn't the last time I saw 
Ray Ellis. 
I saw him once again as his coffin passed 
through Tan Son Nhut airport in Saigon on 
its way to his home in Cape May Court 
House, N.J. 
The delta that Ray Ellis had loved so 
much, the lovely, lethal delta, had exploded 
all around him. 
The recommendation for a posthumous 
Silver Star, now before the President of the 
United States, tells how Lt. Ray Ellis, U.S. 
Navy Reserve, gave his life to save the Viet-
namese navy boat and the Vietnamese sailors 
he had come to aid. 
It tells how at 5:55 one sunlit afternoon 
RAG Unit 27 was caught in an ambush in a 
narrow bend of a stream, and hit from both 
sides by mortars, recoilless rifles, and .50 cali-
ber machineguns. 
It tells how Ellis made his way across the 
deck from the pilothouse to the radio 
through that curtain of fire to call for an air-
strike, made his way back again to take corn-

.liutional duties in enforcing the laws of 
the United States. 
The thrust of this letter obviously is to 
forgive previously adjudicated antitrust vio-
lations committed by a number of large 
banks. The pressures that have been brought 
to bear on your office and the Congress by 
Manufacturers Hanover and other banks hav-
ing special interests in this matter represents 
the most flagrant violation of due I procais 
that I have witnessed in my 37 years fn 
Congress. 
The very suggestion that you as the chief 
law enforcement officer of the U.S. Govern-
ment ask the courts to bow to unwarranted 
political pressures repudiates the very prin-
ciples that govern our country, including 
the fundamental principles of separation of 
powers and the independence and integrity 
of the judiciary. 
To accede to these demands made by 
Members of the Senate who have asked you 
ba their individual capacities to present their 
views on this matter to the several courts 
would be tantamount to abdicating on the 
part of the chief legal officer of this Nation 
his responsibility to represent the Nation 
as a whole. It would also have a generally 
unwholesome effect on respect for law and 
order among the general public and would 
amount to an official seal of approval on 
improper lobbying by parties directly in-
terested in the outcome of these cases. 
Also, it should be pointed out that the 
Senators signing the letter of October 22 
have been misinformed and inadvertently 
have therefore furnished you erroneous in-
formation. Contrary to the statement in 
their letter, no legislation on bank mergers 
of any nature has been passed by the House 
Banking and Currency Committee. Fur-
thermore, there can be no assurances that 
the House of Representatives will act with 
the degree of haste indicated in the Sena-
tors' letters and as desired by Manufactur-
ers Hanover and other banks who have 
vested interests in this matter. In fact a 
number of members of the House Banking 
and Currency Committee are insisting upon 
additional hearings on this issue. 
/t should also be pointed out that there 
were no hearings on the bank merger bill 
(S. 1698) as passed the Senate nor was there 
any substantive discussion on this bill either. 
/ am assured by several Members of the Sen-
ate that if and when a bank merger bill 
passes the House of Representatives and goes 
to the Senate for their consideration that a 
real fight will take place on this matter. 
There are many Senators who feel that this 
matter was inadequately considered on the 
Senate side and they wish to explore such 
legislation that would remove the effective-
ness of the antitrust laws from the banking 
industry in detail., 
I draw your attention to the fact that it 
was 2 years after the Philadelphia decision 
and 4 years after the Manufacturers Hanover 
case was originally brought that it was de-
cided by this fourth largest bank in the 
country that they would run to the Con-
gress for forgiveness from antitrust prose-
cution. Manufacturers Hanover did not 
even exhaust its legal remedies in this mat-
ter?rather they ran to the Congress for spe-
cial relief. 
Finally, I draw your attention to pages 
26502 and 26503 of the CONear.ssioNAL RECORD 
of October 19, page 16754 of the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD of October 20, and pages 
26848 and 26849 of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 
of October ill, 1965, wherein you will note a 
complete refutation of the position taken 
by all of the Republican members of the 
House Banking and Curre:acy Committee and 
a handful of Democrats that a bank merger 
bill and report was passed by the House 
Ranking and Currency Committee. It is in-
conceivable that either the Rules Commit-
No. I98--pt. 2-32 
tee or the House leadership will consider this 
outrageous action by a minority of the Bank-
ing and Currency Committee as being a law-
ful and proper report of a House bill from the 
Banking and Currency Committee. There-
fore, at this point the Banking and Currency 
Committee still has before it S. 1698 and re-
lated bills for consideration in the next ses-
sion of Congress.

HOD. NICHOLAS DEB. KATZENBACH, 
Attorney General of the United States, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL: It had been 
our earnest hope and expectation that by 
the conclusion of the first session of this 
Congress action would have been completed 
on a measure clarifying the existing confu-
sion with regard to bank mergers. Such a 
bill, S. 1698, passed the Senate without 
dissent last June, and a somewhat differeht 
but equally effective measure was reported 
by the House Banking and Currency Com-
mitee just this week?but not in time for 
final floor action by the House and Senate. 
It is our expectation that we will have 
enacted such a measure in the early days of 
the forthcoming session of Congress. This 
being so, we are deeply concerned that dur-
ing this interim period, action might be 
taken with regard to several of the bank 
mergers now challenged by your Department 
which might prejudice the application of 
the new law. As you know, two such merger 
cases are now in the final stages of settle-
ment by divestiture, and the four others are 
in various pretrial or trial stages. All of 
these cases will be basically affected by new 
legislation which, as we have noted, we 
expect to be enacted shortly. For example, 
the bill passed by the Senate would termi-
nate all six pending cases; all versions of the 
bill considered by the House Banking and 
Currency Committee would terminate three 
mergers consummated before the decision of 
the Supreme Court in the Philadelphia case; 
and the bill reported by the House Banking 
and Currency Committee would also provide 
new standards to be applied in the cases in-
volving the three mergers consummated 
after the Philadelphia decision. 
We take this occasion to express our con-
cern lest what seems clearly to be the sense 
of Congress in the area of bank mergers be 
frustrated by action taken in any of the six 
pending cases. 
Accordingly, we urge that you refrain 
from any further steps in these cases, par-
ticularly the two which are now in the final 
stages of divestiture, until the Congress 
has had an opportunity during the coming 
session to conclude its consideration of the 
pending bank merger legislation. 
In addition, in view of the fact that these 
cases are pending in the judicial branch, we 
request that on our behalf you respectfully 
bring our views to the attention of the sev-
eral courts having jurisdiction over these 
six pending cases.

SUNDAY, OCTOBER 24?UNITED 
NATIONS DAY 
(Mr. GIBBONS (at the request of' Mr. 
DIAL) was granted permission to ex-
tend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Speaker, this 
Congress is about to complete a long and 
fruitful session. The atmosphere is 
filled with the packing of bags and saying 
of goodbyes. But, before we leave this 
historic Chamber, I would like to take 
a moment to reflect on the significance 
of a special day, this Sunday, October 
24, which is United Nations Day. 
As we all know, the United Nations 
has had a 20-year history marked by 
some noteworthy successes and some 
rather dismal failures. We know the 
names of both. The India-Pakistan dis-
pute, Cyprus, Korea, the Congo, and of 
course, Vietnam. It has been charac-
terized by trust and derision. By both 
hope and fear. The hope is embodied in 
its great potential for peace and the 
fear is that of the terrible gnawing of 
total stalemate which could cause it to 
watch impotently while the world burns 
to a crisp in a nuclear. holocaust. 
We live today in a vastly changing so-
ciety, one which sees everything in a 
constant state of flux. Today, every 
man, no matter where he may live?in 
the isolated hamlet in the deepest reaches 
of darkest Africa, or along a noisy, 
rushing Manhattan street?is only hours 
and minutes away from each other. And 
who really knows what tomorrow may 
bring? Only seconds away. Neighbors 
in a crowded space-age neighborhood. 
Today, in virtually every conceivable 
field of human endeavor, man surges 
ahead. It has been predicted that 
within the relatively short span of 30 
years?one generation?we will see 
5,000-mile-an-hour commercial aircraft, 
freight shot across the continent by mis-
sile, electronically controlled highways 
and underground transportation system 
shrinking the world of Marco Polo to Lil-
liputian dimensions. Into one great, big 
overgrown backyard. 
Man can conquer space, overcome 
cancer and other diseases and provide 
enough food and shelter for all of the 
world's population before the end of the 
20th century, a leading scientist has re-
cently pointed out. But, he also is capa-
ble of the "complete destruction of civili-
zation," he added. He noted that "the 
conquest of space will be easier than the 
banishment of war." 
As an illustration, look at the phenom-
enal progress we have made in only one 
field, medicine. Cancer survival rates 
have improved from the 1937 rate of 1 
in 7 to today's 1 in 3. Early diagnosis, 
better surgical and radioactive techniques 
and more than a dozen new therapeutic 
agents are responsible. Seven out of ten 
prescriptions today are for drugs not 
even known in 1950; over 300,000 babies 
born last year are alive today as a result 
of the great advances in medical care of 
the last 45 years; today's babies will live 
at least 10 years longer than their 30-
year-old parents, and be productive

mend of the ship when the entire pilothouse 
was wiped out, and was venturing across the 
deck once more to help a wounded Vietnam-
ese sailor when a .50 caliber machinegun 
ripped into his hip, cut in two the hunting 
knife hanging on his belt and drove the 
shards into his body so that he died almost 
before the cry escaped his lips. 
Two boats were sunk that day, and two 
more put out of commission. In addition to 
Ellis, the only American on the operation, 
44 Vietnamese soldiers and 13 Vietnamese 
sailors gave their lives in that crooked bend 
of a narrow, muddy river. The Vietcong 
dead numbered 83. 
The citation will attest to the bravery and 
competence of Lt. Ray Ellis, but it won't 
say anything about what, he did for the Viet-
namese people and what they thought of him. 
The citation is no place to tell how Ellis 
came 40 miles by helicopter twice a week 
from his base in My Tho to teach English 
at the Vietnamese school in Saigon. 
The citation is no place to tell about the 
nights he spent dining in the homes of his 
Vietnamese sailors, and about how he orga-
nized them into a volleyball team and the 
hours he put in trying to learn their 
language. 
No citation will tell about the flowers the 
people of My Tho heaped on his coffin, and 
the delegation they sent to Saigon for his 
final rites on this side of the world. 
The citation attests that Ray Ellis was a 
member of the Naval Reserve. It doesn't say 
that he had been accepted into the Regular 
Navy 2 days before he was killed but, because 
he was out on that delta operation, had not 
got around to signing the final papers. 
Maybe people on the picket lines would 
have a hard time understanding why a for-
mer teacher from Gettysburg, Pa., would 
want to make a career out of the Navy, but 
if Ray was around he'd explain it to them. 
He had a teacher's patience with those who 
couldn't understand. 
LACK OF ADEQUATE ATTENTION TO 
EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED CHIL-
DREN 
(Mr. GIBBONS (at the, request of Mr. 
DYAL) was granted permission to extend 
his remarks at this point in the RECORD 
and to include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Speaker, it is es-
timated tha.t there are over 500,000 emo-
tionally disturbed youngsters in the 
United States today. If this fact were 
not shocking enough, the sad fact that 
only about 2 percent of them, or less 
than 10,000, are today receiving any form 
of treatment, should be even more shock-
ing and disheartening. Lee Harvey Os-
wald was once one of these youngsters. 
And we all know what kind of member 
of society that name represented. It 
brings back a sickening memory for most 
Americans. 
For some time, I have been greatly 
concerned with this problem and the pos-
sibility of early detection and prevention 
of these motional problems in the pre-
school and first three grades of elemen-
tary school early enough to do something 
about it before it turns into violence typ-
lified by Oswald, or the school dropout, 
the unemployable person, the juvenile 
delinquent, the maladjusted, the criminal 
or the psychotic. 
On September 30, I introduced a bill, 
H.R. 11322, to provide a program of fed-
erally assisted early detection and pre-
vention of this type of behavior through 
child development specialists in the 
school systems of the country. Just this 
week, hearings were held by the Sub-
committee on General Education of the 
House Education and Labor Committee. 
At that time, several experts in the field 
testified in favor of this legislation. 
In the Thursday, October 21, edition 
of the Washington Post, there appeared 
an outstandingly perceptive article by 
Mr. George Lardner, Jr. It dramatically 
portrays the problem we face in the Na-
tion from lack of adequate attention to 
emotionally disturbed children. Mr. 
Lardner has made a distinct contribution 
to the ultimate solution of this whole 
troublesome matter by focusing public 
attention on it. 
I commend the article to my col-
leagues: 
[From the Washington (D.C.) Post, Oct. 21, 
1965] 
CITY LAGS IN MEETING PUPIL BEHAVIOR 
PROBLEMS 
(By George Lardner, Jr.) 
It is usually estimated, says city health 
director Murray Grant, that about 1 of every 
10 youngsters of school age is emotionally 
disturbed. 
With more than 145,000 students enrolled 
In Washington's public schools, that can 
spell a lot of trouble. 
Their problems may seem small at first. 
They may be easy to treat, but unless the dis-
turbed youngsters are gvien the attention 
they need, Dr. Grant says, they could even-
tually wind up in institutions such as St. 
El izab eths. 
"Take a child with a speech defect," he 
says. "He finds himself ostracized by other 
children. They won't play with him; instead 
they make fun of him. The child gets a 
feeling of insecurity. 
"And if he already has some inherent per-
sonality weakness, the feeling builds up and 
up. If you don't work with the child, or at 
least correct his speech, it's going to get 
worse. These are the kind of things that 
we believe cause the youngsters to end up in 
institutions." 
So far neither the city's schools nor the 
Health Department has been able to do more 
than scratch the surface of behavior problems 
of the young that range from minor to 
psychotic. 
"It's a hit or miss proposition now," Dr. 
Grant says. "We try to consult with the 
schools, help the teachers, have nurses visit 
the homes and treat some of the children 
at our three child guidance clinics." 
But little more than 400 youngsters are 
carried on the clinics' rolls as active cases. 
They range in age from 2 years old to teen-
agers. Most are referred to the clinics by 
the public schools. 
The public schools, in turn, refer only a 
small fraction of the emotionally disturbed 
youngsters in their classrooms. 
According to the District of Columbia As-
sociation for Mental Health, 7282 schoolchil-
dren were singled out by their teachers last 
year for psychological study by the school 
system's pupil appraisal service. About 1,200 
were diagnosed as having severe emotional 
problems. But, the association says, about 
2,000 others suggested for study each year 
aren't tested at all, because of staff short-
ages. And, Dr. Grant says, "psychological 
testing by itself does not reveal emotional 
disturbance." 
"Many teachers do not even bother to refer 
children unless they are disrupting the class-
room," adds Jonas V. Morris, of the Mental 
Health Association. "They know years can 
pass before the child is seen. This means 
there are in our schools many quiet, with-
drawn, disturbed children who are being 
neglected." 
27581 
In a section of the antipoverty program's 
Operation Head Start for preschool children 
this past summer, the association also re-
ports, 100 children were found with suspected 
mental problems, 30 of them severe. 
One of them, Morris says, as an example, 
was "a 6-year-old who had beaten a puppy to 
death with a club `because he felt like it.'" 
' Had all Head Start youngsters here been 
screened, some experts feel, 500 cases would 
have been found. 
To get its workers into the schools and the 
homes instead of concentrating on psycho-
logical testing downtotvn, school officials 
asked for an additional staff of 71 in the 
1966-67 budget for the pupil appraisal serv-
ice. This, they estimated, would produce 
four full teams of psychiatrists, psycholo-
gists, and social workas?with each team 
serving 36,000 students. 
Budget cutters in the District Building 
chopped the request down to 22 new posi-
tions. School officials have asked the District 
Commissioners to come to the rescue. 
Dr. Grant seems to be faring somewhat 
better at his end. Next month he hopes to 
start a child-care unit at the new Commu-
nity Health Center on the grounds of the Dis-
riot of Columbia General Hospital. Funds 
are available, but other health workers have 
been using the space, with only four child 
guidance workers squeezed in. 
When the others move out, a full-fledged 
day-care program with a staff of 19 will be 
started almost immediately, Dr. Grant said. 
A 20-bed residential treatment center pro-
viding round-the-clock care for more serious 
disturbed youngsters should be ready next 
spring. By then, he hopes, a special school 
for both day-care patients and those needing 
full-time attention will be in operation. 
After that, Dr. Grant has a $50,000 request 
riding in the new budget to start a program 
for mentally retarded youngsters. The Cen-
ter's staff also will work with families and 
teachers of youngsters who may need only an 
occasional visit. 
But that's just a beginning. Located in 
an old, refurbished building, the Center is 
designed to take care only of the central 
chunk of the city, including some 241,000 
rest lents. Dr. Grant hopes to set up three 
others. 
"These services we are proposing for the 
emotionally disturbed are practically non-
existent," he says. "You can hardly get them 
around Washington even if you want them 
privately." 
But the Health Department can't do it all. 
It's likely to wind up concentrating on the 
most serious cases, such as the 11-year-old 
boy recently found sleeping with dogs, and 
the 6-year-old who killed one. The School 
Board's request for beefing up its own staff 
at least deserves to get out of the District 
Building intact. It's bad arithmetic to save 
money on "little problems" and pretend they 
won't get bigger. 
REPORT ON THE 89TH CONGRESS 
(Mr. GONZALEZ was granted permis-
sion to extend his remarks at this point 
in the RECORD and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Speaker, a gen-
eration from now, the. 89th Congress will 
be remembered as one of the greatest of 
all meetings of this legislative body. 
This Congress has provided measures 
whose full impact may not be felt for 
years to come; it has enacted laws that 
will benefit every segment of society, 
laws that will ultimately bring the Amer-
ican dream closer to full fruition. I 
have been proud of the achievements of 
this Congress, and believe that the coun-
try will be well pleased with the reports

27582 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE October 22t16 
that Members will take home at the 
end of the session, for we have responded 
to the clear mandate given in last No-
vember's historic election, when reaction 
was abandoned for reality by the over-
whelming majority of voters. 
This Nation, as the premier power of 
the world, is involved in an inextricable 
manner with the affairs of the world; any 
major event that takes place in almost 
any country in the world affects our in-
terests in one way or another, and vir-
tually every major event in this country 
affects in one way or another the vital 
interests of practically every other power 
in the world, both great and small. The 
leadership offered by our President in 
conducting the intricate foreign affairs 
of the United States has been excellent, 
and I believe that our people are confi-
dent that his wisdom will continue to 
steer a safe course for the United States 
in these perilous times. Thanks to his 
leadership, our world position is safe, 
and we are safe, and I pray that matters 
will continue to remain so; I know that 
under President Johnson's hand they 
will. 
If these times are notable for foreign 
affairs, that is the inevitable concom-
itant of world leadership. But for many 
years, while we have been overwhelm-
ingly concerned about foreign affairs, we 
have paid too little heed and too little 
attention to our domestic affairs; this 
session of Congress is historic because in 
these past months we have enacted do-
mestic programs that have been called 
for and needed and debated for years, 
but never acted upon until now. 
The programs of this Congress affect 
every sphere: 
DEFENSE AND NATIONAL SECURITY 
This Congress has been unstinting in 
Its support of a Defense budget that will 
continue to strengthen our military 
power and enable us to meet threats of 
whatever scale, in any place in the world. 
We will spend better than $46 billion in 
this fiscal year for the Armed Forces; and 
we will spend $21/2 billion for atomic 
power research, development and con-
struction. To care for the veterans of 
past wars, we are providing new facilities 
and programs, and these facilities and 
programs will accrue to the benefit of vet-
erans of the twilight wars we are pres-
ently engaged in, and for the unknown 
engagements that we may be called upon 
to participate in the future. Veterans 
programs will consume $51/2 billion this 
fiscal year; and this will include some 
$800,000 for the planning of a new, ad-
vanced veterans hospital to be built in 
my district. That new hospital will meet 
the needs of 700 patients, and will pro-
vide general medical and surgical care, 
and psychiatric care for the veterans of 
south Texas. 
San Antonio and Bexar County house 
a gigantic military complex; I am proud 
that my district plays a vital role in na-
tional defense. It has traditionally had 
a strong military interest and influence, 
that continues today as it did in 1718. 
San Antonio contributes mightily to 
our national defense and security, and I 
am proud to report that this mighty 
complex has been maintained in full op-
eration by this Congress. 
The great achievements of this Con-
gress lie in the field of new legislation, 
however, and I am proud to be among 
the authors of this grand effort to im-
prove the quality of life in America. 
DOMESTIC AFFAIRS 
Laws enacted this year include exten-
sive revision of the Social Security Act; 
new measures in education, in civil 
rights, in fiscal policy, in urban affairs, 
in beautification and conservation, in 
immigration and in economic oppor-
tunity. 
THE TAX CUT 
Last year, for the first time, Congress 
voted to reduce income taxes, even 
though the Federal budget was running 
a deficit; the reasoning was that the tax 
cut would spur the economy to new 
growth, with the ultimate result that 
Federal receipts would increase. The 
policy paid off; Federal receipts in 1965 
were $2 billion above what they had been 
in 1964, although the tax cut had reduced 
taxation by $11 billion. The gross na-
tional product is now expanding at 71/2 
percent annually?the best growth rate 
in years; and 72 million Americans are 
fully employed. There is still unemploy-
ment in the land, but the growth of the 
economy promises improvements in the 
days to come. 
This year, the excise taxes imposed by 
the Federal Government were cut by $4.6 
billion, and the bulk of that tax reduc-
tion has been passed on to consumers, 
and has resulted in the continued ex-
pansion and upsurge in our economy. 
Times are good, and getting better for 
all of us, doomsayers and gloomers not-
withstanding. I have confidence in the 
strength of the economy, and am proud 
to have supported the fiscal policy that 
has helped to make our prosperity pos-
sible. 
THE WAR ON POVERTY 
Even if times have never been better, 
there are still those who suffer; and in 
San Antonio there are about 120,000 per-
sons who live in families that have an-
nual incomes of less than $3,000 
annually. Because there is deprivation 
in the midst of prosperity, and because 
human needs must be met, and because 
we do not believe that poverty is in-
evitable, we have instituted great new 
programs to make economic opportuni-
ties available to all. In Bexar County 
this year, thousands of people, from pre-
school youngsters in Project Head Start, 
to Neighborhood Youth Corps men, to 
migrant workers?all benefited from the 
war on poverty. 'Youths earned money 
to enable them to stay in school, and at 
the same time learned job skills and the 
discipline needed to stay on the job; and 
pre-school-age children got the training 
that they desperately needed to enable 
them to have a chance to compete in the 
classrooms with their more fortunate fel-
lows; and migrants began learning how 
to live better, and perhaps to break out 
of the cycle of misery in which they are 
captured. Job Corps men are learning 
skills and becoming productive citizens. 
All told, the war on poverty will spend 
$2,600,000 or more in Bexar County by 
the end of this fiscal year. The benefi-
ciaries include the whole community. 
Just as we in the sixties are the benefi-
ciaries of the depression programs of 30 
years ago, so will these people be the 
beneficiaries tomorrow of what is being 
done now; and the whole country will be 
better off for having given them a chance 
to win in life. 
EDUCATION 
The surest way to maintain our na-
tional strength is to develop as fully as 
possible our greatest single resource--
our people. Education is the key to the 
future, and this Congress has supported 
education through a wide range of new 
legislation. The Elementary and Sec-
ondary Education Act of 1965 will pour 
some $2 million into impoverished 
schools in Bexar County this year, so 
that every child can get a good educa-
tion, even though his parents may live 
in a poor neighborhood. The schools of 
my district will benefit through older Pro-
grams, as well, like the Federal impact 
money of Public Laws 815 and 874, which 
provide millions to our schools every 
year. College dormitories, classrooms, 
and laboratories are constructed through 
loans and grants; research is supported; 
scholars are helped by grants and loans; 
and students who are working their way 
through higher education are helped by 
the work-study program. The educa-
tional programs enacted by this and 
preceding Congresses have helped to in-
sure the future of all our citizens, and I 
am certain that the quality of schools in 
San Antonio would be much less than it 
Is now, were it not for this legislation, 
and that a great many students are be-
ing helped today who might not other-
wise have ever had the chance to gain 
a complete education. I believe that 
everyone should have a full opportunity 
to absorb as much knowledge as he can?
and I am proud to have supported meas-
ures that will help make this possible. 
MEDICARE 
If we must see that our youth are pre-
pared for tomorrow, we must also see to 
the needs of your parents, who after all 
have left us with the heritage that we 
enjoy; they should not be deprived of a 
decent life, after what they have done 
for us. This year, Congress has passed 
a measure that will prevent our parents 
from having to fear financial disaster 
from the diseases that plague us all, but 
more especially those who are more than 
65 years of age. 
Social security recipients this year 
were given a 7-percent increase in their 
benefits; this will aid them in keeping 
up with the rising cost of living, and help 
them maintain independence in their 
postemployment days. But most impor-
tant to them, and to their families, is 
medical care provided under social se-
curity. 
Soon, anyone covered by social secu-
rity, who is receiving pension benefits, 
will be able to enter the hospital for 90 
days at a time, or receive 180 days of 
nursing home care. Hospital bills will 
be paid in full after the first $40; and 
certain hospital service will also be coy-

few days of the new session for considera-
tion by the Senate. I strongly urge, on 
behalf of my colleague [Mr. SMATHERS], 
and myself, that the majority leader fol-
low that course, because rather heavy in-
terest rates on the bond issue which are 
outstanding will continue to accumulate 
while this matter awaits decision. 
I trust that it is the intention of the 
Senator from Montana to call up this bill 
early in the session. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
have discussed this matter with the dis-
tinguished Senators from Florida, [Mr. 
HOLLAND and Mr. SMATHERS] and also 
with the distinguished Senator from 
Delaware [Mr. WILLIAMS] and the dis-
tinguished Senator from Ohio [Mr. 
LAUSCHE] as well as the distinguished 
Senator from Tennessee [Mr. BASS]. I 
assure the Senators from Florida that I 
shall be most happy to see that the meas-
ure covering this most worthwhile project 
In Dade County will be brought up as 
soon as possible after the Senate con-
venes for its second session next January. 
Mr. HOLLAND. On behalf of my col-
league Mr. SMATHERS and myself, I 
thank the majority leader warmly. I 
see the minority leader, the Senator from 
Illinois [Mr. DIRKSEN] concurring, ap-
parently, in this intent, and I certainly 
appreciate the cooperation which we 
have received today from both leaders. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I anticipate with-
out question that the Senator from 
Delaware [Mr. WILLIAMS] and the Sen-
ator from Ohio [Mr. LAUSCHE] will not 
be averse to bringing the bill up at that 
time. 
Mr. BASS. Mr. President, will the 
Senator from Montana yield? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I am glad to yield 
to the Senator from Tennessee. 
Mr. BASS. I appreciate, on behalf of 
the majority leader, at 15 minutes after 
midnight on the eve of adjournment, his 
making this commitment, because I be-
lieve this is a worthy project, and I 
know that the majority leader can be 
depended upon to do exactly what he 
says he will do. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. The Senator from 
Tennessee has been in the Chamber for 
several hours and has been participating 
in debate and I am therefore delighted 
to have his support at this time. 
THE SUGAR PROGRAM 
Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. President, will 
the Senator from Montana yield? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield. 
Mr. MoCARTHY. Mr. President, I 
presume that many Senators will not 
read again the RECORD made tonight. I 
hope that those who may be concerned 
about what was accomplished in the con-
ference report will go back and read 
what the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. 
LONG] had to say when the Senate was 
considering the sugar program, and 
what he had to say about what an im-
provement the work of the committee 
was over the other formula proposed, 
and how wisely and prudently we had 
examined the problem. 
Also, I hope that they will read the re-
marks made about the House bill?about 
how it incorporated much of the influ-
ence of the sugar lobbyists?and about 
the special virtue which was claimed for 
us in the Senate because we had not lis-
tened to them. And then I hope that 
they will look at what the conference 
agreed to, and judge how close they came 
to accepting not what was indicated 
here, but what the lobbyists had wanted. 
Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr. President, 
will the Senator from Montana yield? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield. 
Mr. SYMINGTON. I should like to 
associate myself with the remarks of the 
distinguished Senator from Minnesota. 
It happens that I come from a State 
which was assured that if it could pro-
duce the proper beet, it would be consid-
ered for part of the sugar program of 
the United States. 
After spending a great many hundreds 
of thousands of dollars to produce the 
proper beet in a country which was in an 
unfortunate situation because of the 
present condition of cotton, in one crop 
area of my State, we were not even given 
the back of the hand by those who con-
trol the sugar industry. 
ESTABLISHMENT OF DATE OF 
2D SESSION OF 89TH CONGRESS' 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
ask that the Chair lay before the Senate 
House Joint Resolution 788. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the joint resolution (H.J. 
Res. 788) to establish the date of the sec-
ond regular session of the 89th Congress, 
which was read the first time by its title 
and the second time at length, as fol-
lows: 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America 
in Congress assembled, That the second regu-
lar session of the Eighty-ninth Congress shall 
begin at noon on Monday, January 10, 1966. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent for the immedi-
ate consideration of the joint resolution. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the present consideration of 
the joint resolution? 
There being no objection, the joint res-
olution (H.J. Res. 788) was considered, 
ordered to a third reading, read the third 
time, and passed. 
AUTHORITY FOR THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE SENATE TO MAKE AP-
POINTMENTS TO COMMISSIONS 
AND COMMITTEES 
Mr. MANSFIELD submitted the fol-
lowing resolution (S. Res. 161), which 
was considered by unanimous consent 
and agreed to as follows: 
Resolved, That, notwithstanding the final 
adjournment of the present session of the 
Congress, the President of the Senate be, and 
he is hereby, authorized to make appoint-
ments to commissions or committees author-
ized by law, by concurrent action of the two 
Houses, or by order of the Senate. 
TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ANDERSON 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, the 
great Southwest has produced many out-
standing men, but none of greater stature 
27527 
than the senior Senator from New Mex-
ico [Mr. ANDERSON]. His has been an 
exemplary record of public service and 
personal accomplishment. Over the 
years, he has worked tirelessly in behalf 
of his State and the Nation. A great 
many major legislative works have borne 
the stamp of his intellect and humanity. 
Not the least of these is the so-called 
medicare bill enacted earlier this year 
by the 89th Congress. That monumen-
tal work, although one of the greatest 
of his accomplishments, represents but 
one milestone in the professional life of 
the senior Senator from New Mexico. 
Tomorrow, Senator ANDERSON will 
mark an important milestone in his per-
sonal life. On that occasion, Mr. Presi-
dent, he will celebrate his 70th birthday. 
I regret that I cannot offer him my 
congratulations personally since he is not 
in the city at this time. But I did want 
to affirm on this occasion the high value 
that I place on his friendship and coun-
sel. And I did not want the day to go 
by without assuring him of the affection 
of all of the Members of this body. We 
join with his family and friends in wish-
ing him many happy returns of the day. 
PORT ON SOUTHEAST ASIA 
BY SUBCOMMITTEE OF SENATE 
ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE 
Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator from Illinois is recognized. 
Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr. President, will 
the Senator from Illinois yield? ' 
Mr. DIRKSEN. I am glad to yield to 
the Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr. President, I 
should like to refer to a brief report that 
the Subcommittee of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, presided over by the 
distinguished Senator from Nevada [Mr. 
CANNON], and also accompanied by the 
distinguished junior Senator from Ohio 
[Mr. YOUNG] and the distinguished sen-
ior Senator from Maryland [Mr. BREW-
STER] have filed an interesting and con-
structive report as a result of the trip to 
southeast Asia, primarily to Korea and 
South Vietnam. 
? Unfortunately, this report cannot be 
made a part of the RECORD, because it is 
classified; but all those who are privileged 
to read it, as I have been, I am sure will 
find it of great interest, because, in my 
opinion, and I am sure that of the other 
members of the Armed Services Commit-
tee, it is a significant contribution to an 
understanding of the problems that face 
us in that part of the world today. 
AUTHORITY TO SIGN ENROLLED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, I sub-
mit a concurrent resolution, and ask for 
its immediate consideration. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The con-
current resolution will be read by the 
clerk. 
The legislative clerk read the concur-
rent resolution (H. Con. Res. 528) as fol-
lows:

of the concurrent resolution? 
There being no objection, the concur-
rent resolution was considered and agreed 
to. 
PERSONAL STATEMENT BY 
SENATOR MORSE 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, I want 
the RECORD to show that the senior Sena-
tor from Oregon votes against the res-
olution for a sine die adjournment. As 
I have said in recent weeks. I think it 
is inexcusable for Congress to adjourn 
sine die when our boys are dying in 
Vietnam. I think we should remain in 
session as a check. We should remain 
in session to check this administration 
while we are engaged in an unconstitu-
tional war in southeast Asia.

Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, 
from the committee appointed to notify 
the President of the United States that 
the Congress had completed its business 
and was ready to adjourn unless he had

LETTER OF COMMENDATION FROM 
THE PRESIDENT 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
would like to read to the Senate a letter 
received this evening from the President 
of the United States. 
It reads as follows: 
THE WHITE HousE, 
Washington, D.C., October 22, 1965. 
Hon. MIKE MANSFIELD, 
Majority Leader, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENATOR MANSFIELD: As you know, I 
have stated publicly my firm belief that the 
1st session of the 89th Congress will be re-
corded as the greatest session of Congress in 
the history of our Nation. To that state-
ment I would now like to add my own per-
sonal thanks to you for the major part you 
played in making that record possible. You 
have earned the gratitude not only of your 
President, but what is more important, of 
the entire Nation as well. 
This session of the Congress passed 86 ma-
jor administration measures, but there were 
other important items on which the Congress 
did not complete action. 
The final record of this Congress is un-
usually productive. The big job that remains 
before us Is to make certain that what Con-
gress has passed will be carried forward effi-
ciently, with dispatch, and with economy 
and good judgment. The unfinished work on 
our agenda will be our first task in the next 
session of this enlightened and progressive 
Congress. 
Again, the gratitude of the Nation and the 
President goes to each Member who made his 
contribution to this record. What you have 
done will find a shining residence in the his-
tory books. 
Sincerely, 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON. 
TRIBUTE TO THE MINORITY 
LEADER, SENATE, AND SENATE 
STAFFS 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, be-
fore I make the motion to adjourn sine 
die, I would like to express my personal 
gratitude and thanks to the distin-
guished minority leader for the coopera-
tion, understanding, and tolerance that 
he has shown; to all Senators, both 
Democrats and Republicans, who have 
performed so well and so effectively; to 
the staffs, who have supplied us with 
information and counsel as it was 
needed; to the pages who have per-
formed so efficiently and effectively; and, 
for that matter, to everyone, because 
I feel that I owe to all a debt of grati-
tude which I find hard to express in 
words.

dependents. This, of course, is exactly what 
the zealous handful wants. But, I am hope-
ful that the vast majority of Republicans 
who oppose these antics will stay and fight. 
Mr. Gatchell, unless Republicans are will-
ing to welcome to their ranks men and 
women of good will from all walks of life, of 
all races, and of all religions and creeds, then 
they will not secure a majority to permit 
them to assume the responsibilities of gov-
ernment and they will not deserve to assume 
those responsibilities. In enclose some com-
ments which I have made on the future of 
the party, as well as on the antics of the 
extremists of the left and of the right which 
I hope you will find of interest. I also en-
close an exchange of correspondence with a 
Republican assembly unit in our State 
which, similar to other groups in the Re-
publican Party in California, seems to spend 
mire of its time attacking Republican office-
holders, in this case Senator DIRKSEN, than 
in working to promote what the Republican 
Party has historically stood for. So I hope, 
Mr. Gatchell, that you will but look around 
you and I think the answers you seek in 
your letter to me will become self-evident. 
With kindest regards. 
Sincerely yours, 
THOMAS H. Kucnza, U.S. Senator. 
ORANGE COUNTY 
YOUNG REPUBLICANS, 
Orange, Calif October 4, 1965. 
Senator THOMAS KUCHEL, 
Senate Office Building, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENATOR: The Orange County Young 
Republicans will support your charge of neo-
Fascist influences in the Republican Party 
as you can see by the enclosed copy of the 
resolution which was passed at our last meet-
ing. Please send us the information you 
have on this Fascist influence. 
Resolution passed by Orange County Young 
Republicans: 
"Whereas, Senator KUCHEL, on a number 
of occasions in the past, has made reference 
to Fascist influences in his party; and 
"Whereas in Senator KUCHEL'S recent 
withdrawal speech he again mentioned neo-
Fascist influences, and again failed to cite 
specific instances of such neo-Fascists having 
sucessfully penetrated the party; and 
,"Whereas such charges, unless proven, do 
great harm to the Republican Party, and play 
into the hands of the Democrat propagan-
dists: Be it 
"Resolved, That the Orange County Young 
Republicans share Senator Kuciaza's con-
cern, provided that he has information re-
garding neo-Fascist influences, and call upon 
Senator KUCHEL to publicly disclose any in-
formation he has in his possession." 
Thank you for your prompt attention to 
this matter. We will appreciate hearing from 
you. 
Sincerely, 
ORANGE COUNTY YOUNG REPUBLICANS, 
CLAY GATCHELL, County Chairman. 
JULY 27, 1965. 
Miss MARTHA WEBER, 
Secretary, Garden Grove Republican As-
sembly, Post Office Box 644, Garden 
Grove, Calif. 
DEAR MISS WEBER: I have your resolution 
of June 7, 1965, requesting the Republican 
senatorial caucus "to remove Senator EVERETT 
M. Disitszx from his position as Senate mi-
nority leader and replace him with a true 
Republican who will support the principles 
and platform of the 1964 Republican National 
Convention and restore the time-honored 
two-party system to our Nation." 
You charge Senator DIRKSEN SS support-
ing "Democrat-proposed legislation" and 
thus robbing the "rank-and-file Republican 
of the very principles upon which our party 
was founded." 
Your charge and your resolution are sheer 
poppycock. I sometimes wonder about self-
styled Republicans who put unnamed prin-
ciples ahead of what is good for their country 
and accuse everybody who disagrees with 
their unnamed principles of being Socialists, 
Communists, and everything else. I think 
the members of the Garden Grove Repub-
lican Assembly prior to passing such an ab-
surd resolution would do well to spend a 
little time in studying the history of the 
Republican Party of the last century 
from the time of Lincoln through Theodore 
Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
EVERETT MCKINLEY DIRKSEN personifies that 
history. It is a history dedicated to indi-
vidual freedom, to equality of opportunity, 
to a vigorous Federal system and states re-
sponsibilities not merely states rights, to an 
economic climate in which the private sector 
of our economy can grow and prosper, and to 
unselfish patriotism in the conduct of our 
foreign affairs. 
On the great issues of our time, all of which 
were endorsed by the 1960 Republican Plat-
form, which I commend to your group for a 
very careful reading, EVERETT MCKINLEY 
DIRKSEN, the Republican leader, BOURKE B. 
HICKENLOOPER, the chairman of the Repub-
lican Policy Committee, LEVERETT SALTON-
STALL, the chairman of the Senate Repub-
lican Conference, and myself as assistant 
Republican leader, were united 100 percent 
with a majority of Republican Senators in 
our support for that platform and these is-
sues. These issues included support for the 
United Nations, the establishment of the 
Arms Control Agency whose inception oc-
curred during the last Republican adminis-
tration, ratification of the nuclear test ban 
treaty, ratification of the Antarctic Treaty, 
extension of educational and cultural ex-
changes, approval of our foreign aid program, 
and endorsement of the Economic Coopera-
tion Agreement (OECD) concluded by the 
Eisenhower administration. 
I think it is time that some self-styled 
Republicans decided whether they are 
publicans or not and I would suggest that if 
they do not agree with a majority of Repub-
lican Senators, the elected Republican leader-
ship, and the platform, which reflected 8 
years of a Republican administration, that 
they either ought to start studying the his-
tory of the Republican Party and what it 
stands for or find themselves another home. 
I enclose some comments which I have 
made on the future of our party which I hope 
you will find of interest. 
With kindest regards, 
Sincerely yours, 
THOMAS H. KUCHEL, 
U.S. Senator.

TRIBUTE TO MRS. JOSEPH RAMSAY, 
III 
Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. President, I 
commend the Order of Ahepa for their 
resolution of appreciation to Mrs. Joseph 
Ramsay, III, of Minneapolis and Mrs. 
Ramsay for her generosity in providing 
the care for these Greek children. 
I ask unanimous consent that the reso-
lution be included in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the resolu-
tion was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
RESOLUTION OF 43D SUPREME CONVENTION, 
ORDER OF AHEPA, ATHENS, GREECE, AUGUST 
7-13, 1965 
APPRECIATION TO MRS. JOSEPH RAMSAY, III 
Whereas, Mrs. Joseph Gale Ramsay, III, of 
Minneapolis, Minn., has taken upon herself 
to bring to the United States 18 Greek chil-
dren for open heart surgery at the Univer-
sity Hospital in Minneapolis; and 
Whereas Mrs. Ramsay has provided all the 
necessary funds, such as transportation, 
medical, hospital care, and posttherapy care 
of both child and mother involved; and 
Whereas Mrs. Ramsay has shown the 
motherly affection, plus an unusual interest 
in the welfare of the child and mother and 
continues her interest in the patient and 
'mother after recovery: Be it, therefore, 
Resolved, That Mrs. Ramsay's humanitar-
ian deeds be recognized by this body of the 
Supreme Convention of the Order of Ahepa 
and a copy of this resolution be forwarded 
to Mrs. Ramsay with an appropriate letter 
of thanks from this convention. 
GARDEN GROVE REPUBLICAN ASSEMBLY, 
Garden Grove, Calif. 
Whereas Senator EVERETT M. DIRKSEN is the 
Republican leader in the U.S. Senate, and as 
such has the responsibility of leading the 
Republican Members of the Senate in oppo-
sition to the socialistic schemes put forth by 
the Democrat administration; and 
Whereas Senator DnucsEisi has not led his 
colleagues in such opposition and has in fact 
supported and voted for every administra-
tion-proposed bill and urged his fellow Re-
publican Senators to do likewise; and 
Whereas Senator DIRKSEN'S support for 
this Democrat-proposed legislation has 
robbed the rank-and-file Republican of the 
very principles upon which our party was 
founded: Therefore be it 
Resolved, That the Garden Grove Republi-
can Assembly request the Republican sena-
torial caucus to remove Senator EVERETT M. 
DIRKSEN from his position as Senate minority 
leader and replace him with a true Republi-
can who will support the principles and plat-
form of the 1964 Republican National Con-
vention and restore the time-honored two-
party system to our Nation; be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
sent to both U.S. Senators from California, 
CRA State and county officers and to all lo-
cal communication media.

STRATIONS AGAINST U.S. 
POLICY IN VIETNAM 
Mr. SMATHERS., Mr. President, 
most thoughtful Americans have been 
shocked by the activities of peaceniks 
who have been burning their draft cards, 
expressing open contempt for our draft 
laws, and comporting themselves in a 
manner which indicates their inability 
to comprehend the meaning of democ-
racy and its responsibilities. 
Two viewpoints have been expressed 
recently on this subject that I commend 
to the attention of my colleagues. One 
was expressed by cartoonist Al Capp on 
the NBC Monitor show of October 16. 
Mr. Capp expressed in a few cogent 
words the sentiments of the majority 
of thinking Americans. The other view 
was expressed in an editorial which ap-
peared in the Miami Herald of October 
20, when writer Bert Collier drew some 
parallels with the draft riots of 1863. 
Inasmuch as I think every American 
must bear the responsibilities of his Na-
tion in order to receive its benefits, I 
commend these statements to the at-
tention of my colleagues and ask unan-
imous consent that the statement of 
Al Capp and the article by Bert Collier 
be inserted in the body of the RECORD 
at this point. 
There being no objection, the ma-
terial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the NBC's "Monitor," Oct. 16, 1965] 
EDUCATION 
(By Al Capp) 
"Education" is the magic word today. 
You can get bigger amounts of money faster 
by using that one word than the old-fash-
ioned phrase, "Stick 'em up"?and it means 
the same thing.

repairing automobile engines and who's of

genuine use to his community?supporting 
himself and paying taxes?is considered ex-
pendable enough to send to a Vietnam rice 
paddy, but a 20-year-old who's taking a col-
lege course in Latvian literature is considered 
too valuable a national asset to be risked. 
The noncollege kid, who has learned to do 
something his community needed to have 
done?such as repair a carburetor or build a 
house--is considered uneducated. It's his 
duty to risk his life to protect the kid who 
is at college learning something nobody has 
any interest in but himself and which his 
community can very well get along without. 
He's protected by our respect for any non-
sense whatever labeled education and our 
ludicrous failure to understand who are the 
genuinely, usefully educated young people 
among us. 
In the name of education, hundreds of 
thousands of young frauds, dilettantes, 
poseurs, and phonys are being excused from 
military service, the military service that is 
compulsory for hundreds of thousands of the 
sort of kids who are the true and irreplace-
able greatness of this country. 
This is Al Capp, speaking to you on NBC's 
"Monitor." 
LINCOLN'S ANSWER STILL IS BEST?RETURN OF 
BURNING ISSUE: THE DRAFT 
(By Bert Collier) 
The President's dismay over the growing 
antidraft movement, part of the protest 
against the war in Vietnam, is shared by 
many Americans. 
Senator Majority Leader MANSFIELD says its 
promoters show a sense of utter irresponsi-
bility. Minority Leader DIRKSEN says it is 
enough to make any person loyal to his coun-
try weep. 
The FBI has begun an investigation of 
possible Communist influence behind the 
campaign whose leaders now say It will be 
extended to include high school students. 
it is deplorable but it has happened be-
fore. The Civil War draft was also the target 
of protest, and resulted in one of the 
bloodiest riots in the history of the country. 
The New York riots of July 13-15, 1863, 
were, however, a vastly different matter from 
the public burning of draft cards today. 
The draft of that day was full of loopholes 
that favored the rich and politically influen-
tial. Draftees could buy exemption for 8300. 
They Would hire substitutes to take their 
place. They could get their names dropped 
if they knew the right people. 
Of 294,441 men whose names were drawn 
from the lottery wheel, only 88,170 survived 
the original elimination. Of these, 52,288 
paid the Government $15,686,400 for exemp-
tions. Another 26,002 hired stand-ins. Only 
9,680 were left who "either lacked political 
Pull or seemed to want to join the Army and 
light" as Abe Lincoln recalled. 
These inequities were partly responsible for 
the New York riots. But there was also a 
driving force that was never fully identi-
fied. Carl Sandburg, in his biography of 
Lincoln, says: 
"The mobs were not driven in their work 
by blind wrath. Somebody had done some 
thinking, somebody had chosen a time when 
all the State guards the Governor could 
scrape together had gone to Gettysburg. The 
only organized force against the first riots 
was a police department of 1,500 members. 
With club and revolver they had fought 
night and day and their dead lay in scores, 
their wounded by the inendreds." 
The riots began on the very day Presi-
dent Lincoln issued a proclamation of 
thanksgiving for successes in the war. "It 
has pleased Almiglaty God to harken to the 
supplication and prayers of an afflicted peo-
ple," said the President, "and to vouchsafe 
to the Army and Navy victories on land and 
on the sea so signal and effective as to fur-
nish reasonable ground for augmented con-
fidence." 
As if on that signal the mobs gathered in 
in vacant lots, "with clubs, staves, cart rungs, 
pieces of iron, and moved as if by agree-
ment to a lot near Central Park." 
They attacked draft offices and police in-
stallations, killed and beat casual passers-
by. They burned and sacked the home of 
the mayor and postmaster. They burned 
ferry houses, drug and clothing stores, fac-
tories, saloons, churches, missions and or-
phanages. One gang drove police and armed 
guards from the State arsenal and seized 
weapons. 
But, as usually happens, criminals and 
organized gangs moved in and took over. 
The draft riots turned to simple looting and 
senseless destruction. 
President Lincoln prepared an appeal to 
the mobs, but withheld it when he realized it 
was too late to urge reason. Instead he 
scraped up what troops were available. The 
first contingents were forced to fire on riot-
ers, killing and wounding scores. To fright-
ened officials who demanded that Lincoln 
suspend the draft, the embattled President 
replied that the foundation of free govern-
ment was at stake and must be preserved at 
all cost. 
The riots were ended, although at the ter-
rific cost in lives estimated between 400 and 
2,000. The draft continued, the armies were 
filled out, and the Union was preserved. 
Long after, Lincoln's reasoned appeal that 
was not issued came to light. It is still one 
of the best explanations of why a nation in 
peril has to find the manpower it needs for 
the security of all the people. 
"There can be no army without men," said 
Mr. Lincoln. "Men can be had voluntarily 
or involuntarily. If you declare that men 
can still be had voluntarily in sufficient num-
bers, prove the assertion by yourselves volun-
teering in such numbers, and I shall gladly 
give up the draft. 
"Or if not a sufficient number, but any one 
of you will volunteer, and will thereby do 
only what each one of at least 1 million of 
his manly brethren have already done. Their 
toil and blood have been given as much for 
you as for themselves. Shall it be lost rather 
than that you, too, will bear your part?" 
It was written a hundred years ago but it 
could still apply to those who burn their 
draft cards before television cameras and 
publicly declare they will not fulfill their 
obligations as Americans even if their coun-
try is shamed by defeat. 
TRIBUTE TO GEORGE A. PARKER 
Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, George A. 
Parker, a lifelong Washington Repub-
lican worker and the only Negro member 
of the platform committee at last year's 
Republican Convention in San Francisco, 
died this past Wednesday of a cerebral 
hemorrhage. I knew and admired Mr. 
Parker, and he had my full support when 
he challenged the then Senator Gold-
water in the platform committee, on 
which I also served, on the issue of civil 
rights. 
I ask unanimous consent to have in-
serted in the RECORD a portion of a story 
concerning Mr. Parker which appeared 
in yesterday's Washington Post. 
There being no objection, the excerpt 
from the article was ordered to be 
printed in the RECORD, as follows: 
GOLDWATER CHALLENGER GEORGE A. PARKER 
DIES 
George A. Parker, lifelong Washington Re-
publican worker and founder of the old 
Robert H. Terrell Law School, died yester-
day at Freedmen's Hospital after a cerebral 
hemorrhage. He was 79. 
Mr. Parker achieved national prominence 
at the 1964 Republican National Conven-
tion in San Francisco when he openly chal-
lenged candidate Barry Goldwater about his 
New York. Draftees and friends asse_mbled stand on civil rights. The report is as follows: 
Approved For Release 2003/10/14: CIA-RDP671300446R000300140002-2 
Mr. Parker, the only Negro member of the 
platform committee, asked Goldwater, "How, 
if elected, could you use the power and 
prestige of the office to enforce the civil 
rights bill?" 
Goldwater said his honesty was being 
questioned and Mr. Parker replied, "I am 
not questioning your integrity. I am ques-
tioning your frankness." 
After the convention, Mr. Parker, who 
also had been a delegate to the 1944 and 
1948 Republican conventions, helped form 
a splinter movement away from Goldwater. 
He served as vice chairman of the District 
of Columbia Committee for Forward Look-
ing Republicans. He was also a member 
of the Republican State Central Committee 
and a director of the Lincoln Republican 
Club of the District of Columbia. 
Edward Burling, Jr., chairman of the 
Forward Looking Republicans, said last 
night: "He was always a leader. He was a 
man with vision and courage--a man of 
dignity and conviction?and with all, a lov-
able, gentle man. I was proud to call him 
friend. We all will mourn his passing, but 
we know Washington is a better place for 
his having lived here." 
Mr. Parker's son, Barrington D, Parker, 
who was also his law partner, said his 
father had remained a Republican at a time 
when many Negroes had drifted away from 
the party. 
His son said that Mr. Parker was proud of 
the mark that graduates of the Robert H. 
Terrell Law School had made in Washington 
life. The school was an evening training 
ground for Negro lawyers from 1931 to 1951. 
Among graduates of the school are Gen-
eral Sessions Court Judge Austin L. Pickling, 
District of Columbia Commissioner John B. 
Duncan, and Recorder of Deeds Peter Ridley. 
Mn. Parker was a graduate of the old M 
Street High School, now Dunbar. He re-
ceived a bachelor of divinity and a bachelor's 
degree in law from Howard University. While 
in school he worked as a mail carrier for the 
old Georgetown Post Office. He opened his 
first law office on M Street in Georgetown 
near Key Bridge. 
Mr. Parker practiced law until his death. 
He was for a time the assistant minister 
of the 19th Street Baptist Church. 
Mr. Parker was a former national presi-
dent of the Howard University Alumni As-
sociation, former national president of the 
Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, former president 
of the Washington Bar Assodlation and 
former president of the Federation of Parent 
Teachers Associations of District of Colum-
bia. 
He is survived by his wife, Emma A., of 
the home address at 1504 Varnum Street NW.; 
two sons, Barrington D. of 4919 16th Street 
NW. and Sherman E. of Louisville, Ky.; a 
daughter, Mrs. George Thomas, 4604 Kane 
place NE., two brothers, William, of Kansas 
City, Kans., and John C., of 4616 Clay Street 
NE.; two grandsons and an aunt, Maggie 
Iverson of 1226 0 Street NE. 
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MINORITY

on the activities of the Congress for the 
past year, and I ask unanimous consent 
that this be placed in the body of the 
RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks 
and the customary number of copies be

can military commandant of northern 
California; Leland Stanford, Governor, 
Senator and founder of Stanford Uni-
versity; Senator George Hearst, finan-
cier, publisher, and father of William 
Randolph Hearst; Senator James G. 
Fair and Judge John A. Stanly were 
proud producers of California wines. 
With the completion of the first trans-
continental railroad in 1869, California 
wines were shipped throughout the 
United States, and shortly thereafter 
were being exported. Before the turn 
of the century, California wines were 
winning awards in international compe-
titions in this country and Europe. 
By the beginning of World War I, 
grapes and wine in California were val-
ued at $150 million. There were 330,000 
acres of vineyards representing a land 
value of $66 million. The war, 14 years 
of prohibition, and World War II first 
cut back the industry, then limited 
growth, but wine production now is 
larger and growing faster than ever. 
The California grape and wine indus-
try represents an investment of more 
than $700 million. It has a peak em-
ployment each year of more than 110,000 
persons, and is currently paying more 
than $75 million in excise taxes at the 
Federal and State levels. 
California's half-million acres of vine-
yards produce an annual return to farm-
ers of approximately $177 million. An 
average of more than 180 million gal-
lons of wine is produced by more than 
230 bonded wineries and wine cellars. 
Approximately 80 percent of American 
wine is made in California. 
The wines of California are grown in 
nine districts, four of which surround 
San Francisco, wine capital of America. 
They are the Sonoma-Mendocino, Napa 
Valley-Solano, Livermore Valley-Ala-
meda and Santa Clara-San Benito dis-
tricts. These relatively cool parts of the 
San Francisco Bay area are noted for 
red and white dinner wines and spark-
ling wines. 
Just south of Santa Clara is the Santa 
Cruz-Monterey wine district. To the 
east, the Lodi district is the beginning 
of the central valley area which pro-
duces particularly fine dessert arid ap-
petizer wines. Below Lodi are the 
Modesto-Ripon-Escalon and Fresno-San 
Joaquin-Kern districts. Farthest south 
Is the Cucamonga District, in a volley 
just east of Los Angeles. New grapes and 
techniques make it possible for vintners 
In these warmer areas to produce qual-
ity dinner wines in addition to their fa-
mous sweet wines and brandies. 
More and more Americans are learn-
ing the pleasures of these wines of which 
California vintners have been so proud 
for eight generations?wines that have 
proven their quality in comparative 
tastings against more expensive foreign 
counterparts. 
Win President, the California wine in-
dustry can indeed look ahead to a bright 
future as the citizens across our Nation 
and our friends in foreign countries more 
and more discover the quality of wine 
produced in the Golden State. Califor-
nia's wine is unexcelled anywhere. So

PRIME MINISTER KY OF VIETNAM 
Mr. DODD. Mr. President, when Air 
Vice Marshal Nguyen Can Ky took over 
as Prime Minister of Vietnam earlier this 
year, there were many who expressed 
grave doubts about the ability of this 
dashing young soldier to convert himself 
Into the statesman-leader which Vietnam 
so desperately needs in this hour of 
crisis. No one doubted his intelligence 
and dedication or his courage. Their 
doubts were, rather, founded on his 
youth, his lack of political experience, 
and the fact that he was a military man 
rather than a civilian. 
I therefore think it important to note 
that many of those on the spot who were 
skeptical about Ky as Prime Minister, 
are now beginning to have second 
thoughts and that some of them even 
concede the possibility that Ky may be 
the revolutionary leader the South Viet-
namese people have been looking for. 
On October 1, 1965, Prime Minister Ky 
made a remarkable speech, which in my 
opinion did not receive anything like the 
attention it merited. 
I would like to quote a few paragraphs 
from this speech to my colleagues: 
After reviewing the situation I now present 
our policies for waging the revolutionary 
struggle and for building peace. 
We must ask ourselves, what the real 
character of the peace is which we are fight-
ing to achieve, what kind of a society we 
must build. We must have a clear concep-
tion of the future of our country and not 
merely worry about the coming hundred 
days. We have to think about the thousand 
days ahead. 
During the next 1,000 days this land will 
have to be completely controlled by free men. 
We want to decide everything ourselves, to 
have friendly relations with neighboring 
countries to live peacefully in the country 
which we have inherited from our fathers, in 
a nation where there is justice, on a land 
which is governed by men of integrity whose 
only ambition is to serve the people honestly 
and efficiently. 
The revolution which we are determined to 
carry out is a social revolution. Therefore 
in the next 1,000 days we have to create a big 
change in every field of activity of the peo-
ple. We have to create a new life in the 
countryside, a new life in the cities, a promis-
ing new life. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert into the RECORD at the con-
clusion of my remarks the complete text 
of Prime Minister Ky's speech of October 
1, 1965. 
There being no objection, the speech 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
SPEECH By ATR VICE MARSHAL NGUYEN CAO 
KY, PRIME MINISTER OF THE REPUBLIC OF 
VIETNAM 
My fellow Vietnamese, my comrades in 
arms, the June 14, 1965, declaration of the 
armed forces clearly stated the reasons why 
the armed forces had to accept once again, 
the responsibility of leading the nation. 
"Together," the declaration said, "we will 
renovate this society and build a new Viet-
nam. Together, we will lead the people to-
27367 
ward progress in all fields to keep the pace 
with the progress of mankind. We have the 
duty of bequeathing to the future genera-
tions glorious pages of history and solid 
constitution, based on freedom, justice, and 
brotherhood love." 
Today, Tohnivrr, on the occasion of our 
3-month leadership tenure, with the agree-
ment of the directory, as the commissioner 
in charge of the executive, I present to our 
fellow Vietnamese and comrades in arms 
a report on the general policy of the govern-
ment concerning the current problems fac-
ing our nation. 
My fellow Vietnamese, my comrades in 
arms, on November 1, 1963, the armed forces 
of the Republic of Vietnam overthrew the 
Ngo Dinh Diem regime, starting a revolution 
which the people entire have been longing 
for. The collapse of the Ngo dinh Diem Re-
gime, was the inevitable consequence of the 
long treason of a regime deeply engaged in the 
path of dictatorship, corruption and bru-
tality. The armed forces could not tolerate 
the Diem regime the more so because this 
regime was deliberately using while already 
on the decline, the armed forces as a tool 
not to protect national freedom and inde-
pendence against foreign invasion but only 
to suppress the people's Just aspirations. 
The revolution sparkled on November 1, 
1963, was a spontaneous revolution. This 
revolution was ignited not by any individual 
or group or representatives of any polit-
ical doctrine, social class or economic force, 
but was a revolution of the people of which 
the armed forces are the vanguard elements. 
The whole people rose up to start the 
revolution, in order to oust a reactionary 
regime, in the hope of building a new regime 
capable of preserving and developing the in-
nate rights of human being, the rights to 
live to be free and to enjoy happiness. These 
rights are the very force that motivated the 
November 1, 1963, revolution and drove the 
Vietnamese people to fight against the Com-
munist aggressors. 
Because the November 1, 1963, revolution 
was a self-sparking one. It had the advan-
tage of tolerating no other dictatorial trend 
to thrive and inherit the Ngo Dinh Diem 
regime. It neither tolerated the opportunist 
elements, who were self-styled "revolution-
ists" and wanted to usurp high-ranking po-
sitions in the government to only enjoy priv-
ileges. It is also because the November 1, 
1963, revolution was a self-sparking one, that 
it entailed bad consequence, that was the 
creation of a state of laxity quickly turned 
into a state of confusion interfering in ail 
branches of national activities. Those who 
were in power in the wake of the revolution 
could not live up to their responsibilities. 
What is worse, most of them dared not as-
sume responsibilities because of the moral 
handicap resulting from their "close connec-
tions with the ousted regime" instead of 
guiding the mass towards order to help sta-
bilize the situation, they indulged in 
demagogy and promptly surrendered to pres-
sure from the masses. 
The result was that not only the dictator 
was overthrown along with the elimina-
tion of all of his close assistants, but the 
entire administrative machinery from the 
central government down to the regional ad-
ministration was shaken and a number of 
agencies dislocated. Even the armed 
forces?an organization bound by the strong-
est discipline?would have been dislocated 
had the general officers commanding the 
different armed services, corps and large 
units not shown a strong will or made ex-
traordinary efforts to preserve its integrity. 
In the ensuing protracted disorder, the 
subsequent governments were overthrown by 
the people although some of these gov-
ernments were headed by statesmen with 
goodwill and who enjoyed the confidence of 
people from one group or another.

27368 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE October 22, 1965 
In the face of this internal situation of 
the Republic of Vietnam, how the Red im-
perialists and their lackeys in Hanoi re-
garded us? What maneuvers did they carry 
out in an attempt to conquer this free land? 
My fellow Vietnamese, comrades in arms, 
be calm while I tell you the assessments 
made by the lackeys of the Red imperialism 
In Hanoi on our situation and their maneu-
vers to exploit this situation. 
In his report made early this year of the 
situation in the south, Nguyen Van Vinh, an 
honorary brigadier general of the North Viet-
namese armed forces, who holds the func-
tions of the chairman of a committee in 
charge of the aggression against the south, 
assessed our military and political situations 
as follows; 
About the military situation, Nguyen Van 
Vinh reported that our rear "shrunk in 
proportion with the dislocation of thou-
sands of strategic hamlets and outposts"; 
our military strength became "more and 
more Insufficient, the morale of our troops 
but at the same time we had to use about 
45 percent of our regular troops to defend 
Saigon and Chalon"; our strategic reserve 
forces are "almost insignificant" and for this 
reason their defensive as well as offensive 
potentials are hardly used. In his contlu-
sion, the chairman of the Aggressive Com-
mittee Against the South affirmed that (I 
quote his words) : "Decidedly unavoidably 
there will be a wretched collapse of the 
morale and of the organization of the South 
Vietnamese armed forces when the striking 
force of our troops (Communist aggressors) 
becomes more aggressive." 
About our political situation, the chair-
man of the Aggressive Committee reported 
that the November 1, 1963 revolution was 
but a "trick" and, "internal conflicts in the 
south are spreading fast and developing 
in a very Intricate way." The report reads' 
"In the political field, the tricky democratic 
revolution of the enemy (the North Viet-
namese Communists consider our entire 
armed forces and people as their enemy) after 
the overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem had to end 
briefly after the replacement of Minh by 
Khanh. Faced with our fighting strength 
and their own internal conflicts, several 
coups d'etat succeeded. This situation re-
flects Itself in the division of the various 
groups in the south into indifferent and 
most extremist groups. The latter group is 
represented by the young generals. Fur-
thermore this situation also showed disac-
Cord in questions about personal interests 
and positions, about parties, religions, -Bud-
dhism, Catholicism, about regions of the 
country, the north, the center and the south 
and about personal hatred. 
With such an assessment of our situation 
it is obvious that the Red imperialists and 
their lackeys in Hanoi had to order the Viet-
cong in the south to strive to exploit this 
situation. In fact, during the past,2 years 
and till now, the Red imperialists have been 
sending troops from the north into the south 
to help the Vietcong to move from guerrilla 
warfare to mobile warfare in order to carry 
out large scale attacks. The Communist im-
perialists had been and are striving to make 
use of all wicked maneuvers to sow dissen-
sion among us and to aggravate this dis-
sension. 
Along with military offensive waves, and 
political upaettings, the Communist im-
perialists also conducted severe sabotage 
against our economy. They ordered their 
henchmen to destroy bridges, cut off roads, 
and lay mines to prevent the transport of 
supplies from the cities to rural areas, and 
to strive to grab agricultural products from 
the tillers, arid from farmers and fishermen 
money derived from the sales of fowl and 
fish. The ultimate aim of the Communist 
imperialists was to use every means to lift 
the price of rice in Saigon in the middle of 
this year from VN$700 to VN$5,000 a quintal, 
to make the cost of living in the cities to soar 
fivefold, even tenfold. They hoped that 
With the soar of the living cost, the anger 
of the people, especially of the poor, at the 
government would increase drastically, thus 
leading the society to the awful disintegrat-
ing state such as they have always longed 
for. 
Simultaneously with their offensive waves 
against the Republic of Vietnam in the mili-
tary, political, and economic fields inside our 
national territory, the Communist imperial-
ists also attacked us on the international 
scene through the propaganda. Propaganda 
machineries from 81 Communist Parties 
throughout the world, along with thousands 
of their agencies, doubled their venomous 
efforts with the hope of severing the Re-
public of Vietnam from its allies, and mis-
representing our struggle for the safeguard 
of freedom and national independence. Their 
propaganda offensive on the international 
scene against the Republic of Vietnam has 
achieved a certain influence in a small num-
ber of countries which are :under the pres-
sure of Communist imperialists, but this 
Communist offensive, war indeed also, a pow-
erful stimulation for the civilized world, 
which help us, to be more determined than 
ever to assist our country. 
Facing the danger that is the Republic of 
Vietnam could be engulfed by the Comm-u-
tast imperialists' aggressive machinery, all 
the friendly countries together increased 
their aid for us, both morally and materially. 
At the request of the Republic of Vietnam, 
the Governments of the United States, the 
Republic of Korea, Australia, and New Zea-
land have sent their military units to help 
us, following a legitimate self-defense plan, 
and very moderately. 
Facing the danger that is the Republic of 
Vietnam could be engulfed by the Commu-
nist imperialisms aggressive machinery, all 
the friendly countries together increased 
their aid for us, both morally and materially, 
At the request of the Republic of Vietnam, 
the Governments of the United States, the 
Republic of Korea, Australia, and New Zea-
land have sent their military units to help 
us. Following a legitimate self-defense 
plan, and very moderately, the Vietnam Air 
Force and the U.S. Air Force have success-
fully bombed enemy military bases, staging 
areas, army barracks and supply depots in 
North Vietnam. 
Until the middle of this year, the presence 
of military units from friendly countries, 
along with the bombing of a number of mili-
tary bases and logistical means of the Com-
munists on both sides of the demarcation 
line, have not helped us to drive off the Red 
Imperialists' aggression yet. The strikes, 
however, prevented the Communists?despite 
the large troops from the north equipped 
with great firepower?from changing the bal-
ance of forces. 
Since last June, the situation would have 
been more consolidated if the Republic of 
Vietnam had not, once again, met with in-
ternal difficulties. On June 11, politicians, 
temporarily in charge of administering na-
tional institutions, were unable to find ap-
propriate measures to solve their differences. 
So, they handed their powers to the armed 
forces. In accepting these responsibilities, 
the armed forces clearly defined the reasons 
and objectives of the military government 
which were the organization of the struggle 
against the Communist aggression until final 
victory and the implementation of a social 
revolution. 
A provisional convention, establishing 
basic structures for the national organiza-
tion, was promulgated by the national lead-
ership committee. 
Entrusted with the task of organizing the 
administrative machinery and implementing 
the policy of the NIC, the Government im-
mediately at the setting up of the war cabi-
net, announced program including 26 points 
an urgent tasks covering all fields: War and 
politics, economy and finance, social welfare, 
education and culture, foreign affairs. 
The war and revolutionary policies of the 
national leadership committee and the pro-
gram of the Government are basically cor-
rect. That is why they brought forth a great 
enthusiasm among the entire population. 
During the past 100 clays, the implementa-
tion of the policy and the implementation 
of the program have progressed and recorded 
a number of tangible results. 
In the military domain, we have warded 
off the Vietcong monsoon offensive; in sim-
pler words, we have smashed all offensive at-
tempts which the Vietcong had carefully pre-
pared long in advance, with the hope of 
launching them on their commemorative 
days in August and September. 
The Vietcong, hidden in their most solid 
dens from Ba Long in Quang T'ri Province, 
through the zone "la," to the Duoc Forest in 
Ca Mau, have throughly been swept out by 
our forces. Meantime, nearly 2 Communist 
battalions, mostly infiltrated from the north, 
and lying near Chu Lai In Quang Tin Prov-
ince left behind over GOO bodies following 
attacks by units of the Vietnamese and U.S. 
forces. 
That week, the Communist invasion troops 
Moqukuri A divisioned force for a new at-
tack in Binh Dinh Province with the hope 
of rebuilding their pressure in the region. 
However, the Government forces, with the 
courageous cooperation of local population, 
launched an operation that killed 1,350 of 
them 
With the gallant cooperation of navy, 
army, air, artillery and engineer units of the 
United States, Republic of Korea, Australia 
and New Zealand, not only have we-preserved 
all important bases along the coast of central 
Vietnam, extended government-controlled 
areas, guarded our frontier-defense network 
within which Duc Co is is an isolated out-
post; not only we launch many attacks to 
destroy the enemy strongholds, and retake 
initiative in every battlefront, we also cleared 
many strategic communication axes which 
were closed for many years. All these de-
cisive victories emphasize the outstanding 
efforts of the armed forces and have turned 
the tide of the war in a very short time. 
What is this driving power that has enabled 
us to score such lightning military feats? 
My dear fellow countrymen and comrades 
in arms, it is the new incentive of the revolu-
tion spirit which is burning in the hearts of 
our people and our armed forces, which are 
backed by the entire free world. 
In the economic and financial fields, a 
number of measures have been carried out in 
the framework of an urgent action program. 
These measures aimed at laying foundations 
for real social revolution which includes: 
The elimination of dishonest businessmen. 
The stabilization of market prices. 
The supply of food goods from rural areas 
to the cities and vice versa, so as to supply 
the vilagers with first necessity goods in 
their daily life. 
The setting up of security stocks to pre-
vent shortage of foodstuffs. 
The establishment of agencies responsible 
for the purchase, storage and distribution of 
rice. --
The implementation of the housing policy, 
to improve the housing situation of the 
needy. 
The construction of 1,000 low-cost houses, 
each house coating $20,000 and to be dis-
tributed to the working class. The purchase 
of vacant plots of land to resell them to the 
needy people who will themselves build their 
houses, after providing such basic struc-
tures as roads, sewers, water and electricity. 
The promulgation of the right to stay and 
priority to purchase house and land. The 
import of 100 cars, 200 trilarabrettas, other 
kinds of vehicles and spare parts for taxicabs

propriate means for the exercise of their pro-
fession. The interruption of export of some 
products necessary for consumption needs 
of the population at home. The improve-
ment of education, by building more schools, 
and abolishing noon shifts at primary schools 
to protect the pupils health. The improve-
ment of wage status by increasing the salary 
of low-income entloyees, including the 
troops, and reducing that of a number of 
other government employees, with the view 
of mitigating somehow the differences among 
peoples of various social strata. The setting 
up of military dependent quarters, etc. 
Concerning the promulgating of a new 
customs tariff, the government aims at levy-
ing heavy taxes on luxury goods to increase 
the national income, thus enabling the gov-
ernment to carry out social welfare pro-
grams to help the poor, and at the same time 
avoiding all shortages of goods for other 
classes having great consumption abilities. 
Along with the above-mentioned objective, 
the life of the rural population also receive 
particular attention from the government 
which has decided to: 
Much forward the improvement of living 
standards in rural areas. 
Modify the status of farmers associations. 
Improve the land policy by amending the 
agrarian reform decree-law aiming at assist-
ing farmers and making tillers owners of 
their lands. 
Grant full ownership to the farmers im-
mediately after the distribution of land plots 
Instead of provisional certificates as previ-
ously. 
Besides, farmers are exempted from land 
taxes during whole period they have to pay 
for the purchase of their ricefield?within 
a maximum period of 12 years?and at the 
same time, authorized to postpone the pay-
ment of their first installment for 1 year. 
More than that, public lands and riceflelds 
will be from now, on distributed directly to 
farmers instead of renting them on bid as 
previously. 
Eticefields, bought from French proprie-
tors according to the September 10, 1958, 
totaling about 224,647 hectares, and scat-
terings in 27 provinces, will be sold to farm-
ers on the same basis. 
Other intellectuals and experts and even 
some statesmen?either those who had 
learned bitter experiences in the political 
arena or those who had long waited for ?c-
ams to cooperate with the Government?
have given signs of impatience. The atti-
tude of these intellectuals, experts, and 
statesmen has more or less influenced the 
mass that had, in the past, recourse to pres-
sure. 
I deem it necessary to tell to the entire 
people and my comrades in arms that the 
National Leadership Committee, although 
being busy with many problems, has always 
paid appropriate attention to all diverging 
views, either moderate or violent. I also 
deem It necessary to make it clear once again 
that state affairs are not the monopoly of 
any individual or group and that the destiny 
of the nation needs the moral and material 
contribution of all people actively engaged 
in the struggle and constructive works. 
In brief, the general situation has been 
greatly improved. Three months ago, while 
accepting the power we had said we en-
visaged a new dawn for the people, we, at 
that time, only expressed a feeling. Now, 
In reviewing the obstacles we have sur-
mounted, certainly our compatriots and 
comrades-in-arms agree with us that this 
brighter dawn for our people is not a mere 
utopia but a reality awaiting us. All the 
past difficulties are not liquidated, and more 
serious new ones may appear because the 
nearer it is approaching final defeat, the 
more , dangerous the enemy prove to be. 
However, we are confident that our com-
patriots, military and civilian, have all the 
necessary energy and determination to over-
come these difficulties and, will be able to 
conduct step by step, our people toward this 
dawn. 
In the land reforms policy, the legalization 
of the ownership rights on the lands put 
under cultivation and the distribution of 
ownership certificates to the peasants in ac-
cordance with the policy of making the lab-
orers the owners of the lands they till, have 
been achieved. The above certificates have 
been distributed for the first time in Lac 
Nghiep (Tuyen Due) on September 18, 1965, 
to 349 families of lowland and Montagnaxd 
peasants and in Dau Bong (Tay Nih) to 200 
other families. Other certificates will be dis-
tributed in the future. 
It is worth recalling that the land reform 
policy is being extended to all ethnic minori-
ties living on the national territory and 
there is no discrimination between the low-
land people and the tribesmen. To promul-
gate many measures and implement a policy 
based on justice, and reason, and aimed at 
achieving the objective of national union 
and collective social progress. 
All the aforesaid measures and decisions 
certainly are not routine administrative ones. 
Furthermore, they will not be demagogy 
measures. 
The fact that the war cabinet has decided 
to take social revolution as the motto of the 
struggle, and has realized that the people 
in both urban and rural areas have equal 
responsibilities and are entitled to equal 
privileges, proves that the above-mentioned 
decisions and measures are constant with the 
overall national policy. 
Of course, we need time to assess the re-
sults of these measures and to see whether 
they will be useful to the social revolution 
which constitutes the very objective of our 
struggle. 
Nevertheless, if we commonly realize that 
these are things that should be done, to lay 
lasting foundations to the social revolution, 
we must first be animated with confidence 
and faith. 
In the political field, the implementation 
of our action program has yielded clear re-
sults in the rural areas. In many western 
provinces in the southern area, the working 
_people now can easily move from an area to 
another even in nighttime. In I corps area 
provinces, people who, a year ago were forced 
by the Vietcong terrorism and oppression to 
abandon all their properties and move else-
where for security, are now actively planning 
a back-home movement to liberate their own 
villages from the Vietcong and rebuild them. 
The "return to village" campaign instigated 
by the anti-Communist refugees in Quang 
Ngai gathered has about 400 cadres and 
fighters in the first format/on stage and has 
begun action since late August, in other 
areas, especially in the valley of the Mekong, 
the people are nurturing the same aspiration 
and are ready to launch similar campaigns. 
All told, the results in the political field 
are still of a limited scale because of the 
too cautious and unbalanced way of imple-
menting the program. The major institu-
tions planned in the provisional charter such 
as the economic and social councils, and the 
high magistrate council, have not been set 
up yet. This has caused a number of intel-
lectuals in the cities to conceive deep con-
cern and the suspicion that the Armed 
Forces wanted to establish a military dicta-
torship. Another segment of people may 
have have been induced to think that the 
military administration contented itself with 
trumpeting over revolution without seeking 
to materialize it or with realizing it only in 
part. 
After reviewing the situation I now present 
our policies for waging the revolutionary 
struggle and for building peace. 
We must ask ourselves what the real 
character of the peace is which we are fight-
ing to achieve, what kind of a society we 
must build. We must have a clear concep-
27369 
tion .of the future of our country and not 
merely worry about the coming 100 days. We 
have to think about the 1,000 days ahead. 
During the next 1,000 days this land will 
have to be completely controlled by freemen. 
We Want to decide everything ourselves, to 
have friendly relations with neighboring 
countries, to live peacefully in the country 
which we have inherited from our fathers, in 
a nation where there is justice, on a land 
which is governed by men of integrity whose 
only ambition is to serve the people honestly 
and efficiently. 
The revolution which we are determined 
to carry out is a social revolution. Therefore 
in the next 1,000 days we have to create a big 
change in every field of activity of the peo-
ple. We have to create a new life in the 
countryside, a new life in the cities, a prom-
ising now life. 
Many multistoried buildings have been 
built not only in the capital, but also in 
Can Tho, Nha Trang, Da Nang, and are be-
ing built in many other cities. In the capi-
tal, Le Loi Boulevard is filled with cars. But 
not far from the big buildings, there are still 
many slums, there are still thousands of 
homes where parents and children are 
crowded into a dark and damp area of barely 
10 square meters. And further away, outside 
the cities, there are tens of thousands of 
families who all year long labor in the black 
mud and yet have as their only shelter a 
rundown hut to protect them from rain and 
sun. They do not have enough to eat, they 
have no decent clothing and neither doctor 
nor medicines when they are sick. On top of 
all that, these people are afraid of arrogant 
officials on our side and also of the Commu-
nist enemy. 
We have the duty not to allow the children 
who are today without clothes, who are to-
day illiterate, to grow up and continue to 
live for ever a dark life, in misery, in op-
pression, in injustice. That is why, within 
the greater framework of the social revolu-
tion, we have to start first with the realiza-
tion of the living standard revolution. 
Unlike the Communists whose policy is to 
bring all those having unequal living stand-
ards down to the lowest level, we are striv-
ing to carry out a social revolution which 
never stops aiming at raising the living 
standard of all the people, starting with the 
poorest. Looking at reality, even if we ac-
cept as the standard wage the minimum 
guaranteed salary of the worker recently 
fixed by the war cabinet at 1,070 piasters per 
month for areas where the cost of living is 
lowest, there are still millions of people liv-
ing under that standard. These are the 
peasants who do not have enough land to 
till and would not have enough to eat if 
they sold part of their produce to buy clothes 
or medicine. These are also the ambulant 
merchants on the pavements of the cities and 
towns. 
It was within the framework of the living 
standard revolution that the war cabinet 
based the pay and family allowances of the 
soldiers. We are reviewing the pay scale of 
all those who are serving in other branches 
of activities. We have yet to review the 
price of farm products. We also have to ade-
quately provide for the housing, health, and 
educational needs of all, especially those 
living in the cities. In short, if we begin to 
carry out the living standard revolution to-
day, with concrete projects and step-by-step 
preparation, 1,000 days from today, we shall 
certainly be able to create a big change for 
the better on this land. 
That is why I believe that every 100 days 
we have to make up a list of realizations in 
which we shall not only enumerate what we 
have done, but above all we must review our 
achievements, and even more important, we 
shall have to review what we have not done 
and do it at all costs. 
As of today, I put emphasis on the govern-
mental activities aiming at fighting corrup-

tion and at reviving the good Vietnamese 
traditions of government based on moral 
foundations, in respect of the law and jus-
tice. First of all, in the coming 100 days I 
shall personally look for people whose expe-
riences and integrity are beyond reproach to 
for a central corps of inspectors in charge of 
investigating all complaints on injustices as 
to help the government take timely correc-
tive measures. I solemnly promise that, as 
of today, those who are responsible for serv-
ing the people will have to pay for their 
crimes if they commit the crime of betraying 
the confidence of the people. For a long 
ti:me, on this land, the honest little man has 
been oppressed by those detaining authority. 
A Nation cannot exist if there is no justice 
for everyone. 
For a long time, no consideration has been 
given to the aspiration of the peasants who 
make up the backbone of the country. (Our 
peasants have always lived in insecurity be-
cause they have been exploited, terrorized. 
Our peasants have to live utter misery be-
cause they are the first victims of the utterly 
unequal distribution of wealth, of profiteer-
ing, and of inflation. The peasants lack all 
the basic necessities of a worthy life. The 
war has disturbed their peaceful life, and 
their labor has not been adequately rewarded. 
The war and-its instigators?the Vietcong?
have upset the moral norms, have destroyed 
the law and justice. Many people in the 
countryside have lost faith in the Govern-
ment and lost faith in themselves. I pre-
scribe that this Government has the respon-
sibility to regain the people's confidence and 
support. 
As I have made clear earlier, at present the 
armed forces, with the limitless assistance of 
friendly countries, have realized important 
changes in the military field. We are de-
stroying the aggressive machinery of the 
Communists on this and the other side of 
the parallel. Continuing to take advantage 
of these successes, we shall completely de-
stroy the entire apparatus of aggression of 
the Communists. Victory is on our side. 
Militarily, we shall certainly have victory in 
a not distant future. 
But it is not enough to militarily defeat 
the Communists. We must do so that on 
this land the Communists do not have any 
reason to be among the people, especially 
among the people of the countryside. This 
is the task of pacification and rural recon-
struction. Emphasizing the importance of 
this task in a very short sentence; The coun-
tryside is the decisive factor in the entire 
battlefield. Consequently I mobilize all the 
existing cadres to serve in the pacification 
and rural reconstruction programs. These 
cadres will go to the countryside and to-
gether with the peasants they will fight to 
defend the villages, they will help the peas-
ants to till the land and increase produc-
tion, improve agricultural techniques, raise 
the living standard of the peasant in every 
way. They will help the peasants to reor-
ganize the village administration, to realize 
a democratic way of life at the village level 
and lay the solid foundations for a free and 
democratic regime in the future, The paci-
fication and rural reconstruction not only 
require many facilities and many cadres, it 
also demands that those cadres have deter-
mination and ability. I truthfully say that 
in the existing administration there are not 
yet such cadres in sufficient numbers. That 
its why I earnestly hope that all the fighters 
in all the patriotic movements who are rich 
In experience will actively participate in this 
big and meaningful task. Pacification and 
rural reconstruction which bring a new or-
ganized life to 80 percent of our people, 
should in my opinion be the responsibility of 
all of you, the revolutionary fighters. And 
now you have the favorable conditions, the 
facilities that are more abundant than ever 
before, to successfully carry out this respon-
sibility. 
Meanwhile, the government has in mind 
another program of another kind, a program 
aiming to restore the citizenship to those 
who took the wrong direction, considering 
their own self more important than the na-
tion. I will give them a certain time so they 
can get aid of the responsibility which they 
realize is not worthwhile. After self-criti-
cism, they will be employed according to their 
capacity. 
As before I used to say, we, Vietnamese 
people, tend to forgive. Let us forgive those 
who went the wrong way, give them the op-
portunity to become new human- beings. On 
the contrary, to those who do not admit this 
opportunity, I pity them, because to me, they 
are mentally deranged by birth, but forming 
obstacles to the development of the nation. 
During my visits to rural areas, it was 
heart rending to see that my compatriots 
there became victims of the increasing cost 
of living and were suffering from being in 
short of the the first necessities. If this situ-
ation was created by goods hoarders, the gov-
ernment will bring the convicts before the 
court which surely will punish them severely. 
Besides, the shortage of goods will undoubt-
edly be solved satisfactorily, thanks to the 
government efforts and the timely assistance 
of friendly countries. 
The Government will find out efficient 
means to stabilize the market prices, the 
most important of them is the method of 
uniting producers and consumers into rela-
tionships benefiting to both of them. In the 
transportation field, the Government is al-
ways ready to provide necessary means, and 
if this still cannot meet the needs, it will 
request assistance from allied countries at 
the proper time. In brief, all necessary steps 
for the normalization of supplies so that 
people throughout the country could buy 
goods and materials at a reasonable price, 
have always been a great concern for the 
Government. 
Finally, we must affirm once again the 
struggle of people against the Communist 
aggressors. My dear compatriots and com-
rades-in-arms are certainly aware that if this 
country falls under the Communist yoke, our 
nation would be annihilated. The Vietcong,. 
like any other Communist groups, are acting 
on the international Communist organiza-
tion's orders which, is, in fact, the most fear-
ful imperialism of human history. 
Communist imperialism disseminates a 
doctrine using hatred as driving power which 
creates dissension inside a government as 
well as inside every family. The most im-
portant aspect of communism is that it is 
antinatural and atheist. 
That is why I appeal to my compatriots 
from all faiths to unite closely and, along 
with the whole people and Armed Forces, 
fight against that foreign sophism which 
destroy the family and exterminate the na-
tion at the same time with the most sacred 
confidence of our people. 
The sooner the entire population is united, 
the sooner we restore peace in this land, and 
the more closely we unite, the stronger our 
national force will be. 
United, We will create a lasting bulwark 
Insuring justice for the society, freedom for 
the people, and democracy throughout the 
country. 
My best regards to you all my dear com-
patriots and comrades-in-arms.

SANDY KOUFAX?AN EXAMPLE FOR 
THE YOUTH OF AMERICA ? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, a 
friend of the Presiding Officer and my-
self, Red Welsh, of Billings, Mont., re-
cently made an interesting commentary 
on radio station KOOK in that city. I 
was so much impressed by it, I should 
like to read it to the Senate. It is 'Very 
short. I ask unanimous consent that I 
May have 1 additional minute to do so. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. The title is, "An 
Example for the Youth of America." 
The commentary is as follows: 
The-recently completed world series pro-
duced an outstanding example of what com-
petitive sports is supposed to represent?un-
fortunately the incident seems to have es-
caped many of those who profess undying 
faith in athletics as a character-building 
program. 
The hottest man in professional athletics 
today is Los Angeles Dodger southpaw, Sandy 
Koufax. He might well be the greatest 
pitcher who ever lived. 
Koufax and his teammate, big Don Drys-
dale, literally pitched the Dodgers into the 
National League championship. 
Along the way, this exceptionally talented 
young man pitched a perfect game?only the 
third time this has ever been done in the long 
history of professional baseball. 
Heading into the annual classic?the 
world's series?Koufax admittedly was the 
greatest of the great. Every boy in America 
knew who he was. With Sandy scheduled to 
pitch the opener, Los Angeles was an odds-on 
favorite. 
Opening day of this year's classic coin-
cided with the most solemn holiday ob-
served in Judaism?Yom Kippur, the day of 
atonement. 
Sandy Koufax is an American of Jewish 
faith. When the umpire yelled, "play ball." 
Koufax wasn't pitching for Los Angeles. Ile 
Wasn't at the ball park. He wasn't even 
watching the game on television. 
Sandy Koufax was where he should have 
been?at the synagogue, quietly observing 
Yom Kippur in meditation and prayer. 
There was an example for the youth of 
this country. A great athlete, an American 
idol, putting first things first. 
In the faith of his fathers?he was a 
believer. 
By the standards of his country?he was a 
real citizen. 
On the yardstick of genuineness?he 
measured up all man.

ard Langham Riedel, who has so faith-
fully served the Senate for a great many 
years as press liaison.

also took occasion to send a letter com-

Riedel. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
President's letter be printed in the REC-

There being no objection, the letter 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,

MY. RICHARD LANGHAM RIEDEL,

Centreville, Va. 
DEAR RICHARD: I hear you are about to be-
gin a new life. Yet, I can't imagine what 
the Senate will be like without you. 
You have served so long and so faith-
fully that for me?and for so many of your 
friends?you seemed as much a part of the 
Senate as its marbled halls. 
I well recall the many times when, as ma-
jority leader, I could not leave the floor, and 
you relayed questions and answers for re-
porters. You always served honestly and 
with good commonsense. 
In a historic setting?that of the U.S. 
Senate?you wrote a history of your own. 
I believe that my good friend Gould Lincoln 
is the only member of the Senate Press Gal-
lery who was a member when you came to 
the Senate in 1918. 
You can be proud of having served as liai-
son between the press and the Senators 
longer than any other person in the history 
of the U.S. Senate. 
Good luck in your new life, and in all 
your undertakings. When you go camping 
in the wilderness, don't forget to come back. 
Meanwhile, your friends will remember 
you. 
Sin rely, 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON. 
LETTER FROM LINDA SAMPLES TO 
AMERICAN SERVICEMEN IN VIET-
NAM 
Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, the 
Cleveland Press received this week a let-
ter from Linda Samples, age 16, of 
Brunswick Center, Ohio; Medina County. 
Brunswick Center is a rustic com-
munity about 25 miles from Cleveland. 
Enclosed within her letter was another 
letter addressed to "American Service-
men in Vietnam." In the letter was also 
enclosed 50 cents. 
Miss Samples requested that her let-
ter to the servicemen be sent to them in-
asmuch as she did not know how to do 
this. She explained that the 50 cents 
was to cover postage costs. 
Her letter is extraordinary. It comes 
at a time of disturbing protests by some 
Americans against U.S. policy in Viet-
nam. 
The Cleveland Press reproduced her 
letter on page 1 on Thursday, October 
21. 
I read that letter to my colleagues here 
on the floor of the Senate. It reads:

Ctober 22, 1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
,ro all Men in Vietnam: 
Today Is ti beautiful fall day. The trees 
are ?changing color, the sky is deep blue. 
Many Americans are enjoying this Sunday, 
Why? 
Because you are there in Vietnam, fight-
ing; being wounded, and even dying for us--
for our freedom. 
You have said that you feel the people of 
the United States do not think you are 
fighting for a worthwhile cause. I can think 
of no better cause than freedom. Our God-
given freedom is our most precious earthly 
possession. America could not be what she 
is without the freedom you are preserving. 
I know that I am not the only person 
In the United States who prays for you daily 
and gives thanks that you are there protect-
ing with your lives our freedom, our Na-
tion, and our existence. 
Thank you, every one and may God keep 
and bless you all. 
Sincerely yours, 
LINDA SAMPLES. 
Mr. President, now finally I should tell 
that Miss Samples is an outstanding high 
school student, earns her own money 
cooking and cleaning, and is active in a 
number of worthwhile youth groups and 
as a church member. 
Linda's letter has already gained na-
tional attention; it is in stories being 
distributed by NEA, a newspaper syndi-
cate, to more than 700 newspapers. A 
copy has been forwarded to Gen. Wil-
liam C. Westmoreland, commander of 
the U.S. Military Assistance Command 
in Vietnam; also a copy is being sent to 
the Stars and Stripes, which is a mili-
tary newspaper. 
It brings a ray of restored confidence 
in the youth of our country. So many 
protests and demonstrations are being 
promoted, making it appear that the 
majority of the people of the United 
States are indifferent to the preservation 
of our freedom. 
I believe that this 16-year-old girl, 
with her fine character, represents the 
thinking of the great majority of the 
citizens of our country. She stands 
rather conspicuously as a contradistinc-
tion from those wan, long-haired, oddly 
dressed beatniks who are demonstrating 
in front of the White House, on our 
school campuses, and other places in 
the Nation. 
A lesson should be drawn from what 
this young girl has had to say. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, will 
the Senator yield? 
Mr. LAUSCHE. I yield. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Did the Senator see 
the significant article that appeared in 
this morning's press with respect to the 
students gathering their groups about 
them in protest against the demonstra-
tors who seem to have little or no inter-
est in our country? It was a heartening 
thing to see that in one Midwestern uni-
versity 2,700 students voted to support 
the President's stand, as opposed to a 
much lesser group. 
I believe that is significant. Does the 
Senator agree? 
Mr. LAUSCHE. It is one of the 
tragedies of the days that those who 
demonstrate have been getting great at-
tention on television, radio, newspapers, 
magazines, and journals. 
No. 198  
Mr. SIMPSON. That is why I would 
like to point out the fact that this ac-
count should be played up. 
These are the people who say little, the 
American people who are out there de-
fending their country, as opposed to the 
group of people who have an aversion to 
soap and water and sit on people's steps. 
Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, it must 
be said now that the President has tried 
valiantly and vigorously to bring the 
Communists to the negotiating table. 
Some time ago I enumerated 10 steps 
he has taken, practically begging, and 
in a measure surrendering the dignity 
of our country. But his aim has been to 
bring the Vietnamese difficulty to an end. 
Yet, in many instances innocent groups 
frequently with Moscow and Peiping di-
rected leaders, provoke demonstrations 
throughout the country. 
The President is trying to bring about 
peace. 
Some say, "Withdraw from South 
Vietnam." 
My question in the past has been, and 
it is today: To what point shall we 
withdraw? to Thailand? to Burma? to 
Malaysia? If we withdraw to those 
points will that bring the end? Do we 
withdraw to California or to Hawaii? 
Do we bring the field of battle from 
10,000 miles away to our immediate 
shores? 
No one wants to be involved in the 
South Vietnamese shooting. But neces-
sity compels us; the need to preserve 
freedom, as stated by this young girl, 
Linda Samples, requires it. Or shall we 
give up; shall we surrender all that we 
have sung about in the years past of our 
great heritage? 
NORA ISABELLA SAMUELLI 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
ask that the Chair lay before the Senate 
a message from the House of Represen-
tatives on the bill, S. 619, for the relief 
of Nora Isabella Samuelli. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tern-
pore. The Chief Clerk will read the mes-
sage from the House of Representatives 
on S. 619. 
The Chief Clerk read as follows: 
Ordered, that the Clerk of the House be 
directed to return to the Senate the bill (S. 
619) entitled "An act for the relief of Nora 
Isabella Samuelli," together with all ac-
companying papers, in compliance with the 
request by the Senate thereon. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
reconsider the vote by which it asked for 
a conference with the House of Repre-
sentatives and appointed conferees on 
the part of the Senate. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tern-
pore. Without objection, the action of 
the Senate is reconsidered. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, as 
passed by the Senate, the bill would have 
granted the status of permanent resi-
dence in the United States to the bene-
ficiary, and have deemed her residence 
and physical presence in the United 
States since July 31, 1963, to meet the 
requirements for naturalization. As 
27139 
amended by the House of Representa-
tives, the bill merely grants the status of 
permanent residence in the United 
States. 
Granting the beneficiary permanent 
residence in the United States as of her 
prior date of admission on July 31, 1963, 
would be acceptable, and I move that 
the Senate concur in the House amend-
ment to S. 619, with a further amend-
ment to grant permanent residence as of 
July 31, 1963, rather than as of the date 
of enactment, and I send to the desk the 
amendment. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tern-
pore. The amendment will be stated. 
The CH/EF CLERK. On page 1, line 6, 
after the word "of", it is proposed to 
strike out the words "the date of the 
enactment of this Act", and insert in lieu 
thereof "July 31, 1963". 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
move that the Senate concur in the 
House amendment with the amendment. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tern-
pore. The question is on agreeing to the 
motion of the Senator from Montana. 
The motion was agreed to. 
THE CALENDAR 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of Calendar 
No. 915, H.R. 4421. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
CONVEYANCE OF CERTAIN PROP-
ERTY TO THE CITY OF CHEYENNE, 
WYO. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of H.R. 4421, 
Calendar No. 915. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tern-
pore. The bill will be stated by title for 
the information of the Senate. 
The LEGISLATIVE CLERK. A bill (H.R. 
4421) authorizing the Administrator of 
Veterans' Affairs to convey certain prop-
erty to the city of Cheyenne, Wyo. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection to the present 
consideration of the bill? 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent to have printed 
In the RECORD an excerpt from the re-
port (No. 929), explaining the purposes 
of the bill. 
There being no objection, the excerpt 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
EXPLANATION OF THE BILL 
This bill proposes to authorize the Ad-
ministrator of Veterans' Affairs to transfer 
to the city of Cheyenne, Wyo., without mon-
etary consideration for park and recreational 
purposes, a tract of land of approximately 
27 acres which is now portion of the reserva-
tion at the Veterans' Administration Cen-
ter. 
In 1932 the city of Cheyenne donated a 
tract of 600 acres of land on which was sub-
sequently constructed a center which now 
consists of a regional office and a 133-bed

hospital with a preponderance of general 
medical and surgical patients. Previously, 
under the acts of June 29, 1948, and June 15, 
1956, approximately 431 acres of the original 
tract was conveyed without remuneration to 
the city of Cheyenne. 
The bill provides that the deed of convey-
ance shall contain certain terms and con-
ditions to protect the interests of the United 
States. 
There will be no appropriation necessary 
to carry out the provisions of this legisla-
tion. 
The office of Senator WAYNE MORSE has 
studied this measure and has extended as-
surance that neither HR. 4421, nor S. 554 
violate the so-called Morse formula for such 
land transfer. The subject bill calls for the 
gratuitous transfer of the property in ques-
tion since the land was originally part of 
an entire tract of 600 acres of /and gratui-
tously conveyed to the United States by the 
city of Cheyenne, Wyo. in the first instance. 
The report of the Veterans' Administration 
reveals that the Veterans' Administration 
does not have need of the property de-
scribed in the bills and that it will have 
no objection to the transfer. 
In cases of this type, a gratuitous convey-
ance is not objectionable under the Morse 
I ormula,. Where land was originally do-
nated, a reversion is implied in favor of the 
donor if the United States is willing to dis-
pose of the property. The provisions of 
these bills are similar to the provisions of 
R.R. 2414 and S. 4608 which received the 
approval of the committee. H.R. 2414 re-
ceived Senate approval in September 1965. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tern-
pore. The bill is before the Senate and 
open to amendment. If there be no 
amendment to be offered, the question is 
on the third reading and passage of the 
bill. 
The bill (H.R. 4421) was ordered to a 
third reading, read the third time, and 
passed. 
Mr. SI1VIPSON. Mr. President, I wish 
to state to my fellow Senators that I am 
very grateful for the passage of this leg-
islation. Its passage makes it possible 
to proceed with an important piece of 
construction in the city of Cheyenne, 
Wyo., which has been held in abeyance 
Pending the passage of the bill. Now 
construction may get underway. The 
Morse formula does not apply. 
NOTICE OF INSTALLATION OF HON. 
EMERY FRAZIE,R AS SECRETARY 
OF THE SENATE 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, for 
the information of the Senate?under 
the rules It will be necessary, and it will 
be a real privilege?I wish to state that 
at approximately noon today, the dis-
tinguished Chief Clerk of the Senate, 
Hon. Emery Frazier, of Kentucky, will 
be sworn in as Secretary of the Senate, 
to assume his duties on the 1st of Janu-
ary, next year. 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to consider executive business. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tern-
pore. Is there objection to the request 
of the Senator from Montana? 
There being no objection, the Sen-
ate proceeded to the consideration of ex-
ecutive business.

in the RECORD on the subject just dis-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from Wisconsin? 
There was no objection. 
COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF 
CIVIL RIGHTS AND ANTI-VIETNAM 
MOVEMENTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
Moss). Under previous order of the 
House, the gentleman from Mississippi 
[Mr. WILLIAMS] is recognized for 25 min-
utes. 
Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, a 
number qf Members of this body have 
taken the floor in the last few days to ex-
press indignation over the current wave 
of demonstrations being waged in Pro-
test against American intervention in 
Vietnam. I, as much as any other Mem-
ber of the Congress, deplore and resent 
these demonstrations. Surely, Mr. 
Speaker, at a time when Americans are 
fighting and dying to stop the enslave-
ment of free people by predatory Com-
munist forces, they need all the support 
that we can give them. Whatever mis-
takes may have been made in the past 
by those who formulate our foreign poli-
cies, the fact remains that we are in Viet-
nam; our boys are dying there, and our 
national honor and security are at stake. 
In the conduct of this mission, the Presi-
dent needs and deserves the support of 
every patriotic American citizen, and I, 
for one, am willing to give him my full 
support in this effort. 
The wave of demonstrations and civil 
disobedience that spread throughout the 
country last weekend have all the ear-
marks of a highly organized Communist 
plot, designed to embarrass us in the eyes 
of the world, and to encourage Red 
China to redouble its efforts to push us 
out of Vietnam. These demonstrations, 
intended to serve the Communist cause 
by conveying a false picture of American 
disunity to the rest of the world, actu-
ally border on the side of treason. 
These were not spontaneous, spur-of-
the-moment manifestations of protest 
on the part of conscientious American 
citizens reacting to the danger of a war 
that might jeopardize the future security 
of our country. These demonstrations 
were obviously well planned in advance, 
well financed and well coordinated so as 
to gain for the demonstrators a maxi-
mum amount of publicity throughout the 
world. The participants were expert in 
the technique of civil disobedience 
through training and experience, as I 
will attempt to prove later in this dis-
sertation. 
To those of us who represent States 
and areas which have been subjected to 
the many massive so-called civil rights 
demonstrations during the last few 
years, Attorney General Katzenbach's 
recent public recognition of the role 
being played by Communists in these 
Vietnam demonstrations came as no sur-
prise. What amazes many of us is the 
fact that General Katzenbach ignored 
this same Communist influence and par-
ticipation in the wave of civil disobe-
dience that lately has been going on in 
the name of civil rights. Those who, just 
a few weeks ago, were demonstrating for 
civil rights, are now in the forefront in 
trying to undermine our policies in 
southeast Asia. 
General Katzenbach and other leaders 
in our administration gave the stamp of 
approval to the numerous civil rights 
protest marches, sit-ins, wade-ins, He-
ins, teach-ins, boycotts, law violations, 
and other forms of civil disobedience, on 
the premise that these people were ex-
ercising +heir constitutional right of 
petition. To the extent that they closed 
their eyes to the fact that much of this 
was Communist inspired, agitated and 
promoted, they have given license and 
encouragement to the same crowd, by 
and large, that is now creating trouble 
and dissension over our foreign policy. 
It will be recalled that the hard-core 
anti-Vietnam protest groups demon-
strated here in the shadow of the Capi-
tol on August 9, 1965. They called their 
rally the Assembly of Unrepresented 
People. These professionals formed the 
vanguard of last weekend's demonstra-
tions that were held throughout the 
country. 
The leaders of the August 9 march on 
the Capitol were Robert Parish Moses 
of SNCC?Student Nonviolent Coordi-
nating Committee?a militant leftwing 
pink tinged civil rights agitating outfit, 
and a man named Staughton Lynd, a 
member of the faculty at Yale Univer-
sity. Both Moses and Lynd have been 
active in creating racial strife in the 
State of Mississippi, and are ardent ad-
vocates of the use of civil disobedience 
to carry out their aims. 
Robert Parish Moses, though not a 
Mississippian, was one of the organizers 
of the group that calls itself the Missis-
sippi Freedom Democratic Party. The 
Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, a 
tightly knit but well organized and fi-
nanced group of racial agitators, has in-
volved itself recently in numerous mass 
demonstrations in Jackson and Natchez, 
Miss., as well as participating in other 
similar disturbances in other communi-
ties throughout Mississippi. 
A large contingent of this organiza-
tion spent the night of September 16, 
1965, on the 'U.S. Capitol Grounds. In-
dividual members made speeches and 
passed out literature, all in absolute vio-
lation of law, but no arrests were made. 
Is it possible, Mr. Speaker, that this out-
law political group has immunity from 
Federal law, simply because they agitate 
in the name of civil rights? 
On the other hand, Mr. Speaker, quite 
a number of SNCC and FDP members 
were arrested on August 9, 1965, when 
they marched onto the Capitol Grounds 
in a demonstration opposing our Vietnam 
policy. 
Staughton Lynd, the Yale professor, 
organized the so-called freedom schools 
in Mississippi in 1964, to train the local 
people in the fine arts of the sit-in, 
march-in, sit-down and go-limp tech-
niques. Staughton Lynd also organized 
the student Vietnam protest in Wash-
ington last March when a sit-in was 
staged within the walls of the White 
House. And last May, at the University 
of California at Berkeley teach-in, this 
same Lynd advocated wholesale civil dis-
orders throughout the country to force 
President Johnson's resignation. 
Last weekend, Lynd was scheduled to 
appear at a Vietnam protest rally with 
James 0. Williams, chairman of Phila-
delphia's Congress of Racial Equality, 
another civil rights agitating outfit. 
Mr. Speaker, it is more than mere 
coincidence that the leaders in the civil 
rights demonstrations always turn up as 
leaders of the Vietnam protest demon-
strations. I would point out that Dick 
Gregory, the alleged comedian, whose 
participation in civil rights demonstra-
tions has been widely heralded through-
out the country, is active, also, in the 
anti-Vietnam movement. In fact, this 
man was scheduled recently to speak at 
a Chicago Vietnam protest meeting. 
And then, Mr. Speaker, there is the 
high mogul of all racial demagogues and 
racketeers, the recipient of the now tar-
nished Nobel Peace Prize, the most suc-
cessful money collector of them all, the 
grand high priest of civil disobedience, 
the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. 
This high and mighty emperor of dis-
cord, at whose feet worship thousands of 
cringing politicians, has publicly pro-
tested our war against Communist 
China's aggression, and has advocated 
the admission of Red China to the United 
Nations. That King should be parroting 
the party line comes as no shock to per-
sons familiar with the background of 
support for pink-tinged causes and his 
association with known Communists, in-
cluding participation in activities at pro-
Communist Myles Horton's Highlander 
Folk School, the notorious Communist 
training school at Monteagle, Tenn. 
It is becoming increasingly evident 
that those trained in civil rights subver-
sion are now turning their attention to 
the Communist-inspired goal?United 
States withdrawal from Vietnam. 
Mr. Speaker, a great number of the 
professional marchers against Vietnam 
policy were trained for their present 
roles at the National Council of 
Churches' facility at Mount Beulah, near 
Edwards, Miss, financed partly with 
Federal funds channeled through the 
poverty program. This same Mount 
Beulah was headquarters for a Head 
Start project financed by 0E0 to the 
tune of $1,400,000, and under the spon-
sorship of a committee composed mainly 
of members of SNCC and the so-called 
Freedom Democratic Party. In the past 
few days, this Mount Beulah project has 
been the subject of a rather revealing 
and fruitful investigation in the other 
body, resulting in a shutdown of Mount 
Beulah's 0E0 project, and some red 
faces on the part of Mr. Shriver and his 
associates. 
One of those who made the pilgrimage 
from Mount Beulah to participate in the 
August 9 anti-Vietnam demonstration in 
Washington was a woman by the name 
of Liz Fusco. In an interview at Mount 
Beulah last June, which appeared in a 
Memphis newspaper, Liz Fusco con-
tended that there were no Communists 
in Vietnam, adding "That's just Govern-
ment propaganda." When she was in-
terviewed, Liz Fusco was attending an

and political integration. I think what 
is needed now is for us to apply to our-
selves and to our neighbors across the 
Atlantic the same ideas that we have 
urged others to apply, particularly our 
support for the development of the 
Common Market. 
But, if we can succeed, I deeply feel 
that the effect of this would be to 
strengthen the United Nations. 
Mr. FTNDLEY. Mr. Speaker, if the 
gentleman will yield further, one of the 
curious aspects of State Department 
policy through the years has been to en-
courage the merging of national sover-
eignty among European nations. But 
never have they suggested that the 
United States do any merging. It is 
always for the other fellow, which seems 
to me a rather dubious position to take. 
Mr. FRASER. I think the comment 
of the gentleman is well taken. I am 
a great admirer of the work of the State 
Department, but sometimes It seems that 
some additional boldness and some more 
aggressive initiative would be fruitful in 
developing the kind of world in which 
we could find western values more likely 
to survive. In that connection it is my 
view that the time has arrived when we 
ought to use the boldness and the imag-
ination and the determination which 
characterizes those who helped to bring 
together the Original Thirteen Colonies 
which founded this great nation. 
Mr. ZABLOCKI. I thank the gentle-
man from Minnesota [Mr. FRASER] for 
his excellent remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, I had in my own remarks 
referred to determined men that were 
fired with the vision of free and open 
unity of States in a Federal system. 
What I had in mind with reference to 
this idea, of course, the gentleman from 
Minnesota [Mr. FRASER] , has covered so 
well, and who has in the Foreign Affairs 
Committee contributed much to a better 
understanding of the important legisla-
tion that comes before that committee, 
and whose contributions in the past have 
been great and we look forward to the 
future. 
Mr. ELLSWORTH. Mr. Speaker, will 
the gentleman yield? 
Mr. ZABLOCKI. I shall be glad to 
Yield to the gentleman from Kansas. 
Mr. ELLSWORTH. I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding and I certainly want 
to express my appreciation for and my 
recognition of the leadership and the 
courage of the gentleman from Wis-
consin [Mr. ZAstocia] , in taking the lead 
in introducing this resolution and in 
taking this special order and in setting 
the tone of the special order with his 
remarks which have been so much to the 
Paint and which have been so much aP-
predated by all of us who are interested 
iri-this subject. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to express appreci-
ation also to the gentleman from Illinois 
[Mr. FINDLEY] for his longtime leader-
ship in this important area and partic-
ularly since he has been a Member of 
this body, and most especially since he 
has served as the chairman of the House 
Republican Policy Committee Task Force 
on NATO Unity. 
Mr. Speaker, as everyone knows, the 
NO. 198--24 
gentleman from Illinois [Mr. FINDLEY] 
has been a tremendous force not only in 
the House of Representatives but in the 
Nation in that capacity and has made 
many contributions, contributions of 
great substance, as well as the contribu-
tion of his own leadership in that area. 
I want to express my own appreciation 
especially to the gentleman from Min-
nesota [Mr. FassEa] who preceded me 
here in the well of the House, for his 
fine remarks. The gentleman from 
Minnesota sketched the global repercus-
sions, the interests of the various nations 
of the Atlantic Community in global sit-
uations from Vietnam to Africa, to Latin 
America, and every zone and sector that 
affects the lives of people not only of 
those areas of the world but of the At-
lantic nations as well, and recognized in 
his remarks the importance of develop-
ing a political structure for the working 
out of the interests of all of us in these 
critical areas of the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to focus my own 
remarks this afternoon on the field of 
monetary and economic policy, and par-
ticularly want to stress the steps that 
have already been taken, structural steps, 
within the Atlantic Community to bring 
the interested nations of the Atlantic 
Community closer together, because im-
portant steps toward Atlantic unity have 
already been taken in the broad fields of 
monetary and economic policies. The 
sharp focus of attention on the U.S. bal-
ance-of-payments deficits, and the ef-
fects of those deficits on the entire At-
lantic Community?including Japan?
have already made a compelling virtue 
out of a cooperation among the nations 
involved. 
Three concrete steps have been taken. 
First, the central bankers of Western 
Europe, the United States, Canada, and 
Japan, meet every month in Basle, 
Switzerland. Second, a "Working Party 
3" was set up in 1961 within the Orga-
nization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development?OECD?bringing togeth-
er around the same table both treasury 
and central bank officials from most of 
the Atlantic nations at 4- to 6-week in-
tervals to examine each other's progress 
toward balance-of-payments equilibrum. 
And finally, in order to assure confi-
dence and stability in all the principal 
currencies of the developed nations, the 
Group of Ten was formed. Within this 
Group have come additional possibilities 
for frequent interchange and review as 
well as action, by financial and mone-
tary officials of the Atlantic nations. 
The Group of Ten has now recom-
mended the establishment of an even 
closer watch?it is called multilateral 
surveillance?over the ways in which 
nations handle their monetary and eco-
nomic policies. 
Here, then, are the seeds for fruitful 
union among the free and advanced in-
dustrial nations of the world?the At-
lantic nations, if you will, and Japan?
in the critical and sensitive area of 
money and economics. In a free and 
peaceful community, few conditions are 
more important to human development 
than high and rising living standards, 
ample employment opportunities, price 
27299 
stability, and equitable distribution of 
Income. We already know that nations 
require unity among themselves if these 
goals are to be achieved; and we now 
have the beginnings of political struc-
ture to achieve that unity. 
In conclusion, may I say to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin once again how 
much we appreciate his leadership in 
this area. He is one of the most power-
ful and influential members of the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee, I hope 
he will schedule hearings on these 
resolutions at an early date in 1966. 
Mr. ZABLOCKI. I commend the gen-
tleman from Kansas for his fine remarks, 
and assure him I will do everything 
within my power to see that the resolu-
tion will be heard as early as possible 
in the 2d session of the 89th Congress. 
Mr. HALPERN. Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to take this opportunity to compliment 
the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. FIND-
LEY], the gentleman from Minnesota 
[Mr. FRASER] , the gentleman from Kan-
sas [Mr. ELLSWORTH], the gentleman 
man from Wisconsin [Mr. ZABLOCKI], 
and many other colleagues who are so 
enthusiastically and effectively working 
for a stronger Atlantic Community. 
I want to fully associate myself with 
the resolution sponsored in this body, 
proposing that an 18-man delegation 
meet with other NATO nations to ex-
plore the possibilities and timetable for 
the construction of Atlantic Union. 
It is ironic that we must witness at 
this time the forces of disarray at work, 
at a time when unity of purpose remains 
as essential as ever. The United States 
must take the initiative toward Atlantic 
solidarity which has so obviously weak-
ened in the past few years. 
It would be tragic to drift back to the 
narrow nationalism of past years, for-
getting the lessons of war and destruc-
tion which have too often been caused 
by petty bickering and false priorities. 
We should not suppose that Atlantic 
Union can be brought about overnight, 
or by wishful thinking. We cannot ig-
nore the present-day realities which un-
deniably inhibit the proposed creation of 
Atlantic institutions. 
But it would be a serious, perhaps 
drastic, error to forsake this eminent ob-
jective now. Our hope for the future 
does not embody a host of suspicious na-
tional entities, all pursuing their diverg-
ent national interests without recourse to 
the interests of the whole. 
The United States and the West Euro-
pean states share a common historical 
development. Their wealth, power and 
prestige have increased enormously since 
the Second World War. It is a natural, 
and mutually beneficial, wish that the 
nations that ring the Atlantic combine 
together, not only for their own benefit 
but also for the benefit of the newly 
emerging nations. 
With this resolution we can perhaps 
reinvigorate this great endeavor.

October 22, 1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOU st 27301 
orientation session of the Mississippi 
Freedom Democratic Party, also head- , 
quartered at Mount Beulah?along with 
the National Council of Churches and the 
Head Start program. 
One of the most notorious of these pro-
testing our policies in Vietnam-is a young 
man named Mario Salvo. This man got 
his training in Mississippi in the civil 
rights movement before going to Cali-
fornia to instigate the student riots at 
Berkeley as leader of the so-called free 
speech movement. Salvo has also been 
active in meetings protesting our Viet-
nam policy. 
Mr. Speaker, of the 200, people arrested 
at the Capitol on August 9 in the anti-
Vietnam demonstration, at least 10 per-
cent are easily identifiable as having been 
civil rights workers in Mississippi. Un-
doubtedly there were many more who 
managed to escape arrest, who had come, 
also, from the ranks of Mississippi's civil 
rights agitators. 
Mr. Speaker, I assert again that there 
is a direct connection between the civil 
rights demonstrations and the Vietnam 
demonstrations. This connection needs 
exploration and exposure. 
Mr. Speaker, on October 18, 1965, At-
torney General Katzenbach is quoted by 
the Associated Press as saying that the 
Justice Department has uncovered 
"some Communists and some persons 
very closely associated with Communists" 
working for the organization known as 
Students for a Democr9tic Society. 
The February, 1964, SDS bulletin, pub-
lished by the Students for a Democratic 
Society, 119 Fifth Avenue, New York City, 
contained the following article, written 
by Jim Monsonis: 
SNCC WILL INUNDATE MISSISSIPP/ IN siymmER 
CRASH PROGRAM 
Mississippi will be the main focus of at-
tention this summer for SNCC. Plans are 
now being formulated, together with CORE 
and local movements in Mississippi, to try to 
force the issue on whether Mississippi will 
remain a closed society, with the movement 
chipping away gradually, or whether with 
Federal help (even if reluctantly) massive 
changes can occur. The program will be a 
three-pronged one of voter registration, free-
dom schools (for basic political education), 
and literacy and community center work. All 
people are invited to participate?SNCC 
wants as many workers as possible, especial-
ly those who can dig up the $200 or so it 
will cost to support oneself. For applica-
tions and further details, contact the Jack-
son SNCC office: 1,017 Lynch Street, Jackson, 
MoNsoms. 
This same Jim Monsonis has recently 
been on the Federal payroll, as an em-
iployee of the Head Start project at 
Mount Beulah, near Edwards, Miss. Be-
fore going to Mount Beulah he headed 
SNCC's Washington office. There is a 
definite link between SNCC and the or-
ganization known as Students for a 
Democratic Society so is it possible, as 
General Katzenbach charges, that they 
are infiltrated with Communists? And 
if so, should he not take a look, also, into 
the Red influences in SNCC? 
Mr. Speaker, the notorious old time 
hard core Communists, Carl and Ann 
Braden, both of whom are active in the 
anti-Vietnam movement, have been ac-
tive, also, in stirring up trouble in Mis-
sissippi under the guise of civil rights. 
In fact, Carl Braden helped bring the 
Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party 
into being and has been active in sup-
porting it. Carl Braden, also, chauf-
feured Robert Parish Moses all over Mis-
sissippi 3 years ago organizing civil rights 
cells, and fomenting racial trouble in 
general. 
Mr. Speaker, on July 28, the Freedom. 
Democratic Party newsletter, circulated 
generally among Negroes throughout 
Mississippi in a continuing attempt to 
generate unrest among our people, con-
tained an article exhorting Negroes to 
refuse to support our Government in its 
Vietnam effort. For the information of 
Members of the House, Mr. Speaker, I 
include the text of this article: 
Here are five reasons why Negroes should 
not be in any war fighting for America. 
1. No Mississippi Negroes should be fight-
ing in Vietnam for the white man's freedom, 
until all the Negro people are free in Missis-
sippi. 
2. Negro boys should not honor the draft 
here in Mississippi. Mothers should en-
courage their sons not to go. 
3. We will gain respect and dignity as a 
race only by forcing the U.S. Governmcpt 
and the Mississippi government to come with 
guns, dogs and trucks to take our sons away 
to fight and be killed protecting Mississippi, 
Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana. 
4. No one has a right to ask us to risk our 
lives and kill other colored people in Santo 
Domingo and Vietnam, so that the white 
American can get richer. We will be looked 
upon as traitors by all the colored people of 
the world if the Negro people continue to 
fight and die without a cause. 
5. Last week a white soldier from New 
Jersey was discharged from the Army be-
cause he refused to fight in Vietnam. He 
went on a hunger strike. Negro boys can do 
the same thing. We can write and ask our 
sons if they know what they are fighting for. 
If he answers "freedom," tell him that's what 
we are fighting for here In Mississippi. And 
if he says "democracy" tell him the truth?
we don't know anything about communism, 
socialism, and all that, but we do know that 
Negroes have caught hell here under this 
American democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I think it should be noted 
that the National Coordinating Com-
mittee To End the War in Vietnam pub-
lished an appeal on September 13 for 
funds to aid the defense of Pvt. Winston 
Belton, noted in the press as a former 
civil rights worker. This man Belton 
staged a hunger strike at Fort Benning 
and refused to accompany his unit to 
Vietnam. For this act of insubordina-
tion and treason, this man was convicted 
by a court martial, sentenced to 5 years 
confinement and a dishonorable dis-
charge. Before the trial, though, a deal 
had been made by General Colglazier, 
4th Army Commander, who reduced Bel-
ton's sentence to a slap on the wrist 
demotion of one stripe in rank. No valid 
reasons have been given for this kid 
glove treatment as a reward for treason. 
Mr. Speaker, I could go on and on 
showing examples of duplication in the 
personnel, aims and tactics of the anti-
Vietnam movement, the Mississippi Free-
dom Democratic Party, various civil 
rights agitating groups, and the Com-
munist conspiracy, but surely this in-
formation is readily available to the At-
torney General. The American people 
are entitled to know the methods used 
in financing these well-organized demon-
strations.? 
Is it possible, Mr. Speaker, that the 
American taxpayers are helping sup-
port these organizations through tax 
exemption privileges? To what extent 
are we subsidizing these demonstrations 
through such programs as being carried 
on by the Office of Economic Oppor-
tunity? 
Mr. Speaker, this administration and 
those which have preceded it have 
ignored too long the root of the prob-
lem that has manifested itself in the 
Vietnam demonstrations. The time has 
arrived when the Communist influence 
in all massive protests and civil disobe-
dience campaigns should be thoroughly 
investigated and exposed to public view. 
FREIGHT CAR SHORTAGE IN 
THE UNITED STATES 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, one of 
the greatest needs in our country, and 
particularly in the field of transporta-
tion, to adequately serve our people, is 
additional freight cars, particularly in 
certain types of freight cars. 
Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday I advised 
our distinguished majority leader [Mr. 
ALBERT] that I intended to call up under 
unanimous consent S. 1098, which would 
amend section 1(14) (a) of the Interstate 
Commerce Act to insure the adequacy of 
the national railroad freight car supply. 
Mr. ALBERT announced that this bill 
would be called up today?CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD, October 20, 1965, page 
26741. However, yesterday I was advised 
that an objection would be interposed if 
unanimous consent were requested, 
therefore, it will not be practicable to 
take this legislation up today. 
I am not surprised, Mr. Speaker, that 
an objection would be interposed al-
though I must say in all candor and 
frankness, I regret it very sincerely. 
In view of the situation, Mr. Speaker, 
I think it would be appropriate to sub-
mit for the RECORD, S. 1098, as amended 
and reported by the Interstate and For-
eign Commerce Committee?Report No. 
1183, October 20, 1965. It might be 
helpful if at this time I make a short 
explanatory statement describing the 
action which we took in committee. 
As most if not all of you know, there 
is quite a history to this proposed legis-
lation. Ever since World War II we 
have had, particularly at the time of the 
fall harvest, serious shortages of freight 
cars. Legislative proposals to alleviate 
these shortages have been coming up be-
fore the Interstate and Foreign Com-
merce Committee of the House, the Com-
merce Committee of the other body, or 
both, from time to time over the past 17 
or 18 years. Almost 20 years ago, the 
Interstate Commerce Commisson issued 
an order in an attempt to improve the 
supply of freight cars which had in it 
what might be called a penalty provision 
calling for an increased charge which a 
railroad using another railroad's car 
would have to pay for that use if the car 
was not returned to its owner. A re-
viewing court, in Palmer against United 
States found that the Commission's 
order was not based on sufficient grounds

27302 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE October 22, 1965 
and stated that the Commission's power 
to fix compensation for freight car use 
was not coextensive with the power to 
regulate the use of cars. This case was 
decided in 1947 and no appeal was taken 
from it. The Commission's interpreta-
tion over the years since then has been 
that its present powers under section 
1(14) (a) are limited. 
There is complete agreement in the 
Commission and throughout the railroad 
Industry that there is a car shortage and 
it is also apparent that this chronic 
shortage is worsening rather than im-
proving. 
I can say to you that today it is worse 
than it was last week. It is worse than 
it was a month ago. It is worse than it 
was a year ago. 
After the first of the year a rule will 
be sought for the purpose of calling UP 
this program and clarifying the present 
situation giving the Commission author-
ity to deal with it where shortages exist. 
It used to be that the fall harvest sea-
son was the only critical period in a given 
year. More recently serious shortages 
have been occurring, particularly in the 
supply of grain and lumber and plywood 
cars at various times in the year. 
The railroad industry may be split as 
to whether or not any legislative change 
Is desirable, but it is crystal clear in my 
mind that if we are to get any improve-
ment?and certainly an improvement is 
necessary?we will have to clarify the 
powers of the Commission. S. 1098, as 
amended, would do this. It is prospec-
tive in nature in the sense that the effec-
tive date for Commission action is Sep-
tember 1, 1966. This was considered 
and adopted so that the railroad indus-
try through its trade associations will 
have one more opportunity to come to 
terms with itself. 
The legislation is also a discretionary 
power. It provides that in setting rates 
of compensation to be paid for the use 
of any type of freight car, the Commis-
sion may include--rather than shall in-
clude?an incentive element or elements, 
when in the Commission's judgment 
such element or elements can contribute 
to sound car service practices?includ-
ing efficient utilization and distribution 
of cars. By adding incentive elements to 
the compensation, the Commission could 
encourage the acquisition and mainte-
nance of a national freight car supply 
adequate to meet the needs of commerce 
and the national defense. This amend-
ment, if enacted, would become a part 
of existing section 1(14) (a) of the In-
terstate Commerce Act, and thus any 
action which would be related to incen-
tive elements would have to take place 
after a hearing. The requirement of a 
hearing is already in the statute. 
One other point I might mention here, 
the Commission, under this amendment, 
would also be empowered to exempt from 
the compensation to be paid by any group 
of carriers, any incentive element or ele-
ments where such carriers are found en-
titled to such exemption by reason of 
the national interest. I would stress the 
point that this power would not involve 
the ICC and the railroad industry in a 
complete review of every type of car 
which exists. The Commission would 
be precluded from making any incentive 
element applicable to any type of freight 
car, the supply of which the Commis-
sion finds adequate. 
I want to be completely candid with 
my colleagues. I do not claim that this 
amendment would be a panacea. If the 
railroads would modify their attitudes 
on this subject they may be able to solve 
the problem more promptly and more 
efficiently than could ever be done with 
additional legislation, but it appears just 
about certain that we are going to have 
to encourage the railroads to cooperate 
in striving to 1111 the car shortage by 
clarifying and strengthening the ICC's 
powers. The Commission believes, and 
a number of the railroads support the 
Commission in its belief, that S. 1098, 
as amended, will be of great assistance 
in relieving the shortage. We can't go 
on doing nothing; therefore, I hope that 
we can move forward on this proposed 
legislation promptly in the next session. 
I sincerely believe we will then see 
more positive action throughout the 
railroad industry. If not, when the effec-
tive date of the act arrives, the Commis-
sion will be in a much better position to 
take steps to cure this problem. 
Mr. Speaker, in order that those who 
are interested may have advance infor-
mation as to what we propose to do, I 
include at this point the bill, S. 1098, 
with the amendment as reported by the 
committee, which is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO S. 1098 
Strike out all after the enacting clause 
and insert in lieu thereof the following:, 
"That section 1(14) (a) of the Interstate 
Commerce Act is amended by adding at the 
end thereof the following: 
"'In fixing such compensation to be paid 
for the use of any type of freight car, the 
Commission shall give consideration to the 
national level of ownership of such type 
of freight Car and to other factors affecting 
the adequacy of the national freight car 
supply, and shall, on the basis of such con-
sideration, determine whether compensation 
should be computed solely on the basis of 
elements of ownership expense involved in 
owning and maintaining such type of freight 
car, including a fair return on value, or 
whether such compensation should be in-
creased by such incentive element or ele-
ments of compensation as in the Commis-
sion's judgment will provide just and 
reasonable compensation to freight car 
owners, contribute to sound car service prac-
tices (including efficient utilization and 
distribution of cars), and encourage the 
acquisition and maintenance of a car supply 
adequate to meet the needs of commerce 
and the national defense. The Commission 
shall not make any incentive element ap-
plicable to any type of freight car the supply 
of which the Commission finds to be ade-
quate and may exempt from the compensa-
tion to be paid by any group of carriers such 
incentive element or elements if the Com-
mission finds it to be in the national in-
terest.' 
"Sze. 2. Any compensation fixed pursuant 
to the amendment made to the Interstate 
Commerce Act by the first section of this 
Act shall not take effect befere September 1, 
1966." 
MAIL VOLUME AND PROSPERITY 
(Mr. OLSEN of Montana to revise and 
extend his remarks in the body of the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. OLSEN of Montana. Mr. Speak-
er, a few days ago I called my colleagues' 
attention to a press release of the Post 
Office Department dealing with the re-
lationship between mail volume and the 
economy. 
Mr. Nicholson, Assistant Postmaster - 
General for Finance and Administration, 
wrote me on October 1, 1965, clarifying 
the Department's position on the mail 
volume-prosperity relationship and dis-
agreeing with my conclusions. 
My original remarks, the Depart-
ment's press release, Mr. Nicholson's let-
ter, and my reply to him follow: 
MAIL VOLUME AND PROSPERITY 
(Extension of remarks of Hon. ARNOLD 
OLSEN, of Montana, in the House of Rep-
resentatives, Monday, September 27, 1965) 
Mr. OLSEN of Montana. Mr. Speaker, the 
Post Office Department for years has at-
tempted to minimize the cause-and-effect 
relationship between mail volume and pros-
perity. This has been particularly true 
when the Department has been attempting 
to raise the postage rates. 
It is gratifying, therefore, to read the Post 
Office Department's press release No. 141, 
dated September 26, which attributes the 
unexpected and unprecedented increase in 
mail volume during the past summer to "the 
stimulus of a strong national economy." 
The fact is, the statisticians and prognos-
ticators in the Department predicted only a 
normal volume increase of 2.7 percent over 
the summer of 1964, instead of which they 
have been confronted with a 5.1 percent in-
crease. Since departmental officials had 
based their budget and their appropriations 
requests on the lesser figure, this has caused 
them considerable inconvenience in operat-
ing the service. 
The point is, Mr. Speaker, the business 
users of the mails do stimulate and prime 
the national economy. And when the na-
tional economy is thriving, the usage of the 
mails increases proportionately. 
This is a fact that has, in the past, been 
obvious to everyone except Government ac-
countants. It is nice to see the Post Office 
Department finally admitting the validity of 
the obvious. 
POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT RELEASE No. 141 
Mail volume, a traditional barometer of 
economic strength, surged far beyond expec-
tations during the past summer, under the 
stimulus of a strong national economy, the 
Post Office Department reported today. Here 
are highlights, based on expert estimates: 
1. For the first two accounting periods this 
summer, from mid-June to mid-August, mail 
volume jumped 5.1 percent over a compa-
rable period last year. 
2. The 5.1-percent increase was almost 
twice as much as a 2.7-percent increase pre-
viously forecast by Department experts. 
3. The approximate 5-percent increase was 
uniform in major mail categories?letters, 
newspapers, and periodicals, advertising mat-
ter, reflecting uniformity of strength in many 
sectors of the national economy. 
4. Mail volume for the two accounting 
periods of 4 weeks each rose from 9,521,117,-
000 pieces for last year to 10,003,028,000 pieces 
this summer. 
5. Revenue this past summer was $627,-
301,000 for the two periods compered with 
$594,342,000 last year, an increase of nearly 
$33 million and $8 million more than antici-
pated earlier by expert projections. 
History has demonstrated the validity of 
mail volume as a barometer of economic 
strength. In 1929, before the depression, for 
example, mail volume was nearly 28 billion 
pieces. It dropped steadily to 19.8 billion 
pieces in 1933, setting back the clock on mail 
volume to pre-World-War-I days.

Mr. BARTLE'TT. Mr. President, I 
move to reconsider the vote by which the 
bill was passed. 
Mr. SMATHERS. Mr. President, I 
move to lay that motion on the table. 
The motion to lay on the table was 
agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator from New York [Mr. Javirsl is 
recognized. 
Mr. BARTLETT. Mr. President, will 
the Senator yield? 
Mr. JAVITS. I yield to the Senator 
from Alaska. 
Mr. BARTLETT. I merely wanted to 
say that I concurred in the amendment 
to the Alaska centennial bill, but with 
great reluctance. I am convinced that 
there is a need, which will be demon-
strated, for more than $3 million; but 
there is a need also for at least action at 
this session of the Congress. It was with 
that understanding and the recognition 
of the need that I concurred. 
I express my thanks once more to the 
junior Senator from Michigan [Mr. 
HART], who has done a magnificent job 
in behalf of Alaska, who has worked 
many hours upon this measure. I am 
grateful to him. 
I also express my thanks to the chair-
man of the full Commerce Committee, 
the Senator from Washington [Mr. 
MAargusorrl, who cannot be here at this 
moment, but who has helped in bring-
ing this bill before the Senate. 
Mr. GRUENING. Mr. President, will 
the Senator yield? 
Mr. JAVITS. I yield to the Senator 
from Alaska. 
Mr. GRUENING. I would like to join 
my colleague in expressing our thanks to 
the Senator from Michigan. The ability 
of the junior Senator from Michigan to 
get this bill through at this late hour 
of the session required a high degree of 
parliamentary skill and sympathetic 
support. 
It is my hope that when this bill goes 
to conference in the coming session of 
Congress, the proper amount, for reasons 
which have been made clear, will be re-
stored. The original purchase price of 
Alaska, $7.2 million, has already been re-
turned to the Treasury a hundredfold 
or more. That is the original amount, re-
quested for matching purposes which 
should be restored, and it is the appro-
priate amount that should be appropri-
ated by the Federal Government as 
matching funds for the celebration of 
the centen ial?that great historic event. 
NSTRATIONS ON VIETNAM 
POLICY 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I wish 
to say a word during this interim about 
the demonstrations which have been 
taking place over the past weekends in 
opposition to U.S. policy in Vietnam and 
of the promise for the coming weekend 
of parades and demonstrations in sup-
port of our policy in Vietnam. 
First, I support our policy in Vietnam, 
and I disagree thoroughly with the point 
made by the demonstrators against our 
Vietnam policy. 
Second, I point out that the_right to 
expose Communist influence in these 
demonstrations, which is compatible with 
the Bill of Rights and civil liberties, is 
entirely compatible with the policy of 
the United States, and I support that. 
Third, and very important, we should 
be reminded of the French aphorism, 
that, "I disagree with every syllable you 
utter, but I will defend to the end your 
right to say it." 
So whatever one may think of the ob-
jectives and policies of any of these dem-
onstrations against the policy of the 
President in Vietnam?and I am for 
those policies?it is crucial that we re-
member that political protest is a vital 
part of American life, and a part of the 
Bill of Rights in the Constitution. 
Let us remember, too, that it is neces-
sary to say this at this moment when so 
recently many of us defended demon-
strations by Negroes for equal oppor-
tunity and civil rights, the denial which 
bothered the consciences of so many of 
us, and which demonstrations were very 
effective in righting, at least in law, many 
of the injustices which had been prac-
ticed against Negro citizens. 
So we must always remember that 
among the rights guaranteed our citizens 
is the right of every American to be 
heard in public on highly controversial 
subjects, no matter how many may be

Its initial hearing before the Commit-
tee on Public Works. 
In the Committee on Commerce T said 
these words: 
It was the conclusion of Senator MCNA-
MARA, of Michigan, chairman of the, Senate 
Public Works Committee, that the centen-
nial bill should not be acted upon, by his 
committee, and it was at the suggestion of 
Senator MCNAMAR& initially that it was de-
cided to dra,w up a new bill incorporating 
the recommendations of the Department of 
Commerce and the Bureau of the Budget and 
introduce a new, clean bill. 
This was all at the suggestion or with 
the acquiescence of the chairman of the 
Public Works Committee. It has not 
been mentioned, but it is correct to say 
that the bill is approved by the admin-
istration, by the Department of Com-
merce, and by the Bureau of the Budget. 
Mr. LAUSCHE. I believe that itmust 
be said they have approved it and, Mr. 
President, they approved it on the basis 
that it is unique. By unique, I mean in 
effect that it is said that there is no 
other situation of a similar nature. 
However, the Senator from Alaska [Mr. 
BARTLETT] is correct in his statement that 
the measure was approved. However, I 
still do not approve of it. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. 
President, as the Senator from Ohio has 
pointed out, this seems to be almost a 
weekly occurrence. Bills on Interania, 
world's fairs, State fairs, one thing and 
another, are constantly coming up in 
many areas of the country, and bills are 
coming into the Chamber two at a time, 
In the closing days of the session. 
Even if the bill were meritorious, it 
could be considered later because there 
Is nothing urgent about it. I believe it 
is a proper request that the amount in 
the bill be cut down. I understand that 
the bill is very much desired in Alask a, 
that there are three auttoriums in dif-
ferent areas of Alaska which they wish 
to build. Even this step would allow $1 
million each. If there was any merit to 
the bill and additional money were 
needed later, it could be provided. The 
very least that could be done would be 
to accept a cut at this time. I hope that 
the sponsors of the bill will be willing to 
do so and will accept it, in which event I 
would not press for a yea-and-nay vote. 
But I believe that perhaps in the inter-
ests of getting the proposed legislation 
enacted into law, if we are interested 
In it, it might be advisable to accept 
the cut. I believe that it is a proper 
suggestion. 
Mr. LAUSCHE. I wish the U.S. Gov-
ernment to participate in this celebra-
tion, but I wish to do it on a reasonable 
basis. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I do, 
too; and I believe that if it came back 
later for real justification when we had 
time to consider the bill and an addi-
tional amount was found to be needed, 
It could be provided. 
I agree with the Senator from Alaska 
that he has already made a few cuts in 
the bill. I realize how he feels about it. 
Still, by making those cuts, we admit 
that there is nothing sacred about the 
bill. 
Mr. BARTLETT. Will the Senator 
from Delaware yield at that point? 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield. 
Mr. BARTLETT. I fear that the Sec-
retary may not be fully informed, which 
is quite understandable. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I am 
sure I am not, but let me say to the 
Senator from Alaska that he does not 
have to apologize for making his state-
ment. He is correct. That is the rea-
son I suggest that we make this cut, 
because during the closing days of a ses-
sion Senators cannot possibly be fully 
informed on the multitude of bills which 
are rammed through the Senate in its 
last hours. I believe that it is proper. 
Mr. BARTLET.e. I could not agree. 
The bill comes to the Senate after having 
had exhaustive hearings before the Com-
mittee on Public Works, and, thanks 
largely to the Senator from Ohio, before 
the Committee on Commerce. But the 
point I wish to make is that the State 
Centennial Commission was organized 2 
or 3 years ago. It has been working 
diligentlY. There are not only 3 places 
which will hold celebrations in connec-
tion with the centennial, but there are 
also 22 communities throughout the 
State involved. 
Last week, I was in Fairbanks, and the 
local group there took me out to its cen-
tennial site. The power shovels were 
already working, and men were engaged 
on the job anticipating 1967 and prepar-
ing for the fine celebrations which will 
take place. 
Let me emphasize that the people of 
Alaska are doing their share. Already, 
Fairbanks has made available $1 million 
and they are spending that $1 million 
right now. The people of the little town 
of Sitka, which is a small town, have 
bonded themselves in the amount of 
$400,000, and they are ready to go even 
further if the need arises. This cen-
tennial is intended to be a cooperative 
project. It is not a question of three 
communities engaging in a centennial 
celebration. 
Criteria have been established within 
the bill and, additionally, the Secretary 
of Commerce will establish others. 
There will be close scrutiny before either 
grants or allocations will be made out of 
Federal appropriations. This is not a 
gift that will go automatically to the 
State of Alaska or any community within 
It. The judgment of the Secretary of 
Commerce will prevail insofar as the 
Federal Government is concerned. 
Mr. 'WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. 
President, I am hoping, in the interest of 
more orderly procedure, that the amend-
ment will be accepted. However, if not, 
I believe it is a simple question as to 
whether we do or do not, and I am will-
ing to proceed to a yea and nay vote, and 
therefore suggest the absence of a 
quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll, 
The legislative clerk proceeded to call 
the roil. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. 
President, I ask unanimous consent that 
the order for the quorum call be re-
scinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. HART. Mr. President, I have 
discussed this matter, in the brief pe-
riod of the quorum call, with the dis-
tinguished Senator from Alaska. With 
his concurrence---and I hope I shall not 
disappoint the 16 Senators who voted 
favorably for it, and that they will be 
patient and understanding of the way in 
which we proceed at this moment- ?I 
recommend that the amendment be 
adopted. 
The PRESIDING 0/0/0.1.CER. The 
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment. 
The amendment was agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OloviCER. The bill 
is open to further amendment. 
If there be no further amendment to

An act to provide for United States partici-

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of 
Representatives of the United States of 
America in Congress assembled, That, in

agree. An American citizen still has the 
right to say his piece lawfully. 
Let us note also that there are no 
demonstrations in Peiping or Hanoi in 
opposition to the policies of those gov-
ernments. That is one of the best rea-
sons in the world why the vast majority 
of Americans oppose communism, be-
cause of the very high value which 
Americans place?in many cases beyond 
life itself?on the right to speak out. 
That is very important. I do not 
think it should be inhibited by painting 
with a Communist brush everybody who 
may differ with me or any one else on 
Vietnam. That is a tactic which we 
spurn, and which I fought against in 
the late 1940's and early 1950's. If a 
man or woman is a Communist, he or 
she should be exposed, and we have 
means to do that. But it does not nec-
essarily follow that because a person who 
Participates in protest demonstrations 
against our Vietnamese policy, or par-
ticipates unwittingly in demonstrations 
fomented by Communists, that person is 
a Communist. Our law and traditions 
are that a person is innocent until he is 
proved guilty. 
I support the President's policy in 
Vietnam. I also support the right of 
demonstrators, to protest that policy. 
That is important. But it is also 
important for us to point out that a 
person who wishes to demonstrate must 
not be put in fear of being called a 
Communist unless he fits that descrip-
tion, 
Further, let us remember that there 
are adequate laws on the books to deal 
with those who wish to interfere with 
troop trains, burn draft cards, engage in 
or counsel draft evasion, or participate 
In various other forms of unlawful pro-
test against which our society has a 
right to protect itself. 
I am confident that the laws governing 
conscientious objectors will be found 
ample for those who have feigned or il-
legitimate scruples against military serv-
ice; so that anyone who wishes to engage 
in illegal activities outside the scope of 
the law must take the consequences of 
his actions. No orderly society can exist 
otherwise. 
Anyone who is a Communist should be 
unrelentingly exposed so that other 
Americans who may feel the need to pro-
test do not unwittingly join with Com-
munists in protest to destroy and mar the 
very argument they are trying to make 
to the American people. 
The fundamental right to protest re-
mains. It is our duty to protect it so long 
as it is carried on in accordance with the 
laws of the United States, no matter how 
much we disagree with what is said. 
I am not squeamish about the strong 
language said about the demonstrators. 
They use equally strong language about 
people who follow the President's policies, 
including myself. America is accustomed 
to strong language. 
The point is twofold. We must en-
force the laws in exposing Communists, 
but we must, at the same time, under-
stand that the Bill of Rights assures the 
right to demonstrate and protest. We 
must not paint with a Communist 
brush indiscriminately those who would 
protest, except in accordance with our 
laws and ethics which have been devel-
oped at such great cost over the years. 
I wish to finish by expressing my soli-
darity with the protests and demonstra-
tions which will occur this coming week-
end. The fact, which I believe to be the 
fact, is that the overwhelming major-
ity of the American people are solidly 
with the President in his Vietnam policy. 
In my judgment, that is the only wise 
policy for the United States, 
How we handle that policy in the days 
ahead in terms of what we insist on in 
negotiations and other moves which we 
might make to bring people to the con-
ference table is something, of course, 
about which any of us may have differ-
ing views. The fundamental policy is 
that we must defend freedom in South 
Vietnam with armed force, and within 
limitations, the President has very wise-
ly imposed, while clearly we show the 
willingness to negotiate with anyone at 
any time. This policy deserves the sup-
port of the American people, and I shall 
support it. 
At the same time that I support it, I 
defend the right of those who demon-
strate lawfully to demonstrate for the 
other point of view. 
UNITED NATIONS DAY, 1965 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, this 
Sunday, October 24, has been proclaimed 
United Nations Day in the United States. 
For over 20 years, the United Na-
tions has weathered crisis, insolvency, 
and criticism. The United Nations has 
been?and remains?a reflection of the 
problems and struggles for international 
peace of the world as it is. In a period 
of tension and strain, of hopeful groping 
and rapid change, such as the 20 
years behind us, it is not surprising that 
the world organization should have been 
sensitive to the times. Had it not been, 
we should have known it had lost touch 
with reality. 
The United Nations has not become 
actively involved in every international 
crisis of the last 20 years, but it has dealt 
with many of the most critical. It has 
been cautious, but not overly cautious, 
about its involvement with crises. It has 
often not drawn back from putting its 
prestige on the line. And it has sur-
vived. 
The U.N. faces dangers to its continued 
effectiveness, and to its very life, every 
time it is severely tested. But it should 
not therefore shun the tests to avoid the 
dangers, for this way lies impotence and 
Paralysis. I-am gratified that, on the 
contrary, the U.N. has in recent years be-
gun to tackle ever more difficult prob-
lems of peace?problems which contain 
within them the distinct possibility of 
failure. The U.N. has become more bold, 
and that is good. 
The U.N. rose up from its lowest 
point?the long Assembly deadlock over 
peacekeeping ' assessments?to confront 
the India-Pakistan conflict. It success-
fully defused that explosive situation so 
that an attempt could be made to fashion 
a substantive settlement in relative calm. 
The dispute still simmers dangerously, 
despite the cease-fire, and the U.N. now 
t 27191 
faces one of the most difficult tests in its 
history. It may fail?and that would 
be tragic for the U.N. and for the world. 
But it cannot avoid the issue?it can-
not avoid completely any issue which 
threatens world peace. For it sharpens 
and strengthens itself as it takes on ever 
more delicate tasks. Even when it fails 
to achieve what it sets out to do, it grows 
In sophistication and it devises new 
methods and procedures, and it is gen-
erally the nation which refuses to com-
ply with a U.N. mandate, which sabo-
tages its efforts, or which frustrates its 
purposes, that suffers most in the opin-
ion of mankind. 
I would rather see a vigorous, cour-
ageous, strong, and active U.N. which 
sometimes fails, but never shuns its 
unique responsibilities to mankind, than 
a weak and cautious body, fearful even 
after 20 years that a single failure may 
destroy it. The U.N. should be given con-
stantly new life and vigor and be encour-
aged to act as a more positive and vital 
force for international peace than ever 
before. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Presidential proclamation 
of United Nations Day, 1965, be printed 
in the RECORD at this point. 
There being no objection, the proc-
lamation was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
um.= NATIONS DAY, 1965 
(A Proclamation by the President of the 
United States of America) 
Whereas the year 1965 will mark the 20th 
anniversary of the signing of the United Na-
tions Charter in San Francisco; and 
Whereas the year 1965 has been designated 
by the United Nations General Assembly as 
International Cooperation Year, and I have 
so proclaimed it for the United States; and 
Whereas our own peace and prosperity is 
directly interwoven with the peace, pros-
perity, and development of the rest of man-
kind; and 
Whereas our? future is made more secure 
When we can share with other members of 
the United Nations the responsibility for 
keeping the peace and building a better 
world; and 
Whereas the United Nations, despite many 
difficult problems, is the best organization 
yet devised in which nations can work to-
gether for world peace; for promotion of 
fundamental human rights, justice, and the 
rule of law among nations; and for social 
progress and better standards of living; and 
Whereas it is essential in our democratic 
society to maintain informed public support 
for U.S. policies in the United Nations; and 
Whereas enlightened public opinion in this 
regard requires accurate and timely infor-
mation about the United Nations and its 
large family of agencies whose activities serve 
the United States and all other members; 
and 
Whereas the General Assembly of the 
United Nations has resolved that October 24, 
the date of the coming into force of the 
United Nations Charter in 1945, should be 
dedicated each year to making known the 
purposes, principles, and accomplishments of 
the United Nations; 
Now, therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson, 
President of the United States of America, 
do hereby proclaim Sunday, October 24, 1965, 
as United Nations Day, and urge the citizens 
of this Nation to observe that day by means 
of community programs which will con-

aims, problems, and achievements of the

1\ DEMONSTRATIONS ON UNITED 
STATES VIETNAM POLICY 
Mr. HICKENLOOPER. I wish to say 
to the Senator from New York that the 
last few days I believe some rather in-
teresting developments have been going 
on all over the country. 
I have noticed in the news stories in 
a number of our colleges, where a lot of 
people have alleged there was strong dis-
ruptive influence of one kind or another, 
attempting to tear down the American 
policy, that the students themselves 
have started to take care of this problem. 
I am convinced that 99 percent of the 
students in our colleges are completely 
in accord with the vigorous promotion of 
American policy. But unfortunately the 
people who are satisfied with American 
policy, the one-tenth, are not the noisy 
demonstrators. 
Most of them do not grow beards, or 
things of that kind. They have their 
laundry done regularly. 
But I notice that in colleges the stu-
dents are beginning to ban together to 
put down this irrational activity that 
occurs. 
I received today, for instance, from a 
colleague in my State, which is a semi-
nary for training of ministers, a resolu-
tion. The resolution was allegedly 
unanimous opinion of the student body. 
It was adopted unanimously by the stu-
dent body of the seminary. It com-
pletely endorsed our policy in Vietnam 
and suggested that they did not want us 
to think that the students or the great 
majority of students were joining in 
these demonstrations and fanatical per-
formances which are going on in some 
areas of the country. 
I would not be surprised if these 
demonstrations get noiser, that is, these 
erratic demonstrations in opposition to 
American victory and success in Viet-
nam. 
If the demonstrations continue I would 
not be surprised if the students did not 
take care of the matter themselves. At 
least from what has appeared in the last 
few days it is going to be a very interest-
ing development. 
3 have seen this happen before. I re-
member after World War I we had a 
song, "I Didn't Raise My Boy To Be a 
Soldier" and Peace-at-any-price Troops; 
and they would not fight, and they would 
not do this, or that. 
It is still a minority, hardly big 
enough to call a minority that were 
noisy, but it disappeared eventually. 
I believe our students are really 'very 
sensible and very objective when they 
make up their minds. They will prob-
ably go a long way to take care of this 
situation themselves. 
Mr. JAVITS. The Senator from Iowa 
is a thoughtful man. 
I believe one of the proudest things 
about the American citizen is his feeling 
for civil liberty. I have heard it ex-
pressed in colleges time and time again, 
and also here. 
I agree with the Senator that the 
students will demonstrate overwhelming 
support for the basic policy of the 
Nation. 
I might point out to the Senator, as 
to the 10,000 or 12,000 that demonstrated 
in New York City, that when one con-
siders the size of our population and the 
size of the student population, that is 
not a great number. 
Mr. HICKENLOOPER. I do not know 
too much about New York City. But I 
have seen a lot of student activities in 
my day. One way or another, it is my 
guess that the overwhelming number of 
students that participate in these dem-
onstrations are going along for the ride 
and for the excitement. It is only a 
hard core that is dedicated to this world-
saving purpose which they allege. 
Mr. JAVITS. The Senator is corrrect. 
When there is exposure of those with 
whom they are associated in the purpose 
they are leading themselves, I do not 
want them to withdraw in stubbornness 
because everyone is calling them Com-
munists. 
I believe that as legislators it is our 
duty to hold clear to the basic policy of 
our Government, at the same time as 
we exhibit faith-backing confidence on 
the floor for the young people them-
selves. 
Mr. HICKENLOOPER. I believe the 
youngsters will do a lot to take care of 
this matter. 
The Senator mentioned something 
about conservative. I do not know 
whether these people are conservatives 
or the fringe elements. I believe we are 
all down the middle of the road in 
American policy. 
I draw a distinction between the fun-
damental right to assemble, and even 
protest, which I believe is a basic right 
that must be protected and must be 
maintained, and rabble-rousing mobs 
that incite people to violate the law. 
There has been too much of that in this 
country in the last 2 or 3 years at vari-
ous points. It goes clear beyond the ob-
jective right to peaceable assembly and 
to express oneself. Too often 3 has gone 
over into rabble rousing and mob incite-
ment, resulting in injuries and sometimes 
death. 
Mr. JAVITS. That is exactly our re-
sponsibility?to keep the channels clear 
and to enforce the law. That was the 
purpose of my statement today. 
Mr. HICKENLOOPER. There are 
laws to take care of those things; but 
unfortunately, on so many occasions, the 
officials charged with the responsibility 
to enforce the law have not enforced it. 
Mr. JAVITS. That is our job. 
Mr. HICKENLOOPER. That is an 
administrative responsibility, because the 
laws are already on the books. 
Mr. JAVITS. I understand; nonethe-
less, we have legislative oversight. Our 
views are very important in the country. 
I spoke for the purpose of putting in 
focus support for law enforcement and 
also support for people who legitimately, 
honestly, and peaceably exercise their 
rights under the Constitution. 
Mr. HICKENLOOPER. Do not mis-
understand me. The Senator from New 
York presented his views succinctly and 
powerfully. I am not taking issue with 
them at all. Perhaps I am philosophiz-
ing a bit beyond the bounds of good judg-
ment on the last day of the session. 
Mr. JAVITS. The Senator from Iowa 
Is quite within his rights. He always 
makes an excellent contribution to de-
bate. 
CAIRO ASKS RECORD UNITED 
STATES Hyr,p 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, this 
morning's New York Times indicates that 
President Nasser's United Arab Repub-
lic has made a record request for eco-
nomic aid from the United States, and 
that President Johnson may well be 
waiting for Congress to adjourn before 
announcing his decision because of the 
long history of expressed congressional 
concern regarding Egyptian aid. 
It would seem that the United States 
alternates between being the United 
Arab Republic's chief target for invec-
tive and the United Arab Republic's chief 
object for aid requests. 
While, on the one hand, none of us 
wishes to see the Egyptian people reduced 
to starvation, on the other hand, there 
must be valid questions raised as to 
whether our aid will have the ultimate 
effect of bolstering President Nasser's in-
ternational adventuring at the expense 
of world peace and security, and to the 
detriment of his own domestic economy, 
including the arms race in which he is 
now engaged. 
We must have assurance that our aid 
will not strengthen the Nasserite effort to 
drive our British allies from South 
Arabia and Aden. 
In the Interest of keeping peace in the 
Middle East, all we have now is Nasser's 
pledge to the Arabs to build up his 
strength so that he can, as soon as pos-
sible, pursue his war of extermination 
with Israel. 
Will our aid strengthen this resolve? 
Will the arms race continue and ac-
celerate? 
Will President Nasser again go back 
on his word to withdraw the troops 
which he has maintained at great cost 
In lives and fortune in the Yemen? 
Will United Arab Republic agents con-
tinue to stir up mischief against free gov-
ernments and against the West in both 
Africa and in the Near East? Will the 
United States continue to be a major 
target of the Nasser propaganda ma-
chine both in the United Arab Republic

Ella Gale tells "How to Stretch Your 
Food Dollars" in a meaty chapter. She 
describes in detail how to comparison 
shop, find the stores with the best buys, 
and she urges consumers to arm them-
selves against becoming impulse buyers. 
She warns: 
This kind of buying is a real strain on the 
Income and must be avoided if you are in. 
earnest about stretching your dollars. It is 
easy. Never go shopping unchaperoned. 
Take a shopping list with you and stick to 
it. 
"$$$ and Sense," is bursting with in-
formation on how to save money, or, to 
be more accurate, how to stretch your 
dollar. Her chapter "Buying on Credit" 
Illustrates how you can save as much as 
$57.58 in interest charges when you make 
a $200 purchase on the installment plan. 
She also tells in simple, down-to-earth 
terms how to figure true interest rates. 
Since trading stamps have become a 
problem of concerti to the Congress, h 
chapter On trading stamps is of particu-
lar interest to us in the Congress. She 
says: 
I found it extremely difficult to compare 
an item at the trading store with the same 
thing at one or more discount stores. 
Checking the prices of a nationally ad-
vertised electric iron, it sold for $17.88 
in a discount store, and for 6% books of 
stamps at the trading stamp redemp-
tion center. Figuring the stamps are 
worth $3 per book, the iron cost approxi-
mately $20.25 in trading stamps. She 
concludes with: 
/ checked the large department store in 
town that claims it cuts prices to meet the 
discount store prices. It carried the same 
iron for only $13.98?a $4 saving over the 
discount store. Obviously, the best place to 
buy was the department store, not the trad-
ing stamp center or the discount store. 
In the chapter "Your Dream Home," 
Ella Gale has a 22-point check list for 
new home purchasers. For those who 
want to buy older homes, she not only 
warns of 23 hidden dangers, but lists 
costs and hazards of renovations and 
repairs. 
The book is full of tips--to save dollars. 
There is specific information on how to 
buy sheets, towels, blankets, bedspreads. 
How to select and save on furniture, car-
pets, curtains, and mattresses. She 
carefully describes how to save money 
on electrical equipment and tells under 
what conditions it is better to use a self-
service laundry than to purchase a wash-
ing machine. The food and clothing 
chapters are loaded with information on 
how to buy every kind of canned, frozen, 
ifresh, and packaged food, and every 
item of clothing for men, women, and 
children. She warns of deceptive ad-
vertising, phoney markups, and phoney 
markdowns, and, a subject of interest to 
many of us in the Congress, deceptive 
packaging and labeling. 
According to Ella Gale, if a detergent 
costs, say, $2.15 for 9 pounds, 13 ounces, 
"it still is almost impossible for the aver-
age housewife to determine the best buy 
unless She has a computer or a cost-
weight table." And so, she has included 
in the book a marvelous hew cost-weight 
table, developed by Cornell University. 
Readers of "$$$ and Sense" will be able 
to tell at a glance, the Cost per pound of 
everything from toothpaste to dehy-
drated potatoes. 
This is the first time a book has ap-
peared under the authorship of Ella Gale. 
And, I would like to take this oppor-
tunity to reveal that she is someone 
many of you know, for she has been a 
part of the Washington scene for many 
years. You know her as Ella G. Roller, 
and under this name she is known to 
many of my constituents, since as far 
back as 1948. 
I deem it a pleasure to have had the 
opportunity of bringing to your attention 
Ella Gale's "$$$ and Sense, Your Com-
plete Guide to Wise Buying." It is com-
plete in its coverage, easy to read and 
often 'vely in its style. 
he Protest Marches on Vietnam Policy 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. E. C. GATHINGS 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 1965 
Mr. GATHINGS. Mr. Speaker, patri-
otism is always in style. To honor your 
country, to believe in its heritage and 
hard-won freedom and liberty makes for 
good citizenship. It would be well for 
America's youth to study more about our 
stalwart founders of this Nation. All 
of us could very well do that. Especially 
should this apply to the misdirected, the 
easy mark, the misfit type of humanity 
who oppose the Nation's effort to snuff 
out Communist aggression in southeast 
Asia and elsewhere. 
The marches and demonstrations 
against our country's Vietnam policies 
are shocking and despicable. These 
many demonstrations over a wide area 
do not just happen of their own accord. 
There is concerted organization and 
planning behind them. News media 
broadsided these protest marches since 
it was felt that they were newsworthy. 
The sensational is depicted, whereas 
when a person goes into the armed serv-
ices and does his duty little is said re-
garding his love of country and devo-
tion to the job he is doing. 
The Nation is faced with two extrem-
ist elements. Organized troublemakers 
have been known to join either one or 
both of the movements. 
I believe firmly in the right of assem-
bly and petition. I favor free speech in 
the exercise of one's expression of opin-
ion. I also believe in obedience to the 
law. The destruction of draft cards, the 
flouting of local, State, and National laws 
should result in prosecution and suitable 
punishment. 
Our Nation has consistently urged ne-
gotiations to stop the fighting in Viet-
nam. If these gullible youths want to 
stop the fighting in Vietnam, they could 
very well change the wording of their 
placards and urge that Communist in-
filtration and aggression be ended. 
There should be no doubt about who is 
responsible for the prolonged fighting in 
Vietnam. 
While the press has publicized these 
most deplorable and shocking marches, 
the editorial columns of the papers 
throughout the land rebuke vociferously 
such demonstrations. Campaigns are 
underway by the National Jaycees, vet-
erans organizations, and college students 
on many campuses reverberating their 
support for the Nation's Vietnam policy. 
Rallies are being held on college cam-
puses where previously demonstrations 
were carried on in the interest of our 
pulling out of Vietnam. America will 
not condone the practices being perpetu-
ated by these radical elements. Offen-
sive action to combat them are in order 
and being used effectively. 
The Eisenhower, Kennedy, and John-
son administrations have all fully sup-
ported our Vietnam policies. The best 
course to pursue in bringing peace in 
southeast Asia is the continuation of of-
fensive action on the part of the United 
States, South Vietnamese, and other 
allies who are fighting the Communist 
aggressors. Strength and firmness are 
the only assurances of bringing peace. 
The Arkansas Gazette of October 19 
carried a forceful and timely editorial 
entitled "The Protest Marches on Viet-
nam Policy." I hope my colleagues will 
read this excellent article. It follows: 
THE PROTEST MARCHES ON VIETNAM POLICY 
What is most striking about the weekend 
protests against U.S. policy in Vietnam is 
that those who were shouting and moraliz-
ing in the streets have neither defined ade-
quately what they don't like about American 
involvement nor offered any alternatives to 
fighting the Vietcong other than the impli-
cation that we should effect a humiliating 
withdrawal. Exercise of such an alternative 
would amount to handing southeast Asia to 
the Communists, something the United 
States can never do and expect to retain its 
own and the free world's peace and security. 
The Vietnam fighting is not, of course, a 
war following a declared act of Congress, 
although congressional backing of the Presi-
dent has been close to it. U.S. action there 
Is a military reinforcement of a political 
policy and in that posture any legal and 
peaceful demonstrations?as silly or repug-
nant as they may be?against the policy, 
consistent with the democracy for which our 
men are fighting in Vietnam, must be ac-
cepted by the rest of us. And it must be 
recognized that our engagement in Vietnam 
raises valid questions of national policy that 
should be heard and considered even if, in 
the end, there are still no practicable alter-
natives. 
It was preposterous, on the other hand, for 
a group at Madison, Wis., to attempt a citi-
zens arrest of an Air Force base command-
ant; or for a document to be distributed at 
Berkeley, Calif., saying that draft eligible 
youths might fake homosexuality, or arrive 
at selective service examinations drunk or 
"high" on narcotics or try to bribe doctors 
for certificates of disability. This kind of 
draft-dodging is not only contemptible but 
also might be interpreted as criminal fraud 
to beat the draft laws. When protests take 
the form of the Madison and Berkeley ac-
tions they won't be condoned and cannot be 
Justified. 
In sum, and apart from the possible Com-
munist involvement cited by the Justice De-
partment, the marches reflect the thinking 
of only the tiniest minority of the American 
people. The militant assertion of the anti-
involvement viewpoint benefits only those 
Who wish to prolong the fighting. Commu-

homemakers service, with volunteers to do 
cooking and housework for those families 
that need it in emergencies, and can't afford 
it. A Federal grant and income from fees 
will defray most of the $24,000 cost. 
LEAP has also prevailed on Iowa State Uni-
versity to open up a new homemaking ex-
tension service to needy rural areas which 
will operate through the local antipoverty 
center in Chain Lakes. 
LEAP is working with, the State voca-
tional rehabilitation office, and local busi-
ness groups, on a sheltered workshop, to make 
the handicapped self-supporting. A private 
nonprofit corporation will be formed to set 
up a factory of sorts with the emphasis on 
people, rather than products. This will cost 
about $30,000 with the State giving half. 
LEAP will work with the chamber of conk-
merce in hopes of setting up Cedar Rapids' 
first small business administration center, 
for loans and other help to small or marginal 
businesses. 
For rural areas, there'll be a neighborhood 
council meeting in the Toddville area this 
week, to explain what's involved in securing 
rural family loans for agriculture under ..the 
poverty bill. 
County Social Welfare Director James 
Nisley is working up an eligibility list for a 
work-experience program, to develop job 
skills for heads of households on ADC or 
relief. 
For college students, LEAP is working to 
broaden a work-study program, part-time 
work for needy college students, something 
already underway at Mount Mercy College. 
LEAP officials hope to get something simi-
lar going at Coe College. 
Rural library service was discussed by the 
county supervisors 2 years ago, but dropped 
for apparent lack of interest. As evidence of 
the success of these neighborhood councils, 
leaders in the Chain Lakes area are asking 
for the council to reconsider. 
No application has been made yet for vol-
unteers in service to America, VISTA, as it 
is called, the old Peace Corps at home idea 
Which is the crux of the poverty program in 
some areas, but Nummela has indicated he 
may apply for 2 or 3 to help with senior 
citizens. 
The neighborhood council has worked so 
well in the three areas where it as been 
established, there's interest in getting at least 
two More councils set up in the future. 
All of these programs are in the planning 
or early execution stage. It will take a year, 
perhaps longer, to see what they can do. 
But if they can break the eycle of poverty, 
make more people more productive, it won't 
be just a social victory. Winning even a few 
battles in the war on poverty can provide an 
economic shot in the arm, akin to getting a 
brand new industry. 
Gen. Robert E. Wood Warns Against Re-
lease of Panama Canal Control 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
or 
HON. ROBERT McCLORY 
Or ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 1965 
Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Speaker, Gen. 
Robert E. Wood, who resides in the 12th 
Congressional District of Illinois, is one 
of the most honored Americans of our 
time. 
As a young Army engineer, he served 
for more than 10 years in the Canal 
Zone between March 1905 and May 1915 
as chief quartermaster and director of 
the Panama Railroad Company in con-
nection with the construction of the 
Panama Canal. General Wood knows 
something of the hardship, the sacrifice, 
and the individual effort, genius, and in-
vestment of our Nation which led to the 
successful completion of the Panama 
Canal. 
It is common knowledge that others 
had failed before our Nation succeeded. 
It is also common knowledge that the en-
tire world has benefited from the eco-
nomic, defense, and political advantages 
which have flowed from this great engi-
neering accomplishment. Certainly, 
General Wood knows a great deal about 
the Canal Zone and the formal treaty 
and relationships which have existed 
since the canal was first opened in 1915. 
As my colleague the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania [Mr. Flow] as well as my 
colleague, the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri [Mrs. SULLIVAN] have declared in 
such articulate fashion, any decision to 
abandon our national control of the Pan-
ama Canal should be resisted. MY 
friend, General Wood, has written to me 
that he "Hopes the President will not do 
what was stated in the press." 
He wrote further: 
It may be all right to make some minor 
concessions on payments, but we have been 
more than generous to Panama; and if we 
allow the Panamanians any share whatever 
in the operations and administration of the 
canal itself, it will be a disaster. 
Mr. Speaker, I call these observations 
to the attention of my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives and to the 
President and others in the executive de-
partment as knowledgeable statements 
emating from one who served our Nation 
in the Canal Zone during the long years 
when the Panama Canal was trans-
formed from jungle, rock, and water into 
a gateway joining the Atlantic and the 
Pacific. I hope that the words and rec-
ommendations of General Wood will be 
considered carefully and heeded faith-
fully in any decisions affecting our na-
tional interests and the interests of the 
free world with respect to future owner-
ship, management, and control of the 
Canal Zone and the Panama Canal. 
"$$$ and Sense"?A Best Seller 
SPEECH 
OF 
HON. JOHN A. BLATNIK 
Or MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 1965 
Mr. BLATNIK. Mr. Speaker, I need 
hardly mention to my colleagues that 
despite the remarkable prosperity which 
Our great Nation is enjoying, many 
families are , having difficulty making 
both ends meet. For this reason, I would 
like to bring to your attention an out-
standing book which Fleet Publishing 
Corp., has just released. It is Ella Gale's 
"$$$ and Sense, Your Complete Guide to 
Wise Buying," with a preface by our 
good friend, Senator PHILIP A. HART, of 
Michigan. 
A6061 
In my own congressional district, we 
have many large families, and it is not 
at all unusual to find homes with five 
or more children. And although condi-
tions are improving because of the new 
taconite plants, it is not easy to properly 
feed, house, clothe, and educate a large, 
or for that matter, a small family. This 
problem is not peculiar to my district. 
When the session ends, many of us will 
be going home to face similar conditions. 
It is for this reason that I heartily 
recommend Ella Gale's "$$$ and Sense," 
and would like to take a few minutes to 
describe it. 
This is a book on how to buy wisely. 
It is not a book on budgeting. Ella Gale 
believes that strict budgeting is not only 
difficult in the home, it is the cause of 
much family friction. The difficulty of 
budgeting is something all of us in the 
Congress are well aware of?and?on a 
grand scale. So, as far as family budg-
eting is concerned, Ella Gales says: 
You don't necessarily have to cut to the 
bone to get more out of your income. Nor 
must you set up a budget, a thing most 
families detest. But you do have to plan 
your spending and your saving, and "you" 
means everyone in the family, children in-
cluded. Some of the worst money leaks are 
caused by children whose parents are too 
soft to admit. It's too expensive. 
She warns: 
Mismanaging the family paycheck can 
bring many problems. Often it means a 
needlessly lower standard of living. Always, 
it means doing without some of the things 
the family would like. 
"$$$ and Sense" is jampacked with 
basic information on consumer problems 
and how to solve them. Senator HART 
aptly phrased it in his preface when he 
said: 
The whole gambit of purchasing decisions 
Is covered here?and covered well. Whether 
you absorb one or two new facts?or two 
hundred--I would rate this book as a sig-
nificant contribution to consumer education. 
When Senator HART speaks of the 
whole gambit of purchasing decisions, he 
is not exaggerating. For example, in her 
chapter "How To Save on Household 
Equipment," Ella Gale not only tells how 
to get a good buy, but goes into this kind 
of detail: 
When it comes to demonstrators or floor 
models?stoves are a good buy, electric dish-
washers aren't. 
In the chapter "Cut Your Clothing 
Costs," she says that the best shoe buys, 
especially for children, are those with 
leather tops and synthetic soles. She 
disagrees with shoe people who think the 
most expensive shoes are a must for chil-
dren. She thinks the middle-priced 
shoes are a better buy. Speaking of 
leather uppers, she admits "many syn-
thetics wear longer and cost less than 
leather." But she adds 
I think it's better to have a leather shoe 
that's comfortable than a synthetic that re-
verts to its original shape. 
She recommends clothes that actually 
grow with a child. This new develop-
ment permits the mother to merely pull 
a thread and add inches to coats, trous-
ers, dresses, and underwear for growing 
boys and girls.

nist nations in the past have misread devel-
opments in the West and indications from 
their press and radio reports are that they are 
misinterpreting the protest marches here as 
an expression of widespread feeling among 
the American people that the United States 
should withdraw its forces from Vietnam. 
A central point argued by most of the 
protest groups has been that the United 
States should negotiate a settlement in Viet-
nam. Such an argument ignores the fact 
that our Government has made extensive 
efforts since early in the year to get the 
Communists to the conference table but has 
been rebuffed at every turn. 
It is always necessary to reemphasize the 
validity of protest, within the right of peace-
able assembly, but this does not alter the 
melancholy reality that the demonstrations, 
as misinterpreted in Hanoi and Peiping, make 
the objective of a negotiated peace all the 
more difficult to achieve. 
Oceanography: A New Industry for Mari-
time Exploration and Development 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. ALTON LENNON 
OF isroirrjr CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 1965 
Mr. LENNON, Mr. Speaker, on Octo-
ber 15, Dr. Edward Wenk, Jr., Chief, Sci-
ence Policy Research Division, Legisla-
tive Reference Service, Library of Con-
gress, presented a splendid address be-
fore the American Merchant Marine 
Conference of the Propeller Club of the 
United States in Galveston, Tex. Dr. 
Wenk, with an impressive background in 
engineering and oceanography, and 
former assistant to the President's Sci-
ence Adviser and Director of the Office 
of Science and Technology in the Execu-
tive Office of the President, is one of 
the most highly qualified people I know 
to discuss matters relating to scientific 
activities under Government aegis, par-
ticularly in the fields of oceanography 
and ocean engineering. 
In these times when there seems to 
be so much agitation, even in high Gov-
ernment circles, for an auction sale of 
our national maritime birthright for a 
mess of potage, it is refreshing to hear 
and read the words of Dr. Wenk as he 
places a new perspective on our role in 
the oceanographic environment. 
His carefully thought out and eloquent 
review of the significance of our partici-
pation in all activities and studies relat-
ing to the oceans should be required 
reading for every Member of this body. 
Not limited simply to the purely scien-
tific approach, Dr. Wenk points the way 
In which a broadening in the scope of the 
"maritime industry's strategic plan-
ning?to. engage in engineering funda-
mental to both ocean sciences and re-
source development?might be as re-
warding financially and technologically 
to revitalization of the U.S. merchant 
marine as it is necessary for a vigorous 
ocean science to mature to a productive 
ocean technology." 
Mr. Speaker, I include at this point 
in the RECORD the full text of Dr. Wenk's 
outstanding address: 
A NEW INDUSTRY FOR MARITIME EXPLORATION 
AND DEVELOPMENT 
(By Edward Wenk, Jr., Chief, Science Policy 
Research Division, Library of Congress) 
INTRODUCTION 
Few logbooks of early seafarers have ever 
been found if, in fact, they ever existed. 
And the travels of Leif Eriksen, Marco Polo 
to China, of Christopher Columbus and 
Magellan are remembered as much from 
myth as from recorded history. But to the 
extent that resords were kept, they were 
commercial in content as well as motivation. 
These seafaring explorers were not simply 
excited by the lure of discovery; in most in-
stances, they were extending empires. 
Spurred by nationalistic desires for terri-
torial expansion or the promise of virgin re-
sources, they were charting new trade routes, 
seeking new colonial markets and other 
sources of wealth. 
Whatever fame history now accords these 
swashbuckling adventurers should be under-
stood in terms of the practical purposes of 
their exploration.. It was not until the 19th 
century that the oceans were explored for 
reasons of science. 
To be sure, observations of winds and cur-
rents, waves and tides had been collected 
since man first set sail. But when such 
scientific data began to be recorded system-
atically, they were intended to aid naviga-
tion, improve safety and reliability of ship-
ping. 
The United States was a world leader in 
oceanography in the early 19th century. 
Benjamin Franklin's discovery of the Gulf 
Stream and Matthew Fontaine Maury's 
charts helped our clipper ships outsail all 
competition, and win world trade long before 
our Nation became a world power. 
Oceanography and our maritime industry 
have thus longstanding ties. But oceanog-
raphy has changed; so has our merchant 
marine and shipbuilding industry. When 
sail was replaced by steam, the incentive for 
oceanographic observation persisted only 
with academicians, and its development 
waned. In these evolutions, the two fields 
have split apart. 
In responding to your chairman's invita-
tion to speak. I want to discuss how this ex-
citing field of oceanography contributes to 
the fortunes and goals of this Nation. In 
deveolping this assignment, I hope both to 
abstract some of the poetic attractions of 
marine sciences, and to relate these activities 
to the hard realities of maintaining this 
Nation's stature on the seas. Based on a 
concept of a new industry for maritime ex-
exploration and development, I want to pose 
a question as to whether the shipping indus-
try and ocean technology would mutually 
benefit from restoring an old and valued re-
lationship. 
OCEANOGRAPHY DEFINED 
Oceanography is almost a household word 
today. Every layman understands that this 
field deals with the physical currents and 
waves of the ocean, the many chemicals dis-
solved in or deposited to form the geology of 
the bottom; the infinite variety of flora and 
fauna that feed many of the world's peoples, 
please sportsmen and gourmets. Our imagi-
nation is fired by discoveries of fossil fish, 
of evidence of the drift of continents so that 
we understand better why the scientists have 
turned to the sea to find answers to age-old 
questions about the origin of the earth and 
of life on the planet itself. The sea, in fact, 
is a laboratory where research in physics, 
biology, chemistry, and geology can be con-
ducted by observations of waves and atmo-
sphere, by cores of bottom sediments, by the 
A6063 
capture of plankton and fish whose behavior, 
population, growth, and migration can be 
studied only in relation to the environment 
in which they live. 
KNOWLEDGE FOR PRACTICAL BENEFIT 
Some oceanic exploration is geographic to 
answer questions of "what" and "where"; 
some is scientific to answer questions of 
"why" and "how." But all of these observa-
tions have great meaning to us as citizens 
because they potentially answer practical 
questions. Because they cover 70 percent of 
the earth's surface, it is easy to see why the 
oceans, energized by the sun in a giant heat 
machine, become elements producing weath-
er and climate and a major source of rain-
fall on the continents. 
These same air-sea interaction data are 
also important when routing ships to avoid 
rough voyages, assure ontime arrivals, and 
lower transportation costs. 
Commercial fishermen bring home a world-
wide catch of 60 million tons, yet of 20,000 
known species of fish, only a few are sought 
as food. To restore and expand fisheries and 
thus to meet hunger of so many of the 
world's peoples, it becomes vital to determine 
how the annual catch could be expanded 
without threatening fishery stocks, and to 
identify environmental factors which in-
fluence the distribution and abundance of 
fish. 
The United States has a coastline 13,000 
miles long, exceeded only by that of Canada, 
although much of Canada's coastline is in 
the Icebound Arctic. This seashore is 
clearly valuable property, yet despite its 
length, it is a limited resource that is al-
ready reflecting pressures of a growing urban 
population. Our citizens annually spend 
over one-half billion dollars for salt-water 
fishing, but we continue to regard the sea as 
an infinite pit for the disposal of garbage. 
Other conflicts are growing in multiple sea-
shore use as between sport and commercial 
fishing, sewage disposal, extracting shellfish 
from estuaries, surfing, swimming, or simply 
enjoying a seashore wilderness. All of these 
activities require more facts as a base for 
-legal regulation and wise resource use. 
Off the gulf and Pacific coasts, drilling 
rigs signal the presence of natural gas and 
oil. The vast sums and energies in offshore 
development are well known to the members 
of the petroleum community but are seldom 
recognized by others. While we have ex-
tracted 1.3 billion barrels of crude oil and 
3,700 billion cubic feet of gas offshore, we 
have scarcely tapped these resources. As our 
consumption of fossil fuels increases, geo-
physical explorations must be pushed into 
ever deeper water. Some believe that by the 
year 2,000, 35 percent of the world's oil will 
come from undersea deposits. 
To these few examples, we can add nu-
merous other objectives of practical interest 
requiring knowledge of the sea?to improve 
accuracy of weather forecasting and warning 
of violent storms?to identify ocean mineral 
deposits of sands and unlimited quantities 
of nodules rich in manganese or nickel, lit-
tered widely on the ocean bottom, and to de-
velop methods for recovery?to diminish 
hazards of pollution from atomic, industrial 
or domestic waste?to facilitate discovery of 
new medical and pharmacological weapons 
in the war against disease?to protect 
beaches from erosion, drilling rigs from wave 
damage. 
In reviewing this list of practical benefits 
gained from research, we must not forget 
that whereas the sea is a road to cultural ex-
change and international trade, and con-
tains a host of untold resources, it has been 
and still is a critical strategic component of 
national defense. Maintaining this Na-
ton's security and safeguarding commerce 
from disruption in a national emergency is 
a priority national interest. This paper,

however, will concentrate on anticipated 
peaceful uses of the sea for man's benefits. 
A GLIMPSE AHEAD 
How about the fueure? 
A Jules Verne approach might picture the 
Hudson River humming with GEM commuter 
buses; the smooth Texas shoreline converted 
to an undulating series of habitable marinas. 
Although I have not seen this proposed, por-
tions of the suggested super-speed transit 
system from Boston to Washington might be 
contained in tubes more easily laid along 
the coast, in the Chesapeake Bay and Long 
Island Sound than drilled through solid rock. 
In estuaries, we might find the artificial 
culture of clams and lobsters and beds of 
oysters protected from starfish predators. 
Heavily used bathing beaches no longer 
would be threatened by pollution from sew-
age outfalls because the effluent had been 
treated for reuse by coastal industries at 
low cost. 
Further at sea, a gridwork of automatic 
buoys might sense wind and wave informa-
tion, and when interrogated by communica-
tion satellites feed data into a global metero-
logical network that far more reliably pro-. 
vides warning of hurricanes and typhoons. 
And also at sea we find large manned buoys 
holding station above submarine operations 
with small vehicles serving as elevators for 
men who, learning from SeaLab II exercises 
in 1965, for example, have been found able 
to live and work over long periods of time 
In hundreds of feet of water. Here and there 
also one might find massive platforms that 
pinpoint ocean mining operations thousands 
of feet beneath in a oontinuous system of 
mining and extraction, fed by submerged 
nuclear powerplants whose very efficiency 
may be improved by their location under 
pressure of deep water. In the Great Lakes, 
we note nuclear powered icebreakers, active 
also in Arctic and Antarctic to make these 
areas yield further to man's settlement in a 
hostile environment. And, of course, we see 
heightened world trade with cargo ships in 
a world of developing nations, with many 
more passenger vessels reflecting increased 
leisure made possible in those nations mak-
ing use of industrial automation. 
Whether this be an accurate sketch of the 
future or only a dream, is more a question of 
"when" this becomes a reality rather than 
"whether" it comes true. The future always 
overtakes us faster than we expect, and the 
benefits have nsually gone to those who 
looked ahead. Just such planning equips 
the foresighted to exploit the unexpected. 
An excellent beginning of our study of the 
seas has been made. Thanks to a 10-year 
plan published by the National Academy of 
Sciences in 1958, interest by the Congress 
immediately thereafter, and accelerated 
funding by President Kennedy in 1961, the 
foundation of oceanic sciences necessary to 
realize some of the benefits just outlined 
has been strengthened. Research expendi-
tures have grown from about $25 million an-
nually to over $140 million, half of which 
are Naoy funds. New research ships and 
shore facilities have been constructed; the 
limited base of trained manpower has 
doubled, and for several years, the field bene-
fited from support at the White House level. 
It turns out that the very availability of 
new technologies has been a Major spur to 
oceanographic research: new tools, tech-
niques, instruments, deep diving submarines, 
etc. The opportunity to collect, store and re-
trieve vast quantities of data simultaneous-
ly, and to make intelligent sense out of oth-
erwise subtle relationships was impossible 
before the days of the computer. Radio corn-
raunication now makes possible the collec-
tion of data from many points simulta-
neously so that a synoptic or snapshot view 
of one large sector of the ocean may be taken 
to study currents, the exchange of heat be-
tween ocean and atindsphere, etc. Meteoro-
logical satellites have made possible photog-
raphy of phenomena that may one day per-
mit a new automatic ice patrol that is com-
pletely unmanned. Ocean engineering to 
aid the scientists in their quest is itself a 
new industry. 
The total capability for scientific explora-
tion has been readied. But in fact, have we 
an oceanographic enterprise that recalls the 
purposes of Columbus, Franklin, Maury, or 
has it advanced only to meet the needs and 
opportunities of science? 
BARRIERS TO PROGRP.SS 
Problems characteristic of any growing en-
terprise have appeared, but the most start-
ling has been a leveling off in Federal fund-
ing just as the field seemed ready to mature. 
Funding during the past 3 years has been 
so limited that it hardly permits activation 
of new ships. With science having justifi-
ably received a great fraction of the support 
during early growth years, it now makes a 
claim for priority support in whatever in-
creases appear. With the current plateau 
in policy level support, very little funding 
seems destined for civilian engineering?for 
the steps necessary to transfer scientific dis-
covery to practical application. As a conse-
quence geographical exploration and resource 
development continue at current low levels. 
Is any greater support justified? This de-
pends upon assessment by policymakers, the 
public and special interests as to the poten-
tial of such projects to contribute to na-
tional goals. The case for military defense 
is clear, and we continue to develop our 
scientific-military interests in the oceans 
as insurance against the Soviet submarine 
fleet, although many feel even this is re-
tarded. But in the nondefense sector, we 
have made no national decision, and during 
the last 2 years, this sector has actually 
declined, despite the cold war geopolitical 
and economic implications of Soviet and 
Communist bloc nations to increase their 
control over the seas by intensified use and 
occupation; despite the prospects of devel-
oping fishing and mineral resources, of im-
proving weather forecasts, protecting life 
and coastal property and enhancing recrea-
tional resources. The rate of investment in 
applied research and development has lost 
momentum?if, in fact, it ever had much?
because here, the potential users of such 
knowledge have not made a case for 
strengthening this base of civilian ocean 
engineering. And the executive branch lacks 
any overt policy to take initiative. 
The 89th Congress has been distressed by 
the gap in our maritime resource activities. 
Over 25 different bills have been introduced, 
offering 5 varieties of stimulation to this 
field?approaches that range from a statu-
tory, self-liquidating commission to study 
the problem and make recommendations for 
Presidential action to the other extreme of 
establishing a new superagency. 
All proposals agree on a statement of con-
gressional purpose and policy that this Na-
tion develop vigorous marine sciences and 
technology. Commentaries, however, differ 
as to the causes and alternative remedies. 
These have been mentioned: 
a) Inadequate Federal leadership and ad-
vocacy of marine sciences policy; 
(b) Inadequate policy coordination be-
tween 20 Federal agencies engaged in ocean-
ographic research; 
(c) Inadequate incentives for private in-
vestment, and cooperation between Federal 
Government, the States, industry, and uni-
versities; 
(d) Federal programs that are science-
rather than technology-oriented and that 
subordinate private and public benefits; 
(e) Inadequate Federal staffing. 
Whatever the problem, the fragmentation 
of these objectives has been symbolized by 
a striking lack of industrial interest in a 
remedy. 
October 22, 1965 
FRAGMENTATION: THE NEED FOR A UNIFyING 
CONCEPT 
It must be clear that many scientific dis-
ciplines are involved?physics, chemistry, bi-
ology, and geology. Many different tech-
nologies are involved, as are many institu-
tional groups?universities, business, and 
commerce. Twenty different branches of 
Government have statutory responsibilities 
in one sector or another of oceanography. 
With such numerous and diverse interests, 
it is no small wonder that oceanographic re-
search is debilitated by competition amongst 
goals, amongst resources, amongst organiza-
tions in a field too small to benefit from the 
stimulation of competition. 
About 1 year ago. I proposed that we should 
think of our separate activities in the ocean 
as related to a coherent program of explora-
tion and development. This way, we could 
provide the strengths of unity in our policies 
and programs to correct ignorance about the 
oceans and exploit resources of the sea for 
man's benefit. Without such a concept and 
its adoption as a public purpose, the recent 
acquisition of sovereignty over $00,000 
square miles of ocean bed through an Inter-
national Convention on the Continental 
Shelf ratified in 1964 will become academic. 
But necessary as a unifying concept may 
be, it is not sufficient. Interestingly enough, 
there have been no common incentives that 
would attract this variety of interests to 
examine implications of the ocean as one 
body or to move in concert to advance a na-
tional program in this area. Much, if not 
most, of the momentum has come from in-
trests by the Navy and the vehicle of this 
interest has been the scientific rather than 
the industrial community. 
The maritime industry represented by 
shipbuilders and ship operators has skimmed 
what little information it has needed from 
the oceans but has not conspicuously advo-
cated more intensified research or develop-
ment. 
The immediate problems of this industry 
must be its first concern, but in viewing its 
problems an industry inevitable links its des-
tiny to certain communities of interest. 
This industry, for example, may consider it-
self only a maritime activity in a limited 
sense or it may consider itself a significant 
element of a transportation network. But 
it could also consider itself the linkage be-
tween all of the technological activities in 
the sea. 
THE NEED FOR A maarrnvm EXPLORATION 
INDUSTRY 
To achieve goals in ocean development, or 
any other technically based activity, requires 
a mixture of scientific knowledge, engineer-
ing know-how, capital, manpower, and entre-
preneurship. Then when thls mixture is 
mobilized at explosive proportions, we need a 
spark to ignite it. We have reason to con-
sider the threat of Soviet expansionist aims 
in their trade offensive, and how they are 
combining oceanographic research and fish-
eries interests in a common goal. Yet, this 
Nation that launched a Lewis and Clark 
Expedition in the spirit of geographic ex-
ploration, followed by land grants to acceler-
ate development?mixed with a tradition of 
seapower?now seems lacking in determina-
tion to maintain a position on the seas. The 
spark seems inadequate, notwithstanding in-
tense congressional interest, both in the 
executive branch and in private industry. 
Only the scientific community, and then only 
limited segments, consistently advocate fur-
, therlf.S. growth in ocean sciences. 
To be sure, when economic incentives for 
exploration are ripe, American entrepreneur-
ship has shown no lack of incentive. But 
when economic benefits are marginal or long 
deferred, and important goals in the national 
interest remain, only the Federal Govern-
ment can assume leadership. Since, how-
ever, any development of resources following

SHAME OF AMERICAN INACTION 
on the floor of the House on April 14 of 
this year, when this body was consider-
ing House Resolution 310 which author-
ised the expenditure of funds for the 
additional expenses of the Committee on 
Un-American activities. These funds 
were, as you will remember, to finance 
that committee's Investigation of the 
Ku Klux Klan. 
At that time, I made the following 
statement: 
Let there be no question in anyone's mind 
where I stand on the subject a un-Ameri-
canism. I am opposed to it in any form it 
takes. I think Cludrman Wrza.ns will bear 
me out when I say that I have stood beside 
his committee every time It has been criti-
cized by the extremists of the leftvring. I 
have supported every appropriation request 
and I intend to keep on supporting the 
House Committee on Tfn-American Activities 
as long as they do their job because I am 
opposed to un-Americanism in any form. 
Later, I made this statement: 
I know nothing of their (the Klan's) ac-
tivities in Louisiana or any other State and 
I have no idea what an investigation will 
unearth. but U un-Americanism is suspected. 
then it is my position that an investigation 
should be undertaken. But, It should not 
stop with an investigation of the Klan. 
There are a number of organizations that 
should be put under this same spotlight. 
/ then went on to point out the ob-
vious un-Arnericanism of the American 
Nazi Party and the Black Muslims. 
In conclusion, I made this point and 
it is the point I wish to make again 
today: 
Let it (an investigation) be a starting 
point but by no means, the entailing point. 
Before we are -through let us see what is 
under the rocks of all these other groups 
as well. 
This was the conclusion of my state-
ment. 
I believe the time has now come to 
undertake that continuing search under 
the rocks. 
The newspapers have been filled in the 
past week or so with stories concerning 
the anti-Vietnam demonstrations which 
have been gaining momentum here in 
this country and abroad in the past 
weeks. These demonstrations have 
taken the form of attempts to arrest 
military commanders, burning of draft 
cards, picketing of draft boards, and 
similar publicity stunts. 
The principal force behind these acts 
is, apparently, a group calling itself the 
"Students for a Democratic Society." 
I am mystified as to where they got 
that title since they are, principally, 
beatniks and unbathed delinquents 
rather than students: they certainly have 
no belief in democracy and they are a 
rabble instead of a society. 
I would like to make it Perfectly clear 
that it is not my belief nor is it my posi-
tion that anyone disagreeing with our 
Policy in Vietnam is either a Communist 
or a Communist dupe. Certainly there 
are many who question our presence in 
Vietnam and the wisdom of past and 
Present moves. But these are loyal 
Americans who hold an honest difference 
of opinion to which they are entitled. 
Let it be clear that I am talking about 
those particular demonstrations of the 
and the others associated with, it. 
was encouraged to read the Presi-
dent's denunciation of these anti-
American activities and also to know that 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation is 
Interested in the Communist involvement 
that undoubtedly exists. 
I note, too, that, earlier this week, the 
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee 
declared that these demonstrations have, 
and I quote, "clearly passed into the 
hands of Communist and extremist ele-
ments." 
That committee took the same posi-
tion I mentioned earlier, that the great 
majority of persons who differ with our 
Miler In Vietnam are loyal Americans. 
But the group I tun talking about has 
failed to prevent, limit, or control the 
Communist domination that now exists 
In this movement. 
Unfortunately, these young men and 
women have been encouraged by self-
appointed intellectuals both in and out 
of Government, who, from their lofty 
Ivory towers have for months now as-
sailed the President. the Congress, and 
the Department of Defense for our strong 
stand against the proliferation of corn-
muniam in Asia and elsewhere. 
When responsible Federal officials, for 
Instance, rise to impeach this Nation, to 
speak from offices of major importance 
against the military Policy of our Gov-
ernment, when professors who are ad-
mitted Marxists are kept on the payroll 
of colleges when civil rights leaders dare 
the unqualified gall of advising our Am-
bassador to the United Nations, is there 
any wonder that young men and women 
follow In their misguided steps? 
These self-proud pacifists are the same 
leaders, and these bearded beatniks axe 
the same followers who have dominated 
the race riots, demonstrations, lawless-
ness, and strife that have ripped this Na-
tion apart for a number of years. The 
roll call of one group would find the same 
members present as would a roll call of 
the other. Though there are some who 
are able, In this instance, to see the ,Red 
hand in these anti-Vietnam demonstra-
tions, they were never able and they are 
still not able to see the same influence 
and the same leadership infiltrated and 
controls now the civil rights attack Won 
the Nation. 
Perhaps then, this. will provide theln 
the evidence and give them an opportu-
nity to reexamine their thoughts as to 
who are the promoters, who are the Dress 
sifters, and who has benefited from the 
past and present civil rights strife. 
In the sure conviction that they are 
one and the same, the Communists, I 
am today introducing a bill to author-
ize the Committee on Un-American AC-
tivities to conduct an investigation and 
study of the organization known as 
Students for a Democratic Society and' 
the extent and character of its involve-
meat in the current derniOnstmtlons re-
lating to official 'MS. policy lnliletnani. 
It is my hope that those Members Who 
supported House Resolution 31%. as, 
did, will now demonstmte that they have 
an equal concern over the activity ot 
this anti-American group and its fol-

The !WEAKER pro tempore. Upon 
previous order of the -House, the gen-
tleman- from liew 'rods (Mr. HA5PIN/2n 
Is recognized for 15 minutes. 
Mr. HALPERN. Mr. Speaker, we are 
confident that this first session of the 
89th Congress will be known for its legis-
lative accoMplishments. We have acted 
upon a great many substantive bssuest 
which for mant years have undergone 
sustained debate. 
And- yet in this year 196% it rattans 
a source of particular disappointment 
and irons that the Congress has con-
sistently failed to officially reopen con-
sideration of the Genocide Convention.' 
Last February I introduced -a House 
resolution urging U.S. ratification Of the 
Genocide Convention, and have rePeat-
edly urged its passed as a means of 
rally-
tog official opinion behind this Important 
document. The Convention Mill rests 
before the Senate Foreign 'Relatione 
Committee which, since its first and only 
consideration in 1950, has subsequently 
denied further hearing. 
It is incomprehensible to me that this 
treaty has stirred so many misgivings, 
and that because of unfounded fear the 
Senate has net given Its advice and con-
sent. More than 65 nations have an-
proved the Convention, including the So-
viet Union. We are supposedly a civil-
ized state, with a constitutional and in-
herent respect for human rights, and yet 
we have failed . to take this one 'step to 
generalize certain protections which are 
recognized in our own national statutes. 
Briefly, parties to the Genoeide Con-
ventlon pledge to wettest and tarnish 
the crime of genocide, which is defined 
as an act committed with the-Intent to 
destroy wholly or partially a national, 
ethnic, racial, or religious group. This-
may' take the form of killing members 
of a group, causing them phytdcal or 
mental harm, inflicting conditions. cal-
culated to bring about destruction of a 
group, and so forth. Aocused personaare 
US be prosecuted in the stet. where the 
offense is comntitteed, and parties to the 
treaty must enact legislative Implement-
ing machinery if nedessary. 
The Motivation for this document was. - 
of course; the Nazi -outrage against all-' 
lion--Jews end 2-million Polish althea, 
perpetrated before' and tinting World 
War IT dating the Hitler feginie. Arid

of these oomurences which prompted the

which men saw as a mean& Of Prevent-

this most impo covenant. purpose, and thereby help to generate 
Discussion regarding the provisions of 
the pact ha e bogged down in e hopeless 
academic quagmire which obscures the 
essentials. I do not deny that the text 
raises pertinent questions as regards the 
effect on our Federal-State relationship. 
personal rights, the power of Congress, 
and sovereignty. But these legal consid-
erations are not insurmountable, and 
they should not be made a subterfuge for 
inaction. The protective intent of the 
convention is fax too important to per-
mit a wholesale retreek from principle. 
Under the treaty, we would certainly 
undertake concrete respongbilitles and 
obligations such as the other nations 
have agreed to accept. The full import 
of the convention is, of course, intimate-
ly allied with our own legal and consti-
tutional framework, guaranteeing the 
Individual rights and freedoms which are 
Inviolate. ? It is unquestionable that the 
protections conferred by the convention 
are for the most part guaranteed by our 
domestic law. Hence the complexities 
and contradictions which opponents pro-
fess to discern are not substantive and 
should not be considered as real 
obstacles. 
It is equally true that our failure to act 
positively on this matter has injured. 
or at least blurred, the impression of 
human justice and moral underpinning 
which we insist upon claiming before the 
docket of world public opinion. It is not 
wholly convincing to argue that others 
have a responsibility to consider human 
and moral prerogatives when the United 
States will not undertake international 
treaty obligations consistent with this 
Imperative. The official reticence to re-
open meaningful debate on this subject 
is truly appalling, and reflects adversely 
on the foreign policy goals we have set 
for ourselves. 
It was a particular pleasure and in-
spiration for us to welcome the Pope to 
the United Nations during this General 
Assembly session. He pleaded to the 
statesmen of the world to devote their 
energies toward the construction of a 
stable peace end conditions of human 
justice. And in this seareh.notbing is 
more important than the achievement of 
common agreements between nations, 
agreenp3nts which seek to prevent the 
erueltiee of the past that have scarred 
human history. The Genocide Conven-
tion forms a part of this essential task. 
This covenant is one of the great items 
of unfinished business in the foreign 
policy arena, a matter of overriding con-
cern to mankind. 
The United States can no longer af-
ford indecision on an issue of such grave 
consequence. We are all agreed that 
group persecution at racial and religious 
minorities Is an outrage of such ter+. 
rible dimension that constructive steps 
must be taken to prevent and punish it 
as an international crime. This 'is the 
purpose of the Genocide Convention, and 
our official hypocrisy and apparent in-
difference in an affront to human 
dignity. 
It should be a matter of priority for 
the effective public opinion which the is-
sue demands. It is imperative that the 
legislature press vigorously for affirma-
tive action when we reconvene next 
January.

Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Speaker, there'

this country who quietly and effectively.. 
promote the general welfare through the

unheralded in their work and yet their 
accomplistunents are noteworthy and 
they should receive the commendation 
of their fellow man. 
One of these gentlemen is A good

past year as International Director of 
the Liens Clubs. I myself am a member 
of the Johnstown Lions Club and have 
always been proud of this association 
although I must freely admit that my 
contribution has been small indeed by 
comparison with the service club giants 
such as Homer Hoover. Mr. Hoover re-
tired earlier this year as manager of the 
Sears, Roebuck Sr Co. retail store at 
Wooster after more than 20 years of 
service. He is a conununitY leader in his 
own right in addition to his service club 
activities and is the chairman of the 
1985 United Community Fund for Wayne 
County. 
Homer Hoover has traveled through-
out the length and breadth of this land 
spreading the gospel of Lionisre, He 
has traveled to many foreign countries 
In this capacity and is a living example 
of the fine precepts of this organization.
