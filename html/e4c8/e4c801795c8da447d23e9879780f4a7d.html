Political, sociological, and economic data, including monetary 
conversion rates, generally reflect information through mid-October 
1973, except for population estimates, which have been projected to 
1 January 1974. Military manpower estimates are as of 1 January 1974 
except for average number of males reaching military age, which 
are projected averages for the 5-year period 1974-78. Military and 
communications data are as of 31 October 1974 unless otherwise indicated. 
Most of the land utilization estimates are rough approximations, 
and most of the statistical data are rounded (thousands and millions). 
Figures for "arable" may reflect only the area actually under crops 
rather than the potential cultivable. Fishing limits are included 
only when they differ from the territorial limits. 
For some countries GDP, rather than GNP, is shown. The difference 
between the two is in the addition or subtraction of the value of 
return on foreign investment. GDP equals GNP plus income earned 
in the country but sent abroad, minus income earned abroad but 
sent into the country. GDP thus tpnds to exceed GNP in debtor 
countries, and the reverse is true in creditor countries. 
Major ports are the largest maritime ports of the country, 
relative to other ports of the same country, on the basis of 
estimated port capacity, alongside berthing accommodations, and 
commercial or naval importance. Minor ports are the remaining ports 
of a country which have, relative to the major ports, significantly 
lower estimated port capacity, fewer alongside berthing accommodations, 
are of less commercial or naval importance. Major transport aircraft 
are those weighing over 20,000 pounds. Military budgets are in U.S. 
dollar equivalents. The dollar sign refers to U.S. dollars unless 
otherwise stated. The abbreviation FY stands for U.S. fiscal year; 
all years are calendar years unless otherwise indicated.

port serves also as important supply depot for fuel, water, and ships' wares. 
Recently built dockyards and machine shops provide maintenance and repair 
services to 3,500-4,000 vessels that call at Gibraltar each year. 
U.K. military establishments and civil government employ nearly half the insured 
labor force. Local industry is confined to manufacture of tobacco, roasted 
coffee, ice, mineral waters, candy, and canned fish. Some factories for 
manufacture of clothing are being developed. A small segment of local 
population makes its livelihood by fishing. In recent years tourism has 
increased in importance.

ECONOMY: 
Principal economic activities of San Marino are farming, livestock raising, light 
manufacturing, and tourism; the government's total budget for FY71 was about 
$12 million, with the largest share of revenue derived from the sale of 
postage stamps throughout the world and from payments by the Italian 
government in exchange for Italy's monopoly in retailing tobacco, gasoline, 
and a few other goods; main problem is finding an additional $3 million to 
finance badly needed water and electric power systems expansions 
Agriculture: principal crops are wheat (average annual output about 4,400 metric 
tons/year) and grapes (average annual output about 700 metric tons/year); 
other grains, fruits, vegetables, and animal feedstuffs are also grown; 
livestock population numbers roughly 6,000 cows, oxen, and sheep; cheese 
and hides are most important livestock products 
Electric power: obtained from Italy 
Manufacturing: consists mainly of cotton textile production at Serravalle, brick 
and tile production at Dogane, cement production at Acguaviva, Dogane, and 
Fiorentino, and pottery production at Borgo Maggiore; some tanned hides, 
paper, candy, baked goods, Moscato wine, and gold and silver souvenirs are 
also produced 
Foreign transactions: dominated by tourism; in summer months 20,000 to 30,000 
foreigners visit San Marino every day; a number of hotels and restaurants 
have been built in recent years to accommodate them; remittances from 
Sanmarinese abroad also represent an important net foreign inflow; commodity 
trade consists primarily of exchanging building stone, lime, wood, chestnuts, 
wheat, wine, baked goods, hides, and ceramics for a wide variety of consumer 
manufactures 
COMMUNICATIONS: 
Railroads: none 
Highways: about 65 mi. 
Civil air: no major transport aircraft 
Airfields: none 
Telecommunications: automatic telephone system serving 3,200 telephones; no
