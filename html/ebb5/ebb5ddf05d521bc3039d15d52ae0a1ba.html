 Cambodia: The Mayaguez Incident
 The Cambodian communist seizure of the
 US merchantman Mayaguez has resulted in the
 first serious foreign policy reversal for the new
 Cambodian government since it came to power
 in mid-April.
 The  Cambodians  had  stopped  a  Pana-
 manian vessel on May 9 and had harassed several
 other, mostly smaller, craft. On May 12, their
 patrol boats fired on the Mayaguez, bringing the
 ship to a halt as it was moving on the regular
 shipping route from Hong Kong to the Thai port
 of Sattahip. This route passes within about eight
 miles of Poulo Wai Island, some 60 miles from
 the mainland. The day after boarding the Maya-
 guez, the Cambodians forced it to sail to Koh
 Tang Island, only 30 miles from the mainland.
 At Koh Tang, the ship anchored, and the crew
 was taken to the island and kept there until the
 14th, when they were transported to the main-
 land. This at least indicated that the Cam-
 bodians appreciated the value of the crew's lives,
 if only as hostages for possible bargaining.
 Cambodian  communist  motivation
 throughout the incident remains unclear. There
 are a number of islands off the coast that have
 been claimed for a long time by both the Viet-
 namese and the Cambodians, and it appears that
 the latter have been using their newly captured
 patrol boats to establish a presence on the is-
 lands on behalf of the new regime. It appears
 that the Cambodians, who only recently had
 expelled virtually the whole foreign community
 from Phnom Penh and emptied the city of its
 population, decided that harassing international
 shipping in adjacent waters would be a good
 way to reinforce their claims to the islands,
 although the new government has yet to de-
 scribe its claims with any precision. It is not
 clear whether the new central authorities had
 any forewarning that the Mayaguez was being
 boarded and the crew seized.
 The Cambodians' announcement on May
 15 that the Mayaguez would be released ap-
 parently was prompted by a realization that
 their territory and installations would be vulner-
 able to punitive attacks if they failed to respond
 Five Cambodian communist patrol boats
 guarded the Mayaguez soon after it arrived at
 Koh Tang, and they were soon exchanging fire
 with US aircraft sent to help in securing the
 return of the ship and crew. Three of the patrol
 boats were sunk in the ensuing action.
 On May 15, following a quick transfer of
 US forces to the area, US Marines landed on the
 Mayaguez and took control. Other marines
 landed on Koh Tang Island and engaged the
 Cambodians there while air strikes hit Cam-
 bodian installations on the mainland. At vir-
 tually the same time, the Cambodian gov-
 ernment radio announced that the ship would
 be returned. Within hours, a Thai fishing vessel
 captured earlier sailed under a white flag to the
 USS Wilson and returned the crew in good
 health.

 to US demands. Moreover, the new regime pre-
 sumably recognized that the capture of the ship
 had not been supported by Peking, Hanoi, or
 any other sympathetic foreign governments.
 Chinese leader Teng Hsiao-ping's comment
 in Paris that China would not be able to help if
 the US responded with force was not replayed
 from Peking, but neither was it modified or
 supplanted by statements more encouraging to
 Cambodia. The Yugoslavs' subsequent reference
 to the "kidnaped" ship and the French press
 comment that President Ford had little choice
 but to respond firmly reflected the trend of
 foreign opinion against the Cambodians.
 The Cambodian announcement was care-
 fully worded and defensive in tone, although
 much of its rhetoric was designed to justify the
 seizure as a reasonable precaution against the
 possibility that the ship was engaged in es-
 pionage.
 Despite broad recognition that the Cam-
 bodians had provoked the US to act, the first
 criticism of the US attacks came quickly from
 Bangkok. The Thai do not disapprove of the
 forceful recapture of the Mayaguez, but they
 believe that US actions have compromised their
 efforts to establish a good relationship with the
 new communist regime in Cambodia. Prime
 Minister Khukrit has asked his Foreign Ministry
 to recommend ways to make a very strong
 response to convey Bangkok's displeasure. Thai
 newspapers, within hours of the attacks, were
 recommending that the government refuse the
 credentials of Ambassador Whitehouse, who has
 just arrived in Bangkok, recall the Thai ambas-
 sador from Washington, and shut down all US
 bases forthwith.
 Although the Chinese had issued no state-
 ments from Peking before the US action, Vice
 Premier Li Hsien-nien has told a banquet audi-
 ence that Cambodia's measures against the
 Mayaguez were a legitimate safeguard of state    25X1
 sovereignty, and he claimed that world opinion
 should consider the recapture of the vessel as an
 "outright act of piracy."
 Laos: Rightists Routed z- 3
 The rightist faction of the 13-month-old
 coalition government has collapsed, and the
 Pathet Lao now represent the only effective
 bloc power in the country.
 Totally demoralized  by communist vic-
 tories in South Vietnam and Cambodia, by the
 virtual impotence of the Royal Lao Army in the
 face of limited Pathet Lao attacks in northern
 Laos, and by the eruption of communist-
 inspired civil disorder in every major city in
 their zone of control as well as in the "neu-
 tralized" twin capitals of Vientiane and Luang
 Prabang, almost all leading rightist political and
 military leaders have fled the country or re-
 signed their positions. The neutralist faction of
 the tripartite coalition remains intact, but along
 with  its  leader-Prime  Minister Souvanna
 Phouma-appears essentially powerless.
 Communist Deputy Prime Minister Phoumi
 Vongvichit has repeatedly stated that the Pathet
 Lao will continue to work within the framework
 of the 1973 Lao peace accords, which pre-
 sumably means that they might be prepared-for
 the time being, at least-to retain the facade of a
 coalition. Indeed, they are probably anxious to
 have Souvanna stay on as prime minister if only
 to give their political take-over a strong sense of
 legitimacy. Moreover, their recent gala reception
 of Lao King Savang in Sam Neua suggests that
 the monarchy may also be retained.
 An acid test of the Pathet Lao's attitude
 toward preservation of the coalition will come
 when replacements for recently ousted rightist
 cabinet ministers are selected. Under the terms
 of the  1973 accords, the various coalition
 parties are entitled to fill vacancies in ministries

 have now shifted their attention to the US
 presence in Laos. Over the past week, increas-
 ingly hostile communist-inspired demonstrations
 have been mounted against the US embassy in
 Vientiane and against USAID installations and
 personnel in Savannakhet and Luang Prabang.
 The minimum communist objective ap-
 pears to be the elimination of USAID- and other
 American .organizations from provincial areas. If
 Phoumi's statements are any criteria, the Pathet
 Lao may be willing to tolerate, for the moment
 at least, a reduced US official representation in
 Vientiane. The communists also appear willing,
 and in some cases even anxious, to receive
 unconditional US assistance, providing the aid is
 channeled directly to the coalition government
 which now is effectively under their control.

 under their control with personnel from among
 their own ranks. Pathet Lao Deputy Defense
 Minister Khammouane Boupha, however, has
 already been named "acting" defense minister
 in place of rightist Sisouk na Champassak, and
 this could set a precedent for communist per-
 sonnel to replace all of the ousted rightist
 ministers. Indeed, several days prior to Boupha's
 appointment, Souvanna asked his deputy,
 Phoumi, to determine whom the Pathet Lao
 high command in Sam Neua wanted to fill the
 vacuum created by the departed conservatives.
 In any case, it seems certain that whatever
 personalities are eventually chosen will be to-
 tally subservient to Sam Neua's wishes.

 political and military power, the Pathet Lao

 tightened up, and persons arrested for using
 weapons against the police would be prosecuted
 more expeditiously.
 The Socialists are divided over the pro-
 posals. The majority reluctantly accept the
 package, but an influential minority on the left
 maintains that the measures would threaten civil
 liberties and ignore what they view as the pre-
 dominantly fascist origin of most serious vio-
 lence. This group went along only after the
 other parties agreed to cosmetic changes that
 give the proposed law an anti-fascist cast. The
 fact that votes of the neo-fascists helped over-
 come combined Socialist-Communist opposition
 to  the  bill's toughest provisions probably
 strengthened the Socialists' resolve to amend the
 bill in the Senate. If they succeed, final action
 would be difficult before Parliament recesses
 next week. In any event, the debate over law-
 and-order is sure to remain a central theme of
 the election campaign.
 ITALY: PRE-ELECTION POLITICS
 4-7
 The  Italian  Parliament will  recess next
 week in order to campaign full time for nation-
 wide regional and local elections on June 15.
 The last few sessions are likely to be stormy,
 however, as the Moro government tries to secure
 Senate approval of its proposals to deal with
 rising crime and political violence.
 The anti-crime package was passed last
 week by the lower house but only after a divi-
 sive debate that accentuated differences be-
 tween the Socialists and their coalition partners.
 The proposals generally give the police a freer
 hand in combating street violence. They would
 be able, for example, to conduct on-the-spot
 searches of suspicious persons without obtaining
 the usual authorizations. In addition, the use of
 "provisional liberty"--a form of bail-would be

 strategy for the campaign. In addition to casting
 his party as the major proponent of strict law
 enforcement, Christian Democrat chief Fanfani
 is continuing to emphasize his opposition to any
 cooperation with the Communists at the na-
 tional and local levels. Sharp differences persist
 among the Christian Democrat factions, how-
 ever, and these are likely to erupt into a full-
 scale leadership struggle if the party does poorly
 in June.
 The leftist factions are still opposing Fan-
 fani's approach to the elections, and differences
 between  Fanfani and other major Christian
 Democratic leaders, such as Prime Minister Moro
 and Foreign  Minister  Rumor, seem to be
 sharpening. As part of his strategy to attract
 support on the right, Fanfani this week sug-
 gested that his party consider alternatives to
 collaboration with the Socialists, such as a
 centrist government in which the Socialists
 would be replaced by the small and conservative
 Liberal Party. Moro, however, is striving to keep

 states on common commercial policy, and, the
 EC hopes, induce East European states to deal
 similarly with the EC. Thus far, the USSR has
 succeeded in heading off bilateral talks by ini-
 tiating discussions between the Communist   25X1
 states' economic grouping, CEMA, and the EC.
 Peking, of course, is also hopeful that its
 actions strengthen the EC's hand in dealing with
 Eastern Europe and that Moscow's hold in that
 area can be loosened-at least marginally. The
 Chinese see their new arrangements with the EC
 primarily as a means of consolidating political  25X1
 ties with Western  Europe and giving them
 greater leverage in their own dealings with the

 EC-CHINA: SOAMES SUCCEEDS
 China agreed  last week to establish a
 formal relationship with the European Com-
 munity and to accredit a representative to EC
 headquarters in Brussels. The announcement
 came after EC External Affairs Commissioner
 Soames visited Peking. In talks with senior
 Chinese foreign affairs and trade officials,
 Soames satisfied Peking that the EC had no
 official relationship with Taiwan and that EC
 members accepted Peking's view of Taiwan's
 status. Soames was then received by Premier
 Chou En-lai, a visit which exceeded the require-
 ments of protocol and which reflected Chinese
 enthusiasm for a relationship with the EC.
 The Chinese also began exploratory talks
 on a trade agreement with the EC, which, if
 concluded, would probably carry provision for
 most-favored-nation treatment and a nonpref-
 erential trade system. These talks are to con-
 tinue in Brussels.
 Both sides have strong political motivations
 for a trade agreement. It would imply Chinese

 CSCE: THE CRUNCH IS ON
 Most delegations at the European security
 conference believe that the next few weeks in
 Geneva will be crucial ones. If the conference is
 to conclude this summer-as the Soviet and vir-
 tually all other delegations hope--many issues
 will have to be resolved in a relatively short
 time. Activity has now increased perceptibly,
 some issues have been settled, and a working
 group has begun planning for a final summit-
 level meeting.
 Moscow is apparently counting on the
 Western participants to give up trying to get
 concessions on a number of issues. The Soviet
 negotiators have recently shown flexibility on
 some matters, but they have stalled on others
 and even reopened debate on several considered
 settled months ago. The West European dele-
 gations are having difficulty matching the deter-
 mination and resolve of the Soviet Union.
 The Soviets recently accepted a French
 compromise that ended a long deadlock on the
 declaration of principles, which the conference
 has been formulating for guiding international
 relations. The Soviet acceptance opens the way
 for the conferees to conclude their work on this
 part of the so-called Basket 1.
 The conference has yet to agree, however,
 on the wording in the declaration of principles
 of a so-called saving clause. This is a statement
 implying that the rights and responsibilities of
 the US, UK, France, and the USSR in Germany
 and Berlin are not affected by the conference's
 decisions. Many of the neutral delegations are
 trying to change the present draft, considering it
 too vague and an affirmation of the "Brezhnev
 doctrine." The Western powers are amenable to
 change, but the Soviets may limit alterations.
 The Soviet negotiators have also displayed
 a certain degree of flexibility on one of the
 major  military-related "confidence-building
 measures"-but only after the Western and
 neutral delegations made an important con-
 cession. The Soviets said that they could accept
 the Western idea of providing advance notice
 about  national  and  multinational  military
 maneuvers if the notification were given on a
 voluntary basis. The Western and neutral states
 accepted this Soviet proposal as a "working
 hypothesis," but still have to determine how
 much advance notification should be given and
 the size and location of the maneuvers that
 would be affected.
 In contrast to their flexibility on "prin-
 ciples," the Soviets have drawn the line on
 matters concerned with the freer movement of
 people and ideas. The Western negotiators now
 plan to present a single text covering all such
 topics. They contend that this would put maxi-
 mum pressure on the Soviets to come to reason-
 able terms at a time Moscow may consider
 optimum for working out a deal. Past behavior
 suggests that the Soviets will test the West's
 resolve by continuing to stall.
 Another point to be settled is the type of
 follow-on machinery to be established. The
 Soviets formally support a Czechoslovak pro-
 posal to create a post-conference consultative
 committee with a broad mandate to discuss
 issues affecting security and cooperation in
 Europe. The committee would have a per-
 manent secretariat. This is an objectionable
 feature as far as the West is concerned. The
 Soviets themselves have cooled to the idea,
 perhaps out of concern that the West could use
 the proposed committee to hold them to ac-
 count on the implementation of the con-
 ference's agreements.
 The Western delegations formally support
 Denmark's proposal for senior officials to meet
 three years after the conference ends in order to
 assess the results and decide whether further
 meetings are necessary. The West Europeans,

 however, are sharply split on the issue. The
 Dutch, Belgians, and French advocate as little
 follow-on activity as possible, while the British,
 and now even the Danes, are prepared to accept
 relatively frequent meetings of experts and
 senior officials. On this and other issues, the
 NATO allies are hoping that the US might take
 the lead.
 ROMANIA AND THE NONALIGNED  14-146
 Romania's relations with the USSR will be
 further strained if Bucharest is successful in its
 quest for observer status at a conference of
 nonaligned foreign ministers in Lima later this
 year. Romania had sought admission as an
 observer to the fourth nonaligned summit in
 Algiers in 1973 but did not succeed, partly
 because of a rebuff from the Yugoslavs. Since
 then,  President Ceausescu has persistently
 stressed the rights of developing states and the
 common interests of Romania and the non-
 aligned world. He has also received and visited
 scores of Third World leaders.
 The Romanians now seem to have won
 Yugoslav endorsement for their nonaligned bid.
 The communique at the conclusion of Foreign
 Minister Macovescu's visit to Belgrade from
 April 28 to 30 implied Yugoslav support, and
 there are indications that the Yugoslavs are
 encouraging Romania to seek backing from such
 nonaligned countries as Algeria, Egypt, and
 Mexico. Ceausescu's sudden two-day visit to
 Syria and Egypt late last month was in part
 intended to press Bucharest's case.
 Romania's party secretary for foreign rela-
 tions has privately admitted that "some" non-
 aligned states are resisting Bucharest's efforts to
 achieve observer status. He said these countries
 fear that Romania's admission, even as an ob-
 server, might open the door for other, more
 "aligned" states to intrude.
 Should Romania achieve observer status,
 new tensions would be added to Soviet-
 Page   7  WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Romanian relations. For instance, Bucharest
 would be associating itself with such nonaligned
 concepts as the division of the world into the
 "haves" and "have nots." These formulations
 are anathema to the men in the Kremlin, who
 insist on viewing international relations in the
 strict doctrinal framework of class struggle.
 To reduce the risk, the Romanians have
 carefully couched much of their case in the
 Kremlin's own language endorsing nonalignment
 and are clearly banking once again on correctly
 reading the limits of Soviet tolerance. Ceausescu
 has apparently decided that if even a tenuous
 link with the nonaligned movement can be
 established, Bucharest will be better able to
 cou,iter future pressure to conform to the
 Kremlin's policies.

 V-E DAY CELEBRATION
 Soviet Solemnity...
 Soviet government and party leaders at Lenin's tomb for V-E Day ceremony
 The Soviet buildup of the 30th anniversary
 of V-E Day was months in the making, and
 inevitably it got Moscow into some hot water
 abroad and into some sensitive areas at home.
 Last week the celebrations finally took place,
 but they did not fully answer the question of
 why all the bother in the first place. The answer
 may rest in the emotions of an aging leadership,
 and a people, for whom World War 11 was both
 trauma and triumph. It was an opportunity to
 remind the younger generation of what the war
 was about and of how far the Soviets have come
 since 1945.
 The main event was a "solemn" meeting in
 the Kremlin Palace of Congresses on May 8,
 where Brezhnev gave the keynote speech, long
 on rhetoric, to a large gathering of Soviet and
 foreign dignitaries. He managed to put in a good
 word for the Yugoslavs to help undo the damage
 of earlier statements that slighted their contribu-
 tion to the war effort.
 He made no special effort to be kind to the
 US, but did make a pitch for disarmament and
 detente. Although  Brezhnev failed to repeat
 Minister of Defense Grechko's earlier formula-
 tion about the "possibility of political and mili-
 tary cooperation between states with differing
 social systems," something close to this idea was
 included in his message to President Ford.
 Brezhnev managed to avoid mentioning
 Stalin at all, nor did he refer to( the wartime
 contribution of political officers. (Brezhnev had
 served in such a capacity during the war.) In
 what was evidently a separate ceremony,-how-
 ever, Brezhnev received his marshal's star, sig-
 nifying his promotion to the rank of general of
 the army. The award  once again  presented
 visible evidence of the special relationship be-
 tween Brezhnev and the military.

 WARSAW PACT ANNIVERSARY   2 7-2 7
 The Warsaw Pact quietly celebrated the
 twentieth anniversary  of  its  founding  on
 Wednesday amid indications that the Soviet
 Union has received a setback in its effort to
 upgrade the political role of the seven-member
 organization.
 Moscow has been pushing for the creation
 of a permanent committee of pact foreign min-
 isters and a pact secretariat headed by a strong
 Soviet secretary general. These proposals have
 cropped up periodically during the two decades
 of the pact's existence and are consistent with
 Brezhnev's often stated desire to make the pact
 "the main center for coordinating the fraternal
 countries' foreign policy." The Soviet initiative
 reportedly was to be announced at a pact
 summit in Moscow that would have been a
 suitable culmination to the flood of self-con-
 gratulatory  propaganda  generated  by
 anniversary  celebrations commemorating the
 end of World War II.
 Page  9
 A Romanian diplomat recently said that
 neither the proposal nor the summit was accept-
 able to his government. Moscow, rather than let
 this disagreement spoil the anniversary festiv-
 ities, apparently chose to shift the venue to
 Warsaw and lower the level of participation to
 pact parliamentarians. In response to this move,
 Bucharest resorted to its tactic of sending a
 lower representation level to bloc meetings it
 deems objectionable.
 Meanwhile, the pact continues to be an
 alliance of unequals whose military resources,
 training, and defense policy are rationalized and
 coordinated in the Soviet interest. It is in-
 creasingly being used by Moscow as a channel to
 transmit directives to its East European allies
 and organize East European support for Soviet
 policies. Although the Soviet Union has period-
 ically  expressed  willingness  to  dissolve  the
 Warsaw Pact in exchange for the dissolution of
 NATO, it is not likely that Moscow will give up
 its search for ways to make the alliance a more
 Eastern Europe.

 SOUTH KOREA: CRACKING DOWN AGAIN
 President  Pak  issued  a  sweeping  new
 emergency decree            this  week  banning  any
 criticism of the authoritarian 1972 constitution,
 the spreading of "false rumors," all student
 political activity and prohibiting any statement
 against the decree itself. Members of parliament
 are exempted if their criticism is expressed on
 the National Assembly floor, but the media
 cannot publicize the statements.
 Pak has long wanted to disarm his domestic
 opponents, who have been challenging his
 increasingly authoritarian rule, and he fears
 North Korean efforts to foster "revolution" in
 the South. He has apparently concluded that it
 is more urgent to strengthen defenses against his
 enemies at home and in the North than to
 satisfy critics of his human rights policies,
 including those in the US Congress.
 The new decree is in line with the trend
 toward tougher domestic controls by the Pak
 government,  but  its comprehensiveness has
 surprised many observers. It comes at a time
 when Pak's most vocal opponents have been
 closing ranks in support of the regime in order
 to avoid giving a signal of internal weakness to

 Pak's  adversaries       are unlikely to move

 They fear imprisonment, they need time to
 regroup and assess US reactions, and they don't
 want to appear irresponsible in the current
 mood of uncertainty about Pyongyang's inten-
 tions. The new measures are repugnant to Pak's
 opponents, however, and they appear certain to

 Philippines-China
 President Marcos may get his wish to make
 a state visit to Peking "when the weather is
 warm" so he can wear the Philippine national
 dress, which includes a sheer shirt made of
 pineapple fiber. Mrs. Marcos recently told China
 news agency officials in Hong Kong that her
 husband hopes to visit China next month. Nego-
 tiations in Tokyo between  Philippine and
 Chinese representatives over diplomatic recogni-
 tion are apparently proceeding without a hitch.
 If negotiations proceed favorably, Marcos
 will personally work out the final details during
 his state visit, and presumably the official an-
 nouncement would be made at that time. Mrs.
 Marcos said that her brother would go to Peking
 this month to make the arrangements for the
 President's visit. She has been lobbying hard for
 early recognition of China and is doubtless look-
 ing forward to a role as intermediary, intro-
 ducing her husband to the Chinese officials she
 met during her triumphal visit last September.
 President Marcos has also been taking steps
 to prepare the Philippine domestic scene for a
 communist  Chinese  diplomatic  presence.  In
 April, he issued a presidential decree that liber-
 alizes naturalization requirements and speeds up
 the process of citizenship for alien Chinese
 residents in the Philippines. He hopes this will
 resolve the long-standing issue of the legal status
 of some 150,000 local Chinese. Marcos was con-
 cerned that they would become "wards" of
 Peking once diplomatic relations were estab-
 lished, and like other Southeast Asian leaders,
 he wants to minimize the opportunities for
 interaction between communist Chinese diplo-
 mats and local Chinese.
 Marcos has not yet shown any particular
 concern about what effect a Peking mission in
 Manila might have on the country's small but
 well-organized  communist  insurgents. Since
 martial law was instituted, Philippine security
 authorities have arrested many of the urban
 political cadre of both the pro-Peking and the
 pro-Moscow communist parties. The Maoist-
 style New People's Army insurgents in rural
 Luzon Island have been relatively inactive in the
 past two  ears.

 Jallud (1) and Kosygin meet in Moscow last May
 USSR-LIBYA: SOME MUTUAL BENEFITS   3
 The visit to Libya this week of Soviet
 Premier Kosygin  indicates that despite the
 mutual suspicion and political differences of
 Moscow and Tripoli they plan to continue eco-
 nomic and military ties. The visit is the first by a
 Soviet leader since the Libyan revolution, and
 both countries probably hope it will strengthen
 their hands in dealing with their mutual an-
 tagonist in Cairo.
 The presence of economic and military aid
 specialists on Kosygin's delegation suggests that
 an expansion of these programs was discussed.
 On the eve of Kosygin's arrival, Moscow de-
 livered the first MIG-23s purchased by Libya
 under the arms deal entered into last year. A
 desire to get some of Libya's oil money is
 clearly one important factor behind Moscow's
 new relationship with Tripoli.
 Both sides went out of their way to
 demonstrate that they still differ on how to
 achieve a  Middle  East settlement.  Kosygin
 publicly stressed that the Geneva conference
 should be reconvened and should ensure the
 independence of "all" states-a clear reference
 to Israel. He lectured about the need for Arab
 unity, but it is unlikely that Moscow thought it
 could sway the instransigent Libyans, or even
 that Tripoli is particularly important in getting a
 Middle East settlement.
 Prime Minister Jallud met with the head of
 one of the most extreme Palestinian groups on
 the eve of Kosygin's visit to make plain Libya's
 continued support for the radical Arabs. To
 drive the point home, Tripoli edited references
 to Geneva from its account of Kosygin's speech.

 The Egyptian angle seems to be what has

 Moscow may hope that the visit will ma
 and will demonstrate that the USSR has other
 options in the Arab world. Tripoli, which had
 been pressing Moscow to send a high-level visi-
 tor, particularly welcomed the visit in view of
 the recent intensification of strains between
 Libya and Egypt.
 Egyptian President Sadat's remarks suggest
 that the visit was on target. He said the Kosygin
 trip "poses a strange question mark" about
 Soviet and Libyan intentions, particularly in
 view of the "legendary dimensions" of Mos-
 cow's arms commitments to Tripoli.
 After Libya, Kosygin will go on to Tunisia,
 but that visit was laid on hastily and will prob-
 ably result in little of significance. It will give
 Moscow the opportunity, however, to talk
 about a Middle East settlement before an audi-
 ence m re in tune with its views than the Lib-
 yans.

 Dominican Republic
 PRESIDENT STRENGTHENS HAND       42-6 "
 President Joaquin Balaguer has strength-
 ened his political position by adept handling of
 relations with senior military officers. He has
 neutralized one ambitious officer and has placed
 men personally loyal to him in key military
 slots.
 For several years, the cornerstone of his
 military strategy has been to play off the two
 main contenders for influence-Generals Neit
 Nivar and Enrique Perez y Perez-against each
 other. In 1972 Balaguer removed Nivar as chief
 of the national police and subsequently boosted
 Perez y Perez to the post of army chief of staff.
 Early this month, however, Balaguer shifted
 Nivar back to the chief of police slot. On May 9
 Perez y Perez and his counterparts in the air
 force and navy and the secretary of the armed
 President Balaguer
 forces-a navy rear admiral-submitted their
 resignations in protest. The President quickly
 called their bluff, accepting the resignations and
 naming officers loyal to him as replacements.
 With his usual foresight and attention to
 detail, Balaguer took a number of steps to
 ensure against any military repercussions. He
 obtained signed commitments of support from
 all senior officers and ordered them to confine
 the troops to barracks, to put the National
 Police on alert, to check on the loyalty of bat-
 talion-level commanders, and even to remove
 the firing pins from artillery pieces in Santo
 Domingo.
 The four officers had little success in drum-
 ming up support from their colleagues to try to
 reverse Balaguer's action, and they are now
 asking him to give them new jobs in exchange
 for promises of good behavior. Balaguer may
 well believe that he has made his point and be
 willing to find positions for the four that will
 not involve command of troops.
 The aggressive General Nivar, meanwhile,
 has moved rapidly to place his men in key police
 positions and to try to rebuild the power base
 that had deteriorated sharply since 1972. He
 may succeed for a time, but the police chief
 post has never been a very secure one, and
 Nivar's own tenure could turn out to be brief.
 Balaguer probably intended the return of
 Nivar to favor mainly as a move to restore the
 political balance in the military. He must have
 been confident that his position was secure
 enough to risk a challenge from Nivar's enemies.
 He may have planned to use the opportunity to
 put his own men in key armed forces slots,
 making his administration even more of a one-
 man operation. With the opposition political
 parties in disarray, the military has been the last
 effective constraint on Balaguer's power and he
 seems to have shown that it can also be over-
 come.

 Fidel Castro has given his most straight-
 forward indication to date that he is ready to
 work toward improving relations with the US.
 Although the official summary of his talks with
 journalists covering Senator McGovern's visit
 carried his "reiteration" that the US "blockade"
 must end before negotiations can begin, other
 quotes underscored a genuine interest in moving
 toward an accommodation.
 One  ''emphatic"  quote  attributed  to
 Castro, for example, stated: "We are ready to
 abide by international norms and respect all
 countries that respect us." This appears to in-
 dicate a willingness to accept the "mutuality of
 obligation" specified in Secretary Kissinger's
 statement in Houston on March 1. In addition,
 Castro hinted at a willingness to agree to refrain
 from subversion on a basis of reciprocity. He
 mentioned that Mexico, "as an example," never
 tried to overthrow his revolution, and "Cuba has
 responded with a similar attitude." Even with
 regard to getting rid of the Chilean "fascist"
 government, he acknowledged a readiness to
 consider this a "matter to be decided by Chil-
 eans themselves."
 As for a sign of good faith from the US, he
 indicated that a partial lifting of the blockade to
 permit the export of food and medicine to Cuba
 would be "an important step that would lead to
 a reconsideration by Cuba of its relations with
 the US." Previously, Castro had demanded that
 the US unilaterally terminate the blockade,
 presumably without a Cuban response other
 than to go to the negotiating table. He is appar-
 ently now willing to match stages in the lifting
 of the blockade with Cuban counter-gestures.
 His press release, however, failed to mention
 what these gestures would be, although the for-
 eign press claims he hinted at the release of US
 political prisoners and the return of a two-mil
 lion-dollar ransom confiscated from hijackers in
 November 1972.
 Castro might have gone further in in-
 dicating his willingness to improve relations, but
 he apparently was stung by the refusal of the US
 to acknowledge Cuba's release of some US
 citizens jailed for illegal entry and drug-related
 Page  15  WEEKLY SUMMARY

 NO*
 offenses-as gestures of good will. Four had
 been permitted to leave Cuba shortly after the
 visit of Senators Pell and Javits last September-
 as a gesture to the senators but not the US
 government--and others followed earlier this
 year.
 According to the Cuban press release,
 Castro admitted the US had made "some small
 gestures," but asserted that,  "regarding an
 alleged lack of reciprocity," Cuba had made a
 much more valuable gesture in helping to solve
 the hijacking problem. Castro had tried on at
 least two other occasions to establish the myth
 that he expected the US to seize the initiative to
 improve relations in the wake of the hijacking
 agreement reached in February 1973. Havana,
 however, had warned again ,t that very inter-
 pretation when the pact was signed. The Cubans
 had negotiated because of negative world reac-
 tion to the Cuban haven for hijackers and
 because Castro apparently feared some fatal
 hijacking accident that might further tarnish
 Cuba's image.
 Castro's suggestion that his action  on
 hijacking might be repaid by permitting the
 export of food and medicine was probably made
 with the current OAS meeting in mind. He may
 expect the US either to press for a lifting of the
 OAS sanctions or to allow limited exports,
 thereby undercutting an OAS policy it had been
 instrumental in formulating.
 Castro will not be rushed into negotiations.
 He regards a reconciliation with the US as
 inevitable, but his statements at the press con-
 ference indicate that he sees the process as a
 drawn-out affair, involving careful and complex
 maneuvering for positions of advantage. He is
 under no pressure for a quick solution and
 instead appears to be trying to generate pressure
 on the US through the press and public opinion.
 His press release included his expression-which
 he gave in English in front of US television
 cameras-of  "wishes of understanding and
 friendship" sent "to the US people."

 PERU-US: A LONG, HOT SUMMER       ?b
 A number of economic and political issues
 are likely to cause a downturn in US-Peruvian
 relations in coming weeks. Strains in relations
 have grown since 1968 when Peru's new military
 government expropriated the holdings of a
 major US-owned oil company; present military
 leaders remain deeply hostile toward US eco-
 nomic involvement in their country. Some of-
 ficers are convinced that Washington is com-
 mitted to "destabilizing" their nationalist-leftist
 revolution.  In  bilateral  negotiations,  these
 sentiments have led Peru to assume intransigent
 postures; the US is a frequent target of vitriolic
 rhetoric at international meetings.
 The most serious unresolved problem con-
 cerns the civil aviation agreement between the
 two countries. Military leaders in Lima are hold-
 ing out for extensive concessions by Braniff
 Airways in order to expand service by Aero-
 peru-the Peruvian state airline-to the US and
 to other Latin American countries. Some of-
 ficials apparently are prepared to suspend all
 bilateral air service and risk a confrontation with
 Washington. Those urging moderation may be
 able to forestall a suspension, but the hard-
 liners' position will be strengthened if President
 Velasco concludes that discussions on other
 bilateral issues are not progressing well. As in
 other negotiations, sound economic considera-
 tions may give way to nationalistic inflexibility.
 The government's concern over continued
 oil company activity, however, did not stop it
 from moving against Gulf Oil facilities on May
 14. According  to the expropriation decree,
 Gulf's relatively small holdings were taken over
 because the company had exhibited "immoral"
 behavior in its operations in Latin America. The
 government cited press reports that Gulf had
 paid money to unnamed foreign officials-
 apparently not Peruvian-in order to continue
 operating in their country. While Gulf is not
 involved in oil exploration in Peru, President
 Velasco may have wanted to warn other oil
 companies not to stray from the regime's strict
 standards of conduct. By the same token, of
 course, he risks causing the companies to have
 even  less confidence  in  Peru's investment
 climate.
 President Velasco may also have moved
 against Gulf in retaliation for a strongly worded
 protest by the US ambassador last week regard-
 ing published Peruvian congratulations to North
 Vietnam and the Viet Cong on their "defeat of
 US imperialism."
 Another US company, Marcona Mining, is
 also in line for expropriation. The regime has
 been considering such a move for some time and
 recently began a press campaign aimed at publi-
 cizing alleged misconduct by Marcona.
 Another potentially serious issue is the
 possibility that major US oil companies may
 pull out of Peru because of reduced estimates of
 recoverable reserves in the northeast jungle. The
 companies have been exploring the area for sev-
 eral years now, and the military government has
 counted heavily on substantial oil revenues to
 fund domestic programs. Although results from
 exploratory wells have not been encouraging,
 some Peruvian officials apparently remain con-
 vinced that there are large reservoirs of recover-
 able reserves. President Velasco and some of his
 more radical associates might conclude that any
 oil company pullouts are part of a US effort to
 weaken Peru's economy.
 Although Peruvian actions against US com-
 panies will probably be restrained by the govern-
 ment's need to maintain its creditworthiness
 with international lending institutions, Velasco
 may conclude that the civil air problem is under
 no such restraint. Moreover, such economic con-
 siderations are unlikely to weaken anti-US state-
 ments by regime officials and pro-government
 editorialists. This continuing anti-US press
 coverage is likely to pick up as Peru prepares to
 host the nonaligned foreign ministers.
 President  Velasco  reportedly  has  been
 unable to resume his full duties since his stroke
 last February and the uncertainty about his

 BRAZIL: EUROPEAN TRADE
 Brazil is making a strong bid to strengthen
 its economic ties with Western Europe. The
 move is part of an overall effort to diversify
 trade relations as much as possible, particularly
 to lessen reliance on the US, long Brazil's most
 important trading partner. Brasilia, moreover, is
 urgently seeking new sources of foreign ex-
 change to alleviate a serious balance-of-pay-
 ments problem.
 Brazil's biggest accomplishment to date is
 the negotiation of a multibillion-dollar nuclear
 deal with West Germany.  Foreign  Minister
 Silveira is scheduled to travel to Bonn next
 month to sign the agreement, which will cover
 construction of eight nuclear plants in Brazil
 and the provision of fuel enrichment technol-
 ogy. Brasilia also is seeking sizable German
 financing for a planned expansion of its steel
 industry.
 Other  initiatives in Western  Europe in-
 clude:
 ? A series of seminars in European cap-
 itals on investing in Brazil.
 ? Two European trips made by Finance
 Minister Simonsen with another planned for
 later this month.
 ? The appointment of two highly re-
 garded former finance ministers as ambas-
 sadors to the UK and France.

 export drive. Moreover, efforts to attract sizable
 amounts of Middle Eastern capital have thus far

 power-depends heavily on ever expanding over-
 seas markets, investments, and credits. The cur-
 rent effort to expand economic relations with
 Europe may also be spurred, at least in part, by
 annoyance with US trade laws and higher tariffs
 on some Brazilian exports. Brasilia views these
 measures-especially the latter-as threats to its   25X1

 UN: SPECIAL SESSION PREPARATIONS      7e-g2
 Less than a month remains before the final
 meeting in New York to organize the UN's
 special General Assembly session on economic
 development and cooperation. Although the
 session itself will not open until September, the
 preparatory meeting in June will largely deter-
 mine the issues to be discussed and will thus
 mark a significant opportunity to influence the
 session's outcome. The Seventh Special Session
 itself could signal the creation of new coopera-
 tive arrangements between the developed and
 developing countries or solidify differences
 between the two groups.
 A resolution of the 28th (1973) regular
 General Assembly officially called for the ses-
 sion to discuss the problems of development and
 international economic cooperation. Both the
 developed and developing countries agree that
 the agenda will have to be sharply limited if the
 session is to register any success. What the two
 groups do not agree on, however, is the status of
 the so-called New International Economic Order
 and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties
 of States.
 Both  documents were  steamrollered
 through UN meetings last year, despite the ob-
 jections of the major industrialized states. The
 developing countries recognize that these decla-
 rations do not have unanimous support, but
 they insist that the economic "principles" in-
 corporated in them should be considered as the
 starting point and fundamental basis for nego-
 tiations at the Seventh Session. The Group of
 77, the developing-country caucus, is now in-
 formally circulating for discussion with the
 developed countries a list of those issues that
 they feel deserve priority attention because of
 their "pressing nature." The list repeats most of
 the major developing country demands, but
 avoids specific reference to such inflammatory
 claims as the right to expropriate foreign prop-
 erty and to form producer cartels.
 The British have already presented their
 ideas on a comprehensive approach to the ses-
 sion's organization, which they hope both the
 developing and developed countries can support.
 The British would divide items proposed for the
 session's agenda into three categories:
 ? General principles-general statements
 of what is agreed to by the international
 community  and  reaffirming a  "practical
 commitment to change and to constructive
 interdependence."
 ? Topics where prospects for agreement
 are good; in this category the British include
 commodity problems, relating the prices of
 raw material exports to the cost of industrial
 imports, and structural changes in the UN
 system.
 ? Topics on which immediate prospects
 for agreement are poor.
 The session itself would concentrate on the first
 two categories; the third would provide a focus
 for subsequent consultations, outside the ses-
 sion's framework.
 A major complicating factor in the prepara-
 tions, however, is likely to be Algerian Foreign
 Minister Bouteflika, who, by virtue of his presi-
 dency of the last General Assembly, will also
 preside over the special session. During the past
 year, the Algerians have strengthened their lead-
 ership of the nonaligned Group of 77 movement
 and show no signs of relinquishing their in-
 fluence to more moderate members. Despite the
 openly expressed dissatisfaction of many non-
 aligned and developing countries with Algerian
 militance, there have as yet been no defections.
 Algeria appears to be alone among the
 developing countries in demanding that the
 Seventh Session implement fully all the declara-
 tions of the Sixth Session, instead of concen-
 trating on those few issues where prospects seem
 best for agreement. The political grievances of

 the developing countries nevertheless remain a
 fertile ground for political manipulation, and
 the Algerians are unlikely to desist from such
 efforts. Whether their tactics succeed this time
 may depend in part on the combination of

 OAS: A STUDY IN TACTICS     5
 Midpoint in the OAS General Assembly,
 now under way in Washington, the delegations
 were holding to their plan to dispense with the
 confrontation tactics that have ruled most inter-
 national gatherings of late. The recent move-
 ment toward exclusive, all-Latin associations
 evidently was checked at the door to preserve
 the OAS for multilateral dealings between the
 US and most of the other governments of the
 hemisphere.
 Increasingly the OAS emerges as the ex-
 ceptional regional body. Over the past several
 months, Latin leaders have promoted numerous
 regional enterprises that would exclude the US:
 a Caribbean merchant fleet, all-Latin multi-
 national corporations, a Latin labor confed-
 eration, a Latin press association, and a Latin
 summit meeting to be held later this year. More-
 over, the relative decorum of the OAS assembly
 signals no turnaround in the prevailing Latin and
 Caribbean conviction that a continuous airing of
 familiar charges against the US and other de-
 veloped nations is a worthwhile endeavor. The
 Latin Americans continue active participation in
 and sometimes leadership of the "steamroller"
 ploy, wherein the developing countries force
 large majority votes condemning the attitudes
 and practices of the US and other countries that
 enjoy high standards of living.
 The UN Economic Commission for Latin
 America, which has just concluded its sessions in
 Port of Spain, showed none of the softening
 that has appeared in the OAS. Trinidad, the host
 government, opened the conference with harsh
 criticism of the countries that allegedly are
 blocking the development of a just world eco-
 nomic order, with attacks on "abuses" by trans-
 national corporations, and with proposals for
 the further exclusion of some countries from
 certain sensitive committees of the commission.
 During the sessions, the Latin and Caribbean
 delegates lined up behind several resolutions to
 which the US gave the single opposing vote.
 They agreed to organize a center for the "sur-
 veillance" of transnationals, called for the crea-
 tion of more producer associations, insisted on
 priority for measures aimed at protecting the
 markets  of  less developed countries, and
 planned a study of the effects on the Latin-
 Caribbean region of monetary instability and
 inflation in the developed countries. Clearly,
 this line will once again be followed at the next
 UN General Assembly this fall, as well as at
 numerous regional assemblies scheduled during
 the rest of 1975.
 The depth of Latin American sentiment
 about the basic unfairness of the "world order"
 and about the possibilities of altering the sit-
 uation is such that even those governments
 sharing the most cordial bilateral relationships
 with the US will be vocally anti-US at these
 international affairs. Mexico was vociferous at
 the Trinidad conference in promoting the ex-
 clusion of the US from some economic com-
 mission committees and has repeatedly risked
 conflict with the US over President Echeverria's
 favorite foreign policy creation, the Charter of
 Economic Rights and Duties. Similarly, Brazil,
 ordinarily a moderating force, subscribes to the
 position that access to supplies of raw materials
 of the less developed countries is the principal
 lever of the developing countries vis-a-vis the

 OPEC: TRENDS IN INVESTMENT     6 (7
 OPEC foreign official assets reached an
 estimated $73 billion at the end of last year,
 compared with $21 billion a year earlier. Lack-
 ing the financial expertise to handle the rapid
 buildup of oil funds, the OPEC states simply
 allowed most of them to pile up in secure,
 highly liquid bank accounts and other short-
 term assets. At year end; the wealth of OPEC
 members was concentrated in:
 ? Bank deposits and government securi-
 ties, which made up about 80 percent of
 total holdings.
 ? The financial markets of the major
 developed countries, London and New York
 accounting for 60 percent.
 ? Major currencies-dollar-denominated
 assets made up about 70 percent of the
 to4al, and sterling assets 10 percent.
 The OPEC states are gradually becoming
 more sophisticated investors and are developing
 broader relationships with Western financial
 institutions. As a result, the trend in recent
 months has been toward:
 ? Longer term placements, in the form
 of purchases of the stocks and bonds of
 large private and public corporations.
 ?  More  investment  in  continental
 Europe, Japan, and Canada, and less in the
 UK because of its high inflation rate and
 worrisome payments position.
 ? Greater diversity  in the currency
 denomination of assets, though the bulk
 continues to be dollar-denominated.
 Long-term  investment  is becoming  in-
 creasingly attractive to the oil producers. Short-
 term interest rates have fallen below long-term
 rates, and the growing consensus that economic
 recovery will begin in the developed countries
 later this year is directing more attention to
 equity investment. The three producers with the
 largest asset holdings-Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
 and Iran-are showing the greatest interest in
 long-term investment.
 Kuwait established at least seven special
 investment accounts last year to acquire long-
 term assets, particularly equities. Under the less
 conservative financial  leadership of Crown
 Prince Fahd and the new governor of the Saudi
 Arabian Monetary Agency, Saudi Arabia has
 begun to select directly investments in corporate
 securities. Iran is expressing interest in debt and
 equity investments in major Western companies
 that can aid in developing its economy.

 LAW OF THE SEA CONCLUDES    eZ   f
 The Law of the Sea Conference made some
 progress toward negotiating a final treaty before
 concluding last week in Geneva, but major dif-
 ferences between developing and developed
 countries will require at least two more nego-
 tiating sessions. If a treaty is signed at all, it will
 probably not be before late 1976.
 The deep seabed mining issue was the most
 contentious. The developing countries main-
 tained their solidarity in favor of an interna-
 tional  authority to  mine the vast mineral
 resources of the seabed. The developed coun-
 tries, on the other hand, are split over the
 powers they are willing to permit an interna-
 tional  body and  the extent to which the
 authority should engage in direct exploitation.
 There had been some movement by the develop-
 ing countries to accept a system of joint ven-
 tures, but efforts to reach  a compromise
 eventually failed. Some of the developing states
 are worried about competition from exploita-
 tion of the raw materials contained in seabed
 nodules-manganese, copper, nickel, and cobalt.
 The Pacific basin, scene of much ex-
 ploratory work, is thought to be a particularly
 rich area. The US, Japan, and West Germany, as
 well as other states, have spent about $100
 million on exploratory operations, but no full
 scale commercial mining is yet underway.
 A 12-mile territorial sea, a 200-mile eco-
 nomic zone in which the coastal state exercises
 broad powers, and unimpeded passage through
 straits-topics discussed  in the Conference's
 Second Committee-are potential treaty provi-
 sions accepted in the main by many of the
 conference participants.
 jurisdiction of those areas where the continental
 shelf extends beyond 200 miles. Moreover, the
 40-odd countries, both developed and develop-
 ing, that are landlocked or geographically dis-
 advantaged in their direct access to the sea are
 threatening to block conclusion of the treaty
 unless they are given a greater share of their
 neighbors' economic-zone resources and guaran-
 teed access to the ocean.
 A  UN estimate indicates that offshore
 resources constitute possibly as much as 40
 percent of the world's potential petroleum
 resources, and almost all of this is within the
 200-mile economic zone. Since offshore drilling
 began over a quarter century ago, some 40
 billion barrels of oil have been recovered. There
 are about another 140 billion barrels of proved
 reserves. By the late 1980s, offshore sources
 could provide as much as one-half of the world
 production.
 The committee on marine pollution and
 marine scientific research made little progress
 largely because most of the developing countries
 are not willing to accept the principle of
 freedom of scientific research; some are assert-
 ing that consent to permit research in their
 economic zones will be based on whether the
 research is resource or non-resource related, a
 distinction often difficult to make. There has
 been some movement toward accepting inter-
 national standards for ship pollution. On
 broader pollution standards, however, partic-
 ularly those relating to activities on the con-
 tinental shelf, the developing countries continue
 to insist that they should be subject to less
 stringent standards than the developed coun-
 tries.
 There are some important questions un-
 resolved, however, such as jurisdiction over
 migratory fish, the definition of archipelago
 states, and the delimitation of coastal-state
 At the end of the session, the chairmen of
 the conference's  three main committees
 presented a single draft of a treaty based on
 their interpretations of the discussions. This
 single text does not represent a negotiated or

 instead as the basis for subsequent negotiations
 in the hope that the general outlines in the draft

 Resolution of the most contentious issues
 during informal intersessional consultations in
 the working groups may depend most of all on
 whether  unilateral  actions--for example, ex-
 tension of territorial sea limits or deep seabed
 mining-are taken by states before next year.
 Significant actions affecting the ultimate success
 of the negotiations may also take place in

 The global discussions on raw materials-

 have increasingly come to dominate relations
 between developing and developed countries.
 Successful negotiation of some of these issues,
 particularly at the coming special session of the

 tion, could contribute significantly to expe-
