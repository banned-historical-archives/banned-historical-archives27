 Portuguese officers supporting the Antunes faction apparently now plan to
 boycott the crucial meeting of the Armed Forces General Assembly-scheduled for
 tomorrow-unless former prime minister Goncalves' appointment as armed forces
 chief of staff is rescinded and the composition of the pro-Goncalves assembly itself
 is changed.
 This strategy reportedly evolved from a meeting of the army assembly on
 Tuesday. The results of the meeting were not made public but were conveyed
 directly to President Costa Gomes. The US army attache in Lisbon has learned that
 the vote went heavily against Goncalves in spite of his personal appearance at the
 assembly. The army assembly voted not to send delegates to tomorrow's general
 assembly session.
 A meeting of the air force assembly yesterday was expected to follow the
 army's lead. We do not yet have the results of this meeting, but if the air force does
 in fact follow the army's lead in calling for changes in the membership of the general
 assembly, the inter-service meeting will probably be postponed.
 In the past few days, the Communist-influenced media have attempted to sow
 discord and confusion in the air force by casting doubt on the support enjoyed by
 its chief of staff, General Morais da Silva. Earlier this week, he said Goncalves would
 serve the interests of the Communists in his new position as head of the military.
 Last night, the President's office denied reports that Morais da Silva would be
 replaced.
 Meanwhile, according to Socialist Party sources, Mario Soares has made public
 his party's conditions for joining a new government. In addition to the removal of
 Goncalves, Soares' tough demands reportedly included:
 --Municipal, labor union, and national assembly elections.
 Support for the popularly elected constituent assembly.
 --Implementation of an economic plan drawn up recently by the Socialist
 Party.
 The Popular Democratic Party reportedly is making the same demands for
 political freedoms that were rejected in July, resulting in the party's withdrawal
 from the fourth provisional government.

 The joint strategy being pursued by the Antunes faction and the democratic
 parties seems to leave the next move to Costa Gomes. At the same time, the threat
 of military action by one or another of the factions in the armed forces appears to
 be growing daily.
 There are some indications that Portuguese rightists may try to take advantage
 of the present situation. According to press reports, former president Antonio de
 Spinola left Brazil on Tuesday for Paris. This visit reportedly is part of a plan to
 stage a political comeback.
 Spinola supporters could upset the present political situation if they launched a
 strike against the Communists-as some reports have suggested they might. Such a
 move would be effectively exploited by Communists propagandists, who would link
 it with the Antunes group, perhaps scuttling efforts to purge Goncalves and his
 supporters.

 A general strike called by Palestinians and Lebanese leftists to protest the latest
 Egyptian-Israeli agreement halted commercial activity in the southern port cities of
 Sidon and Tyre yesterday. The strike was only partly effective in Beirut, although
 roadblocks appeared in several areas of the city and the road to the airport was
 closed. Demonstrations are expected to continue today.
 Small arms fire was heard early yesterday morning in the Beirut suburbs where
 heavy fighting occurred in late June, and two rockets were fired at the headquarters
 of the right-wing Christian Phalanges Party. Government security forces moved
 quickly to contain the violence, and to provide protection to the Egyptian embassy,
 where Palestinians demonstrated last weekend.
 There is a danger that the demonstrations against the new Sinai pact might
 combine with the continued clashes between Christians and Muslims to produce a
 real explosion in Beirut. Palestinian radicals organized a few demonstrations late last
 week in support of Muslims and fedayeen in the Zahlah area, where violence has
 already lasted ten days.
 The Lebanese internal security service appears gradually to be gaining the upper
 hand in Zahlah, although reliable press reports indicate that at least 36 persons have
 been killed in the fighting.

 ISRAEL-LEBANON
 Israeli aircraft bombed fedayeen targets in southern Lebanon yesterday for the
 second consecutive day.
 Tel Aviv has increased attacks on fedayeen targets during the past several
 weeks, partly because of stepped-up fedayeen strikes across the border, and also in
 an attempt to preempt terrorist attacks against Israel. While discussing yesterday
 morning's air raid, an Israeli spokesman said that Israel would hit the fedayeen
 whenever it has information as to their location.
 Yesterday, according to a military authority in Tel Aviv, 16 A-4 Skyhawks
 struck fedayeen camp, storage, and headquarters structures in the Burghuliyah area,
 some 15 miles north of the Israeli border on the Mediterranean coast. Israeli aircraft
 and artillery also hit fedayeen targets in southeastern Lebanon near Mount Hermon
 in separate strikes.
 The Palestine guerrilla command
 announced in Beirut this morning that Israeli commandos struck guerrilla positions
 near the Lebanese port city of Sidon. F__ I The Israeli military command
 c   irm   in a  rie communique that its troops had clashed with Arab guerrillas
 but provided few details.

 Turkish unwillingness to follow through on commitments made during the last
 round of the intercommunal talks in Vienna has left Greek Cypriots frustrated and
 pessimistic over prospects for the round in New York on September 8 and 9.
 The mainland Turks and Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash appear caught
 between a tactical need to appear reasonable and forthcoming in New York-with an
 eye to the US House of Representatives' position on the arms embargo-and the
 political situation in Turkey that makes concessions difficult. Denktash also has to
 contend with political restraints in his own Turkish Cypriot community and is
 concerned about possibly being left out on a limb by Ankara.
 US embassy officials in Nicosia believe that any concessions the Turks do
 finally offer in New York will be relatively minor, and only an initial bargaining
 position. Combined with  Denktash's failure to produce on other Vienna
 commitments, such a position would further embarrass and embitter Greek Cypriot
 negotiator Clerides, who may have weakened his political position by making
 concessions at Vienna last month. It would also give substance to Cypriot President
 Makarios' doubts about the Vienna talks and help justify a decision to submit the
 Cyprus issue to the UN General Assembly.
 Denktash has yet to follow through on his promise to present concrete
 proposals on the various issues prior to going to New York. In addition, he has failed
 to produce on other Vienna agreements in exchange for Clerides' agreement to
 permit the nearly 9,000 Turkish Cypriots remaining in the south to move to the
 Turkish zone in the north. Denktash did agree to the return of some 800 Greeks
 expelled earlier from the north, but Turkish obstructionism has resulted in no more
 that 230 being readmitted to the Turkish zone so far. Clerides has told UN officials
 that he is considering blocking the movement of the remaining Turkish Cypriots to
 the north if movement of Greek Cypriots is not speeded up.
 In Ankara, Prime Minister Demirel is reluctant to make any concessions on
 Cyprus that might leave him vulnerable in the partial Senate elections next month.
 Demirel's rightist coalition partner, Necmettin Erbakan, has taken a no-concession
 position on Cyprus and would be quick to turn any major conciliation gestures by
 Demirel to his own political advantage.
 I n a move that appears to be related to the arms embargo as much as to a
 Cyprus settlement, Ankara announced on September 3 that some of the 1,000 to
 1,500 army commandos stationed on Cyprus since July 1974 would return to

 Turkey during the first week of September. This move, which the Turks have been
 considering for some time, may have been announced at this time to help offset
 their failure to make meaningful proposals on a territorial settlement. It is doubtful
 that this gesture will dispel the pessimism in Greek Cypriot ranks in the few
 remaining days before the opening of the talks in New York.

 Claims by the National Front for the Liberation of Angola that its troops have
 advanced to within ten miles of Luanda, the capital, have not been confirmed by
 Portuguese military officials. The Front and the rival Popular Movement for the
 Liberation of Angola are known, however, to be building up their military forces
 between Luanda and the Front's stronghold at Caxito, some 40 miles to the
 northeast.
 The Front is anxious to establish a military perimeter around the outskirts of
 Luanda.
 Apparently, the Front also hopes to discredit claims by the Popular Movement
 that it is the territory's only effective nationalist group. The Popular Movement has
 maintained that it is the only group that has lived up to its responsibilities under the
 accord concluded between Lisbon and the liberation groups last January. It says it
 expects to "assume total responsibility for governing Angola" on November 11.
 With slightly over two months remaining before they are scheduled to grant
 independence to Angola, the Portuguese are making a last-ditch attempt to patch
 together a government to which it can hand over sovereignty. Admiral Leonel
 Cardoso, formerly in charge of naval operations in Portugal's African territories, was
 sworn in on August 30 as the new Angolan high commissioner and should be arriving
 in  Luanda soon. Cardoso will have broader executive, judicial, and defense
 responsibilities than those granted to his predecessor now that Lisbon has suspended
 the January agreement.

 The crises that have rocked Argentina recently have seriously weakened the
 unity of conservative Peronist groups that still profess loyalty to President Maria
 Estela Peron.
 Labor and political leaders are trying to preserve an image of cooperation and
 vitality, but events of the past week demonstrate that this is only a facade. Peronist
 party leaders elected during last week's convention are calling for a return to
 "consensus politics"-the dialogue with all national political participants begun by
 Juan Peron. The directive ordering this, however, contains no guidelines for
 reconciling groups that are mutually antagonistic.
 The leaders are ignoring the fact that Peronists who disapproved the party slate
 have organized a rival faction called the "Peronist Affirmation." This appears to be
 the first time in Peronist history that any group has formally challenged the
 hierarchy without first resigning from the party.
 Moreover, tensions within the Peronist labor movement-long the dominant
 civilian political force in the country-were increased by the recent conflict between
 President Peron and the military chiefs over the appointment of an army officer to
 the interior portfolio. According to reliable press reports, the country's two major
 union leaders disagreed strongly on the issue of taking sides in the dispute and are
 unlikely to reconcile their differences. Both men already have been weakened
 because of their past ties to the now-discredited Lopez Rega and their inability to
 prevent price hikes and to curb rising unemployment. Their disagreement will
 probably be papered over, but behind the scenes it appears that the union boss who
 sided with President Peron in her dispute with the military high command has lost
 political ground.
 This latest flare-up is a further indication of the lack of organizational
 cohesiveness that prevents labor, military, and political leaders from exercising the
 leadership needed to cope with major political and economic problems. Although
 real power passed to military and (labor leaders two months ago with the downfall of
 Lopez Rega, they have been unable to work effectively with President Peron, are
 unwilling to oust her, and cannot agree among themselves on a course of action.

 A significant change has been reported in the command and control structure
 of Warsaw Pact forces facing the NATO Southern Region. F__         I
 a new organizational structure consisting of a Theater of Military
 Operations headquarters was said to have been established in Odessa with supporting
 staffs in Odessa, Tbilisi, and Sofia, Bulgaria. This headquarters would probably
 control and coordinate wartime operations against Greece and Turkey carried out by
 Pact forces from Bulgaria and the Odessa, North Caucasus, and Transcaucasus
 military districts.
 It has been believed for some years that the Pact would in wartime establish a
 southwestern theater headquarters. Setting up the command now would make the
 transition to wartime operations that much more rapid.
 Information over the past year has suggested  new developments in
 Soviet-Bulgarian military relations. For example, military delegations from Bulgaria
 have made several trips to the Odessa Military District over the past year, while both
 Soviet Minister of Defense Grechko and Warsaw Pact Commander Yakubovskiy have
 visited Bulgaria recently. In addition, Soviet troops have crossed Romania to
 participate in combined Soviet-Bulgarian exercises on several occasions, most
 recently in March.

 After a period of relative calm, factionalism within the Chinese leadership
 appears to be coming to the surface again in virulent form. In September, People's
 Daily carried a major article that seems to be a thinly disguised attack on Teng
 Hsiao-ping, China's senior vice premier who also holds important military and party
 posts and who is currently in day-to-day charge in Peking.
 The attack is contained in a criticism of the famous Ming-dynasty novel "Water
 Margin" (also known as "All Men Are Brothers"), which has long been known to be
 a favorite of Chairman Mao. A similar article also appeared in the latest issue of the
 theoretical journal Red Flag; both have been widely disseminated by the Chinese
 news agency. A list of contents of Red Flag also distributed by the news agency
 indicates that it contains a number of other articles on the same subject; they are
 not yet available in Washington.
 Both articles are highly critical of the role and character of a leading figure in
 the novel. The description of this figure leaves little doubt that, in the context of the
 current criticism, he is a surrogate for Teng. The figure is specifically called the head
 of a "faction" who is intent on undermining and vitiating the principles of "peasant
 rebellion." In a passage that unmistakably links criticism of the novel to current
 politics, Red Flag claims that in this figure can be seen the "ugly features of
 present-day capitulationists."
 The  central  issue raised  by the articles appears to be "revisionist
 capitulationism...at home and abroad." This criticism is aimed at the policy of
 "rehabilitation" of veteran  party officials disgraced during the Cultural
 Revolution-a policy that, despite a number of ups and downs, has generally been
 pursued by Peking since the early 1970s. Teng Hsiao-ping is not only an advocate of
 this policy but also its most important beneficiary. As secretary general of the party
 he was disgraced early in the Cultural Revolution. He was rehabilitated in the spring
 of 1973, reappointed to the Politburo in December of that year, and made a
 member of the Politburo Standing Committee last January.
 The rehabilitation issue has long been a bone of contention between the "left"
 and "right" wings of the Chinese party, which have respectively opposed and
 supported the policy. The issue involves the larger question of the efficacy and
 legitimacy of the Cultural Revolution, which has been at the heart of Chinese
 domestic politics for a decade. The articles define rehabilitation as accepting "royal
 amnesty" while planning ultimately to betray the revolution.

 The phrase "royal amnesty" raises in direct form the question of Mao's status
 and his role in the present controversy. For two years, Chinese polemics, arguing by
 historical analogy, have treated the emperor-figure as a surrogate for Mao; the
 Chairman has, moreover, clearly associated himself with Teng's rehabilitation.
 In an extraordinary passage that seems to bear directly on this issue, People's
 Daily comments: "In a feudal country, the emperor is the highest ruler, the general
 representative of the landlord class and the big boss of all feudal bureaucrats. The
 peasantry must oppose the emperor in order to oppose the reactionary rule of the
 landlord class. If the peasantry only opposed corrupt officials, but not the emperor,
 it cannot shake the rule of the landlord class." It added that the evil Teng-figure and
 his friends "did not oppose the emperor and were loyal to him."
 This passage seems to claim that in order to preserve the revolution it may be
 necessary to oppose Mao himself; at the very least, it appears to imply that Teng has
 pulled the wool over Mao's eyes by stressing his personal loyalty to the Chairman.
 The Red Flag article is more ambiguous, however. While also criticizing the idea of
 "royal amnesty," it refers favorably to another character as the "founder of the
 revolutionary cause" chronicled in the novel. Moreover, Mao's authority is invoked
 in the article.
 This spate of articles-at least one more apparently was published in the Peking
 newspaper Kuang Ming Daily-appears at a moment when the central theme of
 Chinese propaganda has been unity and discipline and when the central authorities
 appear prepared to crack down on dissident activities and strikes in factories and in
 the transportation industry. In fact, both the Red Flag and People's Daily articles
 appear to refer by indirection to the recent use of troops-on Teng's authority-to
 restore order in Chekiang Province, claiming that "suppressing other bandits" in the
 name of the "emperor" is an example of the Teng-figure's "flunkyism."
 In the current environment, then, it is possible-although it is too early to be
 certain-that the attack on Teng is an act of desperation on the part of his
 opponents, who see in his current exercise of authority and stress on unity
 indications that the vice premier is attempting to consolidate his position before the
 Chairman's death so as to secure his place in the succession. Behind such tactical
 maneuvering, however, is almost certainly a considerable dissatisfaction on the part
 of a number of those most closely associated with the Cultural Revolution with
 Teng's assertion-expressed in a speech prior to last January's National People's
 Congress-that that upheaval and its divisive aftermath have tarnished the reputation
 of the Chinese government.
 In this context, Teng's enemies may believe they have no other choice than a
 head-on attack on the vice premier-and perhaps on Mao as well. There are
 indications that an attempt was made a year ago to undermine current policies by
 opening a major attack on corrupt practices among party officials;

 Ian introductory note appended to
 the Red Flag article on "Water Margin," stating that the criticism of the novel is
 only for the purpose of discussion, indicates that the sudden new attack on
 personalities and policies does not have the support of the full Chinese leadership.
 The implications for Mao in the current developments are even more
 ambiguous. The Chairman was almost certainly weakened to some extent by last
 year's divisive anti-Confucius campaign. The conflicting treatment of Mao's role as
 "founder and commander" of the Chinese army during the August 1 celebration of
 Army Day suggests there is continuing controversy regarding Mao's direct control of
 the military.
 It is possible that the Chairman's running quarrel with the army has left him
 vulnerable to criticism from other quarters, but the wily old man's political acumen
 is still considerable and he still retains great reservoirs of prestige among the general
 populace.
