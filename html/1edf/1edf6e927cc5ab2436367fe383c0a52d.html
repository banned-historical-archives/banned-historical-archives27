 PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
 Since the fall of Phnom Penh in April 1975, the Khmer
 Communists have shown themselves to be the most extreme of the
 world's totalitarian regimes. The regime's politico-economic policies
 have been characterized by the total mobilization of the Cambodian
 people. The forced resettlement of the entire urban population in the
 rural areas has been justified as a means to create a huge permanent
 labor force in the countryside. The unprecedented cruelty with which
 the experiment was carried out resulted in the death of hundreds of
 thousands of people including almost the entire educated stratum.
 Unorthodox economic practices, such as the complete abolition of
 private ownership and the departure from a money economy, reflect
 the Khmer Communists' determination to implement a social system
 that is alien to other Communist countries. The regime has departed
 from Marxist-Leninist practice by refusing to identify "Democratic
 Cambodia" as a member of the Communist camp. The Khmer
 Communists' vagueness about the country's political system and their
 avoidance until recently of standard Communist terminology are
 actions amounting to a unique "Cambodian model."
 The most striking departure has been the regime's decision to keep
 the Khmer Communist Party (KCP) underground. The denial of the
 Communist Party's leading role in the post-revolutionary period, and
 the use of the vague term "revolutionary organization" in lieu of the
 Party are innovations without precedent in Communist practice.
 Indications are that the continued underground status of the KCP
 did not diminish its decision-making role in the political life of the
 regime. Recent evidence that Prime Minister Pol Pot and KCP General
 Secretary Saloth Sar are the same person tends to strengthen that
 conclusion.
 In the area of foreign policies, the Khmer Communist regime is
 concerned above all with maintaining Cambodia's independence.
 Especially fearful of Vietnamese ambitions, the regime pursues a policy
 of neutrality, nonalignment and nonparticipation in any military bloc
 or regional alliance.

 Having no overt Communist Party of its own, Cambodia restricts
 its relations with other Communist countries to state-level contacts.
 Despite its overwhelming reliance on China for economic and military
 assistance, the regime has avoided forming an ideological alliance with
 Peking. Cambodia does not even have diplomatic relations with the
 Soviet Union, but by refraining from public polemics with Moscow, the
 Khmer Communists are keeping the door open to future ties with the
 Kremlin.
 Recent efforts to ease Cambodia's initial diplomatic isolation are
 expected to continue. For the time being, however, the regime is not
 likely to change its hostile attitude toward the US or to make any
 overtures to the US.
 The Khmer Communists have lately been showing an increasing
 interest in forming economic and trade contacts with the rest of the
 world. However, the continued scarcity of export commodities and the
 virtual lack of hard currency earnings is likely to prevent the regime
 from substantially reducing its reliance on Chinese economic and
 military aid for some years to come.

 DISCUSSION
 1. THE DOMESTIC SITUATION: A MAVERICK
 REGIME
 A. Politico-Economic Radicalism
 With its takeover of Phnom Penh in April 1975, the
 new Cambodian regime, controlled by hard-line
 elements of the Khmer Communist movement,
 embarked on a unique totalitarian experiment. The
 most appalling features of this experiment have been
 the uprooting of the population of the urban areas
 and the use of forced labor on a national scale. Both
 of these features are unprecedented in the history of
 the Communist movement.
 In trying to justify their actions, the Khmer
 Communist leaders have put forward a variety of
 considerations. They argued that the lack of foodstuffs
 in the cities swollen by the influx of refugees left no
 alternative but to return the city-dwellers into the
 rural areas. The same move was supposed to remedy
 the problem of the depleted population in the
 countryside which would have otherwise precluded
 the completion of basic agricultural tasks.
 In stark terms, the strategy worked. Having forced
 the total city population to settle in agricultural
 cooperatives, the regime eliminated the need for
 transporting large quantities of food into the urban
 centers. Through the introduction of mass forced
 labor, the Khmer Communists were able to claim a
 satisfactory harvest of rice by the end of the year. The
 utilization of millions of people for the construction of
 a giant country-wide system of dikes and embank-
 ments has been aimed at reducing the country's
 dependence on weather conditions in the future.
 The political considerations have been closely
 related to the economic ones. The Khmer Communists
 calculated that a swollen urban population, expe-
 riencing a severe shortage of food and other consumer
 goods, could become a source of resistance to their
 administration. By driving the entire city population
 to the countryside and moving them around at will,
 the regime managed to cower potentially hostile
 elements and to prevent the emergence of organized
 opposition in the civilian population. Psychological as
 well as material factors, such as the feeling of
 rootlessness, separation from other family members,
 newly-found poverty and the fear of cruel punish-
 ments have effectively prevented former city-dwellers
 from resisting the totalitarian rule of the new regime. *
 Indications are that despite the relatively small
 number of guards assigned to individual agricultural
 collectives-equivalent to the former villages-resist-
 ance to the Khmer Communist administration has
 manifested itself mainly in the form of attempted
 escape rather than in outbreaks of physical hostility
 against the regime.
 Ideological considerations also played a part in the
 Khmer Communists' decision to strip the cities of their
 population. The extreme cruelty with which the
 experiment was carried out reflects a mixture of naive
 utopianism and intense Khmer nationalism which
 may be a reaction to 90 years of French colonial rule.
 The difficult conditions experienced by the Khmer
 Communists during years of guerrilla existence inten-
 sified their resentment toward the "embourgeois-
 ment" of the urban population, their alleged aban-
 donment of Cambodia's cultural and national her-
 itage and indulgence in Western-type conveniences.
 Besides serving an economic function, therefore, the
 driving of the city-dwellers into the countryside and
 exposing them to extremely harsh living and working
 conditions may have been motivated by a naive
 attempt to punish them for the acceptance of what
 the new regime considered a corrupt, reactionary way
 of life.
 * The regime's systematic attempt to eliminate all those
 connected with previous administrations, particularly members of
 the educated stratum, combined with the spread of various diseases
 such as malaria, is believed to have led to the death of hundreds of
 thousands of people, possibly over 10 percent of the entire
 population.

 B. Departure From the "Conventional"        "conventional" Communist pattern and to establish a
 Communist Model                           uniquely Cambodian model.
 The economic system introduced by the Khmer
 Communists following the takeover contradicts the
 economic theories of Marxism-Leninism. The most
 extreme features of the Cambodian economic experi-
 ment have been the banning of all private property
 except the most essential personal belongings of the
 individual, the abolition of the wage system, and the
 nationwide return to a barter economy in the place of
 money as the means of exchange. * These features
 reflect an attempt to adopt a social system based on
 economic utopianism, one which had been envisaged
 in some early Marxist theoretical works but was
 discarded by Communist regimes once in power.**
 There are still other areas in which the Khmer
 Communists remain out of step with the political
 patterns of established Communist regimes. The new
 state Constitution, adopted in December 1975, had
 been drawn up with apparent disregard for the
 experience of other Communist countries. Judging by
 its organizational structure as outlined in the Consti-
 tution, Cambodia is basically a Communist-type
 republic. Up to now, however, the regime has failed to
 specify the exact political system of the new state. As a
 result of this, the text of the Constitution includes no
 reference either to the abolition of the former
 monarchy or to the transition to a republican system.
 The lack of definitions amounting to the concealment
 of established facts have been due to the Khmer
 leadership's efforts to avoid identification with the
 In an extraordinary move, following the takeover the regime
 abolished the monetary system. People are being compensated for
 their labor in the form of meager rice rations. The basic industrial
 items produced by local workshops and the few factories now in
 operation are "sold" to the rural co-operatives in exchange for the
 agricultural products grown by the latter.
 ** Soviet theoretical literature routinely condemns "egalitarian-
 ism" as a petty-bourgeois utopian theory which seeks to prove the
 possibility of eliminating capitalistic contradictions by means of the
 evenhanded redistribution of private property. In China, too,
 manifestations of egalitarianism have in recent years been
 condemned by the Party as being utopian and not in conformity
 with the existing conditions of socialism.  The Chinese state
 Constitution includes specific provisions sanctioning the continued
 existence of private plots and so-called side-line production in the
 countryside. In early 1975, left-radical elements, while conceding
 that commodity production, an unequal wage system and the
 money economy were still necessary at the current stage of
 economic development in China, described the elimination of those
 "bourgeois" practices as a long-term goal.
 In contrast to the usual Communist practice, the
 regime  chose the  ambiguous  term "Democratic
 Cambodia" as the official name of the country. The
 name implies no direct organizational ties with the
 Communist world and allows the Khmer Communists
 to claim membership in the less-structured conglom-
 eration of bloc-free nations known as the nonaligned
 movement.
 C. Ideological Departure: Communism
 Without a Party?
 The potentially most significant departure from the
 "conventional" pattern lies in the regime's refusal to
 publicly identify the KCP as the leading force in
 Democratic Cambodia's political life. Neither the
 Constitution nor any other document issued by the
 Cambodian leadership since the takeover has made
 any reference to the KCP's position vis-a-vis the state
 or confirmed the very existence of the Party.
 Indications are,  however,  that the ideological
 departure of the regime may he a tactical measure
 and as such a temporary one. The KCP is known to
 exist, although its organizational form and member-
 ship remain secret." Some of the top leaders of the
 Cambodian insurgency have been identified as
 leading functionaries of the underground KCP. The
 same men are in charge of the highest offices of the
 Cambodian Communist state.
 There are a number of possible explanations for the
 regime's continued refusal to bring the KCP into the
 open. For one thing, the long years of guerrilla
 existence instilled a strong sense of secretiveness and
 elitism into the Party leadership which might be
 difficult to overcome under the new conditions of
 overt political existence. The same leaders may believe
 that the KCP's reemergence from its underground
 status would necessitate the incorporation of new
 members, a move that might result in diluting its
 strong revolutionary discipline and turning the Party
 into a looser, less cohesive organization. Further, the
 Khmer Communists may have wanted to avoid
 * The Cambodian Communist organization was founded in
 September 1951, follow;ng the dissolution of the Indochinese
 Communist Party which cleared the way for the formation of
 national Communist parties in Indochina. Initially known as the
 Cambodian People's Revolutionary Party, the organization assumed
 its present name only in 1966.

 identifying the Party as the leading force during the
 initial period of repression which has led to the
 displacement of millions and the violent death of
 hundreds of thousands of Cambodians.
 Even more important, the decision to keep the
 Party out of sight enables the Khmer Communists to
 remain silent on their earlier ideological and organiza-
 tional association with the Lao Dong Party, ties that
 the Vietnamese may try to utilize in an attempt to
 interfere with Cambodian developments. The under-
 ground existence of the KCP allows the regime to
 avoid direct party relations with the Vietnamese
 Communists.
 Rather than acknowledging the leading role of the
 KCP, the Khmer Communists invented a unique new
 entity, the so-called "revolutionary organization."
 First used in the early 1970s, the term is but a facade
 for the Communist Party. As such, the revolutionary
 organization has been attributed the same powers and
 qualities other Communist regimes assign to their
 respective parties. Accordingly, the victory of the
 Khmer Communist insurgency has been due to the
 "clearsighted leadership" of the revolutionary organi-
 zation. The same organization is held responsible for
 charting the present and future course of the
 Cambodian revolution.
 As a result of the regime's secretiveness about the
 nature of the revolutionary organization, the term has
 assumed an almost mythical quality. Being a substi-
 tute for the actual KCP, the revolutionary organiza-
 tion is not likely to have such formal components as a
 Central Committee or Politburo. In contrast, the real
 KCP which remains underground, is believed to have
 an organizational structure of its own-including a
 Central Committee-whose members occupy impor-
 tant positions in the state apparatus. Recent informa-
 tion identifying Prime Minister Pol Pot as being
 identical with KCP Secretary General Saloth Sar
 suggests that the Party has retained firm control over
 the state administration and is in charge of the
 political course of the regime.
 D. Middle-Class Leadership
 Following nationwide "elections" in March 1976,
 the Khmer Communists formally established the new
 executive and legislative structure of the Cambodian
 state. The most important offices that emerged in the
 wake of the election farce have been a State
 Presidency, the Government of Democratic Cambodia
 and the Standing Committee of the regime's quasi-
 legislative organ, the People's Representative Assem-
 bly. A survey of nine top functionaries holding
 responsible posts in these offices, as listed in the
 attached chart, reveals some of the essential character-
 istics of the leaders of Democratic Cambodia.
 There are important similarities in age, family and
 educational backgrounds as well as in professional
 experience. The nine men and women included in the
 survey all appear to be in their mid or late 40s; most
 are of middle-class origin and highly educated.
 Almost without exception they received some kind of
 schooling in France, an experience that tends to
 encourage a sense of comradeship within such groups.
 Almost all of those surveyed qualify as members of
 the Cambodian "intelligentsia." Having occupied
 administrative or educational posts upon their return
 from France, they disappeared from Phnom Penh in
 the 1960s to join the anti-Sihanouk forces gathering in
 the hills and jungles of Cambodia. Having established
 themselves as leading functionaries of the Khmer
 insurgency, some were included in Prince Sihanouk's
 Peking-based exile government in the early 1970s.
 Finally, they came to form the top leadership of the
 new executive and legislative organs of Democratic
 Cambodia in April 1976.
 This leadership is also characterized by a significant
 degree of nepotism. Two government ministers, Ieng
 Thirith and Yun Yat, are the wives of two Deputy
 Prime Ministers, leng Sary and Son Sen respectively.
 Moreover, leng Thirith happens to be the sister of
 Khieu Ponnary, who is married to Prime Minister and
 KCP General Secretary Pol Pot/Saloth Sar.
 The latter, appointed Prime Minister of Democratic
 Cambodia in April 1976, appears to be the single most
 influential member of the Khmer Communist leader-
 ship. Born about 1928, Pol Pot/Saloth Sar studied
 technical subjects in Phnom Penh before taking a
 course in electronics in France. Having returned to
 Cambodia in the mid-1950s, he became active in
 leftist journalistic circles and participated in the
 organization of the People's Party, a Communist front
 organization. Married to Khieu Ponnary, a former
 schoolteacher,  Pol  Pot/Saloth  Sar was probably
 accepted by members of the Cambodian French-
 educated professional-administrative elite as a mem-
 ber of the same group. Pol Pot/Saloth Sar disappeared

 I'he positive identification of Pol Pot and Saloth Sar
 as the same person                elped clarify the
 power relationships between the two main executive
 organs of the Cambodian state, the State Presidency
 and the government. Up to then, the State Presidency
 under the chairmanship of Khieu Samphan, a
 nationally recognized personality of solid revolu-
 tionary credentials, appeared to wield equal powers
 wish the government under the little-known Prime
 Minister Poll Pot. The new information on Pol Pot's
 real identity, however, effectively changes that judg-
 ment.
 A decision issued by the Khmer Communist
 leadership in late September authorizing the Prime
 Minister to take temporary leave from his post "in
 orcer to take care of his health which has been had for
 several months," shed some doubt about his future in
 the  (ambodian  hierarchy.  However,  subsequent
 de-clopments suggest that Pol Pot/Saloth Sar may be
 genuinely ill, and remains in favor politically.* His
 temporary absence from political activity may serve as
 another reminder of the secrecy that continues to
 surround all personalities in Communist Cambodia.
 II. FOREIGN RELATIONS: STRIVING
 FOR INDEPENDENCE
 A. In Search of Security
 Since coming to power in April 1975, the Khmer
 Communists have shown as deep a concern about
 maintaining Cambodia's independence from Vietnam
 as the administrations before them. They have paid
 lip service to the country's historical tradition in the
 same fashion as the governments they succeeded and
 adopted fundamentally the same foreign  policy
 Despite the Septemher anmm1FIcrrnent concerning his tenmpo-
 ranl Ieave on medical grounds, Pot Pots name continues to appear
 in Cambodian broadcasts suggesting that he retains the post of
 Prime Minister. 't'he official Cambodian media has thus far failed
 to confirm Pol Pot as being identical with Saloth Sar. As long as the
 KCP is to remain "underground," Salolli Sar is not likely to be
 mentioned in any official capacity in the regime.

 principles formulated by Norodom Sihanouk some
 two decades earlier. The most important components
 of those principles are: independence, neutrality,
 nonalignment and opposition to all forms of foreign
 interference in Cambodia's internal affairs.
 One of the regime's basic preoccupations is to
 prevent foreign military encroachments on Cambo-
 dian territory. The new state Constitution of Demo-
 cratic Cambodia includes a special provision "abso-
 lutely rejecting" the establishment of foreign military
 bases on Cambodian soil, a pledge that the regime has
 been repeating both in the context of bilateral
 relations and that of the security of the entire
 Southeast Asia region.
 Like Sihanouk in the 1950s and 1960s, the
 Cambodian Communist leaders are hoping to find
 some sort of a guarantee for the country's security in
 Cambodia's association with the nonaligned move-
 ment. There is a direct relationship between the
 regime's pledges of nonalignment and nonparticipa-
 tion in military blocs and regional alliances, and its
 refusal to acknowledge Cambodia's status as a full-
 fledged Communist state. The regime is trying to use
 Cambodia's membership in the Third World as an
 excuse for basing its relations with other Communist
 countries on the basically apolitical idea of peaceful
 coexistence rather than on the principles of "proletar-
 ian internationalism."
 The Khmer Communists' close political and eco-
 nomic relations with China serves to accentuate the
 differences in political orientation between them and
 the Vietnamese who appear to be forming increasingly
 close ties with the Soviet Union. In its relations with
 Cambodia, Hanoi's primary aim is to overcome the
 regime's opposition to the spread of Vietnamese
 influence in Southeast Asia. Out of tactical consider-
 ations, therefore, the Vietnamese have been trying to
 avoid any further deterioration of their relations with
 Phnom Penh and appear eager to broaden their
 present limited economic and political contacts with
 the Cambodian Communists.
 B. Ideological Neutralism
 The lack of an overt party organization has enabled
 the Khmer Communists to avoid forming direct party-
 to-party relations with other Communist regimes. In
 communications with friendly Communist govern-
 ments, the Cambodians routinely praise the "clear-
 sighted leadership" of the party involved, without
 referring to direct party-level ties as such.  In
 discussions of Cambodia's relations with other Com-
 munist regimes, the party reference is invariably
 omitted and the existence of friendly contacts between
 "governments" and "peoples" is stressed.
 Up to now, in their contacts with the Cambodian
 regime, most Communist governments have accepted
 this formulation, although for different reasons. The
 more independent-minded members of the Commu-
 nist camp-Cuba, North Korea, Romania and Yugo-
 slavia-view the Cambodian experiment as useful in
 reinforcing their arguments against any binding
 common pattern that would tend to subordinate them
 to the USSR.
 The Chinese Communists, who see Cambodia as a
 bulwark against creeping Soviet expansionism in
 Southeast Asia, not only accept the Cambodian stand
 but have become the primary supporters of the Khmer
 Communist regime.
 The Soviet Union and its closest allies, with whom
 Cambodia has thus far refused to establish diplomatic
 relations, refrain from criticizing the Khmer Commu-
 nist experiment in the fear of driving Phnom Penh
 even closer to Peking.
 The regime's unwillingness to identify Democratic
 Cambodia as a Communist country has allowed the
 Khmer Communists on the whole to refrain from
 using standard Marxist-Leninist terminology. This
 omission is particularly significant when it comes to
 terms some Communist regimes consider offensive,
 such as "revisionist," "dogmatist," etc. By omitting
 the use of such terminology, the Khmer Communists
 have managed to retain a semblance of neutralism in
 the ideological conflict between Moscow and Peking.

 Despite their close economic and political ties with
 the Chinese, the regime has resisted full ideological
 identification with Chinese Communism.  In its
 contacts with Peking, the Cambodian leadership
 25X1      retains a certain formality:
 25X1                          roadcasts devoted to various
 aspects of Cambodian-Chinese relations speak of the
 friendship between the two "countries" and two
 `peoples" without implying direct relations between
 the two parties. At the same time, despite their refusal
 to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet
 UJnion, the Khmer Communists have refrained from
 engaging in public polemics with the Soviet leader-
 ship on political or ideological issues. Instead, the
 regime has retained occasional contacts with Moscow
 in the form of anniversary messages and greetings, in
 conformity with the minimum standards of protocol
 between independent Communist states.
 Possibly as a sign of disagreement within the Khmer
 t :ommunist leadership on Cambodia's indebtedness
 to Mao Tse-tung, in statements devoted to Mao's
 memory last September the regime came near to
 abandoning its neutralist line on ideological issues. A
 eulogy delivered by Prime Minister Pol Pot/Saloth Sar
 on the occasion of Mao's funeral used an unusual
 ormulation equating the role of the revolutionary
 organization-the term used by the Khmer Commu-
 nists in lieu of the Party-with that of the Communist
 I'arty of China. The same eulogy also maintained that
 the revolutionary organization,  like the Chinese
 Communist Party,  adhered to the principles of
 Marxism-Leninism, a statement never before made by
 any Cambodian Communist leader in public. More-
 over,  Pol Pot/Saloth Sar departed from earlier
 Cambodian practice by praising Mao as the "most
 :prominent teacher in the international revolutionary
 movement since Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin."
 A subsequent Cambodian broadcast, made on the
 occasion of the Chinese national day celebrations in
 early October, paraphrased the above statements in a
 manner implying even closer identity with Chinese
 ideological formulations. The broadcast in effect
 misquoted Pol Pot in alleging that
 ... The Comrade Prime Minister of our country remarked that
 the Chinese revolution under the wise and correct leadership of
 Chairman Mao produced experiences which have set the best
 and  most valuable examples for the contemporary world
 revolutionary movement since Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin.
 Despite the references to a "revolutionary" rather
 than a "Communist" movement, the above state-
 ments tended considerably to weaken the Khmer
 Communists' earlier effort to retain a neutral stand
 between China and the Soviet Union.
 However, indications are that this bias toward the
 Chinese ideological line was only temporary: by mid-
 October a new formulation appeared, considerably
 watering down the role attributed to Mao in shaping
 Marxist theory and avoiding any references to Stalin
 as one of the "prominent teachers" of the interna-
 tional revolutionary movement. The new formulation
 described Mao as a mere "inheritor" of the theories of
 Marx and Lenin and made no mention whatsoever of
 Stalin. *
 C. The Shedding of Isolationism
 The isolationism that characterized the first year of
 Khmer Communist rule has since given way to
 increasing receptiveness to foreign contacts. Through-
 out 1975 the Cambodian regime maintained diplo-
 matic ties only with Communist regimes it considered
 free from Moscow's domination.** However, the
 standards laid down by the Cambodians were flexible
 enough to include, in addition to China and Albania,
 regimes of such diverse political and ideological
 orientations as Cuba, North Korea, Romania, Yugo-
 slavia and Laos.
 Following the takeover, the Cambodian regime's
 relations with Vietnam showed increasing strains due
 to continued Vietnamese incursions into Cambodian
 territory and conflicting territorial claims-particu-
 larly concerning some offshore islands-that remain
 outstanding. These differences, compounded by Cam-
 bodia's concern over the growing friendship between
 Hanoi and Moscow, have kept political relations
 between the two neighboring regimes at an unusually
 low level.  Despite diplomatic contacts and the
 inauguration of a Hanoi-Phnom Penh flight last
 September, economic relations between Vietnam and
 Cambodia are virtually nonexistent. In defining their
 relations with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam,

 ** The single exception was Thailand; the regime negotiated
 diplomatic relations with Bangkok in October 1975 without,
 however, exchanging embassies. As of the end of 1976, contacts are
 still being maintained at the liaison office level.

 Cambodian leaders have referred to unspecified
 "hardships and obstacles" which, according to them,
 must be overcome if contacts are to develop on a
 friendly basis. *
 In contrast, the Cambodian regime's relations with
 its closest non-Communist neighbor, Thailand, have
 been progressing relatively smoothly. Despite poten-
 tially serious problems between the two countries,
 such as the presence of over 10,000 Cambodian
 refugees on Thai territory, Phnom Penh's handling of
 its relations with Thailand has been characterized by
 a large degree of flexibility. At the time of establishing
 diplomatic relations with the Thai Government in late
 1975, the Khmer Communists defied a concerted Lao-
 Vietnamese campaign against Bangkok, aimed at
 pressuring the Thais to rid the country of American
 presence. One year later, the Khmer refusal to echo
 Vietnamese propaganda attacks on Thailand follow-
 ing the Thai military coup, suggested the regime's
 eagerness to retain a balance between its Communist
 and non-Communist neighbors.
 In 1976, Cambodia recognized more non-Commu-
 nist governments, particularly members of the Third
 World. Moreover, the Khmer Communists also
 negotiated recognition-although without exchanging
 ambassadors-with selected  industrialized nations
 such as Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Norway, and Japan.
 The regime's main criterion in establishing relations
 with any given country is that country's willingness to
 abide by the general principles of Cambodia's foreign
 policies without pressing for an embassy in Phnom
 Penh. The Khmer Communists' reluctance to accom-
 modate more than a handful of diplomatic represen-
 tatives in the capital appear to be based on both
 economic and security considerations. Experiences of
 Communist diplomats stationed in Cambodia may
 help dissuade other governments from exposing their
 personnel to the hardships and restrictions of Phnom
 Penh living.
 The one area in which the Khmer Communists
 continue to show a complete lack of flexibility is their
 attitude toward the US. Anti-Americanism remains an
 integral part of the regime's political philosophy. The
 Siem Reap "bombing" incident may have been
 specifically designed to make the US a scapegoat for
 Cambodia's internal and external difficulties. The
 extreme anti-American propaganda is also being used
 by the regime to justify its continued repression of the
 population. Cambodia's rigid anti-US stance is out of
 line with that of most other Communist regimes; it is
 comparable only with the policies of North Korea and
 Albania, countries subject to political and economic
 isolation similar to that of the Cambodian regime.
 Any change in Cambodia's anti-US stand is likely to
 reflect a calculation that a less hostile position may
 facilitate the acquisition of economic aid from the
 West.
 D. The Shackles of Foreign Assistance
 The regime's radical economic practices, its reliance
 on the permanent resettlement and total mobilization
 of the population reflect an obsession with the
 development of agricultural production. Specifically,
 the Khmer Communists want to produce a sufficient
 amount of rice for export even if it means to keep the
 population on starvation rations. * The use of forced
 labor on a nationwide scale for the construction of an
 elaborate system of dikes and field embankments is
 aimed at eventually reducing Cambodia's depen-
 dence on the annual rainfall. In the long run,
 however, the extreme means by which the Khmer
 Communists hope to accelerate the fulfillment of the
 agricultural tasks-the complete abolition of private
 property and material incentives-must slow down
 progress.
 The emptying of the urban areas of their inhabi-
 tants and the permanent settlement of the city
 population in the countryside are bound to have a
 detrimental effect on the rehabilitation of the industry
 which was severely damaged during the war. There
 are no plans to expand the country's industrial
 capacity,** and the systematic elimination of the
 educated professional strata should for a long time
 necessitate dependence on less sophisticated technol-
 ogies. As a result of this, Cambodia will remain reliant
 on its traditional commodities for export, such as
 lumber, crepe rubber and rice.

 Since the takeover, the Khmer Communist regime
 has been overwhelmingly dependent on Chinese
 economic and military assistance.*  It was with
 Chinese help that the regime rehabilitated some of its
 transport facilities, opened up its only seaport for
 shipping and put some of its industrial plants back
 into operation.  Although the financial terms of
 Chinese assistance are not known, the long-term
 reliance on China is bound to pose some economic
 and political problems. Economically, the steady flow
 of material and technological assistance provided by
 the Chinese is likely to increase the Cambodian
 regime's indebtedness to Peking.  Politically,  the
 combination of that indebtedness and the growing
 Chinese presence in Cambodia would tend further ro
 restrict the regime's limited freedom of action in the
 area of foreign relations.
 In a possible effort to reduce its dependence on the
 Chinese, in the second part of 1976 the Cambodian
 regime made some attempts toward the establishment
 of economic contacts with foreign countries, mainly
 friendly Communist regimes and members of the
 Third World. In September, a Cambodian economic
 delegation held extensive talks with Yugoslav, Alba-
 nian and Romanian economic experts; the same
 delegation visited North Korea in early October.
 About the same time, the regime established contacts
 * During 1975 and 1976, Cambodia did receive some assistance
 also from the North Korean regime. Indications are that a small
 number of North Korean technicians may be working in the
 country.
 with nonaligned groups by participating in interna-
 tional conferences on economic and industrial cooper-
 ation among Third 'World nations. The Cambodians
 also began to drop hints of their willingness to initiate
 trade relations with a limited number of industrial
 countries. *
 None of these exploratory moves is known to have
 produced any concrete results. However, by making
 such contacts, the regime signalled its interest in
 entering into bilateral or multilateral agreements on
 trade and economic cooperation with a broader group
 of nations. The fundamental, long-term problem the
 Khmer Communists are facing in this respect is the
 continued scarcity of exportable commodities and the
 resultant lack of foreign currency earnings. Economic
 relations with foreign countries, Communist or other-
 wise, must therefore be conducted mainly on the basis
 of new grants and credit arrangements which would
 further increase Cambodia's financial obligations to
 the outside world. Consequently, even if it were to
 broaden its economic contacts to a growing number of
 foreign countries, the regime is not likely for some
 time to come to free itself from its present one-sided
 dependence on China for economic and military
 assistance.
 * As something of an exploratory venture, in August 1976 the
 Cambodian Government set up a quasi-official trading company in
 Hong Kong. With the exception of some minor initial purchases,
 the office, called the Ren Fung Company Ltd., appears to be
 inactive.
