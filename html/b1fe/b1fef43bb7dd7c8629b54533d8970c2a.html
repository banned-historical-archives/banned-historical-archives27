 IVIXON MIDEAST TOUR
 MOSCOW PROVIDES BRIEF. FACTUAL COVERAGE. SCANTY COMMENT
 Moscow media have continued the muted, straightforward reporting
 on President Nixon's Mideast trip, briefly noting his arrival in
 each country.  Apart from a Radio Peace and Progress commentary on
 the 18th pegged to the U.S.-Israeli statement, Moscow comment for
 the second week  as been confined to PRAVDA's weekly international
 review.  TASS and the central press gave some aspects of the visits
 fuller treatment, summarizing statements by the U.C. and Egyptian
 presidents opening the Cairo talks and the statement of principles
 issued at the and of that visit, as well as dinner speeches in
 Damascus and the U.S.-Israeli statement concluding the President's
 visit there.
 M
 Predictably, Soviet leaders did not mention President Nixon's
 Middle East tour in their Supreme Soviet election speeches.  Aside
 from a bread hint by Brezhnev that the USSR might be entertaining
 the idea of resuming diplomatic relations with Israel in his own
 election speech, the Soviet top leadership confined Middle East
 references to standard formulations.  Meager Soviet comment on the
 Arab-Israeli issue generally has also continued the same tack:
 Without mentioning the President's tour, Moscow has complained
 about "fabrications" in Western newspapers regarding Arab-Soviet
 relations and has continued to portray the Soviet Union as Middle
 East peacemaker.
 MOSCOW COMMENT     The PRAVDA review on the 16th noted that the
 Arabs had rightly regarded the United States as
 "the accomplice of the Israeli aggressors," but that the new
 international climate provided an opportunity for a change in the
 nature of U.S.-Arab relations.  Obliquely suggesting Moscow's
 misgivings over the implications of this change, PRAVDA ascribed
 to "cold war advocates" a desire to interpret the President's
 trip "in their own way and use it for a campaign aimed at under-
 mining Arab-Soviet friendship."  The paper claimed that the Arabs
 themselves were rebuffing such attempts, and cited a Beirut paper
 as stressing that developing relations with the United States
 should not supplant the "historical friendship" with the Soviet
 Union.  The PRAVDA review displayed sensitivity over what it
 described as "rightwing press" assertions that U.S. policy would
 lead to elimination of the USSR's influence in the Middle East.
 Replying to "Western observers" who were displaying enthusiasm for
 "'Americanization' of the Middle East," PRAVDA recalled Secretary

 Kissinger's assurance in his 6 June news conference that the
 United States had neither the intention nor the capability to
 eliminate Soviet influence from the region.
 The Radio Peace and Progress commentary in Arabic on the 18th
 saw the U.S. affirmation of readiness to provide Israel with
 weapons on a long-term basis and supply "substantial" economic,
 assistance as encouragement to the Israelis to maintain their
 occupation of Arab territory.  While the broadcast cautioned
 against alleged U.S. and Israeli efforts to postpone resumption
 of the Geneva conference in order that they might deal with the
 Arab states separately, it did acknowledge that "certain changes"
 had occurred inthe.United States' Mideast, policy which gave the
 Arabs "an opportunity to alter their relations with ,America.'..,
 it ascribed much of the credit for these changes to the Soviet
 Union.
 COVERAGE OF VISIT     In limited reports on the various speeches
 made during the trip, Moscow has tended to
 play up statements that coincide with its own propaganda positions
 on the Middle East problem.  Thus, an Arabic-language broadcast
 on the 14th cited Egyptian President as-Sadat as declaring that
 disengagement was only a step toward solving the issue on the
 basib of Security Council resolutions.  Syrian President al-Asad
 was similarly quoted by TASS on the 16th as calling disengagement
 a first step toward a firm peace.  The TASS account noted President
 Nixon's remark that the first steps already taken were only a
 beginning, and the task was now to advance step by step toward
 a just and lasting peace.  TASS also cited the President as saying
 the United States understood Syria's concern over the Palestinian
 question.
 In reporting the U.S.-Egyptian statement of principles, TA3: on
 the 14th made no mention of the fact that the document called for
 a peace settlement that would take  into account the "legitimate
 interests of all the peoples of the Middle East, including the
 Palestinian people."  The account did note that the statement
 declared peace could only be attained through negotiations within
 the framework of the Geneva peace conference.  TASS also reported
 that the United States and Egypt would begin negotiating an agree-
 ment on nuclear energy, and that a provisional agreement would be
 ,concluded this month on delivery of U.S. nuclear fuel to Egypt.
 A 37 June 'PASS report on the U.S.-Israeli statement also noted that
 the two countries would sign an agreement on cooperation in nuclear
 energy and U.S. delivery of nuclear fuel to Israel, and that a

 19 JUNE 1974
 temporary agreement on the sale of such fuel would be signed this
 month.  The TASS account focused on the matter of aid, reporting
 that the President reaffirmed that military deliveries would be
 continued on a long-term basis and that the United States would
 give "substantial economic 'aid "' to cover Israel's expenses in
 maintaining its military potential.
 TASS on the 16th reported without comment the announcement on the
 resumption of U.S.-Syrian relations.  TASS reports on the U.S.-Israeli
 and U.S.-Jordanian statements noted the President's invitations
 to Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and King Husayn to visit the United
 States, but the invitation to President as-Sadat was not mentioned
 in TASS' report on the U.S.-Egyptian statement.  Other than a two-
 sentence report on the President's arrival in Jiddah, the visit to
 Saudi AraLia was ignored.
 BREZHNEV CN MIDEAST      In a possible hint of Soviet readiness to
 resume diplomatic relations with Israel,
 Brezhnev in his 14 June Supreme. Soviet election speech declared
 that "progress" toward a settlement would create conditions for
 the development of Soviet relations with "all" countries of the
 region.  This is by far the broadest hint of this nature to be
 made by any Soviet leader since the October war.*  Heretofore,
 the only remarks on this subject had been limited to the assertion
 that the Soviet Union did not oppose Israel as such but only its
 policies.  Gromyko took this position in his 21 December 1973
 address to the opening session of the Geneva conference.  He
 added that "the situation may change when Israel will confirm with
 deeds its readiness to accept an honest and mutually acceptable
 settlement."  Kosygin had indicated much the same position when
 questioned at a Stockholm press conference on 5 April last year
 about resumption of Soviet-Israeli relations.  According to NEW TIMES
 ,(No. 15, 13 April. 1973), Kosygin,. said,,theLSoviet Union. believed- .
 the state of Israel had a right to exist, "but this does not mean
 that we can come to terms with its aggressiorL."
 On other Mideast issues, Brezhnev referred rpprovingly to the
 Sinai and Golan disengagement agreements, but in keeping with
 recent Soviet comment described them as "only the first steps."
 He declared that examination of the "main questicns" at the Geneva
 peace conference would be an "extremely complicated task" which would
 *  Israeli Foreign Minister Alon was reported by.Jerusalem radio on
 19 June as saying he saw no change in the USSR's Middle East policy
 and that relations with the Soviet Union "are as'bad as they have
 ever been since diplomatic relations were broken."

 require the joint effortc3 of the "states" taking part in the
 conference.  Although he did not refer directly to Palestinian
 representation, his use of the word "states" rather than parties
 or participants could be taken as an indication that Moscow might
 be inclining toward Palestinian inclusion under the auspices of
 the Jordanian delegation.  The Soviet Union has not spelled out
 its position on this point; it is on record only as endorsing an
 undefined Palestinian presence at Geneva.  It is equally possible
 that Moscow is still undecided on the best way of handling
 Palestinian representation as long as the concerned Arab states
 and the Palestinians have not thrashed this out among themselves.
 OTHER SOVIET LEADERS     Remarks on the Middle East problem in
 election speeches by other Soviet leaders
 reiterated standard themes.  Podgornyy on the 13th said only that
 despite the fact that a start had been made on talks for a political
 settlement, "a highly complex situation" still prevailed in the
 region.  Kosygin on the 12th noted that the conflict was shifting
 to the arena of political settlement, and declared that the "forth-
 coming continuation" of the Geneva conference must lead to a
 solution of the "main problems"--Israeli withdrawal from all
 occupied Arab territories, insuring the lawful rights of the
 Palestinians, and guaranteeing the security of all states of the
 region.
 Gromyko, speaking in Minsk on the 10th, insisted that disengagement
 was only the first step toward a settlement and the first step,
 in the "liberation of Arab lands."  He predicted that the struggle
 for a genuine settlement within the Geneva framework would be a
 difficult one.  Unlike the other Soviet leaders, Gromyko repeated
 previous Soviet admonitions against partial measures:  "One cannot
 allow just half measures to which Israel and its protectors would
 like to restrict themselves," he declared, adding that Israel had
 yet to furnish proof of its readiness to turn from a "policy of
 aggression" to a policy of peace.
 EAST EUROPE ALLIES SEE UNCHANGED U.S. AIMS. DEFEND KISSINGER
 With varying degrees of intensity, scattered comment from Moscow's
 orthodox East European allies generally argued that President
 Nixon's tour did not signify any basic change in "imperialist"
 aims in the Middle East, but was undertaken because of "realistic"
 U.S. awareness of the new Arab clout stemming from successes
 in the October war and the oil embargo.  These countries'.commentators
 saw a connection between the trip and the President's Watergate-related

 difficulties at home,. reiterating their standard charge that the
 President's critics are motivated mainly by opposition to detente.
 Such motives were flamed by Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia
 for the attacks on Secretary Kissinger, in the wake of the Secretary's
 Salzburg press conference.  The orthodox East European comment also
 duly included tributes to the Mideast role of the Soviet Union,
 under Brezhnev's leadership.
 U.S. POLICY     Czechoslovakia's Brati.s.lava PRAVDA on 13 June,
 viewing the President's trip e,a "unrluestionably
 the high point of a demonstration of the 'new' U.S. policy" in the
 Middle East, charged at the same time that the United States and
 "other imperialist forces" aimed, as before, at capitalist ex-
 ploitation and undermining of progressive forces in the area.
 Dominant in U.S. thinking, the commentary added, was the real-
 ization that oil is found in the Arab countries, not in Israel.
 Another Bratislava paper, SMENA, declared on the 19th that the
 results of the President's visit to Israel confirmed that there
 were "no essential changes" in U.S. policy toward the Arabs or its
 political, financial, and military support to Israel.  On the 15th,
 a dispatch from RUDE PRAVO's Washington correspondent predicted
 that while the President would be welcomed throughout his tour, he
 would be repeatedly confronted with the "decisive," still unsolved
 Palestinian problem, first raised by President as-Sadat during
 the Cairo visit. The dispatch paid tribute to the results of
 Moscow's "patient And unostentatious diplomacy" in persuading the
 Arabs to accept a UN settlement.  The East Berlin domestic service
 on the 18th grudgingly praised the President for pressing Israel
 into a "change of course" toward a peaceful solution.  The commentary
 doubted at the same time whether the President's influence could be
 "decisive" on this score.
 While Prague; Sofia;. and East. Berlin took a largely cynical view
 regarding allegedly unchanged U,S. pro-Israeli policy, Poland and
 Hungary were relatively muted on this score.  Thus, ZY.CIF, WARSd%AWY
 on the 12th was favorable in tone in attributing two basic aims to
 the President's trip:  first, to convince the Arabs through aid
 agreements that the present, more evenhanded U.S. policy represented
 "a durable change"; and second, to show Moscow, on the eve of the
 President's trip there, his readiness to cooperate with the USSR
 in restoring peace to the area.  The paper noted in this connection
 that President Nixon "is known as a consistent advocate of detente
 and coexistence."  And the Budapest daily MAGYAR NEMZET, also on
 the 12th, praised the timing of the trip--after the troop disengagement
 agreements and before the next phase of the Geneva negotiations and
 the Moscow summit--and predicted that a just settlement could be

 achieved "if all sides display good will."  An 18 June connnentary
 on Budapest domestic TV, while characterizing current U.S. Mides.st
 policy as "a double game," assessed the overall results of the tour
 as "fruitful" and "successful" with regard to detente and to the
 President's standing at home.
 WATERGATE     In pointing to domestic motivations for the President's
 trip, Bratislava PRAVDA on the 12th stressed that he
 "is under the furious pressures of the adversaries of detente, and
 this is reflkseted'!: in the course of the Watergate affair" and the
 Congressional impeachment deliberations.  In favorable tones, the
 commentary noted that the Middle East trip could divert attention
 from these domestic matters and direct it toward the Nixo-,:: Admin-
 istration's efforts to complete the transition from a policy of
 confrontation to one of negotiation.  In a similar vein, c talk on
 the Budapest domestic radio on the 10th...remarked that "while the
 wrangling over the raising of impeachment charges is in progress
 in Congress and in other forums, the American President is obviously
 concentrating his efforts on international diplomacy."  And the
 12 June ZYCIE WARStAWY also gave the President the benefit of the
 doubt in commenting that "it would be a considerable simplification
 to place this trip, as some commentators are doing, merely in the
 context of the political showdown between the White House and
 Congress," adding theft "its scope and significance reach far beyond
 Washington."
 KISSINGER     The Hungarians, followed by Czechoslovakia and Poland,.
 promptly denounced the charges against Secretary
 Kissinger which occasioned. his threat to resign at his 11 June press
 conference in Salzburg.  Early the next day the Budapest radio carried
 a comment from its New York correspondent to the effect that, in
 the U.S. domestic'controversy, "the attack is now directed, through
 the person of the Secretary of state, against the main foreign policy
 line of the Nixon Administration."  A Budapest TV commentary the
 same day predicted that the possibility of Kissinger's resignation
 would cast a shadow over the President's talks with both Arab and
 Israeli leaders.  This talk, as well as the government paper MAGYAR
 'EIRLAP the next day,, publicized favorable comments on Kissinger by
 Senator Fulbright and other Congressional leaders.
 Subsequent attacks on the Secretary's critics by Polish media
 culminated in a 16 June Broniarek commentary in the party daily
 TRYBUNA LUDU.  Entitled "Rumors and Insinuations," the article
 construed the charges against Kissinger as a warning from pro.-
 Israeli elements to the Secretary and President Nixon that they
 should not lose sight of Israel's interests during negotiations

 with the Arabs.  The article also characterized the charges as
 "a new stage (since H. Kissinger has been spared up to now)" of
 the alleged campaign by U.S. politicians, such as Senator Jackson,
 against U.S.-Soviet detente.
 A Washington correspondent's dispatch published in Prague's RUDE
 PRAVO on the 14th, while cautioning that speculation regarding
 Kissinger's guilt or innocence would be premature, denounced
 the raibirg of "old charges" against the Secretary at this
 juncture--at the start of the President's Mideast trip and before
 the Moscow summit.  Charging that the Washington POST played "a
 considerable role in the anti-Kissinger campaign," the dispatch
 added that "once it proved impossible to wreck Nixon's trip to
 Moscow, Kissinger was placed on the firing line."
 BUCHAREST. BELGRADE, TIRANA GIVE VARYING TREATMENT OF TOUR
 A sizeable volume of Yugoslav comment was uniformly favorable
 both with regard to the President's tour and to Secretary Kissinger,
 while the Romanians have thus far refrained from commenting on the
 trip, limiting their coverage to brief, factual reports.  Albanian
 comment, predictably hostile to the President and Kissinger, viewed
 the tour as symbolizing both conflict and "collusion" between
 Moscow and Washington.
 ROMANIA     As the only East European country that has relations
 with Israel, Romania was virtually silent about the
 trip, limiting its coverage to terse reports.  Refraining from
 comment, it avoided having to join or break with the other Warsaw
 Pact countries in their praise of the Soviet Union's role in the
 Middle East situation.  The party daily SCINTEIA noted in a Cairo
 dispatch on the 12th that the "normalization" of U.S.-Egyptian
 relations was taking place "in the framework of important develop-
 ments which occurred in the Mideast situation, that is, the Geneva
 conference and the disengagement on the Sinai and Golan fronts."
 However, it avoided any reference to either the U.S. or Soviet
 mediating roles.    This contrasted with a 1 June SCINTEIA article
 on. the Syrian-Israeli disengagement, in which Gromyko and the Soviet
 Union were given praise equal to that for Kissinger and the United
 States.

 ing the Mideast and expressed opt{mism that the visit would serve

 useful purposes.  Belgrade generally displayed little concern that
 the visit might create problems in U.S.-Soviet or Arab-Soviet re-
 lations.
 Describing the visit as "undoubtedly useful," BORBA on the 11th
 viewed it as. necessary to "disclose the depth and complexity!' of
 the Mideast crisis, but noted that its "full significance" would
 be measured by progress achieved in oettI,ing :the .crisis; "',B11grade
 media repeatedly emphasized that the crisis could not be settled
 without resolving the Palestinian question, and on the 15th a
 TANJUG commentary singled out as the "greatest result" of the
 visit up to that time the U.S.-Egyptian statement recognizing the
 "interests" of the Palestinians.  TANJUG pointed out, however,
 the distinction between "interests" and "a real act of granting
 recognition to the national rights. of the people of Palestine,"
 which "is still rejected in practice."  Even prior to the sign-
 ing of the communique, Belgrade radio commentator Milutin Milenkovic
 on the 12th pointed out Arab satisfaction with the trend in U.S.
 relations, citing the opinion of unnamed Ara?.; sources that the
 United States had "essentially changed its position" on the Mideast
 situation and was adopting "an objective, and even a neutral,
 mediating" role between the. Arabs and Israelis.  Milenkovic
 qualified these observations by noting that "no breaking up of
 the real alliance" with Israel had occurred.
 Yugoslav comment on Moscow's-attitude toward the trip shifted
 somewhat following the tumultuous.: welcome given the President
 in Egypt.  A Teslic BORBA commentary on the 11th, the day before
 his arrival, maintained that the visit was "welcomed" not only
 by the Arabs and-the Israelis but also by the Soviet Union, which
 saw the tour as a "component and indispensable part of joint
 American-Soviet efforts to reach a just solution of the crisis
 through negotiations in Geneva."  The Egyptians' enthusiastic
 welcome for Nixon, however, saemed to raise questions about
 possible Soviet irritation.  On the 17th Zagreb radio commentator
 Milika Sundic described the Cairo treatment as an "embarrassing
 episode" which, he said, would be "quickly forgotten, if for no
 other reason than because it is not in the interest of the United
 States to upset relations with Moscow."  Claiming that Washington-
 Moscow relations remained not only good "but even better," Sundic
 predicted that Cairo would do all in its power to "iron out its
 difficulties with Moscow as soon as possible."

 Comment on Kissinger's Salzburg press conference was generally
 sympathetic.  On the day after the news conference TANJUG cited
 Arab press comment that allegations against Kissinger were the
 result of a "Zionist conspiracy" aimed at undermining the visit,
 and Belgrade radio commentator Kosta Timotijevic forecast that
 Kissinger "has all the chances to survive politically both the
 present and who knows how many future presidents,"
 ALBANIA     Tirana comment emphasized that the United States had
 not abandoned its close ties with Israel and that
 President Nixon was aiming at strengthening Washington's "imperialist"
 influence in the Arab countries at the expense of Moscow, even though
 the two big powers continued to operate in "collusion" against the
 Arabs,  On the opening day of the trip the Tirana domestic radio in
 an unattributed commentary outlined the President's three main
 objectives:  to present U.S. "imperialism" as "peaceloving" and to
 gain "political capital at home"; to erase the image in Arab minds
 of the United States as "pro-Israeli, warmongering. and profoundly
 hostile" to the Arabs; and to "undermine" Moscow's position, just
 as Moscow was trying to do to Washington.  The Washington-Moscow
 rivalry, however, was viewed as tempered by an "understanding"
 between the two that fundamental Mideast problems should remain
 unsettled so that the two superpowers could emerge in the future
 in the role of "arbiters of the fate of the Arab peoples under the
 guise of so-called special responsibilities" in the Mideast.
 The party daily ZERI I POPULLIT, in an article carried in full by
 ATA on the 13th,contgnded that President Nixon was practically
 forced to visit the Arab states in order to seek a "disengagement"
 between them and the United States once he had seen the "dark
 perspective" both for the United States and Israel resulting from
 Arab successes in the October war, the oil embargo, and rising
 public opinion in favor of the Arabs.  The daily warned the Arabs
 to beware of "vain promises for peace" and "various diplomatic
 maneuvers."
 Picking up American press reports on Kissinger's alleged wire-
 tapping role, Tirana portrayed the allegations as facts.  In an
 unattributed article titled "Kissinger--Participant in the Water-
 gate Scandal," ZERI I POPULLIT on the 11th cited the Washington
 STAR-NEWS as reporting that "he had failed to speak the truth"
 in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last
 September.  Although Kissinger's Salzburg press conference was
 ignored, ATA on the 18th interpreted the Mideast visit as designed
 to save both Nixon's and Kissinger's "skins."

 SOVIET ELECTION SPEECHES
 POLITBURO SHOWS CONFIDENCE ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC TRENDS
 In the current round of electioneering for the USSR Supreme Soviet,
 begun on 18 April. and completed on 16 June, Soviet leaders have
 sought to project a public image of confidence about the course of
 world affairs.  Following the pattern of previous elections, most
 of the leaders' speeches were made at republic or regional
 gatherings and were carried in full by local media and reported
 in abbreviated summaries in the central press.  The speeches in
 Moscow by the CPSU Politburo troika--Brezhnev, Podgornyy and
 Kosygin--received the most extensive national publicity, with
 Brezhnev's climactic election speech the only one to be carried
 in full by the central press and on all domestic radio channels.
 The version of Kosygin's remarks which appeared in MOSKOVSKAYA
 PRAVDA, however, was slightly longer than Brezhnev's speech,
 which in turn was longer than Podgornyy's.
 In the distribution of plaudits, Brezhnev was praised lavishly not
 only by members of his own political entourage but also by leaders
 of unmistakably independent stature.  The conspicuous display of
 support for Brezhnev's leadership, which has been subjected to
 increasingly heavy veiled criticism since mid-October of last
 year,* suggests that the praise may be essentially an exercise in
 public relations designed to project an image of "monolithic
 unity" on the eve of President Nixon's visit to Moscow.
 TROIKA ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS     Kosygin staked out a position as
 the most consistent advocate of
 international cooperation within the leadership in his remarks
 carried live on Moscow domestic radio on 12 June.  Podgornyy, on
 the other hand, adopted the stance of a more cautious supporter
 of detente in his 13 June speech, emphasizing still urgent
 internaticnal problems and paying greater deference to the special
 role of Soviet might and initiative in compelling Western leaders
 to recognize the futility of a policy of confrontation toward the
 Soviet Union.  In this respect, the .twa -leadera::seemed, to be
 addressing constituencies at different ends of the political
 spectrum.

 Brezhnev, in closing nut this round of speeches on the l'th in
 a live broadcast from the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses,
 avoided both extremes in giving the most detailed exposition
 of Soviet foreign policy,  Brezhnev dwelt on Soviet detente
 initiatives, breaking new ground in some areas, while at the
 same time paying homage to Soviet defense might and eschewing
 the more outspokenly internationalist orientation of Kosygin.
 All three leaders, as well as virtually all others speaking
 during the election campaign, reaffirmed the recent Soviet
 priorities in world affairs, combining a recognition of the
 decisive role of U.S.-Soviet relations in furthering the aims,
 of Soviet detente diplomacy with condemnation of Peking for
 its alliance with the most reactionary elements of "imperialism."
 Kosygin returned repeatedly to the theme of international, inter-
 dependenco, arguing that the balance of power and the level of
 armaments made detente and international cooperation the only
 feasible solution to internationp' disputes.  What was urgently
 needed, he maintained, was "a new 4ystem of international
 relations which corresponds to the interests not of just one
 state or a narrow group but of all mankind."  Notably, most of
 these remarks were dropped from the slightly abridged version
 of his speech which appeared in PRAVDA and IZVESTIYA.  Kosygin
 pointed to favorable developments in Vietnam and the Middle East
 and the "substantial progress" since the 24th CPSU Conprois in
 1971 in eliminating "'iotbeds" of international conflict.  He
 noted that Washington and Moscow had agreed to "coordinate"
 their foreign policies in the interests of peace.
 Podgornyy, avoiding the internationalist rhetoric of Kosygin,
 focused instead on the role of Soviet might and the changing
 world balance of power its effectuating the "turnabout" from
 confrontation to detente.  His assessment of the state of the world
 also contrasted with that of Kosygin.  According Lo Podgornyy,
 detente was gaining strength, but because it was outly in its
 initial stages, it was "hard to say" how long the rest of the trip
 would take.  Shelepin and Ponomarev had anticipated Podgornyy:.in
 pointing out that detente was only in its first stages.  Podgornyy
 pointed to the "highly complex" situation in the Middle East and
 the continuing struggles in Vietnam and Cambodia as trouble spots
 threatening "the outbreak of new armed conflicts."  His emphasis
 on the pitfalls in the international situation was underscored
 by his warning about the "increasing nuclear missile potential"
 of China.  Only Grechko, among the top Soviet leaders, has previously
 evinced similar concern, in remarks made last January in an awards
 speech in Kazan that were deleted from the abbreviated summary
 published in the central press.

 Brezhnev seemed closer to Kosygin than to Podgornyy in his
 c,ptimistio account of Soviet detente diplomacy, his portrayal
 of the "obvious progress" in U.S.-Soviet relations, and his
 closing remark that the change of government in Portugal,
 not that in Chile, represented the prevailing trend in world
 affairs.  Like Kosygin, Brezhnev saw progress in Vietnam rid
 the Middle East and concluded that the 24th Congress peace
 program plank on eliminating "hotbeds" of conflict was being
 successfully fulfilled.  Brezhnev placed particular importance
 on reaching further agreements with the United States on arms
 limitation in announcing readiness to sign a ban on underground
 nuclear tests and reach agreeement on lim:ting the development
 of new types of weapons. He dismissed "pessimistic assessments"
 in the foreign press about the President's upcoming visit.
 But like Podgornyy, Brezhnev made only passing reference to the
 theme of international interdependence.  While acknowledging
 with Kosygin the foreig  policy role of Soviet defense might,
 Brezhnev went on to note that because of a "failure to halt the
 arms race," Moscow must continue to strengthen its defense might.
 At the same time, Brezhnev drew from arguments by spokesmen
 from Moscow's prestigious foreign policy institutes in maintaining
 that national security was not sync,nymous with military might.
 In. a remark that seemed Clearly aimed at those opposed to
 limitaUiauscon,:the.Soviet atrategic.:arsenal, Brezhaev,played down
 the risk in limiting or reducing Scviet arms, arguing that the
 greater danger lay in continuing the arms race.
 OTHER LEADERS ON     KGB chief Andropov, speaking in Stupino,
 FOREIGN AFFAIRS      near Moscow, on 5 June presented one of the
 strongest cases for detente, arguing at length
 that it is the "logic of life" and that despite any "turns and
 zigzags," Western leaders will pursue detente because they realize
 it is "the only possible and necessary basis for relations between
 states with opposing systems."  He especially praised summit
 meetings and declared that Moscow is determined to make the talks
 with the President productive.
 Foreign Minister Gromyko, speaking in Minsk on 10 June, also
 praised summitry and the benefits of improved U.S.-Soviet
 relations, declaring that the imminent summit talks "must be no
 less important than the previous ones."  Shelepin, speaking in
 Leningrad on 3 June, cited Lenin on the value of peaceful
 coexistence in facilitating domestic development.  He welcomed
 the dampening of "hotbeds of dangerous confrontation and war,"
 the movement toward a Middle East settlement, "the historic

 Soviet-American agreements," espec!.ally on avoiding nuclear war,
 and the prospects for long-term international economic relations.
 Kirilenko, speaking in Sverdlovsk on 11 June, stressed the
 importance of the improvement cf 11.S.-Soviet relations and the
 efforts to end the arms race.  He lauied the productiveness of
 past summitry.
 Grishin and Pelshe and Shcherbitskiy also roundly praised the
 successes of Soviet detente diplomacy in briefer remarks on
 foreign affairs, while Shcherbitskiy praised in particular
 improved U.S.-Soviet relations.  Ponom:.rev stressed the "extremely
 important" results of detente, but he went on to criticize increased
 military spending in the West.  Shelepin and Gromyko did the same,
 adding that it is necessary to continue strengthening the Soviet
 armed forces even while pursuing detente.
 Suslov, speaking in Leningrad on 11 June, blended caution with his
 optimism about world affairs.  While praising the "outstanding
 successes" of Soviet policy and noting "a certain lessening of the
 military danger," he pointed to the "huge" military spending in
 the West and the creation of "new types of weapons of annihilation."
 Rejecting "bourgeois-apologetic" and "revisionist" arguments that
 capitalism is changing its nature, he recalled the "lessons of the
 past" that the Soviet Union should do everything to strengthen its
 defense ao as not to be caught unprepared.  The version of Suslov's
 speech published in LENINGRADSKAYA PRAVDA included the observation
 that detente is "based precisely" on the change in the world balance
 of power in favor of socialism.  Suslov was also reported to have
 declared that the successes of Soviet detente diplomacy "create
 opportunities for further peaceful offensive and open more favorable
 prospects for further pushing ahead by revolutionary forces . ...  ."
 The 8 June PRAVDA version of Mazurov's speech, delivered in Minsk
 the previous day, portrayed him as clearly downplaying East-West
 detente, ab  a stressed the overriding goal of "strengthening the
 world socialist system" and comSin{.ng a "constructive" approa,'h
 to foreign policy with "a firm rebuff to imperialist aggressiun and
 uncompromising  struggle against the class enemy."  However, the
 version of his speech carried in SOVIET BEL'JRUSSIA included some
 favorable comments on detente av well, including statements
 expressing confidence that the new leaders of France and West Germany
 would continue to seek good relations with Moscow.
 Defense Minister Grechko, not surprisingly, dwelt on the limitations of
 Soviet detente diplomacy.  Speaking in Moscow on 4 June, he urged the
 Politburo to base its foreign policies not ou the most probable course

 Grechko noted that strcngthening peace and s.rongthan ag defense
 ore "indivisible" goals.  He attributed the positive changes in
 the international siLuation to past strengthening of Soviet
 economic and military might and pointed out that the Weat was
 continuing to increase military preparation9,,*
 TROIKA ON DOMESTIC AFFAIRS     Within the Politburo troik6,
 Kosygi^ again emerged as the most
 forthright advocaL  of economic reforms tailored to the requirements
 of a modern industrial society and the tastes of the Soviet niidd]
 class.  Stressing the complewsntary nature of central and local
 der7lion-making and the availability of skilled personnel at alp,
 leve13 of society, the premier pointedly recalled the rocantt "ve.ey
 important" decision to grant enterprises in light industry auth.,,,?'ty
 to determine production quotas on  he basis of I'd:i.'r.act ties" witr
 trading agencies.  This decision, he oatd, was motivated by the reed
 for greater responsiveness by industry to consumer demand.  In
 addition to a7 "ending to work "now in progress" tova, 1 reforms in
 industrial manr,E?zent, Kosygin was 1.vish with praise for the
 achievements and potentials"ies of Soviet science and technology
 in promoting economic and social progress.
 The remarks of Brezhnev and Podgornyy on domestic affairs for the
 most part followed conventional lines, the most notable exception
 being Brezhnev's references to the role of science in promoting
 economic progress.   In particular, Brezhnev praised the great
 cont-cibution made by scientists, mentioned the anniversary of the
 USSR Academy of Sciences and praised its "outstanding" president,
 M.V. Keldysh.
 OTHER LEADERS ON     The speeches of Andropov, Kivilenko, Mazurov,
 DOMESTIC AFFAIRS     Griehir.,, Shelepin, Shcherbitskiy, Masherov,
 Ustinov and Solomentsev concentrated on a
 broad range of economic issues, while those of Polyanskiy and Kulakov
 focused almost exclusively on agriculture.  Andropov in particular
 appeared to argue for significant reforms, declaring "it would be
 incorrect to think :;hat the socialist system by itself ensures us

 all the necessary blessings."  He stressed the overriding
 importance of "questions of raising the effectiveness of public
 production and the introduction into praictice of the achievements
 of the scientific-technical revolution."
 Agricultural overseer Kulakov pol%ited to the need to inculcate
 Soviet administrators with a "feeling for what is new, [to] know
 the fine points of modern technology, economics and organization
 of production, and find the most effective ?,aths for deciding
 growing tanks."  He cited Lenin's injunction not to be satisfied
 with traditional methods of managing the economy but "without
 fail to go further and without fail to strive for more,-
 Devoting much of his speech to economic modernization, Belorussian
 First Secretary M.asherov pressed hard for a change frow "archaic
 methods" of admi.nistratio"to "a modern, scientifically-based,
 rational system" in both produc4ion any' social spheres, declaring
 that "without this, ar.~ other measured to speed scientific-technical
 progress, as the-_V say, will not pay off o  produce proper return."
 He stressed t.hrr: economic administration now depends increasingly on
 computers, mathematical methods and other scientific achievements,
 and 'te encouraged uinistries to experiment.   These remarks were not
 carried in PRAVDA'n abbreviate;: version of his speech.
 Dwelling on leadership of the economy, improvement of planning and
 incentives,, and use of scientific-technical achievements, First
 Deputy Pre`jier Mazurov declared that under present conditions.
 questions of labor productivity, return on ir-restment and quality
 of production are "the main yardsticks of economic activity,"
 rather than only questions of quantitative plan fulfillment.
 He praised the "skilled cadres of workers, specialists and economic
 leaders" and stated that the CPSU Central Committee demands "a truly
 party style of work, a scientific approach in all spheres of
 economic activity."  In comments reported in SOVIET BELORUSSIA but
 not in PRAVDA, he noted that industry is changing over to a two-three
 tier system of production associations and that new measures are
 presently being worked oui: to make economic levers more effective.
 CPSU Secretary Demichev, in his speech as reported in the Moscow
 LENINSKOYE ZNAMYA of 1 June, emphasized that "the strength of our
 economy ensures the strength of our defense" and that the United
 States--the most powerful country of the capitalist world--is forced
 to talk to us on equal terms."  Stressing the need to shift
 production emphasis from quantity to quality, he declared that "we
 rust bear in mind that our products are going onto world markets

 on a broader and broader front and are competing with goods
 which capitalist firms produce," and that "we can. and must
 produce goods not worse but better than in the most highly
 developed countries."  He praised the work of the Academy of
 Sciences, "the 250th anniversary of whic,, -..e are observing."
 He went on to declare that "science now has turned into a
 direct productive force in society" and that "its achievements
 facilitate  speeding the growth of labor productivity, savings
 in working time, and raising the quality and reliability of
 products."  Only the referenci to the ace.d,a,my's anniversary was
 included in PRAVDA's version of Domiahev's speech.
 Ustinov, like Demichev, also praised the Academy of Sciences,
 while Shelepin and Pelshe limited their praise to the general
 achievements of Soviet science.
 Suslov's comments on the economy were notable primarily for the
 admission that meat shortages are continuing despite the efforts
 to overcome them.  He stated that "we still have difficulties
 in supplying the population with some provisions, in particular,
 with meat and meat products" an.. that "although the production
 of meat in 1973 increased by 1.7 million tons over 1969, some
 oblasts are still short of :ueit."  This passage appeared only
 in the LENINGRADSKAYA PRAVDA version of his speech.
 TREATMENT OF EREZHNEV     While almost all speakers lauded
 Brezhnev, some--Kirilenko, Mazurov,
 Pelshe, Grishin, Shelepin, Solomentsev and Rash idov--ww~?te lavish
 or even servile in their praise.  Andropov, Mazurov, Kunayev,
 S':alov, Podgornyy, :tomariov, Rashidov and Ponomarev refer ced to
 the Politburo "headed hy" Brezh,.Lev--the first such usage by
 Andropov, Mazurov, and Suslov.  This deference by the latter
 three Politburo members appears to reflect different motivations
 from those or Brezhnev's cronies Kirilenko and Kunayev and the
 habitually servile Rashidov.  Presumably, the more indeperent-
 minded Politburo members were determined to project an image of
 solidarity on the eve of the Moscow summit.
 Most praise centered on Brezhnev's role in foreign rather than
 domestic affairs, with some--especially Kirilenko---appearing to
 credit foreign policy successes to Brezhnev, while others--notably
 Andropov---appearing to champion their own viewpoints on foreign
 policy and to associate Prezhnev with those views.  Kirilenko
 praised Brezhnev's "political wisdom, organizational talent and
 selfless work" and his "outstanding personal contribution" to

 foreign policy, and he attributed the improvement in U.S.-Soviet
 relations largely to the two U.S.-Soviet summit meetings.
 Gxishin, who called Brezhnev head of the Central Committee, also
 stressed the "important role" in detente played by Brezhnev's
 visits to the United States, France, West Germany and India,
 "the nc+gotiations conducted by him and:the treaties and agreements

 Brezhnev's "huge personal contribution" to formulating and

 important international actions" to the "huge personal contribution"
 of Brezhnev.  Mazurov also praised Brezhnev's "big personal
 contribution" to developing the economy, culture and. peace.
 Solomentsev called Brezhnev an "outstanding" leader and praised
 his "huge personal contribution" to socio-economic development,
 peace and agriculture."
 Though not lavish in praise of Brezhnev, Kosygin managed to concede
 Brezhnev a "great creative contribution" to: foreign policy.
 Gromyko also noted Brezhnev's "hug." contribution, and Andropov his
 "tireless" work for peace a.id his "selflessness, wisdom and courage"
 in foreign affairs.  Outside of calling Brezhnev head of  he
 Politburo, Suslov, Podgornyy and Ponomarev had few compliments
 for Brezhnev.  Least solicitous toward Brezhnev was G'rechko, whose
 speech reflected concern about possible military cutbacks.

 EUROPE
 SOVIET LEADERS CALL FOR PROGRESS A'r CSCE, MBFR TALKS
 in their references to the CSCE and MBFR in their pre-election
 speeches, Soviet leaders have, combined criticisms of the West
 with renewed professions of confidence that the deadlocks
 presently.affecting both conferences could be broken.  Kosygin,
 for example, in, referring to the CSCE, called on the West to
 undertake a "high-level" assessment of the progress to date,
 seemingly suggesting that an appropriate response would find a
 r;;orresponding resonance., in Moscow and open the way to a successful
 conclusion of the second stage.  Brezhnev, in referring to MBFR,
 avoided the usual criticism of the West for allegedly seeking
 one-sided-advantages  and professed the Soviet Union's willing-
 ness to enter into "partial measures."                         In the meantime, Soviet
 cotmnent has be3un to link the prospects for progress with the
 upcoming Presidential visit to Moscow, suggesting that the time
 is appropriate for a final push to reach agreement.
 CSCE     In his election speech on the 12th, Kosygin said that
 "a great deal" had been accomplished but that "along
 with the positive results some dark sides have emerged."
 Observing that the conference "cannot adopt decisions which
 would contradict the legitimate interests of its participsnti,
 or would signif.;, interference in their internal affairs," he
 went on to invs'.e.the.West to undertake a serious assessment, of
 the current situation.  He saidA
 We hold that the time has come when every state
 participating in the conference should assess at
 a high political level the results of the work
 done so far at the conference and adopt
 responsible decisions that would open the road
 for completion. of the European   '.Terence . . . .
 The weekly Moscow radio international observers' roundtable
 on the 16th echoed, this proposal, saying that "the time has
 come" for conference participants "to examine at a responsible
 level exactly. where the-'diplomats. in Geneva have now moved and
 to adopt decisions that will pave the way toward concluding
 efforts."

 Brezhnev, in his speech on the 14'.h, also struck a conciliatory
 tone, refraining from any charge that the West was attempting
 to interfere in Soviet domestic affairs.  But he did assert that
 dailegatiuns of "some states" were introducing proposals "which
 they know are unacceptable and have no relation at all to the
 matter at stake."  He then asked rhetorically whether those who
 wet, "pursuing tactics of delay and procrastination" could
 propose an ",Alternative" to a successful conclusion of the
 conference.  While thus hinting at the possibility that agreement
 might be blocked, he expressed confidence that "satisfactory"
 decisions, "useful to all," could ba fo;ind, providing that all
 "retain a sense of reality" and allow themselves to be guided by
 "concern for the peaceful future of Europe,"  He repeated his
 call that the concluding stage of the conference should be
 attended by "politicians of the very top level," but remained
 silent on the timing of the proposed summit.
 The least conciliatory in tone of the leaders' speeches was that
 of Foreign Minister Gromyko in Minsk on the 10th.  After noting
 that "a great deal of work useful to all" had been accomplished,
 Gromyko asserted that "there are contin'aing attempts to place
 various o'&stacles" in the path of the conference. He went on to
 declare that "we resolutely ccr?emn sucr attempts."  It may be
 significant that this passage was omitted in the TASS, central
 pr^ss, and Moscow radio summari..s of the speech; the local Minsk
 radio carried the si:ech live.  Podgornyy on the 13th, although
 not explicitly mentioning CSCE, was also critical of the West.
 "In exchai+_ee for detente," he said, "some Western politicians
 are vainly counting on squeezing out for themselves unilateral
 military advantages, or trying to win from the Soviet Union and
 the other socialist countries changes in their domestic order
 according to the recipes of bourgeois democracy."
 MBFR     Although little of substance regarding the force
 reduction talks was mentioned in the election speeches,
 two significant statements were made by Ponomarev and Brezhnev.
 Ponomarev, speaking on the 10th, in his brief passage on CSCE
 and MBFR made the most direct public linkage of the conference to
 the force reduction :talks yet made by an elite-level spokesman.
 He stated that "positive results of the all-European conference
 would also give impetus to the Vienna talks on reducing armed
 forces and armaments in central Europe."  The linkage of progress
 at Vienna to a successful conclusion at Geneva has been all but
 ignored in routine Soviet comtent, appearing only from time to time
 bur never in the blunt lan6uage that Ponomarev used.

 Brezhnev's passage on MBFR included a hint that the Soviet
 Union would possibly agree to limited$ partial measures as
 a first step in the force reduction negotiations.  After
 observing that it is difficult to achieve the "grer,t goal"
 of total disarmament, he went on to say:
 We are willing to enter into partial measures
 to limit and reduce arms.  This determines
 particularly our position at the talks on
 reducing armed forces and arms in central
 Europe.  We consider that there is a
 possibility in the near future to achieve here
 the first concrete results--given, of course,
 good will on the part of all parties to the
 negotiations.
 Brezhnev omitted any time element in his speculation on the
 possibility of an early agreement.  The standard Moscow line
 since Brezhnev first introduced the general outline of the
 Soviet position at MBFR in his speech at the World Peace
 Congress in October 1973'has been that stepe could be taken
 as early as 1975, and the Soviet formal proposal in Vienna
 in November proposed the first initial cut for 1975.  It is
 also notable that Brezhnev avoided any criticism of the West
 for allegedly trying to achieve a en^-sided advantage at they
 expense of the Warsaw Pact.  This omission reinforces the
 impression that his remarks may herald a Soviet agreement to
 accept an initial-partial reduction measure limited to U.S.
 and Soviet ground troops only.  This would be in line with
 the idea of a symbolic cut aimed at getting the talks off
 read center, which East Eurot-ean spokesmen have recently
 strezsed.

 COMMUNIST.nELATIONS
 MOSCOW PUBLICIZES STRONG CRITICISM OF JCP POLICIES
 An articl; in the May 1974 issue of the CPSU Central Committee
 monthly journal PARTY LIFE, written by Argentine CP leader A. Fava,
 contains the first authoritative Moscow comment on the November 1973
 Japanese Communist Party Congress.  The piece, an abridgement of an
 article published in the Argentine CP theoretical journal, expresses
 "profound disagreement" with JCP positions.  In November 1973
 PRAVDA had carried brief summaries of the congress proceedings,
 but had withheld coimient other than noting that the JCP had arbitrarily
 interpreted Soviet foreign policy and made an "unfounded" demand for
 the-,return--of several islands.held by the Soviet Union since World War II.
 Fava concentrated his fire on three major areas of disagreement:
 Soviet  detente with the United States, attitudes toward the inter-
 national communist movement, and the JCP's?call for the return of
 the northern islands.  Demonstrating continued Soviet sensitivity
 to the charge that it is snuggling up to American imperialism at
 the expense of smaller socialist states, the article took pains to
 refute JCP charges that normalization of Soviet-U.S. relations
 aided U.S. efforts in Vietnam.  The article also criticized the
 JCP policy of equating Soviet:and Chinese efforts to normalize
 relations with the United States and for que^tioning steps toward
 peaceful coexistence.*
 The article also charged that the JCP, which opposes the convening
 of a new world party conference, had attempted to "counterpose"
 fraternal parties.  JCP calls for restoration of communist unity at
 its-.congress were.dismissed by Fava as in fact "an appeal for the
 creation of a special grouping" and an attempt by the JCP to
 "legalize the formation of isolated groupings of individual parties."
 In this conjunction, the article recalled that the JCP had selectively
 invited., delegations to its congress.,. -excluding, among others, the
 Soviets and Mongolians.
 *  The article is similar to a February editorial in PARTY LIFE
 which ostensibly attacked the views of a Spanish CP official, but
 h ch also. represented. a comprehensive statement of"Soviet views on
 detente:andthe international communist movements.  'See the TRENDS
 of 20 March 1974, pages 9-10.

 The Psva article saved its most biting criticism for the JCP
 stand on the northern territories issue.  It called the JCP
 demand that the Soviet Union return the islands "unprecedented"
 in the history of the international communist movement.  Further,
 it charged the JCP leadership with assisting J4pan-s "revenchist"
 forces and, worse still, with doing "great harm" to Japan's
 "workers- and?: dt ddt-dt1 c..-movement . "

 INDOCHINA
 PRG MEMORANDUM DENOUNCES 'CONTINUED' U.S. VIETNAM INVOLVEMENT
 The PRG Foreign Ministry has issued a 15 June memorandum on the
 occasion of the first anniversary of the signing of the 13 June
 1973 Joint communique following the Kise:inger-Le Duc Tho Paris
 talks, "denouncing the continued U.S. military involvement and
 interference in the internal affairs of South Vietnam."  Although
 reported to have bean sent tc the Soviet Union, China, Poland,
 Hungary, Britain, France, Indonesia, and Iran as participants in
 the Paris international conference on Vietnam or as members of the
 International Commission for Control and Supervision, as well as
 to the UN Secretary General, it was not said to have been
 addressed to the United States or the GVN.  Similar PRG documents
 sent to the Paris conferees in April and August 19%3 had included
 the United States and Saigon as recipients, but more recent ones
 have not.*
 Initial DRV endorsement of the memorandum came in a Hanoi radio
 commentary of -the 19th pegged primarily to dissatisfaction with
 U.S. and Saigon actions, as revealed at the recently resumed
 Joint Military Commission (JMC) talks.  This same commentary also
 offered Hanoi's first reaction to an 18 June statement issued by
 the U.S. embassy in Saigon, charging that it contained "shopworn
 slanderous allegations"  that "distort the truth and distort the
 cause of the current tense situation in South Vietnam."
 Transmitted by VNA on 18 June, the lengthy PRG memorandum reiterated
 long-standing communist charges that "more than 25,000 U.S. military
 personnel in civilian guise" are directing and commanding Saigon's
 military operations and thit "many high-ranking U.S. military and
 intelligence personalities" have come to South Vietnam to "devise
 plans, supervise, and urge" Nguyen Van Thieu to step up the war.
 In its condemnation of the United States for "illegal introduction"
 of war materiel into South Vietnam, the memorandum repeated the
 now routine allegation that F-5E aircraft recently provided to the
 GVN have been "manned by U.S. pilots to take part in the operations
 of the Saigon army."

 The memorandum charged that "authoritative circles" in the U.S.
 Govertment have made "extremely cynical and deceptive allegations"
 in an attempt to justify U.S. "involvement and interference" in
 South Vietnam.  To back up these accusations, the memorandum
 quoted Secretary Schlesinger as claiming on 21 May that the United
 States was "naturally committed" to assist South Vietnam and cited
 recent Kissinger revarks that i:he United States was "morally and
 politically, if not juridically committed" and that the U.S..
 obligation to South Vietnam stems from its having been "long and
 deeply involved" there.  Construing these remarks is a U.S. attempt
 to legalize its South Vietnam "military involvement," the memorandum
 argued that the United States was now using the Paris agreement as
 a ,tnew political and juridical basis to prolong its commitments"
 to Saigon, and it recited in some detail the U.S. obligation and
 responsibility under the Paris agreement to "respect the independence
 and sovereignty and territorial integrity" of Vietnam.  Declaring that
 the signing of the Paris agreement was the "only new commitment
 the United States has made with regard to South Vietnam, the
 memorandum asserted that the Paris agreement constituted a "natural
 negation of any commitments the United States has made so far to
 the various groups of its henchmen in South Vietnam."
 Uncharacteristically, the memorandum devoted relatively scant attention
 to condemning the Saigon administration.  Its two major complaints
 against the GVN stemmed from it having "arrogantly rejected" the PRG's
 22 March six-point proposal for achieving "peace and national concord"
 in the South and its actions that allegedly brought about the recent
 deadlock in negotiations at La Celle-Saint-Cloud and at the JMC talks.

 HANOI PRESSES DRIVE TO IMPROVE LABOR PRODUCTIVITY, MANAGEMENT
 In the wake of the Third Congress of the Vietnam Federation of Trade
 Unions (VFIU) this February, Hanoi has launched an emulation drive
 enlisting the trade union organization in overcoming long-standing
 problems of low productivity and poor economic management.  The
 emulation movement--promoting "productive labor to build socialism
 with industry and thrift"--bears some resemblance to past movements
 but gives a greater role to the trade unions than did the last previous
 such campaign, which was launched in early 1970 and continued through
 the beginning of 1974.
 Hanoi's continuing preoccupation with improving labor productivity
 reflects North Vietnam's very real and severe problems in labor
 management, problems graphically outlined, for example, in an article
 in the April issue of the party theoretical journal HOC TAP by Vice
 Chairman of the State Planning Commission* Che Viet Tan:
 The labor productivity of our economic sectors generally
 remains low, in some cases even tens of times lower than
 that in developed industrial countries.  Due to the after-
 maths of war and shortcomings in economic management,
 the labor productivity of a number of sectors recently
 dropped further, in some cases down to only 50-70 percent
 of prewar levels.
 Vietnam Workers Party (VWP) First Secretary Le Duan and other speakers
 at the February trade union congress addressed themselves to these
 problems and anticipated the launching of the emulation movement.  Le
 Dunn asserted that the "number one task of the trade unions today is
 to launch an enthusiastic revolutionary movement of workers and civil
 servants emulating one another in productive labor, boosting labor
 productivity and practicing thrift, and successfully implementing the
 resolution adopted by the 22d Plenum of the 'JWP Central Committee.!'**
 *'  'Che Viet Tan has long been a member of the State Planning
 Commission, but the first known reference to him as a vice chairman was
 in the 10 April 1974 NHAN DAN.  A report in an August 1970 journal,
 CONG TAC KE HOACH (THE PLANNING TASK), stated that Tan was in charge
 of salaried labor planning.

 Hanoi first publicized the new labor emulation campaign on 27 March,
 when North Vietnamese media revealed that the DRV Council, of Ministers
 and the Trade Union Federation Presidium had "recently" issued a
 joint resolution to launch an emulation movement for productive labor
 to build socialism with industry and thrift.  Later propaganda
 identified the Join resolution as "Resolution No. 46" but did not
 publicize its text or report the data it was adop*ed.  A speech by
 VFTU leader'Hoang Quc:: Viet, published in the trade union paper
 LAO DONG on 3 April, revealed that the VFTU Central Committee had
 met from 26 through 28 March to study the joint Yesolution and
 initiated a resolution guiding trade union eci,;ilons in the emulation
 movement.
 The VFTU Central Committee resolution, published in the 17 April
 issue of LAO DONG and summarized by Hanoi radio 10 days later,
 offered detailed guidance on conducting the movement.  In particular,
 it listed six measures to develop and organize the movement:  Education
 of workers and civil servants in the new tasks; organization of
 conferences at lower levels to discuss state plan fulfillment, to
 participate in enterprise management, and to prepare to sign collective
 contracts; mot{vation of workers and cadres to make emulation pledges
 ar.d to overf'ilfill plan goals; consolidation and expansion of "socialist
 teams and units" as the nuclei. for the movement; implementation of
 the state's award system and policies; and solution of livelihood
 problems among workers and civil'.eervants in coordination with state
 agencies.
 VFTU-STATE RELATIONS     The labor emulation movement initiated
 in 1970 was launched by a resolution of the
 Oa,  ci1-of Ministers,* not bye joint resolution with the VFTU as
 was the case this year.  Some recent Hanoi propaganda has called
 attention to the need to increase the trade unions' stature and
 responsibility, aid the issuance of the "Joint" resolution seems to
 be a deliberate step serving this objective.
 Hoang Quoc Viet touched upon this point in his speech carried in the
 3.,April LAO DONG.  He noted that the VWP third congress iu 1960
 had advocated "elevating the position of the trade union" and allowing
 it to become a school of state and economic management and of
 *  The 1970 Council of Ministers.resoluticz, No. 20-CP, was dated
 20 January 1970 and publicized in February of that year.  The 1970
 emulation movement is discussed in FBIS Special Report No. 301,
 7 August 1970, "North Vietnamese Problems and Policies as Outlined in
 La Duan's Februarq'1970 Article," page 27.

 communism.  He suggested that the injunctions of the congress had
 not always been implemented, but that the current joint resolution
 was aimed at doing so.  Again, in a report to a VFTU conference
 broadcast by Hanoi on 17 May, Hoang Quoc Viet cited Le _Duan as
 stressing the importance of huildinl, a network of correct relations
 among the party, state, and masses and added that:  ". ... we should
 begin by developing correct relations between the Council of
 Ministers and the trade union federation."
 Le Duan had noted in his trade union congress speech that a "recent"
 Statute on the Organization and Activities of the Council of Ministers*
 had "listed the major principles on the relationship between;s,theratate
 and trade unions."  He added that:
 . . we must have as soon as possible documents of legal
 value defining the responsibilities and rights of trade
 unions in connection with their participation in economic
 and state management.  Trade unions have the right to take
 part in the drafting of such documents and all other state
 regulations having to do with labor productivity, work
 conditions, and living conditions of workers and civil
 servants.
 COLLECTIVE CONTRACTS     Propaganda or. the current emulation movement
 has suggested that the primary initial step
 is the signing of collective contracts between the directors and trade
 union committees in industrial, construction, or business units.
 According to the VFTU Central Committee resolution, these contracts
 should "clearly state the primary norms and methods to be achieved, and
 clearly stipulate the responsibility of the management agency, workers
 and employees, and trade union in achieving the production plan,
 protecting socialist property, implementing labor policies and systems,
 and improving labor and daily living conditions for workers and
 employees."
 *  These statutes on the reorganization?of the Council of Ministers
 have not been publicized in available Hanoi media but have been
 referred to on other occasions in the propaganda and seem likely to
 have provided the framework for changes in the Council of Ministers'
 leadership in recent months.  The head of the DRV State Legislation
 Ct~mmie"lion, Tran Cong Tuong, in a series of articles in NHAN DAN from
 1 through 12 April, revealed, that the statute had been promulgated
 by the Council of Ministers on 1 November 1973.

 Hawci media have carried' several reports on progress in signing the
 collective contracts,, and on 15 June the radio revealed that this
 question was discussed in detail at an 11-13 June conference-called
 by the VFTU to review implementation of Joint resolution 46.  In
 addition to the leadership of the trade union, the.-radio reported
 that the VFTU conference was attended by Vice Premier Phan Truong
 The, who has special responsiblity for industry and communications,
 and by "several ministers and vice ministers and representatives of
 various branches at the central level."
 The report on the conference indicated that efforts to sign collective
 contracts since the adoption of the joint resolution had improved in
 comparison with earlier periods, but that there were also "shortcomings
 and wealt.points ." It revealed the severity of these shortcomings with
 the acknowledgement that about 30 percent of the contracts that were
 concluded "contained unrealistic commitments because measures to
 implement them wern lacking and the responsibilities of the trade
 unions were not clearly defined."
 Collective contracts have previously played a part in North. Vietnam's
 industrial managemetit,* but they were not a major ingredient in the
 last previous labor emulation movement and haVe-,not?'always.been
 successful. Past problems with collective contracts were pointed out
 in a 29 May Hanoi radio interview with Minister of Trade Hoang Quoc
 Thinh.  The minister praised the results in implementing resolution
 46 and noted-that prior to the guidance offered by the new resolution,
 contracts were signed in some localities but "suffered from: many
 shortcomings."  Judging by his remarks, the former problems were much
 like the current ones.  He noted that there had been no coordination
 between the signing of the contracts and the training of the employees
 and that, as a result, the contracts were "undemocratic, unrealistic,
 and ineffective" and some were too broad or impractical to implement.
 *  The trade union's role in signing such contracts was discussed
 for example, in the North: Vietnamese "trade union law"-adopted- at the
 seventh session of the DRV National Assembly, Second Legislature, on
 14 September 1957.

 CAMBODIAN DEVELOPMENTS DRAW MODERATE FRONT, PEKING COMMENT
 While Cambodian Front propaganda routinely claims that recent
 student demonstrations in Phnom Penh and the Long Boret cabinet
 crisis are evidence of heightened contradictions within the
 Cambodian Government, at the same time Front media have avoided
 the references to an imminent insurgent military victory that
 marked propaganda at the start of the dry season last fall.
 Recent Front comment lauding the insurgents' advances
 during the past dry season has reflected the currently more
 cautious military outlook and stressed insurgent confidence
 That their objectives would be achieved through a protracted
 military struggle.
 Typically, a 13 June AKI review played up the insurgents' ability
 to strike unexpectedly, hit enemy weak points, and gradually wear
 down the opposition--a shift from last fall's calls for massed
 attacks against Phnom Penh and other government strongholds.  Less
 attention is also being paid to U.S. aid to Cambodia and alleged
 efforts to bring about a "sham peace"--issues which drew shrill
 complaints from the Front earlier this year.
 Peking has endeavored to show solidarity with the Front, publishing
 an 8 June PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article supporting the Phnom
 Penh students and at the same time handling the United States with
 discretion.  A 15 June PEOPLE'S DAILY article signed by Yin Chih-sheng
 treated the issue of the U.S..role in Cambodia more in sorrow than
 in anger.  Highlig%ting the "tragedy" of American interference in
 Phnom Penh, it noted U.S. press reports that the Phnom Penh regime
 was beset wii.h increasing problems despite extraordinary efforts to
 support Lon Nol by the recently appointed U.S. ambassador--whom
 PEOPLE'S DAILY did not name.  Though acknowledging past and present
 U.S. assistance to Lon Nol, the article asserted confidently that
 the situation in Phnom Penh has nonetheless gone from "bad to worse."
 Drawing a lesson for-theUnited States, it advised that.-the U.S.
 experience over the past four years has shown that "it is the
 Cambodian people fighting heroically, arms in hand, who determine
 the destiny of Cambodia, not the traitorous Lon Nol and his ilk,
 or the superpower on the other side of the Pacific."  Suggesting
 that it is in the interest of the United States to accept this
 view and end it:s involvement in Cambodia,..the paper added that
 "although the master of the Lon Nol clique.admits and laments the.
 helplessness of the United States before the situation in Cambodia,
 it is blind to a truth that is obvious to all, and here lies its
 tragedy."

 CHIN-A
 COLLEGE ENROLLMENT BEGINS. NO NEW POLICY CHANGES INDICATED
 Fukien and Kwangtung provinces have announced their annual college
 enrollment drives with pronouncements reflecting last year's
 campaign, to retain cultural revolution educational reforms.  That
 campaign had criticized those who sought to emphasize only academic
 criteria for admission.  The formal procedures for admission this
 year remain "voluntary application, recommendation b;' the masses,
 approval by the leadership and reexamination by the colleges
 concerned"--the same as before last, year's reforms--but both
 provinces' enrollment announcements stress that political criteria
 receive primary emphasis in judging applicants.
 Foochow radio.non 8 June broadcast the first, and more detailed,
 discussion of enrollment procedures and requirements, noting that
 students must both "observe revolutionary discipline" and have the
 spirit of "going against the tide."  Like last year, students must
 also have at least two years of practical work experience, and
 those with a poor class background but a good performance record
 are eligible for admission.  So that the "masses" can choose
 applicants correctly, all educational policy directives are to be
 made available to them, outlining "procedures, qualifications and
 student quotas."  Quotas are apparently complicated, with categories
 including women, youths with poor class backgrounds, youths sent
 to the countryside, Overseas Chinese and minoritii.,s.  The broadcast
 stressed that while political qualities of applicants must be put
 "before everything else, their cultural level must be considered as
 an essential qualification."
 Canton radio on 18 June carried a NANFANG DAILY commentary announcing
 that full-scale fall college enrollment work had begun, with the goal
 of creating "massive ranks of wotker-intellectuals."  The commentary
 stressed the role of the masses and warned of the danger of revisionist
 sabotage of the correct educational line.  It also'harkened back to
 the campaign last winter against admission "through the, back door" in
 warning cadres against "selfish considerations" and making "indiscr'.m-
 inate use" of their powers.  An accompanying broadcast related the
 recent experience of a Kwangtung county party committee in admissions
 work.  The report noted that applicants "undergo examination in moral,
 intellectual and physical education," illustrating that the examination
 system has been modified but not eliminated.

 r10 T E S
 PRC NUCLEAR TEST:  Peking's 18 June announcement of its nuclear
 test on the 17th reflected no change from the Chinese nuclear
 disarmament staace set forth in Peking's last test announcement
 of 28 June 1973.  Again using the concise format adopted in
 November 1971, the latest announcement repeated Peking's inten-
 tion to break the superpowers' nuclear monopoly, not to be the
 first to use nuclear weapons, and to work toward the complete
 prohibition of nuclear weapons.  It added a reference to the
 "excellent situation" brought about by the Chinese campaign to
 criticize Confucius and Lin Piao and specified that a "new nuclear
 test" had been conducted, in contrast to last June's announcement
 which cited a "hydrogen bomb test."  The USSR promptly reported
 the test on TASS and Moscow radio, drawing from 'Western accounts
 before the test was officially announced in Peking.  As usual,
 TASS has reported adverse reaction and official protests from
 Japan, Australia, and other Asian cr'untries.  A Moscow domestic
 radio report on the 18th made light of Peking's att'.mpt,s to
 Justify the tests by "defense needs,,"
 PRC-INDIA RELATIONS:  Demonstrating Peking's cautious receptivity
 to improved relations with India, Central Committee Vice Chairman
 Yeh Chien-ying on 13 June told a visiting Indian delegation that
 "the friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples had a long
 history," adding:  "We believe that the traditional friendship
 between the two peoples will surely be further consolidated."
 NCNA reported that the vice chairman-had a "cordial:.and "ftienddly
 conversation" with the delegation, composed of members of the D. S.
 Kontis Memorial Committee; Kontis was an Indian physician who worked
 in China during World War II.  Yeh Chien-ying had received a Kontis
 delegation which visited China a year ago, but at that time NCNA
 did not report the vice chairman's remarks during the reception,
 noting only that there was "a cordial conversation in a friendly
 atmospluire."  NCNA reported on 12 June the UN Security Council's
 resolution recommending that the General Assembly admit Bangladesh
 to the United Nations.  UN Representative Chuang Yen noted that
 "new developments" in South Asia had made Bangladesh eligible for
 UN membership and repeated the line,Vpiced by.V.ice Premier.
 Teng Hsiao-ping on 12 May, that "we are ready to develop.-
 good-neighborly relations with the countries on the subcontinent on
 the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence and to
 further enhance our traditional friendship with their peoples."

 MALYAN CP:  The clandestine Malayan CP radio station in China--the
 Voice of the Malayan Revolution---has recently taken pains to show
 that the 31 May establishment of PRC-Malaysian diplomatic relations
 has not affected Malayan CP policy toward the Razak government nor
 undermined the party's support for China.  Broadcasts have continued
 to feature battle actions of the communist-led insurgents and to
 attack harshly the policies of the "Razak clique."  An 8 June
 commentary rejected Razak's call for the surrender of the communist
 insurgents, made upon his return from China, and exhorted the
 Malayan "people" to persist in armed struggle.  In justifying
 Peking's welcome for Razak, the clandestine broadcasts have high-
 lighted the historical precedent of Chinese communist support for
 Stalin's efforts during World War II to reach nonaggression pacts
 with CCP enemies, including militarist Japan and Chiang Kai-shek.
 An 11 June article cited Mao's assurance at the time that Stalin's
 accommodation with the fascists was merely evidence of Moscow's
 "growing socialist strength" and would not affect CCP solidarity
 with the Soviet Union.
 PRC IDEOLOGICAL CAMPAIGN:  Amplifying earlier RED FLAG articles, an
 18 June PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial has called for the creation of a
 "huge contingent of Marx..-(t theoretical workers" who will dare to
 make "frontal at',acks" in fighting for the victory of Marxism.
 Suggesting that little telief is likely for leaders now be`_n3
 criticized, the editorial states that such contingents can be
 developed only in the "storms of mass struggle."  The editorial
 calls on party committees to put the building of theoretical
 forces on the.r "agenda of major items.   The editorial carefully
 indicates that, the theorists will not operate without controls,
 specifying that "even the worker-peasant-soldier tt=retical
 workers must pay attention to remolding themselves" and muss: not
 be civorced from production or succumb to "ivory tower" specializa-
 tion.  To help insure that theorist contingents sta"" under party
 control, the editorial ordered that the conr_ingeats be built step
 by step "from the leading organs down."
