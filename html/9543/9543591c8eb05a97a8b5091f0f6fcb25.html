 OCTOBER 11, 1962.
 Hon. WILLIAM C. CRAMER,
 House of Representatives,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. CONGRESSMAN: It Is obvious that
 Fidel Castro, Ernesto Guevara and their
 associates in the Cuban Government are so
 firmly imbued with Communist doctrine that
 nothing short of force can cause them to
 change their position.
 This being so, it is useless to hope for any
 improvement in relations with that govern-
 ment.  They will continue to employ every
 means within their power to further the
 cause of communism and to set back the
 cause of the free world.
 If the Castro government is to be dis-
 lodged, force must be employed.  The U.S.
 Government has committed itself to refrain
 from using force in this matter. Rulers of
 the member nations of the Organization of
 American States are not eager to accept the
 social reforms implicit in all-out opposition
 to communism since they feel their posi-
 tion Is stable so long as they have the sup-
 port of the military, hence their support of
 the  use  of  concerted  force  against  the
 Castro government will be nominal, at best.
 The Cuban exiles are the ones who have
 lost the most from actions of the Castro
 government and who stand to gain the most
 from the dislodgement of the Castro Com-
 munist regime.  Being intimately concerned,
 they will fight the hardest to restore Cuba
 to the free world.
 It is therefore respectfully suggested that
 a Cuban government-in-exile be recognized
 as the logical and most effective means for
 the elimination of the Castro Communist
 tyranny and the restoration of civil rights
 to the oppressed peoples of Cuba.
 Respectfully,
 ROBERT O. WILKINSON, B.S.
 JOHN F. KENNEDY,
 President of the United States,
 White House, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SIR: I thoroughly approve of Con-
 gressman CRAMER's opposition to the Cuban
 negotiations.  I have bitterly opposed them
 from the start.
 Since when do you negotiate with the
 enemy?
 Since when do Christians negotiate with
 the Devil?
 Is Florida to. be a second Pearl Harbor?
 It was your kind who created the first,
 idiotic parties to raise money for the Ken-
 nedy gang; this Is more important than
 protecting decent American citizens, isn't it?
 How much do you care for our beloved
 men rotting in Red Chinese prisons?  In
 North Korea too and even Russia's slave
 labor camps?
 Donovan's wheeling and dealing is a vi-
 cious violation of the Logan Act, but perhaps
 you  are  like Fulbright, Schlesinger et al
 and think "the people are too dumb to
 know," Powers and Able should have stayed
 where they were.  We are at war.
 Why do you lie and claim this is a private
 deal when we know it is our own tax money
 the CIA will hand over?
 PT-109 indeed:
 "Know therefore that Jehovah thy God,
 He is God, the faithful God, who keepth
 covenant and loving kindness with them
 that love Him and keep His Commandments
 to a thousand generations."
 Hon. WILLIAM CRAMER,
 U.S. House of Representatives,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR  SIR:  A  goodly number of us are
 grateful to you for your strong position
 against our Government's  paying blood-
 money to Communist Castro for his unfor-
 tunate captives.
 I entreat you to continue in your effort
 to prevent such weak and cowardly action
 with every resource at your command, as-
 sured that the American people are prepared
 to provide you with moral, intellectual and
 emotional support.
 The lives of those freedom fighters are
 too precious to be paid for in gold, and the
 United States of America must not do busi-
 ness in any case with unprincipled barbar-
 ians.
 Yours truly,
 MARY B. SNYDER.
 Mr. WILLIAM CRAMER,
 House of Representatives,
 Washington, D.C.
 Dear Mr. CRAMER: The writer wishes to
 congratulate you on the stand you have
 taken on sending a wire to our President
 to pick up the $60 million tab.  This is the
 taxpayers money and I, as one, do not see
 that our  Government should give  them
 (Commies) any food or drugs.     What about
 our own boys in Russia and China that are
 suffering behind the Commies' curtains.
 I think the American public should stand
 up and demand of our Government, who
 is paying this blackmail.  At this time there
 is a lot of talk about the release of these
 prisoners, but there is nothing said about
 the $60 million Castro demands for their
 release.
 From my understanding of our Govern-
 ment this issue should be brought before
 our Congress.
 Thanks for reading this.
 Sincerely,
 V. J. HENKE.

 TRI-CITY HARBOR, LAKE COUNTY,
 IND.
 (Mr. O'HARA of Illinois asked and was
 given permission to extend his remarks at
 this point in the RECORD and to include
 extraneous matter.)
 Mr. O'HARA of Illinois.  Mr. Speaker,
 during the last few weeks we have heard
 considerable remarks on the House floor
 regarding the Burns Ditch Harbor on the
 south shore of Lake Michigan in Indiana.
 We have also heard from the gentle-
 man from Indiana, Congressman RAY J.
 MADDEN, regarding the practical advan-
 tages of the construction of the Tri-City
 Port Harbor adjacent to Hammond, East
 Chicago, and Whiting, Ind., in Lake
 County.  The following letter from Mr.
 R. J. Smith, chairman, Rivers and Har-
 bors Committee of the Hammond Cham-
 ber of Commerce contributes some solid
 information regarding the advantages of
 a harbor location in an area where three
 steel mills are already operating and
 several hundred more small industries
 could take advantage of the new harbor
 construction.
 I am extending my remarks to include
 the following letters from the chairman
 of the Rivers and Harbors Committee of
 the Hammond Chamber of Commerce:
 OCTOBER 10, 1962.
 EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR,
 Gary Post Tribune,
 Gary, Ind.
 DEAR SIR: Your editorial of October 7 con-
 demns the tricity port as a smokescreen at-
 tempt to defeat Burns Harbor and as imprac-
 ticable.  This is not only harsh but grossly
 inaccurate.
 Professional opinion in behalf of the tri-
 city port site is impressive.. Prof. Harold
 Mayer, waterway and urban authority of the
 University of Chicago and author of an au-
 thoritative book on the St. Lawrence Seaway
 has endorsed this site as feasible.  Morris N.
 Quads, consulting engineer and waterway
 expert of New York of the firm of Parsons,
 Brinkerhoff, Quade, and Douglas, has sup-
 ported this Hammond, Whiting, East Chicago
 port in his professional capacity and as a
 member of a professional group that has
 made engineering studies of this site.
 The proposed tricity harbor would be
 formed by connecting existing breakwaters at
 Indiana Harbor and at the Illinois-Indiana
 line with 4 miles of new breakwater.  This
 would enclose a harbor area approximately
 6 miles long and 2 miles wide which would
 allow 4,800 acres behind the breakwater for
 industrial and harbor development by fill
 methods. Engineering study shows that the
 4,800 acres can be filled by low-cost methods
 that are economically compatible with its
 intended use.
 The most important advantage of the tri-
 city site is that it Is the only site on any of,
 the five Great Lakes that can act as a com-
 mon terminal for the ocean vessels of the St.
 Lawrence Seaway and barges of the Missis-
 sippi-gulf barge system.
 Congressman RAY  MADDEN,  of the Lake
 County congressional districts, the mayors of
 the four major cities of the county, the city
 councils of Hammond, Whiting, and East
 Chicago, the county commissioners of Lake
 County, Ind., major industries and labor
 unions in this county, including one of our
 largest steel mills and one of our largest
 unions, and the chambers of commerce of
 Hammond and East Chicago have all sup-
 ported the tricity port study.  This con-
 certed effort led by Congressman MADDEN has
 been successful.  Both House of the U.S.
 Congress have now passed an appropriation
 In the amount of $50,000 for the first year of
 a 3-year feasibility study by the Corps of
 Army Engineers of the tricity site.  A tri-
 city harbor and industrial development has
 enormous significance for Lake County to
 restore high employment.
 Many industries have left Lake County in
 recent years.  Between 1957 and 1962 manu-

 facturing  jobs  in  Hammond alone have
 suffered a 20-percent reduction.  Layoffs of
 Lake County steel workers reach 50 percent
 all too frequently.  The Lake County steel
 district area is classified as a depressed area
 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor.      Unemploy-
 ment in Gary, Hammond, and East Chicago,
 is 7.3 percent, the highest for any of the
 seven major manufacturing districts In the
 State.  By  comparison,  unemployment in
 the State is 4.8 percent; Indianapolis. 4.2
 percent; and South Bend. 4.4 percent.
 An      economically  depressed  area  in  a
 county of 514,000 people is not only a local
 problem but a national one.      Tricity port
 offers an unparalled Industrial opportunity
 for Lake County and the State of Indiana.
 What does the proposed Burns Harbor
 offer to the Nation and the State?  To the
 one  steel  mill now there  (and no  other
 steel mill has committed Itself to building)
 the proposed Burns Harbor would be an out-
 right subsidy and that steel mill would gain
 over 90 percent of the benefits.   New and
 automated steel mills produce the same
 amount of steel with a fraction of the man-
 power.  The manpower requirement per ton
 in an automated mill to estimated to be one-
 fourth than that of an older mill.                               A new
 automated steel  center  at Burns Harbor
 made possible through a Federal grant of
 $26 million and State revenue bond financ-
 ing of $38 million would further depress
 employment in the Lake County Industrial
 area, Hammond through Gary.
 The one steel company now located at
 Burns Ditch can build its own slips and
 docks as did the Gary mills.  By so doing,
 Its present commitment would be protected
 and it would not gain an unfair competitive
 advantage over other local steel mills.
 The proponents of the tricity port rest
 their case on the merits of that location
 subject to confirmation by the now assured
 feasibility survey by the Army Engineers.
 This culminates an effort that goes back
 almost  50 years.  A  smokescreen  doesn't
 have that kind of endurance, however di-
 verting it may be as a rhetorical symbol.

 WHITE  HOUSE          CONFERENCE        ON
 NARCOTIC AND DRUG ABUSE
 (Mr. LIBONATI asked and was given
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the Recoav and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr. LIBONATL  The White House
 Conference on Narcotic and Drug Abuse
 has completed its conference-an official
 transcript of the Conference is not avail-
 able at this time.                      Dr. Lois L. Higgins,
 because of her specialized practical
 knowledge at all levels of this ugly sub-
 ject received an invitation from the
 President, John Kennedy, to attend and
 participate  in  the  discussions.  The
 President realizes that there is no greater
 human problem confronting our Nation.
 Medical authority, sociologists, police ex-
 perts, penologists, psychiatrists, and wel-
 fare authorities have studied this subject
 in all of its phases. Judges of the courts
 and enforcement officers and prosecutors
 have discussed and debated the various
 theories on what are the best procedures
 to deal with the addicts, pusher-users,
 and pushers of dope.  Hospitalization
 facilities and related curative methods
 have been tested and experimented over
 the years.
 We hope that the Conference through
 its open discussion of the various phases
 of this problem will make further con-
 tributions to control of narcotics both In
 the habit and suppression of the traffic.
 Ultimately a cure will be found-mean-
 time the treatment of the victim as a
 diseased person or incarceration as a
 felon or law violator must be determined
 by Federal statutes. We are anxious to
 review the discussions and findings of
 the Conference in order as legislators to
 aid us in our determinations.  We are
 proud of those in attendance at the Con-
 ference and applaud and praise their
 efforts in their dedication to solve this
 problem for the health and happiness of
 these unfortunates and the alleviation
 of the anxieties of their families.  We
 are indebted to Dr. Lois Higgins' report
 and congratulate her in her great career
 herein:
 REPORT  ON  Tim WHrTx Hones  CONFERENCE
 ON Nascoric AND Dams AxusE
 (By Lois L. Higgins)
 On May 29. 1962. the Honorable John F.
 Kennedy issued  a statement announcing
 that a White House Conference on Narcotics
 would be held in late summer.  He said:
 "The problems arising out of the use of
 narcotics and other habit-forming drugs
 are many and varied Including those of law
 enforcement, the treatment to be accorded
 addicts, posttreatment procedures and per-
 haps most importantly an accurate and
 up-to-date  assessment  of  the  particular
 nature and magnitude of addiction In the
 United States.  It Is our intention to bring
 to the Conference national authorities and
 leaders. Including  those In Federal, State,
 and local governments, to better understand
 the facets of addiction and to formulate a
 course of action designed to cope more
 effectively with this national problem area.
 "The Attorney General will serve as Gen-
 eral Chairman of the Conference.  I have
 discussed this proposal with Governor Brown,
 of California. and Mayor Wagner. of New York
 City, who represent two jurisdictions where
 drug addiction Is especially prevalent and
 they agree that such a conference could be
 most helpful.  Many other government offi-
 cials Including Members of the Congress
 from those two areas have also urged that
 a conference be held."
 Invitations were received In mid-Septem-
 ber and upon responding, delegates received
 preconference materials of general Interest,
 along with delegate badges for admission
 to the State Department Auditorium where
 the 400 invitees were to meet.  Registration
 began at 8:30 a.m. on the morning of
 September 27. 1982.
 Television and radio communications had
 been set up in the auditorium and they con-
 tinued throughout the 2-day meeting.
 The press was well represented and It ap-
 peared that the talks were being translated
 Into different languages-but this is merely a
 conjecture based on the operations in view.
 It is not confirmed.
 The President of the United States was
 introduced by the Honorable Robert Ken-
 nedy, Chairman.  He advised the 400 dele-
 gates that this Conference could be only
 windowdresstng. or.  It could produce con-
 crete programs for action at Federal. State,
 and local levels. He said that there is "no
 area where there is so much of mystery,
 misunderstanding and difference of opinion"
 as In the field of narcotic addiction.  He
 stressed the need for elimination of illicit
 drug traffic and the need for greater em-
 phasis on treatment of addicts.  While the
 traffic in Illegal drugs seems to have been
 lessened in recent years. he noted that there
 Is growing abuse, especially among young
 people in the use of so-called nonnarcotic
 barbiturates and pep pills.  He remarked
 with feeling "Society's gain will be illusory
 if we have reduced the incidence of one kind
 of drug addiction only to have new kinds of
 drugs substituted."
 President Kennedy expressed hope that
 Congress would pass  a bill he requested
 strengthening Federal  powers  to  control
 manufacture  and distribution of barbitu-
 rates and stimulant drugs.
 He mentioned that he had just presented
 a special citation to Harry Anslinger, retired
 Commissioner of Narcotics  (Treasury De-
 partment) for outstanding service In reduc-
 ing Illegal drug traffic.  He noted that the
 American people are most indebted to him
 (Analinger) for his 45 years of Federal serv-
 ice.
 The President mentioned the discourag-
 ingly large number of relapses among addicts
 who leave our medical institutions (Lexing-
 ton and Fort Worth) free of any physical
 dependence on drugs-and noted that this
 makes It clear that more must be done.
 The loudspeaker was not working properly
 and it was difficult to hear the next few
 speakers.   However,  it can be noted that
 Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon,
 under whom the Narcotics Bureau (Federal)
 operates said that Treasury is concerned with
 the human and social aspects of addiction
 as well as stopping illegal traffic.
 The new Secretary of HEW the Honorable
 Anthony J. Celebrezze told the delegates that
 "a program of civil commitment for addicts,
 coupled with a rehabilitative parole system
 would be an Important forward step."
 This statement reminded me that Attorney
 General Kennedy In opening the Conference
 stated "for all that is said, argued or believed
 about narcotics and drugs, the depressing
 truth iq that we don't know very much
 about them.  He referred to the working
 booklet  'Ad Hoc  Panel'  which  delegates
 received prior to the Conference-noted that
 there Is a very sharp drop in drug addic--
 Ilon after the age of 35 or 40, but that we
 can only guess at the reason."   He went
 on "We can see that our job, therefore, is
 clear-it Is to start finding out-to start
 building a reasonable and reliable body of
 information."
 Governor Brown, of California, spoke of
 that State's fight against the problem and

 $62 million in foodstuffs and medicine
 to Castro, - public indignation over these
 negotiations by a private citizen, appar-
 ently committing the United States, and
 certainly under authority of the U.S.
 Government, has resulted in expressions
 from. all over the country of indignation.
 This appeasement is to be compared to
 strong language over Cuba used in the
 1960 campaign, which I set out here-
 after:
 J.F.K.'s BIG 1960 PROMISES ABOUT CUBA
 In the light of developments of the past
 20 months, there is a hollow sound to J.F.K.'s
 glowing promises about Cuba, made when
 he was seeking the Presidency in 1960.  Why
 not write a "letter to the editor" using these
 quotations?  Here are a few of them:
 "I want people to wake up all over the
 world in the next years and wonder not what
 Mr. Khrushchev is doing or what Mr. Castro
 is doing.  I want them to wonder what the
 United States is doing."-Candidate J.F.K.,
 Queens, N.Y, October 27, 1960.
 "Mr. Nixon hasn't mentioned Cuba very
 prominently in this campaign.  He talks
 about standing firm in Berlin, standing firm
 in the Far East, standing up to Khrushchev,
 but he never mentions standing firm in
 Cuba-and if you can't stand up to Castro,
 how can you be expected to stand up to
 Khrushchev?"-Candidate  J.F.K.,  Johns-
 town, Pa., October 15, 1960.
 "We must let Mr. Castro know that we do
 not intend to be pushed around any longer
 and in particular do not intend to be pushed
 out of our naval base at Guantanamo or
 denied fair compensation for American prop-
 erty  he  has  seized."_Candidate  J.F.K.,
 Johnstown, Pa., October 15, 1960.
 "We must let Mr. Khrushchev know that
 we are permitting no expansion of his foot-
 hold in our hemisphere."-Candidate J.F.K.,
 Johnstown, Pa., October 15, 1960.
 "I am not satisfied to have the hand of
 the Communists mo-Ye 3,000 miles from East
 Berlin to our former good neighbor in Cuba,
 only 90 miles from the coast of Florida, only
 8 minutes by jet."-Candidate J.F.K., Wash-
 ington, D.C., September 20, 1980.
 "If communism should obtain a perma-
 nent foothold in Latin America then the
 balance of power would move against us
 and peace would be even more insecure."-
 Candidate J.F.K., New York City, Septem-
 ber 14, 1980.
 I include some examples of the ex-
 pressions of indignation for the RECORD
 in the hope that the administration will
 withdraw its support of this effort, the
 only result of which can be the support
 of communism and Castro-consistent
 with 1960 promises:

 DEAR ME. CRAMER: Congratulations on your

 DEAR SIR: We concur with your estimate of
 the Cuban prisoner exchange deal; we think
 it does, too, in other words. To have arranged
 the exchange of Abel for Powers is a poor
 recommendation for  New  York  Attorney
 James B. Donovan; it's downright suspicious,
 in fact.  What about the Cuban children who
 have been shipped to Russia, Red China, and
 other  Communist  countries? Is anybody
 trying to effect their release?           -

 Mrs. H. M. THOMPSON.

 DEAR CONGRESSMAN: I am backing you in
 your stand against negotiations being per-

 trading with Cuba, an enemy country.  This
 is contrary, I believe, to the Logan Act. -
 -Hon. WILLIAM CRAMER,
 House of Representatives,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SIR: What is all this talk about this
 James Donovan making deals with Castro for
 the prisoners held there?  And who has au-
 thorized him to do so?
 If I am not mistaken it was decided some
 time ago we would not be held up to pay ran-
 som to that bearded butcher.
 Has this matter of James Donovan making
 deals with Castro been discussed on Capitol
 Hill at this time-or is it none of the busi-
 ness of our Congressmen and Senators these
 days?  Soon, at the rate we are going, we will
 not need our elected Members of Congress
 and Senators.
 I would say the administration's leadership
 is talking out of both sides of their mouth
 and what is more in the act of blocking his
 country with one hand and handing him
 great quantities of food, medicine, and of all
 things money-taxpayers' money.  How as-
 inine.
 Khrushchev will not have to bury us with
 such stupid leadership carrying out such
 deals.  We are bankrupting our Nation and
 tearing it down morally with such lowbrow
 leadership these days.
 With every good wish.

 Hon. WILLIAM CRAMER' Have been reading
 about Donovan going to Cuba to offer food

 ers.  Seems this would be a big help to the
 enemy who could so easily ship It to Russia,

 of it. How mixed up can the State Depart-

 We are certainly backing you in your stand

 fighting communism.

 Cuban situation is most alarming and we
 hope the most drastic measures possible will

 DEAR SIR: I am in full accord with your
 demand for a congressional investigation
 that the U.S. Government may pay part of
 the ransom for Cuban invasion prisoners, if
 we pay this ranson or - "blackmail" to the
 Castro government this Nation will have to
 hang its head in shame forever.  There is
 too much double talking about what we will
 do, but never do, as President Kennedy said,
 no one should doubt our resolution in Laos,
 but the picture is that Laos has gone to the
 Communists.  So let's begin to say a few
 things we mean and back our words with ac-
 tion if necessary in any way that will bring
 results.

 HONORABLE   CONGRESSMAN:   We   whole-

 having the intestinal fortitude to fight this
 disgraceful blackmail. It does one's heart
 good to know that we have one who is not
 afraid to fight for the rights of "The Ameri-

 in your fight and wish you success in doing
 so.

 DEAR REPRESENTATIVE CRAMER: I have been
 reading with interest and concern about the
 proposed ransoming of the Bay of Pigs pris-
 oners.
 It would be a terrible mistake to give the
 enemy any succor,  In the first place, people
 who feel strong enough about dictatorship
 and oppression to fight are the last to ask
 or approve any.aid to the enemy.  It is nat-
 ural that relatives and loved ones, as well as
 our heart, ask that the prisoners be rescued
 but this is total war with communism.
 Secondly, it doesn't make sense to give dol-
 lars and medicine with the right hand and
 then organize a blockade with the left.
 Encourage the President to enforce a com-
 embargo on trade with Cuba but don't
 plete
 vote for or authorize one red cent, public or
 private, for Communist Castro's Cuba.
 Respectfully offered,
 FRED M. WHITAKER.

 MY DEAR SIR: May I extend my compli-
 ments upon your stand in connection with
 the Donovan deal.
 I do not see how we van have a policy
 which asks the Greeks, the Swedes, the Nor-
 wegians and the British to withhold com-
 merce from Cuba and, at the same time, even
 as ransom, permit the giving of more prob-
 ably give (with taxpayer's money), $62 mil-
 lion worth of food and drugs.
 All reports in the press and elsewhere in-
 dicate that our South American neighbors
 have lost respect for our policy, due to our
 wavering on the Cuba situation.  If this deal
 is permitted to go through, surely it cannot

 DEAR MR. CRAMER: With a full realization
 of time consumption of correspondence, I
 hesitate to write. However, there Is a point
 that keeps coming to my mind, which Is this:
 If our Congress Is going to allow the Supreme
 Court (known sometimes as a school board)
 "to rewrite the Constitution to conform to
 the spirit of the times and to take into ac-
 count sociological. If not ideological changes"
 (quote editorial US. News & World Report,
 Oct. 1, 1962), I say again, If this Is going
 to be, then also apply the spirit of times to
 the  judges.   The  Supreme  Court  judges
 should be elected by the people.  Again, I
 repeat, If they are going to write the laws
 (and be a school board), they should have
 to come before the people for election.
 One other questions, Does our Congress of
 the United States of America believe the
 14th amendment changes the 10th amend-
 ment?
 Stop Castro somehow.
 It is with regret you will not be our Rep-
 resentative In 1963.  We wish you well and
 keep plugging.

 CONCLUSION
 Mr. Speaker, as will be noted, and as
 a conclusive reminder of the results of
 our profligacy, and of our precarious and
 worsening financial situation, foreign
 holders of our dollars and claims on our
 gold have been calling for gold.  They
 are apprehensive.   We cannot expect
 them to maintain faith in our dollar
 when we oursel es so heedlessly and so
 consistently connue to depreciate it.
 It is our dollar; no theirs.  If we will
 not respect its traditional value, neither
 address to Congress at, the'--beginning of
 this session ranked inflation i. the fore-
 front of the enemies of freedom'.. He also
 submitted a budget in balance-precar-
 iously, tenuously, it is true, but norfethe-
 less slightly in balance.  And he ufged
 past budgets, its balance was prospec-
 tively arrived at; it rested on estimated
 uncertainties as to revenues.  Like so
 many past budgets, it violated rules of
 prudence by failing to allow clear safety
 margins as a hedge against overopti-
 mism. For months the financial writers
 and market analysts have been saying
 we would incur another deficit.  It is
 now clear-and universally conceded-
 that we will close the fiscal year again
 deeply in the -red.  In the last 8 years,
 1955-62, final results, for a variety of
 reasons, varied from original budget pre-
 dictions and recommendations by over
 $28 billion-that much deeper than had
 been originally budgeted.
 Jefferson's admonition is particularly
 applicable in this emergency:
 I place economy among the first and most
 important virtues, and public debt as the
 greatest of dangers to be feared.  To preserve
 our  Independence,  we  must      not  let  our
 erty or profusion and servitude.   If we r n
 into such debts, we must be taxed in         ur
 meat and drink, in our necessities an       our
 comforts, in our labors and in our a      case-
 ments.  If we can prevent the Gover ment
 from wasting the labors of the peopl , under
 the pretense of caring for them, the will be
 happy.
 Mr. Speaker, but for the in  fatigable
 labor and sound business j   gment of
 the distinguished gentlema  from New
 York [Mr. TABER] and oth  s who have
 stood with him during hi7 40 years of
 dedicated service to the re?'duction of the
 budgets, the national d 'bt, frightening
 and dangerous as it is-  a national debt
 would be even billions   d billions higher
 today.  When the ge tleman.from New
 York, JOHN TABER, c me to the House in
 1923, the national 4ebt was $22 billion.
 Today it is $30 ' billion-and going
 higher.
 When JOHN TABER came to the House
 in 1923, the annual expenditure of the
 Government was $3 billion. Today it is
 $115 billion-and going higher.
 When JOHN TABER came to the House
 in 1923, there were 536,000 Federal em-
 ployees. Today there are 2,514,000-and
 there will be more.
 The inescapable consequences in store
 for us if this trend continues indefinitely
 are unpredictable.  In this situation we
 are not in position to further expand the
 Federal establishment or undertake ad-
 ditional obligations beyond those abso-
 lutely essential.  On the contrary it is
 high time we took carefully considered
 reduction of the public debt.
 lopt
 dical
 rifice for many of our Members, I believe
 we can now lay down our burdens secure
 in the knowledge that. we have met our
 legislative obligations to the best of our
 ability and that the record, of this ses-
 sion bears the stamp of solid accomplish-
 ment in many vital areas;' both domestic
 and foreign.
 The House now co dudes its first year
 of operation under; the guidance of the
 gentleman from^*assachusetts, Speaker
 MCCoRMACK, w ose leadership has been
 ably and a  oitly executed during the
 past 10 m  ths.  His performance dur-
 ing this t'  a of stress and unprecedented
 challenhas been outstanding.  His
 reput ####ion as one of the truly great
 Speakers of this House is sealed with the
 reg6rd of this session.  I extend my per-
 me.                                                                                   I believe my appreciation also ex-
 presses the sense of the Members on
 both sides of the aisle.
 The Speaker loves and seeks to serve
 with fairness and dedication every Mem-
 ber of the House. As the devoted leader
 of his party he has given skilled effort
 and tireless attention to the great pro-
 gram of President Kennedy.
 The lea ership is deeply in the debt
 of its Detocratic whip, the gentleman
 from Louisiana [Mr. BOGGS] and his as-
 sistant whips, for the truly magnificent
 work they have done during this ses-
 sion.  They have been extremely ac-
 curate in  their  polls  on  legislative
 matters.  For outstanding. and devoted
 assistance on so many occasions, I per-
 sonally am deeply indebted to my friend
 and  coworker,  the  gentleman from
 Louisiana, HALE BOGGS.
 I can find no adequate words to give
 full expression to the gratitude I feel
 toward all the Members of the House,
 both Democrats and Republicans, for
 the many kindnesses they have shown
 me.  Members of my own party have
 given me support and help of a measure
 far greater than I could have hoped to

 them constantly during this session.
 The Members of the House, its officers,
 and employees, all have given tireless
 devotion and effort during this long and
 arduous session.  Our Parliamentarian,
 Lew Deshler, whose workday and work-
 load are exceeded only by his great tal-
 ents and knowledge, was ill for a few days
 last week but we are fortunate now to
 have him back among us during the clos-

 has no peer In his field. His services are
 essential to the functioning of the House.
 He has been a bulwark of strength not
 only In his capacity as the leading par-
 liamentarian of the world but as a wise
 and experienced servant of this House.
 He has through every hour of every ses-
 sion been the strong, Indispensable right
 arm of the leadership on both sides of
 the aisle.
 I hope that the months ahead will
 bring opportunity for rest and relaxation
 for the Members and officers and em-
 ployees, all of whom have worked hard
 and deserve a time away from their
 strenuous routines.  Again I thank you
 for your friendship and your help.  I
 wish for each and every one of you good
 health and good fortune, in die present
 and in the future.

 (Mr. GRAY asked and was given per-
 mission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD.)
 [Mr. GRAY'S remarks will appear
 hereafter in the Appendix.)
 MATTER OF CONSCIENCE
 (Mr. CRAMER asked and was given
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr. CRAMER.  Mr. Speaker, In the
 Cuban ransom blackmail deal, it is be-
 coming more evident that the attempt to
 raise moneys, foodstuffs, and medicines
 to be turned over to Castro to help keep
 him in power, could properly be de-
 scribed as a "Kennedy Conscience Fund"
 for the failure of the Bay of Pigs inva-
 sion.  The following editorial from the
 Tampa Tribune in my district indicates
 that this iswhat that newspaper thinks,
 which Is in support of what I have been
 saying:
 MATTER OF  CONSCIENCE
 The more that leaks out about the pro-
 posed ransoming of the 1,118 Cuban Invasion
 prisoners, the worse the deal looks for the
 United States.
 Ali the signs suggest that the ransom is
 not only approved by President Kennedy but
 that most of the food, medicine, and money
 handed over to Fidel Castro will come from
 American taxpayers.  Nobody knows what
 the final agreement may call for but Castro
 originally demanded $62 million; if he knows
 that the President is behind the negoti-
 ations, he Is not likely to settle for less.
 And Castro can hardly fall to know.
 The New York World-Telegram said yester-
 day that the American negotiator, New York
 lawyer James B. Donovan, was given the as-
 signment last June by none other than At-
 torney General Robert Kennedy.
 An earlier tipoff came in a column by
 Joseph Alsop. published on this page Tues-
 day.  Alsop, who Is close to the Kennedys,
 said In effect that the President had de-
 cided to ransom the prisoners as a matter
 of conscience, because he was responsible for
 the bungled invasion.
 A further clue Is the fact that the com-
 mittee of Cuban exiles which for some
 months has been attempting to raise the
 ransom money by private donation has had
 little success. . The only fairy godmother
 with the equivalent of $00 million to drop In

 the pot is the Federal Government.                            The
 money presumably could be taken fromTe

 w  c ma es no pu                                              otits
 n   n .
 Now, we have deep sympathy for the 1,113
 captives and all the thousands of less-pub-
 licized prisoners rotting in  Castro's jails.
 We also can appreciate President Kennedy's
 lacerations of conscience, from the nagging
 knowledge that his denial of air support
 wrecked the invasion and caused the cap-
 ture of most of the little army of freedom
 lighters.
 But there are more than the welfare of
 prisoners and the mental comfort of the
 President to consider.
 There are, for example, the national honor
 and the campaign to free Cuba from com-
 munism.
 Our prestige suffered enough from the Bay
 of Pigs defeat, when the world's mightiest
 nation permitted Itself to be humiliated by
 a Red dwarf.  What will Latin America and
 the rest of the world think of our now buy-
 ing back the prisoners-instead of rescuing
 them at gunpoint?                         -
 Even worse, perhaps, in the world's view
 will be the inconsistency of threatening to
 penalize Allied countries whose ships carry
 cargoes to Cuba at. the very time our Gov-
 ernment is preparing to ship to Castro in-
 valuable supplies of food and medicine.
 Who can understand such a violent Contra-
 diction in declared policy?
 We are reminded of President Kennedy's
 stirring words In announcing the failure of
 the Invasion in April 1961.  Speaking sternly
 of the necessity for resolute action to main-
 tain freedom In this hemisphere, he said "the
 complacent, the self-indulgent, the soft so-
 cieties will be swept away with the debris
 of history."
 Ransoming the prisoners, we submit, is the
 course of softness.  Unless the President be-
 gins to meet the Cuban problem with some
 of the promised toughness of spirit, more of
 free Latin America will become debris on the
 Red tide.  And Mr. Kennedy then will have
 on his conscience not 1,113 prisoners but
 millions.

 with much needed dollars, foodstuffs,
 and medicines, all of which he can trade
 off for more war materiel to be used
 against the United , States of America
 and the freedom-loving countries of this
 hemisphere, and which he can use to
 build up communism in other countries
 in this hemisphere.  That is what is
 wrong with this whole deal.
 I hope that puts it in focus.  Now,
 where are we? As of now we find Mr.
 Donovan back in Miami. Negotiations
 have been going on for months. I un-
 derstand the Ransom Committee started
 in April and Donovan interceded in early
 August 1962.
 The American people have not been
 told this. The American people are not
 told even now what the deal is.  The
 American people have not been advised.
 The American people do not know what
 authority Mr. Donovan has to negoti-
 ate in regard to contributions by this
 Nation or its people to this ransom deal.
 When I inquired of the State Depart-
 ment about it they admitted that they
 were  doing  "contingency  planning."
 That is a good gobbledygook term, is it
 not?  "Contingency planning" in the
 event that a request came from Mr.
 Donovan and the committee for contri-
 butions on the part of the United States.
 I asked the State Department's Mr.
 Robert A. Hurwitch, Assistant Secretary
 of State, about this "contingency plan-
 ning," "What authority do you have to
 spend 5 cents in paying ranson to an
 enemy, payment by the Government of
 the United States to Fidel Castro?"  I
 have never knowingly and intentionally
 voted a nickel that could be used by the
 Government of the United States as pay-
 ment to an enemy government, to Cas-
 tro or communism.
 He said in that respect that that, too,
 is part of the "contingency planning" to
 determine where moneys or foodstuffs or
 other matters of value are that could be
 made available to the committee.  Is
 there any doubt that it is being given
 consideration?
 Mr.  BOW.  Mr.  Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. CRAMER.  I yield to the gentle-
 man from Ohio.
 Mr. BOW.   May I say to the gentle-
 man from Florida in regard to the tax-
 payer's funds being used for a contin-
 gency of that kind that as a member of
 the subcommittee making appropriations
 for the State Department I would say
 there is no money that has been appro-
 priated for that purpose.  They never
 have submitted any request for money
 for that purpose.
 As one member of the committee I
 s     In Mire nex ,_ye ~ _ e - n
 been n   d, and if it has we will bring it
 to       attention oHouse  But I
 would serve no ice on the State Depart-
 ment now that here is no - money that
 has been appropriated by our committee
 for that purpose.  I would think they
 would be making a great mistake if they
 used funds appropriated for other pur-
 poses for any such purpose as the gentle-
 man'has now referred to.
 Mr. CRAMER.        I thank the gentle-
 man.  I agree this should be the case.
 I think the gentleman is referring like-
 wse to the Central Intelligence Agency.
 I am confident no onelns  o y  as
 voted for those appropriations thinking
 they could be used for that purpose.
 Mr. GROSS.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. CRAMER. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Iowa.
 Mr. GROSS. I want to commend the
 gentleman from Florida for the cam-
 paign he has carried on in the last sev-
 eral days on this issue and say to him
 I thoroughly agree that not one dime
 ers wi  ou t e express authoriza-  ing many questions that, I am sure, are
 tion oY ~ C o ~ n r e s s : T T h i i s w o u   e, l seems in the minds of the American people as
 to me, Fie worst kind of tribute paid to
 Fidel Castro. I am sure the gentleman
 knows and every Member of the House
 knows that the money thus expended
 would be paid over eventually to the
 Russians.
 Mr. CRAMER. I thank the gentleman.
 He put his finger exactly on the prob-
 lem.                                                 I go further and say that dollars
 collected by the voluntary ransom com-
 mittee likewise-gives Castro just as much
 support and are of just as much value
 to him.  That, too, should not be per-
 mitted,
 I started to discuss briefly these ne-
 gotiations.   Look  where the United
 States of America now is. We find that
 Mr. Donovan is back in Miami probably
 conferring with Mr. Greenfield, a rep-
 resentative of the State Department in
 project X. All this mystery, with no in-
 formation made available to the Amer-
 ican public. We find Mr. Donovan sug-
 gesting that there is a hitch in the ne-
 gotiations.  I assume the hitch is, and
 my best information is that the hitch is
 that Mr. Castro, wanting to get as much
 advantage as he can out of this propa-
 gandawise-and do not think he is the
 only one behind this.  Do not think
 Khrushchev is not giving him advice on
 how to get the most propaganda ad-
 vantage out of this.  They are going to
 drag it along a little while, let the whole
 world know that the United States of
 America is willing to get on its knees to
 Fidel Castro, the puppet of Red China
 and Russia in Cuba.
 So they are upping the ante-drag-
 ging on the negotiations-ask for more
 of everything-more money, more food-
 stuffs, more medicine, additional guar-
 antees,  supply new  lists  that Castro
 wants filled, change the ground rules.
 How long is this humiliating experience
 going on? He must have gotten word
 from Khrushchev. He must have got-
 ten word from Mao Tse-tung that he
 is making points in the world propa-
 gandawise-keep it up, keep the United
 States of America on its knees, let the
 world know Mr. Donovan who has au-
 thority to negotiate from the U.S. Gov-
 Castro, Khrushchev and Mao must be
 saying.  The asininity of this thing.
 How did we ever get ourselves in such
 a position is hardly understandable to
 me.
 Mr. GROSS.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. CRAMER. I yield to the gentle-
 man.
 picture an w -a in eres he has?- n this
 business. Weis financing him? What
 autl fifty has he been delegated by the
 U.S. Government?  Why do we have
 highly paid diplomats by the score?
 Are they unable to carry on negotiations,
 if negotiations should be carried on? Is
 this administration saying it is neces-
 sary to find someone from outside of the
 Government to carry on these negotia-
 tions?  I do not understand the situa-
 tion at all.
 well as people throughout the world.
 This man has no portfolio.  This man
 has no Senate confirmation. This man
 has not put his credentials before the
 American people for examination. This
 man is a private citizen.
 I always felt the Logan Act prevented
 a citizen of the United States from deal-
 ing with foreign countries, even a friend-
 ly country let alone an enemy.  So the
 only way that he could be negotiating
 without violating the law would be if he
 had "the authority of the United States"
 to do so. So we can only assume that he
 does have, but I hasten to add he should
 never have gotten that kind of permis-
 sion from me.  So we are being forced
 now to get down on our knees and crawl
 before Castro and the Communists and
 to accede to the indemnity demands re-
 sulting from this abortive invasion fail-
 ure and to accede to the demands for
 ransom of a bearded, power hungry mad-
 man, Fidel Castro, who is threatening
 the security of this entire hemisphere.
 That gives the Communists a beachhead
 in this hemisphere the likes of which
 they never had in the history of com-
 munism.  Now they want us to crawl
 even more. It is time to put a stop to it.
 I wrote for consideration of my reso-
 lution calling for an end to this humilia-
 tion and aid to Castro. This is some of
 the unresolved business of this session.
 The request follows:
 OCTOBER 11, 1962.
 Hon. THOMAS E. MORGAN,
 Chairman, the committee on Foreign Affairs,
 House of Representatives, Washington,
 D.C.
 DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am deeply disturbed
 by reports that the President, through Mr.
 Donovan,  is  negotiating  to bargain  away
 American dollars and/or foodstuffs to Com-
 munist  Castro who recently, in a strong
 resolution passed by the House, was declared
 to be an enemy of the U.S. Government, and
 it appears from the latest news reports that
 there are proposaalsbeing--made to pay him
 in dollars fro   ClA funds .'
 This is abou     $he-greRest abuse of Presi-
 dential discretion as I can remember in the
 history of this country because I, as a Mem-
 ber of Congress, have at no time, knowingly
 ,-or"intentionally, ever voted for any funds,
 CIA Pr in any other authorization or appro-
 -prfation bill, that would permit the Presi-
 dent to spend taxpayers' money to pay off
 ransom and indemnity demands, to give into
 blackmail threats by an enemy government
 and, in particular, Fidel Castro.
 As you know, I have pending House Con-
 current  Resolution  459,  which  provides:
 "That it is the sense of Congress that this
 Government oppose the trading of dollars for,

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE                     22239
 to why this redemption of prisoners or
 ransom of prisoners is considered to be
 a charitable activity, the Secretary said,
 and I read again:
 Throughout history the redemption of
 prisoners has been regarded as a charitable
 activity.
 And I will include the entire incredible
 letter at the end of my remarks.
 Let us bring this thing in focus. That
 leads to the conclusion of providing $62
 million to Fidel Castro whom the Presi-
 dent himself called the enemy of the
 United States, by invoking the Trading
 with the Enemy Act effective February
 7, 1962, which the President did to cut
 off the importation of Havana cigars
 coming in even through third friendly
 countries like Canada or the Canary
 Islands.  See   CONGRESSIONAL   RECORD,
 page 5847, April 11, 1962. The President
 by   invoking the  Trading  with    the
 Enemy Act through Presidential procla-
 mation declared Fidel Castro, and prop-
 erly so, as an enemy of free nations of
 the world and the United States in par-
 ticular. Yet, with this Treasury ruling,
 we find the typical inconsistent position
 of the New Frontier-talk tough and use
 a powder puff-we find the New Frontier
 at this time permitting the collection of
 $62 million that is going to be used for
 what purpose? I am just as sympathetic
 to the prisoners as anybody else.  I
 realize and so does everyone in the world
 how they got there, It was because they
 were not given the air coverage at the
 Bay of Pigs that they were entitled to
 and promised.  But I want to free all
 the people in Cuba. "I want to see the
 6 million people who live in Cuba free.
 They are all prisoners of communism
 and Castro.  If we free 1,113 who are
 now in prison, is Castro going to make
 another demand on the other 100,000
 Cubans in prison in Cuba?  If we set
 this precedent, what are we faced with
 in the future, the great powerful free-
 dom-loving United States of America?
 We are faced with a precedent of paying
 money in ransom for prisoners.  To
 whom?  To the enemy.  Of paying in-
 demnity to the enemy,
 I thought our historical answer to
 such demands has been-"Millions for
 defense-not one cent for tribute."
 That should be our answer today.
 What is going to be the result? What
 is Fidel Castro going to do with this
 money?  That is the point.  What is
 the Cuban Government, the Communists,
 going to do with this money, and drugs,
 and foodstuffs?
 Fidel Castro is going to use them to
 keep himself and the Communists and
 the many Russian technicians, and Red
 Chinese in Cuba, to keep them in power
 and continue to subject the 6 million
 citizens of Cuba to virtual slavery. That
 is what we are contributing to.
 That is why I am opposed to this abor-
 tive proposal and have been from its in-
 ception with the April 17 failure of the
 invasion of 1961. If you recall, I intro-
 duced a resolution opposing the tractors
 deal just a few weeks after it was made.
 So we have to keep our minds on what
 is going to happen by giving this ran-
 som aid.  It is going to permit Fidel
 Castro to stay in power, to permit the
 Communists to stay in power and to sub-
 jugate the 6 million people in Cuba, and
 at the same time challenge the freedoms
 of the rest of the Western Hemisphere,
 challenge it by exporting Communists to
 other. countries of the hemisphere-even
 with arms.
 I say this is wrong.  And the gentle-
 man from Illinois the other day said
 critically that I should be the general
 to lead the invasion forces.  I would
 suggest that the gentleman from Illinois
 aid me, follow me, rather than criticize
 me-not necessarily as a general leading
 the invasion with words, as he said, but
 I am at least not guilty of being silent
 in opposing this abortive proposal that
 is against everything that we stand for,
 the dignity of America, the freedom of
 the hemisphere, and a strong position in
 opposition to atheistic communism.
 Look where we are today. What posi-
 tion are we in?. We find. that Mr. Dono-
 van, who just happens to be a candidate
 for the U.S. Senate in New York, we find
 he was designated many months ago to
 do this negotiating.  He obviously was
 given permission to do so.
 Mr. O'HARA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker,
 will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. CRAMER.  I will yield after I
 have finished.
 Mr. FULTON.  Mr. Speaker, I believe
 the gentleman is -making a     s
 merit.  It should be taken seriously.
 WEN concerns me is that the adminis-
 tration is still making Berlin its first
 and only challenge by the Communists
 and fails to watch out for Cuba, and the
 direct threat of the large military build-
 up to the United States, the American
 people, and the free World.  Possibly
 Berlin is a diversion, with only small
 forces involved at present, but a two-
 headed thrust, when Cuba is carefully
 considered.  I cannot understand why
 the administration thinks a military
 base in Cuba, could be  "defensive."
 Why?
 I believe that Cuba is equal to the
 challenge of communism that Berlin is.
 I know this from firsthand personal ob-
 servation within the past 2 weeks.
 On September 29 and 30, 1962, I went
 to the U.S. Guantanamo Naval Base in
 Cuba and was there for several days
 working hard to get firsthand informa-
 tion for our U.S. security.  It was a seri-
 ous trip.  We were flown into Guanta-
 namo escorted by two U.S. fighter jets,
 and we were flown out escorted by two
 U.S. fighter jets. That shows it is seri-
 ous business.
 When I was there I was shocked to
 find that there are 3,200 Cuban employ-
 ees employed at the Guantanamo Naval
 Base in Cuba, and 2,400 of them go home
 in the Cuban territory in Oriente Prov-
 ince every evening.  These are the peo-
 ple that run the shipyard, and include
 craftsmen, metalworkers, welders, drill-
 ers, carpenters, every kind of a trade
 that we have in oversupply in the United
 States.  These are the workers in this
 greatest U.S. naval base and shipyard.
 Why not American workmen?
 I am from the city of Pittsburgh, and
 we have a tremendous number of un-
 employed in heavy industry trained in
 this type of work, yet we cannot get the
 administration people to employ these
 people at the Guantanamo Naval Base
 in Cuba.
 Why  this  discrimination  against
 American citizens, trained U.S. workers,
 and U.S. jobless veterans?
 Castro's government in Cuba could
 shut our naval base down overnight by
 blocking the entry of these workers and
 diverting them as a ready made task
 force to the new Soviet-financed base
 now building near Havana.  Guantana-
 mo is the largest U.S. Navy base we have
 any place in the world, and ship basic
 repairs for the whole.U.S. Atlantic Fleet
 are made here. Castro could shut Guan-
 tanamo down overnight simply by pre-
 venting the 2,400 employees from going
 in on any particular morning.
 Another trouble is this: Because of
 this Cuban payroll, between $6 and $8
 million in U.S. cash is going into-Cas-
 tro's coffers to keep Communism going
 in Cuba.  That is being supported and
 paid for by U.S. taxpayers through pay-
 ments made to these Cuban employees.
 One of the tragedies of the Cuban situ-
 ation is that at Guantanamo Bay we
 have only 1,500 military servicemen sta-
 tioned there. Navy ships come and go,
 but they are not shore based. There are
 3,200 Cuban employees who are able to
 take the U.S. Guantanamo base over at
 any given moment, many of them just
 as well physically built and equipment
 trained as any of the U.S. servicemen
 we have there.
 Another problem that struck me very
 seriously is the neglect of this adminis-
 tration in not having the planes parked
 on the base runways protected at any
 time. There are no embankments or
 concrete revetments.  Those planes are
 there just awaiting another Pearl Har-
 bor.  We need action for defense at
 Guantanamo and the base needs con-
 struction quick to modernize all installa-
 tions.  I am sure base personnel will
 heartily concur if asked.
 Just 3 miles out of the base on one side,
 beyond Suicide Ridge, on one. of the high
 hills beyond the Guantanamo Naval Base
 is a gun emplacement with large guns
 aimed right down into the naval base of
 the United States.  In the other direc-
 tion, about 5 miles away, there is another
 small mountain or high hill with more
 guns and artillery aiming down into the
 U.S. naval base.    What are we doing
 about this?
 At the base, we are yet unable to sup-
 ply our own water, and have to depend
 on an outside Cuban water company.
 The source of supply is 4 or 5 miles out-
 side the U.S. naval base.  We have only
 a pipe coming out of there. There is no
 guard by the United States either on the
 reservoir or on the water system in the
 cuban area.  There is just one pipe, so
 that could be shut off at any time.  We
 need salt water conversion equipment,
 and quick.
 The administration should make clear
 we are putting standby carriers down
 there with an adequate reserve supply
 of water in case of a long siege, if neces-
 sary.

 Franciscan Fathers taught the Indians
 to build elaborate aquaducts, irrigation
 ditches and mills.  Here is where the
 Viceroy of Mexico brought Canary Is-
 landers to live and where the Governor's
 palace was later erected.  Over half a
 century before the cornerstone of this
 Capitol was laid the cornerstone of our
 San Fernando Cathedral was laid.
 San Antonio became the meeting point
 of the Spanish-speaking and the Eng-
 lish-speaking cultures on the American
 continents.  It continues to have that
 distinction. But our city is not com-
 posed of only English and Spanish.  To
 this city, which was built hundreds of
 miles beyond the then existing frontier
 of the United States, there came also
 the Germans, the French, and the Irish.
 And from La Villita of the Spanish, Ger-
 mantown  of the Germans,  Military
 Plaza of the Americans, and the Irish
 flats of the Irish, there has truly been
 composed, in every sense of that tranquil
 word,    great and cosmopolitan city
 around which has grown the ninth most
 populated congressional district in the
 United States.
 I speak here for San Antonio and the
 county of Bexar. I do it proudly. There
 is much for which to be proud that is not
 told in terms of history, but rather` in
 those terms by which we take the meas-
 ure of .a city.
 There is much I could tell you of our
 industries, our natural resources, our
 universities, our schools, our hospitals,
 our research foundations, our agricul-
 tural and livestock diversity, our rapidly
 growing population, our parks, our mu-
 seums, our art centers, our multiplicity
 of tourist attractions, our recreational
 facilities, our trade and commerce and
 our ready access to Mexico and to the
 hills and plains of Texas.
 Statistics on all these might burden
 you, for you have your own case to make
 for your own districts.  However, the  the remainder of today's program.
 U.S. Congress has obviously thought well
 of San Antonio for many, many decades.,

 PERSONAL STATEMENT
 (Mr. WHITENER (at the request of
 Mr. BOGGS) was given permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD   and  to  include  extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. WHITENER.  Mr. Speaker, re-
 sponding to the personal and urgent re-
 quest of the Speaker of the House of
 Representatives, I returned to Washing-
 ton today to be present for the meeting
 I had hoped to be here when the calf   The problem involved has to do with
 of the House was made at 12, but due
 to transportation difficulties I did riot
 arrive in time to answer the rollc5lf'.
 Although I was not able to have my
 name recorded as present, I wish-to have
 the RECORD show my presence soon there-
 after.
 PERSONAL STATEMENT
 (Mr. HEMPHILL (at the request of
 Mr. BOGGS)  was given permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in
 the RECORD and ~o include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. HEMPHILL.  Mr. Speaker, this
 morning early,,I received a message from
 our beloved Speaker of the House asking
 that I return to Washington for today's
 session.
 I immddiately made my plans to return
 but transportation difficulties delayed my
 arrive] and I did not arrive in the Cham-
 ber (ntil the rollcali bad been completed.
 I regret this very much, but I do want
 the RECORD to show my presence here for
 ute and to revise and extend his
 marks.)
 Mr. BOGGS.  Mr. Speaker, I should
 like to reply to the very gracious remarks
 made by my distinguished majority lead-
 er, the. gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr.
 ALBERT]. I have had in this second ses-
 sion of this Congress the responsibility of
 majority whip. Mr. Speaker, it has been
 a great pleasure and an honor,to work
 with you and the majority leader of this
 body.
 The name "whip," in my opinion, is
 a misnomer because what we are trying
 to do is work with the Members of the
 House on both sides of the aisle, under-
 stand their problems and understand
 and recognize the fact that all of them
 represent great districts in this mag-
 nificent country of ours..
 Mr. Speaker, it has been an honor and
 a privilege for me to work with you, with
 the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr.
 ALBERT], and my colleagues on the Re-
 publican side.
 PERSONAL EXPLANATION
 Mr. PIRNIE.  Mr. Speaker,. on roll-
 call No. 293 today I was unavoidably de-
 tained. I should like the RE.C RD to show
 that had I been here I wo
 fuld have voted
 "yea."

 BOGGS) was gin,
 ROUND RENTS
 t the request of Mr.
 permission to address
 ? the treatment of redeemable ground
 rents, a common arrangement in Mary-
 land.  The bill would treat the buyer of
 property subject to a redeemable ground
 rent, for tax purposes, as having bought
 the land. This would make him eligible
 for the interest deduction and it would
 treat the seller as having received the
 current value of the ground rent.
 This is a problem that has been un-
 settled for several years. It is my hope
 that legislation similar to H.R. 8754 as
 it passed the House this year can be
 enacted by Congress early next year.  if
 it can be enacted promptly we will be
 able to make its application to home-
 owners retroactive.  The application to
 sellers would, of course, be prospective.
 AMENDMENT  OF  FEDERAL               EM-
 PLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS ACT
 OF 1959
 Mr. OLSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
 imous consent for the immediate consid-
 eration of the bill (H.R. 10539) to amend
 the Federal Employees Health Benefits
 Act of 1959 to provide additional choice
 of health benefits plans, and for other
 purposes.
 The Clerk read the title of the bill.
 The SPEAKER.  Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from Mon-
 tana?
 Mr. CUNNINGHAM.  Reserving the
 right to object, Mr. Speaker, I hope the
 gentleman will explain the legislation.
