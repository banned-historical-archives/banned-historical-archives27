 NKOMO'S ANNOUNCEI1ENT SUGGESTS THAT ALL PROCEDURAL MATTERS MAY
 ALREADY HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT.9
 NKOMO SAID HE WOULD LEAD A 12-MAN DELEGATION TO THE TALKS,
 9UT HE DID NOT INDICATE WHETHER REPRESENTATIVES..OF OTHER NATIONALIST
 FACTIONS WILL BE INCLUDED.   THE. '',.t.EGATION ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL
 NOT INCLUDE NKOMO'S MOST PROMINENT RIVALS, NDABANINGI SITHOLE
 AND BISHOP MUZOREI,IA, WHO HAVE DENOUNCED RFROM EXILE THE
 SMITH-NKOMO MEETINGS.Y
 SETTLEMENT TALKS WILL BE PROLONGED AND DIFFICULT, AND ULTIMATE

 EUROPEAN BRIEF 191-75.Y
 1.   SPAIN:   THE NEW SF..NISH CABINET, WHICH IS TO BE SWORN IN.
 FRIDAY OR SATURDAY, PROMISES A BREAK WITH THE PAST. IT IS LIBERAL IN
 SPANISH TERMS, AS KING JUAN CARLOS AND PRIME MINISTER ARIAS TRY TO
 TAKE SOME OF THE WIND OUT OF THE OPPOSITION'S SAILS.Y
 MANUEL FRAGA IRIBARNE, THE NEW INTERIOR MINISTER, AMD JOSE
 MARIA DE AREILZA, THE NEW FOREIGN MINISTER, FAVOR AN EARLY AND
 FAIRLY EXTENSIVE LIBERALIZATION OF THE SPANISH POLITICAL SYSTEM.
 MOST OF THE OTHER POSTS-ARE FILLED BY MEN WHO FAVOR GRADUAL, BUT
 SIGNIFICANT, CHANGE. THE NEW JUSTICE MINISTER, FORMER AMBASS".D OR
 TO THE VATICAN -ANTONIO GARRIGUES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY INTERPRET THE
 KING'S CONTROVERSIAL PARDON LIBERALLY ENOUGH TO FREE MANY OF THE
 REf1AINiNG POLITICAL PRISONERS-AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE FOR THE LEFTY
 LIEUTENANT GENERAL SANTIAGO DIAZ DE MENDIVIL WAS NAMED DEPUTY
 PRIME MINISTER AND COORDINATOR G'F DEFENSE AFFAIRS. HE IS ONE' OF THE

 SPEAKING AT A PRESS CONFERENCE ON TUESDAY, ANTUNES CONCEDED
 THAT THE ARMED FORCES MOVEMENT-WHICH HAS DOMINATED PORTUGAL FOR THE
 PAST 0 MONTHS- MAY HAVE TO SURRENDER ITS ROLE AS THE VANGUARD OF
 THE REVOLUTION.   FIE CONFIRMED THAT A REVISION OF THE PACT SIGNED
 WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES LAST SPRING IS UNDER WAY, BUT HE STRESSED
 THAT A PRECT?ITATE WITHDRAWAL BY THE iILITARY COULD ENDANGER ITS
 PROGRAM FOR LEADING THE CO!.NTRY TO SOCIALISM.   ANTUNES, WHO HAS
 POLITICAL AMBITIONS OF HIS OWN, WAS RESPONDING TO RECENT DEMANDS
 BY MILITARY AND CIVILIAN LEADERS THAT THE ARMED FORCES MOVEMENT
 RELINQUISH POWER AND "RETURN TO THE BARRACKS."Y
 AMONG THE OFFICERS PUSHING FOR THE MILITARY TO WITHDRAW FROM
 POLITICS ARE A  NIJMOER OF RESPECTED PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS WHO
 BELIEVE THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT
 SOCIALISM.   ALTHOUGH THEIR NUMBER AND INFLUENCE ARE NOT KNOWN1
 SEVERAL OF THE OFFICERS ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN

 ATTACKS THOSE WHO HAVE "NEGATED" THE POLICIES OF THE CULTURAL
 REVOLUTION BY ENDLESS CRITICISM.   THE ONLY SPECIFIC POLICY
 MENTIONED IS THAT OF EDUCATION, BUT THE DEFENSE OF THE "NEW
