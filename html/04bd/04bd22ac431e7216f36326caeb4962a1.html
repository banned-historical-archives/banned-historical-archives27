 19 MAY 1971
 INDOCHINA
 The Vietnamese communists continue to press the line that progress
 toward a peace settlement can come about only if the United States
 agrees to a date for total withdrawal of U.S. troops from South
 Vietnam.  The communist delegates at the Paris talks on 13 May
 again assailed President Nixon for making total withdrawal
 conditional upon release of U.S. prisoners and the ability of the
 Saigon forces to defend themselves.
 The VNA account of the Paris session again obscured specific allied
 proposals on the prisoner issue.  Thus, there was no anticipation
 in the propaganda of the 13 May VNA "statement" which responds to
 the GVN offer to release 570 sick and wounded North Vietnamese.
 The VNA statement proposes that on 4 June both sides send unarmed
 ships flying Red Cross flags to an area south of the 17th parallel
 for the transfer of any "illegally detained patriots" who choose
 to come to North Vietnam.  Previous GVN releases of sick and
 wounded North Vietnamese prisoners--in July 1970 and January
 1971--had also been preceded by statements from Hanoi that
 similarly said those "detained patriots" who chose to come to the
 North would be welcome.  The current statement differs only in its
 outlining of the DRV's formal participation in the transfer by the
 dispatch of ships, a procedure probably dictated by the much
 larger number of prisoners--570 as against the 62 released last
 July and the 37 released in January.
 Hanoi and Front media praise as an "important peace initiative"
 the NLHS' "new proposal" for an immediate end to U.S. bombing over
 Laos, followed by a cease-fire and. a discussion of the formation
 of a provisional coalition government by the "Lao parties concerned."
 Moscow also promptly endorses the proposal in low-level propaganda.
 Peking has merely reported the plan without comment.
 Moscow's continued expressions of support for the Indochinese
 people include Kosygin's remarks at an 18 May luncheon for visiting
 Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau in which he expressed "alarm" at
 continued aggression in Indochina and reiterated support of the
 programs for political settlement put forward by the "patriots" of
 Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.  The DRV press publicizes Brezhnev's
 expression of "militant solidarity" with the Indochinese people in
 his 14 May Tbilisi speech.

 proposal had been made at the Paris talks, a pattern that accords
 with Hanoi treatment of previous GVN releases of North Vietnamese
 prisoners.  The VNA statement says merely that "on 29 April, on
 U.S. orders, the Saigon administration again announced the release
 of a number of Vietnamese illegally arrested in South Vietnam
 whom they called 'North Vietnamese prisoners of war.'"
 Hanoi may feel that to explicitly acknowledge the GVN proposal
 advanced at the 29 April Paris session would be at variance
 with its insistence that discussion of the release of prisoners
 can take place only after U.S. agreement to a date for total
 troop withdrawal.  Hanoi has also studiously ignored other
 allied proposals advanced at Paris for international inspection
 of prisoner of war camps and for the repatriation or transfer
 to neutral countries of captives who have been imprisoned for
 a long time.*
 The VNA statement calls the GVN "announcement" an "old trick" of
 the Nixon Administration, aimed at misleading public opinion.
 Typical of Hanoi's practice of avoiding explicit acknowledgment
 of the VPA presence in the South, the statement refers only to
 "patriots" illegally arrested and detained.  VIA recalls that a
 24 December 1970 DRV statement said that any "patriot" released
 by the allied side "who wishes to core and settle in North
 Vietnam will be received and assisted by the DRV Government."
 Not surprisingly, VNA fails to indicate that the DRV statement--
 as well as one from the PRG that it cites--was issued in response
 *  The suggestion that sick and wounded prisoners be released was
 tendered by GVN Foreign Minister Tran Van Lam in Saigon on
 26 January, two days after the GVN's release of 37 DRV sick and
 wounded North Vietnamese on the occasion of Tet.  The proposal
 was introduced at the Paris talks on 4 February by GVN delegate
 Pharr Dang Lam.  Lam recalled this proposal at the 22 April
 session, along with suggestions for repatriation or transfer to
 neutral countries of long-held prisoners, and on 29 April he
 specified that the GVN was ready to unilaterally release 570
 sick and wounded.  President Nixon, in his press conference that
 day, called attention to this proposal as well as to the one for
 the transfer of prisoners to a neutral country.  Lam repeated
 the proposals at the Paris sessions on the 6th and 13th, but in
 the later instance he did not specify the'numbers involved.

 to GVN Foreign Minister Tran Van Lam's 22 December announcement
 that his government would release a number of sick and wounded
 DRV prisoners on the occasion of Tet.
 The VNA statement stipulates that the prisoners be transported
 on 4 June by unarmed U.S.-Saigon civil ships flying a Red Cross
 flag to an area south of the 17th parallel, where they would
 be transferred to unarmed DRV civil ships flying a Red Cross
 flag.  It demands a 24-hour cease-fire in the area of the
 release and says that the allies must announce in advance "the
 number and characteristics of the ships transporting the
 patriots to be released this time."  It provides that if the
 weather is bad, the release will be postponed until further
 notice, and it says the U.S. and Saigon administrations "must
 bear full responsibility for all consequences if they act
 counter to the abovementioned stipulations."
 BACKGROUND     There are precedents for VNA's outlining of the
 manner in which the GVN should release the
 prisoners.  In response to delegate Lam's announcement at the
 3.1 June 1970 Paris session that his government intended to
 release a group of 62 sick and wounded North Vietnamese
 prisoners as well as 24 North Vietnamese fishermen, the DRV
 on 23 June issued a VNA "authorized statement."  That state-
 ment--in language identical to the current one--.aid that "on
 orders from the United States, the Saigon administration on
 11 June again raised the issue of releasing a group of 24
 North Vietnamese fishermen and 62 other people . . . whom they
 call 'North Vietnamese prisoners of war.'"  VNA said that past
 practice must be followed and that the prisoners must be
 released at the 17th parallel or at a place adjacent to the
 FRV coast.
 Last January Hanoi at first ignored the details of the GVN plan
 to release sick and wounded prisoners across the DMZ, spelled
 out by Paris delegate Lam at the 14 January session.  An
 authorized VNA statement on 23 January countered by declaring
 that the same procedures must be followed as on 11 July 1970,
 then proceeded to spell out the details of how they would be
 released at sea.  A 25 January foreign ministry spokesman's
 statement scored the GVN for its release the day before of the
 prisoners across the DMZ.
 The matter of sick and wounded North Vietnamese prisoners held
 by the GVN also figured in Hanoi propaganda in 1968, during

 the U.S.-DRV bilateral talks in Paris.  Thus, a VNA authorized
 statement on 11 August 1968--on the heels of Ambassador
 Harriman's announcement at Paris of the U.S. decision to
 release 14 North Vietnamese naval personnel captured during an
 engagement in July 1966--assailed what it called a "recent"
 Saigon government communique on the "so-called question" of
 releasing sick and wounded North Vietnamese prisoners.  VNA
 reiterated the line--standard at that time--that any detainees
 in the South are either "southern compatriots" or DRV'civilian
 or military personnel who have been arrested and detained
 illegally.  It demanded "immediate" release of all DRV citizens.*
 DRV. PRG AT PARIS STRESS NEED FOR TOTAL U.S. TROOP WITHDRAWAL
 The VNA account of the 13 May session of the Paris talks says
 both communist delegates stressed that in order for the Paris
 conference to make headway the President should set a "clear"
 deadline for the withdrawal of all,U.S. and other allied
 foreign troops from South Vietnam.  VNA says that DRV delegate
 Xuan Thuy "made clear the good will" of the DRV and the PRG
 for peace as "expounded in the fair and reasonable proposals
 for a correct settlement of the Vietnam problem" and that he
 "exposed the obduracy and bellicosity of the U.S. and Saigon
 administrations, which are seeking by all means to stall the
 Paris" talks.
 VNA notes that Xuan Thuy repeated what Hanoi cells the "concrete
 proposal" presented at the 29 April session of the talks calling
 for immediate discussion of the question of a time limit for a
 total U.S. troop withdrawal so that the questions of ensuring the
 safety of the withdrawing troops and the release of captured
 military men may then be taken up without delay.  Emphasizing
 that the PRG and DRV proposals are "still on the conference
 table," Thuy said the key point at present is that President
 Nixon must announce "on which day, in which month, in which
 year he will complete" the U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam.
 He added:  "Of course, the date chosen should be a reasonable
 one and not one implying a prolonged withdrawal."  Xuan Thu!,,
 also said, although VNA does not report it, that "only after
 this question is solved can other questions, including the
 question of releasing captured military men, be rapidly solved."

 PRG delegate Nguyen Van Tien--substituting for Mme. Nguyen
 Thi Binh, who was in Hungary--dwelt on U.S. "crimes" against
 the Vietnamese people.  He also reiterated the offer that if
 the United States is unwilling to accept the PRG's 30 June
 time limit for U.S. withdrawal, "it may set another reasonable
 time limit for consideration by the parties concerned."  He
 declared that the "appropriate arrangement of a deadline" for
 the withdrawal of allied troops "will create many favorable
 possibilities for the settlement of all other questions," and
 he added that "this is also a key point for a breakthrough"
 at Paris.
 The VNA account does not acknowledge that Xuan Thuy made a
 point of the fact that the 13 May session coincided with the
 third anniversary of the start of the U.S.-DRV bilateral
 talks.  He observed that after the United States "accepted the
 unconditional bombing halt" the bilateral talks should have
 been "at once" on 6 November turned into a four-part conference.
 He added that this did not happen until 25 January 1969 because
 of obstruction of "the U.S. warlike forces and the Saigon
 administration."  VNA does note that in the course of his
 review of the Paris talks Xuan Thuy said that the Nixon
 Administration once "downgraded" the conference for over eight
 months.  It also notes that he scored the President's May 1969
 and October 1970 peace proposals as "plans for the materializa-
 tion" for U.S. objectives:  He "flatly refuted" the U.S. demand
 for a mutual withdrawal and "the argument about the question of
 U.S. POW's" and "the condition that it will withdraw only when
 the South Vietnamese develop the capability to defend themselves
 against a communist takeover."
 Of the allied delegates, VNA says they "persisted in their
 fallacious and insolent arguments," which "were flatly refuted"
 by Xuan Thuy.  VNA thus ignores the allied delegates' reiteration
 of proposals on prisoner-release, including Ambassador Bruce's
 offer of U.S. transport for North Vietnamese prisoners to any
 agreed neutral country.
 HANOI, FRONT EXPLOIT ALLEGED OPPOSITION TO WAR BY POW'S. GI'S

 in the United States continue to be cited.  And Hanoi as well
 as Liberation Radio have broadcast a series of purported letters
 from U.S. prisoners, most of them anonymous, in programs in
 English for American servicemen.
 Hanoi radio's program for U.S. servicemen on 9 May carried a
 letter from "a group of captured GI's against the war" which
 the broadcast said had been released "some days ago by
 Liberation Radio."  The letter detailed the 26 April PLAF command
 order on the proper treatment of U.S. troops who opposed the
 war and encouraged the troops to resist their military orders
 and express their antiwar sentiments.  On the 15th, Liberation
 Radio's broadcast for U.S. servicemen featured a special
 program marking Armed Forces Day which it said. was presented
 by a group of "captured U.S. servicemen against the war."
 After discussing the meaning of the recent antiwar demonstrations
 in the United States, the broadcast said that if the President
 refuses to end the war, it is up to the men who are fighting
 to end it.  The broadcast also mentioned the PLAF command
 order and encouraged U.S. troops to act against the war.  On
 the 114th, Liberation Radio's broadcast to U.S. servicemen
 carried a message from "deserter Michael Branch" who encouraged
 GI's to "help bring an end to the war."  LPA on the 13th and
 Liberation Radio the next day carried a letter dated 1 May
 from an alleged group of Americans on "unauthorized leave"
 in Paris to Mme. Nguyen Thi Dints, deputy commander of the
 PLAF, thanking the PLAF for "its open declaration of your
 support for our struggle, inrade and outside the army."
 On the 17th, Liberation Radio broadcast a message from a
 "group of captured GI's in South Vietnam" addressed to
 Senator Fulbright.  It noted his support of the Hatfield-
 McGovern bill, thanked him for his efforts to end the war,
 and offered support of those efforts.  On 11 and 12 May,
 Liberation Radio had carried messages from unnamed prisoners
 to California congressmen and to Senator Hatfield approving
 congressional opposition to the war.
 Hanoi radio's domestic service on the 19th cited UPI as
 reporting that one Betty Alvarez, daughter of an American
 "pilot who was captured in 19614," had made a statement accusing
 President Nixon of using the problem of captured U.S. airmen
 as a pretext to prolong the war.  It stated that she and her
 mother are initiating a movement to unite POW families opposed
 to the President's policies.

 LE DUAN RETURNS HOME AFTER PROLONGED STAY IN USSR, PRC VISIT
 Vietnam Workers Party (VWP) First Secretary Le Duan returned to
 Hanoi on 16 May after a six-week stay in the USSR, where he
 attended the 24th CPSU Congress, and a five-day visit to the
 PRC. He arrived in Peking on 10 May and departed from Canton on
 the 15th after a tour of southern China.
 Some elements in the propaganda surrounding Le Duan's tour seem
 particularly noteworthy against the background of his prolonged
 stay in the Soviet Union and recent developments in Sino-U.S.
 relations.  While Moscow has aired its misgivings over these
 developments, particularly in an Indochina context,* Hanoi has
 maintained its silence in keeping with its care not to offend
 either of its two big allies.
 In describing Brezhnev's meeting with Le Duan on 9 May, the day
 before he left for Peking, TASS used a unique formulation when
 it said the talks had been held in an atmosphere of "complete
 unanimity and cordiality."  It might be conjectured that there
 is indeed "unanimity" between Hanoi and Moscow regarding Peking's
 overtures to Washington but that, given its neutral stance,
 Hanoi would not be likely to say so publicly.  Significantly,
 VNA's account of the talks used the stereotyped characterization
 militant solidarity and fraternal friendship."
 Some passages in Le Duan's speeches in China seemed calculated
 to please his hosts--perhaps as a way of balancing off his
 prolonged sojourn in the USSR.  Speaking at a Peking banquet
 on the 11th, as reported by NCNA, he raised the issue of
 "Asian unity," a line used by both Peking and Pyongyang in the
 past.  After speaking of China's role as the "great rear," he
 said:  "Our front extends from Vietnam to Laos, to Cambodia,
 to China and to Korea; and it is constantly exprnding."  He
 had made no such remark in addressing a 26 March banquet in
 Peking en route to Moscow, although the Chinese had staged
 the event as a show of Asian unity and Chou En-lai had
 sounded the unity theme on that occasion.  Most recently,
 Peking has given the Asian unity line authoritative expression
 in its joint editorial commemorating Mao's 20 May 1970 state-
 ment.  The editorial declares that in the face of "frenzied
 U.S. imperialist aggression in Asia, the people of China,
 Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos have further strengthened
 their revolutionary unity."

 Speaking in Canton on the 15th, Le Duan declared, after noting
 that Kwangtung Province borders on Vietnam:       "There exists a
 profound revolutionary friendship between us.      Both in the
 present struggle against U.S. aggression and for national
 salvation and in the greater struggles in the future, we will
 fight shoulder to shoulder until final victory."
 NLHS PEACE PLAN ENDORSED BY HANOI. MOSCOW: REPORTED BY PEKING
 Hanoi and Front media promptly praise the NLHS' "new proposal,"*
 which provides for an immediate end to all U.S. bombing over
 Laos after which there would be a cease-fire and the "Lao
 parties concerned" would discuss the formation of a provisional
 coalition government and "other problems of mutual concern."
 The proposal is called a "new important peace initiative" in
 a NHAN DAN Commentator article on the 13th and an LPA commentary
 on the loth.  Both echo the NLHS in saying that in the face of
 the "current strained situation in Laos" caused by U.S.
 aggression, the initiative shows the Pathet Lao's good will
 in effcrts to obtain a peaceful settlement on the "basis" of
 the NLHS' 6 March 1970 five-point program.
 The VNA account of the 13 May Paris session says the allied.
 delegates' "fallacious and insolent arguments" were "flatly
 refuted by Xuan Thuy, who condemned the Nixon Administration
 for expanding its war of aggression in Cambodia and Laos.
 He praised the peace initiatives of the Lao Patriotic Front."
 The communist press spokesmen at the post-session briefing
 were unusually forthcoming in elaborating on the NLHS points
 in reply to newsmen's questions.  The DRV spokesman, asked
 whether the cease-fire proposal applies only to the NLHS and
 RLG armed forces or to all troops in Laos, said it applies to
 "all",-the armed forces in Laos.  He stressed that the emphasis
 in the proposal on the demand for a total cessation of U.S.
 bombing over the whole territory of Laos is a point "wortky
 of note."  However, in response to another question he recalled
 that a similar demand appeared in the five points and emphasized
 *  The proposal was reported by VNA and the Pathet Lao news
 agency on 12 May in publicity for a communique on a 26-27 April
 NLHS-Patriotic Neutralist Forces conference.  See the TRENDS
 of 12 May 1971, pages 13-14.

 that the proposals on a cease-fire and talks on a coalition
 government are "new."  He added that they "further clarify"
 the demand in the five points that there must be a bombing
 cessation "in order to create conditions making it possible
 for the interested Lao parties to meet."  A Hanoi radio
 broadcast in English on the 17th summarized the DRV
 spokesman's remarks on the "new" aspects of the NLHS proposal
 but did not mention his comment that the cease-fire would
 apply to "all" troops in Laos.  Hanoi media normally do not
 report the post-session Paris briefings at all.
 Vietnamese communist media have not reported the PRG spokesman's
 comments at the press briefing when he was asked if it was not
 true that "to settle the Lao problem, the South Vietnam problem
 must be settled first."  He replied:  "If peace is restored to
 Laos earlier than in Vietnam, we will also welcome this."  The
 Vietnamese communists are not known previously to have commented
 on the notion of a Laotian settlement preceding a Vietnamese
 one.  The subject did not arise in comment at Paris on the
 NLHS five points in March 1970.  In rejecting President Nixon's
 7 October 1970 proposal on a broad Indochina conference,
 Vietnamese spokesmen had stressed that the problems of the
 three countries should be settled individually, in accordance
 with the peace programs put forward by each, but did not
 indicate the order in which they might be settled.*
 SOUPHANOUVONG LETTER     It was not until the day after the
 TO SOUVANNA PHOUMA       NLHS proposal was released that
 Pathet Lao media reported that it
 had been dispatched to Souvanna Phouma in a letter from
 Soinphanouvong--delivered by special envoy Tiao Souk Vongsak,
 who returned to Vientiane on 8 May.  The text of the letter,
 as released by Vientiane on the 13th, says nothing about
 continued discussion of a meeting between plenipotentiaries
 of the two princes.
 *  At a Paris press conference on 10 April 1970, asked about
 the French cabinet's 1 April suggestion of a broadened
 Indochina conference, Le Duc Tho had said, as reported by
 TASS, that a Vietnam settlement should be the basis of a
 settlement for all of Indochina.

 VIENTIANE-HANOI     The Vietnamese and Laotian communists have
 RELATIONS           predictably ignored Souvanna Phouma's appeal,
 in his 11 May Constitution Day speech, to
 the NLHS to break away from Hanoi's control and negotiate.with
 the RLG.  A DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement and a
 statement by a spokesman of the NLHS Central Committee, protesting
 the stoning of the DRV charge d'affaires' car after he walked
 out on Souvanna Phouma's speech, once again merely vaguely
 accuse Souvanna Phouma of making "slanderous accusations
 against the DRV."
 MOSCOW              TASS promptly reported the new NLHS proposal
 on the 12th, and the next day TASS commentator
 Kharkov praised it as "a new important initiative paving the way
 for a political settlement in Laos."  Asserting that.-.the present
 Laos "tragedy" is caused "exclusively by American intervention,"
 Kharkov said "it is clear that while American air piracy over
 Laos and other forms of armed interference in the affairs of
 this Indochinese state continue, there can be no hope that an
 atmosphere will prevail in which the Laotian sides concerned
 could discuss a peaceful settlement in the country."  Moscow
 broadcasts to Indochinese and domestic audiences have praised
 the proposal in similar terihs.
 This prompt endorsement contrasts with Moscow's initially cautious
 reaction to the NLHS five-point program in March 1970, when
 Soviet media acknowledged the substance of the five points only-
 after several days' delay.  However, the plan was officially
 endorsed by Kosygin in a message to President Nixon--
 summarized by Radio Moscow op 15 March--declining to join
 the President in supporting Souvannas`'houma's proposal for
 consultations among the signers of the Geneva agreement on Laos.
 PEKING             On 15 May NCNA reported that the NLHS-PNF
 joint-communique setting forth the new
 peace proposal was publicized at a 12 May Hanoi press conference
 by a spokesman of the NLHS information office.  NCNA carried
 the text of the proposal but offered no comment.  On the 18th
 NCNA also reported without comment an NLHS Central Committee
 statement on the seventh anniversary of the inception of.U.S.
 bombing of Laos; the statement includes an appeal to world
 peoples and governments to support the new NLHS peace
 proposals.

 The acknowledgment of the existence of a peace plan contrasts
 with Peking-'s reaction to the NLHS five points in March 1970.
 At that time NCNA reported that the NLHS had isouoki a central
 committee statement but omitted all mention of a five-point
 peace program.  Peking has subsequently officially endorsed
 the five points, however; an 8 March 1971 communique on Chou
 En--tai's visit to Hanoi said that the Laotian question should
 be settled in accordance with the five-point program of
 6 March 1970.
 MEDIA NOTE THIEU-KY ELECTION RIVALRY. "BIG" MINH APPEARANCE
 Hanoi and Front media have publicized several items noting
 evidence of a "dispute" between GVN President Nguyen Van Thieu
 and Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky as opposing candidates in
 the October presidential election.  Statements by Ky attacking
 Thieu have been cited, and LPA on 13 May noted Saigon press
 reports on the 11th which quoted Thieu as ruling out the
 possibility of the two men running on the same ticket.
 While publicizing Ky's criticism of Thieu, the media make it
 clear that the Vietnamese communists regard the vice president
 as no different than Thieu, describing both men as "running
 dogs of the U.S. imperialists."  A Hanoi radio commentary,
 broadcast in Vietnamese to South Vietnam on 13 May, cited
 statements by Ky critical of the Saigon regime and then
 went on to explain that Ky wanted to place the blame for
 the "rottenness" of the administration on Thieu and to
 represent himself as a patriot. In fact, the commentary
 claimed, "everyone knows that both Thieu and Ky are ugly
 traitors" who have incurred "a blood debt" to the South
 Vietnamese peop:.e and that they are now denouncing each
 other "because each wants to be the number one lackey of
 the Americans."
 The rivalry between Thieu and Ky was also discussed in a
 Liberation Radio commentary on 14 May which quoted AFP as
 reporting on the 13th that Thieu had prevented Ky from
 delivering a planned address at a meeting in a Saigon
 cinema.

 The other potential presidential candidate, Duong Van ("Big")
 Minh, has not been criticized by Vietnamese communist media,
 and references to him by Hanoi and the Front seem calculated
 to cast him in a favorable light.  Thus LPA items on the
 10th and 17th, in reporting 9 May ceremonies at the An Quang
 Pagoda marking Buddha's birthday, noted a speaker's calls for
 peace and criticism of GVN?policies and added gratuitously
 that "retired general" Duong Van Minh was present at the
 ceremony.  Monitored Hanoi and Front broadcasts in Vietnamese
 made no mention of Minh's presence at the ceremony, and the
 LPA reports did not note that Minh has been mentioned as a
 possible presidential candidate.  An article broadcast by
 Liberation Radio last February did directly discuss the
 effect of Minh's potential candidacy on President Thieu.*

 SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS
 MOSCOW SEEKS TO DISCREDIT CURRENT CHINESE POLICIES
 While Moscow continues to show restraint in commenting on recent
 Sino-U.S. developments, Soviet apprehensions over prospects of
 enhanced Chinese influence are reflected in efforts to arouse
 suspicion regarding Peking's motives and U.S. intentions,
 especially in the Indochinese context.  A recurrent refrain is
 that Washington is linking its hopes for realizing its aims in
 Vietnam with Peking's policies.  Though the Soviets have been
 careful to attribute this view to American observers, the
 manner in which it has been aired in Soviet media suggests a
 calculated campaign to play on fears among the Indochinese
 over a Sino-U.S. accommodation at their expense.*
 Moscow has refrained from commenting on Sino-U.S. relations in the
 central daily press, relying mainly on the foreign-affairs
 weekly NEW TIMES and LITERARY GAZETTE to convey its views.
 Undoubtedly discomfited by Peking's success in projecting a
 more reasonable and accommodating image after the excesses
 of the cultural revolution, the Soviets have countered by
 calling attention to less pleasing features of Chinese life
 today as well as to vulnerable aspects of Peking's foreign
 relations.  Thus, LITERARY GAZETTE on 5 May carried the first
 of a series of eyewitness articles by "Soviet diplomat
 D. Karpil" on "China After the Cultural Revolution" depicting
 a bleak way of life marked by pervasive militarism and Maoist
 idolatry.  Commenting that "a fact is a fact--China is
 preparing for war," the article warns that for the Chinese
 to launch a war would be "a fatal adventure" for them.  The
 article was given wide dissemination in the Soviet provincial
 press.
 *  Hanoi has remained silent on the visit of American sportsmen
 and journalists to the PRC.  Against this background, an attempt
 by the Soviets to strengthen their hand with the Vietnamese may
 have been reflected in Moscow's unprecedented characterization
 of Brezhnev's talks with Le Duan as having taken place in an
 atmosphere of "unanimity."  See the Indochina section of this

 The second in the Karpi.l series, carried in LITERARY GAZETTE
 on 12 May, portrays discontent, uncertainty, and disarray in
 the Chinese educational system today.  The militarist theme
 again appears, Karpil observing that the reduction in the
 length of education was designed to free resources for the
 development of the war industry,  The third article, on the
 19th, deals with Chinese agriculture, "the most acute problem
 in China today."
 That the Soviets are smarting over the favorable publicity
 being given to the Chinese in the world press is reflected
 in an article in NEW TIMES No. 20 (14 May) taking scornful
 exception to recent British and West German articles.  NEW
 TIMES takes a particularly sharp slap at the Chinese lcadership,
 terming the cultural revolution a case of "unbridled gleat-
 power chauvinism" directed by "the Mao Tse-tung group against
 the CCP''--a strong polemical formulation that has appeared
 only rarely in Soviet comment in the past year.  Seeking to
 discredit the stream of noncommunist visitors to China
 recently, the article takes special note of the visit by
 Klaus Mehnert, whose presence the Chinese did not see fit to
 acknowledge publicly.  NEW TIMES describes Mehnert as a
 former Nazi intelligence agent who is "an inveterate anti-
 Soviet" author,                              Ac^ording t.c NEW TIMES, his purpose in
 going to China was to gather material for a book in which
 he intends to praise the cultural revolution.  "Of course,
 no comment is necessary," the article concludes.
 In a striking sign of Soviet discomfort over Sino-U.S.
 developments, an article in NEW TIMES No. 19 went so far
 as to raise the specter of an "encirclement" of the USSR.
 Signed "D.V."--presumably Associate Editor D. Volskiy, who
 contributed an ar;:icle to the previous issue disparaging
 Peking's stand on Cambodia--the article quotes a Canadian
 journalist as discerning "breathtaking possibilities inherent
 in the new turn in U.S.-Chinese relations."  As outlined by
 NEW TIMES, these possibilities relate to a rapprochement
 between the PRC and the United States which would permit each
 side to concentrate its strength against the Soviets; thus,
 American power could be redeployed from Asia to areas like
 Europe and the Mediterranean to confront the Soviet Union,
 while Chinese forces now tied down by American power could
 be arrayed along the Sino-Soviet border.  "What is this,"
 NEW TIMES asks rhetorically, "if not a revival of the old plan
 to encircle the Soviet Union and the socialist community?"

 Moscow has generally avoided the sensitive border question in
 discussing the implications of Sino-U.S. relations, but this
 issue also figured in a Mandarin broadcast on 5 May which
 explained how Washington counts on Chinese passivity toward
 the war in Indochina.  According to the broadcast, the U.S.
 calculation is supported by information from U.S. reconnaissance
 satellites showing Chinese missiles deployed in the north
 against the Soviet Union rather than in China's south, "the
 direction of actual threat."
 INDOCHINA     The tone having been set by the wide-ranging
 Kirichenko article in NEW TIMES No. 17 on "Peking's
 Diplomatic Game,"* Moscow has made a point of linking recent
 Sino-U.S. developments with Peking's stand on Indochina.
 Rejecting the suggestion that Peking is engaged in a complex
 diplomatic game, Kirichenko saw the situation in stark terms.
 He made use of "the Vietnamese proverb" that "you can't hide
 an elephant in a basket" to lead into a harsh attack on the
 Chinese for easily betraying friends and alining-themselves with
 "those whom they have just been calling enemies."
 Moscow's tactic was illustrated by a 28 April LITERARY GAZETTE
 article rounding up foreign press reports following the exercise
 in "ping-pong diplomacy."  The article juxtaposed a section
 headed "Great Expectations"--the Nixon Administration's hopes
 for using Chinese influence in behalf of its Vietnam policies--
 with a section headed "But Meanwhile . . ." containing reports
 on wilitary operations in Indochina.  It concluded by quoting
 an Indian paper's observation that the friendliness shown toward
 "the American government, which is destroying thousands of people
 in Vietnam, shows that the verbal facade of the Chinese leader-'
 ship is simply a disguise for its real intentions."
 A similar point was made in D. Volskiy's article on Cambodia in
 NEW TIMES No. 18.  According to Volskiy, new calculations based
 on Chinese reactions emerged in U.S. strategy in Indochina
 after the incursion into Cambodia.  Volskiy claimed that
 declarations like Mao's 20 May statement last year "proved to
 be merely propaganda maneuvers dictated by Peking's hegemonist
 aspirations."  Significantly, in addition to Mao's statement
 Volskiy singled out the Chinese pledge to take all necessary

 steps even to the point of "the greatest national sacrifices"
 as among these empty declarations.  This pledge, made during
 Chou En-lei's visit to the DRV in early March and repeated in
 an editorial on the visit, has disappeared from Chinese
 statements or support for the Indochinese.  Vietnamese and
 Korean spokesmen, on the other hand, have seen fit to remind
 the Chinese of their pledge in speeches made in Peking subsequent
 to the visit of the American table tennis team to the PRC.
 Apprehensiveness about Peking's place in Vietnam's future was
 reflected in a Lugovskiy article in NEW TIMES No. 19 discussing
 Secretary Rogers' appeal at the recent SEATO session for the
 PRC to play a constructive role in Southeast Asia.  Contrasting
 the Secretary's remarks with previous U.S. declarations calling
 for containment of China, Lugovskiy viewed with suspicion the
 way in which the question of Sino-U.S. relations was raised in
 connection with Vietnam.  Lugovskiy concluded this discussion
 by striking a familiar note in current Soviet comment, citing
 American observers as believing that "Washington is linking
 with the Peking leadership's policy its hopes of-.-achieving
 the aims in whose name the United States has been fighting
 unsuccessfully in Vietnam for many years."
 TAIWAN     PRAVDA on the 7th carried a TASS account of the 4 May
 PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator artt61e:-rebutting a U.S.
 State Department spokesman's.statement.that sovereignty over
 Taiwan remains an open question.  In carrying the account Moscow
 managed both to call attention to a tough issue complicating
 Sino-U.S. relations and to show Soviet solidarity with another
 communist country on an international question.  In recent
 months both Moscow and Peking have selectively-reported one
 another's statements on such questions.
 A Moscow broadcast in Mandarin on the 7th pointed out, in
 connection with the PRAVDA report, that the Soviets have
 consistently opposed the two-Chinas formula and have voted
 for seating the PRC in the United Nations and expelling the
 Nationalist delegation.  By implication,, Moscow is putting
 the onus on Peking for any compromise on this question.
 Moscow's account of the PEOPLE'S DAILY article cites its
 reference to the Cairo and Potsdam declarations as awarding
 Taiwan to China.  In citing these declarations Moscow may have
 been seeking to buttress its own position in the dispute with
 Japan over the "northern territories" awarded to the Soviet
 Union as part of the World War. II settlement based on these
 declarations.

 of his successor; the further ministerial and ASU resignations
 subsequently announced by Cairo that day--including War
 Minister Fawzi, Presidential Affairs Minister Sami Sharaf,
 Information Minister Fa'iq, and ASU officials an-Nur, Dawud,
 and Shuqayr--were reported by TASS and Moscow radio on the
 14th.  In reporting the announcement of the new cabinet on
 the 14th, TASS listed the prime minister and the four deputy
 prime ministers without mentioning that all but one deputy
 prime minister, concurrently appointed to the information
 post, are holdovers from the previous cabinet.*  But the TASS
 account did pointedly note that ash-Shafi'i "is again"
 appointed vice president, as if to underline the absence in
 this cabinet of 'Ali Sabri.
 In a two-s? ztence report on as-Sadat's 14.May radio and
 television address to the nation detailing what he called
 a planned coup d'etat, TASS that day merely quoted him as
 stating that the resignation of leading ASU officials and
 some ministers was caused "in the first place" by their
 opposition to the establishment of the Federation of Arab
 Republics (FAR).**  TASS additionally noted that as-Sadat
 proposed to hold new ASU elections.  Echoing the TASS account,
 *  #iCNA on 18 May, giving a factual account of the major
 resignations and appointments, did note that the prime
 minister and three of the four deputy prime ministers
 retained their posts.
 ** Moscow has apparently failed to mention as-Sadat's
 joint meeting on the loth with leaders of the other two
 FAR states, Syria and Libya, as well as an-Numayri of
 Sudan, linked with the other three countries in the Tripoli
 Charter.

 a Koryavin dispatch in IZVESTIYA on the 16th also mentioned
 that as-Sadat, touching on the Middle East crisis, affirmed
 that the UAR would seek a political settlement.
 An 18 May TASS report on the situation for the first time
 suggests the extent of the changes in reporting that the
 resigned officials have been put u_.der arrest and that a
 number of dismissals and new appointments have been effected
 in some ministries and departments, including the information
 ministry and the security service.  Citing an AL-AHRAM report
 that as-Sadat has agreed to become supreme commissioner of
 the UAR police, TASS adds that the same paper said 110 people
 have been arrested on charges of "actions 'aimed against the
 interests of the people.'"
 BREZHNEV     Brezhnev declared in his 14 May Tbilisi speech
 SPEECH       that the UAR, Syria, and other Arab states,
 "rallying together all patriotic progressive
 forces within their national and the general Arab framework,"
 strengthening fraternal cooperation with the socialist coun-
 tries, and giving a "resolute rebuff to the blackmail and
 outbursts of imperialism," will triumph in their just cause.
 His remarks seem to be a departure from the conventional
 Soviet propaganda appeal for Arab unity, typified in Podgornyy
 and Kosygin's call for the "strengthening of unity of the
 Arab countries and peoples" in their December 1969 message
 to the fifth Are_b summit conference in Rabat.  It is unclear
 what Brezhnev had in mind in referring to "patriotic
 progressive forces" and in specifying "national" as well
 as general Arab solidarity.  He may have been intimating
 concern over the fall from power of Egyptian leaders commonly
 thought to be favored by Moscow.  Or, in a broader context,
 he may have been alluding to the FAR, which has been supported
 by the Syrian CP, while the Sudanese CP has opposed Sudan's
 membership in the federation.  The Sudanese regime, in turn,
 has been the target of protests by the Jordanian, Iraqi,
 Syrian, and Lebanese CPs for attacking the Sudanese communists.
 Brezhnev's speech was cited by a "responsible official source,"
 quoted in a dispatch from Moscow published in AL-AHRAM, as
 reported by DPA from Cairo on the 16th.  The source is said
 to have declared that the USSR considers the governmental
 changes in Cairo as an internal matter concerning the UAR
 alone.  The source further is quoted as saying, according to
 DPA, that the USSR is anxious to strengthen friendship and

 cooperation with the UAR--a view that Brezhnev, the source
 claimed, expressed in his Tbilisi speech when he said the
 USSR would continue to support the Arabs' struggle.
 LEBANESE CP     The Lebanese CP daily AN-NIDA's concern over
 CRITICISM       the events in Egypt is reported on the 17th
 in an East Berlin radio commentary which says
 the paper points out that following Secretary Rogers' visit,
 "certain circles on the Nile" are concentrating on appeals to
 end the confrontation with the United States, going so far
 "in their subservience" as to glorify the United States as
 the only force capable of resolving the Middle East crisis.
 According to an IRAQI NEWS AGENCY account on the 15th,
 AN-NIDA does not find the Egyptian Ettuation reassuring
 in that it might weaken the UAR position in confronting
 the "imperialist-Zionist occupation and aggression."  The
 purpose behind the Egyptian developments, AN-NIDA claims,
 is to appease the United States and to establish moderate
 forces capable of reaching an understanding with-it, as well
 as to make further concessions to liquidate all the gains of
 the Arab liberation movement.

 FORCES  IN EUROPE
 BREZF,NEV, KOSYGIN VOICE INTEREST IN TALKS ON FORCE LEVELS
 Brezhnev used'his speech in Tbilisi on 14 May to put new focus
 on the proposal for reduction of armed forces and armaments in
 Central Europe that he had brought up briefly, as one ingredient
 in a potpourri of long-standing disarmament measures, in his
 30 March report to the 24th CPSU Congress.  The formulation in
 the 30 March report diverged from the usual pattern by failing
 to specify "foreign" armed forces.  Now singling out the force-
 reduction proposal in the Tbilisi speech., Brezhnev noted that
 NATO spokesmen were asking whether the 30 March proposal
 concerns foreign or national forces, nuclear or conventional
 arms, and challenged them to clarify the issue by "starting
 negotiations" on this question.
 Kosygin also broached the subject of troop and arms reduction
 on 18 May, at a luncheon in Moscow honoring Canadian Prime
 Minister Trudeau, but in terms of the old formulation
 stipulating foreign forces.  In his remarks as summarized by
 TASS, he did not allude +o Brezhnev's Tbilisi speech, nor
 did he specify Central Europe.  He took note of "animated"
 discussions in the West on troop and arms reductions in Europe,
 particularly on the possibility of reducing the strength of
 "foreign" troops, and observed that "if the West displays
 readiness to take practical steps in this direction, we will
 do everything possible to reach agreement."*
 Available follow-up propaganda on Brezhnev's Tbilisi speech--
 confined largely to reportage--repeats his formula leaving open
 the possibility that a reduction of national as well as foreign
 troops     be negotiable.  PRAVDA on the 15th and IZVESTIYA
 the following day carried roundups of favorable reaction to
 Brezhnev's remarks on troop reduction, including U.S. reaction.
 *  Kosygin had repeated the language of Brezhnev's 30 March
 report almost verbatim at a 21 April luncheon for the visiting
 Finnish Prime Minister Karjalainen:  On that occasion, he.
 indicated readiness "to cut back armed forces and armaments
 in the regions where military opposition is particularly
 dangerous, above all in Central Europe."

 19 MAY 197).
 The PRAVDA roundup quoted Senator Mansfield to the effect that
 Brezhnev had advanced "a very good proposal"; and a domestic
 service report on the 17th, on the Senate debate on the
 Mansfield proposal for halving U.S. troop strength in Europe,
 said the Senator was the first American political figure to
 welcome Brezhnev's remarks.  A foreign-language talk by
 Glazunov on the 18th described Washington's reaction to the
 Soviet proposal as "more or less positive" but declared that
 Secretary Rogers was less than forthcoming in his 16 May remarks
 on'4eet the Press'when he indicated "that Washington wants to
 know what the results will be even before starting the talks."
 Glazunov noted that Rogers indicated he would take up the Soviet
 proposal with Washtngtca's allies at the NATO Council session
 in Lisbon in early June.
 Moscow has not yet been heard to mention Ambassador Beams
 17 May meeting with Foreign Minister Gronyko at which they
 rep.rtedly discussed the Brezhnev proposal.  A RED STAR article
 reviewed by TASS on the 19th complains that the United States
 "has not responded so far" to the proposal.
 BACKGROUND        In line with the Central Committee report to the
 CPSU congress, neither Brezhnev in Tbilisi nor
 Kosygin in Moscow treated the force-reduction issue in the
 context of a European security conference.  Long on record in
 favor of "foreign" troop cuts in Central Europe, Moscow has
 customarily placed the matter in a European security framework
 in recent years.  In apparent response to the recurring NATO
 proposal for mutual and balanced force reductions, the memorandum
 of the 21-22 June 1970 meeting of Warsaw Pact foreign ministers
 in Budapest had suggested a means of discussing the matter in
 that framework.`  It proposed that a European security conference
 discuss "the establishment of a body concerned with questions of
 European security and cooperation," adding that in the Pact
 *  The NATO proposal for mutual and balanced force reductions in
 Europe has long been under fire from the Soviet Union.  Among
 other arguments, Moscow has contended that the question is an
 interbloc matter better suited for discussion at the Geneva
 disarmament talks than as an agenda item at a European security
 conference.  Propaganda has also argued against the NATO proposal
 that Soviet forces be cut by 30 percent while NATO forces be cut
 by only 10 percent.  For a fuller discussion, see the TRENDS of
 1 July 1970, pages 26-27, and 3 June 1970, pages 18-19.

 members' view "it would help to lessen tension and promote
 security in Europe if the reduction of foreign armed forces
 on the territory of European states were discussed," either
 in the newly proposed permament body "or in other ways
 acceptable to the states concerned."
 While more recent propaganda has not referred directly to the
 Pact proposal for a permament body and the possible discussion
 of force cuts in that forum, Moscow continues to point to
 alleged wide support for the agenda outlined by the Soviet
 bloc states.  For example, a Dmitriyev article in PRAVDA on
 11 May said that an understanding regarding the participants in
 a European security conference as well as its venue has been
 achieved by joint efforts, and "in essence there are no
 objections to the agenda proposed by the socialist states."
 MANSFIELD AMENDMENT;  STRESS ON ADMINISTRATION OPPOSITION
 A flurry of Soviet press and radio propaganda in the past week
 has hailed Senator Mansfield's 11 May proposal--in the form of
 an amendment to a bill to extend the draft--to halve the number
 of U.S. troops in Europe by the end of 1971.  According to TASS
 on the 18th, the Mansfield proposal enlists the support of "all
 progressive forces" who advocate abandonment of "the obsolete
 'cold war' principles," liquidation of NATO, and the reduction
 of U.S. military expenditures, expenditures which have led to
 "serious socio-economic and financial difficulties."
 At the same time, the propaganda predictably assails Administra-
 tion efforts to "torpedo" the initiative.  TASS on the 16th said
 President Nixon has decided to intervene personally in the
 "acute struggle" over the proposal, and a domestic service
 broadcast the following day reported that the President has
 called together "cold war experts" to drum up support for
 the Administration position.  In the words of the broadcast.,
 former Secretary of State Acheson "and other has-beens" have
 hen asked to defend an outdated policy.  The same broadcast
 cited newsmen for the observation that the President will go
 so far as to veto the bill if his Senate supporters cannot
 block the Mansfield amendment.
 ! 16 May dispatch in PRAVDA on the Senate debate reported that
 a State Department spokesman claimed that a reduction of U.S.
 troops in Europe would "harm negotiations concerned essentially

 with a genuine, balanced, and reciprocal reduction in the
 numbers of armed forces."  The spokesman went on to say,
 according to PRAVDA, that "it would be tragic if our country
 were to be deprived of its trump card at a time when the
 Soviet leadership is expressing renewed interest in a balanced
 and reciprocal reduction" in the armed forces in Europe.

 FRG-CZECP0SL0VAKIA
 "FRANK" EXCHANGE MARKS SECOND ROUND OF BILATERAL TALKS
 Prague media's report of the communique on the second round 'of
 Czechoslovak-FRG exploratory talks, held 13-14 May in Bonn,
 reflects evident lack of progress toward a compromise formula
 on the invalidity of the Munich Agreement--the chief obstacle
 to the inception of formal negotiations on the normalization
 of relations. CTK reports the communique as saying that the
 talks were "frank and to the point and contributed to a mutual
 clarification of views."  The CTK report registers, in lower
 key, essentially the same appraisal conveyed by the Bonn
 representative, FRG State Secretary Frank, on West German TV
 on the 14th.  In remarks unacknowledged by Prague media,
 Frank said the two sides presented their positions "with all
 objective harshness and all necessary precision" and made
 no progress.  They did agree to continue the talks, the
 communique noting that the third round will be held in
 Prague.  .
 Prague media have refrained since the inception of the
 exploratory talks from spelling out the Czechoslovak
 position, repeatedly and insistently aired in comment prior
 to the first round, that Bonn must recognize the Munich
 Agreement as invalid ab initio and must accept "all the
 consequences ensuing therefrom" before formal negotiations
 on normalizing relations can begin.  But a brief Prague
 domestic service commentary on the eve of the second
 round seemed designed as assurance that the Czechoslovak
 side would stand firm on this position.  Complaining
 that certain "rightwing" West German weeklies had
 failed to go along with the "reserved" treatment of
 Czechoslovak-FRG relations in the rest of the FRG press,
 the 12 May commentary rejected the suggestion of the
 FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE's Prague correspondent that
 Czechoslovakia is prepared to show "a certain magnanimity"
 on the Munich agreement issue.
 In Prague media's only other commentary on the talks in the
 interval between the first round at the end of March and
 the second, a domestic radio commentary on 24 April had
 denied charges by another "rightwing" West German weekly,
 DER SPIEGEL, that the Czechoslovak side had been inadequately

 prepared for the initial round of the talks.*       There has been
 no discussion of the talks in the Czechoslovak central press
 since before the first round.
 The Czechoslovaks did, however, use the 9 May 26th anniversary
 of the Red Army's liberation of Czechoslovakia and the 6 May
 first anniversary of the signing of the new Czechoslovak-Soviet
 friendship treaty to underscore their stock position on the
 Munich Agreement.  First Secretary Husak, in a RUDE PRAVO
 article on the 6th, expressed appreciation to the USSR and
 "othor allies" for their support of Czechoslovakia's "Just
 demand that the Munich Agreement be recognized as invalid ab
 initio."  And in IZVESTIYA on 9 May, CPCZ Presidium Ccididate
 riember and Federal Assembly Chairman Hanes repeated the formula
 in welcoming the support expressed by Brezhnev at the 24th
 CPSU Congress for Czechoslovakia's "Just demand that the
 Munich Agreement be recognized as invalid ab initio"--again,
 as in Husak's RUDE PRAVO article, stopping short of tying
 the issue to the Prague-Bonn talks.

 communique on the one-day visit of a GDR
 party-government delegation led by Honecker and Stoph to

 Munich Agreement, the communique stated that the USSR and
 GDR "assessed as a positive event in European life the
 meetings between Czechoslovak and FRG representatives at
 which the question of the invalidity ab initio of the Munich
 Agreement was raised."

 SLOVAK PARTY CONGRESS
 Bolstered by a strong Soviet endorsement of the success of his
 leadership, Czechoslovak Communist Party First Secretary Husak
 delivered a confident, relaxed speech at the 14 May session of
 the Slovak CP congress, naming names as he drew closer to the
 conservative wing of the party and heaped scorn on the libe.alsd
 The 13 May message from the CPSU Central Committee on the CPCZ's
 50th anniversary had credited the Czechoslovak party with having
 "achieved normalization of the situation" in the country--in
 agreement with the identical claim made the same day in a PRAVDA
 article on the anniversary by Husak.
 Husak recallod blandly at the Slovak congress that "in 1968 anel
 later there was a lot of commotion in connection with our
 fraternal relations with the Soviet Union and the other allied
 socialist states."  He added that "we cleared things up and
 put them in the right place, and with frank words we expressed
 our views on this subject."  He went on to declare anew that
 Czechoslovakia's "existence" and sovereignty are "guaranteed"
 by the USSR and its allies and that he would continue repeating
 this standpoint "until the last citizen of our state understands
 this fundamental truth."  He derided the "bourgeois propaganda"
 view--"and they say this with tears in their eyes"--that the
 CSSR is "some sort of cecupied country" run by "collaborators or
 agents."
 LFNART, HUSAK SET LINE ON 1968 "EXTRAORDINARY" CONGRESS
 The manner in which the forthcoming CPCZ congress will deal
 with the discredited Vysocany congress of 22 August 1968, the
 "extraordinary 14th congress of the CPCZ" held in secret the
 day after the invasion, was anticipated at the Slovak congress.*

 As an event of purely domestic import, it was not attended by
 any notable foreign guests.

 be held since 1966 and avoided any allusion to the "extraordinary"
 Slovak congress which met in Bratislava 26-29 August 1968 and
 endorsed the Vysocany congress.
 The history of the 1968 Slovak gathering contains clear elements
 of potential embarrassment to Husak.  Arriving in Bratislava
 from Moscow for the "extraordinary" Slovak party session on
 27 August 1968, Husak strongly urged the Slovak party to accept
 the "honorable" Moscow settlement but identified his own stand
 with that of Dubcek, among others, in the "frank" talks which
 had preceded that settlement.  The 1968 congress named Husak
 Slovak CP first secretary in place of the ultraconservative
 Vasil Bilak, then and now a favorite of the Sovi3ts.
 At the current Slovak congress the problem of how to treat the
 1968 congress, and specifically how to exculpate Husak, was
 worked out in the report delivered by Slovak CP First Secretary
 Jozef Lenart at the 13 May opening session.  Lenart divided the
 1968 Slovak congress into an "anti-Marxist-Leninist first part"
 and a "principled second part" which started with Husak's
 arrival at the congress from Moscow.  This formula, subsequently
 incorporated in the congress' final resolution on the 15th,
 was followed in Lenart's report by a ringing endorsement of
 Husak:  "In April 1969 a comrade was elected as Central
 Committee First Secretary who did most for the defeat of the
 right wing and for leading us out of the crisis--that was and is
 Comrade Husak."  Lenart hailed the August 1968 invasion at two
 separate points in his report, delivered before a demonstratively
 pro-Soviet audience, and recalled Husak's remarks at the 24th
 CPSU Congress expressing "sincere thanks" for the intervention.
 Addressing the Slovak conclave, Husak wondered aloud whether
 "one should laugh" at the recent manifesto issued by liberal
 emigres Goldstuecker, Pelikan, and Sik which contended that the
 true loth Congress of the CPCZ is the 1968 Vysocany congress,
 not the 14th CPCZ Congress scheduled to open on 25 May.  He
 recalled that the 1968 Slovak CP congress--after his arrival
 there from Moscow--had "rejected the petit bourgeois, counter-
 revolutionary coup against our party," the Vysocany congress.
 Deploying a crudeness he had not previously used against the
 liberals, he quoted from a book a line to the effect that "if the
 devil cannot harm you, he at least leaves a smell" and belabored
 the point by adding that "those Goldstueckers, those Pelikans,
 they cannot harm ius, so at least they make a smell."

 HUSAK EULOGIZES CONSERVATIVE BILAK WHILE SNIPING AT NOVOTNY
 Registering his growing affinity for the conservative elements
 among the Czechoslovak communists, Husak paid warm personal
 tribute to Bilak, his predecessor as Slovak CP first secretary,
 a CPCZ Presidium member from April 1968 to the present, and a
 CPCZ secretary as well since November 1968.  He recalled that
 Bilak, as Slovak party head, resisted "the growing rightwing
 and revisionist attack" in the pry.-August 1968 period.  As a
 result, Husak said, "a fair number of people blackened his name
 and spat upon his human and communist '^onor," despite Husak's
 own "mar.v interventions" in getting Bilak elected to the new
 Slov'      Central Committee at the 1968 congress.  Declaring
 that        arty can he proud of such a proletarian fellow,"
 Husaa        that "if some people are speculating on any
 diffe.     a" between him and Bilak, they should be advised
 that "   'rade Bilak . . . is one of the closest and most
 princi,    iinded coworkers I know in the party leadership."
 The pr,    us day, Lenart had put in a similar plug for Bilak's
 op;~,-)sition to "antisocialist trends and revisionism" in the
 Slovak party in the pre-invasion period.
 At the same time, promoting his image in the Slovak part of the
 country, Husak took several swipes at Antonin Novotny, the arch
 villain in Slovak eyes who allegedly held back Slovakia's
 development Into a modern industrialized region.  In the course
 of a lengthy attack on young writers opposed to his leadership,
 Husak remarked sarcastically that "Novotny played cards with
 them, so these writers were great," adding:  "Recently I have
 heard that some people from this sphere. say that things are
 worse than under Novotny."  He also indicted Novotny in
 connection with the problem of Slovak nationalism, recalling
 that "several people--Novotny, Bacilek, and various other
 political corpses, as we may call them today"--showed lack of
 understanding and insensitivity to the problem cf Slovak national
 pride, now "solved" through the federative system.
 Having thus dissociated himself from some of the derelictions of
 the Novotny era, Husak went on to warn of the new responsibilities
 incumbent upon the Slovaks under the federation, remarking that
 "you can no longer blame Novotny" if something goes wrong in
 Slovakia today.  In this connection he in effect further downgraded
 the federative setup, as Lenart had done the day before, stressing
 the primacy of "a united Czechoslovak awareness, based on our
 socialist system" and patterned on the Soviet concept of the
 multinational state.

 PRC  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 NEW PARTY COMMITTEES ANNOUNCED FOR KWEICWOW AND SINKIANG
 Ending a one-month hiatus when no new provincial-level party
 organ was reported, NCNA on 17 May announced the formation of
 new committees for Kweichow and Sinkiang.  The namelists for
 the new committees contained no surprises, with present local
 leaders taking over the top party posts.  Of the PRC's 29
 provincial-level adminictrative divisions, 21 have now set up
 new committees.
 KWEIYANG RADIO       The formation of a party committee for
 GREETS COMMITTEE     Kweichow has apparently eased the factional
 problems which have long troubled the
 province.  On 18 May Kweiyang radio ended its 20-month solid
 relay of Peking Radio and announced a summer broadcast schedule
 that includes local newscasts.  Among the political originations.
 broadcast the same day was a KWEICHOW DAILY editorial welcoming
 formation of the new provincial committee.  Kweiyang radio had
 ceased broadcasting locally originated material on 30 September
 1969.  Now only Szechwan and Inner Mongolia, both without
 provincial party committees, remain awkwardly silent, with no
 local broadcasts.
 Highlighting Mao's leadership of the CCP, the Kweichow party
 congress was held in Tsunyi--site of the 1935 conference which
 placed Mao in control of the party--rather than the provincial
 capital located at Kweiyang.  With one other exception, all
 previous provincial party committees were established by local
 congresses convened in their respective capital cities.  The
 Shensi party congrczs met in Yenan, Mao's former revolutionary
 base, rather than the provincial capital of Sian.
 The Tsunyi congress, meeting from 7 to 14 May, was attended by
 812 delegates, who selected the 72 full and 15 alternate members
 on the new committee.  A five-man leadership group made up of
 two civilians and three military men heads the new committee.
 Lan Yi-nung, Kweichow's leading figure for the past year, was
 named first secretary.  Although Lan has never been formally
 identified as chairman of the revolutionary committee, actual
 control. of the province devolved on him shortly after chairman
 Li Tsai-han dropped from public view in 1969.  Early in 1970,

 Lan was transferrel to Kweiohow from Szechwan where he had
 served as a utanding member of the revolutionary committee.
 During local National Day rallies in October 1970, Lan was
 listed first among Kweichow leaders.
 Chang Jung-sen, a military man with responsibilities Within the
 Kweichow Military District (MD), was named secretary.  Chia
 Ting-san, Li Li, and Ho Kuang-yu were named deputy secretaries.
 Chia, a newcomer to the province, is a senior cadre with
 several years of previous experience on the old Peking party
 committee.  Li Li, vice-chairman of the revolutionary committee
 and pre-Cultural Revolution governor of Kweichow, is the sole
 named survivor of the group that headed the early "model"
 Kweichow Revolutionary Committee, formed in February 1967.
 Ho Kuang-yu, longtime commander of the Kweichow MD, has been
 identified as a vice-chairman of the revolutionary committee
 since 1969; he was involved in the January 1967 rebel effort
 to "seize power" in Kweichow.
 Lan's keynote address to the congress appla'ided the greater
 unity which he claimed has been achieved within the province
 between the army, government, and people over the past year.
 He called for intensifying the serious study os' Mao's works
 so that "senior and middle cadres" can protect themselves from
 "sham-Marxist political swindlers."
 SINKIANG      The Sinkiang committee.was formed by 725 party
 COWITTEE      delegates meeting in Urumchi from 7.to 11.May.
 A five-man leadership group  heads the new
 committee consisting of 67 full and 23 alternate members.
 The top spot on the committee went to Lung Shu-chin, chairman
 of the revolutionary committee and commander of the Sinkiang
 Military Region (MR).  Saifudin, vice-chairman of the
 revolutionary committee and deputy commander of the Sinkiang.MR,
 was named second secretary.  Tsao Ssu-ming, believed to hold
 local military responsibilities, was named a secretary.  Sung
 Chin-ho and Liu Hsing, vice-chairmen of the revolutionary
 committee, were also named secretaries.
 Both Lung and Saifudin addressed the Urumchi congress.  Lung
 called for strengthening border defenses within Sinkiang--"an.
 outpost in the anti-imperialist and antirevisionist struggle."
 Stressing themes also contained in the keynote addresses of the
 other border provinces with new committees, Lung linked the

 need to improve militia work with criticism of "social-imperialism"
 for carrying "out subversive activities and armed provocations in
 Sinkiang on many occasions."
 Saifudin, governor of Sinkiang from 1955 to 1967 and long the
 most important Uighur in the CCP, actually delivered two
 speeches to the Congress, according to the NCNA account.  At the
 opening ceremony, he conveyed Mao's "kind attention and er. )urage-
 ment" to the people of Sinkiang, and subsequently "on behalf of
 the regional party committee" he urged a struggle for "new victories
 in both revolution and production."  Perhaps he is to maintain de
 facto control over the new party committee, from his position as
 second secretary.
 HOPEI CONNIITTEE    Hopei appears a likely candidate for a party
 IN OFFING           committee in the not too distant future.  On
 13 May the provincial radio broadcast a HOPEI
 DAILY editorial on democratic centralism which claimed new party
 committees for the "overwhelming majority of basic units and
 counties" within the province.  Similar claims were issued
 previously by several provinces just before their new committees
 were announced.
 PROPAGANDA REFLECTS LEADERSHIP PROBLEMS AT THE TOP
 Current articles in Chinese media attacking "reactionary
 fallacies" may well be an offshoot of dissensions surrounding
 the long-absent Chen Po-ta and Kang Sheng.  A HOPEI DAILY
 editorial on 13 May provided one of the clearest indications of
 top-level disharmony in the wake of the cultural revolution with
 an attack on "Liu Shao-chi and other swindlers," a formula now
 used with increasing frequency.  It is alleged that these
 swindlers have "constantly undermined" proletarian centralism,
 enlisted turncoats, "formed cliques to pursue their own interests,
 and created an independent kingdom in an attempt to resist the
 CCP Central Committee" under Mao and Lin.  The current campaign
 does not seem to be merely a revival of anti-Liu attacks, and it
 is presumably related to criticism of the "May 16 group,"
 reported in non-media sources.
 The central media's failure, to. observe, the fifth anniversary of-the
 16 May'diredtive of theCCP Central,7Committee;'cfbll6wing extensive
 praise for the fifth anniversary of Mao's 7 May directive, lends
 support to the supposition that Kang Sheng continues to be in

 serious trouble.  Kang was mentioned in the 16 May directive as
 the only good member of the original cultural revolution "group
 of five."
 Articles on philosophy written during the past winter and spring
 as part of the cadre reeducation campaign have generally.been
 vague, with no clearly discernible target; however, their
 appearance beginning on the heels of the disappearance of Chen,
 considered for many years to be Mao's chief theoretical. prop:,
 suggested some relationship.  An article in the fifth issue of
 RED FLAG by the writing group of the Liaoning Provincial CCP
 Committee, presumably controlled by Politburo member Chen Hsi-lien,.
 seems to be an attack on theoreticians who have "tried to overawe
 people with words and phrases torn out of context from Marxist
 works."  The article criticizes those who do not acknowledge "the.
 dependence of knowledge on social practice."  Although it is
 impossible to pin down current targets with any certainty, the
 focus of the attack seems to be leftists who maintain their own
 theoretical ideas even if they run counter to practice.

 SUPPLEMENTARY ARTICLE
 CHINESE AND SOVIET PROPACANQA ON THE PHILIPPINES
 The crosscurrents of Sino-Soviet competition for influence on
 the developing nations of Asia and Peking's dual-level
 approach to these noncommunist Asian countries are illustrated
 in recent propaganda treatment of the Philippines, reflecting
 both communist powers' efforts to improve their relations with
 the Philippine Government.  While Chou En-lai met with the
 members of two unofficial Philippine economic missions visiting
 in China, Peking media sustained their propaganda attacks on
 the "reactionary Philippine authorities" and continued to
 express support for the armed insurgency of the Philippine
 New People's Army led by the pro-Peking Philippine communist
 party.
 Moscow pressed its wooing of the Philippine Government with
 a visit by a Soviet friendship and cultural delegation;
 concurrently it registered its bid for local Philippine
 communist allegiance by publicizing a meEsage of greetings
 to the 24th CPSU Congress from the Central Committee of the
 Soviet-lining Communist Party of the Philippines.*
 PEKING COURTS NORMALIZATION WHILE SUPPWTING COMMUNISTS
 There have been signs that Peking hopes to extend its current
 diplomatic drive to noncommunist countries in Southeast Asia,
 an area that has been a major target for Peking-backed
 armed insurgencies.  An effort to test the ground for more
 normal relations between the PRC and its noncommunist neighbors
 has been indicated by the arrival of trade groups in China
 and gestures by Peking pointing to more amicable relations
 with governments that have been objects of severe propaganda
 "  Moscow and Peking each refers to the group it supports as
 "the" Philippine Communist Party.  For purposes of clarity
 this article refers to the Peking-lining CPP as the CPP/M-L,
 consistent with the nomenclature applied to the pro-Peking
 CP's of such other Asian countries as India and Australia,
 and to the pro-Moscow party as the CPP.

 attack.  NCNA reported on 15 May that trade delegations from
 the Philippines, Malaysia, and Burma had attended the Canton
 spring export fair which closed that day.  Earlier in the
 month Peking had announced the arrival of two unofficial
 trade missions from the Philippines and one from Malaysia.*
 Peking reported that the two Philippine groups were received
 by Chou En-lai for "a friendly conversation," met with
 Chinese trade c.~fficials, and visited historical sites.
 NCNA's coverage of the visits has not indicated any
 agreements or discussions looking toward agreements, but
 its report on the Canton trade fair pointed out that
 "trade personages from countries that have no diplomatic
 relations with China as yet showed their friendly sentiments
 for the Chinese people and expressed their strong desire
 for developing friendly trade contacts with China."
 On two other occasions Peking has taken pains to demonstrate
 Chinese good will.  On 8 November 1970 NCNA announced that
 the Chinese Red Cross had decided to donate food to
 Philippine typhoon victims.  Similarly, Peking acted
 quickly to avert undue trouble in late March of this
 year when a Philippine airliner was hijacked to Canton
 by Maoist Filipino youths.  NCNA reported on 31 March
 that after investigations the PRC "decided to give
 lenient treatment" and ordered the plane to "leave China
 quickly."  There was no mention of the hijackers'
 political motivation or affiliation, NCNA noting simply
 that six passengers who "firmly refused" to return to
 the Philippines remained in China.
 These Chinese moves suggest an effort to stimulate domestic
 pressure on the Philippine Government to take a more
 accommodating approach toward the PRC.  The Philippines
 has diplomatic relations with the Nationalist regime on
 Taiwan, and it has voted against seating of the PRC
 in the United Nations.  Moreover, the Philippines is
 a member of SEATO and has contributed personnel to the
 allied war effort in Vietnam.  Chinese propaganda on
 the Philippines has focused on what it has portrayed as
 dominant American influence on that country's political
 *  NCNA's reportage of the activities of the latter group
 used the term "Malaysia" for the first time, in contrast to
 Peking's past practice of referring to "Malaya" or
 occasionally quoting other sources' use of the federation's
 official title.

 and economic life, a line calculated to appeal to nationalistic
 and anti-U.S. sentiment.
 Peking has also sought to put pressure on the Philippine
 Government from another direction, in the form of propaganda
 support for the pro-Maoist New People's Army led by the
 C,'P/M-L.  Since a k August 1970 NCNA report, the first
 Chinese propaganda support for the Philippine communists
 since October 1967," Peking has periodically disseminated
 accounts of armed guerrilla actions against "reactionary
 troops and police."  Peking has also played up the
 insurgents' propaganda activities among the people,
 reporting that the New People's Army propagates Mao's
 thought among the peasants and organizes them for armed
 struggle.
 Peking has not, in its own name, directed polemical
 attacks at President Marcos personally, a restraint
 which the Chinese have also practiced toward the Burmese
 and Malaysian leaders.  But the recently inaugurated
 "Voice of the People of Burma"--a clandestine radio
 following a Maoist propaganda line in support of the
 Burmese communist insurgency--in an 18 April commentary
 denouncing Burmese leader Ne Win's trip to the
 Philippines called Marcos "the reactionary President
 of the Philippines" and cited domestic pressures on
 him from "the people and the Communist Party of the
 Philippines."  The commentary declared that no matter
 how wseh they may try to destroy their countries'
 communist parties, Ne Win and Marcos "can never avoid
 the doom of being overthrown by their own i^oples."
 Another pro-Maoist clandestine radio, the "Voice of
 the Malayan Revolution," has also hailed the Philippine
 communists' armed struggle and the ;rowth of the New
 People's Army "during the past two years."
 No clandestine radio has yet been heard broadcasting
 in the name of the Philippine communists.  The
 inauguration of the "Voice of the People of Burma" on
 28 March has enabled Peking to follow a dua.i approach
 toward Burma, in effect permitting a division of labor
 according to which the clandestine radio propagates the
 revolutionary line while the PRC media observe the
 diplomatic constraints.
 "Peking's revival of propaganda support for the Philippine
 communists is discussed in the TRENDS of 12 August 1970,

 PEKING, MOSCOW COMPETE FOR LOYALTY OF PHILIPPINE COt!JNISTS
 The Sino-Soviet competition for leadership of the international
 communist movement is reflected ii the existence of two groups
 of Philippine communists, each laying claim to be the'.legitimate
 communist party of the country.  Characteristically, both Peking
 and Moscow have manipulated propaganda attributed to their
 respective followers to air their competing ideological lines
 for the world communist gallery.
 PEKING     NCNA on 29 January transmitted a 26 December 1970
 statement of the Central Committee of the CPP/M-L
 commemorating the second anniversary of the reestablishment
 of "the Communist Party of the Philippines."  The statement
 asserted that the party "as presently constituted by the
 advocates and practitioners of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tsetii
 Thought" had "proven itself as the true inheritor of the
 revolutionary achievements of the proletariat" in the
 Philippines.  "In preserving its revolutionary integrity,"
 the statement continued, the CPP/M-L' "pursues the rectification
 movement to the end against the Lava revisionist renegade
 clique and the Taruc-Sumulong gangster clique."
 The "Lava revisionist renegade clique" refers to the followers
 of Jesus Lava, the pro-Soviet CPP secretary general captured in
 1964.  Taruc and Sumulong, who have been accused by ANG
 BAYAN--the CPP/M-L journal--of trying "to amass wealth
 privately" in collusion with "bourgeois politicians," were
 the recent leaders of the pro-Soviet CPP. Sumulong was
 captured in September 1970 by the Philippine armed forces
 and Taruc was killed in October 1970, initiating a period
 of chaos and factionalism within the CPP.
 An NCNA commentary on 28 March 1971, commemorating the
 second anniversary of the founding of the New People's
 Army on 29 March 1969, noted that the CPP/M-L rectification
 campaign against the Lava-Taruc-Sumulong "cliques" was
 being pursued "to the end."  Implying victory over the
 pro-Soviet groups, a New People's Army statement on the
 29 March anniversary, carried by NCNA on 10 April,
 contended that "the com*lete collapse" of the Taruc-
 Sumulong "gangster cliqu:" in "less than two years after
 its mass criticism and repudiation" had "totally
 vindicated the correctness of the establishment of
 the New People's Aray under a communist party inspired
 by Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tsetung Thought."  None of the
 propaganda has named the leaders of the party.

 MOSCOW     After years of near silence on the CPP, Moscow on
 12 April broadcast the text of a message of greetings
 to the 24th CPSU Congress from "the Central Committee of the
 Communist Party of the Philippines."  Observing that one of
 the main reasons "for our defeat in the '50's" was "self-
 isolation from the international communist movement," the
 message asserted that "the current leadership" of the CPP
 "is fully determined to adhere to the principles of proletarian
 internationalism."  Taking note of the conflict with the CPP
 M-L, the message stated that the CCP's position was opposed
 "by a group in the Philippines that poses as a revolutionary
 force, but in fact is guided by the counterrevolutionary
 concept serving the Maoist leadership's aspiration to dominate
 in Southeast Asia."
 Moscow had virtually ignored the CPP since January 1965 when
 it publicized the party's contention that liberation could
 be achieved in the Philippines by peaceful means.  In late
 1969 and early 1970 Soviet media carried a few brief items
 on the possibility of legalization of the CPP by the :?tarcos
 government.  The CPP was identified by Western news sources
 as one of the two unnamed "clandestine" parties present at
 the June 1969 Moscow conference, but Moscow said nothing
 about its presence.  The CPP was not among the parties
 reported by Moscow to have sent representatives to the
 Lenin centenary celebrations in Moscow in April 1970, and
 Soviet media did not mention the presence of a CPP delega-
 tion to the 24th CPSU Congress.
 SOVIETS PRESS IN LOW KEY FOR DIPLOMATIC, TRADE TIES
 Infrequent Soviet comment on the Philippines generally
 focuses on anti-U.S. events in the Philippines and on
 alleged U.S. exploitation of the Philippine economy and
 domination of Philippine foreign policy.  In a continuing
 effort to improve state relations, however, Moscow publicized
 the August 1970 visit to the Soviet Union by a delegation
 of Philippine congressmen; extended relief through the Red
 Cross to Philippine flood victims in September 1970; and
 has reported allegedly growing sentiment in the Philippines
 for normalization of diplomatic and trade ties with the
 Soviet Union.  On 6 May IZVESTIYA reported "great interest"
 aroused in the Philippines by the visit of a delegation
 from the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and
 Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and noted that
 the delegation had been received by President Marcos.
