 East European Communist Regimes Publish More Foreign Language
 Newspapers.  The Hungarians have recently begun publishing a combination
 English and German language daily newspaper, DAILY NEWS--NEUESTE
 NACHRICHTEN.  The new paper is the brainchild of Sandor Bares, Director
 General of MTI, the Hungarian state news agency.   It publishes articles
 of major international  interest in both English and German, and articles
 of lesser interest in the language of those readers most likely to be
 interested.  The press run of the first issue was 3,000 copies, and
 according to the Hungarian press, this was increased to 16,500 copies
 by the end of the first week;  13,000 copies were sold in Budapest and
 the rest in the provinces.   The Czechs have been publishing a German
 language newspaper (VOLKSZEITUNG) for a considerable time, but only
 recently got the agreement of the German Democratic Republic to allow
 copies to be circulated in that country.   (See ML, BPG #211, 13 March
 1967.)
 Communist Czech Press Bureau Turns a Capitalistic Profit.  The
 .Czech party organ, RUDE PRAVO, noted with satisfaction that for the first
 time since the Communists seized power in 1948, the operations of the
 national press bureau were profitable in 1966.  The Czechoslovak Press
 Bureau (CPB), which employs 30 foreign correspondents and transmits 70
 hours per day in foreign languages (counting the overlapping transmissions
 in various languages), took in nearly $1,000,000 more than it paid out in
 1966.
 More Communist Papers Likely to Fold.  NORRSKENS FLAMMAN (Northern
 Lights), the only Communist daily in Sweden and one of the oldest left-
 of-center newspapers in Scandinavia, is experiencing serious financial
 difficulties; (it lost an estimated $20,000 in 1966 despite heavy Party
 subsidies), and may have to convert to a weekly publication or cease
 publishing altogether.   Its current circulation is only 8,000.
 According to a UPI dispatch (31 March), FRIHETEN (Freedom), Norway's
 only Communist daily, has folded.   Its circulation was known to have
 declined from 131,000 immediately following World War II to about 7,400
 and the newspaper's influence had declined following the 1956 suppression
 of the Hungarian Revolution.  The NKP Central Committee estimated it
 would cost about $43,000 to keep the paper going through 1967.
 Previous items in this space have told of similar difficulties of
 other Communist newspapers such as LE DRAPEAU ROUt E (Red Flag), Brussels
 (ML, BPG 202, 24 October 1966), and UNITA (Unity), Rome and Milan daily
 (ML, BPG 200, 26 September 1966).

 Popular Front Communist Influ-

 The =.1 March 1967
 issue of NEW TIMES, the weekly
 journal of world affairs pub-
 lished in 7 languages by Moscow's
 TRUD, the Soviet labor organ,
 carries a short feature (attached)
 which can be interpreted as a
 boast by the Communists about
 their sway over the Finnish Govern-
 ment.
 Also attached are excerpts of
 the translation of Kekkonen's 4 Feb-
 tuary speech at the-'North OstPoboth-
 nian Student Corporation festival --
 distributed by the Finnish Ministry of

 Foreign Affairs.   Note the underlined
 portion for Kekkonen's own words
 about the Communists being involved
 in the founding of universities
 "and when the funds are made avail-
 able they go abroad representing
 their country.'"  By leaving out the
 words "when the funds are made
 available," Moscow's NEW TIMES
 suggest that Communists regular
 act as spokesmen for Finland.
 Kekkonen's speech illustrates
 how the Communists, once involved
 in a popular front government, be-
 come involved in many sectors in
 the nation's life under the guise
 of new-found respectability.   NEW
 TIMES' treatment also shows how
 they seek to exaggerate their res-
 pectability and use the position
 claimed in one country to gain
 status in other countries.
 What has been the reaction of
 the Finns themselves to the influence
 of the Communists since their front
 group, the Finnish People's Democrat-
 ic League (SKDL), joined the present
 May (
 1966, "West European Communists
 X1C
 Stress Popular Front Tactics:   The
 Case of Finland," and #1089 of 16
 January 1967, "Finland: Soviets
 Still Critical of Social Democrats'?)-
 One reaction is shown by the attached
 cartoon from the independent liberal
 HELSINGIN SANOMAT, Finland's largest
 and most influential paper.   The
 internationally-known cartoonist
 "Kari" captions his drawing with a
 verbatim quote from Kekkonen's
 speech:   "Whoever has faith in his
 own ideals does not fear cooperation
 with the Communists."  From left to
 right he depicts the Communist Party
 thug, the squeezed and starving
 Social Democrat, the country bumpkin
 Agrarian, the bemedaled Kekkonen,
 the fat Conservative (wearing a
 military helmet and clerical garb,
 representing the main support for
 this party), the white-collared
 Liberal, and the "Fancy Dan"
 Swedish People's Party member.
 The action with the hammer and
 sickle speaks for itself.
 (For another view of
 current Finnish politics, see
 "Finland's Government: The Return
 of the Communists" by Katarina
 Brodin of the Swedish Institute of
 International Affairs in the January
 1967 SURVEY, London.  Although the
 dangers inherent in the "popular
 front" are not sufficiently empha-
 sized in the article, there is some
 exploitable material on Soviet-
 Finnish relations.)

 are being circulated.
 The most noteworthy aspect of the

 accurate accounting of the Stalin

 The significance of the inclu-
 sion of Brezhnev's and Kosygin's
 "works" will not be overlooked by
 the party cadre or by students of
 Soviet history.   In this respect,
 assets might recall some of the
 more recent official attempts to
 rewrite history:
 1) Stalin's SHORT COURSE was
 replaced by Khrushchev's 1959 ver-
 sion of the HISTORY OF THE CPSU.
 2) The 50th Anniversary HISTORY
 (6 volumes):   Two volumes have ap-
 peared and it is doubtful that the
 six volumes will be concluded this
 year.   (One might speculate that
 party officials and historians are
 encountering difficulties in deter-
 mining what is the right version.)
 3)  World War II history.   An
 official six-volume history of World
 War II,   published during Khrushchev's
 reign, credited Khrushchev with a
 vital role in the defense of Stalin-
 grad (now Volgograd).   Another "more
 objective" version of the Battle
 of Stalingrad was published in 1965
 in which Khrushchev is mentioned
 only twice.

 ICM AND "SOCIALIST CAMP" AFFAIRS
 1.,  The leaders of most of the Warsaw Pact countries have been engaged in
 bilateral meetings apparently aimed at tightening cohesion in the wake of
 Rumania's establishment of full diplomatic relations with West Germany.  The
 anti-Bonn elements seem to have succeeded in staving off further recognition,
 at least for the present.   It had been speculated that Hungary and Bulgaria
 were the most likely to follow the Rumanian lead.  Hungary's Kadar was invited
 to Moscow in late February on an "unofficial, friendly visit":  the communique
 (Mar. 1) did not mention West Germany, but Hungary has not moved toward
 recognition.   Bulgaria's Zhivkov made a similar "unofficial, friendly visit"
 to Moscow March 13-15:   somewhat surprisingly, Bulgaria and the USSR decide
 to sign a new friendship treaty, although the existing 20-year treaty had
 another year to go.  East Germany's Ulbricht goes to Warsaw March 14-15,
 Prague 16-17, and Moscow 21-23.  He signs one new 20-year friendship treaty
 with the Poles which is openly anti-Bonn and includes firm commitments on
 present borders, and another with the Czechs which is less so and-does not.
 Meanwhile Czech President Novotny in Warsaw signed (Mar 1) a new Czech-Polish
 friendship treaty which is essentially an updating of the old 20-year pact,
 but with less emphasis on Germany.  Gomulka in turn visits Budapest March 8-9,
 where a simple affirmation of "identity of views" is made.  And finally, the
 rambunctious Rumanians visit Moscow March 17-18 and leave after an "exchange
 of opinions," with no affirmation of any agreement.
 2.   There has been little public evidence of progress toward holding the sched-
 uled April 24-27 meeting of European CPs in Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia (see
 but it appears that a considerable number
 of parties will not attend.  We have a report of a Netherlands CP reply to the
 invitation it received from the French CP, declining to attend and strongly
 criticizing Soviet methods and motives in organizing it.
 3.   Chinese isolation was interrupted only in a way which seemed to emphasize
 it, as SecyGen Wilcox of the tiny New Zealand CP (the "other one" of the two
 national CPs loyally supporting the CCP) makes another of his frequent visits
 (March 8-16).   On the other hand, relations with the Japanese Communists
 degenerate to the point of charges of "bloody, fascist atrocities" involving
 Chinese students in Tokyo (March 2 and continuing).  And the continuing con-
 flict with the Soviets brings reciprocal expulsion of two embassy officials
 (March 18-21), while Soviet personnel in Peking are harassed once more
 (March 27).  The Soviets, meanwhile, have sharply stepped up their radio
 efforts to subvert the Chinese people (See esp. March 1).

 than 22,000 apprentices from N. Vietnam will soon be spending 3-5 years in
 training programs in the various countries of the "socialist camp."
 INTERNATIONAL FRONT ORGANIZATIONS
 5.   The Soviet-promoted "Third Afro-Asian Writers Conference" is under way
 in Beirut as the period ends, boycotted and denounced as bogus by the Chinese
 and their "A-A Writers Bureau" (who plan to hold their own version in Peking;

 8.   As indicated in our unclassified outline summary, developments in China
 during this period continue to ap;Dear confused and indecisive in most aspects.
 There seems to have been an overall trend toward consolidation and moderation,
 with the Army increasingly serving as the sinews of the regime, -- but there
 is still much evidence of pressure, to "carry the CR through to the end."

 right wing military group"; and the "Indian reactionaries." es."  A new charge
 against the latter, "using Tibetan bandit traitors to carry out frenzied anti-
 China activities" (March 22), follows Delhi's March 10 broadcast of a state-
 ment by the Dalai Lama pegged to the 8th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising
 against the Chinese and describing the "latest wave of barbaric persecution
 of. Tibetan Buddhists, monasteries," etc.
 11.   To the underdeveloped world, NCNA transmits a PEOPLE'S DAILY March 15

 13.                    report indicates that the Chinese are postponing the annual
 Sino-Soviet trade talks, and it is expected that the final agreement will
 remain at a low level.
 14.  Perhaps most noteworthy are two Soviet ventures in the field of "unoffi-
 cial" political/propaganda activity ostensibly carried on by Soviet "public
 figures" and "public organizations":   (a) Radio "Peace and Progress," which
 has been broadcasting to non-Communist audiences for more than a year, but
 which has now been given a major new mission of subverting the Chinese people
 (see policy statement, March 1); and   (b) a newly-formed "Soviet Committee
 in Support of Vietnam" consisting of "48 prominent public leaders" (March 16).
 15.   Soviet media devote major attention to developments in China, largely
 in the form of critical commentary rather than reporting.   They hit repeatedly
 at:   Chinese persecution of minorities, especially Moslems (March 9 and con-
 tinuing); Chinese obstruction of aid to Vietnam (March 1, 2, 14); and Chinese
 trade with S. Africa (Feb 27, March 7, 16).
 16.   Soviet week-long entertainment of Austrian Chancellor Klaus (March 14-21)
 produces no visible results.   Clandestine reporting indicates that the Soviets
 are trying to persuade and bribe the Austrians to act as host for a Government-
 level all-European conference on European security, but that the latter are
 holding out against it.
 17.   Soviet diplomatic personnel have been expelled from Italy, Cyprus, and
 Greece thus far, all apparently involved in a widespread espionage ring
 uncovered with the arrest by the Italian police of three Italian agents for
 the ring.   (March 22 and continuing.   See also Briefly Noted, this issue.)

 19.   Internally, the 50th anniversary of the "February Revolution" is noted
 only as paving the way for October.   (March 12)  A PRAVDA theoretical article

 Chinese by signing a new, considerably enlarged trade agreement in. Moscow

 -- We particularly like the juxtaposition of the March 1 Hungarian charge that
 the Chinese are using the mass psychology and propaganda techniques of Hitler
 and Goebbels with the March 2 Chinese charge that the Soviets are disciples
 of Goebbels.  We point out that they are both right in the sense that Goebbels
 was a ruthlessly skillful practicioner, but we add that the Communists began
 to use these propaganda techniques long before Hitler and Goebbels came to
 power.
 -- Similarly, the March 7 PEOPLE'S DAILY article castigating the Soviets for
 fearing to "let the broad masses of the Soviet people exercise democracy"
 and calling the Soviet regime a savage, despotic, fascist dictatorship:   true,
 and who should know better than the Chinese, who still revere the most des-
 potic of all Soviet leaders, Stalin?
 -- The Albanian March 8 & 11 criticisms of Soviet degeneration are devastating
 and bolstered with examples from Soviet life.
 -- The Soviets on Feb. 25 accuse Peking of lying and fabricating; -- and the
 Chinese on March 21 say that the Soviet Foreign Ministry "turns black into
 white and fabricates rumors and slanders."  The latter followed an exchange
 in which the Soviets and Chinese again contradicted each other's versions
 of the "atrocities" in January and February.   The same recriminations go on
 between the Chinese and Japanese Communists.   Etc., etc.
 2.   Shades of Stalin!   The Feb. 27 PRAVDA theoretical article on Soviet edu-
 cation, extolling "persuasion as the chief method of educational work" and
 going on to defend the combination of persuasion and state coercion should be
 replayed to those inclined to believe that the Soviet Communist leopard has
 been changing his spots.
 3.   It will not be difficult for propagandists to expose the mendacity of the
 Soviet effort to develop "unofficial" political/propaganda instruments such
 as Radio "Peace and Progress" (which even uses the same facilities as Radio
 Moscow) and this "Committee in Support of Vietnam," -- in a country where
 everything is tightly controlled not only by the government but by the Party
 above and behind the Government.

 WORLD COMMUNIST AFFAIRS
 CHRONOLOGY
 The Turmoil in China
 Again we treat the confused reporting on China in outline summary.
 A.  The teetering revolution.       The radical Maoist revolutionaries are con-
 tinuing their struggles for seizure of power at all levels with varying
 results, while the Army increasingly looms as the real force in the patch-
 work "3-way alliance" (revolutionaries, loyal cadres, and Army) structure
 which, under the visible leadership of Chou En-lai, apparently holds the
 country together.
 (1)  From central regime media, we note particularly:
 (a)  PEOPLE'S DAILY, March 1, Red Guard article, "Down with Anarchism
 complains that "certain ill-intentioned persons peddle anarchism under the
 flags of 'mass line' and 'extensive democracy,' and cites Lenin (LEFT-
 WING COMMUNISM, AN INFANTILE DISORDER) on the need for "absolute central-
 ization and the strictest discipline of the proletariat.
 (b)                      An editorial note in PD on March 2 reiterates that the correct
 treatment of cadres is a "'key question."
 (c)  RED FLAG No. 5(Radio Peking  March 9)  editorial, "On the
 Revolutionary 3-Way Alliance," bows to the PLA (People's Liberation Army)
 as "the true pillar of support of the proletariat" and declares that any
 unit which seizes power should include the PLA in a 3-way alliance, no
 matter whether it be in "factories, rural areas, finance and trade agencies,
 cultural and educational departments, colleges, middle and primary schools,"
 etc. However, it also states that the "revolutionary cadres... should, and
 may, be able to play the role as the core or backbone" of the provisional
 organs "if they are united as one with the masses."  It concludes by quot-
 ing Mao on the need to "carry through to the end the great proletarian
 cultural revolution.`
 (d)  WORKERS'DAILY, central organ of the All-China Trade Union Federa-
 tion, reappears March 9, after having been suspended 5 weeks following its
 take-over by the '`revolutionary rebels`.  Its lead editorial says that the
 former editorial staff was rightly accused of being unfamiliar with the
 works of Mao Tse-tung.  (Reporting this from Peking, AFP's Bernard Ullman
 adds that "another suppressed newspaper, PEKING DAILY, organ of the Peking
 Municipal administration formerly under purged 11jayor Peng Chen, reappeared
 during mid-February but is still not distributed as an official organ.")
 (2)  Who's Who at the Ton?  Chou En-lai continues to appear as the regime's
 leading spokesman, and a wave of posters supporting him on the 17th in-
 cludes the claim that he is "Chairman Mao's close comrade in arms."  Chou,
 however, continues to speak in the name of Mao and Lin Piao.  Addressing a

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061AO00400060006-7
 workers meeting on the 22nd, he uses the formulation "The PLA was found-
 ed by Chairman Mao and is led by deputy supreme commander Lin Paio,  but
 Lin has not appeared in public since November.  Some high-ranking victims
 of Red Guard attacks, including Acting First Secretary of the Peking
 Municipal Party Committee Wu Te, are reported rehabilitated and back on
 their jobs after conducting self-criticism.  A notice posted in Peking
 on the 26th declares that 20 revolutionary organizations in the capital
 have formed a committee to crush the Liu-Teng group, who are "constantly
 seeking an opportunity to control the Army and seize political power,.
 thereby plotting to revive capitalism in China."  A. poster seen on Uarch 18
 indicated a current CC meeting, but there has been no further information
 on the subject.
 (3)  The Army carries the burden of revolution --- without shootingl
 Chinese media emphasize the active roles played by Army units: aiding
 production teams, aiding in spring farming, sending out propaganda teams,
 etc. Mostly Army personnel appears not actively engaged in the work but
 rather transmitting directives from the regime and enforcing discipline
 in lieu of the normal power structure.  Interestingly, the Army's most
 visible action    the take-over of all power in Canton and its province
 of Kwangtung, reported directly from Canton by eyewitness David Oancia of
 the Toronto GLOBE AND MAIL and by travelers reaching nearby Hong Kong
 was barely mentioned by Chinese media.  Oancia writes that the Army's
 assumption of power there followed "production breakdowns, struggles
 between rival groups, factories deprived of leadership, and attempted
 sabotage."
 (lt)  The back-to-school movement.
 (a)  NCNA on March 6 announces that the primary schools in Peking
 and Shanghai have reopened.  "The very first lesson was the study of
 Chairman Mao's quotations and writings.... Courses in arithmetic, science
 and other subjects were also arranged.'  Two days later, Radio Moscow
 notes. that 'most" Chinese schools are still closed and that "teachers
 are afraid to return to work after the humiliations inflicted on them
 by Mao's organized teenage followers."
 (b)  A "draft" CC directive reported (by MAINICHI's Correspondent
 Takada) posted in Peking on the 11th states `the revolutionary teachers
 and students who are in factories and farms away from their campuses...
 should return before 20 March to the colleges or universities to which
 they belong and should engage in the CR there."
 (c)  Various correspondents report the appearance in Peking on the
 23rd of a CC directive of the 18th ordering the Red Guards to remain at
 home and refrain from making further trips or long marches to exchange
 revolutionary experience.
 (d)  Peking Radio on the 26th describes a mass meeting; of 10,000
 Red Guard representatives of the middle schools in the capital, addressed
 by Chou, Chen Po-ta, Chiang Ching, etc., to form "their own new revolu-
 tionary organization -- The Red Guard Congress of the Middle Schools."
 A similar RG Congress of the Universities and Institutes of the capital

 had been established on February 22, as disclosed by an NCNA Domestic item
 on March 2.
 B.  Epidemic and food crises?  Chinese media continue to emphasize the
 regime's serious concern lest spring farming suffer from CR disruption,
 but there is no solid evidence that a grave food shortage is impending.
 However, reports of growing epidemics of meningitis, encephalitis, and
 at her serious diseases, circulated by non-Chinese sources, seem confirmed
 by an NCNA release of March 22 on the large-scale departure of teams of
 doctors and nurses from the cities to work in the countryside to help in-
 sure a good harvest, as "both medical work teams and teams for propagating
 Mao Tse-tung's thought."  It says that 570 have gone from Peking to far-
 off places and another 650 to nearer places for the spring farming
 season, and that ''fifty teams comprising more than 1000 personnel have
 just left Tsinan city"for remote parts of Shantung province.
 C.  Chinese censors.hip confirmed:  Western correspondents in Tokyo con-
 firm that Chinese pressure on Japanese correspondents in Peking has result-
 ed in a drastic reduction of their reporting.  WASHINGTON POST's Richard
 Halloran reports the situation on March 8; on the 21st he follows up with
 a story of the Chinese expulsion of MAINICHI'sTakata by refusal to renew
 his 180-day visa while routinely renewing those of the other Japanese
 correspondents.  In sharp contrast to earlier patterns, Yugoslav media
 almost ignore events in China during this period (judged by reporting
 reaching us), whether through fear of reprisals or simply because of a
 sharp change of policy, while the Bulgarians increase their reporting.
 Soviet media are devoting large blocks of space and time to China, but
 largely in the form of highly critical commentary (to domestic, Chinese,
 and world-wide audiences) rather than reporting.
 Chronology Continued
 February 21 (delayed):  The left-wing Italian Socialist Party of
 Proletarian Unity  PSIUP, split from the PSI in 1964) loses a pro--Chinese
 splinter.  As reported by the Communist-oriented Rome daily PAESA SERA
 on the 22nd, 9 prominent members of the Bologna Federation's Executive
 Council, headed by the editor and financial backer of the `clearly Chinese-
 oriented magazine CLASSE E STATO,resigned after the Council, in the
 presence of national PSIUP Secretary Vecchietti, voted to expel 3 members
 for distributing "manifestos violently critical of revisionism in the
 CGIL" (General Council of Italie,nLabor).
 February 25 (delaed)  NEDELYA, the Sunday supplement of IZVESTIYA,
 accuses Radio Peking of "all kinds of lies -- juggling with facts, tell-
 ing cock-and-bull stories, and failure to mention facts."  "It is easier
 to judge the events in China from what Peking does not say than from
 its pronouncements."

 great leap- policy and its resultant 'philosophy of poverty."  KZ con-
 cludes:  "There will appear forces in the CCP which will restore the

 between the "constituent conference" and the Albanian Party.
 Radio Havana broadcasts the text of a statement made at "a press
 conference with national and foreign newsmen at the DPRK Embassy in
 Cuba" by a representative of the North Korean news agency KCNA denying
 and denouncing recent Chinese Red Guard calumnies, sldnders, and false

 its "`official" Mandarin programs from a total of 77 to 70 hours weekly.
 (Note: This corrects a Radio Bratislava item on subject Feb. 25, #11.)
 The inaugural program outlines policy, including the following excerpts:

 first JCP accounts, it all bedaii at the Zenrin Gakusei Kaikan (Good
 Neighbor Students Hall), which houses the Japan-China Friendship Associa-
 tion as well as dormitory quarters for Chinese students, when a gang of
 Chinese students stormed the JCFA offices "to protest against the alleged
 removal by Association personnel of wall newspapers put up at the entrance"
 of the hall which "slandered our Assn as 'pseudo JCFA,' 'anti-China,"""
 etc., and to demand that the Assn "immediately remove itself from the
 building."  Next day, A reveals that "some of the divisionists who bolted
 from the JCFA have formed a 'rebel corps' after the fashion of a certain
 foreign organization'.
 The other side of the story is presented at a press conference on
 the 3rd (NCNA Peking on the 8th) by Director Miyazaki of the JCFA
 (Orthodox) -- the pro-Chinese faction split from the JCFA last October.
 Complaining that the "Miyamoto faction" (JCP) had turned the JCFA offices
 `'into a stronghold for anti-China activities" since the split, he supports
 as "absolutely justified" the "efforts to throw the ruffians of the JCP
 out of the hostel in order to safeguard the life and property of the
 Chinese students."  NCNA adds:  "On the wall of the_press conference room
 were displayed bloodstained coats, shirts, and trousers of the Chinese
 students beaten up by the hooligans, as well as photographs of the inci-
 dent taken on the spot...."
 A on the 5th announces that delegates of 33 organizations formally

 the riot was caused directly by a member of the pro-JCP JCFA who tore

 including Chinese students, those who bolted from the JCFA, and the blind
 followers of a foreign influence, have been illegally occupying the class-
 rooms of the Japan-China College ...and have been using the desks, chairs,

 However, the paper AKAHATA, tutning white into black and standing

 1112.              AFRO-ASIAN SPLIT:  MOSCOW VS. PEKING
 The Aftermath of Nicosia
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  The Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organization (AAPSO)
 had suffered for years from the repercussions of the Sino-Soviet dispute.
 AAPSO has now definitely split into a largely Soviet-dominated main
 section and a smaller section under the influence of the Chinese.  The
 immediate cause of the split was the decision of the recent Soviet-
 controlled AAPSO Council Session in Nicosia, Cyprus (13-16 February) to
 transfer the 1967 (5th) AAPSO conference from Peking to Algiers.   The
 Chinese lost little time in announcing that "the Conference" (read:
 their rump conference) will take place in Peking this year.   (For fuller
 background on the developments in Nicosia, see BPG #211, item #1106,
 dated 13 March 1967).
 The Peking Diehards.
 There is good reason to believe that the two AAPSO conferences will
 be held in 1967.   The Peking conference will inevitably be small:   most
 of the delegates will be exiles or representatives of split African and
 Asian national ("rebel") organizations.  Participants will most likely
 include:   Peking-based exiles (Indonesian, Thai) who have denounced the
 Nicosia meeting; pro-Chinese factions of divided national Afro-Asian
 committees (Japan, Ceylon); African organizations which were expelled
 or walked out of the Nicosia meeting; and some others who were displeased
 with the Soviet control at Nicosia.
 The decision for shifting the Conference to Algiers was far from
 unanimous (see item #1106).   It is significant that the delegations
 from North Vietnam and from the National Liberation Front of South
 Vietnam (NLFSV) reportedly called at first for the 5th conference to
 remain in Peking, but Hanoi was evidently pleased with the meeting's
 position on Vietnam (see below), and finally backed the move to Algiers.
 Nicosia -- A Landmark.
 In any event, the Nicosia meeting is a turning point in AAPSO's
 history which formally began at a meeting in Cairo of representatives of
 African and Asian "peoples" in late December 1957 -- the first AAPSO
 conference.   The "peoples' solidarity movement" was (and still is) an
 amalgam of Sino-Soviet opportunism and of Afro-Asian ideology based on
 anti-imperialism.

 The significance of the Nicosia meeting, of the :resultant split,
 and. of its meaning in terms of ?APSO as an organization, is demonstrated
 by the respective Soviet and Chinese interpretations and the mutual
 Sino-Soviet recriminations which continue better than a full month after
 the close of the meeting.
 Peking Withdraws from Cairo Secretariat.
 On 17 March, the Chinese Committee for A-A Solidarity issued a
 bitter statement (for full text see Attachment) condemning the Soviet
 revisionists for manipulating the "illegal" Nicosia meeting, which
 niy split the A-A movement and solidarity against, imperialism.  The
 statement reiterated that the 5th AAPSO Conference will be held in
 Peking this year and announced formation of a preparatory committee.
 The statement stresses that the Chinese AAPS  Committee shall henceforth
 have nothing to do with the AAPSO secretariat in Cairo, which is under
 the control of the "Soviet revisionists."  The statement contends that
 the Soviet "revisionist clique" has split from the AA.PS movement so
 that it can be of more use to U.S. imperialism; and distorts the Chinese
 predicament by claiming that "with the removal of this cancer -- the
 Soviet revisionists -- the Afro-.Asian peoples' cause of solidarity
 against imperialism will undergo a sounder development and forge ahead
 more vigorously."
 Vilification of the Master's Voice.
 The Peking-based Indonesian. RAPS "organization" :issued.
 a statement which condemned the Soviets and their actions in AAPSO in
 even harsher terms than did the Chinese.   It denounced the "Soviet
 revisionists and their lackeys" for:   "having hatched a splittist meet-
 ing" which betrayed the struggle of the Afro-Asian peoples; inviting
 and. adopting as members "revisionist, splittist cliques" (Ceylon, Japan);
 forcing through a resolution on the 50th anniversary of the October
 Revolution, and ordering a resolution on the "capi.tulationist Tashkent
 spirit"; closing their eyes to the massacres and persecutions by the
 Suharto-Nasution fascist regime.   The statement also said that the
 permanent AAPSO secretariat in Cairo degenerated and completely failed
 to fulfill its tasks; hence, "Indonesia" declares its withdrawal from
 AAPSO's Cairo secretariat.
 Peking's Multiple Voice,
 The Peace Liaison Committee of the Asian and Pacific Regions
 (PLCAPR) also issued a statement on the illegality of the "stage-managed"
 Nicosia meeting, stressing that PLCAPR has been represented, whenever
 possible, at bona fide AAPSO meetings because of the organization's
 importance in the struggle for peace.   The attempted takeover of the
 organization by revisionists is a blow to "peace in our region", the
 statement said, and urged all member countries to support the AAPSO

 meeting in Peking,  (The PLCAPR is a regional World Peace Council secre-
 tariat.  It was established at an Asian and Pacific Peace Conference in
 Peking in October, 1952.  Its purpose was to coordinate "peace activi-
 ties" in that area under the leadership of the Chinese.  After some
 years of inaction it was revived in 1961 by the Chinese as part of their
 campaign against the Soviet Union and as a potential rival to the WPC.)
 Mocow: Chinese Stymie AAPSO and International Fronts.
 Soviet commentary, as expected, is more sober.   Hailing Nicosia
 (i,e., their outmaneuvering of the Chicoms at Nicosia) as a "business-
 like" meeting and as a step forward for AAPSO, a PRAVDA commentator
 points out that the Chinese had attempted for some time to drive a
 wedge into AAPSO with a view to turning it into a Chinese political
 instrument; that the Nicosia meeting demonstrated the growing realiza-
 tion among "mass international organizations" (read:   Soviet-sponsored
 international fronts);that the Chinese leaders do not contribute any-
 thing positive tom these (front) organizations; and that the Nicosia
 meeting. demonstrated the international isolation of the Mao Tse-tung
 group in the very geographic area which has been the main target of its
 chauvinistic and hegemonist aspirations.   Radio Moscow (to Southeast
 Asia -- see attachment) stressed that at Nicosia, the council "removed
 everything" that interferes with AAPSO's unity; and it put stress on
 the importance which the meeting accorded the Vietnam problem, with
 its resolve of stepping up practical aid to the Vietnamese people.
 Soviet A-A Committee Displaying Initiative.
 Wasting little time in capitalizing on having gained the upper
 hand over the Chinese, the Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee re-
 solved to convene an international conference in Baku in September,
 devoted to,the October Revolution and the liberation movements of the
 Afro-Asian-Latin American peoples.   The brief announcement also expresses
 the Soviet committee's support of the Nicosia resolution on solidarity
 with Vietnam.   The inclusion of the Latin American liberation contin-
 gent would seem to be a Soviet step toward consolidating under their
 control the Afro-Asian-Latin American Solidarity Organization, founded
 in Havana, Cuba in January 1966.   (On current Soviet and Cuban rivalry
 in Latin America, see also Item #111 , this issue.)
 Nicosia Met Hanoi's Requirements.
 Most significantly, Hanoi (VNA - 15 March) strongly supported the
 Nicosia meeting's resolution on Vietnam which "condemned the barbarous
 crimes committed by U.S. imperialism".   Hanoi also points out that the
 Week of Solidarity with the Vietnamese People (13-19 March), which
 was decided upon at Nicosia, supplemented a program adopted by the
 (largely Soviet-manipulated) Tri-Continental (AALAPSO) Conference in
 Havana.

 1113.                      HO CHI MINH'S BLUNDERS
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  A propaganda war that has admittedly been going rather
 badly for the free world suddenly took a sharp tack for the better in
 March.   Thanks for the change in direction must go to North Vietnam's
 President Ho Chi Minh, who by consensus of free world propaganda experts,
 has been guilty of a major propaganda blunder.   What happened was this:
 On 2 February 1967 President Lyndon Johnson secretly dispatched a letter
 to Ho Chi Minh stating that the U.S. was prepared to stop bombing North
 Vietnam as soon as he (Johnson) was assured that North Vietnamese infil-
 tration into South Vietnam by land and sea had been stopped.   Thirteen
 days later Ho answered Johnson's letter, also secretly.   The North Viet-
 namese President reiterated his usual list of U.S. offenses against the
 peace-loving Vietnamese people; he also reiterated the by-now dog-eared
 Four Points (upon which Ho has made peace negotiations contingent) and
 completely ignored Johnson's offer to cease bombing.   He also ignored
 other proposals included in the President's letter.   So much for
 Mr. Johnson's secret peace initiative.
 On 21 March came the shocker:   Ho Chi Minh publicly released the
 texts of Johnsons's letter and his reply.   Why he chose to do so is a
 mystery -- by most standards Johnson's letter was straightforward and
 sincere, its wording free of diplomatic ambiguities.  To most readers it
 seemed crystal-clear that the President was actively trying to find a
 new route.to the negotiating table.   On the other hand, except to the hard-
 core,Ho's letter is filled with hackneyed phrases and "reasoning"; his
 accusations have been repeated so often that the meaning of the words
 has worn away, and his tired polemics suddenly look as shoddy as they
 really are.   He completely failed to show any receptivity to what was
 clearly a new and. personal peace proposal; he even failed to show ordi-
 nary diplomatic courtesy to the US President in his answer.
 Of the same piece of cloth were U.S. and North Vietnamese reactions
 to UN Secretary General U Thant's standstill truce proposals made public
 on 28 March.   Secretary of State Rusk for the U.S. and Hanoi Radio for
 North Vietnam reflected precisely the same temper and tone as did Presi-
 dent Johnson and Ho just a week earlier.   (See articles attached and

 1114.d.          SOVIET WRITERS CONGRESS:  Totalitarian
 Control VS.  Intellectual Freedom
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  The Fourth Congress of Soviet Writers is to convene in
 Moscow on 22 May 1967 according to the decision of an "expanded session"
 of the board of the USSR Union of Writers.   (LITERATURNAYA GAZETA [LIT-
 ERARY GAZETTE] No. 1, 1967.)  The main concern of the Congress, according
 to a statement by LITERATURNAYA GAZETA editor Aleksandr Chakovsky, is
 to be the 50th Anniversary of the October Revolution and "the role of
 Soviet literature in its celebration."
 The Congress, if held, could be the most important single event
 since the Sinyavsky-Daniel trial in February 1966 in the long struggle
 between the regime and the liberal creative writers.  Alternatively, it
 could be as insipid as the stage-managed 23rd Party Congress in March-
 April 1966.  Which way the Congress turns out will depend on whether
 Chakovsky's above-noted statement is correct, or whether the liberals
 broaden the agenda to include the treatment and fate of fellow-writers
 Sinyavsky and Daniel,basic socio-political issues of freedom and jus-
 tice, and standards of literary quality.  The specter of liberals rais-
 ing such taboo issues is the probable reason why the regime rescheduled
 the Congress several times between 1963 and 1967.
 There are several reasons why one might wonder whether the Congress
 will convene at the scheduled time.  First, the Congress, initially
 scheduled for 1963, has already been postponed at least three times.
 Second, the situation among writers remains unsettled, largely because
 of the Party's concerted but unsuccessful efforts since March 1965 to
 govern the content and objectives of literary works; those efforts
 (which still continue) were dramatically demonstrated by the arrest and
 trial of Sinyavsky and Daniel.  A third reason for skepticism is that
 the Soviet rulers appear to fear that some writers would use the Congress
 as a platform from which to express opposition to the regime and to
 expose the continuing lack of genuine intellectual freedom; such oppo-
 sition, particularly during the period leading up to the 50th Anniver-
 sary of the October Revolution,.would be difficult to tolerate.
 For reasons of prestige and image, however, the Soviets may be
 obliged to carry out their plan to hold the Congress.   Besides the above-
 noted announcement, a press conference on 3 January 1967 attended by
 Western correspondents generated.wide publicity for the Congress.  Under
 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 CIA-RDP78-03061A000400060006-7
 (1114 Cont.)
 Approved For Release 2000/         - DP78-03061A000400060006-7
 these circumstances, another postponement would be generally construed
 to be a sign of weakness and lack of party confidence' in the Soviet
 intelligentsia.
 The nature of the Congress, if held, is a subject for further
 speculation.  If recent trends continue, the Congress will be an insipid
 affairs; the agenda and the participants will probably be tightly con-
 trolled by the hard-liners (frequently called "conservatives" but actu-
 ally Stalinists), and press coverage will probably focus on aspects
 selected by the regime.   As of less than two months before the scheduled
 opening of the Congress, the Soviet press has made little mention of
 the Congress and~.has said nothing about its agenda, length, and its
 sponsors and organizers; the only feature to stand out so far is the
 repeated press emphasis on "patriotism."'  At the same time the regime
 has applied additional heavy pressure to the liberals' major asset,
 the monthly magazine NOVY MIR (NEW WORLD) and to its well-known editor,
 Aleksandr T. Tvardovsky.   NOVY MIR and Tvardovsky were rebuked in late
 March for failing to heed earlier criticisms and warned to halt their.
 ideological transgressions.   General Secretary Brezhnev, in his well-
 publicized election speech of 10 March, made it quite clear that the
 CPSU would like the Congress to serve its interests by encouraging
 writers to turn out works to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the
 Revolution and to provide "communist education" for the people.   In
 that same speech Brezhnev echoed recent press criticisms of liberal
 writers and thus implicitly warned them not to stir up trouble at the
 Writers Congress.
 If the Congress were to express the ideas and problems (even,
 perhaps, the will) of the majority in the Writers Union, the regime
 would have to revise radically its attitude toward writers and litera-
 ture.   The permissiveness of the 1954 and 1959 Writers Congresses would,
 however, subject the regime to the risk of far-reaching, explosive
 criticism of its system and recent policies.  Thus, the Soviet leaders
 will probably continue to try to keep the Congress under control.
 As matters now stand, the likelihood on balance is that the Congress
 will be held and that it will turn out quiet and uneventful.   However,
 either one of these probabilities could be upset by events.  Unclassified
 background information is attached to facilitate assessing any new
 developments concerning the Congress.

 1115 WH,EUR.     CASTRO'S NEW, CONTINENT-WIDE OFFENSIVE
 He promotes Guerrillas, opposes "urban-based" Communist Parties
 "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder."
 Lenin
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION: Castro is trying to spark a new offensive of guerrilla
 warfare in Latin America operating apart from, and often against, the
 established Communist parties of the hemisphere.  While in a sense "new,"
 the operation in many ways is a return to older Castro tactics. Prior
 to the Havana Conference of November 1961+, Castro aided various guerrilla
 organizations which were not necessarily allied with the local Communist
 party.   This led to strife between the two local groups and between the
 local party and Havana.  At the November 1961+ conference of Latin American
 parties it was agreed that Cuba would thenceforth extend aid only to
 groups   approved by the local party.   The agreement was apparently faith-
 fully observed until the Tri-Continent Conference, which convened in
 Havana in January 1966.  The emphasis at the Tri-CC was on revolutionary
 violence and the word was followed by the deed--at least as far as Castro
 is concerned.
 2.   In the past few months guerrilla warfare has flared up in
 Venezuela, after having been almost eliminated.   The offensive is being
 carried by established guerrilla groups augmented by dissident Communists
 who have broken away from the Communist party of Venezuela (PCV). They
 established their bases in the mountains and forests and are now working
 directly with Havana, which supplies funds, arms, training, and even
 operational guidance.   In the meantime the PCV has been cut off from
 effective contact with Havana, has been heatedly denounced by Castro, and
 has borne the brunt of the Venezuelan government's crackdown.     Relations
 were further worsened by the brutal assassination of Dr. Julio Iribarren
 Borges, the brother of Venezuela's foreign minister.   The Havana repre-
 sentative of the Venezuelan guerrillas, Elias Manuit, claimed that his
 organization, the FALN, had applied "revolutionary justice" against
 Iribarren.   The Venezuelan government then stated that it would protest
 to the Organization of American States against this gross intervention by
 Castro.   The PCV, in turn, strongly denounced the FALN for the act,
 attempting to dissociate themselves from government reprisals.   On 13
 March Castro denied any involvement in the affair and countered by accusing
 the Venezuelan government of a long series of "crimes against Venezuelan

 (1115 Cont. )
 Approved For Release 200             DP78-03061A000400060006-7
 patriots."  His most scathing remarks were directed against the PCV
 for its efforts to dissociate itself from the assassination.  He de=
 nounced the party leaders as vacillators, defeatists, cowards, and
 theorizing charlatans.   In a public reply the PCV called Castro's
 attack ignoble, self-seeking, and treacherous and rejected the "role
 of revolutionary pope that Fidel Castro asks for himself,"
 3.   The story is much the same in Colombia where the Cuban-backed
 ELN guerrilla group has made several spectacular attacks against govern-
 merit forces, for which the Communist Party of Colombia (PCC) gets the
 blame.   The PCC leaders are reportedly outraged by Castro's actions and
 are threatening to "break relations" with Havana.   In Guatemala the
 Cuban-backed guerrilla group, FAR, has been told by Havana that i:t will
 get; more support when it succeeds in taking control of the Guatemalan
 Communist Party by ousting "conservative" members of the Central Committee
 and replacing them with pro-Cas-:,roites.   Z'he "conservative" party leaders
 say they would rather disband the party than see it come under Castro's
 control.
 4.  Guerrilla fighting has now broken out in Bolivia.  First reports
 say that the guerrillas are partly Bolivian, partly "foreign", well
 armed, Cuban trained.   There are also reports that a guerrilla-minded
 faction is breaking away from the Brazilian Communist Party and planning
 an armed struggle, possibly with support; from Paraguayan Communists.
 5.  The philosophy behind the new Cuban offensive has been set forth
 in detail in a booklet titled "revolution Within the Revolution?"' by a
 French Communist, Regis Debray.   Debray is a young (26) high--school
 teacher who became infatuated with Castroism during a, visit 'to Cuba in
 1961. He made a tour of Latin America in 1961+, studying the experiences
 of the various Communist parties and guerrilla bands.   On the basis of
 his observations he published an article in Jean Paul. Sartre's Les Temps
 Modernes in January 1965, and a second in July 1965 in Revista, published
 in Havana.   These earned him an invitation to the Tn -Continental Confer-
 ence in Cuba where he has been ever since, except for a six-weeks' trip
 to the USSR in September-October 1966.   The central thesis of "Revolution
 Within the Revolution?" (as summarized in the New York Times on 16 March
 1967 -- Press Comment of 16  March 1967) is that "the relative failure
 of revolutionary guerrilla activities in Bolivia, Peru, Colombia,
 Guatemala and Venezuela in recent years can be attributed 'to their depen-
 dence on urban-based Communist parties for political direction and mater-
 ial support.. The new theory promulgated by Mr. Debray is that the
 political and military command of the revolution must be concentrated in
 the guerrilla movement, a mobile fighting unit, not, :Ln a city-based
 Communist party leadership."  Debray claims -that a new guerrilla movement
 operating on an international scale will soon arise in Latin America.
 6.   Several sources have reported that Debray is now Castro's favor-
 ed philosopher, which is not surprising since he expounds what Castro has

 ,1

 ,long asserted.   Debray's booklet was reprinted in_two separate Mexican
 leftist publications, ?olitica and Sucesos para Todos, and extensive
 abstracts of it have been broadcast in Creole from Havana to Haiti.
 25X1C10b
 7.  While attempting to launch new waves of guerrilla warfare across
 Latin America, Castro has bitterly criticized Moscow for its economic
 and diplomatic relations with the governments of Latin America, which he
 considers "trading with the enemy."  His views were bluntly stated in a
 speech on 13 March 1967 .(excerpts attached).   The speech also contained
 violent criticism of certain Soviet-lining Latin American Communist
 parties, notably.the Venezuelan party.   Altogether his actions have raised
 widespread belief that he is directly opposing the Soviets and acting
 contrary to their interests.
 8.  We cannot say with certainty to what degree., Castro is contra-
 vening Soviet interests -- i.e., Moscow's real policy objectives in
 Latin America, probably differing from ostensible Soviet diplomacy --
 nor what degree of control the Soviets can exercise over him.   However,
 for general propaganda purposes, it is usually in our interest to suggest
 or imply that Castro and the Soviets are acting in collusion and that the
 apparent bickering between them is either minor or planned.   There are
 useful arguments to support this'assertion:
 (a)  Moscow is not basically opposed to violence.  A recent broad-
 cast by Moscow's Radio Peace and Progress lauded the anniversary of the
 Tri-Continent Conference and gave honorable mention to. the guerrilla
 movements of Guatemala, Venezuela, and Colombia.   Pro-Moscow Venezuelan
 Communist Jesus Faria, as quoted by L'HUMANITE'on 17 March 1967 (copy
 attached), said that the PCV had started and was. continuing armed struggle;
 ""our, party has not envisaged, much less approved, the. abandonment of any
 .one whatsoever of these forms of struggle."
 (b)   Castro's violence casts the Soviet Union in the role of doves,
 a useful stance. for it in Latin America where it is attempting to expand
 its diplomatic.. and commercial contacts.   This sort of two-pronged offen-
 sive, of carrot.. and stick,.is normal for the Soviets.
 (c)   Castro could not exist without massive military and economic
 Soviet support.   If the Soviets viewed Castro's actions as seriously
 harmful, they could certainly devise a wide choice of means to make life
 considerably more uncomfortable for him, even if they cannot absolutely
 control his actions.   But there has been no known complaint from Moscow,
 no reduction in their subsidy --the 1967 trade agreement just concluded
 .promises; a 23% increase over last year's -- not even any subtle hints in
 Pravda; in short, no evidence of friction.

 Excerpts from speech by Finnish President Kekkonen at North Ostrobothnian
 Student Corporation festival in Helsinki on 4 February 1967
 The communists emerged from "underground" after the war and orga-
 nized large:political, trades and cultural movements.   There are commu-
 nists in the factories, local government councils, science and art,
 Parliament and parliamentary committees, now even in the government.
 They participate in the founding of universities and when the funds are
 made available they go abroad representing their country, and they are
 written about in the columns of even the so-called bourgeois press.  Is
 all this harmful to the country?  On the contrary, have not communists
 through their own organizations and by the force of their own idealism
 infused the country with, one would like to say, national spirit and
 vigour, a new belief in tomorrow and work for its good?  With the help
 of these organizations broader circles have been offered an active
 social life....
 The World Youth Festival was held in Helsinki in summer 1962.   I
 listened to its programme on the radio.   A group of young Finnish
 singers rendered the Finlandia hymn.   The participants were declared to
 be communists and there probably were many of them in this choral group.
 I heard them sing with bright voices:   "Arise Finland, raise high your
 head crowned with great memories, arise Finland, you showed the world
 that you rejected serfdom and that you did not succumb to oppression,
 your day will dawn, Oh native country."  I admit that I have seldom
 listened to the Finlandia hymn in a more receptive mood.  I wished at
 the time that as many Finnish bourgeois as possible were listening to
 the festival programme.
 In speaking of Finnish patriotism, it is my belief that Finland is
 held equally dear by Finnish communists as by other Finns.   The Finnish
 people would in fact be weak if every fourth citizen were an enemy of the
 native country.   Communists have, no doubt, another idea that their
 opponents of social and economic justice and its political implementa-
 tion.   Co-operation with the communists for the building of Finnish
 society thus means for those who think otherwise a clash of ideas.
 The man who believes in the fitness and vigour of his own idea will have
 the courage to follow it.

 President Kekkonen on the Role of the Communists:     CPYRGHT
 S PEAKING to students in Helsinki
 recently   on .  the  progress  of
 democracy  In Finland  over the past
 decades,  President  Urho Kekkonen
 stressed  the role of the Communist
 Party. With closetto a quarter of the
 electorate solidly behind them, the
 Communists represent a major political
 force In Finland today.
 The President pointed out that, the
 Communists share actively in the. work
 of public and government bodies, are
 represented in the Cabinet and act as
 Finland's spokesmen abroad.
 "Through their organizations and by
 the power of their conviction," said
 he, "the Communists have heightened
 the national spirit and brought a new
 ,:.,,:..,, And ennfidenee in the. mor-
 row. They  contribute  significantly to
 the common effort. This  draws ever
 wider sections of the population Into
 public activity."*
 Pronouncing himself for full equality
 of the Communists with other parfies,
 the President said: ,if is.essential for
 the peaceful development of our socie-
 ty to recognize the fundamental right
 of the people's democrats to share as
 equals and at government level in the
 administration of the state. For those
 who do not share their views, working
 with the Communists to build up our
 society involves a contest of ideas. This
 is a challenge that can be accepted
 only by those who have confidence in
 the viability and power of their own
 ideas.. "

 Peking (NCNA), 17 March 1967
 In defiance of the strong opposition by many member organizations of
 the council of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization and the
 revolutionary people in Asia and Africa, the illegal eighth council
 session of the organization held in Nicosia under the manipulation of the
 Soviet revisionists blatantly threw overboard the resolution,.adopted  by
 the 1965 Winneba conference on the convocation of the fifth Afro-Asian
 People's Solidarity Conference in Peking in 196'7, and arbitrarily decided
 to hold a bogus fifth conference in Algiers.  In this way, the Soviet
 revisionists have openly split the Afro-Asian people's movement for
 solidarity against imperialism, completely unmasked themselves and exposed
 their counterrevolutionary features to the broad light of day.
 Worming their way into the Afro-Asian people's solidarity movement,
 the Soviet revisionists have consistently followed a counterrevolutionary
 line of sham opposition to imperialism but real capitulation, sham support
 but real betrayal, sham unity but real split, and have done no end of evil.
 At the above-mentioned meeting they went to the length of using the most
 unscrupulous means, like a dying man in his last struggle.  Making use of
 this illegal meeting, they conducted a counterrevolutionary, antipopular,
 and anti-Chinese farce.  They caused this meeting to assume a hypocritical
 posture of "supporting Vietnam" to cover up their double-dealing in
 peddling the "peace talk" scheme for U.S. imperialism and splitting the
 Afro-Asian people's solidarity movement.  Organizationally, they recruited
 turncoats and renegades, drawing some people in while pushing out and
 attacking the revolutionaries.  They even called police to the meeting
 hall to intimidate revolutionary delegates, practicing fascist dictatorship
 over them.  The Afro-Asian people will never tolerate this.
 In order to change the venue of the fifth conference and accomplish
 their scheme of creating a split, the Soviet revisionists, in the course
 of the meeting, frantically slandered and attacked China's great
 proletarian cultural revolution and the great and invincible thought of
 Mao Tse-tung.  But they are like "mayflies lightly plotting to topple a
 giant tree."  The world-shaking great proletarian cultural revolution in
 China is encouraging the oppressed nations and peoples to rise up in
 rebellion and defeat imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of
 all countries.
 The brilliant thought of Mao Tse-tung is increasingly winning the
 hearts of the people.  It has illuminated the path of struggle for the
 revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the whole world and
 is guiding the world's people to complete liberation.  Even at this schis-
 matic and anti-Chinese Nicosia meeting manipulated by the Soviet revision-
 ists, delegates from such organizations as the South West African National
 Union,, the Bechuanaland People's Party, the Swaziland Progressive Party and

 the Basutoland Congress Party, inspired by the invincible thought of Mao
 Tse-tung, justly and sternly denounced the Soviet revisionists' crime of
 splitting the Afro-Asian people's solidarity movement and unhesitatingly
 withdrew from the meeting.  They held high the red-covered "Quotations
 From Chairman Mao Tse-tung" and spoke out the common desire of the Afro-
 Asian people:  "We want to be in Peking for the fifth Afro-Asian
 people's solidarity conference; we want to meet Chairman. Mao!"
 The Chinese people send revolutionary greetings to the African freedom
 fighters who are fearless before violence and dare to struggle.  The Chinese
 Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity reaffirms its statement issued on
 3 February 1967:  The Chinese people will not fail to meet the expectations
 of the Afro-Asian peoples and are determined to convene the fifth Afro-
 Asian people's solidarity conference in Peking in 1967.  We hereby formally
 announce that the Chinese preparatory committee for the fifth Afro-Asian
 people's solidarity conference has been officially set up.  It will under-
 take preparations for the fifth conference with friends from all countries
 who uphold the revolutionary line of solidarity against imperialism.  The
 Chinese people warmly invite friends from the Asian and African countries
 to come to Peking, the bulwark of the world struggle against imperialism,
 and to make common  efforts to insure that the fifth Afro-Asian. people's
 solidarity conference is revolutionary, militant, united, and successful.
 It must be pointed out that the present permanent Secretariat of the
 Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization in Cairo is already in the
 control of the Soviet revisionists.  Correct propositions put forth by the
 secretaries of the different countries, who defend the revolutionary line
 of solidarity against imperialism and stand for what-is just, have'long
 been arbitrarily suppressed.  As a matter of fact, the permanent Secretariat
 has already degenerated into a tool of the Soviet revisionists for imple-
 menting their counterrevolutionary line.                  We therefore declare that we shall
 henceforth have nothing to do with this organ.
 The Soviet revisionist leading clique has betrayed the October revolu-
 tion, consistently undermined the national liberation movement of the Afro-
 Asian people, and acted as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism.
 Now it has split from the Afro-Asian people's solidarity movement so that
 it can be of more use to U.S. imperialism and sell out the Afro-Asian
 people's cause of solidarity against imperialism.  With the removal of
 this cancer -- the Soviet revisionists -- the Afro-Asian people's cause
 of solidarity against imperialism will undergo a sounder development and
 forge ahead more vigorously.   "Past the sunken boat, a thousand vessels
 sail; beyond the withered. tree, ten thousand. saplings spring."  A
 completely new solidarity movement against imperialism which really gives
 expression to the revolutionary aspirations of the Afro-Asian people will
 surely come into being.  Let the new czars in the Kremlin who are in
 mortal fear of the Afro-Asian people's cause of solidarity against imperi-
 alism wail and tremble:

 The great leader of the Chinese people Chairman Mao has said:
 "People of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their
 running dogs!  People of the world, be courageous, dare to fight, defy
 difficulties, and advance wave upon wave.  Then the whole world will
 belong to the people.  Monsters of all kinds shall be destroyed."
 Everywhere in Asia and Africa, there now appears an inspiring vista
 of militant struggle. The revolutionary people of the two continents
 are rising, regrouping their. forces, and advancing rapidly along the
 road of independence and liberation.  With the force of an avalanche and
 the power of a thunderbolt, they will certainly bring to bear their full
 strength against imperialism, colonialism and neocolonialism headed by
 the United States, modern revisionism, and all monsters sand freaks and
 eventually bury them all.  A new Asia and Africa, radiant with splendor,
 will certainly appear on the horizon.  The fifth Afro-Asian people's
 solidarity conference to be held in Peking will be a clarion call to the
 Afro-Asian people to battle for new victory.  All people of Asia and
 Africa who want independence and liberation, unite, form the broadest
 possible genuine anti-U.S. united front to fight for the realization of
 our great common goal!

 Radio Moscow,- ll March 1967
 (Statement by Professor Georgiy Kim,executive member of the Soviet Afro-
 Asian Solidarity Committee, member of the Soviet delegation at the Nicosia
 meeting of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Organization.)
 The Nicosia council meeting of AAPSO was held during an alarming
 situation when the military machine of the largest imperialist power, the
 United States, was cruelly crushing our sister nation, Vietnam.  The events
 now taking place in Vietnam deeply concern all peoples of.all continents..
 The U.S. aggression in.Vietnam is nothing but an attempt by interna-
 tional imperialism to launch a counteroffensive against the revolutionary
 and national liberation forces.  That was why the delegations of practically
 all countries represented at. the council meeting -- and more than 50
 countries attended -- attached so much importance to the Vietnam problem.
 All the speakers clearly realized the urgency of stepping up practical aid
 to the Vietnamese people.
 The meeting gave a warm reception to the head of the Soviet delegation
 Mr. Pimenov, who described the diverse aid the USSR is rendering the frater-
 nal Vietnamese people.  The council session also paid due attention to the
 support given to the liberation if the peoples of Angola, Mozambique,
 Portuguese Guinea, and South Arabia.  It stressed the urgency of a more
 decisive struggle against racism.
 An indicator of the majority feeling within the Afro-Asian solidarity
 movement was the desire of the council participants to effectively remove
 everything that interferes with the movement's unity.  At present the
 world anti-imperialist movement is going through many difficulties because
 of the splitting activities of the Mao Tse-tung group.
 Incidentally, attempts were made at the Nicosia meeting to break up
 the meeting on instructions from that group.  The brazen behavior of two men
 who posed as NCNA correspondents but who had arrived in Nicosia to inter-
 fere with the normal working of the Afro-Asian forum was met with outrage.
 They urged a group of African students studying in West Europe to try to
 use the meeting for slander, similar to that used by the Hung Weiping,
 against AAPSO.  But this noisy group represented no one and was severely
 reprimanded by the chairman of the Cyprus solidarity committee and the
 meeting's chairman, Dr. Vassos Lissaridhis.   The group had to leave the
 conference hall.  At the persistent demands of the majority at the meeting
 the.group was expelled from the solidarity meeting.  The splitters' voices
 were in discord in the general stream of demands for the movement's unity.
 Delegates from Angola, Madagascar, and Sudan, among many other countries,
 decisively denounced those who place their narrow selfish interests above
 the holy task of the common struggle.

 It is no secret that U.S. imperialism is now placing special hopes
 upon: differences and a division in the ranks of the revolutionary anti-
 imperialist forces.  It was for precisely this reason that the partici-
 pants in the meeting in Nicosia declared that all who hold these great
 ideals dear must rally in one rank.  There is no more important task
 today than reaching unity in the struggle against the aggressive designs
 of imperialism.  All participants showed they clearly understood that
 the successes of the national liberation movement are closely linked to
 support from the socialist countries.  The desire for unity was also
 expressed in the council's decision to shift the seat of the next, fifth,
 AAPSO conference to Algiers.  Earlier, the place was to be Peking, but many
 national committees have asked that the conference be held in another
 country as the conditions in China are not conducive for successful. work.
 Let us go to Algiers under the slogan. of unity of our ranks.  Let us
 preserve and strengthen our movement which. is called upon to play an
 important role in the nation's struggle for freedom, independence., and
 social progress.

 A BID FOR PEACE...
 Full text of a letter-dated February 2 and
 m de public March 21-that President Lyndon
 J , nson sent to President Ho Chi Minh of Com-
 l  ,
 mu' Est North Vietnam:
 rear Mr. President:
 am writing to you in the hope that the conflict in Viet-
 np#}m can be brought to an end. That conflict has already
 taken a heavy toll-in lives lost, in wounds inflicted, in
 property destroyed and in simple human misery. If we fail
 to find a just and peaceful solution, history will judge us
 harshly.
 Therefore, I believe that we both have a heavy obligation
 to seek earnestly the path to peace. It is in response to that
 obligation that I am writing directly to you.
 We have tried over the past several years, in a variety
 of ways and through a number of channels, to convey to
 you and your colleagues our desire to achieve a peaceful
 settlement. For whatever reasons, these efforts have not
 achieved any results.
 It may be that our thoughts and yours, our attitudes and
 yours, have been distorted or misinterpreted as they passed
 through these various channels. Certainly that is always a
 danger in indirect communication.
 There is one good way to overcome this problem and to
 move forward in the search for a peaceful settlement. That
 is for us to arrange for direct talks between trusted repre-
 sentatives in a secure setting and away from the glare of
 publicity. Such talks should not be used as a propaganda
 exercise, but should be a serious effort to find a workable
 and mutually acceptable solution.
 In the past two weeks, I have noted public statements
 by representatives of your Government suggesting that you
 would be prepared to enter into direct bilateral talks with
 representatives of the U. S. Government, provided that we
 ceased "unconditionally" and permanently our bombing op-
 erations against your country and all military actions against
 it. In the last day, serious and responsible parties have as-
 sured us indirectly that this is, in fact, your proposal.
 Let me frankly state that I see two great difficulties with
 this proposal. In view of your public position, such action
 on our part would inevitably produce worldwide specula-
 tion that discussions were under way and would impair the
 privacy and secrecy of those discussions. Secondly, there
 would inevitably be grave concern on our part whether your
 Government would make use of such action by us to im-
 prove its military position.
 With these problems in mind, I am prepared to 'move
 even further toward an ending of hostilities than your Gov-
 ernment has proposed in either public statements or through
 private diplomatic charnels. I am prepared to order a cessa-
 tion of bombing against your country and the stopping of
 further augmentation of United States forces in South Viet-
 nam as soon as I am assured that infiltration into South
 Vietnam by land and by sea has stopped. These acts of re-
 straint on both sides would, I believe, make it possible for
 us to conduct serious and private discussions leading toward
 an early peace..
 I make this proposal to you now with a specific sense of
 urgency arising from the imminent new-year holidays in
 Vietnam. If you are able to accept this proposal, I see no
 reason why it could not take effect at the end of the new-
 year, or Tet, holidays.
 The proposal I have made would be greatly strengthened
 if your military authorities and those of the Government
 of South Vietnam could ' promptly negotiate an extension of
 the Tet truce.
 As to the site of the bilateral discussions. I propose, there
 are several possibilities. We could, for example, have our
 representatives meet in Moscow where contacts have already
 occurred. They could meet in some other country, such as
 Burma. You may have other arrangements or sites in mind,
 and I would try to meet your suggestions.
 The important thing is to end a conflict that has brought
 burdens to both our peoples, and, above all, to the people
 of South Vietnam. If you have any thoughts about the ac-
 tions I propose, it would be most important that I receive
 them as soon as possible.
 Sincerely,
 Lyndon B. Johnson

 latter. This was sent to Mr. Johnson on February
 1 and its contents broadcast by the Vietnam
 Iws Agency on March 21:
 Your Excellency:
 On Feb. 10, 1967, I received your message. This is my
 reply:
 Vietnam is thousands of miles away from the United
 States. The Vietnamese people have never done any harm
 to the United States. But, contrary to the pledges made by
 its representative at the 1954 Geneva Conference, the U. S.
 Government has ceaselessly intervened in Vietnam. It has
 unleashed and intensified the war of aggression in South
 Vietnam with a view to prolonging the partition of Vietnam
 and turning South Vietnam into a neocolony and a mili-
 tary base of the United States. For over two years now, the
 U. S. Government has, with its air and naval forces, carried
 the war to the Democratic Republic of [North] Vietnam, an
 independent and sovereign country,
 The U. S. Government has committed war crimes, crimes
 against peace and against mankind. In South Vietnam, half
 a million U. S. and satellite troops have resorted to the most
 inhuman weapons and the most barbarous methods of war-
 fare, such as napalm, toxic chemicals and gases, to massacre
 our compatriots, destroy crops, and raze villages to the
 ground.
 In North Vietnam, thousands of U. S. aircraft have
 CPYRGHT
 CPYRGHT
 dropped hundreds of thousands o tons ot bombs, destroying
 towns, villages, factories, schools.
 In your message, you apparently deplored the sufferings
 and destruction in Vietnam.
 May I ask you: Who has perpetrated these monstrous
 crimes? It is the U. S. and satellite troops. The U. S. Govern-
 ment is entirely responsible for the extremely serious situa-
 tion in Vietnam.
 The U. S. war of aggression against the Vietnamese people
 constitutes a challenge to the countries of the socialist
 camp, a threat to the national independence movement, and
 a serious danger to peace in Asia and the world.
 The Vietnamese people deeply love independence, free-
 dom and peace.
 But, in the face of the U. S. aggression, they have risen up,
 united as one man, fearless of sacrifices and hardships. T144311"
 are determined to carry on their resistance until they hay.,
 won genuine independence and freedom and true peace.
 Our just cause enjoys strong sympathy and support from the
 peoples of the whole world, including broad sections of the
 American people.
 The U. S. Government has unleashed the war of aggression
 in Vietnam. It must cease this aggression. That is the only
 way to the restoration of peace. The U. S. Government must
 stop definitively and unconditionally its bombing raids and
 all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of
 Vietnam, withdraw from South Vietnam all U. S. and satel-
 lite troops, recognize the South Vietnam National Front for
 Liberation, and, let the Vietnamese people settle themselves
 their own affairs. Such is the basis (sic) content of the five-
 point stand of the Government of the Democratic Republic
 of Vietnam, which embodies the essential principles and
 provisions of the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Vietnam. It
 is the basic (sic) of a correct political solution to the Viet-
 nam problem.
 In your message, you suggested direct talks between tjgmL
 Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the United States.-
 the U. S. Government really wants these talks, it must first
 of all stop unconditionally its bombing raids and all other
 acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It
 is only after the unconditional cessation of the U. S. bomb-
 ing raids and all other acts of war against the Democratic
 Republic of Vietnam that the Democratic Republic of Viet-
 nam and the United States could enter into talks and dis-
 cuss questions concerning the two sides.
 The Vietnamese people will never submit to force, they
 will never accept talks under the threat of bombs.
 Our cause is absolutely just. It is to be hoped that the
 U. S. Government will act in accordance with reason.
 Sincerely,
 Ho Chi Minh

 As Southeast Asia reads the future after the exchange of letters between
 B'esident Johnson of the U.S. and President Ho of Communist North Vietnam....
 There is almost no chance at all of a negotiated peace in Vietnam.
 > > "Hanoi cannot negotiate!"  That is what our staff man hears in Bangkok.
 Communist rule in North Vietnam is based on a promise to conquer the South.
 North Vietnam alone is overpopulated, poor.  Russia will not and Red China
 cannot make the North an industrial state.   It needs the South's rice and land.
 Hanoi's Red bureaucracy--the 300,000 to 400,000 who run the dictatorship--
 may now see that they cannot win the war in the South.  But old men are clinging
 to old ideas.  Ho.is 76.  His aides are mainly in their 60s and 70s.  Bangkok's
 experts say these men will not risk peace talks--ever.
 > > What about a slowdown of the war if Hanoi's Reds get more punishment than
 they can bear?  That's possible, say Southeast Asians who know Hanoi's leaders.
 Even then, they''6ay, negotiations are not likely. Hanoi's old men may
 one day let war run down, send fewer combat troops south.  But talks?  No.
 > > Keep this in mind about President Johnson's offer to halt U.S. bombing of
 the North if Ho's men will quit sending troops into war in the South....
 Ho has never admitted his Northerners are in combat in South Vietnam.
 True, there is evidence enough to convince all save die-hard Reds.  But Ho is
 not likely to talk about quitting what he has never admitted doing.

 base camps in a major sweep.  The intelligence haul adds up to this:
 200,000 pages of documents concerning Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Red
 operations in South Vietnam.  140 reels of motion-picture films, plus many still
 photographs of North Vietnamese regulars commanding and fighting in the South.
 Letters, diaries telling how, when and where Hanoi's troops are operating.
 > > Conclusions of U.S. intelligence men checking over the evidence in Saigon:
 North Vietnamese regulars are 40 per cent of Red main forces in the South.
 A North Vietnamese general has, run the war in the South for over two years.
 So-called "National Liberation Front" of South Vietnamese Reds turns out
 to be only a facade for Hanoi's Reds.  The NLF issues no orders in the South,
 has no chain of command, military or political, no.real power in South Vietnam.

 itself in world opinion. Rusk
 told a news conference, "The

 being mystified by the uncom-

 Vietnam's foes to all peace pro-
 posals, including the plan which
 U Thant,, United Nations Secre-
 tary General, made public yes-
 terday.
 Canvassed for  explanations
 for Hanoi's  adamant stand,
 some of them suggested today
 that it may be dictated by Com-
 munist China, North Vietnam's
 chief supplier of arms, ammuni-
 tion and food.
 Czechoslovakian Radio
 They cited, in that connection,
 a March 26 broadcast by Cze-
 choslovakia's radio that called
 for a "compromise" between
 Hanoi and Washington and ad-
 ded:
 "Unfortunately, Vietnam is si-
 tuated too close to China, and
 Chinese advice does not always
 go unheeded."
 Others, stressing the current
 upward  trend  in  defections
 among the Communist-led for-
 ces in Vietnam, suggested Han-
 oi has to broadcast denuncia-
 tions of all peace proposals in
 order to prevent disintegration
 of those forces.
 But. most were. disposed to
 second what Dean Rusk, Secre-
 tary of -State,%said at a press
 the leaders in Hanoi. on a mat-'
 ter of that sort," Rusk replied,
 adding:
 "I would suppose, really, that
 they are under some misappre-
 hension. They are making some
 misjudgments and miscalcula-
 tions on some point-either the
 state of international opinion or
 the state of opinion within the
 United States.
 "It's possible even' that OR-W-l
 still have some slender hopes of
 some military success in the
 South .:. but ... the principal
 pillars of their hopes are erod-
 ing from under them, and they
 should  become interested in
 peace... at an early date and
 not at some long delayed future
 date."
 Private Efforts
 Rusk prefaced all that by
 stressing 'that Hanoi's scornful
 publication March 21 of a there-
 tofore secret peace proposal
 mzde.February 8 by President
 Johnson and Thant's avowedly
 reluctant publication 'yesterday

 now in agreement," he said, ad-
 ding that "there is nothing in

 HANOI'S REJECTION OF U.S. PROPOSAL
 Ho Chi Minh's letter rejecting a U.S. peace bid was seen by the
 foreign press as a propaganda failure for North Vietnam.                 Editors said
 Ho had "slammed the door" on negotiations in his bitter reply, thereby
 enhancing Mr. Johnson's position as a peace seeker.
 The Washington correspondent of Munich's left-center SUEDDEUTSCHE
 ZEITUNG declared:   "President Johnson can expect an improvement in
 the domestic political climate for his Vietnam policy....  Although
 the State Department has regretted the disclosure, Ho Chi Minh no
 doubt has rendered Johnson a great service..."
 Right-of-center FRANKFURTHER ALLGEMEINE said Ho had rendered "a
 great political service by depicting Mr. Johnson as a man who does
 not exploit his peace efforts for propaganda purposes, and lays
 himself open to charges.of inactivity rather than let his peace
 feelers be jeopardized by premature disclosure."
 Ho's.action was"tantamount to blowing up a bridge that has been
 established with great difficulty," the paper said, "Useful pre-
 parations for peace talks have been destroyed.   The most valuable
 capital involved was the secrecy of the contacts in Moscow and via
 Moscow.   Such a breach of confidence is not easy to repair."
 Independent-right STUTTGARTER ZEITUNG asserted:
 "Some of the President's critics at home will appreciate the
 fact that Johnson is really trying to bring about a peaceful settle-
 ment, and that the continued course of the conflict is dictated by
 the stubbornness and relentlessness of the North Vietnamese, more
 than anything else."
 Pro-Christian Democratic MUENCHNER MERKUR of Munich judged:   "By
 disclosing the exchange of letters, Ho Chi Minh has not only proved
 himself inaccessible even to the most reasonable offers, but he has
 slammed the door to negotiations for the foreseeable future.   He
 has pulled the rug from under the feet of America's doves."
 Influential DIE WELT of Hamburg said Ho's "icy no" was "a capital
 mistake," to be contrasted 'with President Johnson's "remarkably cir-
 cumspect" letter, which did "not contain anything that might be
 interpreted as reflecting arrogance of power..."
 In London, the conservative DAILY MAIL said:
 Mr. Johnson's letter was "couched in terms of almost abasing
 moderation and avoidance of self-righteousness," while Ho Chi

 Minh offered "nothing but the old, stale agitprop slogans, the
 old lies, the old claims to represent the entire Vietnamese
 people, the old inflexible refusal of any kind of moderation."
 The GUARDIAN's Washington correspondent reported that the publica-
 tion of the letters "has made a considerable impact here.   It has
 gone a long way towards convincing critics of the Administration of
 two points -- that they have been less than just to the President
 in calling into question the seriousness with which he has been
 seeking to bring Hanoi to the conference table, and that they have
 been unwarrantably optimistic about; the readiness of Ho Chi Minh
 to negotiate."
 In Italy, Rome's independent-center MESSAGGERO carried a report
 from New York that "Johnson and the Democratic Administration come
 out of this looking very good indeed....  We see a new Johnson here.
 He endured unjust attacks rather than seek short-range popularity.
 His hope was that his silence would help negotiations."
 Influential CORRIERE DELLA SERA of Milan said:
 "Johnson emerges strengthened from this, and his critics have
 been weakened....   It would have been easy for Johnson to
 answer Senator Kennedy and the Democratic Party's left wing by
 publishing this exchange of letters.   Some White House advisers
 counseled this, but Johnson refused rather than compromise
 talks with Vietnam.   It is a paradox that Hanoi has helped
 Johnson by revealing all this."
 Christian Democratic POPOLO, Rome, said that "at least, a first con-
 tact has been made....   The doors to an honorable peace are at least
 open."  Independent-conservative RESTO DEL CARLINO of Bologna
 declared:   "The impression is that all that is needed to get nego-
 tiations under way is a brit of courage on each side in taking a
 first step."
 French papers were mystified and dismayed at Hanoi's action.   Con-
 servative FIGARO'S Washington correspondent asked:   "Doesn't
 Mr. Ho Chi Minh understand that he has just singularly simplified
 Mr. Johnson's task?  One is struck with dismay at such misappre-
 hension of the psychology of the mass of American people.   Once
 again the two adversaries give the impression of living on two dif-
 ferent planets.   This hardly permits much optimism."
 Moderate-right LA CROIX demanded:   "Why did Hanoi believe it oppor-
 tune to make the exchange of letters public while, most evidently,
 only secret diplomacy can reach a compromise?"

 Elite LE MONDE said Hanoi had "put itself in the wrong" in American
 eyes, while Mr. Johnson's letter would be credited as "evidence of
 goodwill on the domestic propaganda level."  The U.S. was "waging
 the war in order to reach a 'Korean solution' embellished with a
 few harmless concessions in order to help Hanoi to retreat....  The
 response from Hanoi has made it clear that there cannot be any
 possible deal in this perspective.   This may not be a surprise for
 Washington, but it is nevertheless & shock.  The war will continue
 to downright barbarity."
 The paper added:   "This is no good news for the White House, which
 officially takes refuge behind 'limited objectives' -- limited to
 a continent -- in order to preach patience to the Americans."
 Belgium's HET VOLK of Ghent accused Ho of an act of "diplomatic
 vandalism" by which "a number of previously open channels have been
 closed.
 "What does Ho do"?  He waits until the truce is over and even
 lets the extra day Johnson offered him go by.  Only after the
 bombings have been resumed from sheer necessity does he send
 his answer, stating that he cannot negotiate 'under pressure
 of American bombing.'
 "Now he crowns that destructive action by bringing everything
 out into the open.   Not only have contacts via Moscow or Ran-
 goon, as was proposed by Johnson, become useless, but future
 contacts via other channels are considerably  hindered in view
 of the danger of premature publication and use for enemy
 propaganda."
 Center=oriented DER BUND of Bern said the text of Mr. Johnson's
 message "shows convincingly that,.this time at least, it was an
 absolutely honest, aboveboard, and realistic attempt.   Doubters of
 American sincerity and readiness to negotiate havehad the wind
 taken out of their sails -- and by Hanoi itself, which first broke
 the silence."
 The Washington correspondent of the prestigious NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG
 said the North Vietnamese action "significantly strengthens the
 President's position vis-a-vis all his American critics, and it
 can hardly do Hanoi any good....   One has the feeling that Hanoi
 is burning its bridges."
 Ho's conduct, the paper judged, "is the more: inscrutable since the
 revelation of this exchange of letters seems to benefit Johnson."
 The latter's message "is proof of the earnestness with which he
 has followed the peace line of his double course."

 Conservative SVENSKA DAGBLADET of Stockholm said channels for con-
 tacts had been damaged but the new situation had "certain advantages"
 for Washington:  "Critics of the U.S. have made a great point; of
 the Americans' coolness to peace feelers presumably made by North
 Vietnam.  While the factual basis for such soundings was doubtful to
 say the least, Ho Chi Minh has now personally confirmed that
 Johnson actually did make a concrete proposal."
 In Australia.,, the;- Sydney MORNING HERALD found the "most disturb-
 ing feature of President Ho''s letter was precisely the tone of arro-
 gance....   There is little doubt that President Johnson is prepared
 to take the harder measures his military advisers have long been
 urging.   No other course seems to be! open to him...."
 "But the balance sheet is not entirely on the debit side.  A meet-
 ing place has been arranged and may be used again.   The Americans
 and the Russians have shown their desire to put an end to killing.
 The North Vietnamese have registered their conditions.   The military
 strategists might subject them to a cool, careful review."
 Hanoi's role has at last been clarified, the NEW ZEALAND HERALD of
 Auckland said:
 "The fiction that North Vietnam is only a minor participant
 is no longer maintained.   The Hanoi regime emerges clearly as
 the principal with which a settlement must be reached."
 ASAHI, however, insisted that "the disclosure at this time of an
 abortive secret contact is not a useful factor toward settlement"
 of the conflict, "for it appears to be the renewed expression of
 Hanoi's firm resolve...  This is pessimistic material for peace."
 The HINDU of Madras said:   "The correspondence makes it clear that
 Hanoi is not prepared to embark on peace negotiations with the Ameri-
 cans which would involve the closing of the frontier between North
 and South Vietnam and the denial of recognition to the Viet Cong7as
 the only spokesmen of South Vietnamese nationalism.   Hanoi is evi-
 dently confident that the Viet Cong, which it controls and directs,
 will win the allegiance of the South Vietnamese people and keep the
 American forces at bay.
 "In spite of the stepping up of the air raids on the north, the
 North Vietnamese believe that victory will ultimately be theirs."

 April 1967
 Background of relations between the CPSU party and intellectuals in the
 Soviet Union, 1946 to early 19
 The role of Andrey Zhdanov in Party-intellectual relationships was
 of great importance between 1946 and the death of Stalin.  With some
 fluctuations in intensity, Zhdanov throttled free expression and at-
 tempted to harness writers to the service of the state.   He assaulted
 "cosmopolitanism," an action equivalent to anti-Semitism.  Although he
 died in 1948, his influence was such that the entire period from 1946
 to 1953 was known as the "zhdanovshchina," a synonym for cultural terror.
 Thus, the mention in IZVESTIYA of 25 Feb 66 of Zhdanov on his 70th birth-
 day as "a true son of the people" could well be interpreted as a threat,
 by the regime to increase its restrictive measures unless the intellec-
 tuals get back into line.
 Upon Stalin's death a short-lived surge in freer intellectual ex-
 pression was observed.   It was curtailed in mid-1953, resumed in 1954,
 accelerated in early 1956, halted in late 1956, reversed in mid-1957,
 expanded in 1959, halted in late 1962, cautiously resumed in mid-1963
 after which it increased somewhat until October 1964 when Khrushchev was
 ousted.
 During the first 4 months of the regime of Brezhnev and Kosygin the
 intellectuals substantially stepped up their outpouring of anti-Stalinist
 expression.
 The first sign of a reaction against the intellectuals was detected
 in early March, 1965, in a published report of the RSFSR Writers' Con-
 gress.   There, to gasps or dismay from the liberals, Soviet literature
 and films were criticized by the conservatives who quoted the Chinese
 Communists.   From then on, an increasingly bitter exchange between the
 more liberal and the conservative organs was witnessed.   It was capped
 and epitomized by two articles, one by Sergei Pavlov, the head of the
 Komsomol, and the other,?by the 60-year-old Aleksey Rumyantsev, the chief
 editor of PRAVDA.  Pavlov, writing in PRAVDA of 29 Aug, lashed out at
 movies, literature, and the theater for the unhealthy criticism which
 was engendering "nihilism" in youth, and he pointed out the need for
 caution in dealing with the cult of the personality (i.e., attacks on
 Stalin).  Rumyantsev in PRAVDA of 9 September, apparently in rebuttal
 to Pavlov and others, stated his belief that nihilism is engendered by
 hushing up and glossing over difficulties, not by the passionate effort
 to expose wron s in order to set them right; to underscore the meaning
 of his words, he went down the list of the liberals under attack and de-
 fended them.
 Within the next 10 to 12 days, Sinyavsky and Daniel were picked up
 by the KGB, and Rumyantsev was removed from his job,   (Rumyantsev now
 has an insignificant job with the Academy of Sciences.)  Pavlov, on the
 other hand, is still the chief of the Komsomol and he has spoken out

 further in the vein of the hard. line.  The hard line, especially in
 IZVESTIYA, became dominant and more strident in Soviet media.  In
 January in PRAVDA, for the first time in years, "cosmopolitanism" was
 referred to as something to be fought.  And, seemingly to 'bring the
 circle to a close, the above-noted reference to Zhd.anov was made in
 IZVESTIYA.
 Some feeble opposition to the above.-noted trend. has been ob-
 served.  NOVY MIR, the liberal writers' organ, has defied the implied
 ban on publication of unacceptable material.  Individual writers, such
 as Paustovskiy, have protested against the Sinyavsk.y and Daniel case.
 And PRAVDA held back for some time before joining the ranks of the hard
 liners attacking the two.  PRAVDA also commemorated. the 20th Party Con-
 gress, implicitly supporting de-Stalinization; but it also praised
 Zhdanov.

 A     1967
 Background to Soviet Writers Congress
 The first three Writers Congress were held in 1934, 1954, and 1959
 under circumstances either favorable or not unfavorable to the Soviet
 regime.  Careful preparations'by Stalin's regime were started two years
 before the 1934 Congress.   The 1954 Congress was held at a time when
 writers had been restrained once again after having enjoyed immediately
 after Stalin's death a short respite from the tight control of the Party.
 The 1959 Congress took place at a time when the writers and the regime
 were on relatively good terms with one another.
 In spite of these circumstances, some differences between the writers
 and the regime were allowed to rise to the surface.  At the 1954.CQn-
 gress several writers commented boldly on the flood of trashy literature;
 this was the first skirmish between Party and intellectuals after the
 long period of Stalinist suppression and terror.   In 1959, at the Third
 Congress, whereas proceedings appeared to run smoothly several well-
 known authors'published biting articles in the press in defense of creative
 freedom.
 .The fourth Writers Congress, now scheduled to begin on May 22, 1967,
 was due originally in 1963, four years after the Third Congress.   In the
 fall of 1964, immediately after Khrushchev's ouster, public references
 were made to writers' expectations that the next congress would be held in
 early 1965.   The largest republic in the USSR, the RSFSR, held its Writers
 Congress, evidently in the expectation that the national congress would
 be held shortly thereafter.  Again in the winter of 1965 references were
 made to the effect that writers expected their national congress to be
 held in the middle of that year.   In early 1966 Aleksey Markov, a secre-
 tary of the Writers Union, said that the congress would be held in June
 of that year.  (Pravda, January 28, 1966) Finally, it was announced in
 the fall of 1966 that the Writers Congress would be held before the end of
 the year.  (Pravda, September 19, 1966)
 This record,of frequent postponements of the Writers Congress is reason
 enough to raise doubts that the most recently announced congress will
 actually take place.  Adding to these doubts is a series of developments
 since the Sinyavsky-Daniel trial of February 1966, including:
 -the events at the 23rd Congress of the CPSU in March-April 1966,
 when the "liberal" authors were virtually excluded and the Stalinist voice
 on literature was prominently featured (as contrasted to the preceding
 Party Congress in 1962, when Aleksandr Tvardovsky, the outstanding liberal,
 gave the address which was regarded as representing writers' views),;
 -a growing effort by intellectuals from many spheres of creative
 activity in the USSR  to protest at the highest levels against the
 Sinyavsky-Daniel trial and restalinization, and against the restraints..
 imposed on the freedom of thought in the USSR;

 Cont.

 -The Soviet regime's apparently continuing dissatisfaction with
 the production of literary works in general, as evidenced by its refusal
 to present any Lenin Prize awards for literature in 1965 and 1966, and
 its nomination in 1967 of only two relatively little-known poets for such
 awards;
 -a significnat reduction in the number and boldness of published
 literary works by "liberal" authors;
 -a concerted effort to strip NOVY MIR (NEW WORLD) of its leader-
 ship and thus (it is widely conjectured) to quiet the voice of that
 widely respected literary journal which has. been the main vehicle for
 liberal writers (see the Literary Supplement to the London TIMES, March 2,
 1967, and the ECONOMIST, March 11, 1967).
 Opposing all the above reasons for doubting that the Writers Congress
 will take place as scheduled is the fanfare given the announcement in
 LITERATURNAY GAZETA (LITERARY GAZETTE) No. 1, 1967 and the press con-
 ference on the Congress which took place on 3 January 1967'.  Although
 Soviet press coverage since then has been sparse and uninformative, there
 are no concrete indications that the Congress will be postponed once
 again.
 Considering the likelihood that the proceedings at the Congress will
 be as difficult as ever to decipher, it will be useful to bear in mind
 the source of the comments reported at the Congress.  For this purpose,
 the names and positions of a number of the most prominent representatives
 of the Stalinists and the "liberals" are presented below.
 The Stalinists, or hard-liners, are:
 -Vsevolod Kochetov, editor of the arch-conservative journal
 OKTYABR (OCTOBER)
 -Nikolay Gribachev, author
 -Vadim Kozhevnikov, author
 -Anatoly Safronov, playwright
 -Mikhail Sholokhov, author (awarded Nobel Prize for literature in
 1965; delivered scathing denunciation of Sinyavsky and Daniel at 23rd
 Congress of the CPSU, thereby earning the undying disgust of liberal
 writers)
 -Aleksey Markov, Secretary of Writers Union
 -Sergey Pavlov, Chief of the Komsomol (scorned by liberal writers
 for his unrestrained denunciation of Pasternak)

 -Gen. Aleksey Yepishev, Chief of Main Political Administration of
 Soviet Army and Navy (an outspoken critic of the harm done to Soviet
 youth by the works of liberal authors)
 -Marshal Nikolay Krylov, Chief of Soviet Rocket Forces (a critic
 of "liberals")
 On the "liberals" side the outstanding figure is Aleksandr Tvardovsky.
 Tvardovsky was the leader of the intellectuals' resistance to Khrushchev's
 1962-63 compaign to harness writers to tasks of the state.   He has been
 buffeted by increasingly sharper criticism by Stalinists for the past
 year.    This criticism reached a peak on March 29, 1967 when PRAVDA,
 IZVESTIYA, and LITERATURNAYA GAZETA joined in unprecedented unison to
 rebuke Tvardovsky for ignoring previous rebukes; Tvardovsky, refusing to
 recant, merely acknowledged that he had heard the criticism.
 -Andrey Voznesensky, poet
 -Konstantin Simonov, author who recently refused to having his war-
 time memoirs edited by those who objected to the anti-Stalinist content of
 his manuscript
 -Vladimir Tendryakov, author
 -Viktor Nekrasov, author
 -Aleksandr Solzhenitsin, author
 -Ilya Ehrenburg, author ( a well-liked figure amongst "liberals"
 because of his steadfast pursuit of truth)
 -Vasily Aksenov, poet
 -Konstantin Paustovsky, writer
 -Bela Akhmadulina, poetess
 -Korney Chukovsky, writer
 -Lidiya Chukovskaya, daughter of the aforementioned and a bitter
 foe of Stalinist Sholokhov
 -Yury Kazakov, writer
 Considering that the Writers Congress may turn out to be a meaningful
 event in the long struggle between Soviet writers and the regime, and
 that all of the members of thw Writers Union are aware of this possibility,
 any absences by prominent liberal writers should be looked at with skepti-
 cism.

 Excerpts from interview with Jesus Faria, "L'HUMANITE", .17 March 1967
 --What is your view of the present situation in Venezuela?
 About two years ago the Venezuelan Communist Party, which is
 the avant-garde of our people, proposed the formation of a democratic
 government with the objective of reestablishing peace in our country.
 That was a demand and an order which conformed to the interest of the
 working class and the laboring masses.
 Contrary to what may have been written and said, this proposal
 was not aimed at reaching a compromise.   It enveloped in reality a
 patriotic and concrete objective of national liberation.  What we want
 is peace and democracy, a plan for the democratic development of the
 riches of our country.
 But the government replied like any government devoted to the
 interests of imperialism: by new imprisonments, by an increased repres-
 sion, by the suppression of the most elementary constitutional rights,
 by the occupation of the University of Caracas, by a reinforcement of the
 government's 'bloody repressive apparatus....
 --Under these conditions, what are the prospects for, the future
 for the Venezuelan people?
 There is absolutely no possibility of agreement with the present
 Venezuelan government, within which we see no indication of a change of
 policy....
 --What are the different forms of struggle employed by the Venezuelan
 Communists?
 The Venezuelan Communists are fighting on all fronts, putting
 into practice all forms of- struggle, including armed struggler   We un-
 leashed this four years ago and we are continuing it in the countryside
 as well as in the most important cities with our Armed Forces of National
 Liberation (FALN).
 Up to now, and contrary to what certain newspapers have written,
 our Party has not envisaged, much less approved, the abandonment of any
 of these forms of struggle.
 Nevertheless, a miniscule anti-Party group has formed within
 our Party, led by a former member of the Central Committee, of a
 military and "caudilloist" tendencies, messianic even, whose failure is
 already flagrant.   This group has not managed to attract more than fifty
 or so members of the Party and of the Communist Youth.   It is completely
 isolated from the serious elements of our Party and from democratic
 opinion in our country.

 Excerpts from speech by Fidel Castro,
 Havana, 13 March 1967
 ...Doubtless the Venezuelan revolutionaries, just like revolutionaries
 in all parts of the world, committed diverse errors, diverse errors
 of concepts of struggle, diverse errors of a strategic type, and errors
 of tactical type.  Various factors contributed to those errors.   One
 of them was the fact that the revolutionary movement was very strong in
 the capital and on the other hand, as had happened in many other Latin
 American countries, through the fault of the communist parties, the
 revolutionary movement was very weak in the rural areas....
 Since the official Venezuelan party was strong, and the leftist parties
 were weak in the rural areas although strong in the capital, for a long
 time there was an overestimation of the importance of the capital and
 the struggle in the capital in the minds of the leaders of the revolu-
 tionary movement of Venezuela.  That is not all.  It was in Venezuela
 that the revolutionary movement achieved the greatest penetration in the
 ranks of the professional army in recent times...That led to another
 error in concept--a minimization of the guerrilla movement and a pinning
 of their hopes on a military uprising....
 ...Besides erroneous concepts of strategy these strategic errors also
 led to serious practical errors.   The guerrillas found themselves
 abandoned and deprived of the most elementary resources.-The revolu-
 tionary leadership of the party, in an effort to direct the guerrilla
 forces from the plains and from the capital, did not do what was
 necessary, what a truly bold and revolutionary leadership would have
 done, what the leaderships of the great contemporary historical move-
 ments did to bring victory.   That is, they should have gone to the ..
 mountains with the guerrilla forces to direct the war from the battle
 field, to direct the war from the mountains....
 It is absurd and almost criminal--and we do not say that it is 100 per-
 cent criminal because it is the result of ignorance rather than deceit--
 to attempt to direct guerrilla forces from the city.   They are two
 different things, so very different; their theaters of action are so
 dissimilar that the greatest folly, the most sorrowful and bloody error
 which a person can make, is to attempt to direct guerrilla forces from
 the city.   The guerrillas were really not considered a force capable of
 growing and of seizing revolutionary power in countries such as ours.
 Instead, they were considered an instrument of agitation, political
 instrument, a tool for negotiations.  Underestimating the guerrilla
 forces led to subsequent errors.   In Venezuela the guerrillas were con-
 stantly being instructed to cease fire.   That is folly, because a
 guerrilla who does not fight perishes for lack of action; a guerrilla
 who does: not  fight does not progress; a guerrilla who takes a respite
 is a guerrilla doomed to defeat.

 That is what happened in Venezuela, and naturally, as the result of inept
 leadership, coups and setbacks followed one after another....
 The leaderhsip of the Venezuelan Communist Party began by talking about
 democratic peace.  Many people wondered what the talk about democratic
 peace was....
 At the bottom the intention was to abandon the armed struggle, and the
 way was just being prepared.  How did we know these things, these facts?
 ...certain documents came into our possession,...documents that were
 deseminated among the militants of the Venezuelan Communist Party for
 discussion,....
 One of these documents is written by Pompeyo Marquez, Teodoro Petkoff,
 and Freddy Munoz.  Its essence is as follows:  First, some changes have
 occured that oblige the revolutionary movement to revise certain aspects
 of its tactics, basically with relation to the armed struggle.  The
 rough outline of the situation is this:  The armed struggle has sustain-
 ed a number of setbacks and has been weakened; the revolutionary move-
 ment is not at present in a condition to continue an open, frontal clash
 with its enemies; the armed branch of the party has been severely damaged;
 the bloody, brutal repression is affecting the revolutionary movement's
 capacity to organize, unite, and mobilize the broad masses and give a
 fitting reply to the government's policy.
 Because of the continuous blows and setbacks and its own present weak-
 ness, which prevent successful actions, the armed struggle, unless
 appropriate measures are adopted to safeguard its tools, may lose the
 role it has been playing  in the recent past, a period in which it gave
 the masses promise of a revolutionary transformation.,  Actually, in
 the present hour, it is no longer playing that role, and its future
 depends on what steps we take today.
 ...as a result the party must fall back on the military front and re-
 commend suspension of armed action incorder to regroup its forces and
 prepare them for a new revolutionary stage, which from the operational
 point of view must be qualitatively superior to those known heretofore.
 Until our recovery has been basically achieved-.and progress is made in
 promoting fresh forces and regrouping nationalist sectors, all opera-
 tions by the FALN must cease.
 This military falling back must be accompanied by a political offensive
 which will enable us to cover the withdrawal, relieve repressive pressure,
 and regain the political initiative.
 What the failures, the incompetents, had to do was not to condemn,
 discipline, and expel those who had shown ability to defeat the enemy in
 the open field of war in the mountains, but to resign.   That was the

 only honest thing, the only just thing--to assume responsibility for the
 failure and turn over the leaderhsip of the party to those who had demon-
 strated ability to wage war.
 ..And it was not possible for us revolutionaries, it was not possible
 for us--faced with a choice between the uncertain, the defeatists, and
 men determined to achieve their goal of liberating their fatherland or
 dying for Venezuela, who were not a group of theorizing charlatans but
 a group of fighters--for an elemental reason of principle and revolu-
 tionary ethics we could not but express our solidarity with those
 fighters.
 In the name of what principles, what reasons, what revolutionary essen-
 tials were we obliged to declare the defeatists right, those of defeatist,
 vacillating tendencies?  In the name of Marxism-Leninism? No!   In the
 name of Marxism-Leninism we could never have held them to be right.   In
 the name of the international communist movement?  Were we perchance
 obligated by the fact that it was the leadership of a communist party?
 Is that perchance the idea we must have of the international communist
 movement?  For us the international communist movement is, first, just
 that:   a movement of communists, a movement of revolutionary fighters;
 and whoever is not a revolutionary fighter cannot be called a communist.
 We conceive of Marxism as revolutionary thought and action.   Those who
 do not have a truly revolutionary spirit cannot be called communists....
 Our position regarding communist parties is based strictly on revolu-
 tionary principles.   Those parties which unhesitatingly follow a line--
 a revolutionary line--we will support in spite of everything.   Those
 parties which call themselves communist or Marxist and believe them-
 selves to have a monopoly on revolutionary feeling but who really are
 monoplizers of reformism we will not treat as revolutionary parties.
 If in any nation those who call themselves communists do not know how to
 fulfill their duty, we will support those who--even though they do not
 call themselves communists--behave like real communists in the struggle....
 To reject beforehand all who since the beginning have not been called
 communists would be an act of dogmatism and sectarianism....
 ...What defines a communist is his action against oligarchies, action
 against exploitation, action against imperialism, and, in this continent,
 action in the armed revolutionary movement.  What defines communists of
 this continent is their action in the guerrilla movement in Guatemala,
 in Colombia, and in Venezuela.
 No one who has the right to call himself a communist will support the
 rightwing's official leadership against Douglas Bravo.   Communist parties
 will have to be differentiated between guerrillas who fight in Venezuela
 and defeatists who want to renege, who practically want to sell out the
 guerrilla movement.   This will be a point of differentiation, for we are
 reaching a time when they will have to be differentiated....

 Individuals acting for mere reasons of sect or dogma, those with a
 spirit of splittism, condemn the fighters.  They will not be considered
 revolutionaries....
 What have official representatives done regarding the death of Iribarren
 Borges? In the first place what do we think about that death?...We have
 no information on Iribarren Borges.  We know only the news which was
 published by.the AP and other press agencies.  We do not know who killed
 Iribarren Borges.
 Our honest opinion-in this case is:   if it was the revolutionaries,
 we think it was a mistake.....
 ,..This is our opinion.  A revolutionary can disagree with an action,
 with a method, with something abstract, but what is not moral, what is
 not revolutionary is to take advantage of a certain action to join the
 hysterical chorus of the reactionaries and imperialists to condemn the
 revolutionaries.
 If the revolutionaries are responsible for this action, we will express
 our view, but we will never join the chorus of hangmen ruing Venezuela
 to condemn the revolutionaries.  What has the official leadership of
 the Venezuelan Communist Party done? ....
 ...They accused the guerrilla fighters, taking advantage of the most
 repugnant opportunism, hoping to appease the proimperialist and puppet
 Leoni government... This position regarding heroic fighting men, who
 maintain the Venezuelan revolutionary banner on high, asks for their
 heads.  What they have done is only a step from asking Leoni for a
 rifle to kill Douglas Bravo.
 There has been a wave of statements.  What kind of attitude is this?
 This is a cowardly action, an opportunist, repugnant action.   This is
 joining the chorus of the counterrevolutionary hysteria and the chorus
 against Cuba.
 These statements of cowards and opportunists are never the statements
 of the revolutionary, for the revolutionary can criticize, he can dis-
 agree with an act, but he does: not join in this shamful action....
 Not everything is rosy in the revolutionary world.   Complaints follow
 on complaints because of contradictory postures.   While $ome are con-
 demned for restoring relations with Federal Germany, a crowd is running
 about in search of relations with oligarchies of the Leoni and company
 type....

 April 1967
 Excerpts from "Revolution Within the Revolution?"
 by Regis Debray
 In many American countries guerrilla warfare has repeatedly to sug-
 gest dependence on a patriotic front or a party.
 The placement of guerrilla warfare under the strategic and tactical
 orientation of a party which has not radically changed its normal peace-
 time organization, or to make guerrilla warfare one more branch of party
 action will bring as its consequence a series of fatal military errors.
 Let us review these rapidly:   today, they are familiar to everyone.
 1.   Coming Down from the Mountains
 The arm, however, well equipped with weapons it may be, must consult
 the head before it takes action.   The head, or leadership, is found in the
 capital.   ...The principles of democratic centralism make it necessary
 for the commander of a guerrilla front ... to participate in leadership
 discussions.   ...He must go down to the level where policy really operates
 and functions.   ...This involves a fatal risk.   Sooner or later, the
 military officer in charge will be killed....
 ..."The cities," Fidel has said, "are graveyards for revolutionary
 individuals and resources."  This does not even take into account the
 disastrous moral effect on the combatants of the degradation of their
 leaders...   A commander cannot go down to the cities to attend any
 political meetings.  He must make the politicians come up to him, to a
 safe place, to discuss and decide matters.  ...This presupposes that the
 commander is with means with which to exercise his leadership or that he
 can obtain them....
 2.   The Lack of Political Power Leads to Logistics and Military
 Dependence of the Mountain Forces on the Cities
 This dependence often leads the leaders in the city to abandon
 guerrilla warfare.
 The subordination of guerrilla warfare to urban political leader-
 ship not only has very real practical results for the guerrilla fighters
 but also creates in them an inferiority complex and a feeling of depen-
 dence.   They have to wait for everything:   their political leaders,
 guidelines, money, weapons, and even the date set for operations.   The
 moral and political principle, if the guerrillas do not have strength of
 their own, is lost to view, and the guerrilla fighter becomes daily more
 of a prisoner of the hopes of imminent aid from outside.   The guerrillas
 must wait for the promised aid to come, and on the promised day it does
 not come, or only a part of it does, and more days of waiting are nec-
 essary.   ...Thus, it is that they attempt to wage "their armed struggle,"
 although it often means simply waiting.

 And this is natural..-.. The city jungle is not so savage.   There
 men struggle to be recognized as hired animals, rather than fighting
 just to exist.   There is a living for all, unequal, perhaps, but avail-
 able in any case.... It is truly said that we bathe in social life.
 Prolonged baths soften one....
 The terrible isolation in which a number of these nuclei in the
 mountains have had to live for months and sometimes years is not explained
 so much by clandestine sabotage, indifference?or betrayal or.. the part of
 their area apparatus, as by an inevitable difference in living conditions,
 and thus, in thought and behavior, between the two sectors.   The best
 of the comrades in the capital or abroad, although they may have been
 sent on important missions, and are dedicated to their work, fall victim
 to this difference, which represents an "objective betrayal." ...   The
 two sectors do not breathe the same air....
 Lack of logistical self-sufficiency.   Some guerrilla fronts have
 survived on two hundred dollars a year from the political organs spon-
 soring them, while that same political party spent thousands of dollars
 during the same -period on propaganda work abroad and domestically, on
 maintaining officials inside and outside the country, in establishing
 press organs, holding amnesty conferences, etc., in order to extract
 profit from the prestige the existence of these guerrilla fronts lacking
 in combat equipment and isolated gave  them.   From this experience and
 similar ones, following conc_usion has been drawn:   it is less risky and
 safer for a guerrilla group to make forays from its own base, ... to
 neighboring villages to obtain foodstuffs and campaign equipment, to
 establish its own depots, to bury or hide them, and thus to guarantee
 its freedom of action for some months....
 However risky these attacks may be, they are preferable to waiting
 in vain...   Lack of military independence.   The guerrillas cannot plan
 military operations months in advance for a given day in accordance with
 the national political calendar established by the regime in power...
 It is only reasonable that campaign plans be 'drafted by those individuals
 who have to carry them out...    Political leadership -ca hot'draft military
 plans axone, as it sees fit, in order to contribute to maneuvers against
 or pressures upon the bourgeois regime, and then transmit them to its
 military apparatus "for implementation," as the customers gives his
 orders to the water who transmits it to the kitchen....
 3.   The Lack of a Single Command
 The lack of a unified command is the reason for the lack of a
 general plan of action...   Only a truly consistent and vigorous
 leadership provided with a reasonable long-term strategic plan based on
 a wise political analysis could correlate these two aspects of direct
 action.    By rema':ning in the cities, the political leadership will
 inevitably be destroyed or splintered by the repressive forces.   But
 the force of tradition, the habitual adherence to given forms of organization

 which have been consecrated and solidifed by time prevents a break with
 the established structure and the adoption of the new form of struggle
 required by the war situation....
 Currently,. there are countries in which many political leaders
 would agree, at certain moments, to leave the city, to go into the
 mountains and to free the existing repression.   But in fact, the situa-
 tion is different every day.   One day there is a coup d'etat "in the
 air" or a meeting which is to be held, the hope that the fighters will
 be resolved in the finding of a sudden solution.   There is always a pre-
 text....
 In all cases there is a search to unite the advantages of all the
 forms of struggle and to avoid their various disadvantages:   No one is
 willing to choose one form of struggle as basic and subordinate the
 other to it.   Both arms are allowed to act, each one in its own way and
 on its own account, without correlated action, and without subordination
 of the tasks.   This abstract, reformist or contradictory political
 leadership transforms the revolutionary movement into a marionette with-
 out strings....
 Uncontrolled urban actions result from the lack of a single command
 and any clear strategy of armed struggle.   Since there is no clear
 strategy, there is no plan of action.   The guerrilla is isolated from
 the city.   Each acts on his own account.   The urban forces, or those
 who stand in their stead, are not in any clear way subordinate to the
 mountain guerrillas.   For this reason, the true guerrillas should be
 recognized as the guiding and motive wing of the movement....
 It is obvious that terrorism in the city cannot play any key role
 and that it also involves some dangers of a politicalnnature.   But if it
 is subordinated to the basic struggle, that in the rural sector, it has
 from a military point of view a strategic value....
 All modern American experience confirms this disharmony and dis-
 agreement between the mountain and the plains forces, giving it the
 force of law....
 No deliberative political front can take charge of the effective
 leadership of a people's war.   Only an executive group which is techni-
 cally able and centralized, and is united on the basis of identical
 class interests can do so.   In a word, a revolutionary general staff is
 needed.  A composite national front is by nature disposed to political
 disagreements, discussions, endless deliberations and temporary compro-
 mises....
 It has been demonstrated that military experience in a people's
 war is more decisive than political experience without contact with
 guerrilla forces in the training of revolutionary cadres.   The major

 leaders in Latin America today are young men, without broad politioal
 experience prior to their entry into the guerrilla, ranks.  It; is ridi-
 culous to continue to speak separately of "political cadres" and "military
 cadres," "political leaders" and "military leaders," and purE, "politicians,"
 who would like to continue to be just that, but serve no purpose in
 heading the armed struggle of the people.   Purely "military" men do,.
 and in directing guerrilla warfare and living the guerrilla life they
 become politicians too.   The experience of Cuba and that more recently
 in Venezuela, Guatemala and other countries shows that in guerrilla
 warfare the fighters are trained politically more quickly anc. more pro-
 foundly than by spending an equal length of time in a training school,
 even when they are of petty bourgeois or peasant origin....
 The Basic Lesson for the Present
 I.   What should be strengthened today, the party or the guerrilla
 factions, as the nucleus of a popular army?  Which is the decisive unit?
 Where should the main effort be put?
 This today is the question on-.which the militants in all the van-
 guard countries of Latin America in which guerrillas are operating
 are divided....
 It has been given a classic answer in the history of Marxism and in
 fact by history itself....   It is the party which must be strengthened
 first, because the party is the creator and the guiding nucleus of the
 people's army....
 As far as orthodox history goes, these principles have been applied
 to date in the victorious revolutionary struggles in our era in terms
 of the separate existence of a political vanguard and the military tools,
 with the absolute domination of the former over the latter....
 Castro says that there can be no revolution without a vanguard, and
 this vanguard need not necessarily be the Marxist-Leninist party, and
 that those who want revolution have the right and the duty to establish
 themselves as a vanguard, independent of these parties.
 It takes courage to state things as they are in a fearless voice,
 when these facts go against a tradition.   There is, then, no metaphysical
 equation -- vanguard equals Marxist-Leninist party.   There are merely
 dialectical relations between given functions -- that of the 'vanguard
 in history -- and a given form of organization -- *:hat of the Marxist-
 Leninist party....
 ...The effective orientation of a revolutionary armed struggle demands
 a new-methodrof leadership, a new type of organization and new ideological
 and physical reflexes on the part of those responsible as well as the
 militants.

 The new style of leadership.   It has been widely demonstrated that
 a guerrilla war is not directed from abroad, but from within, and with
 acceptance of the necessary quota of risks.   In a country in which a war
 of this sort is being waged, then, it is necessary that the majority of
 the leaders leave the cities and join the guerrilla army....
 A new organization.   The conversion of the party into an effective
 guiding organ equal to the historical situation also makes it necessary
 to do away with the plethors of commissions, secretariats, congresses,
 conferences, mass gatherings, plenary sessions, meetings and assemblies
 on all levels -- national,-provincial, regional and local, tormention
 the most important....  This conversion further requires the provisional
 suspension of "internal democracy," in the party and the temporary
 abolition of the rules of democratic centralism which guarantee it...
 New idelogical concepts.   Nor are certain deliberate attitudes < .
 consistent with the objective state of war, for example, if an entire
 political line is based on the contradiction existing between inimical
 classes or groups with divergent interests within a single bourgeois
 social class.   The result of such policy is often the obsessive search
 for alliances within this or that faction of a bourgeoisie, negotiations
 for support, electoral maneuvers from which the dominant class has
 always, to date, benefited, the safeguarding of unity at all costs,
 above the level of principle and revolutionary interests.   This changes
 the party little by little, and its survival in a given form becomes an
 end in itself more sacred than the revolution....
 How to overcome these lacks?  Under what conditions can these parties
 resume their vanguard functions even in guerrilla warfare? ...
 II.   How is the vanguard party formed?  Can the party, under the
 conditions existing in Latin America, create the people's army or is it
 the latter which must create the vanguard party?...
 ... The most decisive political definition is membership in the guerrilla
 force, the armed forces of liberation.   Thus, little by little, this
 little island has created unity at the base including all parties as it
 has grown and obtained its first victory.   Finally, the future people's
 army will give rise to the party of which it should have theoretically
 been the tool.   It has been said, for its shock value, that the usual
 tool of winning power -- the party -- was created after the takeover of
 the regime.   But no'.   It was there before, in embryonic form.   It was
 the rebel army....
 The Latin American revolution and its vanguard, the Cuban revo-
 lution, are thus making a decisive contribution to international revolu-
 tionary experience and Marxism-Leninism...

 Under certain conditions, the political apparatus iE not separate
 from the military apparatus.  The two form an organic whole.  This orga-
 nization is the people's army, the nucleus of which is the guerrilla
 force. The vanguard party may exist in the form of the guerrilla center
 itself. The guerrilla force is the developing party....
 ...Precisely because of the clarity of the revolutionary line and because
 of adamant resolution, it has been necessary to separate, a-, a certain
 point in development, from the existing vanguard parties (Guatemala) or
 to impose upon them (Venezuela) the necessary political, ideological
 and organizational concepts at the basis for all possible agreements to
 be made or dissolved.   In a. word, in these two cases, it was necessary to
 destroy all organic dependence on political parties and put something
 else in the place of the failing political vanguard-.  That is to say,
 it was necessary to-reach-the point at which the Cuban revolution began.
 Thus a divorce lasting some decades between Marxist theory and revo-
 lutionary practice has come to an end.   However contingent and fragile
 the reconciliation may seem, it is this guerrilla. warfare with its
 unpolitical leadership which incarnates it....
 ...Any guerrilla movement which wants to carry the people's war through
 to the end, to transform itself, if necessary, into a regular army and
 to undertake a war of movement and to take a stand will have in Latin
 America to become the undisputable political vanguard, an essential
 aspect being that its leadership must be incorporated in the military
 command....
 Dialectically speaking, in the long run, in some areas in America,
 there will be no choice to be made between a vanguard party and a people's
 army.  At present, however, there is an order to objectives historically
 substantiated.   The people's army will be the nucleus of the party and
 not vice versa.   The guerrilla forces are the political vanguard "in
 nuce" and the true party can be born only as a result, of its development.
 To this effect, the guerrilla movement must be developed in order
 to develop the political vanguard.
 To this effect, under the current circumstances the main emphasis
 must be placed on the development of the guerrilla warfare and not in
 the strengthening of existing parties or the creation of new ones.
 To this effect, in those same places, the insurrection work of
 today is political work No. 1....
