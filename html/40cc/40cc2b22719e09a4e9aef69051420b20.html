 C SOUTH VIETNAM:   North Vietnamese infantry,
 supporte   y tanks and artillery, have returned to
 the attack against the outer defenses of Quang Tri
 City.
 Enemy ground attacks were preceded during the
 night of 26-27 April by extensive shellings by
 130-mm. guns and 122-mm. rockets.   By midnight on
 the 27th, North Vietnamese forces were pressing
 hard against positions of the South Vietnamese 3rd
 Division southwest of the city.   Enemy units were
 mounting supporting assaults north and south of the
 main drive, and intense artillery fire was being
 directed against the city and the La Vang combat
 bases.   Government defenders had been pushed back
 to within two miles of the city.
 The extensive Communist build-up before the
 new assaults and the strong artillery support being
 given to North Vietnamese infantry units suggest
 that the fighting may be heavy and sustained.   It
 has been three and a half weeks since the North
 Vietnamese were stalled at Dong Ha in their drive
 south, a suitable interval for regrouping between
 major drives.  Early on the 28th, tank-led North
 Vietnamese units forced government defenders to
 withdraw from Dong Ha and the Cua Viet River de-
 fense line.  ARVN forces are now attempting to es-
 tablish a new defense line several kilometers south-
 east of Dong Ha.
 Flying weather remains poor in the Quang Tri
 area.  Virtually all of the enemy's major drives
 during the current offensive have been timed to
 coincide with poor local weather conditions.   This
 was true of the original thrust across the DMZ, the
 drive down toward An Loc, and the most recent as-
 sault in Kontum Province.   It appears that the
 enemy may be deliberately holding up attacks, even
 after forces are in place and the battlefield is
 prepared, in order to wait for bad weather and th
 protection it affords from allied air attacks.

 CIn the highlands, enemy progress down Route
 14 toward Kontum City remains slowed by the de-
 struction of a key bridge, and the government's
 newly organized defenses at Vo Dinh have not yet
 been tested.   The badly mauled 42nd ARVN Regiment
 is being refitted in Kontum City, and the 47th has
 been flown to Pleiku Province where it will re-
 group.   On the eastern edge of the highlands, South
 Korean troops have managed to reopen Route 19
 through An Khe Pass, which had been closed by the
 Communists for 15 days.   The first supply convoy
 moved through the pass toward the highlands on
 27 April.   If the pass can be kept open for a few
 days, it may be possible to relieve some of the
 shortages that have been developing in Kontum as
 a result of the enemy's systematic interdiction
 of the  ai  road  le din  into that province.

 WEST GERMANY:   The Bundestag vote on the
 Eastern treaties next week remains in doubt, de-
 spite the fact that the government survived op-
 position leader Barzel's no-confidence motion
 yesterday.
 Apparently half of the 26 coalition Free
 Democratic deputies chose to vote instead of ab-
 staining along with their Social Democratic part-
 ners.   Barzel gained 247 votes--two short of the
 needed absolute majority--in his bid to oust Chan-
 cellor Brandt.   One, possibly two, Free Democrats
 reportedly voted for Barzel, indicating that at
 least one of the opposition opted to support Brandt.
 In all, ten ballots were cast against Barzel,  and
 three ballots were left blank.
 This voting pattern will not necessarily be
 repeated in the Bu:ridestag vote on the treaties.
 Barzel's ability to muster 247 votes, however,
 serves notice to Brandt that the government will
 have to marshal its forces carefully.   Brandt will
 need only a simple majority on the first Bundestag
 vote on 4 or 5 May.--248 deputies if Barzel can re-
 peat his tally--but an absolute majority later in
 a second vote if he is to override the almost cer-
 tain rejection of the treaties by the Bundesrat
 in mid-month.
 Possibly instrumental in Barzel's defeat was
 the announcement on the eve of the vote that West
 German and East Ge:cman negotiators had reached
 agreement on a general traffic treaty, and that
 East Germany had agreed to permit East Germans to
 visit West Germany on "urgent family matters" with-
 out age limitation,

 CAMBODIA:  The confrontation between the gov-
 ernment and students in Phnom Penh has intensified
 as a result of a shooting incident yesterday at the
 city's law school.
 Twenty students were wounded, three of them
 seriously, when military police fired on a group
 trying to join student agitator Koy Pech, who is
 barricaded in the law school with some supporters.
 This is the first time blood has been shed in an
 encounter between Cambodian demonstrators and the
 Lon Nol regime.
 Large numbers of defiant students have con-
 gregated at Phnom Penh's Independence Monument and
 have refused to disperse until the government agrees
 to talk to their leaders.   The government thus far
 has not responded to this demand.   Instead, it has
 set up additional barricades, reinforced military
 police with regular troops, and ordered the evacua-
 tion of the law school.   It has made no effort, how-
 ever, to disperse the crowd at the monument or to
 ban further demonstrations.   In addition, military
 police controlling the crowd at the monument evi-
 dently are under orders to avoid incidents and the
 use of riot gas and weapons.
 Lon Nol evidently is still trying hard to
 cope with the disturbances with a minimum of force.
 His apparent hope that the government could outwait
 the students holed tip in the law school may be
 fading, although he probably is still reluctant
 to force the issue by storming the building--es-
 peci;ally since some students there have weapons.
 Lon Nol may find it difficult to vacillate much
 longer, with the referendum on the new constitu-
 tion, the original object of the students' un-
 happiness, only two days away.   It is possible
 that he will opt for a short-term expedient that
 might involve opening direct talks with the stu-
 dents and postponing the referendum until some

 CHINA:   Peking's decision to curtail its May
 Day celebrations attests to persistent instability
 within the ruling elite.
 A foreigiz press service in Peking, attributing
 its information to diplomatic observers there, has
 reported that Chinese officials are saying that the
 traditional mammoth May Day fireworks display has
 been canceled for "economy reasons."   The unprece-
 dented cancellation of this event probably is de-
 signed to avoid the necessity for a top leadership
 turnout; Mao Tse-tung,  for example, has not missed
 the May Day celebrations since 1966.   The last oc-
 casion requiring a major leadership show, the Na-
 tional Day rally last October, also was called off,
 allegedly as an economy measure.  That rally was
 canceled because of the Lin Piao affair.  Although
 an upheavel of similar magnitude may be under way
 now, curtailment of the May Day festivities is prob-
 ably also due to some major internal political de-
 velopments.
 The most obvious explanation for avoiding a
 leadership show is to conceal the political decline
 of one or more of the ruling politburo members.
 All of the active politburo figures, however, have
 been making regular public appearances in recent
 weeks with the exception of Mao, who last appeared
 when President Nixon visited Peking.   But prolonged
 absences from public view have been so much a part
 of Mao's leadership style that neither the state of
 his health nor the political temperature in Peking
 can be accurately gauged by his pattern of appear-
 ances.   On the other hand, the continued public
 activity of the remaining members of the elite is
 no guarantee that they are not engaged in intense
 maneuvering behind the scenes.  The problem of
 sorting out a new power configuration in the wake
 of the Lin Piao affair doubtless continues to roil
 the waters in Peking, and it is possible that there
 will be other high political victims as the search
 for a more durable leadership coalition goes on.

 Another possible indicator of fresh political
 tensions is the circulation among party cadre of
 yet another document denouncing Lin Piao and the
 top military leaders purged with him.   The document
 describes a plan--the "571 Project"--purportedly
 drawn up by the Lin forces in preparation for an
 armed coup against Mao.   The document is a curious
 one containing some particularly scurrilous attacks
 on Mao and identifying Lin as a proponent of some
 pragmatic domestic policies, which would seem to
 have popular appeal.   The purpose behind publicizing
 the 571 Project is still obscure, but if it is not
 simply a further effort to nail the lid on Lin's
 political coffin,, the circulation of the document
 may reflect heightened controversies over power
 and policy that are more current than historical.
 At this stage:, it is by no means clear that
 the mysterious and convoluted events in Peking sig-
 nal impending political changes.  Nevertheless,
 the amount of unfinished business on the Chinese
 leadership agenda, which includes filling the gaps
 in the politburo and reconstructing the institu-
 tions of political and military authority, offers
 ample testimony to the depth of the unresolved
 conflicts throughout the nation's leadershi  hier-
 archy.

 CHINA-MALTA:   Peking has extended an interest-
 free'loan of  45 million to Malta, the first signif-
 icant aid from a Communist country.
 Some $3 million will be provided in hard cur-
 rency later this year.   The remainder apparently is
 to be delivered over a six-year period and has been
 allocated for equipment and technical assistance,
 probably for Malta's light industry.   The amount
 involved is comparable to the level recently ex-
 tended by China to other developing countries.
 The.Chinese probably agreed in principle to
 the aid when Prime Minister Mintoff was in Peking
 in early April.   By courting Mintoff, the Chinese
 apparently hope to forestall the development of
 Soviet influence in Malta.   They also see a propa-
 ganda advantage in backing Mintoff's endorsement
 of the "sea of peace" concept, which calls for the
 exclusion of the US and USSR from the Mediterranean.
 Mintoff's visit had been well received by
 most Maltese, and the announcement of this agree-
 ment will further enhance the prime minister's
 domestic stature.   Some criticism can be expected
 from those who oppose any Malta-China ties, but
 Mintoff is likely to respond that the aid comes
 "without strings" and that the establishment of
 relations with Peking should not be a matter for
 concern, given the thaw in relations between most
 western nations and China.

 NATO:   The allies will attempt again next week
 to narrow differences on detente issues prior to
 Secretary Rogers' scheduled pre-Moscow consultations
 with the North Atlantic Council  (NAC).
 A number of allies still are pressing the US
 to agree to closer linkage between a Conference on
 Security and Cooperation in Europe  (CSCE)  and Mutual
 and Balanced Force Reductions  (MBFR).   The US is
 willing to discuss "some general aspects of MBFR"
 in a conference, but some allies want the CSCE to
 negotiate a declaration on MBFR principles.   The
 Italians are pushing for a close CSCE/MBFR link as
 a way to increase potential Italian influence on
 MBFR.  Rome's motivation is shared. by other allies
 who might be excluded from MBFR negotiations.   The
 British want NATO to remain flexible on the question,
 and the West Germans are trying to mediate allied
 differences.   The French, of course, remain opposed
 to MBFR and do not favor even limited CSCE discus-
 sion of the subject.
 Another contentious issue is whether, as the
 US has argued, the allies should propose a CSCE
 agenda item on "freer movement" of people, ideas,
 and information.   The French and West Germans have
 urged that the language be toned down so that Mos-
 cow will not reject the item out of hand.   This po-
 sition now has extensive allied support.
 The members and applicants of the European Com-
 munity  (EC), except Ireland, which is not a NATO
 member, have held consultations in anticipation of
 the Rogers visit---a practice now apparently routine
 in advance of important NATO discussion of detente
 issues.
 The allies hope that when the NAC meets next
 Wednesday, progress can be made toward a consensus
 on these issues.   The Belgian and British represent-
 atives echoed allied sentiment when they emphasized
 that an allied consensus is essential if President
 Nixon is to be the  "main broker" for the alliance
 on CSCE and MBFR in Moscow.

 EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES:   Prospects have improved
 that, by mid-summer, the Communities will conclude
 industrial free trade agreements with most of the
 EFTA countries not seeking EC membership.
 At the meeting of the EC Council this week,
 agreement was reached to offer new concessions on
 several of the outstanding issues in the negotia-
 tion''s with Austria, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland,
 Portugal, and Iceland.   In particular, the EC. would
 allow small tariff reductions on the so-called "sen-
 sitive" items during the first. three years of the
 proposed agreements instead of the original three-
 year standstill.   The EC would still protect its
 producers of these items, such as paper products,
 special steels and aluminum, by stretching out the
 complete elimination of tariffs up to 12 years.
 For most other products, such elimination will take
 five years.
 No decision was reached by the Council on
 whether the Community should continue to insist on
 receiving agricultural concessions from the non-
 applicants.   Since only Italy continues to hold out
 for such concessions, opposed by most of the-non-
 applicants, the Council seems likely to drop this
 demand when it reviews the situation again in June.
 It is likely that the bargaining will continue
 to be hard when the third round.of negotiations
 opens in mid-May.   Swedish officials have said that
 they will press fcr a shorter transition period on
 steel and paper, but they do not realistically ex-
 pect to gain more from the EC.   For Finland, the
 problem of gaining better terms is more acute.   The
 Finnish minister of trade, in conversations earlier
 this week in Washington, said that in order for Fin-
 land to sign any agreement with the EC the transi-
 tion period for paper products must be reduced to
 at most eight years.   Without such an agreement, the
 Finnish minister foresaw Helsinki eventually being
 forced to develop -closer trade ties with the Soviet
 Union.

 NOTES
 USSR-CUBA:   The Soviet destroyer that operated
 from Havana over the past two weeks has moved to
 Antilla near the eastern end of the island.  The
 ship may rendezvous with the Ugra-class submarine
 tender that arrived in Cuban waters on 26 April to
 escort it to Havana.   The F-class diesel submarine
 that accompanied the destroyer to Cuba in early
 March remains in Mariel.
 PERU-ROMANIA:   Lima and Bucharest are forming
 a joint company to develop Peru's Antamina copper
 deposit.  A US firm formerly held this small con-
 cession, which reverted to state ownership in 1970
 when the firm could, not meet Lima's development
 deadlines.   Peru will have a majority share in the
 venture and will finance local currency costs;
 Romania will hold the remainder and cover most or
 all of the foreign exchange requirements.   This
 agreement follows a similar arrangement concluded
 last month between Lima's State Mining Company and
 a private Swedish firm to develop jointly another
 of the small concessions previously held by the
 US company.   These agreements represent a signifi-
 cant accomplishment for Peru, which had been find-
 ing it difficult to obtain new foreign investment
 to develop these concessions because of the uncer-
 tain investment climate.   Lima will find it harder,
 however,  to obtain :Foreign development financing
 for the larger copper deposits, which will recrui
 an investment of up to $550 million.
