 STRIVE TO BUILD A HIGH LEVEL OF SOCIALIST SPIRITUAL CIVILIZATION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 19, 1 Oct 82 pp 2-9
 [Article by RED FLAG commentator]
 [Text]  A very important move of the 12th CPC National Congress was that it
 made the task of building socialist spiritual civilization one of strategic
 importance, defining the party's fundamental theoretical stand and its
 principles of action with regard to it.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee decided to
 shift the whole party's work focus to the modernization of the economy, the
 CPC Central Committee has, on many occasions, made serious pronouncements
 in this regard.  The most important of these are:  First, in the speech [by
 Ye Jianying] marking the 30th anniversary of the founding of the People's
 Republic, approved by the 4th Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Com-
 mittee, it was pointed out:  The goals of our socialist modernization drive
 are not confined to the development of the productive forces.  "Along with
 the reform and improvement of the socialist economic system, we will reform
 and improve the socialist political system and develop an advanced socialist
 democracy and a complete socialist legal system.  While building an advanced
 material civilization, we want to raise the educational, scientific, cul-
 tural and health levels of the whole nation, foster lofty revolutionary
 ideals and morals, develop a rich and multifaceted cultural life, and thus
 build an advanced socialist spiritual civilization."  Later, in December
 1980, the central working conference discussed this question as an important
 item on its agenda and pointed out sharply:  Without spiritual civilization,
 communist ideology and communist morality, how can it be possible to build
 socialism?  The "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party
 Since the Founding of the  PRC," adopted by the 6th Plenary Session of the
 11th CPC Central Committee, in summing up historical experience and lessons,
 further'affirmed the idea that life under socialism must attain a high
 ethical and cultural level, and summarized the objective of the party's
 struggle in the new period as one of turning China into a powerful, modern
 socialist country which is highly democratic and highly cultured.  This 'is
 to say that our program of socialist modernization as a whole consists of
 'tte'unity of a high level of socialist material civilization, a high level
 of. socialist spiritual civilization and the unity of socialist economic
 construction and socialist political, ideological and cultural development.

 This overall construction program, adopted since the 3d Plenary Session of
 the 11th CPC Central Committee, has now been affirmed by the party's
 national congress and developed systematically in the documents of the 12th
 party congress.
 In dealing with this question, the party Central Committee proceeds not
 from abstract concepts, but from the new situation and new problems in
 actual life and from the historical experience of the development of
 socialism in our country and in other parts of the world.  The elaboration
 on socialist spiritual civilization in the report to the 12th party con-
 gress rises from reality and history.to the theoretical level and contains
 deep thoughts with regard to scientific socialist theory.  Among them, the
 comprehensive epitome of the characteristics of socialism, the explanation
 of the concepts of material civilization and spiritual civilization, the
 elucidation on the dialectical relationship between material civilization
 and spiritual civilization and the view of socialist spiritual civilization
 having communist ideology at its core all represent new ideas.  We should
 conscientiously study and consider these theses and, from a high theoretical
 and political vantage point,' recognize the significance and role of social-
 ist spiritual civilization in our program and strategy for building
 socialism as a whole, to guide us in both thought and action.
 Marxist Explanation of the Concepts of Material Civilization and Spiritual
 Civilization
 The concepts of civilization, material civilization and spiritual civiliza-
 tion, particularly that of civilization, are used extensively in Chinese
 and foreign documents and in daily life.  But, in using these concepts,
 people often differ greatly in angles and emphases.  Therefore, the meaning
 of these concepts is varied and not unified.  In Marxist documents, the
 concept of civilization is also often used, and its meaning is not quite
 definite, either.  Since practice has made clear that these concepts should
 be the basic concepts for making a Marxist analysis of social life,.the
 concept of socialist spiritual civilization should become a basic concept
 of scientific socialist theory.  Thus, it is an essential task for us in
 theoretical research to give these concepts an accurate Marxist explanation.
 The report to the 12th party congress has provided the foundation for such
 an explanation.
 The report to the 12th party congress explains these concepts from the
 angle of the practical activities of mankind in transforming the world.
 This angle is the basic starting point for Marxists to observe and analyze
 the social life of mankind.  The report cites remarks by Marx and Mao
 Zedong as the basis of its line of reasoning.
 Mao Zedong is quoted as saying that the proletariat and other revolutionary
 people face a twofold task in their struggle for the transformation of the
 world:  to change the objective world and, at the same time, their own
 subjective world.  This is true for the struggle of the proletariat and
 also for the entire history of mankind.  Marx, in analyzing the process of
 the disintegration of the primitive commune, said that in productive

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 activity, not only the objective conditions are changed, but the producers
 themselves change.  To explain the concept of civilization in this way, we
 should say that civilization, as the result of'the transformation of the
 world by mankind, came into being together with human society, because the
 history of mankind began precisely with human efforts to transform the
 world.-
 of course, it is also often said that mankind entered the civilized age at
 a certain time, and before that mankind was uncivilized.  This division,
 however, is relative.  In fact, it is a division between different degrees
 of development of civilization.  Continuing to use the viewpoint of Morgan's
 book "Ancient Society," Engels defined the period in which man lived pri-
 marily by gathering natural products and when manmade articles were used
 mainly as supplementary tools for the gathering of these natural products
 as the age of barbarism, the period in which man learned to engage in
 animal husbandry and agriculture as the uncivilized age, and the period
 in which man learned to further process the natural products, that is, the
 period in which industry and arts came into being, as the civilized age.
 We should understand this in. the sense that it is a relative division based
 on degrees of development of civilization.   Subsequently, when higher stan-
 dards were used to make another relative division, we see that Marx, Engels
 .and Lenin called the capitalist society marked by big industry the civilized
 society, and the society before it the uncivilized society.  At the same
 time, when they began to expose the system of exploitation, especially the
 barbaric circumstances concomitant with civilization under the capitalist
 system, they further pointed out that only under the socialist and com-
 munist system, with the elimination of exploitation, will the truly
 civilized age of mankind begin.
 Civilization consists of a material aspect and a spiritual aspect.   The
 transformation of nature results in material civilization, as manifested in
 improved conditions for material production and in a better material life
 for'the people.  In the process of transforming the objective world, people
 also transform their subjective world, and the production of spiritual
 values and the spiritual life of society also develop.  The latter achieve-
 ment is what we call the spiritual civilization, as manifested in a higher
 educational,- scientific and cultural level and in higher ideological,
 political and moral standards.
 This explanation in the report shows the vastness of the sphere of spiritual
 civilization.  The so-called transformation of the people's subjective
 world should not be understood only as the transformation of their
 ideology, but should also include the development and transformation of the
 people's knowledge, achievements and cognitive ability and methods, and the
 development and transformation of the people's sentiment, will and sense of
 beauty.
 Spiritual civilization includes, on the one hand, two major aspects:
 knowledge and culture, ideology and morality, or many attributes with these
 two main aspects as their basic contents; and, on the other hand, two
 spheres, namely, the sphere of the individual and the sphere of society,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 ranging from the individual's cultural, scientific, political and moral
 accomplishment, sense of beauty and mental outlook to the production of
 spiritual values, the spiritual life and customs and practices of society.
 In a word, it covers the development and transformation of the entire
 spiritual world of mankind.
 While differentiating between material civilization and spiritual civiliza-
 tion, we must note that both-are the result of interaction between material
 and spirit, objectiveness and subjectiveness.  Tools used for material
 production result from the materialization of man's intelligence and
 science.  On the other hand, products of spiritual production require a
 material outfit.  All cultural undertakings--whether they are in the fields
 of education, science, literature, art, journalism, publications, radio
 broadcasts, television, public health or athletics and whether they involve
 libraries, museums or cultural relics--require material conditions and
 facilities.  Thus, material civilization contains a spiritual element,
 while spiritual civilization has its material aspect.
 The transformation of society and the establishment and development of new
 relations of production and new social and political systems are propelled
 and brought about by the development of material civilization and spiritual
 civilization.  On the other hand, they also promote the development and
 determine the nature and orientation of these two kinds of civilization.
 In the final analysis therefore, the progress of society should be measured
 by using the development of material civilization and spiritual civiliza-
 tion as a yardstick.
 The nature of civilization, both material and spiritual, is determined by
 the social system and the mode of production.  This is an inevitable con-
 clusion from the basic viewpoint of historical materialism.  Marx stated
 repeatedly that the mode of production in material life governs the whole`
 process of social, political and spiritual life.  A given mode of material
 production created, first, a certain type of social structure and second, a
 certain relationship between man and nature.  These two things determine
 man's state system and the way of his spiritual life, and as such, they
 also determine the nature of his spiritual production.  From this viewpoint,
 we can see that with the changes in the mode of production in man's mate-
 rial life, civilization has developed from a primitive communal civiliza_:
 tion to the slave system, feudalism, capitalism and socialism.
 Socialist civilization is a civilization related to and suited to the
 socialist mode of production.  Based, on the socialist relations of produc-
 tion, it will inherit and assimilate all valuable material and spiritual
 fruits of man's civilization, let them be enjoyed by the working people and
 use them for the purpose of satisfying the needs and raising the level of
 the people's material as well as spiritual life.  On this basis, it will
 develop and create a new civilization, the highest spiritual civilization
 and material civilization of mankind.
 When we talk about socialist civilization, we proceed from and only from,
 the fact that the fruits of material civilization are enjoyed by the people

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 under the socialist system, and they serve the people and socialism.  We do
 not mean that the contents of material civilization, themselves, can be
 classified as being-capitalist or socialist.  When talking about socialist
 spiritual civilization, we refer to the nature of the spiritual civilization
 under the socialist system as a whole.  In certain aspects of spiritual
 civilization, the ideology involved can be described as socialism or capi-
 talism.  In other aspects, for example, knowledge of natural science,
 spiritual civilization is just like material civilization, and it is
 described as being socialist because it is enjoyed by the people and
 serves the people and socialism.  We do not mean to say that the contents
 of spiritual civilization themselves can be differentiated into capitalism
 and socialism.  This must be made clear in applying these concepts.
 Socialist Spiritual Civilization Is an Important Characteristic of Socialism
 In the report [to the 12th CPC National Congress] there is one terse para-
 graph commenting on the socialist characteristics:
 "Socialist spiritual civilization constitutes an important characteristic
 of the socialist system and a major aspect of its superiority.  In the past,
 when referring to the characteristics of socialism people laid stress on the
 elimination of the system of exploitation, public ownership of the means of
 production, distribution according to work, planned and proportionate
 development of the national economy and political power of the working class
 and other working people.   They also laid stress on another characteristic
 of socialism, the high development of the productive forces and a labor
 productivity higher than that under capitalism which were both regarded as
 a necessity and the end result of socialist development.  All this is
 undoubtedly true, but it does not cover all the characteristics.   Socialism
 must possess one more characteristic, that is, socialist spiritual civiliza-
 tion with communist ideology at its core.   Without this, the building of
 socialism would be out of the question."
 This leads to an important theoretical and practical question of how to
 generalize the characteristics of socialism and whether it is an all-
 inclusive generalization.
 Is the above proposition well-grounded?  Yes, it is.
 In 1886. some people wanted to compile a literary collection entitled "What
 Is Socialism?" and asked Engels to contribute 'a short article.  In response
 to this, Engels wrote:  "Our view of the characteristics that distinguish a
 future noncapitalist society from our present society is a definite conclu-
 sion drawn from historical facts and the process of development.  Without
 these facts and experiences, there would be no theoretical and practical
 value whatsoever.   In my book 'Herr Eugen Duehring's Revolution in Science,'
 I tried to describe and explain the economic aspects of these characteris-
 tics.  I have not been able to shorten this incomprehensive general
 description which is irrelevant to social problems, whether they are
 political or noneconomic in nature."

 Engels' description of the characteristics of socialism contained in his
 book "Anti-Duehring" was reprinted in his pamphlet "Socialism:  A Develop-
 ment From Fantasy to Science."  This pamphlet, which Marx termed a popular
 little book on scientific socialism, was confined to the analysis of the
 economic aspects of the characteristics of socialism and only stressed that
 the proletariat would gain social rights, turn the means of production into
 public property to put an end to the separation of the producer and the
 means of production, and replace the anarchic state in the entire social
 production with production conducted according to predetermined schedule....
 This pamphlet did not discuss the other aspects of the characteristics of
 socialism because of limited space and because it was necessary at that
 time to first bring out the most important and decisive aspect, namely, the
 economic aspect.  The opponents of Marx and Engels in polemics denied and
 overlooked the decisive role of the economy, a basic principle.  The scien-
 tific socialism of Marxism is a definite conclusion derived from the analysis
 of the objective economic developmental process and distinguishes itself from
 utopian socialism that is divorced from the objective economic developmental
 process, and it proceeds purely from an ethical viewpoint.  Therefore it was
 completely right for Engels to do what he did.  Meanwhile, he also pointed
 out that the description of the economic aspect was still not an all-
 inclusive generalization of the characteristics of socialism.
 In his work "Critique of the Gotha Program," Marx discussed the political
 aspects of the subject by elaborating on the. idea that the proletariat
 should exercise revolutionary dictatorship during the transition from capi-
 talist to socialist society.   He also put forward the idea that, in the first
 phase of communist society, the laborer would draw from the social stock of
 means of consumption what the same amount of labor would cost.  This is what
 people call the idea of distribution according to work, which is different
 from the idea of distribution according to need in a higher phase of com-
 munist society.  Thus, Marx further delineated the economic characteristics
 of socialism.
 Although all these are extremely important theses on the characteristics of
 socialism, they still cannot comprehensively generalize all such charac-
 teristics.   However, there was no such need to do so at that time, and Marx
 did not set himself such a task.  This is why Marx and Engels did not
 expound on the spiritual life of future society-
 Of course, principled elucidations in this regard are of profound signifi-
 cance for us to transform all ideas derived from the old relations of pro-
 duction and old social relations and to develop education, science and art
 to the'full, according to socialism.  Lenin led the October Revolution to
 victory and then organized the people to strive to carry out the current
 task of building socialism.  The situation posed revolutionary leaders the
 question of comprehensively generalizing the characteristics of socialism.
 In expounding the characteristics of socialism, Lenin particularly stressed
 the development of the productive forces and higher productivity than that
 in capitalist society, in addition.to repeatedly explaining the above-
 mentioned points.  He put forward the formula that communism meant Soviet
 state power plus the electrification of the country.  He also said:

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 Communism means productivity created by united, voluntary and conscientious
 workers with advanced technology that is higher than the productivity in
 capitalist society.  With the greatest proletarian revolutionary courage,
 Lenin did away with the mechanistic concept that socialist revolution can
 be carried out only in capitalist countries with the most developed produc-
 tive forces.  At the same time, he who kept a clear head as a Marxist
 stressed:  In a country which has won the victory of the socialist revolu-
 tion, but whose productive forces are less developed, the greatest efforts
 must be made to develop productive forces in order to lay a proper material
 and technical base for socialist society.  It is entirely correct and of
 great significance for Lenin to have emphasized this characteristic of
 socialism.   Of course, socialism does not yet possess this characteristic,
 but should have it.   This characteristic is a prerequisite for the develop-
 ment of socialism and an end result of its development.
 However, while stressing Lenin's thoughts in this.respect, one must also
 note that Lenin never regarded the development of productive forces as the
 only task for building socialism.   It was Lenin who repeatedly expounded the
 great significance of communist education, ethics, discipline and attitude
 toward work.  He said:  "It will take many years, even many decades, to
 establish a new labor discipline, create new forms of social ties between
 people and initiate new ways and means to draw people to participate in
 work.  This is a most noble work and will produce the most results."  He
 said:  "Overcoming one's own conservatism, laxity and petty bourgeois ego-
 ism is the beginning of a change more difficult, more important, more pro-
 found and more decisive than overthrowing the bourgeoisie.   The fundamental
 task of the Communist Party is to help train and educate the working masses
 so that they can overcome the old habits and practices left over from the
 old system--the habits and practices of private owners which are deep-
 rooted among the masses."
 It was Lenin who suggested that, after the socialist political and social
 changes, it was necessary tq carry out cultural changes and cultural revo-
 lution, that is, to achieve a higher level of universal education and
 develop material production, for only in this way would a country become
 completely socialist.  He pointed out that it is necessary to acquire all
 sciences, technologies, knowledge and arts and use them to build socialism.
 'Thus it was Lenin who set out the tasks in many areas of what we now call
 building socialist spiritual civilization, although he had not yet formed
 such a concentrated concept.
 In light of the tradition of the Chinese revolution in winning victories
 through protracted, arduous struggles by relying on the guidance of the
 correct ideology, the political consciousness and dedication of the cadres
 and masses, and the rich experience unique to our party and army in ideo-
 logical and political construction, Mao Zedong laid great stress on the
 important role of strengthening ideological and political work and develop-
 ing'the revolutionary spirit in building socialism.  He also put forward
 many correct and profound ideas in this respect.  For example:  "Political
 work is the life-blood of all economic work."  "Ideological and political
 work is'the guarantee for the completion of economic and technical work."

 "We should maintain the same vigor, the same revolutionary enthusiasm and
 the same daring, death-defying spirit we displayed in the years of revolu-
 tionary war, and carry on our revolutionary work to the end."
 Now our party Central Committee has inherited the correct ideas of Lenin and
 Mao Zedong in this respect and summed up the lessons from the mistakes we
 made in this area.  In the past, mainly under the "left" errors of widening
 and absolutizing class struggle, we failed to shift the focus of our work
 to economic construction and, for a long time, underestimated the impor-
 tance of education, science and culture.  Because of taking class struggle
 as the key link, our ideological and political work became very narrow in
 scope, and the method used was very simplistic and crude.  In economic
 construction, we also made the mistake of exaggerating the role of subjec-
 tive will and revolutionary spirit, violating the objective economic laws
 and neglecting the masses' material interests.  In the past few years, we
 have resolutely corrected these "left" errors.  At the same time, we have
 studied the new problems confronting us and new experience gained in this
 area after shifting our work focus to economic construction and put forward
 the basic task of striving to build a socialist spiritual civilization while
 building a socialist material one.  We have thus established our program
 for building socialism in an all-round way and our theory summarizing all
 the characteristics of socialism.   This is a new conclusion obtained from
 the historical facts and course of development of socialism and is undoubt-
 edly of great theoretical value and practical significance.
 The Relationship Between Spiritual and Material Civilization in Building
 Socialism
 There is the viewpoint that spiritual civilization is determined by mate-
 rial civilization; that without a high level of material civilization,
 building a.high level of spiritual civilization is out of the question; and
 that with the development of material civilization, spiritual civilization
 develops naturally.   This viewpoint is incorrect.
 Marxism stresses the decisive role of the productive forces in social
 development, which is a fundamental principle of historical materialism.
 The decisive role here is in the sense of the final analysis, refers to
 the entire course of historical development, and should not be over-
 simplified.  In analyzing the interrelation between material and spiritual
 civilization, we cannot cast aside the social system.  As viewed from the
 entire course of the development of the history of mankind, the progresses
 of material civilization, spiritual civilization and the social system
 respectively are in harmony and balanced.  However, in each specific his-
 torical period and each different country, the development in these three
 areas is often uneven.  Because of the influence of the social system and
 other factors, and because spiritual civilization encompasses a vast
 sphere, the state of evenness and unevenness between the levels of develop-
 ment in various different sectors of spiritual civilization and the levels
 of development of material civilization presents a complex picture.

 Under the capitalist system, material civilization is highly developed in
 some countries, but in others, because of long periods of aggression,
 oppression and plunder by developed countries, material civilization is
 extremely backward.  In the developed capitalist countries, the development
 of material civilization and progress in science and technology are not
 equally enjoyed by all members of society, and are often accompanied by
 spiritual cruelty, barrenness and degeneration.  Aren't these the most
 obvious ugly phenomena under the capitalist system?
 Under the socialist system, we should seek harmonious and mutual-promoting
 development of material and spiritual civilization.  However, unevenness
 still exists, except that its nature and circumstances are fundamentally
 different from those under the capitalist system.  In the actual course of
 the world's historical development, the socialist system was not first
 established in countries with the most developed material civilization.
 This fact has long since refuted the simplistic understanding of the
 historical materialist theory on the decisive role of developing, produc-
 tive forces.  Our country has established a socialist system, but our
 socialist system is still in the initial stages of development and our
 material civilization is not highly developed.   However, our socialist
 system makes it possible for the fruits of material civilization to be
 enjoyed by all people and makes the development of material civilization
 to serve the people and society.  This is different from any society ruled
 by the exploiting classes.  The socialist system calls for, and will
 eventually ensure, the development of material civilization at a fairly
 quick pace in'our country.  Through the concerted struggle of our masses
 of people, we certainly can change our state of underdevelopment caused by
 deep, historical reasons and build a high level of socialist material
 civilization.   However, the building of a high level of socialist spiritual
 civilization does not necessarily have to wait until the material civiliza-
 tion is already highly developed, just as socialist revolution did not have
 to take place first in countries with the most developed productive forces.
 The report puts it well:  "The establishment of the socialist system makes
 it possible for us to build a high.level of socialist spiritual civiliza-
 tion while striving for a high level of material civilization, just as the
 development of a modern economy to a certain level and the appearance of
 the most advanced class of our time, the working class, and its vanguard,
 the Communist Party, make it possible to succeed in socialist revolution."
 Among the various aspects of spiritual civilization, the development of
 undertakings such as education, science and culture requires appropriate
 material and technical means whose scale, quantity and technological level,
 to a large extent, depend on the level of development of material civiliza-
 tion.   However, the people's ideological and political consciousness and
 moral standards, mental outlook and spiritual life of the society, in other
 words, the ideological content of spiritual manifestations and social rela-
 tions and practices can reach a very high level as a result of the estab-
 lishment of the socialist system and the consciousness and struggle of the
 masses of people under the leadership of the Communist Party.  This is not
 only possible, but a matter of course, and has been proven by history.   The
 popularization and development of Marxism and communist ideals in the whole

 society among the masses of people, the establishment and promotion of
 socialist relations of unity and mutual.assistance among the people, and
 the formation of new ethical concepts and consciousness in observing dis-
 cipline and social customs and practices are the most important and
 realistic manifestations of the superiority of the socialist system.  The
 socialist system and its spiritual civilization provide a strong impetus
 for the development of material civilization and will ultimately create a
 material civilization higher than that of capitalism.  Then, the superiority
 of the socialist system will be fully manifested.
 In discussing the erroneous view that spiritual civilization develops in the
 course of the development of material civilization, we must point out that
 although material civilization is an indispensable foundation for socialist
 spiritual civilization, it will not develop simply because it has the
 foundation provided by material civilization.  The development of socialist
 spiritual civilization requires that the broad masses of people, relying on
 this foundation and under the leadership of the Communist Party,.con-
 sciously make unremitting and hard efforts.  At the same time, the building
 of material civilization needs the spiritual impetus provided by socialist
 spiritual civilization to ensure its development along the correct course.
 When we say our modernization is socialist modernization, we mean that as a
 social process, our modernization requires not only the development of
 material civilization, but also that the socialist system and socialist
 spiritual civilization ensure the socialist orientation of this development.
 The building of socialist spiritual civilization is one of the most impor-_
 tant guarantees for our adherence to the socialist road and concentration'
 of our efforts on building the four modernizations.'
 The report says:  If the great task of building a socialist spiritual
 civilization guided by communist ideology is overlooked, people will fall
 into a one-sided understanding of socialism and direct their attention
 exclusively to the building of material civilization or even only to the
 pursuit of material gains.  In that case, we will not be able to safeguard
 the socialist orientation of China's modernization, and our socialist society
 will lose its ideals and objectives, its spiritual motivation and fighting
 will, lose the ability to resist the inroad of corrupt influences and even
 develop distortedly and degenerate.
 This is an important exposition which merits our deep thought.   Only when
 we understand the dialectical relationship between material and spiritual'
 civilization can we regard the building of spiritual civilization as a
 strategic goal which concerns all aspects of socialist construction, can we
 understand that the building of spiritual civilization is an important
 question having a vital bearing on the success or failure of socialism,
 can we regard the struggle for building a high level of socialist spiritual
 civilization as a task for the whole party, a common task for all fronts
 and an honorable task every cadre and citizen is obliged to take part in.
 Every builder of spiritual civilization should realize his solemn obliga-
 tion.   His entire work should serve, but not deviate from and much less
 undermine socialist and communist education among the people.  He should

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 also work to help and promote the building of material civilization.  Every
 builder of material civilization should realize that he, too, shoulders the
 task of building spiritual civilization.  He should not only produce more
 and better material products but also train one generation after another
 generation of new socialist people for the purpose of material production.
 He should by no means obstruct or undermine the building of socialist
 spiritual civilization under the pretext of carrying out economic policies,
 measures and work.  Moreover, he should pay attention to and support the
 development of cultural construction in various fields.  In this way,
 socialist spiritual civilization becomes a great motive force for building
 material civilization and the building of material civilization gradually
 satisfies the material and cultural needs of the whole people and ensures
 free, all-round and full development of the people's spiritual life.  Thus,
 in the building of spiritual and material civilization, each is the condi-
 tion and objective of the other.
 The Relationship Between the Cultural and Ideological Building in the
 Building of Socialist Spiritual Civilization
 Comrade Hu Yaobang pointed out in his report:  "The cultural and ideological
 aspects in socialist spiritual civilization permeate and promote each other."
 In both theory and practice, we must stress the unity of these two aspects
 and must not use one aspect to negate or belittle the other.  Cultural
 development, which is very important, becomes even more important when our
 task is shifted from revolution to construction.  The historic resolution
 adopted by the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee called
 on us to resolutely liquidate the erroneous views, such as underestimating
 the importance of education, science and culture and discriminating against
 intellectuals, which existed over a long period and reached a climax during
 the "Cultural Revolution."  The report again pointed out:   "In the past,
 owing to the influence of 'left' ideas and the small-producer mentality,
 such erroneous views were rife in our party over a considerable time.  They
 seriously hindered the building of material and spiritual civilization in
 our country."  For this reason, raising the understanding and strengthening
 the work of cultural development is especially urgent at present.
 The report, delivered at the 12th CPC National Congress, regards the develop-
 ment of education and science as one of the three strategic priorities in
 China's economic growth,'expresses the determination to gradually close the
 gap between cultural and economic development, and reiterates the decision
 that universal primary education must be achieved in the main by 1990
 .throughout the country, a task which should have been fulfilled long ago.
 The report also urges that development plans and goals for other cultural
 undertakings covering the next 5 to 10 years should also be worked out.
 These are the important tasks in building socialist spiritual civilization.
 At present, the party is calling on the ranks of the cadres to become more
 revolutionary, better educated and more professionally competent and the
 people of the whole country. to become idealistic, moral, cultured and with
 sense of discipline, thus stressing the unity between ideological con-
 sciousness and knowledge of culture.  The raising of people's cultural and

 scientific knowledge is related to the raising of their ideological con-
 sciousness in view of the fact that mastering the Marxist world outlook
 and scientific theory will enable people to form their consciousness, ideals
 and convictions on a scientific basis and especially in view of the fact
 that mastering the professional knowledge required for socialist construc-
 tion will enable people to put their ideological consciousness into practice
 in that construction.
 There were a number of revolutionary martyrs whose level of education was
 not so high, but their revolutionary consciousness and sacrificial spirit
 will forever be our model and guide us in advancing.  Of course, from now
 on, we cannot say for sure that people with a high level of education must
 also have a high level of ideological consciousness.  If those martyrs were
 still living today, they would certainly respond to the call of the times
 and the party and strive to raise their cultural level and would never be
 complacent with, or proud of, their culture.
 The socialist character of our spiritual civilization is determined by
 ideological education, which is the soul of cultural development.  The
 development of all cultural undertakings must be guided by the Marxist world
 outlook'and communist ideology.  In view of some specific historical condi
 tions, it is currently especially urgent to stress the importance of ideo-
 logical education in building socialist spiritual civilization.  Looking
 back in our history in the years of the revolutionary war and under the
 difficult material conditions, we formed a high level of revolutionary
 consciousness, ideals, morality and a new type of human relations among our
 revolutionary ranks and in our revolutionary bases, which attracted the
 people of the whole country, especially young people, and constituted an
 important guarantee for the victory of the revolution nationally.   After the
 nationwide liberation in the pioneering stage of our socialist construction,
 the high degree of enthusiasm among the people of our country in studying
 Marxism and politics, and the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly,
 cleaned up the filth left by the old society, formed a brand-new social
 practice and value, and gave strong impetus to our socialist cause, thereby
 demonstrating the great superiority of the socialist system in spiritual
 civilization and winning the respect of revolutionary people all over the
 world.
 .The mistakes and turmoil of the "Great Cultural Revolution" confused the
 people's sense of right and. wrong, good and evil, and beauty and ugliness.
 They delayed and destroyed the building of material as well as spiritual
 civilization and dampened the people's conviction in Marxist ideology and
 the communist ideal, thereby giving rise to the corruptive ideas of
 bourgeois ultraindividualism and anarchism.  The consequence has been
 extremely grave.
 Since the downfall of the "gang of four," especially since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, we have brought order out of
 chaos, restored the true features of Marxism and socialism and liquidated
 the pernicious ideological influence of Lin Biao.and the "gang of four."
 The situation is rapidly developing toward a healthy direction.  But,

 eliminating the grave mental consequences that resulted from the "Great
 Cultural Revolution" is difficult and requires efforts for a long time to
 come.
 Meanwhile, new problems have cropped up under the new situation.  In the
 past few years, we have stressed shifting the emphasis on work, improved
 the people's livelihood, implemented the principle of distribution accord-
 ing to work, adopted the policy of opening to the outside world and of
 revitalizing the economy at home, and encouraged some people to get rich
 first.  All this is correct and necessary and has gained marked results as
 well as the people's support.  But, because of continuing class struggle
 within certain limits, because of the impact of the habits of the old-time
 private property owners and the impact of foreign capitalist ideas and
 because ideological and political work as well as management work cannot
 keep up with the demands of the changing period, some people now look for-
 ward to nothing but money and publicly claim that men die for wealth and
 birds die for food.  All kinds of illegitimate and evil practices have come
 into existence.  Even deplorable social practices, which had disappeared
 long ago in new China, once again prevail.
 We must uphold the party's correct economic policies and encourage the
 masses' enthusiasm for developing production and for achieving prosperity
 through hard work.   At the same time, we must be wary of the backlash of
 corruptive and depraved practices in our spiritual life.  Through the
 party's repeated emphasis and the experience of actual life, the whole
 party and people can now better understand the importance and intensity of
 this issue.  Much has been done and initial results have been achieved on
 all fronts in promoting socialist spiritual civilization, encouraging
 healthy trends and striking at evil practices.
 The report called for a radical change for the better in the standards of
 social conduct and party work style in the next 5 years.  It also pointed
 out that the party's ideological construction is the pillar that supports
 the whole society in building spiritual civilization.  Efforts to popu-
 larize education of ideals, morality and discipline among the people
 throughout China, especially among the young people, are fundamental for a
 radical change for the better in the standards of social conduct.
 We must proceed from within the party and conduct these educational pro-
 grams successfully.  As required by the report, we should arouse, with
 revolutionary ideas and spirit, the immense enthusiasm of the broad masses
 for building socialism so that our socialist cause will forever maintain
 its revolutionary vigor.

 BUILD A GOOD CADRE CONTINGENT ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLE THAT THEY MUST BE
 MORE REVOLUTIONARY, YOUNGER IN AVERAGE AGE, MORE EDUCATED AND PROFESSIONALLY.
 MORE COMPETENT
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 19, 1 Oct 82 pp 10-14
 [Article by Song Renqiong [1345 0117 4522]]
 [Text]  The new party constitution adopted by the CPC National Congress has
 stipulated in clear and definite terms that "The party selects its cadres
 according to the principle that they should possess both political integ-
 rity and professional competence, persists in the practice of appointing
 people on their merits and opposes favoritism; it calls for genuine efforts
 to make the ranks of cadres more revolutionary, younger in average age and
 more knowledgeable and specialized."  The core of the organizational work is
 the question of cadres.  Making the ranks of the cadres more revolutionary,
 younger in age and more knowledgeable and specialized is a major principle
 of the party's cadre work in the new period.   The comrades of the whole
 party must resolutely, unconditionally and enthusiastically propagate and
 conscientiously implement this principle.
 The advance and formation of this principle went through a process.  After
 the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee formulated the
 party's ideological and political lines in the new period, in July and
 August 1979, Comrade Deng Xiaoping inspected Shandong Province, Shanghai
 and Tianjin.  On his inspection tour, he pointed out on many occasions
 during the journey that since the ideological and political lines have
 been formulated, the question now is that of the organizational line, that
 of cadres and in particular, that of selecting successors.   Cadres who are
 competent and fairly young should be selected for promotion.   On 29 September
 in the same year, in his speech delivered at the meeting to celebrate the
 30th anniversary of the founding of the PRC, Comrade Ye Jianying stressed
 the need to pay attention to ensuring that "the ranks:of cadres become
 younger in average age and more specialized step by step" and the need to
 try our best to "make the situation of our organization suit the political
 task of realizing the four modernizations."  In May 1980, at the forum on
 the work of selecting and promoting outstanding young and middle-aged cadres,
 a forum. which was convened by the Organization Department of the CPC Central
 Committee, Comrade Yaobang further pointed out that the so-called ideal
 leading bodies means that the members of the leading bodies must resolutely
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 carry out the party's line, uphold the socialist road, possess professional.
 knowledge and organizational and leadership ability, and must be in the
 prime of life and full of vigor.  During this period, Comrade Chen Yun held
 that'irl selecting cadres, attention should be paid to the fact that they
 should possess both political integrity and professional competence.  By
 political integrity, we mean, above all, upholding the socialist road and
 the leadership of the party.  On this basis, the cadres should become younger
 in average age and more knowledgeable and specialized, and furthermore this
 method of selecting and using cadres should become a regular practice.  The
 great historically significant decision adopted by the 6th Plenary Session
 of the 11th CPC Central Committee again clearly affirmed that "the party has
 decided to put an end to the virtually lifelong tenure of leading cadres,
 change'the overconcentration of power and, on the basis of becoming more
 revolutionary, gradually reduce the average age of the leading cadres at all
 levels and raise their level of education and professional competence."
 From the above-mentioned sketchy review of the past, we can see that the
 policy of ensuring that the ranks of cadres become "more revolutionary,
 younger in average age and more knowledgeable and specialized" was worked
 out by the party Central Committee through careful consideration and on the
 basis of making repeated deliberations and of drawing on collective wisdom
 and absorbing all useful ideas.  It is the crystallization of the collective
 wisdom of the party's leading core, it conforms with objective reality and
 also complies with the common aspirations of the party and the people.
 To ensure that the ranks of the cadres become more revolutionary, younger
 in average age and more knowledgeable and specialized is a major subject put
 forth by the objective process of the continuous development of our socialist
 cause.  With the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee as the
 milestone, our country has entered a brand-new period of development.  During
 this period, the party should shoulder the heavy responsibilities entrusted
 by history of leading the people of all nationalities throughout the country
 in building the economically and culturally backward China into a modern and
 powerful socialist country.  The task of carrying out such an unprecedented
 pioneering undertaking is extremely arduous.  Although the domestic and
 international situations are favorable for us, we are still confronted with
 many difficulties.  Of the various kinds of difficulties, the conspicuous
 difficulty is that the present conditions of the ranks of cadres are not
 suited to the requirements of the new situation.  The main manifestations of
 this situation at present are:  1) historically, the members of leading  '
 bodies at various levels are universally 15 to 20 years older than they were
 before the "Great Cultural Revolution" and the gap between their present
 average age and that in the 1950's is even wider, that is, the phenomenon
 of aging is serious; and 2) a considerable number of cadres lack cultural
 knowledge and scientific and technical know-how, and the number of those who
 have received systematic professional training and have a knowledge of
 advanced science and technology and management techniques is even smaller.
 This state of affairs is in sharp contradiction with the requirements of the'
 socialist modernization program.  If we ignore the question of cadres put
 for   by the objective process of the great historical turning point and fail
 to promptly and correctly solve this problem, it will be difficult to

 implement the party's political line, let alone continuously carry it out
 for long years.  It is not alarmist talk to raise the question in this way.
 The practice of the international communist movement has given us grievous
 lessons.  The profound lessons our party has drawn from solving the problem,
 of successors and from building a cadre contingent remain fresh in our
 memory.  Happily, we already have a large number of veteran revolutionaries
 who enjoy high prestige and command universal respect and have rich experi-
 ence.  At a critical moment in effecting a great turning point in history
 and facing the question of the cooperation between old and new cadres and
 the succession of the old by the new, with great foresight, they put forth
 in good time for the party a correct principle of properly solving the
 question of cadres, that is, a principle of ensuring that the ranks of
 cadres become younger in average age and more knowledgeable and specialized
 on the basis of revolutionization.  Experience tells us that only a party
 which is not only good at formulating a correct political line but also
 good at formulating the organizational line which ensures the implementa-
 tion--the effective implementation--of the political line, can be regarded
 as a mature Marxist party.  Ours is precisely such a party.
 To.ensure the "four modernizations" of the ranks of cadres, it is first
 imperative to start with the "transformation" of the leading bodies at
 various levels.  Our tentative ideas are that before the convening of the
 next CPC National Congress, 5 years of efforts should be exerted to sub-
 stantially raise the political quality of the leading bodies at various
 levels, and reduce the average age of the members of the leading bodies at
 various'levels by about 5 years compared with that before the organiza-
 tional reform; by then, the young and middle-aged cadres who possess both
 political integrity and professional competence will constitute about 70
 percent; those who have an educational level of institutions of higher
 education or above and have mastered certain professional knowledge will
 make up 60 to 70 percent.  In particular:  we must have some of the number
 one and number two men of great ability who can unite and lead all the lead-
 ing bodies in opening up new prospects in work.  Of course, since the vari-
 ous localities at all levels, trades and departments have their own specific
 tasks, the requirements of the political and ideological levels, age and
 composition of knowledge for the leading bodies must also differ accord-
 ingly.  However, we must not waver in marching ahead along the lines of
 making the ranks of cadres more revolutionary, younger in average age and
 more knowledgeable and specialized, in building working bodies which are
 small in number but highly energetic and capable of continuously opening
 up new prospects in work.   Can the above-mentioned tentative ideas be
 realized?  The achievements gained in the organizational reform carried out
 in the organs under the direct jurisdiction of the party Central Committee
 and the ministries and commissions under the State Council in the first half
 of this year make us confident in answering in the affirmative.  This reform
 which took us 4 months not only great reduced the authorized size of the
 party and government bodies at the central level and their staff but also
 widely'reduced the average age of the members of the leading bodies of the
 ministries and commissions and bureaus under their jurisdiction by 4 to 6
 years.  According to the statistics of the 38 ministries and commissions
 under the State Council, the number of ministers, vice ministers and

 directors was reduced by 67 percent and the newly promoted young and middle-
 aged cadres constituted 32 percent of the total sum of members of the newly
 established bodies; moreover their level of knowledge was higher and more
 and more people were professionally competent.  There are also quite a few
 successful instances in the localities, departments and enterprises and
 undertaking units where the organizational reform has not yet been carried
 out.   This shows that the above-mentioned requirements are attainable so
 long as efforts are exerted.
 The crux of the matter lies in the fact that the problem of "retirement"
 and "promotion" should be solved satisfactorily.  By "retirement," we mean
 conscientiously' and properly arranging for batches of old and infirm com-
 rades to retire to the second or third line resolutely in accordance with
 the regulations of the party Central Committee concerning the retirement
 system for old cadres and the related regulations of the State Council.
 The practice of the organizational reform of the party and government
 central organs shows that the overwhelming majority of our veteran cadres
 have high political consciousness; can recommend wise and well qualified
 people out of concern for public interests; can proceed from the overall
 situation'to conscientiously submit to the needs of revolution and the
 arrangements of the party organizations; can support young comrades whose
 seniority, prestige and experience are inferior to their own in their newly
 assigned work, and are willing to be assistants or to retire to the second
 or third line to take on the, task of helping and guiding their young com-
 rades and passing on experience to them.  By "promotion" we mean promoting
 young and middle-aged cadres who have proved themselves to the leading
 bodies resolutely to be really outstanding after undergoing trials in prac-
 tice, according to the principle of both political integrity and professional
 competence.  As Comrade Chen Yun said:  Not just a few dozen or a few hun-
 dred, but thousands and tens of thousands of cadres must be promoted.  At
 present particular attention must be paid to training and selecting out-
 standing cadres who are about 30 to 40 years old.  The promotion and
 .retirement of this kind are closely related.  For veteran cadres to with-
 draw from first-line leading posts is important while for young and middle-
 aged cadres to be promoted to these posts is more important.   Careful and
 skillful handling is needed in solving the questions of who should retire
 and what should become of them and who should be promoted and to what posts.
 The most important thing in 'this regard is to find the right people and put
 them to good use.
 The guiding ideology of the CPC Central Committee is quite clear on the
 matter of "promotion," that is, it is imperative to boldly promote cadres'
 who possess both political integrity and professional competence, and are
 in the prime of life and capable of opening up new prospects in work to
 leading posts; at the same time, none of the "three types of people" and
 none of the people who have seriously violated the law and discipline in
 the political or economic sphere in recent years should be allowed to sneak
 into the newly established leading bodies.  It is the solemn responsibility
 of the party committees at all levels and the departments of organization
 and of personnel affairs to manage these two matters well, conscientiously
 implement the party's standards for selecting cadres and persist in the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100380001-6
 practice of appointing people, on their merits and opposing favoritism.  At
 the same time, it is also necessary to earnestly heed the opinions of all
 sides and,quarters concerned and the masses, restructure the practices of
 the organizational and personnel work which do not suit the modernization
 program and open up new channels for discovering, training and using quali-
 fied personnel.  Who are the able and virtuous people whom the party and the
 people want most to select and put in important positions?  The three
 requirements which the party stressed some years ago and the six basic
 requirements stipulated by the new party constitution for leading cadres
 at all levels to meet are identical in spirit.  The requirements are the
 embodiment of the dialectical unity of Red and expert and the objectiviza-
 tion of the party's principle of both political integrity and professional
 competence in the new historical conditions.  While grasping and carrying out
 these requirements, it is essential to strictly ensure the political standard
 first and to promote the comrades who really have a strong sense of party
 spirit, are honest and upright in their methods and dare to uphold prin-
 ciples.  It is impossible to imagine that a man who lacks firm confidence in
 socialism and communism, who is alienated from the correct line, principles
 and politics of the party Central Committee, who is irresponsible in his
 work, in low spirits and morally degenerate in his conduct, and who violates
 the law and discipline can shoulder heavy loads in leading socialist con-
 struction.  However, it is far from enough to pay attention exclusively to
 political integrity.  Only when they become younger in average age and more
 knowledgeable and have a good grasp of their professions, can our ranks of
 cadres adapt themselves to the requirements of the new tasks of the new
 situation. It is a pity that those who possess political integrity without
 professional competence can hardly take up an important post although admit-
 tedly they are politically trustworthy; the professional competence of those
 who possess professional competence without political integrity is precisely
 enough to make them more self-seeking and wily.
 If we put them in important positions, they will constitute a grave danger
 to us.  At present, we must specially watch out for the people who rose to
 prominence by following the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary
 cliques; people who are seriously factionalist in their ideas; people who
 indulged in beating, smashing and looting; people who are opposed to the
 line followed by the party Central Committee since the 3d Plenary Session
 of the 11th CPC Central Committee; and people who have seriously violated the
 law and discipline in the economic and other spheres, and we must never let
 them sneak into leading posts.  None of these types of people must be pro-
 moted and any of them who have already been promoted to leading bodies must
 be resolutely and thoroughly removed from the leading bodies one by one if
 discovered.  This is an extremely important matter which concerns whether
 or not we can ensure the smooth sailing of the socialist modernization
 program and ensure the continuity of the party's Marxist line.  We must
 never treat this matter casually.
 To judge and select cadres at various levels, we must strictly act accord-
 ing to the basic requirements stipulated in the new party constitution and
 on no account must we lower the requirements on them in the slightest. degree.
 Then are there thousands and tens of thousands of such qualified personnel

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100380001-6
 for us to select for promotion?  We not only already have such talent but
 also-have rich resources of it.  There is no harm here in calculating
 roughly the age, qualifications and records of service (the tempering they
 have undergone) and the composition of culture and knowledge of the existing
 cadres:  1) the comrades who are 36 to 55 years old number 11 million;
 2) the number of cadres who took up their work after the victory of the war
 of resistance against Japan and before the "Great Cultural Revolution" is
 around 12 million; 3) the comrades who have reached the level of senior
 middle school graduate or above total roughly 12 million; and 4) the tech-
 nical cadres of various professions. amount to more than 8.3 million.  After
 the founding of the PRC, we trained a total of more than 3.1 million uni-
 versity graduates and over 38 million graduates from senior middle schools
 and specialized secondary schools, at present the intellectuals who work
 in the units under the system of ownership by the whole people and under the
 collective ownership system number more than 25 million.  It can thus be
 seen that it is entirely possible to select those who excel in all spheres
 and to-choose one in a hundred from-our huge treasure house of talent and
 to accelerate the promotion of cadres.
 Over the last 2 or 3 years, the party Central Committee and the various
 localities and departments have done a lot of work in realizing the "four-,
 modernizations" of the leading bodies and certain achievements have also
 been scored in this respect.  However, judging the work as a whole, the
 result is far from satisfactory.  This does not mean that we have not yet
 selected any of the right people but what we mean is that the number of
 people we have selected for promotion is too meager.  This plus the natural
 growth of the age of cadres has brought about the phenomena in which little
 change has taken place in the average age of the members of quite a few
 leading bodies and large batches of comrades who possess both political
 integrity and professional competence and are in the prime of life have not
 been promoted to appropriate leading posts.  The problems and difficulties
 in this respect lie in the fact that, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said:   The
 existing organizational system and the way of thinking of quite a few com-
 rades are detrimental to the selection and use of the talent that is needed
 most badly in the four modernizations.  Where does the way out lie?   Com-
 rade Deng Xiaoping said:  "We hope that the party committees at all levels
 will make a big turnaround on this matter, resolutely emancipate their
 minds, overcome one obstacle after another, break with old conventions and
 be bold in reforming the system of organization and of personnel affairs
 which are out of keeping with the times, in vigorously training, discover-
 ing and breaking the rules to promote outstanding talent and in waging
 resolute struggle against all phenomena of suppressing and trampling talent
 underfoot."  In this respect, we, the Organization Department of the CPC
 Central Committee, did insufficiently in the past.
 In the future, together with the comrades of the whole party, we must do
 our best to act as required,by the party Central Committee.  First of all,
 we must further deepen our understanding and in the selection work, we must
 pay regular attention to opposing feudal ideas, such as the mentality of
 "replacement according to seniority" and clear away the influence of
 "leftist" ideology in treating intellectuals, correct the idealist way of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 thinking of seeking "all-rounders," "perfect men" and the like in a way that
 deviates from reality, and really shift the emphasis of cadre work to the
 acceleration of the "four transformations" of the ranks of cadres so as to
 realize the "four modernizations" of the country.
 It must still be pointed out here .that making the ranks of cadres more
 revolutionary, younger in average age and more knowledgeable and specialized
 is a,principle which should be carried out for long years throughout the
 whole new period.   Carrying out the "transformation" in an on-and-off way
 will never attain the goal of "transformation."  This is not only because
 people are getting older year after year, that is, today they are in the
 prime of life and some years later they will grow old and infirm, but also
 because the development of our cause calls for steady improvement of the
 requirements of being more revolutionary, knowledgeable and specialized.
 What is more, whether or not the newly promoted people can be well quali-
 fied must also go through trials in practice and they are bound to change.
 Therefore, we must implement the principle of ensuring that the ranks of
 cadres become more revolutionary, younger in average age and more knowledge-
 able and specialized and find good solutions to the problem of the coopera-
 tion between old and new cadres and of the succession of the old by the new
 with extremely great revolutionary toughness and with positive, steady and
 sure steps.   People can see that the organizational reform of the central
 organs and the ministries and commissions of the State Council has pushed
 the "four transformations" of the leading bodies a big step further.  This
 is however only the first step.  According to statistics for the 34 minis-
 tries and commissions connected with the economy under the State Council,
 there are now 137 ministers and vice ministers as well as directors and
 vice directors with an average age of 57.93 years old, or 5.7 years. less
 than before the organization reform.  This is significant progress.  How-
 ever, if we do not continue selecting young and middle-aged cadres for
 promotion, after 2 years, their average age will again increase to more
 than-60 years old.  It can thus be seen that if we relax our work a bit or
 do our work in an on-and-off way, it will be difficult for us to funda-
 mentally free ourselves from a passive position.  Therefore, it is impera-
 tive to reform the cadre system and to guarantee that the work of making
 the ranks of cadres become more revolutionary, younger in average age and
 more knowledgeable and specialized is institutionalized.
 The shift of the focus of the party's work and the organizational and
 structural reforms require us to reform the unsuitable aspects of the cadre
 system.  This is a historical necessity.  The two go hand in hand.  If we
 shut our eyes to the needs of development of the situation and do not
 enthusiastically and resolutely reform the aspects of the cadre system in
 which conditions are ripe and reform them partially, this will greatly delay
 our work.  On the contrary, things will go contrary to our wishes if we
 regard this reform as a simple thing or take any hasty action.   In reforming
 the present cadre system, it is first necessary to strictly implement the
 decision of the party Central Committee concerning the retirement of old
 cadres.  The retirement of the old cadres at various levels must be carried
 out in accordance with the regulations of the party Central Committee con-
 cerning the method of reckoning age.  Apart from some specific veteran

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100380001-6
 comrades who have passed the age limit for retirement but are required to
 stay in the leading bodies by the decision of the party organizations con-
 cerned, the overwhelming majority of the old cadres must retire on the
 basis of doing a good. job of persuasion and making proper arrangements for
 them. Good care must be given to the retiring old cadres and attention
 must be paid to bringing their role into play.
 While their health permits, these comrades are encouraged to continue to
 make contributions to the party and the state within their power.  When
 everybody is gradually accustomed to the implementation of the retirement
 system of cadres through years of efforts, the normal succession of the old
 by the new will be ensured institutionally.  Of course, this system alone
 is far from sufficient.  We must still establish and perfect the job respon-
 sibility system for cadres of various types and at various levels from top
 to bottom in the light of the organizational reform and the systems of
 assessment, promotion and demotion, and rewards and penalties for cadres
 which are suited to the job responsibility system; we must further perfect
 the systems of democratic election and appointment and removal of cadres in
 the light of perfecting political life and in accordance with the stipula-
 tions of the party and the state constitutions.  Reform of the cadre system
 is a new thing.  We will surely encounter many difficulties.  However, if we
 fail to resolutely carry out the reform, we are bound to encounter more and
 greater difficulties.  We hope that everyone will work strenuously in this
 respect and strive to lay a good foundation for further reforming the cadre
 system through the organizational reform of the units at various levels.
 Finally, I would like to discuss the question of vigorously intensifying the
 education and training of cadres.  The rapidly developing socialist mod-
 ernization program requires us to continuously train and bring up cadres
 who are more revolutionary, younger in average age and more knowledgeable
 and specialized in larger quantities and of better quality and to funda-
 mentally raise the quality of the whole contingent of cadres.  This is a
 matter of strategy which has a bearing on the success or failure of our
 cause.  In order to solve this problem, our country is stepping up its
 efforts and reforming the school educational work so as to infuse new blood
 into the ranks of cadres.  One important task at present and for a period of
 time to come is that our work should be based on the universal raising of
 the standard of existing cadres.  Apart from continuing to persist in train-
 ing and tempering the cadres in practice, it is still necessary to train
 them on a large scale.   Recently, the party Central Committee made a decision
 of strategic importance on training cadres on the job in rotation and urged
 the party schools at all levels, cadre schools run by government organiza-
 tions and enterprises, and especially designated institutions of higher
 education and the specialized secondary schools to shoulder the regular
 training of cadres in their different capacities.  In the future, in our use
 and promotion of cadres, we must attach importance to educational background
 and academic records as well as to experience and achievements in work.
 Therefore, cadres of various types and at all levels must try their best to
 acquire a certain level of formal learning and of educational knowledge.
 All cadres who are working and who do not possess the level of cultural
 knowledge needed in their work should be trained in rotation by stages.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 There must be an assessment examination in the vocational training and
 academic records will be one of the important bases for making appropriate
 adjustments of cadres.  At present, some localities and departments have
 not attached due importance to the work of training cadres and there are
 also some cadres who are unwilling to take part in study.  This is wrong and
 must be rectified.  We must launch a sustained upsurge for study among the
 cadres at various levels throughout the nation for the sake of the grand
 cause of socialist modernization; an upsurge in which people study Marxism-
 Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, acquire general knowledge, master scientific
 and technical know-how and operational and management techniques and study
 all that is needed to build a high level of socialist material civilization
 and spiritual civilization.  In the last few years, more than 8,100 party
 schools and specialized cadre schools at various levels have been restored.
 and newly built and the ranks of cadres teaching in such schools have
 developed into an approximately 100,000-strong contingent; more than 130
 institutions of higher education have run special training courses for
 cadres; the various localities, departments and some medium and large-sized
 enterprises have run large numbers of cadre training courses, and the number
 of cadres who have been trained in rotation and received vocational training
 has increased year after year.  According to statistics, the number of lead-
 ing cadres at county level throughout the country who were trained in rota-
 tion from 1979 to 1981 reached more than 200,000, constituting more than
 half the total of cadres of this category..
 Although our work of educating and training cadres is still far from per-
 fect, we have at long last made a good beginning and also accumulated some
 experience.  So long as we make persistent and unremitting efforts and con-
 tinue to march ahead along the lines of regularization and institutionaliza-
 tion, by the next national party congress, greater progress will surely be
 made in the quality, both political and professional, of the whole con-
 tingent of our cadres, greater improvement will certainly be achieved in the
 extent to which they are more revolutionary, younger in average age and more
 knowledgeable and specialized, and new and heartening successes will surely
 be scored in socialist modernization.

 DEVELOPING SCIENCE IS A STRATEGIC KEY POINT IN CHINA'S ECONOMIC
 CONSTRUCTION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 19, 1 Oct 82 pp 15-20, 26
 [Article by Yu Guangyuan [0151 0342 6678]]
 [Text] Comrade Hu Yaobang's report delivered at the 12th CPC Congress has
 solved a problem of fundamental importance to science, because it has
 explicitly defined the important strategic position of science in our
 country's socialist construction.  This has required the entire party and
 people throughout the country to attach importance to science and actively
 support and promote the development of science from various aspects so that
 they will play an important role in accomplishing our country's general
 task in the new historical period.
 With regard to science, stressing a scientific attitude and urging vigor-
 ous development of scientific undertakings in China is a guiding thought
 permeating the whole report.  While recounting the great historical
 achievements of the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Congress, the
 report points out that the plenary session "has set right the guiding
 ideology of the party and reaffirmed the Marxist ideological, political and
 organizational lines."  This is the victory of the people and science.  The
 report adds that after the third plenary session, "our party thoroughly
 summed up its historical experience in all spheres and scientifically
 explained numerous questions encountered in practical work, which concerned
 theory and policy in the building of socialism," "in handling various prac-
 tical problems, we have done our best to act in the scientific and compre-
 hensive way required by Marxism."  After citing party achievements scored
 since the third plenary session, the report concludes:   "In the final
 analysis, our party has been successful in the above efforts because it has
 adhered to the scientific Marxist principles of combining theory with prac-
 tice and of recognizing the people as the makers of history."  While
 recounting the socialist nature of the building of spiritual civilization
 being carried out in China, the report reiterates that the first main
 element of socialist spiritual civilization comprises the following points:
 "the working class world outlook and scientific theory of Marxism; communist
 ideals, beliefs and moral values."  In conclusion, the report stresses:   "We
 must resolutely take over and learn to use the stand, viewpoint and method
 of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, acquire a deeper unddrstanding of the
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 actual work in all fields, make systematic investigations and studies, and
 be good at conducting appropriate criticism and education and waging neces-
 sary struggles against wrong tendencies.  Provided we persist in doing this,
 we can certainly accumulate new experience, break new ground in theory and
 carry forward Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought under new historical
 conditions and in great new fields of practice."  We communists should use
 Marxist scientific truth to guide our actions in revolution and construction
 and regard it as a basic way of conducting ourselves in society.  Therefore,
 while discussing scientific undertakings, we should, first of all, pay great
 attention to and actively support Comrade Hu Yaobang's expositions contained
 in his report concerning the science of Marxism and the importance of stick-
 ing to, popularizing and developing it.
 The second part of Comrade Hu Yaobang's report "Bring About a Comprehensive
 Upsurge of the Socialist Economy" expounds strategic objectives of economic
 development for the next 20 years.  It points out:  "From an overall point
 of view, what is most important in our effort to realize the objectives in
 economic growth is to properly solve the problems of agriculture, energy,
 transport, education and science."  "In short, in the next 20 years we must
 keep a 'firm. hold on agriculture, energy, transport, education and science
 as the basic links and the strategic priorities in China's economic growth."
 In other words, the report regards the development of science as one of the
 few strategic priorities in economic construction.
 In our country's economic construction, there are many things that we
 should pay attention to.  Things which have important influence over the
 overall situation in the development of our country's socialist economy are
 not limited to the above-mentioned agriculture, energy, transport, education
 and science.  From some previous work experience, we realize that we should
 avoid adversely influencing the whole work because of neglecting it while'
 grasping the key links.  Therefore, the report urges "effective solution of
 these problems on the basis of an overall balance."  However, among several
 items it is absolutely necessary to regard some of them as our strategic
 priorities.  When people understand this point, they will know which kinds
 of work in our economic construction should be taken seriously.  This also
 enables us to make proper arrangements while formulating our plans.
 `Why should we regard science as a'strategic priority in economic construc-
 tion?  As the report pointed out, the most important reason is that "the
 modernization of science and technology is the key to the realization of the
 four modernizations."  Here I would like to express some specific views on
 this subject, placing emphasis on productive force, production relations and
 certain aspects of the superstructure.
 First of all, I would like to talk. about the direct influence of science on
 the development of productive forces.
 I intend to approach the subject from three angles:
 1.  Laborers are the most fundamental factors in the social productive
 ,force.  To ensure continued, steady and rapid development of social

 production and the realizatian of the strategic aims of our country's
 economic development for this century, we should have sufficient numbers of
 physical and mental laborers who have attained higher levels of knowledge
 and skill.
 However,. in our country, as the report has stressed, "large numbers of work-
 ers and staff members lack the necessary scientific knowledge, general edu-
 cation-and work skill and there is an acute shortage of skilled workers,
 scientists and technicians."  Complete figures concerning cultural and tech-
 nical levels of workers and staff members are not yet available.  The number
 of scientific and technical workers (the number of personnel in social
 sciences not included) who work in units under the ownership of the whole
 people in the engineering, agriculture, forestry and public health fields
 and those who are engaged in. teaching and research work amounts to 5.71
 million people.  The proportion of graduate students is very small and the
 number of university graduates and technical secondary school graduates
 accounts for 40 percent of the total number of scientific and technical
 workers.  The number of graduates of factory-run and spare-time universities
 and people with other qualifications accounts for 20 percent.  In other
 words, the number of scientific and technical workers in our country is
 small, only about 50 or so among 10,000 persons.  The percentage of scien-
 tific. and. technical workers in developed countries is much higher.   In the
 meantime, the level of our scientific and technical workers is not high
 compared with others.
 To be more specific, in 1981 there were only 330,000 agricultural and
 forestry technicians working in the units under the ownership of the whole
 people, accounting for 0.04 percent of the total agricultural population
 throughout the country.  In other words,. on average, there were 5 agricul-
 tural and forestry technicians per 100 production teams.  Even if the
 number of agricultural and forestry technicians working in the collective
 units is included, the total number did not increase considerably.  Apart
 from that, their technical level is uneven.  According to incomplete
 figures, on an average there is only one university or college graduate to
 every 10 communes and there is only one secondary technical school graduate
 to every 2 communes.  Among party and government cadres at all levels who
 are leading agricultural production, only a few have acquired professional
 knowledge.  According to a preliminary survey carried out among 2,448 cadres
 at the provincial, prefectural and county levels who led agricultural pro-
 duction, only 88 of them were graduates of agricultural college or a secon-
 dary agricultural school, accounting for only 3.6 percent of the total
 number of those who were surveyed.   ("Training Leading Cadres for Agricul-
 ture Is a Task Which Brooks No Delay," published in JIAOYU YANJIU, No 5,
 1981)
 The above-mentioned situation cannot but adversely affect the development
 of our economy.   If we fail to adopt very effective measures, the problem
 of low scientific and technical levels among laborers in our country will
 become more and more serious as our national economy continues to develop.

 To change this situation, we should, first of all, strengthen education.
 Therefore, the report regards the development of education as a key link in
 the strategic expansion.  It stresses:   "We must work vigorously to uni-
 vorsalize primary school education, strengthen secondary vocational educa-
 tion and higher education and develop educational undertakings of all types'
 and at all levels in both urban and rural areas, including train~ng,classes
 for cadres, workers, staff members and peasants and literacy classes in
 order to train all kinds of specialists and raise the scientific and
 educational level of the whole nation." `Rowever, education and science are
 inseparable.  The main task and contents ofeducational work in intellectual
 education is to pass on scientific knowledge.  In the meantime, the raising
 of teaching levels is also determined by the enhancement of the scientific
 level.  To ensure that our laborers possess knowledge and skills which con-
 form with modernized production, we should arm them with modern science.
 Therefore, training of talented persons is an important aspect of our
 efforts in making science serve economic development.  In the past when we
 talked about the role of scientific work, we often stressed the importance
 of making science serve the national economy and national defense, but
 seldom mentioned the act of making science serve education.  In his report
 .delivered at the 12th CPC Congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang closely integrates
 education with science and declares that they are the strategic key links
 in our country's economic construction.  This will help us to deepen our
 understanding of the significance of making science serve education in
 economic development.
 2.  With regard to the two essential factors of the social productive
 force, apart from the essential factor.of having laborers who possess cer-
 tain production knowledge and skills, we should also have another essential
 factor, that is, various means of labor (or instruments of labor) produced,
 mastered and utilized by laborers.  When world history developed into
 capitalist society, the creation and invention of the advanced means of
 labor or the significant improvement of the existing means of labor were'
 the results of scientific research.
 With regard to the relations between science and the progress of means of=
 labor, Marx and Engels made many brilliant expositions.  A few years ago,
 when we criticized the fallacy of the "gang of four" which negated the fact
 that science and technology are productive forces, many comrades quoted the
 works of Marx and Engels as proof of the criticism.  The following is the
 most frequently quoted passage:  "Natural work does not manufacture any
 machines, engines, railways, telegrams, spinning machines and so forth.
 They are the products of the labor of mankind.  They have become the organs
 mastered by the will of mankind in order to tame nature and the natural
 materials of the organs of mankind for carrying out activities in the natu-
 ral world.  They are the organs of mankind's minds which are created by the
 hands of'mankind and are the materialized force of knowledge.  The develop-
 ment of fixed capital has shown that social knowledge in general has become
 a direct productive force to a great extent.  Therefore, the conditions of
 the progress of social life are considerably controlled and reformed by
 intelligence in general.  This has demonstrated that social productive
 force has been produced to a'great extent not only as a form of knowledge,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 but also as a direct organ of social practice and the progress in actual
 life."  ("Complete Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 46, pp 219-220)
 ~anle, Comrades are not accustomed to the way Marx expressed his ideas and
 think that what. he said is difficult to understand.  Actually, it is easy
 to understand the passage.  What it means is that such a means of produc-
 tion as a machine is, of course, a "natural material," but it is not a
 natural thing.  It is a "natural material" which is "a product of the labor
 of mankind" and "created by the hands of mankind."  One of the differences
 between the role of this "natural material" and that of other "natural
 materials" is that the former is mastered by the "will of mankind" to
 "tame" things in nature.   In this respect, it has the same function as the
 "organs" of the human body.  It is like our arms, hands, legs and feet
 which are controlled by our will.  These means of labor are things directly
 used by mankind to carry out "social practice" and "be involved in the
 actual process of life."   They are the creation of the minds of mankind and
 things created by mankind by making use of knowledge and science.  There-
 fore, it is appropriate to say that they are the "organs of human minds" and
 the "materialized force of knowledge."  After they have been created, they
 can turn social knowledge in general into a direct productive force.  Due to
 the fact that under the capitalist system machines and other such things are
 regarded as fixed capital, the history of the development of the means of
 labor under the capitalist system is taken as the history of the development
 of fixed capital.  Therefore, Marx said that the history of the "development
 of fixed capital" reflects to what extent scientific knowledge has been
 turned into a direct productive force and how social productive force,
 which has been realized in the "form of knowledge," has been turned into
 the material productive force which has played a direct role in social
 practice and actual life with the creation, invention and production of
 .machines and other such things.
 We all know that social productive force is material force but that science
 itself is a spiritual thing.   Comrade Hu Yaobang says in his report:   "While
 changing the objective world, people also transform their subjective world
 and develop spiritual production and spiritual life in society..  The result
 of this constitutes spiritual civilization."  He also points out that the
 progress of science is the result of spiritual production in society and
 that science is an important aspect of spiritual civilization.   Since
 sciences belong to the spiritual side, a process of "materialization" is
 needed in order to turn them into material force.   The role of sciences in
 education which we talked about previously is manifested as materialization
 of sciences in the substance of the human brain; and the role of creation
 and invention in improving the means of labor which we are discussing now
 constitute the materialization of sciences in these means of labor.
 .With regard to the specific role of sciences in creating, inventing and
 improving the means of labor, anyone can cite many practical examples.   The
 whole of the recent history of the world proves this.  Here, we would like
 to remind people that they should not take the means of labor to mean
 merely machines and facilities.  A correct understanding should be:  All
 material means mastered by laborers to conquer and reform nature fall into
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 the category of the means of labor.  The increase in quantity and level of
 the instruments of labor and the creation and application of new means of
 labor play a role in promoting social production.  For instance, the role
 played by fine varieties in agriculture and animal husbandry is the same as
 that played by machines in industrial production.  By using them in produc
 tion, we can effectively enhance labor productivity in agriculture and
 animal husbandry and increase the output of agricultural products in
 society.  The successful cultivation of fine varieties is the result of
 materializing sciences.
 Let us cite hybrid rice as an example.  In 1970, scientific workers in our
 country discovered the scientific fact of the existence of a "wild sterile
 rice plant" (the wild staminiferous sterile rice plant).  In 1972, we suc-
 ceeded in cultivating a staminiferous sterile strain and its maintenance
 strain.  In 1973, we sorted out a number of superior rice plants of a
 renewing strain.  We. thus succeeded in cultivating "three complete strains"
 of rice plants--"sterile strain," "maintenance strain" and "renewing
 strain," and the first batch of nonglutinous hybrid rice plants was thus
 produced.  For many years scientists in foreign countries have tried hard
 to cultivate hybrid rice, but their efforts failed.  However, our scien-
 tific workers have succeeded in this respect and have cultivated a variety
 of high-yield hybrid rice.  After much hard work over the past few years,
 the acreage under hybrid rice was expanded to 80 million mu in 1980, and
 accumulated acreage since its popularization in 1980 amounted to 250 million
 mu and the accumulated output reached 27 billion jin.  These figures show
 that this newly created means of labor has brought great benefits to our
 country's agricultural production.  Moreover, the benefits it brings to
 society are permanent, that is, it will benefit the society year after
 year, and with the expansion of acreage under hybrid strains, the interests
 it brings to society will increase yearly.  This practical example shows us
 how s'ciences promote the development of our country's economy through the
 creation of new means of labor.
 3.   Social productive force does not mean the mechanical combination of the
 two essential factors of productive force mentioned above; it means an
 organic integration of these two factors.   Social productive force is
 organized material force.  Laborers, as one essential factor of productive
 force, are organized in accordance with certain divisions of labor.  Instru-
 mentseof labor, the other essential factor of productive force, are formed
 into a whole according to the movement of materials in the process of pro-
 duction and their links in space and time.  Laborers and means of labor are
 integrated according to a certain form.  Therefore, the three kinds of
 integration between laborers, between means of labor and between laborers
 and-means of labor all have the problem of whether they are integrated in
 the most rational and effective way.   They also have scientific problems
 which must be solved.  For instance, while carrying out a capital construc-
 tion project, we should do well in organizing work teams and arranging
 various kinds of machines and means of labor.  We should carry out the
 construction project in the most rational and effective way.  When we are
 ,building a factory, we should draw up designs concerning the installment'
 and arrangement of machines in every workshop.  The work of installing

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 machines should be done in accordance with designs drawn in the process of
 carrying out the project.  This is the way to complete the three kinds of
 integration mentioned above.
 The three aspects of integration mentioned above are part of the problem
 of the organization of productive force, and involve a number of scientific
 problems which should be solved and studied.  These three aspects are one
 of the important spheres in which sciences play an important role in the
 development of the economy.  So long as we study these scientific problems,
 achieve results, draw correct conclusions and apply these achievements to
 practical work, we will certainly be able to promote the development of the
 national economy.
 Here we are looking at the role of sciences in the development of the
 economy from the angle of turning sciences into direct productive forces.
 However, what we talk about and the examples we cite are based on the prac-
 tice pursued by an enterprise of production or a capital construction unit.
 If we extend our vision to the whole of society, we will encounter problems
 involved in organizing productive force and formulating plans within the
 sphere of the whole of society.  For example, we will encounter the problem
 of how to fully exploit and utilize human resources, land-resources and
 other economic resources in our country.  We will also encounter problems
 of how to apply and popularize advanced and appropriate production tech-
 nology, how to establish a rational structure of production, how to achieve
 the balanced development of the national economy, how to achieve the effec-
 tiveness of labor in the whole of society, how to enhance economic returns
 and so forth.  Scientific research will play a very big role in solving
 these important problems.  The reason why we regard sciences as an important
 strategic area in economic construction is because sciences can play a very
 important and active role in solving these problems.
 As well as understanding why we should take the development of scientific
 undertakings as a strategic link in the development of our country's economy,
 we should also consider another problem.  In other words,. we should under-
 stand the role of sciences in the development of production not only from the
 viewpoint that sciences can be turned into productive forces, but also from
 the viewpoint that sciences can solve problems arising in relations of pro-
 duction and in certain aspects of the superstructure.
 We have seen that in his report Comrade Hu Yaobang stresses the problem of
 the reform of the socialist economy system.  Analyzing why economic returns
 in various fields in our country are still poor, the report gives the rea-
 son that "there are still defects in the economic management system and the
 distribution system."  In his report, Comrade Hu Yaobang expresses the view
 that during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, "we should consolidate and improve
 initial reforms in the economic management system and firmly grasp the work
 of drawing up general plans and adopting measures for reforms."  He adds that
 during the Seventh Five-Year Plan, "we should gradually carry out the reform
 of the economic management system."

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 What is the socialist economic system?  My views on this issue are:  If by
 the fundamental socialist economic system we mean the unchanging foundation
 of socialist production relations in all socialist countries in all periods,,
 of development, then the socialist economic system means that various
 different socialist countries or one socialist country can have different
 specific socialist production relations in different periods.  The reform
 of the socialist economic system means that we should seek to establish an
 economic system which can promote social productive forces most effectively.
 The socialist economic system includes the production relations of the
 socialist state-operated economy and the collective economy in both rural
 and urban areas, and the structures of socialist ownership.  The problem of
 the economic system in a state-operated socialist economy, that is, the
 state-operated socialist economic management system, is important and com-
 plicated.  This involves economic relations between the state, enterprises
 and laborers and the relations between the state economic management organs
 and local economic management organs at all levels.  Labor wages, finance,
 goods prices, financial tax revenue,. state commerce, foreign trade and so
 forth face problems in the economic system.  As long as we can solve some
 of the problems which severely hamper economic development in these areas,
 social productive forces will be further liberated.  The complexity of the
 production relations within socialist collective ownership cannot of course
 be compared with that of thelproduction relations within the state-operated
 economy.,  However, the reform of the production relations within socialist
 collective ownership may also play a great role.  Since the third plenary
 session, we have implemented various systems of remuneration according to
 output in our country's rural areas.  This has demonstrated that any reforms
 which conform with the present level of productive force in our country will.
 have the effect of greatly promoting productive force.  The structures of
 socialist ownership in the socialist economic system include:   the specific
 forms of socialist ownership which should be adopted in China today; the
 percentage of socialist ownership in the entire economy at present, what
 kinds of relations should be`established and so forth.  For instance, at
 present we permit the existence of the following forms of socialist owner-
 ship:  1) the economy of socialist state ownership; 2) the economy of "urban
 collective ownership" whose nature should be analyzed more accurately;
 3) the economy of the collective ownership of the laboring masses in the
 rural areas; and 4).other socialist ownership.  Of these forms, the
 "socialist state-operated economy plays. the leading role in the national.
 economy," whereas other forms of the socialist ownership can develop only
 on condition that they link with and depend on the socialist state-operated
 economy and accept its leading role.
 As we mentioned above, since the concept of the socialist economic system
 covers a number of aspects and the problems involved in reforming these
 various aspects should be solved by scientific workers who can apply
 scientific knowledge which they have mastered, the role of sciences in
 promoting economic development should not be underestimated.
 Of course, to promote the development of the socialist economy, the problems
 concerning production relations which scientific workers should study are not
 limited only to the reform of the socialist economic system.  We realize

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 that under our country's present conditions, we should permit the existence
 of certain nonsocialist economic forms.  Therefore, we should study the
 issue which nonsocialist economic forms should be permitted, their position
 in our country's present socialist economic structures and the restrictions
 which should be imposed on them with regard to their existence and develop-
 ment.  We should also study ways to properly manage these nonsocialist
 economic forms so that the party and government may formulate correct
 policy decisions.  These are problems concerning the policies of our party
 and state toward the nonsocialist economy within a certain historical
 period.  If we achieve good results in the study of these problems, our
 research work will play its proper role in developing the national economy.
 Besides this, in order to do economic work properly, we should also study
 problems occurring in the realm of the superstructure.  The problem of the
 administrative and management organs in charge of economic work, the problem
 of economic legislation and judicature, the problem of extending socialist
 democracy to the sphere of economic life and so forth belong to this cate-
 gory.   The problem of improving state plans and management work also
 involves production relations and the superstructure.
 We should do our utmost to put our socialist economic construction on solid
 scientific foundations.  Since there are so many important scientific prob-
 lems to be solved in our country's economic construction work, and since
 scientific research can play such a great role in economic development, in
 addition to the fact that we suffered losses in our work in history due to
 the lack of scientific research and the fact that in the economic work
 departments, there are still many people who fail to understand the sig-
 nificance of scientific work and work blindly to a great extent because of
 this, and frequently solve problems according to old rules and conventions,
 then it is a matter of deep significance for the party to regard the develop-
 ment of scientific undertakings as one of the strategic links in our coun-
 try's economic construction.,
 The purpose of defining the strategic significance of sciences in our coun-
 try's economic development is to develop our country's scientific under-
 takings more efficiently.  We should not rest content with merely under-
 standing the significance of sciences.  Actions are more important.  Scien-
 tific workers should enthusiastically answer-the call of the 12th CPC
 Congress and work hard and struggle actively to implement and accomplish
 the guiding principles and tasks put forward by it (including, of course,
 the guiding principles and'tasks of developing our country's scientific
 undertakings).  Comrades working in other departments should also do their
 best to support scientific work in the light of their division of labor.
 Departments in charge of logistic and service work for scientific workers
 should also have a correct understanding of their service work in order to
 do it well.  Planning and financial departments should do their utmost to
 take seriously the work of allotting the necessary funds and making invest-
 ments in scientific work.   Comrades in charge of leadership work in various
 localities and departments should pay more attention to scientific work and
 strengthen party leadership over it.

 In his report, Comrade Hu Yaobang also points out:  "In the past, owing to
 the influence of 'left' ideas and the small-producer mentality, erroneous
 views such as the underestimation of the importance of education, science
 And culture were rife in our party. over a fairly long time."  He adds that
 the'party has "made great efforts to eliminate these incorrect views.  We
 are determined gradually to step up cultural development so that it will no
 longer lag behind economic growth.". He goes on to say:  "We have worked
 hard to carry out the party's policy concerning intellectuals and to enable
 the whole party and society to realize that, like workers and peasants,
 intellectuals are a force we must rely on in building socialism.  We are
 determined to do everything possible to create favorable conditions in
 which the mass of intellectuals can work securely and enthusiastically in
 the interests of the people."  This guiding ideology brought out by the
 report is closely connected with the development of our country's scien-
 tific undertakings.  We should attach importance to it and, as the report
 stresses, persist in "doing much careful ideological work and effective
 organizational work."
 The-above-mentioned points should be put into action in all spheres after
 defining the fact that scientific work is one of the strategic links in our
 country's economic construction.  With concerted efforts from all quarters,
 our country's scientific undertakings will develop more effectively and
 their great role in economic development will be fully demonstrated.

 AN IMPORTANT BASIS FOR REFORMING THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 19, 1 Oct 82 pp 21-26
 [Article by You Lin [2589 2651-] ]
 [Text]  In his report to the 12th CPC Congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang clearly
 explained the general purpose of reforming the economic system, briefly and
 profoundly'expounded the leading position of upholding the state-run economy
 and developing diverse economic forms, and the relations between the state
 and the enterprises of various economic forms, particularly the state-run
 enterprises.  He also pointed out the'correct implementation of the prin-
 ciple of the leading role of the planned economy and the supplementary role
 of market regulation and other important problems.  This has further
 pointed out the direction 'for establishing an economic management system
 that conforms with the conditions of our country and provides us with an
 important basis for reforming our economic system.
 Comrade Hu Yaobang pointed out in his "report":   "To yield the best results,
 all our economic work, principles, policies, plans and measures must be
 based on overall arrangement, on taking into consideration the interests of
 the state, the collective and the individual and on fully arousing and
 scientifically organizing the initiative of the central authorities, the
 localities, departments, enterprises and the laborers."  This is also
 applicable to the reform of the economic system.
 Why is it necessary to reform-our economic system?  In the final analysis,
 it is because there exist defects that are not conducive to stimulating the
 initiative of our economy in various fields.  After the basic accomplishment
 of socialist transformation, our party called on us to correctly handle the
 relations between the state, the production unit and the individual laborer,
 to correctly deal with -the relations between the central authorities and the
 localities, to appropriately divide the decisionmaking power in all fields
 and give consideration to -the interests of every aspect.  But actually we
 have for a long time neglected the power and interests of the localities,
 the production units and the individual laborers, thus causing the situation
 of inflexibility and excessive management from the center.  As manifested in
 the economic forms, a lot of work that was suitable for the collective and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 individual businesses to run was monopolized by the state; as manifested in
 planned management, the state attempted to manage all matters whether big or
 small and did not admit the necessity of regulation by market mechanism for
 the operation of enterprises and the production of some products, economic
 levers were seldom applied to guide economic activities for which it was
 unnecessary to issue mandatory quotas and there was excessive direct plan-
 ning; as manifested in financial affairs, there was monopoly in the income
 and expenditure of state-run enterprises and there was no profit retention
 by enterprises according to how well or badly they ran their business.
 Moreover, egalitarianism was,prevalent in the distribution of income among
 the laborers.  All these things have seriously affected the enterprises' and
 staff and workers' concern, proceeding from their material interests, for
 doing a good job of production, operation and management, and even if there
 were such enthusiasm, it would be difficult to bring it into play because
 they are bound hand and foot.
 Therefore, to reform the economic system we must, first of all, readjust the
 powers of various fields and particularly extend the powers of the enter-
 prises.  Enterprises are the basic units engaging in economic activities.
 The initiative of enterprises, great or small, greatly affects the speed at
 which the national economy can be developed.  In order to actively exercise
 their duty according to concrete conditions, the enterprises should have
 certain power in planning and arrangements, purchasing and selling of goods,
 the use of funds, disposition of productivity, and so on.  Under the pre-
 requisite of accepting planned guidance by the state and administration by
 industrial and commercial offices, the cooperative enterprises collectively
 owned by the laboring people should have complete initiative in their own
 hands.  It is also quite necessary for state-run enterprises to have
 initiative in operation and management.  This initiative is of course
 limited and is within the range of state permission and observation of
 unified-state direction.  If it goes beyond this limitation, it would
 impair or even change the nature of the state enterprises and cause confu=sion in our socioeconomic life.  Even within this limitation, the state
 should conduct guidance, and check and supervise the enterprises on how to
 .execute their power to prevent blindness due to abuse of their power.
 It is very important to handle well the relations between the central
 authorities and the localities, that is, the vertical and horizontal rela-
 tions in our country.  Ours is a large country with great differences in
 various provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.   It is unnecessary
 and impossible for the center to concretely control all their economic
 activities.  Past experience proves that if the central authorities control
 things too meticulously, they stifle the initiative of the localities.  This
 is one aspect of the situation.  On the other hand, we must also be aware
 that the development of the localities cannot be divorced from the situation
 as a whole.  For instance, many basic installations and production conditions
 need overall planning by the state and those economic conditions that are
 connected with the situation as a whole need to be provided by the central
 authorities.  Without the efforts of the central authorities, it would also
 be impossible for the economy of various localities to develop successfully.
 Therefore, we must implant the idea of coordinating all the activities of the

 nation like moves on a chessboard, and under the prerequisite of subordi-
 nating part to the whole, fairly combine the initiative of the localities
 with that of the central authorities.
 The readjustment of power in.various fields is important for arousing the
 initiative in various respects.  But under socialism, what is still more
 important is to readjust the relations of material interests in various
 fields.  According to the Marxist viewpoint, fundamentally, all the activ-
 ities of people are for material interests, that is, they are all prompted
 by material interests.  The problem is, material interests have different
 class nature and social nature in different societies.  In the socialist
 economy of our country, the public ownership of the means of production
 combines all production units and laborers together and the interests of the
 whole of the working people become their fundamental interests.  Under this
 prerequisite, they still have partial and individual interests.  The inter-
 ests of the whole of the working people are not only the common interests
 of each member as part of the whole, but also the common interests of the
 laborers as members of a certain production unit and as individuals.  This
 is because the development of some production units, including the produc-
 tion units under the collective ownership system, depends on the development
 of the entire social economy; and the improvement of the standard of living
 of the working people and particularly of. the workers of the state-run
 enterprises depends on increasing social production and raising labor pro-
 ductivity.   Therefore, we must unswervingly maintain that increasing and
 promoting the interests of the whole is the main objective and motive force
 of the'state-run enterprises in carrying out economic activities.  As for
 enterprises in the collective ownership system, besides their own interests,
 they should also show consideration for the interests of .the state and, in
 addition to the interests of their own unit, they should also have other
 objectives and motive force.  We must also be aware that in addition to the
 impetus of common interest, there are also the interests of the localities,
 departments, production units and laborers.  For instance, providing the
 state enterprises with necessary material interests, so that there is a
 definite connection between the achievements of enterprise operation and
 the collective and individual interests of the enterprise workers, makes the
 workers work more diligently and the enterprises try by every means to run
 management and operation well.  Excessive emphasis on the interests of the
 latter respects, or even overemphasis on them at the expense of the inter-
 ests of the whole, is certainly wrong; neglecting or even denying them is
 also wrong.  Facts have repeatedly proved that neglecting the interests of
 any one respect will affect the initiative in that respect and hinder the
 development of the national economy.  Our task is to correctly handle the
 relations of interest in various respects in the light of the concrete
 conditions prevailing at any one time, so that they can coordinate, cooperate
 and help one another forward.
 In a word, the purpose of reforming our economic system is to fully arouse
 the initiative of various fields through readjusting their powers and inter-
 ests'so that they can play their role as effectively as possible and promote
 the building of socialist modernization.

 In reforming the economic system, we must rationally define the relations
 between the state and enterprises.  The relations between the state and
 enterprises includes what enterprises should be operated and owned by the
 state, and how the state should manage state-run enterprises, collective
 enterprises owned by the laboring masses and the individual economy.  In
 his report, Comrade Hu Yaobang made ample exposition on this problem.
 Comrade Hu Yaobang clearly pointed out in his "report" that we must develop
 diverse economic forms under the prerequisite of upholding the leading posi-
 tion of the state-run economy.  So-called diverse economic forms, in addi-
 tion to the state sector, refer first of all to the cooperative economy
 collectively owned by the laboring masses.  This kind of economic form
 should be the main form in rural areas not only at present but also for a
 considerable time to come.  A considerable part of handicrafts, industry,
 building industry, transport, commerce and service trades in cities and
 towns should also be run by the collective.  Next is the individual economy
 of the laborers.  We must encourage the appropriate development of the
 individual economy of urban and rural laborers as a necessary and useful
 complement to the public economy, within limits prescribed by the state and
 under the supervision of industrial and commercial administrations.   Why
 must we do this?  In sum, it suits the productive forces of our country at
 the present stage.  The development level of the productive forces of our
 country at the present stage is low and very unbalanced.   On the one hand,
 we have a large number of enterprises with a high level of socialization in
 production.  The very nature of these enterprises demands ownership and con-
 trol by the whole society and that they be operated by the state as the
 representative of society.  On the other hand, we also have many enter-
 prises with a rather low level of socialization in production; they are
 suited to collective operation and some are only suited to individual opera-
 tion.  If the state also owned and operated these enterprises, it would be
 unfavorable for giving scope to their specialization and the initiative of
 the working people who operate these enterprises, consequently affecting the
 development of the entire economy.  As Comrade Hu Yaobang said in his
 "report":  "Only through the rational distribution and development of
 diverse economic forms is it possible to invigorate the urban and rural
 economy and make life more convenient for the people."
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, cooperatives
 financed and run by young people and other residents have spread in many
 urban areas.   The number of individual workers in urban areas has gradually
 increased, by 1981 they had reached 1.13 million people.  A number of
 localities have turned small-scale state-run commercial and service trade
 enterprises, such as public bathhouses, barbershops, garment shops and retail
 shops into cooperatives or let workers undertake and operate them on a
 collective or individual basis.  These localities have also turned the
 "collective" enterprises with unified responsibility for profits and losses
 into enterprises with sole responsibility for their own profits and losses.
 We have achieved quite good results in the above undertakings.  It seems
 that from now on, in addition to energetically developing the cooperative

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 economy collectively owned by the laboring masses and appropriately develop--
 ing the individual economy, the small and fairly small-scale state-run
 enterprises can also be turned into enterprises with sole responsibility
 for their own profits and losses in the light of need and possibility.
 In China, not only can the socialist economy. not abolish the state-run
 economy, on the contrary, it must uphold the leading position of the
 state-run economy.  The state should own and operate the departments and
 enterprises such as banks, railways, civil aviation, river and ocean going
 shipping, posts and telecommunications, steel, nonferrous metals, fuel,
 electricity, machine building, chemical industry, building materials,,
 textiles, light industry and enterprises in other important departments,
 wholesale departments, a considerable number of retail shops in the field
 of commerce, and so on.  With these departments and enterprises in hand, the
 state controls the economic lifelines of the country.  The state sector can
 thus play the leading role in the entire national economy.   In his "report,"
 Comrade Hu Yaobang drew a scientific inference:  "The consolidation and
 growth of the state sector are the decisive factors in ensuring that the
 collective economy of the laboring masses will advance along the socialist
 road and that the individual economy will serve socialism."  The profound
 ,implications of this inference merit our careful comprehension.  As known
 to all, in capitalist society, there are cooperatives run by members who are
 shareholders that draw extra dividends according to the amount of shares
 they possess.   These cooperatives are usually manipulated by a few people
 who have most of the shares, and the operation in particular cannot but be
 subject to the control of capitalist production and circulation.  Therefore,
 essentially it is still a sort of "collective capitalist organization."  In
 a socialist country, only when the cooperative economy is combined with the
 socialist state-run economy, can its nature be fundamentally changed.  Only
 a powerful state-run economy can energetically guide its operation and
 management in accordance with the principles of socialism so that it
 develops along the road of socialism.  Without this form and without the
 energetic guidance of the state-run economy, by only relying on the manage-
 ment of the socialist state "regime, it would be difficult to restrict the
 possibility of spontaneous tendencies and getting out of hand departing
 from the interests of the whole.   Therefore, under the conditions of China,
 there would be no socialist-economic system and socialist planned economy
 with only the collective economy and without the state-run economy.  This
 is true for the collective economy as well as for the individual economy.
 The individual economy is always attached to the economic form that occupies
 the dominant position.   Only with the existence and development of the pub-
 lic ownership economy that upholds the leading position of the state-run
 economy and under supervision by the industrial and commercial administra-
 tive departments, can the individual economy be a complement to the social-
 ist economy and serve socialism.
 In order to ensure the leading position of the state-run economy, we must
 define the relations between the state-run enterprises.  First of all, as
 for the state-run economy, the state is certainly the owner of the enter-
 prises and controls important activities of the enterprises.  On no account
 should we neglect the achievements of the state-run economy due to the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 defects of the economic system and neither should we have the idea of there
 being no hope in modernization without thoroughly abolishing the state-run,
 enterprises.  What will happen if we abolish the state-run economy in our
 country, turn the state-run enterprises into independent economic bodies and
 allow the enterprises themselves to completely manage the regular economic
 decisionmaking of the enterprises?  It would mean to separate again the
 "productive force that is not suitable for any other management except
 management by society" ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 3, p 319)
 spoken of by Engels; not only placing the secondary but also the main part
 of industry and commerce under the control of the collective ownership by
 the laboring masses who are vast in number and scattered, so that they are
 combined in narrow spheres, causes acute contradiction between mass produc-
 tion and partial ownership.  Under such circumstances, they will contend
 with each other for their own partial benefit and the interests of the whole
 of the laboring masses would be undermined and impaired.  It is quite
 obvious that this certainly cannot be the foundation of our economic
 management.
 We must also not regard the state enterprises as an abacus, taking every
 action by moving the beads, we must not collect all the profits of the
 enterprises without letting them retain any.  As we have mentioned before,
 under the unified control of the state, it is quite necessary for the
 enterprises to have certain flexible power and benefit.  Recently, we have
 achieved quite good results in extending the power of the enterprises and
 applying the system of economic responsibility.  Its main significance is
 that we have effectively overcome the idea of egalitarianism between the
 enterprises and between the workers in the enterprises, so that the enter-
 prises and workers are further motivated in running the enterprises well
 and tapping potentials.   It is unquestionable that by applying the
 economic responsibility system, we need above all to define the economic
 responsibility that the enterprises have to undertake toward the state and
 that the workers have to undertake toward the enterprise respectively, and
 at the same time provide the enterprises with certain economic powers and
 due economic benefits so as to combine responsibility, power and benefit,
 together.
 One of'the fundamental problems in the reform of the economic system is to
 correctly implement the principle of the leading role of the planned economy
 and the supplementary role of market regulation.
 As the opposite of the anarchy of capitalist production, the planned economy
 came into being after the realization of the public ownership system.  Under
 the capitalist system, on the one hand there is organizational division of
 labor in capitalist enterprises, while on the other the whole social pro-
 duction is subject to control by spontaneous forces.  In capitalist society,
 the laborers forfeit their right to control their own social relations and
 the distribution of social labor in various departments is completely regu-
 lated by the market.  The necessary...proportion of mass production is only

 reluctantly maintained through fierce turbulence and crises and with the
 national economy constantly suffering serious disruption.  But under the
 public ownership system, due to the elimination of the separation of the
 ownership toward socialized production and the establishment of direct
 links between production and demand, it is then necessary and possible for
 the national economy to develop in a planned way.  The words "planned
 economy based on public ownership" mentioned by Comrade Hu Yaobang in his
 "report" pointed out the interdependent relations between the planned
 economy and the public ownership system.  One of the characteristic
 economic laws of socialism and communism is that the national economy
 develops in a planned way.  Planned economy came into being on the basis
 of public ownership and from another important aspect it also manifests
 the essence of the socialist economy.
 The socialist economy must be developed in a planned way.  But in a certain
 period of a country, the range, length and height of planning can only be
 determined according to the concrete conditions.   Comrade Hu Yaobang pointed
 out in his "report":   "Planned production and circulation cover the main
 body of our national economy.  At the same time, the production and circu-
 lation of some products are allowed to be regulated through the market
 without being planned, that is, by letting the law of value spontaneously
 play a regulatory role, within the limits prescribed by the state's unified
 plan and in the light of the specific conditions at different periods.
 This serves as a supplement to planned production and circulation, subordi-
 nate and secondary to it but essential and useful nonetheless.  The state
 ensures proportionate and coordinated growth of the national economy through
 overall balance by economic planning and the supplementary role of market
 regulation."  In sum, we must uphold the principle of the leading role of
 the planned economy and the supplementary role of market regulation for a
 long time.
 What is the objective basis of this principle?  First of all, in the
 national economy of our country, the economy under the public ownership
 system occupies the dominant position, while the state-run economy also
 occupies a leading position.   This determines that the principal part of
 the national economy must be planned production and planned circulation.
 Otherwise, the economy under the public ownership system would be in a state
 of decentralization and would not develop normally.   Second, in the economy
 under the public ownership system, there are a considerable number of
 collective enterprises owned by the laboring masses and state enterprises
 that can be turned into enterprises with sole responsibility for their own
 profits and losses.  There also exist a small individual economy outside
 the public ownership system.  The production and circulation of part of the
 products of these enterprises should be carried in a planned way, while the
 production and circulation of another part of products (mainly various small
 commodities) should be arranged by the enterprises themselves in accordance
 with the changes of supply and demands on the market.  Certainly, the state
 should not try to refuse to have anything more to do with the matter, but
 should strengthen control through policies, decrees and administration by
 industrial and commercial administrative departments and should help enter-
 prises with the supply of certain important raw and semifinished materials.

 There were many defects in our planned work in the past, among them an
 important point is that planning covered a wide variety of things and no
 products or enterprises were excluded from plans to be regulated by the
 market. The result was what should have been strictly controlled was not
 controlled strictly enough, that is,.what'.should' have.%been incorporated
 into the plan was not strictly controlled, thus weakening the'scientific and
 authoritative nature of the plans; what should have been flexible was not
 flexible enough, that is, what should not have been incorporated into the
 plan was controlled, thus causing the variety of commodities to be
 monotonous, lacking in quality and causing inconvenience to the people's
 life.  This shows that to ensure the coordinated and proportionate develop-
 ment of the national economy, we must mainly rely on the overall balance of
 the planned economy and at the same time make use of the supplementary role
 of market regulation.
 Allowing the production and circulation of part of the products not to be
 planned but regulated by the market, will this affect the nature of the
 planned economy?   Certainly not.   That is because, first, it is just supple-
 mentary to the planned economy and is subordinate to the planned economy;
 and second, the range of market regulation is determined by unified planning.
 Therefore, our economy, in general, is a unified planned economy.
 .In order to make the development of the economy centralized and unified as
 well as flexible and diversified, besides the part that needs not be planned,
 the part that needs planned production and circulation should also take
 different forms in different circumstances.
 One kind is, plans of a mandatory nature must be enforced in regard to the
 production and distribution of means of production and means of sub-
 sistence in the state sector. which are vital to the national economy and
 the people's livelihood, and especially in key enterprises vital to the
 whole economy.  The "report" indicated:  "This is a major manifestation of
 China's socialist system of ownership by the whole people in the organization
 and management of production."  This important inference helps us to further.
 clarify any misunderstanding.  The realization of the power of the state as
 the owner must undoubtedly be manifested in the distribution of income, but
 what is more important is that it is manifested in directing the production
 and operation of enterprises that must be directed by the state.   In our
 socialist economy, if the state has only the right of ownership of some
 state-run enterprises, but has no power to control the means of production
 and labor force, that is, no power to direct the production and operation
 of the enterprises, then these enterprises are no longer state-run enter-
 prises.  Even for the collective economy, the state should issue mandatory
 quotas in accordance with needs; for instance, for the purchase of fixed
 quotas of grain and other important agricultural and sideline products by
 the state.  This is by no means to say that mandatory planning cannot be
 appropriately reduced, it is.entirely necessary for the state-run enter-
 prises to have more flexibility.   But the production and distribution of
 important products and the economic activities of the'important enterprises
 must be carried out according to the state's mandatory plans.  Only in this
 way can we stabilize the economic situation, ensure the proportionate

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 development of the national economy, and effectively bring into play the
 role of guiding plans, and the part regulated by the market can be a useful
 complement to the planned economy.  Therefore, mandatory plans are neces-
 sary not only under specific conditions, but also necessary and indispen-
 sable under general conditions.  It is in fact the crux of the principle of
 the leading role of the planned economy and the supplementary role of market
 regulation and the basic indication of a planned economy.
 Another kind is, enforce guiding plans for some products and enterprises
 that are less important compared to the products and enterprises that
 practice mandatory planning, by applying economic levers to ensure their
 realization.  The enterprises have the right to change the plans and quotas
 issued by the state, but must report them to the responsible departments
 for the record.  When necessary, the state can also exercise administrative
 intervention.
 Aimed at the defects of the past of not attaching importance to the role of
 the market and not being good at applying the law of value and economic
 levers, the "report" pointed out that, whether in mandatory planning or in
 guidance planning, we must strive to make them conform to objective reality,
 constantly study changes in market supply and demand, and consciously make
 use of the law of value.  For instance, when plans demand that production
 of certain products in short supply be increased and that production of some
 products in excessive supply be reduced, list the price of the former
 products-a bit higher and the latter a bit lower, then that will promote
 the accomplishment of the plans.  Certainly, we cannot exaggerate this role
 and think that the part under the planned economy should also be regulated
 by'the market.  By regulating, we mean determining what kind of products
 are produced, their quantity and how to control them.  The market regula-
 tion mentioned in the "report" is controlled by the fluctuations of prices
 caused by the changes of market supply and demand.   It is quite obvious that
 the enterprises that enforce mandatory planning are not the same.   The
 enterprises that enforce guidance planning are directly affected by changes
 of price, taxation and credits, but these economic levers are applied by the
 state in a planned way.   Therefore, they are controlled by planning and not
 regulated by the market.
 The principle of reforming the economic system of our country in the future
 is to adopt the forms of mandatory planning, guidance planning and market
 regulation in accordance with the different circumstances of products and
 enterprises.   Enforcing this principle is a major reform compared with the
 present planned management system.  At the same time, we must correspond-
 ingly reform other aspects of the management system (for instance, gradually
 reform the pricing system and price control under the prerequisite of
 basically keeping prices stable).  The tasks are great and certainly
 cannot be accomplished in a short time.   The "report" pointed out that we
 must work out at an early date the overall plan for reform'and the measures
 for its implementation in the Sixth Five-Year Plan and gradually develop the
 reform of the economic management system in the Seventh Five-Year Plan.
 This arrangement is positive and safe as well.  Provided that we follow the
 direction pointed out by. the party Central Committee, comprehensively

 this basis work out feasible overall plans for reform and the measures for

 tions.

 EXCERPTS FROM SPEECHES MADE AT A FORUM ON STUDYING 12TH CPC CONGRESS
 DOCUMENTS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 19, 1 Oct 82 pp 27-34
 [Text]  Editorial note:  On 17-18 September, this
 periodical invited some comrades from economic
 circles to a forum on studying the documents of the
 12th party congress.  Excerpts from speeches at the
 forum will be published in.succession starting from
 this issue.
 Xue Mugiao [5641 2550 2890]:  "Build Socialism With Chinese Characteristics"
 In his report to the 12th party congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang expounded in
 great detail the new guiding ideology of socialist modernization which has
 gradually developed from the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central
 Committee.  In his opening speech at the congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping
 made a high level summary of this guiding ideology by pointing out:   "To
 integrate the universal truth of Marxism with the concrete realities of
 China, blaze a path of our own and build socialism with Chinese charac-
 teristics--this is the basic conclusion we have reached in summing up long,
 historical experience."
 Ours was a backward semicolonial and semifeudal country before liberation.
 After more than three decades of construction since liberation, great
 changes have taken place in the outlook of our country.  However, viewed
 from the level of its economic development, China is still a developing
 country with the peasants accounting for the great majority of the people.
 In order to build our country, on such a base, into a modern socialist state
 with a high degree of civilization and democracy, it is of course necessary,
 to proceed from reality and take our own path.  As I understand it, socialism
 with Chinese characteristics should chiefly be provided with the following
 features:
 1.  With respect to ownership, we are still unable to establish what Marx
 called ownership by the whole society.  Neither should we indiscriminately
 copy the pattern of what Stalin called coexistence between ownership by the
 whole people and collective ownership.  Due to the relatively low and uneven
 development of China's productive forces, the forms of ownership should be

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 more complex.  Ownership by the whole people and collective ownership should
 act as a base and there should be long-term coexistence of diversified
 economic forms.  Even the economy under the ownership of all the people and
 under collective ownership should also practice, in light of different
 specific conditions, various methods of management and administration.  Iti
 agricultural production, particularly the agricultural production that
 relies chiefly on manual labor, it is necessary to establish various forms
 of the production responsibility system by bringing into play the initia-
 tive of unified management by the collective and independent management
 by the laborer.  It is necessary to have both unified planning-by the
 collectives and division of labor with individual responsibility between
 the individual, household and group.  The state economy should not assume
 overall responsibility for profits or losses.  It should in the light of
 different conditions,. practice different forms of the economic responsibil-
 ity system to different degrees, including the responsibility system for
 profits or losses.  In cities, it is also necessary to develop the economy
 under collective ownership (including small cooperatives characterized by
 fund raising, joint labor and distribution chiefly according to labor) and
 a small amount of individual economy.  Will the development of nonsocialist'
 economic forms (such as individual economy) in cities weaken the leading
 position of the socialist state economy?  No.  In the early 1950's,
 privately, owned industrial and commercial enterprises were in extensive
 operation, but the state economy was still in a leading position.  Now the
 state economy is very powerful.  The existence of a small number of non-
 socialist economic forms will not affect the leading position of the state
 economy but is a necessary and useful supplement to the state economy.
 2.  It is necessary to handle the relationship between agriculture, light
 and heavy industry and the question of speed according to China's charac-
 teristics.  The 156 projects,, chiefly heavy industry, carried out in the
 period of the First Five-Year Plan attained very good construction results.
 However, the development of agriculture and light industry was rather slow,
 with the result that they failed to fully meet the needs of urban indus-
 trial development and the people's livelihood.  Therefore, Comrade Mao
 Zedong pointed out in 1956 that, while giving priority to the development
 of heavy industry, it is necessary to attach special importance to the
 development of agriculture and light industry and to develop heavy industry,
 with the funds accumulated from agriculture and light industry.  It was a
 pity that, starting in 1958, a 3-year "Great Leap Forward" was launched,
 which resulted in a serious. disproportion between agriculture, light and
 heavy industry.  It was not until 1965 that the disproportion was basically
 reversed by means of readjustment.
 The 10 years of national disorder during the "Cultural Revolution" threw the
 entire national economy into disorder.  In the 2 years after the smashing
 of the "gang of four," continued implementation of the "left" policy once
 again revealed the disproportion between agriculture and light and heavy
 industry, which had developed over the years.  After its third plenary
 session, the CPC Central Committee put forward the principle of readjusting,
 restructuring, reorganization and upgrading, gradually reduced investment
 in,capital construction, readjusted the ratio between agriculture and light

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 and heavy industry and greatly improved the livelihood of the people so that
 a prosperous new situation emerged in the national economy.  However, the
 achievements of readjustment have not been consolidated and the reform of
 the economic management system has just started.  We have not been able to
 effect a fundamental turn for the better in the financial and economic
 situation.  In his report to the 12th party congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang
 said that during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, it is necessary to con-
 tinuously implement the policy of readjusting, restructuring, reorganiza-
 tion and upgrading, practice-strict economy, oppose waste and focus all
 economic work on the attainment of better economic results.   It is very
 important to do so.
 It was also pointed out in the report that, in the two decades between 1981
 and the end of this century, we should strive, while steadily working for
 more and better economic results, to quadruple the gross annual value of
 industrial and agricultural production.  In order to realize this objective,
 we must take the following two steps in our strategic planning:  In the
 first decade, aim mainly at laying a solid foundation, accumulating
 strength and creating the necessary conditions; and in the second, usher in
 a new period of vigorous economic development.   This strategic plan has been
 formulated in the light of China's specific current conditions.  In order to
 bring into full play the economic results of production, we should no longer
 blindly seek false production growth rate.  In the period of the Sixth Five-
 Year Plan, we would rather have a temporary slower production growth rate
 in order to focus our chief attention on the attainment of better economic
 results.  Provided that we can achieve this point, we will certainly be
 able to usher in the new period of vigorous economic growth in the 1990's.
 3.  It is necessary to continuously carry out reform of the economic
 management system.  Since the First Five-Year Plan, we have gradually
 effected planned management of the national economy on the basis of public
 ownership of the, means of production.  This conforms to the requirements of
 socialist economy.  The chief shortcomings in our previous work lay in the
 fact that in certain aspects we set too many or too rigid restrictions
 through planning and thus hampered the initiative of the localities and
 enterprises.  In his report, Comrade Hu Yaobang pointed out:  Planning
 should take different forms in different circumstances.   Plans of a manda-
 tory nature, guidance plans and. regulation within certain limits by market
 mechanism must be enforced according to the importance of products and
 enterprises in the national economy and the people's livelihood.  In both'
 mandatory planning and guidance planning, we must strive to conform to
 objective reality, constantly study changes in market supply and demand,
 conscientiously make use of the law of value and such economic levers as
 pricing, taxation and credits to guide the enterprises in fulfilling state
 plans, and give them varying degrees of power to make decisions as they see
 fit.  Only in this way can state plans be supplemented and improved as
 required and in good time in the course of their implementation.  We must
 correctly define the respective scope and limits of mandatory plans,
 guidance plans and regulation by market mechanism and establish an economic
 administrative system suited to China's conditions so as to ensure the
 healthy growth of the national economy.

 Over the past 3 years we have gradually expanded the powers of various
 localities and enterprises in making decisions and have attained good
 results in bringing into play the initiative and creativity of localities
 and enterprises.  The problem is that, after the expansion of the power of
 localities and enterprises in making decisions, the restricting role of
 mandatory planning. has been weakened to a certain degree, bringing about
 various phenomena such as blind production and duplicate construction.
 Therefore, it is necessary for us to formulate a complete set of economic
 laws and regulations in order to prevent the various localities and enter-
 prises from abusing their power of decisionmaking.  It is particularly
 necessary to be good at applying the economic levers in order to ensure
 the satisfactory accomplishment of mandatory planning and guidance
 planning.
 Reform of the planning system is not only confined to the planning system
 itself but also involves the.systems. of credits, labor, wages as well as
 financial management.  These reforms. can only. be achieved gradually.
 Yang Bo [2799 3134]:  "State and Tasks of Light Industry in the New Situa-
 tion"
 The strategic objective, emphases and measures and the series of.principles
 and policies for China's economic construction listed in the report to the
 12th party congress are the outcome of integrating Marxism-Leninism with
 China's reality.  They are all correct.  Provided that we unswervingly and
 realistically work in the spirit of the. 12th party congress and conscien-
 tiously do our jobs well, we will certainly be able to realize our strategic
 objective.  Here, I would like to talk about industrial development.
 There is a view which holds that since no mention was made of the three
 strategic emphases of economic construction issued by the 12th party con-
 gress, the future development of light industry may perhaps be slowed down
 or relaxed.  In my opinion this view is incorrect.  As a matter of fact,
 grasping the three emphases of agriculture, energy and transport and educa-
 tion and science is conducive to the more speedy development of light
 industry and other production and construction undertakings and the steady
 improvement of people's living standards.  1) For a considerably long
 period in the past, China's light industry has primarily relied on agri-
 culture for its raw materials.  The reason for light industrial output value
 to register an average annual increase of 10 percent over the past 3 years
 is a direct outcome of the speed development of agriculture, particularly
 the diversified undertakings. Only by strengthening agriculture in the
 future will it be possible to ensure the steady growth of light industry..
 2) Although the ratio of energy consumption in light industrial production
 is smaller than in heavy industry, its absolute amount will become more
 and more.  Only when energy construction has been developed will it be
 possible for light industry to develop more speedily.  At the same time, the
 development of communications and transportation also constitutes a basic
 condition in ensuring the allocation of raw materials-for light industrial
 production and the sales of light industrial products.  3) The development
 of educational and scientific undertakings is a fundamental guarantee for'

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 improving the technological and management level of light industrial produc-
 tion.                     At present, the scientific and technical strength of light industrial
 departments is weaker than that of other departments, with the scientific
 and technical personnel accounting for only 1.06 percent of all staff mem-
 bers and workers.  The technical force of No 2 light industry is even
 weaker.  Without competent technical and management personnel armed with
 modern scientific knowledge and without advanced technological equipment,
 it is difficult to raise the level of light industrial development.  There-
 fore, the fact that the CPC Central Committee has designated agriculture,
 energy and transport and education and science as the strategic emphases
 has not weakened or overlooked the development of light industry but has
 created better conditions for the development of light industry.  Just as
 Comrade Hu Yaobang, in his report to the 12th party congress, pointed out:
 "Effective solution of these problems on the basis of an overall balance in
 the national economy will lead to a fairly swift rise in the production of
 consumer goods, stimulate the development of industry as a whole and of
 production and construction in other fields and ensure a betterment of
 living standards."
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, following
 the speedy development in consumer goods production, great changes have
 taken place in China's market supply conditions.  The phenomenon of "buying
 whatever goods are available and joining a queue when there is one" that
 was in existence for many years in the past has basically disappeared.  The
 masses of people have changed their practice from holding money in readiness
 for panic purchase into saving money for the right moment to purchase or
 holding. money in readiness for a purchase of their choice.  However, this cer-
 tainly .,does not mean that the development of China's light industry is
 good enough.  As a matter of fact, there is still a very wide gap between
 the production of consumer goods and the needs of the masses of people and,
 in particular, we are still far from being able to meet the needs of the
 800 million peasants in the vast rural markets.. Now, when people begin to
 have some choice concerning the quality, designs and colors of light indus-
 trial products, we have discovered, in our light industrial production, the
 problem of many products which do not conform to-the needs of the people.
 For example, some products are .unmarketable and have to be kept in stock for
 a long time.  This is primarily because their quality is poor and their
 designs and colors are not readily marketable.  What demands should we set
 on our work in this new situation?   Generally speaking, we can summarize
 them'in two sentences, that is, "change the look and improve the quality."
 By changing the look we mean that it is necessary for us to:   1) change the
 backwardness manifested in poor quality and few designs and colors in indus-
 trial products; and 2) change the., mental outlook of the staff and workers to
 enable them to keep abreast of the development of the objective situation.''
 Every person, from the leading cadres to every staff member or worker,
 should enhance revolutionary vigor and jointly fight for the realization of
 the grand objective set forth by the 12th party congress.  By improving
 quality we mean that it is necessary to vigorously improve our technological
 and-management level and to attach particular importance to the application
 and popularization of new technology.  In brief, we should focus all our
 work on the attainment of better economic results and cultivate the idea of

 wholeheartedly serving the broad masses of consumers.  It is necessary to
 take into account the needs of the 200 million urban inhabitants but it is
 all the more necessary to focus our work on meeting the needs of the 800
 million peasants.  Not only is it necessary to pay attention to the economic
 results in relation to the state and supply the state with more accumulation,
 it is also necessary to pay attention to the beneficial results of products
 when used by customers and to think about the interests of customers.  It is
 necessary to pay good attention to current production and have long-term
 planning.  Great efforts should be made to produce more and better light
 industrial products which are cheap and readily marketable and to step up
 sales service in order to satisfy as much as possible the broad masses of
 consumers.  This also constitutes a requirement of the basic socialist
 economic law.  Moreover, it should.be pointed out that our light industrial
 departments bear the heavy responsibility of building socialist material and
 spiritual civilization.  At present, in the production of some consumer
 goods, there is a phenomenon of blindly imitating the so-called new patterns
 from foreign countries or pandering to the vulgar interests of certain
 people.  This should merit our attention.  The manufacture of material
 products should help but not obstruct the building of socialist spiritual.
 civilization.
 Li Chengrui [2621 2052 3843]:  "Quadrupling the Gross Annual Value of
 Industrial and Agricultural Production Should Be Based on Improving the
 Economic Results"
 The grand objective expounded in the report to the 12th party congress con-
 sists of unity between quality and quantity and unity between results and
 speed.  Quadrupling the gross annual value of industrial and ;agricultural
 production should be based on improving the economic results.   Both are
 closely related with, and are inseparable from, each other.  The key to
 achieving a fundamental turn for the better in the financial and economic
 situation in the next 5 years lies in improving the economic results and
 maintaining suitable and realistic speed in order to create more net income
 and, on this basis, strike a close balance between revenue and expenditure
 and in credits.  Exaggerated speed and overstock of products will bring
 about a phenomenon of sham income and real expenditure in finance and sham
 deposits are real loans in the bank, making it impossible to strike a real
 balance.
 Compared with the 10 years of internal disorder, our economic results have
 markedly increased over the past few years.   From 1979-1981, the gross
 annual value of agricultural production increased by 26.1 billion yuan,
 about 60 percent of which was due to improvements in labor productivity.
 The proportion of agricultural production cost has dropped from 34.9 percent
 in 1978 to 31.4 percent in 1981.  A number of advanced industrial enter-
 prises have also achieved very good successes in improving economic results.
 Generally speaking, however, the present economic results are still very
 poor.  In industrial enterprises with independent accounting under the
 ownership of the whole people, the revenue and profit derived from 100 yuan
 of capital (net value of fixed asset plus flowing capital quota) was 24.8
 yuan in 1979 and 1980 and 23.8 yuan in 1981, a quarter less than the 31.9

 yuan in the period of the First Five-Year Plan.  In 1981, key national
 enterprises failed to attain the best historical level in 19 of the 46
 quality indexes of major products.  In 1981, key national enterprises
 failed to attain the best historical level in 54 of the 70 indexes for
 material consumption.  Naturally, there are various causes for these prob-
 lems and there are also incomparable factors in the past and present con-
 ditions.  It can be affirmed, however, that there is a great potential to
 improve the economic results.  Only those enterprises with good results
 have great vitality.  The national economy can have a steady and stable
 speed only on the basis of good results.
 In his opening speech at the,12th party congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping
 said:  "In carrying out our modernization program, we must proceed from the
 realities of China."  How should we understand China's actual situation?
 We have various methods of achieving this aim, statistics being a very
 important one.  If we do not have relatively complete statistics, it is
 impossible to understand the actual situation in a comprehensive way and
 it is also difficult to fulfill the fundamental requirement of building
 socialism with Chinese characteristics.  Therefore, further strengthening
 statistics work is a major issue that has a strong bearing on whether or
 not we are able to proceed from the realities of China and build socialism
 with Chinese characteristics,.  Under the socialist system, it is entirely
 possible'for our statistics to be more realistic and reliable than the
 capitalist ones.  Under the influence of the "leftist" line, there were
 some fabrications in statistics in the past.  However, this is not inherent
 in a socialist society.  On the contrary, it is incompatible with the
 'essence of a socialist system.   Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th
 CPC Central Committee, this phenomenon has been constantly rectified.  At
 present, most of our statistics are authentic and reliable.   In the future,
 following a fundamental turn for the better in party work style and social
 mood, statistics work will be constantly improved and the superiority of
 statistics work under-the socialist system will be further demonstrated.
 Fang Weizhong [2075 4850 0022]:  "Grand Objective, Reliable Measures"
 There is still about 20 years between now and the end of the century.  How
 shall we determine the objective of China's socialist modernization program
 and what steps shall we take in the next 20 years?  This is a major issue
 which the whole party and people of the entire country are very much con-
 cerned with.   It will not do to proceed without a plan.   It will be diffi-
 cult to realize an objective if we fix an excessively high objective.                     How-
 ever, we shall be in a state of inertia if we fix an excessively low
 objective.  Neither can arouse the initiative of the people.  If we rush
 headlong into mass action without definite steps, it will also be diffi
 cult to realize an objective even if it has been fixed in an appropriate
 manner.  An important achievement of the 12th party congress is that it
 has.correctly solved this problem by determining a grand objective and
 providing reliable measures and thus won the enthusiastic support of the'-
 whole party and people of the entire country.

 The 12th party congress called on us, while steadily working for more and
 better economic results, to quadruple the gross annual value of industrial
 and agricultural production by the end of this century.  It is both neces-
 sary and possible to realize this objective and so it is an appropriate
 objective.
 There are quite obvious reasons for the necessity to quadruple the gross
 annual value of industrial and agricultural production.  Only by realizing
 this objective will it be possible for China to be placed in the front
 ranks of the countries of the world in terms of gross national income and
 output of major industrial and agricultural products.  This will represent
 an important advance in the modernization of its entire national economy
 and the urban and rural population will be comparatively well-off both
 materially and culturally.  This objective has reflected the strong aspira-
 tions of the people of the whole country.  If we determine a lower speed,
 it will be impossible to meet the steadily growing needs of the people in
 their livelihood, nor will it be possible to meet the needs for strengthen-
 ing the national economic and national strength.
 It is possible to realize the objective of quadrupling the gross annual
 value of industrial and agricultural production for it is not a high and
 unattainable objective.  Generally speaking, by fulfilling the following
 three demands it will be possible to attain the objective of quadrupling
 the gross annual value of industrial and agricultural production.
 1.  It is necessary to double, in 20 years, the output of industrial energy
 and primary raw materials (an average annual increase of 3.5 percent).
 2.  It is necessary to improve technology and product quality, lower energy
 and raw material consumption and improve the complexity and precision of
 processing so that we can create 100 percent more value or double the
 economic results with the same amount of energy and raw material.
 3.  It is necessary to develop some newly emerging industrial departments
 such as electronics, nuclear energy, data, petrochemical industry and new
 type materials.  They can increase output and improve the economic results.
 In other words, the realization of the objective of quadrupling the gross
 annual value of industrial and agricultural production in the next 20 years
 depends partly on the growth of production capability and partly on the
 progress of technology.  The growth of production capability should also
 depend on the application of new technology.  We should not rely entirely
 on old technology.  The technological level of China's existing industry is
 roughly equal to the level of the economically developed countries during
 the late 1950's and early 1960's.  It is possible for us to attain, by the
 end of this century, the level of the economically developed countries of
 the early 1980's, namely, to attain the level they have attained in the
 past 20 years.  If we do our work well, it is also possible to surpass it:'
 This is not only because we can absorb the existing technology but also
 because the existing technology will also develop in the next 20 years and
 we can make use of it.  We should actively introduce new technology into

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 our country, strive to tackle key problems in new technology and, after we
 succeed in doing so, effectively popularize and apply it.. We can thus
 greatly change the outlook of our production and greatly speed up the
 growth rate.
 Therefore, quadrupling the gross annual value of industrial and agricul-
 tural production is by no means a simple concept of output value but the
 unity between speed and results and the unity between production and con-
 struction on the one hand and scientific and technological achievements
 on the other hand.
 In order to realize the strategic objective of quadrupling the gross annual
 value of industrial and agricultural production in the next two decades, the
 CPC Central Committee has decided to take the following two steps:  In the
 first decade, aim mainly at laying a solid foundation, accumulating
 strength and creating the necessary conditions; and in the second, usher in
 a new period of vigorous economic development.  This is an extremely impor-
 tant policy decision.
 It is' necessary to take two steps because the problems accumulated over a
 long period of time in the past have not been completely solved.  They are
 chiefly manifested in the disproportion of the national economy and the
 irrational industrial and organizational structures.  Reforms of the
 economic system have just started, there has not been a fundamental turn
 for the better in our financial and economic situation and there is still
 a lot of work to be done in the way of readjustment, reorganization and
 reform.' At the same time, we should also get prepared in our material
 conditions such as energy and communications, in tackling key problems in
 science and technology and in training competent persons.  That is to say,
 we are still not provided with the necessary conditions for a big develop-
 ment in the first decade.  If we do not take two steps, people will request
 doing at the present moment a lot of things which we are not provided with
 the necessary conditions to'do now.  They will request the expansion of the
 scale of present construction.  This will aggravate our present financial
 and economic difficulties and the shortage of energy and communications
 facilities.  The result is that we shall not be able to ensure a steady
 development of the economy but will probably bring about new disproportions
 in the national economy and delay the approach of a new.period of vigorous
 economic development.   Conversely, by dividing the attainment of our
 objective in two stages and two steps, we shall be able to concentrate our
 chief efforts in the first decade on readjusting the various aspects of
 economic structures, restructuring, reorganizing and combining the existing
 enterprises and gradually conducting reforms of the economic management
 system.  At the same time, we shall also be able to effect in a planned
 way technological transformation of the existing enterprises, strengthen
 the construction of key projects such as energy and communications and
 step up the scientific and technological study and the cultivation of com-
 petent persons.  We shall thus lay a relatively solid foundation for
 economic growth in the second decade.  Then, a new period of vigorous
 economic development in the 1990's will be a logical event.  By doing so,
 we'shall neither be impatient for success nor mark time but do solid work'.

 We shall follow in proper sequence and make gradual progress.  This is in
 fact a fast but not a slow speed.   In making such arrangements, the CPC
 Central Committee has integrated a high degree of revolutionary spirit with
 a strict scientific approach and has reflected the fundamental principle of
 proceeding from realities in everything.  Therefore, it provides the people
 with both strength and confidence.  Provided that we act unswervingly
 according to the arrangements of the 12th party congress, we shall be able
 to avoid setbacks in our economic development and steadily arrive at our
 destination.
 Tao Dayong [7118 1129 6978]:  "Make Sure To Regard Education and Science
 as Strategic Emphases"
 It was pointed out in the report to the 12th party congress that in the next
 two decades, it is necessary to pay close attention to the strategic
 emphases of agriculture, energy and transport and of education and science.
 This is a correct policy decision made in line with our national conditions,
 strategic objective and various practical proportions.  It is an objective
 requirement of the law of socialist economic development.
 Science and technology are a key to, and education is a basis for, realizing
 the four modernizations.  The development of the other emphases, namely,
 agriculture and energy and transport, is also inseparable from science and
 technology.  Constant inventions in science and technology have brought
 about a profound revolution in production, transforming science into direct
 productive forces.  The fact that the CPC Central Committee has made, on
 this occasion, science and education strategic emphases has reflected the
 attention the party attaches to, and the concern the party shows for,
 intellectuals.   It has also presaged an upsurge in scientific and cultural
 undertakings.  Having worked for a long time in an institute of higher
 learning, I profoundly realize that the exploitation of "intellectual
 resources" in our country still lags far behind the actual needs in
 economic construction.  Since liberation, the institutes of higher learning
 throughout the country have trained a large number of competent personnel
 in various specific fields.  However, in order to attain the strategic
 objective of quadrupling the, gross annual value of industrial and agricul
 tural products, this contingent seems to be too small, or else is not
 commensurate with our task.  Moreover, we have not been able, so far, to
 bring into full play the people's talents.  Since the 3d Plenary Session of
 the 11th CPC Central Committee, we have achieved a great historical trans-
 formation by summing up the historical experience, both positive and nega-
 tive, and bringing order out of chaos.  However, in the fields of science-
 and education, there is still a lot of work to be done and it is necessary
 for us to create a new situation.  After the smashing of the "gang of four,"
 through the solicitude of the party, marked changes have taken place in the
 mental outlook of intellectuals.  They are imbued with the vigor of devot-
 ing themselves to the four modernizations.  Generally speaking, in order to
 bring into better play the initiative of the intellectuals, it is still
 necessary to implement the policy toward the intellectuals.  The "resolu-
 tion" of the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee pointed
 out that it is necessary to "unequivocally affirm that, together with the
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 workers and peasants, the intellectuals are a force to rely on in the cause
 of'socialism."  The numerous intellectuals are filled with exultation at
 this. If, in the future, this content can be incorporated into the new
 tbnstitution, it will further stimulate their creativity and their sense
 of being masters of the country, which will be transformed into a powerful
 material force for the four modernizations drive.
 Looking at the actual situation in the educational, cultural, scientific
 and technological fields, a pressing matter at the moment is to improve the
 living and working conditions of middle-aged intellectuals, and in particu-
 lar to raise their pay.   The middle-aged intellectuals trained after libera-
 tion not only constitute the backbone force on the current educational,
 cultural, scientific and technological fronts, they also shoulder the heavy
 responsibility of inheriting the past and ushering in the future.  Most of
 them have a heavy workload and household chores and their pay tends to be
 low.  Undernourished, quite a few of them become old before their time.   In
 recent years, some have even died prematurely.  This abnormal phenomenon
 should draw the close attention of the departments concerned.  Meanwhile,
 as for the new students enrolled at colleges and universities in recent
 years, their quality (particularly their Chinese language standard) is
 unsatisfactory.  This has something to do with the standard of teaching in
 middle and primary schools.  In order to change this state of affairs, in
 addition to improving teaching materials and methods, opening all avenues
 for study, improving the examination system and strengthening leadership,
 it is all the more necessary to definitely improve the conditions for run-
 ning a school and reorganize the ranks of teachers in order to prevent the
 outflow of competent persons.  "Indigo blue is extracted from the indigo
 plant but is bluer than the plant it comes from."  At present, although the
 pay of primary school teachers has been raised to some extent, their well-
 ,being and political treatment are relatively poor.  Ordinary university
 graduates are not content to become middle school teachers, nor are middle
 school graduates willing to work as primary school teachers.   The teachers
 in schools run by the local people are still required to farm the lot of
 land allocated to them.  It is, therefore, not an easy thing to raise the
 scientific and cultural level of the whole nation. "Fish are extremely
 happy in deep waters and birds know how to return to the deep forests."
 In my opinion, if we want to fundamentally alter this state of affairs, it
 is necessary to greatly and promptly increase "intellectual investment" and
 raise the proportion of educational spending in the annual budget of the
 state.  Only in this way can we "vigorously universalize primary education,
 strengthen secondary vocational education and higher education and develop
 educational projects of all types and at all levels in both urban and rural
 areas, including training classes for cadres, workers, staff members and
 peasants, and literacy classes," genuinely raise education and science to
 the status of strategic areas and train a large number of qualified person-
 nel in specific fields in our efforts to create a new situation in the
 socialist modernization program.  "It takes 10 years to grow trees, but 100
 to rear people."  Only by grasping every second will we be able to adapt
 ourselves to the urgent requirements of the new period.

 Xu Dixin [6079 3321 2450]:  "Strive To Realize the Great Strategic
 Objective"
 The need to achieve the grand strategic objective set forth by the 12th
 party congress is clear to all.  We have the objective conditions to
 realize this aim, that is, the superiority of the socialist system; after
 more than three decades of hard work, our national economy, and particu-
 larly the state economy under the ownership of the whole people, already
 possesses a certain material and technological basis; the strategic
 emphases and measures for the realization of this strategic objective have
 been arranged in a rational and appropriate manner; the realization of
 socialist modernization and the continuous improvement of the people's
 livelihood based on the development of the national economy has become the
 unanimous aspiration of the nation; the political situation characterized
 by unity and stability will continue to play a role beneficial to economic
 construction.
 However, it is certainly not an easy job to quadruple the gross annual
 value of industrial and agricultural production in two decades.  We should
 oppose not only fear of difficulties but also casual and blind optimism.
 A clear and sober understanding of the existing difficulties is beneficial
 and essential to the realization of this strategic objective.
 What. are the difficulties facing us today?  Agricultural labor productivity
 is relatively low and our capacity to resist natural disasters is still
 very small; production technology, management and administration in a large
 number of enterprises are quite backward and due importance has not been
 extensively attached to ecoromic results; the study of applied and basic
 science has not been adapted to the needs of the development of the
 national economy; we have not succeeded in effecting a fundamental turn for
 the better in the financial and economic situation; and population growth
 has not been brought under complete control on a national scale.  Besides
 these, there are also other difficulties.  Only by overcoming these diffi-
 culties will it be possible to forge ahead healthily toward the great
 strategic objective.
 In order to promote an overall upsurge in the socialist economy, Comrade Hu
 Yaobang, in his report, has set forth correct principles on various issues,
 such as amassing funds on key projects and continuously improving the
 people's livelihood, adhering to the dominant position of the state economy
 and developing diversified economic forms, correctly implementing the prin-
 ciple of relying mainly on the planned economy and supplementing it with
 regulation by market mechanism, adhering to self-reliance and expanding
 economic and technological exchange with foreign countries.   Implementa-
 tion of these principles is essential to the realization of our strategic
 objective.
 The integration of the concentration of funds on key projects with the con-
 tinuous improvement of the people's livelihood is a specific manifestation
 of the superiority of the socialist system.  In order to effectively amass

 the whole country into account," the ratio of distribution of central and
 local revenue and the ratio of profit retention by enterprises, it is also
 necessary to attain a fundamental turn for the better in the financial and
 economic situation in the next few years.  This makes it necessary, on the
 basis of improving economic results, to gradually increase state revenue,
 reduce financial deficits and continue to maintain a basic stability of
 price.
 China now has more than 1 billion people.  The total figure of the newly
 increased population is more than 10 million a year.  This is a consid-
 erable pressure.  Excessive growth of population has an adverse effect on
 per capita income.  It also poses serious problems regarding the supply of
 grain and housing, and meeting the need for education and employment.  It
 may even affect social stability.  Therefore, Comrade Hu Yaobang pointed
 out:  "Family planning is a basic policy of our state."
 Correct implementation of the principle of relying mainly on the planned
 economy and supplementing it with regulation by market mechanism consti-
 tutes a fundamental issue in the reform of the economic system.  It plays
 an extremely important role in promoting the all-round development of the
 socialist economy and in realizing our strategic objective.  China's plan-
 ned economy is based on public ownership of the means of production.  With
 respect to production and distribution of the means of production and the
 means of subsistence in the state economy, which have a strong bearing on
 the national economy and the people's livelihood, and particularly the key
 enterprises that have a strong bearing on the economic situation as a whole,
 it is necessary to practice mandatory planning.  Mandatory planning is an
 important manifestation of China's socialist ownership by the whole people
 in organizing and managing production.  We should not merely regard manda-
 tory planning as an administrative means.  Like guidance planning, it is
 not the outcome of unrealistic theories.  It has been created by proceeding
 from realities and by conscientiously applying the law of value in
 accordance with changes in market supplies and demands, and proportional
 relationships between various production departments.  Compared with
 guidance planning, it plays a dominant role in the planned economy.   Some
 comrades have overemphasized the flexibility of guidance planning and under-
 estimated the positive role of mandatory planning.  This matter merits our
 attention.
 With respect to various kinds of small commodities, they are low in value
 and diversified in color and design, and should generally be supplied on
 time and in certain areas.   It is unnecessary and impossible for the state
 to subject them to planning.  The state should let enterprises adapt their
 own production to changes in market supplies and demands.  Some comrades
 are afraid that the existence of regulation by market mechanism and the
 individual economy will adversely affect the planned economy.  In my opin-
 ion, so long as we do a good job of the planned economy and promptly
 strengthen industrial and commercial administration and management through

 policies,. laws and regulations, it is impossible for them to shake the
 planned economy.
 Did we not do a remarkable job in our planned economic construction in the
 period of the First Five-Year Plan despite the existence of the small
 commodity economy and the capitalist economy?  Did we not overfulfill the
 original plan?

 IMBUE THE WORKING CLASS WITH,COMMUNIST IDEAS AGAIN
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 19, 1 Oct 82 pp 35-40
 [Article by Yu Yannan [2456 3601 0589]]
 [Text] The basic premise and foundation for the strengthening of the
 development of the working class' ideology is a deep understanding and
 examination of the present ideological reality of the workers.   In China
 today, the ideology of the working class is in general very good. There is
 a large number of people with an advanced ideology and thinking and this
 large section of the population is emerging from the ranks of the workers
 heroically struggling to work for the socialist modernization program.   They
 are the proof.of the existence of such advanced thinking.  Nevertheless,
 there do still exist several problems which demand prompt resolution.
 A vast amount of investigative material illustrates very clearly that within
 the working class there exists a certain proportion of people with a rela-
 tively low level of ideology and there are even those who do not realize
 that the realization of communism is their highest ideal.  Within one fac-
 tory which launched discussions on.outlooks on life, there were some people
 from one workshop who even said that "man's nature is self-centered."  The
 ensuing discussions even produced a small number of people who agreed with
 this opinion.  That is to say, they did not feel that such an opinion is
 wrong and that such an attitude had long ago been criticized by Marxism as
 an errant bourgeois concept.  Misinterpretation of "self-centeredness" is a
 social phenomenon which only occurs with the appearance of private ownership
 in a society and is characteristic of the exploiting classes and the petty
 bourgeoisie and is in no way inherent in the essential character of human
 beings.  Workers from another factory, in pursuit of so-called "material
 benefits," felt that "money is the only really dependable thing and that
 everything else is empty."  To put money on a higher plane than everything:
 else, to consider it even more important than political honor or credit,
 even more valuable than such things, results in occurrences such as the
 following:  Some workers who contravene labor discipline prefer to write
 self-criticisms than suffer pay deductions.  This in fact means that one
 considers one's own honor and dignity to be something rated in terms of,
 and exchanged for, money.

 Of course, in terms of the work force of the entire country, the above
 phenomena are confined to only a very small percentage of workers and by no
 means represents the general ideology of China's working class.  Neverthe-
 less, the appearance of such attitudes requires our most serious attention
 and vigilance.  For it illustrates the serious extent of the encroachment
 of bourgeois and nonproletarian thinking into the ranks of the working
 class.  Under the influence of such thinking, some workers' ideological,
 political and other qualities have dropped significantly, leaving them with
 a distinct lack of ideology and a lack of political enthusiasm.  One might
 even say that some people have forgotten the great historical mission borne
 on the shoulders of the working classes, and even consciously or uncon-
 sciously use the morals and values of the bourgeoisie to govern their own
 thoughts and actions and evaluate and handle their relationships with other
 people within the socialist conditions of our society.  Furthermore, there
 are those who have been witness to the fact that among those workers who
 have been severely corrupted by bourgeois thinking, there has also been
 moral degeneration leading to the occurrence of economic and various other
 crimes, creating great unrest within the socialist cause.  Such infiltration
 and corruption by bourgeois and other nonproletarian ways of thinking on the
 minds of the workers class is one of the disastrous results of the 10 years
 of internal disorder in China.  The reactionary moves and actions of the Lin
 Biao and.Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques totally destroyed the
 standards between positive and negative, good and evil and beauty and ugli-
 ness as well as ruining the ideology and thinking of the people.  Their
 intense propagation of extreme individualism poisoned the mental outlook of
 some people and the aftereffects and pernicious influences of such poison-
 ing; have yet to be completely eradicated.  Recently, for a multitude of
 reasons,' we have been slack and rather weak in our attitude toward the
 'ideological education of the working masses and ideological and political
 work.  This has also brought about a return to a certain amount of indi-
 vidualism and selfishness, none of which can be ignored.  The historical
 and present influence of bourgeois and other nonproletarian ways of thinking
 both in China and from abroad cannot be wiped out in a short period of time,
 thus the struggle to counteract the corruption of such thinking must be
 carried out over a long:period of time.  Thus an important task is presented
 to party departments of every level, to labor committees and organizations
 of every type as well as to ideological and political workers and theorists,
 namely,, to always make-sure, during this new historical period of building
 socialist modernization, that political and ideological work is constantly
 strengthened, communist education improved and that-workers (in fact all
 people). are once again imbued with communist and socialist ideas.  We should
 adopt all feasible measures to ensure support for the effective realization
 of this work and we should not cease to try and improve the quality of the
 working masses' ideology, politics and morality while helping them to fight
 and overcome the power of the influences of bourgeois and other nonprole-,
 tarian ways of thinking.  Only in this way can we help preserve the true.
 .class qualities of China's working class, help preserve the purity of its
 ideological consciousness and make more and more members of society shake
 off old ways of thinking and the fetters of this old consciousness and
 accept the ideological consciousness of the working class and from this
 point consolidate and develop the government position and guiding role of

 the working class' ideological consciousness within the domain of China's
 socialist consciousness.
 At the 'same time we must recognize that within the sphere of China's
 socioeconomic life, we are carrying out a planned economy with market
 regulation playing an auxiliary role.  However, the level of development
 of China's social production forces requires us to apply ourselves fully
 to the development of socialist commodity production and commodity exchange
 starting from now for a relatively long period of time.  Under such condi-
 tions, the question arises as to how it is possible to develop commodity
 production and commodity exchange while at the same time awakening the
 masses to recognition of the limitations of the principles of free com-
 modity exchange and exchange at equal value, destroying the narrow field of
 vision created by this, and yet also preventing it from overstepping the
 domain of economic activities and encroaching on the domain of social life;
 thus, for example, preventing it from encroaching on the domain of mental
 life or the domain of the relations between ethics and morality or encroach-
 ing on common beliefs, ideals, individual and national character and other
 such sacred domains.  This problem indeed throws up some grim and penetrat-
 ing questions, but before an effective solution can be reached the working
 classes and the people in general must undergo a strengthening of their
 communist education so that the level of their ideals and ideological and
 political consciousness is raised.
 The working class is the most advanced class in China and as such possesses
 characteristics of its advancement which other classes do not have.  The
 reason for this is because it possesses the ideological weaponry of scien-
 tific communism (or scientific socialism, the meaning is the same) as well
 as the fact that it is closely connected to the interrelations of the
 present-day productive forces and production relations and is in fact the
 representative of these new productive forces and production relations.
 But the working class cannot spontaneously generate scientific communist
 thinking.  It must be educated and imbued with such, before it may possess
 such an ideology and before it may come to understand its own historical
 position and historical mission, to be the strongest and most advanced
 social force for the promotion of a beautiful and glorious future.  This
 basic principle of Marxism, even today is still just as applicable as
 before and is not only fitting for the historical period of the struggle
 of the working class to attain political power but is also fitting for
 today's historical period of socialist construction and the eventual
 realization of communism in the future.   In the final analysis the carrying
 out of communist education for the working class and their imbibement of
 communist ideology involves making the working class clearly recognize its
 own basic potential and its actual situation and from this point allow a
 conscious realization of this potential in order to carry out and support
 the unremitting struggle.   In terms of historical materialism, the social
 actions of human beings are always the product of certain demands for
 interest.   The ways in which such demands manifest themselves are numerous,
 such as individual interest, class interest and social interest as well as
 partial interests and all-round interests, short-term interests and long-
 term interests.  The way in.which people perceive these interests are also

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 numerous.  In general people always tend to perceive first of all their own
 personal immediate interests, for such interests can be perceived through
 the senses in daily life, while long-term and all-round interests are not
 perceived or appreciated in the same way, and hence are not seen through the
 senses of everyday life.  In order to appreciate such interests one must do
 some theoretical thinking and one must  formulate scientific abstractions and
 theoretical generalizations from the individual to the general and from the
 concrete subject to the essential nature of a situation.  The ideological
 system of scientific communism makes up the ideological system of the work-
 ing class and clarifies the fundamental principles developed in society as
 well as the conditions for the working class to liberate themselves and the
 entire masses and expresses the most profound and fundamental of the work-
 ing class' and laboring masses' interests.  Of course such an ideological
 system cannot be created by the daily perceptions of the working people,
 but can only be established and developed through the intense study, by
 Marxist theorists and working class political parties, of the ideological
 and cultural results already achieved in the history of mankind, the study
 of the working class' class position and the study of the practical experi-
 ences of the workers' movement as well.as extensive theoretical work and
 theoretical generalizations.  Before the appearance of Marxism and theoreti-
 cal communism the working class had already long existed as an objective
 class of society and indeed had already started its mass struggle to fight
 against capitalist exploitation.   However, this struggle was carried out
 without the working masses' appreciation of the essential interests and good
 of its own class, and its motive force was only immediate short-term direct'
 interests.  Moreover, the contents of the struggle were predominantly
 economic and had not yet unified to overturn the entire capitalist ideo-
 logical system and system of exploitation and for this reason was still
 stuck in a stage of spontaneity.  Only by imbuing the working masses with
 scientific communism and uniting the worker movement can the working class
 gradually come to understand its own essential interests and thereafter
 cause the historical change from being a class-in-itself to a class-for-
 itself and thus the workers movement will have an awareness and be able to
 mold itself into a true communist movement.  Such a fact of history amply
 clarifies the urgent importance and great significance of communist ideologi-
 cal education in the development of the working class and other revolutionary
 causes.,  Today we should continue our support for educating and imbuing the
 working people with communism and communist ideas as well as its signifi-
 cance and aims, which are to ensure that the working masses, under a new
 set of historical conditions, may continue to understand and bear in mind.
 the essential interests of their own class and mankind in general and so
 that they may also be able to broaden their field of vision from individual,
 family or enterprise interests to recognize completely and understand the
 interests of the development of the entire socialist society.  In this way"
 they may accurately combine individual and social interests and thereby
 consciously serve the developed demands of social interests.  At the same
 time they should actively try to influence and win over the broad spectrum
 of the masses in order to jointly develop the socialist cause and to ardu-
 ously struggle and ceaselessly strive to bring our society nearer to our
 glorious aim of communism.

 In order to ensure the effective realization of communist education, one
 must first improve the contents of such an educational program.  It should
 be similar to the cultural education system in China given to the public
 from primary through secondary school to university with unified contents
 and a sequential order combined with composite planning.  Thus the communist
 education provided by the party for the working class and other members of
 society must be based on summarized practical experience to gradually build
 up its own complete system.  From the moment a worker enters a factory to
 the day he or she retires, he or she should, at various times, relate their
 actual thinking to gradually create a systematic education of ideology.  We
 feel that this system of communist education should, in terms of content,
 include the following basic facets:  1) Education in communist ideology.
 The ideal of revolution is a form of advanced social consciousness and a
 scientific belief, and is the spiritual force urging the people to build an
 objective world and society to develop.  We must firmly establish the lofty
 ideals of communism in the working masses, especially in the young workers.
 And not only must we thoroughly educate them in the basic theories of
 Marxism, we must also educate them thoroughly in revolutionary history as
 well as socialism, patriotism and internationalism.  After completing such
 a program of education, they will be able to grasp the basic tenets of
 Marxist principles of social development and come to understand how the con-
 tinuous, advanced dialectical methodology of the communist movement with its
 mutual promotion and mutual integration of international and national con_
 ditions is able to carry on the history and thence glorious tradition
 developed by China's and the international communist movement.   Thereafter
 they. may take those ideals fought for on behalf of the socialist and com-
 munist cause, to become the solid theoretical and practical base for the
 creation of a firm and rock-steady conviction based on their own thinking.
 Thereafter they may closely he up this conviction with their own aspira
 tions and actual work and life and therefore stimulate themselves to turn
 and face the bright future and then march forward courageously to struggle,
 create and construct.  2) Education in communist labor attitude.  In a
 socialist society, because of the restrictions on the level of development
 of the productive forces, labor is still a means of life.  The principle of
 distribution according to work should be applied for the distribution of
 consumer products and we must recognize the principle of laborers being
 concerned about the socialist material benefits of the fruits of their own
 labors on the basis of individual material benefits.  Nevertheless, we
 must teach the workers and other laborers to establish a communist labor
 attitude and encourage them to work without consideration of remuneration
 and to concern themselves with the collective fruits of their labors on the'
 basis-of social benefits, to serve the people heart and soul and to serve-
 the:fulfillment of the material and cultural demands of the entire popula-
 tion.   Naturally it is not possible during the socialist stage, for com-
 munist labor with disregard for remuneration to occupy an authoritative
 position within the entire sphere of social activities, but such communist
 aims should and indeed can be increased and developed.  The spheres of work
 and advanced people who continue to appear from within the work force and
 the laboring masses are the true embodiment of communist labor.  We must
 adeptly put to use their achievements and experiences'in order to educate
 the workers.  Some people still do not understand why, if we are still in

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 the socialist stage of development, we should carry out communist education,
 establish a communist morality and advocate a communist labor attitude.
 Socialism is the first stage of communism, thus without actively developing
 communist aims and ideals there can be no improvement and development in
 the socialist system.  Hence, in terms of distribution, it is necessary to
 support the principle of distribution according to labor while at the same
 time actively promoting a communist labor attitude before the development
 of our society's labor and economic life attains an all-round, solid motive
 force.  3) Education in communist morality.  Lenin said:  "The basis of com-
 munist morality is the struggle to consolidate and complete the communist
 task."  ("Selected Works of Lenin," Vol 4, p 355)  The main task and sub-
 stance of educating the working masses and other members of society in com-
 munist morality is to train them to become loyal to the cause of socialism
 and communism.  Furthermore, in order to achieve a positive attitude toward
 work and life, we must help them develop a consciousness toward work respon-
 sibility and thereby make them come to clearly understand that there is no
 difference between individual and social interests within the new society and.
 that true happiness and social value for each member of society illustrate
 itself in one's struggle to succeed in striving toward the aim of communism.
 Thus, consciously performing one's social tasks, consciously abiding by the
 laws'of society and the basic principles of everyday life, consciously pro-
 tecting and promoting the new interrelations between workers in terms of
 unity, assistance, love and cooperation, and consciously destroying all
 phenomena which go against the interests of society are the lines along
 which the struggle must continue.  The country and the society will come
 to evaluate each individual's moral standards based on his or her working
 and social activities and general behavior and the extent to which these
 factors contribute to the victory of the socialist and communist cause.
 In the process of carrying out the teaching of communist morality, we
 should at the same time introduce legal education.  Moral education creates
 the necessary premises for respect for legal authority and legal education
 can help establish the principles of communist morality within the course of
 everyday life.  4) Education in appreciating the beauty of communism.  This
 is an indispensable part of communist education and in fact turns up in
 every aspect of such education and is an important factor in improving the
 effectiveness of the education in ideals, labor attitude and morality.  The
 most important task in educating workers and members of society to under-
 stand the beauty of communism is to foster and strengthen their ability to'
 appreciate such beauty, to encourage them to love and pursue those things in
 life of'a revolutionary, advanced, healthy and beautiful nature and to
 foster abhorrence, resistance and struggle against all corrupting and awful
 things which oppose socialism.  They should be helped to establish the basic
 distinction between their own view on the appreciation of beauty and that of
 the bourgeoisie and other exploitative classes and to take human, ideal,
 moral and social activities of a communist nature as the basic premise for
 an advanced view of beauty as well as a standard for viewing such beauty.
 From such premises the masses may then use such views of beauty and such
 standards, as well as the generalizations of beauty reflected by such
 standards, to organize their own material and spiritual lives, and thereby
 constantly improve the style and direction of their lives.  Both historical
 and present-day experience illustrates that the nearer a person comes to

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 attaining a communist appreciation of beauty, the more he or she is able to
 penetrate deeper into the beauty of the world and in this way his or her
 thinking and behavior will reach higher standards and greater purity and
 hence the more he or she will consciously be able to contribute to the
 great tasks for attaining the ideals of communism.  Here, then, we have made
 a brief summary of the significance and most important tasks involved in
 carrying out communist education.  The more concrete problems of what the
 specific content of such education should be, what should be learned first;
 how each separate subject should be thoroughly learned, what concrete
 requirements should be aimed at after the learning experience and how such
 education should be tested, all such problems require the strength of every
 level of the party administration and of the workers' organizations and
 committees to work out a comprehensive plan by summarizing practical
 experience and carrying out scientific study so that an outline for the
 educational material may be established.  With this educational outline
 every region, every business and every enterprise can formulate more con-
 crete and specific plans based on their own characteristics.  In general,
 then, this education must gradually be standardized and systematized.
 In order that communist education sees fruition, changes and improvements
 must be made in the shape and methodology of ideological and political
 education within enterprises.   The core of communist education is to seek
 and probe for the truth and spread the truth.  Since truth is scientific it
 follows that the style and methodology of probing for it and spreading it'
 must also be scientific and must conform with the inner nature of truth.
 In' other words this style and methodology must persuade and inspire the
 masses to seek the enormous strength to be found in an awareness of the
 truth.  Marx said:   "Not only should the results of probing conform with
 the truth, but the ways through which such results are achieved must also
 conform with the truth."   ("Complete Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 1, p 8)
 In addition Lenin also said:.  "We cannot endorse the use of a stick to get
 people into heaven."   ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 20, pp 58-59)   These
 quotations clearly point out the necessity for adopting scientific
 methodology in our search for and spreading of the truth.  In the process
 of carrying out communist education of the masses, we must also take a good
 look at the glorious tradition and methodology that our party has inherited
 and accumulated over many years in terms of ideological and political work
 and improve those areas which are no longer suitable for today's world and
 thereby create new methodology and styles of a lively nature which will be
 easier for the masses to accept.  At present, the most important target for
 communist education in enterprise is the young people.   On the basis of
 young people's ability to think independently, their thirst for knowledge.'
 and their wideranging interest and love for things, we must strengthen the
 direction of educational work as well as its liveliness and knowledge con-
 tent.   We must support the adoption of guiding and inspirational teaching
 methods and aim for positive education with a sequential and lively style
 to it. At the same time we must bring together, ideological and political
 education with rich and varied spare-time cultural activities.  Watching
 films,-television and reading literary and scientific books all comprise an
 important part of the workers', in particular young workers', spare-time-
 activities.  We should examine this area very carefully and ensure the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 highest quality of radio, television and films as well as newspapers and
 books read by workers, thereby making them an important channel for the
 dissemination of communist thinking and ideas and acting as increasingly
 rich spiritual nourishment for the workers.
 Some people only partially understand the need to make ideological and
 political work serve the needs of economic work and in so thinking they
 make the contents of ideological education within enterprises extremely
 narrow, restricted only to ensuring work attendance, safe production and
 the completion of production plans.  Such an attitude means that the
 comprehensiveness of communist education is ignored as is the importance
 of improving educational methods and styles.  Such a situation demands
 immediate rectification.  Correct and effective communist education is the
 best means of improving the workers' political and ideological conscious-
 ness, the best means of ensuring a socialist quality and expansional direc-
 tion to an enterprise and the best and most basic means of expanding
 enterprise production and raising productivity.  These few points must
 have our full attention.
 Some people feel that educating workers with communism at present will not
 meet with success.  This is not true.  Many regions and enterprises which
 have already started educating their young workers with communist ideas
 have now established a series of good styles and teaching methods, while at
 the same time amassing successful experiences.  An example might be the
 Yangzhou Cotton Mill in Jiangsu Province mentioned in the piece entitled
 "Correct Appraisal of the New Era of China's Working Class."  The factory
 set up a political school in which, with the help of guiding and correct
 educational methods and successful integration with the realities of the
 workers' actual thinking, they carried out education in the four basic
 principles of the party as well as the historical mission of the working
 class and obtained results which satisfied everyone.  The school ran classes
 for 10 weeks, with attendance from a total of 491 people, with over 90 per-
 cent of those attending taking time off work to study.  There were varying
 degrees of improvement in many aspects such as ideological and political
 consciousness, labor attitude, labor discipline, moral standing and work
 responsibility.  Families of those attending the school sent silk banners
 congratulating the school on its successful teaching methods.  The success
 .and outstanding achievements obtained by. this political school cannot be
 separated from the unceasing energy and work of those ideological and
 political workers active in the factory who managed to organize the school.
 At'the same time as improving the training of ideological and political
 workers we must also select a series of workers who show keen interest in
 their political and ideological work,'display revolutionary spirit, possess
 cultural and scientific knowledge and high standards of Marxist-Leninist
 theory and who have close contact with the working masses and take these
 people and train them thoroughly to undertake similar'tasks elsewhere so
 that we may build up a great team of ideological and political as well as
 communist education workers.  We must realize that when the working class
 has undergone a long period of training in communist activities they will
 ,possess the tradition of learning communist theory.   The brightest and most
 intelligent of our ideological and political workers must constantly amass

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 and summarize their experiences so that they may construct new methods and
 styles of educating the working masses in ideology.  An upsurge in com-
 munist education centered on the scientific theories of Marxism-Leninism-
 Mao Zed-ong Thought will,. in line with the incessantly developing direction
 of China's political and economic situation, without doubt flourish in
 China.
 At the same time as educating the working class in communist ideas, we
 must ensure that the working class also receives cultural and scientific
 education.  Such education not only raises the workers' production capacity
 and the vital need for them to grasp the complexities of modern equipment,
 it also helps them grasp the theory of communism.  Both Lenin and Mao Zedong
 pointed out the importance of this problem many times.  Just as one cannot
 come to understand the complexities of modern machinery without scientific
 and cultural knowledge, so tqo, without a certain level of culture, one
 cannot come to understand relatively complicated ideological, political and
 theoretical problems.  Our work in ideological and political education can
 only reach a relatively low level, thus we must raise the level of cultural,
 scientific and technological education above that of ideological and polit-
 ical education.   During this period of economic readjustment and enterprise
 consolidation it is vital and feasible to carry out training and education
 for all workers which will include both ideological and political as well as
 cultural and scientific content.
 The'Communist Party of China may be seen as the vanguard of the working
 class and as the political party of communism and its amassed work and
 activities embody the realities of China's communist movement and the
 ideology of communism.  In terms of national and social life, the Communist
 Party of China plays a guiding role for ideology and politics.  Education
 in communist ideology for the masses, in particular the working masses, is
 therefore, an important and frequently recurring task of party members at'all
 levels including enterprise party members.  An important aspect of this task
 is the strengthening and improvement of ideological and political educa-
 tional work by party leaders involved in strengthening and improving the
 party itself.   Furthermore,; the very center of socialist spiritual and
 cultural construction may be seen as the carrying out of communist ideologi-
 cal education for the masses, in particular the working masses.  Only if we
 recognize the position and role of communist education within party activ-
 ities and within spiritual civilization construction in general, can we
 definitely carry out and complete this work and make our working classes
 and other adult members of society into a new breed of person more and more
 imbued with the ideals, morality, culture and discipline to devote them-
 selves to the communist cause.

 HOW TO STUDY THE SECOND PART OF THE REPORT TO THE 12TH CPC NATIONAL CONGRESS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 19, 1 Oct 82 pp 41-45
 [Article by RED FLAG Editorial Office for Theoretical Education; passages
 within slantlines published in boldface]
 [Text] On the basis of summing up the experience and lessons of China's
 economic construction and analyzing China's national situation, this sec-
 tion deals with the economic program for socialist modernization, and dis-
 cusses the following main issues:  one strategic goal, two strategic
 periods, three strategic focal points and four main principles concerning
 the task of China's economic construction between 1981 and the end of the
 century.  These four issues have their own points of emphasis, but are
 interrelated and together form a complete and clear blueprint for socialist
 economic construction.
 Through our study, we can divide the above four issues into four main
 points, come to a deep understanding of their meaning and put forward the
 objective bases for their proposal, clarify the relations between them and
 master the basic contents of this construction program as a whole.
 /In studying the strategic goal, we must have a clear understanding of the
 following:  1) the concrete meaning of the strategic aim of China's economic
 construction from the year 1981 to the end of this century; 2) the great
 significance of realizing this strategic aim; 3) the real possibility and
 objective basis of realizing this strategic aim./
 The report points out:  "In the 20 years from the year 1981 to the end of
 this century, the general aim of our country's economic construction is to
 strive to quadruple the total annual industrial and agricultural output
 value of the whole country by constantly raising economic results; that is,
 to increase the output from 710 billion yuan in the year 1980 to 2.8 trillion
 yuan in the year 2000."  The quadrupling referred to here means that the
 total yearly industrial and agricultural output value of our country by the
 end of this century will be four times as much as that in the year 1980
 (calculated according to the fixed prices in 1980).  In other words, this
 will be the achievement of two twofold increases.  These various ways of
 expression mean one and the same thing.  In addition, the quadrupling refers
 to the industrial and agricultural total output value.  With regard to the
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100380001-6
 output or output value of each product, the increase will not necessarily
 be 400 percent.  It may be higher or lower than that.  What merits particu-
 lar attention is that the fourfold increase must be realized "by constantly
 raisitig economic results."  In other words, the increase of output value
 must?tiot be inflated or exaggerated.  It must be real and be obtained
 through constantly tapping potential, reducing consumption, raising quality
 and broadening and deepening production.
 To quadruple the total yearly industrial and agricultural output value in
 20 years is an impressive aim.  It presages a glorious future for our coun-
 try's socialist construction and for our people.  If we manage to achieve
 this strategic aim, our total national income and the output of our main
 industrial and agricultural products will occupy a leading position in the
 world, the income of the people in the cities and the countryside will
 double and their material and cultural life will reach a comfortable
 standard.  We must not belittle "the quadrupling of the total yearly indus-
 trial and agricultural output value."  Whether we look at it from the angle
 of our country's present economic status, or compare it with the speed of
 economic growth of other countries, we can be proud of this aim.  According
 to general statistics of Western countries, China's gross national product
 in 1980 was about 1/9 of that of the United States, a little less than 1/4
 of that of the Soviet Union, 1/4 of that of Japan and a little more than 1/3
 of that of West Germany.  Increasing it by four times means that our coun-
 try's gross national product will be close to that of Japan in 1980, which
 then ranked third in the world, and will far exceed that of West Germany,
 which ranked fourth in the world.  Of course, because China has a large
 population, the level of per capita national income will still be low.
 Moreover, by the end of this century, other countries will also have
 progressed.  However, because the average growth rate of China's industry
 and agriculture is higher than that of economically developed countries, the
 gap between China and these countries will certainly be narrowed.  We must
 not belittle the "comfortable standard of living."  The "comfortable standard
 of living" means a common medium level of material and cultural prosperity.
 Having achieved this, although our living standard will not be high in com-
 parison with that of economically developed countries, we must understand
 the following:  First, the "comfort" we are referring to will be comfort
 enjoyed by the entire population.  It will not be like that of capitalist
 countries, where the greater part of the high national income goes into the
 pockets of a few capitalists.  Second, the "comfort" we are referring to is
 real comfort, bringing substantial benefits to the people.  It is different
 from that of capitalist countries, where because of heavy taxes, inflation
 and rising unemployment, a significant amount of the laborers' income is
 stripped from them.  Third, the "comfort" we are referring to is comfort
 that will enable the whole people to live happily.   It is different from
 that'of capitalist countries, where the working people are often worried by
 unemployment, robberies and murders, and cannot live in peace.   In our
 study, we must be good at combining theory with practice, make scientific
 comparisons and come to a deep understanding of the great significance of
 achieving the strategic aim.

 The strategic aim determined by the party Central Committee is formidable
 but also realistic, and can be achieved through hard work.  Some comrades
 are not confident enough of this because they have not yet got rid of the
 negative influence of past economic .setbacks, and because they have not
 fully.tinderstood the favorable conditions for realizing the strategic aini.
 We should realize that since the third plenary session of the party, by
 bringing order out of chaos, we have corrected the past "left" erroneous
 tendency, correctly summed up experience and lessons and found a new road
 of the Chinese type for building socialism.  In addition, after more than
 30 years of construction, our country has built up certain material and
 technological foundations.  We have a relatively complete industrial
 system with relatively complete branches, and distribution is becoming
 rationalized.  The foundations of industrial, transportation and nonmaterial
 production departments are far better than before.  Take industry for exam-
 ple.  Its potential is great.  At present, China's energy utilization ratio
 is about 30 percent on average, while that of advanced industrial countries
 is as high as 50 percent.  The output value produced by each 10,000 tons of
 energy in our country is about 63 percent lower than that of the United
 States. and 72 percent lower than that of Japan.  The history of economic
 development in the past 30 years or so also shows that it is possible to
 achieve a fourfold increase.  For instance, a fourfold increase in 20 years
 means an average yearly increase of 7.2 percent.  What was the growth rate
 of our country's production in the past?   Calculated according to fixed
 prices, the total industrial and agricultural output value in 1981 had
 increased by 850 percent over 1952.  In other words, the industrial and
 agricultural total output value was over 9 times as much.  The average
 yearly rate of increase of our country's total industrial and agricultural
 output value between 1953 and 1981 was 8.1 percent.  In the 20 years from
 1961 'to 1980, China's economic construction was affected by the erroneous
 "left" tendency.  It was especially undermined by the 10 years of internal
 disorder..  Yet the average yearly increase rate of the total industrial and
 agricultural output value still reached 6.1 percent, although economic
 results at that time were not high.  At present, China has unprecedentedly
 favorable conditions for its economic construction.  It is perfectly possi-
 ble to make the average yearly increase rate of the total industrial and
 agricultural output value exceed 6.1 percent and reach more than 7 percent
 in the coming 20 years.  We must have full confidence in this.
 /The second focal point is a key problem of strategy for China's economic,
 construction in the coming 20 years.  Why must we grasp strategic key points
 in realizing our strategic aim?  What is the relationship between non-
 strategic points and strategic key points?  We must come to a good under-
 standing of these questions in our study./
 The various departments involved in economic and social development form an
 organic whole.   Because the positions and status of the various departments
 are. different, in the process of economic development, some of them will
 become key departments and some will not, and they must be tackled in order
 of priority and urgency.  According to specific conditions and within a
 certain period of time, we must lay stress on the principal and weak

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100380001-6
 departments that restrict economic development, and concentrate our efforts
 mainly on strengthening them.  This is a practical, realistic and far-
 sighted strategy.  Although China's agriculture, energy, communications,
 education and science have developed to a certain degree, they have for a
 long time lagged behind the development of the national economy as a whole,
 and have been weak links that restrict economic development.  If we do not
 solve this problem, we will have great difficulty in realizing our strategic
 aim.  Therefore, it is of far-reaching significance that the party Central.
 Committee has decided that the above departments will be our strategic
 focal points in the coming 20 years.
 Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy.  The status of this
 foundation has a decisive bearing on the development of the national economy
 as a whole.  Since the third plenary session of the party and the popu-
 larization of the production responsibility system, we have developed a
 diversified economy by paying close attention to grain production, and
 China's agricultural production has developed remarkably quickly.  But we
 have not fundamentally changed the low level of our agriculture, labor
 productivity and commodity rate.  Our conditions for agricultural produc-
 tion are bad, and our ability to take precautions against natural calamities
 is low.  The grain provided by each agricultural laborer is sufficient to
 support only about three people, far lower than the level of economically
 developed countries.  The marketable surplus of grain amounts to only 15,
 percent.  Products from forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production and
 fishery have been in short supply for a long time.   In particular, China
 has a large agricultural population and little cultivated land.   The average
 area of cultivated land per person is only about 1/3 of the 4.9 mu world
 average.  The contradiction between a large agricultural population and
 little cultivated land is becoming more and more marked.  All this shows
 that China's agriculture, the foundation of the national economy, is still
 weak.  Only by firmly stressing agriculture as a strategic focal point, can
 we lay a more solid foundation for the development of the national economy.
 Energy and communications are two important branches of material production
 in the national economy.   Energy provides fuel and power for the national
 economy, and communications are the veins of the national economy.  Since
 liberation, China's energy production has developed greatly.   But because
 the processing industry has developed even faster and the utilization of
 energy has been low, energy production has for a long time been a weak link
 restricting our economic development.  According to preliminary calcula-
 tions, due to the shortage of electricity and coal, 20-30 percent of equip-
 ment throughout the country cannot operate at full capacity.                       The further
 exploitation of energy resources has become an urgent task.   This needs a'
 lot of investment, and a long construction period.  But as to economizing
 on, energy, it is quite a different matter.   So long as we adopt effective
 measures, we can achieve quick and remarkable results.  If we raised the
 utilization ratio of our country's energy to that of present-day Japan, we
 would quadruple our energy output.    Therefore, we must concentrate on the
 planned'exploitation of energy resources and the economical use of energy,
 to guarantee the fulfillment of the needs of the development of the
 national economy.   Communications and transport are another weak link in
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100380001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100380001-6
 the national economy.  In the past 30-odd years, the volume of our coun-
 try's railway cargo has increased 30 times, but the railway mileage open to
 traffic has increased by 130 percent only.  There are more and more weak
 areas and sections, and the transport capacity of "bottleneck" areas and
 sections can carry only 50-70 percent of the railway transport volume.  Oh'-
 the one'hand, coal that has been produced cannot be transported by train.
 On the other hand, due to the shortage of coal, work on the industrial
 front cannot be carried out fully.  The capacity of highway and waterway
 transportation is comparatively weak, the handling capacity of our ports is
 inadequate and the waiting time for unloading is too long.  Because the
 "veins" of communications and transportation are insufficient, industrial
 and agricultural production and the livelihood of the people are seriously
 affected.  Only when we make great efforts to grasp these weak links as
 focal points, can we really guarantee the realization of the strategic aim.
 The modernization of science and technology is the key link of the four
 modernizations.  Science and technology determine more and more directly
 not only the speed of our country's economic development, but also the
 level of economic results throughout the country.  At present, the consump-
 tion level in our country's production is high, its economic results are
 poor and its equipment and products lag behind advanced world standards.
 The fundamental reasons are that the level of science and technology is low
 and management is backward.  The fact that economic structure, the organi-
 zational structure of enterprises and the structure of products are
 irrational reflects to a large extent the low level of China's science and
 technology and of its management.  On the whole, the technological level
 of our country's industrial production is only equal to that of developed
 industrialized countries in the late fifties and early sixties.   It is 20
 years behind the advanced scientific and technological level of the world
 today.  There are not many engineering technicians in our country.  The
 average educational level of the masses of workers and peasants is low.
 There are not many skilled workers nor skilled specialized management
 personnel.  All this slows down the development of our country's economy.
 According to statistics, in developed industrialized countries, 60-80 per-
 cent of the development of industrial production is achieved through tech-
 nological innovations.  Science and technology must be applied and developed
 by those people who are relatively well educated.  Obviously, it is diffi-
 cult for China's economy to rank in the forefront of the world if we do'not
 raise our cultural and educational levels and our scientific and techno-
 logical, standards.
 Laying proper emphasis on the strategic focal points not only accords with
 the objective requirements of the overall balance of the national economy,
 but also with the trend of the future development of the national economy.
 Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to concentrate appropriate funds and
 energies on the above fields.  But it does not mean that we can place other
 branches of the national economy in an insignificant position.   Developing
 strategic focal points requires the joint efforts of various trades and
 enterprises, and breakthroughs in strategic focal areas will in turn bring
 forward and promote the development of other branches.  In our study, we
 must combine theory with practice and correctly understand the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 interrelationship and compatibility of the dialectical relations between
 strategic and nonstrategic focal points.  It is wrong to overlook the
 importance of laying proper emphasis on strategic focal points and to fail
 to tnake,positive contributions to doing this.  On the other hand, it is
 also wrong to pay attention only to strategic focal points and neglect the
 development of nonstrategic areas.
 We must also take into consideration the fact that China's population is
 great and its growth rate is too high.   This is an important factor which
 has not only increased the burden of state finance, but also affected
 economic development and the improvement of the people's livelihood.  Under
 the socialist system, since we can overcome the anarchy of material produc-
 tion, we should and can overcome the anarchy of population growth.  In the
 coming 20 years, it is also one of our strategic tasks to effectively con-
 trol the population growth and to raise the quality of the population.
 /The third focal point proposes to realize our strategic aim in two stages.
 When studying this problem, we must gain a clear idea of the following:
 1) Why must we realize our strategic aim in two stages?  2) What are our
 main tasks in the first 10 years and in the coming 5 years?/
 Realizing our strategic aim in two stages is a correct strategic measure
 suited to China's economic conditions and trend of development.  This is a
 plan for a gradual, orderly increase in the rate of economic development,
 and a practical program which strives to suit the subjective to the objec-
 tive and to bring our initiative into play.  In the next two 10-year periods,
 the first 10 years will be devoted to laying a good foundation, accumulating
 strength and creating conditions; consequently it will be impossible to
 achieve a high rate of development.  In the second 10 years, we will
 accelerate our rate of development and enter a new period of vigorous
 economic development.
 Various conditions will restrict our rate of development in the first 10
 years.  Since the third plenary session of the party, by implementing the
 principle of readjustment, restructuring, reorganization and upgrading, we
 have 'carried out the policy of enlivening our domestic economy and of open-
 ing our door to foreign investors.  The national economy has therefore
 developed steadily.  However, the many problems left over by history cannot
 be solved all at once.   For instance, we still need a fairly long time to
 readjust and restructure our disproportionate national economy, and our
 irrational industrial structure and economic system.   It is impossible to
 change the backward state of energy and communications in a short time.
 Due to the lack of technological strength and funds, we can only tackle key
 scientific and technological problems and carry out technical innovations
 in existing enterprises, and for the time being this cannot be done on a big'
 scale.  The training of qualified personnel and the improvement of techno-
 logical and management standards require a whole process.   In the first 10
 years, if we can concentrate our efforts on solving the above problems, we
 will be able to reduce waste, improve economic results and promote produc-
 tive forces.        We can also accumulate strength and lay'good foundations for
 our future development and thus guarantee that there will be a relatively
 rapid increase in the second 10 years.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100380001-6
 In realizing our great strategic aim, the first 10 years, and particularly
 the first 5 years, are a crucially important period.  The tasks of the
 first 10 years, that is, the tasks of the Sixth and Seventh Five-Year Plan
 periods, have been clearly explained in the report.  In our study, we can
 also refer to the third part of Comrade Zhao Ziyang's report to the fourth
 meeting of the fifth people's congress.  The report to the 12th CPC National
 Congress proposes the realization of a fundamental change for the better in
 our finance and economy within the coming 5 years.  We must "markedly
 improve economic results and steadily maintain a balance in finance and
 credit, and price stability."  The fundamental change for the better in
 finance and economy seems mainly to involve questions of finance and price,
 but it is in fact an overall reflection of the entire work of economic
 construction and of the development of production.  Only when we shift the
 whole of economic work onto the correct path which centers on improving
 economic results, combine increasing production with practicing economy and
 do all our work practically and realistically, can we achieve our strategic
 aim.  The whole is composed of parts.  Each unit is a piece on the national
 chessboard.  So long as each unit can bring its enthusiasm and initiative
 into play according to the requirements of overall balance, and make con-
 tributions to the realization of the above aim, the whole strategic task
 can be accomplished even more satisfactorily.
 /The fourth focal point deals with four important principles which must be
 adhered'to in realizing our strategic aim.  These four principles are
 actually four dialectical relations in our socialist economic life.  They
 reflect the most important requirements of socialist economic law and play,
 a universal and long-term guiding role in socialist construction.  When
 studying this focal point, we must deepen our understanding of the four
 dialectical relations by combining theory. with practice.   In addition, we,
 must act in the light of specific conditions, and prevent and overcome any
 one-sidedness which might emerge in the course of implementing these prin-
 ciples./
 The correct handling of the relationship between carrying out socialist
 construction and constantly improving the people's livelihood is a require-
 ment of socialist economic law, and primarily of basic socialist economic
 law.  In the final analysis, the purpose of socialist construction is to
 improve the people's livelihood.   But to do this, we must accumulate funds
 and expand production.  Here we are required to handle well the relations
 between accumulation and consumption and to pay attention to both immediate
 and long-term interests and the interests of the,state, the collective and
 the individual.   Comrade Chen Yun put it this way:   "First, we want to eat.
 Second, we want to carry out construction."  In the past few years, we have
 readjusted the proportion between accumulation and consumption, and the
 people's livelihood has improved remarkably.  But there has been a drop in
 state 'revenue, and state funds are excessively decentralized.   In the light
 of this situation, the report proposes that we concentrate our funds on key
 construction projects so as'to change the tendency of excessive decentrali-
 zation of funds.  While continuing to implement the present financial system
 and protect the autonomy of enterprises, we must appropriately readjust the
 proportion of distribution between central and local revenue and encourage

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100380001-6
 localities, departments and enterprises to use their funds for construction
 projects urgently needed by the state.  We can only improve the livelihood
 of the people in the cities e.nd countryside by developing production, not
 by.reducing the state's indispensable construction funds.  In this respect,
 we must further unify our thinking, raise our understanding and resolutely
 carry out the above principles through studying the report.
 Correct handling of the relationship between maintaining the dominance of
 the state-run economy on the one hand and developing various economic forms
 on the other is essential, because of the law that production relations must
 be suited to the character of productive forces.  It also has important
 bearings on bringing into full play the superiority of the socialist system.
 The state-run economy controls the state's economic lifelines.  It is the
 principal part of the socialist economy.  Maintaining the dominance of the
 state-run economy is the basic. prerequisite for guaranteeing socialist
 modernization, as well as a decisive factor in guaranteeing that the collec-
 tive ownership system of the laboring masses will advance along the social-
 ist road, and that the individual economy will serve socialism.  On the
 other hand, due to the imbalance in productive forces, we must rationally
 dispose of and develop various economic forms in coordination so as to
 compensate for such imbalance.  Only in this'way can we bring all positive
 factors into full play, make the urban and rural economy flourish and
 satisfy the demands of the people.  The correct handling of the relationship
 between maintaining the dominance of the state-run economy and developing
 various economic forms was a task put forward after the basic completion of
 the socialist transformation of the means of production.  But since then it
 has remained unsolved.   It was only after the third plenary session of the
 party that the relationship between the two was handled correctly.  In out
 study, we must combine theory with historical experience and deepen our
 theoretical understanding of the relationship between the two.   In other
 words, on the one hand, we must unswervingly maintain the leading position
 of the state-run economy so that we can further perfect its management.  On
 the other hand, we must energetically support the development of various
 economic forms so that they can play the role of enlivening-the economy
 under the guidance of the state plans.
 Relying primarily on a planned economy and secondarily on regulation by
 market mechanism reflects not only the objective requirements of the law
 governing the planned and proportionate development of the national
 economy, but also the requirements of the law of value which still plays a
 role under the socialist system.  A planned economy is the essence of the
 socialist economy.  Only by relying mainly on a planned economy can we
 guarantee the centralization and unification of the country's economic
 construction and the coordination and balance of the basic proportions of
 the national economy.  On the.other hand, only by bringing into play the
 subsidiary role of regulation by market mechanism, can we supplement what
 is inadequate in the state plans and enliven the economy.   In the sphere of
 planning and management, this is manifested as follows:   Compulsory plans
 must be effected concerning the production and allocation of those means of
 production and consumption which influence the national economy and the
 people's livelihood, especially in those key enterprises which affect the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 economic situation as a whole.  With regard to the purchase of grain and
 other important agricultural and sideline products, compulsory quotas must
 be worked out.  Furthermore, instructive plans must be implemented with
 regard to many products and enterprises, and economic levers must be used
 to guarantee their realization.  It is permissible to produce and circulate
 various small commodities according to market demands and within the limits
 of state decrees, regulations and policies.  Correctly handling the rela-
 tionship between relying mainly on a planned economy and secondarily on
 regulation by market mechanism has been a problem frequently encountered
 over the past years; it will continue to .be an important problem which we
 must continue to try and solve  in the future.  The phenomenon of laying
 stress on state plans to the neglect of regulation by market mechanism can
 still be found; and on the other hand, there is still a tendency to over-
 emphasize regulation by market mechanism to the neglect of the planned
 economy.  To overcome such one-sidedness, we must raise our theoretical
 understanding of the principles concerned.
 The.. issue of correctly handling the relations between adhering to the prin-
 ciple of self-reliance on the one hand and expanding economic and techno-
 logical exchanges with foreign countries on the other is actually the issue
 of correctly handling the relations between China and foreign countries in
 the course of socialist economic construction.  The principle of maintain-
 ing independence and self-reliance was, is and will always be our stand-
 point.  'In addition, we must also unswervingly carry out an open-door
 foreign policy, and energetically expand our economic and technological
 exchanges with foreign countries on the basis of mutual benefit.  The pur-
 pose of this is ultimately, to strengthen our ability to stand on our own
 feet. Referring to the relations between China and foreign countries in his
 "On the Great Ten Relationships," Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out:   "Our
 principle is that we must learn from the strong points of all peoples and
 countries, and from all the good things in politics, economy, science,
 technology, literature and arts.  But we must learn with analytical and
 critical eyes.  We must not learn blindly, and we must not copy others'
 experience indiscriminately or mechanically."  He also pointed out:  "We
 must resolutely guard against and criticize all the decadent systems and
 ideas of the, foreign bourgeoisie.  But this does not prevent us from study-
 ing the advanced science and technology of capitalist countries and the
 scientific aspects of the management of enterprises."  We must guard against
 taking self-reliance to mean isolationism, and being afraid of expanding
 our economic and technological exchanges with foreign countries.   On the
 other hand, in our economic activities with foreign countries, we must
 prevent the erroneous tendency of forsaking principles, departing from the
 correct stand, having blind faith in things foreign and submitting to the
 corrosive influence of bourgeois ideology.

 HOW TO STUDY THE THIRD PART OF THE 12TH CPC CONGRESS REPORT
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 19, 1 Oct 82 pp 45-48
 [Article by RED FLAG Editorial Office for Theoretical Education; passages
 within slantlines published in boldface]
 [Text]  This part of the report scientifically expounds the importance of
 building socialist spiritual civilization in the new historical period from
 the higher theoretical plane of scientific socialism and the higher polit-
 ical vantage point of the future of China's social development and clearly
 .and definitely formulates the principles, tasks and measures of the building
 of socialist spiritual civilization.  The contents comprise the following
 four main points:
 1.  The dialectical relationship between spiritual civilization and mate-
 rial civilization.
 2.  Socialist spiritual civilization constitutes an important characteristic
 of'the socialist system and a major aspect of its superiority.
 3.  Socialist spiritual civilization must take communist ideology as its
 core.
 4.  The aim, requirements and tasks of building socialist spiritual civili-
 zation.
 /While studying the first main point, it is advisable to deepen our under-
 standing in the following aspects:   1) What is material civilization?  What
 is spiritual civilization?  2) We must have an understanding of the great
 significance of socialist spiritual civilization by viewing the interrela
 tionship of spiritual civilization and material civilization.   3) We must
 pay attention to overcoming-the ideological trend to overlook the building
 of spiritual civilization in light of actual conditions./
 Civilization refers to the progress and the civilized state of human society.
 While talking about Morgan's division of stages in ancient societies, Engels
 pointed out:   "The civilized epoch is a period in which human beings have
 learned to further process tatural products and in which real industry and
 art have taken shape."   ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 4, p 23)

 Here Engels has already clearly brought to light the contents of the two
 aspects of civilization, namely, the progress of material production and
 spiritual production of human society.  Human history is a history in which.
 people continuously transform the objective and subjective worlds.  In the
 practical activities to transform the objective external world, people
 create more and more social material wealth to meet the needs of the mate-
 rial life of human beings.  This transformation of nature results in
 material civilization as manifested in improved conditions for material
 production and in a better material life for the people.  Along with this,
 the production of spiritual values and the spiritual life of mankind also
 develops and the ability of human beings to understand the objective
 external world steadily increases.  The achievements in this respect are
 what we call spiritual civilization, as manifested in a higher educational,
 scientific and cultural level and in higher ideological, political and
 moral standards.
 Spiritual civilization and material civilization constitute the two aspects
 of human civilization.  Their relationship is just like the two wings of a
 single bird.  They are interdependent and not a single one of the two can be
 dispensed with.  Furthermore, fundamentally speaking, material civilization
 provides a foundation for spiritual civilization.   There may be a higher
 level of spiritual civilization in a situation in which the conditions for
 material production are relatively on the low side, but without a prosperous
 and developed economy, such undertakings as education, science and culture
 will surely be restricted and a backward economy will also interfere with
 social morality and practices.  Therefore, we must do a good job in economic
 construction so as to ensure the continuous progress of social material pro-
 duction and the continuous enhancement of the level of material life of the
 people, thus further creating conditions for enriching and developing the
 production of spiritual values and spiritual life.  On the other hand,
 spiritual civilization gives a tremendous impetus to the development of
 material civilization.  Education, science and others are a latent produc-
 tive force which gives people knowledge, methods and skills.  Once this
 knowledge, methods and skills are grasped by the working people, they will
 become a practical productive force.  The ideological education in spiritual
 civilization not only plays a motivating role in the building of material
 civilization but also ensures its correct orientation.   In any society, the
 class which occupies a dominant position tries to make its own ideological
 system dominant in the society to accelerate the development of material
 production and material life in line with the interests and requirements of
 its own class.  In a socialist society, it is the proletarian ideology that
 occupies a dominant position.   The proletarian ideology represents the
 fundamental interests of the working people and corresponds with the orien-
 tation of the development of human society, so any ideological system in'
 history cannot compare with the proletarian ideology in the motivating role
 the latter plays in the development of material production and material life.
 It is precisely because of this that we must do our utmost to build socialist
 spiritual civilization and arm the masses of people with proletarian com=
 munist ideology so that they can give play to their enthusiasm and creativity
 for building a modern and powerful socialist country and forcefully push
 socialist material civilization forward.

 Some people hold that it is not until material civilization is highly
 developed that we can begin to talk about the building of spiritual civili-
 zation or deem that spiritual civilization will spontaneously arise when
 material civilization is highly developed.  This argument reflects the
 inadequate understanding of the significance of the building of socialist
 spiritual civilization and the lack of a thorough comprehension of the
 dialectical relationship of the two civilizations.  As we have mentioned
 above, material civilization provides an indispensable foundation for
 spiritual civilization and any view that overlooks the building of spiritual
 civilization is wrong.  However, this does not mean that spiritual civiliza-
 tion is a simple and mechanical derivative of material civilization, nor
 does it mean that spiritual civilization and material civilization develop
 simultaneously and spontaneously.  It must be seen that under given condi-
 tions, the level of development of spiritual civilization, and in particular,
 its ideological contents, and that of material civilization are not even.
 The development of spiritual civilization can possibly be higher or lower
 than that of material civilization.` The development of ideological educa-
 tion can possibly be higher or lower than that of the cultural aspect of
 civilization.  In the capitalist society, material civilization is highly
 developed and such aspects as scientific and technological undertakings as
 well as cultural and educational undertakings are fairly developed.  How-
 ever, 'on the other hand, of such aspects as ideology and politics as well
 as ethics and morality, many are decadent and degenerate; the people lead a
 life devoid of spiritual meaning; and the relationship between man and man
 is an out-and-out relationship based on money, and so on.  All this is
 determined by its capitalist system.  Ours is a socialist society.   Although
 our socialist society is still in its primitive stage of development at
 present and is not yet highly developed, the political and ideological
 consciousness and the ethics and morality of the people are far ahead of
 those people in the capitalist countries with a highly developed material
 civilization.  The main reason for this state of affairs lies in the fact
 that our country is under the socialist system.  Therefore, it is one-sided
 and unscientific to talk in indiscriminate and general terms about "when
 the granary is bursting, people will observe etiquette and when clothing and
 food are ample, people will pay attention to honor or disgrace."  This will
 easily make people think that it seems a spiritual civilization will spon-
 taneously grow with the development of material civilization and will even
 make people concentrate on the enjoyment of material life and neglect the
 enhancement of the level of their mental outlook.  In fact, material wealth
 can benefit the people and can also lead the people to degeneration.   If we
 do not enthusiastically build socialist spiritual civilization, the people's
 ideological consciousness will not necessarily grow with the developed social
 D       production and the improved material life.
 /While studying the second main point, we must fully understand that social-
 ist spiritual civilization constitutes an important characteristic of the
 socialist system and a major aspect of its superiority through studying the
 .Marxist basic principle and summing up the practical experience in socialist
 construction./

 We all know that in talking about a society, Marx would first state the
 economic structure of the society and at the same time, would relate the
 political and legal superstructure founded on this economic basis and also
 the social ideology which corresponds to this economy and politics.  This
 exposition of Marx is also applicable in a socialist society.  In other
 words, in analyzing the characteristics of a socialist society, it is not
 comprehensive to lay one-sided stress on the economic basis and politics
 without paying attention to the situation of social ideology, culture,
 education, ideology and morality.  In regard to the characteristics of
 socialism, apart from the public ownership of the means of production,
 distribution according to work, planned economy and political power of the
 working class and other working people, as we termed them in the past,
 there must bt one more important characteristic, that is, socialist
 spiritual civilization.  If we fall into a one-sided understanding of
 socialism and neglect the building of socialist spiritual civilization, we
 will lose our ability to resist the inroads of various ways of life and
 ideology which are corrupt, the building of material civilization will
 possibly deviate from the socialist course and socialism will be in danger
 of developing in a degenerate fashion.
 At the same time, apart from finding expression in such aspects as the
 elimination of the exploitation system, realization of the public ownership
 of the means of production, the masses of people being the masters of the
 country and the implementation of the principle of distribution according to
 work, the superiority of the socialist system is also manifested in
 spiritual civilization.  Socialism has eliminated the social phenomena of
 the exploitation of man by man and the oppression of man by man, thus
 enabling all people to have common fundamental interests, common ideals,
 common goals of struggle and common moral standards, and even a common
 sense of law and discipline.  Although in a socialist society there exists
 a class struggle within certain limits and the influences of the remnants
 of feudal ideas and of capitalist ideology, fundamentally speaking, because
 all people have common interests and share joys and sorrows together, vari-
 ous virtues, such as ardently loving the motherland and ardently loving
 labor, being concerned with the collective, finding it a pleasure to help
 others, being selfless, observing discipline and abiding by the law and
 heroic dedication to socialism and communism, will always find expression
 in more and more people.   In addition, these common revolutionary ideals,
 morality and discipline cannot be possessed by any society with class
 antagonism, which is based on the private ownership system of the means of
 production.  Take the educational, scientific and cultural undertakings for
 example.  China's present level of development in this respect lags far
 behind that of the developed capitalist countries, but we must see to it
 that our educational, scientific and cultural undertakings genuinely serve
 the working people.  Therefore, taken as a whole, the more socialist
 spiritual civilization develops, the more fully the superiority of the
 socialist system will be manifested.
 Seen from the practical experience of building socialism, we have had pro-
 found experiences and lessons in the issue of building socialist spiritual
 civilization.   Carrying forward revolutionary traditions and attaching

 importance to ideological and political work are our party's glorious tradi-
 tions.  In a considerably long period of time, the general mood of our
 society has been fine.  However, during the 10 years of the "Great Cultural
 Revolution," owing to the sabotage done by Lin' Biao and the "gang of four,"
 China's educational, scientific and cultural undertakings were seriously
 trampled'underfoot; anarchism and out-and-out egoism ran rampant and the
 fine party style and the work style of the people were seriously damaged.
 These evil influences have not yet been completely eliminated to this day.
 In the last few years, there has been a renewed increase in the corrosive
 influence of capitalist ideology coming from other countries in the ranks of
 our party members and cadres.  The history of complications and the present
 situation have greatly educated us, thus enabling us to acquire a further
 understanding of the importance and necessity of building socialist spiritual
 civilization.  At present, the 12th CPC Congress report has theoretically
 made a brilliant exposition of socialist spiritual civilization and affirmed
 it as an important characteristic of socialism and a major aspect of the
 superiority of the socialist' system.  This is a great advance in the party's
 understanding of socialism and also the inheritance and development of the,
 theory of scientific socialism.  It will play a great guiding role in our
 socialist modernization program.
 ./While studying the third main point, we must emphatically comprehend that:
 1) Why should socialist spiritual civilization take communist ideology as
 its core?  2) Why should stress be put on the conducting of education in
 communist ideology during the period of socialism?/
 The report points out that communist ideology constitutes the core of
 socialist spiritual civilization.  It is known to all that the so-called
 core refers to the section of a thing which plays a guiding role in the
 internal parts of the thing and which determines its nature and orienta-
 tion.  Any society is bound to develop the cultural aspect of spiritual
 civilization which it needs.  However, the scope and level of the cultural
 aspect can neither determine its own character and orientation nor show the
 character and orientation of the socialist spiritual civilization of the
 whole society.   This is determined by the character and orientation of the
 development of another aspect of spiritual civilization--ideological educa-
 tion.  Some contents of the cultural aspect, such as education and litera-
 ture and art, have a class character in such fundamental questions as the
 guiding ideology of their development and who they serve; the cultural
 aspect is restricted by the politics and ideology in a society; the other
 contents such as natural sciences, hygiene and education have no class
 character themselves but there still exists the question of under the
 guidance of what ideology they should be developed.  As a scientific
 ideological system which reflects the laws governing social development,
 communism represents the fundamental interests of the people and occupies
 a guiding position in all spheres of our socialist society.  This just
 determines that communism will surely constitute the core of socialist
 spiritual civilization and that we are also surely required to educate the
 people in communist ideology and morality while building socialist spiritual
 civilization.

 Some people say that while we are in a stage of socialism, it is unwise to
 raise the question of education in communist ideology and morality.  This
 view is erroneous and does not tally with historical and practical facts.
 As a social system, the characteristics of communism are from each according
 to his ability, to each according to his work.  Only when the productive
 forces are substantially developed and the political consciousness of the
 people is tremendously heightened can the communist system be realized.
 This requires generations of protracted endeavors.  However, the spread of
 communist ideas and the revolutionary movement for the realization of the
 ideal of communism already existed long ago in our life.  The Chinese com-
 munist movement has been carried out in an organized and programmatic way
 in China since the very day when the PRC was founded.  Without the vanguard
 founded on the basis of the communist ideological system and without influ-
 encing and educating the masses in communist ideology, the victory of the
 new democratic revolution was out of the question, let alone the victory of
 the-economic construction which we are carrying out today!  Of course, we
 are definitely not intending to immediately carry out in society the poli-
 cies of the higher phase of socialism-communism, but on the contrary, we
 must persist in implementing the system of distribution according to work
 and other socialist systems and avoid repeating the errors made in the past
 under the guidance of "leftist" ideology.  However, only when we influence,
 and educate the masses in communist ideology and enhance, their political
 consciousness and enthusiasm for revolution can the socialist orientation
 of China's modernization be safeguarded, can our socialist society acquire
 tremendous spiritual motivation and strong fighting spirit and can the
 inroad of corrupt influences be resisted.  It is only in this way that we
 can fulfill the historical tasks of the socialist modernization program and
 lay a solid foundation for our advance toward the great goal of communism.
 In reality, inspired by communist ideology, whether in the period of the
 new democratic revolution or in the period of socialism, there were
 thousands upon thousands of heroic fighters who defied personal danger,
 shed their blood and dedicated their lives to the cause of communism and
 there are thousands upon thousands of advanced people who are giving all
 they have to socialist construction.  We must encourage a communist ideology
 and attitude toward labor, learn from revolutionary martyrs and from advanced
 people and do a good job in every kind of work in the socialist modernization
 program.
 /While studying the fourth main point, we must clearly and definitely under-
 stand that the aim of our building of socialist spiritual civilization is to
 inspire more and more members of our society to become working people with
 lofty ideals, moral integrity, education and a sense of discipline through
 practical work in various fields, and in addition we must foster and develop
 in all of society new social relations which embody socialist spiritual
 civilization./
 Socialist spiritual civilization consists of two aspects, cultural develop-
 ment. and ideological education.  Building socialism and communism requires
 highly advanced cultural and scientific knowledge.  Lenin pointed out:  "It
 is impossible to establish a communist society in a country of illiterates."
 He also said:  "Only when he enriches himself with the whole wealth of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100380001-6
 knowledge created by mankind can a man become a communist."  ("Selected
 Works of Lenin," Vol 4, pp 348, 357)  It is beyond imagination to build
 socialism and communism without inheriting and grasping the whole wealth of
 knowledge of mankind and without ensuring the high development of the
 educational, scientific and various other cultural undertakings.  Owing to'
 social and historical reasons, erroneous ideas such as the underestimation
 of the importance of education, science and culture and discrimination
 against intellectuals were rife in our party for a fairly long time, and
 although they have now been overcome to some extent, they still call for
 further elimination.  We must further implement the policy toward intellec-
 tuals, arouse the enthusiasm of the intellectuals and ensure the continued
 development of the cultural aspect both ideologically and organizationally.
 We must fulfill the task of achieving universal primary education in the
 main throughout the country in 1990, and at the same time, pay close atten-
 tion to the training of cadres so that they can become more knowledgeable
 and specialized, to the tutoring of the young staff and workers so that they
 can acquire more general knowledge and to the development of various other
 cultural undertakings.
 While strengthening cultural development, we must vigorously carry out
 ideological education.  The contents of ideological education are many but
 the most-important one is revolutionary ideals, morality and discipline.
 We must first of all help party members, Communist Youth League members
 and all other advanced elements foster communist ideals, morality and
 practices and attitude toward labor, foster lofty ideological values, way
 of life and aesthetic standards, foster the spirit of consciously abiding
 by the law and a high sense of organization and discipline, persist in
 subordinating the personal and partial interests to the interests of the
 whole and the immediate interests to the long-term interests, foster the
 spirit of doing everything for socialist modernization and for the socialist
 motherland and carry forward the lofty spirit of patriotism and inter-
 nationalism through effective propaganda and educational work, ideological
 and political work and the work in various other spheres.   Strengthening
 cultural development and ideological education is aimed at inspiring more
 and more members of our society to become working people with lofty ideals,
 moral integrity, education and a sense of discipline.
 The enhancement of the mental outlook and ideological values of every member
 of our society will inevitably find expression in social relations.   While
 building socialist spiritual civilization, we must also foster and develop
 a new type of social relations which embody socialist spiritual civiliza-
 tion.  These relations refer to the relationship of mutual respect, mutual
 concern, equality, friendship and solidarity in the various intercourses of
 people's social life, such as the economic, political and family life, and
 they also contain solidarity, friendship and mutual assistance in common
 struggle and common progress among the people of all nationalities through-
 out the country in terms of ideology, politics and morality and justice, and
 a relationship which is based on the identity of fundamental interests.  At
 present, there still exist various problems in the social relations of our
 country.  This is because it has not been long since the establishment of
 our socialist society which "still bears the birthmark of the old society

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100380001-6
 in the various fields--the economic, the moral and the spiritual."
 ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 3, p 10)  All this coupled with
 the pernicious influence of anarchism and out-and-out egoism incited by the
 Lin Dino and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques during the "Great
 Cultural Revolution," has not been eliminated up to now.  This cannot but
 bring .a serious negative influence in social relations.  In order to foster
 and develop the new type of social relations, apart from doing a good job in
 the building of material civilization, the most fundamental measure is to
 educate the people in revolutionary ideals, morality and discipline and
 to oppose the corrosive influences of feudal and capitalist ideologies.
 To build socialist spiritual civilization and strengthen ideological educa-
 tion, we must organize a mighty contingent of militant ideological workers
 able to persuade and act as a magnet for others and also mobilize the whole
 party and all people to enthusiastically plunge into the building of social-
 ist spiritual civilization.  Since ideological education in our party is the
 pillar of the building of socialist spiritual civilization in the whole
 society, so the leadership of the party and the exemplary role which the
 party members morally and ideologically play are of decisive significance.
 To build. socialist spiritual civilization and strengthen ideological educa-
 tion, we must do a good job in the various types of work, mainly in doing
 more,to educate the masses of people, and first of all the cadres and youth,
 in Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and in history, morality and dis-
 cipline; we must promote education in ideals, morality and discipline among
 the entire population, and first of all among the youth, within the next 5.
 years.  In the last years, the mass activities.for building spiritual
 civilization unfolded in the PLA and among the people in general should be
 developed and persisted in.  We must bring about a fundamental turn for the
 better in standards of social conduct.
 All of us must, through study, deepen .our understanding, heighten our con-
 fidence and wage resolute struggle against the various unhealthy tendencies
 in society and.the vile social evils in light of the actual. conditions and-
 make contributions in bringing about a fundamental turn for the better in
 standards of social conduct gnd in building socialist spiritual civilization.
