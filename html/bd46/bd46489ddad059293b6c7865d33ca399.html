 LEBANON
 Arab League representatives decided
 on September 4 to put off an Arab sum-
 mit conference on Lebanon until the third
 week in October, apparently to give
 president-elect Sarkis time to form a
 government and for League officials in
 Beirut to try to win broader support for
 their peace plan.
 Syria doubtless welcomed the post-
 ponement, which frees the Syrians to con-
 centrate on their preparations for Sarkis'
 assumption of office on September 23 and
 their next move after that. Judging by the
 low level of military activity over the past
 few weeks, the Syrians are still undecided
 whether to press their military advantage
 against the Palestinians and Lebanese
 leftists before
 president.
 The Syrians are apparently confident,
 meet in Syria on September 27. The an-
 nouncement immediately sparked
 speculation in Beirut that the three leaders
 plan to form some sort of alliance, and the
 subject has subsequently become the
 target of leftist propaganda attacks.
 Asad, meanwhile, conferred this week
 with top Lebanese Christian leaders, in-
 cluding the extremist Camille Shamun.
 The leftists' radio in Beirut said Asad and
 the Christians talked about the timing of a
 possible Syrian military move as well as
 the problems of rebuilding the Lebanese
 army and choosing a new prime minister
 and cabinet to serve under Sarkis.
 The radio also contended that the
 Syrians are urging that the swearing-in
 ceremony be held at Shaturah, a Lebanese
 town well within Syrian-controlled
 territory. The Syrians may want Sarkis to
 take his oath of office somewhere under
 their control both to ensure his safety and
 to underscore the legitimacy of their
 presence in Lebanon.
 Palestine Liberation Organization chief
 Yasir Arafat sent three of his closest aides
 to Damascus last weekend in an apparent-

 The Syrians
 do not appear to
 be taking Arafat's latest entreaties very
 seriously. Indeed, Asad-who has come
 deeply to distrust Arafat-probably sees
 some advantage in encouraging these
 divisions in order to undercut Arafat's
 position. (An assessment of the Syrian
 strategy in Lebanon appears on page 7.)

 President Qadhafi's unruffled reaction

 Egyptian military buildup on the border
 seems to have baffled Cairo. The Egyp-
 MAO'S DEATH
 The death of Mao Tse-tung, announced
 on September 9, will not come as a
 traumatic surprise to the Chinese people;
 the regime has been preparing the public
 for this event for some time through wide
 dissemination of photographs showing an
 increasingly aged and infirm Chairman.
 The political repercussions of his demise,
 however, may well last for years. These
 are  discussed  on  page  12.
 tians have barely mentioned his con-
 ciliatory speech on September 1, and they
 have toned down their own threatening
 statements.
 An Egyptian diplomat in Tripoli in fact
 recently characterized the Qadhafi
 speech-in which the Libyan tried to por-
 tray himself as the reasonable party to the
 dispute-as a clever move that had effec-
 tively boxed Egypt into a corner. The
 Egyptian reasoned that his government
 could not afford to back down from its
 plans to move against Qadhafi but,
 because of his speech, will look like the
 aggressor if it does move.
 The diplomat's judgment that Egypt
 has gotten itself into a no-win situation
 and that Qadhafi has been able with
 relative ease to put himself across as the
 innocent party may be shared by other
 Egyptian officials. They may now be
 assessing how best to reconstruct a credi-
 ble case against the Libyan leader.
 Qadhafi, for his part, seems to think
 that an outwardly reasonable approach is
 his best course. He repeated in an inter-
 view published last weekend a promise he
 had made in his speech-that in the in-
 terests of Arab unity he would not use Li-
 byan forces even to repel an Egyptian at-
 tack. He also offered to meet with Egyp-
 tian President Sadat in a neutral country
 to  resolve their differences without
 mediators. Sadat is unlikely to respond.

 SOUTH AFRICA
 Recent incidents in Cape Town have
 dramatized  the  possibility that an-
 tiapartheid demonstrations might even-
 tually trigger serious violence in white
 business or residential areas.
 Police in Cape Town used tear gas on
 September 2 to disperse some 3,000
 colored (mulatto) high school students
 holding a demonstration in the downtown
 area to denounce apartheid. The clash oc-
 curred when the authorities suddenly
 ordered the demonstrators to disperse.
 This week, smaller groups of colored
 students  persisted  in  staging
 demonstrations in the downtown area but
 were  dispersed,  apparently without
 much bloodshed.
 The death toll from urban rioting since
 June-almost 300 blacks but only 3
 whites   and   fewer   than   10
 coloreds-reflects the fact that major
 violence has been confined to the black
 townships. Within the last week or so,
 however, relatively small-scale rioting has
 spread among the colored townships in
 the vicinity of Cape Town. In several in-
 stances, rioters have damaged property in
 adjacent white communities.
 Although government leaders have
 avoided any publicized meetings with
 blacks since July, it was announced last
 week that Prime Minister Vorster will
 meet with the leaders of the tribal
 homelands on October 8. Official com-
 mentary has implied that Vorster will dis-
 cuss the tribal leaders' recent demand for
 the release or fair trial of all the urban
 blacks who have been arrested since
 June-more than 800 blacks are under
 detention.
 Vorster apparently intends to maintain
 a tough stance until calm is restored in an
 attempt to show that the government is
 not yielding to dissidence. Vorster
 probably also wants to defer dealing
 directly with the blacks until after the
 special caucus of his political party that is
 to convene on September 10 in Pretoria.
 The caucus will be attended by some 300
 leaders of the ruling National Party.
 The South African press is speculating
 that the caucus will try to develop a con-
 sensus on some limited modifications of
 the apartheid system.
 Vorster will probably also use the
 caucus to report on his recent meeting
 with Secretary Kissinger in Switzerland.
 Vorster, however, is clearly avoiding any
 move that would suggest he is bowing to
 foreign criticism.
 /Z-/J
 USSR-US-SOUTH AFRICA
 Soviet commentary on the US-South
 African talks in Zurich has stressed the
 role played by Secretary Kissinger and
 betrays Moscow's apprehension over the
 possibility that "shuttle diplomacy" may
 come into play in southern Africa.
 Writing in Pravda on September 7,
 senior political commentator Yury
 Zhukov charged that the US role in
 Africa may cause "new dangerous com-
 plications" in the area and that the
 Secretary is trying to maintain "racists"
 in power. During the Zurich talks, Soviet
 media accused the US of resorting to
 "illusory  compromises,  dubious  half
 measures, and political maneuvers" to
 create the "semblance" of a solution.
 The message to black African leaders is
 to be wary in dealing with the US.
 The Soviets are already concerned that
 Secretary Kissinger's efforts may bear
 fruit. The chief of the USA Institute's
 Foreign Policy Department, G. A.
 Trofimenko, remarked to a US embassy
 official on September 7 that he personally
 viewed the Secretary's activities in Africa
 as a "carbon copy" of the US approach in
 the Middle East.
 The selection
 of Zhukov--a well-
 connected commentator who usually
 deals with major East-West issues-to
 write the Pravda commentary strongly
 suggests that more than just African in-
 terests are involved. Zhukov's comments
 appear to be part of an increasing inclina-
 tion on the part of the Soviets to Find fault
 with the US administration in general and
 the Secretary's role in particular.

 Presidents Nyerere of Tanzania (1) and Neto of Angola arrive at summit meeting
 SOUTHERN AFRICA l 5- 17
 The five African presidents most direct-
 ly involved in southern African problems
 met this week in Dar es Salaam, Tan-
 zania, with black nationalist leaders from
 Rhodesia, Namibia, and South Africa.
 Much of the two-day meeting apparently
 sion of the talks mentioned only that the
 liberation struggle would be intensified.
 The five presidents-Nyerere of Tan-
 zania, Kaunda of Zambia, Khama of
 Botswana, Machel of Mozambique, and
 Neto of Angola-probably held off mak-
 ing any final decisions until they assess the
 results of Secretary Kissinger's meeting
 with South African Prime Minister
 Vorster last weekend.
 Statements by rival Rhodesian
 nationalist leaders confirm  that no
 progress was made either at the Dar es
 Salaam gathering or at a preliminary
 meeting among the Rhodesians in
 Mozambique last week toward uniting
 their badly fragmented movement.
 The summit meeting marked a
 broadening of the role of Nyerere, Kaun-
 da, Machel, and Khama. They had
 previously focused almost entirely on
 Rhodesia, but at this meeting they ap-
 parently also discussed ways to aid
 nationalists aiming to overturn white con-
 trol of Namibia-an area of particular
 concern to Angolan President Neto-and
 South   Africa   itself.
 focused  on strengthening the black 25X1
 African  military effort  against  Ian
 Smith's white regime in Rhodesia.
 A brief statement issued at the conclu-
 6' - 7      Rhodesian insurgency intensifies
 Rhodesian security forces say they have
 been inflicting very heavy casualties on
 the guerrillas, but the level of insurgent
 activity appears not to have been affected.
 According to government figures, 131
 guerrillas were killed in Rhodesia during
 August-the highest monthly total since
 the fighting began in 1972. Press reports,
 however, indicate that the insurgents last
 week made one of their largest attacks
 ever. Some 100 guerrillas are said to have
 followed up a mortar and rocket barrage
 by raiding a Rhodesian army outpost near
 Mtoko in northeast Rhodesia.
 In southeastern Rhodesia, the guer-
 rillas, according to press reports, shot
 down a helicopter.
 GREECE-TURKEY ~O  31
 Greece has apparently decided once
 again not to interfere with the activities of
 the Turkish ship Sismik I in contested
 waters of the Aegean.
 The latest mission of the Sismik I
 began last week and is expected to run
 through September 25. The Turks say the
 ship will be operating in an area that en-
 compasses large portions of the continen-
 tal shelf claimed by Greece and in zones
 where the two countries have granted
 overlapping oil concessions.
 The Greeks expressed concern in a
 demarche to the US, but have not re-
 quested any new action by the US. Athens
 may also have made similar demarches to
 the UN Security Council and several

 West European governments.
 In a weekend speech in Thessaloniki,
 Prime Minister Caramanlis hinted that
 despite the sensitivity of the Turkish
 ship's present area of research, Greece
 would be ready to resume a dialogue with
 Turkey when the ship completed its mis-
 sion. His conciliatory approach-which
 has included a recent public admission
 that Turkey does have some rights in the
 Aegean-leaves him open to domestic
 criticism, and Caramanlis sought in his
 speech to assure his audience that he
 would defend national interests and
 honor.
 The Turkish government appears to be
 trying to induce the Greeks to accept
 bilateral negotiations on Turkish terms,
 which include withdrawal of the current
 Greek appeal to the International Court
 of Justice. The Court has announced that
 it will rule September 11 on the Greek
 request for a preliminary injunction
 against the Sismik's activities in disputed
 waters. The Turkish ambassador in
 Washington told US officials earlier this
 week that a Court ruling against Turkey
 would be "detrimental" to the future
 course of talks.
 Turkish Prime Minister Demirel seems
 to be trying to undercut charges by the op-
 position that his Aegean policy lacks
 boldness. In his pushing and probing,
 however, Demirel could eventually force
 Caramanlis to react in kind and possibly
 set the stage for a military confrontation.
 CYPRUS
 A three-party alliance supporting Presi-
 dent Makarios and his handling of the
 Cyprus issue scored a decisive victory
 over former House of Representatives
 president Glafkos Clerides' party in the
 parliamentary election on September 5.
 According to unofficial results, the
 alliance, composed of the centrist
 Democratic Front, the Communists, and
 the Socialists, won 69.5 percent of the
 vote and 34 of 35 seats. The Democratic
 Front-which acted as Makarios' sur-
 rogate-ran first in the popular vote and
 won all 21 seats it contested. It will have
 control of the House. The Communists
 ran second in the popular vote and won all
 9 seats they contested; the Socialists won
 4 of 6 seats.
 Greek Cypriot negotiator Tassos
 Papadopoulos, who ran as an independent
 and is likely to be the next House presi-
 dent, won the  remaining seat with the
 support of the pro-Makarios parties.
 Clerides' center-right Democratic Rally
 made a respectable showing. It won 24.1
 percent of the popular vote but failed to
 gain any seats because of the winner-
 take-all election system.
 Makarios, who has long advocated in-
 ternationalization of the Cyprus issue in
 order to bring pressure on the Turks, call-
 ed for Greek Cypriot unity and respect for
 the electorate's verdict. Clerides vowed to
 continue to work for a more conciliatory
 approach to negotiations.

 USSR  L4'
 93
 The appointment last week of Nikolay
 Tikhonov as Soviet first deputy premier is
 an initial step to deal organizationally
 with the serious illness of Premier
 Kosygin. The Soviet ambassador to
 Czechoslovakia told the US ambassador
 on September 1 that Kosygin, 72, had suf-
 fered a heart attack and was resting in a
 sanitarium. Kosygin continues to be ab-
 sent from leadership and state functions.
 Tikhonov becomes one of two first
 deputy premiers; the other is Kirill
 Mazurov who has held the post since
 1965. Tikhonov, 71, is General Secretary
 Brezhnev's protege. He made his early
 career in metallurgy and as deputy
 premier has been responsible for that field
 and the coal industry.
 The leadership may have promoted
 Tikhonov to help with the heavy workload
 that Kosygin has carried. Brezhnev un-
 doubtedly welcomed the opportunity to
 place an ally that high in the government
 to counterbalance the more independent
 Mazurov. Tikhonov may also be elected
 to the Politburo; Mazurov is a member,
 as was former first deputy premier
 Polyansky.
 If Kosygin should retire or die, his
 successor appears to be an open question.
 Mazurov has the clearest claim to the job.
 Brezhnev may have wanted to ensure that
 his man, Tikhonov, served as first deputy
 in such an eventuality. Mazurov, 62, is in
 indifferent health, however, and was ab-
 sent from public view from early June un-
 til last week.
 Tikhonov could replace Kosygin but
 probably only after serving a period on
 the Politburo. His close association with
 Brezhnev would probably not sit well with
 Kosygin and other collective members.
 Other choices for the premiership are
 possible, but do not seem prefigured by
 the  Mazurov-Tikhonov  pairing.

 MEXICO       -5-7
 Mexico floated the peso on August 31
 to curb large speculative capital flight and
 to correct distorted foreign-domestic price
 relationships. The regulated float has
 resulted in an immediate 39-percent
 devaluation of the peso. The government
 will try to stabilize it at the current level of
 about 20 pesos to the dollar. Before the
 float, it was 12.5 pesos to the dollar.
 The peso has been under severe selling
 pressure for most of this year, primarily
 because Mexico's inflation rate has out-
 paced the US rate. Persistent rumors that
 devaluation was imminent led to an es-
 timated $200-million monthly capital out-
 flow.

 adverse effect of the devaluation.
 Excessive stress on maintaining real in-
 comes will increase inflationary pressures,
 retarding the improvement of business
 confidence and hampering new private in-
 vestment in export industries. We believe
 president-elect Lopez Portillo, who will
 take office on December 1, will give
 greater priority to controlling inflation
 and to strengthening the role of private
 business.
 The 1977 budget, now being prepared
 with a direct contribution from Lopez
 Portillo, reportedly will be far more
 austere than the present one. Lopez Por-
 tillo is likely to place more restraint on
 government spending and to increase the
 productivity  of government workers
 through a major reorganization of the ex-
 ecutive branch. These actions will tem-
 porarily slow economic growth.
 Initial benefits from the devaluation
 will be the curtailment of capital flight
 and greatly increased net receipts from
 tourism and border transactions.
 Tourism-Mexico's  main  foreign  ex-
 change earner and largest industry-has
 slumped sharply since 1974.
 Mexico's trade deficit this year will still
 be more than $3.0 billion, down only
 modestly from last year's $3.7 billion.
 Mexico will not be able to cut imports
 much without substantially reducing
 economic growth, and exports cannot be
 increased significantly soon because of
 capacity constraints.
 The outlook for the trade deficit in the
 medium and long term could be much
 brighter. Devaluation will increase the
 competitiveness of many Mexican
 products, especially in the US, its natural
 market. If Lopez Portillo succeeds in
 restoring business confidence and invest-
 ment spending, devaluation is likely to
 lead to a sharp upswing in Mexican
 manufactured goods exports, which,
 along with growing oil exports, will sub-
 stantially reduce the trade deficit.
 Uruguay- New Government Tightens Controls
 Uruguay's military leaders, working
 through newly appointed President
 Aparicio Mendez, have freed many
 political prisoners. Almost simultaneous-
 ly, they have tightened their hold on the
 government and deprived many
 Uruguayans of their political rights.
 The government recently announced
 that it had freed 1,359 persons who had
 been "processed for seditious offenses."
 The US embassy has estimated that
 previously there were about 2,000
 political prisoners.
 At about the same time, Mendez signed
 two institutional acts that the military had
 made conditions of his appointment. One
 of these creates a new ministry of justice
 to "harmonize relations" among the
 various branches of government; gives
 cabinet rank to members of the national
 security council (thus, to service com-
 manders); creates a secretariat of plan-
 ning, coordination, and information un-
 der the presidency; and provides for
 military management of city governments
 until a new constitution is adopted.
 The other institutional act denies for 15
 years the rights of both voting and
 political activity to all Marxist candidates
 for public office in 1966 and 1971 and to
 all persons "processed" for crimes against
 the state. It denies the right to political ac-
 tivity for 15 years, but not the right to
 vote, to the candidates for president and
 vice president in 1966 and 1971, all
 legislators elected in 1971 except those
 holding "political posts," and board
 members of the political parties. This act
 also creates an "interpretive commission"
 that will rule on cases involving the
 prohibition of political activity.
 There has been little public reaction to
 the new decrees, probably because they
 are confusing and open to wide interpreta-
 tion. For the most part, Uruguayans have
 become complacent about military rule
 with civilian trappings. F_

 The Syrians remain determined to stay in Lebanon until at
 least most of their objectives are met. They want a political
 balance in Lebanon that keeps any one of the contending
 groups, including the Christians, from exerting dominant con-
 trol. Above all, their aim is to prevent Egypt or the radical Arab
 states from gaining influence in Lebanon.
 Syria: Intentions in Lebanon
 The Syrian-Palestinian dispute has
 become the priority issue in the Lebanese
 crisis. Until that conflict is resolved, there
 is little prospect for any serious peace
 negotiations among the contending
 Lebanese Muslim and Christian factions.
 The Syrians do not believe the
 Palestinians are serious in their recent
 pledges to abide by past Lebanese-Palesti-
 nian                                                   accords regulating fedayeen  ac-
 tivities in Lebanon. Damascus therefore is
 pursuing a course aimed at sharply
 limiting  the  Palestinians' military
 capabilities, splitting the Palestinians
 from their Lebanese leftist allies, and,
 perhaps, securing the removal of Yasir
 Arafat as head of the Palestine Liberation
 Organization.
 Damascus is making contingency plans
 for increased Syrian military activity in
 Lebanon. The Syrians presumably feel
 confident they can continue to press the
 Palestinians without serious constraints
 being imposed on them by the other
 Arabs or the Soviets. Syria also may
 calculate that the Palestinians cannot
 withstand a renewed Syrian offensive for
 long without suffering major splits in their
 ranks.
 The Syrians are considering whether to
 move  before  or  after  Lebanese
 president-elect Sarkis has taken office on
 September 23. Their apparent determina-
 tion to bring the Palestinians to heel is
 already posing serious problems for
 Sarkis, whose candidacy was strongly
 backed by Syria. Sarkis is known to
 believe that Lebanese problems cannot be
 attacked  in  earnest  until  the
 Syrian-Palestinian quarrel is resolved.
 Sarkis, moreover, has been under
 pressure from moderate Muslim leaders
 to secure some commitment from
 Damascus for an eventual Syrian
 withdrawal, and he may have to distance
 himself from the Syrians to establish his
 own credibility. The Syrians presumably
 want him to have sufficient stature to con-
 duct meaningful negotiations among the
 Lebanese factions, and they may give him
 a pledge of an eventual phased withdrawal
 of their forces.
 Syria might conclude that it can best
 ease Sarkis' problems by launching ex-
 panded military action against the-
 Palestinians before he takes office. In any
 case, the Syrians' determination to
 chasten and control the Palestinians may
 lead them to act quickly without reference
 to Sarkis' negotiating efforts or interests.
 Recent Hesitation
 Until now, the Syrians have not wanted
 to take any action that would fundamen-
 tally change the situation in ways that
 would prompt President Franjiyah or
 other Christian extremists to try to pre-
 vent the transfer of power to Sarkis. Syria
 presumably has believed that there is at
 least some possibility that the replace-
 ment of the intransigent Franjiyah with
 the relatively pragmatic Sarkis will make
 all sides to the conflict more willing to
 compromise.
 Syrian President Asad apparently has
 also been delaying a major new military
 push out of concern that the military
 balance in Lebanon might swing too far
 toward the Christians. Asad does not
 want the Christians to make so much
 progress on the ground that they seriously

 attempt to pursue their preferred strategy
 of driving the fedayeen out of Lebanon.
 The Syrians would be pleased to see the
 Palestinians' conventional  military
 capabilities sharply limited and to have
 fedayeen units forced into the refugee
 camps and commando bases that
 Damascus can control or monitor. Syria
 does not favor complete destruction of the
 fedayeen movement, however, and will
 not back the Christians in unrestricted
 warfare against the Palestinians.
 Despite their distrust of the
 Palestinians,  Syrian  leaders  probably
 would still be satisfied with a Palestinian
 commitment to adhere to the 1969 Cairo
 and  1973 Melkart accords regulating
 fedayeen activities in Lebanon.[--
 Seeking Balance
 Syrian leaders apparently believe what
 the  Syrian  media  consistently
 emphasize-that there must be "no vic-
 tor, no vanquished" in Lebanon. This
 conviction is based on the assessment that
 Syria's ability to control events in that
 country is greatest if none of the major
 factions, including the Palestinians and
 the Christians, is able to win a decisive
 military victory.
 Syria believes such a standoff provides
 the greatest chance for reviving the in-
 fluence of the traditional  Muslim
 politicians. These Lebanese leaders have
 generally cooperated with Syria, but are
 militarily and politically weak.
 In Syria's view, the traditional Sunni
 Muslim politicians must be strengthened
 to prevent the further increase in power of
 socialist leader  Kamal Jumblatt and
 leaders of the smaller and more radical
 leftist and communist groups. This is fun-
 damental to Damascus' aim of limiting
 the influence in Lebanon of Egypt and the
 radical Arab states, especially Libya and
 Iraq.
 Asad's original goal in Lebanon was to
 prevent partition and thereby avoid an un-
 stable situation likely to prompt
 large-scale outside military intervention
 threatening to Syria. He must now
 recognize that almost complete Muslim
 and Christian local autonomy-de facto
 partition-is inevitable even if a unified
 central  government  is  eventually
 re-established.
 Military Moves
 Syrian forces in recent weeks have been
 attempting to strengthen their control
 over large areas of eastern and northern
 Lebanon, to bolster Christian forces and
 enable them to secure the central moun-
 tains, and gradually to constrict Palesti-
 nian and leftist strongholds in Tripoli and
 in the south.
 Syrian commanders-seeking to avoid
 Syrian casualties and international
 political problems-have also sought to
 create a new Lebanese security force
 made up of Shia Muslims and Christians,
 hoping that it can relieve Syrian forces of
 most ground combat in the disputed areas
 of south-central Lebanon. We consider
 that this force will be of limited use for at
 least several months, however, and is not
 likely at any point to be able by itself to
 sustain  the  military  initiative in
 Palestinian- and leftist-controlled areas of
 the country.
 If Syria continues to believe that the
 Palestinians are not negotiating in good
 faith, it is likely to take more aggressive
 military action. Given Syria's reluctance
 to endure heavy casualties and the inabili-
 ty of the Christians to increase their
 military pressure significantly, however,
 Damascus probably will stop short of
 all-out attacks on Palestinian and leftist
 positions in the major port cities. Syrian
 forces presumably would first launch
 large new offensives in central Lebanon
 and the Jazzin area of southern Lebanon.
 If it became necessary in order to force
 Palestinian capitulation, Syria probably
 would try to destroy the two airstrips
 recently constructed in Palestinian- and
 leftist-controlled areas, and attempt to in-
 terdict all supplies moving northward and
 inland from the ports of Tyre and Sidon.
 International Constraints
 International  political  and  military
 considerations are not likely to restrain
 Asad from taking more aggressive action
 in Lebanon if he concludes that such a
 policy is required to force an end to the
 conflict.
 The possibility that the USSR might
 end its military assistance to Syria is the
 most worrisome consideration Asad
 thinks he faces. His behavior in recent
 weeks suggests, however, that reports of
 Soviet threats have been exaggerated or
 that Damascus believes it can or must ig-
 nore those threats.
 Asad presumably believes that Soviet
 statements calling for a Syrian
 withdrawal from Lebanon are designed
 partly to please the Palestinians and the
 radical Arabs and are not threats that will
 be quickly carried out. Syria probably is
 prepared to accept further deterioration in
 its relations with the USSR, apparently
 believing that Moscow's overall interests
 in the Middle East would prevent it from
 taking any action that would destroy its
 relations with Syria.
 Pleas or demands from the other Arabs
 are even less likely to inhibit Asad. He
 takes satisfaction in the recent restoration
 of large-scale Saudi financial assistance to
 Damascus, in Egypt's inability to counter
 Syria's involvement in Lebanon, and in
 preliminary signs that Iraqi forces op-
 posite the Syrian border may be
 withdrawing. The large-scale deployment
 of Iraqi troops to Syria's eastern border
 did not significantly alter Asad's course.
 Having demonstrated that it can pre-
 vent Arab League forces in Lebanon from
 damaging Syria's essential interests,
 Damascus apparently considers that it
 can now endure or even wring political ad-
 vantage from an Arab summit on
 Lebanon. Syria is privately skeptical that
 anything constructive will emerge from a
 summit.

 Z-l
 Kamal Jumblatt (1), Yasir Arafat (c), and Syrian Foreign Minister Khaddam during meeting earlier this year
 Security and administrative problems
 within Syria continue to increase as a
 result of Damascus' heavy involvement
 in Lebanon. So far, however, these do
 not appear to pose a serious threat to
 Asad.
 Domestic Considerations     25X1
 Asad probably concluded from Syria's
 earlier involvement in ground combat in
 the Sidon area that the Syrian public and
 Palestinian residents of Syria will protest
 actions resulting in heavy casualties, but
 will tolerate even extended and large-scale
 involvement if it does not result in many
 casualties. Thus Syria is likely to avoid
 direct attacks on Palestinian strongholds
 in urban areas, but to intensify its shelling
 and attempt to expand its control in all
 other areas.
 There have been numerous bombings in
 Syria in the past two months-carried out
 mostly by Palestinians and Iraqi
 agents-but  the incidents have not
 diminished Asad's determination.
 Damascus in recent weeks has imposed
 tight control on entry to Syria from
 Lebanon and has arrested many fedayeen
 suspected of terrorist activities.
 Security services have had less success
 in apprehending dissident Syrian Sunni
 Muslims believed responsible for several
 recent political assassinations. The regime
 presumably recognizes that these conser-
 vative opponents are objecting primarily
 to Alawite control of the army and the
 security services. It is probably convinced
 that their opposition would not end even if
 Syrian forces withdrew from Lebanon.
 Asad apparently intimidated most
 high-ranking military officers into endors-
 ing or at least acquiescing in his policy in
 Lebanon by arresting or transferring a
 number of officers early this summer.
 Significant opposition to Syria's in-
 volvement in Lebanon presumably still
 exists among powerful military and
 civilian leaders, but we have no evidence
 that any opposition group is plotting to
 overthrow Asad. Assassination is always
 a possibility, but security precautions for
 Asad and other principal leaders have
 been significantly strengthened in recent
 weeks.
 We know that Syrian leaders are dis-
 turbed by the economic costs to Syria of
 the continuing Lebanese crisis-inflation
 is becoming worse, and approximately
 one million refugees from Lebanon are
 now in Syria. All evidence suggests,
 however, that Damascus considers these
 costs can be eliminated only by a forced
 end to the conflict rather than by a Syr-
 ian withdrawal that might open the way
 for the fighting to continue indefinitely.
 Syrian planners presumably recognize
 that the bulk of the refugees, who are
 Lebanese, Palestinian and Syrian, would
 not be able or willing to return to
 Lebanon for several months even if the
 war ended.
 The installation of a new Syrian
 government last month was not directly
 related to Asad's Lebanon policy. The
 principal   members   of   the
 cabinet-including those most closely
 identified with Syria's intervention in
 Lebanon-retained their positions.
 Focus on Lebanon
 The appointment of a more able and
 active prime minister apparently was
 designed only to ensure that domestic and
 economic problems would be adequately
 treated while the President continues to
 focus on Lebanon. The decision of the
 Arab League foreign ministers on
 September 4 to postpone the Arab sum-
 mit until the third week of October is a
 measure of the Arabs' inability to put
 concerted pressure on Asad. The delay, in
 effect, is an acknowledgement that Syria
 still holds the key to a political solution,
 and it leaves Asad free to pursue his
 military options further if necessary.

 President Giscard has taken another step in trying to build
 a viable centrist coalition able to deal with the nation's
 economic and social problems.
 The French cabinet changes in late
 August disclosed more clearly than before
 the President's strategy for reshaping the
 political system-and his vulnerability if
 he fails.
 President Giscard:
 ? Reduced the Gaullists' role.
 ? Brought a maverick leftist into
 the cabinet.
 ? Named more technicians, whom
 he listed as members of the "presiden-
 tial majority" loyal directly to himself.
 ? Assumed more obvious personal
 responsibility for the government's-ac-
 tions.
 The Gaullists
 Giscard's relationship to the Gaullists
 has always been parasitical. His hopes for
 putting a lasting mark on French polit. s
 have presupposed the exploitation of
 Gaullist strength to develop a power base
 from which Gaullist dominance of the
 non-communist political forces could be
 weakened. In his two years as president,
 Giscard has tried both to divide and con-
 trol the Gaullists, and to isolate their less
 pliable members by making them seem
 merely spokesmen for an outmoded
 rightist ideology.
 In Giscard's first cabinet, maverick
 Gaullist Jacques Chirac, who had sup-
 ported Giscard, won the prime ministry.
 This was the Fifth Republic's most broad-
 ly based cabinet, and Giscard excluded
 major Gaullist leaders who had supported
 Jacques Chaban-Delmas in the first round
 of the presidential race. The minor shuffle
 in January 1976 further reduced the
 Gaullist role.
 The appointment of Olivier Guichard
 as justice minister and minister-of-state in
 France: Giscard's Strategy
 the new cabinet was obviously designed to
 mollify the Gaullists, with whom Giscard
 cannot yet afford a definitive break.
 On September 3, Guichard was also
 named head of a committee formed of the
 senior representatives in the cabinet of
 each of the four groups in the governing
 coalition to oversee the majority's cam-
 paign in the 1977 municipal elections.
 This is a step-down from Chirac's role as
 sole  "coordinator" of the majority's
 political activity. Although the committee
 format will diffuse responsibility
 somewhat, the President may be setting
 up Guichard and the Gaullists to be the
 scapegoats if the governing coalition does
 not do well in the elections.
 Guichard's appointment to the cabinet
 also exploits Gaullist divisions. Guichard,
 a moderate who has been considered
 prime ministerial and presidential timber,
 has been associated for the past two years
 with the more conservative "barons," the
 Gaullists' long-time major figures. Both
 profit from this relationship. Guichard is
 the only serious rival the barons can use
 against Chirac-never completely
 forgiven for deserting to Giscard.
 Guichard, in turn, needs the barons' sup-
 port to advance his own political am-
 bitions.
 Giscard, for his part, had resumed con-
 tact with the barons several months ago
 when he saw that Chirac was not in com-
 plete control of the party.
 With the barons rallying around
 Guichard-magnifying  earlier  Gaullist
 refusals completely to follow Chirac's
 lead-the former prime minister will not
 find it easy to become the party's
 spokesman. Chirac is probably hoping,
 however, that his earlier success in
 revitalizing the Gaullists after their
 humiliating loss to Giscard and his recent
 challenge to Giscard's policies will allow
 him to become the leader of the party in
 the Assembly and challenge Giscard's
 leadership. If only a third of the 175
 Gaullist deputies challenge a government
 proposal, it would face likely defeat.

 All this depends, however, on Chirac's
 return to the Assembly. A by-election will
 soon be held in his district, but 58 percent
 of its votes went to the left in the local
 election last spring.
 Chirac resigned mainly over Giscard's
 efforts to "presidentialize" the govern-
 ment, specifically over the President's
 refusal to grant him the power he wanted
 to guide the government. The constitution
 was on Chirac's side, but Gaullist practice
 was solidly on Giscard's. Chirac would
 have temporarily made the French system
 more parliamentary as he strengthened
 his own role as prime minister in prepara-
 tion for a presidential race against
 Giscard in 1981. Giscard's plans imply
 maintaining the Gaullist presidential
 system, but without Gaullist dominance.
 Chirac wanted an early legislative elec-
 tion, in which he believed the Gaullists
 would have a better chance than the
 would in March 1978. The President
 refused because one of the keys to his pla
 to tame the Gaullists is his expectation
 that they will lose at least one third of
 their deputies in the 490-seat Assembly in
 the next election. He hopes his initiatives
 over the next 18 months will enable tho
 seats-and, he hopes, some now held by
 leftists-to be picked up by his Indepen-
 dent  Republicans, the centrists,
 technocrats, and co-opted leftists all run-
 ning under the "presidential majority"
 banner.
 Giscard's introduction of "presidential
 majority" technicians and a token leftist
 into the new cabinet do not mean he is
 succeeding in his proclaimed desire to
 broaden his political support. He still has
 only marginal influence among Gaullists,
 and he has even greater problems on the
 left.
 Opinion polls show centrist and
 Gaullist voters slipping leftward, but no
 sign of significant shifts to the governing
 coalition by leftist voters or politicians.
 The President has so far failed to mold the
 centrists into a dynamic grouping, and his
 own Independent Republicans do not
 seem to be gaining much ground.
 Giscard often refers to his national
 mandate, but his edge over Socialist Fran-
 cois Mitterrand was razor thin in 1974
 and remains fragile. His personal pop-
 ularity has not increased, and his efforts
 to explain his aims to the electorate do not
 spark enthusiasm.
 Ignoring all this, Giscard has steadily
 increased the emphasis on his role as the
 arbiter of government action, even going
 so far in the latest cabinet shuffle as to
 combine the posts of spokesman for the
 government and the president.
 He seems confident that his programs
 will deal effectively with the nation's
 economic and financial problems and
 pave the way for an "advanced liberal
 society"-one that can eradicate social
 and economic differences in France and
 remold the political system. If he can con-
 vince the voters that he is moving in the
 right direction his coalition will have a
 better chance to win in the 1977 municipal
 elections and to retain its parliamentary
 majority in 1978. As a fallback, he ap-
 parently expects to be able to work with a
 leftist majority. Details of his policy
 proposals will be announced in two to
 three weeks.
 Giscard apparently believes that French
 political dynamics are on his side, and
 that they can help him move France
 toward a system in which conservative
 and social democratic groups can hold
 power while excluding the Communists
 and extreme rightists. He hopes to bring
 about the "opening to the left" by
 decreasing the power and cohesiveness of
 the right, by letting it be known that he
 desires a dialogue with less radical leftist
 leaders, and by proving his sincerity by
 enacting reforms similar to those ad-
 vocated by the left.
 In the coming months, Giscard will
 probably try:
 ? To intensify contacts with Socialists,
 left Radicals and independent leftists.
 ? To prepare the way for a harmonious
 working relationship if the left should win
 in 1978, in part by trying to keep the
 presentation of his programs and his cam-
 paign issue-oriented rather than confron-
 tational.
 ? To mold centrist and Independent
 Republican policies in such a way as to
 encourage the Socialists to accept these
 parties as attractive alternatives to the
 Communists as allies.
 ? To emphasize when possible those
 aspects of his proposals that conform to
 Gaullist traditions in order not entirely to
 alienate that party.
 Giscard has a long way to go, and his
 course opens him to serious vulnerabilities
 if he is unsuccessful. His handling of the
 economy will be crucial. So far, his efforts
 have irritated the left, which sees them as
 too little too late, and the right, which
 finds  them  just  the  reverse.

 Mao Tse-tung's most conspicuous shortcoming was his
 failure to provide for a widely recognized successor. A struggle
 among various rival factions now seems all but inevitable.
 Chairman Mao had been an important
 member of the Chinese Communist Party
 since its founding in 1921, and Chairman
 since the mid-1930s. He has been the most
 important man in China since the Com-
 munists took power in 1949 and the cen-
 tral reference point in the often confused
 politics of the party for much longer. Even
 when his will was partly thwarted by
 others in the Chinese leadership whose
 policy views differed from his own, his
 personality and programs could never be
 ignored; even his opponents claimed to be
 speaking in his name and to be carrying
 out his commands.
 As the dominating force in Chinese
 politics, a founder of the party, the for-
 mulator of the "Chinese way" to com-
 munism, and the man who led the Chinese
 revolution to triumph, Mao will be
 irreplaceable. There is no one on the
 Chinese scene today who even remotely
 commands the authority that has been ac-
 corded to him or who can easily assume
 the charismatic role of leader of the
 Chinese people he exercised for years.
 In the upper echelons of the party,
 however, the Chairman's death may come
 as something of a relief to a considerable
 number of second-level leaders. Mao's
 autocratic actions, suspiciousness, and
 sometimes erratic policy shifts were
 almost certainly resented by some of his
 associates and subordinates, particularly
 in the past decade. Some of these in-
 dividuals are now likely to believe that
 more orderly and rational approaches to
 policy problems can be taken without fear
 of reprisals.
 The Succession Problem in China
 Although Mao's place in the
 three-thousand-year-old history of the
 Chinese state is likely to loom large, one
 conspicuous failure in his long domination
 of the political scene is already glaringly
 evident and is likely to have serious im-
 plications for the future. The Chairman
 did not succeed in providing for a widely
 acknowledged and recognized successor.
 Two designated successors, Liu Sliao-chi
 and Lin Piao, fell by the wayside in 1966
 and 1971 respectively.
 A third, Teng Hsiao-ping, who
 appeared in a position to inherit much of
 Mao's authority if not the formal title of
 party chairman, was removed from all his
 high positions in early April.
 At the same time, the young Wang
 Hung-wen, who by virtue of his position
 in the hierarchy seemed to have a shot at
 succession to the formal title of party
 chairman-but probably without much of
 the authority that normally would accrue
 to that post-was passed over for promo-
 tion last April. Finally, Chou En-lai, who
 by virtue of his experience and the respect
 accorded him by most Chinese was
 perhaps the most logical of all possible
 successors to Mao, died last January.
 A Collegial Group
 For several years the Chinese have talk-
 ed about post-Mao arrangements in terms
 of a collegial group that would in effect
 share the Chairman's authority among
 themselves. Such an arrangement is en-
 tirely possible, at least in the short run,
 since it seems clear that no single in-
 dividual has the stature to replace Mao in
 his full leadership capacity.
 It is possible, in fact, that the post of
 party chairman may now be retired as a
 post that could only be held by the
 irreplaceable leader who has just died.
 The Nationalist Chinese on Taiwan
 followed a similar procedure at the death
 of Chiang Kai-shek last year. In this case,
 Peking would probably revive the post of
 party secretary general, which has been
 dormant since the start of the cultural
 revolution, in order to provide a manager
 for party affairs.
 If the post of chairman is to be filled,
 however, the most likely candidate for the
 job is Premier Hua Kuo-feng, who is now
 Premier Hua Kuo-feng, party
 first vice chairman

 "first" party vice chairman, a new post
 created in early April at the time of the
 fall of Teng Hsiao-ping. Hua is, however,
 a compromise figure who lacks a strong
 power base and who has operated at the
 center of power for only a few years.
 In his hands the post of chairman would
 be less important than it was when Mao
 occupied the position. Moreover, there
 are almost certainly a number of senior
 leaders of the party who would prefer that
 additional power and prestige does not ac-
 crue to Hua. There have been occasional
 covert attacks on Hua in the media since
 January, and his deputy in Hunan
 Province, which he ran before coming to
 Peking, has been under heavy political
 pressure for several months.
 Decision May Be Postponed
 It is possible, therefore, that Hua's
 elevation to the chairmanship could be
 contested, and in fact any decision to fill
 the post might be put off for some time. It
 is also possible that if Hua were elevated
 to the chairmanship, he could be balanced
 by a reconstitution of the post of secretary
 general. In this case a leading candidate
 Chang Chun-chiao, apparent de facto
 party secretary general
 for that job would be the leftist political
 boss of Shanghai, Chang Chun-chiao,
 who probably performs the functions of
 secretary general on a de facto basis at
 present. There is certain to be opposition
 to this appointment from the party's right
 wing, however.
 If the post of chairman were abolished,
 that of the current party vice chairman
 would also have to be abolished. In addi-
 tion to Hua, the other vice chairmen are
 Wang Hung-wen, whose youth makes him
 suspect to many older party members and
 whose alignment with the left wing of the
 party is a major disability in the eyes of
 the rightists, and Defense Minister Yeh
 Chien-ying, a long-time associate of the
 late Chou En-lai who has been identified
 with the party's right wing and who came
 under criticism earlier this year for his
 vehement support of Teng Hsiao-ping.
 The balance these two men provide
 could be an argument for preserving the
 system of chairman and vice chairman. If,
 however, that system is scrapped, Hua
 Kuo-feng would be an obvious candidate
 for the secretary general's post. Since
 Chang Chun-chiao also has claims on this
 job, a clash between the two could easily
 develop.
 Potential Friction
 Insofar as the principle of collegiality is
 followed by the Chinese, the three current
 vice chairmen, plus Chang Chun-chiao
 and Peking Military Region Commander
 Chen Hsi-lien would almost certainly
 form the core of the collective. These five
 men are the most powerful in China to-
 day. They are not likely to work easily
 together, however. The left-right split
 between Yeh, on the one hand, and Wang
 and Chang, on the other, is already
 pronounced, and as already noted, there is
 potential for serious friction between
 Chang and Hua.
 Chen, even more than Defense Minister
 Yeh, is likely to represent military in-
 terests in the collective. Many important
 military figures have resented the leftist
 leaders since the days of the cultural
 revolution, and to the degree that Chen
 speaks for these military men, he could
 come into conflict with Chang and Wang.
 Chen, however, appears to be an am-
 bitious man whose personal interests
 could lead him into temporary and ex-
 pedient alliances with any civilian faction.
 Latent factionalism among the ruling
 group is likely to come to the fore rather
 quickly, in fact. Mao's death occurs at a
 tense and rather fluid moment in Chinese
 politics. Repercussions from the Teng
 purge are still echoing throughout the
 country-in the provinces and in Peking.
 The fissure between the party's right and
 left wings is perhaps wider than at any
 time since the late stages of the cultural

 revolution, and the issue of relations
 between the military and civilian
 members of the party is still not fully
 resolved.
 Since the attacks on Teng began, the
 army has begun to re-emerge as an impor-
 tant factor in political affairs; this tenden-
 cy is likely to become more pronounced in
 the wake of Mao's death.
 This confused situation makes a
 struggle among the various factions in the
 leadership all but inevitable, and this
 struggle is likely to make itself manifest
 sooner rather than later.
 An Unpropitious Time
 Mao has died at an unpropitious mo-
 ment for the party's left wing, however.
 This group-a minority in the party and
 among the leadership-has not yet
 managed to achieve a solid and largely
 unassailable position, as it clearly hoped
 to do before the Chairman's death.
 Mao had his differences with the leftists
 in recent years, but they were at most
 times able to play on his obsessive concern
 for the development of an equalitarian
 China, and their enemies were inhibited
 by fear that Mao could intervene on their
 behalf in unexpected fashion. This inhibi-
 tion has now been removed.
 One likely victim of these changed cir-
 cumstances is Mao's wife, the termagant
 Chiang Ching. She is widely disliked, and
 without the Chairman's potential protec-
 tion she may well fall by the wayside
 rather quickly. The left as a whole is in
 fact now in a somewhat unenviable posi-
 tion. It is likely to be on the defense in
 whatever struggle develops in the wake of
 Mao's death. Nevertheless, leftist leaders,
 although a minority, speak for a signifi-
 cant portion of the Chinese party, and the
 struggle, if it develops, is not likely to be
 resolved quickly.
 This fact, plus the obvious difficulty the
 Chinese will have in adjusting to a China
 without Mao, is likely to inhibit the
 development of new policy initiatives and
 to slow the implementation of policies
 already adopted, both in the domestic and
 foreign policy spheres. If the military
 gains an increased voice in policy making,
 however, it is possible that Peking may
 become more receptive to the idea of
 moderating somewhat its unyielding op-
 position to the USSR.
 The evidence suggests a return to the harsher climate of the
 early 1960s in the USSR's grain-growing regions. This could
 mean a staggering shortfall in the country's annual grain re-
 quirements between now and 1980.
 USSR: Climate and Grain
 The severe Soviet drought of 1975 con-
 trasted sharply with the unusually
 favorable conditions of 1969-1974,
 suggesting a return to the climate-that
 is, weather averaged for a year or
 more-of the early 1960s, when good and
 bad years alternated.
 While good weather has returned to the
 USSR in 1976, there is evidence to
 suggest that a return to harsher average
 conditions is under way. The general
 climatic conditions in the Northern
 Hemisphere since  1974 show definite
 similarities to those of the early 1960s.
 The well-publicized drought of 1972
 was different from those of the early
 1960s and 1975 because its effects were
 felt mainly in the winter grain areas of
 European Russia rather than in the steppe
 regions of the New Lands.
 Assuming the same climate as in
 1962-1965, annual Soviet grain output
 would average no more than 200-million
 tons in 1976-1980. An output of this size
 falls a staggering 25 to 30 million tons
 short of estimated annual requirements. If
 the USSR chooses to cover the deficit by
 imports, these purchases would match
 those following the disastrous grain
 harvests of 1972 and 1975. Alternatively,
 Moscow could cut the already modest
 livestock program.
 Environmental Limitations
 Grain growing in the USSR faces
 severe environmental limitations. Because
 three fourths of the sown area is
 climatically comparable to the prairie
 provinces of Canada and the northern
 great plains in the US, the farmland of the
 USSR is less productive on the average
 than that of the US. As in analogous
 areas in North America, the Soviet
 Union's agricultural land is relatively
 lacking in adequate amounts of heat,
 moisture, and nutrients.
 More than 30 percent of the USSR is
 too cold for agriculture, and an additional
 40 percent is so cold that only hardy, early
 maturing crops can be grown. Even where
 warmth permits a wide range of grain
 crops-south of about 50 degrees
 latitude-low precipitation and high
 temperatures limit moisture so that, with
 few exceptions, grain can be grown only
 by irrigation.
 Because of these unfavorable natural
 conditions, Soviet grain growing areas are
 particularly susceptible to longer term

 USSR: Spring Wheat Yields and Crop Season Precipitation
 On this chart, the relatively higher level of growing season precipitation in the period
 1969-74 is generally associated with higher spring wheat yields; the more normal pattern
 of precipitation of 1960-65 is related to lower yields.
 fluctuations in hemispheric conditions.
 Climatic fluctuations in the USSR, as
 well as in other regions, are related to the
 size of the circumpolar vortex, a dome of
 cold air covering the polar regions.
 As the Northern Hemisphere cools in
 winter, the vortex expands, cooling the
 middle latitudes and moving the
 hemispheric weather patterns southward.
 In summer, it contracts, allowing warmer
 air to move north from the subtropics.
 As important as the size of the vortex,
 is its pattern of waves that extend out
 from it and move with the wind patterns
 of the hemisphere. The size, shape, and
 number of these waves depend on the size
 of the vortex, the temperature difference
 between the pole and the equator, and the
 topography over which the air flows.
 During the late 1960s, the cooling of the
 Northern Hemisphere moved the wetter
 northern climates in the Soviet Union
 southward. At the same time, the changed
 wind pattern associated with this cooling
 brought increasing amounts of air from
 the North Atlantic rather than from
 Siberia.
 This shift increased moisture, cooled
 summers, and prevented the bitter cold of
 the Siberian winter from penetrating into
 the grain belt. The net effect was to trove
 the moist northern climate southward
 about 190 kilometers (120 miles), pushing
 back the desert and nearly doubling rain-
 fall in Kazakhstan. The cooling of the
 Northern Hemisphere and the subsequent
 shift of the desert zone south of the Soviet
 grain belt apparently is also related to the
 Sahelian drought and failures of the In-
 dian monsoon during this period.
 Effect of Climate Change
 The climate changes of the  1960s
 modified the normally harsh conditions
 and had a major effect on Soviet grain
 output. Between the early 1960s and 1974,
 total grain output increased at an average
 of 6.8 million tons annually. We estimate
 that about half of the increase since 1963
 was caused by the more favorable climate.
 The other half is apparently due to a
 greater use of fertilizer and improved
 varieties of grain. The improvement was
 greatest in the southern fringes of the
 grain belt east of the Urals, where spring
 grain output is concentrated.
 In the mid-1970s, the climate appears
 to have reversed itself. The southward
 shift of the desert, which had so benefited
 Soviet agriculture, ended. In late summer
 1974 the hot dry winds, which were com-
 mon in the early 1960s, reappeared in the
 eastern steppe regions of the grain belt.
 The dry weather lasted for more than a
 year, spreading over most of the grain belt
 by the summer of 1975.
 Unlike previous droughts, which were
 concentrated in the New Lands area east
 of the Urals, the 1975 drought also hit the
 grain heartland in the European part of
 the country. In other parts of the world,
 the drought in the Sahel ended, and the
 monsoons returned to India. All three
 events seem linked to an apparent warm-
 ing of the Northern Hemisphere during
 the early 1970s.
