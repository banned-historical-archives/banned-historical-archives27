Hong Kong: Looking 
Toward 1997 
The British and Chinese have made considerable progress toward imple-
menting the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which sets forth the basic 
principles for Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty on 1 July 
1997. We believe their ability to work together has helped in the short run 
to foster a climate for rapid economic growth, spurred by expanding trade 
with the mainland 
Some thorny issues, however, remain that could adversely affect Hong 
Kong's longer term prospects. We believe the most important is the degree 
of autonomy Beijing is prepared to grant the city under the so-called Basic 
Law, the city's future miniconstitution, now under review. A joint Hong 
Kong?China committee appointed by Beijing has just canvassed public 
opinion in Hong Kong on a first draft, and the Basic Law Drafting 
Committee will resume deliberations in January 1989 to consider revisions. 
Local groups have criticized the draft as vague on several key points, in 
particular for failing to provide adequate safeguards against Chinese 
interference in the city's internal affairs after 1997 and for failing to 
provide for the protection of basic civil liberties. Critics also have focused 
on a plan Beijing appears to tacitly support for selecting a post-1997 Hong 
Kong government, which they fear would allow China to manipulate the 
outcome and effectively circumscribe local autonomy. Although these 
critics do not represent a potent political force in Hong Kong, they reflect 
the concerns of many of the colony's large middle class 
Reinforced by China's growing political influence in Hong Kong and the 
proliferation of Chinese-owned companies, these concerns have triggered a 
steady emigration of skilled technicians and professionals who are vital to 
the economy. Both local and international firms have stressed that the 
availability of professionals will figure prominently in their decisions to 
stay in or leave Hong Kong after 1997. Some banks already report staff 
turnovers as high as 50 percent, and some companies, such as Union 
Carbide, have announced plans to relocate. 
We believe Beijing recognizes it must do more to reassure Hong Kong's 
business and professional classes of its commitment to autonomy. We 
expect Beijing will seek to accommodate critics of the Basic Law and to 
crack down on corrupt activities of the growing number of Chinese 
companies operating in Hong Kong. The British also will continue to work

quietly behind the scenes to bolster confidence in Hong Kong's economy 
and future under Chinese sovereignty. Under these circumstances, Hong 
Kong can probably maintain a  business-as-usual appearance for several 
years. 
The longer term outlook, however, will remain murky until the early 1990s. 
For example, we do not know how far Beijing is prepared to go in granting 
local autonomy or even whether its efforts will make much difference given 
Hong Kong residents' distrust of Chinese sincerity. Halfhearted Chine ie 
confidence-building measures would worsen the brain drain, contributing 
not only to a general economic slowdown but also to a serious erosion in 
Hong Kong's ability to provide the financial, communications, and trans-
portation services that make it an attractive international financial center. 
The business climate in Hong Kong also will remain sensitive to events in 
China. We believe that Hong Kong businessmen will watch closely to see 
whether the Chinese leadership's recent decision to shelve price reform 
represents a retreat from the reform program or only a temporary pause. A 
continued strong commitment to market reforms and the open door would 
have a reassuring effect. Alternatively, a clear loss of reform momentum 
or, worse, the reversal of some key reform policies would in our view 
reinforce doubts in Hong Kong about the constancy of Beijing's policy 
toward the colony. Finally, a smooth transfer of power from Deng 
Xiaoping?who is widely regarded as the guarantor of Hong Kong's 
autonomy?is required to demonstrate that a successor can and will abide 
by the 1984 Sino-British accord.

Hong Kong: Looking 
Toward 1997 
Status of the Agreement 
Beijing and London have made considerable progress 
over the past four years toward implementing the 
1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. The Sino-British 
Joint Liaison Group,' formed to iron out technical 
details during the transition to 1997, has already 
agreed on: 
? Hong Kong's continued participation in several in-
ternational organizations such as GATT, the Asian 
Development Bank, and the International Labor 
Organization. 
? The development of new travel documents for Hong 
Kong residents. 
? Several air services agreements. 
? Pension plans for civil service employees. 
The two sides, however, have yet to resolve the 
question of how much autonomy Beijing will allow 
Hong Kong after 1997, when it becomes a Special 
Administrative Region (SAR). This is supposed to be 
spelled out in the Basic Law, a miniconstitution, a 
draft of which Beijing made public last April. A long, 
complex document, the draft attempts to address a 
number of issues relevant to the turnover of power 
including the formation of the first government of the 
SAR, the relationship of the region to the central 
government, the laws applicable to the region, and the 
legal rights of the populace 
To keep China's promise to involve the public in the 
drafting process, a Basic Law Consultative Commit-
tee (BLCC)?an advisory group of Hong Kong and 
mainland Chinese selected by Beijing?canvassed 
public opinion in Hong Kong this summer. Several 
officials from both London and Beijing?including 
Chinese Vice Premier Tian Jiyun, the Director of the 
Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office under the 
State Council Ji Pengfei, and British Foreign Secre-
tary Geoffrey Howe?paid high-profile visits to Hong

operations to Hong Kong. The group's three annual plenary

Kong in the past few months to underscore their 
commitment to the consultations of this committee. 
Cooperation Enhancing Stability 
We believe the ability of the British and Chinese to 
work together has helped in the short run to foster a 
climate for rapid economic growth and has done much 
to maintain public order. The British in particular 
appear determined to keep relations with Beijing 
smooth and to work quietly to iron out troublesome 
issues that could undermine public confidence. British 
officials in London have confided to US Embassy 
officers, for example, that the Hong Kong Govern-
ment is having more say than anticipated in the 
drafting of the Basic Law through Governor David 
Wilson's regular visits to Beijing and through the 
Hong Kong Executive Council members on the draft-
ing committee. Because the British must take a 
hands-off posture toward the Basic Law publicly, 
Wilson is careful always to have a pretext for his 
Beijing visits and to balance them with equally fre-
quent consultations in London. Hong Kong Govern-
ment officials urged civil servants to express opinions 
on the Basic Law draft during the consultative period, 
but in a private capacity as individuals, according to 
Hong Kong Consulate reporting. 
London is trying to work out arrangements for the 
first post-1997 government that will ensure a continu-
ity in policy and bolster confidence. To avoid lame-
duck status in its final years of governing, Britain has 
proposed the idea of a "through-train" legislature?
the reappointment by Beijing of Hong Kong's legisla-
tive councilors to serve in the new SAR government 
after 1997. Although China has rejected this idea 
publicly, a Hong Kong Government official told US 
Consulate officers that Governor Wilson attained 
agreement from Beijing during his November 1988 
visit to allow legislative councilors elected in 1995 to

Group, Ke Zaishuo, in his new office in Hong Kong 
serve four-year terms?thereby bridging the 1997 
transition. In return, London has offered to allow 
Beijing to select or approve Hong Kong Government 
appointments before 1997. The timing remains to be 
worked out, however, with Beijing's demanding im-
mediate approval power and with London's hoping to 
postpone such consultations until at least 1993 
China, in turn, has grown more aware of the need to 
appear responsive to the Hong Kong populace, work-
ing hard, for example, to meet its deadline for releas-
ing the first draft of the Basic Law. 
British officials 
also have commented in private that they believe the 
Chinese are becoming more adept at dealing with 
Hong Kong matters. Beijing is learning how easily 
statements or actions can be misunderstood and send 
Secret 
shock waves through the territory. Hong Kong Chief 
Secretary David Ford told members of the American 
Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong that he be-
lieved Beijing has gone from "being clumsy, to say the 
least" to exhibiting greater sensitivity by agreeing, for 
example, to debates on the Basic Law in both Legco 
and Britain's Parliament. 
Consolidating Economic Ties 
The expansion of economic ties between Hong Kong 
and China?an outgrowth of both the Joint Declara-
tion and reform on the mainland?have contributed to 
the boom and bullish attitude of many Hong Kong 
businessmen. Hong Kong is now China's largest 
export market, importing goods worth $15 billion last 
year, up by half from 1986. The US Consulate in 
Hong Kong estimates that China, through directly or 
indirectly controlled entities, also has invested about 
US $10 billion in the territory, making it the terri-
tory's largest foreign investor. Estimates of the num-
ber of Chinese-owned companies in Hong Kong range

Key Provisions of the 1984 Joint Declaration 
The policies set out in the Joint Declaration and in 
the annexes were to form a basis for the Basic Law. 
Under the agreement: 
? Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy as 
a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the 
People's Republic of China, except in foreign and 
defense affairs, which are the responsibilities of the 
Central People's Government. Socialist policies ap-
plied in the mainland will not be applied to the 
SAR. 
? The people of Hong Kong will continue to enjoy 
their existing rights and freedoms under Hong 
Kong law. The international covenant on civil and 
political rights and the international covenant on 
economic, social, and cultural rights will continue 
to be applied to Hong Kong. Private property, 
ownership of enterprises, legitimate right of inheri-
tance, and foreign investment will be protected by 
law. 
? The legislature of the SAR will make laws for 
Hong Kong. The legislature will be elected (how 
they will be elected is not specified), and the 
executive will be accountable to the legislature and 
to the courts. 
? The government of the SAR will be composed of 
local inhabitants. Beijing will appoint the chief 
executive on the basis of an election or after 
consultations with local authorities. Beijing will 
also appoint principal officials on the recommenda-
tion of the chief executive of the SAR. 
? Hong Kong's legal and judicial systems, including 
the common law, will be maintained. A court of 
final appeal will be established. The maintenance of 
public order will be the responsibility of the govern-
ment of the SAR. 
? The SAR will be able to negotiate agreements and 
participate in international organizations in appro-
priate fields. The SAR will have autonomy in 
economic, financial, and monetary fields. There 
will be no exchange control, and the Hong Kong 
dollar will continue to be freely convertible. Inves-
tors will be able to deposit or withdraw their capital 
freely. The SAR will retain the status of a free port 
and a separate customs territory. 
? The SAR will have independent finances. The Cen-
tral People's Government will not levy taxes on the 
SAR. 
? Existing land rights will be recognized. The Hong 
Kong Government will be able to grant new leases 
extending until the year 2047. 
? The right of free entry into and exit from Hong 
Kong will be guaranteed. The agreement sets out 
the criteria for the right of abode in Hong Kong and 
the issuance and use of passports and other travel 
documents. 
between 2,000 and 4,000?up from only 300 in 1984, 
according to the Hong Kong Consulate and press 
reports. 
At the same time Hong Kong is becoming an impor-
tant economic player in China. According to Hong 
Kong Consulate reporting, of some 7,800 enterprises 
with foreign interests in China, about 6,600 are Hong 
Kong firms. China imported $8.5 billion in goods 
from Hong Kong last year, or about one-fifth of 
3 
25X1 
China's imports. China also earns about one-third of 
its foreign exchange through Hong Kong by direct 
sales to Hong Kong, reexports through Hong Kong, or 25X1 
remittances and investments. Beijing also looks to 
Hong Kong for both management and marketing 
experience and uses its firms there as an educational 
laboratory for learning Western business practices.

Hong Kong's Economy: Business as Usual 
Hong Kong's uncertain status has not slowed its 
economic growth. Following sluggishness in 1985, the 
Hong Kong economy rebounded sharply in 1986, and 
over the last two years has experienced double-digit 
growth-13.6 percent in 1987. Strong demand for 
Hong Kong products in overseas markets as well as 
the price competitiveness of the territory's exports 
vis-a-vis most major currencies, except the US dollar, 
accounted for most of the spectacular export perfor-
mance last year. The Hong Kong Consulate predicts 
strong growth in 1988?between 7 and 10 percent?
barring any major downturns in world markets. 
On the negative side, Hong Kong faces rising labor 
shortages. According to Hong Kong press, there are 
more than 150,000 vacancies in the construction, 
manufacturing, restaurant, and hotel industries. Al-
though many manufacturers have moved their opera-
tions to southern China to take advantage of surplus 
labor, others cannot. For example, garment manufac-
turers cite country-of-origin restrictions as an obsta-
cle to moving across the border, and construction, 
restaurants, and hotels need labor inside the territo-
ry. Some industries are pushing the government to 
import labor from China, a move the government is 
considering in addition to allowing some of the 
Vietnamese refugees in closed camps to work. Emi-
gration by professionals also is aggravating the short-
age of personnel in midlevel positions. The labor 
shortage is pushing up wage and salary levels and 
contributing, along with higher import prices, to 
inflation. 
The boom in China's trade with Hong Kong, especial-
ly in the last two years, is mainly attributable to the 
rapid growth of export-processing industries in the 
Pearl River Delta area in Guangdong Province. Most 
of the products processed there are exported via Hong 
Kong and, according to Chinese press, some 20 
percent of Hong Kong's smaller industrial enterprises 
have economic ties to the area. Many Hong Kong

Guangdong to take advantage of lower labor costs and

wealthy Hong Kong businessmen are even investing 
large sums in the area's infrastructure. For example,

cal journal Seeking Truth,2 Xu Jiatun, the head of the 
New China News Agency (NCNA)?Beijing's de 
facto diplomatic representative in Hong Kong?urged

The Clouds on the Horizon 
The longer term prospects for stability in Hong Kong, 
nonetheless, remain uncertain. Although we have no 
firm figures on the amount of investment in Hong 
Kong, many 
companies are hedging their bets by investing only in 
projects that provide a quick (four-to-five-year) re-
turn. He asserts that few companies are investing in 
long-term capital intensive and high-tech industries 
essential for Hong Kong to retain a competitive 
position in the international marketplace in a decade. 
many of Hong 
Kong's largest companies will be making important 
investment decisions in the early-to-middle 1990s that 
will have a critical impact on the city's economy 
beyond 1997. We believe these decisions will be 
strongly influenced by the steps Beijing and London 
take in the next year or two to convince the business 
community that the territory can remain profitable. 
Among the factors businessmen insist must be re-
tained to preserve Hong Kong's attraction are: 
? Low tax rates. 
? Convenient transportation and sophisticated 
communications. 
? Easy access to capital and financial services. 
? Beneficial profit-remittance policies. 
? Large pool of skilled labor

Requests for Certificates of No Criminal Conviction 
- Hong Kong Government Estimate of Emigration 
a Although the Hong Kong Government does not keep official 
statistics on emigration, the steady rise in requests for certificates of 
no criminal conviction?a prerequisite for applying to emigrate ? 
indicates emigration from Hong Kong is climbing. We believe the 
actual number of people leaving Hong Kong is higher than 
,government estimates but somewhat lower than the number of 
certificates issued.

Hong Kong is already suffering a brain drain as many 
people, distrustful of Chinese promises of autonomy, 
have begun to leave. The Hong Kong Government 
estimates that more than 27,000 people left Hong 
Kong last year, many of them midlevel managers and 
professionals, and that more than 40,000 may leave 
this year. Some companies, unable to replace their 
managers, are pulling out. Union Carbide recently

announced plans to move its regional headquarters to 
Singapore because of increasing difficulty retaining 
local senior staff. Other companies have indicated 
privately they are weighing the advantages and disad-
vantages of remaining in Hong Kong. 
The banking industry probably has been hardest hit. 
One major US bank and the Bank of Tokyo each lost 
25 percent of their employees last year, according to 
Hong Kong Consulate reporting, and several smaller 
banks reported staff turnovers as high as 50 percent. 
A continuation of this trend could eventually force 
some banks to streamline operations or relocate some 
activities to other countries in the region. The Banque 
Nationale de Paris already closed one of its profitable 
branches after it was unable to find replacements for 
managers who emigrated. 
The Hong Kong civil service could also be seriously 
affected if the brain drain continues, although the 
Hong Kong Government denies any problems. One 
senior official asserted that the government's localiza-
tion program?a policy to replace expatriate person-
nel with Hong Kong Chinese?is faltering because of 
a shortage of qualified locals: according to figures 
from Hong Kong's Census and Statistics Department, 
there were more than 7,500 vacancies at the end of 
1987. Hong Kong police force officials also acknowl-
edge that they may face a manpower shortage be-
cause of the difficulty in recruiting overseas and a 
preference among local people to work in private 
companies, which offer more opportunity to emigrate. 
In the last two years Hong Kong's fire department 
also reportedly lost 10 percent of its officials?all 
ethnic Chinese who emigrated. 
In May Hong Kong announced the formation of a 
task force to study the problem and to improve the 
gathering of emigration statistics. According to the 
US Consulate in Hong Kong, a group of Hong Kong 
businessmen have also commissioned a firm to con-
duct a yearlong study of the economic problems 
confronting the territory, including emigration. Given 
the potential problems that continued emigration may 
create for both the government and businesses, the 
Hong Kong Government is investigating ways to 
coordinate programs with the private sector to induce 
Hong Kong professionals to stay or return to the 
7 
territory. Whatever the findings, senior Hong Kong 
Government officials have repeatedly stressed they 
will not try to stop emigration by means  of controls or 
by exerting pressure on other countries. 
The Challenge for the Chinese 
How constructively Beijing deals over the next three 
to five years with business and public concerns will, in 
our judgment, have an important impact on Hong 
Kong's long-term outlook. Although the Chinese have 
shown increased flexibility and adeptness, many peo-
ple continue to believe that Beijing could renege after 
1997 on whatever promises it makes now, according 
to a recent Hong Kong poll. Chinese willingness under 
the Basic Law to ensure the independence of the local 
judiciary, to incorporate concrete guarantees of civil 
liberties, and to allow Hong Kong citizens to maintain 
dual nationality could allay the fears of many of Hong 
Kong's large middle class. Whether Beijing is pre-
pared to make such concessions should become appar-
ent once a revised version of the Basic Law is 
resubmitted for public scrutiny sometime in 1989. 
The Basic Law Drafting Committee (BLDC) is slated 
to reconvene in January 1989 to make revisions in the 
draft based on the summer  1988 public consultations. 
Much of the criticism has focused on the lack of 
adequate guarantees to protect basic civil liberties and 
to prevent Beijing from arbitrarily interfering in Hong 
Kong's affairs. Prodemocratic groups have been par-
ticularly critical of the options set forth for selecting 
the future Special Administrative Region govern-
ment. Although Beijing has not stated a preference 
publicly, the "Group of 88"?a group of conservative 
businessmen, many of whom were appointed to the 
BLCC by Beijing?favor a proposal to establish an 
electoral college to select the chief executive and a 
portion of the legislature. Liberal groups oppose such 
a body because they fear China would try to manipu-
late and control its members. 
We believe Beijing also must do more to dampen fears 
that its growing political and economic influence in 
the colony will undermine Hong Kong's autonomy. In

Prodemocracy Pressure Groups: Nascent Political 
Parties? 
Although Hong Kong does not have any official 
political parties, in the last few years a number of 
political pressure groups have formed to push for 
democratic reforms and were behind a signature 
campaign last fall to garner support for direct elec-
tions to Hong Kong's legislature this year. Despite 
such efforts, these groups were unable to exert much 
pressure on the Hong Kong Government to reverse its 
decision to postpone direct elections until 1991. Three 
of the most influential prodemocracy groups?Meet-
ing Point, the Hong Kong Affairs Society, and the 
Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People's 
Livelihood?had more success when they banded 
together to support each other's candidates for Dis-
trict Board seats in March 1988. The US Consulate 
in Hong Kong estimates that out of 264 available 
seats on the District Boards, about 61 core members 
of the democratic alliance and perhaps an additional 
30 to 40 sympathizers won seats. 
Not tied to any particular group but probably the 
best known supporter of democratic reforms is Legis-
lative Councilor Martin Lee. Lee, also a member of 
both the BLDC and the BLCC, has been outspoken in 
his support for direct elections. Lee led a delegation 
of democratic group leaders to London last December 
to lobby the British Government to support direct 
elections in 1988 and also visited the United States 
last spring seeking US support for democratic change 
in the territory 
Since the release of the draft of the Basic Law, the 
pressure group Meeting Point has led a coalition 
known as the Group of 190 in a fight against a 
proposal made by conservative Hong Kong business-
men to form an electoral college to select the first 
government of Hong Kong after 1997. The conserva-
tives have formed their own pressure group called the 
"Group of 88," which does not want to see the 
introduction of party politics into ,Hong Kong. They 
fear this will cause instability and place power in the 
hands of those who would increase taxes and social 
and welfare services, thereby cutting into their prof-
its. Ironically, this stance against political reforms by 
many of Hong Kong's richest elites has made them 
allies with Beijing

Key Issues in the Basic Law 
Critics have cited clauses in the draft of the Basic 
Law that they believe violate the principles of the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration or are worded so 
vaguely that they fear Beijing may twist the meanin 
Among the problems are the following issues. 
Interpretation of the Basic Law. The draft gives the 
Standing Committee of China's National People's 
Congress the power to interpret the Basic Law and to 
review laws enacted by the future Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region (SAR). Critics argue that this 
takes away Hong Kong's judicial independence?the 
Joint Declaration stipulated that Hong Kong would 
have the final court of appeal. They are calling for 
drafters to qualify the Standing Committee's power 
and outline the procedures for proposing amendments 
to the Basic Law to include consultation with Hong 
Kong's chief executive, legislature, and a Basic Law 
committee. 
Formation of the First SAR Government. The Joint 
Declaration was vague on the details of the political 
structure and the formation of the first SAR govern-
ment, and the Basic Law draft does little clarifying. 
The draft presents a series of options for selecting the 
first chief executive and legislature (see figure 7). 
Some critics say the inclusion of several different 
options for the selection of the SAR 's government 
may allow Beijing to manipulate public opinion. 
London has advocated a transitional government 
allowing those Legco members elected before 1997 to 
serve out their terms, but Beijing believes the reten-
tion of officials who served under the British would 
impinge on its sovereignty 
Political and Civil Rights. Critics fear the stipula-
tion in the draft that the SAR shall prohibit by law 
any act designed to undermine national unity or 
subvert the Central People's Government is too vague 
and provides inadequate safeguards for individual 
freedoms. Both Legco and Amnesty International 
have suggested that drafters remodel the guarantees 
of civil rights in the draft after two UN international 
convenants on international human rights standards. 
Economic Policies. Critics assert the draft of the 
Basic Law goes too far by constitutionalizing micro-
level economic policies?such as proscribing a low 
tax policy and balanced budget. Governor Wilson 
criticized these provisions in a speech before British 
businessmen in London in June, stating they "would 
limit the flexibility of the Hong Kong SAR and 
would tend to restrict the autonomy promised in the 
Joint Declaration." Sources of the Hong Kong Con-
sulate suggest that these provisions may have been 
inspired by influential Hong Kong business elites and 
that ranking Chinese members of the BLDC also 
believe them unnecessarily restrictive. 
Dual Nationality. Legco and local groups are press-
ing for Chinese recognition of dual nationality and 
for provisions in the draft allowing dual nationals to 
serve in senior government positions in the SAR. 
They believe the stipulation giving only permanent 
residents of the SAR the right to vote, stand for 
election, and hold senior government posts will deny 
a stake to foreign nationals and Hong Kong Chinese 
holding other passports?and may discourage those 
now emigrating from Hong Kong from returning. 
Official English Version. Although Beijing has said 
there will be an official English version of the Basic 
Law, Chinese officials have said that the Chinese 
version will be used in any disputes. Many believe 
that an authoritative English version of the Basic 
Law is needed to preserve Hong Kong's international 
business status and its legal system based on English 
common law. 
Basic Law Committee. Controversy also surrounds 
the formation, members, and status of the Basic Law 
committee after 1997. The committee is to be the key 
advisory body to the National People's Congress 
Standing Committee on crucial Basic Law issues.

July 1988, as stipulated by the 1984 Joint Declara-
tion, both the British and Chinese teams of the Joint 
Liaison Group established permanent offices in the 
territory. Added to the NCNA office?often regarded 
as a shadow government?this new Chinese office 
greatly increased Beijing's official presence. British 
team officials told US Consulate officers that their 
Chinese counterparts have shown a keen interest in 
monitoring the activities of the Hong Kong Govern-
ment, and the British worry that perceived interfer-
ence by the Chinese may affect local confidence. The 
presence of the new Chinese team office may also 
result in conflicts between the different Chinese bod-
ies involved in implementing Beijing's Hong Kong  
policies (see appendix A). 
Beijing's attempts to manipulate events also contrib-
ute to doubts about Chinese sincerity. Chinese cadres, 
through "united front work," have sought to use the 
press, labor unions, and prominent figures to influence 
public opinion on political reform and the Basic Law: 
? We believe Beijing manipulated the results of the 
Hong Kong Government's political reform survey 
last fall by encouraging its organizations in Hong 
Kong to oppose direct elections. The US Consulate 
in Hong Kong, for example, obtained a form that 
the pro-Beijing Federation of Trade Unions circu-
lated to its members to sign opposing direct 
elections. 
? NCNA Hong Kong has been fairly successful in 
intimidating local newspapers?according to Hong 
Kong Consulate reporting, Hong Kong papers en-
gage in increasing self-censorship. NCNA officials 
also meet with local newspaper owners to influence 
editorial lines, and even 
indirectly pay subsidies to some editors. 
? We believe Beijing is encouraging leftist trade 
unions to take on a larger role in Hong Kong politics 
by establishing additional unions to increase their 
representation on the Labor Advisory Board and the 
11 
Legislative Council.' Beijing also plans to set up 
ostensibly neutral labor unions for those who are 
sensitive about associating with pro-Beijing trade 
unions. 
? We believe Beijing also has co-opted selected Hong 
Kong businessmen by appointing them to the Na-
tional People's Congress, the Chinese People's Polit-
ical Consultative Conference, the BLDC, and the  
BLCC. 
25X1 
  25X1 
Even more disturbing to some businessmen has been 25X1 
the explosion of ministerial, provincial, and individ-
ually owned mainland companies in Hong Kong. 
These are proliferating so fast we believe Beijing has 
lost control over them, prompting Hong Kong busi-
nessmen to complain that these companies are taking 
advantage of their Chinese financial backing to drive 
them out of business. Some Western and local bank-
ers also are concerned about the quality of loans made 
by the Chinese banks in Hong Kong in the manufac-
turing and other sectors, according to Hong Kong 
Consulate reporting. Companies claiming affiliations 
with China have gained financial support in spite of 
their sometimes unimpressive financial performance 
and limited equity 
In an apparent reponse to the growing criticism, Xu 
Jiatun announced on 10 June that the NCNA Hong 
Kong's economic department is investigating China-
backed firms. On 15 June, Lu Ping, the Secretary of 
the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs 
Office, speaking to local and foreign businessmen in 
Hong Kong, also said Beijing would instruct its

unions have not played a major political or economic role in Hong 
Kong, the board is viewed as a steppingstone for politically oriented 
labor leaders seeking one of the two seats reserved for labor on 
Legco. Both the four union board representatives and the two Legco 
seats are elected on a one-union/one-vote basis.

on corruption on the mainland is also spilling over into 
Hong Kong. 
Looking Toward 1997 
We believe Hong Kong will retain an appearance of 
business as usual at least through the early 1990s. 
Because most Hong Kong?based businesses believe

there is still time to make money before the territory 
reverts to China, we expect the economy to continue 
to do well. Some Hong Kong Chinese businessmen, 
who have invested heavily on the mainland, probably 
have decided to stay. But we suspect that many more 
companies remain undecided and will continue to 
hedge their bets by investing mainly in projects 
promising a fast turnaround on their money so they 
can pull out quickly if they judge that the costs and 
risks of remaining outweigh the advantages

Beijing will probably offer inducements to firms to 
stay and will take disciplinary action against some 
companies to demonstrate its commitment to free 
competition. Similarly, we expect Beijing to try to 
keep the emigration of critically needed professionals 
and technicians within manageable limits by accom-
modating at least some key concerns over the Basic 
Law. London, in turn, probably will try to bolster 
confidence by promoting large economic projects such 
as a new airport and improved port facilities. 
the depth of distrust of China in Hong Kong. It is 
clear that halfhearted Chinese confidence-building 
measures will worsen the brain drain, undercutting 
Hong Kong's ability to provide the financial, commu-
nications, and transportation services that make it an 
attractive international financial center and forcing 
many companies to relocate by the mid-1990s 
Events in China also will heavily influence the busi-
ness climate in Hong Kong. We believe Hong Kong 
businessmen will be closely watching whether the 
Chinese leadership's decision to shelve price reform 
represents a retreat from market reforms or only a 
temporary pause to get the mainland economy under 
better control. A continued strong commitment to the 
open door and market reforms would be reassuring. A 
clear loss of reform momentum or, worse, a reversal of 
some key reform policies would in our judgment 
reinforce deep-seated doubts about the constancy of  
Beijing's policy toward the territory. 
Finally, a smooth transfer of power from Deng Xiao-
ping?almost inevitable by the early 1990s?will be 
important. As the architect of the "one country?two 
system" formula, Deng is regarded by many in Hong 
Kong as the guarantor of their future. It will be 
Deng's successor?General Secretary Zhao Ziyang or 
someone else?who will have to demonstrate that he 
can and will abide by Beijing's commitment to the 
1984 accord and Deng's promise to maintain Hong 
Kong's social and economic systems for at least the 
next 50 years. 
Nonetheless, we doubt that the key imponderables in 
Hong Kong's longer term outlook will become clearer 
soon. For example, we cannot predict how far Beijing 
is prepared to go in granting local autonomy or even 
whether such efforts will make much difference given

Beijing's Groups Overseeing 
Hong Kong Policies 
Our information on China's decisionmaking processes 
and implementation of policies toward Hong Kong is 
sketchy. Beijing deliberately keeps the profile of the 
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Hong Kong low 
to avoid heightening suspicions of China's intentions. 
Although the official cadre presence in Hong Kong 
continues to grow and is estimated to be over 5,000, 
much of the workings of the party and government 
offices remains shrouded, in contrast to the o en 
proliferation of Chinese economic entities. 
Almost all of China's major policy decisions are made 
by small "leading groups" of top CCP officials. 
According to sources of one Hong Kong paper, the 
CCP group on Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau is 
headed by Chinese President Yang Shangkun, who 
has "an overriding say" in decisions affecting the 
territory. Deng Xiaoping reportedly is the only higher 
authority; State Council Hong Kong and Macau 
Affairs Office Director Ji Pengfei and Xu Jiatun, 
head of the New China News Agency's Hong Kong 
office, also belong to this group 
We believe NCNA Director Xu Jiatun, whose state-
ments and actions in the territory have earned him the 
nickname of Hong Kong's "shadow governor," is 
primarily responsible for carrying out Beijing's poli-
cies. NCNA Hong Kong acts both as a news agency 
and as a channel for handling diplomatic and com-
mercial matters between the Hong Kong Government 
and Beijing, and even occasionally deals with coun-
tries without formal diplomatic ties to China such as 
South Korea. In 1985, Xu reorganized NCNA along 
the lines of government departments, giving it the 
appearance of a shadow government. We believe that 
NCNA officials are expanding their contacts at all 
levels in Hong Kong 
Because Xu also heads the Hong Kong Macau Work 
Committee?the central body of the CCP in Hong 
Kong?the distinction between NCNA and the com-
mittee is easily blurred. Members of the committee 
Reverse Blank 15 
include key NCNA officials and leaders of the major 
Chinese organizations in Hong Kong such as China 
Resources, the Bank of China, and the China Mer-
chants Steam Navigation Company, as well as repre-
sentatives from pro-Beijing labor, media, and educa-
tion entities. The committee engages heavily in united 
front work in education, political, labor, and media 
circles?probably often under the cover of NCNA. It 
is also a conduit for passing guidance from Beijing to 
the party apparatus of Chinese organizations in Hong 25X1 
Kong 25X1 
NCNA Hong Kong is subordinate to China's State 
Council, which has its own organization dealing with 
Hong Kong affairs. Veteran CCP official and former 
Foreign Minister Ji Pengfei heads the Council's Hong 
Kong and Macau Affairs Office. In 1985 the office 
set up the Hong Kong and Macau Research Institute, 
a think tank to provide Chinese leaders with back-
ground on a wide range of issues for working out 
policies in Hong Kong and Macau. Also in 1985, 
Beijing established a second Hong Kong and Macau 25X1 
Affairs Office, but this one is directly subordinate to 
the Foreign Ministry and headed by Ke Zaishuo?
also the leader of the Chinese Joint Liaison Group 
team. Although there is little information to allow us 
to differentiate between the duties and functions of 
the two Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Offices, we 
believe the State Council is more concerned with 
policymaking and direction and probably relegates 
the handling of day-to-day matters involving the Joint 
Liaison Group and various subcommittees concerned 
with the drafting of the Basic Law to the Foreign 
Ministry office. 25X1

Appendix B 
The Evolution of Chinese 
Companies in Hong Kong 
Since China embarked on its reform program in 1979, 
the number and types of Chinese companies in Hong 
Kong have rapidly expanded. From a few long-
established state-controlled companies?China Re-
sources Company, the Bank of China, China Mer-
chants and Steam Navigation Company, and the 
China Travel Service?China's economic presence in 
Hong Kong has grown to include organizations repre-
senting national, provincial, municipal, military, and 
private interests numbering between 2,000 and 4,000, 
according to press and Hong Kong Consulate report-
ing. The growth of these companies has not been 
systematic, and many details about their missions, 
organizations, lines of authority, and even numbers 
remain unknown. 
Among the largest Chinese organizations in Hong 
Kong are: 
? China Resources Company. Before 1980, almost all 
of China's trade through Hong Kong was controlled 
by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and 
Trade (MOFERT) through the China Resources 
Company (CRC). CRC enjoys the position of "big 
brother" among Chinese commercial entities and 
the well-established wholesalers and retailers in 
Hong Kong. In the last few years, because of 
increased competition from provincial and munici-
pal trade companies, CRC has diversified into other 
areas, including property, banking, transportation, 
packaging, and activities to facilitate technology 
transfer. CRC now operates chains of restaurants, 
retail shops, and supermarkets in Hong Kong. 
? The Bank of China Group. The Bank of China is 
the leading bank in the Bank of China Group 
(BOCG), which includes 13 sister banks and has a 
near monopoly on China trade financing in Hong 
Kong. These banks also hold the major share of 
small local deposits in Hong Kong and are second 
only to the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank in total 
deposits. Between 1980 and 1985, the BOCG in-
creased its capital by 1,000 percent, raised its loan 
17 
portfolio by 600 percent, and now has some 265 
branch banks. In 1986 loans to the local manufac-
turing sector grew by 25 percent, while loans to 
China-related businesses increased by 50 percent. 
Little information is available concerning the quali-
ty of the BOCG's loan portfolio, but some Western 
and local bankers question some of BOCG's prac-
tices. CRC joined with the Bank of China to buy a 
35-percent share of Conic, a loosely structured 
conglomerate of Hong Kong electronics firms, in a 
disastrous bailout in 1984. They have sunk an 
additional $141 million into the company. 
? China Merchants Steamship Navigation Company. 
Owned by China's Ministry of Communications, the 25X1 
China Merchants Steamship Navigation Company 
(CMSN) has taken advantage of the gradual 
changes in China's foreign trade system under 
economic reform. In 1979, Beijing granted CMSN 
a large measure of autonomy and approved a new 
development strategy that encouraged the company 
to diversify. In 1985, CMSN acquired one-quarter 
of the troubled Far East Bank and, the following 
year, a controlling share of the Union Bank of Hong 
Kong. CMSN set up the Shekou industrial zone in 
Shenzhen and then established the China Mer-
chants Bank in the zone in 1986. CMSN has also 
expanded into construction, engineering, and off-
shore oil-related industries. 
? The China International Trust and Investment 
Corporation. Rong Yiren, known as China's red 
capitalist, formed the China International Trust and 
Investment Corporation (CITIC) in 1979 primarily 
to attract foreign investment and technology into 
China. CITIC has the status of a government 
ministry and the authority to make its own business 
decisions and is accountable for its profits and 
losses. In May 1987, CITIC consolidated its invest-
ment in Hong Kong and set up a holding company

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/01/02 : CIA-RDP89T01448R000400470002-3 
named CITIC Hong Kong (Holdings) Ltd. CITIC 
Hong Kong has invested in finance, industry, trad-
ing, real estate, public utilities, aviation, and ship-
ping, as well as industrial projects and power 
stations in China, and is involved in joint ventures 
in both Hong Kong and China. In 1986, CITIC 
bought out the ailing Ka Wah Bank, and in 1987 it 
purchased 12.5 percent of Cathay Pacific Airways, 
the territory's main airline. CITIC is also using its 
Hong Kong office to develop trade with Taiwan and 
South Korea. 
? China Everbright Holdings Company. Everbright 
was established in 1983 to make well-publicized 
Chinese investments in Hong Kong and to attract 
foreign investment to China. Beijing has been disap-
pointed in the performance of both the company and 
its chairman, Wang Guangying, however. In 1984, 
Everbright was involved in a highly embarrassing 
real estate deal that became the subject of an 
official Hong Kong Government inquiry, and Ever-
bright apparently lost heavily in speculative trading 
when the Hong Kong stock market crashed in 
October 1987. 
With the partial decentralization of China's foreign 
trade system in late 1979, MOFERT and the CRC 
began to lose their monopoly over Hong Kong?China 
trade. Many provincial and municipal governments, 
Secret 
as well as some central departments, set up represen-
tative trade offices in Hong Kong. Among these new 
offices, Guangdong and Fujian Province's representa-
tives expanded the most rapidly because of their 
proximity to Hong Kong and numerous overseas 
Chinese ties. Almost every province and each of 
China's four Special Economic Zones and the 14 
coastal cities have established offices under the au-
thority of their respective governments 
Finally, there are hundreds of other Chinese compa-
nies operating in Hong Kong without official authori-
zation. Many of these entities are "shell companies," 
set up by Chinese organizations in Hong Kong to 
invest in China as foreign investors?thereby obtain-
ing special benefits granted to foreign-invested enter-
prises in China. Other entities in Hong Kong are there 
at the initiative of family groups or private interests, 
usually to make a quick buck. Still other companies 
are not readily identifiable as Chinese connected and 
focus on indirect trade with Taiwan or South Korea, 
facilitating China's acquisition of restricted technol-
ogy, or serving as middlemen in arms transfers
