 FAR EAST
 The Communist "winter-spring campaign" in
 South Vietnam focused last week on the western
 highland provinces of Darlac and Kontum.   The
 willingness of Communist commanders to take heavy
 losses in actions around Dak To underscores their
 aim of drawing in and tying down major allied forces
 in order to relieve pressure on Communist posi-
 tions in coastal areas and the delta.   This objec-
 tive was also reflected in Hanoi propaganda claims
 that US forces have lost the initiative in the
 highlands and have been forced into a "passive
 posture" throughout South Vietnam.
 In Saigon,  Prime Minister Nguyen Van Loc an-
 nounced a cabinet that is dominated by generals
 and holdovers from the Ky government.   Although
 the new cabinet is balanced regionally and re-
 ligiously, only a few members have been chosen on
 essentially political grounds and most appear to
 be competent technicians or experienced adminis-
 trators.
 Efforts to unite rival Red Guard factions in
 China are making little progress and disorder is
 spreading again.   Although the level of violence
 remains well below that of last summer, militant
 groups have been emboldened to defy appeals to
 end disorder and the military is again displaying
 some hesitation in dealing with factional conflicts.
 The Chinese press continues to voice implied sup-
 port for the militants and to greet the growing
 violence as a "great victory"  for the Cultural
 Revolution.
 A rice shortage in Indonesia and the conse-
 quent rise in prices threaten to develop into a
 major political problem for the Suharto regime.
 Student organizations have seized upon the issue to
 renew demonstrations against corruption and in-
 efficiency in the government.

 SECRI."I'
 V I ETNAM
 Communist main force units,
 supported by local Viet Cong ele-
 ments, have launched an ambitious
 "winter-spring campaign" in South
 Vietnam's western highlands. Since
 the campaign began early this
 month, the enemy has staged a se-
 ries of large-scale assaults,  am-
 bushes, and heavy mortar barrages
 on US and South Vietnamese posi-
 tions from southern Darlac Prov-
 ince to central Kontum Province.
 The focus of this  activity
 has been the area around Dak To,
 where at least five North Vietnam-
 ese regiments--some 7,000 men--
 are currently deployed.   US and
 South Vietnamese forces counter-
 ing the Communist threat in this
 area now total more than 9,000
 men, including 12 battalions and
 their respective headquarters units.
 Enemy losses thus  far in the
 campaign around Dak To have been
 extremely high and will undoubt-
 edly affect the efficiency of fu-
 ture efforts.  Since the current
 fighting began on 3 November,
 more than 600 enemy soldiers have
 been killed in contrast to
 friendly casualties of 102 killed
 and 533 wounded.   The Communist
 forces nevertheless possess the
 manpower and heavy weapons, pos-
 sibly including rocket forces, to
 mount additional large-scale ac-
 tions.
 The enemy strategy evidently
 also includes maintaining pressure
 on allied units in Pleiku and Dar-
 lac provinces.   The North Vietnam-
 ese 95B Regiment, which has been
 recently reinforced,  remains ac-
 tive in western Pleiku.   Small
 unit attacks, probes, and shell-
 ings are expected against some
 of the more lucrative allied tar-
 gets in the area.   Elements of
 the North Vietnamese 33rd Regi-
 ment have been involved in sev-
 eral mortar attacks on US posi-
 tions near Ban Me Thuot.
 According to a recently cap-
 tured enemy document, Communist
 plans for the "winter-spring" of-
 fensive in the highlands call for
 large-scale maneuvers designed
 to draw in and tie down large
 numbers of allied. troops, thus
 relieving to some extent allied
 pressure in the coastal areas.
 The highlands campaign has ap-
 parently also been coordinated
 with recent intensive enemy ef-
 forts farther south in northern
 III Corps.
 For the present, however, a
 lull in activity in northern III
 Corps continues.   Some of the Com-
 munist forces in northern Binh
 Long and Phuoc Long provinces are
 regrouping, while others are con-
 tinuing to prepare for future of-
 fensive  activities.   Elements of
 the Viet Cong 9th Division, which
 apparently took heavy losses in
 the recent fighting around Loc
 Ninh, have moved northward to
 positions near the Cambodian bor-
 der.   Elements of two North Viet-
 namese regiments are just south
 of Song Be.   They have been noted
 making battle preparations, in-
 cluding the construction of de-
 fensive positions and, possibly,
 the preparation of 140-mm.  rocket

 Political Developments
 In South Vietnam
 Prime Minister Nguyen Van
 Loc announced the formation of the
 new cabinet on 9 November.   Nine
 of its 17 ministers served in the
 previous cabinet.   The key minis-
 tries--defense, interior, foreign
 affairs,  revolutionary development,
 and economy--are headed either by
 generals or by holdovers from the
 Ky government.
 Although the new cabinet is
 balanced regionally and reli-
 giously, only a few of the appoint-
 ees have been chosen on essen-
 tially political grounds.   Rather,
 most appear to be competent tech-
 nicians or experienced administra-
 tors.   The appointments therefore
 largely confirm earlier statements

 of President Thieu that cabinet
 members would be selected on the
 basis of competence and ability
 to work together.
 The recently elected lower
 house of the National Assembly
 held its first working session on
 8 November.   Nguyen Ba Luong was
 named acting chairman and Duong
 Van Ba acting secretary general.
 Luong has since announced he will
 be a candidate for the permanent
 chairmanship of the lower house.
 His principal rival for that post
 probably will be Ho Huu Tuong,  a
 prominent Buddhist layman identi-
 fied with the militant Buddhist
 faction.   The government is opposed
 to Tuong's candidacy,  and is re-
 portedly attempting to organize
 opposition to it.
 The upper house,       continuing
 to work on its internal organiza-
 tion, has decided to create 12
 standing committees to deal with
 legislative matters and its own
 internal affairs.   The senators
 decided not to create a position
 of secretary general, principally
 because they did not want so
 much power vested in one man.   In-
 stead,  a five- to ten-man internal
 affairs and rules committee will
 probably act as the regulatory
 body for such matters as control-
 ling the agenda and ruling on                     leg-
 islative  procedures.
 Political maneuvering in the
 legislature, apart from the com-
 petition for assembly offices,
 presently centers on efforts to
 create political blocs in the
 lower house.   Although there are
 reports that religious and other
 groups are endeavoring to form
 blocs that would give them politi-
 ical leverage,  the most success-
 ful effort to date appears to be
 that of the government in launch-
 ing the Democratic Bloc, with pos-
 sibly as many as 50 members.
 The Democratic Bloc, being
 promoted by Ky and other top lead-
 ers, will reportedly assume a
 strong progovernment stance in the
 lower house and will support Ngu-
 yen Ba Luong's bid to become chair-
 man of that body.   Luong will be
 the nominal head of the bloc, but
 the actual leadership will be
 vested in Representative Le Tai
 Hoa, reportedly at Ky's request.
 Ho Chi Minh Possibly Ailing
 Ho
 was  "very weak" an  was confined

 to bed when the Soviet ambassador
 invited him to the celebrations
 in Moscow.   The 77-year-old leader,
 moreover, has made no public ap-
 pearances since North Vietnam's
 national day celebrations in late
 August.
 Despite his inactivity and
 apparent aloofness from the po-
 litical scene,  there has been no
 indication that his subordinates
 have had difficulty in running
 the country without his immediate
 leadership and direction.   The
 evidence suggests that the re-
 gime's major policies--particu-
 larly on strategy for the war and
 on possible peace negotiations--
 have been the result of collec-
 tive decision-making.

 NORTH VIETNAM'S SHIPPING PROBLEMS GROW
 North Vietnam's port opera-
 tions continue to be hampered by
 cargo handling difficulties.   Es-
 sential needs are being met, how-
 ever,  and in recent months port
 congestion has been somewhat eased.
 Imports by sea in the first
 half of this year reached a record
 high average of about 128,000 tons
 per month.   This placed heavy de-
 mands on port facilities, partic-
 ularly   at Haiphong.   Ships had
 to wait days before starting to
 unload and cargo began to pile up
 on the docks.   By August, turna-
 round time for ships was averag-
 ing more than 30 days.
 Since then, however, imports
 by sea have been cut back and con-
 gestion has eased.   In October,
 only about 90,000 tons were un-
 loaded and the average turnaround
 time dropped to 19 days.   This was
 still higher, however, than in
 1966 when the average turnaround
 time was only 13 days.
 Silting in the main channel
 into Haiphong also creates prob-
 lems and most ships must now en-
 ter the harbor at high tide.   Those
 drawing as much as 26 feet of
 water have been forced to wait
 ten days or more for a high enough
 tide.
 The average load per ship is
 now being reduced--possibly to
 permit entry to the harbor at any
 high tide.   In some recent cases,
 small Soviet ships carrying flour
 have been diverted to other ports
 to ease the strain at Haiphong.
 Bomb damage to key bridges
 in the Haiphong area has made the
 moving of goods through the port
 area increasingly difficult and
 time consuming.   Pontoon bridges,
 ferries, and the intensified use
 of inland waterways, however,
 have minimized the disruption to
 the transport system.   In addition,
 frequent air raid alerts, espe-
 cially at Haiphong, cut consid-
 erably into working time at the
 docks.
 Despite these problems, North
 Vietnam continues to import es-
 sential nonmilitary goods by sea.
 Bulk foodstuffs accounted for over
 65 percent of October's imports
 and petroleum totaled another 13
 percent.   The North Vietnamese
 should be able to maintain the
 present level of cargo arrivals.
 Instead of using Haiphong,
 cargo from incoming ships can be
 loaded into barges at the many
 island anchorages in the Gulf
 of Tonkin.   This has been done in
 the past with tankers but prob-
 ably would be done on a large
 scale only as a last resort be-
 cause barges shuttling to and
 from the mainland would be highly
 vulnerable to air attacks.

 CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE CONTINUES TO TROUBLE CHINA
 Peking's attempts to unite ri-
 val Red Guard factions appear to be
 z-unning into trouble,  and clashes
 between opposing groups are increas-
 ing.   Although the level of violence
 ,still remains well below that of
 last summer,  it has again begun to
 affect China's transportation net-
 work.   The disorders, which never en--
 i_irely ceased in September and Oc-
 tober, now seem to be spreading,
 .both in long-troubled areas of west
 China and in the east.
 Militants in Peking have given
 ~.o clear sign to the radical Red
 Guards to resume "revolutionary"
 activity, but the leftists appear
 to be ignoring appeals for calm and
 order, and the army seems unwilling
 or unable to deal effectively with
 the growing civil disobedience and
 :anarchy.   The military continues to
 intervene in many cases once out-

 PEKING CONTINUES MODERATE STANCE TOWARD HONG KONG
 The Chinese Communists are
 continuing their efforts to re-
 strain the more militant elements
 in the Hong Kong apparatus and to
 direct the confrontation with the
 British into channels that will
 not seriously injure China's eco-
 nomic interests in the colony.
 Recent talks between leading
 Hong Kong Communists and Chinese
 authorities in Canton were prob-
 ably aimed at ensuring that the
 Hong Kong Communists did nothing
 to mar the current trade fair in
 Canton and to explore ways of ex-
 panding Communist earnings in the
 colony.
 The Hong Kong mainland border
 has been relatively quiet as ne-
 gotiations between the Chinese
 Communist and British authorities
 continue.   According to local
 Communist press reports, the
 principal issues under discus-
 sion are the reopening of a
 border crossing and the return
 of three Hong Kong policemen,
 including one British inspector,
 and five mainland Chinese.   No
 public announcement has been
 made on the progress of the ne-
 gotiations.
 In Hong Kong, the militant
 Communists are continuing the
 use of genuine and dummy bombs
 in their campaign to erode Brit-
 ish authority.   They are becom-
 ing more selective in choosing
 targets, however,  and are employ-
 ing more powerful and sophisti-
 cated devices.     Last week, an
 apparent sabotage attempt was
 made against a road and tunnel
 complex.   The use of dummy bombs
 places a maximum burden on the
 police while avoiding adverse
 public reaction to civilian cas-
 ualties.                                                                             At the same time,  the
 militants are stepping up their
 propaganda in labor unions and
 schools to win public support in
 a long-term campaign a ainst the
 colonial government.

 INDONESIA:      RICE AND POLITICS
 Indonesia's current rice
 shortage and spiraling prices may
 become a major political problem
 for the Suharto regime.   Although
 imports will provide some relief,
 the scarcity--aggravated by poor
 distribution--will persist and
 prices probably will continue to
 rise until the next harvest in
 late March.   In some areas the
 price has already gone up 50 per-
 cent..
 Rice represents more than
 a third of the cost of living
 index in Djakarta and is an im-
 portant determinant of other
 prices.   The Djakarta cost of
 living index is used to judge the
 progress of the national stabili-
 zation effort--the priority task
 of the present regime.   Both the
 government and its critics there-
 fore regard rice as an indirect
 gauge of the success or failure
 not only of the stabilization
 program,  but of the Suharto re-
 gime itself.
 Various political organiza-
 tions are exploiting the rice is-
 sue for their own purposes.   In-
 donesia's university and high
 school student confederations--
 KAMI and KAPPI--have staged a
 series of demonstrations protest-
 ing high prices and corrupt or in-
 efficient officials.   Although they
 may be motivated in part by a de-
 sire to protect the consumer,  the
 students need a popular issue to
 maintain their role as political
 gadfly of the "New Order" and to
 restore some semblance of unity
 in their own ranks.
 The large National Party
 (PNI)--now under heavy pressure
 from Suharto to support the gov-
 ernment or be banned--has hinted
 that it will defend the cabinet on
 the rice issue if the government
 will stop the anti-PNI campaign.
 The rice problem has served to
 bring together such disparate ele-
 ments as the leftist PNI university
 student organization and the anti-
 leftist KA.MI.
 The political problem is
 compounded by indications that
 serious planning errors have
 been made in the rice procurement
 program and that army officers
 have been involved in speculation..
 These circumstances add weight
 to charges of government corrup-
 tion and of Acting President Su-
 harto's reluctance to take forth-
 right action against it.
 Suharto has effectively
 blunted the student demonstrations
 so far.    The persistent shortage,
 however,  combined with failure to
 deal with corruption and with the
 political frustrations of all In-
 donesian civilian groups,  is likely
 to create recurrent and perhaps
 mounting political problems over

 BULGARIA INCREASES CONTACTS WITH NON-COMMUNIST WORLD
 Over the last seven months,
 Bulgaria has consulted with 28
 economic or political delegations
 from various non-Communist coun-
 tries of western Europe and the
 Middle East, and a variety of
 new arrangements has resulted.
 Sofia has signed agreements
 for increased trade with Sweden,
 France,  Italy, Egypt,  the Sudan,
 Syria,   and Iran.   It has entered
 into joint trading companies with
 France and Australia,   and has
 concluded tourist agreements with
 Norway, Austria,  Iraq,  and Egypt.
 Finally,  Sofia has agreed to
 scientific,  technical,  and agri-
 cultural cooperation with Iraq,
 Denmark,  and France.
 'These efforts to get on good
 terms with the non-Communist world
 have been in large part motivated
 by trade problems.   The country's
 hard-currency purchases have re-
 sulted in a cumulative trade def-
 icit with the West of about $350
 million since 1964.   Bulgaria's
 exports to the industrial West
 last year were worth approximately
 $200 million.   The economic pinch
 that has ensued was particularly
 evident at the Plovdiv fair in
 October when Bulgaria was unwill-
 ing to purchase Western industrial
 goods in the quantities some coun-
 tries--notably Britain, France,
 and Belgium--had been led to ex-
 pect.
 In a new departure for Sofia,
 a high-level trade delegation
 headed by the deputy minister of
 foreign trade is scheduled to ar-
 rive in the US next April to begin
 consultations with government and
 business officials.   These meet-
 ings will help overcome the mis-
 conceptions Bulgarian officials
 have harbored in the past about
 free market processes.   The Bul-
 garians hope to reach agreements
 to expand their exports--particu-
 larly of tobaccos and wines--to
 cover the cost of modern industrial
 goods they need to purchase in
 the US.
 Sofia's interest in consulta-
 tions, and its new desire to dis-
 play its products to prospective
 American customers,  attest to the
 regime's growing awareness of the
 importance of developing greater
 flexibility in foreign contacts,
 especially with the US.   The desire
 for increased contacts with the US
 and other non-Communist countries
 also illustrates Bulgarian party
 leader Zhivkov's determination to
 assert Bulgarian national interests
 in new and different wa s.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 Problems in the area continue to smoulder and
 could ignite at any time, as shown by the flare-up
 of fighting on Cyprus this week.
 Israeli troop movements--billed by an Israeli
 Army officer as routine troop rotations--could in-
 crease Arab fears of another retaliatory strike,
 particularly since units in the Syrians heights
 area are involved.   The potential for trouble is
 further heightened by reports that Arab resistance
 organizations on the West Bank of Jordan are plan-
 ning to increase terrorism this month.   Moreover,
 it appears that Israel intends to hold its posi-
 tions along the Suez Canal at least until the Arabs
 agree to negotiate.
 In strife-torn South Arabia, the Saudi Arab-
 ians may be planning to work with exiled South
 Arabian rulers to undermine any regime dominated
 by the National Liberation Front.   The Front,  after
 months of fighting its rival nationalist group,
 now seems to have the upper hand and is in process
 of negotiating with the British.
 The leadership dispute between Algeria's
 Boumediene and his chief of staff remains un-
 resolved.   A "good offices" commission has been
 set up to mediate, but the leftist pro-Egyptian
 chief of staff is confident that he can force the
 ouster of three of Boumediene's henchmen.
 The Nigerian civil war appears likely to con-
 tinue for some time.   Biafra shows no signs of
 giving up, despite suffering sizable losses in
 attempts to retake Enugu and in the fighting around
 Calabar.   The Organization of African Unity has
 failed to date to follow through on the resolutions
 of the Kinshasa meeting and all attempts by would-
 be mediators to bring the two sides together have
 bogged down over mutually unacceptable terms for
 opening peace talks.

 MERCENARY PRESENCE PLAGUES CONGO (KINSHASA) AND RWANDA
 Efforts to evacuate Schramme's
 mercenaries and Katangans from
 Rwanda are proceeding slowly,
 while the batch of mercenaries
 who invaded Katanqa has returned
 to Angola.
 On 9 November, Congolese
 President Mobutu called a special
 meeting of an Organization of
 African Unity  (OAU)  subcommittee
 to discuss the mercenaries.    The
 ten-nation subcommittee, meeting
 from 10 through 12 November, pro-
 duced a resolution that does not
 mention extradition to the Congo
 but does stipulate certain condi-
 tions to be met before the mer-
 cenaries can be evacuated.
 Among these conditions is a
 demand that both the mercenaries
 and the governments of their coun-
 tries of nationality give written
 guarantees that the mercenaries
 will never return to Africa nor
 engage in activities that might
 endanger the stability of African
 states.   The mercenaries report-
 edly signed their guarantees on
 15 November, but there is still
 some question whether Belgium and
 France will be willing or able
 to meet the resolution's demands.
 Additionally, Mobutu seems anxious
 to commit these governments to
 some scheme for the reconstruc-
 tion of Bukavu before he will
 agree to the evacuation.   Rwandan
 President Kayibanda is eager to
 get rid of the mercenaries as soon
 as possible.   There have been signs
 that he was thinking either of
 braving the OAU's wrath and mount-
 ing an independent evacuation or
 attempting to have them extradited
 back to the Congo.   Some mercenaries
 reportedly are quietly slipping
 away in small groups.
 The 1,600 Katangans and de-
 pendents who were with Schramme's
 mercenaries are presenting their
 own problems.   Tentative arrange-
 ments to have them airlifted to
 Zambia have been delayed until
 Zambia receives an official re-
 quest from the Mobutu government
 to take the Katangans.   Although
 Mobutu says he has "no objection,"
 the Zambian Government does not
 want to risk later recrimination
 from Mobutu and is waiting for
 something more specific.
 The mercenaries who invaded
 western Katanga in early November
 have returned to Angola.   They
 have been disarmed by Portuguese
 authorities and are to be returned
 to their home countries.   Now
 operating in a "postcrisis"  at-
 mosphere, President Mobutu has
 ordered the army units flown to
 Bukavu and Katanga for the emer-
 to return to their garrisons..

 BRITISH TO TURN OVER SOUTH ARABIA TO NLF
 The British have agreed to ne-
 gotiate with the National Liberation
 Front  (NLF)  for the formal transfer
 of authority in South Arabia.   Ge-
 neva has been chosen for the nego-
 tiations in order to emphasize that
 the NLF is an equal and freely con-
 senting party.   Lord Shackelton will
 head the ministerial-level UK ne-
 gotiating team.
 The British decision has in-
 creased chances for an orderly with-
 drawal of their troops and has
 heightened chances that the NLF will
 be able to set up an operative gov-
 ernment before the British leave.
 Britain's earlier reluctance to
 meet the conditions originally de-
 manded by the NLF had dimmed pros-
 pects for an orderly turnover of
 power.   The NLF had called for a
 ministerial statement from the Brit-
 ish, prior to negotiations, recog-
 nizing the Front as the sole repre-
 sentative of South Arabia.
 The NLF eased the tension on
 11 November by indicating that it
 was willing to forgo formal recog-
 nition in advance provided the
 negotiations were held in a neu-
 tral venue.   Brown then announced
 on 14 November that Britain will
 begin negotiating the transfer of
 power in about a week and that UK
 forces will be completely with-
 drawn by 30 November.   If negotia-
 tions are not completed by that
 date, he said,  "there is nothing
 to stop them from continuing as
 between independent countries."
 The Saudis remain particularly  25X1
 concerned at the prospect of a
 South Arabia dominated by the NLF,
 Although the British had
 pledged to turn over authority to
 whatever group gained effective
 control, Foreign Secretary Brown
 was reluctant to give formal recog-
 nition to the NLF.   His difficulty
 was mainly a reflection of the sen-
 sitivity of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and
 the Persian Gulf states.   London
 especially did not wish to jeopard-
 ize the recent improvement in UK-
 Egyptian relations which had re-
 sulted in Egypt's granting authori-
 zation for British aircraft to over-
 fly Egypt during the final evacua-
 tion.

 TENSIONS RISE ON CYPRUS
 A tenuous cease-fire has
 halted serious fighting that
 erupted in the Ayios Theodoros -
 Kophinou area of Cyprus on 15 No-
 vember.   Greek and Turkish emo-
 tions remain high, however, and
 a period of tension and mutual
 f,ecrimination can be expected to
 accompany efforts to negotiate a
 more stable arrangement.
 The day-long battle--the most
 serious in two years--broke out
 after the Greek Cypriots in the
 southeast coast area attempted to
 resume routine police patrols that
 had been discontinued last July.
 On 14 November,  a patrol entered
 Ayios Theodoros without being op-
 posed by the Turkish Cypriots, who
 were apparently taken by surprise.
 The next day, however, when the
 patrol. attempted to re-enter the
 town,  shooting began and quickly
 spread northward in Kophinou.
 With the UN peace force unable to
 __nterc:ede, the National Guard took
 control of both areas,  overrun-
 ning a. number of UIDI observation
 posts in the process.
 The incident apparently re-
 sulted. largely from Cypriot armed
 forces commander General Grivas'
 insistence that the patrols be re-
 sumed, by force if necessary--a
 policy reportedly opposed by Cyp-
 riot President Makarios.   Grivas
 may have seen this course of ac-
 tion as a chance to repair his
 dwindling prestige in the Greek
 Cypriot community.
 The Greek Government, which
 has been critical cf Grivas'  tac-
 tics in the past,  apparently ap-
 proved. of his plan to resume the
 patrols.   It is not clear, how-
 ever, whether this support was
 the forerunner of some further
 Greek initiative on the over-all
 Cyprus problem.   Whatever its in-
 itial intent, Athens later ordered
 both the cease-fire and the with-
 drawal of the Greek Cypriot Na-
 tional Guard from the area of the
 fighting.
 Ankara expressed its grave
 concern and strongly implicated
 Gr.Lvas in the affair.   During the
 fighting,   a Turkish Foreign Min-
 istry official warned of possible
 air involvement if the issue were
 not resolved.   Upon hearing of
 the cease-fire,  another Turkish
 official said it remained to be
 seen whether the Greek Cypriots
 could be compelled to restore the
 status quo.   The cabinet was in
 emergency session through most of
 the night of 15 November, and a
 session of the Grand National As-
 sembly was held on 16 November.
 The Greek and Turkish gov-
 ernments appear to be more agi-
 tated than at any time since the
 Turkish air strike on Cyprus in
 1964.   Concern over the outbreak
 was increased by several previous
 incidents that had already height-
 ened tensions.   Both air forces
 have been in a high state of
 alert for several days as the re-
 sult of alleged mutual overflights.
 The clandestine entry into Cyprus
 of Turkish Cypriot leader Denk-
 tash earlier this month, his ar-
 rest, and his subsequent release
 also contributed to generally
 strained relations.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Several Latin American countries have been giv-

 the USSR and some East European Communist nations.
 Colombia recognized Rumania this week.   It has
 also signed a new five-year trade agreement with the
 USSR,  and diplomatic recognition may be in the off-
 ing.                                    A Soviet trade mission is expected in Ecuador
 shortly, a follow-up to a European visit of a simi-
 lar mission from Ecuador last month.
 President Gestido of Uruguay has called for in-
 creased trade with the bloc, and his government is
 considering several deals.   Guatemalan officials
 hope to sell surplus coffee in Eastern Europe and
 may enter into some kind of barter agreement.
 Although Chile and the USSR agreed last January
 on a trade and technical assistance package amount-
 ing to some $57 million, there has not yet been any
 significant increase in trade between them.   Peru
 recently rescinded a law forbidding trade with Com-
 munist countries, but no action has followed and
 the Peruvians have been cool toward recent Czecho-
 slovak overtures for a trade agreement.
 In another development, Mexico reportedly has
 made an arrangement with Cuba whereby the Mexicans
 will sell some $4.5 million worth of henequen fiber
 from the economically depressed state of Yucatan to
 help the Cubans ease a shortage of jute fiber.
 Fiber is essential to the Cuban economy because it
 is used in the manufacture of sugar bags.

 PANAMA COALITION STILL SPLIT ON PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE
 The presidential race is wide
 open again, with the division in
 government ranks giving opposition
 leader Arnulfo Arias a definite
 lead. The Electoral Tribunal's
 ruling that National Guard Com-
 mandant Bolivar Vallarino--a pos-
 sible compromise candidate--does
 not have "command jurisdiction"
 appears to exempt him from the
 requirement that public offi-
 cials who intend to run for the
 presidency must resign by 12
 November.
 Failing to reach agreement
 with his coalition partners on a
 mutually acceptable candidate for
 the May 1968 election,  Robles
 backed off from his earlier en-
 dorsement of David Samudio.   He
 suggested Comptroller General
 Olme do Rosas as a compromise,
 but opposition to Rosas and dis-
 pleasure with the Electoral Tri-
 bunal's ruling on Vallarino
 prompted the President to reaf-
 firm support for Samudio.   The
 four dissident coalition parties
 are continuing to back Second
 Vice President Arango.
 Meanwhile,  Robles has can-
 celed a scheduled meeting with
 the eight coalition parties and
 postponed the national conven-
 tions of the four loyal parties,
 which were to be held on 18 No-
 vember.   Efforts to settle the
 deadlock could continue until 13
 January, when presidential candi-
 dates must be inscribed.
 Thus far,  Robles has managed
 to alienate a large segment of
 the elite group that controls
 Panama and most of the military,
 which has traditionally kept the
 group in power.   At one point,
 a group of guard officers demanded
 Robles'  resignation for refusing
 to nominate Vallarino, but ap-
 parently backed off when Robles
 took a strong stand against their
 interference.
 Although military action appears
 unlikely,  Robles is faced with
 the difficult task of finding
 a candidate at least palatable
 to both the elite and the mili-
 tary.   Failure to do so only in-
 creases the chances of the con-
 troversial Arnulfo Arias.
 Arias has been ousted from
 the presidency on two occasions
 for his dictatorial and authori-
 tarian behavior.  The popular
 Panamenista leader has already
 concluded tentative agreements
 with some of the dissident coali-
 tion leaders for an electoral
 alliance.   The cabinet officers
 who represented the dissident
 parties have now resigned,  leav-
 ing their parties free to make
 a formal deal with Arias.   In-

 dent Belaunde's political pres-
 tige received a sharp setback on
 12 November, when his party lost
 two important congressional by-
 elections and the Christian Demo-
 cratic Party  (PDC)  withdrew from
 the governing coalition.
 Although the government ex-
 pected to lose the race in La
 Libertad Department, a stronghold
 of the opposition APRA party,  its
 poor showing in Lima---which has
 nearly 41 percent of the elector-
 ate--came as a shock to party
 leaders.   Not only did the oppo-
 sition APRA party run well ahead
 of the government candidate, but
 extreme leftist candidate Carlos
 Malpica showed surprising strength
 and drew nearly 13 percent of the
 vote.   Malpica's electoral alli-
 ance of extreme leftist and Com-
 munist parties, which attracted
 nearly 100,000 votes, may develop
 into a strong and threatening
 "leftist" front.
 ist front" to contest the presi-
 dential elections in 1969.
 The present unstable polit-
 ical situation will probably add
 a new dimension to growing public
 concern.   There have already been
 repeated demands from groups
 that normally support Belaunde
 that he ccme to grips with mount-
 ing economic problems or step
 down.
 The President's indecisive
 handling of recurring economic
 crises and his apparent decision
 not to intervene to secure con-
 gressional. approval for vitally
 needed tax reforms are already
 having their effect on the econ-
 omy.   Foreign exchange reserves
 are almost: exhausted, and the ad-
 ministration must soon choose be-
 tween further devaluation or
 strict economic controls.   One
 major bank is reportedly warning
 its clients that foreign exchange
 reserves are too low to sustain
 the present unrealistic exchange
 rate for long.
 The PDC's withdrawal from
 its nearly five-year-old alliance
 with the Belaunde administration
 stems from disillusionment with
 the pace of economic and social
 reforms,  the President's indeci-
 sion in coping with current prob-
 lems, and a growing leftist trend
 within the party.   PDC leaders
 are now openly calling for the

 Whatever the government's
 decision,  it is almost certain to
 provoke new demands for wage ad-
 justments to match the rising

 plans to take over the government   25X1

 CHILEAN STABILIZATION PROGRAM HEADS FOR TROUBLE
 A split appears to have been
 averted in President Frei's Chris-
 tian Democratic Party  (PDC)  over
 the 1968 wage-price policy, but
 the legislation still faces op-
 position from virtually every
 other political and economic
 quarter.
 Frei considers the wage re-
 adjustment legislation a vital
 part of his stabilization program,
 which is aimed at curtailing the
 inflation that has plagued Chile
 for more than 50 years.   The leg-
 islation provides for an over-all
 wage increase in 1968 of 25 per-
 cent for employees of private
 firms and 20 percent for govern-
 ment employees.   The government's
 original plan called for 15 per-
 cent of the increase to be in
 cash and the remainder in bonds.
 The bonds would be used for a
 fund to increase government in-
 vestments in fields such as
 petrochemicals.
 The PDC cabinet members ap-
 proved the plan,  and threatened
 to resign unless the party sup-
 ported it.   The party finally
 agreed to a graduated scale that
 would give lower income workers
 a higher percentage of cash.   if
 this compromise is accepted by
 the government,  a formal split be-
 tween Frei and the leftist PDC
 leaders will be averted.
 The Communists and other
 leftists have made no secret of
 their opposition to the bill. Con-
 servatives and private business-
 men also are apprehensive, because
 they fear further government in-
 volvement in economic activity.
 Businessmen object strongly to the
 price control provisions of the
 legislation,  and prospects for
 congressional approval of the en-
 tire program are dim.
 The labor unions, many of
 which are controlled by Communists
 and Socialists,  contend that the
 legislation does not adequately
 compensate union members for the
 inflationary price increases last
 year.   Furthermore, the proposal
 contains a one-year ban on the
 right to strike.   The Communist-
 controlled Chilean Workers'  Central
 is considering calling a general
 strike in opposition to the legis-
 lation.
 Although general strikes for
 political purposes rarely have
 much success in Chile, opposition
 to the wage program is so wide-
 spread that this one might gain
 nationwide support.   Even if the
 strike ban is included in the
 final legislation,  1968 is certain
 to see increased labor agitation
 because the government has had only
 mixed success in dealing with il-
 legal strikes.
