 ISRAEL         e%
 The already uncertain prospects of
 Israel's long-dominant Labor Party in the
 national election next month were dealt a
 new blow by the exposure last week of
 financial irregularities on the part of
 caretaker Prime Minister Rabin and his
 abrupt withdrawal from the top position
 on Labor's electoral list. The party's new
 candidate for prime minister after the
 election, Defense Minister Peres, man-
 aged to win the grudging endorsement of
 factions within Labor and an allied party
 that have long opposed him.
 Ironically, the Labor Party, which for
 months had been rocked by corruption
 scandals and torn by dissension, was just
 beginning to rebound from its low stan-
 ding in opinion polls when the Israeli
 press disclosed that Rabin and his wife
 had illegally maintained bank accounts in
 the US. The most recent public surveys
 showed the Labor Party and its small
 left-wing ally, Mapam, moving ahead of
 both the right-wing Liikud opposition
 group and the new reform-minded
 Democratic Movement for Change.
 Rabin, under Israeli law, must continue
 as caretaker Prime Minister until after
 the election, but he clearly intends to play
 a minimum role. Control of Labor's cam-
 paign quickly passed to Peres, a more
 polished and self-assured politician and
 one who will likely run a more dynamic
 campaign.
 The new party leader, who almost
 defeated Rabin in party voting in 1974
 and again at Labor's convention last
 February, is an established hawk on
 Arab-Israeli questions but at the same
 time a pragmatist who is well aware he
 must broaden his support beyond the par-
 ty's conservative faction. Immediately
 after Rabin dropped out, Peres moved to
 conciliate leading party doves, notably
 Foreign Minister Allon, who settled for
 the second spot on Labor's list and a
 promise of the defense portfolio. Abba
 Eban, already an ally of Peres, was
 promised a new tour as foreign minister in
 a Peres government.
 This week Peres succeeded in per-
 suading Mapam to maintain its alliance
 with Labor. His public statement last
 weekend that he remains committed to
 the party platform, which calls for
 withdrawal from some occupied territory
 as part of a peace settlement, and the
 prospect of Eban's return to the Foreign
 Ministry probably helped.  Mapam
 leaders were probably also influenced by
 the lack of a realistic alternative to Labor
 as a political ally and concern that aban-
 donment of Labor now would jeopardize
 their prospects for participating in the
 coalition that will be formed after the
 election.
 Peres may take other steps to broaden
 his appeal before the vote on May 17. He
 is unlikely, however, to do anything that
 would seriously alienate his conservative
 backers. He has said that the conservative
 National Religious Party must be includ-
 ed in any new Labor-led coalition. He has
 even indicated he could take the Likud
 into his government, although privately he
 has said that the Democratic Movement
 would be a more likely coalition partner.

 LEBANON 2-./
 The Christians, who started the round
 by  launching an  intensive drive to
 eliminate the Palestinians from a buffer
 zone all along the border with Israel, have
 at this point little to show for their effort.
 All important territory taken by them
 during the first two weeks is now back in
 fedayeen hands. In addition, the intensity
 and initial success of the Christians' drive
 brought the mainstream  Palestinian
 group Fatah, which had not been
 significantly involved in the southern
 fighting, into the field against them and
 contributed to a growing rapprochement
 between Fatah and the Syrians.
 The new commander of the Lebanese
 army, General Khoury, indicated this
 week that he hopes to send a supervisory
 force into southern Lebanon in about two
 weeks.  He reportedly i itends to use
 troops  from  a  small  mixed
 Christian-Muslim group originally put
 together by the Syrians to form the
 nucleus of a new Lebanese army. Khoury
 recognizes that this force will not be able
 to maintain peace in the area unless the
 Palestinians and Christians acquiesce; he
 does not intend to send the force into the
 area until a cease-fire is actually in effect.
 A
 The intensive fighting in southern
 Lebanon between Christian extremists
 and Palestinians that began last month
 appeared to be subsiding this week. With
 the status quo ante about restored after
 three weeks of seesaw battle, the foreign
 patrons of both sides-Israel for the
 Christians  and  Syria  for  the
 Palestinians-have  apparently become
 anxious for the fighting to die down lest it
 lead to a wider conflict.
 Although the warring groups continued
 to exchange heavy artillery fire, there was
 little movement on the ground this week
 and the overall situation seemed to be
 stabilizing. The Christians, in retreat last
 week before a Syrian-supported Palestin-
 ian counteroffensive, succeeded in fend-
 ing off attempts to drive them out of
 their important base at Marj Uyun near
 the Israeli border. By midweek, there
 were indications that the Palestinians had
 agreed not to try further to take the town
 and Prat leaders on both sides might be
 ready for a cease-fire.
 The assassination last weekend in Lon-
 don of a prominent North Yemeni
 political figure may prompt President
 Hamdi to move against tribal opponents.
 The identity of the assassin of Abdallah
 al-Hajri, a former prime minister of
 North Yemen, is not yet known. The
 North Yemenis believe the killing was the
 work either of ousted leftist politicians in
 league with dissident tribesmen, or of
 radical South Yemenis opposed to their
 country's growing ties with North Yemen
 and Saudi Arabia.
 Al-Hajri was an arch-conservative and
 a close adviser to Hamdi; he was viewed
 by many as the unofficial number-two
 man in the government. He had been
 leading an effort to broaden the regime's
 base of support by establishing a
 progovernment political party encom-
 passing the country's disparate political
 groups.
 The US embassy believes Hamdi is
 likely to place the blame for al-Hajri's
 death on the leftist tribal grouping, at least
 until contrary evidence is available.
 Tribesmen led by Hamdi's rival, Abdallah
 al-Ahmar, recently have again asserted
 their control over parts of northern North
 Yemen at the expense of the central
 government's authority.
 Hamdi will attempt to turn popular
 resentment over the death of al-Hajri,
 who was widely respected, into support
 for the regime. As he has in the past,
 Hamdi is likely to move against the tribal
 dissidents by indirect political means
 rather  than  with  military  force.
 EGYPT-LIBYA               1(   7
 The continuing flow  f invective be-
 tween Egypt and Libya was accented
 during the past week by officially inspired
 violence in both countries. There have
 been no major new military developments
 along the border.
 The Egyptian consulate in Benghazi
 was sacked last weekend, and its workers
 confined in a nearby hotel; on April 13,
 Libyans demonstrated at the Egyptian
 embassy  in  Tripoli  following  a
 government-sponsored rally to denounce
 Egyptian President Sadat. Libya has also
 imposed further restrictions on travel by
 Egyptians, this time on those trying to
 leave Libya.
 Egypt has retaliated in kind to almost
 every incident.  Egyptians burned the
 Libyan consulate in Alexandria. There
 has  been  no  indication so far that
 Libyan diplomats will be ordered out
 of Egypt or recalled by Tripoli.
 The media in both countries continue to
 trade charges. In a slight shift in tactics,
 Cairo dailies this week argued that Egypt
 should exercise restraint with regard to
 Libya because Libyans themselves were
 fed up with Qadhafi and would soon oust
 him. Egypt, it was said, must guard
 against providing Qadhafi with a foreign
 scapegoat.

 LIBYA  :if /
 Some 20 Libyan military officers con-
 victed of participating in a coup attempt
 against President Qadhafi in 1975
 reportedly were executed on April 2. The
 government has not confirmed the ex-
 ecutions, but rumors about them have
 generated a great deal of anger and ap-
 prehension-particularly   among
 Qadhafi's detractors in the military and in
 the middle class.
 Agitation over reports of the executions
 is running especially high in Benghazi, the
 capital of the Cyrenaica region, where op-
 position to the regime is strongest. Army
 troops reportedly have been stationed at
 key points in the city, presumably to
 forestall demonstrations. Qadhafi
 periodically has placed Cyrenaica under
 military rule and apparently is con-
 sidering doing so again.
 The emotional reactions to the ex-
 ecutions could help solidify opposition to
 the regime. Earlier reportiing suggests that
 a group of dissidents mainly from the air
 force has been considering a move to top-
 ple Qadhafi.
 Qadhafi has had a reputation for
 leniency toward his opponents; until now,
 there have been no executions and very lit-
 tie officially sanctioned violence under his
 rule. There has been growing concern
 among Libyans, however, that Qadhafi's
 reorganization of the government last
 month in a move to legitimize his one-
 man rule and reduce the power of other
 former members of the recently abolished
 Revolutionary Command Council would
 lead to greater repression.
 It is too early to judge whether
 Qadhafi's reported resort to violence will
 better serve him or his opponents. Having
 narrowly escaped several assassination
 attempts over the past year, the Libyan
 leader probably believes the need to in-
 timidate his opponents outweighs the
 adverse popular reaction to unaccustomed
 violence. Most Libyan military officers
 are likely to be more concerned at least in-
 itially about their own survival than about
 taking action against the regime.
 Qadhafi's image as a benign leader
 dedicated to Libya's interests before his
 own is rapidly dissipating. His turn
 toward the USSR, his disregard for local
 religious leaders, and his resort to tribal
 politics have offended even some of his
 staunchest supporters and may have
 begun to undermine his popularity among
 Libya's largely  rural population.

 PAKISTAN  2  ZZ_
 The month-old campaign by the op-
 position to force Prime Minister Bhutto
 from office by mobilizing public pressure
 against him may be close to achieving its
 goal. A week of violent demonstrations,
 centered in populous Punjab Province,
 has seriously weakened Bhutto. Student
 and labor organizations have joined the
 fray for the first time, and most observers
 in Pakistan believe Bhutto will have to
 step down shortly.
 Although the opposition's campaign
 against the rigging of the National
 Assembly election on March 7 quickly
 succeeded in some areas, it had failed un-
 til recently to foster significant disorders
 in the Punjab, the key area. On April 9,
 however,  the  opposition  staged
 demonstrations against the convening of
 the provincial assembly in every Punjabi
 city of any importance. Events in Lahore,
 the provincial capital, were even bloodier
 than the violence that forced President
 Ayub Khan out of office in 1969.

 Demonstrations have continued both in
 the Punjab and in the cities of the Sind,
 and the US embassy in Islamabad
 reported on April 13 that the political
 situation  was deteriorating in  both
 provinces. The opposition was planning
 what could be its major effort for April
 15.
 Although Bhutto is still making every
 effort to stay in office, he has little left to
 bargain with. He can no longer count on
 the support of the military. Some
 members of his own party have resigned,
 sparking speculation that mass desertions
 will occur. Two ambassadors-who as
 military officers played a key role in
 Bhutto's rise to power in late 1971-have
 also resigned.
 Army leaders hope to avoid having to
 seize power themselves and apparently are
 trying to force both pro- and anti-govern-
 ment politicians into an agreement. The
 opposition still shows no inclination to
 compromise. It does, however, appear to
 be considering a proposal for ending the
 confr)ntation, presumably one that at a
 minimum would strip Bhutto of effective
 membership under the auspices of the
 four disgraced leftists.
 If no announcement is made before the
 congress on the status of former vice
 premier Teng Hsiao-ping, a resolution of
 that issue will probably be formally an-
 nounced  duriU_ the congress.  Teng's

 CHINA     2,
 The Chinese Communist Party is mak-
 ing plans for a national congress, the first
 in foLr years. The timing of the congress
 is uncertain, but it may be heldearly this
 summer.
 The congress will name a new Central
 Committee and Politburo. As the first
 congress since Mao's death, it will also
 have the special responsibility of ratifying
 the selection of Hua Kuo-feng as party
 chairman and of formalizing the purge of
 the four leftist leaders last fall. The
 decision to move ahead with a congress
 was apparently made at last month's
 major leadership meeting in Peking.
 It will take at least until June to select
 delegates from across the country. The
 party is now examining the credentials of
 many party members suspected of gaining
 failure to return by now to public political
 life, despite the reports and predictions of
 Chinese officials that he would, suggests
 he is the subject of continuing controver-
 sy. At the heart of the issue may be the
 division of power among the leaders and
 the personal political fortunes of some of
 them who are thought to be opposing
 Teng's return.

 CHINA-JAPAN
 A high-level Japanese business mission
 left Peking last week with an unexpected
 Chinese agreement in principle to a
 long-term private trade accord. The
 Chinese treated the delegation especially
 well, providing a sharp contrast with
 the USSR's toughness in current nego-
 tiations with the Japanese on fishing
 rights.
 The  Soviets  will  be annoyed  not
 just at Peking, but also at Tokyo-a
 similar Japanese mission to Moscow
 last year turned aside a Soviet offer
 for a long-term economic agreement.
 Under the proposed trade agreement,
 China would provide oil and coal in return
 for Japanese steel, construction materials,
 and plants-including power-generating
 facilities-that the Chinese would use to
 expand oil and coal production. The offer
 to export coal and oil is another indication
 of a general consensus within the new
 Chinese leadership to use natural
 resources to earn foreign exchange. The
 four leftist leaders purged from the Polit-
 buro last fall had sharply attacked this
 policy. In an effort to expedite exports of
 natural resources, Peking has reportedly
 established a new committee comprised of
 China's top economic officials, including
 Minister of Trade Li Chiang.
 A number of important details, such as
 the duration of the agreement, annual
 target levels of Chinese exports, and pay-
 ment terms, are still to be negotiated
 between the Chinese Foreign Trade
 Ministry and interested Japanese
 businesses.
 In the Peking discussions, Li Chiang
 agreed to "study" Japanese proposals of
 5- to 10-year repayment terms-a possi-
 ble indication that the Chinese will stretch
 repayment beyond 5 years.  Deferred
 payments and other forms of foreign
 credit have long been politically sensitive
 subjects in China. With the leftists remov-
 ed, the leadership may now enjoy a freer
 hand to utilize credit facilities and
 accelerate purchases of needed Western
 equipment   and   technology.

 The rebels had seized one island late last
 month and another last week. Both the
 Lao and Thai governments seemed intent
 on keeping the fighting from escalating
 into a serious confrontation.
 Sporadic shooting incidents have
 erupted between Thai and Lao forces
 along the Mekong since the Communists
 took over in Laos in 1975. Late that year,
 Bangkok closed the border for several
 months, an act that cut sharply into the
 supply of daily necessities in Vientiane.
 The border is now open, and relations
 between the two countries have been
 generally less troubled in the past year.
 In the latest incident., Lao officials
 notified Thailand of plans to recover the
 islands, and Bangkok agreed that the
 islands were Lao territory and promised
 not to assist the rebels. Although the Lao
 government called a state of alert, the
 likelihood of a serious confrontation was
 never high.
 MOZAMBIQUE -

 Commercial sales of electricity
 generated by the Cabora-Bassa power
 project in Mozambique began late last
 month. Almost all of the power is being
 sold to South Africa.
 Initially, three generating units with a
 capacity of about 1,200 megawatts will
 feed a new high-voltage power line linking
 the dam with the South African power
 grid. The scheduled addition of two more
 units and another transmission line early
 next year will bring total capacity to 2,000
 megawatts, roughly equivalent to that of
 Egypt's Aswan Dam.
 The project was designed years ago by
 Portugal to provide inexpensive electricity
 to its Mozambique territory and to South

 Africa. The planners hoped that it would
 eventually become the cornerstone of the
 agricultural, mineral, and industrial
 deve opment of Mozambique's Zambezi
 Basin.
 Despite Mozambique's harsh rhetoric
 against South Africa's white minority
 gove ?nment, practical considerations con-
 tinut: to prevail in such important
 economic relations as the sale of electrici-
 ty. Mozambique would like to reduce its
 dependence on South Africa, but no other
 neigFboring country can use the large
 amoi.nt  of power  generated  by  the
 proje--t.
 South Africa will probably continue to
 purchase electricity from Mozambique as
 long is the price is favorable. It also hopes
 to recover its investment of more than $30
 million  in the project. Cabora-Bassa
 could provide up to 10 percent of South
 Africa's electricity by 1980. South Africa,
 however, is likely to maintain a domestic
 reserve generating capacity equal to the
 amount it imports to guard against power
 interruptions.
 Mozambique must export electricity in
 order to pay for the foreign financing used
 in co-istructing the project; until the loans
 are r.,-paid Mozambique will receive only
 a small amount of the foreign exchange
 from such sales.
 The potential agricultural and in-
 dustrial  benefits  of  Cabora-Bassa
 probably will not be realized in the near
 future. Mozambique  lacks  the
 managerial,  technical, and financial
 resources to develop the surrounding
 region.
 ZAIRE   '
 President Mobutu's prospects  for
 checking the progress of the former
 Katangan soldiers who invaded Shaba
 Region from Angola last month have im-
 proved with the recent arrival of troop
 support from Morocco. It will probably
 be some time, however, before the foreign
 troops and the Zairian army are ready to
 move aggressively. The Katangans, for
 their part, can be expected to continue to
 strengthen their position in the one third
 of Shaba that they hold.
 The Mobutu regime, which seemed ear-
 ly last week to be on the ropes because of
 the ineffectiveness of its forces in Shaba,
 received an important boost from the
 arrival, starting late last week, of some
 1,500 Moroccan troops; they were airlifted
 to Zaire by France, which made 11
 transports available for the operation.
 Another Moroccan contingent of equal
 size may be sent if deemed necessary. In
 addition, a number of French military ad-
 visers are now in Shaba, where some are
 attached to the Zairian commander's staff
 and others to the Moroccan contingent.
 Other new foreign assistance may have
 arrived or be coming. A shipment of

 equipment-probably including military
 supplies-reportedly arrived by air from
 China recently, and more Chinese
 assistance is coming by sea. An Egyptian
 military delegation has been in Zaire this
 week surveying the government's needs.
 Moroccan King Hassan's decision to
 send troops to Zaire was motivated in
 part by a desire to demonstrate solidarity
 with a fellow moderate African state that
 has supported Rabat in its continuing dis-
 pute with Algeria over Western Sahara.
 Hassan is also concerned--as are France,
 Egypt, and Belgium, which retains major
 economic interests in its former
 colony-about the spread of Soviet and
 Cuban influence in southern Africa and
 the possibility that radicals may gain
 power in Zaire if Mobutu falls. The
 Zairian leader has insisted that the
 Soviets and Cubans are behind the
 P P&
 Katangan rebels.
 Most of the Moroccan troops now in
 Zaire have taken up positions in or near
 Kolwezi, the key mining center that has
 been a major objective of the Katangans.
 The invaders have advanced a little closer
 to Kolwezi; this week they were reported
 to be about 50 kilometers away.
 The infusion of the relatively well-
 trained and disciplined Moroccan troops
 presumably will secure Kolwezi and other
 important towns and may help stiffen the
 Zairian forces. Plans are apparently un-
 der consideration to use the Moroccans to
 spearhead an eventual counteroffensive.
 The Katangans will not be readily
 eliminated from Shaba, however, as they
 will probably rely on guerrilla tactics,
 against which the Moroccans are not like-
 ly to be very effective.

 South Africa, which is attempting to
 modernize and improve its badly outdated
 navy, reportedly will take delivery next
 month of the first of six Israeli-built
 Reshef-class patrol boats it ordered some
 time ago. The 250-ton boats are designed
 to carry antiaircraft artillery and up
 to eight Gabriel surface-to-surface mis-

 According to a source of the US naval
 attache in Pretoria, the Israelis are also
 training 100 South Africans-the comple-

 The crew for the first Reshef has been
 conducting at-sea training on the boat. A
 South African naval replenishment ship
 will escort the new Reshef from Gibraltar
 to South Africa.
 A second Israeli-built Reshef is due to
 be launched this summer. South Africa
 will build at least three others under
 license in Durban, but they probably will
 not be ready for launching until next year.
 The naval modernization program also
 includes the purchase of two destroyer es-

 The government's legalization of the
 Communist Party on April 9 reflects the
 deep commitment of King Juan Carlos
 and ;'rime Minister Suarez to ensuring a
 free and democratic parliamentary elec-
 tion this summer. Die-hard rightists had
 strongly opposed removal of the ban im-
 posed by Franco 38 years ago; moderate
 oppcsition groups had pressed for
 removal, alleging that the election would
 not to truly free unless the Communists
 were-allowed to participate.
 The government's hand was forced
 when the Supreme Court refused early
 this month to rule on the party's legality.
 The King and Suarez had hoped that a
 court decision in the Communists' favor
 would help to dilute a strong reaction
 from the political right and the military.
 The timing of the government's an-
 nouncement-Easter  weekend-seemed
 designed to reduce chances of an im-
 mediate violent reaction.
 So far, protest action has been of a
 minor nature, but dissatisfaction with the
 government's move is clearly widespread
 on the right and among the military. At a
 meeting of the army's Supreme Council
 on April 12, officers expressed angry dis-
 approval both of the decision and the fact
 that it was made without a formal
 meeting of the cabinet. The navy minister,
 an admiral who had long been a staunch
 Franco supporter,  resigned  from the
 government the same day, and some other
 senior military leaders may also quit their
 posts. More serious dissent in the armed
 forces may have been headed off,
 however, by an army announcement on
 April 13 that it accepts the government's
 action and by the decision of the remain-
 ing three military ministers not to resign.
 Thy; military's thinking has been evolv-
 ing on the Communist question in recent
 months. Most of the officer corps had
 c- /0 k I'A J_
 moved from outright opposition to legali-
 zation last fall to acceptance in February
 of the decision to let the Supreme Court
 make a ruling. Since then, increasing
 numbers of Spaniards  had apparently
 come to expect the party to be legalized
 before the election and this, along with
 Suarez' frequent consultations with the
 military ministers and the implicit back-
 ing of the King, may have impressed sen-
 ior military officers.
 The government weathered a potential
 crisis in the north last weekend when
 Basque political parties defied a ban on
 public celebration of Basque national day.
 Strong security measures and bad weather
 helped to restrict the violence.

 Another round of UN-sponsored talks
 between Greek and Turkish Cypriots end-
 ed last week without any significant
 movement toward a Cyprus settlement.
 The two sides made more concrete
 proposals than they had previously,
 however, perhaps setting the stage for a
 future narrowing of their differences.
 Much will depend on the outcome of the
 parliamentary election in Turkey in early
 June.
 The talks, which were held in Vienna,
 concentrated on Greek Cypriot territorial
 proposals and Turkish Cypriot con-
 stitutional proposals. The proposals un-
 derscored the protagonists' deep mutual
 distrust and their aversion to compromise.
 The Greek Cypriots presented a
 proposal based on conceding 20 percent of
 the island's territory to the Turkish
 Cypriots, who currently control 36 per-
 cent as a result of the invasion of the
 island by troops from Turkey in 1974.
 The Turkish Cypriot proposal called
 for a weak central government concerned
 mainly with foreign affairs and defense,
 and with no power to tax. It did, however,
 leave open the possibility of greater
 powers for the central government in the
 future.
 The Turkish Cypriots, indicating that
 the Greek Cypriot proposal failed to
 satisfy the Turkish community's security
 or economic requirements, did not com-
 mit themselves to give up any specific
 areas. The Greek Cypriots nevertheless
 seem willing to continue negotiating in the
 hope that a government capable of strong
 foreign policy initiatives will emerge from
 the Turkish parliamentary election.
 The Turks and the Turkish Cypriots
 seem more pleased by the talks than the
 other side. They got a specific territorial
 proposal from the Greek Cypriots and
 retained their own options on both
 territorial and constitutional questions.
 At the same time, the negotiating process,
 important to Ankara's hope of securing a
 restoration of full US military assistance,
 is continuing.
 The negotiations will probably resume
 in Nicosia in early May. They could result
 in a further elucidation of positions, but
 the Turkish Cypriots are not likely to
 make any significant concessions before
 the Turkish election. The talks may even
 be postponed if Turkish Prime Minister
 Demirel concludes that they would have
 negative repercussions on his party at the
 polls.

 President Videla has strengthened his position with the
 Argentine military and may now be in a better position to move
 forward on moderate proposals for restructuring the unions and
 permitting civilians a limited political role.
 N 4  ` Argentina: Support for President Videla
 President Videla begins his second year
 as Argentina's leader in a reasonably
 strong position. Only a few weeks ago
 there was widespread talk about Videla
 giving up one of his jobs, the presidency or
 his membership on the junta. Such talk
 has now ceased, and the President seems
 to. be enjoying-at least for the pres-
 ent-the support not only of the army,
 but also the navy and air force, which
 from time to time expressed dissatisfac-
 tion with him. This military consensus
 around Videla means that for the time be-
 ing officers with moderate views are in
 control in Argentina.
 Videla and the junta last month marked
 the first anniversary of their takeover with
 low  key,  characteristically austere
 statements. The President's address to the
 nation pointed to the progress made dur-
 ing the past year in controlling leftist sub-
 versives and in improving the economy.
 As is his custom, he promised nothing, ex-
 cept that the armed forces would not be
 deterred from pursuing their own concept
 of economic and political progress.
 Videla did suggest that a new, more
 constructive phase of political activity
 could begin. He made it clear there will be
 no early return to free-wheeling politics,
 but some civilians will be allowed to ex-
 press opinions on a variety of subjects
 through informal channels.
 On March 15, Videla assembled all
 army generals to review the government's
 performance during the past year and to
 outline its plans for the future. The Presi-
 dent anticipated criticism of his perfor-
 mance and skillfully neutralized it. The
 session, which lasted an entire workday,
 was a success for the President. He
 assuaged the feelings of the air force and
 navy  by  strongly  reiterating  the
 supremacy of the junta and playing down
 his own role.
 The President announced at the
 meeting that he would remain as chief ex-
 ecutive and army commander in chief
 through March 1979, refuting the notion,
 widely discussed among Argentines in re-
 cent months, that he would relinquish
 either the presidency or his post in the
 three-man interservice junta.
 Videla himself may have had a hand in
 encouraging public discussion of his au-
 thority. He probably judged that such
 a "debate" would do him no harm and
 might help, and he was right. The dis-
 cussions never turned up a serious con-
 tender to  replace him.  Moreover,
 although some individuals indulged in
 personal criticisms, no really damaging
 criticism of Videla emerged.
 The army meeting seems to have
 demonstrated that the present govern-
 ment, with Videla at the top, is still the
 most desirable choice and perhaps the
 only practical one. The public "debate"
 may also have served as an escape valve
 for Argentina's highly politicized
 citizenry, deprived for the past year of
 normal outlets for political expression.
 The Government and Labor
 The ascendancy of Videla and his
 moderate line will have an important im-
 pact                                                                                                    in  the  crucial  area  of
 government-labor relations. Union ac-
 tivities have been suspended since the
 coup, and the military has been unable to
 agree on how to treat organized labor.
 Some military men believe labor, the
 long-time stronghold of Peronism, must
 be permanently shorn of its potential
 political power. Others, including Videla,
 favor an accommodation.
 Developments on the labor scene over
 the past year have worked to the advan-
 tage of Videla and weakened the
 arguments of those calling for punitive
 measures. There have been numerous
 violations of the junta's ban on strikes,
 but the government has not used force,
 nor has labor defied the junta on the
 massive scale some officers anticipated in
 response  to  government-imposed
 economic austerity measures.
 The way now seems clear for the
 emergence of a labor policy that is not as
 vindictive as the so-called "hard liners"
 had demanded. The new labor code,
 although it will still be restrictive, will
 probably allow unions to join together in
 federations. Unions will continue to be
 prohibited from blatant political activity.

 It is doubtful that larger groupings like
 the  Peronist General Workers'
 Confederation, through which labor flex-
 ed its political muscle during the Peron
 regimes, will have government backing,
 but such a confederation may not be
 specifically banned, as some officers have
 recommended. Videla presumably hopes
 the workers will recognize and accept the
 new law as a compromise, permitting the
 uniors some, but by no means all, the im-
 portance they have had in the past.
 The Government and Civilians
 Conditions also seem favorable for im-
 plementing Videla's policy of encouraging
 communication  with  representative
 civilians. At the meeting with army
 generals, the President indicated that he
 intencs to continue this process, but made
 it clear that he envisions no program for-
 mally reincorporating civilians into the
 governing process. This is in keeping with
 Videl is public statements; he has
 repeatedly declared that he has no
 timetable for the reemergence of an
 elected legislature or free political parties.
 Civilian opinion leaders will be disap-
 pointed-but not surprised-that the
 political "opening" many of them had
 begun to predict some weeks ago is not
 arounc the corner. Most of them will take
 heart, however, at least privately, from
 the fact that Videla and not one of the
 hard-li ie generals is in the driver's seat.

 as. Here, Videla is
 not, and cannot afford to be, any less
 tough than the "hard liners."
 The President may attempt to make
 sure that the security forces pay more
 attention to legal guarantees, and he could
 justify this approach to the "hard liners"
 by arguing that the subversive threat had
 been so obviously hurt by the
 government's campaign that the harsh
 measures were no longer necessary. Any
 resurgence of the terrorism, however,
 would force Videla to get tougher.
 Hemisphere Affairs
 In his first year in office Videla has
 visited the capitals of Chile, Peru, and
 Bolivia. He plans trips to Venezuela and
 Paraguay.
 He is clearly making the point that
 after a period of enforced withdrawal
 from hemispheric affairs because of
 domestic political turmoil, Argentina is
 now ready to claim its rightful place as an
 important regional power. The message
 Videla carries to the heads of other
 authoritarian governments in the area is
 one of solidarity in the face of inter-
 national pressure for greater respect for
 human rights.
 The General is well suited to the task of
 rebuilding his country's influence in the
 region without antagonizing Brazil, the
 historic rival that has pulled far ahead of
 Argentina by almost any measure. With
 his reserved style, Videla seeks to assure
 the Brazilians that his country is not out
 to make gains at their expense. For the
 moment, at least, the Brazilians probably
 take him at his word, seeing virtually no
 prospect for Argentina to contest serious-
 ly the regional dominance Brazil has es-
 tablished.
 Outlook
 The military consensus that Videla has
 established is fragile. The officers who
 have  in  the past  been the most
 tro.pblesome to Videla, navy chief Ad-
 miral Massera, for example, are quiet, at
 least for now. Still, Massera has a long
 history as a "spoiler," and he is not likely
 ruptive effects on military unity. Organiz-
 ed labor could react violently if a new
 labor code is not forthcoming soon or if it
 is enacted and, in their view, is too restric-
 tive. Terrorists may launch a spectacular
 last-ditch offensive. Such events would
 reinforce  the  hard-line  officers  and
 weaken Videla.
 Videla recognizes the frailty of the con-
 sensus. He will continue to move with
 great caution on all fronts in order to
 preserve it. Policy making and implemen-
 tation will continue to be slow and
 cumbersome and could falter if the regime
 were to be confronted with fast-break' g
 problems.

 Canada's decision to buy new fighter aircraft is an overdue
 first step toward modernizing its armed forces, but decisions on
 other equipment purchases and financing have yet to be made.
 A recent decision by the Canadian
 government to go ahead with the acquisi-
 tion of a new fighter aircraft is a major
 commitment toward long-overdue mod-
 ernization of the armed forces.
 The cabinet has approved the letting of
 bids to buy 130 to 150 high-performance
 multipurpose fighters to replace the aging
 CF-10ls used for continental defense and
 the CF-5s and outmoded CF-104s that are
 part of Canada's contribution to NATO.
 The  procurement  program,  expected
 to get under way late next year, is
 likely  to  cost  $2 billion over  a
 10-year period.
 The decision underscores a dramatic
 turnaround in Canadian defense policy
 over the past three years. In 1974, the
 Canadian armed forces, were approaching
 the point where they could no longer
 effectively carry out military assignments
 at home or abroad. There had been no
 major equipment purchases for almost 10
 years, and an increase in the defense
 budget in 1973 had been swallowed up by
 inflation.
 By December 1974 the government had
 become sufficiently alarmed by the
 deterioration of its military posture to in-
 itiate a comprehensive review of the
 defense structure. With defense costs in-
 creasing at 12 to 15 percent annually, it
 was soon clear that a substantial increase
 in the defense budget was needed to make
 the armed forces capable of meeting their
 responsibilities for internal security,
 North American defense, NATO, and
 Canada: A New Look in Defense
 peacekeeping abroad.
 It could be achieved only at the expense
 of other government programs. The alter-
 native was to reduce the armed forces sub-
 stantially and cut back military tasks
 across the board-a course unpalatable to
 Prime Minister Trudeau and other leaders
 in part because of new concern about the
 build-up of Soviet military strength.
 The European Connection
 A key factor in Canada's decision in
 1975 substantially to increase defense
 spending was its eagerness to cement
 economic links with the EC. Trudeau,
 who had deliberately played down defense
 concerns after taking office in 1968, en-
 visioned close economic and political ties
 cks
 Page            11
 with Western Europe as the cornerstone
 of his effort to reduce Canada's
 dependence on the US. A "contractual
 link" with the EC was finally negotiated
 last year, but the Europeans made it
 clear that there are military dues to
 be paid if Canada hopes to get much in
 the way of real economic benefits from
 its ties with the EC. Canadian defense
 spending comprises 2.3 percent of gross
 national product, exceeding only that of
 Luxembourg among NATO countries and
 well behind the NATO average of 5.1
 percent of GNP.
 Problems at Home

 crease defense spending was a general

 the "industrial benefits" Canada can ex-
 pect to enjoy from the multibillion-dollar
 program.
 A ship replacement effort, expected to
 cost $1.3 billion, will not get under way
 until the early 1980s. It will be close to
 1990 before the first four to eight
 ships-if heavy  destroyers  are
 selected-are in the water and some 20
 years before the proposed new fleet of 20
 ships is ready for combat.
 Canada's agreement to participate in
 NATO's Airborne Warning and Control
 P e&-
 System-AWACS-also has com-
 plicated defense planning and sparked
 debate within the government over the
 wisdom of the commitment. Canada's
 share of the cost would be :6200 million,
 with $60 million returning in the form of
 offset.
 Some Canadians doubt the cost effec-
 tiveness of AWACS in North American
 air defense. Others argue that, if Canada
 supports AWACS at all, it should do so
 only in the context of North American
 defense and only if the US is firmly com-
 mitted to the system. If the US appears to
 waver on AWACS for North American
 defense and West Germany continues to
 drag its feet on cost sharing in the NATO
 context, the Canadian defense minister,
 who is the strongest advocate of AWACS,
 will have trouble selling a project that the
 Canadian parliament rejected more than
 seven years ago.
 Financing Woes
 Overshadowing problems oFequipment
 selection is the question of financing the
 recognition of the need to strengthen the
 government's ability to handle a national
 1 emergency
 In addition, Canada must enforce its
 claimed sovereignty over the 200-mile
 fishing zones declared in January. Ot-
 tawa's purchase of 18 new long-range
 patrol aircraft last year was designed in
 part to provide coverage of the new
 fishing zones. Most of Canada's warships
 are not geared to patrolling the zones.
 Defense Priorities
 fhe broad question of'defense priorities
 remains a major headache for military
 planners. The many lean years of
 aretaker budgeting has left almost every
 >>omponert of the armed forces under-
 :;quipped, poorly trained, and generally
 tlacking the manpower to perform ef-
 ficiently. Defense Minister Danson, who
 look over the portfolio last fall, has had
 riot only to grapple with choosing between
 :zir-  and  sea-oriented procurement
 programs, but also with selecting the
 equipment for each.
 The decision to opt for new fighter air-
 craft was taken to maximize the visible
 and political impact of the increased
 defense spending. The Canadians want an
 interceptor that could go into service
 within a relatively short time. In the
 meantime, the government can point to
 Page   12
 modernization program. The defense
 budget for the fiscal year that began April
 I calls for outlays totaling $3.8 billion.
 Capital expenditures for new equipment
 will increase almost 25 percent (about one
 half of which is lost to inflation) over the
 previous year.
 The budget includes $2.5 million for
 aircraft and ship procurement programs,
 just enough to get them started. No
 money is set aside for increasing man-
 power above the present 78,000, although
 defense  and  cabinet officials  agree
 another 5,000 persons are needed to bring
 the armed forces up to minimum manning

 In the negotiations for a new international sugar agree-
 ment that begin next week, producers will probably not be able
 to raise prices much above the present low level. Production is
 continuing to increase, stocks are already high, and sugar sub-
 stitutes are making inroads in the market.
 International negotiations to set
 minimum prices for sugar will begin in
 Geneva on April 18. The world sugar
 market has been characterized by low
 prices, record production, and a growing
 surplus since the end of the crop year last
 August. There is little prospect of higher
 prices this year; with nearly three quarters
 of the world harvest completed, record
 sugar production of about 87 million tons
 has been forecast.
 For the third consecutive year, sugar
 production will outstrip world consump-
 tion-estimated to be 83 million tons this
 year. Although up 4 percent from last
 year, consumption is still below the
 long-term trend established before the
 record sugar price increase of 1974.
 The largest production gains were made
 this year in Brazil where output was up
 almost 20 percent. Production also in-
 creased in Africa and Asia. Small declines
 have occurred in North America and
 Eastern Europe.
 Most of the consumption increase is oc-
 curring in the developing countries. In the
 developed countries, growth in sugar con-
 sumption is being slowed by market
 saturation and competition from other
 sweeteners,  particularly high  fructose
 corn syrup. This product is both cheaper
 and less caloric than sugar.
 Reserve Stocks and Prices
 World sugar stocks should reach a
 record 24 million tons by August 31. Most
 stocks are held by exporters, although
 some major importing countries-China,
 Japan, and the US-have recently in-
 The World Sugar Market
 creased their reserves.
 The prospect of a large carryover-29
 percent of annual consumption-con-
 tinues to depress prices despite recent
 large purchases by China and the USSR.
 Since December, China reportedly has
 purchased between 600,000 and 1 million
 tons of sugar for 1977 delivery. The
 USSR purchased 600,000 tons from the
 Philippines in January for early 1977
 delivery.
 For the past six months, prices for
 world raw sugar have hovered between 7
 and 10 cents per pound, the lowest level
 since 1972. The current price-about 10
 cents per pound-is 40 percent below that
 of a year ago. Prices now are considerably
 below sugar production costs in the US,
 as well as in some of the less efficient cane
 producing countries of Central and South
 America.
 Current plans for planting do not in-
 dicate a large reduction in world sugar
 acreage for the 1977-78 harvest. Although
 low prices have encouraged acreage
 reductions by farmers in the EC, the
 Philippines, and the US, growers in
 Eastern Europe, Cuba, and Australia will
 probably  increase  acreage.  Unless
 weather conditions prove unfavorable,
 world production next year is likely to
 equal or exceed this year's record level,
 keeping prices down.
 Negotiations for New Agreement
 In Geneva next week, exporting coun-
 tries will be pressing for a guaranteed
 minimum price that reflects their claimed
 cost of production. An organization of
 Latin   American  sugar producers ac-
 counting for about 50 percent of free
 market exports has indicated that mem-
 bers will push for a minimum price of
 15 cents per pound.
 Other major exporters-the Philip-
 pines, Thailand, India, Australia, and
 South Africa-will probably support this
 floor price.
 Any agreement would probably require

 US adherence to be successful. As the
 world's largest importer, the US is the
 dominant force in the sugar market, ac-
 counting for 25 to 30 percent of free
 market imports.
 EC participation in a new agreement
 probably is also essential. The EC ac-
 counts for 12 percent of world production
 and is a net exporter; at the same time, it
 has  an  agreement  with  the
 African-Caribbean-Pacific countries to
 import 1.3 million tons a year. The EC is
 willing to participate in the negotiations,
 but has been unwilling to soften its op-
 position to export quotas, favoring in-
 stead a buffer-stock arrangement. Most
 coun.ries involved in the negotiations
 favor some form of quota system,
 although they are in conflict over the
 assiglment of quotas. The producers
 probably cannot get the 15-cent minimum
 they would like. A minimum price of 10 to
 12 cents per pound is more likely.
 Changes in US sugar policy also could
 further dampen world prices. If the US
 should adopt import quotas along the
 restrictive lines recommended by the US
 International Trade Commission, an ad-
 ditional 575,000 to 725,000 tons of sugar
 could be forced onto the world market.
 Such  import restrictions would meet
 strong opposition from exporters in Cen-
 tral and South America and the Philip-
 pines.
 Sugar Substitutes
 The continuing growth in the use of
 high fructose corn syrup will limit growth
 in sugar consumption in the developed
 countries. This product can be substituted
 directly for sugar in most industrial uses,
 and sales would jump if sugar prices were
 to rise significantly. The syrup is pro-
 duced almost exclusively in the industrial-
 ized nations and has become a serious
 threat to sugar industries in the EC and
 Japan as well as in the US.
 The EC has become so concerned over
 the threat to the sugar industry that it has
 proposed  that  member  countries
 eliminate subsidies on cornstarch produc-
 tion, disallow tax benefits to high fructose
 plant construction, and regulate imports
 and exports of the substitute product.
 According to trade studies, a sugar
 price increase to a level of 13 to 15 cents
 per pound would provide an umbrella for
 the high fructose industry and speed ex-
 pansion if corn prices remain close to
 current levels.
 A ban on saccharin by the US and
 Canada, if implemented, would have only
 a minimal effect on boosting sugar con-
 sumption. The soft drink industry would
 probably switch from saccharin to high
 fructose corn syrup and other low calorie
 substitutes. Medically handicapped in-
 dividuals still must consume low calorie
 The pervasive Soviet role in Somalia puts important
 restraints on President Siad's hopes to improve relations with
 the Arabs and the US, but some change is likely over time.
 Somali President Siad has apparently
 begun to question the close ties his coun-
 try has developed with the Soviets. For
 years, the USSR has been Somalia's
 primary source of arms and military
 training, aid for economic development,
 advanced education for young Somalis,
 technical expertise for the civil
 bureaucracy, and the ideological under-
 pinning for the Siad regime's "scientific
 Somalia: Looking for New Friends
 socialism." But now the Somali leader is
 bitter over what he considers Soviet
 duplicity in expanding ties with Ethiopia,
 Somalia's traditional rival for influence in
 the Horn of Africa. Siad appears to
 believe that the Soviets take him too
 much for granted.
 Somalia turned to the Soviets in the
 first place to receive the arms and training
 needed to take on Ethiopia; from Siad's
 standpoint, any effort by the USSR to
 Page          14    WEEKLY SUMMARY
 restrain Somalia from trying to regain its
 "lost territory" runs counter to the very
 purpose of having close ties to the USSR.
 Saudi Arabia is actively seeking to exploit
 Somalia's grievances against the USSR.
 It is leading moderate Arab efforts to
 wean Somalia away from the Soviets and
 has offered money and petroleum as in-
 ducements.
 In his recent speeches, Siad has taken
 to emphasizing Somalia's Arab character
 and expressing a willingness to cooperate

 Stk;Ht I
 with Arab states irrespective of their
 domestic social and economic systems.
 He has maintained balance by calling the
 Soviets "true friends," but his statements
 that  Somalia  differentiates  between
 ideology and national interests in deter-
 mining foreign policy are a clear warning
 to the Soviets that he will not be their
 puppet on issues vital to Somalia.
 Siad's Internal Position
 Siad's internal position is secure
 enough to allow him to make adjustments
 in Somalia's relations with the USSR.
 The regime is stable and, although
 pockets of opposition remain, Siad has
 consolidated his personal power over the
 past year. He must consult with other key
 leaders before making important
 decisions, but most of his colleagues are
 likely to support loosening ties with the
 USSR, drawing closer to the moderate
 Arabs, and improving relations with the
 West. The military as a whole is also like-
 ly to support such policies.
 The more pro-Soviet members of the
 ruling hierarchy are not strong enough to
 block such a shift or to move against Siad.
 General Samantar, the defense minister
 and first vice president, is the main Soviet
 sympathizer, and his personal power was
 reduced in a government reshuffle in
 February.
 Most Somalis would welcome
 strengthening ties with the Arabs at the
 expense of the Soviet relationship.
 Socialism may be making headway
 among younger, educated Somalis, but
 the population remains overwhelmingly
 conservative and Muslim. The Soviet ad-
 visers in Somalia are often seen as con-
 descending and arrogant.
 Restraints of Siacl's Actions
 Nevertheless, Siad's freedom to reduce
 Somalia's heavy reliance: on the Soviets is
 limited. Soviet advisers play an important
 role in both the armed forces and the civil
 bureaucracy. They provide more than
 broad advice; they are involved in day-to-
 day administrative affairs. It would be
 costly for the government and the armed
 forces were these advisers withdrawn or
 substantially reduced.
 Close Soviet ties, moreover, fill a need

 Somali Defense Minister Samantar with Politburo members Arkhipov (1) and Ponomarev (c),following aid
 discussions in Moscow last August
 the way to social and economic develop-
 ment. He is capable of making tactical
 adjustments in implementing his program
 for building a socialist society, but he
 would be uncomfortable trying to become
 too closely aligned with moderate Arab
 states like Saudi Arabia.
 The armed forces' reliance on Soviet
 military equipment is one of the most im-
 portant restraints on making a dramatic
 change. The Somalis are searching for
 alternative sources of supply and may
 eventually obtain small arms and other
 limited amounts of aid from other
 sources, but they cannot hope for enough
 large and sophisticated equipment to end
 their dependence on the Soviets. The
 Egyptians might be able to provide some
 Soviet equipment, but they are not in a
 positicn to send large amounts or to sus-
 tain a now of parts and ammunition.
 Replacing Soviet equipment with arms
 purchased from Western countries-paid
 for with Saudi money-would probably
 take several years and require a reorienta-
 tion of military doctrine. There would
 also be a degradation of military capabili-
 ty while the changeover is taking place.
 The Somalis would be reluctant to risk
 this while they are facing the possibility of
 a conflict with Ethiopia over the French
 Territory of the Afars and Issas and the
 Ogaden region of Ethiopia.
 Siad would have to weigh carefully the
 military reaction to changes in Somalia's
 sources of military supply. The military
 hierarchy would  probably approve a
 broadening of Somalia's military and
 political relations, but would probably not
 support an abrupt break with the Soviets
 and perhaps not even a gradual transition
 to more reliance on other sources.
 The Soviets' View
 The Soviets apparently miscalculated
 Somalia's reaction to their expanding ties
 with Ethiopia. They view Ethiopia, with
 its greater population and economic
 resources, as potentially the more impor-
 tant country in the Horn of Africa and
 one that in the future will probably play
 an important role in African affairs. They
 may not have realized that they would of-
 fend Siad to the extent that they have,
 calculating that Somali suspicions could
 be overcome with assurances that Soviet
 weapons given Ethiopia would not be used
 against Somalis.
 In  spite of recent problems,
 Soviet-Somali relations remain mutually
 beneficial. Soviet President Podgorny's
 Page          16
 recent visit to Somalia demonstrates con-
 tinued  high-level  Soviet  interest  in
 Somalia. It is doubtful that either country
 will take hasty action in the near term to
 end their close ties. The Soviets will reluc-
 tantly tolerate a Somali opening to the
 Arabs and the West so long as Somalia
 takes no action to jeopardize Soviet
 access to the Soviet naval and com-
 munications facilities at Berbera.
 In the absence of a clear alternative to
 Siad in the Somali leadership, the Soviets
 will probably try to mend their relations
 with him. It would be counterproductive
 to try to mobilize sentiment against Siad
 in the Somali military solely on the basis
 of loosening ties with Moscow.
 The Somalis probably have the most to
 lose from an abrupt termination of the
 relationship. Soviet naval air operations
 in the Indian Ocean area would be severe-
 ly hampered by the loss of access to
 Somali airfields, but overall Soviet naval
 operations in the Indian Ocean could con-
 tinue without the use of Somali facilities,
 although at some expense. A sudden
 withdrawal of Soviet military support for
 Somalia, however, would cause a swift
 decline in Somali military capabilities.
