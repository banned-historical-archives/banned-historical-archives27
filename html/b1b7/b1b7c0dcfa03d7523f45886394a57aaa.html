 This paper is based upon investigations of the modus
 operandi and organization of covert Sino-Soviet bloc political
 action and psychological warfare operations in countries of
 the Free World.  The term "covert political action and
 psychological warfare" as used here refers to clandestine
 operations which are conducted for the purpose of influencing
 public and/or governmental opinion in the target countries
 along the lines desired by the Bloc.  It does not apply to
 activities and propaganda which are overtly attributable to
 Communist parties or front groups, or to operations con-
 ducted solely for the purpose of collecting intelligence on
 behalf of Bloc governments.
 One of the classic tools of covert psychological warfare
 is black propaganda of the type known as "deception" or
 "misinformation".  A device used for this purpose is the
 forged document which offers seemingly incontrovertible
 evidence of a "fact" or set of "facts" which the forger wants
 his target audience to believe. It is to this aspect of covert
 Bloc psychological warfare- -propaganda by forgery-- that
 the present study is devoted.  Propaganda by forgery is not
 by any means new in Bloc operations, but a noticeable
 increase in its use in 1957 and 1958 led to an intensive
 investigation of the subject.  This study covers interna-
 tionally-distributed forgeries only.  It does not touch upon
 the equally important subject of propaganda forgeries which
 are targeted at a single country and are surfaced and
 replayed within that country only.  Such forgeries appear
 from time to time in various parts of the world.  West
 Germany, in particular, has been flooded with them during
 the past few years.

 black propaganda in the field of foreign affairs (as
 distinguished from ideological CP propaganda) is a function
 of the foreign intelligence services of the Bloc countries,
 closely directed by high-echelon units of the Communist
 Party.  The skill with which recently noted internationally-
 distributed forgeries have been delivered to their target
 audiences and the highly complex pattern of overt, covert,
 and semi-covert and official media used to deliver these
 materials make it evident that such international
 campaigns are centrally directed and raise the possibility
 that a single, central unit plans and prepares these forged
 documents.  More information on this point is needed,
 however, before definite conclusions can be drawn.
 As this study is written, what seems to be a break-
 through in our knowledge of Soviet covert political action
 and psychological warfare operations, including propa-
 ganda forgeries, has been actualized.

 II - CASES OF DISCOVERED FORGERIES
 In the period of 1 January 1957 to 1 July 1959, a
 total of thirty-six forgeries of known or apparent Soviet
 bloc origin were distributed to targets outside the
 countries in which they first appeared.  Annex 1
 lists these documents, in chronological order of surfacing.
 As indicated therein, the thirty-six forgeries appeared as
 follows:

 Multiple-Forgery Campaigns
 1.   An odd characteristic of the 1957-59 forgeries is
 that they rarely come singly.  Of the total of
 thirty-six known forgeries, thirty were clearly
 established by their content (and frequently by
 Bloc editorial comment as well) as preludes to or
 "confirmation" of other forgeries.  Following
 these lines of interconnection, these thirty
 individual forgeries emerge as the component
 parts of ten separate multiple-forgery campaigns.
 The campaigns are listed in tabular form in
 Annex 2.

 2.          The Berry Letter Campaign
 The method in which a multiple-forgery campaign
 is developed is illustrated by the Berry Letter
 Campaign, which began with a series of remarks
 made by Nikita Khrushchev in November 1957.  By
 the time of its final replay in December 1958, it
 had involved the surfacing of no less than seven
 separate forgeries.  (Whether the Khrushchev
 role was planned as the first step in the campaign
 or whether his statements were simply drawn upon
 by the Berry Letter writer as idea material is
 unknown.)
 In the TASS release quoting Khrushchev's
 interview of 22 November 1957 wtih three
 American journalists (William Randolph
 Hearst, Jr., Frank Conniff and Robert
 Considine), Khrushchev was quoted as saying:
 "I would like to express my views with regard
 to statements made by certain representatives
 of military circles and published in the press.
 It was reported that, allegedly, a part of the
 American bomber force, with hydrogen and
 atomic bombs, is constantly in the air and
 always ready to strike against the Soviet
 Union.  Reports have it that one-half of the
 planes are in the air.  This is very dangerous.
 Such a situation serves as an illustration of
 the extent of the military psychosis in the

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 United States. When planes with hydrogen
 bombs take off that means that many people
 will be in the air piloting them.  There is
 always the possibility of a mental blackout
 when the pilot may take the slightest signal
 as a signal for action and fly to the target
 that he had been instructed to fly to.  Under
 such conditions a war may start purely by
 chance, since retaliatory action would be
 taken immediately.  Does this not go to show
 that in such a case a war may start as a
 result of sheer misunderstanding, a derange-
 ment in the normal psychic state of a person,
 which may happen to anybody?  Such a
 horrible possibility must be excluded.  It may
 be that both sides will be against war, and yet
 war may still start as a result of the military
 psychosis whipped up in the United States....
 Even if only one plane with one atomic or one
 hydrogen bomb were in the air, in this case,
 too, it would be not the Government but the
 pilot who could decide the question of war."

 Basic Forgery:  The Berry Letter
 Some five months after the above interview, on
 7 May 1958, the official East German Com-
 munist Party (SED) daily Neues Deutschland
 surfaced a letter purportedly written by
 Assistant Defense Secretary Frank B. Berry

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 to Defense Secretary Neil McElroy.  The
 letter stated that 67.3 per cent of all U. S.
 Air Force flight personnel had been found to
 be psychoneurotic, a condition which led to
 all sorts of phobias, unaccountable animosity
 and other irrational behavior.  It mentioned
 excessive drinking, drug-taking, sexual ex-
 cesses and perversions and constant card-
 playing as further evidence of the general break-
 down, adding that "moral depression is
 a typical condition of all crew members making
 flights with atomic and H-bombs. "  Annex 3
 is a copy of the Berry Letter as surfaced in.
 Neues Deutschland of 7 May 1958.
 First Supplement:  The Morgan Crash (True)
 Having thus provided "official evidence" that
 Khrushchev's "pilot who could decide the question
 of war" was, in two-thirds of all cases, men-
 tally unstable, the planners of the Berry Letter
 methodically supplied "examples".  The first was
 a plane crash in England, reported as a news item
 on 17 June 1958 and tied with the Berry Letter by
 Radio Moscow on 18 June.  (The crash, which
 actually occurred, is one of the rare instances in
 which a current news story has been picked up
 for use in replay of a previously-launched forgery.
 It involved an American plane mechanic named
 Vernon Morgan, who had managed to get into the
 air in a non-operational U. S. Air Force bomber
 which he was neither authorized nor qualified to
 fly.  The plane crashed shortly after takeoff,
 killing Morgan.  The incident had been reported
 in the press on 14 June, but was not picked up
 for Soviet propaganda use until three days later,
 as above. )

 Second Supplement:  The U. S. Pilot Letters
 (Four Forgeries)
 The next step in the campaign was taken on
 3 July 1958, when the Soviet Embassy in
 London released to the Western press and the
 British Foreign Office a letter purportedly
 written by a U. S. Air Force pilot stationed
 in England, in which the pilot threatened to
 drop an atomic bomb in the North Sea near
 England, in order to alert English opinion to
 the dangers of an accidentally-triggered
 nuclear war.  On 4 July Radio Moscow tied
 the letter to the Berry Letter and the Morgan
 crash.  The letter and the fact that it had been
 released by the Soviet Embassy attracted
 extensive comment in the non-Communist
 press throughout the Western world.  No
 doubt in the hope of repeating this delightful
 burst of publicity, the Soviet Embassy in
 London released two more  U. S. Pilot
 Letters" (along the same lines as the first
 but varying in detail) on 9 July, and still
 another on 15 September 1958.  These were
 virtually ignored by the press.
 Third Supplement:  The Power Order (Forgery
 in Allegation Form)
 On 2 October 1958 the campaign was given
 another push when Neues Deutschland published
 an article claiming that the indiscretion of a
 USAF officer stationed at Kaiserslautern, in

 West Germany, had disclosed the recent
 issuance of a secret order by Strategic Air
 Command (SAC) chief, General Power ,
 forbidding any flights over U. S. territory by
 planes carrying atomic or hydrogen bombs.
 Bloc replay promptly tied this (non-existent)
 order to the Berry Letter.
 Fourth Supplement: Content of the Forged
 Schlagzeug Envelope
 In December 1958 the Berry Letter campaign
 received what seems to have been its final
 replay, in a booklet mailed "black" in West
 Germany.   Forged copies of the mailing
 envelopes used by a bona fide West German
 periodical named Schlagzeug were mailed in
 West Germany, to an estimated 4, 000
 addressees.  They were accurate forgeries of
 the real Schlagzeug envelope except for one
 detail:  they carried a West Berlin return
 address which, on investigation, proved to be
 a vacant lot. The envelopes contained an overt
 East German propaganda booklet, with the
 address of the Kulturverlag der Deutschen
 Jugend (Publishing House for German Youth) in
 East Berlin.  The booklet was devoted to a
 suggested "culture program", giving songs,
 skits, and the like, for use as an amateur
 theatrical performance.  One of the songs,
 printed complete with score for piano
 accompaniment, was a direct tribute to the
 Berry Letter.  Freely translated, it ran:

 And what can happen--

 3.   The ten multiple-forgery campaigns show some
 indication of a pattern of annual targeting for 1957
 and 1958. As shown by the content and the
 emphasis in replay of each campaign, they have
 been targeted primarily as follows:
 Target
 1957
 1958
 Worldwide
 1
 1
 Middle East/Africa
 1
 2
 Asia
 1
 1
 Europe
 1
 2
 Thus, of the total of ten campaigns surfaced
 in the period 1957-59, five have been targeted at
 Middle Eastern and Asian audiences and two at
 worldwide audiences, making a total of seven of
 the ten campaigns targeted wholly or in part at
 audiences in the industrially underdeveloped areas
 of the world, while five of the six single forgeries
 were targeted at Asian and African audiences.
 During this period there has been occasional
 replay of propaganda forgeries to audiences in
 North and Latin America, but no forgeries have
 been reported as surfaced in or targeted primarily
 at countries of the Western Hemisphere.
 B.    Single-Forge Campaigns
 Of the six forgeries which were launched singly,
 one (the O'Shaughnessy Letter) was established by its
 subject and by certain operational details as part of

 a known East German IS operation.  The other five
 were overtly launched and thereafter died on the vine,
 with little or no subsequent replay.
 C.   Forgeries in 1959
 No new forgery campaigns appeared during the
 first half of 1959, although three new forgeries were
 surfaced in continuance of two of the 1958 campaigns
 and one new single forgery wxs launched.  Replay on
 certain of the campaigns begun in 1957 and 1958 also
 continued during the first half of 1959, as shown in
 the final column of Annex 2.
 D.   Descriptions of Specific Forgery Campaigns
 The known propaganda forgeries which were
 internationally distributed during the period of this
 study are described, by target area, in Annexes
 4 through 7.

 A.   Political Objectives
 The political objective of the 1957-59 forgeries,
 viewed as a whole, can be defined simply:  creation
 of a climate of Governmental and public opinion which
 will tend to (a) break up the Western Alliance and
 (b) discredit the West in general and the United States
 in particular.
 The specific objective of each of the propaganda
 forgeries has been readily identifiable by its content
 and timing, and often by accompanying Bloc editorial
 comment, as an effort to supply "documentary
 confirmation" of propaganda charges which were
 being made at the same period through conventional
 Bloc media.  The Berry Letter, for example, "proved"
 the unreliability of individual U. S. pilots in the midst
 of a Bloc propaganda campaign against the flights of
 the Strategic Air Command (SAC).  The Rockefeller
 Letter "confirmed" chronic Bloc charges of U.S.
 imperialistic aims, while its Dulles Memorandum
 supplement "proved" that the recently announced
 Eisenhower Doctrine on the Middle East -- a major
 current target of conventional Bloc propaganda -- was
 simply a local step in implementing the worldwide
 U.S. imperialist policy.
 As the content descriptions in Annexes 4 through
 7 show, the specific propaganda objectives of the
 1957-59 forgeries have included:

 a.   U. S. imperialistic aims (Rockefeller
 Letter Campaign);
 b.   Charges made in the chronic "U.S.
 plots" and "Western plots" propaganda
 (Taipeh Cables, Frost Letter and
 Rountree Circular campaigns and
 several of the single forgeries);
 c.   Current propaganda charges concerning
 the SAC flights as a danger to world
 peace (Berry Letter Campaign);
 d.   U.S. plans for large-scale military
 aggression (U.S. Soldier in Lebanon
 Campaign);
 e.   Eftorts of a belligerent U.S. to sabotage
 plans for a Summit Conference (Summit
 Conference Directive);
 Bloc efforts to:
 a.   Fan U.S. and Arab distrust of France
 and Israel (Secret Strategic Plan
 Campaign);
 b.   Fan French and British distrust of the
 U. S. and, secondarily, of West Germany
 (Hoover Letter Campaign and the
 O'Shaughnessy Letter);

 c.   Discredit anti-Communist emigre leaders
 and the U. S. in particular, and the West
 in general, in the eyes of Bloc nationals
 and emigres (Ceske Slovo Campaign).
 Presentation of the propaganda message within
 each of the forged documents is far from subtle.  An
 example is the Hoover Letter.  The forgery itself is
 a long, rambling document, but its message appears
 succinctly in the opening paragraphs, which (a) estab-
 lish that the writer is offering the addressee a job and
 is making the offer on behalf of the U. S. Government,
 and (b) define the job:  "You will never persuade me
 that we might find a better person to work on the
 project.  Do you seriously believe that there is some-
 one else who would know how to grab and hold on to the
 good old Sahara Desert the way you would?  They
 think highly of you in Washington and give your abilities
 full credit.  I don't have to tell you about the impor-
 tance of African oil."
 To avoid any possibility that target audiences
 might miss the point, replay comment usually explains
 it again and as bluntly as possible.  Continuing with
 the Hoover Letter as an example, Radio Moscow
 explained in replay that the letter showed "the desire
 of the U. S. monopolies to seize control of oil wherever
 it is found in the Middle East, and that the State
 Department gives them all possible aid."     The con-
 tent of the letter itself made its primary targeting at
 France clear, but to be sure the message was not
 lost on this audience, Radio Moscow broadcast a
 comment in French citing the letter as proof that

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 "the United States desires to prevent France from
 settling her disputes in North Africa in order that the
 U. S. may take over the resources there. "
 Another example of editorial lily-gilding is
 provided by Bloc comment on the Rockefeller Letter.
 The forgery itself was purportedly a plan for
 achieving U. S. domination of the world, in part
 through military alliances but primarily through
 economic aid programs.  In surfacing the letter on
 15 February 1957, Neues Deutschland supplied its
 own paragraph headings for the various sections of
 the letter.  These included:
 "American Prestige Catastrophically Fallen"
 "What Is Good for Standard Oills Good for U.S.A."
 "Iranian Foreign Policy under U. S. Control"
 "Economic 'Help' Draws Military Pacts after It"
 "Forcing Neutral States in Direction of U. S.
 Wishes"
 "Bring Colonies of Others under U. S. Control"
 "Re 'Selflessness' of U. S. Assistance".
 Comment in a later replay by the East German
 press agency ADN was equally forthright in explain-
 ing the ideas the forgery was expected to convey:
 "Rockefeller's letter to Eisenhower is causing a
 stir throughout the world.  Indignation at the plans
 for brutal enslavement and oppression, hidden
 behind what is termed aid, is running particularly
 high in the countries receiving U. S. economic 'aid'."

 Radio Moscow, in a broadcast in Indonesian to
 Southeast Asian audiences, also removed all danger
 that its listeners might miss the propaganda point,
 by explaining that the Rockefeller Letter "shows that
 the imperialist interests of Rockefeller and other
 U. S. billionaires decide the direction of the foreign
 policy of the U. S. Government, which is the
 fascistic executor of their wishes. "
 B.     The "Secret Documents" Used
 1. Form in Which Surfaced
 A propaganda forgery may be surfaced in any of
 three forms:
 a.   Facsimile reproduction.  Annexes 3 (copy
 of the Berry Letter) and 9 (copy of the
 Rountree Circular) are examples of this form
 of surfacing.  Used in twenty-two of the
 thirty- six forgeries.
 b.   Verbatim quotation of the text of the alleged
 documents, with no effort at facsimile pre-
 sentation.  Annex 8 (copy of the Dulles
 Memorandum) is an example.  Used in six of
 the thirty-six forgeries.
 c.   Allegation only, i.e., disclosure of the details
 of the alleged document, with no attempt at
 either facsimile reproduction or verbatim
 quotation.  Annex 10 (copy of the Bishop
 Directive) is an example of this type.  While

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 an unsupported allegation is not, strictly
 speaking, a forgery, the surfacing and relay
 system used for these forgeries-by-allega-
 tion is the same as for the other two types.
 Allegation of the existence of the document
 in question is sometimes a prelude to sur-
 facing in one of the other two forms, while
 in other cases the campaign may run its full
 course on the basis of the allegation alone.
 Used in eight of the thirty-six forgeries.
 2.   Types of "Secret Documents" Fabricated
 Of the thirty-six separate forgeries, twenty-
 seven were supposedly written by or to U. S.
 nationals:
 Twelve (cables, dispatches, letters) pur-
 porting to be correspondence between the
 State Department and its diplomatic
 missions abroad (OtShaughnessy Letter,
 Bishop Directive, the five Taipeh Cables,
 Bruce Letter, Summit Directive,
 Rountree Circular, Directive.on UAR
 and the Murphy Letter)
 Two purporting to be internal U. S. Govern-
 ment letters or memoranda (Dulles
 Memorandum to President Eisenhower
 and Berry Letter to Defense Secretary
 McElroy)

 Two semi-official letters by former U. S.
 Government officials (Rockefeller Letter
 to President Eisenhower and Hoover
 Letter to a U. S. oil company executive)
 Four letters or other correspondence between
 U. S. officials and foreign nationals
 (Kishi Dulles Pact, Sjamsuddin Letter to
 Ambassador MacArthur, Frost Letter to
 the Indonesian rebel leader Kawilarang,
 and Chiang Kai Shek Letter to President
 Eisenhower)
 Seven letters or verbal indiscretions of U. S.
 military personnel abroad (four U. S.
 Pilot Letters, "John H" Letter, Powers
 Order and U. S. Paratrooper Cables).
 Of the remaining nine forgeries, five have
 purported to be internal documents of other
 Western and pro-Western Governments (French/
 Israeli General Staff Plan; Secret Strategic Plan
 of the Israeli Army; Erhard Letter to West
 German Chancellor Adenauer; Sudan Government
 Documents and Welensky Document).
 The other four were the three forgeries
 comprising the Ceske Slovo Campaign (one forged
 issue of an emigre newspaper and two series of
 letters purportedly written by the editor of the
 same periodical) and the forged Schlagzeug (West
 German periodical) mailing envelope which
 carried the last known replay on the Berry Letter.

 C.         Source Materials
 A typical Bloc propaganda forgery consists of two
 distinct sets of source material:  a framework of
 overt fact, used to give verisimilitude to the forgery,
 and the fictional statements which convey the propa-
 ganda message.
 1.  Fact. The factual material may include any or
 all of several kinds of data:
 Names and titles of the purported writer, the
 addressee and any other persons who may be
 mentioned in the document.  A frequent
 practice is the inclusion, either in the forgery
 itself or in accompanying editorial comment,
 of the full name and title of the purported
 writer and addressee.   Thus, a NCNA
 (Chinese Communist press agency) news
 release replaying the Frost Letter begins,
 "Bintang Timur today published a letter sent
 by Rear Admiral Laurence Frost, Chief of
 the U. S. Naval Intelligence Bureau, to
 Kawilarang, one of the ringleaders of the
 rebel clique, "  and then explained that
 "Kawilarang was the former Indonesian
 Military Attache to Washington."  In sur-
 facing the Power  Order (allegation only),
 Neues Deutschland identified "General Thomas
 Power , Commander of the Strategic Air
 Command of the United States," as originator
 of the order.  The Berry Letter is signed
 "Frank B. Berry, M. D., Assistant Secretary
 of Defense (Health and Medical);"etc.

 Place names and names of organizational units.
 The Berry Letter refers to USAF bases on
 Midway Island and to the Patuxent River and
 Cooke bases.  The "John H" Letter identifies
 its purported writer as a member of the 79th
 Engineers.  The Rockefeller Letter mentions
 "the discussions at Camp David which re-
 sulted in my resignation;" etc.
 Official format, if the forgery is presented as a
 Government cable, dispatch or memorandum.
 (See Annex 11, which is a copy of one of the
 Taipeh Cables as surfaced in Blitz, and
 Annexes 3, the Berry Letter, and 9, the
 Rountree Circular.)
 References to recent news items, used in the
 body of the forged document or in accompanying
 editorial comment.  The "John H" Letter
 states, "I arrived from Munich July 27 by
 Globemaster with a group of the U. S. Army. "
 (The forgery itself was based upon the landing
 of U. S. troops in Lebanon, and the world
 press of the period was full of details of their
 transportation by air from West Germany.)
 In surfacing the Dulles Memorandum, Neues
 Deutschland explained editorially that the
 document had been written "in the last half of
 December /1956_/, just after the NATO meeting
 in Paris".  (NATO had held a widely publi-
 cized meeting in Paris at that time.  The Camp
 David talks between President Eisenhower
 and Nelson A. Rockefeller, mentioned in the
 Rockefeller Letter, had taken place and had
 been reported in the press. )

 Statements the purported writer has actually made
 in speeches, press conferences, magazine
 articles, etc., or statements published by
 other individuals which might plausibly be
 attributed to him.  An example of this occurs
 in the Rockefeller Letter.  On 5 December
 1955 the New York Times carried a front-
 page article in which this paragraph appears:
 "Although economic and technical aid in
 the underdeveloped countries has been
 running at more than one billion dollars a
 year, more than half has been concentrated
 in three places where military-political,
 rather than economic factors are controlling.
 These are South Korea, Formosa and South
 Vietnam. "
 The Rockefeller Letter, surfaced 15 Feb-
 ruary 1957, contained this paragraph:
 "Although, for instance, economic and
 technical aid to underdeveloped countries
 last year amounted to more than one billion
 dollars, more than half of this sum was
 actually devoted to three countries in which
 military and political rather than economic
 considerations were the determining factors.
 These countries were South Korea, Formosa
 and South Vietnam. "
 Names and addresses needed for operational use.
 Still another type of factual data used is, of

 course, the names and addresses of target
 individuals when the forgery is to be surfaced
 by covert mailing rather than by overt means.
 Target addresses for use in "black" mailing
 of psychological warfare material are known
 to be obtained by the East German IS (and,
 presumably, by the Soviet IS as well) through
 overt research facilities--telephone direc-
 tories, diplomatic lists, names and addresses
 culled from local newspapers, overt direc-
 tories of government units, from lists of
 foreigners visiting Bloc countries, etc.
 Others are known, in the case of East
 Germany, to be obtained from East German
 intelligence agents travelling in the West.  In
 the one known Czech intelligence operation
 discussed in this paper (the Ceske Slovo
 Campaign), mailing addresses were obtained
 by burglarizing the offices of the real
 Ceske Slovo and making off with its sub-
 scription list.
 The overt material used in Bloc forgeries is
 culled from an enormous supply of research
 material:  newspapers, books and periodicals of
 all nations, diplomatic lists, telephone and other
 published directories, overt information hand-
 outs of Western official units, and so forth.  The
 extent of Bloc overt-materials research facilities
 is established not only by the factual detail used
 to embellish the propaganda forgeries but also
 by the content of conventional Bloc radio and
 printed propaganda.  Books such as The State of
 Israel--Its Situation and Policies (see paragraph

 C-9 of Section IV) are built by stringing together
 quotations--usually out of context and occa-
 sionally false--from a fantastic number of
 published non-Bloc sources ranging from the
 world's major newspapers to obscure local books
 and brochures. - the overt evidence in                  25X1 C5b
 itself leaves no room for doubt as to the method        25X1 C5b
 and extent of Bloc research of this type-               25X1 C5b
 2.  Fiction.  The fictional statements which constitute
 the raison d'etre of any forgery obviously have
 the writer's own imagination as their immediate
 source.   The ideas which these statements are
 intended to. convey, however, are those of the
 Bloc propaganda themes of the period.
 An interesting note on the general guide lines
 which give rise to specific Bloc forgery texts was
 provided by an editorial comment in the Neues
 Deutschland article in which the Rockefeller
 Letter was surfaced:  "Lenin made the important
 remark that one of the tasks of Communists in
 dealing with questions of international politics
 is to reveal the secret of the origin of wars to
 the masses.  We were guided by this remark
 when we published the text of the secret letter of
 Nelson Rockefeller to Eisenhower.  From the pen
 of the scion of the blood-stained Rockefeller

 dynasty the world learns the secret of how
 people are robbed of their national sovereignty
 and independence and brought. under the sway of
 the U.S. monopolies in order to help in a U.S. -
 instigated war for world domination."  With the
 substitution of "we wrote" for "we published",
 this statement furnishes a succinct explanation of
 the thinking which produces a specific Communist
 propaganda forgery.
 In the interest of verisimilitude, fictional
 embellishments are frequently added in the editorial
 comment which accompanies overt surfacing
 and replay of the forgeries.  One example of this
 was the Blitz article on the worries of Ambas-
 sador Rankin, which served as prelude to the
 Taipeh Cables series (see Annex 6).  Another
 was the "news item" supplied in a Delhi Times
 replay of the Berry Letter and subsequently
 included in a TASS English-language release.
 The comment read:  "As is always the case in
 such circumstances, an intensified search is being
 carried on to find the source of leakage of the infor-
 mation which is so unfavorable to U. S. strategic
 aviation.  Judging from rumors circulating in Wash-
 ington,  Berry remains beyond suspicion and will
 keep his post, but there is every possibility of some-
 body from the Defense Department being forced to
 leave Government service."
 Still another kind of fictional embellishment
 was noted in at least one of the 1957-59 forgeries:

 the use within a forgery of statements from non-
 Bloc psychological warfare programs which
 happen to be untrue but which have been published
 frequently enough within the primary target area
 that the audience might be expected to regard
 them as fact.  The ins tance noted was the follow-
 ing statement, in the Hoover Letter:  "Now as to
 your doubts on the political side of this matter
 and primarily the attitude of the French to all
 this business, I must say that they proved far
 more conciliatory than we expected as regards
 our participation in exploiting Sahara oil.  Though
 the row that occurred last fall, because they
 managed to seize some documents compromising
 ARAMCO, made Paris more capricious in
 selecting partners, it did not, however, close
 the Sahara to us.  (Editorial note:  In the fall of
 1956, a plane carrying five leaders of the
 Algerian national liberation movement was
 detained by the French authorities.  Searches
 made of the five Algerians, who were subsequently
 arrested, revealed documents exposing the
 intrigues of U. S. oil trusts, especially that of
 the Arabian American Oil Co.)."
 The statement that the five Algerian leaders
 were arrested is true, and overt.  The editorial
 statement that search of the five "revealed
 documents exposing the intrigues of U. S. oil
 trusts, especially that of ARAMCO, " and the
 reference in the forgery itself to "the row that
 occurred last fall, because (the French) managed
 to seize some documents compromising

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 ARAMCO" are not true.  The arrest of the five
 Algerians was a cause celebre in France and
 North Africa in 1956, and the heated French
 press comment on the subject included a bit of
 psychological warfare misinformation on the part
 of the French nationalist Right in the form of a
 report--published in several Paris newspapers
 of the Right and Extreme Right--that documents
 compromising ARAMCO had been found on the
 Algerians.  There was, however, no "row"
 between the U. S. and French Governments on
 the subject, since the documents found on the
 men contained nothing which compromised
 ARA.MCO.    In view of the excellent psychological
 warfare facilities available to the French ultra-
 nationalist groups which had promoted the
 ARAMCO story, there is no reason to assume
 that the report itself had been a Bloc product,
 and the Bloc writer may even have used the tale
 in the Hoover Letter on the assumption that it
 was true.
 D.    Crudities and Errors
 There is no single clue which will lead infallibly
 to identification of an alleged secret document as a
 forgery. The forgeries which have been surfaced in
 facsimile or verbatim-text form, however, have all
 contained errors or evidences of operational care-
 lessness which have been of definite assistance in
 spotting them as forgeries.  The errors are not
 usually of a kind that would make the forged character
 of the document obvious to a lay reader and some--

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 such as use of a German-made typewriter for a
 "U.S. Government" document -- require specialized
 analysis.  No one error has been found to be common
 to all of the forgeries, but the errors and careless-
 ness have fallen into certain categories.
 The factual errors have been on points which
 would not normally have appeared in the press
 and would therefore be known to the agency in
 which the document purportedly originated but
 not to either the target audience or the overt-
 materials researcher.
 Examples:
 The Berry Letter was based upon an
 examination supposedly given to all USAF
 flight personnel and the statistics compiled
 as a result of that examination.  Fact: No
 such examination was given.
 The Berry Letter was supposedly signed
 by Dr. Berry on 27 March 1958.    Fact:
 Dr. Berry was away on an official trip on
 that date and could not have signed the
 letter even if he had written it.
 The Rockefeller Letter (see Annex
 12 for copy) contains many errors which
 would in themselves be sufficient to
 establish the document as fraudulent in the

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 eyes of anyone who was familiar with
 Mr. Rockefeller's own correspondence
 practices.  The forgery is a slipshod typing
 job, with ragged margins and several
 strikeovers, contains several errors in
 punctuation, spelling (such as "allienation")
 and grammar, and displays a rather uneven
 typing touch.  As it happens, Mr. Rockefeller's
 letters, public or private, are always written
 on an executive type electric typewriter and
 thus display a mechanically even touch.
 The copy is always clean, with no strikeovers,
 and particular care is taken in punctuation,
 spelling and grammar.  It also happens that
 Mr. Rockefeller dislikes frequent use of
 the pronoun "I"--a fact of which the writer
 of the forgery was obviously unaware.
 Each of the purported State Department and
 U. S. Embassy cables has looked more or less
 like the real thing.  None of them, however, has
 been a good enough forgery of the cable form
 itself to pass even a casual inspection by anyone
 familiar with the forms in question.
 Examples:
 The Taipeh Cables (see Annex 11)
 show ignorance of the use of a "Control
 Number", and placing of the message numbers
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 is incorrect.  The text is written in a
 leisurely, chatty style which might be
 found in a dispatch but would be unusual
 in a cable.
 The Rountree Circular (see Annex 9)
 did a little better on the "Control Number"
 but managed to include an impressive
 number of errors of its own:
 The document was dated 17 April 1958,
 and classified "CONFIDENTIAL/
 SECURITY INFORMATION".  This
 classification was discontinued on
 10 November 1953.
 It purported to be a cable, but its text
 called it a "circular letter". The
 Department uses a form of correspondence
 called a "circular instruction", but such
 correspondence is not transmitted by
 cable.  There is no such thing as a
 "circular letter" in Department nomen-
 clature.
 The purported numbering bears no rela-
 tionship to the numbering series used at
 that time for State Department communi-
 cations to diplomatic and consular posts
 abroad.  The forgery was numbered
 "Circular 11", and dated "April 17, 1958".
 Under the State Department system, the
 numbers begin anew with each fiscal year.

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 The real Circular 11 for the period of
 1 July 1957 to 30 June 1958 was sent on
 20 July 1957.
 The document was typed on a blank form
 of a type which had actually been in use
 until August 1955, but was replaced at
 that time by a new form.  The post-1955
 form was headed "Incoming Telegram -
 The Foreign Service of the United States
 of America", and the location of the
 Embassy had to be typed in.  The form on
 which the forgery was typed bore the
 printed legend:  "Incoming Telegram - -
 American Embassy, Baghdad."
 Official messages transmitted to U. S.
 diplomatic and consular representatives
 abroad are signed in the name of the
 Secretary of State and not by other offi-
 cials.  The Rountree Circular was 'signed'
 by William Rountree, who at the time was
 an Assistant Secretary of State.
 Letters and memoranda purportedly written
 by U. S. Government officials run afoul of the
 same problem of format.  In the Berry Letter, for
 example, the paragraphs are not numbered in
 accordance with established procedures, the pages
 are improperly numbered and the salutation and
 closing are not consistent with established corres-
 pondence format.  In the Rockefeller Letter the
 salutation is indented to align with the paragraph
 indentations and not, as in American practice, with
 the left margin of the text.

 3.  Use of British Spelling in Documents Supposedly
 Written by Americans
 The most common error in the forgeries so
 far discovered has been the use of British
 spelling in the words in which British and
 American spelling differ.  The Rockefeller Letter,
 for example, uses the words "favour", "econo-
 mising", and "emphasising", and the Hoover
 Letter speaks of "reorganisation".  It should be
 noted, however, that this error has not occurred
 in all forgeries, and was not consistent even in
 the Rockefeller and Hoover letters. The
 Rockefeller Letter, while using "emphasising",
 also uses "emphasize".  The Hoover Letter uses
 "reorganisation" but also "unfavorable".  While
 use of British spellings alone would indicate
 that the writer is not American it would not, of
 course, mean that he is necessarily English,
 since it is British and not American English that
 is taught in most schools outside the U. S. Use
 of both spellings in the same document, however,
 suggests the possibility that the writer (or
 writers) may have learned English as a single
 language, without mastering the differences
 between the British and American versions that
 a native of either country recognizes on sight.
 4.  Use of British Expressions as American
 Examples:  The Rockefeller Letter refers to the
 idea that "the Flag follows trade" as an American
 tradition, while in fact it is a phrase used by
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 political scientists to describe British colonial
 tradition.
 The Rockefeller Letter also says, "the
 hooked fish needs no bait", which is British
 rather than American.  Still another example,
 in the same document, is the expression
 "ramming home" (of an idea), which an American
 would be more apt to write as "driving home".
 5.   Use of Expressions Which Are Foreign in Usage,
 or Bad Translations from a Foreign Language
 Examples:  The Rockefeller Letter, in making a
 statement, refers to "my friends" as supporting
 authority. In German, "meine Parteifreunde"
 or "politische Freunde" is often used to give
 weight to an argument, but this would be an odd
 practice in U. S. Government correspondence.
 An instance which seems to be poor transla-
 tion also occurs in the Rockefeller Letter.  This
 document begins, "I am reluctant to revert to
 that lengthy and tiresome discussion. " An
 American would not be apt to refer-to a discus-
 sion with the President as "tiresome" in a letter
 to the President.  The word used in the German
 text of the letter, however, is ermudende, which
 can with equal validity be translated as "tiring".
 In view of the fact that the President, at the time
 of the Camp David meeting, was still convalescing
 from his heart attack, reference to a "long and
 tiring discussion" would be plausible.

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 The Berry Letter uses the expression,
 "during the medical examination progress",
 which can only be a poor translation from
 another language.
 6.   Mistakes in U. S. Military Terminology and Usage
 Examples:  The "John H" Letter is addressed "To
 American Officers and Other Ranks" -- a saluta-
 tion a Briton might use but an American would
 not be apt to.  The same letter used the term
 1179th Engineering" rather than "79th Engineers".
 It also contained fifteen spelling errors and
 several mistakes in abbreviating military terms.
 The Berry Letter, purportedly written by a
 USAF official, contains the following errors in
 usage:
 "Internal Zone" for "Zone of Interior"
 "Air Force Command" and "AFC", which are
 not used by USAF in referring to the
 United States Air Force
 "psychostenia" is an obsolete psychiatric
 term not commonly used by American
 medical personnel
 "a group of experts" is mentioned as
 authority.  In such a letter, the "group
 of experts" would be identified and not
 inferred by a general term
 "the Patuxent River AFB (M d)" should be
 "Patuxent River Naval Air Station" and
 use of parentheses to set apart State

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 abbreviations is not an accepted
 practice.  The same errors occur in
 "the Cooke AFB (Calif)".  Still another
 error occurring in both is use of the
 article "the", which would be correct
 in any of several other languages but is
 not an American practice.
 Use of vague generalities such as "further
 improvement of aircraft equipment,
 brighter lights of the ground signal
 systems and beacons, installation of
 additional direction signs. "  These
 terms are so obscure as to defy inter-
 pretation and certainly would be identified
 specifically if referred to in a letter to
 the Secretary of Defense, especially if,
 as this document states, they were
 "proposed by experts".
 7.  Operational Carelessness in Referring to Dates
 Examples:  The Rockefeller Letter was purportedly
 written in January 1956, but the writer says "If
 I am not mistaken the Bill obtained your approval
 following Sir Anthony Edent s visit to Washington."
 Anthony Eden arrived in Washington on 30 January
 1956 and remained until 2 February.
 When Blitz  replayed the Berry Letter on
 30 August 1958, it explained editorially that "A
 photostat of this confidential letter dated March
 27, 1958, was published early this month in the
 German newspaper Neues Deutschland."  It was

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 true that the forgery had been surfaced early in
 the month--the 7th, to be exact--but the month
 was May and not August.  This error is of some
 interest in itself, since it suggests that the replay
 copy, complete with editorial comment, may
 have been sent out at about the time the letter
 was surfaced and either received late by Blitz
 or allowed to lie around the Blitz offices for
 some time and then published without editorial
 reading.
 The Rountree Circular Campaign provided
 an interesting collection of conflicting dates
 (and explanations of origin).  On 9 April 1958,
 the clandestine Our Radio, in East Germany,
 broadcast to Turkey a news item which began,
 "Report from Cairo:  The American State
 Department has sent a secret directive to its
 envoys in the Middle East with a view to over-
 throwing the UAR."                                          The item continued with a
 brief description oi` the "directive", which did
 not mention the name Rountree but was otherwise
 an excellent summary of the Rountree Circular.
 The Rountree Circular itself was dated 17 April
 1958, i.e., a week after the East German broad-
 cast, but was not surfaced until 26 July (twelve
 days after the Baghdad coup d'etat).  The
 document "had been sent to the American Embassy
 in Baghdad in April of this year. " When Blitz
 replayed the forgery on 2 August, it was under
 an introduction which began, "With the storming
 of Baghdad, the citadel of the Baghdad Pact, by
 the forces of Arab nationalism, Americans have

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 been caught with their pants down.  The snakepit
 that it was, Baghdad in Republican hands has
 yielded a mass of secret documents which expose
 the pretensions of American imperialism, showing
 up Washington as the arch enemy of Arab unity and
 laying bare its conspiracy to destroy the United
 Arab Republic.  One such incriminating document
 was sent by the State Department on April 17, 1958,
 to all its diplomatic missions in the Middle East...
 and continued with quotations from the Rountree
 Circular.  Thus, the cable described by Our
 Radio in Leipzig on 9 April did not, according to
 the August implication in Blitz, come to light
 until "the storming of Baghdad" on 14 July.
 8.  Operational Carelessness--Using Typewriters
 Which Betray the Forgery
 Examples:  It has been determined that the machine
 used in typing the Rockefeller Letter was not of
 American manufacture, and was probably made
 before World War II by Rheinmetall V. E. B.,
 which is located at Sommerda bei Erfurt, in
 Thuringia, East Germany.
 Analysis indicates that the Berry Letter was
 typed on either an unknown foreign machine or a
 rebuilt combination of different typewriter machine
 parts, possibly of American origin.
 The typewriter used in addressing the
 O'Shaughnessy Letter to its target was found, on
 later analysis, to have been used a few weeks
 earlier in another East German intelligence
 operation (see paragraph  C-1 of Section VII).

 A.   Areas and Operational Methods Used in Surfacing
 1.          1957.  The twelve propaganda forgeries known
 to have been surfaced in 1957 made their first
 appearance as follows:
 Surfaced within the Soviet Bloc - 2
 both overtly, in East Germany
 Surfaced outside the Bloc - 10
 all unattributable
 West Germany            1
 France          1
 India                   8
 Of the 1957 total of twelve forgeries, two were
 surfaced overtly in Bloc propaganda media, two
 covertly in West Europe and all the rest by
 unattributable publication in the newspaper Blitz
 in India--a total of only four surfacing channels
 in four countries.
 2.   1958-59.  The 1957 simplicity of surfacing areas
 and methods was not repeated in 1958 and the
 first half of 1959.  In that period, twenty-four
 forgeries were surfaced, using fourteen coun-
 tries--only two of them within the Bloc--as
 surfacing points.    Five of the twenty-four were
 surfaced in overt Bloc media and four others

 overtly by the Soviet Embassy in London.  The
 other fifteen were given unattributable surfacing

 Indian newspaper Blitz, which had surfaced
 eight of the twelve forgeries of 1957, surfaced
 only one in 1958-59 although the paper was
 heavily used in 1958 replay of forgeries sur-
 faced elsewhere.  The areas used were:

 B.         Replay - Methods of Delivery to Target Audiences
 Once a forgery has been surfaced, it is delivered
 with remarkable precision to its target audience.
 The means of delivery may range from a single
 covert action (e. g., mailing the forged document
 "black" to a single individual), through overt third-
 country replay to a single target country, to a
 complicated series of operations involving a large
 number of Bloc assets in several countries, with
 extent and methods of replay depending upon the kind
 of target audience at which the forgery in question
 is aimed.
 1.   An example of the simplest covert delivery was
 the O'Shaughnessy Letter, targeted at the French
 Government and mailed "black" to the French
 Ambassador to West Germany.  No overt sur-
 facing and no replay were ever reported.
 Another illustration, not mentioned elsewhere
 in this paper because distribution was within a
 single nation only, was a letter on a forged
 State Department letterhead, addressed to
 Ambassador Chapin in Iran and signed "John
 Foster Dulles", which was transmitted (means
 unknown) to the Shah of Iran in late February
 1958.  The letter, dated 8 October 1957, con-
 sisted of statements which were highly derogatory
 to the Shah.  So far as known the letter was never
 used in any other way.

 2.   An example of surfacing outside the Bloc, followed
 by a single replay by overt Bloc media into a
 specific target area, is provided by the Taipeh
 Cables series. The first two forgeries in this
 campaign were the Rankin Cables, "proving" that
 the U. S. Government was plotting to assassinate
 Chiang Kai-shek. The two cables were surfaced
 in Blitz, in India, on 21 September 1957 and, on
 30 December, replayed by Radio Peking, in
 Mandarin, to Taiwan.  No other replay was ever
 reported.  (It is interesting to note that, while
 replay on the forged document itself was thus
 limited, the theme was not dropped.  In late Feb-
 ruary and early March 1959 a group of Latin
 American CP representatives visited Peking on
 their way home from the 21st Congress of the
 Communist Party of the Soviet Union.  While in
 Peking they heard talks on international affairs
 by Mao Tse-tung, Liu Shao-chi and other Chinese
 CP leaders.  One of the "facts" communicated to
 them in the course of these talks was that "the
 U.S. realized that Chiang Kai-shek is an
 obstacle (to its plans) and is trying to eliminate
 him by means of a coup d'etat to be effected by a
 Chinese officer who studied in the U.S.  The
 U. S. has a secret Provisional Government in
 readiness. ") Similarly, the final cable in the
 Taipeh series was a purported State Department
 cable on U.S. plans for subversion in the SEATO
 area, in Southeast Asia.  The cable was surfaced
 in Blitz on 12 October 1957 and a few weeks later
 was reprinted in the newspaper La Patrie, in
 Bangkok, Thailand (i. e. , in the capital of the only
 country on the Southeast Asian mainland which is
 a member of SEATO).  No other replay was ever
 reported.

 3.   At the other end of the replay scale was the
 Rockefeller Letter campaign, targeted at a
 worldwide audience and replayed accordingly.
 The Rockefeller Letter was surfaced in the East
 German Party daily Neues Deutschland on
 15 February 1957, and replayed by:
 Radio Moscow, which picked it up within twenty-
 four hours of surfacing and replayed it in
 repeated broadcasts (some at normal speed
 and others at dictation speed) to Vietnam,
 Greece, the Middle East (in Arabic), Iran (in
 Persian), Turkey (in Turkish), Yugoslavia
 (in Serbocroat), Indonesia (in Indonesian),
 Latin America (in Spanish), on 16 and 17
 February; to foreign audiences in Arabic,

 twenty-one broadcasts, worldwide, including
 the United Kingdom, France, Norway, Holland,
 Denmark, Hungary, Rumania, Albania and
 Finland,between 19 and 22 February.  On
 10 March the Dulles Memorandum was sur-
 faced (also in Neues Deutschland) as a Middle
 Eastern supplement to the Rockefeller Letter.
 Radio Moscow thereafter replayed the two
 forgeries, sometimes separately but usually
 together, to the Middle East (in Arabic), Iran

 more than one hundred instances of replay had

 An example of this overt/covert replay system
 is the Israeli General Staff Campaign, which began
 as a rumor in France in early 1957, traversed the
 Mediterranean in false-intelligence form, appeared
 in India in published form and received its latest
 known replay in a book published in Moscow in the
 spring of 1959.
 The Israeli General Staff Campaign
 1.   Rumor Campaign - France - Spring 1957 -
 French/Israeli General Staff Plans
 In mid-March 1957 (six months after the
 Israeli and French/British military action against
 Egypt) rumors began circulating in official and
 diplomatic circles in Paris that the French and
 Israeli General Staffs were working together on
 a plan for joint Israeli/French action against
 Egypt.  The rumors were traced through all
 pertinent sources.  It was learned that in the
 first place they had no foundation in fact, and in
 the second all traceable tales on the subject ran
 back to a single local point of origin: a Paris
 journalist                           who was
 notorious both for his role as a pro-Soviet
 propagandist and for his penchant for cultivating
 acquaintances in Government and diplomatic
 circles.  By the first week in April, the rumors
 had died out

 2.  Diplomatic Report - Lebanon - Spring of 1957
 During the first week in April 1957, a
 Western diplomat stationed in Beirut cabled to
 his Government that a high Lebanese official had
 just informed him that "France was launching a
 plot in cooperation with Israel. "
 3.  False Intelligence Report - Italy - Spring of 1957
 A report (information date April-May 1957 no source description or evaluation given)
 stated that
 "France apparently intends to use the small port
 of Nahariya, north of Haifa and a few kilometers
 from the Lebanese border, as a naval base for
 French intervention in the event that Middle East

 tension should worsen" and that France was
 "financing an Israeli radar installation to protect
 the Nahariya base".  The report added, "The
 Israeli press has not mentioned the matter, but
 details are being talked about in public."
 4.   Press Allegation - India - Fall of 1957 - Secret
 Strategic Plan
 On 12 October 1957 Blitz, in India,carried a
 long article headed "Israel Plans to Dismember
 Arab States and Organise an Israeli Empire!"
 The article reported that "a Blitz correspondent
 in a West Asian country had an opportunity of
 getting acquainted in detail with a secret
 strategic plan of the Israeli General Staff.  We
 may be able to publish the plan in full in future."
 The article gave details of the "Plan", which
 "envisages military operations against the
 countries bordering on Israel....  In general,
 the Plan provides for the annexation of the
 territory bounded by the Suez Canal, the River
 Litani and the Persian Gulf.... "  Blitz
 added editorially that "the scheme takes into
 account the circumstance that Israel will not be
 able to rely on victory if she acts alone.  In this
 connection, assistance on the part of the U.S.A. ,
 Britain and France is envisaged beforehand.
 The Plan especially emphasizes that "the U. S.
 is interested in a clash between Israel and the
 Arab States" and that "the U. S. interest in the
 strategic points of the Middle East is explained
 by the striving to strengthen her positions in this
 oil-rich area."

 5.  "Secret Strategic Plan" Forgery Surfaced - India -
 Fall of 1957
 In November 1957 Blitz director R. K. Karanjia
 fulfilled the promise of his October newspaper
 article by publishing a 78-page booklet entitled
 Dagger of Israel.  The booklet was a vehicle for
 surfacing the purported "Strategic Plan of the
 Israeli Army for 1956-57 - Translated from the
 original in Hebrew".  This document, an obvious
 fraud, is a rambling, badly written tract with the
 details given in the Blitz article quoted just above
 as its propaganda climax.  In his introduction,
 author Karanjia placed the date of beginning work
 on the book as March 1957, i.e. the period in
 which the "French/Israeli General Staff" rumors
 had appeared in France.  (The book is dedicated
 to President Nasser of Egypt, and closes with a
 reprint of an interview Nasser had given to the
 Cairo daily Al Ahram.  It opens with a foreword
 by Haj Amin el Husseini, former Grand Mufti of
 Palestine, whose autographed photograph is used
 as frontispiece. Karanjia gives credit for the
 title, Dagger of Israel, to "my brilliant friend
 Colonel Serraj, Chief of the Intelligence Bureau
 of the Syrian Army, who took pains to explain to
 me for over an hour the aggressive strategy of
 Israel supported by her British, French and
 American parents and allies.")
 6.  Soviet "Whisper" - France - Spring of 1958

 Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in Paris, told

 a Western diplomat that his Government was
 currently "worried about increased French/
 Israeli political and military cooperation", a
 worry which the diplomat promptly reported to
 his own foreign ministry.  (Rogov was identified
 as a Colonel in           25X1 C5b
 the service now known as KGB, and was later              25X1X6
 identified                     as a key figure in
 Soviet clandestine political action operations in
 France.)
 7.  Press Replay on "French/Israeli Plan" - India -
 Spring of 1958
 On 5 April 1958 Blitz, in Bombay, carried an
 article, "Israel Plotting Preventive War!"  The
 article, datelined Beirut, began:  "Diplomatic
 circles at Tel Aviv report that the Israeli Armed
 Forces command is elaborating jointly with the
 French Army General Staff a so-called 'Plan of
 Preventive Hostilities' against the UAR" and
 concluded with the statement, "Meantime, Israel
 is frantically seeking other alliances....  The
 Americans are now helping her to an alliance
 with the anti-Arab NATO member Turkey."
 8.  Blitz Replay Ties French/Israeli General Staff
 Plan with Secret Strategic Plan - India - April
 1958
 On 19 April 1958 another Blitz article,
 "Dulles Openly Supports Israel's War Plans",
 reported that Secretary of State Dulles "has

 announced (in a closed session of the Foreign
 Affairs Committee of the U. S. House of
 Representatives) that the United States would
 support the demands of the Ben Gurion Govern-
 ment on enlarging the territory of Israel at the
 cost of the Arab lands."  Under the subhead
 "Secret Talks with France", the article revived
 the year-old rumors of secret joint planning of
 the French/Israeli General Staffs for military
 action, and stated that the U. S. Government had
 been kept fully informed of the plan by both the
 French and Israeli Governments.
 9.   USSR Adopts the Secret Strategic Plan - Fall of
 1958
 In October 1958 the forgery originally sur-
 faced in Dagger of Israel was reprinted, in the
 form of a ten-page excerpt, in a 147-page book
 published by the State Publishing House for
 Political Literature, in Moscow.  The book,
 entitled The State of Israel - Its Situation and
 Policies, is a vicious propaganda attack, of-the
 misinformation variety, upon the State of Israel
 and all of its political parties except the Israeli
 CP, and against "the Zionist bosses", the
 "important representatives of Jewry", the
 United States in particular and the West in
 general.  It is presented as a history of Israel
 and the Zionist movement and, on internal
 evidence, seems to have been designed for use
 in Communist study groups since it assumes a
 "Marxist-Leninist" viewpoint on the part of the
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 reader.  Except for this assumption, its
 similarity with the less comprehensive and more
 generally-targeted Dagger of Israel is great
 enough to present the possibility that both manu-
 scripts were prepared in the same place, if not
 written by the same individual.
 The Secret Strategic Plan forgery is
 strikingly reminiscent of the hoary propaganda
 forgery known as the Protocols of the Learned
 Elders of Zion.  This was a crudely forged "plan
 for Jewish world conquest" prepared by the
 Czarist secret police at the turn of the century
 and given worldwide distribution by anti-Semitic
 groups through the 1920's.  The rise of Nazism
 in Europe gave it a fresh lease on life in the
 1930's, and it was heavily used in Nazi propa-
 ganda -- including Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf --
 until the end of World War II.  Exposed and
 thoroughly discredited by that time, little was
 heard of it until September 1958, when it was
 re-launched by
 25X6A
 R. K. Karanjia of Blitz.  This 25X6A
 forgery would be an awkward property for Soviet
 propagandists to attempt to promote, and it may
 be that the Blitz-surfaced and Soviet-replayed
 Secret Strategic Plan, with its purported proof
 of Zionist plans to conquer all of Israel's
 neighbors, was adopted (written?) by the Soviets
 in an effort to find an equally durable substitute
 which would not be vulnerable to the charge of
 Czarist origin.  The phrase "Elders of Zion" was
 reiterated in supporting propaganda for the

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 Protocols, during the early years of this
 century, until the phrase itself took on a connota-
 tion of hidden, conspiratorial evil in the ears of
 people who had never seen the forgery in which
 the term originated.  The course of the "Israeli
 General Staff" campaign so far suggests that its
 promoters may be trying to repeat this propa-
 ganda coup by building the phrase "Israeli
 General Staff" into an emotionally-charged term
 with the same aura of hidden but familiar threat
 that the term "Elders of Zion" held in the
 propaganda of the preceding half century.  The
 reference to foreign support, in the Secret
 Strategic Plan, is sufficiently ambiguous to permit
 editorial comment allying the "Israeli General
 Staff" with any Western or Western-allied
 country in later charges of cooperation on plans
 for aggression in the Middle East.
 10. Press Replay - India - Fall of 1958
 The November 1958 edition of the book Arab
 Dawn (q. v. also in Annex 4-a, for its role
 in replay of the Rockefeller Letter Campaign),
 published by Blitz, in India, states that "In
 Beirut, at the beginning of October, this author
 was told of the latest in the series of Anglo-
 American plans to 'cut Nasser down to size',
 which France has since endorsed. "  The
 alleged plan, "scheduled to take place next spring
 or earlier", provided for Western action against
 Lebanon, Iraq and the Sudan.  The author added,
 however, that "a supplementary plan has been

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 attached to the main project.  The supplementary
 document introduces the latest plan of the Israeli
 General Staff to take over the West Bank of the
 Jordan River by means of a swift blitzkrieg....
 The Israeli plan, which apparently has the
 approval of the CIA, the British Ambassador in
 Beirut and the U. S. Ambassador in Tehran...
 is built around the possibility of either the flight
 or the assassination of King Hussein of Jordan in
 the near future.  According to CIA Chief Eveland
 in Beirut, Middleton (British Ambassador) and
 (Loy) Henderson (of U. S. State Department), said
 to be the three co-authors of the Plan, the net
 result of the show organized for the Western
 imperialists by their Israeli puppets would be to
 demolish...Nasser,, . by demonstrating Arab
 impotence to deal effectively with the Israeli
 action. "
 11.     Press Replay - USSR - Spring of 1959
 The "Israeli General Staff" canard, now
 enshrined in an official Soviet publication, will
 no doubt continue in its role as a perennial in
 the Bloc psychological warfare collection.  Its
 latest appearance, in the Soviet periodical Red
 Fleet, was protested by the Turkish Foreign
 Ministry in a radio broadcast from Ankara on
 13 April 1959:  "The Information Bureau of the
 Foreign Ministry has issued the following state-
 ment - The Moscow magazine Red Fleet has
 published a report that the Chief of the Israeli
 General Staff came to Ankara toward the end of

 last month and held secret talks (in which) the
 question of Turkey's support of Israel for an
 attack against the Arabs, especially against the
 UAR, in the near future, was discussed.  There
 is no doubt that such reports, which are fre-
 quently seen in Communist newspapers and aim
 at harming the relations of Turkey with its
 neighboring, brotherly countries, are without
 any foundation whatsoever."
 D.    Types of Operation Used in Covert/Semi-Covert
 Surfacing and Replay
 The covert and semi-covert operations observed
 in the 1957-59 forgery campaigns have fallen within
 the following categories:
 1.   False Intelligence Reports
 1957.  Lebanon.  See subparagraph C-2 above
 for appearance in April 1957 of the
 French/Israeli General Staff Plan as
 a report cabled by a West European
 diplomat in Beirut to his European
 headquarters.
 Italy. See subparagraph C-3 above for
 April-May 1957 report on the appear-
 ance of the French/Israeli General
 Staff Plan as a clandestine intelligence
 report in Italy.

 1959.  UAR. In January 1959,
 UAR military attaches
 in Ankara, Stockholm and Tehran .had
 recently cabled to Cairo that they "had
 obtaiied documentary evidence of
 State Department briefings to those
 posts to the effect that current U.S.
 policy is to undermine UAR/USSR
 relations and when that is accomplished,
 to finish off Nasser."  (This is an
 obvious continuation of the Rountree
 Circular itself, q.v. in Annex 5.
 Since the Rountree Circular, itself was
 promoted by the Bloc and UAR jointly,
 it is difficult to judge whether the
 military attaches, if they actually
 received such reports, were being
 used as targets of a Bloc action or as
 channels for a UAR contribution to
 what may still have been a joint UAR/
 Bloc operation.)

 1957.  France.  See subparagraph C-1 above for
 March 1957 surfacing of the French/
 Israeli General Staff Plan as a rumor,
 by a Soviet propaganda agent in Paris.
 1958.  France.  See subparagraph C-6 above for
 4 April 1958 report of the "whisper" by
 Mikhail Rogov of the Soviet Embassy
 to a Western diplomat that his Govern-
 ment was "worried about increased
 French/Israeli political and military
 cooperation. "  In the context of the
 year-old French/Israeli General Staff
 rumor which, as it happened, was to
 be replayed overtly in India the next
 day, this might serve as an illustration
 of a point made a year earlier in an
 article in the April 1957 issue of the
 French military periodical, Revue
 Militaire d'Information.  The article,
 "La tPersuasion& des Consciences,
 Methodes de Propagande Sovietique",
 stated that "The auxiliaries of Soviet

 propaganda also hold a large sector in
 day to day operations.  Propaganda is
 not satisfied with tracts, newspapers,
 brochures and radio broadcasts; it
 grants a large share to human contacts
 which can be classified here into two
 distinct groups, those which produce
 'whispering propaganda' and those
 which produce 'display propaganda'.
 As to the first, groups or single
 individuals belonging to Embassy
 circles or the TASS Agency, repeat in
 brief conversations the principal
 themes developed in the USSR or the
 Peoples' Democracies, and assure
 them a rather wide diffusion."
 3.  Mailing "Black"
 Dropping an anonymous letter or a letter with
 a fictitious return address into a mail box is, in
 itself, a simple operation.  The 1957-59 propa-
 ganda forgery campaigns in which this device has
 been used, however, have usually been anything
 but simple:
 1957.  West Germany.  The O'Shaughnessy Letter.
 On 5 July 1957 a letter was mailed in
 Munich, addressed to the French
 Ambassador to West Germany.  Having
 thus been delivered to its single target--
 the French Government--the letter was
 never published or replayed in any way.

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300130001-0
 The document, mailed so simply, was
 a forged letter addressed to the State
 Department in Washington and carrying
 the typewritten tsignature' of Elim
 O'Shaughnessy, Chief of the Political
 Division of the American Embassy in
 West Germany.  It called the attention
 of "the State Department" to the
 activity of reactionary ultranationalist
 groups in West Germany, and advised
 that the U. S. Government support
 these groups and use them.  In the
 context of the period in which it was
 mailed, the forgery was obviously
 expected to suggest to the French
 Government that the U. S. Govern-
 ment viewed with favor "West German
 ultranationalist groups" like the one
 that was currently receiving extensive
 publicity in the French press.  One of
 the biggest news stories of the summer
 of 1957 in France was the terrorist
 murder of Mme. Tremeaud, the wife
 of the Prefet de Police at Strasbourg.
 Mme. Tremeaud had been killed, on
 17 May 1957, by a bomb mailed to her
 husband in the guise of a gift package
 of cigars, and the French press over
 the following weeks emphasized the
 growing conviction of the investigating
 authorities that there was a connection
 between this covertly-mailed bomb and
 a flood of particularly vicious hate

 letters mailed at the same time (and
 in the same Paris post office) to various
 French officials and private individuals
 in Paris and in Alsace-Lorraine.  The
 letters carried the 'signature' of a pur-
 ported West German neo-fascist group
 calling itself the Kampfverband fuer
 ein Unabhaengiges Deutschland and
 demanding that Alsace-Lorraine be
 returned to Germany.  (Other letters in
 the series had been sent, at various
 times, to Americans stationed in
 Germany -- including Elim O'Shaughnessy. )
 It has since been established that the
 Kampfverband is a phantom organization,
 existing only as a signature placed on
 letters and leaflets which are prepared
 by the East German foreign intelligence
 service HVA, and mailed in France and
 West Germany by couriers sent from
 East Germany for that purpose (see
 paragraph C-2 of Section VII below).
 Bloc cooperation in promotion of psy-
 chological warfare campaigns was
 pointed up in connection with this cam-
 paign when, in May 1958, a long Radio
 Moscow broadcast to France, in French,
 warned its listeners against the
 nefarious activities of the "West German"
 Kampfverband fuer ein Unabhaengiges
 Deutschland and strongly implied that
 this "West German neo-fascist organi-
 zation" was secretly supported by the
 West German Government.

 Letter (never surfaced overtly) was

 West Germany and Austria.  The Ceske

 fide Czech emigre newspaper, pub-
 lished by Czech emigres in Munich.
 In June 1958 a forged newspaper pur-
 porting to be the July 1958 issue of
 Ceske Slovo went into circulation.  The
 forged edition carried anti-Western
 propaganda, including the claim that
 Ceske Slovo was going out of existence
 because its editors were disillusioned
 with the West.  It was an accurate
 duplicate of the format and style of the
 real Ceske Slovo.  The forged issues
 were mailed "black" from Munich and
 Vienna to some current and some
 former subscribers of the real news-
 paper, through use of two genuine
 mailing lists.  One of these was an
 out-of-date list obtained several years
 earlier by means unknown.  The other
 was up-to-date, and had been obtained
 through a recent burglary of the offices
 of the real Ceske Slovo.  The fact that
 the burglary and forgery were a Czech
 intelligence operation has since been
 confirmed.

 The Ceske Slovo forgery proved to
 be the first in a series of forgeries
 designed to harass the publishers of
 Ceske Slovo and injure the morale of
 its readers.  It has since been followed
 by:
 First Supplement: In July 1958,
 several forged letters (total number
 unknown) purportedly written by the
 editor of the real Ceske Slovo were
 mailed in Munich to various organiza-
 tions in West Germany and the United
 States.  They were designed to create
 bad feeling between the Ceske Slovo
 editor and the addressee organizations.
 Second Supplement:  In April 1959
 another series of forged letters, again
 ostensibly written by the editor of the
 real Ceske Slovo, was sent to individual
 Czech emigres and people of Czech
 descent in the United States, Sweden
 and Canada.  The letters were individually
 written and varied in detail, but most of
 those whose content is known informed
 the recipients that the writer was dis-
 continuing his work in exile.
 West Germany.   In December 1958 an
 estimated 4, 000 copies of the forged
 Schlagzeug mailing envelope carrying

 the final replay in the Berry Letter
 Campaign, q. v. in paragraph A-2 of
 Section II, were mailed in West Ger-
 many.  The mailing list used was an
 obsolete one, containing the names of
 several individuals who had long since
 died or moved to other areas.  Investi-
 gation of the history and interests of
 individual addressees showed no
 'common denominator' to account for
 their inclusion in an East German
 propaganda mailing list.  So far as
 known, the envelopes were not mailed
 to any of the individuals who were on
 the mailing list of the real Schlagzeug.
 1959.       Iraq.  In March 1959, a high official in the
 Iraqi Government was known to have
 received. a photocopy of the Murphy
 Letter (q.v. under Rountree Letter
 Campaign, in Annex 5), which he
 said "someone had mailed" to him.
 Lebanon.  In March 1959 the Murphy
 Letter was also transmitted -- presum-
 ably by direct mail -- to an unspecified
 number of Beirut newspapers, and to
 members of the Lebanese Parliament.

 1957.  Egypt.  In late March 1957 an official
 East German representative in Cairo
 mailed a letter to the East German
 Trade Delegation in Damascus.  The
 letter contained several enclosures,
 including:
 (a) A report dated 25 March 1957,
 signed "Aulbach", which was appar-
 ently an information copy of a report
 which Aulbach had just cabled to
 Berlin.  Aulbach reported that the
 Arab League had arranged to have the
 Rockefeller Letter translated into
 Arabic and distributed to the Govern-
 ments of the Arab League member
 states, "with instructions to follow the
 same procedure with the Dulles
 Memorandum".  (The same report
 discussed an interview granted to
 Aulbach by Ahmed Shoukiry, Deputy
 Secretary General of the Arab
 League and representative of Syrian
 President Kuwatli.)
 (b) A copy of a replay article on the
 Dulles Memorandum, from an
 unidentified English-language news-

 1958.     Morocco.  The Hoover Letter was replayed
 by the official Chinese Communist press
 agency NCNA (Hsinhua News Agency or,
 in English, New China News Agency),
 which reprinted it in full in its Daily
 Bulletin of 25 January 1958.  The
 Hsinhua Daily Bulletin is an overt
 daily press bulletin, mimeographed in
 English and issued by the Prague
 offices of NCNA.  Its masthead gives
 the editorial address of the publication
 as Korejska 5, Praha 6-Bubenec,
 Czechoslovakia, and carries a list of
 subscription prices.  The report which
 disclosed the Hoover Letter replay,
 however, stated that the publication
 "is delivered daily and free of charge
 by persons unknown to Al Alam, princi-
 pal Arabic-language organ of the
 Istiglal Party, in Morocco".   (No
 other reports of free delivery have
 been received, but in view of the
 propaganda purpose of the bulletin it
 is almost a foregone conclusion that the
 Morocco newspaper is not the only non-
 Communist recipient of such informa-
 tional largesse. )
 Lebanon.  On 15 August 1958 (i. e., ten days
 before it was surfaced in the outlawed
 Beirut Al-Masaa), a bundle of mimeo-

 Origin and intended destination are
 unknown.
 5.       Clandestine Newspaper as Surfacing Point
 1958. Lebanon. The newspaper Beirut Al-Masaa,
 in which the "John H" Letter was sur-
 faced on 25 August 1958, became overt
 when the new Lebanese Government
 came into power in the fall of 1958.
 At the time of the "John H" surfacing,
 however, it was outlawed and anyone
 caught with it (or other banned news-
 papers) in his possession was liable to
 a six-month jail sentence.  The paper's
 political line was that of violent Arab
 nationalism, but according to an
 October 1958 report, "it is reputed to
 have Communists among its employees
 and close ties with the Cairo Al-Masaa
 (a daily which was noted for its heavy
 proportion of pro-Bloc propaganda
 items), and it publishes much material
 from TASS and other Soviet bloc news
 agencies." In other words, another
 newspaper to which the type description
 given in paragraph B-5 of Section VI
 applies:  not a CP paper, but a
 chronic purveyor of pro-Bloc propaganda.

 V - ASSETS USED IN SURFACING AND REPLAY - OVERT
 The overt (attributable) Bloc, assets observed in use
 in surfacing and replay of the internationally distributed
 forgeries in 1957-59 are:
 A.    Located within the Sino-Soviet Bloc
 USSR.       The overt role of the USSR in surfacing
 propaganda forgeries has been limited to its
 appearance in the Berry Letter (prelude
 supplied by Nikita Khrushchev) and the four
 U. S. Pilot Letters surfaced by the Soviet
 Embassy in London.  In overt replay, how-
 ever, Soviet propaganda media have played
 by far the preponderant role in distributing
 the forgeries to target audiences throughout
 the world.  The media thus used in 1957-59
 were:
 Radio Moscow.  Replayed nine of the ten
 forgery campaigns (i. e., all except the
 Ceske Slovo campaign, which was a
 Czech IS operation) to audiences in the
 USSR and throughout the world.
 TASS.  Replayed six of the ten campaigns
 to its outlets throughout the world and
 to the Soviet press.  Volume and fre-
 quency of TASS replay, however, were
 far less than for Radio Moscow.

 Publications within the USSR which were
 also used for replay included:
 Pravda (replayed three of the ten
 campaigns);
 Izvestia (replayed two of the ten
 campaigns);
 Daily Review of the Soviet Press
 (published in English, in Moscow;
 replayed the "John H" Letter);
 Moscow News (replayed the Summit
 Directive);
 Soviet Fleet (replayed the Israeli
 General Staff Campaign);
 Book, The State of Israel, Its Situation
 and Policies, published by the
 State Publishing House for Political
 Literature, in Moscow, in 1958
 (replayed the Israeli General Staff
 Campaign).
 Communist China.  No forgeries surfaced in Chinese
 Communist media have so far been
 reported. In overt replay to audiences out-
 side its own territory, the role of Chinese
 Communist propaganda media has been
 second only to that of Soviet, media although
 the volume of replay in each instance was
 much lower than that of the USSR:
 NCNA (Hsinhua Agency, or, in English,
 New China News Agency) was used for
 replay in eight of the total of ten forgery

 campaigns:  distributed the Allison
 Cables and the Rountree Campaign to
 Europe, the "John H" Letter to North
 Korea, and the Rockefeller Letter,
 Berry Letter, Hoover Letter, Frost
 Letter and Summit Directive campaigns
 to audiences within Communist China.
 Radio Peking replayed the Rockefeller
 Letter campaign to Asian as well as
 Chinese audiences, while the only
 replay given to the Rankin Cables after
 their surfacing in India was their
 broadcast to Taiwan, in Mandarin, by
 Radio Peking.  (The Rankin Cables, a
 part of the Taipeh Cables campaign,
 concerned alleged U. S. plans to
 assassinate Chiang Kai-shek.)
 East Germany.  Overt German media have surfaced
 six of the total of thirty-six forgeries, but
 their role in replay has been that of replay
 to East and West German audiences only,
 through the following media:
 Deutschlandsender (official East German
 radio) replayed four of the ten cam-
 paigns.
 ADN (official East German press agency)
 replayed four of the ten campaigns.
 Neues Deutschland (official Communist
 Party- -SED- -daily newspaper) replayed
 three of the ten campaigns.

 CTK (official press agency) picked up the
 single forgery, the Sudan Government
 Documents, from "the Cairo press" in
 1959 for replay to its press outlets and,
 in 1958, replayed to Europe, in English,
 the Summit Directive which had just
 been surfaced by Rude Pravo.
 Rude Pravo (official CP daily, in Prague)
 replayed two of the ten campaigns.
 Rumania. Radio Bucharest replayed one campaign to
 Europe and another to local audiences
 only.
 Agerpress (official news agency) replayed
 one of the ten campaigns.
 Sci nteia (official CP daily,, in Bucharest)
 replayed two of the ten campaigns.
 Hun gar . MTI (official press agency, in Budapest) in
 1959 surfaced the Welensky Document,
 which is the first of the forgeries that
 has concerned Africa below the Sahara.
 This is the only instance in which
 Hungarian media have come to our
 attention in either surfacing or replay
 of internationally-distributed forgeries.

 VI - ASSETS USED IN SURFACING AND REPLAY -
 COVERT AND SEMI-COVERT
 The listing below refers to covert use of assets which
 may in themselves be either overt or covert.
 A.   Assets Located Within the Sino-Soviet Bloc (Covert)
 Rumania.     Clandestine Radio, Espana Independiente.
 See paragraph D-7, Section IV above, for use of
 this radio in replaying the Power  Order into
 Spain.  (Espana Independiente is the oldest of the
 Bloc clandestine radios.  It began broadcasting
 in 1941 or earlier from somewhere within the
 USSR.   In January 1955 it ceased operation
 briefly, then resumed broadcasting from the
 Bucharest area, in Rumania.  It is controlled
 by the Spanish Communist Party in Exile, for
 which it acts as spokesman, and broadcasts only
 in Spanish, to Spain. )
 East Germany. Clandestine Radio, Our Radio aka
 Bizim Radio.   See paragraph D-7, Section IV
 above, for use of this radio in broadcasting the
 prelude to the Rountree Circular into Turkey on
 9 April 1958.  Our Radio has been broadcasting
 since 2 May 1958, through a transmitter located
 at Leipzig, East Germany.  It claims to be
 located in Turkey, and broadcasts only in Turkish,
 to Turkey.  Unlike Espana Independiente, but like
 the rest of the clandestine Bloc radios in current
 use, Our Radio does not broadcast ideological

 Communist propaganda.  In a broadcast on
 7 August 1959 the station summed up its own propa-
 ganda approach as follows:  "Our Radio does not
 belong to international Communism.  It is the
 voice of our people. Our Radio makes no
 distinction between Communists, democrats,
 republicans, or between workers, peasants and
 intelligentsia.... It is the source of faith of all
 those who have united together to throw the Ame r-
 icans out of our country and to create an independ-
 ent, peace-loving and democratic Turkey....  It
 is our freedom in action -- our freedom which
 sooner or later will triumph over the Inonus,
 Mendereses and the democratic sultans."
 B.         Assets Located in Countries of the Free World
 Subparagraph D, of Section IV above, lists the known
 instances of covert and semi-covert distribution of propa-
 ganda forgeries through Bloc assets located in countries
 of the Free World.  In only eight of these operations has
 there been any identification of the assets so used.  These
 seven, however, have provided enough detail to shed some
 light on Bloc methods of operating in the psychological
 warfare field, and enough to establish the fact that identi-
 fication of the individuals concerned in local handling of
 propaganda forgeries is in itself an important step toward
 identification of Bloc intelligence service clandestine assets
 in the locality concerned.  The assets known to have been used
 in the covert and semi-covert phases of surfacing and replay
 outside the Bloc in the period 1957-59 are:

 Trushkovsky was Vozniy's
 second in command in the, "political
 intelligence" section or, more
 accurately, in the KGB rezidentura.
 The psychological warfare operations of
 the rezidentura included subsidies to several
 Burmese newspapers for publication of
 unattributable anti-American and anti-
 Western propaganda, which the newspaper
 concerned usually identified as "From Our
 Correspondent in                " another country
 (Japan, Indonesia, etc.).
 M the rezidentura had "direct control" of
 the People's Journal, "lesser though close
 control" of The Mirror and Botataung, and,
 "in addition, often used Pyidaungsu, the
 New Light of Burma and1he Burman."
 (All of these newspapers were closed by the
 Burmese Government during the spring of
 1959.) The anti-American articles were
 written in Moscow and sent as photocopies,
 in Russian, to the rezidentura in Rangoon.

 Bloc forgery campaigns have frequently been

 services, but always with some sort of warn-
 ing that the material is probably false, and
 always with the inclusion of any official denials
 the victims may have issued.  Comment of
 this type is not considered as "replay", since
 it does not present the forgery as a document
 of unquestioned authenticity.  It has occasionally

 happened, before the period of this study,
 that a forgery has been planted' by a Bloc prop-
 aganda agent in a newspaper which had no CP
 or Bloc connections.  Only one, instance of this
 is known to have occurred in the period of this
 discussion:  the Damascus newspaper Al Qabas
 replayed the Rockefeller Letter in March 1957.
 Al Qabas was later infiltrated by a local pro-
 Communist writerst group and began running
 a high proportion of pro-Bloc material, but
 this was not its usual practice in March 1957.
 All other known instances of surfacing and
 replay of Bloc forgeries during 1957-59 con-
 cerned local newspapers to which a "type"
 description can be given:  newspapers of rela-
 tively small circulation, having no official
 connection with the local CP buit noted in every
 case for their consistent role as vehicles for
 Bloc propaganda, particularly of the "misinfor-
 mation" variety (i. e., plot and atrocity charges
 against the West, etc. ).  There is not sufficient
 information available on the operational rela-
 tionships of these newspapers with the various
 Bloc diplomatic missions to warrant placing
 any one of them exclusively as, an asset of a
 single Bloc mission.  The listof non-CP news-

 Bombay, surfaced the entire Taipeh
 Cables series in September and
 October 1957, the Bishop Directive on
 12 July 1957, the Kishi-Dulles Pact
 on 12 October 1957 and the Chiang Kai-
 shek/Eisenhower Letter on 13 Decem-
 ber 1957.  It replayed the Rockefeller
 Letter on 23 March 1957, the Dulles
 Memorandum on 13 April 1957, the
 Rountree Circular on 2 August 1958,
 the Berry Letter on 30 August 1958,
 the Power  Order on 29 November 1958
 and the Israeli General Staff Campaign
 on several occasions in 1957 and 1958.
 The same newspaper published the
 prelude to the Frost Letter Campaign
 on 22 March 1958, and in the course of
 1958 published two books (Arab Dawn
 and Dagger of Israel) which were also
 surfacing and replay media for forgeries.
 Blitz is directed by an Indian
 national named R. K. Karanjia.  In
 1947 Karanjia stated that he had once
 been a CP member but had left the
 Party.  He has since denied ever having
 been a member.  He has consistently
 used Blitz, however, as a vehicle for
 pro-Soviet (and pro-Nasser) propaganda.
 Blitz regarded the local Communist
 Party and its affairs with a faintly

 jaundiced editorial eye until about
 mid-1957, when it began to move in the
 direction of approval of Indian Party
 actions.  It still criticizes the Party
 from time to time, but was a consis-
 tent and violent propagandist on behalf
 of the Communist government of
 Kerala.   In the summer of 1958,
 Karanjia made his first step toward
 official identification with Communist-
 sponsored organizations as such when
 he attended the meeting' of the World
 Peace Council in Stockholm and was
 elected to membership in the Council.
 On the return journey to India, he
 stopped in London, Paris and Cairo.
 Karanjia and his paper still have no
 official connection with the Indian
 Communist Party, but the role of both
 as propagandists for the countries of
 the Sino-Soviet bloc is frank and violent.
 The role of the paper and its director
 in propagandizing on behalf of President
 Nasser has been equally frank for the
 past four or five years, and the coup
 d'etat in Iraq on 14 July 1958 added the
 new Iraqi government (temporarily at
 least) to the list of Blitz propaganda
 beneficiaries.  The UAR/Iraq quarrel
 of late 1958 and early 059 and the
 propaganda clash, during the same
 period, between UAR and USSR, put
 Karanjia and his paper in an awkward

 position.  During the first half of 1959
 he travelled to Cairo, Baghdad and
 Moscow and interviewed Nasser,
 Kassim and Khrushchev in a well-
 publicized effort to end the two sets of
 propaganda quarrels.  During the same
 period Blitz also dropped its role as
 surfacing and replay vehicle for
 propaganda forgeries, although its anti-
 Western, pro-Bloc propaganda line did
 not change.

 about that time to run an occasional

 VII - NOTES ON CENTRAL PLANNING AND ORGANIZATION
 OF FORGERY CAMPAIGNS
 A.          Possible Soviet Origin of Internationally-Distributed
 Forgeries
 The elaborate orchestration of overt, covert and
 official Bloc assets, particularly those of the USSR,
 East Germany and China, through which each of the
 internationally-distributed propaganda forgeries of
 1957-59 has been delivered to its target audience,
 would have been impossible without central planning
 of some sort.  There have been occasional fragmentary,
 unconfirmed reports which suggest that the forgeries
 for international distribution may all be written in
 the USSR, but no definite statements can be made on
 this point without more reliable, detailed information.
 One such report was a statement made in June
 1958                                              that the
 forgeries surfaced in Neues Deutschland had been
 "planted on the East Germans by the Soviets".   The
 writer of the report commented, "The Soviets may
 not want to lower the prestige of Pravda or Izvestia
 but are naturally unconcerned about Neues Deutschland,
 although from the East German standpoint it is the
 most important East German paper. "  The fact that
 most of the overt surfacing of forgeries has been
 handled through satellite-country media and most of
 the overt replay through Soviet media lends weight to
 this comment.

 2.  A _ (Soviet Military               official
 made the following
 statement in mid-1958 concerning organizational
 responsibility in the USSR for the conduct of black
 propaganda and psychological warfare operations
 outside the Communist bloc.       This comment is the
 projection of the situation as he
 knew it into terms of present conditions within the
 USSR:
 "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union
 (CPSU) directed and still directs political, black-
 propaganda and psychological warfare operations
 through various channels.  These channels,
 depending on time and place, would be
 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ambassadors
 and other top-echelon Soviet diplomats,
 and the press department of the Ministry
 of Foreign Affairs);
 TASS;
 the Soviet press;
 the political departments of the Soviet
 armed forces and KGB;
 operational units of GRU and KGB;
 individual Soviet writers and propagandists;
 the Soviet General Staff.
 "It must be assumed that the direction of this
 activity is well planned and organized by the CPSU

 itself.  However, it would be wrong to assume
 that the Department of Propaganda and Agitation
 (Agitprop) of the Central Committee of the CPSU
 is charged with this function.  It would be more
 correct to assume that one of the close lieutenants
 of the CPSU's boss (Nikita Khrushchev at present,
 for example) who is at the same time a member
 of the Presidium (formerly the Politburo) is
 charged with this function.  This individual would
 then be responsible to Khrushchev (in present-day
 terms) and direct the whole job.  This individual
 would coordinate the political, black propaganda
 and psychological warfare operations among the
 various channels mentioned above."

 On the basis of the 1957-59 reports
 the operational responsibility for covert
 psychological warfare operations, including propa-
 ganda forgeries, is divided as follows:
 1.  Political targets in West Germany and France are
 reached through covert operations run by the East
 German equivalent of the Soviet KGB.  This is
 HVA (Haupverwaltung Aufklaerung), which is the
 foreign intelligence branch of the Ministry of
 State Security (MfS) and is also a unit in the
 structure of the Communist Party of East Germany
 (SED).  The organization works with a Soviet
 adviser.  While HVA conducted psychological
 warfare operations prior to 1957, it was only in
 January of that year that psychological warfare
 was officially announced within HVA as a major
 operational responsibility of that organization,
 and HVA began exerting pressure on its personnel
 to increase the number of such operations and to
 keep their volume high.  One unit within HVA is
 responsible for control and coordination of
 psychological warfare operations, and for
 evaluation and dissemination of overt and covert
 information and information requirements.  The
 objectives of HVA psychological warfare opera-
 tions are:

 VIII - ROLE OF UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC
 (UAR) MEDIA IN DISTRIBUTION OF
 BLOC FORGERIES
 During 1958, the disturbances in the Middle East and
 the coincidence of the UAR and Bloc anti-Western propaganda
 policies brought the UAR into close cooperation in surfacing
 and replay of the Bloc propaganda forgeries which were
 targeted at Middle Eastern audiences.  (It should perhaps
 be noted that during 1958 several other forgeries in the
 anti-Western and anti-Israel campaign were surfaced and
 replayed through UAR media only and are therefore not
 included in this discussion.)  The role of UAR media in
 distribution of the 1958 Bloc forgeries included:
 Press.    The Cairo daily Al Ahram surfaced the Rountree
 Circular on 26 July 1958, and the Cairo press
 agency MENA picked it up the same day for replay
 to the UAR and the Middle East.  The next day the
 rest of the Cairo press replayed the story.  The
 Sudan Government Documents forgery
 (allegation form) was replayed by the Czech press agency
 CTK on 4 December 1958 in a story crediting
 the Cairo press" with original publication.
 Radio.    Radio Cairo replayed the Rountree Circular at the
 time of surfacing, and on 6 December 1958
 revived the story for further replay on the occasion
 of Mr. Rountree's visit to the Middle East.
 Official UAR Missions Abroad.  In late July and early August
 1958, the UAR Embassies in West Germany, India

 and Czechoslovakia distributed the Rountree
 Circular, as an authentic document, to other
 diplomatic missions in those countries.  In Bonn,
 the Egyptian Ambassador personally transmitted
 the document to the West German Foreign Minister.
 Except for Radio Cairo, the only non-Bloc distribution
 of propaganda forgeries of known or apparent Bloc connection
 was the surfacing (allegation form only) of the U. S. Para-
 troopers' Cable in a news broadcast on Radio Baghdad
 on 11 August 1958, i. e., about three weeks after the Iraq coup
 d' a tat.

 IX - ROLE OF THE CP PRESS IN FORGERY
 DISTRIBUTION OUTSIDE THE BLOC
 Investigation of non-Bloc press handling of internationally
 distributed Bloc propaganda forgeries has so far extended
 only to checking on the appearance of the Berry Letter
 and its U.S. Pilot Letters follow-up in the London
 Daily Worker and the French CP daily 1'Humanite.  Both
 papers limited their coverage to publication of the non-
 Communist press agency releases, complete with the warning
 adjective used in the original releases.  Neither made any
 effort to elaborate upon the press-agency releases or to sell
 the propaganda theme to their own audiences as authentic.
 The only instance in which an internationally distributed
 propaganda forgery has been reported as receiving propaganda
 play in CP newspapers outside the Bloc has been in the forgery
 of the Czech emigre newspaper Ceske Slovo.  In the promotion
 of this campaign articles from the forged issue were quoted
 as authentic in two Communist Party newspapers in Graz, Austria
 (Neue Zeit and Wahrheit) and in the CP newspapers Volkstimme
 of Vienna and Zeitung of Luxembourg, as well as in the
 non-Communist Party but pro-regime Chicago paper
 Svobodne Ceskoslovensko and the Prague Communist Party
 daily Rude Pravo. In this connection, it may possibly be
 more than coincidence that the Ceske Slovo Campaign was
 the only one of the ten forgery campaigns of 1957-1959 which
 received no replay by Radio Moscow or in any other Soviet
 media.

 X - EFFECTIVENESS OF FORGERY CAMPAIGNS
 The effectiveness of a given forgery depends largely upon
 the area at which it is targeted.  In politically sophisticated
 areas such as Western Europe the forged "secret document"
 has been so heavily used by generations of secret police and
 political extremists (e. g., the faux Henry of the Dreyfus case
 in France, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion of Czarist
 Russia, the products of the Hitler propaganda machine in
 Germany, etc.) that any "disclosure of secret documents,"
 true or false, is apt to be greeted with public scepticism.
 Thus, public acceptance of the forgeries launched in obvious
 propaganda instruments much as the East German Neues
 Deutschland is so slight that Western installations in West
 Germany have decided in several cases that counteraction
 would be superfluous.  (As noted elsewhere in this study,
 the forgery technique has been used on a saturation scale by the East
 German intelligence units operating against West Germany
 and, to a lesser extent, against France.  This particular use
 must be regarded as a harassment device rather than as a
 propaganda instrument per se, since the number of forgeries,
 the regularity with which their falsity has been exposed, and
 the fact that many of them are self-exposing --
 e.g. , letters inducing their recipients to travel to non-
 existent meetings, parties, etc. -- makes clear their objective
 as nuisance rather than as propaganda. )
 In the underdeveloped areas, however, the level of
 political sophistication is low and the forgeries undoubtedly
 find some acceptance as "confirmation" of the propaganda
 charges which are constantly on the Bloc (and in some cases
 UAR) airwaves.  That the individuals who plan and direct the
 forgery operations agree with this thesis is suggested by the
 persistence with whichthe forgeries are replayed into the
 underdeveloped areas of the world.

 Another type of forgery whose possible impact is particularly
 dangerous is the "secret document" which is never published
 or replayed but is transmitted -- officially or by planting
 in covert intelligence channels -- to a Western or pro-Western
 government in an effort to incite mutual suspicion among the
 Western Powers and their pro-Western Allies.  Forgeries
 handled in this way have posed at times a threat of genuine
 damage to the relationships of the governments thus victimized.

 SSCCRITY Ir!PoR ATION
 - 2 - DEPT, Circular 11 April 17, 5 30 PM     CUNTRO. 2271
 4.  Under present circumstances continuation of the former
 course towards the U.A.R. can only embitter the Arabs Una
 throw them into the arms of the Soviets.  This necessitate,
 certain changes in the methods of pursuing our policy.
 The question is of some "liberalisation" of our reiatioa
 with the U.A.R.  No fundamental reappraisal of our policy
 is implied, of course; it is a temporary, tactical
 deviation prompted by neoeeeity.  Accordingly, release
 of Egyptian funds blocked in the U.S., a slackening of
 ttk restrictions on trade xith the U.A.R., and other
 ures are oeing contemplated at the present time.
 States has reconciled itself to his rule and is now
 willing to accept his terms, the inevitable result will be
 a cooling off of the U.A.R.'s relationa'with the Communist
 bloc.  That such a development is possible is evident
 from the many statements made in Egypt (even by Nasser
 himself) to the effect that the close contacts between
 Egypt and Russia have their roots in the refusal of the
 (rest to co-operate with Egypt on Egyptian terms.  An
 improvement in the relations between the United States
 and the U.A.R. is bound to cause suspicion in the 1!remlin
 and can, in the long run, weaken or even completely -
 disrupt the U-A.R.-Soviet relations.
 6.   It is imperative tnat the efforts to discredit the idea
 of the Syrian-Egrptian union :tith a view to driving a wedge
 between the twc countries snould continue unabated, for
 reparation of :Syria frc^ ^gypt remains our chief ob;,ective
 in the area.   Poth the internal forces which share the
 yell tern ideals and the external fortes which can, at an
 opportune moment, interfere into any possible events in
 1 the U.A.R. must be untiriarly consolidated.  It styould be
 remembered that disintegration of the LT..k.R. Will not only
 real the fate of 11aF!ser's c:gypt tut ,will also make it
 easier to fight back Arab nationalism, whatever shape or
 form it may take in the riddle cast.
 7.  Our efforts will obvious y be more successful if
 the U.A.R. ie Isolated frLm the rest of the Arab world.
 In view of this the tar of the U.S. diplomatic ara
 propaganda services in the Arab countries is to spread
 the general t.elief that the U.  .:i. constitutes a direct
 threat to the present Arab regimes.   In the monarchies
 it must be fnreetully explained that the strengthening
 of the U.A.R. male result in a downfall of the reigning
 dynan.tlesi in the republics, the fear to be swallowed u;j
 ~y the Cairo junta must be stressed by all means.   Finally.
 utmost advantage must be taken of every opportunity to art
 the Iraqi-iordanian federation, that will have continucus
 U.G. support, ens niayria       t1a union.
 8.  The present circular provides general orientation
 for the U.L7. diplomatic repreeentativee in the Middle Bast.
 Pore detailed instructions will be forwarded separately
 to respective reoresentatives.

 AMERICAN COLONIALISM
 HONGKtiNG  American newspapers recently published
 many t'vitorts fearful of the spread of anti-American
 fires over the, count, tea  of  South-East Asia.  The New

 for the anti-Amen an attacks on Formosa "because
 Formosa militarily   and      economically  has been little
 more than an Amen 'an colony." The report pointed out
 that the Formosa uprising is not an isolated episode, but
 shows how deep tht latent Asian hostility is.
