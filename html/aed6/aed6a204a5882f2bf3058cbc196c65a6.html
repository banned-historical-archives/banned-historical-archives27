 The detonation occurred at a depth of slightly
 more than 100 meters and was completely contained,
 according to the chairman of India's Atomic Ener
 Commission, Dr. H. N.  Sethna.
 Dr. Sethna also claimed that the device was de-
 veloped entirely by India and that all components,
 including the plutonium, were produced locally.  The
 device reportedly utilized the "implosion" technique,
 a more sophisticated approach than the "gun assembly"
 method used by the US in the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
 Dr. Sethna was noncommittal when asked if any
 more tests were planned.   The New Delhi press, however,
 reported yesterday that a series of nuclear explosions
 will be carried out.   No program was disclosed, but
 Indian officials are said to have stated that the pur-
 pose would be to develop atomic devices for use in
 mining, canal construction, and deepening and widening
 of ports.  They deny any intention to produce nuclear
 weapons, but there undoubtedly will be strong pressures
 on the government to develop a military capability.
 The decision to go ahead at this time probably
 was made in order to boost India's sagging interna-
 tional prestige and to divert public attention from
 the government's mounting domestic problems.   The

 Lndian press has responded to the test with an out-
 burst of enthusiasm and national pride.
 1n a hard-hitting public statement, Pakistani
 Prime Minister Bhutto insisted that Pakistan would
 never be intimidated by the threat created by India's
 nuclear capability.   He said that Pakistan would at-
 ;:empt to secure political assurances against India's
 use of such a nuclear threat and that the foreign
 secretary was being sent to China, France, and the
 UK, while he himself would raise the matter with
 that conclusion o  a no-war pac , proposed by India
 i.n x971, is out of the question now because such a
 pact would amount to capitulation to blackmail.
 Peking's initial reaction was a terse,  factual
 announcement broadcast by the New China News Agency's
 domestic service some 24 hours after the test.   Chi-
 nese spokesmen have thus far refused to make any com-
 ment to the press.
 China has much to sort. out in formulating a sub-
 ;3ta.ntive response.   Peking has consistently maintained
 that its own nuclear capability is purely defensive
 ~ynd is aimed solely at breaking the nuclear monopoly
 of the "superpowers." The Chinese have opposed nu-
 clear arms limitations proposals, particularly the
 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, on the grounds that they
 contribute to this monopoly.   Peking has refused,  for
 example? to take a stand against France's development
 of independent nuclear capabilities, pending an inter-
 nalionai agreement banning all nuclear weapons,
 The Indian test, however, has direct security
 implications for China.   Peking has long looked on
 New Delhi as a rival in Asia, and relations between

 the two cooled even further after India became a
 Soviet treaty partner in 1971.
 The Soviet news agency Tass called the test a
 "peaceful explosion" and said India was "striving to
 keep up with world technology in the peaceful uses of
 nuclear explosions."
 The Japanese predictably are showing dismay. Tokyo
 papers have denounced the test, which the Japanese
 are likely to view as an unsettling factor in Asian
 affairs.

 ISRAEL-LEBANON-SYRIA:   Israeli naval patrol
 boats yesterday shelled the Palestinian refugee camp
 at Ar Rashidiyah, the second largest camp in Lebanon.
 Beirut reported that Lebanese troops and Pal-
 estinian guerrillas damaged one of the Israeli patrol
 boats. Tel Aviv, however, claimed that all boats
 returned safely and that there were no casualties.
 Initial reports of Palestinian losses state that at
 least 5 persons were killed and 12 were wounded.
 Lebanese authorities reported that Israeli
 forces fired mortar rounds into Lebanon near Mount
 Hermon and into border areas between Tyre and Qiryat
 Shemona on Friday night.
 Ground fighting between Israel and Syria was
 light over the weekend, with only sporadic artillery
 and mortar fire being exchanged.

 *FRANCE:   Independent Republican Valery Giscard
 d'Estaing was elected President of France yesterday
 by a razor-thin margin.
 With 95 percent of the votes counted, Giscard
 had won 50.7 percent and Socialist Francois Mitterrand
 49.3 percent in a record turnout.   Computer projec-
 tions indicate that the final margin between the two
 candidates may be less than one percent, but French
 officials did not suggest last night that a recount
 was planned.
 Giscard claimed his prize in a late-night tele-
 vised speech, which he immediately repeated in English.
 The press is already interpreting the move as his
 first effort to improve the tone of French-US rela-
 tions.
 Mitterrand conceded at midnight.   His ally,
 Communist party chief Georges Marchais, added that
 leftist deputies would immediately demand action on
 discard's promised social and economic reforms-

 WEST GERMANY:   Chancellor Schmidt intends to
 name a new plenipotentiary for Berlin affairs, as
 part of his continuing effort to refurbish the
 government's image.
 According to the Berlin press, Schmidt will soon
 appoint Dietrich Spangenberg to succeed Egon Bahr in
 this key post.   Over the past year, West Berlin of-
 ficials have felt that Bahr was not adequately de-
 fending the city's interests in negotiations with
 the East. Germans,   The appointment of Spangenberg,
 coupled with Schmidt's expressed intention to take
 a tougher line in dealing with Eastern Europe, may
 convince the Berliners that Schmidt will pursue his
 own brand of Ostpolitik.
 Spangenberg, who has held the non-controversial
 post of state secretary in the President's office,
 should be able to improve relations with West Berlin
 Mayor Schuetz and to repair the ties between Social
 Democrats in West Berlin and Bonn.

 Labor Party yesterday overwhelmingly approved Prime
 Minister - designate Rabin's effort to form a coali-
 tion government with the two minor liberal parties.

 arrangement, including cabinet .representation.   Rabin

 *TURKEY:   Prime Minister Ecevit's Republican
 Peoples Party announced yesterday that the four-
 month-old coalition government could not continue
 in office.
 Ecevit is now conferring with the minority
 partner in the coalition, the right-wing National
 Salvation Party, whose failure to support the gov-
 ernment last week on a crucial amnesty bill put the
 viability of the coalition in doubt.   Formal resigna-
 tion of the government would usher in a period of
 uncertainty, as Turkey would have to undertake a
 fresh search for a government under the same diffi-
 cult circumstances that plagued its attempt follow-
 ing inconclusive parliamentary elections last fall.
 At that time it took the political parties three
 months to put together a coalition with the required
 majority.
 The alternatives now facing the government are
 a minority government led by Ecevit, some kind of
 caretaker regime, a new coalition, or elections,
 which no party favors holding soon.  Any of these
 solutions could involve a long political stalemate.
 The resignation of the government will have
 only a limited effect on the earlier decision to
 reconsider lifting the ban on opium production, as
 all parties now favor ending the ban.  A right-wing
 coalition, however, might be more sensitive to the
 implications that lifting the ban would have on
 relations with the US.

 AUSTRALIA:   The apparently slim margin of the
 Whitlam government's re-election reduces the likeli-
 hood of effective action on Labor's stalled legisla-
 tive program.
 Seesaw and extremely close election returns point
 to Labor's continued control of the House of Represent-
 atives and thus of the government.   The Labor major-
 ity, however, may be trimmed from the eight-seat mar-
 gin it had in the previous Parliament.   Senate returns
 are still fragmentary, and it is uncertain whether
 Labor will gain control over the upper house.   Whit-
 lam's frustration with the obstructionism of the
 opposition-controlled Senate led him to the polls.
 The chief Australian election officer says that
 the final composition of the House may not be known
 for two weeks.   Australian law requires that in case
 of a close House race, election authorities must wait
 ten days for absentee ballots to come in before pro-
 ceeding to a final count.   The tally of votes for the
 Senate will be particularly complicated under the
 complex Australian system of preferential voting, and
 the final Senate lineup may not be known for a month.

 VENEZUELA:   President Perez has made public the
 broad outlines of his plan to nationalize foreign
 oil companies.  Although he did not mention dates,
 he probably envisions acting within a year.
 Speaking on May 16 at the swearing-in ceremony
 of members of the Commission on Petroleum Reversion,
 which is to recommend within six months how the take-
 over should be implemented, Perez appeared eager to
 take the sting out of the prospective nationalization.
 He said the government intends to pay the companies
 "just compensation"--not greater than net book value--
 for their concessions and to encourage the companies
 to continue to participate in the Venezuelan oil
 industry after nationalization.
 After the takeover,  the government will preserve
 intact the structure of the three largest companies--
 Creole  (Exxon), Shell, and Mene Grande (Gulf)--with
 each remaining a separate enterprise.   The remaining
 companies will be merged into a fourth enterprise.
 A state holding company, distinct from the ministry
 of mines and hydrocarbons, will exercise control over
 production.
 The foreign oil companies will probably provide
 management and other services under contract, and
 they are likely to retain marketing functions for a
 major share of Venezuela's oil production.   The
 announced structure of the nationalized industry rec-
 ognizes Venezuela's continuing need for foreign tech-
 nology and seems to confirm the increasing optimism
 of the companies regarding their future in Venezuela.

 SOUTH VIETNAM:   Communist military activity
 continued at a stepped-up pace over the weekend.
 Sharp ground fighting was reported in several areas,
 particularly near the capital of Tam Ky in northern
 Quang Tin Province.      Communist gunners shelled Qui
 Nhon, the capital of coastal Binh Dinh Province, with
 rocket fire.   South Vietnamese air bases at nearby
 Phu Cat and at Nha Trang also received rocket attacks.
 Nearer Saigon, the South Vietnamese have rein-
 forced the Ben Cat and Phu Giao sectors of Binh Duong
 Province with three armored and infantry task forces.
 They have also launched retaliatory ground and air
 strikes against elements of the Communist 7th and 9th
 Divisions, which late last week overran several out-
 posts and villages near Ben Cat district town and
 threatened the important. Song Be bridge leading to
 Phu Giao town.
 The South Vietnamese air force claims to have
 destroyed two of the estimated five or six tanks that
 supported Communist ground attacks in these areas.

 Region 3, which takes in the provinces surrounding
 Saigon to the west, north, and east, is in many
 ways the most important.   If the Communists are
 ever to defeat the South Vietnamese government, they
 must secure a large base in the region and then move
 on Saigon, the political jugular of the country.
 For many years, the Communists have sought to es-
 tablish and expand such a base in the provinces to
 the north and west of the capital, where they could
 take advantage of favorable jungle terrain, shorter
 supply lines,  and sanctuary in Cambodia.
 At times, their control in this area has been ex-
 tensive, especially in the provinces of Binh Long,
 Phuoc Long, and northern Binh Duong.   They were still
 strong in this area at the time of the cease-fire in
 January 1973,  although their influence over the pop-
 ulated areas elsewhere in the region had badly eroded.
 Since that time, Communist strategy in this region
 has been essentially to protect and expand their po-
 sition along the Saigon river corridor mainly with
 North Vietnamese units. Elsewhere in the region, they
 have used a mix of main force and Viet Cong units to
 try to weaken the government's hold through small-
 scale harassing attacks, sabotage, and terrorism.
 So far the government seems to have held its own
 rather well, defeating each important thrust by North
 Vietnamese units in and around the corridor and giv-
 ing up little or none of its control of the popula-
 tion elsewhere in the region.
 New Government Vigor
 One of the most important moves by the govern-
 ment was the assignment of Lt. Gen. Phan Quoc Thuan
 as commander of Military Region 3 late last year.
 Thuan considered that the South Vietnamese army was
 not providing adequately for the defenses of the
 capital city--especially in view of the new heavier
 weapons available to Communist forces in the region.

 Thuan immediately moved to strengthen these de-
 fenses,, constructing checkpoints, bunkers, and other
 works designed to hinder the forward movement of Com-
 munist tanks and heavy artillery pieces.   General
 Thuan also shook up the administration in the region,
 forcing a number of key changes in province chiefs,
 division and regimental commanders, and his own staff.
 Once these steps were taken, Thuan turned his at-
 tention to the Communist main force units. With few
 exceptions, all subsequent significant engagements
 in the region have been Communist reactions to Thuan's
 operations.   In February, a South Vietnamese foray
 into two long-held Communist redoubts north of Sai-
 gon caught the Communists by surprise and disrupted
 their buildup along the Saigon river infiltration
 corridor.
 Last month, Thuan decided to take on two North
 Vietnamese regiments along Route 2 at the border of
 Long Khanh and Phuoc Tuy provinces.   He overrode the
 timid counsel of the local commander.   The action
 reportedly resulted in severe North Vietnamese losses
 and disrupted the Communists'  link between two of
 their important base areas.
 Thuan followed up by pushing the North Vietnamese
 5th Division out of Duc Hue District in Hau Nghia
 Province, an area which lies next to government com-
 munication routes with Tay Ninh Province to the north-
 west.   This successful operation relieved the month-
 long siege of the Duc Hue ranger base.
 These aggressive operations have by and large
 kept the Communists on the defensive.   Blocked in
 their effort to strengthen their salient in the
 direction of Saigon, the Communists have turned to
 improving their position in Phuoc Long.   Part of
 their logistic spine from the highlands to Military
 Region 3 runs through the northwestern section of
 this province.
 The Balance of Forces
 Currently there are about 39,000 Communist regu-
 lars in the region--some 13,000 more than at the
 time of the cease-fire.   Major units committed to

 Military Region 3 include three infantry divisions,
 an artillery division, an antiaircraft division, and
 nine infantry, sapper, and armor regiments.
 The infiltration of armor, antiaircraft, and
 field artillery into the provinces north of Saigon
 in violation of the cease-fire provides the Commu-
 fists with more firepower than ever before.
 Opposing the Communists in Military Region 3 are
 about 94,000 South Vietnamese troops--three infantry
 divisions, one armored brigade, four ranger groups,
 and supporting artillery and territorial force units.
 The South Vietnamese plan to create a brigade re-
 serve force from the marine or airborne divisions
 stationed in northern South Vietnam.
 The government combat forces increased by about
 19,000 men in the past year and now are roughly two
 and a half times those of the Communists.   Govern-
 ment superiority in numbers is partly offset by the
 fact that government forces are spread throughout
 the region.
 What's Ahead
 The South Vietnamese are continuing to put pres-
 sure on some of the mayor North Vietnamese units in
 Military Region 3.   Last weekend, government forces
 began a major operation against the North Vietnamese
 7th Division to the north of the capital.
 This unit has a better combat record than the
 Communist 5th Division, and if the 7th chooses to
 make a stiff defense, government forces will find
 the going tougher.   Some of the heaviest fighting
 in the region since the cease-fire could result.

 On balance it is unlikely that any significant
 change in the balance of military control by either
 side will result
 The performance of Saigon's forces so far suggests
 the government can keep the military advantage in
 the region through the summer months.

 Arab League:   Arab foreign and defense ministers
 meet today in Cairo for a scheduled two-day session
 of the Arab League Defense Council.   Among the issues
 to be discussed will be the Arab arms industry, the
 current situation in the Middle East, and cooperation
 between the Arabs and the European Communities.   Arab
 League Secretary General Riyad stated yesterday that
 he would discuss with the Syrian delegation Damascus'
 request for an Arab summit meeting.
 China:   Chou En-lai's public appearances during
 the visit of Cypriot President Makarios this weekend
 indicate that he continues to be on a reduced schedule.
 Chou was absent from arrival ceremonies at the airport,
 but he greeted Makarios at the Peking guest house,
 conducted the initial round of substantive talks,
 and accompanied Makarios during a meeting with Mao.
 Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping stood in for Chou as
 host at a state banquet.
 Nigeria:   The Federal Military Government an-
 nounced May 18 that it has concluded agreements for
 Nigeria to obtain 55-percent participation in the
 operations of all five of the country's major oil
 producers, retroactive to April 1.   The companies
 have the option to buy back 75 percent of the govern-
 ment's share of the oil; Nigeria will still have more
 than 300,000 barrels per day for direct marketing.
 The agreements will raise Nigeria's oil revenues to
 more than $9 billion annually, up from an estimated
 $7.5 billion.
