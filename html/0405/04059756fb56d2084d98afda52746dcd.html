 Moscow's most recent reiteration that a German peace
 treaty "must be signed this year" was contained in the
 Soviet - North Vietnamese communiqud of 4 July.                       The Soviet
 leadership, however, has continued to provide signs of
 its interest in keeping open the possibility of nego-
 tiations on Berlin and Germany.   This was evident in
 the Soviet handling of the exchange of messages with
 the US on Independence Day; moreover,  there was an unusu-
 ally large turnout of top Soviet leaders at the American
 Embassy reception in Moscow on 4 July.   In the US-Soviet
 disarmament talks, which will be resumed on 17 July in
 Moscow,  the Soviet representative has repeated his
 position that further negotiations in a new forum would
 be desirable only if agreement is reached on a state-
 ment of the goals for these talks, including an agreed
 "program" for complete disarmament.   The Soviet note
 of 5 July on the nuclear test ban negotiations strongly
 reaffirmed the Soviet position and charged the US with
 preparing a justification for resuming tests.

 Bloc delegates at Geneva are pressing for considera-
 tion of drafts on Laotian neutrality and are refusing
 to discuss Western control proposals.                  The contending
 factions in Laos continue to mark time while awaiting
 further talks between the three princes on the forma-
 tion of a coalition government, and a recent effort
 to revive the Namone talks proved unsuccessful.   Mili-
 tary activity remains at a low level, but scattered
 guerrilla actions continue and small-scale enemy attacks
 were reported to the north of Vientiane and Pak Sane.

 The violent demonstrations by the Moslems in Algeria
 in response to the PAG's call for a day of               "national
 struggle" against partition of Algeria give strong
 backing to the PAG's refusal either to discuss parti-
 tion of Algeria or to consider separation of its
 Saharan territories.   The demonstrations serve as a
 warning of the tactics the PAG could use to oppose an
 actual French attempt at partition, which De Gaulle's
 recent speeches have suggested would be his next move
 if negotiations fail.   Increasingly skeptical that new
 talks would be productive,  the PAG reportedly is again
 preparing to bring the Algerian issue before the UN
 in September.

 It is unlikely that Iraq will attempt military
 action against Kuwait in view of the substantial British
 military build-up there.   However, Qasim might make a
 dramatic gesture such as the severance of diplomatic
 relations with Britain or nationalization of the Iraq
 Petroleum Company.   Arab criticism--echoed by the bloc--
 of the British military intervention is increasing;
 at the UN, both the USSR and the UAR have  demanded
 that British troops be withdrawn from Kuwait.

 Maj. Gen. Pak Chong-hui, architect of the 16 May
 South Korean military coup,  now has established himself
 openly as the strong man of South Korea.                  On 3 July he
 ousted Lt. Gen.  Chang To-yong, a potential source of
 opposition,  and three other officers of doubtful loyalty
 to himself from the ruling Supreme Council of National
 Reconstruction.   There are indications that Pak may
 next attempt to reduce the influence of younger officers
 who supported his rise to power but who he may feel are
 trying to impose their own views rather than follow
 his direction.   Such a move by Pak could precipitate
 a bitter and possibly violent struggle.

 Leopoldville politicians have still not adopted a
 common front on the policy to be followed toward the
 Stanleyville and Elisabethville regimes.   Interior
 Minister Adoula is pressing for an early reconvening of
 parliament, but Mobutu and Foreign Minister Bomboko are
 advocating "further consultations" among anti-Gizenga
 politicians.   The Katanga parliament, meanwhile, has
 repudiated most of the agreements made by Tshombd in
 Leopoldville.   Reports of political collaboration be-
 tween Tshombd and Mobutu, who will visit Katanga
 shortly, are contributing to unsettle the atmosphere

 6 July 1961
 EAST GERMAN DISCONTENT .       .  , ,  .  o  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  14
 The East German people are showing concern that
 Ulbricht's signature of a separate peace treaty with the
 USSR will destroy any chance for German reunification,
 curb East German access to West Berlin, and mean the
 continuation of their drab living standard.                 Food
 supply difficulties appear to have intensified long-
 standing dissatisfaction with Ulbricht among middle-
 and low-level party functionaries, who reportedly
 attribute the shortages to the regime's agricultural
 policies.   Industrial workers in some districts appear
 unresponsive to regime propaganda.   At the party central
 committee meeting of 3-4 July the regime moved to meet
 these problems by assigning high priority to the im-
 provement of the living standard and instituting a
 shake-u   in the to   economic planning apparatus.
 CROP AND LIVESTOCK PROSPECTS IN THE USSR .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  16
 Prospects for Soviet agriculture in 1961 appear to
 be better than average.   An unusually mild winter and
 a favorable spring should assure a good winter grain
 crop in the European USSR, and larger herds and better
 feed supplies point to a somewhat better year for the
 livestock industry than 1960.   Prospects for spring
 grain, however, are still uncertain,  particularly in
 the important Ne                       it moisture re-
 serves are low.
 YUGOSLAV   FOREIGN MINISTER TO VISIT MOSCOW   .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 17
 Yugoslav Foreign Minister Popovic will begin a visit
 to the Soviet Union on 7 July at a time of uneasiness
 in bloc-Yugoslav relations.   Moscow probably will make
 a special effort to gain support for its policy on Ger-
 many, and may hope to influence the neutralist conference
 this September in Yugoslavia.   The USSR will not find
 Popovic easy to deal with,  primarily because Belgrade's
 hand has been strengthened by the neutrals' increased
 ability during the past year to act collectively on
 the international scene.
 COMMUNIST  CHINA'S 40TH PARTY ANNIVERSARY   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 18
 Peiping played down the celebration of the 40th
 anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist
 party on 1 July,  probably primarily because of its
 domestic economic difficulties did not permit it to
 indulge in the claims of achievement customary on such
 occasions.   It does not appear that the USSR will pro-
 vide the help Peiping needs to solve its economic prob-
 lems; the communique signed on 19 June at the conclu-
 sion of the Sino-Soviet economic talks indicates that
 neither side was satisfied with the results and that
 economic relations have not been restored to their
 former state,

 PEIPING ACCENTS PEACEFUL APPROACH TO TAIWAN ISSUE   .  .  .  .   Page  20
 Chinese Communist leaders have seized several oppor-
 tunities recently to re-emphasize Peiping's peaceful
 approach to the Taiwan issue.   Mao Tse-tung, for example,
 has asserted that he has no intention of "shooting his
 way into a strong point like Taiwan,"and a leading
 foreign policy spokesman has declared that Peiping does
 not intend to take the island by armed force since such
 a course might lead to world war.   However,  in pursuing
 this "peaceful" tactic--probably dictated by recogni-
 tion of the present limitations of its strength--Peiping
 does not preclude the use of force if a suitable occasion
 should arise.
 Japanese observers view Prime Minister Ikeda's talks
 with President Kennedy as the beginning of a period of
 full-fledged participation in world affairs that will
 require Japan to accept increased international responsi-
 bilities.   Press coverage of the visit was unusually
 favorable; most of Japan's  political observers believe
 the trip has improved Ikeda's domestic position.

 EARLY INDEPENDENCE SEEN FOR KENYA   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .      Page  23
 London's announcement on 28 June that a new constitu-
 tion for Kenya will be discussed this year suggests that
 early independence is being considered for the East Afri-
 can colony.   In an attempt to secure the cooperation of
 African political parties, the British probably will soon
 release Jomo Kenyatta--the hero of Kenya's Africans who
 has been under detention for seven years for his alleged
 role in managing the Mau Mau terrorist movement.   However,
 Kenyatta's return to active political life would intensify
 fears among the minority tribes of Kikuyu domination,
 bring about the eclipse of some relatively moderate
 leaders, and cause many Europeans and Asians to leave
 the colony.
 GREEK POLITICAL SITUATION   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  24
 Passage of a new electoral law by Parliament on 23
 June has introduced pre-election atmosphere in Greece.
 The government may schedule elections for this fall; in
 any event, they must be held by May 1962.           The new law
 provides for a system of "reinforced proportional
 representation" for the forthcoming election but stipu-
 lates that all subsequent elections will be held under
 a majority system favored by the present government.
 The moderately conservative party of Premier Karamanlis
 remains the strongest political force in Greece, followed
 by the Communist-front EDA.   The non-Communist opposi-
 tion is fragmented, and some of its leaders may collabo-
 rate with EDA.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 WEEKLY REVIEW
 EAST-WEST RELATIONS
 Moscow's handling of the
 exchange of telegrams with the
 US on Independence Day appears
 to have been intended as a sign
 of the Kremlin's interest in
 keeping open the channel of
 communication established at
 Vienna, despite the strident
 Soviet line on Berlin.   Although
 Khrushchev's telegram to the
 President referred to the
 "urgent solution of problems"
 left by the war--i.e., Germany
 and Berlin--his greeting adopted
 a cordial tone, referred favor-
 ably to the Vienna meeting, and
 concluded with the assertion
 that "the Soviet and American
 peoples by right must go down
 in history" as having made a
 "decisive contribution" to
 peace.
 The turnout of the top
 Soviet leaders at the American
 Embassy reception on 4 July and
 Khrushchev's public display of
 conviviality also suggest an
 effort to keep tension over
 Berlin below a level which would
 foreclose the chance of nego-
 tiations.
 Soviet officials in pri-
 vate remarks had earlier pointed
 to the possibility of negotiat-
 ing on Berlin.   Arkady Sobolev,
 a top Foreign Ministry official
 and former ambassador to the
 UN, told the British ambassador
 that a hopeful sign was the
 fact that both Khrushchev and
 the President on the same day
 had made references to nego-
 tiations.   In a brief discussion
 with Ambassador Thompson, Deputy
 Foreign Minister Firyubin and
 his wife, presidium member
 Furtseva, indicated their con-
 cern over the Berlin situation
 but stated that it was necessary
 to be "sensible" about the prob-
 lem.   Furtseva also told the
 Canadian ambassador that it was
 necessary to settle the Berlin
 problem this "or next" year.
 a treaty with Germany must be
 concluded this year.   The joint
 Soviet - North Vietnamese com-
 muniqud of 4 July stated that
 further postponement was in-
 tolerable and that a treaty
 "must be signed this year."
 Soviet and most European
 satellite commentaries on the
 President's statement on Ber-
 lin have also adopted the general
 line that negotiations have become
 a distinct possibility, as a re-
 sult of the President's remarks
 and Khrushchev's speech of 28 June.
 Both Radio Moscow and the
 TASS account published in Pravda
 highlighted the President's
 "allegation" that the Soviet pro-
 posals were a threat to European
 and American security and that the
 United States was determined to
 defend its vital interests in Ber-
 lin.   Equal prominence, however,
 was given to the President's re-
 ported willingness to discuss the
 issues.   Warsaw speculated that a
 conference would materialize, prob-
 ably at the foreign ministers' level.
 Soviet press reporting of
 Western reaction to Khrushchev's
 28 June speech also gave the
 impression that attention was
 focusing on negotiations over
 Berlin.   Pravda's  editorial of
 30 June made this point by stating:
 "It is now the turn of statesmen
 of all interested countries to
 find mutually acceptable solutions
 by means of negotiations."
 In the final sessions be-
 fore recessing until the next
 meetings in Moscow on 17 July
 the Soviet representative at
 the Soviet-American disarmament
 discussions adhered closely to
 his earlier position.  He
 reiterated that negotiations
 in a multilateral forum would
 be desirable only  if agree-
 ment were reached                                                             on  a
 Moscow, however,  has main-         program for  complete and
 tained its public position that             general    disarmament.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 In a final lengthy recapitula-
 tion of Moscow's position, So-
 viet chief representative `Lorin
 stressed that the best way to
 proceed would be to consider
 specific proposals, that com-
 plete and general disarmament
 was the only solution, and that
 the USSR remained prepared to
 accept any US controls if the
 Soviet disarmament scheme were
 accepted.
 In answer to a series of
 US questions, Zorin provided
 some evidence that the Soviet
 objective was a general state-
 ment along the lines of the In-
 dian resolution submitted at the
 last General Assembly.   He in-
 dicated that this resolution
 might provide common ground for
 an agreement,  if the United
 States was prepared to work on
 both a full treaty and certain
 initial measures without preju-
 dicing the goal of complete
 and general disarmament.   He
 asked whether the US could ac-
 cept the Indian resolution or at
 least part of it.
 This line suggests that
 when the talks resume in Moscow
 the USSR may intend to propose
 a dual approach.   The Soviets
 previously have hinted that they
 might be inclined toward two
 sets of disarmament talks,  cov-
 ering initial measures in one
 conference and a complete treaty
 in the other.   Such an approach
 would be used by Moscow as an
 opportunity to support the pro-
 posals to incorporate the nuclear
 test ban as a first step in the
 context of general disarmament,
 and thereby attempt to prolong
 the current negotiations in
 Geneva.
 The Soviet note of 5 July,
 replying to the US note of 17
 June on the nuclear test ban
 negotiations, strongly reaffirmed
 the    uncompromising Soviet
 stand and charged the US with
 attempting to delay indefinitely
 the conclusion of an agreement
 not only on nuclear testing but
 also on general disarmament.
 In a long polemic, Moscow accused
 the  US  of  being interested
 only in preparing a justifica-
 tion for resuming tests.
 The note contended that
 the US made a nuclear test ban
 a preliminary condition to gener-
 al. disarmament in order to dis-
 rupt negotiations on both issues.
 It further claimed that hopes
 for a re-examination of the ''ob-
 structionist" policy of the pre-
 vious US administration had not
 been justified.
 On the issues involved,
 the note repeated the same gen-
 eral line of the Vienna memoran-
 dum of 4 June and defended the
 Soviet "troika" proposals.   It
 contained no indication that
 the USSR would break off the
 Geneva talks at this time.

 The Communist bloc is con-
 -Lin.uing to represent the Zurich
 communique as evidence of  a
 significant reconciliation of
 the three rival Laotian factions
 and is pressing at Geneva for
 acceptance of the statement as
 an "official" declaration of
 Laotian neutrality.   In an ap-
 parent effort to sidetrack any
 discussion of Western control
 proposals for Laos, Soviet dele-
 gate Pushkin on 29 June proposed
 to the senior UK delegate that
 the conference consider neutral-
 ity drafts.
 The Polish representative
 followed up by calling on the
 conference in an address on 30
 June to adopt the Zurich deci-
 sions as the basis for a dec-
 laration of neutrality. Commu-
 nist China?s Foreign Minister
 Chen Yi on    July forcefully
 underscored the bloc's conten-
 tion that discussion of neutral-
 ity drafts be the next order
 of business.
 Pushkin agreed to meet with
 British and Canadian delegates
 on 2 July to review the latest
 instruction to the Internation-
 al Control Commission (ICC) from
 the Geneva co-chairmen, but he
 maintained stiff opposition to
 any change in the note and in
 fact reserved the right to with-
 draw it because the UK  had
 stopped the message in trans-
 mission.  The note, which was
 the result of weeks of wrangling
 over the ICC's lack of equipment
 to carry out its task in Laos,
 provided that materiel and trans-
 pormation for  the commission
 would be supplied by the three
 Laotian factions.   This aspect
 of the agreement, to which the
 Canadians raised strong objec-
 tions, would in effect give the
 Pathet Lao forces a veto over
 the movement of the ICC.
 The Chinese Communist an-
 nouncement on 3 July that Chen
 Yi was being recalled to Pei-
 ping stated that he would return
 to Geneva at "any time conditions
 warrant it."   In his farewell
 address to the conference Chen
 warned that the present state
 of affairs "must not continue
 any longer" and urged the con-
 ference "to proceed to substan-
 tive negotiations."   He said
 Western efforts to set up ef-
 fective controls in Laos amounted
 to "procrastination," which he
 said "will never ensure a peace-
 ful situation."
 The contending factions in
 Laos continue to mark time while
 awaiting further talks among
 the three Laotian princes on
 the formation of a coalition
 government.  The delay in the
 return of the various leaders
 from Europe makes it unlikely
 that talks can be resumed be-
 fore mid-July at the earliest.
 Souvanna Phouma has delayed
 his departure from Paris for an-
 other week to undergo an opera-
 tion, while Souphannouvong,
 stopping over in Moscow, Peiping,
 and Hanoi, is unlikely to reach
 the rebel headquarters in Xieng

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 after his concessions to Souvanna
 and Souphannouvong in the Zurich
 communique,  it now was up to
 the opposition to show a "con-
 ciliatory" spirit.   General
 Phoumi later claimed to  the
 press in Bangkok that it had
 been agreed at Zurich that nei-
 ther Souvanna nor Souphannouvong
 would be suitable as premier of
 a coalition government as both
 have been "too much involved"
 in the situation;  this asser-
 tion, however, is unsubstan-
 tiated by any other reports on
 the meeting.
 During brief stopovers in
 Bangkok en route to Vientiane,
 both Boun Oum and Phoumi held
 consultations with Marshal
 Sarit, who presumably argued
 for a hard line by the Vientiane
 government.   There is evidence
 that Thai leaders view the sit-
 uation in Laos with increasing
 alarm,  and Ambassador Young,
 returning to Bangkok after a
 four-week absence,  found the
 climate of opinion noticeably
 gloomier.
 At a ceremonial reception
 the King took the ambassador
 aside to inform him that there
 was considerable confusion in
 the Thai Government and that
 the  country   was   in danger.
 Premier Sarit also  recently
 told the ambassador   that he
 fears the effects of the Laotian
 situation may overtake Thailand
 before programs to strengthen
 the country have  any   impact.
 Foreign Minister Thanat has pre-
 dicted that Laos will be lost
 to the Communists if the Zurich
 communique is implemented and a
 coalition government organized
 under Souvanna; he also told
 the ambassador that "SEATO is
 all but lost."
 The  Laotian  government,
 Pathet Lao, and Souvanna dele-
 gations assembled informally at
 Namone on 3 July in an effort
 to revive the stalemated politi-
 cal and military talks,  but were
 unable to resolve their differ-
 ences over  whether   the ICC
 should be permitted to attend
 the sessions.   The Souvanna
 group has disputed the govern-
 ment's contention that an agree-
 ment to seat the ICC at the talks
 had been reached at Zurich.  No
 temporary compromise could be
 reached,  but another meeting
 is scheduled for 7 July.
 Military action during the
 past several days has been
 limited to minor skirmishes,
 generally resulting from mopping-
 up activity by the  opposing
 sides in their areas of control.
 The most noteworthy actions have
 been several probing attacks
 against government positions
 about 30 miles north of Vien-
 tiane and the occupation by
 anti-Vientiane forces of one
 post 30 miles north of Pak
 Sane.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 FRANCE-ALGERIA
 Recent PAG actions indi-
 cate that French threats to
 partition the country have only
 stiffened the resolve of the
 provisional Algerian government
 (PAG) to maintain the indivisi-
 bility and territorial integrity
 of Algeria and the Sahara The
 demonstrations against parti-
 tion-staged in response to the
 PAG?s call for a day of "na-
 tional struggle" by Moslems in
 Algeria--also serve as a warn-
 ing of more drastic use of the
 Moslem masses should France
 attempt to carry out its threat.
 The PAG communique on 1
 July stated that partition "would
 signify an indefinite prolonga
 tion of the waro..and, far from
 guaranteeing the position of
 the Europeans in Algeria, would
 compromise their future defini-
 tively."   French settler reac-
 tion has been obscured by the
 Moslem demonstrations.
 Ahmed Boumendj el , one
 of the PAG negotiators,  stated
 on 26 June that the PAG antici-
 pated no change in the French
 position and expected that re-
 sumed talks would last at most
 only a few days and then be
 definitely abandoned.   He said:
 that it was clear that the French
 would not accept the establish-
 ment of a truly independent Al-
 gerian state which included the
 Sahara.
 AG was prepared to make signif-
 icant concessions on bases,
 rights for European, and eco-
 nomic cooperation,  but could
 never agree to the "amputation
 of four fifths of Algeria."
 Top PAG leaders, meanwhile,
 have left for Morocco, Libya,
 the UAR, Mali, and Guinea in an
 effort to try to counter the
 French position that the dis-
 position of the Sahara must be
 decided by all adjoining states.
 PAG premier Ferhat Abbas went
 to Rabat, minister of armaments
 Ab.delhafid Boussouf is sched-
 uled to visit Bamako and Conakry,
 and deputy premier Belkacem
 Krim has gone to Tripoli and
 Cairo.
 They will probably suc-
 ceed in obtaining strong state-
 ments of support from the non-
 Saharan states--the UAR and
 Guinea--as they did from Saudi
 Arabia.   However,  the border
 states--particularly those un-
 der Arab rule--are likely to do
 no  more than soften their par-
 ticular demands until an Algerian

 settlement is reached and ac-
 cord public gestures of sup-
 port.            The PAG,              incensed par-
 ticularly by Tunisian President
 Bourguiba's public stand that
 the Sahara is an "African prob-
 lem," is probably also trying
 to muster sufficient support to
 force Bourguiba to modify his
 position.   The US Embassy in
 Tunis notes that,  since no com-
 muniqu6 was issued following
 the 1 July PAG meeting with
 Tunisian leaders,  it is doubt-
 ful that any understanding was
 reached.
 Paris has for some time
 conceded the inevitability of
 eventual independence for an
 Algeria minus the Sahara.  Since
 the recess of the Evian negotia-
 tions,  France has attempted--
 notably with De Gaulle's remarks
 on regroupment and his announce-
 ment that withdrawal of army
 divisions was to begin--to force
 the issue and get the search for
 PAG statements that their                a settlement moving again.   The

 irritation with Tunis,  but also

 points up their refusal to make
 concessiois and also suggests
 they feel that time is on ti- sir
 side and teat intern_a ti cna]_
 opinion will in the long run
 support them.
 reinforces earlier indications
 by the French that they tacit-
 ly accept the PAG as the spokes-
 man for the Moslem population,
 although formal French recogni-
 tion is rigidly denied.
 Should the bilateral nego-
 tiations be resumed, Paris will
 probably continue to refuse to
 turn over Algeria to the PAG
 without the formality of a ref-
 erendum.   An agreement between
 France and the PAG would permit
 both to support acceptance of
 the transfer in a referendum
 campaign.   An agreement satis-
 factory to France would provide
 at least minimal military base
 rights and assure political
 guarantees to European settlers
 and pro-French Moslems. T-71

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 KU/iAIT
 The British military build-   summer heat--inherent in re-
 up in Kuwait, which began with                    taming its forces there for
 the landing of marine commandos any considerable period and
 from the carrier Bulwark on 1
 July, has reached substantial
 porportions.   London announced
 on 6 July that the movement of
 British troops into Kuwait had
 been completed but that some of
 the heavy equipment following
 by sea will arrive later.   Brit-
 ish strength in Kuwait now is
 greater than Iraqi strength in
 the Basra - Ash Shuaybah area
 of Iraq.   Moreover,  the regular
 Kuwaiti armed force of about
 1.200 men has been sunnlemented
 It appears unlikely under
 these circumstances that Qasim
 will attempt a military move
 against Kuwait.  An official
 statement issued by the Iraqi
 Foreign Ministry on 3 July
 claimed that Iraq had never in-
 tended to use any but peaceful
 methods to "restore its legiti-
 mate rights in Kuwait."  The
 statement categorically denied
 that Iraq had concentrated troops
 anywhere and accused British
 "imperialism" of "-'spreading and
 fabricating reports" to justify
 the presence of British troops
 in the Persian Gulf area "under
 the pretext of protecting the
 Kuwaiti sheiks against an imagi-
 nary invasion."
 Qasim,  however, may soon
 undertake a dramatic anti-Brit-
 ish gesture of a different sort.
 Among the possibilities would
 be government-organized demon-
 strations against the British
 Embassy in Baghdad, severance
 of diplomatic relations, or a
 move to nationalize the Iraq
 Petroleum Company.
 London maintains that its
 forces will be withdrawn from
 Kuwait at the Ruler's request
 but does not anticipate that
 the crisis will subside suf-
 ficiently for such a request
 to be made until after 14 July--
 the third anniversary of Qasim's
 revolution.   Britain now is
 considering its next moves,
 particularly the many problems--
 including Kuwait's   extreme
 whether it would be advisable
 for a UN or Arab force to re-
 place them.
 Most of the Iraqi people,
 including a number of anti-
 Qasim elements,  have come to
 believe that Qasim's claim to
 Kuwait is valid and,  if only
 for nationalistic reasons,
 they think that their country
 should eventually absorb Kuwait.
 Most Arab governments              25X1
 on roue             25X1
 to oppose Iraq's   rig     to
 annex Kuwait.   However, Arab
 criticism of the British mili-
 tary presence is increasing,
 and the UAR has announced that
 it will not proceed with its
 plan to sponsor Kuwaiti member-
 ship in the United Nations
 until British troops are with-
 drawn.   Arab League efforts to
 mediate the Iraqi-Kuwaiti dis-
 pute have so far achieved lit-
 tle;   the "emergency" meeting
 of the league has been post-
 poned until 12 July.
 Kuwaiti representatives who
 arrived in New York on the eve-
 ning of 4 July began presentation
 of their case before the UN Se-
 curity Council on the following
 day.   An extraordinary session
 of the Council on 2 July had heard
 arguments expounded by Iraqi
 and British delegates.
 Soviet propaganda has fol-
 lowed up its initial factual
 account of the Kuwaiti crisis
 by accusing Great Britain of
 stepping up tension throughout
 the Arab world by its provoca-
 tive action, and at the 5 July
 UN Security Council session,  the
 Soviet delegate called for the
 "immediate withdrawal" of British
 troops from Kuwait. Moscow radio,
 meanwhile, continues to broadcast
 official denials from Baghdad of
 any Iraqi troop concentrations
 near the Iraq-Kuwait border.
 In contrast to the rest of
 the Communist bloc,  Peiping in
 effect took a public stand against
 Iraq in a message of 29 June wel-
 coming Kuwait's independence. The
 Chinese were apparently surprised
 and concerned by the speed of the

 SOUTH KOREA
 The ouster of Lt. Gen.
 Chang To-yong from the South
 a:(orean military junta on 3 July
 was a major move by Maj. Gen.
 Pak Chong-hui to establish his
 undisputed control of the pres-
 ent military' regime.  Chang, al-
 though largely a figurehead,
 was a potential rallying point
 for opposition to Pak.
 Chang's removal was quick-
 :Ly followed by the arrest of
 three other members of the rul-
 ing Supreme Council for Nati.on-
 l Reconstruction (SCNR) whose
 loyalty to Pak was doubtful
 nd the removal from active
 duty of 40 general officers of
 the army, navy, air force, and
 marine corps.
 In an obvious attempt to
 discredit the former civilian
 government, the regime has pub-
 licly accused former Prime Min-
 ister Chang Myon, who is South
 Korea's leading Roman Catholic
 layman, and 11 of his polit-
 ical associates of being Com-
 munist collaborators. A prec-
 edent has been established for
 similar action against in-
 tellectuals and students.
 There are indications that
 Pak may next attempt to reduce
 the influence of the clique of
 younger field-grade officers
 in the SCNR who were prominent
 with him in the planning and
 execution of the 16 May coup.
 The 40 officers removed
 were largely rear-echelon dead-
 wood or had undesirable politi-
 cal affiliations..   Some had
 been involved in past corrup-
 -.ion, and the regime announced
 that all ha.d "voluntarily" re-
 tired to make way for the promo-
 t.:ion of junior officers.
 Pak's brother-in-law,
 national security boss Lt. Col.
 Kim Chong-pil,  is a leader of
 the impatient reform-minded
 younger element.  As the head
 of the recently formed central
 intelligence agency, Kim has
 been moving to consolidate in
 police-state fashion all security
 affairs under his and presumably
 Pak's control.  However, his
 loyalty to Pak is uncertain.
 Inasmuch as some of Pak's strong-
 est support has dome from the
 younger officer group, an
 attempt to reduce their power
 could precipitate a bitter and
 possibly violent power struggle
 within the junta.                    25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Moderate Leopoldville poli-
 ticians still have not adopted
 a common front on the policy to
 be followed toward the Stanley-
 ville and Elisabethville   re-
 gimes.   The reconvening of par-
 liament has consequently been
 further postponed,  and an early
 meeting seems unlikely. Kasavu-
 bu on 5 July signed an order
 convening parliament on 15 July;
 however,  the provision that the
 two houses will hold their ac-
 tual first session on a date to
 be set by their outgoing presi-
 dents is expected to result in
 further delays.
 There is growing friction
 among Mobutu, Foreign Minister
 Bomboko, and Interior Minister
 Adoula--who have been dominating
 the Leopoldville  political
 scene.  Adoula, who seems to
 have the broadest parliamentary
 support of any Congolese, has
 been advocating an early meet-
 ing of parliament.   He has told
 American officials he hopes to
 reach a compromise with Gizenga,
 in which the Stanleyville lead-
 er would accept a minor role
 in a new government.
 Mobutu and Bomboko,  how-
 ever, seem doubtful that the
 moderates can control the legis-
 lature, particularly if Katanga
 maintains its present separatist
 course and refuses to attend.
 Bomboko recently  persuaded
 Kasavubu not to issue a decree
 calling for a parliamentary
 meeting on 3 July.   He  has
 since  modified  his  position
 somewhat  but still  believes
 that extensive negotiations
 among  the anti-Gizenga forces
 are necessary before the legis-
 lature can be  permitted  to
 assemble.
 Mobutu reportedly feels
 that too many concessions have
 already been made to the Stan-
 leyville regime and is prepared
 to take issue with Gizenga on
 procedural as well as substan-
 tive matters.   He stated recent-
 ly that he, Tshomb6, and the
 premier of Albert Kalonji's
 South Kasai state had agreed
 that the parliament buildings
 in Leopoldville, rather than
 Lovanium University on  the
 edge of the city,  should be the
 site of the parliamentary meet-
 ing.   He stated further that
 if this should be unacceptable
 to Gizenga, the Legislature
 should convene without repre-
 sentatives from Stanleyville.
 Economic considerations
 are still putting pressure on
 Gizenga to come to terms with
 Leopoldville. The Stanleyville
 regime has fallen behind in pay-
 ments to its troops, and Gizenga
 was forced to cancel an Independ-
 ence Day parade   on  30   June

 The Elisabethville regime
 continued its intransigent at-
 titude toward Leopoldville on
 4 July with a parliamentary
 resolution.--passed with less

 ating agreements made by Tshom-
 be before he left Leopoldville.
 The military agreement between
 Tshombe and Mobutu apparently
 is still in operation,  and Mo-
 butu has scheduled a visit to
 "his troops" in Katanga next
 week.
 Tshombe's absence on "dip-
 lomatic leave" probably will
 preclude any early change in the
 Katanga position. In the mean-
 time, UN officers who are nego-
 tiating with the Katangans over
 the retaining of Tshombe's
 forces report that Mobutu's rep-
 resentatives are doing little
 to establish their influence
 with the Elisabethville troops.

 Using the occasion of a
 visit to a new Czechoslovak in-
 dustrial and commercial exhibi-
 tion in Havana, Fidel Castro re-
 marked on 28 June that "we who
 have undertaken the road  of
 socialism are encouraged by all
 that they the Czechs7 have
 achieved, and we are sure that
 our people will follow the same
 road victoriously." The Castro
 regime's official  newspaper
 Revolucion  said on  30 June
 that the Cuban premier may visit
 Czechoslovakia in August. This
 would be Castro's first visit
 to a bloc country.
 Foreign Minister Raul Roa
 returned to Havana on 30 June
 after a 12-day stay in Prague
 and a three-day stopover in
 Mexico City following his par-
 ticipation in the preparatory
 conference of nonaligned nations
 in Cairo. He was apparently un-
 successful in an attempt to ob-
 tain an audience with Mexican
 President Lopez Mateos
 The Cuban delegation at
 Cairo,   under Roa's aggres-
 sive                                                              leadership, successfully
 pressed  to  have  Mexico,
 Brazil,  Ecuador, and Bolivia
 invited  to  the forthcoming
 full  conference,  according
 to Roa;  of  these,  only Bra-
 zil   sent an   observer   to the
 Cairo meeting. There   is  as
 yet no    evidence  that  any
 of    these  four  nations plan
 to  attend,  however.

 As a result of Soviet
 prodding, party leader Ulbricht
 since December has followed
 certain "soft" policies to-
 ward the East German populace
 and has refrained for the most
 part from harassing West Berlin.
 The motives are to reduce pub-
 lic antipathy to his regime,
 to improve its image abroad,
 and especially to reduce the
 flow of refugees to West Berlin.
 He has encouraged East Germans
 to air their grievances by
 submitting petitions to the
 Council of State, which he
 heads, and has removed un-
 popular and ineffective offs.-
 cials on charges of "sectar-
 ianism."  Above all, he gave
 the people reason to hope for
 a steady improvement of their
 unsatisfactory standard of
 living as well. as for a diminu-
 tion of party demands on pro-
 fessional men and intellectuals.
 Whatever benefits may have
 accrued to the regime in terms
 of a less restive population,
 however,  appear to have dis-
 sipated quickly with the USSR's
 end hopes for German reunifi-
 cation, curb East German access
 to 1iest Berlin, and mean the
 indefinite continuation of
 their drab existence.
 Contributing to the change
 of public attitudes has been
 a coincidental period of sharp
 --although probably short-term
 --food supply difficulties.
 The US Mission in Berlin re-
 ports that, as a result of the
 unsatisfactory food situation
 and the threat to West Berlin,
 the population reflects a mood
 of "profound discouragement."
 Middle- and lower-level func-
 tionaries of the Socialist
 Unity party (SED) are openly
 blaming Ulbricht's collectivi-
 zation policies for shortages
 of meat and dairy products.
 Industrial workers are said to
 be increasingly unresponsive
 to SED propaganda, because of
 the regime's inability to satis-
 fy their demands for improved
 supplies of foodstuffs and eon-
 sumer goods.

 indicated considerable anxiety
 as to why the USSR and East
 Germany were forcing the
 peace treaty issue at this
 time.
 Ulbricht's "soft" poli-
 cies, moreover,  have not re-
 duced the refugee flow:   19,198
 East Germans fled this June,
 compared with 17,888 last June.
 The combined flow to West Ber-
 lin and West Germany during
 the first six months of 1961
 totaled 103,159, as against
 88,506 in the same period last
 year.
 Ulbricht and his henchmen
 are seeking to convince the
 population through numerous
 public statements that the re-
 gime is here to stay, will in-
 evitably be recognized by the
 Western powers, and will achieve
 international recognition as
 a United Nations member.
 In an effort to alleviate
 discontent,  the SED central com-
 mittee plenum of 3-4 July issued
 a communique calling for priority
 attention to measures for im-
 proving the standard of living,
 such as "guaranteeing supplies
 of foodstuffs,  industrial con-
 sumer goods, dwellings, and
 services to people."
 The plenum also made major
 changes in the regime's top eco-
 nomic planning apparatus.  Pol-
 itburo member Bruno Leuschner
 has relinquished the chairman-
 ship of the State Planning Com-
 mission, but he remains a deputy
 premier with the task of coordi-
 nating economic planning.   As
 new chairman of the planning
 commission, Karl Mewis, former
 SED leader in Rostock District,
 will be responsible for short-
 term planning--a highly vulner-
 able spot.
 Politburo member Alfred
 Neumann, who has had over-all
 charge of party cadre matters
 since 1957,  is to head the new-
 ly created People's Economic
 Council--in charge of long-term
 planning at the Council of Min-
 isters level,   Erich Apel has
 moved from chief of the polit-
 buro's economic commission to
 become SED central committee
 secretary for economic affairs;
 he was also made a candidate
 member of the politburo.
 Neither Mewis nor Neumann
 has had previous high-level eco-
 nomic planning experience.   They
 apparently are to use their admin-
 istrative talents along with       25X1
 Apel and Leuschner to make the
 economy

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 After two mediocre crop
 years, prospects for Soviet
 agriculture in 1961 appear
 better than average.   An
 unusually mild winter and a
 favorable spring should assure
 a good winter grain crop in the
 European USSR,  and larger herds
 and better feed supplies point
 to a somewhat better year for
 the livestock industry than
 1960.   Prospects for spring
 grain, however,  are still
 uncertain, particularly in the
 important New Lands area where
 soil moisture reserves are low.
 Weather during the remainder of
 the growing season will be a
 critical factor.
 In contrast to the previous
 year--when about 20,000,000 acres
 had to be reseeded to spring
 crops because of winter kill and
 spring dust storms--temperature
 and precipitation in the Euro-
 pean USSR this past winter and
 spring averaged well above nor-
 mal.   The Soviet press has
 described the condition of winter
 grains as varying from "satis-
 factory" to "excellent."  Plans
 for spring seeding, which was
 slowed somewhat by rains in
 late April and early May, have
 been overfulfilled for most
 major crops.   The recent rains
 have interfered with the culti-
 vation of spring crops, however,
 and since winter grains in the
 Ukraine are unusually tall,
 lodging may present a harvesting
 problem.
 Spring came very early in
 the New Lands, and spring seed-
 ing,                 particularly in Tselina
 Kray in northern Kazakhstan,
 was completed earlier than in
 previous years.   Precipitation
 was near normal during the
 winter, but it tapered off in
 the spring,  and soil moisture
 reserves at the end of May were
 low.   In recent weeks the New
 Lands have experienced ex-
 ceptionally high temperatures
 which have caused a rapid loss
 of soil moisture.
 The relatively mild, moist
 winter and early spring have
 aided the Soviet livestock
 industry.   The Soviets apparent-
 ly entered 1961 with a consider-
 ably better feed supply and some-
 what larger livestock herds than
 a year earlier.   However,  the
 total output of meat in the early
 months of 1961 was probably less
 than during the same period in
 1960.   According to Soviet re-
 ports, production at state
 slaughterhouses was 13 percent
 below that of the same period
 in 1960, when feed shortages
 caused distress slaughtering
 of livestock.   State meat pro-
 duction during the first quar-
 ter of 1960 was 35 percent above
 that of the same period a year
 earlier.
 There have been reports
 this past winter and spring of
 food shortages--particularly
 of meat.   Apparently these
 shortages were mainly in quality
 foods and were not widespread
 or prolonged.   Because of the
 great improvement in the supply
 of all types of food in the last
 decade and the regime's promises
 of improvements in the living
 standard, the average Soviet
 citizen probably expects more
 and is more likely to complain
 of a situation which in former
 years he would have accepted
 as normal.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 YUGOSLAV FOREIGN MINISTER TO VISIT MOSCOW
 Yugoslav Foreign Minister
 Popovic will begin a visit to
 the Soviet Union on 7 July, the
 first such high-level trip since
 the regime's trouble shooter,
 Vukmanovic-Tempo, journeyed
 there in January 1960. Popovic's
 trip was originally scheduled
 for early May but was postponed
 when Soviet Foreign Minister
 Gromyko attended the Geneva
 conference on Laos.  Since then,
 Popovic has had a full schedule,
 with a visit to The Netherlands
 .n late May,  attendance at the
 preparatory conference of neu-
 tral states in Cairo in early
 June, and the visit of Italian
 Foreign Minister Segni to Bel-
 grade in late June.
 The Popovic visit comes at
 a time of uneasiness in bloc-
 Yugoslav relations.   While re-
 lations at the state level be-
 tween Yugoslavia and the USSR
 are relatively normal, Belgrade
 was piqued by the original post-
 ponement of Popovic's, visit, and
 recent propaganda from both
 states shows much basic animosity.
 In early June, a Moscow broad-
 cast to Italy thoroughly con-
 demned "Yugoslav revisionism,"
 and Yugoslavia is currently
 publishing Dr. Zhivago despite
 past Soviet protests.
 In addition, Yugoslavia has
 just published a 13-volume col-
 lection of Tito's memoires, and
 portions thus far excerpted in
 Borba, Belgrade's leading daily,
 ha-"e portrayed Soviet foreign
 policy in the days leading up
 to ,Vorld  ,Var II in a most un-
 favorable light.   Presumably,
 similarly adverse descriptions
 of more recent Soviet policies
 will follow.   Yugoslavia's re-
 l.atons with the other bloc
 states, with the exception of
 Poland and Fast Germany, range
 from poor to bad.
 Belgrade probably believes
 that Popovic's visit will be
 beneficial, nonetheless, as a
 source of information and pres-
 tige.   The Yugoslavs hope to
 gain insights into current dif-
 ferences among members of the
 bloc--particularly the Soviet-
 Albanian feud--and will play
 up the trip as proof that the
 Kremlin cannot ignore Yugo-
 slavia's role in international
 affairs,  no matter how strongly
 it condemns Belgrade's "re-
 visionism." Popovic may also
 hope to learn the extent to
 which Yugoslav ideology may be
 attacked in the "coming debate
 of the theses for the 22nd So-
 viet party congress.
 The Soviets, for their
 part, probably hope to gain
 greater Yugoslav support for
 their current foreign policies,
 particularly on the German ques-
 tion,                                                                since Yugoslavia is the
 only non-bloc state which main-
 tains diplomatic relations with
 East Germany.   Moscow may also
 hope to exert some influence
 on the neutralist summit con-
 ference scheduled to convene
 in Belgrade on 1 September.
 Shortly after the conclusion
 of the preparatory conference
 in Cairo, the Soviet charge
 paid an urgent call on Tito.
 The USSR will not find
 Popovic easy to deal with, pri-
 marily because Belgrade's hand
 has been strengthened by the
 neutrals' increased ability
 during the past year to act col-
 lectively on the international
 scene.   While Belgrade has re-
 iterated its general support of
 the Soviet line on Germany and
 Berlin, it has disapproved of
 the details of Khrushchev's
 scheme to reorganize the UN and
 of his plan to merge the nuclear
 testing and disarmament issues.
 The visit will demonstrate to
 Moscow that Belgrade's support
 cannot be expected on as many
 Soviet policies as a year ago.
 It could, therefore, exacerbate
 Soviet-Yugoslav relations rather
 than lead to greater cooper-
 ation in international affairs-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 COMMUNIST CHINA'S 40TH PARTY ANNIVERSARY
 Peiping played down the 40th
 anniversary of the founding of
 the Chinese Communist party on
 1 July.   Domestic difficulties
 --including a dislocated economy
 and serious food shortages--orob-
 ably loomed large   in the re-
 gime's decision to avoid a gala
 celebration.   The keynote speak-
 er, Liu Shao-chi,  admitted that
 "shortcomings in our work" as
 well as natural disasters had
 contributed to the present "tem-
 porary difficulties."
 Liu's address was largely
 a   reaffirmation of past party
 programs and provided few indi-
 cations of how Peiping proposes
 to solve the problems some of its
 ill-conceived programs have
 raised. Liu endorsed as "abso-
 lutely right and entirely neces-
 sary" the "three red banners":
 the general line,  the great leap
 forward, and the people's com-
 munes--Mao Tse-tung's hurry-up
 economic programs which contrib-
 uted   in large measure to China's
 present economic plight and its
 strained relations with Moscow.
 He revealed no economic goals
 for the coming year,  calling only
 for "all-out support of agricul-
 ture" as a way out of the cur-
 rent difficulties.
 Liu's fairly restrained
 and sober account of past his-
 tory and of the present situation
 was in marked contrast to the
 tone of braggadocio adopted in
 major speeches several years ago
 when the leap-forward programs
 were just beginning.
 Liu's speech contained only
 minimal praise for the Soviet
 Union.    He acknowledged Moscow's
 6 July 61
 contributions in experience and
 aid and endorsed last year's
 Moscow conference.   Soviet com-
 mentary on the anniversary cited
 China's "tremendous" contribution
 to the development of the world
 Communist movement.   Unlike Pei-
 ping, however, Moscow did not
 give Mao personal credit for
 China's success and emphasized
 the long way Peiping must yet
 go to achieve socialism.
 The continuing strain in
 Sino-Soviet relations was ap-
 parent in the communique issued
 in Moscow on 19 June following
 the signing of a new agreement
 on economic and technical coop-
 eration.   Conspicuously absent
 from the communique were any
 details as to the agreement
 reached.  .  Agreement on major:
 points at issue would be neces-
 sary if anything like the former
 schedule for the construction of
 large modern industrial facili-
 ties by the Soviets in China were
 to be met.   It may be that nei-
 ther party wishes public dis-
 closure of what is probably a
 significant scale-down of Soviet
 economic commitments to China.
 It is also possible that no mean-
 ingful agreement has yet been
 reached and that Soviet economic
 activities in China will remain
 subject to short-term political
 factors.
 The only clear-cut state-
 ment to date that Soviet economic
 assistance to China will continue
 at all was made by S. A. Skachkov,
 head of the government depart-
 ment which handles the USSR's
 foreign economic aid programs,
 at a reception following the
 signing of the agreement.   He

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 said the Soviet party and govern-
 ment, and Khrushchev himself,
 have "paid more attention to
 the requests of the Chinese
 People's Republic" regarding eco-
 nomic and scientific cooperation,
 and that the Soviet Government
 will provide technical assistance
 to the Chinese from 1961 to 1967
 in the construction and expan-
 sion of "large enterprises" in
 the metallurgical,  chemical,
 oil,  and machine-building in-
 dustries and in the construction
 of hydroelectric power plants.
 It appears from this that
 the new agreement is to cover
 the same period as the former
 oone--through 1967--and that it
 entails Soviet assistance--al-
 though in what form is not
 clear--in similar sectors of
 China's heavy industry.   The
 question of Soviet technicians
 has been left unanswered,  al-
 though deliveries of complex
 Soviet industrial equipment
 would seem to require the pres-
 ence  of at least some Soviet
 t,echni cians .
 There is as yet no evidence
 that Sino-Soviet economic rela-
 tions have improved significant-
 ly from the ambiguous state
 reached in the winter of 1960-61.
 Trade continues,  although de-
 tailed information on key items
 and the quantities involved is
 lacking; business activity be-
 tween the two countries appears
 on the surface to be "as usual";
 both parties have been circum-
 spect in statements concerning
 their economic relations.   What
 has not been said indicates con-
 tinuing strains in the relation-
 ship, and suggests that whatever
 agreement has been reached was
 not achieved easily, was not as
 "satisfactory" as both sides
 allege,  and does not constitute
 significant progress in restor-
 ing Sino-Soviet economic rela-
 tions to their former state of
 meaningful cooperation.
 On domestic affairs, Liu's
 speech disclosed that the Chinese
 party now has more than 17,000,-
 000 members,  an increase of
 3,000,000 since 1959.   He an-
 nounced that Peiping would ini-
 tiate a new "study" campaign--
 probably involving persuasion
 rather than the harsher methods
 of "rectification"--in order to
 overcome the confusion and loss
 of party morale which has re-
 sulted from the regime's recent
 setbacks.   Liu endorsed the
 regime's "hundred flowers" policy
 toward intellectuals,  also a
 policy of persuasion.   He gave
 no indication of Peiping's in-
 tention to hold a party congress,
 which constitutionally should
 be called in 1961.
 On foreign affairs,  Liu re-
 affirmed Peiping's determination
 to liberate Taiwan--without speci-
 fying a time limit--and repeated
 Mao's characterization of Presi-
 dent Kennedy as "more dangerous"
 than Eisenhower.
 The quiet celebrations in
 Peiping were attended by Mao and
 all of his inner core of lieuten-
 ants except Chen Yun and Lin Piao,
 Peiping apparently did not invite
 guests from other Communist par-
 ties.                                      25X1

 Chinese Communist leaders
 have seized several opportuni-
 ties recently to re-emphasize
 their "peaceful" approach to
 the Taiwan question.  This tac-
 tic, probably dictated by
 Peiping's recognition that at
 present it lacks sufficient
 armed strength to force its way
 onto the island,  does not pre-
 clude the use of force if a suit-
 able occasion should arise.
 Peiping's general outlook
 on the issue was articulated
 most recently by Liao Cheng-chih,
 central committee member and a
 leading spokesman on foreign
 affairs,  to a touring group of
 Japanese businessme
 EE   a transcript o     ao s re-
 mar s was telegraphed to Japan
 only after it had been checked
 and approved by the Chinese,
 According to this transcript,
 Liao explained that Communist
 China did not intend to try to
 take Taiwan with armed force
 since it feared such a course
 "might lead to a world war." He
 assigned no time limit to this
 forbearance,   but intimated
 that it might take "five or ten
 or even thirty years" to settle
 the issue.
 Other top Chinese leaders
 have been sounding the same note.
 Mao Tse-tung indicated
 he had no intention of "shoot-
 ing his way into a strong point
 like Taiwan."   Foreign Minister
 Chen Yi is on record with a state-
 ment late last year that Com-
 munist China "will not start an
 attack,"   Last week,  Chen told
 a Canadian television interview-
 ing team that China hoped to
 settle the Taiwan dispute peace-
 fully and was actively seeking
 such a solution.
 In his talk with the Japa--
 nese, Liao discussed several
 "possibilities" for the eventual
 solution of the issue.   He assert-
 ed that the problem might be
 solved by the departure of the
 Americans from the island, but
 that it would be necessary to
 "put pressure" on the US to
 achieve this end.  There is, in
 fact, some evidence that Peiping
 is trying to stimulate "pressure"
 on the US by free-world nations
 which have taken the position
 that the continued confrontation
 of strong US, Chinese Communist,
 and Chinese Nationalist armed
 forces in the Taiwan area poses
 a serious threat to world peace.
 Peiping's public statements
 contrast the "peaceful" Chinese
 approach to Taiwan with the per-
 sistent "aggressive" actions by
 the US in the area.  To support
 this Peiping recently has stepped

 pressure in the Taiwan Strait.
 Communist shelling of the off-
 shore islands is at a low point.
 There was no artillery barrage
 when Vice President Johnson
 visited Taiwan in May; in con-
 trast, President Eisenhower's
 visit a year earlier was greeted
 with a shelling of record inten-
 sity.   In addition, Chinese
 Communist air forces have avoid-
 ed several recent chances to en-
 gage Chinese Nationalist planes
 which ventured into mainland
 air space,   However, this fail-
 ure may have been due as much

 sought to convey the impression
 that all concessions in the past
 on the Taiwan issue have come
 from the Chinese side and that
 it is time for the US to take
 the initiative.   Chou En-lai
 Peiping has

 agree to withdraw its armed for-
 ces from Taiwan and the Taiwan

 dian interviewers that any set-
 tlement of the Taiwan issue
 "depends entirely upon the US,"
 Peiping probably estimates
 that even a partial withdrawal
 of US forces would significantly
 depress Chinese Nationalist morale
 and,  perhaps, open the door to a
 deal with Taipei on terms favor-
 able to Peiping,   This "possi-
 bility" was discussed by Liao,
 who saw a chance that eventually
 "all,  including Chiang Kai-shek,
 will return home." In this
 connection, the Chinese Com-
 munists continue their routine
 propaganda aimed at shaking
 Chinese Nationalist confide

 of displeasure in Taipei with the
 US over such developments as the
 overtures to Outer Mongolia have
 probably encouraged Peiping to
 think further along these lines.
 At the same time, Peiping
 remains    determined   to
 avoid  any diplomatic  action
 which  might be  interpreted
 as  formalizing  the  exist-
 ing division  between                                                            Taiwan

 the use    of force    in
 settling   the   problem,
 arguing    that  Peiping  has
 every    right   to   use
 force in    an   entirel
 domestic   matter.                      25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 JAPANESE REACTION TO PRIME MINISTER'S US VISIT
 The reception accorded
 Japanese Prime Minister Hayato
 Ikeda during his visit to the
 United States and his own forth-
 right assertion of Japanese
 views on international matters
 have received an overwhelmingly
 favorable response in Japan.
 As a result,  Ikeda approaches
 a scheduled conservative party
 and cabinet reshuffle with prob-
 ably greater personal popularity
 than when he first assumed of-
 fice a year ago.
 The Japanese press high-
 lighted what it viewed as Ameri-
 can recognition of Japan's im-
 portance to the free world and
 attention to Ikeda's views as
 signs that US-Japanese.relations
 have entered a new era of partner-
 ship.   Newspapers described
 Ikeda's explanation of Japan's
 position on such controversial
 issues as Chinese Communist
 representation in the UN and
 resumption of nuclear testing
 as possible only in a "frank
 exchange of views" between
 equals.
 Political commentators wel-
 comed the prospect of prior
 consultation on major,US policy
 shifts as giving Japan equal
 standin  with US allies in
 Europe.  They regarded this as
 assurance that the Japanese
 Government will not be "left
 behind" in any review of China
 policy, which they considered
 the "most important topic" of
 the Kennedy-Ikeda. talks.
 Several editorial writers
 have taken a new tack in point-
 ing out that Japan's new inter-
 national role will require the
 Japanese to accept increased
 responsibilities, especially in
 extending economic assistance
 to underdeveloped countries.
 The press previously has sought
 equality without acknowledging
 that it would involve additional
 Japanese obligations.
 Editorial interest now is
 shifting to the domestic politi-
 cal consequences of the visit
 as Ikeda faces party and probable
 cabinet reorganizations this .
 summer.   Most Japanese political
 observers believe that the trip
 has strengthened his hand in
 consolidating his political power.
 Nevertheless, Ikeda's rivals in
 the ruling Liberal-Democratic
 party eng;aY?ed in a form of
 mild opposition by initially re-
 fusin- to be on hand at the air-
 port to welcome the prime minister
 on his return on 30 June.   The
 major factional leaders did final-
 ly attend, but this should not
 be regarded as evidence of
 their future cooperation with
 Ikeda.   Acceptance or rejection
 of important cabinet and party
 posts in the forthcoming re-
 shuffle will be a more reliable
 indicator.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 EARLY INDEPENDENCE
 Britain's Kenya colony ap-
 pears headed toward early in-
 dependence,  despite recent po-
 litical factionalism and in-
 stability.  Jomo Kenyatta--the
 hero of the country's Africans
 who remains under detention at
 Maralal for his alleged role in
 managing the Mau Mau terrorists
 --has urged nationalist leaders
 to end their political squab-
 bling and work together.
 On 28 June, British Colonial
 Secretary Macleod announced
 that a conference would be held
 in Nairobi this year to consider
 a new constitution for Kenya and
 to discuss other pressing prob-
 lems.   Leaders of Kenya's two
 major African parties--in London
 to consider revising the organ-
 ization which administers inter-
 territorial public services in
 East Africa--said Macleod had
 agreed to consider a plan for
 internal self-government under
 an African prime minister this
 year.   Macleod's promise to
 study a new African demand for
 Kenyatta's release gave rise
 to widespread speculation in
 London that he would be set
 free within a few weeks.
 Prior to elections last
 February for Kenya's single-
 chamber legislature,  in which
 Africans achieved a majority
 for the first time, the two
 African parties campaigned for
 Kenyatta's freedom and stressed
 the importance of maintaining
 order.   The absence of major
 incidents during the elections
 led most Africans to believe
 that Kenyatta would be released
 at  once.   They were disappointed
 and antagonized by Macleod's
 announcment that, while Kenyatta
 would henceforth be more ac-
 cessible to African politicians,
 he would not be released until
 the security situation improved
 and the legislature began func-
 tioning satisfactorily.
 Following that statement,
 the Africans engaged in a period
 of political bickering  and
 maneuvering during which both
 parties refused to participate
 in forming a government.   In
 mid-April, however,  London per-
 suaded the smaller of the par-
 ties to form a coalition govern-
 ment with European and Asian
 support.   The other party re-
 taliated by pursuing a policy
 of obstructionism designed to
 topple the "stooge" government;
 it walked out of the legislature
 during a stormy session and
 threatened to boycott that
 body.
 A few days later, however,
 Kenyatta summoned leaders of both
 parties to Maralal, where he
 admonished them,  particularly
 those in the opposition,  and
 stressed unity of action.   He
 urged the establishment of a
 joint consultative committee
 under his leadership to coor-
 dinate key policy issues in the
 legislature,  allowing the two
 parties freedom of action only
 on unimportant issues.
 The tenor of Kenyatta's
 remarks at Maralal suggests that
 he is willing to forego Kikuyu
 nationalism, a key factor in the
 five-year Mau Mau terrorism:,  and
 work for the independence of a
 united Kenya using parliamentary
 methods.   All prominent African
 leaders and many settlers in
 Kenya have indicated a belief
 that conditions in the country
 will not improve until the re-
 lease of Kenyatta, whom African
 nationalism has elevated to the
 status of near-deity.   Neverthe-
 less his return to active po-
 litical life would intensify
 fears of Kikuyu domination among
 the minority tribes,  bring about
 the eclipse of some relatively
 moderate leaders, and cause many
 Europeans and Asians to leave
 the colony.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE `VEEP{LY SUMMARY
 GREEK POLITICAL SITUATION
 Passage of a new electoral
 law by the Greek Parliament on
 23 June has introduced a pre-
 election atmosphere.   There
 are reports of possible elec-
 toral coalitions and of immi-
 nent defection from one party
 to another.   There is no indi-
 cation, however, that the gov-
 ernment has decided when to call
 elections.   The most probable
 periods are September-October
 1961 or April-May 1962.  Greek
 national elections are held
 every four years,  and new ones
 must take place by May 1962.
 The new electoral law,  a
 product of long and acrimonious
 debate, is described as provid-
 ing for "reinforced proportion-
 al representation."   It requires
 two allocations of seats,  the
 first allocation based essen-
 tially on simple proportional
 representation.   Participation
 in the second distribution--
 the seats not allocated in the
 first--will be limited to those
 parties polling a specified
 percentage of the total vote:
 15 percent for single parties,
 25 percent for two-party coali-
 tions, and 30 percent for coal-
 itions of three or more parties.
 All elections after the next
 one will be under a majority sys-
 tem in which the party gaining
 the largest number of votes in
 a district wins all seats in
 that district.
 Having secured the new
 law, the moderate-rightist party
 of Premier Karamanlis can be
 expected to try to regain some
 of the support it has lost
 since 1958, when it won 170 of
 the 300 seats in Parliament
 with 41 percent of the popular
 vote.   Moves anticipated include
 settling farmers' debts,  raising
 prices  for agricultural prod-
 ucts and wages  for urban workers,
 and giving widespread publicity
 to all government efforts to
 lift the standard of living.
 Karamanlis also has been reported
 contemplating changes in his
 government to bring in more ef-
 fective leadership.   Efforts
 to encourage defections by
 prominent opposition politicians
 reportedly are also under way.
 The non-Communist opposi-
 tion parties which make up the
 political center remain frag-
 mented,  and the public is ap-
 athetic to their attempts to win
 support. A provision of the
 electoral law that at least
 three parties will share in the
 second distribution of seats
 was publicized by the govern-
 ment as a concession designed
 to strengthen the center.   It
 appears more likely,  however,
 to prevent the unification of
 the center and thus may further
 weaken the non-Communist oppo-
 sition.  At least two of the
 several center parties appear
 hopeful of being the third
 party behind the two largest
 parties, the government party
 and the Communist-front EDA.
 In 1958 the parties of the center
 won about 34 percent of the pop-
 ular vote, but they seem to have
 lost much of this support since
 then.
 EDA, meanwhile,  faces the
 forthcoming national elections
 with a large, well-organized
 party and the support of the
 proscribed Communist party of
 Greece. In 1958, EDA surprised
 many Greek political analysts
 by winning nearly 25 percent of
 the popular vote to become the
 major opposition party.  In 1952,
 the last previous election in
 which EDA ran as a single party,
 it had captured less than 12
 percent of the vote. Today EDA
 is estimated to have the support
 of at least 30 percent of the
 electorate.  EDA spokesmen have
 called for a popular front--at
 least an electoral coalition--
 with the center parties to defeat
 Karamanlis. No party leader has
 yet accepted the offer, but
 several are believed negotiating
 with EDA.   Should no coalition
 be formed, several individual
 deputies from nationalist oppo-
 sition parties may defect to EDA.
