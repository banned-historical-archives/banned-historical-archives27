 VII.   AN APPRAISAL OF THE SYSTEM . 68
 STAFFING PROCEDIJR,ES AID PROT~~MS  IN COMA~NIST CHINA
 I .   I NTRODtJCT I ON
 This is a study of the  theor~,$ and practice of
 personnel management in Commun~.s~~ China .?  It endeavors
 to draw together information on how Chinese skilled
 manpower and talent are selected, motivated, advanced
 and organized in the pursuit of national goals.  It
 begins with a consideration of personnel requirements
 at the senior levels of the party, surveying the broad
 functions performed and sketching out the background
 and character of the incumbents.  It then takes a look
 at the mechanics for staffing ~rarious echelons of-the
 party.-  This is followed by an examination of how the
 party actually handles its personnel.
 These chapters are followed by a discussion, ar-
 ranged along similar lines, of the requirements for
 top government executives, the system of government
 personnel administration and how it operates in prac-
 tice.  A special chapter is devoted to the armed forces.
 Later chapters take up in turn the educational
 system and the means used by the leaders to communi-
 cate with lower levels of the administrative apparatus
 and the Chinese people.  The concluding section is a
 general assessment. of the strengths and weaknesses
 of the whole system.
 Several characteristics of the Chinese Commun-
 ists' approach to this problem are, we think, deserv-
 ing of special mention.
 1.  A striking feature of the Chinese -system,
 even in comparison with its Soviet counterpart, is
 the pervasiveness of party control and manipulation.
 Positions of real authority anywhere in China are
 without exception held by party members.  In fact,
 no level of government, no military, scientific,
 economic or educational organization, no activity
 of any moment is without its part^yAgroup, the mem-
 tiers of which effectively run the unit.  Advance-
 ment is unlikely if the party does not approve.
 2. .Stability in the highest reaches of the
 party has been unusual for a system which in other
 places has bred frequent change.. Sao Tae-tong has
 been the dominant figure for nearly three .decades.
 He has kept around him a group of associates he
 trusts.  Today, these men are old and overworked.
 They present an all but immovable roadblock against
 aspirants to high office.  And it has also proven
 a difficult matter to insinuate new concepts, es-
 pecially in technical fields,.into the policy making
 process.  The leaders tend to turn for advice to
 party figures wha share the experiences and prej-
 udices of the leaders.
 3.  Personnel management is highly centralized.
 The system allows the men who determine national
 security programs to commit available talent to these
 programs in complete freedom.- There is no outside
 competition for talent.
 4.  China is, however, very short of top-flight
 talent--administrators, managers, scientific research-
 ers,~tutors for graduate students, technicians, etc.
 Still the Chinese leaders misuse what they do have by
 a dogmatic refusal to trust fully those educated a~
 broad, whether in the USSR or the hest, and by forc-
 ing everyone to spend much time in political indoc-
 trination.
 5.  These political indoctrination programs and
 the absolute control of all media of communication
 permit the leaders to disseminate only such informam
 tion as they think fitting.  This .has contributed
 to a unity of purpose throughout the system and a
 willingness to work hard at tasks set by the leaders,
 though the degree of dedication today is not what it
 was several years ago.
 National security policy in Communist China is
 directed to building China over-the shortest histori-
 cal span possible into a strongg modern leader of na-
 tions with all the paraphernalia of power that implies.
 The goal is a China respected for its military and pow
 litical power, honored for its culture, turned to for
 its principled interpretation of Communist doctrine;
 in short, a China restored to its rightful leading
 role in the world.  The present leaders are dedicated
 to the proposition that this can only be done through
 the development of an authoritarian, Communist system
 of government in China.
 The Chinese Communist Party, in power throughout
 mainland China since 1949, is still in the early phases
 of a big construction effort. -The attempts of the lead-
 ers in 1958-1960 to accelerate the process through '-'leap
 forward" practices were a dismal failure,  The country
 is groping its way out of the rubble of that disaster.
 It did not, however, shake the leadership out of the
 conviction that its cause and course are correct.  Nor
 has it shaken the present leaders-from their dominant
 positions.
 Staffing Requirements at Senior Levels
 Ultimate power,. in the Chinese Communist system,
 rests in one man, whose qualities determine in great
 measure how the whole will operate.  That man now is
 Mao Tse-tong, father figure of the Chinese Communist
 movement.  The guiding principles and the programs
 by which the nation operates are in the final analysis
 his responsibility.  Many issues can, of course, be
 settled short of Mao, but he is the final arbiter.
 During the nearly three decades of Mao's steward-
 ship, the Chinese party has been transformed from a
 small, hunted band of revolutionaries fleeing to the
 barren hills of northwestern China into the ruling
 element of the largest single group of people on the
 face of the globe.  This record of success has made,
 and continues to mak?, effective challenge of Mao a
 very difficult proposition.
 To the Chinese party, Mao is the ';greatest revolu-
 tionary and statesman in Chinese history', and the most
 prominent communist "among all living contemporaries."

 Public speeches by Mao's foremost associates bristle
 with fulsome tributes to Mao's insights, wisdom and
 knowledge.  Practicing. experts in virtually any
 field--ideological,-economic, military, literary,
 scientific--are advised to improve themselves by
 studying Mao's wox?ks.  Chinese policies in all these
 fields are presen?~ed as owing much to the master.
 Mao Tse-tong, bo~~r~ the son of a rich peasant,
 has been a member of the Chinese Communist Party
 since it was formed in Z9~1, and has been its
 leader since 1935.  He is a man of supreme self-
 confidence.  For years he has shown an ability
 to adapt Marxist~JLeninist formulas to suit his
 own purpases as well as a certain talent for mak-
 ing the right derision at the right time.
 This talent may laerhaps be diminishing; at
 least,  his more r~:c:en~~ initiatives have not been
 notably successf~.Yl.  The great leap forward, the
 commune movement and ?~he challenge to the Soviets
 have all prayed singularly inappropriate to China's
 needs at this stage of its development.
 Mao is w~.deZy read in the literature of Marxism-
 Leninism.  He wri~~es will, frequently in a breezy
 style  full of  pitl:~y la~;r~,guage which appeals  to Chi-
 nese.  He his been able to attract and hold com-
 petent subordina~:es, and has shown an ability to
 balance them off, one against the other.
 He has been outside China only twice, in 195?
 and 195, both times to the Soviet Union.  His knowl-
 edge and understanding of the outside world are lim-
 ited.  His grasp of internal Chinese conditions may
 be slipping.         Humo:~?s have 'been trickling out of
 China for the past se~~era,l years that Mao's health
 has been declining.  ~7hatever the state of his
 powers, Mao's speeches and writings have diminished
 quite remarkably since about 195?.  1n recent years,
 he has spent a good deal of time in various vaca-
 tions spots away from the levers of power in Peiping.
 Standing just behind Mao in the power structure
 are his six colleagues on the Standing Committee of
 the Politburo.  This inner circle of advisors joins
 Mao in developing, formulating and coordinating
 China's domestic, foreign and defense policies.
 Considerable figures in their own right, they
 are widely experienced in party, state and military
 affairs.  They are expected to look at issues which
 come before them in a comprehensive, overall .way.
 They must watch the whole chessboard, not just one
 of the pieces.  Each of them, however, does appear
 to have a broad area of specialization.  Liu Shao-
 chi and Teng xsiao-ping seem to give the greater
 measure of their attention the theoretical and
 practical concerns of the party.  Chou En-lai's
 chief concern is the government and its foreign
 relations.  Lin Piao concentrates on military af-
 fairs.  Chu Teh, generally. inactive, sometimes
 serves as a spokesman for Mao.  Chen Yun spends
 most of his time on economic matters, though he
 has been out of the public eye for some time now.
 These are men with a long history of devotion
 to the hierarch, men who have thrived on decades
 of the vicious in-fighting which characterizes
 the system, men who are tough and ruthless, men
 who speak a common language and hold common views.
 They are men who have been conditioned by many
 years of party work to understand the time for
 debate and the limits placed thereon.  The effec-
 tive operation of the entire structure requires
 that the men at this Level be tightly knit.  They
 must know how and when to submerge differences
 and show a common purpose to the other layers
 of the party and to the people at large.
 The continuity of this group is remarkable
 for a system which in other countries and parties
 has bred frequent bloody change.  Turnover has
 been limited.  The five men who were on the party
 Secretariat in 1945 are still formally in the
 inner circle today.
 Ranking next to Mao is Liu Shao-chi.: To some,
 he appears a classic example of the faithful serv-
 ant.  They point to his .speeches with their many
 sycophantic passages, and speculate that he will
 not long outlast Mao.  However, Liu does wield
 great power in the party organization.  Mao has
 complete confidence in Liu's abilities and has..
 made Liu his heir apparent.  The party presents
 him as its leading theoretician, next to Mao.
 xis 1939 work, How to be a-Good Communist, was
 recently're-issued and nade~e subject of a
 special party study campaign.
 Liu is a somber and a somewhat colorless indi-
 vidual.  After he was selected to succeed Sao as
 head of government in 1959, an .attempt was made
 by the party's propaganda organs to paint a more
 engaging public picture of him.  The campaign
 seems to have died away with doubtful results.
 Liu's closest collaborator in party matters
 is Teng Hsiaomping, one of the youngest members
 of the inner circle.  Teng has risen rapidly in
 favor and prestige since the mid-fifties.  In
 recent years he has been the party's chosen spokes-
 man on a number of key issues, and in 196U played
 a large part in the Moscow.eonference of commun-
 ist parties.
 A short, bullet-headed. man, Teng is said. to
 be hard-driving and aggressive.  The party obvi-
 ously regards him as a good organizer and sound
 administrator.  His several strategic positions
 in the central apparatus give him. powerful levers
 over party matters.
 Chou En-lai, the only premier the Chinese
 Communist government has ever had, is perhaps
 the best known of the Chinese Communists in the
 West.  Handsome and urbane, Chou for years was
 the principal face which the Chinese Communists
 turned to the world.  He has travelled more than
 his colleagues in the inner circle and he may,
 as a result, have a more sophisticated view of
 the outer world.  He is by all accounts a skilled
 and resourceful negotiator.  He showed at the
 Bandung Conference in 1955 and in an early. visit
 to India that he is quite expert at building up
 an aura of Chinese goodwill.
 What should not be lost sight of is that
 Chou is also a veteran communist, a high-rank-
 ing member of the party for at least four decades.
 He was once ranked ahead of Sao and has shown
 a remarkable agility in getting along with who-
 ever happens to be in power.  Chows wife is
 the number two woman in the party.
 The other active member of the inner circle
 is Lin Piao.  He is the youngest.  A military man
 for his entire career, Lin had apparently been
 ailing for a number of years.  die leapt back into
 prominence following the disgrace of Peng Teh-huai
 in 1959.  Lin was one of the most successful generals
 produced by the Chinese Communists in their fight
 against the Chinese Nationalists.  His return coin-
 cided with a renewed emphasis on the supremacy of
 the party over the military.
 Standing just outside this inner circle are
 the remaining full (voting) members of the Polit-
 buro.  This-body has considerable importance as
 an advisory board, a discussion group and, some-
 times, as a voting body.  Decisions taken by the
 Standing Committee have the full force of a Polit-
 buro decision, but Politburo sanction may well be
 sought for major policy shifts.  A~eaningful voting
 in the Politburo is probably restricted to issues
 on which Mao and his inner circle have not staked
 out a definite position.
 The advice of Politburo members is likely to
 be sought prior to decision on a matter in which
 the individual member is expert.  A11 nineteen of
 the voting members are men with a record of thirty
 to forty years of faithful service to the party.
 They represent a variety of backgrounds and are
 capable of providing advice in many fields.  Here
 appear the top specialists in various aspects of
 party work:  Peng Chen has long been in party
 organizational work and has represented the party
 at important communist meetings abroad.  Tung Pi-wn
 is engaged in supervisory work, Tan Chen-lin is
 concentrating on agricultural matters, Lo Jung-
 huan is a senior figure in party control work in
 the armed forces.  Chen Xi, Li Fu-shun and Li
 Hsien-Wien are the party's top. specialists, re-
 spectively, in the government's foreign, economic
 planning and financial affairs.  Ko Ching-shih and
 Li Ching-?chuan are the top leaders in East and
 Southwest China and may bring regional points of
 view into the Politburo.
 No additions to the Politburo have been an-
 nounced since 1958.  Good bets for election to
 the next Politburo are Tao Chu and Sung Jen-ctxiung,
 heads of the Central-South and Nart.heast patty bu-
 reaus, respectively.
 ~ :~.
 Since Mao took over in 1955, only three men of
 Politburo rank can confidently be said to have been
 purged; Chang Kuo-too shortly afterwards, Kao Kang
 in 1954 and Peng Teh-huai in 1959.  Several have
 been demoted, others have died, but seven members of
 tae present Politburo were on the 11-man body elected
 in 1945.
 The presence of a number of party elders in
 these key groups should not be misconstrued. .Though
 they are relatively inactive, they do serve a definite.
 purpose by providing automatic support for Mao on any
 matters put before them.
 Another key top level body is the Secretariat,
 the executive office of the party for day-to-day
 operations.  It is under the direction of the Stand-
 ing Committee and the Politburo, and differs from
 these bodies largely in that it is, formally, a
 full-time body.  Although the counsel of its mem-
 bets is probably sought before new policy is finali-
 zed, the Secretariat's main task is to monitor the
 execution of decisions taken by its parent bodies.
 The Secretariat may well be the party's instrument-
 ality for directing and coordinating the party's
 central departments.
 The ranking official on the Secretariat is
 Tang Hsiao-ping.  His four leading associates are
 all Politburo figures--Pang Chen, Li Fu-chun, Li
 Hsieh-Wien and Tan Chen-lin.  Also included are
 Lo Jui-eking, who is Chief of Staff of the armed
 forces and a long-time security expert; Kong Shang,
 an intelligence man; Lu Ning-yi and Hu Chiao-mu,
 propaganda experts; Li Hsieh-fang, industrial
 matters; Liu Lan-too, organizational and control
 matters within the party; Wang Chia-hsiang, who
 was once involved. in liaison with other parties
 but has not been active lately; and, Yang Shang-
 kun, who holds several top administrative posi-
 tions.  Lo Jui-thing, Kang Shang and Lu Ning-yi
 were added to the .Secretariat by the tenth plenum
 of the Central Committee in September 1962.
 The Central Committee itself, nominally 97
 full and 95 alternate members, has functioned under
 Mao as a rubber stamp body, convened to be instructed
 concerning decisions taken by the dominant leaders.
 By the time it meets the needs of the top command
 for expert advice have been met and the line in
 all essentials has been set.  It could, as has
 happened in the Soviet party, emerge as an important
 deliberative body if an issue arose on which the,
 leaders were critically divided.
 An individual's rank within the Central Com-
 mittee is important as his mark of preferment.
 The party's central departments provide the
 staff to prepare position papers on matters coming
 before the policy makers and to oversee, under the
 direction of the Standing Committee and the Secre-
 tariat, the party's day-to-day operations.  The
 men who run these departments are in charge of the
 party's interests in propaganda, police, rural, in-
 dustrial, finance and trade, communications, united
 front, and party organization work as well as liai-
 son with foreign parties.  They make many of the
 daily decisions on how party policies. are to be
 executed within their areas of competence.  They
 are in a sense going through the last and highest
 training course which the party offers its future
 leaders.
 The committees (really sub-committees) under
 the Central Committee are on the same level as the
 departments but differ in that they tend to meet
 irregularly as the occasion or the leaders demand.
 Like other committees, they probably have permanent
 standing bodies.  Included are the Committee for
 Organs Directly Subordinate to the Central Com-
 mittee, the Committee for Central State Organs
 and the Women's Work Committee.
 Two important commissions, the Control Com-
 mission and the Military Affairs Commission, also
 come just under the Central Committee on party
 organization charts.  They are discussed below
 The top levels of the party are nicely layered
 according to age and party seniority.  Virtually
 all of the top leaders went through the crucible
 of the Long March, a 6,0?0-mile hegira in 1934-196
 which transferred the party's base from Kiangsi to

 Mao is almost ?O and most of hip koy advisers are
 over 60. .The new generation will probably be domi-
 nated by another brand of Communist whose forma-
 tive years in the party were in the fight against
 the Japanese.
 After they take over, it is possible that many
 of the old Maoist ways will go.  The new group will
 very likely not have the remarkable measure of cohe-
 siveness of Mao's group.  Most of the new men, in-
 cluding its leading figures, will have made their.
 mark in the party apparatus.  It is possible, how-
 ever, that by the time the new group gets entrenched
 officials who have made their mark in economic,
 scientific or other specialities will begin to
 exert greater influence in high policy making levels.
 The Party and the State
 In Communist China the party's field of direct
 interest and influence extends. into every nook and
 cranny of the government and military establish-
 ment, of every economic or scientific installation,
 of every education institution.  "The party must,.,
 and can, lead a11--the state organs, the armed
 forces, the people's bodies," runs atypical in-
 struction to party workers.
 Party control is brought to bear by-the as-
 signment of trusted party members to positions,
 usually of authority, in all non-party orgaiaiza-
 tions.  Called Pleading members' groups", they
 are assigned by an appropriate party committee.
 The Central Committee determines the make up of
 the Pleading members' groups" in central govern-
 ment offices; provincial committees do the same
 for the provincial governments, county committees
 far the counties.  These "leading members' groups"
 remain under the direction of their assigning com-
 mittees, not under a "leading members' group" in
 a superior non-party organization.
 The party has a number of full-time workers
 who perform no job outside the party, but the
 majority work in government offices, in the mili-
 Lary, in .economic and cultural establishments,
 or in people's organizations.  They remain under
 strict party discipline.  Failure to detect and
 report without delay the slightest shortcoming,
 from the party's point of view, would open them
 to serious charges.
 The pattern of party influence brought to
 bear by party members is repeated at the working
 level.  Every basic level ,installation, be it
 factory, mine, collective faxm, or militarq
 unit, has its own party organization appointed
 by an appropriate party committee.  It is the
 duty of the party organizations to transmi?
 party policy and see to it that the policy is
 understood and implemented completely.  They
 must adapt the policies, as necessary, to local
 conditions.
 The Structure far Staffing Party Organizations
 The Leading Bodies
 The 1956 party constitution declares that.
 the National Party Congress is the 'thighest lead-
 ing body" of the party,  It is elected.  But the
 timing of its election, the number of delegates,
 and the manner in which they are elected are con-
 trolled by the 'tin'' group.          The 'tin's" reserve to
 themselves the right to run members of superior
 party organizations "who need to be elected" in
 local elections.  They also can cancel the elec-
 tion of anyone they. deem "inadequate."  The present
 Eighth Congress was elected in 1956 for a term of
 five years.  It is still in office.  Its opening
 session was attended by just over 1,??0 delegates.
 The party's first congress, in 1921, was attended
 by twelve.
 A party congress provides a forum for the
 airing of party policies, but its most important
 task is to elect a Central Committee to act for
 it when it is not in session.  The importance of
 this provision derives from the infrequency with
 which National Party Congresses are convened.
 The Eighth has met but twice, in 1956 and 1958,
 despite provisions in the party constitution,
 which it adopted, that it meet once a year.  In
 fact, during the six and one-half years it has
 been in office it has met in session for a grand
 total of 32 days.
 The present Central Committee, the eighth,
 came to office in 1956, the result of a carefully
 contrived electoral process designed by 'the party
 center to bring minimal disturbance to the then
 existing hierarchical arrangements.  It was an
 "election with leadership."  The top leaders de-
 cided on the number of candidates who would stand
 for election, named them and arranged the elec-
 toral lists in proper order of precedence.
 All of this took a lot of arranging, and may
 have prompted a leading party figure to warn that
 'too many elections are unnecessary and may handi-
 cap our work."  Tlie party has generally followed
 his advice.
 Theoretically at least, ultimate authority
 for the disposition of important personnel matters
 rests in the Central Committee.  The 1956 party
 constitution spells this nut:  the Central Com-
 mittee, it states, "takes-charge of and allocates
 party cadres,"  (The term cadre, in Chinese kanpu,
 is applied by the Chinese Communists to offici~ al-s
 and functionaries in both the party and the govern-
 ment and is used in either an individual or a group
 sense.)  When the Central Committee is not in ple-
 nary session, its powers and functions, including
 those involving the disposition of cadres, pass to
 the Politburo, its Standing Committee and the Secre-
 tariat, all elected by the Central Committee   The
 Eighth Central Committee has met in plenary session
 ten times for a total of some ?5 days s'lnce 1956.
 In practice, therefore, its authority over.
 cadre regulation is delegated to its continuing
 bodies.  The highest authority in personnel, as
 in all other matters, doubtless rests with Sao
 Tse-tung.  It is likely that Mao s:ti11 takes an
 active interest in assignments to key positions,
 since any other course could carry grave dangers
 for him.  A number of lesser personnel actions
 may ultimately be referred to him for decision.
 There is bound, for example, to be serious competi-
 tian among various departments of China's national
 security  setup for skilled manpower and managerial
 talent, which axe among the nation's scarcest re-
 sources.
 He is very likely assisted in his delibera-
 tions on these matters by his four active assist-
 ants on the Standing Committee with Liu Shao-chi.
 and Teng Hsiao-ping representing the party's in-
 terests, Chou En-tai the government's and Lin Piao
 those of the military establishment.  Communist
 China is not known to have a system, as do the
 Soviets, which specifies just which non-party
 jobs require the stamp of approval of what party
 body.  The Chinese system is in general highly
 centralized, and the Standing Committee may well
 require that it pass on all recommendations for
 appointments to key jobs in the .party central
 organs, in the government's top bodies, in eco-
 nomic, cultural and scientific enterprises of
 national security significance, in the armed
 forces and in the regions and provinces..  The
 Standing Committee doubtless reserves for itself
 the right to determine just what constitutes a
 "key's assignment requiring its O.K.
 In acting on proposals for filling "key"
 jobs, Mao and the Standing Committee rely heavily
 upon the Secretariat, through which related per-
 sonnel records and data are channeled.  As the
 directing and coordinating agency for the regular
 central organizations of the party, the Secretariat
 can probably approve on its own appointments to a
 range of positions below those on which the Stand-
 ing Committee and Mao act.  In any case, the princi-
 pal figure on the Secretariat, Teng Hsiao-ping, is
 also in Mao's inner circle, a circumstance which
 doubtless gives him vast authority in the personnel
 field.  He is, at a minimum, the needle's eye through
 which a man must pass on his way to a position of
 real authoritye
 Teng's assistants on the Secretariat oversee
 the work of one or another of the party's central
 organs and through them exert considerable influence
 on central government offices.  These assistants
 are very likely responsible for advising Teng and
 the Secretariat on those aspects of a candidate's
 party standing and qualifications which fall within
 the competence of their particular departments.
 They can probably act directly on a certain level
 of position within their own areas.  Most of these
 secretaries have had long experience in party organi-?
 zationa~. work.

 The Central Departments
 Neither the Standing Committee, the Politburo
 nor the Secretariat is sufficiently rich in per-
 sonnel to discharge in detail the constitutional
 charge which devolves an them "to take charge of
 and allocate cadrss.'~  The size of this job is
 suggested by the fact that in 1956, the last year
 for which figures are at hand, there were over
 30,000 party cadres at the county committee level
 a d higher.  The 1963 total is surely higher.  So,
 again, much of the function is delegated to bodies
 which the Central Committee has set up, and staffed,
 to be its executive agents in its "diverse businesses."
 Among these are the Organization Department, the Con-
 trol Commission, the Committee for Party Organs Di-
 rectly Subordinate to the Central Committee, and the
 Committee for Central State Organs.  Other central
 departments play lesser roles.
 The Organization Department, though no longer
 the power it ones was, still plays a strong hand in
 the administration of party cadres.  Prior to 1954,
 it controlled most aspects of party personnel manage-
 went.  It had responsibility for recruitment, train-
 ing, assignment, promotion, transfer of party cadres
 as well as the maintenance of party personnel records.,
 the collection of party dues and the investigation
 of party members'. reliability,  In 1954 the party
 elders discovered that the then chief of the Organi-
 zation Department, Jao Shu-shah, had been attempting
 to use the office to unseat them..  He was removed
 forthwith, and the Organization Department was shorn
 of many of its powers.
 A 1959 study, written by the Research Office
 of the post-Jao Organization Department for the use
 of its cadres, explains the role of the Organization
 Department as that of a "deputy and staff chief" to
 party committees for cadre administration.  The study
 is studded with warnings that the Organization Depart-
 ment ought not "stick its nose into the proper busi-
 ness of others.''  It must, rather, keep to its "own
 share" of-the administration of party cadres and
 party members.
 This share is not inconsiderable.  The study
 explains that the Organization Department remains
 active in the selection., promotion and training of
 patty cadres and in ''developing" party members.
 It still handles the records of party personnel.  It
 probably still has much to do with the placement of
 party men in positions which the higher levels, the
 Secretariat and the Standing Committee, do not keep
 in their own hands.
 The present head of the Organization Department
 is An Tzu-wen, who was a deputy under Jao but defi-
 nitely not his accomplice.  An was once sinister of
 Personnel of the Central .Government, and played a
 large part in the big initial effort to staff the
 new government ~1~5?-1~5~).
 Some of the functions formerly given the Organi-
 zation Department have probably been entrusted to the
 Committee for Party Organs Directly Subordinate to
 the Central Committee.  Little has been said about
 this unit, but its name suggests it was conceived
 to supervise the party's central organs, keep them
 informed on policy matters, and, perhaps, t? assist
 in handling their ordinary staffing needs.  It is
 headed by Yang Shang-kun, who is concurrently Director
 of the Central Committee's General Office and an alter-
 nate secretary of the Secretariat.  Like An Tzu-wen,
 Yang is not a party heavyweight.  He has seemed, ra-
 ther, to be a trustworthy administrative functionary
 who sees to the routine office tasks of the Central
 Committee, handles correspondence and maintains re-
 cords.
 Other of the old Organization Department's func-
 tions probably went to the Committee for Central State
 Organs, which is believed to regulate the work of
 party members who have been placed in jobs with the
 central government.  It is not known how big a-role
 this committee plays zn the assignment, promotion
 or transfer of party members in the government.
 The pattern could possibly be an advisory role for
 higher positions, a more assertive xole for lower
 ones.  The committee is headed by Kung Tzu-Jung,
 who is concurrently an alternate member of the Con-
 trol Commission, Yang's deputy in the General Office
 and a Deputy Secretary General of the State Council.
 A principal element of Jao 's power in the old
 Organization Department, that of investigating the
 loyalty of party members, has passed entirely to the
 Control Commission.  The 1945 party constitution
 had provided for the establishment of both central
 and 1oca1 control commissions, but prior to 1955 they
 were never set up.  In their stead, a system of
 discipline inspection teams was established.  They
 were empowered to dual with specific breaches of
 party discipline only after they had occurred.
 The inadequacy of these arrangements was clearly
 exposed by the case  C-f  I~ar,~ Kang and Jao Shu--shin,
 two prominent party ~~ig~ares who were expelled from
 the party in 1954 fo:~ t~?ying to split the party
 and usurp supreme pr~wer.  'The party conference
 which expelled the paiz^ also decided to establish
 strong control commiasic~ns, at both the. central
 and local levels.  The new commissions were given
 the power to investigate a party member t~efore a
 breach of discipline took place.  They were cFiarged
 with preventing a recurrence of so serious a case
 as the "anti-party alliance" of Kao Kang and Jao
 Shu-shin.  Unlike the earlier discipline inspection
 teams, the new commissions were specifically em-
 powered by the conference to check up on party
 organizations, though discipline was to be meted
 out on an individual basis.
 Working under the direction of party committees
 at the same level, contral commissions take disci-
 plinary action against party members and review
 sentences meted out by lower levels,  They do not
 concern themselves with the minor day-to-day de~
 relictions still handled by the Organization De-
 partment.  They are interested in major discipli-
 nary problems like anti-Maoist plotting, and are
 obviously immensely. important in the party security
 setup.  Their influence on cadre selection is
 likely to be large negative,  A-party member
 coming under their purview is not a good candi-~
 date for further advancement.
 The central Control Commission is an elite
 group.  It is set somewhat apart from other of the
 party's central departments and committees in that
 its leading personnel are elected.  The Commission
 was "strengthened}} by the election of additional,
 but unnamed, new members at the tenth plenum of
 the Central Committee, September 1962.  It has a
 priority claim on personnel and its staff apparatus
 appears to be one of the best developed of any
 central party organ.  It has been headed since
 its inception by Tung Pi-wu, the only original
 founder of the Chinese Communist Party outside
 of Mao Tse-tong still active.  An aged though
 not inconsiderable figure, Tung is ranked seventh
 in the Central Committee and is the first Vice
 Chairman of the Government.  Among Tong's princi-
 pal deputies is Liu Lan-tao, who combines a posi-
 tion on the commission with being a member of the
 powerful Secretariat.  Another is a high ranking
 officer in the General Political Department of
 the-Army, the office charged with the political
 indoctrination of .the army.  A third was until
 1960 Minister of Interior (previously Minister
 of Supervision).  The three would seem to be the
 principal figures in overseeing the conduct of
 members working respectively, in the party, the
 military establishment and the government.
 ?ther central organs which play a role in
 personnel management include-the Propaganda De-
 partment, which handles the education and indoc-
 trination of party members.  This is. an immense
 job on which the Chinese party lavishes time,
 money and effort.  The Propaganda Department is
 headed by Lu Ting-yi, who is also a member of
 the Secretariat.  The Social Affairs Department
 plays a shadowy and unexplained role in the
 never-ending job of policing the party.  Li Ko-
 nung was the head of this organ until his death
 in 1961.  It may have declined in importance
 since his death.
 The Women's Work Committee keeps an eye on
 the interests of female party members.  Roughly
 10 percent of party members are women, although
 the percentage drops sharply as you move up in
 the hierarchy.  There are, for example, only
 four women on the Central Committee.  The ranking
 female comrade, Tsai Chang (Mrs. Li Fu-Chun), is
 also head of the Women's Work Committee.  The
 committee works to overcome 'discrimination" a-
 gainst women cadres and see that they get the
 same opportunities for advancement as male cadres.
 "Some organizations," Tsai Chang once complained,
 "tend to promote more men than women even when
 choosing between persons of equal competence."
 The United Front Department takes charge of the-
 party's relations with cooperating organizations
 and nationalities groups.  It probably has some.
 say in the selection of individuals from such
 organizations for various posts.
 Regional, Provincial and County Posts
 The constitution permits tie Central Com-
 mittee of the party, as it deems necessary, to
 establish bureaus covering several provinces.
 Such regional bureaus existed betwsen 1949 and
 1954.  They were abolished after the Kao-Jao
 incident and were not revived until January 1961,
 when the need for a more aaordinated regional at-
 tack on some of the party's problems impressed it-
 self upon the leaders.  The parallel government
 and military bodies which existed in the 1949-1954
 period have not reappeared, at least publicly.  To-
 day there are six regional bureaus of the Central
 Committee--the Northeast., North, East, Central-
 South, Southwest, and Northwest.  Peiping has been
 uncommonly sparing of detail concerning their re-
 sponsibilities and make-up.  The-post-1961 versions
 appear to range across roughly the same spectrum
 of interests as party.. committees at other levels.
 Each of them apparently has the authority to create
 such subordinate organizations as it feels are
 needed.  Their staffing patterns seem still to be
 in the developmental stage, though many of them
 have begun to staff the usual run of subordinate
 departments for propaganda, rural work, finance
 and the like.  No regional organization departments
 or control commissions have yet been identified.
 The leading personnel of the regional bureaus
 are selected directly by the party center.  The in-
 dividuals named are probably then allowed to fill
 out their own staffs.   The present regional bosses
 are senior party officials, drawn some from Peiping
 and some from the provinces.  The Northeast Bureau
 is headed by Sung Jen-chiung, who was in charge of
 an important central government ministry.  The East
 China and Southwest Bureaus, on the other hand, are
 headed by individuals drawn from the Shanghai munci--
 pal and Szechwan provincial party apparatus, respec-
 tively.  Both are Politburo members.
 These bureaus probably do have certain personnel
 powers and. functions.  They assist the party center
 in assessing job performance of provincial leaders.
 Since responsibilities at the regions are broader
 - lg -
 x~!
 than in flee provinces, the regia~nal posts may be a
 proving grounds for higher posts witki the party
 center.
 The staffing pattern at the provincial level
 is a virtual carbon copy of that in Peiping.  Auto-
 nomous regions and cities directly under central.
 authority (.like Shanghai) are treated as provinces.
 A provincial congress is elected, and elects in
 turn a provincial committee to act for the congress
 when it is not in session.  The provincial committee
 elects a standing committee to act in its stead
 when it is not in session as well as a secretariat
 to handle its "daily work."
 These provincial posts are ir~~portant--10 of the
 21 Chinese provinces have populations of between 20
 and 60 million--and the party center takes no chances..
 It wrote into the constitution that the Number of
 members of a provincial committee will be set by the
 Central Committee and that the members of a provin-
 cial standing committee and secretariat must be
 approved by the Central Committee..  So must party
 committee members in key industrial cities and cities
 with a population of over 500,000 (of which China
 has some 35).
 Like its counterpart in Peiping, the provincial
 committee has the constitutional authority ''to take
 charge of and allocate party cadres", but the Cen-
 tral Committee establishes the controlling regu~.a-
 tions.  In practice, effective provincial responsi-
 bility over cadres is most likely exercised by the
 standing committee (for the higher provincial jobs)
 and by the provincial departments (for lesser posts),
 Provincial Committees are empowered to set up
 their own departments.  Most of them have an organi-
 zation department, the duties of which are determined
 by the provincial committees.  Provincial organiza-
 tion departments are involved, when .local conditions
 and their instructions permit, in the assignment and
 promotion of cadres coming under provincial control.
 Provincial departments are under the authority of the
 pravincial party committee, not under the corresponding
 department at the party center.  The latter has_o_raly
 what Peiping terms a "guidance relationship" with
 its provincial counterparts.

 Party Personnel Administration
 The. party constitution says that membership in
 the party is open to any Chinese, age l~ and over,
 who works and does not exploit the labor of others.
 The entrance process can be initiated by the individ-
 ual or by the party,  He must be sponsored by two
 full members.  In either case, the individual in-
 volved must fill out a detailed application.  The
 most important entries involve his family and
 personal background, communist works he has been
 influenced by, a personal evaluation of his good
 and bad points, and a statement as to why he wishes
 to join the party.  He must be approved by a general
 membership meeting of a party branch.  After being
 accepted by the branch meeting, the application is
 forwarded to the next higher committee for review.
 This committee assigns a functionary to examine
 carefully the candidate's anplicatior~ form and
 to interview liim in detail.-
 After approval by the committee, the appli-
 cant becomes a probationary member of the party.
 He stays in this status for one year, during which
 he is subjected to an "elementary party education"
 and to the close observation of the party branch,
 When the test year is over, his. case again comes
 before the branch meeting.  His party age is com-
 puted from the day he is accepted by the branch
 as a full member, though he must still go through
 the formality of being approved by the next higher
 committee.  At any point in this process a strong
 objection by any one involved can kill the appli-
 cant's chances.
 Admission into the Chinese Communist Party is
 achieved more easily ~;n the periods when the party
 runs drives to add new members; for example, there
 was a big upswing in admissions durin~? the commune
 and "leap forward" movements in 1953-1959,  These.
 are followed by periods of consolidation when
 .entrance requirements are more strenuously applied.
 Since 1956 there no longer have been different
 procedures prescribed for applicants of different
 class backgrounds.  But it is, nevertheless, rela-
 tively easy for a Chinese with a "clean" class
 background--parents who were workers or peasants--
 to get into the party.  Such an individual would be
 more likely be asked to apply, and he might even
 find his probationary period shortenedo  0n the
 other hand,, it is not unknown for an applicant
 with an "unclean" background to be met with delay-
 ing tactics which might last several years.  In-
 deed a bad background-~a~ parent who was in the
 Kuomintang, for example--could in practice preclude
 admission.
 Members in good standing of the Youth League,
 a sort of junior party organization, are accepted
 almost automatically.- Another rich source of
 party material is in the ranks of the non-party
 "activist.'  This is one of the very best ways for
 an outsider to come to the favorable notice of
 a local party boss.  An "activist" serves the
 party by leading the less active masses at study
 meetings and during production drives,
 The qualities which the party wants in its
 members include an u~-questioning zeal, a strong
 measure of asceticatsm, and a dash, no mor?, of
 individuality.  The-party wants a man who .will
 place the interests of the party above his own,
 a man with no aims or ambitions, indeed no life,
 outside the party.  He must demonstrate instan-
 taneous abedienee to party discipline.  It is
 his "h0ly,dutyt' to carry out party policy without
 reservation even if he disagrees with it, though
 at the same time he is eApeeted to~be skilled in
 adapting the policy to local peculiarities.  He
 must in all things be an exemplar to the masses,
 while sharing their 'gobs and sorrows, their hard
 and frugal life.'t  He should display leadership
 potential.`
 Of course not all Chinese Communist Party
 members measure up to these high-flown standards.
 What_the party gets in practice is considerably
 more limited, especially at the basic levels.
 Here the party is apt to settle for obedience and
 political reliabilitg.
 Appraisal and Promotion
 The basic party organisation, the branch,
 makes periodic appraisals of each of its members.
 The appraisal process begins with the individual's
 own analysis of himself.  This is then discussed
 by his branch colleagues who have been observing
 him and forming views as to his suitability.  The
 "self-criticisms and .criticisms" thus collected
 are supplemented by regular personal. interviews
 between the individual member and one of his party
 betters.  Another higher official may collate and
 sum up all of this material.  Branch appraisals
 are supposed to take into account the member's per-
 sonal history and work. record, his merits and de-
 merits, his capabilities and limitations.  They
 become a part of a member's permanent party re-
 cord.
 Over a period of time these appraisals enable
 the party apparatus to make judgments of a member's
 particular worth and identify those who are ready
 to be moved to positions of higher responsibility.
 Although there have been hints that a sort of rough
 grading system does exist within the party, it is
 not apparently as firm and well-developed a system
 as exists in the Chinese government and military.
 An individual's rank in the party seems largely to
 be determined by the level of the apparatus at
 which he works and his duties at that level.  There
 are references, for example, to party secretaries
 at the county level which suggest that the party
 regards this as equivalent to a grade designation.
 According to party instructions, the selection
 of cadres for promotion and transfer should proceed
 on the basis of a systematic plan and on a "unified''
 --that is, controlled by the higher levels--basis.
 The entire history and work of the member being con-
 sidered for reassignment is to be taken into account.
 His party record, likely to be a voluminous file
 for any but the. newest recruit, will be studied,
 and the opinions of his superiors, his equals and
 his subordinates sought.  He may be brought in for
 a personal interview by a ranking member of the
 office for which he is being considered.  Even if
 he is not selected, the party argues that this sort
 of screening is good.  The individual gains a better
 understanding of his strengths and weaknesses, while
 - ~~  -
 the party is enabled to place hi.r:~ in his proper
 spot.
 ''i?~ our fundamental evaluations of a member's
 work,! Mao has said,"we must establish whether his
 achievements amount to 30 percent and his mistakes.
 to 70 percent, or vice versa,  If his achievements
 amount to 70 percent, then his work should in the
 main be approved.?? P~Iost of the criteria advocated
 by the party to guide the selection process axe,
 however, highly subjective (e.g., a high degree of
 communist conciousness) and leave the selectors with-
 out much meaningful guidance.  Hence, much to the
 party's professed  anngnance:,~ great emphasis i.s put
 in practice on seniority anti personal relationships.
 ~`, former party member has recalled that the prime
 requirement for most any post was to have served a
 certain length of time in~.the party.  The more re-
 sponsible the post, the longer the period.  Others
 have testified that the prejudices of the higher
 cadres constituted a most important factor.
 Party writings make it very clear that the
 leaders want advancement. based an Dther criteria.
 Guidelines from the ?rganization Department to
 party workers involved in the assignment and promo-
 tion process stipulate that they should resolutely
 avoid the practice of assigning and promoting solely
 on the basis of seniority,  Teng Hsiao-pizxg has called
 this reliance the most serious defect in the party's
 cadre policy.
 The party says it wants advancement to be based
 both on the member's i4virtue,'f meaning his ideologi-
 cal reliability.,  and ''ability,'t me~x-zxnrg ,his tech--:-
 nical qualifications.  As the party's role has
 broadened over the years, and especially since it
 took over the Chinese mainland,. the emphasis put
 on the second part of the equation lzas increased.
 t'l recent party work, for example, declared that pre-
 ferment in the Party will increasingly depend on
 how well the member improves his technical skill.-
 Fut the party has not, and probably never wi11, per-
 mit the latter to outweigh the former.
 Party education
 Great emphasis :3,s placed by the ~pa~ty  leaders
 on their "education" programs.  Indeed, a cadre's
 attitude toward and aptitude for study will be duly
 ~3 ~'
 entered on his appraisal forms.  '~To be lazy about
 study shows a defective sense of responsibility
 toward the party,*' runs a party injunction, which
 adds that all cadres, old and new, in leading posi-
 tions or on the lower levels, must study.
 Indeed, the need is deep.  The Chinese party
 is the largest in the world.  The general educational
 level of its members~.is low.  At its. lower levels,.
 literacy is limited.  And the problem is c?mplicated
 by the fact that members with compaxatively good edu-
 cational backgrounds are not truscted as fully as the
 "good-hearted" elements with a sound class background
 but a poor education.
 Cadre training programs are basically of two
 kinds, ideological and technical.  The aim is to
 educate the loyal and convert the educated.  The
 ideological part is the better developed.  It is
 constant, pervasive, repetitious, in all party
 organs, in schools, in offices, in the armed
 forces.  Wherever a party man goes, no matter
 how "virtuous" he may be, he will be assigned to
 a study group.  He will be required to attend its
 regular study meetings, which may average two a
 week, to discuss approvingly the latest twists
 and turns of the party line.
 These meetings are, from time to time as the
 party center directs, supplemented by special study.
 sessions of several weeks' duration.  One such series
 was conducted in the oarly part. of 1962 on-the duties
 and rights of party members.  Members are, of course,
 believers when they .join and these never-ending doses
 of indoctrination are intended to prevent backslid-
 ing.
 The first training offered a party member out-
 side the scope of his own study group is very likely
 to be at a short course run by one of the basic level
 organs.  Members are rotated thru such schools for
 one, two or three months of instruction in the basic
 tenets of communism.  He probably will attend such
 courses a number of times during his service at
 lower levels.  Lecturers may be leading cadres of
 the unit giving the course, or they may be individ-
 uals whose only duty is to pr?vide this instruction.
 At the county level, these courses are apt La-
 be given at a regular institution maintained by the
 county committee.  Mere leading cadres of the county
 party organization receive refresher courses and
 cadres earmarked for such positions receive a more
 sophisticated version of the instruction at lower
 levels.  For the party is convinced that, the higher
 a cadre rises, the broader his understanding of com-
 munism needs be.
 So his ideologidal education goes on, conceiv-
 ably right up to his being .selected, if his future
 .placement requires it, for a course of study at one
 of the institutions run by the party's Central Com-
 mittee, the Higher Party School or the Central Re-
 search institute.  These train high theoretical
 cadres or give them an opportunity for research in
 the field.  They may-also give more generalized
 courses for cadres destined for service in key posts
 with departments of the Central Committee.-
 The .Central Committee's Propaganda Department
 plays a big role in all of this ideological train-
 ing.  It prov?_des the study materials, from basic
 texts by Marx, Engels, Lenin, to collections of
 Mao's works and the rel~~~rant  party documents.     Tt
 is in direct control of the key party publications,
 the newspaper People's Daily and the magazine Red
 Flag.  It may help by providing guidance on party
 scfooling to the lower levels.
 However pressing the need for all of this ide-
 ological training, the party. also recognizes that
 party members must be given the opportunity to at-
 tain a measure of expertness. in the work to which
 they are assigned.  In order fully to deserve the
 trust placed in them, the party says, members must
 have more than a talent to "chatter away on politi-
 cal subjects."  If a cadre is assigned to work with
 the peasants, he is expected to study farm tech-
 nique; if sent to an economic installation, he is
 expected to learn something of its processes; if
 sent to oversee scientific research, he is expected
 to sop up some scientific knowledge,.
 In order to do this, he may be entered in a
 regular educational institution such as a middle
 school, university, or a technical, trade or voca-
 tional institute, either as a full or part time
 student.  One of the wide variety of short courses,
 offering highly specialized and concentrated instruc-
 tion in a narrow circulum, may be the party's choice
 far him.  He may be left to learn as much as he can
 on the job by picking the brains of the experts work-
 ing there.  He may merely be strongly urged to attend
 spare-time classes ar devote himself to off-duty study.
 Opportunities for technical training in today's China
 are limited, but whatever is available is at the party's
 beck and call.
 As an individual moves up in the party, he is
 expected to~broaden out,  He will be assigned dif-
 ferent duties, in accordance with the party needs,
 and will probably receive re hated training?  And he
 may in time become one of the party's cherished"ver-
 satile hands;':' a trusted party man with a variety of
 posts in his background who is ready .for bigger things.
 Party Incentives
 The primary attraction of party membership is
 probably the fact that the party runs things.  This
 cannot escape the notice of anyone in China.  Party
 membership opens doors to positions in government.,
 in the military, in universities, in fact every-
 where.  The highest, or at least the most powerful,
 positions are invariably occupied by party figures.
 A young Chinese who wishes to get ahead will doubt-
 less regard party membership as the indispensible
 key and work for the-day of his admission.  The
 party leadership regards this as a base motive for
 joining.
 Promotion is probably-the main material in-
 centive offered the. party men.  There are undeniable
 perquisites that go with party office.  The higher
 the office, the greater the perquisites.  ~'Jhile direct
 wages are pegged to equivalent non-party levels, ad-
 vantages in housing, medical care, and recreational
 facilities accrue to party officials.  They are also
 apt to get a break on scarce items like meat, sugar,
 vegetable oil, cloth and cigarettes  It would be
 risky business for a restaurant to fail to pay spe-
 cial attention to a party boss.
 But the road to the perquisites of this type
 is a long and arduous one.  On the way up, he will
 have to be sustained largely by less :taaterial in-
 centives, like the comfort of being one of an ac-
 knowledged elite which Maas a mission of doing some-
 thing about building China.  Beyond this psychologica l
 _ 26
 3.3
 balm, there is the practical authority which his
 membership confers on Iiim.  'I~here is always some
 individual, same group, fnr tlxe party man to "lead.''
 If considerations of personal advantage over
 the long pull are not sufficient to keep .the party
 man. bent to the party's will, there is tl~e constant
 threat of prolonged sessions of criticism and self-
 criticism.  These ~reducational" sessions can be
 long and unbelievably tedious.  It is, according
 to many who have gone tY-gru such sessions, most diffi-
 cult to withstand these partly mental, partly physical,.
 onslaughts.. If an individual does resist, the party
 can move on to disciplinary action.  Punishments are:
 1) warning, 2} serious warning, 3) removal from party
 posts, 4) retention for observation within the party,
 and 5) expulsion from .the party.
 There is also the possibility of being sent down
 to a production unit, usually a farm, for a period of
 labor reform.  In fact, the party regards this as such
 a good scheme that a cadre, even a leading cadre, can
 find himself assigned to one of these periods of "pro-
 letarianization" without his having done a thing wrong.
 Other threats, of course, Bang over the party
 member.  IIe can be turned over to the state super-
 visory apparatus, which can, if the offense is
 serious enough, mete out more extreme forms of pun-
 ishment.
 The dangers of running afoul of the control
 apparatus are particularly great when the party
 center is running one of its periodic campaign to
 T~rectify~~ party members.  Then they can conceivably
 be charged with any one of a variety of vague, ill-
 defined sins.  They must beware and re-double their
 efforts to satisfy their party betters.  The utility
 of this sort of negative incentive should not be
 underestimated.

 III.   STAFFING THE GOVERNMENT
 The Chinese Communists conceive of the Govern-
 ment of the People's Republic of China as the execu-
 tive instrumentality for carrying ?ut policies de-
 cided by the party.  The task they give the govern-
 ment is to help formulate and then execute plans
 for the implementation of the party's general line.
 This is a huge job since the government has to regu-
 late not only such normal. national security functions
 as defense, diplomacy and peace and order, but also
 a wide range of activities taken over by the commun-
 ists, from industrial production to domestic and
 foreign trade, sports and even radio broadcasting..
 As a result, China's bureaucratic apparatus, is
 immense.
 The party organization remains separate and
 distinct from that of the government.  The party
 as an organization stays clear of actual govern-
 mental administration.  Party members are, however,
 spotted
 all
 through the government, from top to
 bottom.
 It
 is through their efforts that, in the
 words of
 a
 veteran communist, "the administrative
 agencies
 of
 the government are made to accept
 policies
 of
 the party and turn them into policies
 of the government,"
 Staffing Requirements for Senior Posts
 The nominal number-one job in the government,
 the Chairman of the Republic, is largely a procedural
 and ceremonial post.  The Chairman is the formal
 chief of state.  He has no direct control, by virtue
 of his government position, over the State Council
 or the ministries, which together handle the real
 administrative chores of the governments  However,
 in Communist China, the chief of state has in fact
 been a figure of commanding importance by virtue of
 his party position. ,The first Chairman of the Re-
 public, Mao Tse-tung, resigned in 1959 and was suc-
 ceeded by Liu Shao-chi.
 The chief executive is the premier, the princi-
 pal officer of the State Council.  The post is held
 by Chou En-lai.  The State Council includes 16 vice
 premiers (one of whom, Peng Teh-huai, is in disfavor
 and inactive}, and some 34 ministers and heads of
 commissions plus a secretary general.  This group-has
 such authority as is given-the government to make
 high-level decisions necessary for carrying out
 national security policies.  The premier and 12
 of the 16 vice premiers are members of the Polit-
 buro; the other four are high ranking Central Com-
 mittee members,
 Broad functional control under the State Coun-
 cil is exercised by its six staff offices.  These
 operate as more or less permanent coordinating com-
 mittees, with a varying number of related ministries
 under their purview.  They are the governnment coun-
 terparts of the party's central .departments.  Be-
 sides these staff  offices, the State Council's
 Secretariat and the premier's office provide general
 coordinative functions.  The 3ecretara,at serves as
 the official, link.-.between the council and provin-
 cial and local administrations.  The premier's of-
 fice contains his personal staff performing such
 functions as he directs.
 What does the party center look for iri the
 men it assigns to jobs on the State Council?  Mao
 Tse-tong and his confederates are doubtless look-
 ing for individuals who;  1) have a long and spot-
 less party history; 2) have a demonstrated aa~n-
 petenee in the administration of complex problems
 and large numbers of people; and 3) have some ac-
 quaintance and experience-with the specific affairs
 of  the office.
 The degree to which the first qualification
 predominates is illustrated by the fact that ?5
 percent of the State Council membership is made up
 of party men.  These are, for the most part, mem-
 bers of the party's Central Committee and are thus,
 in the party's judgment, its best career officers
 and administrators.  Membership on the Central Com-
 mittee identifies a man who has spent virtually all
 his adult life in the management of increasingly im-
 portant affairs.  Since 1949 this experience has,
 for. some of the them, included nationwide responsibili-
 ties in certain fields.
 Non-communists have been appointed to head
 ministries in the central government, but never to
 those involving national security functions.  Non-
 communists head ministries which handle things like
 water conservancy and postal services.  Even. then,
 ~l
 the non-communist minister .will inevitably have a
 first vice minister who is a reliable party man and
 acts as a minister in everything but name.  Some
 ministries, such as the ministries of foreign af-
 fairs,, public security, and defense do not use non-
 party members in any but the most menial positions.
 Party members predominate even at the second
 level.  Over 80 percent of the 300 vice ministers
 and vice chairman of commissions are party men.
 Party membership for the bureaucracy as a whole is
 more difficult to determine.  An Tzu-wen reported
 that in 1956 one-third of the total number of cadres
 working at the county. level or above were e~.ther
 party or youth league members.  It may be that the
 proportion of party to non-party cadres cited by
 An could apply to the bureaucracy as a whole:  the
 same proportion has been. noted in the USSR.
 It might be noted that party membership accounts
 for only 4 percent of the general population of over
 15 years of age.  The concentration of party members
 grows steadily heavier as you move up in the govern-
 mental machinery until it reaches 100 percent at
 the level of the vice premier and above.
 Structure for Staffing Government Offices
 The 1954 constitution of the Chinese People's
 Republic declares that the National People's Congress
 is the "highest organ of state power."  Its .more
 than 1200 deputies are elected.  Sessions of the
 congress have been short, less frequent than called
 for in the constitution, and confined to rubber-
 stamping actions taken elsewhere. The congress
 elects the Chairman of the People's. Republic of
 China as well as a Standing Committee to be its
 "permanent working organ" when it is not in session.
 The present Standing Committee has some 00 members.
 The chairman formally appoints the premier,
 subject to the approval of the National People's
 Congress.  He appoints,. on the recommendation of
 the premier, the other members of the State-Couneil
 --the vice premiers, ministers, heads of commissions
 and the secretary general.  After the premier's
 nominati,+ans  have been ''decided*? by a  congress  (or
 its Standing Committee), they are formally appointed
 ~3 ~'
 to their jobs by the chairman.  The provisions for
 congressional approval are no more than window-
 dressing for decisions made at the party center.
 The chairman appoints in addition a number of
 other ranking officials in national security .jobs,
 such as the Chief of the General. Staff, the directors
 of the main departments in the Ministry of National
 Defense, the president and vice presidents of the
 Academy of Sciences.  While 'the standing committee
 is empowered to appoint and remove ambassadors and
 heads of mission abroad, the chairman dispatches and
 recalls these plenipotentiary representatives.  Al-
 though these appointments are the responsibility of
 the chairman, they are likely made upon the recom-
 mendation of the premier.  The total number of top
 posts requiring the nomination and appointment of
 the chairman and premier probably numbers less than
 100, roughly half of which are jobs controlling
 national security programs.
 Selection of the second echelon of government
 executives is legally the prerogative of the State
 Council.  This second echelon .includes the directors.
 of the important staff officies of the State Council,
 the heads of specialized agencies of the State Coun-
 cil, the deputy ministers and assistant ministers,
 the commission vice chairman and members, as-well
 as all chiefs and ,deputies of the divisions, bureaus,
 and offices which make up the ministries.  In the
 military field, the appointing responsibility of
 the Council extends to commanders and political
 commissars at the division level (more than 300
 positions).  In the foreign field it includes em-
 bassy counselors and consul. generals.  The. State
 Council appoints all key personnel in the important
 financial, commercial, or industrial enterprises
 administered by the 25 economic ministries.  Im-
 portant administrative posts in the field of higher
 education are also controlled by the State Council.
 Altogether the State Council probably controls a
 minimum of 2,000 executive jobs in the government.
 All o~ them require rei'erence to the party before
 being finalized.
 In addition to specific responsibilities for
 appointing administrative personnel, the State Council.
 ~~
 is ultimately responsible for the government's
 staffing policies.  The State Council, for exam-
 ple, as  apart of each long term and annual plan
 makes an allocation of manpower resources accord-
 ing to nationally determined priorities and, in
 effect, programs the development of new skills
 needed in China's industrialization.
 The Secretary General and Secretariat of the
 State Council are key positions in the exercise
 of these council responsibilities.  The Secretary
 General is Hsi Chung-hsun, a high-ranking Central
 Committee member and a vice premier.  Prior to
 moving to Peiping, he had been an important figure
 in party affairs in Northwest China.  He is assisted
 by ten deputies who are all party personalities.
 More than half of them have concurrent responsi-
 bilities in the party personnel machine.  One of
 them, Kung Tzu-Jung, holds the following positions
 in the central departments of the party;  head of
 the Committee for Central State Organs, member of
 the Control Commission, and deputy director of the
 Party Secretariat's Staff Office.  Five of the
 deputies hold concurrent responsibilities in im-
 portant State Council personnel offices.
 The Secretariat has a special Personnel Divi-
 sion which appears to be responsible for enforcing
 personnel procedures, processing personnel actions,
 and maintaining personnel files on the employees
 working directly for the State Council.  In addi-
 tion, Premier Chou's own office assists him in
 making personnel and policy decisions.
 Government personnel administration on lower
 levels is highly fragmented.  The Ministry of Per-
 sonnel, organized in 1950 shortly after the govern-
 ment was first established, had comparatively broad
 responsibilities for government personnel selection
 and assignment at a time when the .new regime was
 busy filling its offices.  It was closely tied with
 the party's Organization Department.  Like the Organi-.
 nation Department, the ministry has been downgraded.
 In 1954 it was reduced to a specialized agency of
 the State Council; and in 1959 it was placed under
 the Ministry of Interal Affairs.  During the period,
 other, more specialized organizations were created by
 the State Council to handle aspects of personnel work,
 such as training, job allocation, or various special-
 ized groups of personnel, such as scientists and tech-
 nicians.
 Today, the General Pers?nnel Bureau of the
 Ministry of Internal Affairs performs the follow-
 ing functions for the government bureaucracy as
 a whole:
 1.  It implements the wage and welfare poli-
 ci?s of the State Council and performs
 other personnel work assigned it by the
 council.
 2.   It drafts personnel regulations and super-
 vises the establishments of tables of organi-
 nation for offices of central government.

 The subordination of the Personnel Bureau to
 the Ministry of .Internal Affairs in 1959 served to
 correlate the Bureau's general responsibility for
 control of the bureaucracy with the Ministry's re-
 sponsibilities for veterans affairs, the mass mobili-
 zation of civilian labor crews for public works pro-
 jects, and the administration of state welfare and
 relief programs..  At the time of the merger, the
 Director of the Personnel Bureau, Chang Yi-pai, was
 made a Vice Minister of the Ministry of Internal
 Affairs.  Chang has been associated with high level
 personnel work since government was set up.
 Specialized Personae l

 technicians--was divorced from the general admini-
 strative system in 1956 and turned over to inde-
 pendent agencies of the State Council, the Special-
 ists Work Bureau and the Foreign Experts Bureau.
 The Specia~.ists we~rk B~~re~au  is today part of
 the Scientific and Techna~logi~~?a~. Commission.     It
 is responsible for the assignment, promotion and
 transfer of ''specialistset--defined by the Chinese
 Communists as scientific workers, engineers, educa-
 tors, doctors, and health technicians, as well as
 important cultural and artistic workers.  The bureau
 may concern itself directly only with persons who
 have actual work experience.  The bureau may also
 have been charged with carrying out a 1956 plan to
 register all scientific and technological personnel,
 and with keeping it up to date.
 Advisory functions of the bureau include:
 1.  To investigate unemployed t'advanced in-
 tellectuals" and place-them in the state
 apparatus.
 2.   To investigate the assignment and working
 conditions of specialists and make recom-
 mendations to the State Council .for improve-
 ment,
 3.   To investigate the implementation of poli-
 Gies and laws governing-the use of special-
 ists, and attempt to solve their. problems.
 and promote their fullest use.
 4.   To work out plans with government depart-
 ments for the employment of students and
 specialists returning to China from non-
 communist counties.
 The second bureau established in 1956 by the.
 State Council to handle special personnel require-
 ments, the Foreign Experts Bureau, was designed speci-
 fically to take-care of bloc experts.  Prior to 1960
 such personnel numbered in the thousands.  The Soviet
 specialists left China over two years ago, but a few
 hundred satellite technicians have remained.  The
 bureau still functions.  It inv?stigates the techni-
 cal and scientific specialization of foreign countries
 ~~
 (both communist and non-communists) in the light of
 China's needs.  It retains responsibility for en-
 gaging foreign specialists, arranging their assign-
 ment in China, providing living accommodations, and,
 writing letters of commendation at the termination
 of their service.
 AnotYzer unit at the State Council level with
 important responsibilities for personnel administra-
 tion is the Bureau for the Administration of Govern-
 ment Offices.  This agency provides living accomo-
 dations and security for top level government cadres,
 which probably includes the 50 officials of the State
 Council and may well include other important. personnel
 in the ministries, c?mmissions, and special agencies.
 Each ministry and commission has limited repon-
 sibilitity fox locating, training, assigning, and pro-
 moting its rank and file.  The ministries carry out
 this responsibility through personnel bureaus, the
 directors of which, like every important administra-
 tive office in a ministry, are appointed by the State
 Council.
 Tlh~e duties of a ministerial personnel bureau
 include the processing of personnel actions, main-
 taining personnel records, arranginv leave and
 changes of assignment.  They provide general ser-
 vices such as briefing newly assigned people and
 arranging for their housing, clothing, and travel..
 In one of the most important national security
 ministries, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, virtu-
 ally all executive positions in Peiping (at Least
 100 and perhaps as many as 200 people) as we11 as
 ~.^esponsible officials in the foreign service (an
 additional 200 positions at a minimum) are admin-
 istered by the State Council.
 The ministry's personnel unit controls appoint-
 ments and assignments to middle- and junior-level
 posts as well as service positions,  The ministry's
 general services departmEnt, rather than its per-
 sonnel unit negotiates with other government agencies

 iers, code clerks, and physical security officers
 according to needs as fixed. by the ministry.
 Government Personnel Administration
 Recruitment and Assignment
 Although the staffing objectives and machinery
 of the US and Communist China contain many similari-
 ties, placement procedures differ significantly.
 In a democratic system, the government must com-
 pete with other employers for an individual's ser-
 vices, and personal preferences play a large part..
 in placement.  In Communist China professional,
 semi-professional, and vocational school graduates
 are given little alternative but to accept service
 in a job assigned by the state.
 Professionals entering the labor force from
 higher educational institutions are assigned posi-
 tions by the institutions on the basis of rosters
 prepared by the ministry which administers the
 institutions:.  The Ministry of Education adminis-
 ters general liberal arts schools, and the Ministry
 of National Defense and economic ministries run
 technical and scientific institutes.
 Students earmarked for jobs. in national secu-
 rity organs generally have had their course of study
 sponsored by a specific organization.  Or they may
 have been hand picked before graduation for a spe-
 cial assignment.  For those not so chosen normal
 placement procedure begins with the posting of a
 roster of positions which the institution is re-
 sponsible for filling on its bulletin board.  Each
 student is permitted to indicate three choices.
 The institution in theory considers the student's
 choice.  In practice, however, the institution is
 guided primarily by other considerations, such as
 the state's needs, the student's class background
 and his scholastic rating.
 Although acceptance of state assignments is
 virtually mandatory, there is little need for com-
 pulsion.  By the time a student graduates from an
 institute of higher education in Communist China,
 he has undergone a long process of~mental preparation
 to put duty above personal considerations.  He will
 probably be either ambitious or sincere enough to
 make personal sacrifices in the interest of further-
 ing his career.. Even if he lacks such motivations,
 a student has no ready alternati~ye,  The following.
 account of a student?s attempt to refuse an assign-
 ment was written by an intellectual who fled China.
 "There was an actual case of
 a medical student who .after gradu-
 ation did not go to the frontier
 area assigned to him but went home
 instead to help his father keep
 shop.  He was free to go home, of
 course:  'no one could force him
 to do anything in a socialist coun-
 try'....  He enjoyed several weeks
 of leisure with his family which
 he could financially well afford,
 but one day two classmates came to
 see him and, after tea and remarks
 on the weather, they explained that
 they thought he .should 'follow the
 leadership' and go to his assigned.
 work.  "In socialist societi~s,~:
 they told him,  'no one skioulcl call
 his shill his own, because without
 the society a man could not be what
 he was.  The Government spent so
 much money on the school we studied
 in.  Therefore,..,' The next day
 two other classmates came to persuade
 him; "In socialist societtes no one
 can call his skill his own...'; the
 third day three others came; "In
 socialist countries no one can call
 his skill his own,..'; the fourth
 day one of the two who came the
 first day came:  'The government
 spent so much on the school we
 studied in ....'  In any society
 there are some people with excep-
 tional temperaments, and the Com-
 munists take care of them.  This
 medical student persisted in shak-
 ing his head; and his classmates
 persisted in coming,  Every after-
 noon he was subjected to a lecture
 which went on for hours:  "In so-
 cialist societies no one can call
 his skill his own....'  At the end
 of two months he came to think that
 this. was worse than any frontier
 region could be, and promised to
 repoi?t to the Committee of Party
 Members in the school.''
 Refusal to accept a job assigned by the state
 amounts to professional sui~i~e, particularly for
 a  young; student ,just starting out.          It results in
 automatic .isolation from an employment system which
 controls all significant job opportunities in the.
 entire country.  Although an individual may eventu-
 ally find some kind oaf empAoym~nt, he has in effect
 placed himself ~a.nd~r governmental "supervision",
 which itself can be a serious matter.  His original
 refusal to accept a state assignment has become a
 permanent part of his personnel record. -Even if
 he relents, as the reluctant medical student did,
 his future assignments, salary, and promotional
 opportunities have been irreparably blighted.
 Offices directly involved in national security
 have the highest priority in personnel recruitment.
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for example, usually
 has first call on students in the social sciences,
 in foreign languages and in area studies.  It takes
 the largest part of the graduating class from the
 country's basic foreign service training school.
 Those selected by the ministry from other institu-
 tions are generally out of the top half of their
 classes.  An assignment to the ministry ''must be
 complied with" and is accompanied by a thorough
 security check,  Almost all professional employees
 are believed to be members of the party or the
 Youth League.  The Ministry also enjoys a high
 priority in filling its personnel needs from other
 agencies.
 The nation's scientific effort also gets
 priority attention in the assignment of better
 students.  This effort is planned and overseen
 by the 30-55 divisions, including divisions for
 atomic energy and national defense, of tt~e Scienti-
 fic and Technological Commission.  Most of the
 actual scientific work is, however, .handled by
 the Academy of Sciences, in specialized academies
 run by individual ministries sand in industry or
 at the universities.  The importance of the
 Academy of Sciences in this effort is indicated
 by the fact that a principal part of the nation's
 research and development in such vital fields as
 nuclear physics and missiles is carried out at
 various institutes of the academy.  The academy
 ensures a supply of qualified personnel by running
 its own training programs in its own schools.  The
 academy doubtless gets the pick of the. students
 trained.

 ~,dT
 Once assigned to a critical job or agency, an
 individual has almost no horizontal mobility--at
 least not on his own initiative.  The system which
 fords him into a niche, keeps him there.  Transfers,
 like assignments, are arranged largely on the basis
 of the state's need and to refuse a transfer initi-
 ated by the state is likely to be detrimental to
 one's career.
 Good performance or personal contacts can bring
 an individual to the attention of another agency with
 a clearly higher priority, and transfers can usually
 be arranged at .the instigation of such an organiza-
 tion.  Poor performance can result in a transfer
 either to less critical agencies or to less important
 responsibilities within the same agency.
 There are also lateral transfers from agencies
 responsible for developing particular skills.  This
 kind of transfer occurs frequently, in the national
 security field, from military to civilian agencies.
 Special police and security offices, for example,
 in the governmental structure are usually staffed
 by military veterans with special training in this
 kind of work.  Qrganizations needing personnel trained
 in secure communications procedures recruit almost
 exclusively from the military.  t?ther specialized
 agencies, such as the Bureau of National Statistics
 and the Ministry of Pablic Security, train special-
 ists on a continuing basis and make them available
 to other government .agencies as normal placement
 procedure.
 Although it is not impossible to arrange one's
 own transfer in Communist China, such transfers are
 not common.  The government does entertain requests
 from individuals for reassignment, though probably
 not from the national security field.  The best
 reason for such a request, from the government's
 point of view, is that the individual's speciality
 is not being used.  Misplacement does occur.  For
 example, at one time a reported lt3 percent of the
 'tadvanced intellectuals' in the employ of one minis-
 try were holding down jobs which did not utilize their
 specialized training.
 Promotional prospects in the governmental ser-
 vice depend on much the same criteria as in~the
 party.  The first concern of the authorities is
 in most cases likely to be political reliability.
 Like his colleagues in the party, the non-party
 professional has to attend regular study meetings.
 Though these are generally neither. as frequent nor
 as intensive as for the party man, the non-party
 professional finds he must also express his opinions
 on the issues under discussion.  This, of course,
 gives big brother in the party a chance to measure
 his political attitude.  Tf it is judged inadequate,
 his other qualifications will have to be outstanding
 before he will have a chance to be recommended for
 promotion.
 Still, professional excellence probably does.
 count for~more here than it does in the case of
 the purely party man.  A man could conceivably ad-
 vance quite high in an economic or scientific in-
 stitution on professional merit.  But he would
 find, ultimately, that he was closed off from the
 top posts unless or until he was accepted into
 the party.
 Veterans' Preference
 Veterans from the armed forces. are employed in
 large numbers at all levels of responsibility in
 the Chinese government.  Military retirement laws
 dating from the mid-1950's provide that all de-
 mobilized military personnel must, if they are
 physically fit and. under 55 years of age, take
 job assignments arranged for them.  These assign-
 ments, like those of civilian professionals are
 virtually compulsory.  High-ranking officers or
 personnel with special qualifications are usually
 assigned jobs before they leave the army.  If an
 individual has no particular skills of use to the
 government or the party he is sent home.  The per-
 sonnel department of the government in his local
 area is responsible for providing him with a job.
 Some sort of employment is arranged, from a com-
 fortable spot in an~.academic institution to dif-
 ficult manual labor in factories or on farms.
 Ex-soldiers also rEeeive special salary con-
 siderations.  Their military rank is converted to
 a roughly equal civilian grade.  The actual salary
 paid a veteran is determined by a combination of
 this grade and his length of military service.  A
 veteran can thus draw a higher salary than a non-
 veteran in the same job.  One other factor contri-
 butes to veteran's preference in Communist China.
 The armed forces political indoctrination program
 is one of the regime's most effective.  It tends
 to make veterans, many of whom are party members,
 especially reliable.  Veterans are therefore likely
 to be considered for responsible positions ahead of
 non-veterans.
 In-service Training
 Many of the ministries and commissions of the
 Chinese government run in-service training courses
 for their personnel, usually at specialized institu-
 tions in which they have an interest.  One such
 institution is the Chinese Institute for Interne-
 tional Relations in Peiping.  Financed by the Mi~is-
 try of Foreign Affairs ahd the Ministry of Education,
 it is under the operational control of the party.
 It provides training in international affairs,.for~gn
 languages and area studies.  Selection for study at
 the institute is considered a maxk of disti~tbn
 and the herald of higher positions to come.
 Most of the Institute's 600 students are drawn
 from party cadres of the low and middle levels,
 foreign service officers who have alrea~~~ had a
 tour abroad or employees of the ministry, and em-
 ployees of other government and military offices--
 all of whom receive their salary while attending
 the school.  It does accept some highly qualified
 middle school graduates.  Entrance requirements
 read like the requirements for party membership--
 political reliability, a family background untainted
 by wealth or political ties with the Kuomintang,
 and no foreign connections.
 The curriculum of the Institute is organized
 around a two- to three-year program for foreign
 ministry officers who have already served abroad,-
 and a four-~to five-year program for training langu-
 age and area specialists.  It is based on the study
 .program of the institute's Soviet counterpart.  Stud-
 ies include basic academic courses (geography, history,
 law), political theory courses (Marxism-Leninism, the
 history of the Chinese revolutions, dialectical ma-
 terialism), foreign affairs (history of international

 politics and economic relations, international
 public and private law, the history of Chinese
 diplomacy), and foreign languages. (English, French,
 Russian, German, Spanish, and Arabic).  The major
 emphasis of the institute is ?n political theory..
 The major language effort is on English.
 The promotional possibilities for professionals
 in Communist China range from an entering grade 21
 for a college graduate to an effective. ceiling at
 about grade ll.  A handful of top executives hold
 the ten super grades.  The wage differential between
 grade 11 and grade Z1 in Communist China is about
 the same as exists in the US civil service system
 between the professional entering grade, GS-S, and
 the top regular grade, GS-l5,  Wage levels for pro-
 fessionals in the. government have been generally
 stable and promotions slow.  The government wage
 structure was last overhauled in 1956.
 A government professional gets certain per-
 quisites which determine his actual standard of
 living.  Emoluments in housing, food, and cloth-
 ing allowances are allowed high level officials.
 Lesser officials in certain kids of work, such as
 personnel whose jobs bring them into frequent con-
 tact with foreigners receive better living allowances
 than the average employee of the same grade.  Wel-
 fare benefits in the form of medical services and
 schools for dependents also are linked to profes-
 sional status and grade.
 Housing is at a premium in China.  The higher
 one's grade the better the chance of being able to
 live with one's family, to obtain attractive accom-
 modations, privacy, and enough equipment for rela-
 tive comfort.  For the many government employees
 whose jobs do not permit them to live with their
 families, the regime has a leave system which al-
 lows an individual to spend two to three. weeks a .
 year, or four to five weeks every two years with
 his family.
 On top of this., persons employed by organi2a-
 tions responsible for national security reportedly
 receive special attention in the allocation of daily
 necessities.  The armed forces receive excellent
 treatment in comparison with the population at
 large, and the relatively high standard of living of
 employees of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs compared
 to other government functionaries has been noted by
 visitors to Peiping.
 The Chinese Communist regime employs to advan-
 tage certain n?n-material incentives.  It offers,
 for example, idealistic young people a chance to
 participate in the vital and challenging job of
 modernizing China.  This factor is known to have
 played a large part in the return of hundreds of
 educated Chinese from the US' and Europe in the
 early 1950's:  It is a factor heavily emphasized
 in university-level indoctrination programs.
 A second non-material incentive is access to
 literature that has not been pre-masticated .by the
 regime's propaganda apparatus.
 The government's awards system seems designed
 more to promote loyalty to the regime. than improve-
 ments in efficiency and performance.  This system
 now in use provides. for the granting of.commenda-
 tions, prizes, cash, grade raises and .promotions on
 the following grounds:  1) loyalty to the job; 2)
 superior or model performance. of duties; 3) ob-
 servance of discipline; 4) suggestions, innovations,
 and inventions which contribute to the national wel-
 fare; 5) actions protecting government-property or
 preventing loss to the government; and 6) fighting
 illegal activity.  Four out of the six are reflec-
 tions of political reliability rather than Outstand-
 ing professional achievement.
 There are also regulations on the books which
 are specifically designed to reward outstanding pro-
 fessional achievement.  Under these, original con-
 tributions in both natural and social science are
 afforded national recognition and cash awards.  The
 only publicized use of these awards occurred nearly
 six years ago.
 Of course, there is the other side of the in-
 centive coin.  The government civil servant can
 fall afoul of the government's supervisory ap-
 paratus quite as easily as a party man can be en-
 meshed in his, and for equally capricious reasons.
 There is no legal code in Communist China.  There
 is a system of courts in China, but the courts are
 not independent; they are only another arm of the
 executive.  There is also a system of public prose-
 cutors, whose chief task it is to cheek on govern-
 ment offices and employees to see that state regu-
 lations are observed by all administrative agencies,
 officials and the public at large,
 The major responsibility for maintaining public
 order and policing the governmental apparatus, how-
 ever, rests in the Ministry of Interior and the
 Ministry of public Security.  Interior is belie ved
 to take care~of administrative cases involving govern-
 ment agencies and officials, to investigate how govern-
 ment decisions are being implemented, and to detect
 neglect of duty or violations of regulations.  The
 Ministry of Public Security performs the general
 police function vis-a-vis the public,  It has the
 largest and best trained investigative force, which
 is apparently used from time to time by other super-
 visory organs of party and government.  These organs,
 primed to act at the whim of the central authorities,
 provide an important, if negative, slice of any govern-
 ment employee's incentive.
 ~~
 IV.   THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT
 The present leaders of the Chinese Communist
 Party clearly recognize that the county's armed
 forces, the largest single component of national
 security personnel in China, constitute the key-
 stone of their past and future power. .They take.
 elaborate measures to assure the tightest possible
 party control over the military.  They regard the
 proper staffing of the military establishment as
 a vitally important vehicle of this control.  As
 Mao has remarked, "the principle is far the party
 to direct the gun and not for the gun to direct
 the party."
 The final say in party policy toE~vard the
 armed farces rests with R7ao and his cmlleagues on
 the Standing Committee..  Tike formulation of general
 military policy for the party is, :however, en-
 trusted to the Military Affairs Committee, one
 of the most potent of the party's central organs.
 Key members of the committee hold the top posts in
 the Ministry of National Defense, which stands at
 the apex of the purely military chain of command.
 Trusted party men hold all. top military posts.
 The party has provided itself with two fur-
 ther checkreins over the armed forces at all
 levels.  The first is the extension of party com-
 mittees, sim3liar to those in civilian organs,
 to the military,  The second is the system of
 political officers under the General Political
 Department in the armed forces,  Every military
 unit, at least as far dawn as the company level,
 has both a party committee and a political officer.
 This provides the party with both horizontal con-
 trol, from civilian to military party committees
 on the same level, and vertical control, through
 the General Political Department's political offi-
 cer system.
 The Military Affairs Committee
 On this body Mao Tse~tung has gathered his
 most trusted old line military leaders and politi-
 cal officers still active in the armed forces.  It
 is likely that the marshals who helped Mao to his
 successes in the revolution are all on the committee.
 The names are a roster of old revolutionary heroes;
 ~,,,~-
 Lin Piao, Liu Po-cheng, Lo Jung-huan, Ho Lung, Nieh
 Jung-then, Hsu Hsiang-Chien, Yeh Chien-ying.  Mao
 probably sits in on the more important. committee
 sessions; Lin Piao is probably the effective oper-
 ating chieftan.
 Over the years this group of men scored many
 victories by following the accepted Maoist precepts
 of party primacy.  They still tend to look first
 and foremost to ideological purity and political
 dependability in determining individual qualifica-
 tions for military posts, and can be expected to
 try to keep a firm lid. on creeping professionalism
 in the armed forces.
 In at least one instance, however, the question
 of an individual's political reliability crept right
 into the ranks of the committee.  Between 195? and
 1959 Peng Teh-huai, Minister of National Defense
 and a leading figure on the committee, spearheaded
 a group which attempted to "regularize" the armed
 forces, i.e., to emphasize professionalism in the
 officer corps in part at the expense of political
 subservience,  The party, considering this a "purely
 military point of view", sacked Peng and his sup-
 porters.  Peng's reported attempt to elicit Soviet
 support contributed to his downfall.
 Remnants of Peng's ideas continue to annoy
 the more orthodox leaders.  Some officers have ap-
 parently continued to argue that the "suddenness
 and complexity" of modern warfare render the party
 committee system in the armed forces dangerously
 cumbersome and inefficient.  Mao's supporters re-
 spond that officers holding such views "estrange
 themselves from politics...and regard the army as
 a thing above class and. above politics."  Even
 in the present era of military dependence on tech-
 nology,. Mao and his supporters say it is possible
 for all military plans to be fulfilled by depending
 on the traditional Communist officer's "courage,
 self-confidence, fighting ability, esprit de.
 corps."  They conclude that t?day's officer must
 still be a "militant revolu~Yonary" who subordi-
 nates himself to the party and relies fox inspira-
 tion and practical guidance on the military doc-
 trines expounded in Mao's works.
 ~'G
 In an effort to strengthen the approved char-
 acteristics in the officer corps, Peiping holds up
 as exemplars the present members of the Military
 Affairs Committee.  Peiping has specifically ex-
 cluded them along with all senior generals, from
 mandatory retirement regulations.  officers at all
 levels are encouraged to study the memoirs of these
 leaders, and are given to understand that they
 should model themselves and pattern their careers
 on the example of these old heroes.
 As attrition begins to remove these aging
 committeemen from the scene, their replacements
 will doubtless be judged first on political alle-
 giance to the present party leaders, and secondly
 on military qualifications.
 Some observers have noted that apparently able
 Chinese Communist military officers fail to advance
 in grade and position as rapidly as would normally be
 expected.  There can be no doubt that a failure to
 impress the party leaders who make the promotions
 with a proper revolutionary spirit has in many
 cases been responsible.  Testifying to the impor-
 tance of party-oriented thinking in advancement to
 .the top military echelons is the fact that more
 than half of the present members of the Military
 Affairs Committee were once political officers in
 the armed forces.  One of them, Lin Piao, who is
 also the current Minister of National Defense, pos-
 sesses a brilliant combat record but is also exten-
 sively experienced in political work in the army;-
 another, Lo Jui-Ching, who is also the present
 Chief of Staff, is a man who made his reputation
 in security work.
 The General Political Department
 The other major organization through which the
 party exercises control and surveillance is the
 General Political Department of the armed forces.
 Wliile organizationally under the Ministry of De-
 fence, the General Political Department in practice
 enjoys a rather special position.  As the senior
 party agency within the .armed forces, it has its
 own separate channels of command and administration.
 It is the only organization on its level to which
 the party constitution devotes a separate article.
 This article states that the General Political De-
 partment will, under the direct leadership of the CeAztral
 Committee, "take charge of the ideological and or-
 ganizational work of the party in the army."  In
 fulfilling this role, the General,Political.Depart-
 ment is responsible for all propaganda, education
 and cultural activities within the armed forces..
 It also has a controlling say in personnel matters.
 The political officers which it assigns to
 each unit of the armed forces are responsible only
 to the political department, not to any military
 commander.  Except in the most extreme combat emer-
 gency, the political officer must approve an opera-
 tional order before it-can be implemented.
 One of the major ways in which the department
 effects the party's will is through its powers in
 controlling promotions, transfers, leave, and effi-
 ciency reports.  It also is in charge of the indoc-
 trination of military personnel, a more through-
 going program than is inflicted on other government
 workers.
 The man 3ast noted as head of the department,
 Tan Cheng, has been out of favor for several years.
 Though not formally removed, he is doubtless no
 longer trusted to administer the department's deli-
 cate and vital functions.  it is more likely that
 one of the senior figures of the Military Affairs
 Committee does this.  Either Lo Jung-huan, who has
 .zad many years of loyal service as top political
 ~~ai in the military, or Hsiao Hua, who is nominally
 the deputy director of the department, probably nQw
 exercises real departmental authority.
 The Ministry of National Defense
 Operating the defense establishment under the
 direction of these party bodies are the Ministry of
 National Defense and the central departments--the
 General Staff Department, the General Rear Services
 Department, the General Training Department and the
 General Cadres (personnel) Department.  The top
 jobs in all of these organs are controlled by Mao
 and the party center, and the incumbents are trusted
 party men..
 Professional military qualifications, however,
 begin to play a slightly more important role at the
 second level in the ministry.  There is, for example,
 a rough balance between men with preponderant mili-
 tary experience and men with preponderant political
 s`~
 backgrounds among the vice ministers of national
 defense and the deputy chiefs of staff.  It is at
 this level that the special representatives of the
 air force and the navy begin to be heard..
 No premium is put on formal academic education
 in the ministry:.  indeed, the average is quite low,
 The rise of better schooled officers, now at more
 junior levels, will inevitably alter the situation
 in the future.
 Below the deputy level  in the centa~al~~depart-
 rnents of the ministry, changes in personnel and in-
 fusion of new blood since 1950 have been sufficient
 to give a clearer picture of overall Chinese Com-
 munist military staffing. policies.  Most of the
 officers. now holding posts at this level are long-
 time specialists in their fields--armor, artillery,
 training, logistics, etc.  Still top party leaders,
 possibly acting on the recommendations of party
 branch committees in the Peiping headquarters, al-
 most certainly pass judgment on appointments at this
 level.  Regulations provide for the command of mili-
 tary regions, districts, and armies by officers of
 lieutenant general grade or above.  Divisions are
 commanded by major generals.  They are appointed
 by the State Council with the approval of the top
 party leadership which naturally wishes to assure
 that the selections work against the development
 of "independent kingdoms" reminiscent of the pre-
 communist warlord period.
 Regiments and battalions are commanded by
 colonels, and companies by captains.  The appoint-
 ment and transfer of all field grade officers is
 officially the duty of the ministry.  Its selec-
 tions are probably reviewed,. prior to being for-
 malized, by the general political department and/or
 the unit party committees.  Staffing at the com-
 pany level is the .responsibility of the regional
 military commander, or the chief of the appropriate
 branch of the service, and is probably checked
 through the party apparatus.
 Peiping keeps a full book on the training,
 experience, and qualifications of officers which
 is used along with political criteria as the basis
 for promotion at field and company level,  The re-
 gime has said little about personal qualities de-
 sirable in an officer.  It is clear, however, that
 ~ `~
 emphasis is put on men of action who have an ability
 to act independently in a military situation and
 carry through actions once started.  Emphasis on
 these factors may be motivated in part by the prob-
 ability that insistence on political acceptability
 among officers has caused many of them to adopt a
 play-it-safe attitude which in some cases tends to sap
 needed military initiative.
 Seniority is a factor of great importance in
 field and company grade promotions.  Advancement
 to the rank of senior colonel requires a certain
 period of service in the next ~Iower grade.  A lesser
 period is required for advancement to lower ranks.
 Time-in-service stipulations are not immutable, how-
 ever, and may be waived for especially meritorious
 officers.
 Overstaffing
 Top-heavy staffs are a burden to both Chinese
 Communist field and headquarters military units.
 The problem was made acute in 1955-1956 when the
 regime introduced some Soviet staffing practices
 alongside the existing .Chinese structure,  Although
 wholesale cutbacks were made in 1957 and in 1960,
 the process amounted basically to a reshuffling
 and reassignment of personnel and probably only a
 token number of officers were actually retired or
 placed in~reserve status.  The Peiping regime re-
 tains a high number of general officers in pro-
 portion to total strength.  The present ratio--some
 2,000 generals to a total strength of 2,600,000--is
 considerably higher than the current average in
 the better Western armies.
 Training
 In the old days when the Chinese Communist
 army was still largely a guerrilla force, military
 training was left almost entirely to the whims of
 the individual commander.  As a result it was piece-
 meal and haphazard.  By contrast, regular politi-
 cal indoctrination schools have been a feature of
 the military scene since earliest days.  in 1950,
 Peiping set about to establish a centralized mili-
 tary training system modeled for the most part on
 Soviet counterparts.  It also expanded political
 schooling.  Judged by Western standards, the pro-
 gram is still sketchy, elementary, and heavily
 political.
 l~
 The closest equivalent to awestern command
 and staff college is the Nanking Military Institute.
 Here facilities for officer training operated by
 the Chinese Nationalists have been taken over and
 expanded.  Promising upper rank field officers whom
 the regime considers good prospects for advancement
 to general officer status apparently form the main
 bulk of the student body.  Both political courses
 and military science subjects are taught,  Courses
 run from eighteen months to four years.
 Several establishments in Peiping, the People's
 Liberation Army Political Academy and the Academy
 of Military Sciences, appear to constitute a very,
 rough approximation of our own war college system.
 The former is perhaps the top institution for politi-
 ~~l instruction connected with the armed forces.
 Some formal academic training is included in the
 curriculum, and regular classes are. graduated.  Both
 senior political and military officers, including
 some general officers, receive advanced training.
 at the Institute.
 The Acadezn,y of Military Science was set up in
 1958 and charged with bringing the latest scientific
 and technical developments into the study of mils-
 tart' science in the Chinese armed forces. -Its found-
 ing was an obvious effoxt by the regime to try to
 prepare the Chinese Communist armed forces to cope
 with the demands of modern technological waxfare,
 even if they were not yet equipped to fight such a
 war.  It probably supervises research into advanced
 weaponry and doctrine on its use, and lectures senior
 military officers on these topics.
 Another organization apparently involved in
 this field is the Military Engineering Academy which
 reportedly teaches a curriculum heavily weighted
 with advanced technical subjects.
 Each of the main branches of the army, such
 as the artillery and the armored forces, has a
 separate system of schools.  The air force and the
 navy also have training set-ups which include
 academies for the .schooling of young officers simi-
 lar to US academies.  Qualifications for acceptance
 at such schools are determined in part b~  competi-
 hive examinations.
 ~C
 Throughout the armed forces school system, both
 political and military courses are offered.  Politi-
 cal training is in the hands of the political offi-
 cers at the training establishments and takes up
 almo~~t half of a student's- study time.
 In so far as regular in-service training is
 concerned, it was decreed in 1961 that the total
 amount of study time for officers was nvt to be
 over 500 hours per year for officers above divi-
 sign level, and 300 to 400 hours per year for offi-
 cers below this level.  Sixty percent of this time
 was to be spent on professional military subjects.
 The balance was to be spent on political studies
 and on formal academic training.  Specialized tech-
 nical units were permitted to spend up to 70 per-
 cent of their time. on professional sub3ects.
 From time to time, the regime has inaugurated
 "back to the ranks" movements, the military .counter-
 part of the civilian "down-to-the-farm" drives.. In
 these movements officers of all grades are required
 to serve short tours of from two weeks to a month
 as enlisted men in order to familiarize themselves
 with the problems and conditions at basic levels.
 Although the emphasis on this program varies from
 time to time, such tours are frequent enough to
 be considered a standard and time-consuming Chinese
 Communist technique.
 To provide new material for its ground force
 officer corps, the regime operates a number of basic
 officer training schools.  Non-commissioned .officers
 selected by competitive examination receive up to
 three years training at these institutions before
 obtaining their cornmissionse  In-lieu of attending
 basic officer institutes, highly qualified non-toms
 may sometimes obtain commissions by passing a spe-
 cial examination.
 Peiping has begun to look increasingly during
 the past few years to graduates of civilian college-
 level institutions as a source for officer material.
 As early as 1955, a law provided for the establish-
 ment of a system similar to~thc US ROTC program to
 train reserve officers in the universities.  After
 graduation, persons who had been trained under the
 system would, if needed, be directly commissioned
 and plated on active duty.  In this manner, and in
 the operation of the normal graduate placement pro-
 cess, the armed forces draw perhaps 3 to 5 percent
 of an annual graduating class.
 ~~
 Low academic standards in the Chinese Communist
 officer corps have been somewhat alleviated recently
 as a result of tougher regime standards on schooling
 prior to induction.  Today the typical officer up
 to the rank of captain probably has the equivalent
 of a high school education.  Ina bid to raise over-
 all armed force academic standards, Peiping announced
 a ten-year plan in 1959 to bring all officers up to
 college level.  Like other gradiose schemes intro-
 duced in the leap forward period, little has been
 heard of the program subsequently.. It may have been
 discarded in the general training cutbacks announced
 in 1960 by Defense Minister Lin Piao.
 Enlisted men are schooled as non-corns through
 a pattern of special battalions scattered through
 selected divisions.  Promising enlisted men are
 sent to thse battalions for courses lasting several
 months.,  They return qualified as squad leaders or
 for higher non-commissioned ranks.  Candidates must
 have demonstrated their political acceptability as
 well as military aptitude before enrollment.
 Since 1960 the Chinese Communists have started
 to shy away from their near exclusive dependence
 on Soviet military training manuals, a development
 doubtless spurred by the widening political breach
 between Peiping and Moscow.  The regime clearly
 continues to recognize the value of foreign mill-
 tary techniques, however. For example, some US
 doctrine has been disguised as Chinese and written
 into Communist training manuals.
 ~~
 V.   MANPOWER AND EDUCATION
 .One-quarter of the world's population lives in
 Communist China.  The rate of growth of this immense
 population showed a tendency to rise during the early
 period of Chinese Communist rule, reaching a peak of
 2.5 percent per year in 1958.  It probably dell there-
 after to 1.5 to 2.0 percent as food shortages contri-
 buted to a rise in the death rate..

 The Chinese Communist made hesitant and inef-
 fective efforts in 1956-195? to encourage birth con-
 trol.  Thereafter the effort slowed, and at present
 publicity on "family planning" is moderate and limi-
 ted in scope.  It is directed almost solely towards
 the urban `population.  The rural population makes
 up over 80 percent of the total in China, and rural.
 birthsmest be severely curtailed if a Chinese birth
 control campaign is ever to be effective.  Even if
 the, regime were energetically to prosecute a program.
 for limiting births, a mimimum period of at least
 five years would probably be required before the
 program would begin to reduce the national birth
 rate .
 The total labor force in Communist China grew
 from some 274 million persons in 1953 to about 316
 million persons in 1962.  Civilian employment

 increased from an estimated 271 million persons to
 about 313 persons.
 More than 85 percent of the civilian force
 was employed in agriculture.  Nonagricultural em-
 ployment at the end of 1962 is estimated to have
 been roughly 4 million persons higher than at
 the end of 1953.
 This does not, however, reflect the signifi-
 cant changes which occurred~in nonagricultural
 employment under the communists.  Prior to 195? the
 creation of new job opportunities in the. nonagri-
 cultural sectors of the economy lagged behind the
 growth of the population.  In 1958, the ''leap for-
 ward"' brought an enormous expansion in nonagricul-
 tural employment.  The figure went up by more. than
 15 million persons during a single year, bringing
 the total to 55 million.  In the ensuing economic
 debacle, nonagricultural employment declined by
 1962 to roughly 43 million persons.
 although Communist China has an abundant sup-
 ply of unskilled labor, it has always been faced
 with very serious shortages of technical and skilled
 labor, shortages that were partially eased by Soviet
 technicians until they were abruptly withdrawn in
 mid-1960.  The Chinese Communists have attempted to
 expand the number and quality of technicians and
 skilled workers at all levels.  The increase in
 the number of trained people and the accumulation
 of on-the-job experience during the past decade
 alleviated some, but certainly not all, of these
 shortages.
 The Educational System
 Great stress has been laid on various types of
 education by the Chinese Communists.  Schools were
 built in all parts of the country.  Large educational
 complexes made up of a number of technical colleges
 were established.  Such universities as Peiping,
 Tsinghua and Chiaotung, well-known before the Com-
 munist takeover, were expanded.  In the leap forward
 period of 1958-1960 the number of institutions for
 which college status was claimed rose so sharply
 that educational standards suffered badly.  The term
 college was bastardized to the point where several
 years later it remains difficult to establish how
 ~~
 many institutions of higher learning are operating
 in China. Institutions maintaining standards in
 any way comparable to higher educational levels
 elsewhere may not be much above the figure of 236
 existing at the beginning of the leap forward.

 Tl
 Total enrollment in institutions of higher edu-
 cation rose from 155,000 in 1947-1948 to around
 900,000 iri 1960-1961.  Enrollment fell thereafter
 and by the fall of 1962 probably was less than 800,000.
 There are four genexal types of universities
 and colleges operating in China--comprehensive,. poly-
 technical, specialized technical, and teachers colleges.
 Comprehensive universities in China are comparable to
 a faculty of arts-and sciences at an Aimerican aniver-
 sity.  They train scientists and college teachers in
 -56-
 ~~
 basic disciplines such as physics, astronomy, biology,
 the humanities, etc.  Peiping, Futan, and Nankai Uni-
 versities fall into this category,  Polytechnical uni-
 versities are made up of several .departments, the num-
 ber of fields .covered varying in different schools.
 Basic engineering principles are emp~iasized.  Ex-
 amples are Tsinghua, Chiaotung, and Harbin Industrial.
 Universities.  The specialized colleges train per-
 sonnel for specific assignments in the iron and
 steel or the aeronautical industry, in surveying,
 in trade and finance, etc.  The teachers colleges
 are intended primarily to provide teachers .for mid-
 dle schools.  Teachers for higher educational institu-
 tions are ,trained by the universities and colleges
 themselves.
 The number of graduates from these institutions
 from~l949 through 1962 is estimated to be 950,000
 distributed as follows:
 Engineering

 A high quality education was received by a small
 proportion of these graduates.  Most did not obtain
 an education equivalent to that commonly. received
 from accredited colleges in the United States,  A
 shortage of competent teachers was the major limita-
 tion.  Also eontribnting was the regime's idea that
 students should participate in labor and receive a
 liberal amount of political education.  In addition,
 almost all were allowed to graduate irrespective of
 academic achievement, many after only two or three
 years of course work.
 The choice of quantity over quality was eon-
 seiously made.. It was probably useful in serving
 China's short-term needs.  Narrow training in spe-
 cialized fields did turn out graduates fit to meet
 ~~
 immediate needs in industrial, mining, construction,
 and other activities.  The particular specialties
 of these narrowly trained men were not, however,
 always responsive to the demands of the moment a
 An attempt to meet the need for higher. quality
 in education, recognized as necessary for the long
 pu11, was. made in the better universities and poly-
 technical institutes.  Curricula, length of courses,
 and availability of competent professors suggest that
 some graduates of these schools were relatively well-
 trained.  Even in these schools there was some sacri-
 fice of quality.  Most students were required to take
 part in physical work and time-consuming political
 indoctrination meetings.  Teachers were overloaded.
 Effectiveness of the better professors was further
 reduced by burdensome responsibilities for planning
 and organizing, turning their talents to practical
 problems in industry and other activities, parrying
 disruptive directions of party authorities, and trying
 to carry out their work in a general atmosphere of
 frantic urgency to meet ill-defined. and changing  goals.
 Chinese universities have failed to produce the
 needed numbers of qualified people prepared to go for-
 ward into graduate work.  The Academy of Sciences in
 1955 and 1956 tried to recruit candidates for a four-
 year program of graduate training.  The selection was
 to have commenced in August 1955 but only 65 qualified
 students had been selected by March 1956.  In the
 fall of 1956 the academy found only 268 out of 1,470
 applicants qualified for its program.  Part of the
 problem was that many universities were retaining
 students for their own graduate programs started at
 about the same time.  The situation was so bad that
 in 1958 the academy set up its own University of
 Science and Technology to prepare students for later
 work at the graduate level.
 The graduate programs that got under way six years
 ago have not flourished.  Apparently no new graduate
 students were taken into the program after 1956 until
 the fa11 of 1962 when the academy enrolled 213 and
 the universities about 1,600.  None was reported to
 have completed his work until the fall.: of 1962, six
 years after the program started.  The academy re-
 ported in February 1963 that 99 had completed their
 work and that over 400 were in training.. Current
 graduate enrollment in the universities. may. be in
 the order of 2,000.  The number is not adequate
 for China's needs.
 Limitations on enrollments in the graduate pr?-
 gram ~-ppear to rest in large part on the shortage of
 scholars capable of and available for service as
 tutors.  In 1956 only some 200 persons in the academy
 were named tutors; only about 130. were .named in the
 universities.
 Use of Soviet Sehools
 Education of Chinese students in Soviet bloc
 countries has contributed to the supply of new
 scientific and technical personnel in China.  Chi-
 nese have been trained both in Soviet universities
 and colleges and in research insitutes of the Soviet
 Academy of Sciences and other academies.  Practically
 all Chinese students sent to the Soviet Union after
 1956 were graduate students.  Previously large num-
 bers of undergraduates had been sent with numbers
 reaching nearly 2,000 per .year in 1955 and 1956.
 After 1960 few new students of any level were sent,
 but a majority of those already enrolled continued
 their studies.  The total number sent in all years
 is about 7,500 of which about 2,500 were probably
 graduate students.  About 1,100 have completed work
 for the .Soviet kandidat degree.  Less than 1,000,
 probably considers  y  ess, are currently in train-
 ing at advanced levels in the Soviet Union.
 Chinese students in the Soviet Union pursued
 their studies in many fields of basic and applied
 science and engineering, judging by the titles of
 dissertations they have published in Soviet journals.
 Emphasis was clearly on bread-and-butter. subjects
 applicable to China's immediate needs.  Subjects
 supporting agriculture and public health were the
 most numerous.  Other fields were water conservancy,
 transportation, electric power, mineral exploita-
 tion, chemical and metallurgical industries, and
 machine building processes.  The dissertations re-
 vealed no effoxt to concentrate on complex new tech-
 nology associated with such fields as nuclear power,
 computers, modern aircraft, or missiles.
 - 59 -
 Chinese have taken part, however, in the acti-
 vities at the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research
 at Dubna, outside Moscow.  This institution trains
 personnel from all Soviet Bloc countries in nuclear
 physics, but not in nuclear weapons technology.
 The work at Dubna is apparently not in the nature
 of formal study leading to dissertation and degree.
 Chinese stu""dents returning from graduate study
 in the Soviet Union probably make up a large majority
 of the better. trained new researchers in China.  Al-
 though reasonably well trained in a formal sense,they
 are inexperienced.-  The best probably are assigned to
 research institutes of the Academy of Sciences and
 other academies ar to the universities.
 Scientific Manpower
 The leaders of Communist China appreciate the
 importance of the contribution made by science and
 technology to national security.  They want effec-
 tively planned and directed research in well-equipped
 and staffed laboratories.  Chinese capabilities in
 this direction have been greatly strengthened over
 the past decade.  Pr?gress, however, has been less
 than might have been expected from their resources
 and furious activity.  Several factors helped stunt
 the full flowering of Chinese science.
 First of all, many well-trained scientists
 in China were educated in the western non-communist
 world.  The regime regards their political relic-
 bility as doubtful.  The .leaders cannot risk plac-
 ing such men in policy-making roles.  They are even
 hesitant about placing such men in positions of
 lower level authority without the constant and
 overriding presence of a politically proven party
 stalwart.
 Secondly, the Chinese Communists' passion for
 quick success led them to use special methods which
 frequently were not as productive as more tradi-
 tional means.  Research work projects were started,
 then stopped, under misconceived plans.. Available
 research technicians were misused.  Large numbers
 of poorly trained researchers were thrown into pro-
 jects as though quantity would substitute for quality,
 The initiatives of experienced researchers were
 frustrated all too often by party cadres attempting
 to manage researchers as though they were machines
 with on-and-off buttons.
 ~/
 Thirdly, planning for the training of tech-
 nical personnel has failed in many cases to balance
 supply and need.  The attempt to fix the numbers
 needed in a narrow technical speciality three to
 five years ahead has seemed beyond Chinese capa-
 bilities.  By the time students complete their
 three- to five-year programs of higher education,
 needs in many cases have changed.  For example,
 the regime trained so many Russian interpreters
 and translators. that they were in excess long be-
 fore relations with the Soviets began to cool,
 The major staffing problem in China's scienti-
 fic organizations is, of course, to find Enough
 competent scientists and teachers.  At the present
 time, they have in general a few qualified men backed
 by a large body of poorly trained and inexperienced
 personnel.  They lack the large group of medium
 quality, experienced researchers of the kind that
 make up the main body of the scientific community
 in a technologically advanced society.
 China has a few well-trained and competent
 scientists in nearly every area of technology.
 Therefore, useful progress can be made in almost
 any scientific or engineering project  of suffi-
 ciently high priority.  However, there are not.
 enough first-rate people around to make progress
 in more than a limited number of advanced projects
 at any one time.  The rate of progress on a priority
 project can be stepped up only by a process of
 bleeding other projects.
 The training of scientists and technologists
 appears lately to have been put on a more promising
 track, but the principal resource for advancement,
 the well-trained and experienced tutor, remains in
 short supply.  There is no crash program that can
 solve the problem.
 ~~
 VI.   COMMUNICATIONS OF IDEAS
 The dissemination of news and opinion in Com-
 munist China is managed virtually in its entirety..
 The voice of dissent is infrequently raised.  The
 leaders in Peiping see their problem in this area
 largely o.ne of mobilising the party, the govern-
 ment and the population behind their programs.
 Principal communications media are used almost
 exclusively to instruct and oad.
 The party rank and file and the people are
 told only what the leaders feel is necessary for...
 the purpose of carrying out instructions.  Rarely
 does a hint creep out of policy disagreement dis-
 agreements within the privileged circle.  The
 party does not regard the spread of dissenting
 views expressed within this circle as at all helpful,
 and they are rigorously supressed.
 Classified Channels
 The principal means used by the leaders to
 propagate the party line are classified communi-
 cations, the open press and radio, and study meet-
 ings.  Classified publications and documents flow.
 out of the party center by secure telecommunica-
 tions, by post, and by hand or word of mouth.
 Leading party figures travel a good deal bringing,
 the latest word from Peiping.  Lesser leaders from.
 the outlying areas are brought to Peiping for the
 same purpose.
 The Chinese Communists are intensely suspicious
 and their security practices .a re stringent.  In fact,
 they incline to overload the system and hold tightly
 a range of information openly available in other
 countries,
 Many party and government organs produce re-
 stricted publications.  These go to a selected
 clientele, usually officials who have reached a
 designated level of responsibility or who occupy
 posts affected by a new turn in the line.  The con-
 tents are used by such officials as a guide to their
 day-to-day activities and as background for lectures
 to subordinates.  One such publication is Reference
 News, a daily bulletin which does little more than
 rye ash foreign news dispatches.. The fact that such
 a publication is distributed only to officials whose
 duties are judged to require it testifies to the
 Chinese Communists' security mania.  Open technical
 publications from abroad are handled in a similar
 fashion.
 The Party Press
 Despite this preoccupation with seen city, a re-
 liable key to Peiping thinking can be-found in the
 pages of party publications like People's Daily and
 Red Flag.  They are carefully studieid, for a reader
 3s`aware that he may be called upon for a personal
 elucidation of passages at the next meeting of his
 study group.  The Chinese party press, with its cap-
 tive audience, is surely among the dullest reading
 matter offered on a daily basis anywhere in the
 world.
 Articles in-the top Peiping publications re-
 garded as especially important get broad and timely
 dissemination.  They are broadcast to-both domestic
 and foreign listeners.  Materials so handled are
 speeches by important regime figures, communiques
 from Central Committee sessions, vital editorials
 and a host of lesser items.  This material frequently
 appears verbatim in ,papers outside the capital the
 same or the following day.  Collections of pertinent
 articles on a common theme are sometimes gathered
 into a pamphlet and distributed at home and wherever
 possible abroad.
 Meetings
 The meeting is a third channel which supple-
 ments and fills out the other two.  Meetings and
 conferences seem to be a necessary part of life in
 all societies, but in few places do they absorb
 so much of the person's time and energies as in
 Communist China.  The Chinese Communists have
 raised the meeting almost to a governing tech-
 nique.  From national conferences held in Peiping
 with great magnificence to the neighborhood study
 meeting in a humble dwelling down the block, group
 discussions are a prominent feature of the Chinese
 i me llectua 1 1a ndscape .
 Meetings can be strictly party affairs, or
 they can involve a mix of party and non-party types
 in which the party element is always dominant.
 The objective is to communicate decisions reached
 by constituted authority, to explain these deci-
 sions, to persuade those in attendance as to the
 wisdom of the course chosen and to point out to
 them their part in carrying out the decision.
 Even plenary sessions of the pa~?ty's Central
 Committee can be viewed in this light.  They pro-
 vide the opportunity for an airing of policy lines
 which have been hammered out in earlier, more re-
 stricted sessions.  Regional and. local party con-
 ferences follow to "pass along the spirit" of the
 Ce~ntral..Committee's deliberations.
 The same is true of sessions of the National
 People's Congress,  the China  People's Political Con-
 sultative Conference, and the Supreme State Con-
 ference.  Led by top party men, they are essentially
 meetings of citizens, whose counsels may at times
 be genuinely valued but who are normally brought
 together to hear party leaders expound party policy.
 An effort is made at such meetings to try and im-
 part to the non-party delegates a sense of partici-
 pation in the process of ruling .China.
 There are also specialized conferences like a
 statistical work conference ox a conference on politi-
 cal work in the armed forces.  These bring together
 a group of important officials involved in a common
 undertaking.  Some may precede a party decision on
 a given subject and may thus represent an opportunity
 for the expression of individual opinion.  But most
 publicized meetings are convened for the leadership
 to display its interest in a given topic and expose
 its views thereon.
 Some conferences are used, at least partially,
 as incentives.  For example,-the party sponsors
 periodic conferences of labor heroes, activists and
 other "advanced elements."  Individuals are brought
 to Peiping at public expense.  Some are a~Orded the
 honor of .meeting key figures, including at times Mao
 Tse-tung himself.  An invitation to such a conference
 doubtless confers considerable status locally on
 the recipient.
 By far the most prevalent meetings are the
 regular sessions of one's local study group,  Stim-
 ulated and directed by party cadres, these small
 groups of 10-30 persons meet regularly throughout
 China.  The leaders plainly attach much importance
 to them since they are willing to accept the signi-
 ficant losses in productive time which they entail.
 These meetings may take up no-more than a few hours
 a week or they may occupy half a day or more every
 day over an extended period..
 Attendance at the meetings, like-many other acti-
 vities in Communist China, is ostensibly voluntary.
 Social and other pressures are, however, exerted
 against absenteeism.  Anyane so bold as to cut the
 meetings cou3d expect visits from local party cadres,
 friends and colleagues which would be continued until
 he relented.  In the view of one ex-resident of the
 mainland, attendance is "like going to church. in an
 orphanage."
 The topics of these meetings are usually current
 affairs as seen through the eyes of the party leaders.
 The Sino-Soviet dispute and Khrushchev's many short-
 comings were popular subjects during 1962.  The lead-
 er, normally a party member, opens a meeting by outlin-
 ing the party's thought on, the selected topic.  Every-
 one joins in the subsequent discussion.  Failure to
 speak out is regarded as suspicious.  Persistent re-
 fusal to play the game would probably result in a re-
 quest for a written explanation.  This paper would
 then form the subject matter of a subsequent meet-
 ing.  Members of the group would subject the explana-
 tion to a searching critique for completeness and
 sincerity, both highly valued. in a self-criticism
 of this sort.
 Meetings are sometimes used to persuade an in-
 dividual or a group of individuals to accept some
 new task.  At the height of the down-to-the-farm
 movement in 1959-1962, meetings to persuade those
 earmarked for movement were common.  Not many city
 dwellers were anxious to go out and Live and. work
 with the peasants, but there were few recorded in-
 stances of refusal after a few persuasion sessions.
 The earnestness of the group's persuadors was doubt-
 less stimulated by a realization that a lack of
 all-out effoxt on their part would only single them
 as likely candidates for the next batch.
 The Chinese Communists have no fixed way of
 dealing with offenders.  One method is to expose
 an individual to public humiliation and ridicule
 at a "struggle" meeting.  Struggle meetings were
 more common during the land reform movement in the
 early 1950's than they are now.  They are still used,
 however, to deal with persons charged, for example,
 with counter-revolutionary activities.. The meetings
 are not meant to be public trials.  Izidividuals
 brought before them have already been .judged guilty.
 Tl~~e objective is to provide a salutory example for
 the people.
 Such a meeting might be opened by a recitation
 by the presiding cadre of the political crimes com-
 mitted, the heresies written, spoken or thought.
 Comments are invited from the audience, an inv~.ta-
 tion scarcely  to be ignored since silence .contains
 the suggestion of similar infection.  The meeting
 may accept a sniveling confession from the person
 being "struggled" with or move directly to sentenc-
 ing, usually either execution on the spot or an
 open-ended sentence at labor reform.  Those who have
 attended become active agents of regime retribution,
 Just how effective are these various methods
 of spreading the word? .The system appears to operate
 very well when it comes to disseminating regime policy
 downward.  It is in fact one of the mast effective
 things the Chinese Communists do.  The system operates
 less well in other direction.  It has been used too
 frequently by the leadership to smell out real or
 potential, dissent.  As a result it has become a
 sluggish instrumentality for conveying suggestions
 to the leaders or for informing them of real condi-
 tions in the country.
 This difficulty in upward communications bothers
 the leaders at the party center.  They have launched
 periodic campaigns to stimulate discussion and even
 criticism, and to insist on veracity in reports made
 to them.  They are doubtless sincere, but such ef-
 forts encounter formidible obstacles.  For one thing
 an individual can never be quite sure where the
 boundaries of permissible debate are at a given time.
 The boundaries shift, and what seems permissible
 today may turn out to be the rankest sort of devia-
 tion tomorrow.  Chinese have before them the lesson
 of aftermath of the liberalization effort of early
 1957 when the party promised free debate--to "let
 one hundred flowers bloom, let all schools of thought
 contend."  Many of the flowers turned into poisonous
 weeds in a short period of time, and a number of
 careers were blighted.  Recollection of this makes
 for caution in accepting present Party encourage-
 ment to speak out.
 - 66 -
 Nevertheless, genuine intellectual debate does
 take place.  In 1962, for example, economic publica-
 tions printed articles which advanced suggestions
 on how resources could be used more effectively.
 Others discussed in fairly frank terms the prob-
 lems of economic management in a socialist state.
 One even offered the argument that profits had a
 role to play in a socialist economy.  The airing
 of such ideas was clearly not an attempt by the
 leaders, who would probably regard the last argu
 ment as perilously close to heresy, to propagate
 a new party line.  It seems rather to have been
 part of an attempt to extend somewhat the bounda-
 ries of permissible intellectual discussion.
 VII.    A1?d APPRAISAL OF T~~ SYSTEM
 The guiding principles of Chizaese Communist per-
 .     sonnel management were formulated in the less com-
 plicated world of the Chinese revolution and do
 not appear to have been markedly cY=an;~d since.
 They include:  1) tlse absolute supremacy of the
 party, 2) a highly centralized management tech-
 nique, and 3) a remarkable continuity and uzaity
 of purpose at the top echelons.  They have pro-
 duced a disciplined and dedicated elite, but at
 some cost in flexibility and individual initiative.
 Mao Tse-tung and leis closest associated are
 strong personalities, the result of rigourous Chi-
 nese Communist selection processes.  The leading
 group has displayed high organizational administra-
 five capabilities.  It has been able to move with
 dispatch on some issues confronting China.  Its
 approach to others has been halting.  It moved
 very quickly to exploit to Chinese advantage Soviet
 c~:isconafiture as a result of the Cuban crisis in
 tl:e fall of 1962.  Communes were set up almost
 overnight in 1958, but the three-year retreat
 from these ill-conceived units-has, on the other
 hand., been slaw and painful.
 Party personnel processes have brought to the
 secozad level of authority devoted, loyal men who
 share the aims and convictions of the top leaders
 and speak the same language.  They are men who have
 had many years of administrative experience, men
 who have proven themselves to be tough and ruth-
 less.  Only true believers get this far in the
 system.  As a group they are more likely to be
 versed in Marxism--Leninism and the teaching of
 Mao than in a technical specialty.
 Itlany middle and lower Ievel officials appear
 able, but there does seem to be a shortage of good
 administrators and managers.  These lesser officials
 operate in a system which constantly preaches dis-
 cipline,  Naturally, many fail to develop an apti-
 tude for vigorous, independent action.  They become
 adept buck-passers, bureaucrats who cl~ecli too many
 things with Peiping.  This further overloads the
 top command in which key figures already hold severe 1
 concurrent jabs.  These officials can give less than
 full time and energy to any one of their posts.
 These men, whether in high party position or low,
 are in a sense the end product of Chinese Commun-
 i~:t political indoctrination.  Tl~.is striking pro-
 gram has to a great extent created and maintained
 a unity of approach unthinkable in a democratic.
 state.  No real opposition is countenanced and no
 alternative courses are offered,  There is tale-~
 Lively little wheel-spinning over objective or
 method.
 The framework for recruitment, transfer and
 promotion focusses a great, deal of power and re-
 sponsibility in a few hands.  The dominant leaders
 identify national security priorities and commit
 talent to favored programs in complete freedom.
 People selected for jobs have no real individual
 safeguards such. as exist in this or western nations.
 Most Chinese accept this sort of treatment, go where
 they are told to go by the authorities and do what
 they are told to do.  There is no outside competi-
 tion for talent.  Recruitment and assignment of
 personnel pxesent no problems; undesirable turnover
 is rare.
 The system permits the authorities to channel
 the country's best talent, insofar as it is avail-
 able, into key areas of national security.  Great
 efforts are made to stimulate work in approved
 scientific, technological and economic fields,
 especially those related to the martial arts.
 This work is supported and directed lay the party.
 FIowever, the system does try, all too fre-
 quently, to force round pegs into square holes.
 The overall record of the assigning authorities
 might be termed fair to good.
 Pax?sons who have visited Communist China testify
 that the average Chinese Communist functionary is a
 hard worker.  This is partly the result of the ex-
 isting personnel system.  Competition is fierce,
 and the individual must make his way within the
 mold in which the system has cast liim.  There is
 no opportunity to shift jobs, or even to resign.
 Advancement depends entirely upon pleasing the
 authorities above.  The asceticism preached by the
 party helps produce individuals willing to devote
 themselves fully to their work.  The sense of dedi-
 cation today may not be what it was in the earlier
 years, but enough remains so that it is a signifi-
 cant strength of the Chinese Communist system.
 Material incentives .are present and important
 in keeping tkae Chinese functionary bent to his task.
 lzis perquisites are small, but valued amidst the
 general poverty of China.  These functionaries also
 work under the stimulus of a system of retribution
 which operates on abstract and shifting principles.
 Overstaffing is a problem in today's China.
 awollen staffs can be attributed in part to the
 Chinese Communist practice of giving on-the-job
 training to people who will be moved to staff other
 offices or factories when they are finished.  A
 lack of mechanical aids means that many office and
 factory tasks, done elsewhere by machine, are done
 by hand in China.  But the most telling reason is
 simply China"s tremendous population.
 Skilled manpower in China is strictly limited,
 yet the present leaders fail to make full use of
 what. they have.  They seem quite willing to fritter
 away some of the talent they do dispose.
 Students who have been educated abroad are
 regarded, almost without exception, with suspicion
 when they return to China.  They are viewed as
 having been infected by foreign ideas.  It is up
 to them to prove otherwise, and over the long
 haul.  Many returned students, even those afire
 with the desire to help-build up a new China, fiiad
 it hard to break through this shell of suspicion.
 They find that the party will not make full 'use of
 their hard-won slciils.
 The leaders in fact find it hard to rely fully
 on technically trained people, no matter where their
 education was won.  There are in China competent
 scientists and economists who could contribute more
 than they do to the development of plans and practices.
 These people axe, under the operation of the present
 personnel system, rigidly excluded from policy-making
 roles.  The dominant figures--dogmatic, poorly edu-
 cated and distrustful men--prefer to rely for advice-
 on long-term associates who share the leaders' back-
 ground, prejudices and shortcomings..
 Talent is also wasted in the party's obsessive
 drive for political conformity.  Countless man-hours
 are devoted to political indoctrination and loss to
 production or the search for. technical know how'.  The
 authorities are willing to pay the price.
 The personnel situation in Communist China to-
 day is in some ways like that in tlYe Soviet-Union
 during Stalin's dying days.  The top strata, over-
 worked, old and tired, forms an impenetrable road-
 bloc for those below.  The bureaucracy is stagnating.
 Advancement, even of ably and trusted people, is
 generally slow and. ponderous.  Party seniority and
 personal relationships are still major factors in
 selection for responsible positions.  What remains
 to be seen is whether the departure of the present
 le~dears will rejuvenate the system.

 STAFFING A CHINSST COMMUNIST MISSION ABROAD
 The ~,ode1 staffing pattern of a Chinese Communist em-
 bassy offered in the following paragraphs is an amalgam
 of excellent covert reports on several Chinese Communist
 missions abroad.  Not all Chinese installations abroad
 will do all of the things discussed or do them in the
 same way, but the general pattern probably holds.
 General Principles
 The Chinese Communist Party controls all overseas in-
 stallations whatever their function.  The unit through which
 this control is achieved is the installation's party com-
 mittee.  Formation in the mid-1950's of such committees
 was in fact described as a "big step forward for the party
 in its leadership of diplomatic work."  At our model in-
 stallation, the committee is headed by the ambassador
 and includes the second ranking embassy official, the
 military attache and commercial attache.  It meets at
 least every other day and makes all decisions with re-
 spect to the operation of the mission, from whether the
 ambassador will accept a luncheon invitation to the tone
 of his conversational remarks if he goes.
 It oversees the indoctrination, training, and disci-
 Aline of all personnel.  It organizes the same kinds of
 campaigns among mission personnel that the party is em-
 phasizing at home.  It runs the basic foreign ministry
 study programs designed to train personnel in embassy
 duties.  These study programs are needed because many
 officers are sent abroad with little formal training
 in diplomacy.
 The committee also organizes the 1~asic party groups
 at the mission and oversees the semi--weekly indoctrination
 meetings which are compulsory for all embassy personnel.
 Minutes are kept of these meetings and are sent back to
 the Organization Department in Peiping.  Directives on
 party matters generally. come to the mission's party com-
 mittee from the Organization Department.
 The party committee serves as the basic field coordi-
 nating unit for foreign operations run by a variety of
 Chinese Communist agencies.  Sach of the functional sec-
 tions at the mission reports back to its counterpart in
 ~,~'
 S~~ET
 Peiping.  Regular mission personnel report to the Ministry
 of Foreign Affairs, the military attache to the Defense
 Ministry, the commercial attache to the Foreign Trade Minis-
 try, and the intelligence representative to the Party's
 Investigation Department.  These people get their assign-
 ment, direction, salary and operating expense from their
 parent organizations.  They all, however, ire subordinate
 to the party committee of the mission.
 In case of conflict which cannot be resolved satis-
 factorily by the local party committee, the parties to
 the dispute report the problem to their respective home
 offices in Peiping.. If the matter can't be resolved at
 this level it is referred to one of the Central Committee
 departments or the Central Committee itself.
 Personnel from the Investigation Department operate
 with a greater measure of autonomy than the others.  The
 practice seems to be keep the Ambassador .and the party
 committee informed on some intelligence operations, but
 not by any means on all.  These people can send reports
 to Peiping without getting the Ambassador's O.K.
 In the interest of using assigned personnel effec-
 tively, the ambassador has the authority to organize the
 mission as he sees fit.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 is frequently consulted and does make suggestions.  Travel-
 ling inspectors from the Ministry call periodically to
 chick on mission organization and operations. .Across the
 board economy measures are sometimes ordered by the Minis-
 try.  The chief ~of mission has some latitude in deciding
 how the cuts will be absorbed.
 Mission Personnel
 Our model mission, which is in a non-communist coun-
 try, has some 30 employees.  This is 20 fewer than it had
 before the last big austerity. cut in early 1962.  Although
 some Chinese Communist installations abroad employ local
 help, all 30 were sent out from China.  They can generally
 be classified into three groups; regular diplomats, profes-
 sional specialists and service personnel.  Practically all
 are party members.
 The Chinese Communist diplamatie service has a nucleus
 of career officers who are shifted from post to post abroad
 with an occasional tour in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 in Peiping.  The ambassador, the first secretary and several
 of the younger officers are~sueh men.  The bulk of the
 Embassy staff, however, had no background of any kind in
 8~
 foreign affairs when they arriv~sl.  Few had even travelled
 abroad.  They were selected from the government at large.
 Some had been surprised at their selection.  Not all were
 delighted.
 Only half a dozen of the mission's staff members can
 speak or read the language of the host country.  And only
 two of these are truly fluent.  They are valued and have
 been longer at the post than anyone else.  It is expected
 that this situation will gradually improve since .the foreign
 ministry is running intensive language courses back in Pei-
 ping, and the students there h~r~te been assured by Foreign
 Minister Chen Yi that it is not a deviation to become ex-
 pert in a foreign tongue.  Chen is said to have been dis-
 appointed in the quality of linguists produced and to have
 demanded that more and better ones be trained.  Language
 study is usually available at the overseas installation.
 The ambassador, a man in his late fifites, has been
 a Chinese Communist Party member since he was a student.
 Prior to his present assignment, he worked in the Ministry
 of Foreign Affairs in Peiping.  His only actual foreign.
 experience was an earlier assignment as a staff member at
 an embassy in a Soviet bloc country.
 .The ambassador does not fill the popular image of
 a suave diplomat.  He is regarded by his subordinates.
 as capable and efficient. in-`his work, cold and methodi-
 cal in his personnel relations.  He is married, and has
 several children.
 His wife, but not his children, accompanied him
 to his present post.  She works at the embassy.  He is
 fond of Chinese cooking and eats the food prepared by
 the embassy cook.  He smokes a great deal, but drinks
 only moderately.  Extremely hard working, he spends most
 of his day at the office.
 The number two man is the counselor, who is about
 50 years old.  He is a normal school graduate and has
 been a party member since World War II.  He has held a
 series of party positions, but,- prior to being assigned
 to his present post, he had no previous experience either
 at the foreign ministry or at other missions.
 As in the case of the ambassador, the counselor's
 wife, but not his children,'~~l~~s accompanied him.  His
 wife also works in the embassy.  The counselor, a bluff,
 outgoing man, is relatively free with his opinions.  He
 is well liked and considered competent by his subordinates.
 The third ranking man at the mission is the first
 secretary.  A man in his late forties, he has a college
 education and is the most fluent linguist at the embassy.
 A party member, he has, been with the Ministry of Foreign
 Affairs since the early 195U's, and has been at his pre-
 sent post for six years.,  He has considerable administra-
 tive responsibilities within the embassy.  He also over-
 sees the Embassy's Country Section which works on monitor-
 ing local publications and takes a leading role in local
 embassy reporting.  He is not married.
 The military attache, a lieutenant colonel, is about
 45.   He is a long-time member of the Chinese Communist
 party.  His entire adult career has been spent in the
 military service.  He has only a secondary school educa-
 tion. .Prior to his present assignment he had a tour
 of duty at another mission as an assistant military at-
 tache.
 In his present position, he represents all branches.
 of the Chinese Communist armed forces.  He is a bluff,
 straightforward man, completely loyal to the party.  He
 is married, but his wife is in China.
 The embassy commercial attache is a man in his late
 forties.  A long time member of the Chinese party;- he
 has only a grade school education... Both his commercial
 and foreign service experience is scant.  He was once
 employed by a department store in a major Chinese city.
 He was a member of a trade delegation to a Soviet bloc
 country in the mid 1950's.  This was his only connec-
 Lion with his present work, except for a brief tour to
 various parts of China designed to familiarize him with
 Chinese export products.  His wife originally accom-
 panied him to his present post but was forced to re-
 turn in an earlier economy drive.
 The cultural attache, a man of 5U years, is a lsv a
 long time party worker.  After graduating from a techni-
 cal school, he turned his hand to journalism and worked
 for the New China News Agency for several years.  This is
 his first overseas assignment.  His wife is with him and
 works as his assistant at the embassy.
 The nominal head of the General Affairs Section, who
 is about 35 years old, is actually the chief of the em-
 bassy's Investigation Department unit.  As such he is the
 only officer at the embassy besides the ambassador per--
 mitted to leave the embassy compound along.  His wife is
 with him and works as one of his assistants.  Both are
 very experienced in intelligence work, and both are long
 time party members.

 One of the employees of the Country Section was re-
 cently sent back to China,  He was a man of around 35, who
 had come from a good family and had served in various
 foreign posts since the early 1950's.  He did not, how-
 ever, get along with the ambassador, who, he felt, dis-
 criminated against him.  He was subjected to several
 long rounds of ~~criticism and self-criticisms' at the
 embassy, and, when he failed to display a proper atti-
 tude, and was sent back to China for an indeterminate
 period of corrective physical Labor.
 The Operation of-the Mission
 The business of the mission is to serve as the eyes
 and ears of Communist China in the country concerned and
 to do what it can locally to implement Chinese Communist
 foreign policy.  The ambassador once told the staff that
 he considered the main tasks of the mission were: to in-
 fluence local public opinion in favor of the Chinese Com-
 munists; to turn the country from its pro-western stance;
 and to help overthrow the government.  There was not a
 great deal of optimism at the installation that these
 aims were at all feasible.  It was recognized that the
 embassy was hampered by lack of money and qualified people,
 and by the:party's insistence on regarding the mission as
 a beleaguered castle in the heart of enemy country.
 The main effort is of course to collect .information
 on the country in which the embassy is locatedb  This is
 accomplished in three principal ways:  by close attention
 to the local press and radio, by open contacts with the
 local populace, and by covert operations.  The mission's
 linguists regularly read the leading local newspapers
 and magazines.  articles judged to be of interest to Pei-
 ping are translated.  Those which comment on China are
 commonly included, though there is a tendency to soften
 some of the more critical material.
 Items which contradict an official Chinese Communist
 interpretation of a situation are often altered or ignored.
 The translation are airmailed to other posts in the area
 and to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  This service forms
 the bulk of the embassy's day-to-day reporting.
 Reporting from the post does not draw heavily on in-
 formed local opinion.  This is probably due to the-fact
 that the embasy does not expend great efforts to estab-
 lish and maintain close .contacts either in local official
 or non official circles.  Some staff members, including
 SF
 the ambassador, tend to regard contacts with non--communists
 as generally worthless and potentially dangerous.
 They may have in mind the fate of an earlier officer
 who was forced to undergo a lengthy session of self-criti-
 cism both at the embassy and back in Peiping fo-r.havng
 had too wade and free contacts with the local population,
 In addition, the military attache probably recalls his en-
 tirely unsuccessful attempts to visit local military estab-
 lishments,
 Even contacts with the local communist party. are none
 too free.  In the first place the leadership of .the local
 party has shown a tendency to lean toward the- Soviet side
 in the Sino-Soviet dispute.  The ambassador and the coun-
 selor have on several occasions expressed their disgust
 with them, suggesting that their consuming interest in
 personal comfort was no way to get a revolution going.
 There are, however, several local communist's who are
 viewed' with favor, probably for their more militant .stands.
 These are cultivated by the top people at the embassy who
 have them in for talks and accept invitations to visit
 their homes or offices.  Other than this, the embassy's
 contacts with the local party are limited to attempts to
 place articles favorable to the .Chinese Communist posi-
 tion in local communist outlets.  The principal objective
 in dealing with the local party is to influence rather
 than to learn.  No attempt is known to be made to tap
 the local apparatus for information and insights on the
 local scene.  The views which appear in the local commun-
 ist papers are included in the material airmailed back
 to Peiping, but the ambassador rejected an idea that
 wider contacts would. be useful on the grounds that he
 knew more of what was going on in the country than the
 local party did.
 The embassy, along with a number of other~Chinese
 Communist missions abroad, has come undex fire recently
 for failing to understand conditions in the countries
 to which they are attached..  The embassies were ci?iticized
 for their failure to get and rep?rt t~inside information'
 and for their superficial anmlys.is of such information
 as was: collected.
 The main reportorial effort goes into the semi-
 annual policy and progress review.  This is written by
 the ambassador using contributions from each of the em-
 bassy's functional components.  It covers the objectives
 pursued by the embassy in the past six months, the progress
 made toward reaching them,t;he`>problems encountered and
 a statement of what remains to be done.  Such summaries
 are apparently called for in the Ministry of Foreign Af-
 fair's reporting schedule.  They probably are used in com-
 piling the Ministry's own periodic progress reviews.
 These perio die studies supplement and summarize regular
 classified pouch and cable messages in which the embassy
 sets forth its observations on the local scene.  These are
 neither particularly voluminous  nor frequent.  Added in-
 formation is provided by the local representatives of the
 Investigation Department.
 In the first half of the 1950's, the Chinese shifted
 the intelligence gathering function among different party,
 government and military agencies,  Beginning in 1956 it
 was gradually brought under more centralized control...
 The function came to rest in the party's Investigation
 Department under Tsou Ta-peng.  The department is not
 listed in any unclassified official government or party
 documents and can be considered a completely clandestine
 organization.  This organization sends its awn people
 abroad under the cover of government agencies which have
 legitimate overseas connections.
 Personnel sent abroad under foreign ministry cover
 conform to the general standards for diplomatic personnel.
 Both length of tour and conditions of service are similar
 to those of the ministry,.  Wives of intelligence officers
 are frequently sent abroad.  There seems to be a decided
 preference .for husband-wife teams in Chinese intelligence
 work.  Wives not only do secretarial work, but in many
 cases serve as couriers or agent handlers.
 Generally, but not invariably, intelligence personnel
 are placed in the middle range of foreign service assign-
 ments.  Whatever the cover position, the individual is
 accorded treatment inside the embassy in keeping with his
 party status.  Persons whose cover position is of a lower
 grade than his real position with the Investigation De-
 partment are paid the salary of the cover position9 the
 difference is credited to his bank account in Peiping.
 The embassy's intelligence people draw heavily on
 the local Chinese community for agent personnel.  Major
 intelligence targets include political, economic, seenti-~
 fic, industrial and military developments in the country.
 where the embassy is located as well as in nearby nations.
 Regional groupings, the impact of US economic and military
 aid and the extent of the US influence are other subjects
 of interest.

 Committee's tenth plenum ~.z~ ~~:ptember 1~~~.   4Vk3en the am-
 bassadors return to their posts, tl~e~Y pass along to key
 members of their staffs the substance of the information
 received.  Embassies occasionally are visited by touring
 officials from Peiping, who usually brief the embassy
 staff.  .
 As a general rule, the members of the mission feel
 isolated  from Peipin  and have  been at  tinges  embarrassed
 by  the  lacy of  specific  policy guidazace.   Many Chinese
 foreign service personnel,- for example, were not able to
 interpret either the commune program or the Chinese posi-
 tions in tine amino-soviet dispute to Peiping's satisfac-
 tion.  In some cases even the ambassadors were not filled
 in well enough to discuss important matters with members
 of their own staffs.
 Tlae  embassy Yias  found .that  its  quickest  and most
 direct contact with the party line is Radio Peiping.  The
 ambassador has made it compulsory for all personnel to
 listen to two one-hour programs every days  He feels
 that this contributes to the embassy's understanding
 of what is going on in Peiping and provides useful ma-
 terial for the regular study sessions.  The ambassador
 himself gets an airmail copy of the People's Daily, which
 generally arrives three days after printing.  The daily
 bulletin of the New Claina News Agency are also received
 by airmail.  All party men at the embassy subscribe to
 the elite theoretical journal Red Flag, but it reaches
 them by surface mail about a m~h~~er publication.
 Difficulties in communication are particularly
 irritating to embassy Officials since they must con-
 stantly refer even seemingly trivial matters to Peiping
 for decision.  All requests for visas, for example, have
 to be checked with Peiping, as do such matters as who
 is to be asked to the annual observation of National
 Day.
 Life Abroad
 ~Hembers of the embassy lead a highly insular existence.
 Not only are they cut off from home by distance and poor
 communications but the party's approach to the problem of
 runni:~g an embassy in a capitalist country cuts them off
 from rewarding personal relationship's with local in-
 habitants.  Life at the embassy is viewed as a constant
 struggle against the "corrupting influence of the capital-
 ist world.Tt .The ambassador regards tl~e struggle as parti--
 culaa^ly acute in his embassy since all personnel are daily
 confronted with the palpable difference between what the party
 has taught them about a capitalist country and the reality
 around them.
 The .party's answer is to try to recreate the living
 and working conditions of Peiping at the embassy.  The
 ministry, for example, lzas gone to the trouble and ex-
 pense of sending a Chinese cook to the embassy.  Everyone
 eats Chinese food prepared by him.  They eat well by Chi-
 nese standards, but not lavishly.  Most staff members
 wear the plain style of trousers and jacket popularized
 by the Chinese Communist leaders, although the top people
 sometimes don western-style clothes when leaving the em-
 bassy precincts.  Only the highest ranking men, or Investi-
 gation Department personnel, can leave. the embassy alone.
 A11 others must leave in pairs.  Even so, the ambassador
 recently instituted a requirement that those leaving had
 to sign out, stating where they were going, and why, and
 when they would be back.
 Except for the ambassador and his wife, all staff
 members eat in the embassy mess hall and sleep in embassy
 quarters.  Both are in the same building with. the embassy
 offices.  The ambassador and his wife live in a separate
 house, and while he sometimes joins the staff for a meal
 he usually eats in his office with his wife or another
 colleague.
 The embassy is open for business from 8:30am to 6:OOpm.
 Recreation is planned in advanced and taken in groups.  It
 generally involves short trips to nearby places.  At other
 times reading, 1'istening to the radio, watching televi-
 sion or an infrequent movie sent out from China are the
 chief forms of relaxation.  Such moves were more common
 prior .to the big 1962 austerity movement than they are
 now.  A dinner will sometimes. be sponsored by the embassy
 at a local Chinese restaurant, say, to celebrate Chinese
 New Year's or the anniversary of the founding of the Chi-
 nese Communist government.. Hoa~ever, invitations to diplo-
 matic functions even from embassies of the socialist bloc,
 are closely monitored by the party committee and not in-
 frequently rejected,  Some are accepted and then ignored.
 The atmosphere inside the embassy building is one of
 mutual suspicion.  Petty admonitions are common.  The more
 progressive elements are constantly on the-alert for sug-
 gestions of deviationist tendencies.  For example a simple
 act like turning on the embassy television set might `open
 one to charges of being attracted to the bourgeosie life.
 ~C~2ET
 Such a charge, once made, can easily develop into an ex-
 tended and uncomfortable period of self-criticism at the
 embassy's regular study groups.
 Homesickness is common.  Tours of duty-are long and
 only senior officers have their wives with them.  The
 younger~gfficers serve without their wives, who are left
 behind in China with the children.  For such officers
 the news of hardships at home for the past few years has
 been particularly upsetting.
 Bachelors fare little better.  They are warned against
 fraternizixig with local girls and can under no circumstan-
 ces marry one.  There are no female employees except for
 the wives of higher-ranking officers. -One bachelor at the
 embassy had been engaged to a girl back in China.  She mar-
 ried someone else when he could not get leave to return
 to China.
 There are, however, saving elements in the situation.
 The officer abroad gets a clothing allowance and free
 medical service.  His food and lodging are provided at
 nominal charges.  Most of them are able to build up their
 savings, and some officers at the embassy deposit up to
 50 percent of their salaries in their accounts in Peiping.
 Need for local currency is limited, but the officers do
 like to purchase and send back to relatives items such
 as clothing which are hard to come by in China.  One of
 the ranking officers has. taken advantage of his ,present
 assignment to pick up a number of luxury items for him-
 self'.  He has bought a radio, a television set, a Germa n
 camera, a Swiss watch, a record player and new clothes
 for himself and wife.
 It is likely that, despite the restrictive aspects
 of his life abroad, the average employee of the embassy
 considers himself better off than if he had remained in
 China.  As one of them once remarked, f'If I had not joined
 the party, I would probably still be an insignificant
 school teacher back in Chinas`

 ANNEX  II
 THE STAFFING OF AN INTERNAL SECURITY AGENCY
 The Chinese Communist regime must maintain public.
 order over a territory of 3.7 million square miles-and a
 population of almost 730 million people.  Although ,the
 Chinese regime places great emphasis on persuasive meas-
 ures to achieve political stability, the coercive aspects
 of this national security goal are also extensive.
 The Ministry of Public Security represents. the
 coercive arm of the go.~rernment.  The Canton Public Secu-
 ity Bureau one of the Ministry's geographical subdivi-
 sions, is an important part of the security system.  Can-
 ton in Kwangtung province is the fifth largest city in
 the country and is located in part of China which has
 extensive foreign contacts.  Many Overseas Chinese come
 from Kwangtung.  Canton is close to the free world .border
 at Hong Kong.  Daily social and business traffic between
 the two cities is substantial.  Canton is a natural head-
 quarters both for external intelligence operations and
 for operations designed to counter foreign penetration
 attempts.
 Comparatively detailed information on the staffing
 policies of the Canton Bureau have provided by a
 man who worked in the Economic Security Department of
 this Bureau for about four years.  Prior to his defec-
 tion in 1958, he was charged with investigating the poli-
 tical reliability of the employees of government economic
 agencies such as industrial plants, banks, and commercial
 units.  The personnel of the Economic Security Department
 were essentially plainclothes investigators.  One of
 their functions was to screen employees of economic.
 agencies.  By 1958, the Economic Security Department
 had investigated and maintained files on more than
 80,000 persons, almost four percent of the city's
 population.
 The Canton Public Security Bureau employed about
 7,000 persons, of which some 2,000 were professional per-
 sonnel.  The professionals represented a fairly homo-
 geneous group with respect to age, social origins,
 and political status.                                   .
 9G
 CRET
 The employees of the Bureau were all. young.  With the
 exception of the head of the Bureau who was in his late
 forties, almost all full-time professional personnel were
 under 30.
 Most members mf the bureau staff were not natives
 Af Kwangtung.  They were recruited largely Pram n?rthern
 China and thus had few personal ties with the local popu?
 lation.  The family background of employees was closely
 checked.  loo family connections with either substantial
 wealth or anti-communist political movements were.permis-
 sible.  The individuals themselves could have had no af-
 filiation with a political movement other than the Chi-
 nese Communist Party.  Mo foreign associations were per-
 witted, either travel abroad or relatives residing over-
 seas.
 All 2,000 professional employees of the bureau were.
 party members, and many others on the staff were Youth
 League members.  The senior people represented a hard
 core of experienced personnel.  Each of the top five
 had had more than 20 years of experience in Chinese Com-
 munist intelligence work.  Together they prabably made
 up the bureau's party committee.
 All other professional personnel had been recruited
 from one of the four following groups:  1) young men in
 party or Youth League work, recommended by the party
 officials in charge of these groups as being particularly
 "progressive" and promising; 2) exceptionally bright high
 school graduates, recommended by school authorities and
 selected by the bureau on the basis of competitive ex-
 amination; 3) former police or intelligence operatives
 of the Kuomintang, employed as agents for specific pro-
 jects because of their special knowledge of either tech-
 nique or locality. (use of such individuals was more com-
 mon in the early 1950's than in 1958); and, 4) wives of
 bureau employees.  In 1958 there were about 500 women
 employed in the bureau.
 With the exception of the third category, most em-
 ployees had virtually no experience in police work when
 taken into the bureau.  Recruits entering on duty. were
 given a basic training course in public security opera-
 tions at the bureau's training center, the Canton Insti-
 tute of Public Security.  This was followed by a six-
 months probationary assignment.  Successful completion
 of this pair of programs resulted in the recruit's full
 integration into the public security force.
 SE~`~ET
 ~~
 Thereafter personnel of the bureau were trained em-
 pirically on the job.  Formal instruction was offered
 after hours in. general investigation and surveillance
 techniques.  zany availed themselves of this opportunity..
 Few members of the bureau were sent out of Canton for
 further training.  At higher levels of the public secu-
 rity system, study for as long as two years at the Na-
 tional Public Security Institute in Peiping was manda-
 tory.  Such a course of study was a prerequiste for
 promotion to .the section chief level in a provincial
 public security bureau.
 The Canton municipal and Kwangtung provincial public
 security organizations each had. their own schools.  These
 specialized in part-time training courses, offering poli-
 tical as well as technical courses.
 Day-to-day political indoctrination at the bureau
 was the responsibility of the party committee.  Sessions
 were both frequent and thorough.  Besides attendance at
 the usual sessions of his political study group the
 party member had to present himself at meetings c?n-
 ducted quite often by the bureau's party committee which
 contained a large measure of political instruction.
 There were no overall educational standards for
 employment in the bureau.  Self-improvement was encour-
 aged in all walks of life in Communist China and any de-
 sire for schooling was encouraged.. The staff did not
 appearto be under any strong pressures, however, to
 improve its educational level.
 Promotion in the bureau was based on a combination
 of the individual's ide?logical sturdiness and his pro-
 fessional ability.  Below the level of section chief
 at the bureau, the departmental party committee could
 recommend promotion to the political department of the
 bureau.  The actual promotion action was taken by the
 political department..  For promotion to section chief, the
 departmental recommendations was reviewed by the party
 committees at both the Canton and the Kwangtung Public
 Security Bureau.  It was then submitted to the Canton
 Party Committee for final action.  Department-heads
 at the bureau were appointed by the Canton Party Com-~
 mittee with the approval of the State Council.
 Transfers were fairly frequent within the public
 security system.  The former bureau employee worked
 for four years.>as an investigator in the Hunan Pro-_
 vincial Pub lie Security Bureau before being transf~~red
 r~
 to Canton.  His transfer was also a promotion.  then he
 got to Canton, he wau assigned administrative responsi-
 bilities for the first. time and was appointed deputy sec-
 tian chief in an organization doing the same type of
 investigation work that he had done in Honan.  Trans-
 fers also occur to Gobs which require security training
 outside the public security agencies.  The Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs, for example, gets it security person-
 nel from these agencies.  Special training necessary
 for a new assignment--such as the complicated physical
 security measures needed to protect an embassy in foreign
 territory, or the use and detection of electronic de-
 vices--is provided by the security agencies prior to
 transfer.
 The grade and classification system used in the
 Canton bureau in 1958 was still provisional, although
 other civilian .and military ranking systems had been
 fixed by about 1955.  A rank classification committee
 had been established in Peiping of representatives
 from the Ministry of Public .Security, the Central Com?
 mittee of the Party, the State Council, and the General
 Political Department of the armed forces.  The committee
 was set up to study the Soviet public security organiza-
 tion and to formulate standards for classification and
 the assignment of Chinese public security personnel.  As
 far as the former employee knew, it had never .issued its
 findings.
 Public security employees enjoyed a relatively high
 standard of living and a measure of prestige.  The pro-
 fessionals as a group were extremely young.  Their edu-
 cation was no better than moderate.  Yet they held re-
 sponsible positions in an organization which exercised
 a considerable measure of control over the general popu-
 lation.
 Living standards for public security personnel at
 the professional level appeared to approach the levels
 enjoyed by officers of the armed forces.  Only single
 men were required to live in barracks.  In 1955 only
 about 1,000 out of ?,000 employees did so.  The em-
 ployees were well uniformed and enjoyed both food and-
 drink on a scale not granted to the average Chinese.
 Salary payments were considered adequat?.~ And it was
 possible to incur operational and entertainment expenses
 in the line of duty if they were substantiated by authors-:~-
 ~a~d receipts.
 SE   ET
 99
 Discipline within the public security force was
 largely a party responsibility, since almost ail em-
 ployees were members.  Punishment depended, of course,
 on the nature and severity of-the offense, but it al-
 ways included a crawling session of self-criticism be-
 fore the relevant party committee.  If the misdeameanor
 was serious enough, self-criticism could be followed by
 removal from position, demotion in either grade or
 salary, dismissal, or .actual criminal prosecution.  Dis-
 ciplinary action could be taken for reasons that extended
 well beyond job-related misconduct into an individual's
 private life.  The former employee was once disciplined
 by the party after his wife, herself a party member,
 reported that he struck her.  More damaging, however,
 was her second charge that he frequently criticized
 party meetings in private for being .dull and time-con-
 suming.
 STAFFING AN INDUSTRIAL PLANT
 A basic policy of the Chinese Communists is that the
 key positions in state-owned enterprises must be filled
 by trusted party officials, regardless of their tech-
 nical qualifications.  This rule has been relaxed slightly,
 but only slightly, since 1960 when the party decided re-
 luctantly that it would have to begin giving greater re-
 spect to technicians.   Trained persons are being given
 more authority over actual production processes, but the
 chief of a plant is still invariably a long-time party
 official.  Most of his key deputies still come from the
 party organization rather than up from the ranks of tech-
 nicians.  Exceptions exist mainly in very tiny enter-
 prises or those employing especially complex processes.
 In such .cases the deputy will probably turn out to be
 a non-party technician.  In general, however, non-party
 persons can aspire to reach only the third echelon, be-
 low the manager and his deputies.
 The party further insures control by providing
 the officials that staff the plant's Party Committee.
 This committee is a sort of board of directors supply-
 ing policy guidance and overseeing operations.  Full-
 time of~f3cials on the committee. rank with senior manage-
 ment.     Friction between party and managem~;nt  oca.si~~~xa~1~-r?-`r~--
 1y occurs, but the party generally is able to-keep it in
 check.  It is not uncommon to have the same person serve
 concurrently as plant Manager and as 'secretary of the
 Party Committee.   ,,
 Information on current staffing practices in Chi-
 nese Communist enterprises can be obtained from the
 large number of refugees who are constantly leaving
 the mainland of China for Hong Kong.  Probably a typi-
 cal staffing pattern is the one that exists in the
 Peiping Machine Tool Plant Number Two.  A man who worked
 at this plant until 1962 says it is average in size
 and level of technology.  It employed 3,500 workers
 in 1960, a total that was cut to 2,400 during the na-
 tionwide industrial retrenchment of 1961-1962.  Its
 products are metal-cutting machine tools (two models
 of a grinding machine, a shaper, and a boring machine)
 which it sells for the equivalent of $1,300 to $20,000
 each.  Its quality standards are high, and it managed
 to export 50 shapers in 1962.
 ~.?
 1>
 The manager of the Macriine Tool Plant has three de-
 puties, who run the production, supply and administra-
 tion, and personnel departments.  Like most Chinese
 enterprises, this plant is organized on three levels of
 administration:  departments, sections, and basic-level
 units (such as workshops and warehouses).
 Senior personnel at the plant were described by the
 refugee.  The chief, 45 years old,-had participated in
 the Long March of the 193~'s.  He has a ninth-grade
 education, is married, and has three children.  His
 wife works in the Personnel Section.
 The first deputy, 55, runs the Production Depart-
 meet.  He has the title of Chief Engineer although he
 has no technical knowledge and must rely on the Chief
 of his Technical Section for technical guidance.  A
 good political organizer, he has only a sixth-grade
 education.  The second deputy, 55, is in charge of
 supply and administration.  Also a veteran of the Long
 .March, he has a junior middle school (ninth-grade)
