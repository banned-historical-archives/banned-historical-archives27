 FOREWORD
 Foreign and Domestic Influences on the Colombian,
 Communist Party, 1957 - August 1966, the second of OCI's
 intelligence studies to deal with a free world Communist
 party, should be read in conjunction with Foreign and Do-
 mestic Influences on the Venezuelan Communist Party,
 1958 - MID-1965, published in late 1965.  As a category,
 the OCI intelligence studies are aimed at situations where
 study and analysis in some depth seem likely to shed new
 light on long-standing US security problems, to give timely
 warning about an emerging problem, or to assist the pol-
 icy maker in considering ways of coping with any such
 problems.  These research. papers appear on no definite
 schedule but rather as a suitable subject happens to co-
 incide with the availability of the special manpower re-
 sources required.
 Assistance in the preparation of this paper has
 been received from various components of the Directorate
 of Intelligence, notably the Research Staff.  It has been
 informally coordinated with the Office of National Esti-
 mates.                            Comments should be directed to the Office of Cur-
 rent Intelligence.

 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
 The years 1957-1966 offer a special oppor-
 tunity to study foreign and domestic influences
 on the Colombian Communist Party  (PCC) because
 the period covers both the rise of the Sino-Soviet
 dispute and an era when the chief question for the
 party domestically was whether a policy of violence
 or of orthodox political activity--the via armada
 or the via pacifica--provided the most promising
 road to power.   With the overthrow of dictator
 Gustavo Rojas Pinilla in May 1957,  the PCC found
 itself in circumstances seemingly conducive to
 growth.   Like its fellow Communist party in
 Venezuela  (PCV) the following year, it regained
 legality after a prolonged period of suppression;
 it enjoyed a reputation of consistent opposition
 to the despised dictatorship;  and it faced bright
 prospects of advancing its national political status
 through orthodox political activity.   In August 1966
 the party,  although still legal, was politically
 ostracized--regarded generally as obstructive at
 best and subversive at worst.   Its national organ-
 ization was largely intact and retained at least. the
 nominal backing of the principal Communist rural. and
 paramilitary forces; but a pro-Peking faction had
 formally broken away in 1964, and much of the party's
 .youth following had been drained away to this and
 .other "ultraleft" factions advocating the via armada.
 After regaining legal status in 1957,  the PCC had
 firmly adhered to a program which placed primary
 emphasis on the via pacifica or mass struggle.   The
 party refused to alter this "soft line" in its funda-
 mentals, despite its long and pragmatic experience
 with guerrilla warfare and other rural violence in
 Colombia and despite. its influence over a number of
 active paramilitary forces in the countryside.   The
 party did make some adjustments after 1964 to enhance
 the role of the "armed struggle" in Colombia in an
 attempt to answer the criticism of the "ultraleft,"
 assume a more militant facade,  and undercut the dis-
 sidence within its own ranks.                             These modifications,
 which gave a stronger endorsement of the Communist-
 influenced paramilitary bands, were probably more a

 matter of shrewd semantics than a departure from
 the via Pacifica.
 The Communist main line of action throughout
 this period was toward the development of a "national
 patriotic front" in opposition to the National Front
 coalition government under which the traditional
 Liberal and Conservative Parties shared equally and
 exclusively in all elective and appointive offices.
 Communist success in undermining this "constitutional-
 ized" arrangement required that the party concentrate
 its resources and those of its pro-Communist allies
 in support of the strong but minority dissident fac-
 tion of the Liberals--the Liberal Revolutionary Move-
 ment  (MRL).   This defector organization was  just as
 determined after 1960 to disrupt the National Front
 as were the Communists.   This projected PCC-MRL
 alliance failed, however, because the moderate ma-
 jority faction of the MRL increasingly shunned overt
 cooperation with the Communists, and the old guard
 Communist leaders seemed to lack the flexibility and
 imagination to demonstrate to the skeptical "ultra-
 left" elements inside and outside the party the "cor-
 rectness" and efficacy of the via pacifica as a policy.
 The secession of the hard-liners in 1964 to form a
 pro-Peking rival party  (the PCC-ML)  contrasts with
 the experience of the Venezuelan Communist party which
 held together through 1965.
 The foreign influences on the party--essentially
 the same as those bearing upon the PCV--were inseparable
 from the domestic conflict over the via pacifica versus
 the via armada.   The example of the Cuban revolution
 and Cuban stimulation of the "ul-traleft" were partly
 responsible for the hard-liners'  attack on the PCC's
 via pacifica line, though Colombian public opinion
 was less stirred by the Cuban example than opinion in
 Venezuela.   Though both the PCC and the PCV were Mos-
 cow oriented, the Colombians gave the USSR their full
 support in the Sino-Soviet dispute while the Venezue-
 lans sought to avoid the issue under the guise of
 neutralism.   Moscow gave firm backing to the PCC'-s
 program,  including the attitude toward guerrilla war-
 fare; Moscow could also be credited with substantial
 indirect assistance to the PCC when Castro agreed,

 parties in late 1964, to coordinate his subversive
 efforts in the hemisphere through orthodox party chan-
 nels.   Peking's influence, on the other hand,  seems to
 have consisted of little more than providing ideologi-
 cal support for the Colombian hard-liners.
 No precise and definitive assessment is now pos-
 sible as to the relative weights of the foreign and
 domestic influences on the PCC over this nine-year
 period, but it certainly seems to have been domestic
 factors which were mainly responsible for the princi-
 pal development in party policy during 1966.   This
 was a tendency, reflected in the resolutions of the
 10th Party Congress and elsewhere, to give additional
 emphasis to the policy of the via armada in an apparent
 effort to recapture the leadership of the extreme left.

 I.  INTRODUCTION
 This study seeks to identify and evaluate the
 principal forces influencing the course of the
 Colombian Communist Party during the period from the
 fall of the Rojas Pinilla dictatorship in May 1957
 to the end of the Valencia administration in Au-
 gust 1966.   With this aim in view, the paper first
 examines the impact of domestic political events on
 the program of the PCC and then the relevant develop-
 ments in international Communism.
 In this examination it is useful to compare the
 PCC's experience with that of the Communist Party
 in adjacent Venezuela  (the PCV)  during the years which
 followed the ouster of the Perez Jimenez dictatorship
 in January 1958.*   Both parties emerged with legal
 status after a protracted period of suppression un-
 der authoritarian rule--a suppression much more severe
 in Venezuela, however, than in Colombia.   Perhaps un-
 til 1962 both parties had relatively bright prospects
 for improving their positions in national politics
 through ordinary political methods;  the Communist
 prospects in Venezuela seemed especially bright, partly
 because the prevailing political climate was more
 radical there than in Colombia.   But opportunities
 for Communist exploitation were plentiful in both
 countries,  as coalition regimes--with their inher-
 ent weaknesses--struggled to restore representative,
 constitutional government and cope with various eco-
 nomic and social problems left unsolved by the ousted
 dictators.
 The PCC and the PCV were each torn with internal
 dissension over the issue of whether to pursue power
 primarily by overt political action  (variously
 termed, in Latin American Communist parlance, the
 mass struggle, viarparliamentaria and via pacifica)
 or by revolution  (the armed struggle or lucha
 armada).   On this critical issue neither party
 followed a policy of complete consistency.   A

 variety of pressures and influences gradually led
 the PCV to choose the armed struggle, with em-
 phasis on guerrilla warfare after 1963, even
 though it had little experience in this tactic or
 capability for carrying it out.   On the other
 hand, the Colombian party,  in spite of its exten-
 sive experience and substantial assets for conducting
 guerrilla warfare, generally held to the via
 pacifica as the primary way to power.
 Both parties were traditionally oriented to-
 ward Moscow, yet they chose divergent paths in the
 Sino-Soviet dispute.   The Colombian party gave
 solid support to the USSR and the PCV took a neu-
 tral stand in an effort to reduce conflicts be-
 tween hard-liners and soft-liners within the party.
 Each party was subject to strong pressures to fol-
 low Cuba's revolutionary example--pressures of both
 a direct and an indirect nature,  since Castro's ap-
 peal to left-wing opinion in Venezuela,  and, to a
 lesser extent in Colombia, was one of the politi-
 cal facts of life in those countries.
 The Colombian party formally split in early
 1964, largely as a result of differences over
 domestic strategy and tactics, and,  to a lesser
 degree, over its stand in the Sino-Soviet dispute.
 The PCV maintained a facade of unity through 1965.

 II.  THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY IN NATIONAL POLITICS
 The position of the PCC has been much affected
 by Colombia's traditional two-party system of
 government  (now modified by the agreement for a
 bipartisan National Front)  and by the extensive
 rural violence which has troubled the country
 for nearly two decades.
 Since its formal establishment in 1930, the
 PCC has been severely limited in influence by this
 two-party system,  under which Liberals and Con-
 servatives have monopolized power by constitu-
 tional procedures throughout most of the 20th
 century.   The nominal membership of these two
 parties has included the vast majority of the
 people cutting across all class and regional
 lines of the country;  each,  in this sense, has
 been a truly national party.   Liberal and Con-
 servative affiliation, which is generally "in-
 herited" rather than based on clear ideological
 conviction,  approaches a kind of religious
 fervor,  sometimes transcending loyalty to the
 nation.   The political monopoly of the Liberal
 and Conservative parties explains in part the
 weakness of the Communist Party and other minor
 parties.
 Partisan attitudes caused a gradual breakdown
 of constitutional government in the late 1940s,
 marked particularly by the serious rioting in
 the capital in 1948  (the Bogotazo)  and the wide-
 spread rural strife known as la violencia which
 began after that date and still continues,  al-
 though greatly diminished since then.   This
 highly complex phenomenon of rural unrest can-
 not be attributed to any single cause; its geo-
 graphical centers have been continually shifting
 and much of the guerrilla activity has always
 been apolitical and little more than organized
 banditry.   During the years 1948-1953 rural vio-
 lence was largely motivated by the deep hostility
 between the Liberal and Conservative parties,
 including family and clan vendettas.   In subse-
 quent years,  the causes have been primarily eco-
 nomic and social,  including robbery,  land seizure,

 and protection racketeering among the peasantry.
 Banditry has become a full or part-time way of
 life for many of the elements participating.   How-
 ever, political motives are still present, and are
 seen especially in conflicts among local caudillos
 to maintain their spheres of dominance and in their
 determined efforts to block the re-establishment of
 departmental and central government authority.
 A number of peasant leaders in various parts of
 the country have been pro-Communist and in varying de-
 grees have followed the guidance of the party.   In
 some rural enclaves,  such as Viota and Sumapaz, Com-
 munist leaders have exercised direct control.   Some of
 the largest active or partly active guerrilla bands
 have been under the sway of Communist chieftains or
 tended to adhere to the party line.   In recent years,
 the party's role in violence has been publicized by
 government counterinsurgency campaigns which have con-
 centrated to a large degree on the centers of Commu-
 nist rural paramilitary strength.   The PCC, however,
 although consistently attempting to exploit la vio-
 lencia, has not been a key factor in promoting vio-
 lence.
 The PCC was outlawed during most of the dicta-
 torship of Rojas Pinilla  (1953-1957)  but regained
 its legal status under the provisional military
 junta  (1957-1958)  and seemed prepared to exploit the
 social, economic and political problems confronting
 the subsequent elected government--and in particular
 the weaknesses inherent in the newly devised National
 Front.
 Under this arrangement,  the two traditional
 parties agreed to share equally and exclusively all
 elective and appointive offices at local and national
 levels for sixteen years;  that is,  for four presiden-
 tial terms beginning in 1958 and ending in 1974.   The
 presidency was to be alternated between them every
 four years.   No one could hold any governmental ap-
 pointment without some acceptable version of the

 The National Front was born of a recognition by
 both the Liberals and the Conservatives that their
 deep-rooted animosities had to be bridled;  that
 they had to live together peacefully in order to es-
 tablish an effective,  stable administration and
 avoid another dose of dictatorial rule.   In many
 respects it appeared to be a plausible method for
 re-establishing representative government, restoring
 economic and political stability,  and implementing a
 bipartisan program to reduce rural violence.
 All other parties were frozen out by the National
 Front agreement.   The Communists, because of the gen-
 erally right-center orientation of the two major par-
 ties, were reduced largely to working with radical
 minority elements of the Liberal Party--including
 students and organized urban labor--to develop alli-
 ances which might exert a significant influence on
 national politics.   The Communists, nevertheless, de-
 rived certain opportunities from inherent weaknesses
 in the National Front.   The fundamental defect was
 that the Liberal Party clearly commanded a majority
 of the electorate,  and many Liberal elements were re-
 luctant or openly opposed to a self-denying bipartisan
 peace treaty.   Moreover,  the divisions existing within
 each of the traditional parties placed additional
 strains on the arrangement which the Communists were
 in a position to exploit.   The PCC apparently recog-
 nized that dissolution of the National Front might
 lead to military intervention, but thought there was
 a good chance that it would produce a new order in
 which Communists could participate directly and play
 a greater role in national politics.
 The National Front's weaknesses were apparent
 even before the inauguration of the first Liberal ad-
 ministration under Alberto Lleras Camargo in 1958,
 and in early 1960 the liberal Party split.   Alfonso
 Lopez Michelsen, son of a former president, es-
 tablished a strong, minority Liberal organiza-
 tion which eventually adopted the name Liberal
 Revolutionary Movement  (MRL).   At least until late
 1962 it was strongly pro-Castro in its leadership,
 anti-US in many of its policies,  favorable toward
 cooperation with the PCC in elections and other po-
 litical activity,  and adamantly opposed to the

 National Front.                 These policies,
 which paralleled those of the
 PCC,  suggested the makings of a
 powerful "national patriotic op-
 position front."   At the height
 of its power in 1962,  the MRL,
 with the backing of the Communist
 ana pro-Communist vote, was emerg-
 ing as a major challenge to the
 viability of the government coali-
 tion.   In this year, Lopez ran as
 a protest presidential candidate
 against Conservative Guillermo
 Leon Valencia and won almost one
 fourth of the total popular vote.
 in addition,  the MRL substantially
 increased its representation in
 Congress, many of these legisla-
 tive seats   being filled by Commu-
 nists and pro-Communists under the
 camouflage of the MRL label.

 tive Party proved to be an even          Leader of the MRL, the minority Liberal

 tiveness of the National Front. the PCC .
 The Conservativas,  traditionally
 hostile toward any kind of cooperation with the Com-
 munists, were even more seriously divided than the
 Liberals.   Actually, several autonomous organizations
 known as the Ospinistas, Laureanistas, Alzatistas,
 and Leyvistas--titles derived from the names of the
 principal leaders--were included under the Conserva-
 tive label.   After Rojas Pinilla returned to the coun-
 try                          (1958) and organized his followers under the Na-
 tional Popular Alliance  (ANP)  in 1961,  still another
 so-called "Conservative" faction entered the elec-
 toral lists.

 policies. The old guard leaders were products of the Stalin
 era but had little difficulty in giving lip service to
 denunciation of the "cu:Lt of personality" under the
 de-Stalinization program, while in fact carrying on
 party business as in the days of Stalin.   Gilberto
 Vieira White and his group had seized control of the
 party in 1947 from the then Secretary General, Au-
 gusto Duran--who, after his expulsion by Vieira,  formed
 a splinter party which has persisted in the region
 around Barranquilla but has never posed a serious threat
 to Vieira's leadership.   As Secretary General, Vieira
 was virtually unchallenged in his dictatorial control
 over party policy at least until the Sino-Soviet dis-
 pute became public and the Castro revolutionary ex-
 ample began to have an impact on Colombian radicals.
 A shrewd interpreter of the Colombian political
 scene, Vieira developed skill over the years as a
 party bureaucrat and manipulator of the Central Com-
 mittee.   In contrast to the party
 situation in neighboring Venezuela,
 Vieira's control faced no serious
 competition from younger dynamic
 leaders possessed of strong follow-
 ings within the party ranks and in-
 clined toward experimentation with
 radical programs.   Moreover, Vieira
 managed to avoid exile or imprison-
 ment, either of which would have
 paved the way for others to pre-empt
 his position.   His long tenure thus
 provided continuity of programs,
 but meant conservatism and even
 stagnation.   The clandestine opera-
 tions of the party had been limited
 and ineffective during the regime
 of Rojas Pinilla  (1953-1957)  and
 even the Communist guerrillas were
 used only to maintain the status
 quo in the areas where the party
 exercised strong influence,   such
 as Viota, Sumapaz and northern
 Tolima.   The objective of retain-
 ing legality was evidently a prime     Secretary General of the PCC, 1947-

 In its personal characteristics the CCP leader-
 ship had little to attract help from anyone outside
 the party who might be interested in disrupting the
 National Front.            At least to the Colombian public,
 the Communist leaders were notably lacking in dynamism,
 imagination and political opportunism;  they seemed con-
 tent to receive their modest stipends, occasional
 junkets to the bloc countries,  and such limited for-
 eign subsidies and other support as might fall to
 their lot.
 The principal Colombian Communist policy was
 a firm and unconditional advocacy of the primacy
 of the via pacifica, or p-arliamentary struggle. The
 party did accept the armed struggle under appropriate
 circumstances in designated local. areas, but dur-
 ing the late  '50s and early  '60s it insisted that
 the political consciousness of the worker class
 had not matured to the requisite level for launch-
 ing a general revolution.
 As the principal action for developing the party's
 mass strength, the PCC has on more than one occasion
 since 1957 called for the organization of a "great
 patriotic front of national liberation."   At the time
 the party reacquired legal status in 1957, Vieira in-
 sisted that Communists would have to emerge from their
 cocoon of isolation, cast off their dogmatic orienta-
 tion, and work with any group opposed to the National
 Front.   At the 9th Congress in 1961,  the party iden-
 tified the MRL as the principal vehicle for this pur-
 pose.
 On the critical issue of armed struggle the par-
 ty's statements up to 1965 were ambiguous and essen-
 tially semantic modifications of its traditional theme
 of "self-defense" by the peasant masses where justi-
 fied by the oppressive actions of the "oligarchic" se-
 curity forces.- In 1965, however, the PCC formulated
 what it claimed to be a unique policy which it hoped
 would satisfy those-who were clamoring for action and
 yet not risk the party's legal status.   The political
 resolution of the party's Tenth Congress in January
 1966 stated:
 In Colombia there is opening an original revo-
 lutionary way, based on the use of all methods

 and forms of mass struggle, combined according
 to concrete local and general conditions.   Peas-
 ant guerrilla war is one of the highest forms
 of mass struggle and only prospers and grows
 where it is linked with the masses.   At present,
 although peasant guerrilla war is not yet the
 principal form of struggle it is becoming more
 important every day.
 In this "unique policy," the PCC recognized
 that "the guerrilla movement forms a part of the
 combined political situation" and that "its perspec-
 tive should be analyzed in relation to this over-all
 situation."   The party further asserted that guer-
 rilla action "tends to promote and create certain sub-
 jective and indispensable factors for the emergent
 triumph of the revolutionary situation in Colombia."
 It defended its ancient policy of self-defense of the
 rural masses as "correct," and as having produced a
 "vigorous guerrilla movement wherever the official
 forces in cooperation with the Yankee military had
 waged war against the masses in the countryside."
 The PCC in National Politics After 1957
 When the PCC regained freedom to operate overtly
 in 1957, its political position and prospects were
 better than at any time in the past decade, but
 less favorable than the PCV's in Venezuela when the
 dictatorship was overthrown there.   Unlike their
 comrades in Venezuela in 1958, the Communists could
 take no credit for helping overthrow the hated author-
 itarian regime, and they were excluded from office
 by the provisions of the National Front.
 The party did have substantial support in the or-
 ganized labor movement, among university students, and
 in the various intellectual classes.   Even among the
 students, however,  the Communist potential was markedly
 less than in Venezuela, where the university popula-
 tion was concentrated in the strategically located
 Central University in Caracas.   Colombian students,
 being dispersed among a number of universities in
 Bogota and in provincial cities, have been more dif-
 ficult to organize for large-scale demonstrations and

 have been generally less inclined to challenge the
 government on purely political issues than students
 in various other Latin American countries.
 On the other hand, the party had one asset which
 was unique among all Latin American Communist organi-
 zations:   prolonged experience in rural violence  (la
 violencia)  and guerrilla warfare,  including a knowl-
 edge of the problems connected with coordinating
 scattered paramilitary groups of leftist and Commu-
 nist orientation.   However, not until Castro had demon-
 strated successfully the application of guerrilla war-
 fare methods in Cuba did this Communist paramilitary
 strength assume special significance in party eyes.
 Despite the many deficiencies in party think-
 ing, the serious domestic problems confronting the
 National Front and the divisions within that coali-
 tion gave the PCC a chance to expand its national
 influence.   In the MRL and the "national democratic
 front" the Communists had a promising means of ex-
 ploiting these divisions, and in 1960 they estimated
 their prospects for disrupting the traditional two-
 party system in Colombia to be the best in the entire
 history of the party.
 These prospects depended, however, on the main-
 tenance of a basic unity among a number of compet-
 ing leftist elements.   There was some reason for
 the PCC's optimism until the end of 1962, when
 serious dissension began to plague the MRL, and
 various pro-Communist leftist elements began to
 challenge the PCC's line on the viapaacifica.
 These elements were much influenced      Cuban de-
 velopments and by Chinese revolutionary ideology
 (as will be discussed later)  and with good reason
 the Communists publicly blamed the "Chinese party
 directors"--and privately the "Che Guevara fac-
 tion" of the Cuban regime--for provoking the at-
 tacks on the via pacifica which absorbed the party's
 attention.
 The dissension inside the MRL, partly attribut-
 able to the issue of armed struggle and indiredtly
 to foreign influence, was mainly caused by conflicting

 personal ambitions among the leaders.   One group,
 nominally a part of this maverick Liberal organization,
 was the undisciplined  "Youth of the MRL"  (JMRL),
 founded and led by ex-Communist Luis Villar Borda,
 who was a proponent of lucha armada for Colombia.
 Other pro-Castro MRL factions included the "hard-
 line" group of Alvaro Uribe Rueda and the clique
 of Camilo Aluma in Cali.
 But it was Lopez who held the support of the
 majority of the MRL after 1962.   He moderated the
 party's policies.   Among other things, he rejected
 Cuban-style revolution as applicable to Colombia
 and muted the party's pro-Castro propaganda output.
 More important, he shied away from entering into a
 formal alliance wit!. the PCC--as advocated by some
 radical elements in the MRL--although he did not
 eschew informal cooperation with the Communists or
 reject their electoral support.   (His influence on
 the FCC contrasted with that exerted by the princi-
 pal ally of the Communists in Venezuela, where the
 Castroite Leftist Revolutionary Movement  (MIR)  was
 more committed to the armed struggle than the PCV
 itself and pushed the PCV in that direction.)
 Lopez' position in refusing formal alliance with the
 PCC did, however, provide the pro-Chinese minority
 in the PCC with further ground for insisting that
 the via parliamentaria would never bring the Commu-
 nists to power in Colombia.
 The MRL, which had reached its high point in na-
 tional influence in the congressional and presidential
 elections of 1962,  fared very badly in the elections
 of early 1966--reflecting in part its internal dis-
 sension.   The majority Lopez faction of the MRL there-
 fore seriously considered returning to the regular
 Liberal party,  a move which would strengthen the Na-
 tional Front and the Liberal administration of Carlos
 Lleras Restrepo,  inaugurated in August 1966.   Since
 the Communist via parliamentaria was directly tied
 to the destinies of the MRL as an opposition party,
 the PCC prospects were similarly reduced to a new low
 by the 1966 election results--a decline which had
 been under way during the previous two years.   The
 PCC apparently had only limited influence remaining

 among some of the radical cliques of the MRL and
 their pro-Communist leaders.
 Relations with the Leftist Splinter Groups
 The Communists' problems were compounded by
 sterile battles with organizations which should
 logically have been natural allies in developing
 the united front tactic against the government.
 After 1958, a number of radical leftist groups
 of limited strength were formed in Colombia to
 promote urban and rural violence.   Most of them
 were inspired by the Castro revolution and the
 Chinese line on wars of national liberation;
 their leaders maintained liaison with the Cuban
 and Chinese governments and probably obtained
 some financial support in those capitals.   Some
 of these groups were led by apostate Communists
 --for example, Luis Villar, Alfonso Romero Buj
 and Pedro Abella Larotta--who, after being ex-
 pelled from the PCC, had siphoned off many Com-
 munist youths and sympathizers to build the new
 organizations.   They also occasionally attempted
 to recruit among pro-Communist guerrilla bands.
 The  PCC eventually branded most of these groups
 as "charlatans,  false revolutionaries, and ultra-
 leftists."
 The first of these subversive organizations
 to launch into the armed struggle was the Worker-
 Student-Peasant Movement  (MOEC),  initially or-
 ganized in early 1959 under another name.   Cuba
 supplied training for the key leaders and also
 some financial aid.   Antonio Larrota, one of the
 founders, had just returned from a long sojourn
 in Cuba as a revolutionary protege and agent
 of the Castro regime.   Eduardo Aristizabal and such
 other MOEC leaders as Eduardo Arismendi and
 Pedro Abella also found encouragement and
 sponsorship in Havana.
 The United Front for Revolutionary Action
 (FUAR)  likewise had the blessing of Castro, who
 sent it funds through Gloria Gaitan and Luis
 Emiro Valencia.   It was organized in early 1962

 by renegade Communists and native Marxists to
 promote the armed struggle, and tried to ab-
 sorb all the small revolutionary groups and to
 enlist some active guerrilla leaders under the
 FUAR banner.        These efforts were largely unproduc-
 tive, however, and most of the Cuban subsidies
 appear to have been squandered or to have been ap-
 propriated by the less idealistic members.   The
 FUAR dissolved itself in 1965.
 Like the MOEC and FUAR,  the National Liberation
 Army   (ELN) was inspired and financed in part by
 Havana.   The ELN,  initially the paramilitary arm
 of the Youth of the Liberal Revolutionary Movement
 (JMRL), has engaged in limited guerrilla action.
 It was responsible for the attack made in January
 1965 on the town of Simacota in northeastern
 Colombia--an attack which may have been directly
 financed by Cuba,  since the ELN
 leader, Fabio Vasquez,  is known
 to have been in Havana in late
 1964.
 The short-lived United Front,
 established in 1964 by the rene-
 gade Catholic priest Camilo Torres
 Restrepo to promote revolutionary
 change in Colombia, also seems to
 have been largely inspired by the
 Cuban example.   The United Front
 gained some popular support and
 hence received qualified endorse-
 ment from the PCC.   However,
 Torres was killed when his guer-
 rilla unit was engaged in action
 with Colombian military forces in
 early 1966.   His activities re-
 ceived extensive eulogies from the
 Cuban propaganda machine, includ-
 ing special praise.from Castro for

 The Split in the PCC
 The major blow to the PCC came when the party split
 in early 1964 over the armed struggle issue and the Sino-
 Soviet dispute.   The splinter party formed by the dis-
 sidents and expelled leaders called itself the PCC-
 Marxist-Leninist            (PCC-ML), thus laying claim to the
 mantle of "true" Colombian Communism.   This revolt
 cost the regular party prestige, the loss of a sub-
 stantial number of members--including many party
 youth--and disruption in its national organization.
 Although the PCC-ML attempted to proselytize
 among the pro-Castro revolutionary organizations,

 its inspiration and ideology were largely in-
 fluenced by China.                                     After the Havana Conference of
 Latin American parties in late 1964, at which Castro
 implicitly abandoned his "neutralism" in the Sino-
 Soviet dispute, the PCC-ML turned hostile toward the
 Cuban regime.   It alleged that the Cuban leader had
 fallen prey to the "revisionists," and had transformed
 himself into an enemy of "the working class and the
 Chinese people...and hence of the Communist parties
 of the world."
 Even the timing of the rift was tied to the de-
 bate over armed struggle. In one of its initial publi-
 cations, the PCC-ML denounced the old guard central
 committee leaders for not adequately supporting a
 major bastion of Communist guerrilla strength in
 Marquetalia,  after the government forces launched a
 sizable campaign there in May 1964 to eradicate sub-
 version.   The PCC-ML insisted that
 Marquetalia must be the beginning of the
 war of liberation in Colombia....   It is
 necessary to substitute the revolutionary
 principle of active guerrillas for the false
 and conservative principle of  'self-defense.'
 ...any peaceful method,  as a principal form
 of taking power, is definitely out of the
 question in Colombia; parliamentary and
 legal resources, together with other forms
 of mass struggle, can only be used as second-
 ary and complementary aspects of the principal
 form of struggle--the use of arms....   The na-
 tional leadership  [of the PCCI  is mistaken in
 its policy....
 The top leaders of the PCC closed ranks in the
 face of the party revolt,  and admitted that the ideo-
 logical roots of their problems "originated in the
 subjective concessions which the party has been mak-
 ing to those extremist tendencies of the so-called
 left."   They denounced local extremists and openly
 accused Peking of being the inspiration and major
 cause of dissension within the party.   But even though
 the split had come largely on the issue of the lucha

 armada, of which Castro was the best known Latin Ameri-
 can practitioner,                               the PCC leaders not only refrained
 from condemning the Castro regime for promoting revo-
 lutionary adventurism of the left, but actually praised
 the Cuban socialist experiment and its significance
 for the Communist movement in the hemisphere,  although
 they were rather noncommittal when relating the Cuban
 revolution to the armed struggle in Colombia.   This
 propaganda treatment of Cuba derived from the PCC
 leaders'  consciousness of Castro's ties with Moscow
 and of his appeal to various leftist elements in
 Colombia rather than from any possible enthusiasm of
 their own for imitating his rise to power.
 The PCC's extensive experience with guerrilla war-
 fare and the phenomenon of rural violence  (la violencia),
 and its involvement in various attempts to combine
 scattered guerrilla groups into a coordinated move-
 ment probably led to an awareness among the PCC lead-
 ership that Castro's guerrilla success was a product
 of unique conditions and circumstances rather than a
 universally applicable experience.   The decimation of
 the resources of the Venezuelan Communist Party and
 the Movement of the Revolutionary Left was additional
 confirmation of its belief.
 PCC antagonism toward the ultraleft promoters
 of the lucha armada was expressed frequently both
 before and after the party split.   While the PCC-ML
 was slinging epithets at the old Guard,  such as
 "Khrushchevist revisionists"--and raising Castro to
 the rank of "No.  1 Khrushchevist"--the PCC was de-
 nouncing the pro-Chinese as "anti-Soviet divisionists."
 The verbal conflict assumed some of the features of
 the Sino-Soviet dispute in a teapot, but was limited
 to the issue of armed struggle and particularly
 guerrilla warfare.
 The 10th Congress of the PCC in early 1966
 formally stigmatized the PCC-ML as "traitors who
 have deserted the great party and who pretend to
 carry out a revolution without a party,  a revolution
 without Marxism-Leninism.".  A key resolution of the
 Congress stated:

 The party must pursue its firm ideological
 struggle against the disastrous  'ultraleftist'
 tendencies, which are characterized by empty
 revolutionary phraseology without foundation
 in Colombian reality;  against the dogmatic
 thesis that the via armada is the only form
 of struggle worthy of revolutionaries,  ac-
 companied in practice by passive opportunism
 before Yankee imperialism and its oligarchic-
 militarist instruments;  against the depreciation
 of the just struggles for the worker masses and
 toward the political activities which can ad-
 vance them in overt and legal form.
 By Communist definition the "ultraleft" thus
 included not only the party traitors and defectors
 but the pro-Communist splinter groups seeking to
 launch the lucha armada.   Occasionally,  the PCC
 singled out specific names in its counterattacks
 against these groups,  always reserving special in-
 vective for the apostate Communists who went to
 Peking in search of aid.
 The renegade priest Camilo Torres was described
 more sympathetically by the PCC leadership, which,
 nevertheless, lamented his departure from the orig-
 inal parliamentary path of his United Front organi-
 zation to join the lucha armada--a departure made
 without "consulting  the PCC.   The sacrifice of his
 life in a guerrilla action "was a valiant and heroic
 deed, but this is not the principal form of struggle
 for the majority of the Colombian people."
 Criticism of "ultraleftists," however, has
 been muted since early 1966 as the PCC has been
 making tentative efforts to collaborate with and
 gain control over the violence-prone ELN and MOEC.
 In retrospect,  the Tenth Congress may have marked
 the beginning of a new PCC policy phase which will
 feature a somewhat greater emphasis on armed struggle
 without necessarily abandoning the over-all precepts
 of the via pacifica policy.

 III,  FOREIGN INFLUENCES ON THE PCC
 Varied foreign pressures on the PCC, when seen
 against the backdrop of domestic political factors,
 have also contributed to dissension in the party.
 The example of the Cuban revolution,  in combination
 with tangible Cuban aid for programs of violence,
 stirred the splinter groups of the "ultraleft" to
 actions which opposed the efforts of orthodox PCC
 leaders to promote the mass struggle through a national
 patriotic front.   These groups also found supplementary
 encouragement from Peking and,  at least until the PCC
 split and the Havana Conference of Latin American
 Communist parties in 1964,  the Cuban influence appar-
 ently acted as an indirect stimulus to the pro-Chinese
 hard-line elements within the PCC.
 Castroism and the PCC
 In many parts of Latin America the principal im-
 pact of the Cuban revolution was its provocative ex-
 ample for radical leftist elements.   Colombia was a
 special case,  ranking high on the Cuban priority list
 for external subversion, probably second on the South
 American continent only to Venezuela.   Moreover,  the ex-
 perienced Colombian guerrilla bands of Communist and
 pro-Communist orientation undoubtedly made the target
 more attractive to the Cubans.   Castro himself seemed
 to regard Colombia in a special way.   He had been in
 the country at the time of the bloody Bogotazo of April,
 1948 and was a personal friend of Gloria Gaitan,
 daughter of the leftist liberal leader Jorge Gaitan
 whose assassination had touched off the rioting.   Yet
 it was probably Che Guevara,  a principal architect of
 Cuban subversive policy in Latin America, who was
 largely responsible for Havana'a decision to circum-
 vent the PCC and turn to the militant leftist groups
 to promote rural and urban violence in Colombia.
 During the 1961-65 period, the MOEC,  FUAR,  ELN,
 and JMRL were the principal recipients of Cuban aid
 which was dispensed in a sporadic, poorly planned,  and
 largely ineffective manner.   Direct cash grants probably
 totaled less than $250,000 but political and guerrilla

 training, propaganda subsidies,  and travel for members
 of these organizations probably cost Cuba several times
 that amount.   In addition to tangible forms of aid,  all
 of these groups were the beneficiaries of stimulation
 and guidance from Cuba;  and sooner or later,  all of them,
 with the possible exception of the ELN,  fell out with
 the PCC over the latter's program of mass struggle.
 The PCC was well aware of Cuban relations with the
 leftist groups in Colombia.   Castro's cash grants to the
 FUAR,  for example, were public secrets in Colombia, only
 the specific sums being in doubt.   The PCC had good
 reason to resent this Cuban meddling deeply.   As
 previously noted,  Castro's aid went in many cases to
 men who had been expelled from the party.   In addition,
 the PCC feared the government might charge it with com-
 plicity in the subversive activities of these Cuban-sup-
 ported organizations and suspend its legal status.
 Nevertheless,  the PCC's public position toward
 Cuba,  as expressed in party statements and propaganda,
 was invariably eulogistic after 1959.   The Communist
 press in Colombia gave extensive coverage "in defense of"
 the Cuban revolution and government,  called for solidarity
 with Havana against the "imperialists," praised Castro's
 achievement as an example in the construction of social-
 ism,  and even acknowledged that Cuban experience had
 been incorporated into the tactics of the "self-defense"
 guerrilla organizations in Colombia.   The party probably
 spoke with greater sincerity in its repeated endorsements
 of the decisions taken at the Havana Conference,  at
 which the Cubans agreed to curb their scattered sub-
 versive efforts in Latin America and coordinate their
 activities through orthodox Communist channels.   The PCC
 gave similar unqualified approval to the Havana Tri-
 Continent Congress in early 1966 which called for active
 "solidarity" with Latin American revolutionary movements.
 Despite such public praise,  there nevertheless is
 reason to believe that the PCC was sharply critical and
 resentful of Castro's "extracurricular" subversive
 antics in Colombia.   Top PCC leaders in early 1964,
 when discussing the problems arising from the ultra-
 leftist groups which followed the "Cuban and Chinese
 lines," reportedly stated that the "Guevara faction"

 in Cuba openly backed revolution in Latin America
 through groups other than the Communist parties.   Pedro
 Abella of the MOEC and Luis Villar Borda of the JMRL,
 both ex-Communists, were pointed up as examples of ultra-
 left leaders who had used Cuban and Chinese aid to
 corrupt the Colombian Communist  Youth.   The PCC is
 reported to have sent a letter of protest on Abella's
 activities in Cuba and to have received a reply from the
 Cuban Communist Party promising appropriate action.   At
 about the same time,  the PCC--when answering a circular
 from the Brazilian Communists inquiring about attitudes
 on holding a Latin American Communist conference to dis-
 cuss the Sino-Soviet dispute--stated that it approved
 such a meeting but not in Cuba.   The PCC pointed out that
 participants in any meeting in Havana would be restricted
 in their discussion of "certain actions of Cuba" against
 other parties in the hemisphere.
 The PCC had learned, apparently just before
 sending this letter to the Brazilian comrades,  that
 Che Guevara had been disparaging its position and
 policies.   In a meeting with a Colombian Communist
 delegation in Havana,  also attended by ex-Communist
 Luis Villar Borda, Guevara reportedly had insisted
 that conditions were ripe for revolution in Latin
 America.   He noted, however,  that in many countries,  in-
 cluding Colombia,  the Communist Party was a hindrance
 to such a program; and he added that the PCC would lose
 popular support if it continued to act and think in a
 "passive" manner.
 After the Havana Conference of Latin American
 parties,  the Cuban regime apparently altered its sub-
 versive policies toward Colombia and conformed to its
 agreement to work through orthodox channels.   The Cuban-
 financed Simacota incident which occurred in January
 1965 seems to be an exception.   It was probably too
 well advanced to be stopped by the Cuban regime.   Mean-
 while, the ultraleftist Colombian leaders are believed
 to have lost their Cuban subsidies and other support.
 The Colombian Communists and the Cuban leaders also
 probably reconciled some of their differences on armed
 struggle in Colombia and discussed a coordinated approach
 to this facet of the PCC program at the Tri-Continent
 Congress in Havana early in 1966.

 There is some evidence that the rapprochement was
 based, at least in part, on the PCC's greater willingness
 to support armed action in Colombia beginning possibly
 in late 1965.   The Cuban Government has not abandoned
 its preference for the lucha armada in Colombia.   In
 his anniversary address on 26 July 1966, Castro praised
 the Colombian guerrilla movement and indirectly berated
 the PCC leadership and its policies.
 The extensive Cuban propaganda coverage on Colombia
 is almost entirely devoted to the Communist-influenced
 guerrilla bands and their activities.   For example,
 Havana radio disseminated the decisions of the "Second
 Conference of the Southern Guerrilla Bloc," which was
 held "somewhere in the forest"  in the spring of 1965.
 For its part,  the PCC has faithfully carried out
 the barqain reached at Havana in 1964, which required
 that the Latin American parties give ample expression of
 "solidarity" with the Cuban regime.   However,  solidarity
 is probably still defined by the party as it was when
 Secretary General Vieira wrote,  in an article  in
 Problems of Peace and Socialism in 1963,
 Our solidarity with Cuba can best be, shown
 by propaganda and explanation and carrying
 out extensive work among the masses to
 explain the results of the Cuban revolution.
 PCC-Soviet Relations and the Sino-Soviet Dispute
 The PCC has traditionally displayed an unconditional
 adherence to Moscow; hence,  its early endorsement of
 the Soviet position in the dispute with China merely
 reflected historical consistency.   The Colombian party's
 response included periodic homage to the Declarations
 of Moscow in 1957 and 1960,  recognition of the CPSU as
 the "vanguard of the Communist and working class move-
 ment," and ample condemnation of the "divisionist
 Chinese leaders."   The story is accurately and succinctly
 outlined in a TASS dispatch in early 1966, describing an
 interview between CPSU Central Committee Secretary Suslov
 and Colombian Secretary General Vieira:   "Once again
 the complete unity of views of the CPSU and the PCC was
 affirmed on the problems examined."

 Vieira has long been regarded by the Kremlin as
 one of the most trustworthy of the Latin American
 Communist leaders.  He has attended almost all CPSU
 congresses and other key international Communist meetings
 over the past several years,        including the Havana meeting
 of Latin American Communist parties in late 1964 and the
 subsequent gathering in Moscow.   He has made other
 special trips to the Soviet capital, presumably to coor-
 dinate PCC policy.   For example, he was reportedly there
 in August 1964 at the time when the party had split
 and the pro-Chinese elements were organizing the
 PCC-ML.   Other PCC leaders,  such as the late Filiberto
 Barrero and Jose Cardona Hoyos, have also been held in
 high regard by the Kremlin.
 In the Sino-Soviet dispute,  the Colombian party held
 firmly to the Soviet line in contrast to the evasive
 "neutralism" of the generally pro-Soviet party in Vene-
 zuela.   The PCC gave unqualified and regular praise to
 the CPSU as the vanguard of the international movement,
 the savior of world peace, the defender of peaceful co-
 existence, and the genuine fount of Marxism-Leninism.
 It just as consistently upbraided the "Chinese leaders"
 with such epithets as divisionists,  schismatics, tools
 playing into the hands of the imperialist camp, ex-
 porters of artificial revolution,  and Maoist deifiers.
 The PCC's formal commitment to the CPSU side came
 at the 9th Congress in 1961 and was reiterated at the
 10th Congress in early 1.966. Similar resolutions re-
 affirming this position were adopted at various inter-
 vening plenums of the central committee.   In addition,
 the party followed the Soviet lead at international
 meetings,  such as those held in Moscow in 1957 and 1960
 and at the East German Party Congress in Berlin in 1963.
 In return for the PCC's stand on the Sino-Soviet
 dispute, the CPSU has backed the PCC in such propa-
 ganda media as TASS, Novosti, Radio Moscow, Pravda,
 and Izvestia.   Ample space has also been allotted to the
 Colombian party in Problems of Peace and Socialism.
 Vieira's speech at the 23rd CPSU Congress of March
 and April 1966 was well publicized.   At that time, he
 lauded the CPSU as the builder of socialism and peace-
 ful coexistence and the defender of "world peace."   He

 then outlined the decisions of the 10th PCC Congress
 indicated that "a new and original revolutionary" path
 was opening up in Colombia, based on the use of all
 forms and methods of struggle of the masses,  among
 them armed struggle.   But he admitted that the struggle
 would be "long and arduous" and that the PCC "cannot
 conquer a still strong and cruel enemy with mere ultra-
 revolutionary phrases."   Acknowledging the CPSU as
 "the vanguard detachment of the international movement,"
 and "the glorious Cuban revolution as our greatest
 stimulus," he then denounced "the stubborn campaigns to
 downgrade the indestructible work of the Soviet power
 and the schismatic maneuvers against the Communist inter-
 national movement."
 Relations With Peking
 The militant Chinese advocacy of wars of national
 liberation was an inspiration and moral comfort to the
 various elements both inside and outside the PCC who
 insisted on the armed struggle.   After 1961 when the PCC
 had unequivocally sided with Moscow in the Sino-Soviet
 dispute, the party's problems with the pro-Chinese ele-
 ments began to multiply, particularly when the latter
 began to seek material aid and guidance from China. The
 attitude of the radicals within the party is clearly
 reflected in a letter to the central committee written
 by Carlos Arias, a former candidate member who had been
 expelled from the party in 1963 and was later a top
 leader of the PCC-ML.   Arias denounced the party's
 arbitrary handling of
 The  Sino-Soviet  problem which you /the
 central committee] had tried to conceal
 against all evidence;...the treason which you
 will commit by supporting nonrevolutionaries
 in the coming elections;....History will
 decide who and how many are to blame for
 delaying the Colombian revolution and who
 scourged the revolutionaries of the PCC.

 revolution and the Chinese leaders; WF1o in-
 sults the revolution and the Cuban leaders;
 who refers to Venezuelan revo a onariiees as

 adventurers;  and who insults the real
 Colombian revolutionaries.*
 Arias further noted that the central committee had not
 only expelled him from the party but,  in the same session,
 had also "condemned Mao Tse-tung and the Chinese revolu-
 tion.   This is a splendid task which North American
 imperialists are probably applauding."
 The Chinese sought to inspire
 the ultraleftist groups and the
 dissident elements within the PCC
 in an attempt to promote the armed
 revolution in Colombia and to un-
 dercut the policies and prestige
 of the orthodox party.   Travel of
 pro-Chinese leaders to Peking was
 heavy and included representatives
 of the MOEC,  FUAR,  JMRL,  and the
 PCC-ML.   Pedro Abella,  Luis Villar
 Borda, Leon Arboleda, Pedro Vas-
 quez Rendon, Eduardo Aristizabal,
 and Manuel Manotas Manotas were
 among those who went to China dur-
 ing the years 1963-65 to present
 their plans `to the Chinese and to
 obtain assistance and guidance.
 After the PCC-ML was formed in
 1964, however, the Chinese appar-
 ently limited their paramilitary
 training, financial aid,  and other
 support primarily to this organ-
 ization and to the MOEC.

 ers in Colombia seems to have
 been niggardly.       Although some
 of the travelers to Peking may
 have received small cash grants,  the one regular
 source of financing has been through the NCNA agency
 in Bogota.   The amounts paid in salaries and for
 other services to the local Communist NCNA representa-
 tives are not believed to exceed $150 per month.

 Although the PCC attempted to prohibit the dissemina-
 tion of Chinese propaganda in Colombia after 1963 and
 expelled the pro-Chinese NCNA employees from the
 party,    the latter still retain their agency posi-
 tions and apparently still receive the small monthly
 payments.   There is some ground for considering the
 PCC-ML to be a poorly disciplined party, not in close
 touch with Peking, since its two factions have con-
 tended for control of the NCNA agency and the agency
 has remained independent of both.
 Peking's promises to its sympathizers in Colombia
 for propaganda support, scholarships, paramilitary
 training, and other assistance have probably been far
 more lavish than the actual cash outlays.   Peking has
 disseminated sporadic propaganda in support of the PCC-
 ML, branding the "orthodox" leaders "revisionists" and
 endorsing the "revolutionary struggle to seize power
 through a patriotic anti-imperialist popular
 revolution...."   The Chinese have also financed guerrilla
 warfare training and "scholarship" programs,  reportedly
 in North Korea and Vietnam as well as in China.
 The PCC response to Chinese collaboration with
 its enemies has been sharp.   Top central committee mem-
 bers, well aware of the travels to Peking of such
 "traitors" as Pedro Abella (and the purpose of such
 pilgrimages),  are known to have discussed in early 1964
 the pressures and problems which such activities were
 placing on the party.   Besides trying to stop Chinese
 propaganda emanating from the NCNA office in Bogota,  the
 PCC also attempted to stifle party discussion of the
 Chinese line and of Peking's position in the Sino-So-
 viet dispute.   Chinese sympathizers were threatened
 with expulsion.
 Whether Vieira and his colleagues exaggerated
 the Chinese responsibility for the PCC's internal prob-
 lems is debatable, but they certainly sought to link
 the pro-Chinese dissidents with the "ultraleft charla-
 tans" who insisted on immediate revolution in Colombia.
 Vieira wrote in 1965 that such groups had seized upon
 the false and misleading Chinese position to attack the
 PCC and its program.

 The PCC's general sensitivity to the effects
 of the party split was illustrated by its sharp re-
 sponse to a September 1964 article in El Tiem~ oo,
 the leading daily of Bogota, which had described
 the expulsion of leaders from the party, the splits
 in regional Communist committees, and the disinte-
 gration of the PCC organization.   In its rebuttal
 in Voz Proletaria, the party insisted that the great
 majority of members had remained loyal to the ortho-
 dox PCC, attacked "the methods of the Chinese lead-
 ers" and charged that the principal objective of
 the deviationist "ultrarevolutionaries" was to at-
 tack the PCC rather than the true enemies--"the
 reactionary national forces and Yankee imperialists."

 IV.  ASSESSMENT
 During the period under review  (May 1957 -
 August 1966)  the PCC managed to maintain its legal
 status and the unity of the old-line leaders headed
 by Vieira.   It kept the party organization intact
 and retained the loyalty of the majority of the
 rank and file membership as well as its influence
 over traditional rural enclaves and the principal
 pro-Communist paramilitary leaders in the country-
 side.   The close ties with the Soviet party were
 challenged only by a few defectors.
 Balanced against these accomplishments, which
 were largely holding operations, are the substantial
 reverses to Communist strength and potential in com-
 parison to the party's outlook as late as 1962.   The
 program failed to prevent an internal split or to
 satisfy the demands of the radical leftist groups
 who were inclined to pursue the armed struggle.
 During this period, foreign and domestic in-
 fluences on the party were intertwined and, of course,
 reacted on each other.   No firm conclusions are pos-
 sible about their relative weights.   Nevertheless,
 the developments rehearsed in this paper do suggest
 certain very tentative generalizations on how these
 influences have operated in the case of the Colombian
 party.
 The PCC was run throughout this period by an old
 guard leadership whose own inclinations--particularly
 on the key issue of the armed struggle--seem to have
 accorded fairly well with the Moscow line;  if Moscow
 had favored intensifying the armed struggle,  there
 might have been some test of their allegiance.   The
 party's formal split in 1964 over the Sino-Soviet
 dispute of course reflected its previous support of
 Moscow's side in international Communist meetings,
 as contrasted with the "neutralist" position taken
 by the Venezuelan Communist party; but it also prob-
 ably reflected somewhat less flexibility in the PCC
 leadership at dealing with party dissension.   The PCV,

 No Foreign Dissem
 plagued with more serious internal conflict over the
 armed struggle issue, did stay together through 1965.
 The Cuban influence on the PCC was indirect and
 in one sense more a domestic influence than a for-
 eign one,  in that it had a strong appeal  (though, as
 time went on, a diminishing one)  to the radical leftist
 opinion in Colombia, and Havana subsidized to some ex-
 tent the splinter groups which competed with the PCC
 for leftist support.   This situation was reflected in
 the PCC's attitude toward the Castro regime. The PCC
 split in 1964 came largely over the issue of the armed
 struggle, of which Fidel Castro was the hemisphere's
 leading exponent, but it was Peking that was publicly
 blamed by the PCC leadership; Cuba, both on that oc-
 casion and subsequently, was praised.   Castro's known
 alignment with Moscow would of course have made it
 embarrassing for the PCC to be publicly critical of
 him, but his Moscow tie did not prevent the PCC from
 being critical of his regime in a 1964 communication
 to Brazilian Communists.
 The extent of Peking's actual influence in Co-
 lombian Communist circles has been very small, despite
 the readiness of the proponents of the armed struggle
 to invoke Chinese ideological support.
 Domestic, rather than foreign,  factors seem to
 have been mainly responsible for the principal 1966
 development in PCC policy:   a reappraisal of party
 policy on the lucha armada in an apparent effort to
 recapture the leadership of the extreme left through
 more tangible support and guidance for the guerrilla
 forces.   The propaganda facet of this modified policy
 appeared in the resolutions of the 10th Party Con-
 gress, which recognized that the armed struggle was
 the "principal form" in certain local areas and that
 guerrilla warfare had reached a "new stage" of de-
 velopment.   It is similarly reflected in the PCC's
 formation in 1966 of the Colombian Revolutionary Armed
 Forces (FARO), a "general staff" for coordinating rural
 Communist subversion;  the FARC has issued an open in-
 vitation to membership for all leftist guerrilla ele-
 ments, active or in process of being organized.   The
 reported Communist liaison with the ELN and the favor-
 able Communist attitude toward this organization's

 guerrilla activity also suggest increased emphasis by
 the PCC on this aspect of its program.   In addition,
 there is evidence of closer cooperation between the
 PCC and the Cuban regime since the Havana Conference
 in late 1964 and particularly since the Tri-Continent
 Congress in early 1966,  as partly revealed in Cuban
 and Colombian propaganda and in the appointment of
 Central Committee member Manual Cepeda Vargas as
 permanent PCC representative in Havana.
 The changes of early 1966 probably do not add
 up to a basic shift in the PCC's long adherence to
 the primacy of the via Pacifica, but they do suggest
 a greater sensitivity to domestic pressures and
 possibly some increased tactical flexibility.
