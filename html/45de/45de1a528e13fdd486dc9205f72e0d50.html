 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 EAST-WEST RELATIONS .       .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 1
 Khrushchev's ambiguous remarks on Germany and Berlin
 in his Djakarta press conference on 29 February did not
 if fact modify his previous statements on these subjects
 which have carefully avoided directly linking a threat to
 sign a separate treaty with the outcome of the summit
 meeting in May.  His deliberate ambiguity was apparently
 designed to elicit the Western press speculation that So-
 viet action is dependent on the summit results.  Moscow's
 strong reaction to reports that the United States would
 resume flights in the Berlin air corridors above 10,000
 feet suggests that the Soviet leaders view this as an op-
 portunity to test Western unity in the pre-summit period
 and, if possible, inject the East Germans into technical
 discussions on flight procedures.
 KHRUSHCHEV CONTINUES TOUR OF ASIA   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 4
 Although both Premier Khrushchev and President Sukarno
 reportedly were disappointed in the reception given Khru-
 shchev in Indonesia, his visit ended in an atmosphere of
 harmony.    The joint statements signed at the conclusion
 gave the Soviet leader material for his propaganda mills
 and assurances that Indonesia will continue its policy of
 nonalignment.   In return, Khrushchev offered a $250,000,000
 credit and Soviet support for Indonesia's claims to West
 Irian.  En route from Indonesia to Afghanistan, the last
 country on his four-nation tour, Khrushchev stopped for
 talks with Nehru in Calcutta.

 Tensions between the UAR and Israel have eased some-
 what the past week, but a modified military alert is still
 in effect on both sides.   Israeli officials have been in
 Paris attempting to obtain additional military equipment;
 they also plan to go to Britain
 The emigration of Rumanian Jews to Israel, which
 previously exacerbated relations between the Arab states
 and the bloc, has been quietly renewed.  At the recently
 concluded Arab League meeting in Cairo, Jordan maintained
 complete opposition to a UAR-backed proposal to create a
 Palestine state and army.   In Iraq, Prime Minister Qasim
 has assumed the role of patron of the Iraqi Peace Partisans,

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 LARGE COMMUNICATIONS TOWER COMPLEX IN EAST GERMANY  .  .  .  .   Page 1
 Masonry towers to house electronics equipment have
 been constructed at 63 locations in East Germany and more
 are being built.  These towers, one purpose of which is to
 expand conventional telephone, telegraph, and broadcast
 services, apparently are to be used by four regime organi-
 zations, including the Ministry of Defense.  The military
 may use some of these towers for transmitting radar signals
 for air defense and command and control signals for guided-
 missile purposes.
 POLISH WORKER DISCONTENT BECOMING MORE WIDESPREAD   .  .  .  .  Page 3
 Worker discontent in Poland is growing as the regime
 carries out its policy aimed at stepping up industrial
 production with only minor increases in the labor force.
 Sporadic work stoppages have already taken place in sev-.
 eral industrial areas;   these have been brought under con-
 trol by the threat of punitive measures, including dis-
 missals and blacklisting.  Unrest is likely to become
 more serious, as workers in several key industrial estab-
 lishments in Poznan are reported to have met to decide on
 a coordinated protest against wage cuts resulting from
 higher work norms.
 COMMUNIST CHINA SPEEDS CONSTRUCTION IN ELECTRIC POWER
 INDUSTRY .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  3
 Communist China is making a major effort to expand
 its electric power industry.  Progress in power-plant
 construction during the past two years has reflected this
 new emphasis, and China's generating capacity and output
 of electricity in 1959 were almost twice the 1957 levels.
 The present tempo of construction can be expected to bring
 roughly another doubling by 1962.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 PART II (continued)
 the campaign is a renewed emphasis on "the thought of Mao
 Tse-tung" as the motivating force behind the "leap forward."
 The forthcoming joint meeting of the National People's
 Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's
 Political Consultative Committee will provide an opportu-
 nity for launching a new drive for greater communalization
 and for consolidating the theoretical foundation of  the
 "leap forward."  Moscow has been reluctant to acknowledge
 the "thought of Mao Tse-tung" as a contribution to Marxism-
 Leninism and will find these renewed claims unpalatable.
 CHOU EN-LAI ACCEPTS NEW DELHI AS SITE FOR TALKS WITH
 NEHRU   .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .   Page 7
 Chou En-lai seems intent on convincing Nehru and the
 Indian public that agreement can be reached on principles
 and procedures for settling the border dispute.      Chou's
 letter on 26 February accepting New Delhi as the site for
 talks with Nehru in April was conciliatory and seemed in-
 tended to lend credibility to Peiping's oft-stated readi-
 ness to negotiate a "friendly" settlement.  Nehru has wel-
 comed Chou's decision, although he reportedly expects no
 tangible results from the meeting
 ea ers pro a  y w     a  emp    o gauge eac other's com-
 mitment to territorial claims and create a favorable cli-
 mate for further discussions.
 ELECTORAL PREPARATIONS IN LAOS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 8
 The government of Laos is making some progress in
 preparing for the parliamentary elections scheduled for
 24 April.  Gerrymandering of electoral districts to mini-
 mize Communist capabilities is nearly completed, and the
 regime is attempting to develop a single slate of govern-
 ment-approved candidates.  There now are indications that
 the Communist-front Neo Lao Hak Sat may decide to present
 candidates before the 9 March filing deadline.
 Communist insurgent influence and
 activity are more widespread than the government admits,
 and in large areas of the countryside, the insurgents may
 be in a position to disrupt the elections or intimidate
 the populace.
 RATIFICATION OF US-JAPANESE SECURITY TREATY STALLED

 Prime Minister Kishi's Liberal-Democratic party, have been

 minister into a rash move which would arouse public opin-
 ion against him and the treaty.  Kishi has been confident
 that procrastination by the Socialist opposition would
 overtax public patience and enable him to secure Diet rati-
 fication in May, but attempts by his intraparty rivals to
 make  his  resignation the price of their support could lead

 Prime Minister Ahidjo, having secured endorsement of
 his draft constitution in the popular referendum held on
 21 February, has set 10 April as the date for legislative
 elections which will determine the character of the govern-
 ment to succeed Cameroun's present transitional regime.                                       In
 an effort to ease the country's tense political situation,
 he has also legalized the Union of the Cameroons Population
 (UPC), the militant nationalist party banned by the French              25X1
 in 1955.  At the same time, local and reinforced French
 forces are stepping up military operations a     s  UPC ex-
 tremists and other rebels in the southwest.
 MOROCCAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .   Page 11
 The earthquakes at Agadir apparently have delayed the
 pending cabinet reorganization in Morocco.    King Mohamed V,
 who usually moves with caution, is reported to have ac-
 cepted the resignation of Premier Abdullah Ibrahim and to
 be about to name Si Mohamed M'Barek Bekkai to head another
 caretaker government which would serve until after elec-
 tions in May.   These elections, the first to be held in
 Morocco, should provide more reliable information on the
 distribution of party strength throughout the country.
 FRANCE-ALGERIA .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 12
 Algerian rebel chief Ferhat Abbas' 29 February pro-
 nouncement on conditions for a cease-fire has been gener-
 ally well received in France, where renewed hope of a
 settlement based on self-determination will probably re-
 vive speculation on the possibility of early formal
 meetings.  The two sides remain far apart, however, on
 whether discussions of political guarantees will be in-
 cluded in cease-fire talks.  On his current tour of French
 military field installations in Algeria, De Gaulle is prob-
 ably trying to gauge army opinion on the aftermath of the
 January insurrection and on new moves toward self-determin-
 ation.

 PART II  (continued)
 CABINET MAKING IN ITALY         .  . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 13
 While negotiations to replace the Segni government
 are only in their initial stages, the. outlines of Christian
 Democratic strategy are beginning to emerge.                  As indicated
 by the program adopted by the party's national directorate
 on 27 February, the Christian Democrats appear to be work-
 ing toward a coalition with the Democratic Socialists and
 Republicans, and depending on the parliamentary abstention
 of the Nenni Socialist party.
 ANGLO-GERMAN RELATIONS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 15
 The latent ill feeling between Britain and West Ger-
 many has again been stirred up by Bonn's moves to obtain
 military facilities in Spain.      This British criticism of
 this move, following closely the London press campaign
 over anti-Semitic incidents in West Germany, has in turn
 raised German resentment to a postwar high.  The British
 Government is increasingly reluctant to permit German
 military power to exceed the restrictions in' the 1954
 Western European Treaty, and this attitude is likely to
 be accentuated by the public indignation over the Spanish -
 West German talks in Madrid.
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 TRANSPORTATION IN THE SOUTHEAST COASTAL AREA OF CHINA   .  .  Page 1
 The railroads built in the last few years in the
 Fukien coastal area of Communist China, opposite Taiwan,
 now are the most important means of transport serving the
 economic and military needs of the area.  They appear ade-
 quate to support present levels of economic activity and,
 together with lines now under construction, projected
 levels.  They are also providing improved logistic sup-
 port to the armed forces in the area.  The highways and
 waterways of the area, while decreasing in importance, are
 still major traffic arteries in many localities and are
 being improved.  Timber is the principal product moving
 out of Fukien, while shipments of a military nature make
 up an important part of incoming goods.
 NATIONALIST CHINA'S TAIWANESE PROBLEM   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 5
 The Chinese Nationalist Government during the last
 three years has shown growing concern over relations be-
 tween the native Taiwanese and Chinese mainlanders on
 Taiwan.   This concern stems partly from demands for

 political rights by the Taiwanese, who constitute the
 majority of the island's population, and partly from the
 induction into the armed forces of greater numbers of
 Taiwanese, who cannot share the mainlanders' desire to
 return to the mainland.   If mainlander liberal elements
 and Taiwanese leaders unite on demands for political and
 economic reforms, Chiang Kai-shek may be forced to place
 emphasis on economic development on the island at the
 expense of the military organization.
 EFFECTS OF SPAIN'S ECONOMIC STABILIZATION PROGRAM   .  .  .  .  Page 7
 The economic stabilization program inaugurated in
 July 1959 has put a brake on Spain's inflation and mark-
 edly improved its balance-of-payments position.  This
 achievement and the recent increase in Franco's interna-
 tional prestige have strengthened the regime's position
 and discouraged opposition elements.   Influential cabinet
 ministers, however, oppose some of the program's measures
 for achieving economic expansion.  Production levels re-
 main low and workers are restless, fearing a worsening
 unemployment situation.
 WESTERN AID TO LESS-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 10
 Western nations are seeking to coordinate their capi-
 tal exports in order to increase the effectiveness of free-
 world aid to less-developed countries.  Although such free-
 world economic assistance is estimated to exceed $5 billion
 annually--considerably more than the cumulative total of
 bloc economic and military aid from 1954 to date--its ef-
 fectiveness in East-West competition is greatly impaired
 by lack of coordinated direction and insufficient long-term
 financing.  A meeting of eight capital exporting nations
 beginning on 9 March will consider, among other aspects of
 the problem, methods to coordinate financial contributions
 for  riorit  assistance to such countries as India.
 SLOVAKIA'S AUTONOMY GRADUALLY DISAPPEARING .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 12
 Slovakia's long-standing semiautonomous position
 within the Czechoslovak state has recently been weakened
 by Prague's moves downgrading administratively Slovakia's
 capital, Bratislava, and curtailing the Slovak party's
 control over its own party press and over other Slovak-
 language publishing activities.  Although the strength of
 Slovak separatism compels Prague to proceed with caution,
 the regime has apparently embarked on a program to liqui-
 date within the next few years the autonomous status of
 this fiercely nationalistic region.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 'rhrushchev's ambiguous re-
 marks on Germany and Berlin in
 his Djakarta press conference
 on 29 February did not in fact
 modify his previous statements
 on these subjects,which have
 carefully avoided directly link-
 ing a threat to sign a separate
 treaty with the outcome of the
 summit meeting in May.   His de-
 liberate ambiguity was apparent-
 ly designed to elicit the West-
 ern press speculation that Soviet
 action is dependent on the sum-
 mit results.   Moscow's strong
 reaction to reports that the
 United States would resume flights
 in the Berlin air corridors
 above 10,000 feet suggests that
 the Soviet leaders view this as
 an opportunity to test Western
 unity in the pre-summit period
 and,  if possible,  inject the
 East Germans into technical dis-
 cussions on flight procedures.
 In contrast to such psycho-
 logical warfare maneuvers to
 generate a sense of urgency in
 the West regarding the import-
 ance of preventing a failure
 of the summit meeting, other
 statements by the Soviet premier
 in Indonesia reaffirmed his
 interest in maintaining personal
 contacts with Western leaders.
 His joint statement with Presi-
 dent Sukarno noted that the
 May conference would be the first
 of a series of such meetings.
 He told his press conference
 that although one meeting could
 not deal with all the issues
 under dispute,  the May session
 would "make a good start."          25X1
 The confusion in press
 accounts of Khrushchev's state-
 ment arose from the fact that
 his reference to the USSR's in-
 tention to conclude a separate
 treaty occurred at the end of
 a passage which opened with a
 reference to the forthcoming
 summit talks.   Soviet leaders
 frequently resort to this device
 of calculated ambiguity when
 they wish to create an impression
 abroad that some drastic unilateral
 action is imminent without
 actually committing the USSR
 to take such action.   This tech-
 nique was employed effectively
 during the Suez crisis'of 1956
 and the Syriar crisis- in 1956
 and 1957.

 an official T S  statement on
 25 February - seized  on
 the announcement of   the West
 German    and Spanish military
 talks to  allege  that Bonn's
 policies "involuntarily bring
 to mind the military alliance
 of Hitler and Franco." Stress-
 ing that the Soviet Government
 has  constantly  warned  about
 the "sinister danger of German
 militarism," the statement con-
 cluded by declaring that this
 collusion with Spain, aimed at
 obstructing an East-West agree-
 ment, "again underlines  the
 urgent need for a peace settle-
 ment with Germany."
 Moscow's prompt and strong
 reaction to press reports that
 the United  States will resume
 flights in the Berlin air cor-
 ridors above 10,000 feet sug-
 gests that the Soviet leaders
 view this as an opportunity to
 test Western unity in the pre-
 summit period and, if possible,
 inject the East Germans into
 any technical discussion on
 flight procedures.
 The warning by  a Soviet
 spokesman in East Berlin that
 flights above 10,000 feet, in
 the    absence  of an agreement
 with  both  the USSR' and 'East
 Germany, would be regarded as
 a "unilateral violation of East
 German  air sovereignty" and
 existing four-power agreements
 probably is aimed at  inducing
 the Western powers to postpone
 such flights and agree to tech-
 nical discussions on flight
 procedures with East German
 participation. Moscow will
 probably attempt to increase
 pressure for negotiations, as
 it did in 1959, by hinting
 that possible "incidents" might
 result.   On the flights in the
 spring of 1959, American C-130s
 were harassed by Soviet  air-
 craft.
 The impasse over the new
 passes for the Allied Military
 Liaison  Missions  accredited
 to the Soviet forces  in  East
 Germany continues.   The Soviet
 Union has not yet replied to
 the Western protest notes de-
 livered to the Soviet commander
 in East Germany on 19 February,
 which contended that the passes
 violated the 1947 agreement
 setting up the missions.
 Privately, however,   the
 Soviet officials have continued
 to minimize the problem,  insist-
 ing that the passes are normal
 administrative action and     do
 not constitute  recognition of
 East Germany.   Soviet mission
 officials in Frankfurt took
 this approach with American
 army officers.  They asserted
 that the passes are really not
 new but merely recognize a
 historical fact.
 New officers assigned to
 the Soviet mission in Baden-
 Baden indicated  that  they
 planned to be in West Germany
 a long time, suggesting that
 they do not anticipate that
 the missions will be withdrawn
 soon.   This pose, however, may
 have been intended to suggest
 Soviet confidence that the West-
 ern reaction to the new passes
 is temporary.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Western Positions
 The Macmillan government,
 in keeping with its disinclina-
 tion to disturb the atmosphere
 of detente during the pre-summit
 period, has opposed several
 measures taking a firm line to-
 ward the USSR and East Germany.
 While agreeing to a joint policy
 with the United States and France
 to curtail visits by high-level
 East Germans to the West,  London
 has issued a visa to the head of
 the East German news agency
 as the first exception to the
 new agreement.  In discussions
 in Bonn, British diplomats left
 the definite impression that
 the Home Office in London,
 which actually issues the visas,
 does not consider the agreed
 policy as necessarily binding.
 London argued for some time
 against early action in sending
 in high-altitude flights through
 the corridors to Berlin, and has
 shown a willingness to go along
 with new passes for its Military
 Liaison Missions at Potsdam.  In
 opposing changes in Western pro-
 cedures on approving flights to
 the Leipzig Fair, London again
 has shown its disinclination to
 "rock the boat" before the sum-
 mit.
 Chief Soviet delegate
 Tsarapkin continued his efforts
 last week to focus negotiations
 at the nuclear test cessation
 talks on the 16 February Soviet
 proposal, under which the USSR
 would accept "temporary" stand-
 ards for sending out on-site in-
 spection teams,  provided the
 West agrees to Khrushchev's
 plan for a fixed annual quota
 of inspections. He asserted on
 29 February that the Soviet pro-
 posal "clarified" the problem
 before the negotiations--agree-
 ment in principle to a quota,
 followed by settlement on a spe-
 cific number of inspections "on
 the basis of rational political
 compromises." Tsarapkin pointed
 out that agreement "in princi-
 ple" would not mean acceptance
 of any specific quota figures.
 In an effort to exploit
 possible differences between
 the Western delegations, he
 recalled Prime Minister Mac-
 millan's "position on the quota"
 and urged the British delegate
 to join him in trying to "con-
 vince" the American delegate
 to accept the quota concept "in
 principle."
 While avoiding any mention
 of a specific quota level,
 Tsarapkin again claimed that
 a "small number of inspections
 would be sufficient" to deter
 any would-be violator of a test-
 ban treaty.   He denied that the
 Soviet proposal implied an ad-
 mission that many seismic events
 were unidentifiable without on-
 site inspection and reaffirmed
 the USSR's position that a
 large majority of events could
 be identified as earthquakes at
 the control posts.
 The Soviet delegate also
 continued to reject the American
 insistence on relating the size
 of the inspection quota to an
 estimate of the number of prob-
 able seismic events each year.
 He charged that this reflected
 a "deliberate unwillingness" to
 reach agreement.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 3 March 196Q
 On 26 February, Tsarapkin
 announced Moscow's "official
 agreement" a  joint research
 program to improve the criteria
 for identifying seismic events
 to begin "immediately upon sig-
 nature of the treaty, as long
 as it banned all tests every-
 where."  By agreeing to under-
 take a research and development
 program even before the treaty
 is ratified, Moscow probably
 hopes to demonstrate its serious
 intent to cooperate actively in
 improving the detection and in-
 spection capabilities of the
 control apparatus.
 KHRUSHCHEV CONTINUES TOUR OF ASIA
 Although both Khrushchev
 and Sukarno reportedly were
 disappointed in the over-all
 reception given the Soviet pre-
 mier by Indonesians, the tour
 ended in an atmosphere of har-
 mony.   The joint communique,
 technical aid agreement,and cul-
 tural accord signed at the con-
 clusion of the visit gave Khru-
 shchev considerable propaganda
 grist. In return, he offered
 Soviet support for Indonesia's
 claims to West Irian (Netherlands
 New Guinea) and extended a $250,-
 000,000 credit which, if imple-
 mented, will help shore up
 Djakarta's rapidly deteriorating
 economy.
 The tenor of the communique
 suggests that one of Khrush-
 chev's primary aims in under-
 taking his two-week tour was to
 assure a continuation of Indo-
 nesia's policy of nonalignment.
 The statement, almost wholly de-
 voted to foreign relations,
 stressed the identity of inter-
 ests on anticolonialism, discon-
 tinuance of nuclear testing,
 complete disarmament, and repre-
 sentation of Afro-Asian nations
 at any summit talks subsequent
 to the Paris meeting on 16 May.
 Khrushchev does not seem
 to have made any effort to smooth
 the difficult relations between
 Indonesia and Communist China.
 He is said to have made some
 critical and disparaging remarks
 about China, and he failed to
 press for inclusion in the com-
 munique of a, statement supporting UN
 membership for Peiping.   In dis-
 cussing the desirability of Asian
 and African participation in sum-
 mit conferences, Khrushchev
 lumped Communist China with India,
 Indonesia, and Japan as states
 that should be represented.
 In contrast with other bloc
 media, the Chinese Communist
 press and radio have virtually
 ignored Khrushchev's trip.  This
 is an additional indication of
 the continuing coolness between
 Peiping and Moscow, and reflects
 Peiping's resentment at Khru-
 shchev's failure to support it in
 disputes with India and Indonesia.
 The Chinese probably also feel
 that the trip, coming at a time
 when they had begun to make their
 own gestures toward easing strains
 with these Asian countries, gives
 Khrushchev a large measure of the
 credit Peiping had hoped to gain
 for itself.
 Khrushchev's favorable re-
 sponse to Sukarno's requests for
 aid--the Indonesian President
 presumably proposed the aid fig-
 ure, inasmuch as this amount re-
 portedly was used in Djakarta's
 plan discussions this fall--
 provides a timely demonstration
 of tangible Soviet support. The
 new Soviet aid will be  used

 largely to underwrite the am-
 bitious and widely publicized
 five-year economic development
 plan which Indonesia hopes to
 implement between 1961 and 1965.
 The credit,  with the usual
 long-term,  low-interest provi-
 sions,  is earmarked for proj-
 ects to be built over a seven-
 year period conce4trated in
 areas of primary importance to
 basic industrialization--iron
 and steel, nonferrous metals,
 chemicals, and light industry.
 The USSR's preference for assist-
 ing large,  basic industrial
 enterprises was frequently noted
 by Khrushchev,  who disparaged
 Western aid as consisting chief-
 ly of consumer goods--i.e.,  food
 and clothing--items which
 Khrushchev insisted would serve
 only to keep Indonesia and other
 underdeveloped countries eco-
 nomically and dependent on the
 "imperialist powers."  By con-
 centrating its aid on construc-
 tion that can be readily seen,
 Moscow will gain maximum propa-
 ganda benefit.
 Sukarno was anxious to re-
 ceive this large credit and
 will publicize it widely as
 evidence of swift and decisive
 action on the nation's economic
 problems, although it probably
 will be implemented only grad-
 ually.   Poor Indonesian planning
 has prevented the country from
 using more than a quarter of
 the $240,000,000 in economic
 credits extended by the Sino-
 Soviet bloc since 1956, but
 work on some projects--including
 a program for aiding the es-
 tablishment of an atomic energy
 research program,  the Asian
 Games stadium in Djakarta,  and
 a school of marine sciences at
 Ambon--will probably be inten-
 sified  this  year  to  prepare
 for  the  more   important tasks
 envisaged  by the new credit.
 Indonesian  Army leaders
 reportedly opposed the accept-
 ance of extensive credit from
 the Soviet Union and tried to
 persuade Sukarno not to request
 it. Now  that he has done so,
 however, it seems unlikely that
 there will be any significant
 army reaction.
 En     route  from Indonesia
 to  Afghanistan,   the  last
 country  on  his   four-nation
 tour,   Khrushchev  stopped
 overnight at Calcutta  where
 he  met privately   with Prime
 Minister  Nehru  and   later
 had  dinner   with  him  and
 Burma's U  Nu.
 UAR-Israeli Situation
 The concern over possible
 hostilities between Israel and
 the UAR appears to have abated
 in both countries.   UAR Foreign
 Affairs Under Secretary Ghalib
 informed the American Embassy
 on 28 February that "certain
 military units have been pulled
 back," presumably from Sinai,
 and there are other indications
 that the UAR military alert has
 been relaxed.   Many of the 5,-
 000 Israeli reserves called up
 last week now have been released.
 UAR and Israeli officials
 are continuing to make public
 and private statements denying

 any aggressive intentions, and
 Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion
 is scheduled to arrive in the
 United States on 8 March for a
 private visit.         Ali Sabri,Nasir's
 chief aide, has stated that poor
 management of the UAR mobiliza-
 tion created an unanticipated
 war scare in Egypt which the
 government now is attempting to
 alleviate.
 Nasir's vigorous response
 to alleged Israeli plans to at-
 tack Syria probably has boosted
 his stature throughout the Arab
 world.   The crisis also has
 provided Israel with an occa-
 sion for intensive arms-procure-
 ment activity.   Stating that
 Nasir's bravado demonstrates
 the urgency of their military
 needs, the Israelis are supple-
 menting their appeal for Ameri-
 can equipment with requests to
 Paris, London, and perhaps West
 Germany.
 On 23 February, Shimon Peres,
 deputy director of the Israeli
 Ministry of Defense, arrived
 in Paris for arms-purchasing
 discussions with French Defense
 Ministry officials.   Former
 Israeli Army Chief of Staff
 Moshe Dayan, now minister of
 agriculture, also stopped in
 Paris en route to an appearance
 in Miami for an Israeli bond
 rally.   He conferred with the
 French chief of staff,  General
 Paul Ely.
 There are as yet no re-
 ports on the results of these
 talks.   The French earlier
 had been described as unrespon-
 sive to Israel's requests for
 additional arms commitments,
 although they were ready to
 honor existing contracts.  A
 French Foreign Ministry spokes-
 man said in December these would
 be fulfilled by the delivery of
 four or five aircraft.
 Peres is to continue his
 quest for arms in London this
 week.   London thinks he may
 ask for motor torpedo boats and
 ground-to-air missiles and says
 it will consult the United States
 before making any decison on
 Peres' request.   The British
 agreed in 1958 to sell Israel
 60 Centurion tanks, of which
 30 either have been or are being
 sent, and they intend to provide
 the remaining 30 tanks and per-
 haps more.   It is expected that
 the second of two submarines
 Israel has obtained from Britain
 will be refitted by early April
 and turned over to the Israeli
 Navy in June.
 State
 Secretary van ac erpen erg of
 the West German Foreign Ministry,
 however, has told the American
 Embassy in Bonn that under no
 circumstances would the Federal
 Republic consider supplying heavy
 arms to Israel.   Israel has sold
 grenade launchers, mortars, and
 submachine guns to the Germans,
 and Ben-Gurion said these sales
 were continuing.   Such deals
 with Bonn have been an internal
 political issue.in Israel.

 Israeli Immigration
 The emigration of Rumanian
 Jews to Israel--which a year
 ago evoked a severe reaction
 among the Arab states toward
 the bloc as well as Tel Aviv
 and caused Bucharest in effect
 to stop the flow at that time--
 has resumed recently.   Since
 last November more than 1,800
 Rumanian Jews have been proc-
 essed for emigration to Israel
 and other countries, and be-
 tween 1 January and 17 February,
 305 emigres had used the route
 through Athens to Israel.  Is-
 raeli officials in Athens are
 confident the emigration will
 continue at its present rate.
 Both the Israeli and Rumanian
 governments are avoiding any
 publicity about the new flow
 in. hopes of preventing Arab
 protests.
 Arab League
 The Arab League ended three
 weeks of intermittent sessions
 in Cairo on 29 February with an
 announcement reflecting little
 real accomplishment.   UAR and
 Jordanian differences on Pales-
 tine proved irreconcilable, and
 the league finally  shifted the
 problem  to  a committee ordered
 to  complete  plans  "with
 regard  to various  national
 and international aspects of
 the Palestine question." A
 future session, possible at the
 end of March, is to complete
 discussion of the UAR-backed
 proposal to create a Palestine
 state and army.   Jordan is almost
 certain to continue its oppo-
 sition  to the proposal, which,
 if effected, could cost it the
 territory west of the Jordan
 River and the allegiance  of
 many of its 600,000 refugee
 citizens.
 Cairo is going ahead with
 the organization of the Pales-
 tinians  in Egypt,  Syria, and
 Gaza, probably in the hope that
 these will eventually be capa-
 ble of dominating any future
 Palestinian government. Nasir
 is compelled to keep the initia-
 tive in the face of competitive
 efforts from Iraq, as well as
 Jordan.   Iraqi Prime Minister
 Qasim has made great propaganda
 play on the Palestinian question,
 creating a fund for the estab-
 lishment of a Palestine republic
 and promising to restore refugee
 "rights," while criticizing both
 Nasir and Jordan's King Husayn
 for alleged inaction.  Husayn
 has sought to sabotage any move
 toward a separate Palestinian
 state, offering Jordanian citi-
 zenship to all refugees providing
 they live in Jordan and not in
 the UAR or Lebanon.
 By comparison, the UAR's
 moves have been more direct.
 The Damascus press of 29 Febru-
 ary carried the views of Gaza
 Mayor Munir Rayyis, who has just
 completed consultations with
 Nasir.   Rayyis stated that the

 Palestinians of Syria and Egypt

 that Palestinians in all the

 Baghdad on 1 March broadcast
 an announcement by Aziz Sharif,
 secretary general of the move-
 ment, that a mass meeting of
 the Partisans to be held in late
 March will be under Qasim's
 patronage and addressed by him.
 Qasim's strategy seems to be
 to treat the Partisans as a

 PART I                    OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 in an attempt to undercut Commu-

 have functioned as the princi-
 pal Communist front in Iraq.
 They will not be registered
 under the Iraqi law controlling
 societies and political parties
 and, hence, will be particularly
 susceptible to the caprices of
 the Qasim regime.
 Baghdad is showing in-
 creased concern over the dis-
 mal state of the Iraqi economy,
 and has felt constrained to
 make promises that will be
 impossible to fulfill.   Re-
 flecting its concern, the gov-
 ernment is giving some encour-
 agnaant  to business dealings
 with the West, and is making
 new attempts to resolve diffi-
 culties with Western contractors.
 Some contractors have been
 asked to undertake new jobs
 on which Baghdad wants quick,
 reliable performance. A recent
 Czechoslovak offer of a $30,-
 000,000 credit will make it
 possible for the Iraqi Govern-
 ment to carry out quickly a        25X1
 number of small projects having
 an immediate domestic propa-
 ganda value.

 served by good roads, and are
 surrounded by heavy security
 restrictions.
 The towers are apparently
 intended for use by four dis-
 tinct organizations: the Minis-
 try of Post and Telecommunica-
 tions  (MPT),  the central com-
 mittee of the Socialist Unity
 (Communist) party  (SED),  the
 Ministry of Defense, and the
 State Radio Committee.    Some
 of the towers serve more than
 one user for more than one pur-
 pose,  indicating the high-level,
 integration of the program.
 The towers will be organ-
 ized into two groups to enlarge
 the microwave radio relay net-
 works of the MPT and the SED.
 The tall towers will be used
 in the enlarged MPT network.
 It will include three connect-
 ed "round-robin" rings--the
 northern,  middle, and southern
 --designed to improve operation-
 al reliability of the public
 telephone,  telegraph, and local
 network television services.
 When the program is com-
 pleted,  television service will
 be greatly improved in quality
 and will cover more than 80
 percent of East Germany and a
 considerable area in West Ger-
 many.
 All of the medium and most
 of the short towers will be
 used in the enlarged SED net-
 work, which carries telephone
 and telegraph traffic between
 party headquarters in East Ber-
 lin and the 14 districts of
 the country and subordinate of-
 fices located in the 215 coun-
 ties.   Employing eight-channel
 telephone equipment, this net-
 work will extend the coverage,

 rity of party communications.
 Some of these towers ap-
 pear to be intended for special-
 ized purposes as well.   The
 tall towers could be used by
 the military to transmit radar
 signals for air defense, com-
 mand and control signals  for
 guided missiles, and signals
 for electronic countermeasures
 and jamming.
 Some of the short towers
 may close the southern ring of
 the microwave radio relay net-
 work of the MPT.   Others near
 the West German border probably
 will be used to jam West German
 radiobroadcasts. All medium
 and short towers serving the
 SED probably will be used also
 by the Ministry of Defense in
 a special air-defense network
 as part of a long-range program
 to integrate microwave radio re-
 lay facilities with a "hardened"
 underground coaxial cable line.
 An over-all system, probably
 with connections to Moscow and
 other bloc areas, would greatly
 improve the reliability of bloc
 communications.
 The construction of tall
 towers in East Germany is be-
 lieved to be part of a program
 of the Organization for Coopera-
 tion Among the Socialist Coun-
 tries in the Fields of Post and
 Communications. This organiza-
 tion is mainly concerned with
 standardizing, integrating, and
 expanding the telecommunications
 networks of the countries of the
 Soviet bloc.
 Similar complexes may be un-
 der construction in other  bloc
 countries.   Tall towers being
 built in Poland, Czechoslovakia,
 and the USSR are to be used for
 microwave radio relay communica-  25X1
 tions and television broadcast-
 ing and possibly other functions.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 3 March 1960
 POLISH WORKER DISCONTENT BECOMING MORE WIDESPREAD
 Worker discontent in Po-
 land is growing as the regime
 carries but its policy aimed
 at steppipg up industrial pro-
 duction with only minor-in,.,
 creases in the labor force
 and at reduced costs.   Spon-
 taneous and unorganized work
 stoppages in several industrial
 areas in recent weeks--Poznan,
 Wroclaw,  Lodz, and Czestochowa
 --have been brought under con-
 trol by the threat of punitive
 measures, including dismis-
 sals and blacklisting.
 Unrest is likely to be-
 come more serious, however, as
 workers from five key indus-
 trial establishments in Poznan
 --including those at the Ce-
 gielski Works, where the riots
 of June 1956 began--reportedly
 met to decide on a coordinated
 protest if the wage cuts re-
 sulting from higher work norms
 remain in effect through the
 10 March pay day.
 and further dismissals was suf-
 ficient to end the strike.   The
 Poznan press claimed that the
 work stoppage was caused by a
 few troublemakers-.; and that the
 workers themselves brought
 those persons into line at spec-
 ial meetings of "Worker Self-
 Government Conferences."
 The policy of retrenchment
 adopted at the party central
 committee's third plenum last
 October is designed to make
 Polish industry more efficient.
 Under the wage reforms, workers
 may be expected to work harder
 at no increase in pay, and in
 many instances harder work may
 result in decreased wages.
 These wage reforms are to be
 applied slowly, however, and
 will extend into 1961 or after.
 A number of workers have been
 laid off in an effort to cut
 production costs and raise ef-
 ficiency, and this has caused
 unemployment in several areas.
 The most serious work
 stoppage thus far occurred it
 the railway repair shops and
 railway yards at Poznan on 19
 and 20 February.   This strike
 was only partially effective,
 as a number of workers on the
 second and third shifts re
 fused to participate.   The
 management reacted firmly,
 rejected the workers' demands,
 and summarily fired about 30
 leaders of the demonstration
 as "undesirable elements."
 The threat of blacklisting
 Although strikes are tech-
 nically legal in Poland, Gomulka
 himself has warned that they
 serve the interests of the
 "enemies of socialism."  The
 1960 plan indicates; that. War-
 saw intends to continue its
 retrenchment policy.   It calls
 for substantial increases in
 production with only a slight
 increase,  if any,  in employment.
 Some industries plan a 5-percent  25X1
 production increase with a 20-
 percent decrease in employment
 for the year.
 COMMUNIST CHINA SPEEDS CONSTRUCTION IN THE ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY
 Communist China is making
 a major effort to expand its
 electric power industry.   The
 accelerated pace of economic
 development of the past two
 years confronted the industry
 with increases in power require-
 ments not anticipated in original
 plans, and the installation of
 additional capacity has been
 speeded in an effort to keep up
 with these requirements.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Power-plant construction during
 the past two years has reflected
 this new emphasis and has brought
 considerable increases both in
 generating capacity and in out-
 put.
 China produced 41,5 billion
 kilowatt-hours of electricity

 IN COMMUNIST CHINA            u s
 in 1959, the target originally
 set for 1962, and generating
 capacity reached 8,700,000
 kilowatts, or almost twice
 that of 1957.   The present
 tempo of construction can be
 expected to bring roughly
 another doubling in the coming
 three years.   The chances are
 good that by 1962 China will
 be producing nearly 100 billion
 kilowatt-hours of electricity
 annually.
 Peiping has under construc-
 tion or expansion 65 major power
 plants with capacities over
 100,000 kilowatts; 14 of them
 will have capacities of 500,-

 At present, 14 of the 15

 are thermal plants, and thermal
 power still accounts for the
 major share of China's power

 By 1962, however, hydroelectric
 power will play a larger role
 and will account for well over
 30 percent of total output.

 plant, has been increased to
 567,000 kilowatts, and work is
 nearing completion on the 650,-
 000-kilowatt 4sinan River plant.
 Major hydroelectric projects
 expected to begin production
 this year include one at
 Hsinan, which will supply
 power to the Shanghai-Nanking-
 Hangchow complex; one at Huan-
 jen in Liaoning, which will
 serve the industrial northeast;
 one at Hsinfeng, which will
 serve Canton; and a plant on
 the Ili River which will be
 the largest power plant in
 Yunnan,
 Construction is also under
 way on seven of the 46 dam proj-
 ects planned for control and
 development of the Yellow River.
 Two of these--in the Sanmen
 and Liuchia gorges--will have
 capacities of over 1,000,000
 kilowatts,  and the other five
 will have a combined capacity
 of over 1,000,000 kilowatts.
 The Sanmen project,  the gener-
 ating equipment for which is
 being supplied by the USSR,  is
 expected to be in operation in
 1961,  and the power plant at
 Liuchia should be in operation
 the following year.
 Work on plans for develop-
 ment of the Yangtze River has
 been in progress since 1955,
 but no formal construction
 schedule has been announced.
 One proposal envisages  a
 single high dam at Three Gorges
 with a reservoir of over 100
 billion cubic meters and a power
 plant rated at more than 20,-
 000,000-kilowatt capacity.
 However,  the huge investment--
 almost $5 billion--the flooding
 of ten cities including Chung-
 king, and other problems cast
 doubt on the feasibility of
 such a project.
 Work is already under way
 on hydroelectric projects on
 a number of tributaries of the
 Yangtze.   Initial construction
 has been concentrated on the
 min,  Wu,  Hsiang,  Han,  Yuan,
 and Ili rivers.     Projects on
 the Ili will have a total gen-
 erating capacity of 330,000
 kilowatts and will supply mining
 and manufacturing industries
 in northern Yunnan, including
 an important copper installation
 at Tungchuan.   The 290,000-kilo-
 watt Tsupingpu project on the
 Min River will serve Chungking
 and Chengtu. A 1,000,000-kilo-
 watt plant on the Yuan River
 in central China and a 900,000-
 kilowatt plant at Tanchiangkou
 on the Han will supply the in-
 dustrial centers of Wuhan and
 Tayeh.
 The largest power plant
 planned for China in the near
 future now is under construction
 on the Chienchi River in north-
 ern Fukien.   This 1,200,000-
 kilowatt plant will be about
 one tenth larger than the San-
 men Gorge project and will even-
 tually contribute about 4 bil-   25X1
 lion kilowatt-hours to the
 country's electric power output.
 PEIPING LAYING THEORETICAL FOUNDATION FOR ECONOMIC PROGRAMS
 Recent announcements by
 Peiping suggest that the cam-
 paign to provide a theoretical
 basis for present economic pro-
 grams has been intensified.
 The campaign has been devel-
 oping since mid-December con-
 currently with a decline in
 attacks on "rightist" opponents
 of these programs, suggesting

 SECRET
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 that the authorities feel that
 the opposition has been dis-
 posed of for the time being
 and a more positive phase can
 now be introduced.     The major
 feature of the campaign is a
 renewed emphasis on "the thought
 of Mao Tse-tung" as the motivat-
 ing force behind the "leap for-
 ward."
 People's Daily on 28 Feb-
 ruary carried an article by
 Vice Premier Li Fu-chun en-
 titled,  "The Mass Movement Under
 the Guidance of the Ideas of Mao
 Tse-tung."   Li asserts that the
 great leap forward, under Mao's
 guidance, combines the "univer-
 sal truth of Marxism-Leninism
 with the concrete practice of
 the Chinese revolution," thus
 linking present economic pro-
 grams,firmly with the party's
 unique use of the "mass move-
 ment."  This mass movement,  Li
 says,  is permeated with the
 spirit of Mao's concept of un-
 interrupted revolution.
 The Li Fu-chun article
 credits Mao with having drawn
 up the Chinese Communist party's
 "general line for building so-
 cialism."  The article explains
 that Mao's "two legs" policies
 of simultaneous development of
 industry and agriculture, heavy
 and light industry, large and
 small enterprises, and native
 and modern methods have created
 a great change in the national
 economy.   The rapid advance of
 the leap forward is credited to
 the correct handling of a series
 of contradictions "under the
 leadership of the party and in
 accordance with the teaching of
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung."
 The entire second page of
 People's Daily on 29 February
 was devoted to an article en-
 titled, "How a Marxist Should
 Look Upon New Things."  The
 article consisted of excerpts
 25X1
 from the "classical writers of
 Marxism--Marx, Engels, Lenin,
 Stalin, and Comrade Mao Tse-
 tung,`?but omitting Khrushchev.
 Moscow has been reluctant to
 acknowledge the "thought of Mao
 Tse-tung" as a contribution to
 Marxism-Leninism and will find
 these renewed claims unpalatable.
 An editorial note appended
 to the article pointed out that
 the development of new things
 "is not all smooth sailing but
 a process of serious struggle,"
 and.that "there are bound to be
 shortcomings and mistakes."
 The note suggests that the pur-
 pose of publishing the selec-
 tions is to argue that the ob-
 vious difficulties of the leap
 forward have been part of a na-
 tural process.
 An article in the current
 issue of the party's theoreti-
 cal journal Red Flag furnishes
 further evidence of the cam-
 paign's direction.   The article,
 entitled "The People's Commune
 Is a Great Creation of the Mass-
 es of Our Country," cites "his-
 torical facts and other refer-
 ences to prove that the people's
 commune is anatural product of
 Chinese history."  The purpose
 apparently is to counter charges
 that the commune system is an
 artificial creation imposed on
 an unwilling people.
 On 29 February Peiping
 also announced that the National
 People's Congress and the Nation-
 al Committee of the Chinese
 People's Political Consultative
 Conference would meet jointly
 in the latter part of March.
 The agenda for the meeting are
 almost exclusively economic
 and provide an opportunity for
 launching a new drive for great-
 er communalization and for con-   25X1
 solidation of the theoretical
 foundation now being d
 for the leap forward.

 level.
 Nehru immediately welcomed
 Chou's agreement to meet in
 the Indian capital. He had as-
 sured his cabinet, who opposed
 any meeting outside the coun-
 try,                  that Indian prestige
 abroad would benefit if Chou
 were to come to India.   Chou's
 acceptance of New Delhi also
 makes it easier for Nehru to
 mollify elements in Parliament
 and the press who have criti-
 cized his willingness to con-

 The Indian press and pub-
 lic are likely to give Chou a
 chilly  reception, with some
 open hostility.   Although re-
 action since the announcement
 of Chou's acceptance has been
 restrained, conservative and
 Socialist opposition leaders
 had earlier warned that their
 groups, as well as the people
 in general, would refuse to go
 along with the government in
 treating Chou as a "honored

 mandering of electoral districts
 in eight of Laos'  12 provinces
 has been completed, and the task

 RATIFICATION OF US-JAPANESE SECURITY TREATY STALLED
 The Japanese Socialists,
 aided by factionalism in Prime
 Minister Kishi's Liberal-Demo-

 to stall legislative delibera-
 tions on the new US-Japanese
 security treaty.   They hope to
 provoke the prime minister into
 a rash move which vould arouse
 public opinion against him and
 the treaty.   Kishi has been con-
 fident that procrastination  by
 the Socialist opposition would
 overtax public patience and en-
 able him to secure Diet ratifi-
 cation in May, but attempts by
 his intraparty rivals  to make
 his resignation the price of their
 support could lead him to call for
 a general election on the  issue.

 The Socialists thus far
 have challenged the government
 to give a precise definition of
 the "Far East" area covered
 by the treaty and have objected
 to the treaty's 11-year duration.
 In the absence of constitutional
 or legislative provision to the
 contrary, they assert that the
 Diet has the right to amend or
 revise treaties. Kishi's intra-
 party rivals--led by Ichiro
 Kono,  Kenzo Matsumura,  and Tan-
 zan Ishibashi--are supporting
 this contention.
 Kishi's rivals, however,
 face a double handicap. The
 Japanese in general find mili-
 tary cooperation with a foreign
 country distasteful, but they
 believe close cooperation with
 the United States is in Japan's
 vital interest, politically and
 economically, and thus acquiesce
 in the security treaty.  Any
 member of the government party
 who jeopardizes Japan's rela-
 tions with the United States
 by upsetting the security ar-
 rangements would probably en-
 danger his own chances of be-
 coming prime minister. At the
 same time, Kishi's opponents
 recognize that, should he re-
 sort to a general election on
 the treaty issue, his position
 probably would be strengthened
 and their own weakened.
 On 11 February Kishi re-
 portedly agreed with Suehiro
 Nishio, head of the new Demo-
 cratic Socialist party (DSP),
 not to hold an election before
 September, providing that party
 does not boycott Diet delibera-
 ations and voting on the treaty.
 Kishi's apparent strategy
 is to allow the Socialists
 abundant time for objections
 and debate in the Diet before
 calling on his party's large
 majority    to   ratify  the
 treaty.   He expects a full-scale
 Socialist boycott of the Diet
 voting, but believes that the
 ample opportunity for dissent
 given to them and the DSP's
 participation in the voting
 should assuage the frequent con-
 tention among the Japanese that
 the government uses its majority
 in a tyrannical fashion.
 Diet deliberations on the
 treaty have been suspended at
 least until 10 March, pending
 action on the national budget.
 Subsequently,  Socialist obstruc-
 tionism can be expected to con-
 tinue, but Kishi is confident
 that he can overcome it and
 obtain ratification of the
 treaty without change by the
 end of the Diet session on
 26 May.
 Political activity will
 increase in Cameroun now that
 Prime Minister Ahidjo has set
 10 April as the date for
 legislative elections which
 will determine the character
 of the government to succeed
 the present transitional regime.
 Ahidjo's announcement came three
 days after the endorsement by
 national referendum of his gov-
 ernment's proposed constitution
 for Cameroun, which gained its
 independence on 1 January. This
 constitution, like its French
 model, provides for a powerful
 presidency--probably  the goal
 of Ahidjo--a government headed
 by a prime minister, and a
 legislature with limited powers.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The balloting on the con-
 stitution was  the first test
 of the political strength of
 the present moderate government.
 The results--an over-all  af-
 firmative majority of 60 per-
 cent but a majority of negative
 votes  in  the  more advanced
 southern area--reflect  the
 basic regional cleavage in this
 former French trust territory.
 However, the participa-
 tion of a record 75 percent of
 registered voters was a victory
 of sorts for Ahidjo, a Moslem
 from the north, in that it re-
 vealed the lack of significant
 popular support for his chief
 foe, Felix Moumie, leader  of
 the terrorist wing of the mili-
 tant nationalist Union of                the
 Cameroons Population (UPC).
 Moumie and his associates,
 whose principal  headquarters
 have recently been in Guinea,
 had called for a boycott of
 the referendum.  Having failed
 in his bid, Moumie later pub-
 licly called for total amnesty
 for-the UPC, withdrawal of all
 foreign troops, and the freeing
 of all political detainees.  In
 exchange,  the extremists would
 end terrorism, refrain from
 proclaiming a "revolutionary
 Cameroun government," and
 would participate in delayed
 general elections.
 Encouraged by  Moumie's
 failure,Ahidjo has lifted the
 ban imposed by  the French on
 the Marxist-oriented UPC   in
 1955 after it first  resorted
 to major violence.   This con-
 ciliatory move, aimed at pro-
 moting a reconciliation among
 Cameroun's diverse political
 elements in advance of the April
 election, has been well re-
 ceived.
 Chief beneficiaries of the
 UPC's restoration will almost
 certainly be its more moderate
 adherents; they have provided
 the backbone of the constitu-
 tional opposition to the gov-
 ernment since they returned,
 under other labels, to legal
 political activity last year.
 These elements are expected to
 convene an early party congress
 to formalize their break with
 Moumie, and can be expected to
 make a major effort to demon-
 strate the validity of   their
 claim to  the party name and
 to make the UPC once again the
 most effective political organ-
 ization in the country. Ahidjo's
 action may presage a  move on
 his part to bring the UPC and
 other more representative south-
 ern elements into the govern-
 ment, possibly even before the
 April election.
 As part of its pre-election
 preparations,   the  government
 has also undertaken--with   the
 aid of reinforced French Army
 forces serving at  the request
 of the Cameroun Government--a
 new  military   effort  in  the
 southwestern area,where Moumie's
 followers and other dissident
 elements are in open rebellion.
 British officials are supporting
 these operations by tightening
 border controls on their side of
 Cameroun's frontier with British
 Cameroons.   The operations, be-
 gun on 15 February under French
 direction, are apparently having
 some success.

 liable information on the dis-
 tribution of party strength
 throughout the country.
 Bekkai,  who headed the
 first two Moroccan governments
 from December 1955 until May
 1958, is a member of the Beni
 Snassen tribe of eastern Moroc-
 co and of the rural-based Popu-
 lar Movement.   He has long been
 closely associated with the
 King, and is a capable but un-
 dynamic administrator.   Other
 anticipated changes are the
 replacement of most, if not
 all, left-wing supporters of
 Ibrahim by members of the Is-
 tiqlal party, which had re-
 fused to participate in the
 Ibrahim government formed as
 a caretaker regime in December
 1958.
 Ibrahim and to some extent
 the King are caught in the cross
 fire between left- and right-
 wing groups.  Ibrahim is sup-
 ported by the leftist National
 Union of Popular Forces (UNFP)
 formed in September following
 a schism in the Istiglal party.
 The UNFP--proponent of a con-
 stitutionally limited monarchy
 --seeks to have the military
 and police forces subordinated
 to the government rather than to
 the King.   Ibrahim, whose exact
 relationship with the UNFP is
 not known, may have jeopardized
 his political future by not
 defending more vigorously the
 position of the UNFP.
 Traditional Istigialists,
 remembering that leftist,pres-
 sure on the military-police
 issue brought the fall of the
 Balafrej government 15 months
 ago, and with an eye to the forth-
 coming elections, are sharply
 critical of the Ibrahim govern-
 ment and seek the complete sup-
 pression of the UNFP. Recent
 police moves against the UNFP,
 coupled with somewhat spurious
 claims of the discovery of a
 UNVP plot to assassinate the
 crown prince, apparently indi-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Abbas' 29 February speech
 was largely a recitation of
 rebel grievances against France,
 but reiterated the desire for
 a negotiated solution.   It at-
 tacked any French plan involv-
 ing the partition of Algeria
 into French and Moslem sectors,
 as well as the scheduling of
 cantonal elections for this
 spring.   Although the declara-
 tion appeared designed largely
 for its propaganda effects, it
 reflected the rebels' concern
 for their following in Algeria,
 and a fear that cantonal elec-
 tions could lead to the crea-
 tion of a French-sponsored
 "Third Force."
 The American Embassy in
 Tunis observes that the Algeri-
 ans                   appear convinced that they
 are on strong ground in insist-
 ing on guarantees concerning
 their role in an Algerian ref-
 erendum, both with respect to
 their own followers and inter-
 national opinion.
 Public opinion in France
 increasingly favors a negotiated
 rather than a military solution
 to the Algerian question, and
 rebel declarations are being
 discussed more objectively than
 heretofore.   Most Parisian news-
 papers believe Abbas wants a
 solution, but several moderate
 rightist dailies  are critical
 of what they see as continuing
 rebel pretensions to be th:3 ex-
 clusive representatives of Al-
 geria.   Rumors of negotiations
 are reviving, and a rebel emis-
 sary is said to be in Paris to
 make arrangements for the ar-
 rival of an official delegation.
 During his 25-28 February
 tour of southwestern France,
 De Gaulle reaffirmed his policy
 of self-determination and in-
 sisted that the future of Al-
 geria was not a topic for cease-
 fire negotiations.   He cau-
 tioned that the consultations
 with all groups--to take place
 after the"end of hostilities--
 to decide on the political fu-
 ture of Algeria would be long-
 drawn-out, taking "perhaps
 years and years before the
 right balance is found."
 De Gaulle's current visit
 to military field installations
 in Algeria is probably designed
 to sound out army opinion on
 the aftermath of the January
 insurrection in Algiers.   He
 will probably also gauge army
 sentiment on moving ahead with
 the civilian-administered can-
 tonal elections,which have al-
 ready been announced for late
 May or early June.   He is also
 reassuring the army that paci-
 fication is still a prerequisite.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Premier Segni had indi-
 cated his government's adher-
 ence to the broad general pro-
 gram his party adopted follow-
 ing the 1958 elections, but
 the Liberals abandoned him on
 the charge that he was becoming
 oriented to the left and that
 his regime failed to implement
 the program.   The Christian
 Democrats' current program bids
 for support from the left by
 advocating full compliance with
 the constitution, many of whose
 articles have never become law,
 by approving "useful state in-
 tervention" in the economy, 25X1
 particularly in the energy
 field, by endorsing relaxation
 of international tension, and
 by rejecting the support of neo-
 Fascists.   Rejection of support
 from the Communists is probably
 opposed by only a minority within
 the Nenni Socialist party.
 The Christian Democratic
 program's concessions to the
 right--endorsement of "absolute
 loyalty to the traditional Atlan-
 tic and European foreign policy"
 and protection of the freedom
 of private enterprise--are rel-
 Ativelr  noncontroversial.   An
 attempt will probably be made
 to allay rightist fears of a
 leftward drift by the allocation
 of the premiership and certain
 other ministries to persons--
 such as Senator Piccioni or
 former Premiers Scelba or Pella
 --acceptable to at least the
 moderate right.
 It is likely that the Lib-
 erals w'il be unimpressed by
 these concessions and will join
 the Monarchists and neo-Facists
 in voting against such a govern-
 ment.   With Nenni Socialist
 party abstention, a center-left
 coalition could win a comfor-
 table majority unless, as is not
 expected, a large number of
 Christian Democrats should de-
 cide to split away.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 3 March 1960
 ANGLO-GERMAN
 The latent ill feeling
 between Britain and West Germany
 has been stirred up again. Re-
 cent events seem to have largely
 nullified the efforts in late
 1959 to improve relations--
 Chancellor Adenauer's discussions
 with Prime Minister Macmillan in
 London in November, the agree-
 ments between Defense Ministers
 :Strauss and Watkinson for in-
 creased defense production co-
 operation in December,  and ex-
 pressions of a mutual desire to
 resolve the incipient economic
 and political rivalries between
 the Common Market and the Outer
 Seven.
 The revelation of Bonn's
 moves to obtain training and
 logistics facilities in Spain
 touched off the most recent
 eruption.   The British press
 immediately protested the by-
 passing of NATO, especially since
 Bonn's moves involved Franco
 `3pain.   Foreign Secretary Lloyd
 made it clear that London pre-
 ferred that such arrangements
 be made with a NATO ally,  but
 in answering a barrage of ques-
 tions in Parliament he kept the
 government's hands free by re-
 fusing to state that Britain
 would oppose in the North Atlan-
 tic Council any German military
 facilities outside the NATO area.
 The British  criticism,fol-
 lowing closely the distorted han-
 dlingby London's popular press
 of anti-Semitic incidents in
 West Germany, in turn raised
 German resentment to a postwar
 high.   The German public resents
 particularly the British incli-
 nation to cast Germans in the
 role of wartime enemies.   A high
 Bonn Foreign Ministry official
 has complained to an American
 representative that the opposi-
 tion of other NATO powers to the
 talks with Spain amounts to
 mistrust of Germany and an ap-
 parent desire to relegate West
 Germany to a "second-class"
 status.
 Adenauer's attitude toward
 London seems more one of distrust.
 He feels the British are overly
 eager to obtain a compromise in-
 terim agreement on Berlin's fu-
 ture and sees their laxity in
 permitting travel of East Germans
 to Britain and their initial
 willingness to accept the new
 Soviet passes for the military
 missions---bearing the name
 "German Democratic Republic"?
 as further evidences of a tend-
 ency to accept the East German
 regime.
 The Macmillan government
 on its part has recently been
 stiffening its attitude against
 the relaxation of Western
 European Union treaty restric-
 tions of German armaments
 production.   In particular it
 has been stalling on Bonn's
 request to raise displacement
 limits on combat ships from
 3,000 to 6,000 tons, and a
 Foreign Office official has
 cited the British reaction to
 the German-Spanish talks in
 Madrid as likely to increase
 the difficulties of granting

 coastal shipping on which Fu-
 kien had traditionally de-
 pended.
 The Railway Engineer Corps
 of the People's Liberation Army
 started work on the 435-mile
 Yingtan-Amoy line in October
 1954.   This line, constructed
 through.diff icult  terrain
 necessitating many expensive
 bridges, tunnels, cuts,   and
 fills, was completed in Decem-
 ber 1956.   In April 1956 the
 Ministry of Railways started
 construction on a 130-mile
 branch line from Wukeng, near
 Nanping, to Foochow; this sec-
 tion was completed in Decem-
 ber 1958.   The'two lines con-
 stitute the present rail sys-
 tem serving Fukien and give
 the province its first really
 high-capacity overland connec-
 tion with the rest of China.
 They already are the most im-
 portant form of long-distance
 transport in the area.
 Yunnan line.   Construction is
 going  on  westward from  the
 minor river port of Chuanchou,
 the proposed eastern terminus
 of the line, and from Changping.
 The roadbed on the latter sec-
 tion may be finished as far as
 Lungyen.  Work is said also to
 be under way on a line  south
 from Lungyen toward Kwangtung.
 Finally, a direct coastal rail-
 road between Foochow and Amoy
 is being surveyed.  When  all
 these lines are completed,the
 rail net serving Fukien  will
 have gained greatly in flexi-
 bility, and rail service will
 have been brought to within 50
 miles of any point in the prov-
 ince.
 On the basis of what is
 known about the present  sys-
 tem's physical characteristics,
 equipment,   and operating pro-
 cedures,   its  theoretical
 through-operating  capability
 is 7,300 tons each way per day,
 or 5,300,000 tons a year. Con-
 siderably less  than  this is
 now is use, however.
 A number of additional
 lines are being surveyed or
 are under construction.  The
 line to Foochow is being ex-
 tended and  will eventually
 curve northward up the coast
 to connect with  a pair of
 lines being built southeast-
 ward from the Chekiang-Hunan
 Railroad to the sea. The first
 of these, which begins at Chin-
 hua, will pass through Wenchow
 and then proceed south along
 the coast to meet   the   line
 from Foochow.   Work was begun
 on this line in 1958.   The
 second, on which work was be-
 gun in January 1959,begins at
 Yushan, roughly parallels the
 first, and will join it around
 Patu.   These two lines may be
 finished next year.
 In the southern part of
 the province, work is in prog-
 ress on the eastern sections
 of what will ultimately  be
 China's "second great lati-
 tudinal railway"--the Fukien-
 The system does  have  a
 number of important weaknesses,
 the  most  important being the
 bottleneck  section  between
 Yingtan and the Wukeng junction,
 which limits traffic on the en-
 tire line. Then, a combination
 of terrain and  heavy seasonal
 rains from March to September
 makes the lines highly suscep-
 tible to periodic damage  and
 interruption.
 Highways
 Prior to 1949, highways
 provided the only and very lim-
 ited means of overland movement
 in  the southeast coastal area.
 The  Chinese Communists  after
 they came to power concentrated
 first on restoring and renovat-

 roads.    A program  of building
 new roads was  launched  later,
 and  by   the end of 1959  there
 were about 4,500 miles of fair-
 ly good motor roads in the prov-
 ince.   In addition, there                                                          are

 2,200 miles of "simple" high-
 ways having little or no sur-
 facing, few if any bridges, and
 little drainage.   Peiping re-
 classified these as "motor
 roads" in 1958, but they are
 passable only by jeep and then
 only in fair weather.
 There are four major high-
 way routes serving the area.
 The coastal road which links
 Wenchow  Foochow, Amoy, and
 Swatow is of major economic
 importance, as it serves one
 third of Fukien's population.
 It also is of prime military
 importance.   Under normal op-
 erating conditions, it can prob-
 ably handle about 1,200 tons
 each way per day.   A second
 route, a section of the old im-
 perial post road from Hangchow
 to Canton, parallels this one
 about 100 miles inland and is
 still an important link between
 Fukien and adjacent provinces.
 It can handle about 850-1,200
 tons each way per day, depend-
 ing on the section involved.
 These two major north-
 south routes are crossed by two
 major east-west routes.  The
 more northerly, which connects
 Shangjao with Foochow via
 Chienou, can handle some 850-
 1,000 tons each way per day.
 A portion of this route will be
 flooded by the Chienchi dam
 reservoir, but an alternate
 route from Yushan to Foochow
 via Pucheng has been built. A
 more southerly route, connect-
 ing Changting with Lungchi and
 Amoy, can handle about 1,000
 tons each way per day under
 normal conditions.   Since the
 improvement of the railroads,
 Fukien's highways handle large-
 ly local traffic.
 It is estimated that civil-
 ian agencies in Fukien control
 some 4,000 vehicles, mostly
 trucks.   Military units in the
 area are believed to have about
 7,500 trucks.
 Except for the "simple"
 highways, Fukien's net is gen-
 erally of good quality.   The
 major roads are limited, all-
 weather roads with.. gravel or:
 crushed-rock surfacing. Some
 roads are not completely
 bridged, and this, plus the
 existence of a number of one-
 way bridges and defiles, has
 limited traffic.   The chief
 weakness, however, is the
 mixed-vehicle park and limited
 repair facilities, which for
 civilian vehicles are confined
 to five main depots.   Road
 maintenance apparently is sat-
 isfactory; Fukien was honored
 last year as an "advanced high-
 way maintenance" province.   The
 future role of the highways
 probably will be as a feeder
 to the railway and waterways.
 The Chinese Communists have in
 fact indicated that the major
 highway network is complete,
 and that future highway con-
 struction will concentrate on
 short feeder routes.
 Waterways
 Fukien has some 9,000
 miles of inland waterways,
 2,500 miles of which are nav-
 igable by modern powered ves-
 sels.   The Min River and its
 tributaries--the Shachi, the
 Futanchi, and the Chienchi--form
 the principal inland water sys-
 tem.   Modern powered vessels
 can make the run between Foochow
 and Nanping, with 100-ton ves-
 sels going as far as Shiukow--
 about halfway--and 40-ton ves-
 sels the rest of the way.   Nav-
 igational aids permitting both
 night and day traffic have been
 erected.   Cargo movement on the
 tributaries is accomplished by
 smaller vessels making shorter
 runs.
 It is believed Fukien's
 inland waterways could move
 some 20,000,000 tons of cargo
 a year.   Some three fourths of
 this total would be basic com-
 modities moved short distances
 in small vessels to meet local
 needs; the remaining quarter
 would be moved longer distances
 in more modern powered vessels.
 Performance is well below this
 level.
 Fukien has a long coast-
 line, which traditionally has
 served as the springboard for
 contacts with the rest of China.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Since 1949 the presence of Chi-
 nese Nationalist forces in the
 Taiwan Strait area has prevented
 Peiping's free use of coastal
 shipping.   The Chinese Commu-
 nists have 400,000 tons of
 coastal shipping in powered ves-
 sels of 1,000 tons or more. On-
 ly a small portion of this fleet
 is active in the area.   Major
 Chinese Communist flag vessels
 do not call at Amoy, and the
 number which calls at Foochow
 is limited.   The gap is served
 by a few foreign flag vessels--
 British and Norwegian for the
 most part--and by junks rang-
 ing in size from 50 to 200 tons.
 The cargo-moving capabil-
 ity of coastal traffic is lim-
 ited by the cargo-handling
 capacities of the principal
 ports.   It is estimated that
 Amoy, the best equipped in this
 respect, can handle 7,600 tons
 a day; Amoy, however, is the
 place where the Chinese Nation-
 alist port closure is the most
 effective.   Wenchow and Swatow,
 which receive much cargo for
 onward movement to Fukien, have
 capacities of 5,600 and 3,000
 tons a day, respectively.  Foo-
 chow can manage only 1,000 tons,
 and various minor ports another
 several hundred tons a day.
 Thus the ports between Wenchow
 and Swatow can handle in the
 aggregate something on the or-
 der of 6,000,000 tons a year.
 They probably account for no
 more than 2,000,000 tons at
 present, divided equally be-
 tween modern and primitive
 carriers.
 General Considerations
 The authorities in Com-
 munist China have shown them-
 selves to be fairly effective
 in their control of transport
 operations in Fukien, despite
 the added burden placed on fa-
 cilities there by the military.
 On occasions, however, they
 have experienced difficulties
 in coordinating traffic among
 the various types of carriers.
 In the latter part of 1958, for
 example, when the demands be-
 ing put on the transportation
 system by the "great leap for-
 ward" were at their greatest,
 the major transport centers in
 Fukien became badly congested.
 The response was to establish
 what the regime called a "uni-
 fied command" to coordinate and
 control all modes of transport.
 This command may still be func-
 tioning.   Prior to its estab-
 lishment, separate organizations
 controlled rail traffic on the
 one hand and highway and water-
 way traffic on the other.
 Timber is the principal
 item in all outgoing traffic.
 Lesser amounts of agricultural
 products, such as tea and fruit,
 as well as ores and other raw
 materials are also shipped out.
 Coal appears to be one of the
 main items coming into the area,
 along with manufactured goods,
 petroleum products, and fertil-
 izer.  Grain, cement, and other
 construction supplies make up an
 important part of intraprovince
 movements.
 The ability of the Chinese
 Communists to expand coastal
 service once the Chinese Na-
 tionalist threat is removed is
 obvious.   Even without its re-
 moval, however, they could
 move greatly increased amounts
 of cargo if they would give such
 movement sufficient priority.
 The main ingredient for a sharp
 increase would be the provision
 of large numbers of shallow-
 draft vessels--junks for ex-
 ample--which could operate in
 coastal waters and offload
 without developed port facil-
 ities.
 It is clear that Peiping
 intends to tie Fukien's economy
 more closely   to that of the
 rest of China and plans that
 Fukien itself achieve a modest
 level of industrialization.
 Some measure of the regime's
 intentions in this respect may
 be found in its plans to erect
 a 1,200,000-kilowatt hydroelec-
 tric power plant on the Chien-
 chi.   Construction has already
 begun.   The first stage of a
 200,000-kw.installation near
 Kutien is already generating
 power.   In addition, an iron
 and steel plant capable of pro-
 ducing 300,000 to 400,000 tons

 at Sanming.
 Efforts are also being
 made to exploit the province's
 iron ore deposits, which,are
 more important for their qual-
 ity than for their size.   Coal
 mines are being developed in
 an attempt to reduce the de-
 pendence of the province on
 coal produced elsewhere.
 The total transportation
 picture in Fukien is steadily
 getting better.  The transport
 net is growing and is increas-
 ingly able to depend on more
 efficient carriers. Thus rail-
 ways and coastal shipping now
 carry the bulk of long-distance
 cargo movement,  :leaving,' the
 highways and inland waterways
 to take care of short-distance
 transport from the primary pro-
 ducing areas to the nearest
 railroad or port.  The net is
 becoming flexible, so that when
 adverse weather curtails ship-
 ments on one route, alternates
 are often available for priority
 cargoes.  This net, plus the ad-
 ditions now programed, should be
 adequate to meet future economic
 demands and provide greatly im-
 proved logistic support to the
 armed forces in the area.
 The Chinese Nationalist
 Government during the last
 three years has shown increas-
 ing concern over relations be-
 tween the native Taiwanese and
 Chinese mainlanders on Taiwan.
 This  concern  stems  partly'
 from increasing  demands  for
 political  rights  by  the
 Taiwanese, who constitute the
 majority  of the  population,
 and partly from  the induction
 into the  armed forces of in-
 creasing numbers                     of Taiwanese,
 who cannot Ehare the mainlanders'
 desire  to return  to   the
 mainland.
 Taiwanese-Mainlander Relations
 Over-all relations between
 the eight million native Tai-
 wanese and the two million
 mainland-born Chinese remain
 cool, and close friendships be-
 tween the adult members of the
 two groups are rare.   Most
 Taiwanese have not forgotten
 the 1947inassacre which followed
 their revolt against the cor-
 rupt rule of Governor Chen Yi,
 and many--particularly  former
 landowners--remember  Japanese
 rule with  pleasant nostalgia.
 The  peasants, however,   who
 have benefited  from   land
 reform, are more  favorably
 disposed toward the Nationalist
 Government.
 The cultural differences
 between the Taiwanese and Chi-
 nese are sharp.  Most mainland-
 ers cannot understand the South
 Fukienese dialect of the Taiwan-
 ese, and the majority of Taiwan-
 ese have great difficulty under-
 standing the Mandarin speech
 used by government officials.
 The Taiwanese resent the su-
 perior status and privileges
 assumed by the mainlanders, many
 of whom regard the Taiwanese as
 inferior and provincial.
 Relations appear to be
 gradually improving.  Taiwanese
 children are being taught the
 Mandarin dialect and Chinese
 history and culture in govern-
 ment schools.  At the same time,
 many of the children of main-
 landers are adopting the out-
 look of the Taiwanese.  There
 is increasing intermarriage,
 generally mainlander men mar-
 rying Taiwanese women, appar-
 ently without loss of status
 for either partner.

 is even more concerned, how-

 wanese interest in political
 activities.   The government re-
 cently suppressed the Local
 Self-Government Study Group,
 which was formed in 1957 and
 included many prominent Tai-

 Many Taiwanese leaders
 have been openly critical of
 government suppression of po-
 litical freedom.   In a public
 attack last year, Li Wan-ch'
 a prominent member of the Tai
 wan Provincial Assembly, ac-
 cused the government of fail-
 ing to establish democratic
 rule, of restricting civil lib-
 erties and personal freedom,
 and of discriminating against
 Taiwanese in appointments to
 public offices, particularly
 the exclusion of Taiwanese
 from major positions in the
 central government.   The fact
 that a few Taiwanese are mem-
 bers of the Legislative Yuan
 and on the central committee
 of the Kuomintang party  has
 not appeased the Taiwanese.
 Kuomintang agents infil-
 trated the organization, and
 government red tape blocked re-
 quests for a charter.   The only
 means of organized political
 expression now open to polit-
 ically articulate independents
 is membership in one of the
 government-subsidized minority
 parties.   This is unacceptable
 to the independents, who are
 considering a boycott of the
 local elections of 24 April, but
 absence of an effective organ-
 ization probably precludes a
 successful boycott.
 The administration also has
 subverted independent newspapers
 and    magazines.  .   The press
 organ of the local Self-Govern-

 lands, however, the government
 must continue to consider the
 feelings of civilian Taiwanese
 who have given only reluctant
 public support and have private-
 ly voiced opposition.
 The regime has set 35 per-
 cent as the maximum proportion
 of Taiwanese in the armed
 forces. Mainland-born youths
 will be available to supply
 most officer requirements, but
 ultimately the government will
 have to choose between accept-
 ing a higher proportion of
 Taiwanese in its armed forces
 or reducing the number of mili-
 tary personnel.   Problems of
 age will make it impossible to
 retain the mainland veterans
 in service, and the army even-
 tually will become Taiwanese.
 Outlook
 Taiwanese leaders are
 aware that vigorous political
 activity on their part may
 generate instability, but they
 probably will continue to press
 for greater representation and
 seek to develop an organiza-
 tion into An acceptable and ef-
 fective vehicle for the Taiwan-
 ese political movement, despite
 government harassment.
 If liberal mainlander and
 Taiwanese leaders can cooperate
 in pressing for reforms, par-
 ticularly in the Provincial As-

 between the two groups is clos-
 est, the Nationalist Government
 may yield and modify certain
 of its  military and austerity
 policies  in favor  of  the

 wan.    if,   as seems  less
 likely, the government re-
 sponds     by adopting  increas-

 EFFECTS OF SPAIN'S ECONOMIC STABILIZATION PROGRAM
 The success so far of
 Spain's economic stabilization
 program and the enhancement of
 Generalissimo Franco''s inter-
 national prestige through  a
 series of diplomatic visits
 have strengthened the regime's
 position and discouraged op-
 position elements in their ef-
 forts to achieve united action.
 Production levels are still
 low, however, workers are in-
 creasingly discontented over
 the prospects of greater un-
 employment, and influential
 cabinet ministers are opposing
 some of the program's measures
 .for abhieving economic expan-
 sion.
 Accomplishments
 The program which Spain
 formally inaugurated with $426,-
 000,000 in international fi-
 nancial aid on 20 July 1959,
 when it won full membership in
 the Organization for European
 Economic Cooperation (OEEC),
 now has attained the primary
 goal of bringing financial sta-
 bility.   The increase in in-
 flation has been drastically
 slowed through a retrenchment
 in government expenditures,re-
 strictions on bank credit,and
 an increase in interest rates.
 Prices on most commodities,
 with some important exceptions
 such as food, have been stabi-
 lized,  and the heretofore
 rapid rise in the cost of liv-
 ing has been considerably
 slowed.
 Controls on foreign trade
 have been loosened, and Spain's
 balance-of-payments position
 has improved. For the last five
 months of 1959, the country's
 surplus of foreign-exchange re-
 ceipts was $117,000,000,  and

 contraction of Spain's  mili-
 tary position in North Africa.
 There probably will also
 be a slackening in the modest
 progress  which  non-Communist
 left-of-center opposition
 groups have apparently been
 making in cooperating on an
 anti-Franco program.   The So
 Cialists, Basque Nationalists,
 and several other parties re-
 portedly accepted late last
 September a pact sponsored by
 exiled leaders of the Christian
 Democratic Left and Socialists.
 This agreement called for com-
 mon action to hasten Franco's
 downfall without creating
 chaos, and pledged a provision-
 al government to restore civil
 liberties and hold elections
 to determine Spain's political
 future.
 The Christian Democratic
 right wing, under Jose Maria
 Gil Robles, and the Monarch-
 ists have rejected this pact.
 The Communists, excluded from
 participation as a "totali-
 tarian force," are trying to
 sabotage it by inviting all
 opposition groups to join in
 planning for a nationwide
 peaceful strike and a similar
 provisional government.
 The ardor of militant op-
 positionists for public demon-
 strations is likely to be damp-
 ened, however, by the rigorous
 treatment accorded those  ac-
 cused of complicity in the un-
 successful general strike of
 June 1959.  Widespread arrests
 were made at the time, and se-
 vere,pri'son                         sentences were
 meted out by military courts
 to several persons--mostly So-
 cialists and Communists and
 including a former diplomat,
 Julio Ceron--on charges of
 having instigated "military
 rebellion."
 The achievement of finan-
 cial stability has been attend-
 ed by a lag in industrial out-
 put, a reduction in hours of
 work, and a sharp rise in un-
 employment.   Uncertainty over
 the future of the economy is
 making a large sector of the
 business community unwilling to
 increase investment in indus-
 trial plants and machinery.
 Some 250,000 persons--3.2 per-
 cent of the total labor force
 of 7,500,000--are unemployed,
 as compared With some 120,000'at
 the end of 1958.   The overtime
 and incentive pay of workers
 still on the job has also been
 cut.   Such developments have
 had a disproportionate effect
 in Spain, where unusually low
 hourly wage rates have been com-
 pensated for by long hours of
 work and a high degree of job
 security.   Until the beginning
 of the stabilization program,
 it was extremely difficult to
 dismiss regular employees who
 had become surplus.
 Unemployment benefits are
 available to only a portion of
 those workers who have been
 laid off or are working part

 workers discharged as the re-

 WESTERN AID TO LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
 Western nations are seek-
 ing to coordinate their capital
 exports in order to increase
 the effectiveness of free-world
 economic aid to less-developed
 countries.  Although such assist-
 ance is estimated to exceed $5
 billion annually--considerably
 more than the cumulative total
 of bloc economic and military
 aid from 1954 to date--its ef-
 fectiveness in East-West com-
 petition is greatly impaired by
 lack of coordinated direction
 and insufficient long-term fi-
 nancing. A meeting of eight cap-
 ital-exporting nations beginning
 on 9 March in Washington will
 consider, among other aspects
 of the problem, methods to coor-
 dinate financial contributions
 for priority assistance to coun-
 tries such as India.
 Free-World vs. Bloc Aid
 The need for improved coor-
 dination and longer term financ-
 ing of Western aid is emphasized
 by the growth of the Communist
 bloc's aid program and by pay-
 ments imbalances largely attrib-
 utable to the disproportionately
 large share of the foreign as-
 sistance burden carried by the
 United States. In the bloc pro-
 gram--totaling almost $4 billion
 since 1954--purely economic aid
 reached a peak in 1959, is ex-
 pected to rise still higher in
 1960, and is to a large extent
 under unified direction.
 Free-world economic aid,on
 the other hand, is predominantly
 directed bilaterally and is aimed
 largely at achieving commercial
 and investment advantage for
 donor countries.  About 90 per-
 cent of Western Europe's annual
 $1 billion foreign development
 assistance goes to colonial
 territories or to countries with
 which the contributing nation is
 affiliated in some way.   Further-
 more, the failure of Western Eu-

 capital exports--despite their
 sizable monetary reserves--is
 an important element in recent
 free-world payments imbalances.
 It is estimated that about
 half the $3.4 billion decline
 in the United States' gold stocks
 in 1958-59 resulted from payments
 to Western Europe of gold and
 dollars by less-developed coun-
 tries.   Substantial proportions
 of these means of payment had
 been obtained as earnings from
 exports to the United States or
 in the form of grants or loans
 from the United States, the In-
 ternational Bank for Reconstruc-
 tion and Development  (IBRD),  or
 the International Monetary Fund
 (IMF).
 Problems of
 Coordination
 The industrial
 nations of the free
 world all participate
 in the expanding ac-
 tivities of the IMF,
 the IBRD, and the
 IBRD's prospective
 affiliate, the Inter-
 national Development
 Association (IDA).
 Their governments gen-
 erally agree that they
 should contribute a
 larger share of the
 aid to less-developed
 countries and relieve

 some of the burden now borne by
 the United States.   However,most
 industrial nations have them-
 selves only recently been aid
 recipients and are preoccupied
 with preserving their own eco-
 nomic and financial gains. Thus
 they hesitate to extend aid on
 a scale and on terms appropriate
 to their present means.
 West Germany, for example,
 with its spectacular economic
 growth and formidable exchange
 reserves, confines its foreign
 assistance largely to govern-
 ment-guaranteed, private,short-
 term credits which promote its
 own exports.   Last month  a
 ities in both the Executive Com-
 mission and the European Invest-
 ment Bank of the European Eco-
 nomic Community (EEC) favor glo-
 bal development assistance not
 tied to exports.  However, of-
 ficials in EEC member countries,
 particularly France, may success-
 fully oppose them and, instead,,
 direct EEC financial resources
 mainly to associated areas in
 Africa and to Greece and Turkey.

 SLOVAKIA'S AUTONOMY GRADUALLY DISAPPEARING
 Slovakia's long-standing
 semiautonomous position with-
 in the Czechoslovak state has
 been weakened by several re-
 cent policy decisions in Prague,
 the most important of which
 was the administrative down-
 grading of Slovakia's capital,
 Bratislava. The Slovak party
 paper is no longer the only
 authoritative Communist daily
 appearing in Slovakian, and
 Bratislava has lost its con-
 trol over Slovak-language pub-
 lishing houses. These moves
 appear to be important steps
 toward ending Slovak autonomy
 within the next few years.
 Slovak Separatism
 The people of  Slovakia
 have always had strong separa-
 tist and fierce nationalistic
 tendencies which have from
 time to time cropped up with-
 in the Slovak Communist party
 itself. The Slovak populace,
 including many elements of the
 party, oppose integration into
 the Czechoslovak state. Prague
 has thus found it necessary to
 undertake long and careful
 propaganda campaigns justify-
 ing each step it has taken
 against Slovak autonomy, and
 to criticize openly any opposi-
 tion to these moves.

 The meeting on 9 March is

 Germany
 PRAGUE
 (PRAHA)
 Slovakia is officially de-
 scribed by Prague and Brati-
 slava as a "nation" and pos-
 sesses party and government
 organizations separate from,
 but subordinate to, those of
 Czechoslovakia.   This status
 derived from a combination of
 historical tradition and Com-
 munist political expediency in
 the years immediately follow-
 ing World War II.
 Modern-day Slovakia's
 autonomous status had its birth
 in the United States at Pitts-
 burgh in 1918, when Czech- and
 Slovak-Americans met to formu-
 late
 the principles of
 a com-
 bined
 Czech and Slovak
 state.
 This
 group advocated a
 federa-
 tion
 in which each nation would
 have
 equal status,  including
 its own administrative system,
 parliament, and courts, as well
 as recognition of its own lan-
 guage.   When the Czechoslovak
 state actually came into exist-
 ence, however, the central
 government in Prague had more
 centralized powers than those
 outlined in the Pittsburgh
 agreement, and Slovak adminis-
 trative offices and education-
 al institutions were staffed
 with over 9,000 Czechs.

 O
 This action by Prague
 gave rise to a political move-
 ment of strong separatist per-
 suasion, the Slovak Populist
 party, led by Andrew Hlinka.
 The party championed the Pitts-
 burgh principles of autonomy,
 even at the cost of destroying
 the Czechoslovak state.   The
 Populists gained increasing
 numbers of sympathizers and ad-
 herents as Prague persecuted
 their leaders and procrasti-
 nated on promises of greater
 autonomy.   As this dispute
 sharpened through the 1930s,
 Hitler's pressures on Czecho-
 slovakia grew to major propor-
 tions, culminating in the Munich
 conference of 1938.
 Immediately following
 Munich, six Slovak political
 parties joined in declaring
 full autonomy, and their de-
 mands were met by Prague.   In
 1939 the independent Slovak
 state was created under Hitler's
 aegis, and existed--at his suf-
 ferance--until 1944.
 During the Slovak uprising
 against the Germans in 1944, a
 Slovak National Council was
 constituted as an ad hoc parlia-
 mentary body that administered

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 the area until the Czechoslovak
 nation, supported by Moscow
 and the Allies, could get on
 its feet after the war.   This
 Slovak National Council spoke
 for Slovakia at the formative
 Kosice meeting in April 1945
 which adopted a national-front
 program for Czechoslovakia's
 first government after World
 War II.
 At this time the Czecho-
 slovak Communists split into
 two parties:   Slovak and Czecho-
 slovak.   The major effect of
 this was to gain for the Com-
 munists 'twice  the  number
 of cabinet posts held by any
 other party in the newly
 formed central government. As
 the national-front government
 began to centralize control,
 the Communist parties became
 proponents of Slovak autonomy;
 this helped them gain signif-
 icant popular support in Slo-
 vakia and consequently to gar-
 ner enough votes to gain polit-
 ical strength for the 1948
 coup.
 After the Communist coup,
 Slovakia was given autonomy,
 but more in form than substances
 leaving the Slovak populace
 and many Slovak Communist par-
 ty members bitterly disap-
 pointed.   Prague then was faced
 with the problem of a Slovak
 Communist party heavily infil-
 trated with separatists--a
 problem which Prague has strug-
 gled with ever since.   The
 facade of Slovak autonomy that
 has been preserved to date tes-
 tifies to the continuing
 strength of separatist feeling
 among Slovaks.   Prague has been
 unable to break down these
 separatist and nationalistic
 sentiments, despite numerous purges
 and an ambitious industrial-
 ization program designed in
 part to extend Prague's con-
 trol in Slovakia.
 The Erosion of Autonomy
 Bratislava received equal
 rank with Prague in the admin-
 istrative setup created in 1948.
 Both cities were given the
 status of a region--the largest
 geographic-administrative di--
 vision in the country--and no
 other cities shared this rank,
 The January 1960 plenum of the
 central committee of the Czecho-
 slovak party, however, announced
 details of a reorganization of
 the territorial administration
 of the country which is to be
 carried out this year.   Under
 this new system, the city of
 Bratislava has been downgraded
 to a district, the second larg-
 est division of the country,
 while the city of Prague retains
 a rank equal to that of a region.
 Three other cities in the Czech
 lands have been given rank
 equal to Bratislava.
 On 1 January, the Czecho-
 slovak Communist party daily,
 Rude Pravo, began to publish
 a special Slovak edition in
 Bratislava with Slovak party
 affairs as one of its special
 features.   Formerly the Slovak
 party paper Bratislava Pravda,
 which' is still being publi
 stood alone as the authoritative
 press voice on Slovak party
 affairs.
 In addition, the Slovak
 and Czech publishing associa-
 tions--the two trusts control-
 ling individual publishing
 houses--have been merged into
 one central organization lo-
 cated in Prague, according to
 a Bratislava radio announcement
 on 9 January.   Thus Prague has
 seized complete control over
 the vast bulk of published
 material for Slovakia.
 Prospects
 These developments sug-
 gest that Prague believes that

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 the full integration of Slo-
 vakia is possible fairly soon.
 The gradual erosion of Slovak
 autonomy will be furthered both
 by the recent party campaign
 to perfect "democratic central-
 ism" and by the construction
 in Slovakia of an ever-growing
 number of industrial enterprises
 controlled from Prague,   Prague
 has always moved cautiously,
 SECRET
 pressing the population at the
 maximum pace consistent with
 domestic peace, and it can be
 expected to act in this manner
 on the question of Slovak inte-
 gration.   Barring a miscalcula-
 tion, Prague will probably
 succeed in the next few years
 in wiping out all visible ves-
 tiges of Slovak autonomy.
