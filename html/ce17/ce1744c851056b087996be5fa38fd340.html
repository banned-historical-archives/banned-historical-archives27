 the complex world in which we dive.  But It
 is far better to have ideals and targets toward
 which all of us work, rather than to have no
 idealism at all.  We must mix idealism with
 realism.  Many minds must be brought to
 bear on establishing the goals toward which
 we work and a program through which to
 attain them.
 An ideology combines a way of life with a
 way of governing.  By truly practicing de-
 mocracy as a way of life at home, we can
 insure that our example will advance de-
 mocracy abroad.  By dedicated application
 of democracy as a way of government, we can
 further democracy in world affairs through
 official policy. If democracy by example and
 policy guides our behavior within America
 and on the global stage, the promise of lib-
 erty and the dignity of man will be within
 the reach of us all.
 WITH WITHDRAWAL OF U.S. MA-
 RINES  FROM  THE  DOMINICAN
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  Mr. Presi-
 dent, last Thursday President Johnson
 announced that he was ordering with-
 drawal of the remainder of our marines
 from, the Dominican Republic. This
 Nation and the world owe an everlasting
 debt of gratitude to those courageous men
 of the U.S. Marines who moved to evacu-
 ate innocent foreign nationals, including
 citizens of the,United States, from the
 civil warfare that raged in Santo Do-
 mingo at the time of President Johnson's
 decision to send in the marines.
 The marines protected many persons
 who were not citizens of the Dominican
 Republic, and fears that the United
 States was aiming a long-range occupa-
 tion of the island were wholly unjustified.
 . In no way do I mean to diminish the
 fine work, done by the 82d Airborne Di-
 vision. These courageous soldiers still are
 on duty to prevent unnecessary blood-
 shed and to assure the people of the
 Dominican Republic that the revolt does
 not result in another Communist regime
 like that in Cuba. We are merely there
 to see that the people of the Dominican
 Republic are guaranteed free elections
 and other democratic processes.
 Mr. President, at that time there was
 a great hue and cry from some sources
 about a return to the earlier days when
 the United States did, upon some occa-
 sions, use the Marines for long-term oc-
 cupation of certain places in Latin
 America. It is understandable that the
 peoples of Latin America might fear such
 a thing.  They were, of course, encour-
 aged in that fear by the Communist
 propagandists-as they are always en-
 couraged to criticize and malign the
 United States.
 In our own country, however, there
 was no such excuse, and yet we heard
 then, and we hear now, voices within
 our own councils which say much the
 same thing.  I hope that President John-
 son's action in withdrawing the marines
 at the earliest possible moment will tend
 to still these voices, which are essentially
 the voices of dissension and division, at
 a time when the President is facing so
 many critical and delicate situations
 throughout the world.
 President Johnson is a man of reason
 and restraint, dealing one after the other
 No. 104--13
 Approved For Release 2003/10/15 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000300180029-9
 with crises which are thrust upon him,
 and dealing with them with tolerance,
 patience, and the judicious use of the
 great military power and tremendous re-
 sources of this mighty Nation.
 President Johnson found that this ac-
 tion was necessary to save the lives of
 the foreign civilians who were there-
 citizens of this country, and citizens of
 other countries-who were caught in
 this sudden and brutal outburst of vio-
 lence, which was growing rapidly more
 savage and uncontrolled.
 Armed gangs were running through
 public rooms and corridors of the prin-
 cipal hotel which housed our representa-
 tives and those of other countries, firing
 rifles and submachineguns through the
 walls and windows.  Our Ambassador,
 and I think he showed great good sense
 in his action under the circumstances,
 took the telephone and went under-
 ground. He got down under the desk in
 order to continue reporting to the Presi-
 dent and the Secretary of State.
 It is indeed surprising that, despite all
 that was going on then, and all that
 has gone on since, not one national of
 another country lost his life.  The ma-
 rines went ashore instantly, established
 the  necessary  sanctuaries,    protected
 them, and arranged for the orderly evac-
 uation of those who wished to leave,
 There was not a single life of a foreign
 national or visitor lost.
 One of those who criticized our actions
 in sending in the marines was President
 de Gaulle of France. It is worth noting,
 however, that this did not prevent the
 French Ambassador to the Dominican
 Republic from taking advantage of our
 protection for French citizens, and, in
 fact, the protection zone was enlarged to
 include the French Embassy after the
 marines had already taken up their
 positions.
 I wish it were possible to say that there
 were no lives lost, and no injured and
 wounded, as a result of this necessary
 action, Mr. President, but unhappily this
 cannot be said.  Eight fine marines have
 died,and 29 have paid in lesser measure
 for the success of this operation.  We
 should all pay our homage today to these
 young men, and express our sympathies
 with their families and friends who now
 will miss them in the intimate ways that
 always accompanyy such tragedies.
 While our purpose in entering Santo
 Domingo was to protect our own citizens
 and the citizens of other countries, we
 were certainly very much concerned
 about the circumstances and conditions
 prevailing for the people of this island.
 At the time the marines landed, the
 people of the island were caught between
 the two forces.  They were bombed and
 strafed in the streets of Santo Domingo;
 they were starving.  Many of them were
 being put up against the wall and shot.
 The sanitary conditions were the cause
 of serious concern for the health of the
 people, and widespread epidemics were
 feared.
 Much of this has now changed.  We
 have brought in food and have assisted
 in bringing about arrangements which
 give hope of stabilizing the situation, at
 least for the helpless noncombatants.
 12527
 We are providing funds for the neces-
 sary governmental services and operation
 of other vital institutions.
 We still have troops in the Dominican
 Republic, but they are there now in asso-
 ciation and cooperation with the ma-
 jority of the members of the Organiza-
 tion of American States.  We are joining_
 fully in the efforts to reach some po-
 litical solution of the difficult problems
 which still exist.  Our objective will con-
 tinue to be to find this solution, and to
 withdraw the remainder of our forces
 from the island.
 President Johnson has given concrete
 evidence of the peaceful course he will
 pursue by withdrawing the marines.
 There is no doubt whatsoever that Presi-
 dent Johnson's future actions will be folly
 in keeping with his order of last Thurs-
 day.
 Mr. GRUENING.  Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  I yield.
 Mr. GR(ENING.  I am happy to say
 that I heartily approve of the Presi-
 dent's policy in the Dominican Republic
 to date. I feel he had to act as he did.
 He said so from the very start.  He
 moved first to save American lives and,
 second, to prevent what he feared might
 be a Communist takeover-both wholly
 worthy and commendable objectives.
 Third, he moved as rapidly as possible
 to make the problem a multilateral af-
 fair, with the assistance and cooperation
 of our sister American Republics, by call-
 ing on the Organization of American
 States to come in and help work out
 the Dominican problem.
 If out of this tragic situation in the
 Dominican Republic we can get a per-
 manent peacekeeping force in the Amer-
 icas, in which the United States will be
 merely one of a number of nations coop-
 erating, I feel definitely that we shall
 have brought about an event of lasting
 significance and a great turning point in
 the history of the Americas.
 For that reason I believe the Presi-
 dent's policy, both on the immediate
 range and on the long range, are highly
 commendable.  He deserves unqualified
 praise.  I am happy to say this because
 of the fact that I do not agree with our
 policy in southeast Asia.
 I thank the Senator for yielding to me.
 Mr. President, I now should like to
 speak on my own time for a little more
 than 3 minutes.
 The  PR SIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.
 COOPER in the chair). How much time
 does the Senat  desire?
 Mr. GRUEN NG.  About 10 minutes.
 The PRES   ING OFFICER. Without
 objecti?rl, t i Senator may proceed.
 THE MESS IN VIETNAM XVII: THE
 STEADILY WIDENING WAR
 Mr. GRUENING.  Mr. President, in its
 leading editorial this morning entitled
 "Ground War in Asia," the New York
 Times states :
 The American people were told by a minor
 State Department official yesterday that, in
 effect, they were in a land war on the conti-
 nent of Asia.  This is only one of the ex-
 traordinary aspects of the first, formal? an-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE             June 9, 1965
 nouncement that a decision has been made
 to commit American ground forces to open
 combat in South Vietnam: The Nation is in-
 formed about it not by the President, not. by
 a Cabinet member, not even by a sub-Cabinet
 official, but by a public relations officer.
 There is still no explanation offered for
 a :move that fundamentally alters the char-
 acter of the American Involvement in Viet-
 nam.  A program of weapons supply, train-
 ing and combat advice to South Vietnamese,
 initiated by Presidents Eisenhower and Ken-
 nedy, has now been transformed by President
 Johnson  into  an  American  war  against
 Asians.
 The  editorial
 question:
 Is  it not more likely that political ir-
 responsibility  in Saigon will                       grow, rather
 than decline, as the main military responsi-
 bility for defending South Vietnam is trans-
 ferred increasingly to American hands?
 And concludes:
 The country deserves answers to this and
 many other questions.  It has been taken
 into a ground war by Presidential decision,
 when there is no emergency that would seem
 to rule out congressional debate.  The duty
 now is for reassurance from the White House
 that the Nation will be informed on where
 it is being led and that Congress will be con-
 sulted before another furious upward whirl
 is taken on the escalation spiral.
 The American people deserve and
 should get straight answers from the
 administration as to just where we are
 going in Vietnam. It deserves more than
 mislabeling  as  "advisers"  American
 Armed Forces personnel who have for
 quite some time now been in the front-
 line of the fighting in South Vietnam.
 It deserves more than statements that
 our marines are in South Vietnam only
 as defensive troops to protect our bases.
 I ask unanimous consent that the edi-
 torial from today's New York Times en-
 titled "Ground War in Asia" be printed
 in the RECORD at the conclusion of my
 remarks.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Without
 objection, it is so ordered.

 sufficiently lopsided vote to assure history
 that the 89th Congress had supported es-
 calation in the Pacific Whether It knew what
 it was doing or not.
 This same growing unrest in the Con-
 gress and its questioning of the wisdom
 of itsabdication of a voice in the conduct
 of our foreign policy is noted by the New
 York Times in its leading editorial on
 June 7, 1965, entitled "Congress and
 Vietnam" which begins:
 Signs are growing of congressional interest
 in ending the leave-it-to-Lyndon era in
 American foreign policy.
 The Founding Fathers intended the
 framing of our foreign policy to be a
 `partnership between the executive and
 the legislative branches of the Federal
 Government with each acting as co-
 equals.
 We are now seeing the harmful effects
 of treating the formulation of foreign
 policy as the exclusive prerogative of the
 executive branch of the Government.
 The editorial in the New Bork Times
 contains the following observations:
 Factors that go beyond the President's
 limited experience in foreign affairs and the
 extraordinary vacillations in Dominican pol-
 icy have set off the present questioning at
 home and abroad.  The reluctance of Secre-
 tary of State Rusk to employ the full re-
 sources of his Department and give inde-
 pendent advice, the meager use made by the
 President of nonofficial task forces In the
 foreign policy field, the overdependence on
 military and intelligence agencies and the
 divorce between the administration and the
 Nation's intellectuals-all point to a need
 for more vigorous congressional Interest.
 Nowhere is this more vital than on Viet-
 nam, where grave constitutional questions
 are raised by the official acknowledgment of
 an Increasing combat role  for American
 troops.  During the 18 months of, the John-
 son administration, the number of American
 .troops in Vietnam has been tripled to about
 46,500; a further buildup to more than
 60,000 appears imminent.  American planes
 have entered Into combat both in South and
 North Vietnam-in the latter case openly
 attacking a foreign country with no declara-
 tion of war.  American warships have bom-
 barded the North 'Vietnamese coast.  And
 there are indications that American ground
 troops-first employed as advisers in South
 Vietnam, then deployed to defend American
 Installations and now directly engaged in
 patrolling action-will soon take on a full
 combat role as a tactical reserve aiding South
 Vietnamese units in trouble.
 Yet at no point has there been significant
 Congressional discussion, much less direct
 authorization of what amounts to a deci-
 sion to wage war.  That Is why 28 Demo-
 cratic Congressmen,    on  the  initiative  of
 Representative ROSENTHAL, of Queens, now
 have  wisely  asked the chairman  of the
 House Foreign -Affairs Committee to hold
 public  hearings  on the  administration's
 Vietnam policy.
 American casualties in Vietnam, while
 still relatively minor, already exceed those
 of the Spanish-American War,  The choices
 open to the President are exceedingly diffi-
 cult ones;  they should not be his alone,
 either as a matter of sound policy or of con-
 stitutional obligation.  If he takes it upon
 himself to: make an American war out of
 the Vietnamese tragedy,  without  seeking
 congressional and national consent, he may
 open the country to divisions  even more
 dangerous than those that developed out of
 the Xoreaxi conflict.
 I ask unanimous consent that the en-
 tire editorial from the New York Times
 for June 7, 1965, entitled "Congress and
 Vietnam" be printed at the conclusion
 of my remarks.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER..  With-

 (See exhibit 2.)
 Mr. GR'[JENING.  ITow singularly in-
 dividualistic the war in Vietnam has
 become was commented on by colum-
 nist Drew Pearson in his column in the
 Washington Post on June 4, 1965, under
 the heading "President Johnson's Per-
 sonal War."  Mr. Pearson states:
 The war in Vietnam has also become a
 lonely war and to some extent a personal
 war for one man. *  ^  * It's become per-
 sonal today, because the President feels It
 so keenly and directs it so carefully.  Every
 morning at 3 he wakes up and calls the
 White House security room,  Three in the
 morning is about the time the news is in
 from Vietnam on the casualties and the
 hits after each bombing raid.
 Mr. Pearson concludes this portion of
 his article as follows:.
 The North Vietnamese have been winning.
 Our bombing raids have not stopped the sup-
 ply of troops and supplies from going south
 or the guerrilla raids by the Vietcong.
 The Russians, who normally might have
 acted as intermediaries, were put on the spot
 by our bombing of the north.  The Chinese
 have chided them with being too friendly to
 the United States in the past, and with for-
 saking their alleged former role as the cham-
 pion of small nations.  So it's difficult for
 them to side with the United States now.
 The Chinese are delighted at the predica-
 ment of both Moscow and Washington.  They
 don't want the Vietnamese war to end, The
 longer it lasts, the more the United States
 and Russia become at swords' points, and the
 more the smaller nations of southeast Asia
 pull away from the United States Into the
 Red  Chinese  camp.
 In brief, the military advisers who sold
 the President on the strategy of bombing
 North Vietnam failed to understand oriental
 politics.  Though he inherited the Vietnam-
 ese problem, they sold him on enlarging
 it into a mess that could either lead to
 world war or is almost insoluble without se-
 rious loss of face,
 I ask unanimous consent that the en-

 Mr. GRUENING.. An excellent series
 of articles on Vietnam recently appeared
 in the New York Herald Tribune. They
 were written for the New York Herald
 Tribune by its special correspondent
 Beverly Deepe from Saigon.
 I ask unanimous consent that Beverly
 Deepe's articles appearing in the New
 York Herald 't'ribune on May 30, May 31,
 June 1, June 2, June 3, and June 4, 1965,
 be printed in the RECORD at the conclu-
 sion of my remarks.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit 4.)
 Mr. GRUENING.  Communism can-
 not be fought with nothing.
 A strong, capable, noncorrupt govern-
 ment in_ Saigon., has been needed for
 years to bring about the social and
 economic reforms sg necessary to show
 12529
 the people of South Vietnam that they
 can have liberty and economic and social
 justice.
 But BeverlyDeepe's articles show why
 needed reforms were thwarted.
 In her fifth article she discusses the
 long delay in land reform and how the
 government at Saigon was playing the
 landlord's game:
 "The most important question in the Viet-
 namese countryside besides security is land
 reform," an American technician said, "yet
 virtually nothing has been done about it.
 "The Vietcong are gaining a lot of points
 with the peasants by simply Issuing land
 titles-and it  costs  them  nothing.   They
 take the land from the landowner and give
 it away.  Nothing we give to the peasants-
 like pigs, insecticides, or fertilizer-is as im-
 portant as land."
 American technicians and provincial offi-
 cials for the past several years have urged
 the implementation of an effective land re-
 form   program.    Two  land  distribution
 schemes currently have been written, but
 neither has been accepted.  Higher officials
 of the American Embassy and In the Agency
 for International Development believe land
 reform is  not the panacea for Vietnam's
 problems.
 A program for the training of land-reform
 cadre is under consideration.  But the pro-
 gram will not be instituted until the other
 day-when the Vietcong Communists have
 been defeated.
 WARNING
 However, one Vietnamese general recently
 warned American generals and officials that
 American-backed efforts to pacify the prov-
 inces would fail unless they were linked with
 land reform.
 "When the Vietnamese National Army goes
 back to pacify areas from the Vietcong, the
 local landowner goes back with them, offer-
 ing to serve as intelligence agent," the gen-
 eral explained.  "Obviously he wants to col-
 lect his back rent.  So when the army paci-
 fies the area It pacifies it for the landowner
 and not for the peasant.
 "Of course, 35 percent of the peasants are
 landless.   They become 'fanatics  and will
 fight for the land given them by the Viet-
 cong because it's as important to them as
 life."
 One U.S. official described as "horror
 stories" the actions of some landowners
 to collect back rent, once Government
 forces had pacified Vietcong areas.
 According to reliable sources, in other
 cases, when the Vietnamese Government
 Army attempts to pacify the area, the
 commanders simply ignore the problems
 of land reform, refusing to collect back
 rents-but also refusing to confirm the
 landownership rights.
 In Vietcong-controlled areas, if land-
 owners or their agents return to collect
 back rent the matter is simple.  The
 peasant complains to the Vietcong, and
 the agent is shot.
 "The  question of land  reform is quite
 simple," one low-ranking Vietnamese pro-
 vincial official explained.  "The government
 represents the landowners; the ministers and
 generals are either landowners or friends of
 landowners.   The  Catholic  Church owns
 land.  The Buddhist Church owns land. No-
 body, is interested in, fighting for the poor
 peasant.  And the top Americans-well, they
 talk to only the ministers and rich people
 so they don't push it either."
 Beverly Deepe in her fourth article
 describes "How the United States Built
 on the Quicksand of Asian Politics," She
 says:

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE             June 9, 1965
 Since November 1963, the country has been
 in a state of political crisis.   Sources in
 Saigon now argue that it would be a mistake
 to rebuild  a  counterideology-even if it
 could be done.  They say instead that the
 Saigon government must reform itself and
 "out-revolutionize the Communists-but do
 ii; 10 times better and 50 times faster than
 the Communists themselves."
 The dilemma of American policymakers is
 the schizophrenic nature of the Vietnamese
 society itself.  The governing class is gener-
 ally urban-based, French-educated with an
 aristocratic position based on either family
 background, money or landownership.       This
 -elite minority attempts to govern the masses
 although it knows little about them and is
 concerned less.
 After 10 years of administering the largest
 U.S.  medical  aid  program  in  the  world,
 American officials here still have little in-
 fluence on Vietnamese medical affairs.                         One
 American-trained      Vietnamese  doctor  said
 that a medical degree from an American
 medical school still is not readily recognized
 in Vietnam, on the other hand, a "parachute
 degree"-a  degree     virtually   bought  with
 money from a second-rate medical school in
 France-is easily acceptable by "the Mafia."
 The two best hospitals in Saigon are
 French operated.  They are also the most
 expensive. There is no good American hos-
 pital in Saigon for the Vietnamese popula-
 tion                               (although  there  are  two  American-
 operated hospitals in France).  Requests by
 the               American-operated Seventh Day Ad-
 ventist Missionary Hospital to expand their
 30-bed clinic have repeatedly been refused.
 American officials in Saigon have not ef-
 fectively pressured the Saigon government
 to correct "this rot within," in the words of
 a Vietnamese  anti-Communist.  Instead,
 they have superimposed upon the rot a spec-
 tacular medical program in the provinces.
 "The Americans think we should fight for
 democracy," one young Vietnamese intellec-
 tual explained.                "But, in fact, the Vietcong
 fight because of the lack of democracy."
 But her most devastating article is
 entitled:  "Corruption-Hottest Saigon
 Issue" and shows how corruption on high
 in Saigon-winked at and ignored by
 U.S. officials-was and is one of the
 causes for effective support of the Gov-
 ernment                        at  the  grassroots--support
 which is essential.
 The article states, in part:
 The hottest issue in Saigon is not bombing
 Hanoi, nor Vietcong terrorism, nor possible
 negotiations for peace.  It is corruption.
 Vietnamese   sources-generals,   majors.
 captains, ex-ministers, economists--say that
 corruption has now reached scandalous, un-
 precedented proportions.
 Highly placed sources in Saigon-Ameri-
 can, Vietnamese, and Western-urged tighter
 controls on Vietnamese Government funds
 and on American aid and goods.
 The issue is considered a gift for the Viet-
 cong Communists, who promise the workers
 and peasants justice and equality.  It also
 has caused friction within the Vietnamese
 Government and armed forces.
 One high-ranking American official in the
 U.S. Agency for International Development
 (AID) reportedly estimated that 30'percent
 of American economic aid was unreceipted
 or unaccounted for last year. Alow-echelon
 American provincial official says some of the
 45 Vietnamese provinces had not - submitted
 vouchers for expenditures during the past 3
 years.
 The originalpurpose of American advisers
 was to train Vietnamese to use the equip-
 ment-"and to keep track of the equipment,
 which sometimes took some doing," one
 American captain who worked on the pro-
 gram for 2 years said.
 "We brought in air conditioners for hos-
 pitals-they ended up in the general's house.
 We brought in hospital refrigerators to store
 vaccines in.  The vaccines spoiled and the
 refrigerators wound  up in the  general's
 house."
 These are the comments  and criticisms
 which the highly placed sources in Saigon
 made about the commercial import program
 and sales of farm surplus commodities.
 First, according to one Vietnamese eco-
 nomist and ex-minister, economic aid doesn't
 aim at an economic target, but is only in
 support of a military machine.  About four-
 fifths of the U.S.-generated piastres in 1964
 were allocated to support the Vietnamese
 military budget.
 CONSPICUOUS WEALTH
 Second, the commercial import program
 has enriched and enlarged the upper middle
 class elements in Saigon and, other cities, but
 it has also accentuated the extremes between
 the urban and rural classes.  Often you bring
 in a whole lot of things for the richer mid-
 dle class with conspicuous consumption, and
 the Vietcong can play on this, saying it en-
 riches the middle class and bourgeois, one
 Western ambassador said.
 Third, the rural communities, especially
 earlier in the program, received a relatively
 small proportion of the commercial import
 aid.  Between 1955 and 1960, when the Viet-
 cong began organizing and recruiting in the
 countryside, only 4 percent of the direct and
 indirect American aid was funneled into the
 rural population, which is an estimated 85
 percent of the total population.
 Fourth, the commercial import program
 has not been geared to assist the building
 of industries which funnel Vietnamese agri-
 cultural products into the light industrial
 sector.  During the critical period of Viet-
 cong formation in the countryside, from 1955
 to 1960, American economic aid assisted in
 the establishment  of  58  companies.   But
 about 70 percent of these depended on im-
 ported raw materials: even the papermills
 needed to import woodpulp.
 The Vietnamese officials have therefore de-
 vised an effective system of padding their
 vouchers and receipts.
 "Suppose a wooden bridge costs 1,600 plas-
 ters to build," an American district adviser
 complained, "the contractor adds another
 200 piasters and the district chief adds an-
 other 200 piasters.  I can practically see the
 money flow into their pockets, but they give
 me a receipt for 2,000 plasters.  What can I
 do to disprove them?"
 One Vietnamese province chief under the
 Ngo Dinh Diem regime admitted he ordered
 a few of his loyal troops to blow up his own
 bridge that was half constructed so that
 they could let another construction contract.
 Some  Vietnamese regional  and regular
 units are known to possess phantom troops-
 troops that never existed, or were killed or
 deserted but never reported as lost.  Their
 paychecks slip into the hands of privileged
 commanders.
 "What it boils down to is whether to have
 a social revolution or not and clean up this
 government," a Vietnamese economists ex-
 plained.  If America is too scared to do it-
 the Communists will, and will win the people.
 The people want justice.  They don't care
 if they have a democracy or a dictatorship-
 if the government comes in with bullets or
 ballots. But they want justice-even if it
 is harsh. The Vietcong are harsh, but they
 are just.
 The basic conclusion arrived at in this
 excellent series is summed up at the be-
 ginning of the second article:
 U.S. policy in South Vietnam is frozen in
 a negative posture that concentrates on mil-
 itary victory while failing to produce the
 sort of dramatic political strategy that would
 make such victory possible.
 This, at least, is the opinion of highly
 placed sources in Saigon who have watched
 the American involvement here grow stead-
 ily for more than a decade.
 In their view, the U.S. attitude is essen-
 tially  anti-Communist  rather  than  pro-
 something.   The      overwhelming impression
 is that the American policymakers are at-
 tempting to stem the tide of Communist
 aggression or to teach Hanoi a lesson. But
 this implies a political status quo in a coun-
 try that is changing in its post-colonial de-
 velopment,  and  is,  indeed,  fighting   for
 change.
 "Nothing negative has ever prevailed over
 something positive," the Western military
 expert commented. One of the most fre-
 quently asked questions by Vietnamese cap-
 tains and majors on the battlefront is "What
 are we fighting for?" as they look at the
 political turmoil in their rear area at Saigon.
 I  ask  unanimous consent that the
 article by Mr. Richard Starnes and Mal-
 colm W. Browne be printed at the con-
 clusion of my remarks.

 EXHIBIT 1
 [From the New York Times, June 9, 19651
 GROUND WAR IN ASIA
 The American people were told by a minor
 State Department official yesterday that, in
 effect, they were in a land war on the con-
 tinent of Asia.  This  is only one of the
 extraordinary aspects of the first formal an-
 nouncement that a decision has been made
 to commit American ground forces to open
 combat in South Vietnam.  The Nation is
 informed about it not by the President, not
 by a Cabinet member, not even by a sub-
 Cabinet official, but by a public relations
 officer.
 There is still no explanation offered for a
 move that fundamentally alters the char-
 acter of the- American - involvement in Viet-
 nam.                                                                                                                              A program of weapons supply, train-
 ing and combat advice to South Vietnamese,
 initiated by Presidents Eisenhower and Ken-
 nedy, has now been transformed by Presi-
 dent Johnson into an American war against
 Asians.
 It was the bombing of North Vietnam that
 led, in turn, to the use of American jet air-
 craft in South Vietnam and the emplace-
 ment of American marines and paratroops
 to  defend  American  airbases.  Now,  with
 American air support hampered by the mon-
 soon rains, American ground troops are to be
 made available as a tactical reserve to help
 South Vietnamese units in trouble.
 It can all be made to sound like a gradual
 and inevitable outgrowth  of earlier  com-
 mitments.  Yet the whole development has
 occurred in a 4-month span, just after an
 election in which the administration cam-
 paigned on the issue of its responsibility and
 restraint in foreign military involvements.
 Since March, American forces in Vietnam
 have been more than doubled to 52,000, as
 compared to 14,000 when President Johnson
 took office.  Additional troops are moving in
 and a buildup to 70,000 is indicated.  There
 has been neither confirmation nor denial for

 According to prisoners in the older group,
 once they returned to South Vietnam in the
 late 1950's, they were surprised at what they
 found.  They had been told the south must
 be liberated from its own poverty.  One said
 he was astonished to see the Government
 troopers wearing boots.  (Communist troops
 often wear rubber-tire sandals.)
 Another said he had been told that two-
 thirds of South Vietnam had been liberated.
 But when he attacked Government villages
 the peasants fought his men.   They had
 been told they must liberate the south from
 the American imperialists, but soon discov-
 ered they were fighting Vietnamese.
 But few of these veterans defected to the
 government side.  One oldtime propaganda
 agent captured in the south explained that
 he listened to the Voice of America  and
 British Broadcasting Corp. to discover the
 truth.  But he listened to the Hanoi radio
 to find out the correct party line.
 He reasoned that if the party lied, there
 must be a good reason for it.  The party
 knew best.

 for  youth.   "The Vietcong promise   them
 fun-that life will be gay," one source said.
 "Many of those who join believe they get
 this."
 Even if a youth has been forced to join the
 Vietcong, a highly effective indoctrination
 session immediately begins to mold him into
 an enthusiastic, well-disciplined fighter.
 Perhaps, this can be seen in their songs.
 Neil Jamieson, 29, a Vietnamese-speaking
 provincial  representative  from  Gloucester
 City, N.J., translated a number of Vietcong
 songs and talked with incoming Vietcong de-
 fectors.
 One of the songs goes:
 "We are peasants in soldier's clothing, wag-
 ing the struggle for a class oppressed for
 thousands of years; our suffering is the suf-
 fering of the people.
 "Many of their songs are centered on vic-
 tory," Mr. Jamieson said.  "They associate the
 soldiers with the peasants-fighting oppres-
 sion, not only against the foreigners, but also
 the upper classes within society.
 "The troops accept-in fact, glorify-hard-
 ship because it identifies them with the peo-
 ple.  It's almost like old Christianity.  It's
 like little kids' Sunday School hymns-the
 idea of picking up the Cross for Jesus but in-
 stead of a cross it's a pack."
 He said most of the Vietcong songs were
 "upbeat, emphasizing the positive in a Nor-
 man Vincent Peale manner."  Government
 songs were often sad.
 A SPARTAN LIFE
 "The young troops lived a very Spartan
 life," Mr. Jamieson continued.  They were
 short of medicine, and all suffered attacks
 of malaria. Many suffered real hardships. It
 was cold in the jungle, yet they didn't dare
 light a big fire.

 OUR  GrRL IN  VrET-II:  AMERICA'S  FROZEN
 POLICY-VITAL POLITICAL POWER UNUSED
 (By Beverly Deepe)
 SAIGON.-U.S. policy in South Vietnam is
 frozen in a negative posture that concen-
 trates on military victory while failing to
 produce the sort of dramatic political strat-
 egy that would make such victory possible.
 This, at least, is the opinion of highly
 placed sources in Saigon who have watched
 the American involvement here grow steadily
 for more than a decade.
 In their view, the U.S. attitude is essen-
 tially  anti-Communist  rather  than  pro-
 something.   The overwhelming impression
 is that the American policymakers are at-
 tempting to stem the tide of Communist
 aggression or to teach Hanoi a lesson. But
 this implies a political status quo in a coun-
 try  that  is changing in  its  postcolonial
 development and Is, indeed, fighting for
 change.
 "Nothing negative has ever prevailed over
 something positive," the western  military
 expert commented.  "One of the most fre-
 quently asked questions by Vietnamese cap-
 tains and majors on the battlefront is, 'What
 are we fighting for?' as they look at the po-
 litical turmoil in their rear area at Saigon."
 HOLLOW WORDS
 While some Americans in Saigon pay lip-
 service to the                                                                                                                                                                  principles of freedom  and
 democracy, these are, as one American Gov-
 ernment employee noted, "hollow words that
 mean little in Asia."
 A Western diplomat argues that the West-
 ern concepts of democracy and freedom have
 never been simplified and codified as have
 the  Communist  ideology.   There  axe  no
 American primers for democracy as there
 are Communist primers for revolution.
 "One cannot understand these American
 principles unless he has reaped the benefits
 of them or seen them firsthand," the diplo-
 mat explained.  Hence, he said, the princi-
 ples in which Americans believe must be
 translated, demonstrated, and visualized for
 the Vietnamese by the Vietnamese Govern-
 ment, and this has yet to be done.
 The main  political problem during  the
 past decade seems to have been to realize
 there  is  a political  problem  and  to  act
 positively.
 The   American   policymakers, however,
 view the battle in Vietnam as principally, if

 of American economic aid was unreceipted
 or unaccounted for last year.  A low-echelon
 American provincial official says some of the
 45 Vietnamese provinces had not submitted
 vouchers for expenditures during the past 3
 years.
 Another official said that outright corrup-
 tion-American  funds  ending  up  in  the
 pockets of the rich-was probably limited
 to 10 percent. Last year, this would have
 been $233,000.
 One high-ranking Western official angrily
 commented:  "This  is a  major  American
 scandal.  The way American-generated
 funds flow out of this country to Paris-or
 back to America itself-well, it makes your
 hair curl.
 "There  are millions  and  millions of
 piasters that go to France or go to Hong
 Kong-and these piasters are generated by
 American aid funds.  The French have a
 saying in Saigon that every time America
 increases its aid funds there's a new hotel
 on the Champs Elysee."
 FRENCH GIGGLE
 The ambassador of another Western em-
 bassy lamented, "The French stand by, look
 at what you're doing, and giggle."
 American aid falls into two broad cate-
 gories-military and economic.  During the
 past decade $1.1 billion was given to Vietnam
 through the  U.S.  military assistance pro-
 gram.  This program gives guns, ammuni-
 tion, bombs, and other equipment to the
 Vietnamese armed forces.
 The original purpose of American advisers
 was to train Vietnamese to use the equip-
 ment-"and to keep track of the equipment,
 which  sometimes  took  some  doing,"  one
 American captain who worked on the pro-
 gram for 2 years said.
 "We brought in air conditioners for hos-
 pitals-they ended up in the general's house.
 We brought in hospital refrigerators to store
 vaccines in.  The vaccines spoiled and the
 refrigerators wound  up  in  the  general's
 house."
 The second broad category totaling $2.1
 billion during the past decade is the eco-
 nomic aid program administered through the
 AID.
 However, of the 10-year economic aid pro-
 gram, 75 percent has been channeled into
 the commercial import program and sales
 under the food-for-peace program.  It is this
 program, copied from the Marshall plan for
 Europe after World War II, that highly placed
 sources in Saigon believe should be reap-
 praised.
 SPECIAL KITTY
 The  commercial  import  program,     plus
 selling of American farm Surplus goods, calls
 for the importing of goods from America or
 U.S.-authorized.  countries. The  American
 Government pays the exporter in dollars for
 the  goods.  The  Vietnamese  importer  in
 Saigon pays the Vietnamese in piasters.
 These  American-generated     piasters are
 then put in a special kitty belonging to the
 Vietnamese Government.  This counterpart
 fund primarily is used to pay the operating
 expenses of the Vietnamese national armed
 forces and to supplement Vietnam's other
 revenues.
 The total amount of piasters budgeted by
 the Vietnamese Government in 1964 was 37.1
 billion,  but only 31.5  was actually spent
 which created the impression in Saigon, even
 among Vietnamese economists, that "there's
 too much money in Saigon.  We cannot ab-
 sorb It all."

 Second, the commercial import program
 has enriched and enlarged the upper-mid-
 dle-class elements in Saigon and other cities,
 but it has also accentuated the extremes be-
 tween the urban and rural classes.  "Often
 you bring in a whole lot of things for the
 richer middle class with conspicuous con-
 sumption, and the Vietcong can play on
 this, saying it enriches the middle class and
 bourgeois," one Western ambassador said.
 Third, the rural communities, especially
 earlier in the program, received a relatively
 small proportion of the commercial import
 aid. Between 1955 and 1960, when the Viet-
 cong began organizing and recruiting in the
 countryside, only 4 percent of the direct and
 indirect American aid was funneled into the
 rural population, which is an estimated 85
 percent of the total population.
 Fourth, the commercial import program
 has not been geared to assist the building
 of industries which funnel Vietnamese agri-
 cultural products into the light industrial
 sector.  During the critical period of Viet-
 cong formation in the countryside, from 1955
 to 1960, American economic aid assisted in
 the establishment of 58 companies.  But
 about 70 percent of these depended on im-
 ported raw materials; even the paper mills
 needed to import wood pulp.                  has prevented large-scale deficit

 although it knows little about them and is
 concerned less.
 The elite's lack of concern and compas-
 sion was illustrated in an incident related
 by the wife of a Western embassy official.
 The wives of embassy officials had voluntarily
 presented furniture, clothing, and toys to a
 local orphanage.
 "Several days after we handed over the
 goods, one of the embassy wives returned
 to the orphanage," the lady explained.  "We
 were astonished to find the officials had even

 pared to govern.
 "The Americans had to play with the cards

 The diplomat continued:
 "They're on the edges-we're supporting

 MANDARIN SYSTEM
 The lack of justice and equal opportunity
 is perhaps best reflected in the medical pro-

 OUR GIRL IN VIET-V: LAND REFORM-THE
 LONG DELAY
 (By Beverly Deepe)
 SAIGON.-"The most important question in
 the Vietnamese countryside besides security
 is land reform," an American technician said.
 "Yet virtually nothing has been done about
 it.
 "The Vietcong are gaining a lot of points
 with the peasants by simply issuing land
 titles-and  it  costs  them  nothing.  They
 take the land from the landowner and give
 it away.  Nothing we give to the peasants-
 like pigs, insecticides, or fertilizer-is as im-
 portant as land."
 American technicians and provincial offi-
 cials for the past several years have urged
 the implementation of an effective land re-
 form   program.  Two  land   distrilllttion
 schemes currently have been written, but
 neither has been accepted.  Higher officials
 in the American Embassy and in the Agency
 for International Development believe "land
 reform Is not the panacea for Vietnam's
 problems."
 A program for the training of land-reform
 cadre is under consideration.  But the pro-
 gram will not be instituted until "the other
 day"-when the Vietcong Communists have
 been defeated.
 WARNING
 However, one Vietnamese general recently
 warned American generals and officials that
 American-backed efforts to pacify the prov-
 inces would fail unless they were linked with
 land reform.
 "When the Vietnamese National Army goes
 back to pacify areas from the Vietcong, the
 local landowner goes back with them, offer-
 ing to serve as intelligence agent," the gen-
 eral explained.  "Obviously he wants to col-
 lect his back rent.  So when the army pacifies
 the area it pacifies it for the landowner and
 not for the peasant.
 "Of course, 35 percent of the peasants are
 landless.  They become  fanatics  and  will
 fight for the land given them by the Vietcong
 because it's as important to them as life."
 One  U.S.  official  described  as  "horror
 stories" the actions of some landowners to
 collect back rent, once government forces
 had pacified Vietcong areas.
 12535
 not the strength of the Vietcong appeal so
 much as -the accessibility to rural masses
 for Communist recruiting.
 Furthermore, an estimated 30 percent of
 the Vietcong strength recruited in the South
 are considered to belong to the "farm labor
 class," the lowest in the semi-Confucianistic
 rigidly stratified rural society.
 The five rural classes in Vietnamese coun-
 tryside area are: the landowners (who lease
 out all the land they own) ; the rich peasants
 (who own more land than they till, and lease
 out some of It) ; the middle-class peasants
 (who own all they till); the tenant farmers
 (who rent all their lands), and the farm
 laborers  (who cannot rent land, but are
 seasonally hired for planting and harvesting).
 "The      question  of land reform is  quite
 simple,   one low-ranking Vietnamese pro-
 vincial official explained.  "The government
 represents the landowners; the ministers and
 generals are either landowners or friends of
 landowners. The  Catholic  Church      owns
 land.  The  Buddhist Church  owns land.
 Nobody is interested in fighting for the poor
 peasant.  And the top Americans-well, they
 talk to only the ministers and rich people so
 they don't push it either."
 LANDOWNERS
 One Vietnamese general recalled that dur-
 ing the war with the Communists against the
 French in the early fifties, he was ordered
 by imperial decree to have landowners in his
 security district in North Vietnam divide up
 the land with the peasants.  There were two
 large landowners in the area, he recalled, one
 of them ,a Roman Catholic bishop and the
 second a relative of the then Finance Min-
 ister.
 "The Catholic bishop refused to divide the
 land because he said he had to support 2,500
 seminary students with the rent money, and
 the big landowner also refused," the general
 explained.  "I warned them both if they
 didn't give the land to the peasants the
 Communists would take over not only the
 land, but also the seminary and the land-
 owner's house.  But they wouldn't listen.
 The big landowner told the Finance Minis-
 ter what I was doing.  I was quickly trans-
 fered to another place-and 3 years later the
 Communists took over."
 The  land-reform  issue  in Vietnam-in-
 volving not only issuing of land titles, but
 also law enforcement on land rents, land
 security for tenants and fixed rates on the
 interest of borrowing of money-is not con-
 sidered as acute as in other parts of Asia.
 The Japanese say, for example, that a peasant
 without land is like a man without a soul.
 The victory of Chinese Communists in taking
 over mainland China was achieved not so
 much by armed' guerrillas as by the promise
 of  land  to  the  poverty-stricken,  landless
 peasantry.
 "The land for the landless" campaign in
 the  Philippines   virtually  broke  the  back
 of  the   Hukbalahap  insurrection    in   the
 fifties.
 According to reliable sources, the Vietcong
 guerrillas in Vietnam have a haphazard, in-
 consistent land-reform program which varies
 from area to area in sections of the country
 they control.  However, the current govern-
 ment has virtually no program at all.  Ore
 American provincial official estimated that
 the Vietcong had Issued land titles to 50
 percent of the peasant families in his prov-
 ince; the government: had issued none.
 In some areas, the Vietcong take some of
 the land from the rich peasants and give it
 to the landless tenant-who still pays rent,
 to the Vietcong.
 So far, the Vietcong have not killed or
 harassed the rich peasants as they did before
 their seizure of power in North Vietnam.
 In some cases, the Vietcong program in the
 rural areas is considered self-defeating. They

 have made a definite push for higher rents
 as they move toward the mobile warfare
 phase.
 In some areas, Vietcong taxes and indirect
 taxes in rice have doubled over that of last
 year.  In other areas, the Vietcong are known
 to have redistributed the land, increased the
 land tax from 100 to 900 piastres and in-
 creased the rice tax from 50 to 300 piastres.
 In the countryside outside Hue, which has
 lately fallen under their control, the Vietcong
 are attempting to collect 10-15 percent of
 what the peasants had raised during the
 past decade, when they lived in peace,  The
 peasants are said to be discontented about
 that.  In isolated cases, peasants have burned
 their own crops rather than pay Vietcong
 taxes.
 In the fifties, President Ngo Dinh Diem
 attempted to correct the injustices In the
 countryside.  But his effectiveness was lim-
 ited.              A U.S. Government bulletin published
 in January this year explained:
 "Under the ordinances approved in 1956, a
 program was being carried out to regularize
 tenancy agreements through written con-
 tracts.  The contracts established minimum
 and maximum rents of 15 and 25 percent, re-
 spectively, chargeable by the landlord against
 the tenant's main crop.  While a start has
 been made in land reform, real progress has
 been negligible and a review of the entire
 program needs to be undertaken."

 OUR GIRL IN VIET-CONCLUSI014:  THE
 GRAM THE REDS CAN'T FIGHT
 (By Beverly Deepe)
 June
 PRO-
 SAIGON.-This Is the story of the three little
 pigs of Vietnam.
 It  is  one of the  most  visibly  effective
 American-sponsored programs in rural Viet-
 nam against which the Communist Vietcong
 guerrillas have many arguments but no real
 answer.
 In early 1962, American provincial repre-
 sentatives of the Agency for International
 Development (AID) began distributing im-
 proved white pigs from the Mekong Delta
 throughout the entire countryside.
 The program called for a package deal in
 which eight bags of cement would be given
 to build a combination pig sty-compost pit,
 while three improved pigs and American sur-
 plus corn would be lent to the farmer.
 One of the pigs would later be marketed,
 which would repay the entire $50 cost of the
 venture; the others would be kept for breed-
 ing.
 "The pigs had a fantastic impact," one
 American agricultural technican explained.
 "The farmers followed the old Chinese cus-
 tom and washed their pigs daily.  Some of
 them put red ribbons around the ears of
 the pigs.  Almost all the pigs became pets
 for the children."
 BUT WHY CEMENT?
 "Of course, we had a few problems. .Some
 of the Vietnamese farmers had never even
 seen cement before and they didn't under-
 stand why they should have a cement-floored
 pig sty and compost pit when for centuries
 they had moved the pig waste out on the
 ground.
 "Some of the farmers moved their cots into
 the compost pit.  Some of them put the pigs
 in their houses and moved their families
 into the pig sty.   After all, it was better
 than their dirt-floored houses.
 "Some of the farmers put tiled roofs on
 the pig  sty  with  curlicues like ancient
 Chinese  temples.   They  became  the  new
 status symbols in the villages.   We never
 could understand why they made them so
 elaborate.
 them only when they need the money. They
 use the piggy as a living bank."
 He explained that at first the richer village
 families got the pigs, or the friends of the
 local  Vietnamese  Government agricultural
 technicians.  Now-3 years and 40,000 pigs
 later-"the pigs have seeped into all levels
 of the villages," he said.
 "The neighbors buy little -pigs from the
 first family to have them. In one northern
 city, 2 years ago you wouldn't see one im-
 proved pig a day come through the slaughter-
 house.   Now  about                                                                                one-third  of  a  day's
 production is the improved breed."
 REPAYMENTS
 He explained that the Vietcong political
 cadre attempted to sabotage the program by
 telling the farmers that it was a "giveaway
 program" rather than a loan, so that the
 farmers would not make repayment to the
 Government.  So far, the rate of repayment
 has been low, but in most cases the  18-
 month deadline for repayment has not been
 reached.
 "The pig program doesn't make the farmer
 pro-Government or pro-Vietcong," the tech-
 nician explained.  "But it does expose him
 to the Government cadre, to the Government
 administration   and   to   an   American
 veterinarian.  Maybe this is the first time in
 the farmer's life that the Government has
 done something to help him.  So gradually,
 it creates a better feeling for the Govern-
 ment.
 "The Vietcong do not steal the pigs, and
 we have lost very few of our pig hamlets to
 the Vietcong."
 In addition to the pig program, Vietnamese
 agricultural technicians, assisted by Ameri-
 cans, have also started programs to improve
 ducks, chickens, and cattle and to promote
 a wider distribution of water buffaloes, which
 are used to pull the farmers' plows.
 Other technicians have established experi-
 mental  stations  for  improving  rice  seed
 (which some Vietnamese prefer to eat rather
 than use for seeding).
 Recently, Vietnamese agricultural agents
 conducted 3-day courses on improved farm-
 ing techniquesfor farmers during the slack
 season. Twenty piasters (30 cents) was given
 the farmers for lunches "and that really had
 an impact," one American agricultural expert
 explained.  "It. was part of our pacification
 program.    But the Vietcong even welcomed
 the  agents into their areas to help their
 farmers."
 FERTILIZER ON CREDIT
 In another instance, Vietnamese Govern-
 ment                                                                                                   administrators  have implemented  a
 credit-loan system whereby farmers can buy
 fertilizer before the rice planting and repay
 the loan after harvest.                   Production has more
 than doubled in some areas.  In other areas
 small irrigation pumps have been bought on
 loan, making possible two or three crops of
 rice a year instead of only one.
 The Vietcong retort that the fertilizer will
 destroy the soil; that in the first year of
 using fertilizer, production will increase but
 in future years it will drop; that the govern-
 ment will double the prices when it comes
 to paying the loan, or that the government
 will make the farmers dependent on the
 fertilizer year after year and then skyrocket
 the prices.
 "The poor Vietnamese farmer, who has a
 lot of  superstition  and  no knowledge  of
 chemicals, is in  the dark," an    American
 technician said. "The Vietcong play on the
 farmer's past lack of faith in the govern-
 ment."
 American-supported rural economic aid is
 scattered in the secure "oil spots" in each
 of Vietnam's 45 provinces, which at times
 undercuts the impact that it has had nation-
 wide.
 "Then, of course, the most profitable time           The  Communist-initiated  war  has pro-
 to sell the pig is when he's about 1 year                                  duced an economic deterioratioh and social
 old," he continued.  "But the Vietnamese                 upheaval in the countryside. Young farmers
 let the pigs get fatter and fatter and sell              are drafted Instead of planting rice.  Large
 tracts of land are abandoned because of Viet-
 cong pressure, and other large tracts, now
 uncultivated, could be developed into ex-
 cellent farming land.
 Despite this, the standard of living has
 improved  during  the  last  10 years.  Ten
 years ago, a bicycle was a status symbol; now
 motor scooters, bicycles, and buses are reg-
 ularly seen in the countryside.
 The nationwide statistics on education are
 also impressive.  In 1955, 329,000 pupils at-
 tended elementary public schools.  In 1964,
 the number had increased to 1.5 million.
 In 1964 alone, 900 new rural schools were
 built and 1,000 elementary education teach-
 ers were  trained.  A total  of 4,000  rural
 schools was built in the decade.
 In 1955, there were 2,900 university stu-
 dents in Vietnam.     By 1964, the number had
 increased to 20,000, with a new university
 established in the northern provinces. More
 than 2,500 Vietnamese students and techni-
 cians have been sent to America through
 AID programs for advanced degrees.
 However, the population growth is 2.8 per-
 cent yearly.
 In the rural health field, Vietnamese vil-
 lagers often find it difficult to understand
 what  has been prevented-such as cholera
 epidemics or malaria.   During the  last 6
 years, however,  the  American-backed  $12
 million malaria-eradication program, part of
 a worldwide effort, has dropped known ma-
 laria cases from 7.22 percent to less than i
 percent.
 SPRAYING OF HOMES
 More  than  1  million  Vietnamese  farm
 homes are being sprayed twice a year. More
 than 8 million persons have been directly
 affected  by  the spraying.  The Vietcong
 propagandists told the villagers the spray
 would cause their thatched roofs to crumble
 or would kill their cats and chickens.
 "The Vietcong say the farmers don't have
 enough cats to eat all the rats," one Ameri-
 can medical expert explained, "and the rats
 eat  rice.  They use  this  argument  when
 there's a poor crop of rice and a good crop
 of  rats-and  it's  very  effective  with the
 peasants."
 The malaria rate has dropped to the ex-
 tent that medical experts simply keep tab?
 on it by collecting blood samples.
 "The Vietcong spread the word that the
 Americans were collecting Vietnamese blood
 to give to the wounded Americans," the medi-
 cal expert continued.  "This even happened,
 on the outskirts of Saigon.  One American
 educational lecturer started to-give a lecture
 on the taking of these blood samples for
 malaria control; suddenly all the mamas and.
 little kids started throwing rocks at him.
 "The police had to escort him out--all be-
 cause of that outlandish Vietcong propa..
 ganda.  But Vietnamese people don't like to
 give blood; they are superstitious about that
 and it's very strange to them."
 More than 8,000 rural health workers are
 currently operating in the Vietnamese coun--
 tryside.                                                                                                                                        Nine gleaming white surgical suites,

 THE ESCALATING WAR
 (By Richard Starnes)
 The American people are not alone in their
 blissful ignorance of the coming demands for
 men to feed the insatiable jungle war in
 Vietnam.                                A completely reliable source who
 was present at a White House briefing tells
 me this:
 "I saw V.S. Senators blanch when Robert
 McNamara told them that they had to pre-
 pare to see 300,000 American men sent to
 Vietnam.

 "I never thought I would dive to see such
 a thing in the United States, but McNamara
 told the'briefing quite cheerfully that things
 were looking up in Vietnam because we were
 now killing four times as many men as we
 were losing "
 The briefing, which was one of dozens that
 the White House has conducted in an effort
 to sell its, 4 Vietnam policy, concluded with
 talks by Secretary of State Dean Rusk and
 "Sig Daddy" himself.
 "Rusk had nothing new to say, but he kept
 saying it at such great length that finally
 the President, who was sitting in the front
 row, started looking ostentatiously at his
 watch," my informant reports.  "But Rusk
 missed the cue, until at last the President
 just got up and nudged Rusk away from the
 lectern."
 What the Senators heard then is a thing
 that has caused something very near to
 cloakroom   consternation.  Mr.   Johnson
 sailed into a defense of his escalation of the
 war in Vietnam, and bluntly told his audi-
 ence that they had authorized it and, by im-
 plication, must share the responsibility for
 it.
 The 'President said he was frequently asked
 what his policy in Vietnam was.  Then, with
 the sublety of a sledgehammer, he told the
 Senators that the Congress had laid down
 the policy in a resolution passed last August
 7 by a vote of 504 to 2.  And, said the Presi-
 dent, he was doing his best to carry out that
 resolution.
 The source of this account, who knows the
 Senate intimately, reported that, in spite of
 the near unanimity of congressional support
 for administration Vietnam policy, Senators
 are still "rankled" over Mr. Johnson's bland
 assumption that the August 7 resolution au-
 thorized escalation of the war in southeast
 Asia.
 The resolution, passed in the fever of in-
 dignation that followed reported attacks by
 North Vietnamese torpedo boats against U.S.
 Fleet units in Tonkin Gulf, comes very close
 to saying what President Johnson says it
 Says-whether the Senators who voted for it
 like to admit it or not.
 The resolution authorized the President
 "as Commander in Chief, to take all neces-
 sary measures to repel any armed attack
 against the forces of the United States and
 to prevent further aggression."
 Note well that the resolution was not lim-
 ited to Vietnam but specifically asserted
 that the U.S. goal was "assisting the people
 of southeast Asia" to fight off alleged ag-
 gression.                That means just what it says-
 Congress "approves and supports" anything
 Mr. Johnson deems necessary "to prevent
 further aggression" in the area, and it is now
 somewhat late for whatever second thoughts
 are occurring in Capitol cloakrooms.
 Whatever doubt may have existed as to the
 intent of the August 7 resolution was dis-
 pelled last month, however, when Congress
 dutifully voted a blank check $700 million
 appropriation to finance the expanding war.
 This time the division was 596 to 10, still a
 sufficiently lopsided vote to assure history
 that the 89th Congress had supported escala-
 tion in the Pacific whether it knew what it
 was doing or not.

 VIETNAM WAR ALTERS CHARACTER
 (By Malcolm W. Browne)..
 SAIGON, VIETNAM, June 4.-The war in Viet-
 nam has been transformed into an enormous
 ..Meat grinder, in which both sides are now
 making an all-out drive to bleed each other
 to death.
 It is a meat grinder in which America for
 the first. time has an active part-on both
 the giving and, receiving end.
 U.S. officials predict that American casualty
 tolls will increase from now on as American
 Marine Corps and Army paratrooper units
 move deeper into the battle.
 U.S. air strikes on North and South Viet-
 nam have increased in recent months to the
 point that they are now round-the-clock
 operations.
 In the north, strikes have been limited to
 miiltary instalaltions, roads, and waterways
 well south of Hanoi.  There seems no imme-
 diate prospect of bombing North Vietnam's
 cities or civilian industries.
 But in the south, huge sectors of the nation
 have been declared "free bombing zones," in
 which anything that moves is a legitimate
 target.  Tens of thousands of tons of bombs,
 rockets, napalm, and cannon fire are poured
 into these vast areas each week.  If only by
 the laws of chance, bloodshed is believed to
 be heavy in these raids.
 In exchange, the Vietcong is exacting its
 pound of flesh.
 In the past week, big Vietcong units prowl-
 ing through the jungle-covered mountains of
 central Vietnam have chewed up three Gov-
 ernment battalions so badly that these units
 will not be able to fight again for along time.
 Government casualties in these ambushes
 probably have exceeded 1,000 men.
 The Vietcong have clearly shifted gears
 from what they call guerrilla warfare to
 mobile warfare.
 The Communist concept of mobile warfare
 is essentially guerrilla operation on a vastly
 expanded scale, in which whole battalions
 and regiments are used in mounting am-
 bushes.  Ambushes remain the key feature
 of the war.
 The Saigon Government and its American
 ally control the air above South Vietnam and
 some of its roads and waterways.  The Viet-
 cong controls much of the rest of the nation.
 Government units move mostly by truck,
 plane, and helicopter.  Vietcong units move
 on foot through the trackless jungle.  This
 means the Communists generally have the
 advantage in setting up their ambushes.
 Roads,  particularly  those' that      wind
 through. the mountain passes of central Viet-
 nam, are ideal places for ambushes..                                                                       Even
 helicopters must land in clearings, wich in
 the jungle are often only tiny patches of
 ground.
 The Vietcong can and often does set up
 traps around these clearings, with 50-caliber
 machineguns trained on the places helicop-
 ters will be forced to land.
 As the fighting grows hotter it becomes
 more brutal.  Neither side' is taking many
 prisoners any more.  Soldiers caught off side
 now are generally shot on the spot or tor-
 tured to death.
 CHILEAN DEMOCRACY
 WORKING WELL
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, in
 the news-in newspapers, on television,
 and radio-we hear agreat deal . more
 about Vietnam and-the Dominican Re-
 public, about coups and revolutions, and
 about the setbacks in the world.  Un-
 fortunately, the quiet progress that is
 being made in many countries has been
 neglected because it does not make news.
 For example, the, current Atlantic
 Monthly carries an excellent, concise re-
 port on the impressively favorable de-
 velopments in Chile under the leadership
 of Eduardo Frei.  The excellent article
 points out that under Mr. Frei there has
 been great improvement in education. I
 read briefly from the 'article :
 It is a shocking fact that in this country
 of 8.5 million people of largely European ex-
 traction there were approximately 200,000
 children with no school to go to. in a crash
 program initiated immediately on taking
 office in November, at the beginning of the
 Chilean summer, Frei organized an intensive
 course to train new teachers, asked existing
 ones voluntarily to accept longer hours, and
 undertook the construction of. thousands of
 schoolrooms, as well as lodgings for teachers
 in remote areas.
 President Frei has also been busily en-
 gaged in an excellent land reform pro-
 gram which in the next few years will
 provide for an additional 100,000 inde-
 pendent farmers in Chile.
 Everyone who has studied the Com-
 munist movement knows that the great-
 est bulwark against communism is the
 individual farmer who has his own plot
 of ground and his own farm to defend.
 In addition, under Mr. Frei tax re-
 forms in Chile have made progress.
 There have been jail sentences for tax
 evaders and that is almost unheard of
 in South America.  Most significant of
 all is the excellent cooperation between
 the Chilean Government and American
 corporations-Anaconda   Copper   and
 Kennecott Copper-both of which have
 huge  holdings  in Chile. Chile  has
 worked out a system of ownership and
 participation in the profits of those cor-
 porations that have been agreed to by the
 corporations. Chile has avoided the ex-
 propriation which the Marxists have
 called for.  Confiscatory taxes have been
 avoided.  Both Anaconda and Kennecott
 are proceeding profitably fram their
 standpoint, and also sharing their gains
 with the Chileans and with the Chilean
 Government.
 There is a very serious problem, as
 there is in most of those countries, with
 inflation.  But even in that field Mr.
 Frei is making progress.
 The   PRESIDING OFFICER.  The
 time of the Senator has expired.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.   Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that I may pro-
 ceed for 3 additional minutes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.. With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr.  PROXMIRE.  The  remarkable
 thing to me is that Mr. Frei has been
 able to put into effect a system of slow-
 ing down inflation which has at the same
 time permitted wage earners to earn
 significantly more money. It has per-
 mitted farmers to obtain better prices
 for their crops, while simultaneously
 keeping inflation from preventing the
 kind of firm and solid economic progress
 which is most essential.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that this fine, short article on Chile,
 published in the Atlantic Monthly, be
 printed at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 THE ATLANTIC REPORT-CHILE
 Chileans are accustomed to earthquakes,
 but the recent upheaval in their politics is so
 unusual that historians peer back to 1841 to
 find a parallel.  Christian Democrat Eduardo
 Frei is the first President since then, under
 Chile's multiparty system, to be elected by an
 absplttte ;majority and to have a congress to
 do his bidding.
 His victory by 56 percent in the presidential
 elections of September  1964 was startling
 enough, but it might have been considered

 the wages of fear: the Marxist left was run-
 ning so strong-and did, indeed, chalk up a
 hefty 39 percent-that the right and center
 voted for him as a lesser evil, in spite of his
 revolutionary program.  In the congressional
 elections 6 months later, however, the old
 alinements were back in force; the right and
 center, Chile's traditional governing parties,
 fully expected to return a congress able to
 block untoward presidential initiative.  In-
 stead, Frei's party all but swept them away,
 while the far left slightly improved its posi-
 tion.
 The result is not only a green light for
 Frei's Revolution With Liberty, which aims at
 transforming Chile's social structure, but also
 an unexpected revolution in its politics.  The
 era of compromise, mutual back scratching-
 or sheer deadlock-is over, at least for the
 time being.  Indeed, it is likely that disgust
 with political infighting played its part, as it
 does in Gaullist France, in this sudden emer-
 gence of a majority party.  Like De Gaulle,
 Frei, before the landslide, had asked for a
 constitutional amendment permitting him to
 go to the people should congress become too
 obstructionist.
 PEACEFUL REVOLUTION
 The program which is now the approved
 blueprint for Chile's future follows closely
 the outlines for peaceful revolution drawn up
 at the Punta del Este conference as the basis
 for the Alliance for Progress.  Emphasis is
 placed on achieving a social impact where it
 will be most immediately and dramatically
 evident in Chile: among the landless farm
 laborers and among the unorganized prole-
 tariat that swarms in city slums.
 Chilean  agriculture  has  been  for  some
 years a major reason for the imbalance of the
 economy. Once a net exporter of agricultural
 products, Chile now imports more than $140
 million worth, two-thirds of which could be
 produced locally.  In Chile's inflationary rat
 race, agricultural prices have lagged behind
 industrial ones because of Government at-
 tempts to control the cost of the urban "mar-
 ket basket"; worse still, these controls have
 been erratic, thus discouraging rational de-
 velopment.
 While these economic considerations are
 important, it Is the social aspects which most
 concern the Christian Democrats. They point
 out that one-third of the population lives on
 the land, 60 percent is illiterate, and the
 death rate of infants in rural areas is 129 per
 thousand, shocking figures for one of the
 most advanced countries in Latin America.
 The ,Government goal is not, thus, just an
 increase in production-which they will en-
 courage by allowing food prices to rise faster
 this year than those of industry-but a pro-
 found agrarian reform.
 Frei has promised to distribute land to
 100,000 new farmers (luring his 6-year term,
 and to provide, through  cooperatives, the
 necessary technical and financial assistance
 to make the venture efficient.  In this respect,
 his government has a valuable heritage from
 his predecessor, conservative president Jorge
 Alessandri,  who  got  a  well-articulated  if
 somewhat mild agrarian reform law through
 congress in 1962. Under this law 6,000 plots
 have already been distributed.  The present
 government plans to amend the law, to speed
 up the process of expropriation, and to allow
 for deferred payment of indemnities instead
 of cash on the line.
 THE  URBAN SLUMS
 The program for the urban slums, which
 have been rebaptized "marginal neighbor-
 hoods," goes under the name Popular Pro-
 motion, a hodgepodge package  aimed  at
 bringing them Into the mainstream of na-
 tional life:  Here, too, the Alessandri heritage
 gives Frei a headstart, since Alessandri built
 more low-cost housing than any previous
 President. Frei hopes to 'build still more,
 and in the existing slums to install Water
 systems. pave the streets, put in electricity,
 with  19)bor  furnished  largely  by  the  in-
 habitants themselves.
 He is moat enthusiastic about the creation
 of neighborhood organizations: sewing cir-
 cles, teams for various sports, parent-teacher
 associations,   and   local   self-government
 councils, which are to have the right to fed-
 erate with similar councils throughout the
 country in order to form effective pressure
 groups.  Frei promises that none of these
 activities will be linked with politics, but
 some of his critics wonder how it is humanly
 possible to keep them separate.
 In neighboring Peru, President Belailnde's
 similar and successful Popular Cooperation
 has been accused of being primarily a de-
 vice for building grassroots support for his
 party.  In any case, only  10 percent of
 Chile's working class is organized, in unions
 largely Communist-controlled, at least at the
 top.    Organizing people "where they live as
 well as where they work" is thus an interest-
 ing new approach to the problem of giving
 civic representation to the submerged pro-
 letariat-
 A                                                                             third  area  where  Frei  has  already
 achieved dramatic social impact is education.
 It is a shocking fact that in this country of
 81/2 million people of largely European ex-
 traction there were approximately 200,000
 children with no school to go to.  In a crash
 program initiated immediately on taking of-
 fice in November, at the beginning of the
 Chilean summer, Frei organized an intensive
 course to train new teachers, asked existing
 ones voluntarily to accept longer hours, and
 undertook the construction of thousands of
 schoolrooms, as well as lodgings for teachers
 in remote areas.
 He mobilized the good will and enthusiasm
 of various groups:  villagers gave land and
 their labor and sometimes local materials;
 the  armed  forces  sent  their  troops  and
 equipment; 1,500 university students spent
 their  holidays  mixing  mortar  and  laying
 bricks.   This  year, for the  first time, no
 Chilean'child will be denied the pleasures of
 the three R's.
 Agrarian reform, public dousing, and edu-
 cation                                                                            cost     money,  and Chile is already
 overextended in the matter of foreign credit;
 it has received more dollars per capita in
 Alliance  for Progress  aid than any   other
 Latin-American country. However, Frei also
 inherited from Alessandri an economy which,
 while certainly not brilliant, is still in rela-
 tively good shape.  The balance of payments
 in  1984  showed a      slight  credit, thanks
 largely to the high price of copper and re-
 stricted imports.     The growth rate was 4
 percent, not too far below the Alliance goal
 o1' 5 percent.
 The budget is approximately in balance,
 owing to a tax reform that is just beginning
 to show its benefits-among which Chileans
 count not only increased collections but a
 jail  sentence  actually enforced  for  a  tax
 evader, an unheard-of phenomenon in Latin
 America.
 THE  COST  OF  LIVING
 However,                   on Chile's main problem, en-
 demic inflation, the Alessandri government,
 after an encouraging start, made no head-
 way.  The cost of living rose 38 percent in
 1964; since 1960 it has nearly tripled. Previ-
 ous attempts to stop the runaway in its
 tracks having failed, Frei is proposing to
 apply the brakes slowly.  He aims for a rise
 of only 25 percent in 1965, with lesser rises
 in succeeding years until stability is reached,
 hopefully by 1968. However, this year he is
 proposing that the rise be fully compensated
 by wage increases, with agricultural prices
 and wages to be overcompensated to redress
 previous injustices.
 In order to maintain the overall increase
 within the 25-percent limit, he is, therefore,
 insisting that industrial'prices rise no more
 than 19 percent.  In this framework, only a
 sharp rise in production can maintain previ-
 ous profit levels.  Stringent controls, more
 effective than any yet devised, will be neces-
 sary to hold the line.
 Financing social programs in so tight an
 economy thus requires some maneuvering
 and a high level of competence, but Frei has
 attracted a team of young economists from
 the  various  universities-particularly the
 Institute of  Economics,  organized  some
 years ago by Prof. Joseph Grunwald, of Co-
 lumbia-and from the United Nations Eco-
 nomic   Commission   for                                                                                                                                    Latin   America
 (ECLA), whose headquarters are in Santiago.
 Chileans like to call them the Brain Trust.
 Service on the foreign debt, which would
 have absorbed more than half the export re-
 turns of the next few years, has been suc-
 cessfully renegotiated to provide a breathing
 spell.  The United States has extended loans
 of  various  types  for  $120  million.   And
 Chileans themselves have been asked to make
 a sacrifice: a capital levy on personal prop-
 erty of 1.5 to 3 percent annually for a period
 of 5 years.
 This proposal has naturally aroused the
 ire of the propertied classes-and not only
 because of the money involved.  Frei was
 careful to cite such precedents as France's
 similar levy just after the war and to point
 to its present glowing prosperity as the result.
 What really upsets many Chileans is the
 declaration of their possessions which is im-
 plied in the levy.  Income tax evasion would.
 thereby become much more difficult.   (At
 present, in spite of tax reform, the salaried
 class bears most of the burden; only 11,000
 people have declared a taxable income of over
 $5,000 a year.)
 NEW DEAL IN COPPER
 Redressing social injustice, however  ad-
 mirable,  is                                                                                                                                                                                  nevertheless no sure cure for
 inflation and economic stagnation.  To get;
 the country moving, Frei has tackled the
 problem at its very center-copper.   This
 metal dominates the Chilean economy;   it
 provides more than 50 percent of foreign
 exchange and $85 million annually in taxes.
 But five-sixths of the copper is extracted by
 two American  companies,  Anaconda    and
 Kennecott.  Although these companies pay
 the highest wages in the country, and the
 highest mining taxes in the world, the pres-
 ence of two foreign colossi at the heart of the
 economy is a constant irritant to national
 pride, particularly since a good deal of the
 copy er is refined abroad and its marketing
 is beyond the control of Chile.
 The Marxist left, has been campaigning for
 some time in favor of outright expropria-
 tion.  The American companies have hesi-
 tated to invest in the face of this threat and
 the concomitant one of confiscatory taxes.
 Kennecott even announced a few years ago
 that it was not planning any further expan-
 sion in Chile and would spend its money in
 developing its American properties.
 Frei, for his part,  proposed  an  inter-
 mediary solution which he called the Chile--
 anization of copper.  Immediately after the
 election, he sent a commission to the United
 States to see how the new word could be
 defined.
 The definition has turned out to be not
 only dramatic but eminently satisfactory t:>
 everyone   concerned---except,   of   (ours:;
 Chile's diehard Marxists.  What it amounts
 to  is  a  business association  between  the
 Chilean Government and the mining compa-
 nies, a new departure, on a scale like thi..
 in the whole concept of "how to do busine-
 abroad."
 In two cases, that of Anaconda and thss
 Cerro Corp.-new to Chile but already op-
 erating in Peru-Chile has acquired a 25-
 percent equity in new companies formed to
 exploit new ore beds.  In the most startli-ig
 agreement, that with Kennecott, Chile has
 bought outright 51 percent of a new conl-
 pany to exploit the rich El Teniente mine.
 whose production, with the aid of Kennecott?
 w;?l be vastly expanded.  The companies will

 announced that he was ordering with-
 drawal of the remainder of our marines
 from the Dominican Republic.  This
 Nation and the world owe an everlasting
 debt of gratitude to those courageous men
 of the U.S. Marines who moved to evacu-
 ate innocent foreign nationals, including
 citizens of the United States, from the
 civil warfare that raged in Santo Do-
 mingo at the time of President Johnson's
 decision to send in the marines.
 The.marines protected many persons
 who were not citizens of the Dominican
 Republic, . and fears that the United
 States was aiming a long-range occupa-
 tion of the island were wholly uiustified.
 In no way do I mean to diminish the
 fine work done by the 82d Airborne Di-
 vision. These courageous soldiers still are
 on duty to prevent unnecessary blood-
 shed and, to assure the people of the
 Dominican Republic that the revolt does
 not result in another Communist regime
 like that in Cuba. We are merely there
 to see that the people of the Dominican
 Republic are guaranteed free elections
 and other democratic processes.
 Mr. President, at that time there was
 a great hue and cry from some sources
 about a return to the earlier days when
 the United States did, upon some occa-
 sions, use the Marines for long-term oc-
 cupation of certain places in Latin
 America. It is understandable that the
 peoples of Latin America might fear such
 a thing.  They were, of course, encour-
 aged in that fear by the Communist
 propagandists-as they are always en-
 couraged to criticize and malign the
 United States.
 In our own country, however, there
 was no such excuse, and yet we heard
 then, and we hear now, voices within
 our own councils which say much the
 same thing. I hope that President John-
 son's action in withdrawing the marines
 at the earliest possible moment will tend
 to still these voices, which are essentially
 the voices of dissension and division, at
 a time when the President is facing so
 many critical and delicate situations
 throughout the world.
 President Johnson is a man of reason
 and restraint, dealing one after the other

 citizens of this country, and citizens of
 other countries-who were caught in
 this sudden and brutal outburst of vio-
 lence, which was growing rapidly more
 savage and uncontrolled.
 Armed gangs were running through
 public rooms and corridors of the prin-
 cipal hotel which housed our representa-
 tives and those of other countries, firing
 rifles and submachineguns through the
 walls and windows.  Our Ambassador,
 and_I think he showed great good sense
 in his action under the circumstances,
 took the telephone and went under-
 ground. He got down under the desk in
 order to continue reporting to the Presi-
 dent and the Secretary of State.
 It is indeed surprising that, despite all
 that was going on then, and all that
 has gone on since, not one national of
 another country lost his life.  The ma-
 rines went ashore instantly, established
 the . necessary  sanctuaries,   protected
 them, and arranged for the orderly evac-
 uation of those who wished to leave.
 There was not a single life of a foreign
 national or visitor lost.
 One of those who criticized our actions
 in sending in the marines was President
 de Gaulle of France. It Is worth noting,
 however, that this did not prevent the
 French Ambassador to the Dominican
 Republic from taking advantage of our
 protection for French citizens, .and, in
 fact, the protection zone was enlarged to
 include the French Embassy after the
 marines had already taken up their
 positions.
 I wish it were possible to say that there
 were no lives lost, and no injured and
 wounded, as a result of this necessary
 action, Mr. President, but unhappily this
 cannot be said.  Eight fine marines have
 died and 29 have paid in lesser measure
 for the success of this operation.  We
 should all pay our homage today to these
 young men, and express our sympathies
 with their families and friends who now
 will miss them in the intimate ways that
 always accompanyy such tragedies.
 While our purpose in entering Santo
 Domingo was to protect our own citizens.
 and the citizens of other countries, we
 were certainly very much concerned
 about the circumstances and conditions
 prevailing for the people of this island.
 At the time the marines landed, the
 people of the island were caught between
 the two forces.  They were bombed and
 strafed in the streets of Santo Domingo;
 they were starving.  Many of them were
 being put up. against the wall and shot.
 fully in the efforts to reach some po-
 litical solution of the difficult problems
 which still exist.  Our objective will con-
 tinue to be to find this solution, and to
 withdraw the ' remainder of our forces
 from the island.
 President Johnson has given concrete
 evidence of the peaceful course he will
 pursue    by  withdrawing  the  marines.
 There is no doubt whatsoever that Presi-
 dent Johnson's future actions will be fully
 in keeping with his order of last Thurs-
 day.
 Mr. GRUENING.      Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  I yield.
 Mr. GRUENING.  I am happy to say
 that I heartily approve of the Presi-
 dent's policy in the Dominican Republic
 to date.  I feel he had to act as he did.
 He said so from the very start.  He
 moved first to save American lives and,
 second, to prevent what he feared might
 be a Communist takeover-both wholly
 worthy and commendable objectives.
 Third, he moved as rapidly as possible
 to make the problem a multilateral af-
 fair, with the assistance and cooperation
 of our sister American Republics, by call-
 ing on the Organization of American
 States to come in and help work out
 the Dominican problem.
 If out of this tragic situation in the
 Dominican Republic we can get a per-
 manent peacekeeping force in the Amer-
 icas, in which the United States will be
 merely one of a number of nations coop-
 erating, I feel definitely that we shall
 have brought about an event of lasting
 significance and a great turning point in
 the history of the Americas.
 For that reason I believe the Presi-
 dent's policy, both on the immediate
 range and on the long range, are highly
 commendable.  He deserves unqualified
 praise.  I am happy to say this because
 of the fact that I do not agree with our
 policy in southeast Asia.
 I thank the Senator for yielding to me.
 Mr. President, I now should like to
 speak on my own time for a little more
 than 3 minutes.
 The  PR-SIDING   OFFICER   (Mr.
 CoopEa in the chair).  How much time
 does the Senator desire?
 Mr. GRUENING.     About 10 minutes.

 noupcement that a decision has been made
 to commit American ground forces to open
 combat in South Vietnam: The Nation is in-
 formed about it not by the President, not by
 a Cabinet member, not even by a sub-Cabinet
 official, but by a public relations officer.
 There is still no explanation offered for
 a move that fundamentally alters the char-
 acter of the American involvement in Viet-
 nam.  A program of weapons supply, train-
 ing and combat advice to South Vietnamese,
 initiated by Presidents Eisenhower and Ken-
 nedy, has now been transformed by President
 Johnson  into  an  American  war  against
 Asians.

 question :
 Is it not more likely  that political ir-

 than decline, as the main military responsi-
 bility for defending South Vietnam is trans-
 ferred increasingly to American hands?
 And concludes:
 The country deserves answers to this and
 many other questions.  It has been taken
 into a ground war by Presidential decision,
 when there is no emergency that would seem
 to rule out congressional debate.  The duty

 that the Nation will be informed on where

 calation in the Pacific whether it knew what
 This same growing unrest in the Con-
 gress and its questioning of the wisdom
 of its abdication of a voice in the conduct
 of our foreign policy is noted by the New
 York Times in its leading editorial on
 June 7, 1965, .entitled "Congress and
 Vietnam" which begins:
 Signs are growing of congressional interest
 in ending the leave-it-to-Lyndon era in
 American foreign policy.
 The Founding Fathers intended the
 framing of our foreign policy to be a
 partnership between the executive and
 the legislative branches of the Federal
 Government with each acting, as co-
 equals.
 We are now seeing the harmful effects
 of treating the formulation of foreign
 policy as the exclusive prerogative of the
 executive branch of the Government.
 The editorial in the New York Times
 contains the following observations:
 Factors that go beyond the President's
 limited experience in foreign affairs and the
 -extraordinary vacillations in Dominican pol-
 icy, have set off the present questioning at
 home and abroad.  The reluctance of Secre-
 tary of State Rusk to employ the full re-
 sources of his Department and give inde-
 pendent advice, the meager use made by the
 President of nonofficial task forces in the
 foreign policy field, the overdependence on
 military and intelligence agencies and the
 divorce between the administration and the
 Nation's intellectuals-all point to a need
 for more vigorous congressional "interest.
 Nowhere is this more vital than on Viet-
 nam, where grave constitutional questions
 are raised by the official acknowledgment of
 an increasing combat role  for American
 troops.  During the 18 months of the John-
 son administration, the number of American
 troops, in Vietnam has been tripled to about
 46,500;  a further buildup to more than
 60,000 appears imminent.. American planes
 have entered Into combat both in South and
 North Vietnam-in the latter case openly
 attacking a foreign country with no declara-
 tion of war.  American warships have bom-
 barded the North Vietnamese coast.  And
 there are indications that American ground
 troops-first employed as advisers in South
 Vietnam, then deployed to defend American
 installations and now directly engaged in
 patrolling action-will soon take on a full
 combat role as a tactical reserve aiding South
 Vietnamese units in trouble.
 Yet at no point has there been significant

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE              June 9f 1965
 Since November 1963, the country has been
 in a state of political crisis.  Sources in
 Saigon now argue that it would be a mistake
 to rebuild  a  counterideology-even if it
 could be done.  They say instead that the
 Saigon government must reform itself and
 " but-revolutionize the Communists-but do
 it 10 times better and 50 times faster than
 the Communists themselves."
 The dilemma of American policymakers Is
 the schizophrenic nature of the Vietnamese
 society itself.  The governing class is gener-
 ally urban-based, French-educated with an
 aristocratic position based on either family
 background, money or landownership.  This
 elite minority attempts to govern the masses
 although it knows little about them and is
 concerned less.
 After 10 years of administering the largest
 U.S.  medical  aid  program  in  the world,
 American officials here still have little in-
 fluence on Vietnamese medical affairs.                      One
 American-trained    Vietnamese   doctor' said
 that a medical degree from an American
 medical school still is not readily recognized
 in Vietnam, on the other hand, a "parachute
 degree"-a  degree   virtually  bought with
 money from a second-rate medical school in
 France-is easily acceptable by "the Mafia."
 The two best hospitals in  Saigon are
 French operated.  They are also the most
 expensive. There is no good American hos-
 pital in Saigon for the Vietnamese popula-
 tion                                 (although there are two American-
 operated hospitals In France).                    Requests by
 the               American-operated Seventh Day Ad-
 ventist Missionary Hospital to expand their
 30-bed clinic have repeatedly been refused.
 American officials in Saigon have not ef-
 fectively pressured the Saigon government
 to correct "this rot within," in the words of
 a  Vietnamese  anti-Communist.   Instead,
 they have superimposed upon the rot a spec-
 tacular medical program in the provinces.
 "The Americans think we should fight for
 democracy," one young Vietnamese intellec-
 tual explained.                   "But, in fact, the Vietcong
 fight because of the lack of democracy."
 But her most devastating article is
 entitled:  `.`Corruption--Hottest Saigon
 Issue" and shows how corruption on high
 in Saigon-winked at and ignored by
 U.S. officials-was and is one of the
 causes for effective support of the Gov-
 ernment  at  the  grassroots--support
 which is essential.
 The article states, in part:
 The hottest issue in Saigon is not bombing
 Hanoi, nor Vietcong. terrorism, nor possible
 negotiations for peace.  It is corruption.
 Vietnamese   sources-generals,   majors,
 captains, ex-ministers, economists-say that
 corruption has now reached scandalous, un-
 precedented proportions.
 Highly placed sources in Saigon-Ameri-
 can, Vietnamese, and Western-urged tighter
 controls on Vietnamese Government funds
 and on American aid and goods.
 The issue is considered a gift for the Viet-
 cong Communists, who promise the workers
 and peasants justice and equality.  It also
 has caused friction within the Vietnamese
 Government and armed forces.
 One high-ranking American official in the
 U.S. Agency for International Development
 (AID) reportedly estimated that 30 percent
 of American economic aid was unreceipted
 or unaccounted for last year. A low-echelon
 American provincial official says some of the
 45 Vietnamese provinces had not submitted
 vouchers for expenditures during the past 3
 years.
 The original purpose of American advisers
 was to train Vietnamese to use the equip-
 ment-"and to keep track of the equipment,
 which  sometimes  took  some  doing,"  one
 American captain who worked on the pro.
 gram for 2 years said.
 "We brought in air conditioners for hos-
 pitals-they ended up in the general's house.
 We brought In hospital refrigerators to store
 vaccines in.  The vaccines spoiled and the
 refrigerators wound  up  in  the  general's
 house."
 These are the comments and criticisms
 which the highly placed sources in Saigon
 made about the commercial import program
 and sales of farm surplus commodities.
 First, according to one Vietnamese eco-
 nomist and ex-minister, economic aid doesn't
 aim at an economic target, but Is only in
 support of a military machine.  About four-
 fifths of the U.S.-generated piastres In 1964
 were allocated to support the Vietnamese
 military budget.
 CONSPICUOUS WEALTH
 Second, the commercial import program
 has enriched and enlarged the upper middle
 class elements in Saigon and other cities, but
 it has also accentuated the extremes between
 the urban and rural classes. Often you bring
 in a whole lot of things for the richer mid-
 dle class with conspicuous consumption, and
 the Vietcong can play on this, saying it en-
 riches the middle class and bourgeois, one
 Western ambassador said.
 Third, the rural communities, especially
 earlier in the program, received a relatively
 small proportion of the commercial import
 aid.  Between 1955 and 1960, when the Viet-
 cong began organizing and recruiting in the
 countryside, only 4 percent of the direct and
 indirect American aid was funneled into the
 rural population, which is an estimated 85
 percent of the total population.
 Fourth, the commercial import program
 has not been geared to assist the building
 of industries which funnel Vietnamese agri-
 cultural products into the light industrial
 sector.  During the critical period of Viet-
 cong formation in the countryside, from 1955
 to 1960, American economic aid assisted in
 the  establishment  of  58  companies.   But
 about 70 percent of these depended on Im-
 ported raw materials:                                                                                even the papermills
 needed to import woodpulp.
 The Vietnamese officials have therefore de-
 vised an effective system of padding their
 vouchers and receipts.
 "Suppose a wooden bridge costs 1,600 pias-
 ters to build," an American district adviser
 complained,  "the contractor adds another
 200 plasters and the district chief adds an-
 other 200 piasters.  I can practically see the
 money flow Into their pockets, but they give
 me a receipt for 2,000 piasters.  What can I
 do to disprove them?"
 One Vietnamese province chief under the
 Ngo Dinh Diem regime admitted he ordered
 a few of his loyal troops to blow up his own
 bridge that was half constructed so that
 they could let another construction contract.
 Some  Vietnamese regional  and regular
 units are known to possess phantom troops-
 troops that never existed, or were killed or
 deserted but never reported as lost.  Their
 paychecks slip into the hands of privileged
 commanders.
 "What it boils down to Is whether to have
 a social revolution or not and clean up this
 government," a Vietnamese economists ex-
 plained.  If America is too scared to do it-
 the Communists will, and will win the people.
 The people want justice.  They don't care
 if they have a democracy or a dictatorship-
 if the government comes in with bullets or
 ballots. But they want justice-even if it
 is harsh. The Vietcong are harsh, but they
 are just.
 The basic conclusion arrived at in this
 excellent series is summed up at the be-
 ginning of the second article:
 U.S. policy in South Vietnam is frozen in
 a negative posture that concentrates on mil-
 itary victory while failing to produce the
 sort of dramatic political strategy that would
 make such victory possible.
 This, at least, is the opinion of highly
 placed sources in Saigon who have watched
 the American involvement here grow stead-
 ily for more than a decade.
 In their view, the U.S. attitude is essen-
 tially  anti-Communist  rather  than  pro-
 something.   The      overwhelming impression
 is that the American policymakers are at-
 tempting to stem the tide of Communist
 aggression or to teach Hanoi a lesson. But
 this implies a political status quo in a coun-
 try that is changing in its post-colonial de-
 velopment,  and  is,  indeed,  fighting   for
 change.
 "Nothing negative has ever prevailed over
 something positive," the Western military
 expert commented. One of the most fre-
 quently asked questions by Vietnamese cap-
 tains and majors on the battlefront is "What
 are we fighting for?" as they look at the
 political turmoil in their rear area at Saigon.
 I  ask  unanimous consent that the
 article by Mr. Richard Starnes and Mal-
 colm W. Browne be printed at the con-
 clusion of my remarks.

 EXHIBIT 1
 [From the New York Times, June 9, 19651
 GROUND WAR IN ASIA
 The American people were told by a minor
 State Department official yesterday that, in
 effect, they were in a land war on the con-
 tinent of Asia.  This is only one of the
 extraordinary aspects of the first formal an-
 nouncement that a decision has been made
 to commit American ground forces to open
 combat in South Vietnam.  The Nation is
 informed about it not by the President, not
 by a Cabinet member, not even by a sub-
 Cabinet official, but by a public relations
 officer.
 There is still no explanation offered for. a
 move that fundamentally alters the char-
 acter of the American Involvement in Viet-
 nam.                                                                                                                               A program of weapons supply, train-
 ing and combat advice to South Vietnamese,
 initiated by Presidents Eisenhower and Ken-
 nedy, has now been transformed by Presi-
 dent Johnson into an American war against
 Asians.
 It was the bombing of North Vietnam that
 led, in turn, to the use of American jet air-
 craft in South Vietnam and the emplace-
 ment of American marines and paratroops
 to  defend  American  airbases.  Now,  with
 American air support hampered by the mon-
 soon rains, American ground troops are to be
 made available as a tactical reserve to help
 South Vietnamese units in trouble.
 It can all be made to sound like a gradual
 and inevitable outgrowth  of  earlier com-
 mitments.  Yet the whole development has
 occurred in a 4-month span, just after an
 election in which the administration cam-
 paigned on the issue of its responsibility and
 restraint in foreign military involvements.
 Since March, American forces in Vietnam
 have been more than doubled to 52,000, as
 compared to 14,000 when President Johnson
 took office.`  Additional troops are moving in
 and a buildup to 70,000 is indicated.  There
 has been neither confirmation nor denial for
 reports  that a  force  exceeding  100,000 is
 planned, including three full Army and Ma-
 rine divisions.                                                                                                                             Nor is there any clarification
 on whether the so-called combat support
 role now authorized-combat in support of
 South    Vietnamese  units-is  to  be trans-
 formed later into offensive clear and hold op-
 erations of a kind hitherto, carried out only
 by South Vietnamese forces.  Apart from the
 obvious  difficulty  American troops   would
 have in distinguishing guerrillas from the
 surrounding population, such a war ulti-
 mately might absorb as many American
 troops as were employed in Korea.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 A major factor in the original escalation
 decision-the decision to bomb North Viet-
 nam-was the political crisis in Saigon after
 eight changes of government in little more
 than a year.  The bombing was urged upon
 President Johnson as the only way to shore
 up morale, halt the factional feuding, and
 prevent a complete political collapse in South
 Vietnam.
 Is it only a coincidence that the decision
 to enter the ground war has come during
 another;, political  crisis in Saigon?   There
 may be a need to prop up the government
 of Premier, Phan Huy Quat against the Cath-
 olic and southern factions which made a
 constitutional issue out of his recent Cabi-
 net reshuffle and still seek to bring him
 down.  But, is it not more likely that politi-
 cal  irresponsibility  in Saigon will  grow,
 rather than decline, as the main military
 responsibility for defending South Vietnam
 is  transferred  increasingly  to American
 hands.?
 The country deserves answers to this and
 many other questions.  It has been taken
 into a ground war by Presidential decision,
 when there Is no emergency that would seem
 to rule out congressional debate.  The duty
 now is for reassurance from the White House
 that the Nation will be informed on where it
 is being led and that Congress will be con-
 sulted before another furious upward whirl
 is taken on the escalation spiral.
 ExriIBIT 2
 .[From the New York Times, June
 .Signs are growing of congressional interest
 in ending the "leave it to Lyndon" era in
 American foreign policy.
 There is'Senator FULBRIGHT's new proposal
 to give the OAS a major voice in channeling
 American military` assistance to Latin Amer-
 ica. There is the provision In the new foreign
 aid bill for a thoroughgoing congressional
 investigation and for terminating the aid
 program In its present form in 1967.
 There is the trip to Europe, at their own
 expense, of four House Republicans to in-
 vestigate the crisis in NATO. And there are
 the recent criticisms of administration policy
 in Vietnam and the ]Dominican Republic by
 Senator ROSERT F. KENNEDY, plus his current
 charge that the United States is neither meet-
 ing its aid responsibilities to the underde-
 veloped countries nor identifying itself with
 the world revolution underway in those areas.
 Factors that  go beyond  the President's
 limited experience in foreign affairs and the
 extraordinary  vacillations in  Dominician
 policy have set off the present questioning
 at home and abroad.     The reluctance of Sec-
 retary of State Rusk to employ the full re-
 sources of his department and give inde-
 pendent advice, the meager use made by the
 President of nonofficial task forces in the
 foreign policy field, the overdependence on
 military and intelligence agencies and the
 divorce between the administration and the
 Nation's lptellectuals-all point to a need.
 for more vigorous congressional interest.
 Nowhere is this more vital than on Viet-
 nam, where grave constitutional questions
 are raised by the official acknowledgment of
 an  increasing  combat  role  for . American
 troops.  During the 18 months of the John-
 son administration, the number of Amer-
 ican trA' s in Vietnam has been tripled to
 about    5bfi;  a further buildup  to more
 than 6G,000 appears imminent.      American
 planes have entered into combat both in
 South and North Vietnam-in the latter
 case openly attacking a foreign country with
 no declaration of war.  American warships
 have bombarded the North Vietnamese coast.
 And there are Indications that American
 ground troops-first employed as advisers In
 South Vietnam,  then  deployed  to defend

 gaged in patrolling action-will soon take on
 a full combat role as a tactical reserve aid-
 ing South Vietnamese units in trouble.
 Yet, at no point has there been signifi-
 cant congressional discussion, much less di-
 rect authorization of what amounts to a
 decision to wage war.  That is why 28 Demo-
 cratic congressmen, on the initiative of Rep-
 resentative ROSENTIAL, of Queens, now have
 wisely asked the chairman of the House For-
 eign Affairs Committee to hold public hear-
 ings on the administration's Vietnam pol-
 icy.
 American casualties in Vietnam, while still
 relatively minor, already exceed those of the
 Spanish-American War.   The choices open
 to  the  President  are  exceedingly  difficult
 ones;  they should not be his alone, either
 as a matter of sound policy or of constitu-
 tional obligation.                                                                                  If he takes it upon him-
 self to make an American war out of the
 Vietnamese tragedy-without seeking         con-
 gressional  and national consent-he may
 open the country to divisions even more dan-
 gerous than those that developed out of the
 Korean conflict.

 PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S PERSONAL WAR
 (By Drew Pearson)
 War, no matter what the circumstances,
 is                  tragic  business.  However,  the  war  In
 Vietnam has also become a lonely war and
 to some extent a personal war for one man.
 This is not because the. President began
 it.                 It began 18 years ago under the French,
 was picked up 10 years ago by President
 Eisenhower, and increased 4 years ago by
 President Kennedy.
 It's become personal today because the
 President feels it so keenly and directs it so
 carefully.  Every morning at 3 he wakes up
 and calls the White House Security Room.
 Three in the morning is about the time the
 news is in from Vietnam on the casualties
 and the hits after each bombing raid.
 The President worries over these, broods
 over them, wants to know, no matter what
 the  hour  of  the  night,  just  what  has
 happened.
 One reason for this personal direction is
 that the President is worried over the possi-
 bility of enlarging the war.                                                                                  He knows how
 easy It is for bomber pilots to make a mis-
 take, or how dangerous it can be to jettison
 their bombs on their way home.
 On the usual wartime bombing raid, a
 mission. will fly over a target, attempt to
 knock it out; but if the clouds are low or an
 enemy plane gives trouble, the bombers may
 drop their payload indiscriminately on the
 way back, regardless of military targets.
 TARGETS OF CONCRETE
 Not, however, with the war in Vietnam.
 Mr. Johnson has given strict orders that only
 the targets he picks out are to be hit-and
 these are bridges, ammunition dumps, rail-
 road centers and military installations.
 "We're knocking out concrete, we're not
 hitting women and children," he has fre-
 quently told his aides.
 In addition to his care to avoid civilian
 casualties he is concerned over any bombing
 mission that might stray over the line into
 China, or give the Communist Chinese the
 slightest provocation to enlarge the war.
 This is..why the war In and over Vietnam
 has been a lonely war, a personal war di-
 rected by a man who goes to bed well after
 midnight, but wakes up automatically at 3
 a.m. to check on the military targets he has
 personally pinpointed.
 Under the Constitution, he tells friends,
 he Is charged with the conduct of war.  But
 regardless  of  the  Constitution,  he knows
 that, if there are failures, or if the war
 spreads, he will get the blame.  So he is tak-
 ing the responsibility.
 12531
 INSOLUBLE MESS
 When the President outlined his Baltimore
 peace proposals they were also personal, espe-
 cially his plan for a giant series of dams on
 the Mekong River to benefit all the Indochi-
 nese countries, including North Vietnam.
 Mr. Johnson had hoped that this, coupled
 with his offer of unconditional peace talks,
 plus joint United States-U.S.S.R. aid, might
 induce the other side to sit down at the con-
 ference table.  It didn't, for three reasons:
 The North Vietnamese have been winning.
 Our bombing raids have not stopped the sup-
 ply of, troops and supplies from going south
 or the guerrilla raids by the Vietcong.
 The Russians, who normally might have
 acted as intermediaries, were put on the spot
 by our bombing of the north.  The Chinese
 have chided them with being too friendly to
 the United States in the past, and with for-
 saking their alleged former role as the cham-
 pion of small nations.  So it's difficult for
 them to side with the United States now.
 The Chinese are delighted at the predica-
 ment of both Moscow and Washington.  They
 don't want the Vietnamese war to end. The
 longer it lasts, the more the United States
 and Russia become at swords' points, and the
 more the smaller nations of 'southeast Asia
 pull away from the United States into the
 Red Chinese camp.
 In brief, the military advisers who sold
 the President on the strategy of bombing
 North Vietnam failed to understand oriental
 politics.  Though he inherited the Vietna-
 mese problem, they sold him on enlarging it
 into a mess that. could either lead to world
 war or is almost insoluble without serious
 loss of face.
 BEHIND THE SCENES
 The Central Intelligence Agency is using a
 mysterious airline that calls itself Air Amer-
 ica to drop weapons and supplies to our guer-
 rilla fighters in  Communist-held  areas of
 Laos and Vietnam.  The CIA is trying to give
 the Reds a taste of their own guerrilla medi-

 eavesdropping.

 (By Beverly Deepe)
 SAIGON.-One of the biggest puzzles of the
 Vietnam war is what makes the Communist
 Vietcong guerrillas fight so hard.
 "It's fantastic the way the Vietcong lay it
 on," a Vietnamese-speaking American pro-
 vincial representative commented.
 "Young kids who fought with them explain
 it by saying the Vietcong create a 'new order
 and a new reality: "
 According to reliabie persons who have
 talked with Vietcong prisoners and defectors,
 the Vietcong manpower-composed of 38,000
 to 46,000 hard-core fighters and 60,000 to
 80,000 part-time guerrillas--falls into two
 main categories: The older generation troops
 who fought against the French 15 to 20 years
 ago and a younger generation recruited in
 South Vietnam.
 Of the  first  category, more than 70,000
 Vietminh-as they were called during the
 French Indochina War-left their homes in
 South Vietnam when the country was parti-
 tioned in 1954 and went to North Vietnam,
 where  they  continued their training and
 indoctrination.
 INFILTRATION
 From 1956 onward, they gradually infil-
 trated back to their native villages.  The
 most significant aspect of their return was
 a transfusion of political leadership into the
 south to organize and recruit younger south-

 erners. Simultaneously, the Communists be-
 gan a massive campaign of assassination of
 village government officials, virtually obliter-
 ating the Government's local leadership.
 The older troops had fought the French
 for one reason: Independence, with its anti-
 French,  anticolonial,  antiwhite  overtones.
 They fought and won with guns, but their
 most effective weapon was hate.
 One member of a Vietminh suicide squad
 wrapped himself in gasoline-soaked cotton,
 ran into a French ammunition depot in Sai-
 gon and burned himself alive to destroy the
 installation.  The story of the cotton boy
 swept through the countryside.
 "My .father even wanted me to volunteer
 to be a cotton boy," a Saigon businessman
 recently recalled.
 Young Vietnamese students read French
 history books referring to "our ancestors, the
 Gauls"  This example of French accultura-
 tion was countered by the Vietminh argu-
 ment: "Please remember, your ancestors were
 not the French.  You know your ancestors
 were the dragon and the fairy," a legend com-
 monly accepted by the population.
 According to prisoners in the older group,
 once they returned to South Vietnam in the
 late 1950's, they were surprised at what they
 found.  They had been told the south must
 be liberated from its own poverty.  One said
 he was astonished to see the Government
 troopers wearing boots.  (Communist troops
 often wear rubber-tire sandals.)
 Another said he had been told that two-
 thirds of South Vietnam had been liberated.
 But when he attacked Government villages
 the peasants fought his men.   They had
 been told they must liberate the south from
 the American imperialists, but soon discov-
 ered they were fighting Vietnamese.
 But few of these veterans defected to the
 government side.  One oldtime propaganda
 agent captured in the south explained that
 he listened to the Voice of America and
 British Broadcasting Corp. to discover the
 truth.  But he listened to the Hanoi radio
 to find out the correct party line.
 He reasoned that if the party lied, there
 must be a good reason for it.  The party
 knew best.
 The younger generation Vietcong troops
 join the liberation army for different rea-
 sons.  Some of them are virtually kidnaped.
 Others have personal grievances or are sim-
 ply bored with life in the villages.  The
 Vietcong promise  them  adventure,  and a
 chance to see life and be educated.
 There is no sharp overriding national cause
 which the Vietcong are pushing throughout
 the country, such as the anti-French cam-
 paign.  But there are grievances.
 Some unmarried males join to get away
 from their landowners.  Some are fired from
 their jobs and join.    Many prefer serving
 with the Vietcong rather than government
 forces because they believe they can stay
 closer to their families.
 Some young married men join to get away
 from the in-laws;  the Communists in the
 village promise to take care of the wife and
 children.  (One Vietcong trooper returned to
 his  village,  found  his  wife  and  children
 destitute, picked Zip a rifle and shot up the
 Vietcong   village committee.)    One      was
 talked into joining when a pretty girl prom-
 ised to marry him if he did; he became dis-
 illusioned when he found she had promised
 to marry six other recruits also.
 Some are simply kidnaped at gunpoint.
 One was led away with a rope around his
 neck.  One was kidnaped only hours after
 his wedding.
 One reliable source estimated that about
 10 to 15 percent of the southern-born Viet-
 cong troops were orphans.  About 30 percent
 are farm laborers,  About 80 percent came
 In the West, the war in Vietnam is an
 ideological confrontation with communism.
 In Vietnam, this is not the way it is regarded
 by many of the Vietcong.
 The Communists operate behind the mask
 of the National Liberation Front, which ex-
 ploits nationalism and xenophobism. It dis-
 guises its Communist core philosophy by
 sloganeering about freedom and democracy.
 One Western diplomat explained the Com-
 munist appeal in these words: "The Commu-
 nists. have swiped the American ideals.  The
 Communists are promising the peasants a
 New, Fair, Square Deal-land, reform, demo-
 cratic elections, land courts for justice."
 Hence, the appeal of the communist guer-
 rilla movement is not communism at all.
 One Americas, official explained that of more
 than 200 Vietcong prisoners and returnees he
 interviewed, not one mentioned anything
 about Marxism-Leninism, atheism, collective
 farms.
 But the Vietcong also have a strong appeal
 for youth.  "The Vietcong promise them
 fun-that life will be gay," one source said.
 "Many of those who join believe they get
 this."
 Even if a youth has been forced to join the
 Vietcong, a highly effective indoctrination
 session immediately begins to mold him into
 an enthusiastic, well-disciplined fighter.
 Perhaps, this can be seen in their songs.
 Neil Jamieson, 29, a Vietnamese-speaking
 provincial  representative  from  Gloucester
 City, N.J., translated a number of Vietcong
 songs and talked with incoming Vietcong de-
 fectors.
 One of the songs goes:
 "We are peasants in soldier's clothing, wag-
 ing the struggle for a class oppressed for
 thousands of years; our suffering is the suf-
 fering of the people.
 "Many of their songs are centered on vic-
 tory," Mr. Jamieson said.  "They associate the
 soldiers with the peasants-fighting oppres-
 sion, not only against the foreigners, but also
 the upper classes within society.
 "The troops accept-in fact, glorify-hard-
 ship because it identifies them with the peo-
 ple.  It's almost like old Christianity.  It's
 like little kids' Sunday School hymns-the
 idea of picking up the Cross for Jesus but in-
 stead of a cross it's a pack."
 He said most of the Vietcong songs were
 "upbeat, emphasizing the positive in a Nor-
 man Vincent Peale manner."  Government
 songs were often sad.
 A SPARTAN LIFE
 "The young troops lived a very spartan
 life," Mr. Jamieson continued.   They were
 short of medicine, and all suffered attacks
 of malaria. Many suffered real hardships. It
 was cold in the jungle, yet they didn't dare
 light a big fire.
 "I talked with many of the Vietcong about
 their songs," he said.  "After their evening
 meal, they would break into teams of three
 and have their self-criticism sessions.  Each
 one would go through his experiences of the
 day, his life in society, and in his three-man
 combat team.  If one of them was wounded
 in combat, the two buddies would take care
 of him.
 "After supper they would go through this
 ritual.  They are taught to do this immedi-
 ately after joining the Vietcong by the older
 cadre, who told them that sins can be for-
 given but to conceal anything is  a blow
 against the group.
 "If for example, the young trooper had
 lost his ammunition or weapon, he'd criticize
 himself.  Thts psychological aspect is a great
 Vietcong strength.
 "After the  self-criticism  session,  there
 would be announcements by the cadre and
 then would sit around and sing to pass their
 time in the evening.     They would sit around
 a small campfire, if security permitted-just
 like the Boy Scouts used to do.   These youths
 were uneducated, but the Communists taught
 them about the sputnik and Castro and Cuba.
 They didn't understand it well, but they knew
 Cuba was a tiny country near America and
 America was a paper tiger when Cuba stood
 up to us and we were powerless to do any-
 thing to them.
 "The troops were short of rice, yet each.
 day they put a few grains from each meal in
 a bamboo tube.  When there was enough
 they'd take it to a tribal village and have a
 party for the children.
 "One youthful trooper was with the Viet-
 cong for 3 years, and was a member of their
 youth organization, which is ., the halfway
 point to becoming a party member.  He was
 recruited at gunpoint, but he didn't hate the
 Vietcong."
 He told me: "If I told you what I thought
 about out there in the jungle you'd think
 I was crazy.  The Vietcong create a new real-
 ity; you feel you are in the world and not out
 of it."

 OUR  GIRL  IN  VIEr-II:  AMERICA'S  FROZEN
 POLICY-VITAL POLITICAL POWER UNUSED
 (By Beverly Deepe)
 SAIGON.-U.S. policy in South Vietnam is
 frozen in a negative posture that concen-
 trates on military victory while failing to
 produce the sort of dramatic political strat-
 egy that would make such victory possible.
 This,  at least, is the opinion of highly
 placed sources in Saigon who have watched
 the American Involvement here grow steadily
 for more than a decade.
 In their view, the U.S. attitude is essen-
 tially  anti-Communist  rather  than  pro-
 something.  The overwhelming impression
 is that the American policymakers are at-
 tempting to stem the tide of Communist
 aggression or to teach Hanoi a lesson. But
 this Implies a political status quo in a coun-
 try  that  is changing in  its  postcolonial
 development and  is, indeed, fighting for
 change.
 "Nothing negative has ever prevailed over
 something  positive," the  western military
 expert commented.  "One of the most fre-
 quently asked questions by Vietnamese cap-
 tains and majors on the battlefront is, `What
 are we fighting for?' as they look at the po-
 litical turmoil in their rear area at Saigon."
 HOLLOW WORDS
 While some Americans in Saigon pay lip-
 service to the principles of freedom and
 democracy, these are, as one American Gov-
 ernment employee noted, "hollow words that
 mean little in Asia."
 A Western diplomat argues that the West-
 ern concepts of democracy and freedom have
 never been simplified and codified as have
 the  Communist  Ideology.   There  are  no
 American primers for  democracy as there
 are Communist primers for revolution.
 "One cannot understand these American
 principles unless he has reaped the benefits
 of them or seen them firsthand," the diplo-
 mat explained.  Hence, he said, the princi-
 ples in which Americans believe must be
 translated, demonstrated, and visualized for
 the Vietnamese by the Vietnamese Govern-
 ment, and this has yet to be done.
 The  main political problem during  the
 past decade seems to have been to realize
 there  Is a  political  problem  and  to  act
 positively.
 The  American   policymakers,  however,
 view the battle in Vietnam as principally, if
 not  solely, a  military   operation against
 armed communist guerrillas.     They are op-
 erating dramatically on one front while the
 Communists are operating on six fronts--
 political, economic, social, cultural, psycho-
 logical, and military, all integrated into one
 powerful stream of warfare.
 "Suppose you lose your billfoldin a dark
 place," one Vietnamese provincial official ex-
 plained.  "But you insist on looking for it
 where there is light because It is easier.
 Well, you are now looking for the Commu-
 nists in the light place-the military field--
 but you never, never find them all-they are
 also where you refuse to look."

 200,000 refugees in the central part of the
 country-victims of an autumn flood, Com-

 were not made a symbol of non-Communist
 revolution by the Vietnamese government.
 "They are given charity rice and propaganda
 lectures," he said. "They should be put in
 factories and apartment houses to show the
 world the benefits of fleeing the Communist
 side. Some anti-Communist refugees are not
 given help by the government, and return to
 Vietcong areas."
 Another source criticized the American of-
 ficials for not forcing the Diem regime years
 ago to establish "centers of prosperity" in
 which the Vietnamese people and the outside
 world could see the results of the American
 presence.
 A high-ranking Western official suggests
 that television should have been widely in-
 troduced in Vietnam to relay government
 propaganda to the villages, to educate the
 children and to show adult films on better
 ,farming methods.
 More than 3 years ago, private Japanese
 companies made such proposals for this, and
 the Japanese Government has tentatively of-
 fered technical assistance and funds.  A tele-
 vision station would cost $500,000.
 But  successive  Vietnamese  governments
 have postponed a decision on this project
 COMMUNISM FIRST
 The Vietcong military apparatus is of a
 secondary, supporting nature to the Com-
 munist political machine.  Hence American
 efforts to defeat the guerrillas still have not
 defeated the political subversive.  American
 advisers in the provinces admit that even
 when the Communist guerrillas are defeated
 militarily, the Communist political cell sys-
 tem in the village is rarely destroyed.
 The appearance of new French faces on the
 main street of Saigon, the arrival of increas-
 ing number of proneutralist Vietnamese from
 Paris, and the release of thousands of pro-
 neutralist and pro-Communist Vietnamese
 from prison within the last 18 months is
 more important in the subversive field than
 the introduction of American combat ma-
 rines and paratroopers is in the counter-
 guerrilla military field.
 "With  the  amount  of  money  you  are
 spending in the military field," one Viet-
 namese major said, "you could buy all the
 land from the landowners and give it to the
 peasants.  You could pave  Vietnam with
 gold."

 GIRL  IN VIET-III: - CORRUPTION-
 HOTTEST SAIGON ISSUE
 (By Beverly Deepe)
 SAIGON.-The  hottest issue in Saigon is
 not bombing Hanoi, nor Vietcong terrorism,
 nor possible negotiations for peace.   It  is
 corruption.
 Vietnamese   sources-generals,   majors,
 captains, ex-ministers, economists-say that
 corruption has now reached scandalous, un-
 precedented proportions.
 Highly placed sources in Saigon-Ameri-
 can, Vietnamese, and Western-urged tighter
 controls on Vietnamese Government funds
 and on American aid and goods.
 The issue is considered a gift for the Viet-
 cong Communists, who promise the workers
 and peasants justice and equality.  It also
 has caused friction within the Vietnamese
 Government and armed forces.
 gories-military and economic.  During the
 past decade $1.1 billion was given to Vietnam
 through  the  U.S. military assistance pro-
 gram.  This program gives guns, ammuni-
 tion, bombs, and other equipment                                                                                                                                         to the
 Vietnamese armed forces.
 The original purpose of American advisers
 was to train Vietnamese to use the equip-
 ment-"and to keep track of the equipment,
 which  sometimes  took  some  doing,"  one
 American captain who worked on the pro-
 gram for 2 years said.
 "We brought in air conditioners for hos-
 pitals-they ended up in the general's house.
 We brought in hospital refrigerators to store
 vaccines in.  The vaccines spoiled and the
 refrigerators wound  up  in  the  general's
 house."
 The second broad category totaling $2.1
 billion during the past decade is the eco-
 nomic aid program administered through the
 AID.
 However, of the 10-year economic aid pro-
 gram, 75 percent has been channeled into
 the commercial import program and sales
 under the food-for-peace program.  It is this
 program, copied from the Marshall plan for
 Europe after World War II, that highly placed
 sources in Saigon believe should be reap-
 praised.
 SPECIAL KITTY
 The  commercial  import  program,  plus
 selling of American farm surplus goods, calls
 for the importing of goods from America or
 U.S.-authorized  countries. The American
 Government pays the exporter in dollars for
 the  goods.  The  Vietnamese  importer in
 Saigon pays the Vietnamese in piasters.
 These  American-generated     piasters are
 then put in a special kitty belonging to the
 Vietnamese Government.  This counterpart
 fund primarily is used to pay the operating
 expenses of the Vietnamese national armed
 forces and to supplement Vietnam's other
 revenues.
 The total amount of piasters budgeted by
 the Vietnamese Government in 1964 was 37.1
 billion,  but only 31.5  was actually spent
 which created the impression in Saigon, even
 among Vietnamese economists, that "there's
 too much money in Saigon.  We cannot ab-
 sorb it all."

 Second, the commercial import program
 has enriched and enlarged the upper-mid-
 dle-class, elements in Saigon and other cities,
 but it has also accentuated the extremes be-
 tween the urban and rural classes.  "Often
 you bring in a whole lot of things for the
 richer middle class with conspicuous con-
 sumption, and the Vietcong can play on
 this, saying it enriches the middle class and
 bourgeois," one Western ambassador said.
 Third, the rural communities, especially
 earlier in the program, received a relatively
 small proportion of the commercial import
 aid.  Between 1955 and 1960, when the Viet-
 cong began organizing and recruiting in the
 countryside, only 4 percent of the direct and
 indirect American aid was funneled into the
 rural population, which is an estimated 85
 percent of the total population.

 background, money, or land ownership. This
 elite minority attempts to govern the masses
 although it knows little about them and is
 concerned less.
 The elite's lack of concern and compas-
 sion was illustrated in an incident related
 by the wife of a western embassy official.
 The wives of embassy officials had voluntarily
 presented furniture, clothing, and toys to a
 local orphanage.
 "Several days after we handed over the
 goods, one of the embassy wives returned
 to the orphanage," the lady explained.  "We
 were astonished to find the ofiiciala had even
 taken the toys out of the hands of little
 orphans.   The toys  were  nowhere  to   be
 found."
 In contrast, cadre wanting to join the
 Communist Party are sent to live with the
 rural masses and practice "three together-
 ness"; eating, liding, and working with the
 peasants.  Cadre are invited to join the Com-
 munist Party-which has an exclusive, and
 not mass membership-when they are pre-
 pared to govern.
 "The Americans had to play with the cards
 that were dealt out and they weren't very
 good cards," one Western diplomat explained.
 "In Vietnam, nationalism went the Commu-
 nist way.  We saw a lot of Vietnamese in
 the South who are the political forces in the
 country * * * they are the bourgeois, the
 landowners, the Catholics.  They believe in
 the same ideas as we do; we support these
 people and they support us. But these peo-
 ple in an Asian country in the throes of
 political-social upheaval-they are not in the
 mainstream."
 The diplomat continued:
 "They're on the edges-we're supporting
 them and the mainstream is elsewhere-in
 the nationalist movement of the Commu-
 nists. The mainstream elements got into the
 hands of Ho.Chi Minh in North Vietnam and
 Mao Tse-tung in China.  Chiang Kai-shek
 didn't have the nationalist issue; he was
 helped by the United States-and this In
 turn made it more likely he'd lose."
 MANDARIN SYSTEM
 The lack of justice and equal opportunity
 Is perhaps best reflected in the medical pro-
 fession in Vietnam, which one American-
 educated Vietnamese doctor called "the med-
 ical mafia."       Two elite groups of doctors-
 the faculty of medicine at University of
 Saigon and a private organization called the
 Medical Syndicate-decide which doctors will
 the licensed for private practice.  Virtually
 all the members of these groups come from
 Hanoi and favor licensing only northerners.
 "These seven older-generation men in the
 faculty of medicine are capable and dedi-
 cated," one  American  official  working                       in
 medical field said, "They just happen to be
 partisan.  They represent the old mandarin
 system; they choose, select-and limit the
 leaders of the future.  It's the tradition in
 the East for more than 1,000 years that lead-
 ers of the next generation are always chosen
 by those in power.  This gives rise to the
 mandarin system and an undue amount of
 nepotism."
 After 10 years of administering the largest
 U.S. medical aid program in the world-
 American officials here still have little in-
 fluence on Vietnamese medical affairs.  One
 American-trained  Vietnamese  doctor said
 that a medical degree from an American med-
 ical school still is not readily recognized in
 tion (although there are two American-op-
 erated hospitals in France).  Requests by
 the American-operated Seventh-day Advent-
 1st Missionary Hospital to expand their 30-
 bed clinic have repeatedly been refused.
 American officials in Saigon have not ef-
 fectively pressured the Saigon government
 to correct "this rot within," in the words of
 a Vietnamese anti-Communist.  Instead they
 have superimposed upon "the rot" a spec-
 tacular medical program in the provinces.
 "The Americans think we should fight for
 democracy,"  one young Vietnamese  intel-
 lectual explained.  "But in fact, the Viet-
 cong fight because of the lack of democracy."

 OUR GIRL IN VIET-V: LAND REFORM-THE
 LONG DELAY
 - (By Beverly Deeps)
 SAIGON.-"The most important question in
 the Vietnamese countryside besides security
 is land reform," an American technician said.
 "Yet virtually nothing has been done about
 it.
 "The Vietcong are gaining a lot of points
 with the peasants by simply issuing land
 titles-and  it  costs  them  nothing.  They
 take the land from the landowner and give
 It away.  Nothing we give to the peasants-
 like pigs, insecticides, or fertilizer-is as im-
 portant as land."
 American technicians and provincial offi-
 cials for the past several years have urged
 the implementation of an effective land re-
 form   program.  Two   land   distribution
 schemes currently have been written, but
 neither has been accepted.  Higher officials
 in the American Embassy and in the Agency
 for International Development believe "land
 reform is not the panacea for Vietnam's
 problems."
 A program for the training of land-reform
 cadre is under consideration.  But the pro-
 gram will not be instituted until "the other
 day"-when the Vietcong Communists have
 been defeated.
 WARNING
 However, one Vietnamese general recently
 warned American generals and officials that
 American-backed efforts to pacify the prov-
 inces would fail'unless they were linked with
 land reform.
 "When the Vietnamese National Army goes
 back to pacify areas from the Vietcong, the
 local landowner goes back with them, offer-
 ing to serve as intelligence agent," the gen-
 eral explained.  "Obviously he wants to col-
 lect his back rent.  So when the army pacifies
 the area it pacifies it for the landowner and
 not for the peasant.
 "Of course, 35 percent of the peasants are
 landless.  They become  fanatics  and  will
 fight for the land given them by the Vietcong
 because It's as important to them as life."
 One  U.S.  official  described  as  "horror
 stories" the actions of some landowners to
 collect back rent, once government forces
 had pacified Vietcong areas.
 According  to  reliable  sources,  in other
 cases, when the Vietnamese Government
 Army attempts to pacify the area, the com-
 manders simply ignore the problems of land
 reform, refusing to collect back rents-but
 also refusing to confirm the land ownership
 rights.
 Vietnam, on the other hand, a parachute de-             or their agents return to collect back rent
 gree-a degree virtually bought with money               the matter is simple.  The peasant complains
 from  a  second-rate  medical  school  in               to the Vietcong, and the agent is shot.

 not the strength of the Vietcong appeal so
 much as the accessibility to rural masses
 for Communist recruiting.
 Furthermore, an estimated 30 percent of
 the Vietcong strength recruited in the South
 are considered to belong to the "farm labor
 class," the lowest in the semi-Confucianistic
 rigidly stratified rural society.
 The five rural classes in Vietnamese coun-
 tryside area are: the landowners (who lease
 out all the land they own) ; the rich peasants
 (who own more land than they till, and lease
 out some of It); the middle-class peasants
 (who own. all they till); the tenant farmers
 (who rent all their lands), and the farm
 laborers  (who  cannot rent land, but are
 seasonally\hired for planting and harvesting).
 "The  question  of land reform  is  quite
 simple," one low-ranking Vietnamese pro-
 vincial official explained.  "The government
 represents the landowners; the ministers and
 generals are either landowners or friends of
 landowners. The  Catholic   Church  owns
 land.  The  Buddhist  Church  owns  land.
 Nobody Is Interested in fighting for the poor
 peasant.  And the top Americans-well, they
 talk to only the ministers and rich people so
 they don't push it either."
 LANDOWNERS
 One Vietnamese general recalled that dur-
 ing the war with the Communists against the
 French in the early fifties, he was ordered
 by imperial decree to have landowners in his
 security district in North Vietnam divide up
 the land with the peasants.  There were two
 large landowners in the area, he recalled, one
 of them a Roman Catholic bishop and the
 second a relative of the then Finance Min-
 .fater.
 "The Catholic bishop refused to divide the
 land because he said he had to support 2,500
 seminary students with the rent money, and
 the big landowner also refused," the general
 explained.  "I warned them both if they
 didn't give the land to the peasants the
 Communists would take over not only the
 land, but also the seminary and the land-
 owner's house.  But they wouldn't listen.
 The big landowner told the Finance Minis-
 ter what I was doing.  I was quickly trans-
 fered to another place-and 3 years later the
 Communists took over."
 The land-reform  issue in Vietnam-in-
 volving not only issuing of land titles, but
 also law enforcement on land rents, land
 security for tenants and fixed rates on the
 interest of borrowing of money-is not con-
 sidered as acute as in other parts of Asia.
 The Japanese say, for example, that a peasant
 without land is like a man without a soul.
 The victory of Chinese Communists in taking
 over mainland China was achieved not so
 much by armed guerrillas as by the promise
 of  land  to  the  poverty-stricken,  landless
 peasantry.
 "The land for the landless" campaign in
 the  Philippines   virtually  broke  the  back
 of  the   Hukbalahap  insurrection    in   the
 fifties.
 According to reliable sources, the Vietcong
 guerrillas in Vietnam have a haphazard, in-
 consistent land-reform program which varies
 from area to area in sections of the country
 they control.  However, the current govern-
 ment has virtually no program at all.  One
 American provincial official estimated that
 the Vietcong had issued land titles to 50
 percent of the peasant families in his prov-
 ince; the government had issued none.
 In some areas, the Vietcong take some of
 the land from the rich peasants and give it
 to the landless tenant-who still pays rent,
 to the Vietcong.
 So far, the Vietcong have not killed or
 harassed the rich peasants as they did before
 their seizure of power In North Vietnam.
 In some cases, the Vietcong program In the
 rural areas is considered self-defeating. They

 OUR GIRL IN VIEr-CONCLUSION:  THE PRO-
 GRAM THE REDS CAN'T FIGHT
 (By Beverly Deepe)
 SAIGON.-This is the story of the three little
 pigs of Vietnam.
 It  is  one of the  most  visibly  effective
 American-sponsored programs in rural Viet-
 nam against which the Communist Vietcong
 guerrillas have many arguments but no real
 answer.
 In early 1962, American provincial repre-
 sentatives of the Agency for International
 Development (AID) began distributing im-
 proved white pigs from the Mekong Delta
 throughout the entire countryside.
 The program called for a package deal in
 which eight bags of cement would be given
 to build a combination pig sty-compost pit,
 while three improved pigs and American sur-
 plus corn would be lent to the farmer.
 One of the pigs would later be marketed,
 which would repay the entire $50 cost of the
 venture; the others would be kept for breed-
 ing.
 "The pigs had a fantastic impact," one
 American agricultural technican explained.
 "The farmers followed the old Chine cus-
 tom and washed their pigs daily.  Some of
 them put red ribbons around the ears of
 the pigs.  Almost all the pigs became pets
 for the children."
 BUT WHY CEMENT?
 "Of course, we had a few problems.  Some

 cong pressure, and other large tracts, now
 uncultivated, could be developed into ex-
 cellent farming land.
 Despite this, the standard of living has
 improved  during  the  last  10  years.  Ten
 years ago, a bicycle was a status symbol; now
 motor scooters, bicycles, and buses are reg-
 ularly seen in the Countryside.
 The nationwide statistics on education are
 also impressive.  In 1955, 329,000 pupils at-
 tended elementary public schools.  In 1964,
 the number had increased to 1.5 million.
 In 1964 alone, 900 new rural schools were
 built and 1,000 elementary education teach-
 ers                                                                                                                                were  trained.  A total  of 4,000 rural
 schools was built in the decade.
 In 1955, there were 2,900 university stu-
 dents in Vietnam.                                                                                                                                    By 1964, the number had
 increased to 20,000, with a new university
 established in the northern provinces.  More
 than 2,500 Vietnamese students and techni-
 cians have been sent to America through
 AID programs for advanced degrees.
 However, the population growth is 2.8 per-
 cent yearly.
 In the rural health field, Vietnamese vil-
 lagers often find it difficult to understand
 what  has been prevented-such as cholera
 epidemics or malaria.   During the  last 6
 years, however,  the  American-backed  $12
 million malaria-eradication program, part of
 a worldwide effort, has dropped known ma-
 laria cases from 7.22 percent to less than I
 percent.
 SPRAYING OF HOMES
 More  than  1  million  Vietnamese  farm
 homes are being sprayed twice a year. More
 than 6 million persons have been directly
 affected  by  the spraying.  The Vietcong
 propagandists told the villagers the spray
 would cause their thatched roofs to crumble
 or would kill their cats and chickens.
 "The Vietcong say the farmers don't have
 enough cats to eat all the rats," one Ameri-
 can medical expert explained, "and the rats
 eat  rice.  They use  this  argument  when
 there's a poor crop of rice and a good crop
 of  rats-and  it's  very  effective  with the
 peasants."
 The malaria rate has dropped to the ex-
 tent that medical experts simply keep tabs
 on it by collecting blood samples.
 "The Vietcong spread the word that the
 Americans were collecting Vietnamese blood
 to give to the wounded Americans," the medi-
 cal expert continued.  "This even happened
 on the outskirts of Saigon.  One American
 educational lecturer started to give a lecture
 on the taking of these blood samples for
 malaria control; suddenly all the mamas and
 little kids started throwing rocks at him.
 "The police had to escort him out-all be-
 cause of that outlandish Vietcong propa-
 ganda.  But Vietnamese people don't like to
 give blood; they are superstitious about that
 and it's very strange to them."
 More than 8,000 rural health workers arc
 currently operating in the Vietnamese coun-
 tryside.  Nine gleaming white surgical suites
 costing $500,000 each, have been established
 throughout the country and are staffed by
 Americans, Filipinos, New Zealanders, Aus-
 tralians, and Italians.

 THE ESCALATING WAR
 (By Richard Starnes)
 The American people are not alone in their
 blissful ignorance of the coming demands for
 men to feed the insatiable jungle war in
 Vietnam.                                A completely reliable source who
 was present at a White House briefing tall:;
 me this:
 "I saw U.S. Senators blanch when Robert
 McNamara told them that they had to pre-
 pare to see 300,000 American men sent, to
 Vietnam.

 of the villages." he said.
 "The neighbors buy little pigs from the
 first family to have them.  In one northern
 city, 2 years ago you wouldn't see one im-
 proved pig a day come through the slaughter-
 house.                                                                        Now  about  one-third  of  a  day's
 production is the improved breed."
 REPAYMENTS
 He explained that the Vietcong political
 cadre attempted to sabotage the program by
 telling the farmers that it was a "giveaway
 program" rather than a loan, so that the
 farmers would not make repayment to the
 Government.  So far, the rate of repayment
 has been low, but in most cases the  18-
 month deadline for repayment has not been
 reached.
 "The pig program doesn't make the farmer
 pro-Government or pro-Vietcong," the tech-
 nician explained.  "But it does expose him
 to the Government cadre, to the Government
 administration   and   to   an   American
 veterinarian.  Maybe this is the first time in
 the farmer's life that the Government has
 done something to help him.  So gradually,
 it creates a better feeling for the Govern-
 ment.
 "The Vietcong do not steal the pigs, and
 we have lost very few of our pig hamlets to
 the Vietcong."
 In addition to the pig program, Vietnamese
 agricultural technicians, assisted by Ameri-
 cans, have also started programs to improve
 ducks, chickens, and cattle and to promote
 a wider distribution of water buffaloes, which
 are used to pull the farmers' plows.
 Other technicians have established experi-
 mental  stations  for  improving  rice  seed
 (which some Vietnamese prefer to eat rather
 than use for seeding).
 Recently, Vietnamese agricultural agents
 conducted 3-day courses on improved farm-
 ing techniques for farmers during the slack
 season.  Twenty piasters (30 cents) was given
 the farmers for lunches "and that really had
 an impact," one American agricultural expert
 explained.  "It was part of our pacification
 program.    But the Vietcong even welcomed
 the agents into their areas to help their
 farmers."
 FERTILIZER ON CREDIT
 In another instance, Vietnamese Govern-
 ment                                                                                                   administrators  have implemented a
 credit-loan system whereby farmers can buy
 fertilizer before the net planting and repay
 the loan after harvest.                    Production has more
 than doubled in some areas.  In other areas
 small irrigation pumps have been bought on
 loan, making possible two or three crops of
 rice a year instead of only one.
 The Vietcong retort that the fertilizer will
 destroy the soil; that in the first year of
 using fertilizer, production will increase but

 The result is not only a green light for
 Frei's Revolution With Liberty, which aims at
 transforming Chile's social structure, but also
 an unexpected revolution in its politics.  The
 era of compromise, mutual back scratching-
 or sheer deadlock-is over, at least for the
 time being.  Indeed, it is likely that disgust
 with political infighting played its part, as it
 does in Gaullist France, in this sudden emer-
 gence of a majority party.  Like De Gaulle,
 Frei, before the landslide, had asked for a
 constitutional amendment permitting him to
 go to the people should congress become too
 obstructionist.
 PEACEFUL REVOLUTION
 The program which is now the approved
 blueprint for Chile's future follows closely
 the outlines for peaceful revolution drawn up
 at the Punta del Este conference as the basis
 for the Alliance for Progress.  Emphasis is
 placed on achieving a social impact where it
 will be most immediately and dramatically
 evident in Chile: among the landless farm
 laborers and among the unorganized prole-
 tariat that swarms in city slums.
 Chilean  agriculture  has  been  for  some
 years a major reason for the imbalance of the
 economy.    Once a net exporter of, agricultural
 products, Chile now imports more than $140
 million worth, .two-thirds of which could be
 produced locally.  In. Chile's inflationary rat
 race, agricultural prices have lagged behind
 industrial ones because of Government at-
 tempts to control the cost of the urban "mar-
 ket basket"; worse still, these controls have
 been erratic, thus discouraging rational de-
 similar and successful Popular Cooperation
 has been accused of being primarily a de-
 vice for building grassroots support for his
 party.  In  any  case,  only  10  percent  of
 Chile's working class is organized, in unions
 largely Communist-controlled, at least at the
 top.    Organizing people "where they live as
 well as where they work" is thus an interest-
 ing new approach to the problem of giving
 civic representation to the submerged pro-
 letariat.
 A       third  area  where  Frei  has  already
 achieved dramatic social impact is education.
 It is a shocking fact that in this country of
 8~/2 million people of largely European ex-
 traction  there were approximately 200,000
 children with no school to go to.  In a crash
 program initiated immediately on taking of-
 fice in November, at the beginning of the
 Chilean summer, Frei organized an intensive
 course to train new teachers, asked existing
 ones voluntarily to accept longer hours, and
 undertook the construction of thousands of
 schoolrooms, as well as lodgings for teachers
 in remote areas.
 He mobilized the good will and enthusiasm
 of various groups:  villagers gave land and
 their labor and sometimes local materials;
 the  armed  forces  sent  their  troops  and
 equipment; 1,500 university students spent
 their  holidays  mixing   mortar and  laying
 bricks.   This year, for the first time,  no
 Chilean child will be denied the pleasures of
 the three R's.
 Agrarian reform, public housing, and edu-
 cation  cost  money,  and  Chile  is                                                                             already
 overextended in the matter of foreign credit;

 lumbia-and from the United Nations Eco-
 nomic   Commission   for   Latin   America
 (ECLA), whose headquarters are in Santiago.
 Chileans like to call them the Brain Trust.
 Service on the foreign debt, which would
 have absorbed more than half the export re-
 turns of the next few years, has been suc-
 cessfully renegotiated to provide a breathing
 spell.  The United States has extended loans
 of  various  types  for  $120  million.   And
 Chileans themselves have been asked to make
 a sacrifice: a capital levy on personal prop-
 erty of 1.5 to 3 percent annually for a period
 of 5 years.
 This proposal has naturally aroused the
 ire of the propertied classes-and not only
 because of the money involved.  Frei was
 careful to cite such precedents as"France's
 similar levy just after the war and to point
 to its present glowing prosperity as the result.
 What really upsets many Chileans is the
 declaration of their possessions which is im-
 plied in the levy.  Income tax evasion would
 thereby become much more difficult.   (At
 present, in spite of tax reform, the salaried
 class bears most of the burden; only 11,000
 people have declared a taxable income of over
 $5,000 a year.)
 NEW DEAL IN COPPER
 Redressing social injustice, however  ad-
 mirable,                                                                                                                              is nevertheless no sure  cure for
 inflation and economic stagnation. To get
 the country moving, Frei has tackled the
 problem at its very center-copper.   This
 metal dominates the Chilean economy;   it
 provides more than 50 percent of foreign
 exchange and $85 million annually in taxes.
 But five-sixths of the copper is extracted by
 two  American  companies,  Anaconda   and
 Kennecott.  Although these companies pay
 the highest wages in the country, and the
 highest mining taxes in the world, the pres-
 ence of two foreign colossi at the heart of the
 economy is a constant irritant to national
 pride, particularly since a good deal of the
 cop; er is refined abroad and its marketing
 is beyond the control of Chile.
 The Marxist left has been campaigning for
 some time in favor of outright expropria-
 tion.                                                                                                                              The American companies have hesi-

 200,000 tons a year-and that Chile will then
 be the biggest copper producer in the world.
 More of this copper will be refined in Chile,
 and Chile, with seats on the boards of di-
 rectors, will have some say on how the metal
 is to be marketed.
 Chile will: doulltXess contlnue , its flirta-
 tion with the Communist bloc-it has even
 shipped to Red China as a gesture of de-
 fiance.  At the same time, Frel has said,
 it will "respect with all due dignity and in-
 dependence the interests of our principal
 consumer"ancl biggest investor."
 Chile his not been able to lay much cash
 on, the.line?for. these tremendous acquisi-
 tlons.   Its - chief  contribution   will   be
 in housing for'miners, access roads and oth-
 br, construction, and the supply of power, all
 elements in its development plan anyway.
 The emphasis on mining may withdraw re-
 sources,. from other areas, but new foreign
 investment will amount to $400 million, some
 of which will, of course, be disbursed with-
 in Chile itself.  l owever, the program will
 not bear its full fruit until Fret's term is
 nearly over.  "I am governing for Chile,"
 he says, "which was not born nor does it
 die In one. presidential term.
 The long-term prospects for a significant
 increase in government revenues and foreign
 exchange are thus excellent.  The problem
 is to survive until this ship comes in, and
 meanwhile to encourage other exports: iron
 ore, of which Chile has rich deposits, cel-
 lulose  products from the Andean forests,
 and fish meal, where a budding enterprise
 hopes to  emulate the  Peruvian  bonanza.
 Further industrialization within so small a
 market is hardly viable except with the pros-
 pect of an effective Latin American Common
 Market.  Frei is pushing hard for a summit
 meeting to cut away the petty nationalist
 haggling which has hampered negotiations
 for years.
 Chileans, the most civic minded of all
 Latin  Americans,  are  conscious  of  these
 problems, conscious too that with the new
 political alinement within their country the
 price of failure in this experiment of revo-
 lution with liberty may be revolution with-

 EXCELLENT STATEMENT BY SENA-
 TOR CASE FAVORING ONE-MAN,
 from Neey [Mr. CASE] submitted
 a concise but remarkably complete state-
 ment before the Subcommittee on Con-
 stitutional Amendments of the Senate
 Committee on the Judiciary in opposi-
 tion  to  the  Dirksen  reapportionment
 amendment.
 I would like to draw the Senate's at-
 tention to two points made by Senator
 CASE which I believe are generally over-
 .,looke.4 , u, discuss ,ons of this rotten -bor-
 Qugh amendment,
 First, far too few of the people clam-
 oring,so loudly for the adoption of the
 Dirksen amendment realize the damage
 it col,ld do to the Negro's drive toward
 equal voting rights.  As Senator CASE
 Approved For Release 2003/10/15 CIA-,RDP67B00446R000300180029=9?
 could and some might apportion, themselves
 on the basis of such factors as income level,
 religious belief, or-most probable-color.  I
 am sure this is not the Intent of the dis-
 tinguished minority leader in proposing this
 amendment, but recent history suggests that
 it could very 11 well be the ' outcome.
 I hope that Senators who actively sup-
 ported the voting rights legislation re-
 cently passed by the Senate will take
 Senator CASE'S _comtxients to heart.
 Second, the passage of the "rotten
 borough" amendment would undoubted-
 ly mean a continuing and increasing re-
 liance on the Federal Government to do
 those jobs that can and should be done
 at the State level. Urban interests often
 are the first to suffer from malappor-
 tionment.  When they are blocked by a
 malapportioned State legislature from
 receiving funds for sanitation facilities,
 transportation lines, urban redevelop-
 ment, and countless other needs, they
 are forced to turn to the Federal Govern-
 ment. Senator CASE puts it this way:
 If we had set out to hobble the already
 stumbling institution of State government,
 we could not have found a better way.
 Mr. President, 'I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed at this point in the
 RECORD the statement by Senator CASE
 before the subcommittee on Constitu-
 tional Amendments of the Committee on
 the Judiciary.
 There being no objection, the state-
 ment was ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 STATEMENT OF SENATOR CLIFFORD P. CASE ON
 REAPPORTIONMENT  RESOLUTION  (S.J.  RES.
 2)  SUBMITTED  TO THE  SUBCOMMITTEE   ON
 CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS OF THE SEN-
 ATE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY
 I appreciate this opportunity to present
 my views on Senate Joint Resolution 2, the
 proposed constitutional amendment on ap-
 portionment of State legislatures.
 Despite the great attention given to dis-
 tracting tangential issues, the intent of the
 amendment is clear: it is designed to re-
 verse the. Supreme Courts historic one-man,
 one-vote decisions of 1964.   .
 I am opposed to this amendment.  Apart
 from its basic philosophy, it contains two
 specific and fatal flaws.
 The first might be called the deep freeze.
 In this connection, I call attention to the
 provision that "the right and power to de-
 termine the composition of the legislature of
 a State and apportionment of the member-
 ship thereof shall remain in the people of
 that State,"
 That sentence has  been  interpreted by
 eminent constitutional authorities to mean
 that the courts would be frozen completely
 out of the picture.  They could not review
 any apportionment.   They could not correct
 imbalances which exist or which could be
 expected to arise in the future.
 If a State legislature were to apportion one
 house on the  basis of race, for Instance,
 where could the deprived Negro citizens of
 that State turn for help?  Certainly not to
 the legislature responsible for the depriva-
 tion.                                                                          To the courts?  Not if this amend-
 ment is adopted.
 Proponents of the amendment reply, "But
 we have provided that the, people have the
 right and power to determine the reappor-
 tionment  plan.  Doesn't  this  protect  the
 public interest?"
 Unfortunately, it does not. The amend-
 ment's provision for a one-shot referendum
 on each State's. reapportionment plan would
 proved, even the voters themselves could not
 correct it,  The New York Times called this
 the most serious defect of the amendment,
 and continued:
 "It permits apportionment on a nonpopu-
 lation basis in perpetuity if such a course
 has  once    been  approved  by  referendum.
 But what     if the majority in  the future
 changes its mind on this issue?  Any amend-
 ment on                                                                                                                                             this  subject should require  the
 States to reapportion every 10 years and re-
 quire a referendum each time, to make cer-
 tain that a majority still favors apportion-
 ing one house on a basis other than popula-
 tion.  Otherwise, the outrageous malappor-
 tionments that the Supreme Court finally
 intervened to correct could grow up all over
 again."
 The amendment's  second  defect  is  the
 blank check given to the States to use any
 criteria in  determining their reapportion-
 ment.  The phrase, "upon the basis of fac-
 tors other than population," gives States a
 completely free hand.
 Recently I attended a dinner of legislative
 correspondents in New Jersey.  They pro-
 posed a plan, drawn up to fit within the pro-
 tection of thin amendment, which suggests
 the range which the amendment would al-
 low the New Jersey Legislature:
 "Under the plan, counties would be cred-
 ited with 200,000 residents for each board-
 walk, 250,000 for each ferry mooring, 1.3 for
 each chicken, and 5.34 for each hundred-
 weight of milk produced.  The plan gives
 Somerset an extra 150,000 residents for its
 population of foxhounds, as determined un-
 der the last census by local hunt clubs * * *
 The U.S. Supreme Court has said legislators
 represent people, not acres, trees, cows, or
 pastures.  The Court was eloquently silent
 on the specific questions of boardwalks, fer-
 ries, chicken, butter, and foxhounds."  ?
 The plan was proposed in jest, but it illus-
 trates an important point.  If the amend-
 ment were adopted, States could and some
 might apportion themselves on the, basis. of
 such factors as income level, religious belief,
 or-most probable-color.  I am sure this is
 not the intent of the distinguished minority
 leader in proposing this amendment, but re-
 cent history suggests that it could very well
 be the outcome.  The lengths to which some
 Southern States have gone to prevent the
 Negro from voting indicate that they would
 not be reluctant to use this amendment as
 an additional weapon.
 The proponents of Senate Joint Resolution
 2 claim it is needed in order to "protect
 minority rights."  The rights of minorities as
 well as majorities must be protected, but
 how this should be done is another question.
 The supporters of this amendment seem to
 think that the only way to provide adequate
 protection of the rights of any minority Is
 to give that particular minority a hammer-
 lock on the legislative process.   They  are
 usually thinking of citizens in rural or less
 populous areas.  But if the premise is true,
 is not every minority entitled to the same
 kind of consideration?  That is to say, why
 not give every minority a hammerlock on the
 legislative process?  Why should one minority
 be more equal than any or all other minori-
 ties?
 The fact is that the only reliable safe-
 guards for any minority are to be found in
 the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and,
 even more  basically,  in  the  self-restraint
 and respect for others on the part of the
 public in general.
 I find It surprising that many individuals
 and groups which traditionally have opposed
 extensions in the power of the Federal Gov-
 ernment are working for adoption of this
 amendment.  If we had set out to hobble the
 already stumbling institution of State gov-
 ernment, we could not have found a better
 way.  The, story of many of our State legis-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE             June 9, t965
 latures is one of stall and stalemate, Inde-
 cision and inaction in the face of urgent
 issues.
 If this amendment should pass, many of
 the States, already stymied in their efforts to
 find modern solutions to problems of growth
 and urbanization, will inevitably look in-
 creasingly to the Federal Government.
 My  colleague  from Wisconsin,  Senator
 PaoxMIRE, has stated the issue clearly:
 "This amendment is calculated to assure
 the country that State government-which
 has been too timid, too backward, too re-
 luctant, and as a result has seen its power
 and initiative go to Washington-will be
 slowed down to a molasses pace indefinitely.
 It would do so by striking down the greatest
 opportunity in many years which the States
 have had for swift progress."
 If this amendment, should pass, we will
 have set the wheels of progress turning back-
 ward for State governments.  In an age of in-
 creasing urbanization and urban problems,
 In a period when many citizens are lament-
 ing the growth of the Federal Government,
 we cannot afford to take such shortsighted
 action.
 CARDINAL MINDSZENTY: A HERO
 OF OUR TIME
 Mr. PROXMIIE.  Mr. President, on
 June 12 of this year Cardinal Mindszenty
 of Hungary celebrates the 50th anniver-
 sary of his ordination Into the priesthood
 of the Roman Catholic Church.  For a
 man of God, whatever religion he pro-
 fesses, an anniversary of this longevity
 deserves the honor and tribute of all men
 of good will.
 Cardinal Mindszenty is by every mean-
 ing of the term a hero of our time.  In
 this era of oversophistication in which we
 live, the noble virtues of heroism are
 often regarded with detached indiffer-
 ence and cynical disregard of their real
 worth.  It is well, therefore, Mr. Presi-
 dent, that on this occasion we should
 call the attention of our American people
 to those values of heroism that have ele-
 vated Cardinal Mindszenty in the esteem
 of all free men; for It is in the life and
 works of such a man that our youth and
 even those not so young canfind the ex-
 ample of a great and noble life well lived.
 What are the attributes of Cardinal
 Mindszenty for which he deserves to be
 called a hero of our time?
 Mr. President, first of all, I would
 single out the cardinal's unfailing fidelity
 to his God and to his church.  This great
 Hungarian, this extraordinary man of
 God, absolutely refused to deny his in-
 terior religious commitments.                  And this
 lie did under the most soul-shattering
 conditions of Communist - imprisonment
 which are familiar to us all.  Cardinal
 Mindszenty could not be broken. He was
 a rock that could not be shattered.
 Where other men may have surrendered
 to the temptations wrought by a sense of
 tragic futility, this great European held
 firm.
 Mr. President, in this volatile era of
 shifting loyalties and of altering prin-
 ciples, in this time where practicality,
 expediency, and the pernicious adapta-
 bility of one's deepest values is a guiding
 norm for far too many people, it is a
 glorious experience to behold a man, who
 surrounded by his enemies would say, I
 will not submit, I will not break.
 Such a man, M. President, is, indeed,
 a hero.
 Such a man, Mr. President, Is Cardinal
 Mindszenty.
 There is still another quality that I
 would point to as indicating the virtue
 that is this man, and it is the cardinal's
 unfailing fidelity to his country and to
 the cause of freedom.
 In every way Cardinal Mindszenty was
 a Hungarian patriot.  Yes, Mr. Presi-
 dent, he was a fighter against all oppres-
 sion of his country, a fighter against the
 oppression of the spirit of man.  He was
 a freedom fighter who has never lost
 faith in his country, in his people, and in
 man's inner desire to seek the good life
 in freedom.
 What assures Cardinal Mindszenty a
 place in the hall of fame of all freemen,
 Mr. President, is not so much his fidelity
 to his God and church and his fidelity
 to his country and people-it is not so
 much this reality which is a quality com-
 monly held by many men, as it is the fact
 that this man's values, his honor, his
 spirit, his whole being as a man had been
 tested by the enemy, and he did not
 falter.  He did not take the easy way
 out.  He held firmly to his most sacred
 values, values embodied in his love of
 God and country.
 Mr. President, we do honor to our-
 selves when we pay tribute to this great
 Hungarian; for in honoring him we re-
 assert those values that we Americans
 have always cherished as part of our own
 tradition.
 And, Mr. President, when we honor
 this Hungarian patriot, we honor, too, the
 great and fearless people of Hungary;
 for to them Cardinal Mindszenty has
 come to symoblize the Hungarian spirit
 of freedom.
 On this 50th anniversary of Cardinal
 Mindszenty's ordination to the priest-
 hood, let us, therefore, extend our best
 wishes to this truly great and holy man,
 for his life has been and shall always be
 an inspiration to all men who seek free-
 dom for the spirit of all men.
 IMPROVEMENT OF OPERATION AND
 ADMINISTRATION OF ANTIDUMP-
 ING ACT OF 1921
 Mr. HARTKE.  Mr. President, on May
 26, I Introduced S. 2045, on behalf of my-
 self, the distinguished Senator from
 Pennsylvania [Mr. SCOTT], and 21 other
 Senators, a bill aimed at improving the
 operation and administration of the
 Antidumping Act of 1921.  An editorial
 in the Washington Post of June 1 dis-
 plays  an  apparent  misunderstanding
 about the intent and significance of this
 legislation.
 The bill now has 29 Senate cospon-
 sors, as well as 93 in the House of Rep-
 resentatives making a total of 122, and
 I am confident that they are just as dis-
 turbed as I am to be characterized, as
 the title of the editorial states, as "pro-
 tectionists at work." I should like to add
 that the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr.
 SCOTT] joins me in placing this state-
 ment before the Senate.
 The editorial is devoted to criticism of
 both the Orderly Marketing Act of
 1965 and the newly revised Antidump-
 ing Act amendment. Without attempt-
 ing at this time to go into the merits
 of the editorial's remarks about the
 former, of which Senator MUgxIE is the;
 principal sponsor and I ~am a cosponsor,
 I would like--on behalf of myself, Sen-
 ator SCOTT, and other cosponsors of the
 antidumping legislation, including the
 initial sponsor of the bill in the House
 of Representatives, A. SYDNEY HERLONG,
 JR.-to object to recurring Post edito-
 rial attempts to cloud the issues sur-
 rounding the unfair trade practice of
 dumping by raising the old and conven-
 ient cry of "protectionist" whenever a
 piece of legislation is introduced which
 would attempt to curb international
 price discrimination.
 Anyone who takes the time to examine
 the  1921  Antidumping  Act,  and  the
 amendment which I and a number of my
 colleagues are proposing, will readily dis-
 cern that imports would not be denied
 entry or prevented from being sold in our
 markets; they merely would be placed
 on a fair, competitive price basis if their
 importation at a dumping price injures
 American producers.  The amendment
 certainly is not protectionist in going
 along with the Treasury practice of al-
 lowing foreign producers to lower their
 home market prices in order to elimi-
 nate the margin of dumping on sales to
 the United States, and thereby terminate
 dumping cases at the Treasury level
 through an appropriate price adjust-
 ment.  Where no such adjustment is
 made, and then only if the Tariff Com-
 mission finds the dumped imports to be
 injurious, a special dumping duty is cal-
 culated by Treasury to bring the price
 back up to the price level at which the
 product was sold in the country of ex-
 port.
 This is a far cry from the editorial's
 charge that proponents of this legisla-
 tion "cling stubbornly to the belief that
 this country can continue to be the
 world's largest exporter while closing its
 gates to the products of other coun-
 tries." Responsible journalism, it would
 seem, might not have resorted so read-
 ily to the old cliches, nor to misleading
 assumptions. I shall briefly explain what
 I have in mind.
 Editorials in the Post along similar
 lines followed the introduction in 1963 of
 a predecessor bill proposed as an amend-
 ment to the U.S. Antidumping Act and
 prompted then Senator, now Vice Presi-
 dent, HUBERT HUMPHREY, its principal
 sponsor, to speak up as I am doing to-
 day to set the record straight. I might
 add that I was a cosponsor of the 1963
 bill, and I feel that his remarks, which
 appeared in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD
 of May 27, 1963, are as pertinent today
 as they were 2 years ago.
 I am, however, disturbed by the apparent
 lack  of understanding displayed in these
 editorials toward the objectives of the Anti-
 dumping Act Itself.  In the editorial of May
 13, the Post asserts that "any attempt to
 eliminate   international   competition   by
 means of the inflexible Antidumping Act pro-
 cedures will invite retaliations that can only
 work to the disadvantage of the free world."
 The April 23 editorial refers to the operation
 of the Antidumping Act as an example of
 the "discredited, protectionist policies which
 have  inhibited international trade in the
 past."
 Certainly my vigorous advocacy of expan-
 sionist trade policies is a matter of public

 C046AESSIONAL RECORD   StNA`I'                        519
 From the San Francisco (Calif.) 'Examiner,
 May 27, 1965 ]
 HIGHHANDED
 An amazing coobination of 'bureaucratic
 arrogance and highhanded procedure has
 developed in the wake of the U.S. appellate
 court ruling  that  certain  Atomic  Energy
 Collimission  powers  are  'subject  to  the
 priority of local'ordinances. '
 This was .the decision that would prevent
 Construction of AEC overhead powerlines
 contrary to the objections of the city of
 Woodside and San Mateo County_
 A joint Senate-1iouse subcommittee hear=
 ing today is the instrument of AEC retalia-
 tion.  The measure before the subcommit-
 tee would give the AEC powers superior to
 those of the States and local communities
 in such matters. Only the alertness-of Con-
 gressman J. ARTHUR YOUNGER kept the hear-
 ing from being closed to opponents. No time
 for preparation of objections was allowed.
 The  overriding  AEC  powers  proposed
 would,extend far beyond Woodside's esthetic
 oncerno,  President Johnson's call for a
 oncerted  national  campaign  to protect
 scenic. values would be ignored, with the
 executive right hand seemingly not know-
 ing what the left hand is doing.
 These are' the _ rawest sort of railroad-
 ing tactics, contemptuous of orderly pro-
 cedures.  Amendment of the Atomic Energy
 Act for the purpose of elevating the AEC
 to virtually dictatorial position is full of dan-
 ger.  If undertaken at all, it should be in
 the full 'light of day, not as a deliberate
 short circuiting of a court decision that
 properly upheld the sovereignty of laws at
 the community level.

 l
 POWER FLAY;  WOODSIDE VERSUS THE AEC
 Woodside, Calif,, has a very small popula-
 tion but a. very large sense of principle.
 Residents of Woodside, for instance, be-
 lieve that even the Atomic Energy Commis-
 sion should obey the Federal statutes re-
 quiring' compliance with local ordinances.
 Specifically, they insist that the Commission
 should not violate; Woodside city laws by 11i-
 stalling overhead powerlines to the AEC's
 linear accelerator project at Stanford Uni-
 versity.
 The second highest Federal court in the
 land agreed with Woodside. In a unanimous
 decision, the U.S. circuit court of appeals
 ruled that under the Atomic Energy Act of
 1954 the Commission does not have the power
 to override local ordinances "with respect
 to the generation, sale or transmission of
 power."
 AEC officials had protested that under-
 ground  installation of  the  powerlines  as
 required. by Woodside (and other surround-
 ing communities)  would substantially in-
 ently fallen on deaf ears-or on ears more
 sensitive to demands for an unnecessary ex-
 pansion of AEC power.
 Woodside may lose its fight, if the AEC
 bills can be pushed through Congress.  But
 a lot of other cities, big and small, also will
 have lost.
 [From the Palo Alto (Calif.) Times, May 21,
 1965]
 SAY "UNCLE" TO WOODSIDE, UNCLE
 Cheers  for  the  U.S.  district court  of
 appeals decision  that  the  U.S.   Atomic
 Energy Commission cannot ram its overhead
 powerlines down   the throat  of unwilling
 Woodside.
 This victory of a rustic little community
 over  the  awesome  Federal  Government
 should hearten all those who believe right,
 not might, must prevail in our Republic.
 But more than a David beating a Goliath
 is involved.  The narrow issues of the case
 seem to rest on the facts that Woodside had
 an  ordinance  requiring  powerlines  to  be
 placed underground, and that the AEC's
 chartering legislation forbids it to transmit
 electricity in violation of Federal, State, or
 local regulations.
 More broadly, though, the issue is whether
 Woodside as, a municipal corporation has the
 right to protect its scenery, and whether
 Uncle Sam, if he would come through Wood-
 side with histapline to supply power to the
 Stanford Linear  Accelerator  Center, must
 respect that right.
 A view has measurable value in Woodside-
 ask any real estate salesman.  It is up to
 the AEC like any good neighbor to obey local
 regulations and not to mar the landscape.
 As we asserted more than a year ago, the
 contention that the AEC cannot afford to
 pay more to bury the lies is abusive nonsense.
 So is the idea that action must be stampeded
 because the $114 million research tool is
 almost ready to operate.  Delay would be no
 issue if the AEC had agreed to underground-
 ing 14 months ago.
 In short, there is no basic problem here
 that money  cannot solve.  May  the U.S.
 Supreme Court keep these points in mind if
 the AEC appeals-and may "remember Wood-
 side" become a watchword reminding Wash-
 ington to remain respectful of local interests.

 not unnaturally, a great deal more con-

 The President cannot be expected per-

 between beauty and the builders.  But he
 can  devise an appeals procedure so that
 single-minded Federal agencies and congres-
 sional committees would no longer sit as the
 final  judges  of  their  own  construction
 projects.
 the New York (N.Y.) Times,
 June 8, 1965]
 HIGH POWER
 Apparently word of President Johnson's
 concern for conserving the  natural land-
 scape has not reached the Atomic Energy
 Commission.
 The AEC is determined to win its fight to
 string high-power transmission lines any-
 where it pleases. For more than a year, the
 Commission has been engaged in a struggle
 over this issue with the residents of Wood-
 side, Calif., a town 30 miles south of San
 Francisco.  The agency wants to take pos-
 session of a strip of land 100 feet wide and
 5.3 miles long, running through picturesque
 hills and heavy woods, and erect an over-
 head line on poles and towers ranging from
 70 to 120 feet high.  The line would carry
 electricity to a linear accelerator being built
 at Stanford University.
 The residents of Woodside, pointing out
 that county zoning forbids overhead power-
 lines, urged the AEC to place the lines un-
 derground, rather than scar the countryside.
 Instead, the AEC went to court-and lost.
 On May 20, the Federal Court of Appeals
 upheld Woodside, basing its decision on a
 section of the 1954 Atomic Energy Act.  Un-
 daunted, the AEC turned to its friends in
 Congress.  On May 25-the same day that
 the  White House  Conference  on   Natural
 Beauty   opened-Senators   PASTORE     and
 HICKENLOOPER and Representative HOLIFIELD,
 the ranking members of the Joint Commit-
 tee on Atomic Energy, introduced a bill to
 exempt the AEC from such local and State
 zoning regulations.  Hearings  were sched-
 uled immediately with no advance notice.
 Estimates of the cost of putting the lines
 underground range from $2 to $4 million, but
 .either figure is small compared to the total
 cost  of  the  linear accelerator.   Moreover,
 Woodside, a wealthy town, has offered to
 quadruple  its taxes for  the next year to
 help pay part of the added costs for the un-
 derground line.
 These local considerations, however, are
 less important than the principles involved.
 Even in the absence of a Presidential push
 for  protecting  the  natural  environment,
 Federal agencies should respect local conser-
 vation  requirements.  No   committee                                                                                                                                             of
 Congress should attempt to rush through a
 law with the imperiousness the Joint Com-
 mittee on Atomic Energy is showing.                                                                                                                                              The
 public looks to Congress to curb rather than
 to  abet high-powered bureaucratic    arro-
 gance.
 The threats to the American landscape
 include, unfortunately, the Federal Govern-
 ment Itself.  While President  Johnson is
 very emphatically a defender of the conti-
 nent's natural beauty, the Government over
 which he presides is notoriously a house of
 many   mansions.  Its   great regulatory
 powers, and its   massive construction

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE             June 9, 1965
 The community has battled this project
 for years.  It incorporated in 1956 to preserve
 its hill and forest beauties; passed zoning
 laws to prohibit overhead powerlines of the
 size proposed; voted to quadruple its tax
 rate for a specified period to raise $150,000 to-
 ward putting the lines underground-and it
 won an important court decision._ On May
 20, the U.S. circuit court of appeals ruled
 that the AEC cannot build its line overhead
 in disregard of local ordinances.
 The AEC promptly ran to Congress, asking
 last week for legislation stating flatly that
 such a matter is not subject to local regula-
 tion.  It got an immediate bill introduced
 and a rush hearing before the legislative sub-
 committee of the Joint Congressional Com-
 mittee on Atomic Energy.  The subcommit-
 tee heard opening statements last Thursday.
 Talk about nuclear power.
 Central arguments of the AEC relate to
 expense.  It would cost $668,000 to string the
 powerlines overhead, it said-$2,640,000 to
 bury them.  It emphasized that if the lines
 are not installed soon the staff at the ac-
 celerator will be standing around and doing
 little but collecting salaries and running up
 total costs of $1,500,000 a month.
 We submit that while all of this is deplor-
 able, it is not the fault of a tiny but doughty
 community fighting to preserve itself and
 the very natural beauties so loudly heralded
 as desirable by the President of the United
 States.  The fault might rather lie with a
 Federal agency's hard-nosed attempt to have
 its way if it has to run roughshod over the
 courts and have its own laws tailormade.
 The wishes and ordinance of local com-
 munities in which the AEC operates certainly
 deserve a lot more consideration than Wood-
 side is getting.
 Hearings resumed this week in this attempt
 to aim a Federal law directly at a community
 and its ordinances.
 On the basis of information to date, the
 legislation should be scrapped.
 Mr. KUCHEL.  Mr. President, a few
 years ago, the late Senator Richard Neu-
 berger, of Oregon, and I jointly sponsored
 an amendment to the interstate highway
 legislation, providing an incentive to the
 States to regulate outdoor advertising on
 portions of the new Interstate Highway
 System which the Federal Government
 was underwriting at a cost of 90 percent.
 In a debate in the Senate, against vigor-
 ous bipartisan opposition, the views of
 the late Senator Neuberger and myself,
 prevailed on a rollcall vote. It will be a
 sad day for anybody who enjoys what the
 great God above us gave us all across the
 country if the Senate were to approve
 this backward legislation, which, as I say,
 may be before us in the next few days or
 weeks.
 I hope Senators may take occasion to
 read the newspaper comments that I
 have placed in the RECORD and will study
 the situation, for I earnestly hope the
 Se  to may in its wisdom repudiate this
 ante pt by a great Government agency
 to orride local concern and our judicial
 syst4m.  I hope the Senate will reject the
 pro osed legislation.

 ~ ESCALATION OF THE `TJFTNAM
 STRUGGLE
 Mr. JAVITS.  Mr. President, the State
 Department announced yesterday that
 (en. William C. Westmoreland, who
 heads the U.S. military assistance com-
 mand in South Vietnam, has been given
 authority to commit U.S. troops to com-
 bat in South Vietnam on request by
 South Vietnamese  commanders,  pro-
 vided only that U.S. troops are not to
 engage in combat strictly on their own,
 but are to fight alongside South Viet-
 namese forces.
 To the American people this an-
 nouncement  is  very  reminiscent  of
 Korea.
 It is another escalation of U.S. par-
 ticipation in the struggle, yet it comes as
 no.surprise. Not only has this decision
 been rumored for several days, but it
 has been apparent for weeks now that
 the United States was moving slowly to-
 ward a greatly increased ground combat
 role for U.S. forces in South Vietnam.
 This movement has not been impercep-
 tible, but it has been gradual and un-
 dramatic enough to forestall any signifi-
 cant public reaction.  Yet the stark facts
 are that there are more than 50,000 N.S.
 troops now in South Vietnam as against
 about 14,000 when President Johnson
 took office only 18 months ago. We now
 hear rumors that 100,000 or more troops
 will be in South Vietnam soon.  Under
 present orders, our troops will still be
 on extended action within a country
 which wants us within its borders-
 South Vietnam.  But will U.S. troops
 tomorrow be called on to follow on the
 ground the air bombardment of North
 Vietnam?
 We have been moving in the direction
 of a massive, bogdown land struggle in
 Asia without any specific consent by
 Congress or the people for that kind of
 war.  Although the President has the
 power, for all practical purposes, to com-
 mit the United States to such a struggle,
 I have said on many occasions over the
 last 2 months that it would be disastrous
 for this country if the President were to
 use that power without firstasking Con-
 gress for a resolution-similar to the
 joint resolution of August 10, 1964-to
 authorize specifically an expansion of the
 U.S. military role in the Vietnamese
 struggle onto such a new and qualita-
 tively different level.  Without a man-
 date from the Congress and the people,
 a U.S. land struggle in Asia could en-
 gender criticism and division in the coun-
 try that will make recent protests over
 our Vietnam policy look like a high
 school picnic.
 News reports describe this new combat
 role for U.S. troops in Vietnam as a
 future one. It is still not too late. Once
 again, I request the President not to per-
 mit this new level of U.S. participation
 in the ground struggle to occur without
 obtaining the kind of mandate from Con-
 gress and from the people which, alone,
 can make such a policy feasible without
 grave divisions in the country.  Once

 doubtedly support the President.                                                            But
 just as he could not forgo the salutary
 announcement    of  U.S.  willingness to
 negotiate-although he felt he had said
 it many times before-so lie cannot fore-
 go the salutary effect of a congressional
 debate and action on this new and crucial
 U.S. policy in Vietnam.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that an editorial entitled "Congress
 and Vietnam," which appeared in the
 New York Times of June 7, 1965, to-
 gether with an article by John W. Finney
 entitled "Johnson Permits U.S. Units To
 Fight If Saigon Asks Aid."  And an
 editorial entitled "Ground War In Asia,"
 both published in the New York Times
 today, be printed at this point in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 and editorials ordered to be printed in
 the RECORD, as follows:
 [From New York (N.Y.) Times, June 7, 19651
 CONGRESS AND VIETNAM
 Signs are growing of congressional interest
 in ending the "leave it to Lyndon" era in
 American foreign policy.
 There is Senator Fubright's new proposal
 to give the OAS a major voice in channeling
 American military assistance to Latin Amer-
 ica.  There is the provision in the new for-
 eign aid bill for a thorough-going congres-
 sional investigation and for terminating the
 aid program in its present form in 1957.
 There is the trip to Europe, at their own
 expense, of four House Republicans to inves-
 tigate the crisis in NATO.  And there are
 the recent critcisms of administration policy
 in Vietnam and the Dominican Republic by
 Senator Robert F. Kennedy, plus his current
 charge that the United States is neither
 meeting its aid responsibilities to the under-
 developed  countries  nor  identifying itself
 with the world revolution under way in those
 areas.
 Factors that go  beyond the President's
 limited experience in foreign affairs and the
 extraordinary    vacillations  in  Dominican
 policy have set off the present questioning
 at  home and     abroad.  The  reluctance of
 Secretary of State Rusk to employ the full
 resources of his department and give inde-
 pendent advice, the meager use made by the
 President of non-official task forces in the
 foreign policy field, the overdependence on
 military and intelligence agencies and the
 divorce between the Administration and the
 Nation's intellectuals--all point to a need for
 more vigorous congressional interest.
 Nowhere is this more vital than on Viet-
 nam, where grave constitutional questions
 are raised by the official acknowledgment of
 an  increasing  combat  role  for  American
 troops.  During the 18 months of the John-
 son administration, the number of American
 troops in Vietnam has been tripled to about
 46,500;  a Purther  build-up to more than
 60;000 appears imminent.  American planes
 have entered into combat both in South and
 North Vietnam-in the latter case openly
 attacking a foreign country with no declara-
 tion of war.  American warships have bom-
 barded the North Vietnamese coast.  And
 there are indications that American ground
 troops-first employed as advisers in South
 Vietnam, then deployed to defend American
 installations and now directly engaged in
 patrolling action-will soon take on a full
 combat role as a tactical reserve aiding South
 Vietnamese units in trouble.
 Yet, at no point has there been significant
 congressional discussion, much less direct
 authorization of what amounts to a decision
 to wage war.  That is why 28 Democratic
 Congressmen, on the initiative of Represen-
 tative ROSENTHAL of Queens, now have wisely
 asked the chairman of the House Foreign.
 Affairs Committee to hold public hearings
 on the administration's Vietnam policy.
 American  casualties  in  Vietnam,  while
 still relatively minor, already exceed those
 of the Spanish-American War.  The choices
 open to the President are exceedingly difficult
 ones; they should not be his alone, either as
 a matter of sound policy or of constitutional
 obligation.  If he takes it upon himself to
 make an American war out of the Vietnamese
 tragedy-without seeking congressional and,
 national consent-he may open the country
 to divisions even more dangerous than those
 that developed out of the Korean conflict.

 colleagues feel, that they have got them-
 selves into this mess and would therefore
 like to have further reassurance by an
 additional testing of the sentiment of
 Congress.
 I have no doubt that the Senator from
 New York is receiving a great deal of
 mail critical of his support of the posi-
 tion which the administration is taking
 and that, therefore, he would like a fur-
 ther reassurance from Congress.  I can
 understand his desire for such comfort.
 However, I repeat my view, that when
 the President sent down his resolution
 last August it gave him the power to use
 American troops wherever he saw fit, and
 that gave him ample authority to do
 what he is now doing.  The resolution
 was approved by Congress, and the Sena-
 tor from New York voted for it.  I voted
 against it, for reasons that I have amply
 set forth on the floor of the Senate. I
 can-understand, however, why those who
 voted against it want to bring up the
 matter again.
 Mr. McGEE.  Mr. President, on my
 own time, I ask unanimous consent for
 time to mention two factors in this sit-
 uation, which has been brought tip by
 my friend, the Senator from Alaska. The
 two. comments he made-In regard to
 which I believe that I should share an
 observation-dealt with the suggestion
 of the Senator from Alaska that, after
 all, those of us who have supported ad-
 ministration policy In Vietnam have now
 discovered what a mess we have got our-
 selves "into, and that we do not know
 why` we are in this kind of dilemma at
 the present time.
 I believe It should be stated for the
 RECORD that no one person got us Into
 this mess.' If we had not moved, the kind
 of mess we would have would be the very
 same kind of mess that the Senator from
 Alaska and other great Americans like
 him would have been protesting with
 even greater vigor.
 This kind of mess stems from the kind
 of war which our opponents on the other
 side of the line in southeast Asia have
 invented as a means of continuing the
 terrible, steady, pressure for penetration
 and erosion of those nations which would
 like to stay outside the orbit of influence
 of mainland China.
 How else are we going to combat guer-
 rilla warfare? How else are we going to
 combat terrorism, if we do not take a
 stand now?
 Therefore, I challenge the use of the
 phrase that we are in some kind of mess
 that somehow we got ourselves Into.
 We did not wish to become Involved,
 in the first place. History thrust It upon
 us. We accepted it as one of the com-
 mandments that went with victory in
 World War II, that we could take the
 lead in helping to rebuild the world, that
 we could help to reconstruct it ourselves
 with thekind of profile that we believed
 offered a better opportunity for peace in
 the future.
 It is this principle, it seems to me,
 which Is really behind the'so-called mess
 in South Vietnam which my friend the
 Senator from Alaska says we are
 namely, a war which we cannot win.
 Mr. President, we do not win wars any
 More. We are all sophisticated enough
 to know that in the nuclear age we do
 not accumulate points as in a basketball
 game. What we are trying to do, if not
 to win a war, Is to win the opportunity to
 make a lasting peace.  That is what we
 have in mind even when we cannot win
 a war.
 We can lose the world.  We can lose
 Vietnam.  We can lose the opportunity
 for which World War II was waged, to
 try to reconstitute a balanced world, with
 a more peaceful image than heretofore
 has been the case.
 That is really the context in which
 we should view the way in which the con-
 flict is going, to and fro, in Vietnam.
 I beseech my colleague not to use sim-
 ple cliches about "the mess we are al-
 ready in," and that "we cannot win the
 war in Vietnam."  It seems to me to be
 an oversimplification of the complex-
 ities of a problem which the President
 and the Nation have to face in deciding
 the policy that must govern the United
 States in any part of the world.
 Mr. GRUENING.  Mr. President, will
 the Senator from Wyoming yield?
 Mr. McGEE.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that my time may be
 extended for 3 minutes, in order that I
 may yield to the Senator from Alaska.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Without
 objection, it Is so ordered.
 Mr. GRUENING.  I congratulate my
 distinguished colleague from Wyoming
 for creating a new villain in the world.
 Coming from him, as a professor of his-
 tory, it has considerable significance.
 He has made the statement that history
 thrust us into this situation.  This is the
 first time I ever knew that history had
 that kind of motive power.. But as my
 colleague has been a teacher of history,
 a university professor in this field, he
 may be presumed to speak with sub-
 stantial authority on the role of history.
 He has declared that history thrust us
 into the war in southeast Asia.  But I do
 not think the responsibility for our being
 there can thus be assigned.      Human
 beings in high places got us into that war.
 Mr. McGEE.  History probably has
 thrust more than one man into the front
 ranks of decisionmaking in the world.
 History creates events that even-Repub-
 licans and Democrats, or the Senator
 from Alaska, sometimes cannot control.
 ESSAYS BY WYOMING STUDENTS
 Mr. McGEE.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that I may return to
 morning business and take my 3 minutes
 in order to bring a matter to the atten-
 tion of the Congress.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. McGEE. Mr. President, In Wash-
 ington with me this week are two out-
 standing young students from Wyoming.
 Each year I conduct a competition in _
 the State of Wyoming for every graduat-
 ing high school senior.  They submit
 studied essays on one proposition: How
 to make democracy work better.
 The winners of that statewide con-
 test were one young man and one young
 woman who have now come to Washing-
 ton and are spending the week in my
 office and around the Capitol studying
 democracy in the living laboratory of our
 day-to-day procedure.
 These two outstanding students are
 Miss Joan Magagna, of Rock Springs
 High School, Rock Springs, Wyo., and
 Craig Fansler, of Fremont County Voca-
 tional High School at Lander, Wyo.
 Their  accomplishments  are  many.
 They, are both outstanding students,
 keenly Interested in the policies of the
 world.  One of them is an outstanding
 Democrat and the other comes from an
 outstanding Republican family. This
 contest has nothing to do with partisan-
 ship. It has everything to do with pub-
 lic responsibility to try to raise the
 political conduct of our country to ever
 higher levels.
 The essays which they have submitted
 In this contest are of such- quality that I
 should like to share them with all Sena-
 tors.  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent to have. them printed
 in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the essays
 were ordered to be printed In the RECORD,
 as follows:
 MAKING DEMOCRACY WORK
 (By Joan Magagna, Rock Springs, Wyo.)
 Nineteen  hundred  and  sixty-five  is  a
 troubled,                            anxious  time.   Every citizen of
 1965's world pursues his daily tasks ever
 aware of the threatening "facts of life" of
 this, our 20th century. Frightening shadows
 of aggressive communism, racial crises, and
 nuclear weapons menace every waking mo-
 ment.  Each of these heavy problems rests
 especially  heavily  upon  our  shoulders  as
 Americans.  We have taken up a mammoth
 task in this year of strife.    We Americans
 since the birth of our Nation have acclaimed
 to the world that our country is that promised
 land of milk and honey anr' freedom and Jus-
 tice for all.                                                                                                                                       The duty falls to us to make
 America's promises of life and hope more than
 just empty words to the downtrodden peoples
 of earth.  For the freedom-loving and free-
 dom-seeking peoples of the world, for our
 selves, and for generations to come after 1985,
 we must find a way to make democracy work.
 The American democracy was best defined
 by Abraham Lincoln in his Gettysburg Ad-
 dress as "a government of the people, by the
 people, and for the people."  His pointed ref-
 erence to "the people" indicates the promi-
 nent role every citizen plays on the stage of
 democracy.  Since our large population and
 enormous landmass prohibits pure or abso-
 lute democracy, the U.S. Government is a
 function of representative democracy.  But
 Lincoln's words "of the people" imply that
 the masses must still be the government.
 Making our democracy work necessitates every
 individual's making his own influence felt
 through his representatives.  If one citizen's
 voice Is hushed or falls to be heard, then
 democracy fails to work.  If a government
 voices the opinions of only some of the people,
 it cannot be a genuine democracy.
 By constitutional provision, the opinions
 of the people of our Nation are expressed
 through the polls.  It is tragic to realize
 that nearly 40 percent of our voting popula-
 tion did not vote in the last general election,
 when peoples in other parts of the world
 are still fighting to obtain such rights.  In
 one Latin American country a few years ago.
 the population was warned under pain of
 death to stay away from the polls on elec-
 tion day.  Ninety-nine percent of the popu-
 lation cast their votes that day.  In America,
 where we have no fears of punishment, only
 60 percent of the population turn out at the
 polls.
 Obviously, we Americans cannot be gen-
 uinely aware that the right to vote is the
 lifeblood of democracy.  However, the trite

 June 9, 1965             CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 record.  I was a.strong and outspoken sup-
 porter of President Kennedy's Trade Expan-
 sion Act of 1962 and I view a mutual reduc-
 tion of tariffs among the Western nations as
 absolutely essential to the long-run economic
 prosperity and political solidarity of the free
 world.  But I also believe it, is essential that
 every nation be willing to abide by basic
 ground rules of international trade.  One of
 these rules is not to sell large quantities of
 surplus merchandise in a country at prices
 below those charged in home markets if
 such sales will injure domestic producers.
 Senator Hurv1PHREY summarized his
 views in words that I feel are equally a_
 ,propriate with respect to the June 1, 1965,
 editorial:
 it appears to me that the editorials were
 primarily theoretical rather than being based
 upon an actual observation of the laws and
 the facts that relate to these laws * * *. In
 short, whether by official statute or decree or
 by unofficial agreement, other nations of the
 free world sanction procedures to protect
 their domestic industries and markets from
 dumping,of surplus products.  To the extent
 that the Post editorials conveyed the impres-
 'ion that the U.S, Antidumping Act repre-
 sented a unique. trade practice unknown to
 our Western partners, they were grossly mis-
 leading.  In fact, dumping is an interna-
 tionally recognized unfair trade practice and
 action taken against dumping should be and
 is taken without-regard to attempts to en-
 courage and expand fair international trade._
 Furthermore,  the June 1 editorial'
 misses the point that it is the apparent,
 lack of consensus among the Commis-
 sioners since. mid-1963 as to what con-
 stitutes injury, which underscores the
 fallacy of referring to the Commission's
 collective "judgment, when in fact, dif-
 fering judgments exist among the Com-
 missioners as, to some of the basic con-
 cepts to be applied.  In the absence of
 standards established by the Congress,
 there will continue to be confusion and
 uncertainty in both the domestic and
 importing communities as to the inter-
 pretation of basic concepts in the act.
 Once the applicable standards are
 made known, there 's a reasonable ex-
 pectation that cases will not be brought
 by domestic industry in which no injury
 is likely to be found, but which previously
 might have been worth a try.  Also,
 where injury is likely to be found because
 of the clearer standards, there will be
 less reluctance to bring a ,valid case.
 Both of these situations would result in
 a higher percentage of findings of injury,
 and for solid reasons. I believe it there-
 fore inappropriate that the Post editorial
 The Hartke-Scott bill would foist,.upon the
 CommissiQn rules that ,would make findings
 of injury far more likely.
 Next, I should like to say a word about
 the continuing reference in Post edi-
 torials to retaliation against U.S. ex-
 ports. In. the -June 1 editorial a series of
 retaliations from. European countries is
 prophesied.  I will not deny that some
 European countries have the capability
 of reassessing their own antidumping
 laws, but I do object to the use of the
 retaliation argument, just as then-Sena-
 tor HUMPHREY  did in his response to
 earlier Post editorials, as an attempt
 to sti~$ema ,y discussion pf neededd.changes
 in our foreign trade laws.             1k
 It Is clear that the most effective way
 to influence antidumping developments
 in the countries of our trading partners
 would be to provide a model in the U.S.
 experience. In a sense this has been ac-
 complished inasmuch as the U.S. law
 and the GATT provision on dumping are
 very similar. However,' it is equally evi-
 dent that our U.S, Antidumping Act re-
 quires improvement. A model law must
 be clear in its terms, and it must be
 effective and efficient in its application.
 Once such a law is in,.being, we can
 hold it out to our trading partners as
 a measure by which their laws can be
 tested, and we can be more certain that
 our export trade will not be unfairly
 treated.
 We need not be ashamed of the U.S.
 Antidumping Act of 1921, as amended,
 with its two stage investigation, which
 does not make dumping alone actionable,
 but only when injury is also shown. U.S.
 exports which may be dumped but do not
 cause injury abroad are not likely to be
 complained of by foreign governments.
 Furthermore, since the U.S. antidumping
 -law, and the proposed amendment as
 well, would apply to products of all coun-
 tries equally (with certain special pro-
 visions for dealing effectively with Com-
 munist products), it does not discrim-
 inate against European countries, and
 retalitatory measures aimed at only U.S.
 exports would be in violation of the Gen-
 eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade-
 GATT-which provides the framework
 for the Kennedy round of tariff-cutting
 negotiations now in progress, and from
 which the European countries, as well as
 all others, hope to benefit.  Thus, it
 should be kept in perspective that the
 foreign countries have been asking for
 many changes in U.S. law in addition to
 the Antidumping Act, and that recent
 Treasury changes in its regulations,
 many of which would be ratified by the
 1965 amendment, have already acceded
 in substantial part to the major foreign
 requests.
 The third point which needs clarifica-
 tion is the editorial's misleading implica-
 tion that only the steel and cement in-
 dustries would benefit from this bill.
 This is put in the form of a statement
 that the bill would strengthen the mar-
 ket position of steel and cement, when in
 fact many of the principal beneficiaries
 will be small domestic industries and
 their labor force which have the most
 difficulty in withstanding dumping.  In a
 survey made last year covering the pre-
 vious 10-year period it was found that
 141 different product types were involved
 in 319 dumping cases, broken down into
 the following categories:
 Agricultural products_______________

 Thus, it is understandable that the
 predecessor  antidumping  amendment
 was endorsed by a number of organiza-
 tions representing substantial segments
 of their industries including, in alpha-
 betical order; Automotive parts, sup-
 plies, and equipment, braided rug, cast
 iron soil pipe, cement, cheese, copper and
 brass, electrical and electronics, fine and
 specialty wire,  fish, glove, hardwood
 plywood, hat, musical instrument, scien-
 tific apparatus, shoe and leather, tool
 and stainless steel, vegetable and melon,
 and wire and cable.  Backing has been
 provided also by such national organiza-
 tions as the American Mining Congress
 and several labor unions.
 I believe that the foregoing should
 make it clear that this is not special in-
 terest  legislation.  Moreover,  it  now
 appears that the newly revised 1965
 amendment is likely to receive even
 stronger and more widespread industry,
 labor, and congressional support than
 did the 1964 bill.
 There is no doubt that injurious
 dumping will be easier to curtail if our
 bill is passed.  This is an important ob-
 jective of S. 2045.  It is clear, also, that
 .the market positions of steel, cement,
 and many other industries-as well as
 the well-being of employees who work in
 these industries-will be strengthened
 insofar as American companies, which
 are already in tough competition with
 each other and nondumped imports,
 will have a better chance to combat un-
 fair competition from dumped imports.
 Market disruption by hit-and-run tac-
 tics, leaving to U.S. Producers the slow
 task of rebuilding to earlier price levels,
 is clearly an irresponsible International
 trade practice.  The broad generaliza-
 tion of the editorial that import compe-
 tition makes an important contribution
 to price stability and the welfare of the
 consumer, is misused when overextended
 to a dumping situation. In this "highly
 interdependent world," as the editorial
 calls it, I believe it becomes increasingly
 essential that imports compete fairly.
 On this point I should like to quote
 once again from then, Senator HuM-
 PHREY's remarks of May 27, 1963, and
 from those of Senator HUGH SCOTT, the
 principal cosponsor in the Senate of the
 1965 bill, as he was of the 1963 bill. Both
 men stressed a significant facet of this
 problem, one which I heartily endorse.
 The HuMPHREY observation was:
 I have always maintained that American
 manufacturers were fully capable of meeting
 legitimate foreign competition, but no do-
 mestic producer should be expected to with-
 stand the long-term effects of irresponsible
 dumping actions by foreign competitors.
 Senator SCOTT stated in his introduc-
 tory remarks on May 26, 1965:
 Manufacturers in this country have never
 feared legitimate competition.  Drawing up-
 on principles evolved by the courts under
 U.S. antitrust laws, my amendment would
 ask foreign suppliers selling in the United
 States to comply with the same type of
 ground rules that guide U.S. domestic in-
 dustries  The unfair double standard where
 our companies are bound to obey certain
 laws that do not apply to foreign suppliers
 would be eliminated.  The great majority of
 our industries ask only the opportunity to
 compete fairly.  They cannot do this when

 NSEEN ALLIES OF THE VIETCONG
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  Mr. Presi-
 dent,  there  appeared in yesterday's
 Washington Post an article written by
 the. syndicated  columnists Rowland
 Evans and Robert Novak. In this article
 the authors discuss the "unseen allies" of
 the Vietcong in the war in Vietnam. As
 one of these "allies" they name the
 critics  of  President  Johnson's  firm
 policy of resisting aggression in south-
 east Asia.
 I am sure that these critics do not
 wish to advance the Moscow line, as they
 are described in this article as doing, by
 giving assistance to the active enemy of
 the United States in the Vietnam war.
 The authors make it plain that the
 assistance is unwitting. The fact that it
 is unintentional, however, does not make
 it, less damaging, and I urge the critics
 to give serious consideration to the effect
 which their statements are having.
 All of us, and especially President
 Johnson, are hoping for and looking for-
 ward to the day when we can end the
 fighting in Vietnam and sit dawn at the
 negotiating table to find the basis for a
 stable and peaceful South Vietnam. In
 order for this hope to be realized, how-
 ever, the Vietcong must come to accept
 the fact, and it is a fact, that we are not
 going to be driven out of South Viet-
 nam-we are not going to abandon the
 Vietnamese people. It is clear that the
 criticisms of the President's policy and
 actions are delaying the time when the

 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that this very well conceived and
 written article be printed at this point in
 the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 SUMMER IN VIETNAM
 (By Rowland Evans and Robert Novak)
 in the dangerous rainy season offensive, the
 Communist Vietcong guerrillas have two un-
 seen allies--one an intentional ally, the other
 an unwitting ally.
 The intentional ally is Moscow.  By its
 statements of new support and weapons, the
 Soviet Union shows how far it has allowed
 itself to be pushed into North Vietnam's cor-
 ner.  And this In turn provides a crucial
 boost in Hanoi's will to win.  Hanoi Is the
 Vietcong's sponsor and supplier.
 The unwilling ally in this dangerous sum-
 mer are the U.S. critics of President John-
 son's firm policy in southeast Asia.  Every
 critical statement is puffed up far out of pro-
 portion as proof that in the end the United
 States really won't stick it out in the jungles
 of southeast Asia.
 These factors assume special importance
 in the critical new phase of the war.  With
 arrival of the summer monsoons the less
 mobile United States-South Vietnam forces
 are slowed, their air operations are impeded,
 and the light-traveling Red guerrillas gain
 a new advantage.  Each year the Vietcong
 conduct  intensive probing  operations  in
 June, then move into a major offensive in
 July.
 Nobody believes the success or failure of
 the Vietcong summer offensive will settle the
 war once and for all.  But if the Commu-
 nists score anything like their summer suc-
 cesses of 1963 and 1964, the entire gain in
 morale in South Vietnam generated by the
 U.S. bombing in the north (a gain already
 being dissipated) could be erased altogether.
 A repeat of Vietcong successes of 1963 and
 1964 might even lead to a coalition govern-
 ment in Saigon, a disastrous mixture of Viet-
 cong leaders and non-Communists.
 But if the Vietcong are stopped for the first
 time, it could be a turning point of the war.
 Among other  things,  it would much en-
 chance the new amnesty campaign aimed at
 the Vietcong (duplicating the campaign used
 so well in combating Communist guerrillas
 in Malaya a decade ago).
 In guerriilla war, morale is nearly as im-
 portant as military tactics.  That's why the
 out of proportion to their numbers is the
 dangerous tendency of the Communist intel-
 ligence community (a tendency not peculiar
 to Communist nations)  to believe what it
 wants to believe.
 For Instance, there is good reason to be-
 lieve that Communist China really thought
 India would fall apart when invaded 3 years
 ago.
 By the same token, both Peiping and
 Hanoi are known to overemphasize the im-
 portance of domestic criticism here.
 Of course, more is involved than psycho-
 logical warfare.  The continuing growth of
 U.S. ground forces has freed Vietnamese
 troops for field duty.  Moreover, U.S. officials
 hope that new battle techniques will enable
 the Vietnamese to do  better against the
 Vietcong's hit-and-run guerrilla tactics than
 the last two summers.
 A guerrilla war is beyond prediction.  One
 thing certain, however, Is that Hanoi is
 adamant  against  negotiations.   This, to-
 gether with the growing moral and physical
 aid from Moscow, has reinforced Hanoi's
 determination to go all out on another sum-
 mer offensive.                                                                                             If peace is to come to Viet-
 nam, that offensive must be stopped cold.
 SENATE SHOULD REJECT NOMINA-
 TION OF GEN. WILLIAM F. McKEE
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio.  Mr. President,
 I am opposed to S. 1900, now on the Sen-
 ate Calendar, to appoint Gen. William
 F. McKee as the Administrator of the
 Federal Aviation Agency.
 The Founding Fathers provided that
 in the United States, civilian authority
 must always be supreme over military
 authority. They specifically included in
 the Constitution the provision that the
 President of the United States shall be
 Commander in Chief of the Armed
 Forces. This has been a basic principle
 of our democracy.
 They were mindful of the inevitable
 conflict between civilian and military
 leaders.  Apparently, from what has
 taken place in the executive branch of
 our Government during recent months,
 they were Justified in being fearful of
 military domination in our Republic.
 These 18th century fears on the part of
 those patriots who won the Revolution-
 ary War and later wrote the Constitu-
 tion and Bill of Rights are equally valid
 in the 20th century.  It is suggested that
 top officials in the executive branch of
 our Government would do well to reread
 some of the debates in the Federal Con-

 our Constitution were determined that
