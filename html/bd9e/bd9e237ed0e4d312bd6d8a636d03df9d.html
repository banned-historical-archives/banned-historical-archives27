 AFFAIRS
 COMPLICATIONS IN KOREA
 S E                  they volunteers or regular
 troops, the Chinese are warring
 against McArthur's forces in North
 Korea. This realisation surely could
 please  no. one  who  truly  mean's
 peace when talking about it, and
 none of those who are able to dis-
 tinguish the dove of peace from
 the Sheffield-Warsaw  variety    of
 migrant duck.
 The question of whether volunteers
 are involved or not is (really irre-
 levant to the issue. Even the Peking
 Government itself would not be li-
 kely to  deny  that  it  had  been
 responsible for equipping, arming
 and transporting the Chinese forces
 which are in Korea. As for the pub-
 lic collections of funds in China for
 the purchase of arms and equipment,
 this, at best, could only have the
 effect of relieving the Peking Na-
 tional Bank in view of all that ma-
 terial being produced  in  govern-
 ment factories and not being availabe
 for free sale.
 In any case, the problem involved
 in Korea today is not of a type to
 be settled by means of juristic jug-
 gling. Both the United Nations and
 the whole world are confronted by
 an  eminently  political  problem,
 whose implications far transcend the
 bounds of Korea, anal even the Far
 East itself as a determinate portion
 of the globe.
 Approaching the problem of the
 presence of Chinese troops in Korea
 from  that  standpoint,  we  firstly
 have to pose the question as to why
 it came to Chinese intervetion only
 in November, and not, sooner? Why,
 for  example, did China     serenely
 watch the vain and costly, desperate
 campaign of the North Koreans a-
 ga,inst the Pusan bridgehead? Why
 did Peking allow that the main body
 of Kim Il Sen's troops, equipped by
 the Russians, be first smashed?
 Although fully reliable answers to
 these and similar questions are not
 within easy reach, one thing remains
 certain - Peking has been visibly
 restraining itself from getting direct-
 ly involved in the Korean conflict.
 The motives which finally led the
 Mao Tse-Tung Government to take
 active part in this conflict may vary.
 Regardless of the degreee of Mos-
 cow influence in the  matter, the
 crossing of the ,38th Parallel was
 bound to arouse Peking's anxiety.
 The  crosssing  into  North  Korea
 brought   McArthur's troops on the
 threshold of Manchuria, i. e. a zone
 of   momentous  interest to  China
 from the political, strategic and e-
 conomic angle.
 It is hard to presume that China's
 sole reason for intervention was to
 safeguard the hydro-electric stations
 on the Yalu river, although this fac-
 tor too certainly played an impor-
 tant part. However, judging by front-
 line reports, the activity of the Chi-
 nese forces seems to have been re-
 stricted to a relatively narrow zone
 along   the   Korean-Manchurian
 border. This would suggest that not
 even the Peking Government is set
 on having the conflict spread, and
 that the move is in the line of a
 political action rather than a full-
 scale  armed  interference  in  the
 fighting in Korea.
 This also appears to be the view
 taken by the big Western powers of
 the newly-created situation, if one
 is to go by the declarations made in
 the Security Council and elsewhere.
 This kind of both-sided reaction to
 the course of operations in Korea
 therefore leaves the  way open to
 r strict the conflict to that territory
 alone and to bring it to a  close
 through negotiations in Lake Suc-
 cess, where the representatives of
 the Peking Government are also due
 shortly.
 However, the attitude of Moscow
 has to be reckoned with as well.
 Failure in Korea so far has cost the
 USSR appreciably in prestige. The
 liquidation of the conflict by way
 of a compromise, attained largely
 owing to pressure  exerted by the
 presence of the Chinese in the front-
 ier  region,  could                                                                                          serve  to  en-
 hance the prestige of China,                                                                                              but
 could hardly boost USSR influence
 in Korea or China.
 It should cause no surprise, hence,
 if the recognition  of Chinese in-
 terests in the border region, prima-
 rily of China's right to the utilization
 of electric current from power sta-
 tions located on both sides of the
 frontier, should fail to meet with
 enthusiastic  reception  in Moscow.
 This might lead to fresh complica-
 tions, the first omen of which oc-
 curs in the negative attitude of the
 Soviet delegation toward the reso-
 lution guaranteeing China's interests
 in the frontier zone.
 The United Nations Organization
 will, nevertheless, be in a position
 to overcome these complications for
 the Soviet Union's attitude is evi-

 dently not backed by a resoluteness
 for direct intervention by the Soviet
 Army. The threats of obstructionism
 in UNO will surely impress no one
 after all the experience had so far
 in that direction, and the fact of the
 USSR being  primarily responsible
 for the outbreak of the armed con-
 flict in Korea is evident.
 Far more serious is the question
 as to what sort of situation will arise
 if it really comes to the creation of
 a special buffer-zone between Ko-
 rea and China. In that respect his-
 tory has shown the solving of dis-
 putes by means of artificial buf-
 fer  territories to serve only for
 the postponement  of  conflicts, or
 rather to act as a constant source
 of new friction.
 In the case of Korea the method
 could lead to the setting up of a
 new demarcation line to replace the
 former one (38th  Parallel) and to
 the revival, in a fresh guise, of the
 identical situation which led up to
 the conflict along the 38th Parallel
 in the first place.
 That, in effect, would be tanta-
 mount to the solving of the Korean
 question not on the  basis of that
 country's unity  and independence,
 but on the basis of a new division
 of spheres of influence in Korea,
 with China being  brought into it
 on top of USSR on this occasion.
 It was evidently not the wisest of
 decisions to confront the United Na-
 tions  with  such                         a  situation  in
 which the simplest way of escape
 is to liquidate an old problem by
 creating a new and   equally hard
 one. That decision, however, had in
 its esence been brought already then
 when the troops of General McAr-
 thur received  orders to cross the
 38th  Parallel without  a  previous
 mature settlement of  the   funda..
 mental  political question       of  the
 future of Korea.
 The hopes cherished then in the
 circlets which forced that decision, to
 the effect that it would lead to the
 rapid  termination of hostilities in
 Korea, have since  proved without
 foundation.  A duplication of this
 mistake by the reckless forcing of
 a purely military decision fortuna-
 telly no longer seems probale.                          The
 chief danger lies in the possibility
 of a revival of spheres of influence,
 separated by a new demarcation
 line.
 Today, just like then, although it
 might prove harder to effect now, a
 way out of this situation should evi-
 dently be sought by meeting the
 aspirations of the Korean people for
 unity and independence, duly gua-
 ranteed by the authority of the Uni-
 ted Nations. This is all the more
 important in view of the over-all
 tense situation in East Asia, and its
 being pregnant with different threats
 of conflict. This tension could only
 be relieved by scrapping the perilous
 idea that the peoples of Asia can be
 treated like objects of a policy of
 spheres of influence.
 Yugoslav - Greek Relations
 T HE deadlock on the question of
 establishment  of  normal  re-
 lations between Greece and Yugo-
 slavia seems to have been broken by
 the formation of the new Greek Go-
 vernment  without                                                                   Tsaldaris'  Po-
 pulists. The absence of normal re-
 lations between the two neighbor-
 ing states is harmful for both sides
 so that any step directed at changing
 this state of affairs can only be wel-
 comed as being in the ;nterests of
 international cooperation and peace
 in this part of the world, The Yu-
 goslavs have  for this  reason not
 ceased their efforts in this direct-
 ion  although, unfortunately,  they
 have not net with understanding on
 the other side.
 Yugoslavia's goodwill to have the
 question of normal relations solved
 constructively is testified to, apart
 from other things, by its decision to
 effect the repatriation of 57 members
 of the Greek armed forces who had,
 for various reasons, crossed over into
 Yugoslav territory where they were
 interned. A large section  of  the
 Greek press hailed this Yugoslav de-
 cision  as  a  manifestation  of                                                             its
 goodwill and a -step toward the nor-
 malization of relations between the
 two countries. The Greek Premier,
 Mr. Venizelos, also made a Statement
 to this effect. However, certain news-
 papers, while commenting favorably
 upon the repatriation, printed cer-
 tain inaccuracies, saying that it was-
 not only members  of  the  Greek
 armed forces who were being re-
 patriated but "hostages", or "civil-
 ians" who had supposedly been ap-
 prehended  from  Greek      territory.
 This report about hostages and ci-
 vilians is an invented one. There are
 no such persons on Yugoslav territo-
 ry nor have there been any. The re-
 patriates are exclusively members of
 the Greek armed forces, 57 persons
 in all, and include only those who
 expressed the wish to return to
 Greece. Those who did not desire to
 return have remained in Yugoslavia
 where they are living as free citi-
 zens.
 -4-
 Yugoslavia  has  also  shown  its
 desire to improve its relations with
 Greece by undertaking the necessary
 measures to accelerate the execution
 of the General Assembly re-olutioo
 regarding the repatriation of Greek
 children. At the initiative of the Yu-
 goslav Red Cross, the International
 Red Cross - which is the medium
 through which the repatriation of

 EDITORIAL COMMENT                      ---
 Soviet Union Places the
 German Problem in the
 Foreground
 A T a moment when Chinese units
 have put in an appearance in
 Korea  and when  the  tension  in
 Southeast Asia is approaching  its
 peak, the USSR has unexpectedly
 attempted to place the problem of
 G. rmany in the foreground. Soviet
 Under-Secretary of State, Gromyko,
 on the third of this month, propos-
 ed a four-power foreign ministars'
 conference to the USA, Great Brit-
 ain and France for the purpose of
 holding 'talks on Germany. At the
 same time, he presented the plat-
 form for the talks - the "peace-
 loving solution of the German pro-
 blem."
 This Soviet note was actually giv-
 en in official form in the October
 Prague statement  of the  Foreign
 Ministers of the Eastern European
 countries. This was mainly a Soviet
 propaganda move aimed at diverting
 the attention of the  world public
 from events in  the   Far East and
 covering  up  the  failure  of  the
 obstructionist Soviet policy in the
 UNO. Silnultaneusly, the aim of this
 Soviet Proposal was to introduce the
 greatest possible confusion among
 the Western powers now when they
 are  considering  the  question  of
 rearmament of Germany.
 Official and political circles in the
 West gave this Soviet proposal   a
 cool reception. By and large, they
 agree in their opinion that this meet-
 ing between the four Foreign Min-
 isters would be beneficial but they
 have very little hope as to the achie-
 vement of positive results. The rea-
 son for this is that the USSR has so
 far  systematically  obstructed  the
 talks on Austria, whose problems
 are far simpler than those 'of Germa-
 ny. At the same time, these circles
 emphasize that at all conferences so
 far the USSR has not made any con-
 cessions at its own expense in the
 interests of regulating international
 and inter-allied relations. It is con-
 sidered that the Soviet initiative
 should be taken up  insofar as  it
 shows a real desire to come to an
 understanding.
 Judging from past experience with
 the USSR and from the policy which
 the forces of occupation are pursu-
 ing in Germany - every one doing
 what is in their own interest - there
 is no sincere wish to come to an
 understanding on anyone's part.
 It is most probable that the Soviet
 Union is seeking  a  pretext for a
 meeting  of Foreign  Ministers  in
 order to get something for itself out-
 side of the scope of the German pro-
 blem, adhering to its conception that
 various problems should be consi-
 dered by the big powers alone, out-
 side of and by-passing the UNO. If
 nothing else, it is probably meant to
 have a certain propaganda effect, to
 serve as an injection of fresh blood
 to the anaemic Soviet peace propa-
 ganda and the hypocritical policy of
 discrepancies  between  words  and
 deeds. Regardless of the decisions of
 the big powers in the West, who also
 look at things from their own angles,
 even if there is a meeting between
 their  Foreign  Secretaries and the
 Soviet Foreign Minister, there will
 be no real results. No side will re-
 nounce its own interests in Germa-
 ny. And in that case, even if the
 Western powers agree to a meeting,
 it will take place, as all the pre-
 vious ones have done, without any
 direct effect on a change of destiny
 for the German people.
 Sheffield  - Warsaw
 DISCUSSING the  preparations
 for the Sheffield-Warsaw Con-
 gress, which was held recently, the
 Soviet press termed the preparations
 as the greatest epic fight for peace
 ever recorded in the history of man-
 kind. To those high-sounding words
 (we leave to the appraisal of each
 individual as to how far they actual-
 ly concur with the true position)
 were added others dealing with the
 further tasks of the Congress (nor-
 mal custom would require the tasks
 of different organizations to be pro-
 claimed during the actual congresses
 - and not beforehand). Such further
 tasks also include those well-known
 ones like: "The ceaseless unmasking
 of the propagators of a new war",
 "their being taken to task", etc., etc.
 Adding to this the slogan from Shef-
 field: "Any war propaganda should
 be prohibited", a picture is obtained
 which should be portraying in full
 the peace-loving  intentions of the
 sponsors and organizers of the Con-
 gres.s. Moreover, all this could  be
 somehow passed off on uninformed,
 well-meaning  people, and they
 might be called upon to adopt such
 slogans as the only possible platform
 in the struggle for peace. But this
 "epic fight for   peace" has again
 shown in recent days that it carries
 the seal of hypocrisy and falsehood,
 and deliberate    malevolence, which
 again precludes it once and for all
 from speaking in the name of those
 principles on which the organization
 of the World Congress of the Defend-
 ers of Peace had been founded.
 It again took the Yugoslav men
 to point out the character of that
 activity, men who, some days before
 the opening of the Congress in War-
 saw, at the plenary meeting of the
 Yugoslav National Committee for the
 Defence of Peace, called world at-
 tention to the factors which should
 not and must not be overlooked in
 discussing  those  people who  are
 straining  themselves  to represent
 Picasso's dove shut in the cage of
 Soviet hegemonistic policy as a pret-
 ty and endearing symbol of peace.
 The Yugoslavs, who for two and
 a half years have been exposed to
 an unheard of campaing of intimi-
 dation and sabre rattling on their
 frontiers,  declared at the peak of
 that "method of persuasion" (in July
 this year) that they would "never
 take up arms as an instrument of
 their national policy, except in self-
 defence". In order to convince the
 world that their peace-loving words
 were not  out of step  with their
 deeds,  the  Yugoslavs applied  to
 all the peace-loving organizations in
 the world, among them also to the
 World Congress of the Defenders of
 Peace, to send their representatives
 to Yugoslavia  to satisfy themsel-
 ves on the spot about the untruth-
 fulness and falsity of the charges ad-

 The Anxieties of the Euro-
 pean Payments Union
 I T took six weeks for the results
 to be published after the ac-
 tual closing of the first audit in the
 life of the European Payments U-
 nion. Whence so much mystery re-
 garding the Union's statement of ac-
 counts?  It is probably due to the
 desire to avoid the consequences of
 the publication of the unexpectedly
 high deficits of individual countries
 before decisions had been made for
 the removal of the resultant der-
 rangements. The  initiators of the
 Payments Union plan were not ex-
 pecting the earmarked credits to be-
 come exhausted within a mere pe-
 riod of three months and that defi-
 cits would ensue which automatical-
 ly entail payments in gold or in dol-
 lars for all future procurements.
 The entire mechanism for the e-
 qualization of payments balances of
 the Union's members has been seri-
 ously shaken already at this first
 periodic accounting. The reasons for
 this ought to be sought only partial-
 ly in the quotas (the loan limits for
 individual members and their credit
 commitments toward the Union res-
 pectively), which had been set too
 low for some countries. It is to be
 emphasized that, for the sake of lli-
 beralization of import trade - which
 obligation  is  assumed at the very
 joining of the Union - a number
 of countries had to open their fron-
 tiers to the import of foreign goods,
 and that in proportions which could
 not be even imagined if these goods
 had to be paid in foreign exchange.
 The functioning of the Union, in-
 eluding the utilization of consider-
 able  credits;  has  made  possible
 an increase in the imports of all
 those countries which, owing to the
 lack of foreign exchange, had pre-
 viously been unable to obtain the
 required supplies iin sufficient quan-
 tities. Cognizant, as far back as Ju-
 ly; I. e. at the start of the Union's
 operations, that the,  prices of key
 commodities would inevitably mark
 a  constant  upward    trend,  many
 countries took maximum advantage
 of the Union mechanism for the pur-
 chase  of  large  quatities of mer-
 cxhandise. In this fashion, they were
 able to cover also many of their fu-
 ture  needs, and to  avoid  later
 buying of indispensable raw materi-
 als at higher prices. This has placed
 them in the position of debtors to-
 ward  the Union who    had  com-
 pletely exhausted their determinate
 quotas. In effect, such countries have
 been financing their -current and fu-
 ture import requirements at the ex-
 pense of the other Union members,
 who in their turn became large cre-
 ditors of the Union.
 At its November session, the Ad-
 ministrative Board of the Union was
 due to resolve this crisis in its me-
 chanism, that is, to settle the po-
 sition of such members who could
 no longer benefit by the multi-la-
 teral transfer because of having to
 pay for any future imports in gold
 or in dollars. The choice lay between
 two alternatives: either to raise their
 quotas (credits), or to see them leave
 the Union. It appears that the Coun-
 cil of the Organization for Euro-
 pean  Economic  Cooperation  will
 adopt the proposal of the Union's
 Administrative Board for increased
 credits so as to ensure the continued
 functioning of the system of inter-
 European payments,     subject, how-
 ever, to the countries  granted in-
 creased quotas undertaking certain
 determinate measures.
 Judging by -everything, the first
 obstacles encountered by the Pay-
 ments Union have strongly shaken
 this institution in which its foun-
 ders had vested such great hopes.
 This initial  crisis seems  to  have
 been weathered, at the cost, how-
 ever, of direct control and inter-
 ference by OEEC in the internal af-
 fairs of the countries scheduled to
 be granted fresh quotas. The rea-
 sons underlying  the  unusual and
 protracted postponement of the pub-
 lication of the Union's balance sheet
 for the first quarter are hence not
 quite devoid of significance.
 A Justified Measure of the
 Yugoslav Government
 D UE to the application of terror
 and pressure against the Yu-
 goslav diplomatic representatives in
 Albania,  and the  ~restrictions, im-
 posed on their freedom of movement
 and personal liberty, the functioning
 of the Yugoslav legation in Tirana
 had been made impossible for over
 six months now, as a result of which
 Yugoslavia had been placed in an
 unreciprocal position in relation to
 Albania. At the same time, the Al-
 banian legation in Beograd had been
 converted from a diplomatic insti-
 tution into a plain instrument of the
 unpacific and provocative policy of
 the Albanian  Government toward
 Yugoslavia.
 For these reasons, and after the
 Albanian legation in Beograd had
 returned, on October 28, without
 motivation, the Yugoslav  Govern-
 ment Note of Protest dated Octo-
 ber 22, concerning the armed attack
 (on October 12 this year) by Alba-
 nian frontier forces against Yugoslav
 frontier guards,  which led to the
 serious wounding and subsequent
 death of the Yugoslav frontier guard,
 Milorad   Djuric,   the   Yugoslav
 Government,  on November 11 this
 year, communicated to the Albanian
 Government that it considered the
 further stay of the Albanian repre-
 sentatives in Yugoslavia as super-
 fluous.
 The news reports and comments
 which appeared in the world press
 in that connection  referred to  the
 severing of diplomatic relations with
 Albania, which, however, is incor-
 rect. In its Note the Yugoslav Go-
 vernment   expressed                                                                                                     its  readi-
 ness to maintain further diplomatic
 contact through its legation in Bu-
 dapest. The abstention from the se-
 verance of diplomatic relations in
 this situation is in fact a fresh proof
 of the patience and pacifism of the
 Yugoslav Government. For, in order
 to grasp what it amounted to, and
 still does, to maintain diplomatic
 contact with the Albanian Govern-
 ment, it is necessary to know that
 it  involves  correspondence  with
 such state functionaries who in their
 notes adhere to a vocabulary hither-

 "cannibalistic  regime", "gangster

 kyist ,banditism", etc., etc.
 It was the Albanian Government
 itself  which   by  displaying  so
 far in a whole series of moves
 towards  Yugoslavia  that  it  was
 not   anxious   about   the   nor-
 malization  of                             relations with the
 latter, or the resolving of disputed
 questions - all of which originate
 from the Albanian side - actually
 caused the further functioning of its
 representation in Beograd to become
 superfluous. And that this course of
 action strained the relations with
 Yugoslavia ever more cannot be dis-
 guised by any phraseology of the
 Cominform press, which endeavours
 to portray the chief culprit - the
 Enver Hoxha government - as some
 alleged victim, one whose lot it was
 to have Yugoslavia even sever di-
 plomatic relations with it. But this
 attempt only serves to show that
 press as having again been indulg-
 ing in the distortion of obvous facts.
 Motives of the Currency
 Reform in Poland
 T HE official statement about the
 currency  reform in Poland is
 primarily designed as propaganda
 for the people inside the country. It
 does not speak at all about the real
 motives and aims of that reform.
 This statement is characteristic only
 in that it brings the reform into
 direct  association  with the plan,
 which, - by an order from Moscow
 - had to be subjected recently to
 a radical change.
 The currency reform was carried
 -out for reasons     which are really
 of an internal and external nature.
 of wages shall remain unaltered pro-
 vided the prices of certain pro-
 ducts do not  rise or if the state
 taxes and dues are not increased.
 As regards the capitalist  world,
 the currency reform will not have
 any significance. From now on, as
 before, capitalist countries will not
 trade with Poland on the basis of
 the zloty but on the basis of the dol-
 lar. The internal rate of the dollar
 for the zloty shall not have any in-
 fluence on the exchange relations
 between Poland  and  the  foreign
 countries.
 However, there is a matter concern-
 ing which the statement makes no
 mention. That is the relationship of
 Poland and the Soviet Union in the
 sphere of the payments and currency
 exchange  in  general. It is certain
 that this transference of the zloty
 on a gold.standard and the establish-
 ment of its parity with the rouble
 is neither  accidental nor  without
 significance it is the first change of
 this  kind  in the  Soviet bloc. It
 should be kept in mind that Poland
 is the first country which, after the
 revaluation of the rouble, began to
 report the value of its foreign trade
 in roubles. Now, it is the first to es-
 tablish the parity between its curren-
 cy and the rouble, It is true that
 the exchange between Poland and
 the Soviet  Union is conducted on
 the basis of world prices, and that
 it is immaterial in which currency
 these prices are reported. In such
 a case the curency reform need not
 signify  any  modification  in  the
 sphere   of  trade   exchange.  But
 it is certain that it represents one
 of the further elements in the plan
 "for unification", i, e. subjugation.
 It represents one of the moves -
 neither the first, nor the last - for
 strengthening the Soviet hegemony
 and the exploitation and subjugation
 of Poland and the growing loss of
 Poland's independence. At any rate,
 the motives which determined the
 character of the present currency
 reform in Poland were by no means
 of a secondary nature.
 One of the primary internal rea-
 sons was the checking of excessive
 inflation; confiscation of .money from
 the hands of those who acquired it
 under  conditions  favourable  for
 speculation; and to again establish
 the balance between the monetary
 and the goods funds. The unfavour-
 able                                                              ratio  between   these  two
 funds began to deteriorate very ra-
 pidly after Poland  terminated the
 ration card  system.  This measure

 O N November 8, the world press
 carried a brief, scarcely visible
 item:    The  representative  of  the
 USSR had returned without any mo-
 tivation to the session of the Allied
 Council for Japan.
 It was on January 18th this year
 that the news was published of Ge-
 neral Deveryenko, representing the
 USSR in the Allied Council for Ja-
 pan, having left a meeting of this
 body in protest against the placing
 on the agenda of the question of re-
 patriation of Japanese POW's from
 the Soviet Union.
 This demonstration is now over,
 the representative of USSR is back
 in the Council and - just as the
 exit from the Council had been un-
 pricipled, so was the return to itun-
 glorious and unpricipled. The Soviet
 press has been silent on the subject,
 tarrying as usual to report on fai-
 lures in the USSR's foreign political
 manoeuvres which have been mul-
 tiplying in the past few years.
 From that day onwards prices began
 to rise higher and higher, and on
 the markets there  were less and
 less  goods.  There arose  insur-
 mountable obstacles in the -supply of
 goods for the people, and Poland had
 to return soon to some sort of ration-
 ing cards for supplying the workers
 at least with the basic necessities.
 With this measure, the difficulties
 with supplies were not solved. On
 the contrary, they were growing,
 and the purchasing power of work-
 ers' wages was declining. So now the
 question arises, is the working class
 of Poland going to gain any advan-
 tage from this currency reform? Or
 wheter, and to what extent, shall
 the relation of prices and wages re-
 sult - after the reform -- in a rise
 of the purchasing  power  of the
 workers? The manner of currency
 reform, as it was defined, does not
 change the previous relationship of
 prices and wages.

 T hat the influence of the Communist Party
 of Germany is decreasing steadily is a fact
 that can be observed every day. The working
 class, and the working people of the decisive in-
 dustrial regions on the Rhine and :in the Ruhr
 have, to a certain extent, turned their backs on
 this Party. The leadership of the Party attempts
 to interpret this by saying that the 12-year rule
 of fascism dulled the class consciousness of the
 German proletariat, but such an explanation is
 not in the least satisfactory. The very fact that
 the influence of the Communist Party was much
 greater in 1946-47 than it is now shows the
 untenability of such a lukewarm excuse. Apart
 from this, in recent months we have been able
 to note an increase in the class consciousness of
 the working class in Germany, especially among
 the construction workers, which found obvious
 expression during the strikes of workers em-
 ployed along the inland waterways.
 What are the reasons which led hundreds
 of thousands of German workers to turn their
 backs on their Party? Why did tens of thousands
 of old working class functionaries leave the
 Communist Party of Germany,  a Party  for
 which they had often languished in !prisons and
 concentration camps? Why does the youth no
 longer have faith in the Party which the immor-
 tal Karl Liebknecht founded? The leadership
 of the German. Communist Party will never an-
 swer these questions. It dares not approach
 these delicate questions with  socialist  argu-
 ments. But we must do so  because we are
 socialists and because the rehabilitation of the
 socialist working class movement in Germany
 requires a. squaring of accounts with the harm-
 ful relics dating from the past.
 After 1945, when the Soviet Army became a
 force of occupation in Germany, when certain
 regions in Germany were wrested away by force
 and annexed to the, Soviet Union and the Peo-
 pie's Republic of Poland, it was clear to many
 communists that the policy of the Soviet Union
 could not longer be brought into accord with
 the principles of Lenin, for Lenin had sought
 peace without annexations and tributes and ex-
 plicitly established that only imperialist powers
 indulge in the grabbing of another's territory.
 In addition to this, the Soviet Union's ruthless
 and raw occupation and reparations policies
 ruined all the hopes of socialistically-inclined
 people. Erroneous principles applied in their
 own Soviet territory now began to be imple-
 mented in Germany, too. Walter Uhlbricht and
 his friends took orders which were ruthlessly
 carried out in Germany. The recognition of the
 Oder-Niesse boundary line by the leadership of
 the United Socialist Party of Germany,, 'the
 elimination of factory councils in. the Russian
 Zone  of Occupation,  the  holding of  public
 elections in which candidates were not nominat-
 ed in a -democratic manner, the imprisoning of
 hundreds of old, tried and true working class
 functionaries who, had expressed doubts in. the
 correctness of such methods, the application of
 purely fascist methods to stifle all criticism -
 all this succeeded in creating the quiet of the
 tomb in the Eastern  Zone of Germany  and
 threatened to wreck the socialist movement in
 Germany.
 Soviet leaders in Berlin - in Karlhorst,
 sought that the leadership of the United Social-
 ist Party and the Communist Party of Germany
 implement a policy corresponding to the poli-
 tical concepts of their own bureaucratic caste.
 They regard the German Democratic Republic
 as some sort of state and country subjected to
 their will, having only to fulfil the tasks set by
 the  Soviet bureaucracy.  The relationship be-
 tween the Soviet leaders and the Secretariat of
 the United. Socialist Party and the Party leader-
 ship of the German Communist Party is that
 of master and servant. The working class has
 seen through this apathetic subordination to the
 orders  of  a  foreign Government  apparatus,
 which had heretofore been unrecorded in the
 German  working  class  movement;  it  has
 perceived its harmful effects and rejected it.
 Taking the big landed estates from their
 owners and the power from the big capitalists
 was not the work of the German working class.
 These measures were put through by order of
 the Soviet occupation organs, and the German
 working class was not, nor did it dare to be, an
 active factor in this process, which means that
 Russian patterns were used in Germany. The
 socialists, however, could not but know that
 the emancipation of the proletariat from ex-
 ploitation could only be carried out by the
 working class itself. However, in this case it
 was exclusively a foreign state apparatus that
 was dictating its will so that the reforms car-
 ried out, especially in many areas where the
 big estates were divided up into small and
 very tiny parcels, were without a  dobut  not
 guided by socialist ideas. The founding of Soviet

 stock companies was an arbitrary act by an oc-
 cupation power and finally, the following must
 be said clearly and loudly: the working people
 in the German Democratic Republic can barely
 defend their own vital interests because the
 occupation authorities and a new bureacratic
 machine of willing German assistants are hold-
 ing the state power in their hands.
 While the old reactionary forces in Western
 Germany - naturally not without the help of
 the three Western occupation powers - have re-
 gained their old political and economic power,
 while they have been burdening the working
 masses with the cost of the lost war and invest-
 ing many billions in new enterprises during the
 last two years, while capitalism in Western Ger-
 many has been able to strengthen its positions
 in relation to the proletariat by force, the work-
 ing class has not been in a position. to organize
 any real resistance owing to the d e p e n d en t
 policy of the German Communist Party leaders.
 The present strength of the Social-Democratic
 Party of Germany rests on the fact that there
 is no independent socialist workers' party which
 could hold high the principles of Marx and En-
 gels, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, and
 embrace the science of Lenin.
 While the Social-Democratic Party is un-
 conditionally subordinating itself to the policies
 of the Western powers, and Dr. Schumacher is
 offering some sort of economic opposition to
 Adenauer's Government, the leadership of the
 Communist Party of Germany, upon instruc-
 tions from and to the advantage of its Soviet
 bosses, are preaching to the workers in West-
 ern Germany that  they must fight  together
 with the bourgeoisie of Western Germany in
 one united "National Front". It is true that the
 German bourgeoisie has lost its primary posi-
 tion in the world and on the European contient,
 it is true that the leading force of the imperial-
 ist states - the USA - will not stand for Ger-
 many playing the first violin in its cacophonous
 concert, but it is also true that in the exploita-
 tion of the Western German proletariat Ger-
 man monopoly capitalism is acting independ-
 ently. The well-known paragraph from "The
 Communist Manifesto" which says that the
 working class must temporarily link itself to the
 bourgeoisie when the latter is acting in a revo-
 lutionary manner, cannot be applied  to  the
 Western German situation and to the Western
 German monopoly bourgeoisie. There should
 be no "National Front" between that bourgeoisie
 and the Western German working class. There
 must be no hypocrisy here. A clear stand must
 be taken and a truly socialist party in Ger-
 many must pursue  a  policy which will cor-
 respond to the scientific, political and cultural
 needs of our own country, of the German pro-
 letariat. In this connection, the need to act in
 concert with the working class of the ' whole
 world must never be lost from view.
 The equality of all communist parties and
 all socialist parties must be an irrefutbale prin-
 ciple. No one Party must sidbordinate itself
 to the interests of some other country and it is
 unworthy for the Soviet representatives to con-
 trol the German  newspapers, maltreat their
 editors, appoint persons to their places who do
 not enjoy the confidence of the German work-
 ing class but have the support of the Kremlin.
 On the question of the independence of Com-
 munist parties, and in no case on that question
 alone, we agree completely with the courage-
 ous Communist Party of Yugoslavia.
 The fatal course of the Social-Democratic
 Party of Germany and the Communist Party of
 Germany impose upon the responsible working
 clas functionaries  in  Western Germany the
 need to create a new socialist movement. The
 new independent workers' party must inherit
 the admirable traditions of the German work-
 ers' movement. This new Party, if its adopts
 the teaching of Marxism, will be free and will
 not subordinate itself to either the system of
 American monopoly capitalism or Stalin's bu-
 reaucracy.  Thousands of real socialists,  who
 were already organized  in  the Communist
 Party of Germany and the Social-Democratic
 Party of Germany, or even stood aside from
 these two traditionally working class parties,
 welcome our efforts aimed at creating a new
 working class party in Germany.
 We know we shall come upon great dif-
 ficulties and it really was a hard decision to
 take the course we chose. But we know that the
 Communist Party of Germany is no longer in
 a position to lead the proletariat owing to its
 absolute dependence on the Soviet apparatus.
 One of the most important instruments for the
 achievement of our goal is our socialist weekly,
 "Free Tribune", which renders possible lively
 and socialist discussions of all socialist problems
 and simultaneously points out the way to the
 workers,  the  way in which they can deliver
 themselves from misery, dependence and mis-
 fortune.
 We are at the beginning, but thousands of
 hands are being extended to us and the social-
 ists of all countries can be certain that the
 German working class is not lost. It still has
 enough strength to again become a powerful
 factor and from these columns, which were the
 first to allow us to offer an exposition of our
 views outside of the borders of Germany,  we
 send our greetings to the communists and social-
 ists in the whole  world. I send  my personal
 greetings  to  those comrades from the many
 countries of Europe whose fate I shared for
 many years in the Nazi concentration camp at
 Buchenwald.

 FROM THE U N O
 FOR REAL SUPPRESSION OF AGGRESSION
 OR FOR PURPOSES OF PROPAGANDA?
 O N the 9th of this month, the Political Comi?ttee
 of the UN General Assembly adopted the Yu-
 goslav        Draft  Resolution  "on  the duties of states
 in case of the breaking out of hostilities." According
 to the proposal, two states finding themselves enga-
 ged in an  armed conflict must undertake all steps
 to bring the dispute to an end. It is the duty of
 that state whose armed forces crossed over into the
 territory of another state to declare that it will with-
 draw its forces and, simultaneously, to inform the
 UNO of this In adopting this resolution, the United
 Nations have laid down the principle, stretching to
 any eventual cases of aggression, to the effect that the
 invitation for the cessation of hostilities and for the
 withdrawal of troops from alien territory shall take
 immediate effect, and not later than 24hrs. following
 the outbreak of hostilities between states. Keeping in
 mind the right of an a'taoked state to self-defense, the
 Resolution also provides for action by the UN Com-
 mission for the Control of Peace in case it is not al-
 ready functioning at the location where the conflict
 has broken out.
 The Soviet Delegation  and the delegations  of
 Eastern Europe under its control took advantage of
 the discussion preceding the adoption of the Yugo-
 slav draft resolution to speak about the question of
 peace in their usual propaganda-like . manner. They
 approached this important question for the preser-
 vation of peace and constructive international co-
 operation not from the angle of concrete political
 action which moves a cause forward and wins over
 people by its  positive results, but for the aim of
 propagating their own policy. The Soviet Delegation
 submitted its own proposal of a "declaration to elimi-
 nate the danger of a new war and to, consolidate the
 peace and security of peoples" only for the purpose
 of putting forward an antithesis to the Yugoslav
 Resolution.
 In contrast to the Yugoslav proposal which was
 adopted by 51 votes in the UN, the great majority
 of them from small states, and which takes the in-
 terests of those states into account, the Soviet Re-
 solution did not contain one word about the interests
 of the small 'states. On the contrary, It made mention
 only of the various forms of and pretexts for aig-
 gression against some state but no provision was
 made for measures to prevent that aggression. In e-
 numerating the forms and protests, which was done
 for purely demagogic puproses, the Soviet representa-
 tives submitting  the  resolution avoided  defining
 blockades by land sea and air and economic blockades
 as aggression. This last is also one of the forms of
 pressure and aggression. They refrained from doing
 so because in that case the USSR would be forced
 to stop its current practice.
 A reflection of the Soviet aspirations is contained
 in the criticism tendered by the delegates from the
 Soviet bloc of that point in the original Yugoslav
 proposal providing for the cessation of  war opera-
 tions within 24 hours after the outbreak of aggres-
 sion. According to the  concepts of the Soviet Dele-
 gation, this period of time was "too long."
 Regardless of the fact that it had a few days
 earlier sought that  in case of aggression a special
 session of the UN General Assembly should be con-
 vened not in 24 hours but in two weeks, the Soviet
 Delegation made this objection! Under the present
 conditions of development of war technique and the
 balance of forces among states, the Soviet two-week
 period would be ample time for a big power to li-
 quidate any small state whatsoever and  to  place
 every international  forum  before an accomplished
 fact  by  way ofvariouis diplomatic  machinations.
 Keeping in mind the present policy of the USSR, it
 is not harrd to arrive at the reason why the Soviet
 delegates sought a free hand for the aggressor for a
 full two weeks.
 When it became clear that the revised text of
 the Yugoslav Resolution and the mechanism it pro-
 vides for were really acceptable to all the UN imem-
 bers, the Polish delegate, on behalf of the Soviet
 bloc, made the observation that the Yugoslav pro-
 posal contained the ".shortcoming of not referring to
 the duties of states before -the outbreak of aggres-
 sion."  This he did with  the aim of  diverting the
 course of the discussion into futile channels,  pro-
 longing it and decreasing the significance of the pro-
 posed resolution.
 It did not just happen in a haphazard sort of way
 that the Polish delegate was the one to make this
 illogical observation which was entirely out of place.
 So that the Soviet delegate would not be one of those
 from the, Eastern European bloc who actually spreads
 the fear of war while speaking  about  peace,  the
 Polish delegate took this duty uncn himself. In re-
 ferring to this "shortcoming in -the Yugoslav Reso-
 lution", he delivered an address mainly about the
 dangers threatening the countries of people's democ-
 racy. This speech can be described only as disguised
 warmongering  propaganda, calculated to intimidate
 the people in the Eastern European countries,   so
 that they would silently and unconditionally adopt
 every Soviet proposal and Faction.
 In the scope of these Soviet aspirations not only
 in relation to the Co:minform countries but to the rest
 ,of the world as well, the Soviet counter- proposal to
 the Yugoslav resolution does not in essence provide
 any sort of guarantee against the aggressor. It is li-
 mited to a mere legal -formula, without taking the
 substance into account, which in this case is much
 more important than bureaucratic forms.
 Taking into consideration the state of affairs in
 the countries of the Eastern European bloc, the pre-
 sent policy of the leaders of that bloc and the stand
 taken by their representatives, it is not hard to see that
 the USSR has the intention of obstructing the work
 of the Political Committee and of diverting its at-
 tention from the most essential question of today -
 how to prevent and suppress any eventual aggres-
 sion.
 Thanks to the correctness and the force of ,the
 Yugoslav proposal and the understanding  it  met
 with among the majority of the delegations, the So-
 viet maneuver did not succeed. But it did succeed
 in showing that the. USSR is not at all concerned with
 sincere international cooperation.

 AN ELOQUENT SILENCE
 SILENCE can sometimes actually mean silence,
 but it can occasionally be very eloquent. And
 in this silence one can either utter a truth or a lie.
 In connection with the article "Powerful Weapon in
 the Struggle for  Communism",  published  by  the
 "Pravda", the organ of the Central Committee of the
 Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on October
 1st, 1950, J. V. Stalin keeps silent.
 The article states inter alia:
 The   publication of this book by Stalin 'A Short
 Course of the History of the Communist Party of the
 Soviet i ,ai,rin (B)' represents the mist important event in
 the ideological life of the Soviet Union and the entire
 world communist movement. The great victorious ideas of
 Marxism-Leninism, whose victories are recounted on the
 pages, of Stalin's work ...
 "The victorious ideas  of  Marxism-Leninism"?
 One of the fundamental ideals of this science is the
 struggle for truth. But Stalin keeps absolutely silent
 when ascribed a work which represents the most
 important event in the ideological life of the Party of
 the Soviet Union and the entire world communist mo-
 vement. And what about the "Capital" and all the
 other works by Marx, Engtlls, and Lenin? What do
 they represent in the struggle of the proletariat? Ac-
 cording to the "Pravda" estimate they are undoubt-
 edly of secondary importance. However, the silence
 of which we wish to speak does not refer so much to
 the attitude with respect to the "Pravda" estimate of
 the importance of he "Short Course" as to the fact
 that Stalin keeps silent when ascribed the merit of
 having written a work published a mere twelve years
 ago, when the history of this book is still known to
 many.
 Propaganda in the USSR to all appearances as-
 sumes the young generation to be of very limited
 mental faculties;assumes that no one will even think
 of asking why the "Short Course", if indeed written
 by Stalin, was published in 1938 without his signature?
 Or why, instead of the name of the author, can one
 read on the covers of the "Short Course" that this
 work has been "Edited by the Commission  of  the
 Central Committee of the Communist Party of the
 Soviet  Union".  Or  why,  again,  the  decision of
 the Central Committee  of  the  Soviet Communist
 Party of November 14,1938, on the "Organization of
 Party Propaganda", in connection with the publica-
 tion of the                          "Short  Course", d.d not mention by a
 single word that Stalin is the author of this work?
 1`nld so on and so forth. To all these auestion's the only
 answer from the USSR is - silence. E. Yaroslavsky
 would probably have quite a lot to say on the matter,
 but he too keeps silent. The motives which induce him
 to this are, however, not identical with those of J. V.
 Stalin.
 Should we decide to believe the "Pravda's" as-
 sertion that the "Short Course" is the work of J. V
 Stalin, we would have to pause in surprise at page
 95 of this book, The -author introduces himself to his
 readers in the following way:
 At that time Comrade Stalin carried through tremen-
 rteus revolutfunairv work in the Lower Caucasus. Comrade
 Stalin exposed  and defeated   the   Mensheviks, as the
 opponents of the  Revolution   and armed uprising.   He
 prepared the workers radically for a decisive  struggle
 against autarchv.
 Truly, very "modest". But that is not the only
 place where we encounter such "modesty". On page
 307 we come upon the following paragraph:
 Of great Importance for the ideological   defeat of
 Trotskyism was the theoretical work of Comrade Stalin,
 i On  the Foundations of Leninism'. which was published
 n 1824. This brochure is a masterly 'exposition and pro-
 foundly theoretical elaboration of Leninism. It provided
 and  is now providing Bolsh'cvi;>rs ahrou,mhout  the world
 with the sharp weapon of Marxist-Leninist theory.
 Other similar passages could be quoted. How-
 ever, what we are dealing with here is neither mode-
 sty nor immodesty, but far graver problems. While
 the "Short Course" was considered  the  work of a
 oomrnission, of which E.  Yaroslavsky            was  also  a
 member, it was only logical to expect that, the Com-
 mission, though  not  stressing it explicitly,                                                                                                                          should
 have made use of the earlier work of its member, E.
 Yaroslavsky. The Commission of the Central Com-
 mittee of the Soviet Communist Party was certainly
 under no obligation to mention that the "History of
 the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (B)", by
 E. Yarosiavsky,   -served  as  a basis for the  "Short
 Course". But since it is being asserted today that the
 "Short Course" is the work of J. V. Stalin and that
 it "represented the most important event in the ideo-
 logical life of the Party of the Soviet Union and the
 entire world communist movement", one feels com-
 pelled, for the sake of truth, to set 'ou't the relation
 between the  "Short  Course of  the  History of the
 Communist Party of the Soviet Union ('B)" and the
 "History  of  the  Communist     Party of the Soviet
 Union (B)" by E. Y'aroslavsky.
 The second edition of E. Yaroslavsky's "History
 of the CPSU (B)" was published in Moscow in 1934.
 The first edition of the "Short Course" was published
 in 1938, likewise in Moscow.
 'Iwo books can be compared in general outlines
 and in details. We shall begin with the particular and
 proceed to the general. Are there any similarities
 in  the  details?  Yaroslavsky's  "History"  and  the
 "Short Course" contain passages which refer to the
 same period of time and which read as follows:
 E. Yaroslavsky: -
 The Moscow uprising was suppressed regardless of
 all the heroism d'is'pliaved by the upsurgent workers.
 The Moscow uprising was not isolated. Revolutionary
 uprisings spread to a series of other towns' and regions.
 Armed uprisings broke out in Krasnoyarska, Molotovilih,
 Novoroeisk,   Sevastopol,   Kronstat.   Especially  tenacius
 struggles were waged in the Baltic       region  (Latvia).  in
 Georgia,  and in  the  region  of  the     Yekaterinoslavska
 railway ...
 How did the Bolsheviks judge this uprising, and how
 the Mensheviks?
 The Menshevik Plekhanov after the uprising rebuked
 the Party: 'Erne should not have taken to arms ... They
 (the Mensheviks) in all possi:ble' ways belittled the signi-
 ficance of the uprising and mocked it, endeavouring to
 prove in all possible ways that the course of uprising was
 a hopeless utopian course or struggle'.
 The   Bolsheviks   did not take this attitude to the
 uprising. For them the test of the Moscow uprising only
 confirmed the possibility of a successful struggle of the
 working class ... To Plekhanov's rebuke 'One should not
 r, rve taken to arms'. Lenin reiplied: "On the contrary, one
 should have done so more decisively ...
 'use "Short Course": -
 The Moscow uprising was suppressed.
 The uprising 'did not restrict itself to Moscow alone.
 Revolutionary uprisings spread to a series of other towns
 and regions. Armed uprisings broke out in Krasnoyarska,
 W itotovilth   (Perm),   Novo,ros;sk,   Seamov,   Sevastopol,
 Kronstat.
 The oppressed  peoples of Russia also rose  to arms.
 The uprising spread to almost the whole of GeorQla? An
 uprising of bigger proportions broke out in the Uraine,
 in the Donbas: in Gorlovika   Alexandrovska,    Luganska
 (Voroshilovgrad). The struggle in Latvia was of a tenacious
 character...
 The Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks judged the De-
 cember armed uprising In different ways.
 The Menshevik Plekhanov after the uprising rebuked
 the Party  "One  should not have  taken to arms".  The
 Mensheviks endeavoured to prove that the uprising was

 unnecessary and harmful, that one could switch over to
 a revolution without uprisings, that success could not he
 attained by means of armed uprisings, but by peaceful
 means of struggle.
 The Bolsheviks branded such an attitude as traitorous.
 They considered that the Moscow uprising' had only con-
 firmed the possibility of an armed struggle of the working
 class. To Plekhanov's rebuke  One should not have taken
 t,o axm"s . Lan.kn replied "On the c,intrary, one should have
 done so more decisively ...
 And one can thus read through the entire "His-
 tory". To each page one can find  a  corresponding
 text - somewhat altered in .some places, textually copi-
 ed in others. There is no need to prove that this is
 impermissible, all the more so when one omits to
 mention the source which has been made use of in
 the work.
 And when this is how matters stand with  the
 details, what are we to say of the whole. An expe-
 rienced reader who is interested in certain problems
 starts by reading the contents of a book. If we take
 a look at how E. Yaroslav.sky laid out his book, and
 then cast a glance at the "Short Course", we shall
 immediately be able to establish that what we have
 before us are two variations of one and the same
 plan. (Many of the chapters of the "Short Course"
 have exactly the same titles as the chapters of Ya-
 rosla.vsky's "History of the CPSU (B)".
 The "Short Course", written later, has in every
 respect gone a step further ahead from E. Yaroslav-
 sky's History - both in a positive  and  negative
 respect. The connections between the CPSU (B) and
 the other parties in the world are far more emphasis-
 ed in Yaroslavsky's book than they are in the "Short
 Course".  Yaroslavsy, in 1934, as literature for dif-
 ferent chapters - for the part up to Lenin's death
 - quoted  Lenin  almost exclusively.  The  "Short
 Course". true enough, quotes no literature for the
 different chapters, but displays many odd symp`oms.
 Thus, for example, in the part dealing with the Oc-
 tober Revolution, Stalin is placed on an equal foot-
 ing with Lenin. The glorification of Stalin has be-
 come . a permanent process. The Soviet propaganda
 in a roundabout way glorifies Stalin as one of the
 founders of the Bolshevik  Party. In the "Pravda"
 and elsewhere, Stalin has been proclaimed the au-
 thor of the "Short Course", and moreover the "Pravda"
 article with which we are dealing does not stop at
 this assertion only. The article also asserts that:
 Historical experience and implementation have con-
 firmed the theory of Lenin-Stalin .on the victory of soci-
 alism in one separate country, on the Soviets as the best
 form of the political organization of society in the trans -
 tion period from capitalism to socialism, on the Party as
 the Guldina and chanelling  force in the system of the
 working class-leaders and the organizers of the masses in
 the struggle for communism .
 Whom is one to believe? The "Pravda" article
 or the "Short Course"? On the theoretical premises
 which the "Pravda", as we have shown above, ascri-
 bes, in addition to Lenin, also to J. V. Stalin, the
 "Short Course" says the following:
 On the grounds of all this Lenin came to the con-
 clusion that it is perfectly possible for the proletariat to
 force the imperialist front anywhere, in one place or in
 several places, that the victory of socialism is, possible,
 first in several countries, or even In one separate one...
 Lenin announced th's premise in an article en-
 titled "On the Slogan of the United States of Europe",
 published in August 1915. The "Short Course" does
 not by a single word mention Stalin as being the
 author of this theory.
 On the other theoretical premise, which refers to
 the Soviets, the "Short Course" says:
 The Revolution of 1905 showed that the Soviets are
 the bodies of an armed uprising and at the same time
 the seeds of new, revolutionary government. The idea of
 the   Soviets lived in the consciousness of the wo Cuing
 masses,   and they realized it on the   morrow of the
 overthrow of realized it on the morrow of the overthrow
 of tsarism ...
 Thus, here, too, there. is no question of a theo-
 retical premise which Stalin laid down together with
 Lenin. On the third premise, namely, on the Party
 being the guiding force, the "Short Course" says:
 Lenin more than forty years ago (today more than
 fifty years ago) co(rectly pointed out the course of the
 struggle of the working class, determined its role as that
 of a guiding revolutionary force of society, determined
 the role  of the peasantry as that of the  allies of the
 working class .
 Lenin worked out the whole of his theory on the
 dictatorship of the proletariate  alone,                                   using  the
 works of Marx and Engels. That is what we are also
 told by Stalin in his book "Questions of Leninism".
 And to all this J. V. Stalin is silent, silent                                and
 approving. But that will not make lies turn into
 truth. And neither will the assertion that Stalin is
 the author of the "iShort Course" actually make him
 become this. The Soviet propaganda has resorted to
 this unworthy trick in order to help in the efforts
 to raise Stalin to the pedestal of Divinity - as ido-
 latry corresponds to the system of bureaucracy.')
 The process is developing. But parallel to it de-
 velops the consciousness of the lndllions of the people,
 who will once ask that this silence cease and that
 they be told the truth about many matters.

 1)  We  shall  give  a  small  example:  in  its  efforts  to
 present J. V. Stalin's theoretical work greater than it actually
 is, the Soviet propaganda has resorted to such naive means
 as to publish V. I. Len'in's and J. V. Stalin's works in, the
 same  form, at  first glance.  11lowever,  while  16  pages    of
 Lenin's work have ;7,600 typographical signs, the same number
 of pages in Stalin's works have only 25,600 signs. A text of
 the same length when printed under Lenin's        name makes
 two and under Stalin's name, three volumes.

 LIFE  IN  SOCIALIST  YUGOSLAVIA
 WORKERS' COUNCILS IN ACTION
 T HERE exists a comprehensible interest abroad,
 especially among workers, in connection with the
 activities and organization of the Yugoslav Work-
 ers' Councils and their Managing Boards. They re-
 present a new, revolutionary phenomenon along the
 line of consistent application  of  the  teachings  of
 Marx and Lenin. Hence their importance and the
 broad interest attached to them.
 Tens of thousands of workers are engaged in the
 management of Yugoslav economic enterprises.       Re-
 cent days have seen the consultation of the manag-
 ing boards. and directors of different undertakings
 according to industrial branches.
 Parallelly with .the above, the 13th Plenum of the
 Central Committee of Trade Unions was also held.
 Both the consultations and the Plenum are character-
 istic and important for the internal life and develop-
 ment of the new Yugoslavia. The consultations  by
 virtue of having for the firs time, after 3 to 4 months'
 practical management  of  enterprise;,  brought to-
 gether the workers-managers from all parts of the
 country to compare notes, review the successes and
 weak points of their activities and to lay down plans
 for their future work. The Plenum placed into the
 centre of attention the question of the role and place
 of the trade unions in the building of socialism, more
 specifically  in  relation  to  Workers' Councils and
 Managing Boards.
 These are the initial steps of the complex  revo-
 lutionary process of conversion of direct producers
 into managers of       economy  and -- in the last a-
 nalysis - of the state itself. New legislation concern-
 ing economic enterprises and a new financial system
 are being worked out by the Yugoslav Government.
 Both are due to be adapted to the basic goal, i. e. the
 taking over of factories by the workers and the ac-
 celeration of the process of incorporation of working-
 men in their management. Under the new financial
 system, the workers of a factory share in the distri-
 bution of their surplus work. The practical meaning
 of this is that they take part in the determination
 of their wages. In the Soviet Union and the Comin-
 form countries the workers' wages are fixed behind
 the backs of the working class, without the latter's
 participation and control. They are decided by a
 bureaucratic caste which is beyond control and which
 itself disposes of the  surpluses.  And the measure of
 personal freedom - in the last analysis -- is deter-
 m'ned by the degree in which the people have a de-
 ciding voice in the disposal of the surplus products of
 their labour.
 The working class of Yugoslavia is proceeding to
 grapple in practice with the difficulties necessarily
 imposed by the revolutionary  path  it treads. It is
 already scoring its first feats along that path.
 The Management Board of   the   "Impel" factory,
 in Slcvenia, is rightly proud of the results accomplish-
 ed by it. It largely consists of machine operators
 (three-quarters  of the board members must come
 from the workers' ranks under the law). It is a fact
 that they are still insufficiently familiar with such
 professional matters  like  accounting, the various o-
 perations requiring a specialized knowledge of che-
 mistry, physics, etc.                          But   then the factory  possesses
 its  experts for such jobs.  The Managing Board has
 proceeded to subject to :minute analysis the entire
 mechanism of the work organizat,lon, it has detect-
 ed the weak spots                         and posed  concrete tasks    both
 before the experts and the individual departments
 of the factory. The Managing Board of the "Bade
 Koncar" factory, on the other hand, subsequent to a
 study of its. enterprise, found that the tool shop was
 undeveloped and inadequate to meet the enterprise's
 requirements. Tangible conclusions and the assign-
 ments given to the technical staff resulted in the
 construction of a new tool shop which has infused
 new life to the smooth running of the factory. Many
 are the examples of creative ability  and  initiative
 on the part of the workers engaged in managing the
 enterprises.  Practical experience  shows  that  the
 transfer of factories to the workers has fostered the
 zeal, enthusiasm and the forces of the working class,
 although there still exists a certain amount of wan-
 dering, exploration and apprehension at the magni-
 tude and importance of the task.
 The 13th Plenum of Trade Unions, held in Bel-
 grade on November 15 and 16, discussed precisely
 the role facing the trade unions in the new conditions
 of Yugoslav practice, and how to assist th^ work-
 ing class to raise its cultural and professional level
 as rapidly as possible in order to meet the great tasks
 at hand and those that lie ahead.
 The Centrlal Cpmmityee of the Trade Unions,
 acting in conjunction with the Yugoslav Council for
 Science and Culture and the republican ministries
 of education, drafted and submitted to the Plenum
 a new schedule for the general education of work-
 ers. The proposed system would be put into effect
 in the form of a law. It envisages three grades  of
 general education of workers.
 A preparatory and educational courriculum would
 serve to familiarize workers with the basic elements
 of mathematics,  history, and geography of Federal
 People's Republic of Yugoslavia.
 A basic educational course would provide work-
 ers with a more solid knowledge of natural science,
 their native tongue,  geography  and history of the
 Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, and it would
 last nine to ten months.
 A school of general education would have a two-
 year curriculum, and would cover the subjects and
 enjoy the status of the lower high-school.
 The first two courses would be organized  and
 financed by trade union organizations, whereas the
 school of general education would be, sponsored by
 the state like any normal school in the educational
 system of the country.
 The Plenum   especially  insisted on elucidating
 the role of trade union organizations in conditions
 where  the  workers themselves manage  the  enter-
 prises and where they are gradually to take over the
 management of the entire economy. The trade union
 organizations are due to help the Workers' Councils
 and Managing Boards, and, which is. ,particularly
 vital, to engage in a full-scale cultural, educational
 and ideological-political drive  for  the enlightening
 of the working class.
 All these efforts aspire toward the assisting and
 accelerating of the revolutionary course of consist-
 ent application of the teachings of Marx and Engels
 in Yugoslav practice. It is understandable, therefore,
 why the Cominform circles and their followers in the
 Western countries should fear Yogoslav practice and
 have only words of abuse for it. On the other hand
 however, the efforts of Yugoslavia are meeting with
 true sympathies and interest of all the progressive
 peoples in the world, and primarily among workers.

 THROUGH THE  FOG OF PROPAGANDA
 EFFECT PRECEDES CAUSE BY FIVE MONTHS
 H ARD IS THE STRUGGLE being
 waged by the leadership of the
 World  Congress  for  Defense of
 Peace because its enemies are  Aso
 strubborn.
 In its long fight to show the
 world that, only the atom bomb is a
 danger to peace, and that the ex-
 pans'ionistic tendencies of the USSR
 serve the cause of peace, one of its
 powerful enemies has been the So-
 viet Government which caused an
 upheaval in Korea without use of
 the atom bomb, simply by its poli-
 tical moves. And in another s`ruggle
 which is b-i.ng waged parallel with
 the first, these unfortunate leaders
 have another equally hard-headed
 enemy - the chronology of events.
 The executives of the World Con-
 gress for Defense of Peace are on
 a war footing in a big way - with
 the calendar.
 Certain  episodes  from   this un-
 equal  struggle  are                      rather well-
 known. They are the ones connect-
 ed with the preparations for the
 Peace Congress in Sheffield that did
 not come off. Arrangements in va-
 rious  countries were                       made  for
 the  election of delegates  to this
 Congress    -  free  elections   of
 course.  Everything  in  connection
 with the  elections      was  going
 as   smoothly  as apple' pie    ex-
 cept for the fact that the calendar
 balked and would not allow itself,
 to be tamed down ,and put in order.
 And so it happened that the dele-
 gates in Austria were elected                      on
 October 21, while on October 5 the
 British Government already had in
 its hands, in the form of application
 for visas, the complete list of these
 delegates who were freely elected
 16 days later. In Hungary, the de-
 legates  were elected November 4,
 while 12 days earlier, on October
 23, the complete list of these dele-
 gates was already in London.   A
 commentator on the London radio
 was able to play the role of prophet
 on November 3 and inform his Hun-
 garian listeners the exact names of
 all 20 delegates who were to be
 elected on the morrow in the free
 elections.
 But, as we have said, these are
 well-known  episodes.  Less  well-
 known is the struggle with the ca-
 lendar which went on in connection
 with the expelling of Yugoslavia from
 the World Congress of Defenders of
 Peace. We learned about this from
 the reports on the press conference
 which the organizers of the Shef-
 field Congress held November 3 in
 London. At this conference, one of
 these organizers, named Ivor Mon-
 tague, answering the question as to
 why the Yugoslavs had been evict-
 ed from the "world movement for
 peace", gave the following answer
 in the desire to prove that it was
 not true  that the Yugoslavs  had
 been thrown out for the simple rea-
 son that such an order had come
 from the Soviet Union: "We expel-
 led the Yugoslavs because they are
 supporting the policy of their Go-
 vernment  which  is  persecuting
 those who signed the Stockholm
 Appeal in Yugoslavia."
 In this statement there are two
 things that are true, one that is
 untrue and ,one that is impossible.
 The true things are as follows: first,
 that the Yugoslavs support the po-
 licy of their Government and, se-
 cond, that the Yugoslavs were ex-
 pelled from the World Congress of
 Defenders of Peace because  they
 support the policy of their Govern-
 ment; it is untrue that there were
 any people in Yugoslavia who sign-
 ed the Stockholm Appeal; and it is
 impossible for the Yugoslav Govern-
 ment to persecute people who do
 not exist. And the whole thing adds
 up to a war with the calendar.
 The Yugoslavs were evicted from
 the World Congress of Defenders of
 Peace  because of their  negative
 stand  toward the  Stockholm Ap-
 peal - says the leadership of that
 Congress through one of its mem-
 bers, Ivor Montague. And here is
 what thecalendar says] the expulsion
 of Yugoslavia (the consequence  of
 its disagreement with- the Stock-
 holm Appeal) was carried out  on
 October 18, 1949, while the Stock-
 holm Appeal (that is, the proclama-
 tion that was the cause of the dis-
 agreement, and, therefore,  of      the
 expulsion of the  Yugoslavs) was
 adopted at the Congress in Stock-
 holm which was held from March
 15 to 19, 1950. That means, as the
 stubborn calendar bears witness, that
 the effect preceded the cause by a
 full five months.
 T HE SHEFFIELD CONGRESS, as
 we .know, was transformed into
 the Warsaw Congress. This was de-
 cided by the leadership of the World
 Congress of the Defenders of Peace,
 as a sign of protest because the Bri-
 tish Government did not issue entry
 visas to a large number of dele-
 gates.
 A storm of protest followed this
 act by the British Government. The
 most vehement in uttering their in-
 dignatian were the "defenders  of
 peace" in Prague. The whole Pra-
 gue press devoted columns and co-
 lumns of space to this case, brand-
 ing the "warfare by means of non-
 issuance of visas" as something ex-
 tremely uncivilized, unpacific and
 base.
 The  Indignation of the Prague
 Cominformists is a favorable sign.
 It shows  that there  has been  a
 change of mind in the last fourteen
 months, a change for the better. Be-
 cause the  following happened                                                                                              in
 Prague in September last year:
 The Executive Committee of the
 International Journalists' Organiza-
 tion was sitting in Prague at that
 time. The session was attended by
 delegates from many states, but not
 all of them. For instance, the Yu-
 goslav representative in `the Exe-
 cutive committee was not present
 - because the  Czechoslovak Go-
 vernment had not issued him  an
 entry visa. The Czechoslovak secre-
 tariat of the International Journal-
 ists' Organization  did not answer
 the telegram of .protest sent by the
 Yugoslav representative. When the

 'Approved For Release 2001/12/05 : CIA-RDP83-00415R006900120004-8
 Yugoslav Newspapermen's Associa-
 tion authorized one of its members
 residing in Prague to represent it
 at the session, he was forcibly pre-
 vented  from  entering the hall in
 which the session was being held.
 That is why the present stand of the
 Prague Cominformists on the ques-
 tion of issuance or non-issuance of
 visas gives rise to great hones. They
 are obviously progressing in their
 conceptions.  Fourteen months ago,
 there was not even one single voice
 of protest in all Czechoslovakia a-
 gainst                   the           "warfare by- means of
 nc n-issuance of visas" being waged
 by the Prague Government.   Today
 the whole Czechoslovak press   is
 thundering against a similar  war
 being  waged by another Govern-
 ment. Who  knows,  maybe in the
 fourteen coming months, on the oc-
 casion of some sort of international
 congress in Prague, even the Prague
 Government itself will  give  the
 world a pleasant surprise by issuing
 visas to all foreign delegates without
 exception?
 Y HE FIRST DAY OF THE CON-
 GRESS IN WARSAW is also a
 source of new hope. Judging from
 the address delivered on that day
 by the President of the World Con-
 gress  of  Defenders of Peace, Mr.
 Joliot-Curie, the leadership of that
 organization is following the same
 course taken by  the Czechoslovak
 public: the  course  of  correcting
 their viewpoint on certain matters.
 I am thinking here not only of
 the condemnation of "warfare by
 means of non-issuance of visas". This
 matter is much more serious than
 that and much more far-reach'ng.
 The point is that the stand of the,
 World Congress of hake Defenders
 of Peace seems - to be changing fun-
 damentally  on  various  questions.
 Certain alterations (or rather ad-
 d(itions) were already hinted  at:
 after  the speeches by Tihonov,
 Ehreniburg, and other Soviet mem-
 bers of the leadership of the Peace
 Movement, in which they condemn-
 ed all aggression and war propagan-
 da, it was clear that the non-Soviet
 members of that leadership   had
 adopted their opinion. But there are
 bold  changes in that stand which
 we  did  not  expect.  Two of the
 changes are so bold that it is still
 not clear to us if they are the fruit
 of extensive consultation or if Joliet-
 Curie announced them on his own
 carelesly trespassing  over   the
 boundaries  set up  by the Comin-
 formists for development of                                                                  (the
 struggle for their kind of "peace".
 First of all, Mr. Joliot-Curie stated
 on b: half of the whole organization:
 "We have no intention of imposing
 a government of our choice on any
 country." This statement is sensa-
 tional, because if the World Con-
 gress for Peace were to adopt the
 viewpoint of its President, it would
 be passing sentence on the policy of
 the Cominform which has been di-
 recting the main part of its activi-
 ties for the last two years toward
 the provocatitrn of a coup d'etat in
 one countr  ;- Yugoslavia, toward
 changing its 'leadership and impos-
 ing an it some government of its
 own choice.
 The     second statement  made b3
 Mr. Joliot-Curie was  equally sen-
 sa?tional: he said that the Congress
 vgould condemn all economic dis.
 crimination. If  the  Congress con-
 demne-s, all such discrimination, it
 will also thereby condemn that to-
 tal, almost hermetically-sealed block-
 ade which the Comi.nforrn countries
 have been   applying to Yugoslavia
 for over two years.
 If  these two things  :should  be
 condemned, that would    mean that
 the World Congress of the Defend-
 ers of Peace had emancipaled itself
 from service to the policy of one
 power, the Soviet Union, and that
 it had really begun to serve peace.
 Hopes are fine things. But  the
 Warsaw Congress has still not drawn
 to a close. And we know that the
 first day of all these congresses of
 "peace" -- is a day of words. The
 deeds come later. So far, they have
 differed from the words. Dare we
 now  believe  that  such  positive
 changes have already taken place
 within the World Congress of the
 Defenders of Peace that the Con-
 gress,. realizing the two fine pro-
 mises of its (President,  will even
 reject  the  foundations of Comin-
 form policy:  discrepancy between
 words and deeds?
 LBANIAN ECONOMIC POLI-
 A CY, according to the Warsaw
 radio,  is  achieving great results.
 The prosperity of the Albanian peo-
 ple                                                                                             is  rising",  broadcasts  Radio
 Warsaw.
 After this, one might expect such
 an assertion to be followed by sta-
 tistics chowing  that the                                                                                                  Albanian
 people are living better, eating bet-
 ter and dressing better. But no such
 data are given by the Radio War-
 saw reporter. He does give some fi-
 gures, true enough, but these figures
 refer to something else. "In compar-
 ison with 1945", he says, "there is
 4 times more oil being produced, 5
 times more coal, 11 times more bi-
 tumen, considerably more cement..."
 and there the tale ends.
 The figures are fine. But they only
 show that - Albanian exports to
 the Soviet Union are growing. These
 augmented exports  do, admittedly,
 contribute to someone's prosperity -
 but that someone is in the USSR.
 Perhaps there is someone here and
 there in Albania getting more pros-
 perous, too. But - what is the re-
 lationship between the growth of
 exports and the growth of the pros-
 perity of the Albanian  p e o p l e ?
 The Radio Warsaw reporter probab-
 ly knows. But precisely because he
 does know, he would rather omit
 the figures on the increase of the
 people's prosperity and restrict his
 comments to the figures on the in-
 crease of - production for the needs
 of the "leading state."
