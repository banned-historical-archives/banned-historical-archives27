 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- HOUSE             June 6, 1966
 portion of the savings is being channeled di-
 rectly from the saver to the borrower through
 the capital markets rather than through fi-
 nancial intermediaries.
 Since the mid-1950's, commercial banks
 have been filling an increasing proportion of
 the nation's credit requirements, after hav-
 ing lagged behind other savings institutions
 in the immediate postwar period.  However,
 so far this year, commercial banks have met
 only about one-fourth of the nation's financ-
 ing needs compared to 40 percent in 1965.
 Indeed, the major savings institutions have
 had to compete for a less rapidly growing sav-
 ings pie.  Adapting to a slower rate of sav-
 ings inflow is not an easy task, particularly
 if operations have been geared to a large
 continuing inflow.
 The adjustment process, however, has been
 eased by a concomitant slowdown in demand
 in certain sectors of the economy and by the
 restraining effects of a tighter monetary pol-
 icy.  This is an opportunity to strengthen
 portfolios, to reassess short- and long-run
 factors, and to match activity more closely
 to supply and demand factors currently op-
 erative in the market.  For financial insti-
 tutions such as savings banks and savings
 and loan associations the adjustment proc-
 ess is slow because of the long-term nature
 of their investments. Liquidity needs and
 commitment policies may have to be reevalu-
 ated in light of the future prospects for
 housing and construction and for savings.
 This reevaluation process is equally bene-
 ficial for our commercial lending institutions.
 The role of the large negotiable time certifi-
 cate of deposit-and, more recently, the re-
 lated small-denomination  savings  instru-
 ments-might be usefully reexamined by
 every bank to determine whether undue de-
 pendence is being placed on these instru-
 ments for deposit growth and whether li-
 quidity  requirements  might   need  to  be
 strengthened for these deposits.  The com-
 petition for these interest-sensitive funds,
 moreover,  has become so intense that it
 might be questioned whether there is any
 net gain to the bank in deposit volume or
 only higher interest costs. The banking sys-
 tem as a whole may be only stimulating more
 frequent shifting of funds or an upward
 ratcheting of the rate structure rather than
 attracting additional savings.
 Higher interest costs in turn have placed
 pressure on bank profit margins.  Over the
 longer run, profitability is a major determi-
 nant of the types of activities in which a
 bank engages.  Attention may be focused
 on growth in the very short-run but only at
 a bank's peril can it ignore profit considera-
 tions over the long run.
 Similar considerations are relevant in a
 bank's  lending operations.   The  present
 strong upward pressures on the nation's re-
 sources call for restraint on the part of both
 lenders and borrowers.
 The financial sector now has reached an
 especially  significant' milepost-from this
 point forward a high degree of statesman-
 ship,  responsibility,  imagination  and re-
 straint is required.      We have reached the
 point where adjustments must be made to
 circumstances that have evolved gradually-
 over the whole postwar period in some cases
 and during the present economic expansion
 in others. Operations cannot be blindly pre-
 dicated on continuation of the previous high
 rates of growth in savings inflow or in the
 demands for credit.
 All of our'major financial institutions have
 responded well to the challenge of directing
 the nation's savings into productive use and
 of meeting the nation's credit needs.  But as
 savings flows decline or as particular credit
 needs are satisfied, it is equally the responsi-
 bility of our banks and savings institutions
 to adjust to the changed situation.    Adjust-
 ment to a slower growth rate or to shifting
 demands in the economy is a much more
 difficult  assignment, than  adjustment  to
 rapid expansion, but it is an assignment
 whose successful completion is essential to
 the fundamental health of our financial
 system.
 The past six months have emphasized
 another facet of our financial mechanism-
 the essential interrelationship  of all our
 financial markets.  The increase in the Fed-
 eral Reserve discount rate and in the interest
 rate 'ceilings last December was designed to
 impose a measure of monetary restraint on
 the burgeoning economy and at the same
 time give banks somewhat greater flexibility
 in attracting deposits to accommodate strong
 loan demands.  By raising the ceiling to 51/2
 percent, however, a 11/12  percent differential
 was opened up between the rate paid on pass-
 book savings accounts and the rate on other
 time deposits. Although rates were not ex-
 pected to move to the ceiling, they in fact
 rose rapidly as banks competed for funds.
 The size of the differential provided a very
 strong inducement for banks to develop new
 instruments to attract funds.
 Banks have responded since December to
 the higher permissible rate structure with
 innovations in the types of deposit facilities
 offered to the saver, such as savings or invest-
 ment certificates and savings bonds.  Both
 the Federal Reserve and the FDIC are cur-
 rently conducting surveys of banks under
 their supervision to  find  out more about
 these new savings  instruments  and how
 savers have reacted to them.   From these
 surveys we hope to obtain a better insight
 into bank responses to changes in interest
 rate ceilings.
 A second result of the December increase
 was  an acceleration in the movement of
 funds between different types of deposits, be-
 tween banks, and also between different types
 of  financial  institutions.  The  success  of
 banks in attracting a larger proportion of
 new savings has had a dampening effect on
 other savings institutions.   To a yet unde-
 termined extent, moreover, banks may have
 drawn interest-sensitive funds out of these
 financial   hn*mediaries-although   other
 competitive  investment  outlets doubtless
 contributed to the slower growth in savings
 at  these   nonbank  financial institutions.
 Within  the. banking   system, in addition,
 larger  banks found themselves competing
 against smaller banks.
 These interactions resulting from action
 in one sector illustrate the close interrela-
 tionship of financial institutions in today's
 markets and demonstrate the difficulties of
 foretelling with accuracy financial responses
 in a financial market as complex  as  ours.
 The practically impossible task of separat-
 ing and isolating one sector of the financial
 markets from another suggests strongly that,
 to the extent that regulation and super-
 vision are needed, they should be applicable
 to all sectors of the market.
 The ability of banks to compete success-
 fully today against specialized thrift insti-
 tutions is  attributable largely to the fact
 that banks are multi-purpose institutions.
 Through their broader investment opportu-
 nities and their ability to provide a wise
 variety of financial services, banks are in a
 relatively strong  position  to  attract  cus-
 tomers.  The advantage that banks hold over
 other financial intermediaries thus cannot
 be eliminated simply by rate equality.    This
 conclusion leads in turn to the very inter-
 esting question of the future of special-
 purpose institutions.
 The development of the future could very
 well be the evolution of single-purpose insti-
 tutions toward a multi-purpose operation as
 financial markets become increasingly inte-
 grated.  The constantly growing and diversi-
 fied credit needs of our economy may push
 u& steadily toward this concept of "one-
 stop" banking.  From a financial system with
 savings institutions at one end of the spec-
 trum and commercial banks at the other,
 we may see a "merging toward the center"
 as our financial institutions adjust to chang-
 ing circumstances.  In the process we may
 also achieve a more efficient allocation of our
 financial resources without the sacrifice of
 private initiative and enterprise.
 As recent experience amply demonstrates,
 our financial structure is constantly chang-
 ing and adapting.  New patterns in the flow
 of savings have emerged and new techniques
 are in use.  Problems have arisen as a con-
 sequence of these recent developments.  It is
 the  responsibility, however,  of the super-
 visory authorities to facilitate the necessary
 adjustments during transition periods with
 as little friction and disturbance to the mar-
 ket                                                                                                                                 as  possible. Whatever  actions  are
 taken-whether affecting rates, instruments,
 or even institutions-should be taken with
 caution because of possible unforeseen and
 unfortunate repercussions.  The geographi-
 cal diversity of our nation heightens this
 possibility.  Serious imbalances or .prolonga-
 tion of the adjustment period also could
 result from an incorrect course of action.
 The impact of any particular action, more-
 over, could vary with the circumstances in
 which it is undertaken.  Consequently, the
 supervisory  authorities must  be  accorded
 maximum flexibility in this area to tailor
 their  actions  to  the  particular situation.
 Packaged prescriptions might well be unsuit-
 able-and also highly inflexible.
 The lack of a neatly packaged solution
 should not be equated with inability to find
 a solution. In many cases, an approach more
 easily adapted to particular circumstances
 or selective in its impact may be preferable.
 Although  our  financial  institutions  are
 generally strong,  there  are  always a   few
 trouble spots.  It is for this reason that the
 Corporation is currently strongly supporting
 the proposed legislation for cease-and-desist
 authority against unsafe and unsound prac-
 tices of banks and savings and loan associa-
 tions and for authority to remove directors
 or officers of institutions whose actions may
 weaken the portion of the institution, its.
 depositors, or shareholders.  The bill now
 pending in  Congress would reinforce and
 widen the range of existing remedies for
 correcting unlawful, unsound, or irregular
 practices that are unfortunately still found
 from time to time.  It permits the super-
 visory authorities to take action quickly and
 effectively short of more drastic action such
 as a takeover or termination of deposit in-
 surance,  which  are                                                                                                                                         the  alternatives  now
 available to us. The bill also provides pro-
 tection of the rights of any institution, its
 officers, directors, and others involved.
 In  closing, I  would  like  to  summarize
 briefly what we are learning from the dia-
 logue  in the                                                                                                                                     finincial  community    today.
 First, adaptability and flexibility of all our
 financial institutions to changing circum-
 stances-whether on the supply aide or on
 the demand side-are essential for the con-
 tinued strength of our financial system.                                                                                                                                     Sec-
 ondly, any action affecting one sector of our
 financial markets has an impact on all other
 sectors;  our  financial  markets  cannot be
 compartmentalized.        Thirdly,  the complex
 ties between all sectors of the financial mar-
 kets argue for across-the-board regulation, if
 regulation is needed.     Fourthly, the advan-
 tage that a multi-purpose financial insti-
 tution has over a single-purpose institution
 tends to lead us to the conclusion that a
 greater diversification of powers within an
 institution may be the development of the
 future.  Finally, the supervisory authorities
 must remain alert to these developments and
 be prepared to aid the adjustment process.
 It is an Important responsibility that we do
 n9t take lightly.

 densely populated sector of Indochina
 while Laos is the largest least populated
 country in the area and has the least
 capacity to defend itself." Laos is deeply
 divided, ethnically and politically. Com-
 munist forces now control about one-
 half of Laos.
 Cambodia is also sparsely populated
 and is in a vulnerable strategic position.
 To use her main waterway to the sea, it
 is necessary to pass through South Viet-
 nam on the Mekong River. The Mekong
 Delta is open to attack from routes which
 can be commanded from Noth Vietnam
 and Laos.  Thus, it Is' essential to the
 security of Cambodia that South Viet-
 nam and Laos are in friendly hands.
 If Indochina fell to the Communists,
 it is quite possible that Thailand would
 divorce herself from Western defense
 arrangements and try to reach an accom-
 modation  with  China.   Historically,
 Thailand has adopted this flexible posi-
 tion of being willing to cooperate with
 the region's dominant power, whether
 that should be Great Britain, France,
 Japan, the United States, or China. This
 stance would be forced upon Thailand
 because of her strategic vulnerability.
 The bulk of the Lao people live in Thai-
 land, which has much reason to fear a
 Vietnamese-Lao combination.  The in-
 stability of northeast Thailand is fur-
 ther increased by the presence of 50,000
 to 80,000 pro-Communist refugees from
 Vietnam who have settled there since
 World War II.  It is clear that China
 has designs on Thailand, for the Chinese
 have designated Thailand as the next
 area ripe for a war of national libera-
 tion, and have even established a free
 Tfiai movement from the Thai ethnic
 groups living in southern China.
 Burma, already beset by rebellious fac-
 tions, would be another prime target.
 Rebel groups continue to operate in
 northern Malaya.  Singapore has often
 been described as a hotbed of Commu-
 nist activity.  Indonesia is beset by in-
 ternal difficulties and has great prob-
 lems in maintaining the allegiapee of
 her outer islands. There is a strong in-
 surrectionist movement on one of the
 Philippines' main islands of Mindanao.
 Thus, the removal of U.S. power could
 bring on a wider war as China and North
 Vietnam attempted to dominate the re-
 gion. A threat to Burma would involve
 the vital interests of India, for World
 War II demonstrated that the country
 in control of Burma can easily launch
 attacks on India.  World War II also
 showed that the security of Australia
 and New Zealand depends upon a stable
 situation in southeast Asia.  Britain is
 pledged to defend Malaysia and could
 become drawn into a wider struggle.
 In addition, American disengagement
 would cause friends and enemies alike
 to question seriously the credibility of
 any U.S. military deterrent.
 CHINA'S INTENTIONS
 These, then, are the stakes involved
 in  defending  South  Vietnam-trade
 routes, economic resources, the dangers
 of a Vietnam united under the Commu-
 nists, the weakensses of the surrounding
 states, the need for a credible deterrent
 against China, and the dangers of a wider
 war. But there are still those who argue
 that China has only peaceful intentions
 in the region and would not try to im-
 pose economic or political control.  But
 this does not explain why China supplies
 the so-called wars of national liberation,
 or why she has formed the free Thai in-
 surrectionary movement.
 It is very difficult to assess the inten-
 tions of a rising power because each gain
 brings  new  objectives within reach.
 Thus, although China may have peaceful
 intentions now, an American withdrawal
 could change those  intentions. Cer-
 tainly,                                                          the  experiences  of  Germany
 should 'bring second thoughts to the
 minds of those who disclaim the aggres-
 sive intentions of a rising power, with
 the belief that she is entitled to be the
 regional leader, in the midst of a number
 of weaker states.
 Of course, the only certain way to
 determine China's intentions would be
 to withdraw, but this course is fraught
 with too many dangers. It would be too
 easy for China to invade the area and
 present the world with a fait accompli in
 a short period of time. And World War
 II demonstrated that it is extremely dif-
 ficult to dislodge an, Invading force from
 the area once it has become entrenched,
 even with superiority in firepower and
 control of air and water.
 Through economic development and
 peaceful change, the United States hopes
 to see eventually a number of progres-
 sive, independent, and viable states in
 southeast Asia, able to stand on their
 own feet. 'Is this possible?  It is, ac-
 cording to the examples in Greece, Ma-
 laya, the Philippines, and South Korea,
 where Communist revolutionary move-
 ments, supported from outside, were
 finally  defeated.  Today, the United
 States and her allies are thankful that
 decisions were made to stand firm in
 these former areas, even though the out-
 look was often bleak.  These examples
 lend added support to the view that
 the defense of South Vietnam is worth
 the effort. The United States should not
 reconcile herself to being condemned by
 history as the country which allowed the
 200 million people and vast natural re-
 sources of' southeast Asia to be con-
 trolled by powers which have pledged
 themselves to our destruction.
 International  politics  usually  con-
 front a state with opportunities not to
 do the greatest good, but to do the least
 evil. It is better to limit the war to Viet-
 nam now than to court the incalculable
 dangers that would stem from a wider
 war.
 ADDRESS BY HON. K. A. RANDALL
 (Mr. ASHLEY (at the request of Mr.
 CALLAN) was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. ASHLEY. Mr. Speaker, all of us
 are aware of the restrictions of credit
 which have generated recent intensifica-
 tion of competition among financial in-
 stitutions for savings. Because this is a
 topic of very real  importance  and
 priority consideration, I am pleased to
 insert in the RECORD the following re-
 marks of Mr. K. A. Randall, Chairman,
 rederal Deposit Insurance corporation,

 at the annual convention of the Ameri-
 can Institute of Banking at San Diego,
 Calif., on June 3,1966:
 REMARKS BY X. A. RANDALL, CHAIRMAN, FED-
 ERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION, BE-
 FORE  THE  ANNUAL  CONVENTION  OF  THE
 AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF BANKING AT SAN
 DIEGO, CALIF., ON JUNE 3, 1966
 Last month, the House Banking and Cur-
 rency Committee opened hearings on two
 bills designed to impose restrictions on com-
 mercial bank time deposits-one prohibits
 the issuance of certificates of deposit and
 other bank obligations and the other bars
 banks  from  accepting  time  deposits  in
 amounts less than $15,000. In the course of
 the hearings, additional proposals were ad-
 vanced to place a uniform interest rate on
 all types of time and savings deposits and
 borrowings of banks and to permit higher
 rate ceilings on large deposits.
 These proposals have been generated by
 the recent  intensification of competition
 among  financial  institutions for savings,
 coupled with continued high levels of eco-
 nomic activity.  It is not my intention today,
 however,  to  comment  directly  on  these
 specific proposals.   I want to concentrate
 instead of some of the major issues and
 problems that have been illuminated by the
 proposed legislation and the current situa-
 tion in the financial markets.                                                                                                                                 These are the
 issues and problems that will be with us
 in the years to come-in one form or an-
 other.   An understanding of their nature
 and their implications is therefore essential.
 I am particularly pleased to be able to
 speak to an audience such as this today be-
 cause you are the ones who, in the future,
 will have to face and solve problems similar
 to those posed by the current vigorous com-
 petition for savings.  Most of the managerial
 talent  for  the  banking industry  will  be
 drawn from your ranks.  Your ability and
 resourcefulness in coping with the problems
 of the future will be a crucial factor in pre-
 serving the strength and viability of our
 financial institutions.
 The current economic situation is charac-
 terized                                                                                                                             by high and still rising levels of
 economic activity, close to full employment
 of our plant and manpower resources, and
 strong upward pressures on interest rates
 and on the demand for credit.  Our inter-
 national commitments at the same time in-
 ject an element of uncertainty into the eco-
 nomic outlook.  The financial markets re-
 flect the interaction of all these forces, which
 may be intensified this month  by record
 corporate tax payments due at mid-month
 and by expectations of the savings and loan
 industry that withdrawals from share ac-
 counts after the dividend payment period
 at the end of the month may exceed the
 inflow of new savings.
 Although pressures in the financial mark-
 ets may                                                                                                                                 be  severe  this  month,  generally
 speaking the major segments of the financial
 community-the commercial banks, the sav-
 ings banks, and the savings and loan asaocia-
 tions-are strong and well able to withstand
 these short-run pressures. Furthermore, you
 may be confident that the various super-
 visory authorities are also prepared to pro-
 vide whatever assistance that may be neces-
 sary with every means at their disposal.
 The present conjuncture of circumstances,
 nevertheless,  provides  several  good  illus-
 trations of problems we may expect in the
 future.  One of the major factors in the cur-
 rent  situation  is  the                                                                                                                                  strong   competition
 among financial institutions for funds to
 meet the demand for business financing, for
 consumer credit, and for mortgage financing.
 This competition is taking place against a
 relative shrinkage in the volume of new sav-
 ings.                                                                                                                             In the first quarter of this year, for
 example, saving as a percent of disposable
 personal income totaled only 5.0 percent
 compared to 5.6 percent in the last quarter
 of 1965.  At the same time, a larger pro-

 preciative of the efforts which the gen-
 tleman from Missouri [Mr. JONES] and
 the gentleman from Texas [Mr. POAGE]
 put forth to portray the potential and
 the attitude of our country in fields re-
 lated to the economic life of the world
 and our international responsibilities.
 They are very vigorous efforts which
 commanded the respect of those in at-
 tendance.
 Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank
 the gentleman from Missouri again for
 his very. kind remarks.
 Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. PIRNIE.  I am happy to yield to
 the gentleman.
 Mr. McCLORY.  Mr. Speaker, I want
 to add my commendation for the very
 expert job that the gentleman from New
 York performed as chairman of our U.S.
 delegation to the Interparliamentary
 Union Conference in Canberra.
 As we know, the spring conference of
 the IPU is intended primarily as a pre-
 paratory meeting for the fall or plenary
 session of this organization. Yet, we did
 find that there were a number of issues
 that had to be decided at this spring
 meeting.
 The delegation it seemed to me to a
 man performed its work most capably.
 I think it should be brought out to the
 Members of the House that there is a
 great deal of preparatory work prior to
 this Conference and we are fortunate to
 have the assistance of the distinguished
 executive secretary of our organization,
 Dr. George Galloway and of the staff of
 the Library of Congress and other aids
 that we are able to receive from the De-
 partment of State and elsewhere so as to
 better equip ourselves to contend with
 the problems that we encounter at these
 international meetings.
 It seems to me quite definitely as other
 Members have said that we dealt effect-
 tively with the various Issues and, the
 various problems that we encountered
 and saw to it that they were resolved
 favorably to our Nation.
 Again I wish to stress to all the Mem-
 bers of the House that I cannot help but
 feel that there should be a greater under-
 standing of the benefits that are derived
 from our participation in these Inter-
 parliamentary Union meetings as emis-
 saries of our Nation and as representa-
 tives of our U.S. Congress. These meet-
 ings with parliamentarians from the
 other countries, provide an excellent op-
 portunity for promoting good interna-
 tional  relations  and  sound  public
 relations for our country. I believe this
 opportunity is used in a most effective
 way..
 I have sensed in the course of my
 brief experience as a delegate to the
 Interparliamentary  Union  Conference
 the development of warm and friendly
 attitudes on the part of a number of
 other delegates as a result of contacts
 that we have individually made and as
 a result of working together with the
 parliamentarians from other countries.
 This strikes me as being of extreme
 significance.

 from the base, one or two days of fighting
 at the scene of his regiment's operation, and
 two or three night marches back to his reg-
 imental main-base area-that was about
 the maximum effort that was normally re-
 quired each month.  The balance of every
 month was spent resting, training, absorb-
 ing replacements and doing meticulous sand-
 table exercises to prepare the next sally
 against a government post.  And all these
 weeks between operations were passed in the
 absolute security of a main base, with its
 simple but comfortable barracks, its reas-
 suring fortifications, and its food caches.
 Today, however, this quite bearable exist-
 ence has suffered a savage transformation.
 It began when Gen. Westmoreland called in
 the B-52's of the Strategic Air Command,
 with their immense loads of heavy bombs
 that can penetrate even fortification tun-
 nels 30 feet below ground.  Daily since late
 last summer, the B-52's have been hammer-
 ing the main-base areas, with such effect, as
 captured documents have revealed, that the
 main-force regiments are now under strict
 orders to-spend no more than one night, or
 at most two nights, in the same place.  Long
 gone, therefore, are each month's restorative
 stretches of orderly barracks life.
 Night after night, the main-force soldiers
 must bivouac in the jungle or on the moun-
 tain slopes.  Every day or every two days
 there is a toilsome march to the next biv-
 ouac.  These movements cause supply prob-
 lems, and the men sometimes go hungry.
 There is little time for rest or training, or
 any of the other things that keep and out-
 fit happy and in combat trim.  In addition,
 as the American forces in Vietnam have
 grown stronger, there have been more in-
 fantry sweeps through the main-base areas-
 many of which had not been visited by hos-
 tile troops since the beginning of the French
 war.  Supply caches that took months, even
 years, to accumulate are found and destroyed
 by  our  men.   Fortifications  representing
 hundreds of thousands, even millions,     of
 man-hours of hard work are discovered and
 greatly damaged, if not always totally de-
 stroyed.                    V.C. outfits that have sought the
 base areas' security must either flee or stand
 and fight against hard odds.  In these ways
 still  another  cardinal Mao-Giap rule has
 been broken-the rule that a successful guer-
 rilla                  movement  needs  completely  secure
 bases. Without this minimal security, Mao
 says, any such movement must automatically
 "deteriorate" into a mere "peasant revolt"
 which  "it would be fanciful to suppose"
 could "avoid defeat."
 From the foregoing follows the final pro-
 found                  change  in  the  V.C.  situation.  In
 Vietnam the intelligence gathered has al-
 ways been substantial, but the South Viet-
 namese formerly had no way to process in-
 telligence as it came in, much less to respond
 to it promptly.  Nowadays, in contrast, the
 intelligence gathered has multiplied many
 times over, partly by freer reporting by the
 people of the countryside, partly by mechan-
 ical means such as airborne infrared devices
 that spot main-force campfires and the like,
 and partly by the enormously increased nuin-
 bers of deserters and prisoners of war.  Fur-
 thermore Gen. Westmoreland's headquarters
 has now set up something like a Vietnamese-
 American   intelligence-processing       factory,
 capable of handling several tons of captured
 documents and several hundreds of interro-
 gations in a single  week.  Thus it is no
 longer a case of blind men fighting men who
 see all too well, as it was for so many years.
 The new 'Oyes of the intelligence can even
 penetrate main-base areas well enough so
 that each B-52 strike has proved to have an
 even chance of finding its pinpoint target of
 barracks and fortifications within the huge
 surrounding tract of swamp or jungle or
 mountain forest.  Movements of Viet Cong
 units are also being swiftly tracked if luck
 is good and the movements are fairly big.
 Sometimes we have no luck, as with the re-
 cent attack near Saigon.  Yet good intelli-
 gence enabled Gen, Westmoreland to mount
 no fewer than eight uniformly successful
 spoiling operations against long planned V.C.
 attacks in a recent period of only a few
 weeks.  Thus another crucial rule is being
 broken pretty frequently, for both Mao and
 Giap lay great emphasis on all guerrillas'
 need  to  move  absolutely  unseen,  while
 watching the  smallest  enemy    movement.
 Inasmuch as such texts as Mao Tse-tung's
 On the Protracted War and Vo Nguyen Giap's
 People's War, People's Army have always had
 the standing of scripture for both the Viet
 Cong and the North Vietnamese, the Mao-
 Giap prescriptions' rather monotonous fail-
 ure to work nowadays must be a very shaking
 thing in itself.  The Viet Cong soldiers must
 be greatly shaken too by the failure of their
 leaders to find substitute prescriptions that
 work a bit better.  Nowadays a Viet Cong
 battalion commander getting his orders for
 another surprise attack-plus-ambush must
 have the same sinking feeling that the gov-
 ernment's province chiefs always used to
 have when word came in of another pre-
 dawn assault on an isolated post.  For the
 long pull, an unending diet of many big and
 little defeats, with only the rarest success to
 raise the spirits, can in itself prove fatal to
 the  Viet  Cong.  The  strain  of  declining
 morale 1s already grave, as prisoner interro-
 gations reveal, and this strain is bound to in-
 crease if Gen. Westmoreland is allowed to
 pursue his strategy.
 These are the principal factors that con-
 trol the present pattern of the fighting in
 Vietnam.  I would be less confident of their
 great significance if I had not closely watch-
 ed the trend of the fighting.  When I visited
 Vietnam in the spring of 1965, one could
 easily discern American air power's effects on
 the Viet Cong.  But it was equally easy to
 see that air power alone was not enough, and
 that the V.C. would win during the sum-
 mer if the President did not commit U.S.
 ground troops.
 When I visited Vietnam again last Septem-
 ber, the full impact of the initial U.S. troop
 commitment was really beginning to be felt.
 The fine Marine victory at Chulai had taught
 the Viet Cong that Americans were not "pa-
 per tigers" after all-at any rate, not on the
 field of battle.  The first B-52 raids on the
 main bases were beginning to show impres-
 sive results.  It was already clear that the
 tide had turned, but it was by no means
 clear as yet how the Viet Cong and their
 masters in Hanoi would deal with this alarm-
 ing change.
 On this key point there was some disver-
 gence between Gen. Westmoreland and the
 majority of his staff.  Westmoreland already
 suspected that the President had achieved an
 unintended ambush, and he therefore doubt-
 ed whether the Viet Cong were free to follow
 Mao's rules of "advance and retreat."  His
 staff members were almost unanimous in ex-
 ?pecting the Viet Cong to follow the rules.
 This was a disturbing prospect, for a return
 to classical guerrilla fighting was bound to
 mean American troops endlessly marching
 through jungle and over mountains in fre-
 quently vain pursuit of mere companies of
 the  enemy.   Westmoreland's  staff  asked
 "whether the people at home would stand for
 an endless penny-packet war." If there was
 any way at all to exhaust American patience
 and fortitude, endless penny-packet war was
 surely the most likely way.
 These worries were shown to be ill-founded
 in October, in the obstinate battle for the
 Pleime Special Forces post, and in the subse-
 quent fighting in the la Drang valley, which
 continued into early November.  For days on
 end, with superb courage and endurance, a
 small band of men of the Special Forces,
 both American and Vietnamese, took on and
 hurled back a greatly superior number of
 troops of the V.C. main forces.  When the
 Pleime outpost had been relieved at last, the
 scene shifted to the Ia Drang valley.  Here
 the men of the 1st Air Cavalry engaged an
 entire North Vietnamese division, composed
 of the 32nd regiment, the 33rd regiment, and
 the  66th regiment,  with  two V.C.   main-
 force regiments in occasional support.                                                                                                                                  Even
 by mid-October the number of American
 combat troops on the ground was not large,
 and Maj. Gen. Harry Kinnard, commander
 of the lst Air Cavalry, could not afford to
 overcommit his  vital  division.  Hence  he
 never put into the line more than two bat-
 talions-plus, the battalions in combat being
 rotated by helicopter as the fighting went
 on.  On our side, therefore, we did not have
 as much as a full regiment engaged at any
 one time; whereas the enemy had three regi-
 ments always engaged, with two more to aid
 them.
 As must happen, alas, in battle, 275 men
 of the Air Cavalry were killed in the weeks
 the action lasted.  But we have since cap-
 tured the enemy's complete battle plans, and
 we also have a post-battle critique by the
 North Vietnamese commander on the scene,
 who has the pseudonym of Gen. Bai Quan.
 This evidence reveals that in this single bat-
 tle the enemy lost the staggering total of
 5,000 killed and severely wounded, as well as
 almost all his heavy weapons.  By any test
 this victory against such odds was a shining
 feat of U.S. arms, all the more noteworthy be-
 cause these were near-green American troops,
 After the Is, Drang valley no one could any
 longer believe in an intended Viet Cong pull-
 back to low-level guerrilla activity.  If the
 V.C. could not or would not pull back, it was
 clear that they would have to try to go for-
 ward.  Furthermore,  there  was  increasing
 evidence of a massive, continuing invasion of
 South Vietnam by North Vietnamese regu-
 lars coming down the Ho Chi Minh trail.
 Reconnaissance also revealed that the North
 Vietnamese  were urgently improving the
 trail to make it a truckable highway.
 In November, therefore, Hanoi's apparent
 intention to reinforce the Viet Cong to the
 utmost led Gen. Westmoreland's staff to make
 carefully revised estimates of the enemy's
 maximum capabilities-the maximum mili-
 tary buildup the North Vietnamese govern-
 nient and the V.C. second government could
 achieve and support.  These estimates pro-
 jected a continuous growth of the enemy
 main forces in South Vietnam at the rate of
 two regiments per month until the end of
 1966.  In other words, the main forces, which
 had a strength equivalent to 10 divisions
 when the President committed U. S. troops,
 were projected to grow to a strength equi-
 valent to about 18 divisions before next New
 Year's Day.
 This projection by Gen. Westmoreland's
 staff was presented to Secretary of Defense
 McNamara when he visited Saigon at the end
 of November.  It of course implied a need for
 a good many more American troops to match
 the enemey's expected increase of strength.
 For this reason the new estimates caused a
 panic in Washington when Secretary Mc-
 Namara brought them home.   Out of the
 panic grew the President's peace offensive,
 the pause in the bombing of the North, and
 other manifestations that presumably helped
 to renew the Hanoi leaders' slumping faith in
 their basic theory of American weakness of
 will.   The question remains  whether  the
 panic was justified.  I think it was wholly
 unjustified.
 My chief reason is based on the situation
 I discovered when I returned to Vietnam for
 my most recent visit in February.  On the
 one hand, all was far from perfection on our
 side.  The stability of the South Vietnamese
 government could certainly not be taken for
 granted.  And the President's hesitant and
 intricate methods of war-making, combined
 with the manifestoes of the war's senatorial
 and other cities, had deprived our men of the

 absolute confidence in their support at home
 that American troops in combat always ought
 ideally to have. On the other hand, however,
 these imperfections, though serious enough,
 were powerfully counterbalanced by the sit-
 uation of the Viet Cong.
 The refugee flow from the V.C. areas was
 increasing; by the end of February the total
 was nearing 800,000 men, women and chil-
 dren, or close to one sixth of the population
 that the V.C. had controlled at their high
 point.  Viet Cong propaganda was already
 publicly denouncing the refugee movement
 as an Imperialist plot to diminish the rice
 supplies available to the second government's
 tax collectors,  There were symptoms that
 the V.C. second government's available pool
 of conscripts had already begun to dry up in
 more than one province.  In Gen. Westmore-
 land's highly successful Masher-White Wing
 operation, the two prime-target regiments,
 the 18th of the North Vietnamese 325th divi-
 sion and the 2nd V.C. main-force regiment,
 had come south into Bindinh province With
 the primary intention of taking the offen-
 sive-Instead they were so badly knocked
 about that they were put out of action for
 several months.  But P.O.W. interrogations
 revealed that these regiments' southward
 move from Quangngai province had the sec-
 ondary purpose of securing badly needed re-
 placements, since the press gangs had been
 coming back almost empty-handed.
 When I went down to the delta town of
 My Tho, I discovered the sad plight of the
 most famous V.C. provincial battalion in
 Vietnam, called by Hanoi radio the "Ever
 Victorious Ap Bac Battalion" in memory of
 a smashing success in the past.  The "Ever
 Victorious" had just suffered two drubbings
 within two months by the local South Viet-
 namese  troops.   Furthermore-and  much
 more revealing the battalion was now af-
 flicted, according to a large number of de-
 fectors, with a desertion rate well above 60
 percent per year.  Each province in Viet-
 nam is markedly different from the next
 province, and symptoms in Quangngai and in
 Dinhtuong, the stamping ground of the "Ever
 Victorious" must never be exaggerated into
 nationwide symptoms, yet all this evidence
 was pretty impressive nonetheless.
 The provincial evidence and the immense
 refugee movement were impressive, above all,
 because they had no precedents. Even more
 impressive, and equally unprecedented, was
 the evidence of the many battlefields. Until
 hardly more than a year ago, just one Viet
 Cong prisoner of war or battlefield deserter
 was so rare a phenomenon that Saigon would
 be agog about him for days on end, and it
 was also a real cause for celebration if as
 many as four or five enemy dead were found
 on the field of battle.  Even today the V.C.
 and North Vietnamese have not altered the
 battlefield discipline that requires all killed
 and wounded to be carried away by their
 comrades, any more than they have changed
 their rules  against  desertion.   After  the
 Chulai fight, a couple of hundred Viet Cong
 corpses were found hidden in a trench where
 they had been dragged with butchers' meat
 hooks,   More recently, V.C. P.O.W.'s    have
 turned up with loops attached to their cloth-
 ing to make dragging easier in case of need-
 a prebattle precaution which must surely
 raise fighting spirit In a wonderful manner.
 Thus while others might be unimpressed, I,
 remembering the quite recent past, was left
 all but incredulous by the almost daily body
 counts of enemy dead abandoned on the
 battlefield, and by the constant news of pris-
 oners of war and battlefield deserters.
 It is also worth noting that in the two
 months of January and February, the body
 counts reached a grisly cumulative total of
 7,362 enemy dead. This means that the true
 total of enemy killed in action was certainly
 above 10,000, for although counts made in
 combat must be discounted for accidental
 duplication, a big addition must also be
 made for enemy dead dragged away in con-
 tinuing compliance with the old discipline.
 It is also conservative to assume that the
 total of the enemy's disablingly wounded was
 double the total of those killed.  Hence the
 overall figure for enemy dead and disabled
 in January and February alone was probably
 above 30,000.  To this must be added 1,100
 P.O.W.'s and battlefield deserters-the latter
 being troops who seize the opportunity of
 battle to squat down in a ditch until they are
 overrun by our men.
 To be sure, not more than half these heavy
 V.C, losses were soldiers of the main forces,
 for many were porters, guerrillas, local-force
 troops and even civilians impressed as tem-
 porary porters.  But even so, it was abun-
 dantly clear that the main forces were being
 very badly knocked about.  This was all the
 more striking because the Ia Drang experi-
 ence had taught the Viet Cong and North
 Vietnamese commanders not to court any
 more  set-piece  battles.  Engaging  main
 forces had therefore become more difficult,
 since they in most cases had first to be
 sought out.  Altogether the "seek out and
 destroy" strategy struck me as succeeding
 beyond all expectations.   What is more im-
 portant, this opinion was--and is-shared by
 Gen. Westmoreland.
 If you look at this war's military aspect
 without regard to such political factors as
 instability in Saigon, or hesitancy in Wash-
 ington to give full backing to Gen. West-
 moreland, you have to conclude that the
 situation is full of promise.  To be sure, the
 enemy is still reinforcing at about the rate
 projected in the November estimates.  To be
 sure, the very fact that the enemy is still
 reinforcing means that clearly he intends to
 use his reinforcements in battle.  So there is
 hard fighting still ahead.  But if you make a
 practical analysis of the V.C. second govern-
 ment's problems, you are driven to conclude
 that the present enemy reinforcement is like
 one of those last high raises that losing
 players sometimes make to frighten their
 Opponents out of a poker game.
 The limit on the number of troops the
 North  Vietnamese  Communists  can  send
 southward is not yet in sight, but the limit
 is quite clearly in sight on the number of
 troop units the V.C. second government can
 sustain in the South.   This is why it is
 wrong to talk about an "unlimited war," and
 this Is also the main reason for believing
 that we are confronted with something like
 a desperate last high raise in poker.  If you
 examine  the  projection  of  enemy-troop
 buildup made by Gen. Westmoreland's staff,
 you find, first of all, that most of the build-
 up is accounted for by a very large additional
 invasion of the South by North Vietnamese.
 This is risky in itself, since many of the
 southern rank and file of the Viet Cong
 much resent the overt northern takeover in
 the South.  Second, you find a very puzzling
 anomaly, in the form of a great increase in
 the  burden  of  the  already  overburdened
 V.C. second government.
 In the spring of 1965 the strain of sup-
 porting main forces of a strength of 10 di-
 visions was already severe.                                                                                     If the enemy
 buildup continues until the end of this year
 as projected by the Westmoreland staff, the
 strain will be nearly twice as great, for the
 V.C. second government will be supporting
 main forces of the strength of 18 divisions.
 All the strictly military personnel of the
 main forces are now coming from  North
 Vietnam-but this was already the case in
 1965.  But now, on the one hand, the V.C.
 second government has a reduced productive
 and manpower base, primarily because of
 the refugee movement.  And on the other
 hand, if the buildup continues as projected,
 the second government is eventually going
 to have to provide the main forces with
 nearly twice as much rice and each month,
 with at least double the number of men to
 fill gaps in the regimental ranks, and with
 close to double the number of men or women
 (for women are now being drafted for this
 purpose) to serve in the ported battalions
 and the longer range transport detachments.
 If the strain was already severe in the spring
 of 1965, what then will be the strain on the
 V.C. second government by December, 1966?
 The answer, I think, is that the present
 enemy reinforcement has behind it a truly
 desperate decision-a decision, in  fact,  to
 throw In all remaining reserves, and to con-
 sume all the remaining stocks of food and
 other supplies still cached in the main bases,
 to make one final try for victory.  If this be
 true, we are indeed confronted, with a last
 high raise.  And the maker of a last high
 raise always loses the game If another player
 has the resources and the courage to call
 and raise again.
 I  believe that we in America, have the
 needed  courage,  as  I  know we  have  the
 needed resources.    To this hopeful observa-
 tion, however, I must add two brief foot-
 notes. First, a warning is needed concerning
 that phrase "losing the game."    When and
 if Gen. Westmoreland succeeds in breaking
 the enemy's main forces, the big war in
 Vietnam will be over, and the game will
 really be won.  Breaking the main forces will
 break most of the V.C. power in the country-
 side.  It will not break all the V.C. power,
 however.  A little war of mopping-up opera-
 tions,  costing few casualties  and needing
 fewer troops, but troublesome and ugly all
 the same, may therefore continue for a con-
 siderable period.  By method and determi-
 nation, that little war can be won in the
 end in South Vietnam.  But the War plan-
 ners in Hanoi will still be the masters of the
 V.C. remnants of the South.  They will still
 have the power to end all fighting by calling
 home their men.  And the prime reason for
 maintaining a stern, persistent, though not
 irrational, bombing pressure on North Viet-
 nam is to teach the lesson that the call-
 home order had better be given as soon as the
 big war in the South is decisively lost.
 Second, despite the hopefulness of the mil-
 itary situation, the war can perhaps be lost
 somewhere in the dark labyrinths of Saigon
 politics.  Despite all the positive factors, this
 warning must be reiterated, and the need for
 American patience with the vagaries of Viet-
 namese politics must be emphasized
 For close on a century before 1954, the
 Vietnamese     had  no  experience  of  self-
 government.                                                                                                                                                     Under Ngo Dinh Diem, they
 then made considerable progress.   As au-
 thoritarian governments go, the Diem regime
 was worthy of considerable respect-for more
 respect, certainly, than the dogmatic, harsh
 and  gloomy         Communist  regime in  the
 North-but under Diem, the Vietnamese got
 their bellyful of authoritarian government in
 Saigon.   A long period of sometimes wild
 cut-and-try is therefore unavoidable, before
 the Vietnamese find the mode of government
 that suits their traditions, habits and out-
 look.                                                                                                                                 There is nothing to worry about in
 that-so long as they do not stab themselves
 in the back during one of the wilder cut-
 and-tries.   For  the  long  pull,  moreover,
 South Vietnam is one of the very richest
 countries in Asia, with an industrious and
 talented people who have been forcefully
 dragged into the 20th century by all the
 technological lessons of their bitter war ex-
 perience.                                                                                                                                 So I have no patience with those
 who ask, "What shall we have in South Viet-
 nam, even if we win?"  Every sort of basic
 factor promises a good future, if the suffering
 people of South Vietnam can only be granted

 THE JOSEPH H. HIRSHHORN MU-
 SEUM AND SCULPTURE GARDEN
 Mr, ANDERSON. Mr. President, a bill
 to establish the Joseph H. Hirshhorn
 Museum and Sculpture Garden has been
 referred to the Committee on Public
 Works.  The proposed site is an area
 bounded by Seventh Street, Independ-
 ence Avenue, Ninth Street and Madison
 Drive.  As a member of the Board of
 Regents of the Smithsonian Institution,
 which would administer the center, I
 want to thank Senator RANDOLPH for
 introducing this legislation.
 To Mr. Hirshhorn the American peo-
 ple are indebted_ His gift of some 4,000
 paintings and 1,600 pieces of sculpture
 are thought to be among the most valu-
 able contemporary collections in private
 hands.  Most of us will try to understand
 Mr. Hirshhorn's desire to share with
 others the pleasure these works have
 brought to him.  As a boy his horizons
 rose beyond the Brooklyn slum in which
 he determinately nutured an early ap-
 preciation of the arts.  Now Mr. Hirsh-
 horn passes on to the American people
 the fruits of his aspirations.  It is only
 fitting that these works have their per-
 manent home in Washington-a city
 whose emergence as a cultural center
 mirrors the vitality and growth of our
 20th century.  Certainly, Mr. Hirshhorn
 follows nobly in the steps of other great
 humanitarians who have so generously
 given of themselves.
 AWARD FOR HIGHWAY SAFETY
 TO INDIANA MAN
 Mr.  HARTKE.  Mr.  President,  on
 May 24 Jim Hetherington of WFBM-TV
 In Indianapolis received the Creative
 Award for television writers at the an-
 nual Alfred P. Sloan Radio-TV Awards
 for Highway Safety in New York City.
 It is my pleasure to read his citation:
 Jim Hetherington of WFBM-TV, Indian-
 apolis, Indiana, displayed outstanding crea-
 tive talent in preparation of the script far
 an analytical documentary entitled A Cross
 By The Road.  The film explained with
 dramatic effect the complexity and enormity
 of the traffic accident problem, yet outlined
 with clarity the interrelated solutions which
 can  be  implemented.  Widespread  public
 response to this exceptional film created a
 better understanding of traffic safety values.
 I am proud that Mr. Hetherington and
 WFBM-TV have received this recogni-
 tion for their outstanding public service
 to  the  people  of  Indianapolis  and
 Indiana.
 The principal address at the Sloan
 Awards dinner was given by Under
 Secretary of Commerce Alan S. Boyd.
 His remarks effectively answer those
 who  would  dodge  responsibility  for
 mounting a really meaningful attack on
 traffic accidents by continuing to blame
 this national disgrace almost entirely
 Under Secretary Boyd has given the
 best explanation I have seen of the need
 to take account of all elements in high-
 way transportation and of directing our
 efforts 'to helping motorists avoid acci-
 dents, injury, and death.
 As he so clearly shows, those who sit
 back and contend that accidents are
 caused in almost all cases by bad driving
 are in effect making excuses for doing
 nothing constructive about it.
 Mr. Boyd shows that there is a way to
 do something about it, and I believe all
 my colleagues will be interested in his
 reasoning.  I believe he offers assurance
 that the various legislative proposals
 now before Congress can produce a pro-
 gram that will get results for the Ameri-
 can people.
 I have offered amendments which I'
 believe will improve and strengthen the
 program proposed by the administra-
 tion, and I am confident that the Con-
 gress will enact a strong, fair and effec-
 tive bill.  We shall continue executive
 consideration of S. 3005 and the pro-
 posed amendments in the Commerce
 Committee tomorrow.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that Mr. Boyd's speech be included
 in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the speech
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 REMARKS BY ALAN S. BOYD, UNDER SECRETARY
 OF COMMERCE FOR TRANSPORTATION
 (Prepared for delivery at the annual pre-
 sentation of the Alfred P. Sloan Radio-TV
 Awards for Highway Safety, at the Waldorf-
 Astoria Hotel, New York City, May 24, 1966)
 There is a normal human tendency to be
 self-satisfied: to feel that what we are doing
 now and the way in which we conduct our
 affairs 'is good and sufficient.  It is often
 uncomfortable to consider that we can and
 t should improve our activities.  But we can
 step out of our humdrum routine to promote,
 to inspire, and to educate.    Those whom we
 honor tonight have done this by utilizing the
 communications media with sensitivity and
 imagination to promote Highway Safety.
 In winning the Alfred P. Sloan Awards you
 have demonstrated your ability to live up to
 Mr. Sloan's own high ideals of public respon-
 sibility.  This sense of responsibility was re-
 flected in his life-long commitment to the
 cause of highway safety, and the personal
 leadership he gave to this cause.
 Thirty years ago he joined with three other
 industry leaders in organizing the Automotive
 Safety Foundation, which he continued to
 support even after his retirement as an active
 executive of General Motors Corporation.  In
 1948, as founder and chairman of the Alfred
 P. Sloan Foundation, he established these
 awards to the broadcasting industry, and he
 continued to participate personally in this
 program so long as his health permitted.
 It is good to take occasion periodically to
 recognize the efforts spent on traffic safety
 because those who are devoting their energies
 to this cause may be tempted to feel that they
 have been rowing upstream and against a
 strong current, at that.  Tonight's ceremony
 affords a brief pause to look around and see
 where we have been and where we are going.
 I can't leave this simile, however, without
 urging you not to rest too long on your oars.
 We have made  considerable progress in
 this long upstream struggle.  Travel on the
 Nation's roads and streets is almost three
 times as safe as when the Automotive Safety
 Foundation was founded-as measured in
 deaths per vehicle miles.
 But it still is far from safe enough.  The
 closer we get to shore, if you will, the stronger
 the current-because of the enormous growth
 in population, in drivers, vehicles, and high-
 way usage.  The absolute toll in lives lost,
 injuries, accidents and damages now reaches
 new records each year.
 The figures are familiar and frightening:
 Fifty thousand American skilled in. a year;
 100,000 permanently disabled; nearly 4 mil-
 lion injured;  over $10 billion in economic
 losses.
 You know, and I believe more and more
 American citizens know, that this national
 tragedy need not continue.  They agree with
 President Johnson that "we can on longer
 tolerate such anarchy on wheels."
 Earlier this year President Johnson pre-
 sented a program designed to carry forward a
 comprehensive, accelerated attack on traffic
 accidents. . Congress now is preparing to
 make decisions about this program which I
 am confident will launch a new era in safer
 highway travel for the American people-
 provided the program receives the strong and
 continuing support it must have to be most
 effective.
 First, let me make it as clear as I can that
 the Administration's approach is positive, not
 negative.
 The Administration has not sought to
 create scapegoats.  It has no script for "good
 guys" and "bad guys."  It has not thought
 in terms of accusing or punishing anyone.
 It has, instead, thought in terms of how
 accidents, injuries, and deaths can be re-
 duced.  We in the Administration are not in-
 terested in legislation for the sake of legisla-
 tion.  We are not concerned with organizing
 elaborate programs for their own sake-or for
 their propaganda value.
 In three words: We want results.
 Last April 22 in making an appeal for
 enactment'of the Administration's highway
 safety bill, President Johnson said:
 "The American people are aroused.  They
 want action.  We want action, too, but we
 want it to be fair and intelligent-for the
 American driver and the great industry that
 provides his car."
 That sums up our goal: to obtain tangible
 improvements in highway safety, with fair-
 ness and intelligence.
 This objective has been the guideline in
 formulating the Administration's proposals.
 I believe an examination of those proposals
 will bear me out.
 These proposals do not anticipate any easy
 cure, just as they do not single out any
 particular villian.  They do not prejudice any
 fact of the safety issue.  Rather, they offer a
 program designed to take full advantage of
 the progress made to date, and to force the
 pace in discovering and implementing new
 knowledge  and  new  techniques  that will
 yield substantial, provable benefits.
 The public discussion and debate of the
 past few months, while they have stimulated
 a desirable public interest in traffic safety,
 have tended to center attention on one or
 two elements of the problem.  The Admin-
 istration's program, on the other hand, con-
 siders all aspects.
 The scope and direction of the Adminis-
 tration's program has been emphasized re-
 peatedly by Secretary Connor in his appear-
 ances before Congressional Committees.   I
 would like to quote from his testimony:
 "The program that would be provided by
 this  legislation  would  devote  the needed
 emphasis and resources to all aspects of the
 highway safety problem.  It is based on the
 recognition that accidents often are caused
 by multiple factors-they are frequently the
 result of some failure of the system which
 includes the driver, his vehicle, and his en-
 vironment, including the highway, or the
 interaction of all three.  It does not assume
 that any one of these elements is more im-
 portant than the others, and it is not di-
 rected toward a panacea-type solution to the
 highway safety problem.
 "The approach of this legislation, besides
 being directed toward all elements of the
 traffic safety problem, would include the
 Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400080017
 11768
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE             June 6, 1966
 participation of all levels of the Govern-
 ment-Federal, State, and local-as well as
 industry and private organizations."
 I might add that the legislation was drafted
 intentionally to be flexible with regard to
 program, organization and administration,
 so as to facilitate the full use of existing
 knowledge and the results of research and
 -development as they become available and
 as their usefulness is proven.
 Specifically, the Administration proposes
 a broad Federal research and development
 program in highway safety.   The Admin-
 istration also seeks directive authority to set
 safety performance standards for automotive
 vehicles  and their components.   And  the
 Administration is seeking $420 million over
 a six year period to assist the States.in de-
 veloping and improving their own compre-
 hensive traffic safety programs under uni-
 form national standards.
 The latter provision recognizes the tradi-
 tional responsibilities of State and local gov-
 ernments with regard to control of the traffic
 system.
 The Federal Government's responsibility
 to provide leadership and coordination for
 these State programs was clearly established
 .by Congress last year, in an amendment to
 Federal-aid highway legislation.  Now, the
 Administration is seeking Federal funds to
 assist the States in carrying out the objec-
 tives of this amendment.
 This approach is in keeping with the
 spirit  of  Federal-State  cooperation  which
 has worked so successfully In the Federal-aid
 highway program.   Through this program
 the Federal Government has made and is
 making an, enormous contribution to high-
 way safety. It is enabling the States to con-
 struct the Interstate Highway System, whose
 controlled-access  freeways  are  the  safest
 roads yet built.  It is assisting the States in
 their long-range improvement programs for
 major highways.    And now it is aiding them
 in a priority program for eliminating the
 danger traps that still remain on Federal-
 aid highways.
 The Federal-aid program, is providing sub-
 stantial benefits in safety, as well as in faster,
 more  economical,  and  more  comfortable
 travel.
 Still, highways are only one element of
 the traffic safety problem.  The legislation
 now on the books, as a result of last year's
 amendment, plus the financial aid requested
 by the Administration,  would permit the
 development of a comprehensive program,
 with no aspect excluded.
 It would permit a program directed to-
 ward the total highway transportation sys-
 tem,                   and  its  three  basic  elements:  the
 driver, his vehicle, and the highway. The
 States would continue to assume primary
 responsibility for control of the driver and
 the highway, but the Federal government
 would take a portion of the States' responsi-
 bility for the vehicle, to the extent that it
 would assure that new vehicles met mini-
 mum safety performance standards.   This
 new role for the Federal Government recog-
 nizes the desirability for uniform national
 standards for manufacturers,  rather than
 separate State standards.
 In addition, under its authority to set uni-
 form standards for other areas of State traf-
 fic safety programs, the Federal Government
 could identify the major gaps and weak-
 nesses that exist throughout the country
 today, and proceed in cooperation with the
 States to upgrade current programs and
 formulate new ones as needed.
 The goal of the program I just outlined is
 to get tangible improvements in highway
 safety with fairness and intelligence.  The
 key to how this program must proceed to
 get results lies in the concept that accidents
 and their consequences result from failures
 of the system which includes the driver, the  is a complicated task, that It occasionally
 vehicle, the highway, and their interaction.  requires drivers to make decisions and to act
 with speed or precision that is beyond their
 abilities.  We can help them by reducing the
 difficulty of the driving task or by giving
 them better tools to cope with it.
 System engineering is the way to this
 objective.  It can be effective both in pre-
 venting accidents and in reducing the sever-
 ity of those that do occur.  At the present
 time, for example,  highway engineers are
 experimenting with breakaway sign supports
 for those obstacles that must remain near
 the pavement.  Research also is underway in
 the Bureau of Public Roads to develop elec-
 tronic                                                                                                                        or mechanical aids for the driver,
 which could, for instance, inform him when
 it is safe to pass on a two-lane rural high-
 way, or when he is closing too fast on the
 car ahead.
 The systems approach also looks to changes
 in the vehicle that will make driving more
 reliable, or that will prevent or reduce in-
 jury and death when accidents happen.  And
 it looks to the interaction of the vehicle and
 the highway, and to reducing the adverse
 effects of the environment, particularly of
 hazardous weather conditions.
 By approaching highway safety as pri-
 marily a technological problem-and only
 secondarily as a social or legal one-and by
 attempting to reduce the demands on the
 driver, we encounter some raised eyebrows
 from those accustomed to thinking of acci-
 dents In terms of driver error.  It has been
 suggested, for Instance, that this approach
 is somehow immoral, that it relieves drivers
 of  responsibility  for  misconduct,  that  it
 excuses them instead of punishing them.
 I do not agree.     It is no more immoral than
 shaving with a safety razor instead of a
 straight edge.
 It does say that the man who makes a mis-
 take, where it is an honest one or pure negli-
 gence, need not suffer instantaneous corporal,
 if not capital, punishment.  And that inno-
 cent passengers and drivers of other cars
 need not suffer with him.    The drunken,
 reckless,  or  irresponsibile driver  can  be
 brought to justice through due process of
 law.
 Furthermore, the people we are trying to
 protect are not,  by  and  large, habitually
 dangerous drivers. They are not the "suicidal
 boobs" that self-styled experts like to preach
 against.  Nor are they imaginary.  They are,
 in fact, you and I.
 The truth is that the great bulk of ac-
 cidents involve average, normally responsible
 drivers.  This was borne out quite clearly
 in an analysis by the Bureau of Public Roads
 last summer of 150,000 California drivers'
 records.  The study showed that almost an
 entirely different  group  of  drivers  is  in-
 volved in  accidents each year.  Removing
 the repeaters-those who have two or more
 accidents in one year-would have little or
 no effect on the following year's accidents.
 So, our annual traffic toll is, to an over-
 whelming degree, an accumulation of rare
 accidents, occurring to all too many generally
 good drivers.  It is plain, then, that if ac-
 cidents  are  to  be  radically  reduced,  all
 drivers-not just  the  "dangerous" few-
 must be helped.
 This is precisely what President Johnson's
 traffic safety program is meant to do.
 Relating this view of driver error or driver
 responsibility more specifically to the safety
 efforts  we are honoring tonight,  I would
 guess-and this is an undocumented guess-
 that most of the traffic safety efforts of radio
 and TV stations in past years would come
 under the heading of "driver motivation" or
 "driver improvement,"  No one, of course,
 would deny that there is room for. improve-
 ment in the general level of driver com-
 petence.  For that matter, I suppose each
 of us here could stand to improve his own
 skill behind the wheel.  But while driver
 improvement is a worthy cause, it must be

 While this concept is simple enough to
 state, its implications are not widely under-
 stood.                                                                           It requires the rather belated appli-
 cation to highway transportation of what is
 known  in  engineering  as  the  "systems
 approach."
 The main obstacle to the most effective
 use of systems engineering in the past, has
 been the practice of assigning a "primary"
 cause  in  accidents-and  particularly of
 blaming most accidents on "driver error."
 In this way of thinking any accident that a
 driver may conceivably have averted is ipso
 facto his fault.  The way to prevent acci-
 dents, then, is to make all drivers perform at
 all 'times without error.
 Systems engineering, on the other hand,
 recognizes that accidents can result from
 multiple causes, in the sense that a cause is
 any condition existing prior to the accident
 which it might have been possible or prac-
 ticable to eliminate, and but for which the
 accident would have been avoided.  In this
 view, all accident causes are equal if, by the
 elimination of any one of them, the accident
 might have been prevented.
 Rather than accepting driver error as the
 "primary" cause of most accidents, systems
 engineering seeks ways to change the ele-
 ments of the highway transportation system
 so that accidents will not occur, or so that
 their severity will be reduced.
 For a simple parallel we can take an Illus-
 tration from industry.  A worker could be
 trained to operate a dangerous power ma-
 chine and signs could be posted warning him
 to  work safely.  Then if he gets careless
 just once and maims himself, it is presum-
 ably his own fault.                                                                                On the other hand, the
 machine could be designed with a protective
 guard which would make it impossible for
 him to get hurt.
 In highway transportation, the effective-
 ness                                                                           of  the  systems  approach  has  been
 demonstrated quite clearly by the Interstate
 Highway  System.  These  controlled-access
 freeways are consciously designed to prevent
 many types of traffic conflict and to make
 driving easier and safer,
 They provide separate roadways for oppos-
 ing traffic with wide medians, or median
 barriers, to prevent headon collisions.  They
 have no intersections, or cross traffic at
 grade,  thus  preventing  angle   collisions.
 They have gentle curves and grades and long
 sight  distance.  They  have  wide,     paved
 shoulders and clear roadsides.
 On the best of our highways, if a driver
 loses control of his car for whatever reason-
 whether he was swatting a bee, lifting his
 pet clog off the floor, falling asleep, or if he
 had a "couple of beers"-if he goes off the
 road, he has a chance of regaining control
 without slamming into a tree, or rolling into
 a ditch.  What could have been a needless
 fatality becomes simply an incident.,
 Or take a case where the vehicle is at fault.
 If the brakes fail, the driver has a better
 chance to ride out safely on the Interstate,
 because there are no intersections, or drive-
 ways, or cross traffic, or sharp curves, and
 there! are wide shoulders where he can get
 out of the traffic stream.
 Because safety has been engineered into
 the Interstate System, the same drivers have
 only a half or a third as many accidents on
 the Interstate as they do on conventional
 highways.   This year alone, the Interstate
 Highways now open to traffic will save the
 lives of at least 4,000 persons who would be
 killed if they were forced to use conventional
 roads.
 It is apparent, then, that if we try to
 understand drivers as they are-with their
 capabilities and their limitations-we can de-
 sign highways and vehicles that make their
 driving more reliable and more effective.

 good time with all of the give and take that
 he engendered, particularly as state chairman
 of the Democratic party.
 The contest of living was fun as parlayed
 into politics, and he enjoyed it to the hilt.
 This side of his personality overreached
 the others: That of the lawyer, of good citi-
 zen, leading layman in his church, of good
 father and family man.  This may or may
 not be unfortunate, judging how one views
 life.
 It is sad that so much talent and energy
 has been lost to this community, state and
 nation through a physical accident such as
 the massive coronary occlusion that Mr.
 Phelan suffered early Monday.  He had a
 great future ahead of him both in, the law
 and in politics, and this had not been dimin-
 ished one whit by the fact that he did not
 gain the nomination for the federal circuit
 judgeship for which he was recommended.
 His career in state government was going
 forward; he had every intention of running
 for the State Senate and most likely would
 have, been elected, over our opposition, of
 course; but elected nevertheless.
 We were sort of looking forward to this,
 and somehow secretly glad he did not stray
 off onto the neutral pathways of the ju-
 diciary which would have put him out of the
 arena.
 So as we take our leave of Walter Phelan,
 with a great deal of sadness, we do so think-

 shall sincerely miss him in many respects,

 TRIBUTE TO WALTER
 The last tilde we talked with Walter Phe-
 lan, it was in company with Father Bernard
 Brown, a Catholic priest who serves as an
 Oblate order missionary with the flare Skin
 Indians above the Arctic Circle. It really was
 Father Brown's interview but Walter brought
 him by because the priest was a house guest
 of the Phelans and furthermore a longtime
 family friend.
 For once we did not engage in any political
 needling with Walter, which quite often took
 the form of our conversation.  He was in-
 tensely interested in Father'Brown and the
 latter's dedicated efforts with the remote In-
 dian tribe.  For those who thought of Mr.
 Phelan as strictly either a legal expert, and
 he was an outstanding attorney in any
 arena, or a doughty opponent on the politi-
 cal field, and he certainly was that, too, this
 was something of a switch.
 But there were many sides to Walter, and
 this is but one of those that were not revealed
 to the general public who most often con-
 ceived of him as a political battler, in the
 thick of controversy.  There were even some
 very interesting side angles to this facet of
 his personality, and one that made us like
 him very much despite some of the jawbone
 conflicts we engaged in.
 For example, Walter once observed to us:
 "There's no point in being in politics unless
 you can have some fun out of it." This was
 in connection with some statement calcu-
 lated to outrage the Republicans, whom Mr.
 Phelan quite frequently sought to annoy,
 and took great delight in doing so.
 As a master. of wielding the political shiv,
 Walter often drove home the point; and
 when it came his turn to receive the counter-
 blows, he did so without complaint, or re-
 sorting to the excuse that he had been ill-
 used, or had suffered a low form of attack.
 This was because he not only was a highly
 intelligent man but he also. possessed an
 intelligence graced by a well-developed sense
 of humor; plus a sense of the spirit of com-
 bat, that did not, carry with it rancor, spite
 or  ate.
 Somehow' we  got  the  impression  that
 through the swirling smoke of broadsides
 fired   through   press  releases, editorials,
 speeches and other forms of political weap-
 onry, Walter was having a tremendously

 with respect not only to its stockholders
 and depositors but, also, to the public; and
 Whereas,  isolated  instances  have  arisen
 where such trust has been violated, with
 harmful publicity to banking as a whole; and
 Whereas, the Arkansas Bankers Association
 feels that all reasonable precautions should
 be taken within the concept of the dual
 banking  system  for  adequate  protection
 against any breach of such trust; and
 Whereas, certain laws have been promul-
 gated, principally on the national level, which
 duplicate existing laws; overregulate banks;
 restrict free flow of money; and inhibit the
 ability of banks to attract funds; and
 Whereas, even though all financial insti-
 tutions were created by law for specific func-
 tions, with separate and distinct powers and
 services, there is a willful, blurring of the
 distinctions, and the attempted blending of
 the services, to the confusion of the. general
 public; and
 Whereas, the Congress of the United States
 is becoming more fully aware of the existing
 conditions and problems, because Arkansas'
 own native son, Senator JOHN L. MCCLELLAN,
 has directed the attention of Congress to
 the report of the Senate Permanent Sub-Com-
 mittee on Investigations on recent practices
 in banking: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved, That the Arkansas Bankers As-
 sociation, in this Seventy Sixth Convention
 here assembled, urges and requests that the
 historic concept of the dual banking system
 with its inherent public trust, separate and
 distinct powers, be preserved without dupli-
 cation and over regulation, and that Senator
 JOHN L. MCCLELLAN be commended for his
 foresight and perception in the necessity to
 combat the existing trends.

 U.N. OPPORTUNITY IN VIETNAM
 Mr.  RIBICOFF.  Mr.  President on
 June 2, South Vietnam made a formal
 request for United Nations observers to
 oversee the elections for a constituent
 assembly in September.
 This request is a welcome one.  It
 should be hailed by all who long for a
 solution to the tragic situation in Viet-
 nam.  For this request, if granted, will
 give the United Nations an opportunity
 to become actively 'involved where an
 objective international presence is sorely
 needed.
 It will not be easy to gain United
 Nations sanction for this proposal. The
 President has given his strong support
 to the South Vietnamese request.  Am-
 bassador Goldberg shares his enthusiasm.
 We hope that Secretary General U Thant
 will lend his great personal influence and
 the prestige of his office to this upder-
 taking. Most of all we hope that France
 and the Soviet Union will give their sup-
 port to the proposal when it comes before
 the Security Council.  Their votes are
 important.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous sup-
 port that an editorial which appeared in
 the New York Times on June 3 be inserted
 in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as. follows:
 U.N.  OPPORTUNrrY  IN  VIETNAM
 The formal request by the Saigon Govern-
 ment for United Nations observers at the
 election of a constituent assembly in Sep-
 tember provides the opportunity for effective
 U.N. involvement in the Vietnamese crisis.
 We hope that Secretary General Thant, who
 has been so alert to the menacing implica-
 tions for the world of military escalation and
 internal chaos in'South Vietnam, will swiftly
 join President Johnson in endorsing Saigon's
 bid for impartial supervision of the balloting
 this fall.
 The assembly election is an essential initial
 step toward establishing democratic rule in
 South Vietnam, and the U.N. Is the ideal
 agency to supply observers to help guarantee
 fair voting in a war-shattered country with
 no tradition of representative government.
 The United States, as we have often noted, is
 much too deeply committed in Vietnam to be
 considered detached in any election role it
 might be asked to exercise.

 June 6, 1966             CoNGRESSIO At RECORD -'SENATE
 The ' Legislature noted that three Maine
 electric utilities and eight others from else-
 where in New England, the "Sig 'Eleven
 Powerloop," also plan an atomic plant in
 that state.
 The Maine Power Authority and the pri-
 vate group, known as Maine Yankee Atomic
 Power Company, would serve the same mar-
 ket.
 Maine Yankee Atomic and the Maine Power
 Authority would generate an almost identical
 supply of 700,000 kilowatts, more than the
 state needs pending an unexpected industrial
 expansion.
 The plant at Otter Point would provide
 what is known as base-load or constant power
 and the proposed hydroelectric project at
 Dickey-Lincoln School would furnish peaking
 power.
 Proponents of the Maine Power Authority
 believe the two projects-theirs and Dickey-
 could augment each other, increasing annual
 residential use in Maine while cutting power
 costs.
 John N. Harris, technical consultant to ad-
 vocates of the authority, believes the project
 could operate nearly 40 percent more cheaply
 than private utilities.
 A power authority could produce at a cost
 range of from 3.1 to 3.2 mills at the start
 compared to a 4.8 mills cost factor for the
 private companies, according to Harris.
 The Legislature has asked for an interim
 report next month and a complete report
 by Aug. 1.

 OUR  HIGH  COST  OF  ELECTRICITY,  IX;  THE
 GREAT BLACKOUT PUT THE  SPOTLIGHT ON
 PowER
 (By Richard Connolly)
 When the lights went out during the
 Northeast blackout, the spotlight of public
 scrutiny shone brighter than ever on the
 private utilities of New England.
 It still shines, much to the awareness of
 the utilities themselves.
 More people are asking more questions
 about  how our private utilities operate.
 They want to know why New E`ngland's aver-
 age electric rates are the highest in the
 country.
 They want to know what is being done
 about it.
 "Kilowatts ..." "Megawatts ..." "Firm
 power ..." "Peaking power...."
 The glossary of power terms goes on and
 on, to the confusion of the average con-
 sumer.
 He is interested in power principally in
 terms of his electric bill and whether it's go-
 ing up of down.
 The consumer is served by a monopoly.
 He has no choice of product.
 As one congressional critic of the private
 power interests has pointed out, the con-
 sumer cannot go bargain hunting for "Super
 Krunchy Kilowatts."
 Under these conditions he must rely upon
 his elected representatives and the regula-
 tory agencies which they appoint.  Govern-
 ment must stand guardian for the Interests
 of the consumer.
 Since the blackout, government in this
 region has taken a closer look at private
 power.
 In Massachusetts, for example, the Legis-
 lature created a special commission to in-
 vestigate the massive blackout of last Nov. 9
 and the generation, distribution and cost of
 power.
 The, commission was given a broad man-
 date which also covers the electric rate struc-
 ture and the financing of the electric com-
 panies  both  private  and  municipally-
 operated.
 Headed by Sen. James P. Rurak (D-Haver-
 hill), tie commission has held several orga-
 nizational meetings to map its job and to
 determine "how much money it will need.
 The 17-member commission includes repre-
 sentatives of labor, industry, private power,
 public power and the Legislature.
 The legislation which created the com-
 mission  was  proposed` originally  by  the
 Massachusetts Consumers'  Council     which
 said the power question has been a chronic
 problem.
 .The only Way It could be solved, the Con-
 sumers' Council maintained, was through a
 "tough, hard-nose commission operating in
 the public eye."
 Whether the legislative commission finds
 the answer for Massachusetts remains to be
 seen.
 In its overall approach to the problem, New
 England  has  under  consideration  several
 huge projects-the "Big Eleven Power Loop,"
 Dickey-Lincoln School and Gov. Hoff's plan
 to import Canadian power.
 The advocates of each vouch for the rela-
 tive cost benefits of the projects.
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston stud-
 ied the projects and the current condition of
 the power industry extensively and concluded
 that New England consumers would pay less
 for electricity before long.
 The analysis, conducted by John Wilkin-
 son of its research department, showed that
 the price would be about the same whether
 the new facilities are erected by public or
 private groups.
 "Long ago," Wilkinson wrote in his re-
 view, "state legislatures and the Congress
 recognized that electric utilities were nat-
 ural monopolies 'clothed with a public inter-
 est' and they have been regtilated-more or
 less-ever since.
 "There is justification for the belief that,
 in general, commission regulation of rates
 and service has been neither very effective
 nor very positive in the past," Wilkinson con-
 tinued.
 "There are many exceptions, of course, but
 too often the incentive to reduce costs has
 not been present, cost reductions have not
 meant rate reductions, and assured markets
 have not fostered efficiency and aggressive
 innovations.
 "For the bold expansion that the future
 demands, many feel that another tool--reg-
 ulation by  competition-may better serve
 the region.
 "Competition or even the prospect of it is
 healthy.  The absence of competition, less
 than ideal regulation, and a limited view of
 the public interest may mean a sacrifice of
 efficiency.
 "But  in a  natural  monopoly situation,
 competition too many come at some sacri-
 fice in efficiency . . .
 "The elected representatives of the people
 of the region will decide what mix of plans
 and tools seem to offer the optimal solution."
 NUCLEAR POWER PLANT SITE CHOSEN
 AUGUSTA, ME.-Baily Point, a peninsula on
 Wiscasset's Back River, has been named the
 "preferred site" for a $100 million nuclear
 power  plant,  the  Maine  Yankee  Atomic
 Power Co. president said Wednesday.
 William H. Dunham said that if the U.S.
 Atomic Energy Commission and other gov-
 ernmental agencies approve, the plan is to
 start building next year for completion in
 1970.  The plant would serve much of New
 England.

 TfrtBUTE'TO WALTER B. PHELAN,
 DECEASED
 Mr. McGEE.  Mr. President, on Thurs-
 day, June 2, it was my sad task to attend
 the funeral of a dear friend and State
 political leader, Mr. Walter B. Phelan,
 of Cheyenne, Wyo.
 A young man with a brilliant ca"eer
 already well established and an even
 brighter future to look forward to, Wal-
 ter Phelan was stricken suddenly by a
 heart attack. His untimely death came
 as a shock-not only to his wonderful
 family and those of us who have had the
 honor to know him well, but to the entire
 citizenry of the State of Wyoming.
 For Walter Phelan was no ordinary
 man. He distinguished himself in every
 endeavor he undertook. As an attorney
 at law, he was considered one of Wyo-
 ming's outstanding barristers.  He was
 the county attorney at Cheyenne for 8
 years. He was the chairman of his State
 political party for 4 years. He served five
 terms in the Wyoming State House of
 Representatives; and during the last ses-
 sion of that body, he was selected to the
 position of speaker of the house. In this
 position of leadership he was able to
 achieve the passage of much beneficial
 legislation and was almost singlehand-
 edly responsible for adoption of a revi-
 sion of Wyoming's Municipal Code. Wal-
 ter had planned, this year, to seek office
 in the Wyoming State Senate where he
 most certainly would have been elected.
 I know he would have made even greater
 contributions to Wyoming's destiny in
 that role.
 Mr. President, our State-and indeed,
 our country-has lost a friend and an
 outstanding citizen in the death of Wal-
 ter Phelan. My sentiments are echoed in
 the editorials which have appeared in the
 Wyoming press these past few days, and
 I ask unanimous consent that they be
 printed at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorials
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Cheyenne (Wyo.) Eagle, May 31,
 1966]
 WALTER B. PHELAN
 A brilliant legal and political career sud-
 dently came to an end yesterday morning
 when Walter B. Phelan died.
 At 46, Phelan already had established him-
 self as one of the fine attorneys of Wyoming
 and as a solid leader in the Wyoming Demo-
 cratic party.
 He served as Wyoming Democratic chair-
 man from June, 1961, to Dec. 6, 1964, when
 he resigned to accept the post as Speaker of
 the Wyoming House of Representatives-an
 honor bestowed upon him by fellow Demo-
 cratic legislators.
 He was serving his fifth term as a member
 of the state House of Representatives at the
 time of his death.
 As Speaker of the House, during the regu-
 lar session of the 38th legislature, he guided
 several  important  pieces  of  legislation
 through that body.
 Long an outspoken critic of Wyoming's
 Right-to-Work law, he saw to it that a repeal
 passed the House in the 38th legislature.
 The repeal was defeated In the Republican-
 controlled Senate.
 Largely because of his influence, the 38th
 legislature repealed a provision that had pre-
 vented Wyoming from accepting its share of
 federal aid for education, and he helped to
 push through the longest bill of the 1965

 Of the approximately 38 million radio
 receivers in Latin America, 18 to 20 mil-
 lion are capable of receiving shortwave
 broadcasts.  Including  an  estimated
 530,000 In Cuba, VOA's daily listeners
 number about 4,200,000.
 For special events, however, such as
 the coverage of Gemini flights, the VOA
 can count on great numbers of local
 Latin American radio stations picking
 up the VOA broadcasts and relaying
 them to listeners via medium-wave.  In
 the specific case of the Gemini VI and
 VII launchings, 633 Latin American sta-
 tions relayed the VOA coverage.  A care-
 ful estimate of the audience for the
 Gemini IV coverage-which was relayed
 by 522 stations-indicated over 57 mil-
 lion listeners in Latin America.
 Aside from special events, VOA and
 USIS programs are being relayed by or
 placed on 1,485 Latin American radio
 stations for a total of 11,192 transmitter
 hours per week.  Taped package pro-
 grams of VOA, placed on local stations,
 account for 9,315 of these hours; place-
 ment of USIS locally produced shows,
 1,043; and relays of OVA programs, 834.
 VOA's newscasts are used, In Spanish,
 by 162 radio stations in 19 countries,
 and, in Portuguese, by over 50 in Brazil.
 As the number of countries-and the
 number of transmitters in those coun-
 tries-engaged In international short-
 wave radio broadcasting keep increasing,
 signals come closer together on the bands
 of receivers.  What it boils down to is
 simply that the stronger scignals are
 those which get through.  Other things
 being equal, the listener will prefer the
 stronger, clearer signal, received more
 audibly and with less interference.
 VOA is doing well in this constant
 Jockeying for position.  Nearly half of
 the total potential television audience of
 39 million in Latin America listens to
 VOA broadcasts.
 That is not to say, however, that we
 should relax.  In an audience of 16.5
 million is good, then 20 or 30 million is
 that much better.
 Radio has effected in Latin America,
 as elsewhere in the developing world,
 what Leonard Marks, Director of the
 USIA, has referred to as a sort of "in-
 stant literacy." For a long time, motion
 pictures have filled a similar void in the
 area, combining sight and sound, while
 dispensing with the necessity for the au-
 dience to be able to read and write. Tele-
 vision, however, does all of this and
 more.  It bypasses literacy, on the one
 hand, while, on the other, it has been
 used in Mexico and other countries as an
 Instrument for teaching literacy.  In
 closed-circuit  arrangements,  it helps
 overcome such Inadequacies as lack of
 trained instructors in universities. From
 the political viewpoint, it brings the na-
 tion and the world into the homes of
 people.- To radio, it adds the element of
 the visible.  To the motion picture, as
 traditionally known in moviehouses, it
 adds the element of immediacy.
 Much as television has already revolu-
 tionized communication in Latin Ameri-

 ca-and between ourselves and Latin
 America-we are merely on the thresh-
 old of its full potential. What the fu-
 ture holds, as orbiting communication
 satellites are sent aloft in greater num-
 bers, with stepped-up capabilities, and
 for longer periods of time, we can only
 guess.
 During 1965, 23 countries with televi-
 sion in Latin America devoted 7,000
 hours of their telecasting time to USIA
 materials. -
 None of the, USIA's posts in these
 countries paid anything for this massive
 block of air time, which, if purchased,
 would have cost-by conservative esti-
 mates--$2,350,000.
 Programing for Latin America by the
 USIA draws on some of the material pro-
 duced for worldwide use, such as "Report
 From America," "Science Reports," Pres-
 ident Johnson's speech at Johns Hopkins
 University, "In Search of Peace"--on
 Pope Paul's visit to the United States,
 and "Walk in Space."
 There is, additionally, areawide TV
 programing specifically directed at Latin
 America:
 News: Feature clips which are distrib-
 uted to posts not receiving U.S. commer-
 cial news service.
 Documentaries: Such as Alliance for
 Progress specials and OAS specials.
 News In depth: Special events cover-
 age and special conferences, and a pilot
 series, called "Hemisphere Perspective."
 Series: "Panorama Panamericano," a
 15-minute weekly videotape program is
 a major regular vehicle for continued
 coverage of Alliance for Progress events
 throughout the hemisphere.  It is car-
 ried on 121 television stations in 101
 cities of 20 Latin American countries.
 Nuestro   Barrio-"Our       Neighbor-
 hood"-is a 26-episode, continuing series
 of 30-minute dramatic programs devoted
 entirely to the Alliance for Progress, de-
 signed for showing in evening peak-list-
 ening periods and using top Latin Amer-
 ican talent. It is being telecast at prime
 time in 24 Latin American cities on top-
 rated TV stations.  Some cities plan
 daily reruns.
 Country  programing:  Eight  USIS
 posts produce 21 continuing television
 programs, while 18 produce specials and
 adapt and use mgterial provided by
 USIA's Motion Picture and Television
 Service.
 Special output: Among special output
 items have been television treatment of
 the Tricontinental Conference in Cuba,
 the Vietnam peace offensive, and the
 Cuban exodus.
 In summary, Mr. President, this is a
 good record of performance that deserves
 the wholehearted support of the Senate.
 That is not to say that more cannot be
 done, but the Voice of America and the
 Ui9IS are doing a good job now, and I am
 pleased to commend their performance
 to my colleagues.

 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.
 TALMADGE in the chair). Without objec-
 tion, It is so ordered.
 Mr, ROBERTSON.  Mr. President,
 H.R. 7371, the Bank Holding Company
 Act Amendments of 1966, as amended by
 the Banking and Currency Committee,
 constitutes a major step forward in the
 regulation of banks and banking.  It
 demonstrates clearly that the Congress is
 fully aware of the special needs and prob-
 lems in the field of banking, including
 both the competitive problems and the
 problems relating to public convenience
 and necessity, and can and will pass ap-
 propriate special legislation to handle
 these special problems.
 The Bank Holding Company Act of
 1956 was the outcome of 18 years of ef-
 fort on the part of my predecessor, Carter
 Glass, and many years of effort on the
 part of the Banking and Currency Com-
 mittee after I became a member of that
 Committee. It was intended to apply in
 the field of banking and bank holding
 companies the general purposes of the
 antitrust laws-to promote competition
 and to prevent monopoly-and the gen-
 eral purposes of the Glass-Steagall Act
 of 1933-to prevent unduly close connec-
 tions between banking and other busi-
 nesses.  For the first time, the Bank
 Holding Company Act of 1956 imposed
 effective and meaningful restrictions on
 the forming of new bank holding com-
 panies, the acquisition of banks by bank
 holding companies and the conduct of
 business within bank holding company
 systems.  These controls have proved
 generally effective and satisfactory.
 However, like- all major statutes, the
 Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 was
 the product of compromise, and, like all
 such statutes, experience under it dem-
 onstrated the need for amendments of
 one kind or another.  We knew at the
 time we passed the 1956 act that it
 would be necessary to revise the act as
 the result of experience under it, and we,
 therefore, required the Federal Reserve
 Board to report to us at the end of 2
 years and annually thereafter with rec-
 ommendations for amendments.  The
 Federal Reserve Board has done so, and
 H.R. 7371, as reported, embodies many of
 those amendments.

 This contrasts with a 50 percent increase in
 students.
 in the past five years, the faculty has
 increased 37 percent, contrasting with the
 25 percent growth in students.  .
 In the ten years, the average faculty salary
 has increased almost 96 percent; average
 compensation, including fringe benefits, has
 increased 118 percent, more than double.
 to  the last five years, the average salary
 has been improved by 41 percent, average
 compensation by 51 percent.
 Curricular changes in the college include
 strengthening the upper division offerings in
 many departments; installation of the three-
 to-five year concept as the normal time to
 complete requirements for the Reed degree,
 Increasing the number of inter-departmental
 rouses; establishment of basic guide lines
 for research institutes, and advanced degrees
 in subject matter areas; and increased em-
 phasis on the improvement of secondary
 school education, including the Reed master
 of arts in teaching program.
 FINANCIAL SUPPORT INCREASED
 Under President Sullivan's administration,
 financial support of the college reached un-
 precedented heights.. In 1956, financial sup-
 port was approximately $218,000 for all pur-
 poses; this year the figure will exceed $600,-
 000, plus government grants. The total sup-
 port received during the last decade exceeds
 $8,460,000, excluding all government grants,
 which have amounted to $3,890,000 during
 this period.

 Canada, India, and Poland, could act only
 by unanimous vote in cases involving viola-
 tions of the territory covered by the agree-
 ments.  This ' veto in the hands of a Com-
 munist representative was an instrument for
 sabotaging the execution of the agreements.
 As I said, the final declaration issued at
 Geneva in 1954 (subscribed to by neither the
 United States nor South Viet-Nam)  called
 for free elections to unify all of the Viet-
 namese in 1956. Recently Senator FULBRIGHT
 and others have deplored the fact that this
 election was not held.
 The reasons for the refusal of South Viet-
 Nam to acquiesce in the holding of the elec-
 tion were stated by Prime Minister Diem on
 July 16, 1955: "We do not reject the princi-
 ple of elections as a peaceful and democratic
 means to achieve unity.  But elections can
 be one of the foundations of true democracy
 only on the condition that they are ab-
 solutely free.   And we shall be skeptical
 about the possibility of achieving the condi-
 tions of free elections in the north under
 the regime of oppression carried on by the
 Viet Minh."
 The position of South Viet-Nam on this
 point was "sustained by the United Kingdom,
 one of the co-chairmen of the Geneva Con-
 ference.
 Among the stanchest  opponents  of the
 holding of the 1956 election was the then
 Senator John F.'Kennedy, of Massachusetts.
 He issued "a plea that the United States
 never give its approval to the early nation-
 wide elections called for by the Geneva
 Agreement of  1954.   Neither the United
 States nor free Viet-Nam was a party to that
 agreement-and neither the United States
 nor free Viet-Nam is ever going to be a party
 to an election obviously stacked and sub-
 verted in advance, urged upon us by those

 OF TENNESSEE
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, June 6, 1966
 Mr.   QUILLEN.  Mr.  Speaker,  only
 through letters can we here comprehend
 in a small degree what it is like for our
 men who live and fight in a country
 where the terrain and climate are so un-
 like that of our own land.
 Since it is. impossible for us all to go
 to Vietnam and learn firsthand just how
 much is demanded of the men we send
 into battle, I would like to insert a letter
 from one of the young men in my dis-
 trict which relates how he lives over
 there.  I commend his words to your at-
 tention :

 DEAR JOHN: Attached is a complete "pack.
 age" of material sent to more than 10,000
 known "givers" in the state of Connecticut.
 It is our sincere hope that this effort, which
 has been tremendous since all letters have

 ful that results will justify the intense effort
 we have made,

 is done, we can gain further publicity in

 CONNECTICUT PARTNERS
 OF THE ALLIANCE, INC.,
 Greenwich, Conn., May 23, 1966.
 Hon. JOHN S. MONAGAN,
 Member of Congress,
 1314 Longworth Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR  M.    MONAGAN :  Are  you  concerned
 about tomorrow? How many times in recent
 months have you been disturbed by news of
 June
 the inroads being made in this hemisphere
 by those who are striving to destroy the
 hopes, initiative, freedoms, and dignity of
 the individual, and wished that you could
 do something to combat this trend?
 Unfortunately, it takes a lot more than
 wishes and angry words to turn back an
 underground movement of this scope.   It
 takes money-and plenty of it.  A constant
 barrage of political propaganda holding out
 promises which never come true cannot be
 answered by equally empty words.  It is up
 to US to give positive evidence to the frus-
 trated peoples of Latin America that, under
 our system, promises do come true-for those
 who are willing to work!
 The Connecticut Partners of the Alliance
 is a people-to-people, self-help program, un-
 der which our state has joined in a partner-
 ship for progress with the little state of
 Paraiba, in northeast Brazil, an area plagued
 by drought, disease and illiteracy, where the
 average span of life is 32, where only 23 %
 of  all  of  the  elementary school  teachers
 hold high school diplomas and more than
 half of all school children are in the first
 grade.    (For    more  details  see enclosed
 folder).
 As a privately-financed, non-profit, tax-
 exempt organization, Connecticut Partners
 of the Alliance, Inc., is currently working
 with leading Paraibans on thirty-nine proj-
 ects, including: a 300-year old hospital; a
 university;  the only pediatrics hospital in
 the northeast (now serving 22 million peo-
 ple) ; two institutes for the blind; emergency
 health and maternity posts;-elementary, high
 and commercial schools;  a home for, the
 aged;  two orphanages and other institu-
 tions.
 In each case, the people have donated their
 labor. At no time have they asked for a
 handout-just a hand.  By giving them this
 hand, the Connecticut Partners are making
 dreams come true, building friendships and
 faith where poverty and fear have long been
 constant companions.  If you still wish you
 could do something definite to help end this
 insidious trend-now is the time!
 Sincerely,
 OGDEN BIGELOW,
 President.
 STATE OF CONNECTICUT,
 EXECUTIVE CHAMn.FRs,
 Hartford, May 16, 1966.
 DEAR FELLOW CITIZENS: Some months ago.
 our Congressional delegation advised me of
 the establishment of the Partners of the
 Alliance under the auspices of the Alliance
 for Progress.  The program asked that each
 of our 50 states join in a partnership for
 progress with a country, a state or an area
 in Latin America, to assist, through personal
 involvement, in building or Completing spe-
 cific projects where, by hard work, the peo-
 ple had demonstrated their determination to
 improve their way of life.
 Connecticut was assigned Paraiba, a state
 whose population  approximates  our  own,
 situated  on the most easternly point  of
 Brazil's northeast. There, the people, frus-
 trated by poverty, were constantly subject
 to subversive  propaganda  setting  forth
 promises which never materialized.
 As Governor, I convened a conference of
 community leaders from all parts of the
 state, and from all walks of life, informed
 them of the program and sought their help
 in selecting six qualified citizens to visit
 Paraiba, meet with outstanding Paraibans
 and evaluate those projects on which Amer-
 ican cooperation would have the greatest
 and most immediate impact.  Shortly there-
 after, the Connecticut Partners of the Al-
 liance, Inc., an independent, tax-free cor-
 poration, was established to implement proj-
 ects which had been accepted by those who
 had gone to Brazil, and by the Board of Di-
 rectors.
