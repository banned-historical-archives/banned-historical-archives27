 THE REVERSAL OF TIE DOCTORS' PLOT
 and
 ITS =DIATE AFTERMATH
 IMPLICATIONS OF REVERSAL
 On 4 April, the much publicized doctors' plot was repudiated?in
 a startling public reversal.    Pravda reported that an investigation
 .committee especially set up for the purpose by the newly-merged USSR
 -Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) under L. P. Beria had,found'that
 officials of the ex-Ministry of State Security (MGB) had used "illegal
 methods" to  extract false confessions from the accused doctors.
 The announcement came at a time when the vigilance campaign,
 which the doctors' plot had touched off, had ground to a halt in the
 wake of the sweeping amnesty decree promulgated` by, the new regime on
 27 March, and at a time when the Communist propaganda machine was
 engaged in an all-out peace offensive.  The arrested doctors were said
 to have been incorrectly accused "without any legal bases whatsoever,"
 and hence they had been released and completely exonerated.  The guilty
 police officials of the investigations section of the former MGB had
 been arrested.  A second brief anouncement made by the Presidium of
 the Supreme Soviet on the same day stated that the decree of 20 January
 awarding the Order of Lenin to Lydia Timashuk, the informer in the
 doctors', plot, had been repealed as incorrect.
 The Pravda announcement contained several extremely interesting
 points.  The number of accused doctors had been increased from the
 nine named in January to fifteen; and, of the six names added, none
 were Jewish, clearly implying that the original doctors' plot expose
 had carried anti-Semitic overtones.  Furthermore, the announcement
 came so suddenly that an article in the March issue of Young Communist,
 which was distributed on the very day of the reversal, strongly at-
 tacked foreign espionage, especially American, and called for vigi-
 lance against foreign penetration in the same violent language that
 had been characteristic of the vigilance campaign; it praised Lydia
 Timashuk as an outstanding example of revolutionary vigilance.  It is
 interesting to note that the listing of the released doctors did not
 include two of the original nine, M. B. Kogan and Y. G. Etinger.  Kogan
 was believed to have died in 1951 and hence had probably never been
 arrested, while Etinger, according to the US Embassy in Moscow, was
 rumored to have died during incarceration.
 The announcement, of course, centered attention on Beria.  It was
 made under the auspices of the Ministry (MVD) he had so recently

 inherited.  Furthermore, Pravda's main editorial on the reversal, in
 an almost exact repetition of a statement contained in'Beria's funeral
 speech, promised-that the government would respect the constitutional
 rights of - Soviet citizens.  This statement in Beria's speech is the
 only known allusion in the recent past to the Government's regard for
 the constitutional rights of its citizens, a fact that is particularly
 interesting, since Soviet domestic propaganda generally avoids all
 reference to the individual and his rights and generally treats the
 constitution as a symbol of the power of the State or a guarantee of
 material benefits.  Thus, the Pravda editorial appeared to indicate
 that Beria had been a prime motivating force in the release of the
 doctors, and to imply that he had been considering this move at the
 time of the funeral..J/  Beria's role in the reversal was further sug-
 gested by a UP dispatch cleared by the Moscow censors on 7 April at-
 tributing the release of the doctors "to the personal intervention of
 Deputy Premier L. P. Beria as soon as he took over the newly-combined
 Ministry of State Security and Internal Affairs."
 25X1
 The American Embassy in Moscow commented that the reversal pro-  -
 vided concrete evidence of the new regime's break with the old, since
 Stalin had either fully approved of, or personally engineered, the
 "revelation" of the plot.  The embassy added that this disclosure in- 25X1
 dicated that some high-level controversy existed or had recently been
 concluded in the Soviet Union, but suggested that recent events indi-
 ated Malenkov and Beria were operating harmoniously.
 On 6 April Pravda levied a critical attack against S. D. Ignatiev,
 identifying him as being the responsible MGB minister at the time of
 the arrest of the doctors.  On the following day the Central Committee
 met in plenary session and removed Ignatiev from his post as Party
 Secretary, in which he had been confirmed?.as recently as 20 March, when
 the results of the Central Committee meeting of 14 March (which had
 rearranged the Secretariat) were finally-published.  He was thus re-
 moved less than three weeks after he was publicly confirmed in the
 post.
 Malenkov, on the other hand, in his funeral speech mentioned the
 necessity of continuing the vigilance campaign maintaining that
 it was necessary to train the Soviet people in "a spirit of high
 political vigilance" to be directed against "internal and external
 enemies."

 The US Embassy in Moscow commented that the 7 April meeting re-
 moving Ignatiev-may have afforded an opportunity to Central Committee
 members, possibly for the first time,--to discuss the background of
 the plot affair  The embassy further observed that Beria, as a mem-
 ber of a minority race himself, might presumably be identified with
 the policy-of racial equality which began with the reversal of the
 charges against the.doctors.  In the embassy's opinion, this new
 policy might have been a reflection on Malenkov, who was rumored to
 be personally anti-Semitic (Malenkov's alleged anti-Semitism, often
 rumored, remains unconfirmed).
 On 10 April Izvestia promised its readers that persons found
 guilty of falsely accusing the fifteen Soviet doctors and attempting
 to foment racial prejudice in the Soviet Union would be justly pun-
 ished.                     This had its conclusion on 22 May when N. N. Vasilev, Minister
 of State Control of the RSFSR, stated thai the Soviet Government had
 punished such guilty officials as Ryumin, the former Deputy Minister
 of State Security, who was accused of helping to fabricate the doc-
 tors' plot.  The nature of the punishment was not revealed.  This
 announcement was extremely unusual, in that it was made not by the
 Security Ministry itself but by a Republican minister of the Ministry
 of State Control.
 On the same day, the Soviet press criticized officials of the
 Georgian Republic and, in what appeared to be a veiled attack on
 Stalin, sharply criticized those who resort to "cne-man rule" as
 opposed to "internal party democracy"; it added that no man possessed
 the knowledge and capabilities of collective leadership.  On 8 May
 the leading editorial of the Georgian newspaper, Zara Vostoka,
 ,linked Ryumin with Rukhadze, a former Georgian MGB Minister who was
 currently being accused of fabricating the charges in the 1951-52
 purges in Georgia.  The editorial charged that Ryumin, as well as
 Rukhadze, had fabricated the evidence against the Georgian leaders
 in this earlier purge, and accused Rukhadze of "trying to arouse dis-
 content among the Soviet peoples" and of attempting to "stir up feel-
 ings of racial hatred."
 The doctors' plot reversal also served, at least temporarily,
 to bring what was left of the vigilance campaign to a clos

 In summary, then, the whole reversal procedure looked like a
 bid on the part of Beria and at least some of the other Soviet leaders
 to ingratiate themselves with the Soviet people.  In addition, Beria
 was probably anxious to remove the dread stigma attached to his name
 throughout the Soviet Union by virtue of his connections with the
 police.  The reversal may likewise have prefaced a complete house-
 cleaning of any old MB leaders who might have switched allegiance
 from Beria to Ignatiev when the latter moved into the MB in August
 1951 under the direction of Stalin and probably Malenkov as well.
 GOVERNMENTAL REORGANIZATION IN REGIONAL REPUBLICS
 The exoneration of the Moscow doctors was followed shortly
 by a complete reorganization of the Georgian Party and Government
 apparatus, which reversed the purge that had occurred in that area
 during 1951 and 1952.  When the new Chairman of the Council of
 Ministers in Georgia, V. M. Bakradze, presented the new government,
 he stated that all its members were from the Georgian Party organi-
 zation, formerly led by "the best son of Georgia, the intelligent
 pupil of Lenin, the comrade of Stalin, the illustrious official
 of the Communist Party in the great Soviet Government -- Comrade
 Beria."  He declared that three of the new members of the Georgian
 Council of Ministers had been falsely charged and arrested in the
 fall of 1951 in the case fabricated by the former MGB Chief in
 Georgia, Rukhadze.  Two former First Secretaries of the Georgian
 Party, Charkviani and Mgeladze, had not only failed critically to
 examine Rukhadze's fabrications, but had even abetted them.  Bakradze
 indicated that directives from "All-Union" organs had.freed the three
 innocent officials as well as others who had been implicated and, as a

 demonstration of their rehabilitation, Bakradze had included them in
 the.. new Council of Ministers.
 One of the most notable aspects of this Georgian reorganization
 was the appointment of V. G. Dekanozov as Minister of the MVD.
 Dekanozov had been the Soviet Ambassador in Berlin at the time of
 Germany's attack en the USSR.  He was at one time Deputy Minister of
 Foreign Affairs-of-the USSR, and after the war he served as Deputy
 Chief of the Directorate of Soviet Property Abroad.  This Directorate,
 under V. N. Merkulov, had charge of Soviet assets in Germany and the
 European Satellites.  Prior to entering the Foreign Ministry Dekanozov,
 a Georgian, had long been associated with Beria, particularly in the
 period from 1929 to 1935 in the Georgian security apparatus. F
 In 1951 and 1952 the Georgian political leadership had been
 publicly criticized for corruption and for encouraging local rather
 than national patriotism.  Beria himself had attended the Georgian
 Party meeting on 1 April 1952, which had marked the high point of
 the purges and which had replaced among others the top Party Secre-
 tary.  The changes made appeared to reflect on the position of Beria,
 who had long been considered to have, along with Stalin, a personal
 interest and responsibility for Georgian affairs.
 The undoing of the earlier Georgian purge provided a further
 reason for questioning Malenkov's role:  if he, under Stalin (as is
 thought probable), played a part in these earlier developments in
 Georgia, then the current exoneration of Beria's men was another
 indication of Malenkov's lack of control.  The picture, however, was
 far from complete.  Some top Georg ian Party officials wh
 appear to be long-time era as-
 sociates, were still numbered among the ranks of those vur2ed.
 Further, the Georgian Party Congress originally scheduled for 26 May
 had not been held as of early July.  Its convocation had been an-
 nounced on 14 April at the time of the Georgian Party and Government
 reorganization and presumably it was scheduled to confirm the changes
 which had taken place in the Party apparatus.  In spite of these in-
 consistencies, however, it rppeared certain that Beria had played a
 major role in the reversal, particularly since Bakradze had re-
 ferred only to him in his discussion of the government reorganization
 and had not mentioned Malenkov once.  This pattern, with one curious
 exception when Malenkov was singled out for attention, was to be
 followed in the Georgian press, which extolled Beria in extremely
 flowery terms.

 The pattern of Beria worship in the Transcaucasus was far from
 complete, however.  An'opposite cult was noted in Azerbaijan where
 Bagirov, the newly-named Premier, told the Azerbaijan Supreme Soviet
 that the people would rally around Malenkov, "the closest comrade of
 Stalin."  Bagirov's procedure in assuming the Azerbaijan Premiership
 resembled that followed by Malenkov in the central government in that
 Bagirov also relinquished his position on the Party Secretariat upon
 assuming the office of Premier.  This unusual procedure of two new
 regional premiers'picking two different Soviet leaders as their patrons
 added to the mounting indications that the Soviet leadership was in-
 deed collegial in form.  It indicated that the regional participants
 were either choosing the leader they would like most to be identified
 with at that time"or standing by their previous patrons on the
 grounds that it would be foolhardy to abandon them at this late date.
 Bagirov, who had aligned himself with Malenkov, had had an
 earlier association with Beria and in fact at one time had been
 Beria's superior in police affairs in Azerbaijan.  In his history of
 Transcaucasian Party affairs, however, he had failed to glorify Beria,
 suggesting that his relations with him were not too favorable.
 Bagirov had been accorded unusual recognition in the Party reorgani-
 zation of 6 March when he was moved ahead of twenty-two members of
 the ex-Party Presidium to become an alternate member of the new Party
 Presidium.  Bagirov had also long been a vocal advocate of Stalin's
 Russification policy, which at the time of his appointment as Azer-
 baijani Premier appeared to have been at least temporarily shelved.
 INTERNAL MEASURES TO EASE TENSION
 While the regional republics were setting their houses in order
 in reorganizations patterned after the All-Union model, the Central
 Government was enacting measures designed to ease internal tensions
 and to popularize itself with the Soviet people:
 1.  On 27 March the amnesty decree was issued.
 2.  On 1 April the annual decree on price cuts announced
 the largest reductions made in four years.
 3.  April and May messages provided indications that pro-
 duction of consumer goods was being increased.
 4.  The 1953 announcement of the annual State loan was
 delayed until late June and the loan itself was only half as
 large as those of 1951 and 1952.

 5.  On 18 May, wheat flour was placed on daily sale in Moscow
 State stores, ending the four-day-a-year sale system in practice
 since World War  II.  On the same day in an unprecedented step, the
 Government announced a bargain clearance sale with twenty-five per-
 cent price cuts for the remainder of May and June in State stores.
 The American Embassy in Moscow noted that the local population
 showed a lively interest in the amnesty decree, which the Embassy as-
 sumed would affect directly more than two million people.  It commented
 that the absence of any reference to Stalin in Soviet news coverage
 was apparently designed to give the new regime full credit for the
 amnesty. The wording of this decree, which had preceded the doctors'
 plot reversal by about seven days, contrasted sharply with previous
 emphasis on the need for internal security.
 25X1
 The consumer goods price reductions which went into effect on 1 April
 were the most extensive since those of 1 May 1950.  The list of price
 cuts also included a number of manufactured items on which prices had
 not been reduced in recent years.  The greatest cut however was the fifty
 percent reduction in the price of fresh fruits and vegetables.

 The Soviet announcement of the 1953 State loan was not made until
 late June.
 The announcement, when
 finally made, called for a State loan only half as large as those of
 1951 and 1952.  This suggested that the regime had gone even further
 than previously indicated in shifting resources from heavy industry
 production to consumer goods, since the loan is as much a means of
 limiting consumer purchasing power as of obtaining funds for "develop-
 ment" of the national economy.
 As though anticipating the possibility that the retail price cuts
 might signify the end of the farmers' market, a Pravda editorial of
 6 June entitled "Soviet Trade" reassured Russia's peasantry that such
 would not be the case.  In the editorial numerous writers were criticized
 for having been solely or mainly preoccupied with the transition to a
 moneyless economic system based on the exchange of products and for
 having therefore neglected the vital problems of trade in its present
 form.  This, said the editorial, "means an underestimate, which in theory
 is wrong and in practice harmful, of the enormous role trade plays in
 Soviet economy."  The Government and Party would "in the coming his-
 torical period" continue to develop trade -- that is to say, exchange
 based on money.  This editorial is of further significance in that
 those criticized were, after all, only elaborating the propositions
 offered by Stalin in the Economic Problems of Socialism.

 EXTERNAL MEASURES TO REDUCE TENSION
 The policy of reducing tension at home had its counterpart in the
 field of foreign affairs.  After Stalin's death, the two plane incidents
 of the 12th and 15th of March had caused a considerable increase in
 international tension.  On 21 March came the first indication that the
 propaganda line had switched.  On this date, Soviet media resumed normal
 coverage of internal and external news, understandably lacking in the
 period following Stalin's death.  When this occurred, it was noted that
 articles on foreign affairs resumed anti-US charges, but with consider-
 able restraint.  A 21 March commentary on the possibility of peaceful
 coexistence of capitalism and socialism recalled the "vigorous coopera-
 tion" of the US, UK and USSR during World War II and the "splendid re-
 sults" of that cooperation in the common victory over the enemy.  Pre-
 viously Soviet propaganda had insisted that the Red Army had won the
 World War II victory singlehanded.

 Another instance of what was to become a concerted Soviet drive
 to reduce international tension was seen on 25 March when the USSR
 granted visas to ten US newspaper and radio editors to visit Moscow
 for one week.

 to get on friendlier terms with the West, which appeared to occur in
 discernible phases.  From late March until late April, Soviet policy was
 characterized principally by an attempt to ease tensions with the West
 at the least possible cost to the  USSR.  This involved improved personal
 relations with Western diplomats, some relaxation of the previously vig-
 orous internal Soviet security measures, moderation of language in. Soviet
 speeches and official statements, and release of some Western civilians
 interned in Korea.  These changes reflected primarily a relaxation in

 the previously extreme Soviet behavior in these matters, rather than
 any sort of basic change in Soviet foreign policy and, as many out-
 side observers were to remark, it seemed as though Soviet leaders had
 decided to reduce the international tension by "ten degrees" or so.
 The quantitative scope of these demonstrations of friendliness suggested
 that a formal directive had gone out, presumably through foreign minis-
 try channels.
 In mid-4pril the foreign policy ir;*-iative passed to the United
 States with President Eisenhower's 16 April speech.  The extremely
 favorable reception with which the world greeted this US policy
 declaration had the effect of throwing the burden for further peace
 moves on the Soviet Union   On 25 April Soviet leaders answered the
 President's speech in a Pravda article, which did not actually reveal
 any basic change in Soviet foreign policy.  Both Ambassador Bohlen and
 the British Foreign Office noted that the reply betrayed a certain
 amount of indecision and uncertainty on the part of its authors.  Am-
 bassador Bohlen also noted that the article's length and its rather
 unsettled reasoning precluded its becoming an effective propaganda
 vehicle.  Analysis of subsequent Soviet propaganda revealed that, while
 Pravda's reply was widely broadcast within the USSR, it was not treated
 as an instrument of propaganda.
 The first positive, coordinated inter-Orbit move designed to
 reca'ture the propaganda initiative for the USSR was Molotov's response
 to tht. Five Power Peace Pact proposal made by the Paris Commission of
 the  WPC on 27 April.  On the same day, the Bulgarian Presidium endorsed
 the proposal, as did Chinese Foreign Minister Chou En-lai on the 28th.
 This was followed by general Satellite approval.  Curiously enough, the
 full meeting of the WPC, which occurred in mid-June in Budapest, played
 down the Five Power Peace Pact theme.  Pierre Cot, in one of the last
 speeches at the Congress, explained this action by saying that the
 Five Power Peace Pact had not been abandoned, but that the Congress did
 not want to place obstacles in the way of any negotiations among any
 group of powers.
 Beginning in late April, Soviet tactics began to reflect.a shift
 toward the use of diplomacy as the principal means of lowering the
 international temperature.  In relations with individual countries that
 had previously been targets of propaganda, vilification and diplomatic
 threats, the USSR began to display a more conciliatory attitude.  This
 was followed eventually by a retreat on the diplomatic level from some
 long standing Soviet positions.  Two examples which might be used to
 portray this development are Yugoslavia and Turkey.  On 30 April, for
 the first time since 1948, Foreign Minister Molotov received the Yugo-
 slav Charge in Moscow.  On 9 June Molotov told the charge that the USSR
 intended to raise the status of its diplomatic representation in Belgrade

 to ambassadorial level and hoped that Yugoslavia would reciprocate.
 This overture on Molotov's part was subsequently realized.  Another
 example of the new tactic was the 30 May Soviet note to Turkey, in
 which the USSR expressed optimism over the possibility of finding
 a mutually acceptable solution to the Dardanelles question and aban-
 doned its "territorial claims against Turkey."
 The record of such recent developments in Soviet foreign policy
 has been widely covered elsewhere and it is not thought advisable to
 record these events chronologically in this paper.  The decision to
 reduce international tension was undoubtedly approved by the new I
 Soviet leaders before being put into operation by Molotov in his role
 as custodian of Soviet foreign affairs.  He had beer publicly iden-
 tified with this approach since l 'April, ? when he endorsed l;iiou  ,n-lai's
 POW concession, although at that time Molotov insisted that the Communist
 stand on repatriation was still firma  While Stalin's Bolshevik article
 had contained the necessary theoretical justification for these maneu-
 vers and while various foreign Communists attributed them to the arti-
 cle, their timing made It difficult to escape the conclusion that they
 had been brought about as a result of Stalin's death.
 The USSR, up to Stalin's death and in the period immediately
 following, had lapsed into a rigid position, a sort of go-it-alone
 policy with regard to international relations in which the atmosphere
 of compromise, reconciliation and negotiation was completely absent.
 Thus, in addition to the conclusion that these preliminary moves were
 made to keep the international situation fluid and to promote a period
 of international relaxation while problems of Soviet leadership were
 thrashed out at home, they suggest that with Stalin's passing a more
 realistic and perhaps more effective Soviet foreign policy was to come
 into play.  Such a policy may well have been in the minds of the ma-
 jority of Soviet leaders, but ruled out by Stalin in the last years
 of his life.
 Korea has been the only real concession to date.  The compromise
 agreement at  Panmunjom on 8 June represented a Communist retreat
 from a position which had been proclaimed domestically and internation-
 ally as final.  The relevance of this compromise to the policy change
 in the USSR was, of course, obscured by Chinese involvement in the
 issue and the problem of Sino-Soviet relations in the period following'
 Stalin's death.
 In summary, there have been no outward signs that the new atmos-
 phere of detente was unacceptable to a portion of the Soviet leader-
 ship, or that it had in fact entered into a struggle for' leadership.
 The reduction of international tension would seem to be a policy at-
 tractive to all Soviet contenders in.their bids for internal power.

 In the background, of course, the possibility always remained that
 some leader would use the international arena to solidify his posi-
 tion with the Soviet masses.  In this respect, Molotov would appear
 to have the advantage.
 The foreign policy problem, however, was at a later date to become
 much more acute with respect to the delicate question of Germany.  At
 this point, over-all Soviet foreign policy, policy toward the Satellites,
 jurisdictional control in Germany, and individual personalities exer-
 cising the control were to merge in the first big test of the new
 regime.  Meanwhile, however, there were more internal developments
 affecting the general pattern of the Soviet leadership.
 MAY DAY SLOGANS AS BAROMETER OF POLICY
 The May Day slogans published on 21 April represented a consider-
 able change from those issued for the 7 November 1952 anniversary.  There
 was increased emphasis on "peaceful coexistence."  In addition, Soviet
 workers were called on to strengthen the "fraternal friendship among
 peoples of our country" and "increasingly to strengthen the unity of
 the great Soviet many-peopled State," in what appeared to be an al-
 lusion to the doctors' plot reversal.  One novel slogan affirmed that
 the "rights of Soviet citizens, guaranteed by our Constitution, are
 unshakable and are defended as sacred by the Soviet Government."  This
 was another repetition of Beria's remarks on this subject at Stalin's
 funeral.  Another slogan admonished employees of State institutions
 strictly to observe "socialist legality and take a sensitive attitude
 towards workers' inquiries."  Finally, the de-emphasis of Stalin was
 continued.  His name occurred only twice in the slogans.
 The constitution was referred to as the Soviet Constitution rather
 than the Stalin Constitution and the Komsomol, instead of being the
 "Lenin-Stalin Komsomol," was now called the "All-Union Lenin Communist
 Union of Youth."  This was in contrast to the pattern in Czechoslovakia,
 for example, where one slogan used the name of the recently-deceased
 Gottwald ten times, referring to the "Gottwald Five-Year Plan," and
 so on.
 Malenkov, unlike Zapotocky in Czechoslovakia, was not mentioned
 in the slogans, nor for that matter were Beria and Molotov.  However,
 quotations from both Beria and Malenkov were employed.  The avoidance
 of names of both past and present leaders, together with the new empha-
 sis on unity of the people, the Party and the Government, reinforced
 the current Soviet propaganda line that the USSR.was experiencing rule
 of the Party by its leaders acting jointly rather than rule of an
 individual.

 German and Czech slogans, which were issued before Soviet slogans,
 greeted Malenkov by name as did slogans in Albania, Viet Nam and North
 Korea.  In Rumania, one of the slogans was a direct quotation from
 Malenkov's funeral speech.  The Hungarian and Polish slogans, issued
 after the USSR's, failed to mention Malenkov and, in Poland, the slo-
 gan dealing with the constitution appeared to be modified in conformity
 with,Beria's statement on the subject.
 In the Satellites in general, and Poland and  Hungary in particu-
 lar, Malenkov received no unusual prominence.  In Warsaw pictures of
 Prime Minister Bierut predominated, with those of Stalin in second place.
 In Budapest the usual triumvirate of Lenin, Stalin and Rakosi was played
 up and Malenkov's picture was actually seen on only three buildings.
 In China
 the groups passing the reviewing stand were urged to cheer Mao
 Tse-tung and no one else, and that images of Mao were particularly
 prominent, whereas portraits of Malenkov were featured only in the
 company of other foreign Communist leaders and were generally given
 second rank behind the Chinese.  The 55 slogans issued by Peiping for
 use on May Day did not mention the Soviet Premier, and Mao Tse-tung
 replaced Stalin in the place of honor in Chinese propaganda.
 The key address in the Soviet Union on 1 May, which was made by
 Bulganin, was in the vein of the Pravda reply to President Eisenhower.
 While the language was far less bellicose than usual, Bulganin asked
 for Western "deeds" to match the "peaceful statements" of its leaders.
 In published listings of the Presidium, Malenkov was in first place,
 followed by Beria, Molotov, Voroshilov, Khrushchev, Bulganin, Kagano-
 vich, Mikoyan, Saburov and Pervukhin.
 READJUSTMENTS REFLECTING PECULIAR NATURE OF SOVIET LEADERSHIP
 Meanwhile, a series of disconnected and in some cases inexplicable
 developments occurred, which were of interest because of their bearing
 on the Soviet leadership and the policy of that leadership.  Cumulatively,
 they suggested that a delicate balance was being maintained as the tri-
 umvirate moved their human chess players across the board.
 1.  On 11 April, G. M. Orlov was awarded the Order of Lenin
 on his 50th anniversary.  The practice of making this award to
 deserving Soviet leaders at this stage in their careers is'not
 unusual. However,                                              the
 award to Orlov recalled the surprise which his retention in the
 new Soviet Gorvernment as Minister of the Timber and Paper Indus-
 25X1 C                       try had caused.  Orlon                        had been one of the most

 12 February, had suffered a new wave of criticism for inefficiency
 in his ministry.  Orlov was a former NKVD official who had at one

 2.  On 19 April, Soviet newspapers announced the appointment
 of First Deputy Foreign  Minister  Y. A. Malik as Soviet Ambassador
 to Great Britain.  In effect, he changed places with A. A. Gromyko,
 the incumbent ambassador in London, who nuw Ueeame a First Deputy
 Minister of Foreign Affairs.  The significance of this shift was
 unknown, but it was an unusual one since it evidently was another
 of those appointments not contemplated at the time of the 6 March
 reorganization.  It suggested that second echelon personnel were
 beginning to be moved around in connection with the intricacies of
 collective leadership, and that the original reorganization of the
 government was far from final as the components of the triumvirate
 moved to solidify their positions.

 5.  On 29 April, the appointment of I. A. Benediktov as Soviet
 Ambassador to India, was announced.  Benediktov had little back-
 ground in foreign affairs, his experience having been almost com-
 pletely in the field of agriculture.  He had served agriculture
 in various positions since 1938, when he had been appointed People's
 Commissar of Collective Farms.   In 1946 he had been appointed
 Minister of Agriculture.  During the 19th Party Congress, when he
 was re-elected a full member of the Central Committee, he was sub-
 jected to some criticism for various failures by his ministry.  In
 March he had lost his ministerial appointment when the newly-merged
 Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement had been placed under the
 leadership of the relatively obscure central apparatus functionary,
 A. I. Kozlov.  The Benediktov ambassadorial appointment was the
 second example of a man with no foreign office experience receiving
 an important diplomatic post.  The first had been V. V. Kuznetsov
 (appointed ambassador to China on 10 March) who, by virtue of certain
 aspects of his career and primarily his WFTU connections, was thought
 to be connected with Malenkov.  Beneedikt,.J's association in agricul-
 ture must have thrown him into association with Malenkov also, but
 perhaps this may not have been a pleasant one due to the peculiar
 role of the Party in agricultural affairs.  Benediktov had also
 been associated with A. A. Andreev as his first assistant during
 the war.  Lastly and perhaps most curiously,. Benediktov, who various
 sources agreed was a good administrator                                       25X1
 to be particularly friendly with
 Molotov.
 6.  On 1 May Bulganin reviewed the May Day parade.  This
 coupled with the fact that he had represented the Soviet Union
 at Gottwald's funeral suggested that he was being used as a non-
 partisan representative of the Soviet leadership.
 7.  On 6 May, a Pravda editorial entitled "Lmprove the Economic
 Indices in the Work of Enterprises" stated that "the reorganization
 of administrative machinery and particularly the enlargement of
 ministries and the considerable enlargement of ministers' powers
 are helping to raise the level of guidance of all economic activity
 . . . and to institute more flexible and effective planning of
 production."  Although the editorial went on to depict the con-
 tinuing role of the Party in focusing its attention on improving
 the economic activity of various enterprises, it clearly implied
 that the powers of Government officials had been strengthened.  An

 earlier Pravda article of 27 April also had pointed out that the
 25X1
 25X1
 wider authority of the ministers was aimed at bringing a closer
 rapprochement between the State apparatus and the people.
 $.  On 17 May, a Soviet regional broadcast announced that the
 Kazak Republic Publishing House had issued in Kazakh the second
 edition of the brochure on Beria's address at the 19th Party Con-
 gress of the Communist Party and stated that 50,000 copies had
 already been published.  This is the only known Soviet broadcast
 referring to this type of subject since Stalin's death.
 10.  On 2 June the British Ambassador to the USSR held a re-
 ception to mark the Queen's Coronation.  All the leading Soviet
 leaders including Malenkov had been invited to attend.  Molotov,
 however, was the only man of Presidium rank to put in an appear-
 ance.                            This was in keeping with the trend noted earlier at recep-
 tions given by the East Germans and Czechs, which only Molotov and
 Mikoyan attended.
 11.  On 4 June, the US Embassy in Moscow relayed a rumor
 that P. K. Pon~omarenko had been appointed Central Committ   Secre-
 tary to fill the vacancy created by Ignatiev's dismissal.                25X1
 I                                                      Ialso relieved
 that     anov, the former USSR Minister of Higher    ~n. had
 taken Ponomarenko's place as  Minister of Culture. 25X1
 25X1
 Ponomarenko, as mentioned previously, was thought
 to be in the Malenkov camp.   If this were true and if Ponomarenko
 had not been bought off in the interim, his return to the Secre-
 tariat, which he had vacated on 6 March, would seem to reflect
 favorably on Malenkov.  Curiously enough, the example of the USSR
 cabinet, where former Party Secretary Ponomarenko had taken over
 the Ministry of Culture, had been followed at least in the Ukrainian,
 Moldavian and Karelo Finnish cabinets.  In each of these, the new
 Minister of Culture was drawn directly from the Party Secretariat
 or had formerly been associated with it.  This procedure was par-

 ticularly noteworthy because it occurred despite the fact that
 both A. M. Lazarev and I. I. Tsvetkov, the Moldavian and Karelo-
 Finnish officials, had been criticized in September 1952, while
 the status of K. Z. Litvin, the new Ukrainian Minister of Culture,
 had apparently been declining since 1950.
 13.  On 23  May, the Soviet press published a curious article
 by the controversial economist, Varga, which appeared on the sur-
 face to be, like the Stalin Bolshevik article, purely propagandis-
 tic in tone.  In effect, it represented another recantation on
 Varga's part of his 1947 position that in times of crisis the
 State could and would act contrary to  the desires of the monopo-
 lies for maximum profits and in the interests of the bourgeoisie.
 Varga revised this stand and accepted Stalin's view that the,
 monopolies had taken control of the State.  Varga, however, was
 able to maintain at least by inference his 1947 theory that the
 expected (1948) post-war crisis would be a temporary one and that
 the serious cyclical crisis of capitalism would come perhaps ten
 years after the war.  He did this in his statement regarding the
 coming market crisis, particularly as accentuated by the re-entry
 of Japan and Germany into world markets.  This view, of course,
 was in complete conformity with Stalin's position.  Western ob-
 servers had been waiting for some clue as to the possibility of
 change in Soviet economic policy.  Yet Varga's article restated
 the general estimate set forth by Stalin.  It made a bid for the
 relaxation of COCOM controls, but this was certainly not unusual.
