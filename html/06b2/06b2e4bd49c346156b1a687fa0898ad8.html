 WASHINGTON POST
 26 January 1986
 Jonas Savimbi:
 Big Welcome
 for a Bad Bet
 By Sanford J. Ungar
 N AFRICAN guerrilla leader named
 A Jonas Savimbi will arrive in Washing-
 ton 1 ton this week on a tour aimed at
 gaining U.S. support for his guerrilla war
 against the Soviet-backed regime in Angola.
 His goal, in simple terms, is to become
 America's "contra" in Africa.
 Savimbi is a charismatic African politi-
 cian. But his guerrilla movement cannot win
 and he does not deserve U.S. financial sup-
 port or sympathy.
 Savimbi's march on Washington this
 meek hia   is his astonishing trans orma-
 tion from.Chinese-support  revo u tonary
 to conservative-backed-  re om tighter.
 Bttrel six years ago he cou  not get an
 intment even with the assistant secre-
 ty             state or  ncan a airs,   cause
 congress had passed a law forbidding
 American covert involvement wi t'Gis
 forces in the Angolan civil war. But this
 week, Savimbi has an excellent chance for a
 private meeting with President Reagan in
 the Oval Office.
 The Clark Amendment, which prevented
 his forces from gaining American aid, was
 repealed last year. So now he will be pa-
 raded through Congress as the American
 candidate for leadership not only of Angola,
 but perhaps all of southern Africa. He will
 be portrayed as the one man who can give
 Cuban troops a bloody nose and help re-
 store American influence and prestige
 there. Tonight, Savimbi's new high profile
 will be evident to 40 million viewers in a
 scheduled appearance on CBS's "Sixty
 Minutes."
 The. trouble is that Savimbi simply isn't
 what his best American friends believe or
 wish he could be. "Savimbi is a master at
 telling people what they want to hear." says
 John Marcum, professor of political science
 at the University of California at Santa Cruz
 and one of the leading U.S. experts on An-
 gola, "He has a quality of delivering a mes-
 sage in a way that pleases the ear of the
 listener."
 Today that skill is being used to court
 American support, but in the past it has
 been employed to stir up sentiment against
 the United States.
 Furthermore, Savimbi built much of his
 power base by overtly appealing to black-
 nationalist attitudes and antiwhite bias
 among some of Angola's tribal groups. His
 tactics are every bit as brutal and repres-
 sive as those of the government now in
 power in Angola - if not more so.
 He has proudly claimed to have attacked
 the installations of American and other
 Western companies. And he has lost most of
 his support from other African nations by
 collaborating with the white minority re-
 gime in South Africa.
 Besides, UNITA is far from winning. In
 fact, U.S. aid to Savimbi now would prolong
 rather than shorten the Angolan war, and it
 would increase rather than end the Cuban
 presence in Angola.
 The United States has no business taking
 a position on either side of this civil war.
 There is little in Angola's internal conflict
 that has anything to do with American na-
 tional interests. And the risks are many.
 Funding Savimbi now would put the United
 States into a de facto military alliance with
 South Africa. That would violate the de-
 clared policy of the Reagan administration
 and would also alienate America's good
 friends elsewhere in Africa.
 I have met Jonas Savimbi during his pre-
 vious visits to the United States, and I
 have been greatly impressed with his
 political and rhetorical skills. He is a gen-
 uinely charismatic figure whose eyes seem
 alive with fire when he talks of the struggle
 in Angola. He speaks superb English (along
 with, it is said, Portuguese, French, and
 several other languages), and he is partic-
 ularly adept at playing to the American fear
 of Fidel Castro, whose troops prop up
 Savimbi's enemy.
 Other journalists who have visited him in
 the bush inside Angola - it is easy to ar-
 range trips from South Africa or Namibia on
 South African planes - have been even
 more dazzled by Savimbi. They have heard
 him give dramatic, spellbinding orations to
 "party congresses" of his supporters, and
 they have been taken with his apparent will-
 ingness to stay at his fighters' side in their
 most difficult moments - rather than
 spending much of his time in fancy restau-
 rants. in European capitals, as the leaders of
 other Third World nationalist movements
 have sometimes been known to do.
 Nonetheless, it is one thing to recognize
 the mystique of Jonas Savimbi and quite
 another to commit American prestige -
 and deficit financing - to his cause. Those
 who would bankroll him as an American
 surrogate in southern Africa would do well
 to examine the recent history of Angola and
 Savimbi's own record.
 STATI
 S avimbi's involvement in the tangled
 politics and the violent struggle for
 control of Angola goes back to the ear-
 ly 1960s. That was more than 10 years be-
 fore the country became independent, fol-
 lowing a revolution in Lisbon, and was
 thrust into the unenviable position of a
 pawn in the East-West struggle. Although
 many students of African politics see
 Savimbi as an opportunist who adjusts his
 ideology to the needs of the moment, most
 still recognize him as a genuine Angolan
 nationalist - a man whose record and cre-
 dentials as an opponent of colonialism en-
 title him to some role in his country's fu-
 ture.
 A member of the Ovimbundu tribe (which
 makes up about a third of Angola's popula-
 tion), Savimbi was born in the country's
 central highlands in 1934 to a family that
 one Protestant missionary described as be-
 ing of "exceedingly humble, primitive, pa-
 gan background." Nonetheless, he gradu-
 ated at the top of his high school class, and
 the missionaries, who saw great promise in
 him, sent him to Portugal for advanced
 studies.
 Before long, however, he was being ha-
 rassed by dictator Antonio Salazar's secret
 police for his political activities on behalf of
 Angolan independence, and so he fled to
 Switzerland in 1960, enrolling in the polit-
 ical science department at the University of
 Lausanne.
 According to one State Department doc-
 ument that has frequently been quoted,
 Savimbi turned up at the American Embas-
 sy in Bern early in 1961, declared that he
 had been inspired by a speech by then-Unit-
 ed Nations ambassador Adlai Stevenson in
 favor of self-determination for all peoples of
 the world, and introduced himself as "the
 future president of Angola."
 Within months of making his ambitions
 known to U.S. diplomats, Savimbi had gone
 off to Leopoldville (now Kinshasa), the cap-
 ital of the newly independent Belgian Congo
 (now Zaire), to join Holden Roberto, the

 Savimbi's American
 backers believe that

 leader of a generally pro-Western organi-
 zation called the National Front for the Lib-
 eration of Angola (FNLA).
 The FNLA was being aided and encour-
 aged by the United States as an alternative
 to the Soviet-supported Popular Movement
 for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). (It
 seemed unlikely to the superpowers that
 Portuguese colonial rule could last much
 longer on a continent where so many other
 countries were setting their possessions
 free, and in this period Washington and
 Moscow were characteristically choosing up
 sides among the new and future nations of
 Afica.)
 But in 1964 the rivalry between Roberto
 and Savimbi came to a head, and Savimbi
 broke away from the FNLA. Two years lat-
 er, he brought together his own cadres and
 formed a "third force," UNITA - the Na-
 tional Union for the Total Independence of
 Angola. Savimbi found help from China,
 among others, and UNITA managed to play
 its own unpredictable part in the war
 against the Portuguese.
 As independence approached in 1975, the
 milita  struggle m  ngoo a turned into a
 tri artite civil war among the nations is
 groups, and that doomed the prospect o
 olen    elections. To the surprise o
 outsi e o serv ers, UNITA actua y o -
 ante t o      w e   espite help from
 h e U.S.= Central Intelligence Agency, crum-
 W           before the    viet- an   u an-at MPLA.
 Tea-while,  South Africa, concerned
 about the effects of the civil war on its
 neighboring territory of Namibia, had also
 intervened in Angola. Inevitably, the South
 Africans offered to help Savimbi, and he
 accepted.
 The MPLA managed to establish a gov-
 ernment in Angola's capital of Luanda late
 in 1975, and it has stayed in power since
 then with the support of a Cuban military
 and civilian contingent now estimated at
 between 25,000 and 35,000. But UNITA
 Approved
 has also sustained its guerrilla struggle
 against the MPLA, with money and supplies
 from South Africa, for more than 10 years.
 Savimbi generally claims to control at least
 a third of the area of thq vast country.
 Last year, even as economic sanctions
 were being voted against South Africa,
 hardliners in both houses of Congress were
 successful in getting the law prohibiting
 American involvement in the Angolan civil
 war repealed. Savimbi's American backers
 believe that Angola is a place where the
 United States can stand up to the Soviet
 Union. It is on the strength of these conser-
 vative hopes - that America can get back
 into the fray as a player in Angola - that
 Savimbi is winging to Washington.
 But before Savimbi is allowed to leave
 town triumphantly with a chunk of
 the American treasury, it would be a
 good idea to take a realistic look at the man
 who would be our newest African client.
 Savimbi does not have the credible record
 as a moderate, democratic, pro- American
 figure that is so often cited on his behalf by
 his supporters in both parties here.
 On the contrary, he built his reputation
 during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a
 fervid anti-capitalist, anti-American revo-
 lutionary. No progressive action is possible
 with men who serve American interests ...
 the notorious agents of imperialism," he
 said at the time of his break with Roberto.
 Among his leading supporters in the years
 that followed were Mao Tse-tung, Che
 Guevara, and Gamal Abdel Nasser.
 During those same years, Savimbi drew a
 distinction between his own movement and
 the MPLA on the basis of their racial com-
 position, denouncing the MPLA for its in-
 clusion of, and alleged domination by, white
 radicals and mestizos (people of mixed race)
 who had accepted Portuguese citizenship.
 Roughly one-tenth of the million people
 who live in the capital city of Luanda are
 white or mestizo, and the MPLA regime,
 whatever its other flaws, is multiracial in
 composition. "Given Savimbi's past state-
 ments on racial issues, (the whites and mes-
 tizos) all quiver at the thought of his coming
 to power," says Gerald J. Bender, professor
 of international relations at the University
 of Southern California and an advocate of
 American diplomatic recognition of the An-
 golan government.
 Although Savimbi has been wise enough
 to alter his pro-Marxist, antiwhite rhetoric
 when it is expedient to do so, the UNITA
 slogan remains "Socialism, Negritude, De-
 mocracy, and Nonalignment." No one really
 knows what his policies would be if he were
 to come to power. As The Washington
 Post's Leon Dash reported in 1977 after
 spending seven months with UNITA forces
 in the bush, "Savimbi is an enigma, a man on
 whom many labels can stick - brilliant,
 charismatic, affable, unyielding, forgiving,
 temporizing, Machiavellian, opportunistic,
 lying, nationalistic, Marxist, Maoist, pro-
 Savimbi is miscast as a `freedom fighter"
 defending Westerx ideals against a harsh
 Marxist regime.
 UNITA has in fact been criticized for its
 brutal tactics in the Angolan countryside. In
 classic guerrilla fashion, its acknowledged
 goals are to grind the Angolan economy to a
 halt, prevent development, and destroy ag-
 riculture - all to stir up discontent with
 the government.
 Among the foreigners taken prisoner
 during UNITA attacks in recent years have
 been many missionaries and church- work-
 ers. Just last month, in an incident reported
 by the Brazilian Embassy in Angola and
 three religious organizations, five Baptist
 church workers were killed, three wounded
 and two women carried off by Savimbi's
 men.
 And one of the sharpest ironies of the
 situation in Angola is that the MPLA gov-
 ernment finds that it needs the Cubans to
 help protect Gulf Oil rigs and storage tanks
 from threats by the South Africans and the
 allegedly pro-American UNITA forces.
 Savimbi is not the popular pan-African
 politician that he often claims to be.
 It is true that in the period just after in-
 dependence the Organization of African
 Unity (OAU) was sharply divided on the is-
 sue of whether to recognize the MPLA or
 some FNLA/UNITA coalition as the legit-
 imate government in Angola. But as soon as
 the nature of Savimbi's connections with
 South Africa became known, he lost much
 of his support elsewhere on the continent.
 Savimbi travels to and from Angola pri-
 marily through South Africa and South-
 African-controlled Namibia; his headquar-
 ters in Jamba are only 18. miles from the
 Namibian border. The government in Pre-
 toria is proud of its connection with UNITA,
 claiming that it proves South Africa's ability
 to work with the "right" kind of black Afri-
 can leader. In fact, Savimbi was an honored
 guest at the inauguration of State President
 P. W. Botha in 1984. To this day, most Af-
 rican governments depict Savimbi as a
 South African puppet.
 Further American assistance to Savimbi,
 overt or covert, will not lead to withdrawal of
 the Cuban forces in Angola.
 On the contrary, every South African
 intervention on UNITA's side in the past
 has caused an increase in the number of
 Cubans. There is no reason to think that
 American aid would produce a different re-
 sult. In recent meetings, Angolan President
 Jose Eduardo dos Santos has reportedly
 warned Chester A. Crocker, assistant sec-
 retary of state for African affairs, of that
 fact, and he has frankly asked the Reagan
 administration not to push Angola into a
 greater dependence on the Soviet Union.

 out an infusion of U.S. funds, the Angolah
 civil war is locked in a stalemate.
 Jonas Savimbi's visit to Washington,
 then, has little to do with the real pros-
 pects for peace in southern Africa, and
 a great deal to do with American politics.
 Two significant forces are arrayed on
 Savimbi's side: liberal Democrats who be-
 lieve they have to demonstrate their ability
 to support a tough, anti-Soviet foreign pol-
 icy; and conservative Republicans who, hav-
 ing voted last summer for economic sanc-
 tions against South Africa, have been under
 pressure to take some other persuasive,
 anti-communist steps in the region.
 An example of the former is 85-year-old
 Rep. Claude Pepper (D-Fla.), who has an
 increasing number of anti-Castro Cuban
 exiles in his district demanding he take a
 tougher stand.
 An example of the later is 50-year-old
 Rep. Jack Kemp, (R-N.Y.), who was warned
 by some of his bedrock conservative sup-
 porters that his vote for South African sanc-
 tions could cost him the GOP presidential
 nomination in 1988.
 Pepper and Kemp make an interesting
 coalition, but they are crafting bad foreign
 policy? To be wary of some of what the
 MPLA has done and to wish for an end to
 the Cuban presence in southern Africa does
 not require support for a harsh and unprin-
 cipled guerrilla leader about whom the
 American government and people actually
 know very little. To be skeptical and cau-
 tious with Savimbi does not imply endorse-
 ment of the regime in Luanda.
 ormerly a Portuguese colony,
 F Angola achieved independence in
 1975 after two decades of
 nationalist rebellion and guerrillla
 warfare. By the end of 1976, one of
 the factions - the Popular Movement
 for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) -
 had gained control of the country with
 the aid of Cuban technical and military
 expertise. The MLPA proclaimed
 establishment of the People's Republic
 of Angola and transformed itself into
 an orthodox Marxist-Leninist party.
 ^Despite MLPA's victory , the rival
 National Union for the Total
 Independence of Angola (UNITA) under
 Jonas Savimbi continued to wage
 guerrilla war against the government
 with considerable help from South
 Africa. In 1,9976 after disclosure of
 covert CIA aid to UNITA  onQrees
 passed the "( lark AmP.+.+mp t"
 banning further assistance.
 ^Over the years, South Africa has
 made numerous land and air
 incursions into Angola, ostensibly in
 pursuit of Angolan-based guerrillas
 fighting South Africa's continuing
 occupation of Namibia (South-West
 Africa). Angola supports independence
 in Namibia after a UN-supervised
 cease-fire and elections. South Africa
 and the United States insist that a
 South African pullout from Namibia
 must be preceded or accompanied by
 withdrawal of Cuban troops from
 Angola.
 ^In 1984, UNITA appeared on the
 verge of a military breakthrough but in
 subsequent months the government -
 with Soviet and Portuguese help -
 turned the tide against the rebels.
 ?Last year Congress repealed the
 Clark Amendment, and in November
 President Reagan indicated he favors
 resuming aid to UNITA despite
 warnings from Angola that such action
 would endanger American economic
 interests there and damage prospects
 for peace in southern Africa.
 ^While Angola (population about 8.3
 million) has substantial agricultural,
 petroleum and mineral resources, its
 economy and its transportation and
 communications networks have been
 severely disrupted by the decades of
 warfare, the high cost of defense and
 a shortage of skilled workers.
 It is fine to treat Savimbi to some good,
 old-fashioned, all-American hospitality; we,
 have done as much for many unsavory types
 from all over the world in recent years. But
 if we offer him new aid - either "overt" or
 "covert," however it is packaged - the peo-
 ple of Africa, as usual, will be the biggest
 losers of all.
