 USSR-EGYPT
 FAHMI VISIT LAUDED FOR ACCORD ON BREZHNEV TRIP, PALESTINIANS
 The agreement on a Brezhnev -visit  to Egypt in January has predictably
 been heralded by Moscow as the major accomplishment of the talks
 during the 14-18 October visit of an Egyptian Government delegation
 headed by Foreign Minister Fahmi.   To give the news maximum impact,
 TASS issued an "announcement" on 15 October reporting on the
 Brezhnev-Fahmi meeting that day and the forthcoming Cairo summit.
 The announcement in effect constituted a mini-communique on
 Soviet-Egyptian relations.   Thu fi_rsi document on the delegation's
 talks, another TASS "announcement" issued on the 18th, dealt only
 with the "full accord" between the two sides on the need to
 reconvene the Geneva conference and to resolve the Palestinian
 question, in the latter case repeating Brezhnev's support, a week
 earlier, for a Palestinian "national home."  The absence of any
 reference to bilateral relations in the final document appears to
 reflect a decision to set aside continuing difficult problems
 pending the work of "joint specialized committees" which will meet
 in Cairo and Moscow to prepare for the January summit.
 Although Soviet media have not mentioned precise dates for
 Brezhnev's trip,* Cairo radio and MENA both reported cn 15 October
 that a meeting between Brezhnev and Sadat would take place on
 15 January--a date of commemorative significance, in that Podgornyy
 on 15 January 1971 attended ceremonies commissioning the Aswan
 hydropower complex.
 STATEMENTS ON VISIT      The release of two separate statements on
 the :,isit is a departure from the customary
 practice; usually whL-n Brezhnevv receives an Arab official but does
 not participate in the official F.alks, such a meeting is reported
 in the final communique at the end of the visit.   In the present
 case, Moscow presumably desired to give maximum publicity to the
 agreement on Brezhnev's Cairo visit.   Normally invitations for
 visits and acceptances appear at the end of a final statement on a
 delegation's talks.
 *  Cairo's AKHBAR AL-YAWN noted on the 19th that Brezhnev's visit
 was tentatively scheduled to last four days.  Arab media have also
 indicated that the Cairo visit may be part of a larger tour of the
 Arab world, with Syria specifically mentioned.

 23 OCTOBER 1974
 The report of the BrezhneNv-Fahmi meeting, described by TASS as an
 "announcement" and by the MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY (MENA) as an
 "official statement," was in essence a short communique on
 bilateral relations.   It expressed the sides' determination to
 continue strengthening and developing relations of friendship
 and cooperation on the basis of the May 1971 treaty.   Brezhnev
 emphasized the USSR's "principled course" of "every kind of
 support" for the Arabs' anti-:imperialist struggle, the elimination
 of the "aftermaths of thk.. Israeli aggression" and the establishment
 of peace in the Middle East.  And Fahmi, on behalf of Egypt and
 President as-Sadat personally, expressed gratitude for the USSR's
 "all round assistance and support" for Egypt's economy and
 "defense potential."
 Restriction of the concluding document on the Egyptian delegation's
 talks to the Palestinian issue and the Geneva conference was
 apparently not at first anticipated by Cairo media.   Thus on the
 16th MENA reported that the "joint communique" would deal with the
 forthcoming summit, the Geneva conference,  the Middle East problem,
 and bilateral relations.   By the evening of the 17th the format
 had apparently been set:   MENA provided a fairly accurate summary
 while Cairo radio said the "joint communique" would define the Soviet
 and Egyptian attitudes toward the Palestinian issue and the Geneva
 conference.   Seemingly acknowledging that the final statement was
 much narrower in focus than might have been anticipated, TASS on
 the 21st reported a Fahmi interview in which he "explained the
 reasons why a separate statement was adopted on the Palestine issue."
 Fahmi reportedly said that  the statement indicated "a complete
 identity of Soviet and Egyptian views on the PLO" and reaffirmed the
 PLO's right to represent the Palestinians at the Geneva conference
 as an independent participant.
 MOSCOW TREATMENT OF         Soviet media have given selective,
 FAHMI, BREZHNEV VISITS      generally upbeat coverage of the Fahmi
 visit, publicizing the two statements
 and Gromyko luncheon remarks but confining comment largely to
 generalities.   Assessing the Brezhnev trip as opening up favorable
 prospects for improving Soviet-Egyptian relations, Moscow has
 failed to suggest, much less specify, what agreements might
 result from the summit talks.  Moscow media,  frequently replaying
 Arab press comment,  have stressed the general themes that Soviet-
 Egyptian relations are based on long-term strategic and principled
 considerations, as reflected in the May 1971 friendship and
 cooperation treaty,  that Soviet aid has been generous and reliable,
 and that Brezhnev's visit will further develop and strengthen the

 countries' mutual relations.   Moscow has stressed the importance
 it attaches to a "successful" visit.   TASS in a dispatch from
 Cairo on the 21st,  for example, citing statements by Fahmi to
 AKHBAR AL-YAWM,  singled out his remarks that Brezhnev's decision
 to meet with as-Sadat represents "a turning point" and "a reply
 to all doubts and insinuations" T,ith regard to Soviet-Egyptian
 relations, and   added  that the forthcoming summit is to produce
 results.
 That difficult problems remain to be resolved was suggested in
 the announcement on the Brezhnev-Fahmi talks which said that
 "a range of matters which could underlie future accords" at a
 Soviet-Egyptian  'ummit meeting was "defined."  Putting it another
 way, Gromyko, is a luncheon speech on the 16th reported in a
 Moscow Arabic-language broadcast, said that "issues on the
 subject of negotiations and the agreements connected with them
 were defined," and Fahm: at the same luncheon was reported by TASS
 as declaring that there were no problems "which it would be
 difficult to solve."
 In other remarks, Gromyko appeared bent to impress on the Egyptians
 Soviet expectations that Cairo should demonstrate its good
 intentions.   Speaking at a luncheon on the 17th--as reported by
 MENA, but not TASS--Gromyko declared that "all competent departments"
 in the USSR would begin to prepare for the Brezhnev visit, which
 must be crowned with success."  He added somewhat cryptically
 11 that "as long as there is a firm and stable policy, success must
 result."  And at the airport departure ceremony, according to
 Cairo radio on the 18th, Gromyko again seemed to suggest concern
 over Cairo's attitude in remarking that "we will do everything
 possible to prepare for the meeting.   We hope the Egyptian side
 will do likewise."  The Soviet Union and Egypt, he said, must not
 allow "any person" to interfere in their friendship or to create
 obstacles in their way.
 ARAB MEDIA ON        In the most detailed account available of the
 BILATERAL PROBLEMS     course of the Fahmi talks, a Moscow dispatch
 by Musa Sabri published in the 19 October
 AKHBAR AL-YAWM said the Brezhnev-Fahmi meeting gave the "green
 light" and subsequent talks dealt with "the bread lines of bilateral
 relations in a bid to avoid any future differences."  He made clear
 that past "charges and countercharges" revolved around Egyptian
 accusations of inadequate arms deliveries and Soviet complaints
 of Egyptian press recriminations against the USSR and Cairo's
 failure to observe the treaty provision on "coordination."  Musa
 Sabri insisted that neither side assumed that the aim of the visit

 was to conclude new agreements, but rather that they agreed
 "on a specific program of action in various fi'lds" and focused
 on present and future cooperation "in a new climate of mutual
 confidence and understanding."
 Indicating various topics under consideration, Musa Sabri
 observed chat at his meeting with Fahmi, Bcezhnev had three
 files on military aid, economic aid, and "the Egyptian information
 campaign," as well as a copy of the treaty.  The talks, he
 revealed, covered debt rescheduling, Soviet-Egyptian coordination
 of stands and consultations ("otherwise," the Soviet Union
 would merely be an "arms merchant" for Egypt), and Soviet
 recognition of Egypt's "political influence."  The question of
 Egyptian-U.S. relations was not a point of contention, Musa Sabri
 maintained, noting that Brezhnev said the USSR had nothing against
 such relations and "itself now deals with the United States."
 More specific on aid projects, a MENA report on the 16th, citing
 sources in the Fahmi delegation, referred to Egypt's request for
 a new steel and iron complex, a nuclear reactor, and a nuclear
 plant for generating electric power.   It added that the sources
 were optimistic that problems in the areas of trade and technology
 could be resolved.   And the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY (INA) on the 19th,
 citing "observers in Moscow," mentioned Moscow's "agreement in
 principle to provide Egypt with nuclear reactors to utilize nuclear
 energy for peaceful. purposes."
 MILITARY AID         Soviet media have not indicated whether during
 the Fahmi visit any agreements or understandings
 were reached on the question of further Soviet military aid
 for Egypt, although references to favorable prospects for such
 aid had occurred before and early in the visit.   Moscow radio's
 Arabic service on the 14th, for instance, citing the Egyptian
 newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH, told its listeners that talks during
 the Fahmi delegation's visit would help develop Soviet-Egyptian
 military and economic relations.   Such references were not
 followed up or repeated in later Soviet comment.
 The question of mil tary aid was almost certainly discussed,
 however, in view of the fact that the chief of staff of the
 Egyptian armed forces, Lieutenant General al-Jamasi, was a member
 of the Fahml delegation to Moscow and, according to Moscow radio,
 met at least once on 16 October with the chief of the Soviet
 General Staff, Army General V. Kulikov.   Only Moscow's "unofficial"
 Radio Peace and Progress has commented on these talks, stating

 uninformatively that they were friendly and covered "issues of
 mutual interest."  RP:' implied in this context, however, that
 additional Soviet military aid was being or would be granted to
 Egypt, noting that "Soviet military aid is important to the Arabs
 in their conflict with Israel" and quoting the Egyptian War
 Minister as having said recently that "the Soviet Union is
 generously giving us all kinds of modern arms."
 Arab media have speculated on the results on the Fahmi delegation's
 talks on military-related matters.   INA on the 20th, for example,
 citing Egyptian sources, asserted that al-Jamasi's negotiations with
 Soviet military officials had been "very successful," but added
 that "the reports did not publish any details."  A commentary
 broadcast by Cairo's Voice of the Arabs on the 18th mentioned,
 almost in passing, that the Soviet-Egyptian joint statement on the
 Palestinian question had been issued "in addition to what has
 been agreed upon between the two countries in the fields of trade,
 industry, mutual cooperation, and military support."
 PALESTINIAN ISSUE,       The statement on the 18th   issued at the
 GENEVA CONFERENCE        conclusion of the Fahmi visit made the
 Palestinians' right to the creation of a
 "national home" a condition of a Middle East political settlement.
 Just a week previously, in his 11 October Kishinev speech, Brezhnev
 had put the Soviet Union on record for the first time as supporting
 the Palestinians'  right to "their own national home" (ochag).
 Earlier, Podgornyy, in an 8 September speech in Sofia, had endorsed
 the Palestinians' "sovereign right to establish their own statehood
 in one form or another."
 Moscow also came out firmly with Cairo for "independent participation"
 of representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization "on equal
 terms" with cther participants in the Geneva peace conference.
 Moscow had waffled on this issue earlier:  The communique on Fahmi's
 visit to Moscow last January had supported Palestinian representation
 but not explicitly a PLO delegation.   Then Brezhnev in his 14 June
 Supreme Soviet election speech spoke of the joint efforts of "states"
 taking part in the Geneva talks, with no mention of a Palestinian
 presence.   The 3 July communique on the Nixon-Brezhnev summit skirted
 the problem in asserting that the two countries, as co-chairmen of
 the Geneva conference, considered that it should resume as soon as
 possible with "the question of other participants from the Middle East
 area to be discussed at the conference."  But the communique on the
 visit of a PLO delegation to Moscow in early August expressed Soviet
 support for PLO participation "on an equal footing" with other
 delegations.

 23 OCTOBER 1974
 In the 18 October document, the sides also expressed satisfaction
 with the 14 October General Assembly resolution inviting the PLO
 to participate in deliberations on the question of Palestine.
 While the statement quoted the language of the UNGA resolution
 inviting the PLO as "the representative of the Palestinian people,"
 MENA's 16 October advance report on the final Soviet-Egyptian
 statement said it would welcome the UNGA invitation to the PLO
 "as the sole representative" of the Palestinians.
 The statement also recorded the two sides' view that a full
 political settlement must be achieved within the framework of
 the Geneva conference, and that Egypt and the USSR would work
 for resumption of the conference "at the earliest date."  Cairo
 media indicated that the Egyptians explained their problem of
 first coordinating the Arab front before proceeding to Geneva:
 MENA on the 16th cited Fahmi as saying that the Soviet Union
 appreciated Egypt's stand that it could not go to Geneva until
 the Arab ranks were unified in a single front.  And Musa Sabri,
 in his 19 October AKHBAR AL-YAWN article, also referred to "full
 appreciation" of Egypt's "essential" role in coordinating the Arab
 stand.  Musa Sabri also noted that while the sides believed there
 could be no final solution outside the Geneva conference, both
 would welcome any progress in bringing about a new withdrawal
 within the framework of continuing Israeli-Arab disengagement
 "under the military phase" of the situation.
 BACKGROUND ON RELATIONS     Since the October 1973 war, high-level
 Soviet-Egyptian visits have been
 confined to Fahmi's 21-24 January talks in Moscow to acquaint the
 Soviet leaders, according to Cairo radio, with the Israeli-
 Egyptian disengagement agreement, and to Gromyko's 1-5 March
 talks in Cairo.*  Fahmi also met with Gromyko while in New York in
 April and with Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin in Washington in
 mid-August, and Hijazi, then first deputy prime minister, met with
 Podgornyy when both were in Sofia in early September for Bulgarian
 anniversary ceremonies.
 Following an exchange of recriminations between Moscow and Cairo last
 spring,** Soviet-Egyptian relations seemingly had taken a turn for
 the better by mid-May, when as-Sadat described a communication from

 Brezhnev as "cordial" and expressing "the beginning of a more positive

 to Soviet Ambassador Polyakov on 6 June; characterizing this letter
 as welcoming the opening of a "new page" in relations, AKHBAR AL-YAWM

 to waste time and was therefore "astonished" when Moscow postponed
 the Fahmi visit last summer.

 COMMUNIST RELATIONS
 WARSAW MEETING OPENS DRIVE FOR 1975 EUROPEAN CP CONFERENCE
 The call for convening an all-European communist party conference
 in 1975 issued by the 16-18 October Warsaw "consultative" meeting
 of 28 European communist parties represents the first formal
 organizational move in the drive to convene a new world communist
 party conference.  Some evidence that Moscow is willing to pay
 the price of such gatherings by tolerating more diversity in
 the communist movement was indicated by the attendance at Warsaw
 of three independently oriented parties--the Romanian, Yugoslav,
 and Norwegian--whi,.< had boycotted the last European communist
 party conference at Karlovy Vary in April 1967.   Other evidence
 symbolizing the current effort to make public gestures of
 accommodation was the announcement by Warsaw on the 10th, by
 Moscow the next day, and in the final communique on the Warsaw
 conclave that it had been called on the initiative of the Italian
 as well as the Polish communist parties.   At the same time,
 adherence to past positions in speeches by Soviet delegate
 Ponomarev on the one hand, and by the Romanian, Yugoslav, and
 Italian CP delegates on the other suggests that more difficulties
 are likely to impede the convening of a European and an eventual
 world communist party conference.  As in 1967, the Albanian,
 Netherlands, and Icelandic CP's boycotted the Warsaw proceedings.
 The 18 October final communique registered the participating
 parties' "desire" that a conference of all European communist
 parties be held in East Germany "no later than mid-1975,"
 preceded by a preparatory meeting this December or January.
 It recorded agreement on the central subject of the planned
 conference:    "The Struggle for Peace, Security, Cooperation, and
 Social Progress in Europe."   Speakers at the meeting en?-isioned
 that the European communist conference would take place after the
 windup of the European Security Conference.
 Whereas the communique on the 1967 Karlovy Vary conference had
 referred only briefly to free and broad discussion at that gathering,
 the Warsaw meeting communique went out of its way to stress that the
 proceedings had been based on "equal rights, respect for the views
 of all parties,  and a desire to achieve a common standpoint,"
 principles which the participants specified should prevail in the
 further preparations and the final conference.  The mutual under-
 standing and proletarian internationalism displayed at the meeting,

 it added, were "in complete accordance with normal relations
 between fraternal parties."  While communist media gave no hint
 of controversy in the Warsaw proceedings, Rome's ANSA on the 18th
 carried a denial by  the Italian CP delegation head, Pajetta,  that
 there had been any discussion of a possible anti-Peking resolution
 at the forthcoming European CP conference.
 Low-keyed Soviet followup comment stressed that the Warsaw meeting
 and the planned European CP conference would strengthen detente.
 A Moscow domestic service commentary on the 19th recalled that
 Brezhnev--in his first public statement of support for a European
 CP conference--had declared at Katowice on 20 July that such a
 conference would promote "joint action" toward further relaxing
 tensions on the continent.  The weekly Moscow domestic service
 roundtable discussion on the 20th wound up with remarks stressing
 that the European communist parties can, through their delibera-
 tions, make the process of detente irreversible.
 PONOMAREV SPEECH      Although Soviet delegation head Ponomarev
 included a reference to open discussion at
 the forthcoming conference in his 16 October speech, he took a
 tougher line than the final communique in stressing the need for
 unity and concerted action by the European CP's to overcome the
 obstacles to detente.   Thus, he declared that convening a
 European communist conference was prompted not only by the
 interests of the European peoples but by "the immediate interests
 of the European communist movement," adding that the conference
 would promote "further cohesion of the world communist movement
 on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism."
 Presumably alluding to the Chinese, among others, the CPSU
 Politburo member and  secretary went on to note that the European
 CP conference would aid the struggle against "all kinds of
 anticommunism" and for "the Marxist-Leninist outlook."   Ponomarev
 proposed that the planned conference adopt two documents--a
 "politi_cal" one detailing a program of joint actions, and another
 addressing an appeal  to the European peoples.   Both documents,
 he declared,  "must express the joint and agreed view of all"
 conference participants.  This consensus, he added, would not
 preclude each party's voicing its own individual views in
 conference speeches and formulating the documents, in accordance
 with "democratic norms" and equality.
 Ponomarev's speech  was carried only in summary form, by TASS on
 the 17th and in PRAVDA the next day.

 ROMANIA, YUGOSLAVIA      Bucharest and Belgrade waited until just
 before the Warsaw meeting opened to reveal
 their decisions to participate in the gathering, and both warned
 that they would participate in t',  'ontinued preparations and
 the conference itself only if t}1 :1'r views on international party
 conferences were not violated.  Ttius,  the Romanian Communist
 Party Executive Committee was reported by Bucharest radio on the
 15th as deciding, on a motion by Ceausescu,  to participate in
 the Warsaw meeting.   The decision, reported only as one of several
 actions on various subjects at the Executive Committee session,
 reiterated Bucharest's stand that "all" parties--including those
 who do not want to join in "compulsory" decisions or in criticism
 of other parties--should be invited to and participate in inter-
 national communist party conferences.
 While the other participating East European countries, including
 Yugoslavi,, publicized the contents of their delegates' speeches
 during the course of the Warsaw meeting,  the Romanians waited
 until four days after it ended.  An article by the delegation head,
 RCP secretary Andrei, in the 22 October SCINTEIA reported on the
 stand he had taken at the gathering, in accordance with the
 "mandate" which he said had been spelled out by Ceausescu.   Andrei
 reported among other things that he had served notice at the
 meeting that the RCP was "committed by statutory documents and
 decisions not to subscribe in any way to actions attacking and
 blaming other parties."  At the Moscow international party conference
 in June 1969 Ceausescu had signed "with reservations" the main
 conference document, which had registered only muted criticism of
 dissident views without mentioning the Chinese.  Andrei's current
 article declares in effect that the RCP's participation in the
 preparations for and convening of even a European CP conference
 would depend on respect for "each party's independence and autonomy."
 Yugoslav participation in the Warsaw meeting was revealed officially
 in a TANJUG report on the 15th that an LCY delegation, headed by
 Executive Committee secretary Grlickov, had left that day for the
 Polish capital.   The report was amplified only by a statement that
 at the meeting "views will be exchanged on convening a conference of
 communist parties of our continent."  Also on the 15th, a talk by
 Zagreb radio's outspoken commentator Sundic dismissed alleged
 Western speculation that Belgrade's participation in the meeting
 meant that Yugoslavia was turning toward the socialist community,
 that it had been subjected to "an immediate threat" by the
 socialist camp, or that there was any connection between its
 participation and the recent trial of Cominformist groups in
 Yugoslavia.

 Grlickov's speech in Warsaw on the 17th, carried in full by
 TANJUG the same day, did little to improve relations between
 the LCY and the CPSU.   Stressing that the situation confronting
 the communist movement today was completely different from
 that in "past decades," the Yugoslav delegate ruled out any
 direction of the movement from "one center" or institutionalizing
 international consultations as a means of working out common
 strategy.   With obvious particular reference to the 1960 Moscow
 conference, which had roundly denounced "Yugoslav revisionism,"
 Grlickov declared that a European communist party conference
 must not be treated as "a continuation" of previous conferences.
 He added that neither should a European gathering deal with the
 holding of a new world party conference, since the conditions
 for such a conference "are absent."  A Warsaw-datelined dispatch
 published in the French CP's L'HUMANITE on the 18th noted that
 the Yugoslav speech was the only one to refer directly to a
 "world" party conference.   Stressing that the problems of Europe
 today were "very complex," Grlickov said in conclusion that his
 party would decide later whether to participate in furc',ier
 preparations for a European CP conference.
 ITALIAN CP      On behalf of one of the two parties which had
 organized the Warsaw meeting, the Italian CP's
 Pajetta declared at the opening session that he anticipated
 "a free, frank, and profound confrontation of views between our
 parties, on the basis of equality."  The speech, as reported by
 L'UNITA on the 17th, also ruled out criticism of absent parties.
 Reasserting the principle of unity in diversity, Pajetta told
 the meeting that "unity is a result of the combination of the
 experiences of the workers movement of every country," each
 nation's peculiarities, and each party's autonomy.

 SINO - SOVIET  R ELATIONS
 MOSCOW:  PEKING SEEKS CONFLICT IN EUROPE, HALT IN DETENTE
 Recent remarks by Chinese leaders regarding a "unified" Germany
 and detente during their talks with West German legislators
 visiting Peking have produced an outpouring of Moscow radio
 and press comment accusing Peking of seeking to wreck detente
 and encourage East-West conflict in Europe.*  The Soviet
 reaction included a 19 October commentary by PRAVDA's
 authoritative Yuriy Zhukov warning against  the "dangerous noise"
 of the "Peking firebrands."
 Zhukov, focusing on Western reports of PRC Vice Premier Teng
 Hsiao-ping's statements to the FRG Bundestag delegation that
 peace cannot last for a whole generation and that the threat to
 peace in Europe comes from the USSR, accused the Chinese of
 resurrecting the "NATO myth" that "the only thing to be seen
 on the European plains are Soviet divisions ready to pounce on
 the West."  Zhukov went on to denounce alleged Peking support
 for a more powerful NATO, an expanded arms race, and "a new
 military grouping of West European states which would serve as
 a NATO subsidiary."  He accused the Chinese of ulterior motives,
 saying they wished to "warm their hands over a thermonuclear fire
 after causing a clash between socialist and capitalist countries."
 Underlining the importance Moscow attaches to the Teng pronounce-
 ments, Zhukov made a rare Soviet acknowledgment of the vice
 premier's rising stature in the Chinese hierarchy, stating that
 recent reports show that "since the illness of Premier Chou En-lai
 he has been substituting for him."
 Other Soviet comment has sought to link Teng's reported remarks on
 war with Peking's endorsement of a unified Germany and its reported
 invitation to the FRG opposition leader   Strauss  to visit China
 early in 1975, describing this as Chinese fostering of a "repetition
 of Hitler's crusade against communism."    Much of the Soviet comment
 has replayed Zhukov's view that Peking seeks  to destroy detente and
 stir up an East-West conflict in Europe, but a 21 October commentary
 on Moscow's "unofficial" Radio Peace and Progress went further,
 raising the specter of a common China-West European front against
 Moscow.   The commentator noted that neo-fascists in the West hope
 that Peking's support for NATO would lead to a "common West European-
 Chinese strategy against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries."

 INDOCHINA
 DRV ENDORSES CONTACTS WITH THAI "PEOPLE," REBUFFS GOVERNMENT
 Reflecting a new, more positive dimension in DRV policy toward
 Thailand, a DRV Foreign Ministry information department spokesman
 declared in an interview with VNA that Hanoi is interested in
 developing contacts with the Thai "people," even though official
 DRV-Thai exchanges must await a change in Bangkok's "hostile"
 policy toward Vietnam.   The VNA interview was released on
 18 October, in response to comment in Thai media two days earlier
 that Bangkok government officials had welcomed reports from a
 Thai visitor to Hanoi that alleged the director of North Vietnam's
 commission on foreign cultural relations had expressed approval
 "in principle" for cultural exchanges.
 Stressing that contacts at this time must be limited, the spokes-
 man took issue with "distorted reports" circulated by Thai
 officials concerning developing bilateral contacts, asserting
 they are designed to "soothe public opinion" and to "sidetrack"
 the Thai people's struggle against Bangkok's pro-U.S. policies.
 Because of Thaii.'rd's "hostile policy toward Vietnam and Indochina,"
 he advised, "it is unrealistic for the Thai  administration to
 talk about improving relations between the two countries."  He
 charged specifically that "Thai -uthorities have sold out Thailand's
 independence and sovereignty" to the United States and have not
 drawn the "appropriate lessons" from the U.S. withdrawal from
 Indochina in the wake of the Paris and Vientiane agreements, and
 he attacked Bangkok's continued tolerance of U.S. bases in Thailand
 and its aid for Thieu in South Vietnam.   Concluding on a positive
 note, the spokesman advised that Bangkok's policy "can by no means"
 prevent the development of friendly relations between the "peoples"
 of Thailand and Vietnam, who "in their cwn interests" should have
 "contacts and join efforts" to preserve their "longstanding relations
 of friendship."
 Though the full imp- cations of Hanoi's de?,arche ::_e not yet
 clear, the spokesman's comment comes against a background of recently
 active Hanoi efforts pressing for a change in the Sanya government's
 policy of supporting the United States in Indochina and allowing
 U.S. military forces to remain in Thailand.   After an authoritative

 NHAN DAN "Observer" article in May 1974 specified that such a
 shift represented a basic precondition for improved DRV-Thai
 relations, Hanoi issued a steady stream of authoritative
 comment focused against Bangkok's pro-U.S. stance.*  The
 present spokesman's interview, by adding the specific entice-
 ment of bilateral cultural contacts to encourage Thailand
 to change its ways,  suggests that Hanoi intends to use both
 the carrot of bilateral exchange and the stick of propaganda
 attacks on Bangkok policies in pushing for a change in the
 Sanya government's ties with the United States.
 DRV AUTHOR HONG CHUONG ASSESSES U.S. P( ER, DETENTE POLICIES
 U.S. policies of decent, with Moscow and rapprochement with Peking
 have been assailed in    recant three-part Hanoi radio talk attri-
 buted to Hong Cliuong--an assistant editor of the DRV party journal
 HOC TAP who authored remarkably frank articles in the 1960's
 criticizing the Soviets and Chinese.   Hong Chuong's talk was
 broadcast in Vietnamese in thrps daily installments beginning on
 8 October and was summarized in Hanoi's Mandarin-language broad-
 casts beginning on the 14th.   The timing of his attack on U.S.
 policies of detente, like the timing of the most recent government
 statements issued by the PRG and DRV on 8 and 11 October respec-
 tively, may be related to Secretary Kissinger's scheduled
 23-27 October Moscow visit.** There are precedents in Vietnamese
 communist propaganda that suggest a pattern of deliberate activity
 timed to coincide with U.S. diplomatic initiatives involving
 Hanoi's allies.   Thus, for example, the last previous PRG state-
 ment was issued on 22 March, two days before Secretary Kissinger's
 arrival for talks in Moscow, and a major Hanoi propaganda assault
 was launched against U.S. overtures to socialist states last
 fall before the Secretary's scheduled visit to Peking.
 Hong Chuong restates the long-standing Vietnamese communist
 contention that Washington is attempting to divide the socialist
 countries with its detente policy and that it is improving relations

 with the big socialist states in order to promote cultural and
 ideological inroads and concentrate on opposing the small
 socialist countries.  At the same time, Hong Chuong suggests
 a more sanguine Hanoi appraisal of U.S. efforts than was
 reflected in its propaganda a year ago.   In a series of articles
 last November and December the military commentator "Chien
 Binh" (Combatant) had used strident terms in warning that
 the United States was attempting to "surround, divide, and
 intimidate" the socialist camp, "sabotage" the communist
 movement, "repress" the national liberation movement, and
 "frantically counterattack" the revolutionary movement.*  By
 contrast, Hong Chuong emphasizes U.S. weaknesses, claiming that
 U.S. failure to "encircle and isolate" the socialist  system
 has forced Washington to implement a new policy of developing
 normal diplomatic relations with a number of socialist countries.
 Chien Binh's article a year ago appeared to be criticizing
 Hanoi's allies when it admonished that de,:ente can only be used
 to create conditions to launch stronger o-fensives.   Taking a
 different focus, Hong Chuong seems to r_f lect less concern that
 Moscow or Peking has been taken in by the alleged U.S. ploy.   He
 maintains that the "present detente between the U.S. imperialists
 and a number of socialist countries is only temporary and limited,"
 expresses confidence in the role of the "world socialist system"
 as a "revolutionary base for our country," and says that the
 socialist system is "providing firm and stably: support to the
 small and weak countries struggling to protect their fundamental
 national rights."
 Hong Chuong underlines his evaluation of the weakened U.S. position
 in concluding passages, among other things claiming that recent
 world developments--including the settlements in Vietnam and Laos,
 the change of governments in Thailand and Portugal, and events in
 the Hidale East and Cyprus--have demonstrated that the United
 States no longer holds the same position of strength and that the
 world balance of forces "has completely changed."  Maintaining that
 the weakened U.S. posture had forced it to rescrt to "perfidious
 mr.neuvers," Hong Chuong derisively notes that Secretary Kissinger
 has "traveled from one country to another  to publicize   the so-called
 interdependence theory designed to undermine the coordinated actions
 of the small and weak countries" that are opposing "U.S. infiltration."
 He goes on to suggest that such tactics will fail, since the United
 States is in a declining position.

 BACKGROUND      Hong Chuong had previously been a prolific contributor
 to HOC TAP, publishing at least. 34 articles in the
 Journal since it first appeared in 1956; but ha has been less
 prominent in recent years.   His last article in HOC TAP was published
 in May 1971, and since then his only known article was a discourse
 on literary theory and criticism published in the November-December.
 1973 issue of the bimonthly literary journal TAP CHI VAN HOC.   He
 appeared in public in 1971 and again in 1973, but is not known to
 have appeared in 1972.
 Many of Hong Chuong's HOC TAP articles dealt with cultural subje^ts,
 but particularly beginning in 1963, he wrote significant comme    :ies
 on the situation in South Vietnam and world developments.  Among other
 thLags, he was the author of radical attacks on r.?:)viet and Chinese
 policies:   The controversial nature of a November 1964 Hong Chuong
 article, hailing Khrushchev's ouster two months earlier, was demon-
 strated when Hanoi authorities deleted the article from issues of
 HOC TAP after initial copies had already been released.  A May 1967
 HOC TAP article by Hong Chuong launched a thinly  veiled attack on
 the Chinese cultural revolution, among other things, warning against
 the deification of a leader.

 CHINA
 CAMPAIGN SEEKS BIG BOOST IN LAST QUARTER INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT
 Peking seems determined to increase PRC industrial output
 significantly in the fourth quarter of 1974, placing special
 attention on light industry, following a disappointing indus-
 trial performance during the first three quarters.   Peking
 and provincial media comment stresses that the increases will
 result from carrying out the anti-Lin Piao  nd Confucius
 campaign, although the shift to light industry probably is
 prompted by good crops this year, which furnish a material
 base for better performance.
 Complementing the production drive, Peking continues to press
 the themes of party control and revoluiontary unity as part
 of the anti-Lin and Confucius campaign.   These themes--which
 have dominated the movement since this summer when provincial
 radios reported economic dislocations resulting from the
 previous radical stage of the movement--were again sounded in an
 October RED FLAG article on unity, indicating that problems
 are continuing.   The article, broadcast by Peking radio on
 20 October, argued that if revolutionary unity was weakened
 it would lead to "losses to our revolution and production."
 The article criticized cadres who "feel unhappy about the
 masses' criticism and instigate conflicting sentiments among
 the masses" and it cautioned cadres holding differing views
 to "seek common ground on major points while reserving
 differences on minor points."
 The need to continue the campaign under tight party control
 also continues to bL emphasi=c!d in provincial broadcasts.
 Sining radio on 17 October, for example, urged party members
 to pay more attention to "self-criticism" and to "refrain
 from picking on the shortcomings or mistakes of others."
 The broadcast also called on cadres to lead the masses toward
 unity and to struggle against "words and deeds that weaken
 or break away from the leadership of _he party" or "violate
 party discipline."
 INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION      The turn towards promoting light
 industry has thus far been displayed
 most strongly in Kwangtung, where a 14 October industrial rally
 and an 18 October NANFANG DAILY euitorial devoted renewed

 attention to the nead for promoting light industrial produc-
 tion.   The theme may be national in scope, at least for
 provinces with bimtlar conditions; according to the Canton
 rally report, broadcast by Canton radio on the 18th, the rally
 proposals were adopted after "the essence of the party Central
 Committee's directive on present industrial production" was
 explained.   The light industry theme was picked up by Anhwei
 province on 22 October, with a progress  report and an ANHWEI
 DAILY editorial.
 The Canton rally and editorial both called for using the ideo-
 logical movement to increase production,  stressing the control
 aspects of L1.3 campaign.   The editorial in particular stated
 that cadres must "dare to control the class struggle" and
 singled out "veteran workers" as the group to be most relied on.
 Othcr provinces have also called for a production surge in the
 fourth quarter, but without singling out light industry for
 attention.   A 20 October Hopei report on a provincial meeting
 cited as a unit's criterion of success in the campaign whether
 "it can fulfill and overfulf ill the state plan in an all-around
 way."  Similarly, a HUNAN DAILY editorial broadcast by Changsha
 radio on 17 October put local units on notice that production
 levels would be used to determine how well criticism of Lin and
 Confucius has been carried out.   The editorial argued that
 greater party leadership over workers was essential to meet
 fourth-quarter production goals and it called upon all party
 committees to "assign persons specifically responsible for
 control over production."
 BACKGROUND ON LIGHT      The last time China made a major push
 INDUSTRY CAMPAIGN        in light industry was in the summer
 and fall of 1972.   That shift also took
 advantage of a good agricultural crop, but it also seemed to be
 related to changes in line following the Lin Piao affair and the
 decline in influence of PLA leaders.  An article in RED FLAG
 No. b for 1972, announcing the new stress on light industry,
 criticized "imperialist and social imperialist countries" where
 "industry, especially military industry,  has developed abnormally."

 MOSCOW HARDLINERS APPEAR TO DEFY LEADERSHIP OVER ART SHOW
 The leadership of Moscow's Cheremushki district party committee,
 whose suppression of an art exhibit in Moscow a month ago
 caused an international scandal, was singled out in the Moscow
 organization's newspaper MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA on 17 October
 as a model for other district committees to follow in handling
 ideological work.   Coming a month after the top party leadership
 had reversed the district committee's action and allowed the
 art show to be pr3sented, and two weeks after the first secretary
 of the offending district committee was dismissed  allegedly for
 mishandling the affair, the editorial amounts, in effect, to a
 defiance of the leadership for its handling of the affair.
 ART SHOW FIASCO      The art show fiasco began on 15 September,
 when a group of artists attempted to hold an
 abstract art exhibit in a field in Cheremushki district,  after
 Moscow city executive committee officials had refused to
 issue a permit.  The violent breaking up of the exhibit and
 roughing up of foreign newsmen by a gang of plainclothes militia-
 men brought a wave of extremely bad publicity in the Western
 press.
 ?.nitially the suppression was defended in broadcasts beamed abroad
 and in a letter published in the 20 September SOVIET CULTURE.  Then
 Moscow executive committee official N.Ya. Sychev, formerly head
 of the city party committee's ideology section, held a 28 September
 press conference specifically to counter the "incorrect, distorted"
 reporting of the event in the foreign press and to deny that there
 had been any "crushing of the exhibit."
 However, this line was apparently judged insufficient by some
 higher level officials.  On 29 September, the same day Sychev's
 statements appeared in MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA, a second modern art
 show was permitted without interference and, according to Western
 reports, drew thousands of visitors.  This was followed by an even
 more unusual slap at the Moscow organization and its policies.  On
 9 October it was announced that the first secretary of the
 offending district committee, B.N.  Chaplin, had been removed at
 an 8 October district party committee plenum.  No hint of the
 reasons was given in the MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA account, but foreign
 newsmen were immediately tipped off by unidentified "Soviet
 sources" that Chaplin's removal was punishment for mishandling the

 art shorn and that Moscow city party committee ideology secretary
 V.N. Yagodkin was also apparently implicated in the affair.   This
 was reported in the New York TIMES on 10 October.  Despite the
 implicit rebuke to Yagodkin, he has as yet suffered no evident
 loss of authority and continu2s to function as Moscow's ideology
 boss.
 MOSCOW'S HARDLINERS      The Moscow City leadership has earned a
 well-deserved reputation in recent years
 for advocating and applying repressive policies against th'
 liberal intelligentsia.   Both the dismissed first secretary of
 the Cheremushki district party committee, V.N. Chaplin, and the
 Moscow City party committee's ideology secretary, V.N. Yagodkin,
 have contributed to this reputation.
 Chaplin's views were set forth in an article in the May 1974
 KOMMUNIST which reviewed the work of his district committee with
 the scientific-technical intelligentsia.   He noi.ed that his
 district is Moscow's "science district," where half of all party
 members work in scientific institutes.   He stressed the importance
 of ideological war, attacked "technocrat ism" (read "apoliti=ism"),
 and assailed scholars who "nibble at the bait" of "humanization"
 and "liberalization."  He particularly complained about scientists
 who thought scholars could stick to "pure science" and who argued
 for a "division of labor" whereby party organizations would handle
 ideological work and not "overburden" specialists with public
 activities.
 Chaplin's views appear close to those of Yagodkin, who seems to
 have built his career largely by devising ways of forcing scholars
 t,)  do more ideological study during his tenure as party secretary
 aZ Moscow State Uni-'ersity.   Chaplin first appeared in August
 1965 as second secretary of the Okty.ibr district, adjacent to the
 university where Yagodkin was leading party work, and in the
 December 1968 reorganization of Moscow districts he was chosen to
 head the newly created Cheremushki district south of the university.
 Meanwhile, Yagodkin's ideological innovations at the university
 won him promotion to Moscow City party committee ideology secretary
 in March 1971, and he has since used this position to attack liberal.
 trends in the leading history, philosophy and economic institutes.
 He has become perhaps the leading spokesman for the theory that
 detente necessitates ideological tightening up at home and has
 played one of the leading roles in the 1973-74 crackdown on social

 sciences.  He lectured the General History Institute on the
 ideological dangers arising from detente in June 1973, for
 example.*  He demanded that philosophy become a weapon in the
 ideological war at a November 1973 Central Committee conference
 of philosophers, reported in the May 1974 HERALD OF THE USSR
 ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.   And he attacked innovative economists
 such as G.S. Lisichkin and, by implication, N.P. Fedorenko at
 a November 1973 Central Committee conference of economists,
 according to the February 1974 QUESTIONS OF ECONOMICS.
 In addition to these public attacks, he indicated in the February
 QUESTIONS OF ECONOMICS article that his city party committee had
 issued decrees directly intervening in cadre matters at
 Fedorenko's institute as well as at the Institute of Economics.
 In a February 1974 KOMMUNIST article he assailed any "technocratic"
 approach to the economy and  .gain called for an ideological
 crackdown in the face of detente.   Spurred by a Centrai Committee
 decree on raising the ideological level of social science t:!aching
 at Saratov University and Moscow's Bauman technical school
 published in the 24 June PRAVDA, Grishin and Yagodkin began a
 new series of meeting;: in July to tighten up.

 '3 OCTOBER 1974
 FEDORENKO PROPOSES REORGANIZATION OF GOSPLAN AND MINISTRIES
 In a September QUESTIONS OF PHILOSOPHY article, top Soviet economist
 N. P. Fedorenko, academic secretary of the Academy of Sciences'
 economic division, proposes stripping the State Planning Commission,
 Gosplan, of some if its planning functions and transforming
 ministries into independent self-financing units.   Such an action
 would represent a major reform and a marked reduction of rigid
 central planning.   Innovator Fedorenko's  proposal follows closely
 on the heels of a similar idea floated in mid-August in TRUD by
 reform-minded minister K. N. Rudnev.   The simultaneous presentation
 of this idea by two such prominent figures suggests it ranks as
 one of the major viewpoints being pressed in the current high-level
 debate over changes in the economic system.    Such discussions do
 not, however, suggest early adoption   given the regime's traditional
 caution about major economic policy shifts.
 REFORM PROPOSALS      Addressing his article to the December plenum's
 call for changes in the economic system,
 Fedorenko proposed that Gosplan be relieved of current planning to
 concentrate on long-range planning and that it be reorganized along
 "functional" lines instead of the present  "branch" lines.   This would
 mean transferring to the ministries responsibility for planning for
 their own branches.   Further, Fedorenko indicated that the ministries
 should finance their operations and investments from their own
 profits or from bank loans, rather than from budget allocations.   He
 carefully stressed that this would preserve the principle of central-
 ized   planning, while forcing economic units at all levels--ministries,
 associations and enterprises--to adopt the most efficient planning
 and investment decisions.   One of the key obstacles to the success
 of the 1965 economic reform was that while enterprises were to
 operate on the principle of economic accountability, their superior
 organs--ministries and main administrations--were not.   The March 1973
 decree on productions associations extended the principle of economic
 accountability upward to production associations, which are replacing
 main administrations, and Fedorenko's proposal would extend it all
 the way to the ministerial level.
 Fedorenko's proposal dovetails with arguments advanced by Rudnev in
 a 15 August TRUD article on improving the  administrative mechanism.
 Like Fedorenko, Rudnev, minister of irMCrument making, automation
 equipment  and  control systems, is a leading innovator.   At a key
 May 1968 all-union conference on the economic reform, Rudnev had
 proposed that his whole ministry be made self-financing.   He said
 this would require that all current planning for his branch be
 transferred from Gosplan to the ministry.   This was finally done in

 April 1970, but Rudnev's ministry has remained the only such
 self-financed ministry.   In his August TRUD article he declared
 that full self-financing had proved successful in his ministry
 and should be applied to  other ministries, changing them from
 purely administrative bodies to economically responsible entities.
 He called for strong, independent ministries which would do
 their own current planning, rather than depending on Gosplan
 for this function.
 GOSPLAN RESISTANCE        Gosplan has been the target of proposals
 for reorganization for
 some time,
 but has
 been put on the defensive since the December
 1973
 plenum,
 which
 apparently heard sharp attacks on its work.
 For
 example,
 in the
 wake of the discussion o   economic problems at the December 1972
 plenum, Gosplan's departments--most of which are organized on
 branch lines--came under criticism for poor coordination of
 interbranch problems.  These criticisms were noted in a 17 February
 1973 TRUD article by Gosplan Deputy Chairman A. V. Bachurin, who
 rejected suggestions to basically reorganize Gosplan.  He also
 appeared to spike any idea of transferring branch planning to
 ministries, stressing instead that branch ministries were even
 less efficient than Gosplan in overseeing interbranch coordination.
 However, as Bachurin acknowledged in a 26 August 1974 ECONOMIC
 GAZETTE article, new demands to transfer some Gosplan functions
 to ministries were made at the December 1973 plenum.  After the
 plenum Gosplan Chairman Baybakov publicly defended his organization's
 prerogatives in this regard.  In articles on improving planning
 in the March PLANNED ECONOMY and the 23 May TRUD, he stressed that
 Lenin himself had oriented Gosplan to handle branch as well as
 territorial planning and current as well as long term planning
 and insisted that this coordinated approach to planning was now
 more important "than ever before."  He also took a calculated
 swing at Gosplan foe Fedorenko, who has been a promoter of
 mathematical economic methods and the system of optimal functioning
 of the economy (SOFE).  Declaring that no matter how important
 mathematical economic methodology was,  it still remained just one
 of many methods, he ridiculed "some economists" for overrating
 it and the "so-called" SOFE.
 Bachurin conceded in '.iis August a, ticle, however,  that perhaps
 some Gosplan functions could go to ministries.   But he attacked
 the concept of self-financing ministries, declaring that ministries
 should remain administrative bodies rather than become economically
 responsible entities.

 BREZHNEV, KOSYGIN     While the precise attitude of Brezhnev
 POSITIONS UNCLEAR     and Kosygin toward the proposals is not
 clear, Gosplan may not be able to count
 on their full support.  Kosygin's views have appeared to coincide
 with those of the Gosplan leaders in some respects, but he has
 also fostered the idea of transferring the subdivisions of
 ministries (enterprises and production associations) to economic
 accountability and has helped promote some of Fedorenko's ideas
 in the past.   Brezhnev's repeated assertions that political
 considerations must take precedence over economic considerations
 suggest that he would be less than sympathetic to Fedorenko's
 goal of allowing economic organs to make decisions on purely
 economic grounds.   At the same time Brezhnev has been a frequent
 critic of Gosplan.  At the 24th CPSU Congress, for example, he
 urged a strengthening of ministries and reduction of Gosplan's
 current planning functions, and at the December 1973 plenum he
 called for a comprehensive reorganization of planning.
 In any case, the chances for early adoption of the Fedorenko-
 Rudnev proposals appear slim in view of the regime's tendency to
 move slowly and cautiously on economic changes.  Even the transfer
 of ministerial subdivisions  to economic accountability ordered
 by the March 1973 decree on production associations is proceeding
 extremely slowly    Although ministries had been ordered to prepare
 schemes for reorganizing their main administrations into cost
 accounting production associations and industrial associations
 for submission to the Council of Ministers by September 1973,
 there have been repeated complaints of delay and evasion and
 the council's approval of the first such schemes was only announced
 in the 6 September 1974 IZVESTIYA--one year later.

 NOTES
 JCP ON FORD VISIT:  A 21 October statemenc by the Presidium of
 the Japan CommuntsL Party has called for a "great national
 movement" against President Ford's November visit to Tokyo.
 Evoking the memory of the large demonstrations in 1960 against
 the U.S.-Japan Mutual Security Treaty, the statement called
 for formation of "joint struggle" organizations on a scale
 surpassing those in the 1960 demonstrations which led to can-
 cellation of a planned visit by President Eisenhower.   The
 statement takes advantage of the controversy over the presence
 of U.S. nuclear weapons in Japan that has flared up recently
 following Congressional testimony by a retired U.S. Navy
 admiral to link t1Rz visit to an alleged attempt by the United
 States aLLd Japan to "promote transformation of their military
 alliance into a nuclear military alliance."
 PRC-USSR-BALKANS:  An 18 October article by PEOPLE'S DAILY
 international affairs commentator Jen Ku-ping has offered an
 unusually comprehensive indictment of Soviet policy in the
 Balkans, charging that Moscow has stepped up its "expansionism"
 there in the wake of the 1973 Middle East war and this year's
 Cyprus crisis.   Tre article portrays Moscow as backing the
 Cominformist group in Yugoslavia and notes Soviet military
 pressures on Romania, pointing up Soviet military exercises
 in the Balkans and demand^ ''3r army transit rights.   In an
 obvious reference to Brezhnev's 11 October speech at Kishinev,
 Jen denounces' unnamed Sov:-et leaders who "appeared at points
 on the Soviet borders adjo.'.ning the Balkans to boast in person
 of Russia's history of gobb=.'ng up neighboring territories."
 He also indirectly assailed Moscow's support for Bulgarian
 claims to parts of Macedonia that are now    thin Yugoslavia,
 accusing the Soviets of having "secretly s.  ed territorial
 disputes."  Lauding the example of Yugoslav-Romanian coopera-
 tion shown in the joint communique on Tito's visit to Bucharest
 in July, Peking called on Balk,..i nations to strengthen mutual
 relations and take "powerful measures" to rebuff the "menace of
 expansionism" posed by the USSR.

 CASTRO SPEECH:   For the second time in three weeks Cuban
 Prime Minister Fidel Castro has criticized U.S. policies
 toward the Third World, in an 18 October address to a World
 Federation of Trade Unions meeting in Havana.   Dealing
 primarily with world economic problems, Castro asserted that
 "Yankee imperialism" aimed at division of the oil-producing
 and other Third World countries and that these countries
 must unite to end the "rapacious exploitation" of the past.
 As in his 28 September speech, Castro urged OPEC members to
 invest in underdeveloped rather than industrial nations
 where the investments would become a "hostage for imperialism".
 Possibly concerned to assume a firm pose in view of the forth-
 comin,, OAS conference--which will consider lifting sanctions
 imposed against Cuba--Castro declared that the Cuban revolu-
 tion was becoming "more revolutionary, more internationalist"
 and more loyal to "the immortal ideas of Marx, Engels and Lenin."
 In reporting Castro's speech on the 19th, TASS described his
 praise for Latin American efforts against "the interference of
 monopolies and agreed with his assessment that the blockade of
 Cuba had failed, but refrained from mentioning his direct
 criticism of the United States.   Soviet media have recently
 repeated their encouragement for a thaw in U.S.-Cuban relations
 by approvingly reporting U.S. press articles supporting this
 view.
