 Brezhnev's Absence Causing Unease( 5 ,~ )
 Soviet party leader Brezhnev's absence from
 public view has now stretched to almost seven
 weeks. His apparent inability to take part in the
 daily affairs of the party has probably resulted in
 some erosion of his personal authority and caused
 some unease within the party, but there has been
 no evidence of any challenge to his position.
 Brezhnev last appeared in public on Decem-
 ber 24, and since then he has made only two
 semi-public appearances. There has been no offi-
 cial explanation for his absence, and reports on
 the nature of Brezhnev's illness have been con-
 tradictory and highly speculative. Around mid-
 January, however, the emphasis in the rumors
 about Brezhnev began to shift from speculation
 about his health to his political well-being. Specu-
 lation in this direction fed on the setbacks to
 policies closely associated with Brezhnev: abroga-
 tion of the 1972 US-Soviet trade agreement, and
 the decision by the December plenum of the
 Central Committee to emphasize producer-goods
 industries over consumer-goods industries in the
 1975 economic plan.
 On January 8, an unusual Tass statement
 denied Western reports of political instability in
 the USSR and ridiculed those who publicize
 them. This has been followed by a concerted
 effort to keep Brezhnev's name before the public,
 with emphasis on his contribution to detente and
 on the importance of his role in past and future
 summit meetings. Recent speeches by Brezhnev's
 Politburo colleagues have also endorsed detente
 and have referred favorably to the General Secre-
 tary's personal role in the conduct of Soviet af-
 fairs.
 Meanwhile, Soviet leaders have attempted to
 create an atmosphere of normality in Moscow.
 Last month, three members of the Politburo
 made previously scheduled trips abroad, and
 Prime Minister Kosygin apparently spent most of
 January on vacation in the Caucasus. This week,
 Foreign Minister Gromyko made a swing through
 the Middle East, and other political leaders also
 seem to be following a business-as-usual routine.
 In spite of the atmosphere of normality,
 there have been some indications that Brezhnev's

 continued absence from the helm is causing con-
 cern among the ranks, and that the first tentative
 steps at political maneuvering within the leader-
 ship may have begun. On January 21, Pravda
 published a long article noting that the strength
 of the leadership is its collectivity. The article is
 somewhat ambiguous, but it may have been in-
 tended to reassure the rank and file that no one is
 indispensable and that continuity of leadership is
 assured by the collective, even in the absence of
 one of its members. The author's favorable refer-
 ence to long-range planning-which implies sta-
 bility and continuity-tends to support this
 interpretation, as do references by other leaders
 to Moscow's determination to continue detente.
 In Brezhnev's absence, leaders outside the
 charmed circle of the Kremlin have received
 varied treatment  in the Soviet press. V. V.
 Shcherbitsky, Ukrainian party first secretary and
 a full member of the Politburo, appeared in
 Pravda last month in an unfavorable light. Pravda
 reported that it had received a letter from the
 Ukrainian leader acknowledging the correctness
 of earlier criticism of affairs in his republic. On
 the other hand, the newspaper carried an article
 by G. V. Romanov, first secretary of the regional
 party organization in Leningrad and a candidate
 member of the  Politburo, which touted his
 region's economic success in 1974. Shcherbitsky
 and Romanov have sometimes been listed among
 possible successors to Brezhnev, and Pravda's dif-
 ferent treatment of the two men may be the first
 indication that there is maneuvering for position
 within the leadership.
 Such maneuvering, never far beneath the sur-
 face, can be expected to increase in the coming
 months as preparations begin for the next party
 congress, which should be held early in 1976. The
 picture is complicated, however, by the length of
 Brezhnev's absence, by his recent political set-
 backs, and by the doubts that have been raised
 about his physical well-being. On previous occa-
 sions, Brezhnev has disappeared for several weeks
 and then reappeared without any apparent dim-
 inution of his authority, but if he hopes to regain
 the momentum he seems to have lost this time
 and to write the script for the next congress, he
 must  reassert  his  political  vigor  fairly
 PORTUGAL: Political Turbulence    s) C_ I
 [Rumors of coups and cabinet reshuffles con-
 tinue to circulate in Lisbon as virtually all of
 Portugal's main ruling bodies deliberate what has
 been described as "revolutionary" legislation. The
 outcome of these deliberations, and particularly
 the final form of the economic plan, should pro-
 vide some insights into the relative strengths of
 leftists and moderates in Portugal.
 The Armed Forces Movement's Superior
 Council met often in the past week to draft the
 ground rules for the election campaign-due to
 begin on March 4-and to discuss the economic
 plan. The council also is expected to define
 "pluralistic  democracy" and the country's
 "antimonopolistic nature." The council's deci-
 sions will, in turn, be presented for approval to
 Page 2
 the cabinet and to the Movement's 200-member
 General Assembly late this week. Press accounts
 of the assembly's agenda indicate that it will
 discuss the economic plan and the establishment
 of the Movement as a permanent institution as
 well as its role in the constituent assembly.
 The draft economic plan has been the sub-
 ject of bitter debate for many months. Leftists
 have argued for the nationalization of most
 private industry and for redistribution of the
 country's arable land. Moderates acknowledge
 that too much of the country's wealth is con-
 centrated in too few hands, but have argued for
 gradual solutions that will avoid upsetting the
 nation's fragile economy.

 the Movement's leftist-

 changes in the constitution. The proposal would
 vastly increase the powers of the original seven-
 man junta, giving it the authority to legislate, to
 outlaw organizations not in sympathy with the
 "progressive forces," and authority to punish
 "reactionary" elements. The leftists may hope
 that such an arrangement would allow them to
 circumvent and thus neutralize the power of
 moderates in the Superior Council and assembly.

 VIETNAM: More Action Ahead
 ~
 -- II
 he week before Tet, the three-day Luna
 Need Year holiday beginning on February 11,
 witnessed a temporary lull in fighting, but most
 indications point to intensified action resuming
 again in the weeks ahead with heavy Communist
 attacks  directed  at  several  vulnerable  areas
 throughout the country.
 The principal area of concern focuses on Tay
 Ninh  City.  Communist  propaganda     has been
 warning residents. of heavy attacks. There are also
 tentative indications that units from the Commu-
 nists' 9th Division are shifting from their present
 positions in Binh Duong Province to spearhead
 the attacks. While these reports cannot be con-
 firmed, the 9th is the only Communist unit in the
 region that has riot seen combat recently and its
 units are believed fresh.
 Several reports also indicate that Viet Cong
 sapper units are making preparations for terrorist
 actions in Saigon. Members of these units report-
 edly are currently stocking supplies and muni-
 tions, identifying targets, and improving access
 routes into and out of the capital. While the
 government has taken steps to contain such activ-
 ity, it would be nearly impossible to prevent
 scattered attacks.
 There also are indications that the Commu-
 nists are preparing attacks against the Kien Tuong
 provincial capital of Moc Hoa. According to gov-
 ernment sources, units from the Communists' 5th
 Division will lead the assaults, although these
 same sources have claimed that in recent days
 South Vietnamese forces have inflicted heavy ca-
 sualties on the division's units. If these casualties
 have indeed been heavy, the 5th will probably not
 be used to attack a provincial capital that the
 South Vietnamese have indicated they will de-
 fend. The Communists are more apt to concen-
 trate on expanding their base areas and infiltra-
 tion routes and on harassing traffic on major
 roads and canals.
 In the northern section of the country, gov-
 ernment commanders are worried about poten-
 tially heavy Communist assaults against provincial
 capitals in the central highlands near the Cam-
 bodian border. The recent deployment of the
 North Vietnamese 968th Division into the Kon-
 tum/Pleiku province area has heightened this con-
 cern, along with tentative indications that another
 division-the 320th--may be moving south to at-
 tack targets in Darlac and Quang Duc provinces.
 In Military Region 1, some intensified action is
 anticipated in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai prov-
 inces, but government commanders remain confi-
 dent that if the Communists do not reinforce
 units in position, they can contain the attacks.
 Weather conditions will pose no constraints.
 Good fighting weather will continue from the
 highland provinces to the southern delta until
 April or May. The heavy monsoon rains in the
 northern  coastal  areas will begin tapering off

 GROMYKO'S MIDDLE EAST TRAVELS
 herhave
 Foreign Minister Gromyko made little progress in bridging the differences
 between the USSR and Egypt during his visit in
 Cairo this week.  He avoided acrimonious ex-
 changes with President Sadat that could have led
 to a further deterioration of relations, but the
 USSR and Egypt remain apart on key issues such
 as the Geneva conference and Soviet arms ship-
 ments.
 Although the Soviets seem resigned to the
 possibility of a new Egyptian-Israeli disengage-
 ment agreement, Moscow is still seeking some
 commitment from the Egyptians that the Soviets
 will be accorded a significant negotiating role in
 the subsequent rounds of negotiations. Earlier in
 the week, in an attempt to put pressure on Cairo,
 Gromyko and the Syrians had called for a re-
 sumption of the Geneva talks within one month.
 The Egyptians, however, resisted this Soviet gam-
 bit and agreed only to a less specific formula-
 tion-the "immediate" resumption of the talks.
 In the statement marking the end of the
 Cairo visit, the Egyptians conceded that Moscow
 should have a role in all aspects of the Middle
 East settlement. Sadat, nevertheless, made plain
 that he intended to continue to rely on Washing-
 ton's step-by-step approach to negotiations. Im-
 mediately after meeting with Gromyko, Sadat
 publicly stated that he continued to welcome the
 visit of Secretary Kissinger.
 Sadat noted that progress had been made on
 some bilateral issues, but added that others would
 have to wait until General Secretary Brezhnev
 visits Egypt. Gromyko clearly was unwilling to
 make any firm commitment regarding a future
 Brezhnev trip to Egypt; the joint statement on
 the Gromyko visit refers only to the importance
 of Brezhnev-Sadat exchanges. Sadat's public re-
 marks suggest that Cairo is once again making an
 issue out of a Brezhnev visit.
 One  of the unresolved  issues Sadat un-
 doubtedly had in mind was his demand for new
 Soviet agreements on arms. Although Moscow has
 said it would deliver arms ordered prior to the
 October war-and apparently did deliver some
 MIG-23s on the eve of Gromyko's arrival-it has
 refused to make new commitments. The issue of
 Egyptian payment of its arms debt also appears to
 remain unsettled.
 Gromyko's stay in Damascus seemed mainly
 aimed at strengthening his hand for his subse-
 quent discussions in Cairo. Although Gromyko
 reiterated the Soviet commitment to Syria's de-
 fense and signed some previously negotiated eco-
 nomic and scientific agreements, apparently no
 new aid was promised. While in Damascus, Gro-
 myko met with fedayeen leader Yasir Arafat and
 in a banquet speech referred, for the first time, to
 a Palestinian "state." At other times during his
 trip, however, Gromyko reverted to the usual   25X1
 vague Soviet formulations. This suggests that, at
 least for the present, Moscow is not initiating a
 major push on this issue.
 MALAGASY REPUBLIC: NEW LEADER
 r a  ca
 ,vv-r
 General Ramanantsoa, head of the Mala-
 gasy government since 1972, stepped down
 on February 5. He handed over full executive
 powers to  Lt. Collonel Richard Ratsiman-
 drava, head of the gendarmerie and farmer
 interior minister.
 Ramanantsoa had dissolved his cabinet
 late last month to diminish mounting political;
 tensions caused in part by a resurgence 1 of
 differences between the coastal tribes andthe
 Merina tribes of central Madagascar. Early
 January, officers-from - the coastal tribes had
 unsuccessfully attempted a coup. In- addition,
 the economic situation was getting worse, and
 personal rivalries within the government were
 growing more acute.
 Ratsimandrava, though; a Merina, has
 good relations with the coastal tribes. that
 dominated the government until Ramanant-
 soa came to power. These tribes have been
 given greater representation in the new cabi
 net. The new government's relations with the
 US are not expected to undergo any funda-
 mental change. Ratsimandrava has said pub
 licly that he will continue-_ Ramanantsoa's
 nonaligned policies.

 ETHIOPIA: FIGHTING IN ERITREA
 erious fighting between government forces
 and Insurgents broke out again in Eritrea Province
 last weekend after a lull of many months. Neither
 side is likely to score a decisive victory in the near
 future, and the resumed fighting could last for
 months if not years.
 In the fighting this week, the army suffered
 serious setbacks, forcing the ruling military coun-
 cil in Addis Ababa to send reinforcements. Gov-
 ernment forces will probably be able to maintain
 control of the provincial capital, Asmara, but
 they are not capable of preventing continued
 insurgent infiltration and terrorist attacks. The
 rebels probably have the capacity for increased
 activity, especially now that their two rival fac-
 tions are apparently cooperating against the gov-
 ernment. Their next targets may be the Red Sea
 ports of Massawa and Assab.
 A rebel attack on Ethiopian troops and
 installations in Asmara started the hostilities. The
 attack was evidently designed to pre-empt a re-
 sumption of operations by the army. Two days
 earlier, the council had announced it was ready to
 use force against the rebels.
 The army overreacted and went on a shoot-
 ing spree, firing indiscriminately at civilians and
 buildings. Casualties reportedly ran  into the
 hundreds.  Troops conducted a house-to-house
 search for arms and rebels, detaining many Eri-
 treans, and also engaged in considerable looting.
 Most of the firing in the city ended by February
 3,  although  sporadic  shooting  continued.
 Asmara's electricity and water systems were dis-
 abled; by the end of the week, the water shortage
 was becoming critical, and food supplies were
 running low.
 On February 1, the army began attacking
 rebel concentrations in the environs of Asmara.
 Air force planes made numerous sorties and
 bombed some villages. Most of the heavy fighting
 took place north of the city. The army suffered
 heavy casualties attempting to dislodge the rebels,
 who have spent the past several months estab-
 lishing strong  positions  around  Asmara.  An
 armored column with an estimated 600 reinforce-
 ments, which had left Addis Ababa before the
 fighting began, was stalled by an ambush about
 20 miles southwest of Asmara.
 The army has airlifted as many as 1,500
 troops into Asmara, however, bringing the total
 strength of regulars in the province to about
 11,000-about one third of the army. Most of the
 reinforcements came from the Addis Ababa area,
 but some were also brought in from other north-
 ern provinces. Fighter aircraft were sent from the
 main air base near Addis Ababa.
 Serious deficiencies in the Ethiopian army
 have been pointed up by the new fighting. Lead-
 ership reportedly is poor, and units have had
 difficulty coordinating their activities. Troop dis-
 cipline has been a problem, too. The army chief
 of staff apparently has arrived in Asmara to make
 a personal effort to remedy these deficiencies.
 For the provisional military government, the
 Eritrean conflict has become an acid test of lead-
 ership. A serious defeat in the field would almost
 certainly trigger a military revolt against the
 present rulers. In addition, the transfer of a large
 number of troops from Addis Ababa might en-
 courage some opponents of the council to at-
 tempt a coup regardless of how the fighting goes.
 Despite the dangers inherent in the Eritrean
 situation, the council is pushing ahead with its
 plans to impose a socialist regime on Ethiopia. A
 policy statement issued on February 3 announced
 the nationalization of  72 businesses and the
 acquisition of a controlling interest in 29 others.
 The edict affects textile, metal, and other enter-
 prises. The declaration condemns the middle class
 as the principal  prop of the old regime and
 glorifies the workers, peasants, soldiers, and intel-
 ligentsia as spearheading the Ethiopian revolution.
 While inviting foreign participation in the econ-
 omy, the declaration accuses foreign investors of
 exploiting Ethiopia in the past and states the
 government's intention to maintain strict control
 over their activities in the future.

 IRAQ: NO KURDISH COUNTER-OFFENSIVE
 Kurdish forces apparently will not launch a
 major winter counter-offensive to retake ground
 lost to government troops last summer and fall, as
 they have done in past Iraqi-Kurdish wars. This
 time, both sides seem content to stay in their
 present positions and wait for spring.
 Iranian officials along the border say the
 Kurds have failed to move because they lack
 heavy arms and because relatively mild weather
 has permitted a fairly high level of Iraqi air ac-
 tivity. The Kurds are also facing a larger, better
 equipped force than in previous campaigns. The
 Kurds nevertheless believe they can hold their
 remaining territory with the arms they now have,
 according to the Iranians. Kurdish leader Bar-
 zani's forces have been pushed into a narrow strip
 of mountainous territory along the border with
 Iran. The Iranians report that rebel morale is good
 and that Barzani retains the loyalty of most
 Kurds, despite the military reverses in the summer
 and fall.
 The rebels apparently continue to pin their
 hopes on forcing a change in Baghdad's Kurdish
 policy, or perhaps even a change in regime, by
 Page  7
 inflicting an  unacceptable level  of casualties
 through shellings, brief attacks on Iraqi forward
 positions, and guerrilla actions in rear areas. The
 Kurds also occupy good defensive positions and
 dislodging them would be costly. Baghdad seems
 intent on winning a military victory, however,
 and appears ready to resume its offensive in the
 spring. Kurdish military inactivity this winter will
 make the role of Iran even more crucial in the
 coming months.
 The flow of refugees, like the fighting, has
 slowed considerably. Local officials expect it to
 resume  when the weather improves. Some
 refugees from  northwestern  Kurdistan were
 caught on the Iraqi side of the border by the
 onset of winter weather. There are now an es-
 timated 137,000 Kurdish refugees in camps in
 northwestern Iran.

 MOZAMBIQUE: FIVE MONTHS TO GO
 )Prime Minister Chissano and other leaders of
 the !four-month-old transitional government are
 projecting an image of calm purposefulness as the
 territory moves toward independence, scheduled
 for June 25. The future, however, is clouded with
 political and economic uncertainties.
 The Front for the Liberation of Mozam-
 bique-the nationalist group that dominates the
 transitional  government-has  been  trying  to
 broaden its political base in the territory. Front
 officials  are giving  high  priority to political
 mobilization, and party functionaries are fanning
 out over the countryside preaching "Unity, Work,
 and Vigilance" and pushing literacy and health
 campaigns. These efforts apparently have won the
 Front some new backers, although many people
 may support the organization only because it is
 the sole legal political party.
 In recent weeks, the government has devoted
 much of its time to economic matters. A Portu-
 guese delegation arrived on January 19 to discuss
 economic issues, including the establishment of a
 central bank and the future development of the
 (Tabora Bassa hydroelectric project. The UN also
 is sending an economic survey team to the ter-
 ritory, but specialists in Lisbon and Lourenco
 Marques are reportedly encountering difficulties
 in collecting reliable statistics for potential donors
 of aid.
 Meanwhile, signs of economic decline are
 becoming visible throughout the territory, accord-
 ing to the US consul general. Food staples are in
 short supply, transportation facilities are con-
 gested, and industries are unable to obtain spare
 parts and raw materials. Unemployment and labor
 unrest are widespread in the major urban centers.
 In  rural  areas,  farmers  are cutting back on
 planting, and many white-owned farms and rural
 stores are being abandoned.
 Chissano's public statements have been
 marked by pragmatism and moderation, and the
 government has urged everyone to work for a
 strong, multiracial society. Nonetheless, there has
 been a significant exodus of whites-perhaps in
 excess of 20,000-since Portugal agreed  last
 September to turn over political power to the
 Front. This exodus has seriously drained the ter-
 ritory  of  professional  and technically skilled
 people as well as of needed white- and blue-collar
 workers.
 The government hopes many whites will
 come back if the security situation remains calm
 and the economy picks up. Its efforts to encour-
 age their return have not been helped, however,
 by vague allusions from officials to future eco-
 nomic and social changes and by statements from
 Front President Samora Machel that reflect a
 predilection for Marxism. Machel will probably
 become the first president of Mozambique when
 it gains independence.
 Public order has not been seriously disturbed
 since a short-lived outbreak of violence last Octo-
 ber that was sparked by a clash between Portu-
 guese commandos and troops of the Front. Portu-
 guese forces are being gradually withdrawn on
 schedule and will be gone by June. Meanwhile,
 Front and Portuguese troops are cooperating in
 enforcing strict security measures. Many blacks
 and whites have been detained on vague charges
 of "opposing the decolonization process." For
 the most part, these charges are leveled at mem-
 bers of anti-Front political groups that emerged
 following the coup in Lisbon last year and are
 now defunct.
 Racial tensions remain a potentially serious
 problem  for  the  government,  particularly  in
 northern Mozambique where suspicions between
 the two races have always been strong. There,
 many whites have abandoned      the towns and
 cities. Anti-white wall slogans are becoming com-
 mon, and curfews are being  imposed against
 whites in certain areas. In such an atmosphere,
 rumors or a minor incident could park a serious
 racial clash.

 ,moll
 overnment fortunes sagged this week as the
 Khmer Communists began mining the Mekong
 River. On February 3, mines destroyed three tugs
 in a convoy returning to South Vietnam and two
 days later, mines sank three more tugs in a small
 convoy attempting the run upriver. The remnants
 of the latest convoy turned back to South Viet-
 nam. Civilian crews and shipowners may now
 refuse to risk the trip upriver, no matter what
 monetary incentives are offered. Cambodian navy
 personnel could man civilian vessels, but getting
 the permission of civilian owners for them to do
 so could be difficult.
 Even if civilian owners turn their vessels over
 to the navy, the Cambodians will have trouble
 accumulating enough tugs and cargo vessels to
 move the necessary supplies upstream. Already,
 three tankers, two coastal steamers, six tugs, and
 a number -of barges, junks, and navy craft have
 been  lost.  Most of the vessels that made it
 through have been heavily damaged. The region is
 being scoured for more cargo barges-which are
 less vulnerable to shellings than ships-but it may
 be impossible to round up enough to carry all of
 Phnom Penh's supply requirements.
 US officials have informed the government
 that a major airlift of supplies into Phnom Penh is
 not a realistic alternative to the Mekong supply
 route, and military commanders can be expected
 to make a major effort to improve security along
 the river. Beachheads along the lower reaches of
 the river will probably be reinforced, and the
 navy will use what little mine-sweeping equip-
 ment it has to try to clear the shipping channel. A
 massive infusion of manpower could probably
 push the insurgents back from the river banks,
 but unless Communist pressure against Phnom
 Penh's outer defenses eases, such large numbers of
 troops will not be available.
 The Khmer Communists have been on the
 attack in the Phnom Penh area for almost five
 weeks. The Cambodian army has done a credit-
 able job in containing the insurgents in most
 sectors around the capital, but has been unable to
 gain the upper hand. Some army units-particu-
 larly the 7th Division manning the city's north-
 western defenses-are being chewed up. Govern-
 ment commanders are shoring up weak points
 with units from less active fronts. Reinforcements
 will begin to run short, however, if the Commu-
 nists sustain their attacks.
 From their footholds near the city, insurgent
 gunners  have  launched  daily  attacks  against
 Phnom    Penh  proper  and  outlying facilities-
 -including Pochentong airport. Nearly 500 rock-
 ets have hit in and around Phnom Penh since the
 beginning of the year, according to government
 figures. Given the volume of fire, damage has
 been relatively light, but the psychological impact
 is beginning to show. On February 5, the French
 embassy began advising members of the capital's
 sizable French community to be prepared to evac-
 uate dependents. The departure of large numbers
 of French could precipitate an exodus of foreign-
 ers that would cause government morale to drop
 further.
 The supply situation in Phnom Penh is still
 tolerable, but will not remain so for long. The
 three convoys in January delivered about a two
 weeks' supply of ammunition and rice. Ammuni-
 tion stocks on January 31 were sufficient to sus-
 tain the current level of fighting for three weeks,
 and stocks are being supplemented by air deliv-
 eries. With rationing, enough rice is on hand to
 meet military and civilian needs for over five
 weeks.
 Stocks of most fuels will last through the
 end of the month. Unless these stocks are replen-
 ished soon, the government will have to take
 drastic steps, such as closing rice-distribution cen-
 ters and ordering sharp cutbacks in civilian fuel
 consumption. Civilian morale will sink as such
 measures are implemented. The government's op-
 tions for conserving military supplies are more
 limited. If the situation deteriorates further, it
 may have to consider abandoning territory in the
 countryside in order to concentrate its resources
 on the defense Qf Phnom Penh and the Me-
 kong.

 THAILAND: SEARCH FOR A GOVERNMENT
 Thailand's newly elected National Assembly
 officially convened on February 5 amid con-
 tinuing behind-the-scenes negotiations aimed at
 forming  a coalition  government.  Although
 Democrat Party leader Seni Pramot was given
 assurances of support from the political right last
 week in his efforts to form a government, he ran
 into trouble over the distribution of cabinet
 portfolios. One of the key prospective members
 of Seni's coalition, the conservative Thai Nation
 Party, threatened to stay out of the government
 unless given the powerful Ministry of Interior, a
 demand that the Democrats are unwilling to
 accept. Seni received another setback on Feb-
 ruary 6 when the Democrat Party's candidate for
 speaker of the lower house lost out to Prasit
 Kanchanawat, the candidate of the political right.
 Although the Democrats won the largest
 number of seats in the 269-man assembly-72-
 and may still be able to prevail upon parties of
 the political center and left to join in a coalition
 in an effort to keep the conservatives out of
 office, it seems clear that their chances of doing
 so  have  eroded.  There  is evidence that the
 rightists have begun maneuvering to put together
 Should the conservatives' maneuvers suc-
 ceed, chances for political stability over the short
 run would significantly increase. Although a con-
 servative coalitiion would be unpalatable to large
 segments of the press and intellectual community,
 it would enjoy the support of the military, a
 factor that is no less important today than when
 Thailand  was  governed  by  military  rule.  A
 Democrat-led coalition, lacking crucial conserva-
 tive support, would be extremely vulnerable to
 challenges from the conservative bloc in the lower

 the national referendum scheduled for February
 12. Pak's reasons for seeking at least the appear-

 tactical. He hopes to:
 ? Put  his  domestic  opponents  on the
 defensive; they had been planning a major
 anti-government campaign this spring,
 ? Lay the public relations groundwork for
 new suppressive measures if an opposition
 campaign materializes.
 ? Demonstrate to audiences at home and
 abroad--particularly in the US-that his op-
 position, though vocal, has relatively little
 support nationally.
 A basic defect of Pak's referendum process,
 of course, is that it will solve none of his political
 headaches.  His  opponents  will  continue  to
 demand limitations on his power, no matter what
 the final vote tally.

 NORTH KOREA: TROUBLES WITH TRADE
 [ 33 - 43
 )Pyongyang is having difficulties financing its
 trade with Western countries. These problems
 could reverse North Korea's recent economic tilt
 toward the West as well as seriously dampen
 prospects for Pyongyang's ambitious industrializa-
 tion program.
 North Korea's success in industrialization
 has been linked to its ability to acquire foreign
 industrial equipment and technology on credit. In
 the past, the availability of Soviet and Chinese
 loans fluctuated with the changing political cli-
 mate, while the North's bellicose attitude toward
 South Korea during the 1950s and 1960s in-
 hibited financial arrangements with the West.
 In  recent years,  however,  North Korea's
 persistent efforts to expand trade ties and its
 more flexible posture in a changing international
 environment have led to greater access to Western
 credit. Since early 1970, the North Koreans have
 signed contracts with firms in Japan and Western
 Europe for nearly $600 million worth of indus-
 trial plants and related equipment, most of which
 is being financed by medium-term credits.
 Credit financing for capital imports, as well
 as for record grain imports from France, Canada,
 and Argentina, permitted North Korea to run a
 1973 trade deficit of almost $170 million with
 non-Communist countries. A surge in equipment
 deliveries raised the deficit to at least $300 mil-
 lion last year. In 1970 and 1971, this trade was
 roughly in balance.
 In the past several months, reports of Pyong-
 yang's payments problems have been increasing.
 By December, for example, North Korea was in
 arrears on a large number of letters of credit
 issued to Japanese and West European banks. In
 addition, in late 1974, reluctance by the French
 government to authorize further credits to North
 Korea was holding up the sale of French hel-
 icopters, and by the end of the year, North Korea
 was delinquent in the payment of $40 million in
 outstanding loans from French banks. In January,
 therefore,  several West European  banks were
 reducing loans to North Korea because it is a poor
 credit risk, and the Japanese Export-Import Bank
 SECRET
 had temporarily halted new plant credits to North
 Korea.
 Rising import payments and lower than ex-
 pected earnings from metals exports probably are
 major causes underlying Pyongyang's difficulties
 in handling payments to Western creditors. The
 North Koreans' inexperience in Western trade and
 finance has been compounded by the rising cost
 of Western machinery and credit over the past
 two  years.  Pyongyang  probably  also  overes-
 timated its ability to expand export earnings,    25X1
 which did well until the Western industrial boom
 turned sour and prices for some of the North's
 principal export commodities fell.

 INDONESIA: THE TIMOR PROBLEM
 1Lq - LGT
 Lisbon's decision to dismantle its colonial
 empire has rekindled irredentist feelings in Ja-
 karta toward Portuguese possessions on Timor
 Island. In addition to an emotional belief that
 Portuguese Timor rightfully belongs to Indonesia
 by virtue of geography and history, Jakarta's
 leaders fear that an independent Timor state
 would be inherently unstable and thus a threat to
 Indonesia's national security. Last year, President
 Suharto assigned his close confidant General Ali
 Murtopo the task of arranging the peaceful ab-
 sorption  of Timor  into  Indonesia.  Murtopo's
 assignment was to engineer the victory of pro-
 Indonesia forces in a plebiscite on the future
 status of Timor planned by Lisbon for sometime
 in 1975.
 the fortunes of Timorese
 elements favoring merger with Indonesia have not
 improved. Indeed, their cause was recently set
 back when the two largest political groups in
 Timor announced on January 22 that they were
 forming a united front to work for independence.
 Last week, a delegation of government offi-
 cials, businessmen, and political party representa-
 tives from Timor went to Lisbon to discuss the
 future of the overseas province. Jakarta has re-
 ports that the governor of Portuguese Timor has
 designated  this  group  as  a  "constituent  as-
 sembly," and the Indonesians fear that Lisbon
 may negotiate with the delegation for the im-
 mediate  independence  of  Timor.  The                            pro-
 Indonesia                          party boycotted the delegation to
 avoid being associated with any adverse decision
 it might reach.
 Jakarta is at a disadvantage in dealing with
 Lisbon. Indonesia has no embassy in Portugal and
 has only recently reopened diplomatic relations,
 which were severed in 1964 by Sukarno in protest
 over Portuguese colonial policies. Jakarta's lack of
 first-hand information on the situation in Lisbon
 fuels its concern about recent political develop-
 ments there. Indonesian leaders believe that the
 Communists are gaining ever greater influence in
 the Portuguese government and that this will
 ultimately spread to Timor as well.
 The  recent developments  in  Timor and
 Lisbon can only strengthen the hand of those
 among Suharto's advisers who have been ad-
 vocating a military take-over of the province. In
 the past, Suharto has fended them off on the
 grounds that force would be unnecessary and
 could cause an adverse international reaction. If
 Lisbon's  present discussions with the visiting
 Timorese delegates result in approval for early
 independence, however, the pressure on Suharto
 will intensify, and he may succumb to arguments
 that national security interests override possible
 diplomatic, problems.

 posts, most of which were vacated immediately
 after the fall of former defense minister Lin Piao
 in September 1971. There is still no formally
 designated head of the logistics department, but
 an aging military veteran has apparently been
 filling this slot for over a year.
 The two new appointees are civilians, which
 is unusual, but the move is consistent with the
 drive to strengthen party control over the mili-
 tary. The movement of civilians into the posts
 does not in itself assure the downgrading of mili-
 tary political power. Military men, especially in
 the provinces, have been tenaciously hanging on
 to their political influence despite strong pressure,
 in part from Chairman Mao personally, who still
 appears anxious to press the military to the limit.
 The risk of a showdown with the military ap-
 peared to be more than Premier Chou En-lai was
 willing to run last summer, and he and his sup-
 porters  apparently  chose  to  concentrate  on
 completing  preparations for the recently con-
 cluded National People's Congress. Now that the
 government house has been put in order, further
 maneuvering  against  provincial  military com-
 mands may occur.
 The new chief of staff, Teng Hsiao-ping, is
 the ranking vice premier and has been filling in
 for Premier Chou En-Iai since he entered the
 hospital last year. Teng had a distinguished mili-
 tary career during the civil war, but has been a
 party and government administrator since then.
 Teng has a well-earned reputation as a disciplinar-
 ian.
 Chang Chun-chiao, the new head of the Gen-
 eral Political Department, rose to the top party
 post in Shanghai as a result of the Cultural Revo-
 lution. He appears to have been working fairly
 closely with moderate elements in the leadership
 in the past several years.
 been the first political commissar of the Nanking
 Military Region since 1967, but he does not have
 an extensive military background. He is reported
 Both Teng and Chang are members of the
 Politburo standing committee, and Teng was ele-
 vated to the rank of party vice chairman at a
 party plenum earlier this month. Their unusually
 high rank lends emphasis to the party's desire to
 assert control over the military establishment.
 Furthermore, Teng had been reappointed to the
 Politburo and named a vice chairman of the par-
 ty's military commission  in conjunction with
 an earlier move to undercut military political
 power--the late December 1973 rotation of the
 military region commanders.
 There was almost certainly opposition
 from the political left to Teng's appointment; he
 had been purged and heavily criticized during the
 Cultural Revolution.
 Teng will probably enlarge his role in mili-
 tary policy-making, but it is not yet clear whether
 he will take a firm hand in day-to-day military
 affairs. His broad government duties would seem
 to demand much of his time, unless Premier
 Chou's health permits him to resume a more
 active role in government affairs. It is also possi-
 ble that Teng will rely heavily on his eight deputy
 chiefs of staff, several of whom possess the neces-
 sary experience to fill the job themselves.
 Chang Chun-chiao is now one of the handful
 of leaders who hold top party, government, and
 army posts. He seems to have been acting as party
 secretary general, but his new military duties do
 not conflict with his performance of this impor-
 tant party function. The concentration of power
 tends to increase central control, but it could
 create problems over the longer term if the in-
 cumbents depart the political stage, thus creating
 a number of vacancies that may be difficult to

 TURKEY REACTS TO US AID CUT
 Turkey has said it WI I review i s ties with
 NATO and is considering retaliatory moves
 against certain US defense facilities in response to
 the cutoff of US military assistance that went
 into effect on February 5. At the same time, the
 Turks appear to be hardening their line toward
 Cyprus and may decide to proclaim the part of
 the island under their control an independent
 Turkish Cypriot state.
 In a press conference in Nicosia on February
 5, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said that
 if Ankara agreed, he was ready to form an in-
 dependent state in the northern part of the island.
 He indicated that such a Turkish Cypriot state
 would exist autonomously until such time as it
 might be confederated with whatever the Greek
 Cypriots establish in the southern part of the
 island.
 A Turkish  Foreign  Ministry official sub-
 sequently claimed that Turkey had received no
 such proposal from Denktash but that Ankara
 was studying the text of the Turkish Cypriot
 leader's press statement. Strong indications that
 the Turks intend to harden their position on
 Cyprus in response to the US aid halt, coupled
 with a statement from former prime minister
 ish Cypriot Leader Denktash

 Ecevit that "the legal framework of the Turkish
 Cypriot state should be established" before talks
 on a final settlement, suggest Ankara may favor
 the move.
 Turkish
 forces on Cyprus were placed on alert in 'antici-
 pation of announcements to be made on Feb-
 ruary 5." This suggests that the Turkish com-
 mander on Cyprus may have expected a procla-
 mation of independence and was prepared to
 make some adjustments in the cease-fire lines,
 possibly to create more secure boundaries or to
 include some desirable areas in the Turkish sector.
 In addition to considering what action to
 take on Cyprus, the Turkish government is study-
 ing various other retaliatory moves against the US
 for the halt in military assistance. Prime Minister
 Irmak's initial reaction was to lash out at the US
 Congress, terming the aid halt a unilateral aban-
 donment of obligations required by a military
 defense alliance and, therefore, an  "unlawful
 act." He said the action would necessitate changes
 in Turkey's contribution -to NATO, but the main
 impact would be on the US presence in Turkey.
 Various possibilities appear to be under con-
 sideration, ranging from charging rent for US use
 of Turkish facilities to canceling some US base
 rights.
 The press in Ankara is reporting that
 other measures are under consideration, including
 a call for an emergency meeting of the NATO
 defense committee and a ban on US Sixth Fleet
 calls at Turkish ports.
 Most observers expect a rapid rise in anti-
 Americanism  that could bring demonstrations
 directed against US installations or personnel. So
 far, however, there has been no great public
 outcry, although the press has carried several
 hard-hitting stories and editorials.

 EC: DEVELOPING TIES            1-76 l 71
 The EC completed negotiations last week on
 a comprehensive five-year trade-and-aid package
 with 46 African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries.
 It was immediately hailed by community officials
 as a model for the West's future relations with the
 Third World. Leaders on both sides expect the
 signing of the agreement in Lome, Togo, on Feb-
 ruary 28 to mark an important step toward the
 "equality" of relations between rich and poor
 nations.
 The agreement, to be known as the Lome
 Convention, provides for free entry to the EC of
 all industrial products and 96 percent of the agri-
 cultural exports of the 46 developing countries.
 Additional protocols were negotiated on indus-
 trial cooperation, financial aid, and-perhaps most
 significant as a precedent-a program that guaran-
 tees developing countries "stable" earnings from
 key commodity exports.
 EC association agreements. European industry has
 also become increasingly aware of its need to
 secure access to raw materials as well as to expand
 its overseas markets. EC trade with the African,
 Caribbean, and Pacific states is already substan-
 tial; the community absorbs over 50 percent of
 their exports, and supplies more than 40 percent
 of their imports.
 The most innovative provision of the new
 convention is the program designed to protect the
 developing countries from deteriorating terms of
 trade by stabilizing their export earnings. Twelve
 agricultural  products and  iron  ore have been
 included in this scheme. In addition, over the
 next five years the EC will provide $4.1 billion in
 development assistance. This replaces the Third
 European Development Fund, which since 1969
 has made almost $1 billion available to the signa-
 tories of the Yaounde Convention.
 Led by Senegal and Nigeria, the 46 were
 remarkably cohesive throughout the negotiations,
 given the complexity of the economic issues and
 the political diversity among them-in particular
 between the French- and English-speaking Afri-
 cans. This explains, in great part, the "generosity"
 of the community in the new arrangements.
 The agreement replaces the Yaounde Con-
 vention, which expired on January 31 and linked
 the Nine with 19 African states. The Lome agree-
 ment establishes new ties between the Nine and
 18 commonwealth countries that became eligible
 for preferential treatment under the terms of
 Britain's accession to the EC. Also participating in
 the negotiations were Kenya, Uganda, and Tan-
 zania, which were already linked to the EC by a
 1969 accord, and six independent African states,
 which had had no previous ties to the EC.
 The need for a new agreement grew out of
 the recognition that the addition of three new
 members to the community in January 1973
 would require the renegotiation of the existing
 The most difficult negotiations centered on
 the price the EC will pay for imported sugar.
 Caribbean sugar producers, hoping to take advan-
 tage of still high world sugar prices, initially
 demanded four times the current EC price and
 guarantees on future sugar imports. Responding
 to pressure from UK refiners of cane sugar, the
 community agreed to guarantee the import of 1.4
 million tons of sugar yearly at a price not lower
 than the EC support price. In separate negotia-
 tions, the UK agreed to pay more for its sugar
 than the community, but this was only about half
 that demanded by the sugar producers.
 Preferences for EC exports in the devel-
 oping-country markets-opposed by the US-were
 a highly political issue in the negotiations. In the
 face of French opposition, the 46 succeeded in
 eliminating any such reciprocal obligations from
 the new agreement. It is now up to the developing
 countries to grant reverse preferences if they
 wish, but only Senegal, the Ivory Coast, and pos-
 sibly one or two other states will do so.
 Both sides will meet regularly at the min-
 isterial and the ambassadorial level to administer

 SPAIN: POLITICAL STIRRINGS
 oz  7 ~'
 Prime Minister Arias must soon make a
 decision to expedite formation of political as-
 sociations if they are to provide the means for
 liberalizing the political system as he intends.
 Meanwhile, his government's crackdown  on
 strikers has helped diminish labor agitation, al-
 though this let-up may be only temporary.
 Manuel Fraga Iribarne, an ambitious, reform-
 minded politician who is now Spain's ambassador
 to London, is reported to be ready to form a
 political association. He is holding up any an-
 nouncement, however, while awaiting a formal
 response from  Prime Minister Arias to his
 demands for progress on a wide range of political,
 economic, and social reforms. It is not clear
 whether chief of state Franco is aware of Fraga's
 intentions, but Franco in the past has turned a
 deaf ear to such proposals.
 Fraga sounded out prominent government,
 military, and other figures during a visit to Madrid
 last month. He concluded that the government
 was favorably disposed toward his project and
 that Arias would provide guarantees assurin
 lend momentum to Arias' new law permitting
 associations. The law on such associations became
 effective on January 12, but no significant group
 has yet applied. Moderate and liberal groups fear
 that their activities would  be restricted  by
 Franco's  National  Movement,  to  which   the
 statute  assigns  supervisory  responsibilities. If
 Fraga makes his move, however, several other
 prominent politicians may form their own asso-
 ciations.
 Meanwhile, the government's carrot-and-
 stick approach to labor problems may have been a
 factor in reducing the strike wave. The interior
 minister's declaration three weeks ago that the
 government will maintain labor peace and prevent
 labor disputes from disrupting public order has
 had an inhibiting effect on the workers.
 At the same time, the government has been
 granting a significant number of compulsory
 arbitration decisions more or less favorable to the
 workers' demands. The government also unveiled
 its long-promised bill on labor relations, which
 will go to the Cortes for debate. Although the bill
 provides for improvements in working conditions
 and strengthens the workers' legal rights, it omits
 any reference to the right to strike or to worker
 participation in management. These key issues
 reportedly will be dealt with in future laws.
 One of the bitterest strikes-at an auto plant
 in   Barcelona-has ended, reportedly because
 Spanish Communist Party members withdrew.
 They were the dominant element in the Workers
 Commission that was promoting the strike. The
 Communists evidently decided that further strike
 activity at this time would be too costly. But the
 key grievance-the workers' charge that the of-
 ficial shop stewards elected four years ago no
 longer represented their interests-has not been
 settled. Although strike activity may taper off as
 more labor contracts are concluded, the failure to
 settle important grievances makes further flare-
 Prime Minister Arias would like to see some-
 one of Fraga's stature launch an association to
 ups of labor unrest likely.

 Latin America
 TRADE ACT DERAILS D.ALOGUE
 7(, --7'
 (The Latin Americans' continuing reaction
 against the newly passed US Trade Reform Act
 demonstrates their commitment to regional sol-
 idarity,  their rebellion against the traditional
 world economic "order," and their impatience
 with US policy and priorities. A recent OAS res-
 olution against the act has mobilized further
 Latin pressure on this and other issues.
 Clashing with the US-a technique favored
 by the more assertive governments in the area-
 discomfits some of the Latin countries, such as
 Chile and the smaller republics, but even these
 have come to value the force of a united stand.
 Consensus is difficult to rally among the Latins,
 however, given their great differences in political
 outlook and economic conditions. But an issue
 like the trade act commands easy agreement as a
 symbol of all that is wrong, in their eyes, with US
 treatment of the rest of the hemisphere. Specific
 grievances vary from country to country, but all
 generally fall under the broad notion that the
 industrialized world makes a conscious effort to
 perpetuate a status quo in which the Third World
 is denied access to power and development. Only
 two Latin governments are affected by the trade
 act's provisions against OPEC, yet all are offended
 by the principle of retaliation, and many view the
 overall  character of the legislation as protec-
 tionist.
 Even more than a reaction to the trade act
 itself, the unanimous OAS condemnation  on
 January 23 was an expression of frustration over
 the non-productiveness of the "dialogue"--the
 informal sessions with the US secretary of state
 from which the Latins initially expected rapid
 and dramatic results. The Argentines, weighing
 the possibility for a constructive dialogue against
 the risks of confrontation over the trade act and
 the Cuba issue, decided-as host-to postpone the
 next foreign ministers meeting set for March.
 Most of the governments seem content to relegate
 inter-American discussion with the US to the
 OAS; they think it is up to the US, not Latin
 America, to set the dialogue back on track. The
 trade act, meanwhile, has been placed on the
 agendas of several all-Latin forums such as the
 OAS meeting in Atlanta, 1974
 Andean Pact, the Inter-American Economic and
 Social Council, and a proposed summit meeting
 of Latin and Caribbean presidents.
 The next scheduled forum in which the
 Latins will meet en masse with the US is the OAS
 General Assembly in April. Although the OAS is
 widely regarded as an ineffectual organization,
 the next assembly promises to be lively. The
 agenda will encompass not only continuing issues
 between the Latins and the US, but the still
 touchy Cuba problem as well as plans to revitalize
 the OAS and the election of a new secretary
 general, whose role many would like to re-define.
 Some Latins still see promise for a rekindled
 "dialogue" in the projected visit to several coun-
 tries by the US secretary of state. Even Peru,
 whose relations with the US are under continuing
 strain and whose President prefers a "dialogue in
 Spanish" among the Latins without the US and
 Brazil, has made a point of keeping an invitation

 VENEZUELA: IMAGE BUILDING.
 1-,c -tPs]
 President Carlos Andres Perez' drive for
 Latin American leadership is gathering momen-
 tum, but his relations with the US are under
 severe strain. The Venezuelans are publicly elated
 with their recent success in rallying Latin Amer-
 ican condemnation of the US Trade Reform Act
 and the subsequent postponement of the foreign
 ministers conference, which is interpreted in
 Caracas as further enhancing Perez' prestige as a
 hemispheric leader. Local political support has
 been unanimous in describing the government's
 efforts as a "diplomatic triumph."
 Thus far, there has been little reaction in
 Venezuela to the two amendments recently
 introduced in the US Congress that would exempt
 Venezuela and Ecuador from provisions of the
 trade act, but a few politicians have claimed that
 even with the amendments, the act would still
 apply against other OPEC members and that the
 move was an obvious attempt to break OPEC
 unity. In the present atmosphere of suspicion and
 confrontation, this point could find official favor.
 Perez does not intend to back down in the
 dispute with Washington. Rather, there are indica-
 tions that he intends to pursue these issues at a
 number of forums this year. He has already an-
 nounced he will attend thee OPEC summit meet-
 ing in Algiers, scheduled for early next month.
 The meeting is expected to focus on developing
 coordinated OPEC positions for discussions with
 oil importers. The gathering will give Perez an
 opportunity to achieve maximum publicity in
 seeking OPEC support for his current dispute
 with the US.
 In a related move, Perez has advanced the
 timetable for a summit meeting of all Latin Amer-
 ican chiefs of state to be held in Caracas in March.
 An` agenda has not yet been circulated, but Perez
 probably intends to have the gathering focus on
 proposals for reorganizing the OAS, establishing a
 permanent forum where Latin leaders can meet to
 discuss common problems, setting a fair market
 price for Latin raw material exports, and creating
 a Latin American economic system. At the meet-
 ing of Central American presidents last December
 in Puerto Ordaz in Venezuela, President Perez
 circulated the first elaboration of the proposal for
 a new, exclusively Latin economic organization
 that was  launched  by  Mexican  President
 Echeverria last summer. The group would have a
 mandate to promote economic cooperation and
 development  among  Latin  nations through
 regional programs and policy coordination. Perez
 undoubtedly sees it as an umbrella for various

 Venezuelan bilateral and multilateral initiatives as
 well as being a forum for discussions of the Latin
 American position on economic issues relating to
 the industrialized countries, particularly the US.
 But such a new organization, clearly identified
 with Venezuelan leadership, would also enhance
 Perez' efforts to establish himself more firmly as a
 Latin American leader.
 Notwithstanding  the  present  controversy
 with Washington, Perez is intelligent enough not
 to want to jeopardize the economic interests of
 his country in a prolonged and venomous dispute
 with the US. Venezuela will need access to US
 technology, if not capital, and the US will con-
 tinue to be the natural market for Venezuelan
 oil. Nevertheless, several influential Venezuelans
 have privately expressed concern that relations
 are drifting toward a confrontation. They char-
 acterize Perez as supremely confident and likely
 to react precipitately to what he sees as slights
 from the US.
 Secure at home and with his international
 image enhanced, Perez can be expected to devote
 a large amount of his time in the next few months
 not only to the OPEC and Latin summit meetings
 but also to developing closer bilateral contacts
 with Third World and Latin nations. Several trips
 to Latin countries are already planned as well as
 visits to Paris, and possibly other European cap-
 itals. Relations with the US will probably con-
 tinue to be strained until a new relationship has
 been worked out.
 ARGENTINA: LOPEZ REGA CONTROVERSY
 [s~--s5
 n effort probably was made Lt week,
 while Argentine President Maria Estela Peron was
 at an Atlantic beach resort, to clip the wings of
 her controversial adviser, Lopez Rega. The effort
 was apparently spearheaded by the military high
 command, which voiced concern about his ac-
 tivities to the President and appealed for a lessen-
 ing of his visibility in order to allay fears that he
 is running the country.
 The military leaders probably did not-and
 will not-press their case very hard because they
 fear this might cause Mrs. Peron to step down.
 Such a development could well present the armed
 forces with  political  problems that they still
 prefer to avoid. In any case, government sources
 are attempting to play down Lopez Rega's in-
 fluence and are lashing out about  "rumor-
 mongering." Several ministers have denied that
 there was a struggle over the issue. Meanwhile,
 there is no evidence that Lopez Rega's power has,
 in fact, been curtailed.
 By his own statement, the President's chief
 aide has tried to dispel charges against him by
 denying that he has any political function, stress-
 ing that he is on an equal footing with other
 ministers, and insisting that his relations with the
 military are good. While he tried to assure the
 public that he intends to confine himself to his
 proper duties, the US embassy believes that his
 interpretation was based more on subterfuge than
 on fact.
 The President will probably ask Interior Min-
 ister Rocamora to take a more prominent hand in
 government affairs in order to move the spotlight
 from Lopez Rega. She has used this tactic in the
 past when the sniping at the presidential secretary
 threatened to undermine confidence in her gov-
 ernment. Indeed, an interview with the interior
 minister published on  February 2 seemed to
 indicate that his standing had been boosted,
 ostensibly at Lopez Rega's expense. At the same
 time, Rocamora brushed aside charges that the
 formation of the new presidential secretariat was
 an exercise in empire-building. He explained that
 because Lopez Rega is the President's closest con-
 fidant, he is bound to come into conflict with
 others.
 It is very probable that Rocamora was acting
 at Mrs. Peron's behest to quash damaging rumors
 implying that a rift exists within the government.
 The major political actors, however, are not going
 to be fooled by cosmetic changes. As long as
 Lopez Rega maintains his hold over the President,
 he will cause strains among the country's political
 forces.

 CHILE: STILL TRYING           I          I
 The military government's continuing effort
 to improve its international image has picked up
 some momentum as Santiago mounts strenuous
 diplomatic efforts to blunt attacks at the Geneva
 meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission.
 Twenty-six  detainees,  including  several
 leaders of the Radical Party whose freedom had
 been actively sought by Venezuela, were tabbed
 for release and deportation to Caracas this week.
 Another list of 17 who have been processed for
 exile was disclosed, and the government an-
 nounced that 70 of the 100 persons on a previous
 list already have left the country.
 The prisoner release program thus far has
 almost exclusively benefited "detainees"--those
 arrested under the state of siege but not charged
 with specific offenses or brought to trial. The
 government apparently plans to broaden the pro-
 gram to include at least 1,000 persons already
 convicted and sentenced. Arrangements for the
 commutation of jail sentences to expulsion may
 already be in the works and recipient countries
 are being sought. The government also is trying to
 speed  judicial  processes-mainly  in  military
 courts-against persons charged and awaiting trial.
 There are indications that pressure is build-
 ing within the government to rein in the free-
 wheeling Directorate of National Intelligence, a
 security arm subordinate only to the presidency.
 Some army generals are convinced that the di-
 rectorate's penchant for mistreating prisoners is
 impeding the overall effort to improve the govern-
 ment's record on human rights.
 Progress on prisoners and efforts to curb
 abusive practices notwithstanding, however, the
 government is far from complacent where internal
 security  is  concerned. Dragnet sweeps for
 common criminals and  leftist fugitives were
 undertaken in Santiago late last month after a
 half-year hiatus. President Pinochet has promised
 new interim security legislation this month. It will
 probably be designed to fill gaps in existing laws
 until the eventual promulgation of an omnibus
 legal code.

 BRAZIL: HITTING THE COMMUNISTS
 A  recent crackdown  on the Communist
 Party represents President Geisel's response to
 military hard liners who have been dissatisfied
 with what they perceive as his laxness in security
 matters. At the same time, Geisel may be using
 the opportunity to centralize his authority over
 internal security organizations and to warn those
 who take undue advantage of his modest liberal-
 ization efforts.
 Justice Minister Falcao, in a televised ad-
 dress, highlighted the recent capture of a number
 of members of the illegal Brazilian Communist
 Party and the seizure of printing presses used to
 produce the party's newspaper. Falcao urged all
 Brazilians to familiarize themselves with the de-
 tails of the government's action, which are being
 published.
 Although the  Moscow-oriented party has
 long been docile, the government at times moves
 to suppress it still further. By playing up its
 actions against the Communists, the government
 is going out of its way to praise the security
 forces. This, in turn, is meant to reassure hard
 liners that security interests are still receiving high
 priority. Several  leading military conservatives
 recently have expressed concern that security
 consciousness has been declining under Geisel.
 This, they feel, led to the opposition electoral
 gains  last  November  and  could  encourage
 extremists.
 The US embassy reports press speculation
 that the justice minister's prominent role in an-
 nouncing the arrests signals the government's in-
 tention to centralize the administration of secu-
 rity matters. Until now, such problems have been
 primarily the domain of the armed services. A
 desire to centralize control of the many security
 organizations would be consistent with Geisel's
 operating style in other areas. Moreover, such a
 move would enable Brasilia to correct abuses of
 operational  authority by regional commanders
 now operating with virtual autonomy.
 Finally, Falcao's statement that the recent
 raids turned up information proving the party's
 "participation" in the elections could be designed
 as a warning to any congressman-elect contem-
 plating some provocative or controversial action-
 particularly when congress convenes in March.
 The same claim might also be used at some future
 time to buttress the government's case should it
 opt to remove a politician deemed unacceptable.

 OIL: PAYING THE BILLS    c'~.
 /Among the major developed countries, only
 Italy had a substantial problem paying its in-
 creased oil bill in 1974. The status of sterling in
 the international monetary system and London's
 role as a financial center enabled the UK to
 finesse the problem. France, partly because of its
 ties with Arab states, was able to cover its deficit
 easily. Canada, West Germany, and Japan main-
 tained relatively strong current-account positions,
 despite the oil price hikes.
 Italy, which had payments difficulties before
 the  oil  price increase, encountered serious
 financing problems last year. It was able to bor-
 row only $2.5 billion from private financial
 markets, far short of enough to cover its $8-bil-
 lion current-account deficit. The balance was
 financed from official sources, including a $2-bil-
 lion, gold-secured loan from West Germany and a
 $1.9-billion credit from the EC. The IMF also
 loaned $1.7 billion, including $826 million from
 its oil credit facility.
 Japan was able to meet the $14-billion in-
 crease in its 1974 oil bill without serious dif-
 ficulty. Tokyo borrowed about $8 billion in the
 US and Europe to cover its deficit in the first half
 of the year. Later, slack domestic demand and
 favorable price trends for Japanese exports and
 non-oil imports permitted the non-oil trade bal-
 ance to be improved by nearly $13 billion. Tokyo
 also  discouraged  investment abroad, causing
 capital movement out of the country to fall
 sharply, and began to attract OPEC funds, both
 directly and in the form of deposits in Japanese
 banks abroad.
 France encountered little difficulty in meet-
 ing its $9-billion oil bill last year. The costs were
 partly offset by a $3.3-billion surplus in non-oil
 trade and services. Paris also relied heavily on
 Eurodollar borrowing and bilateral deals with
 OPEC to fund its current-account deficit of $5-7
 billion. Early in the year, the French treasury
 floated  a  $1.5-billion  loan that reportedly
 brought in $800 million from external sources,
 including OPEC states. Later, state agencies bor-
 rowed  nearly $2.5  billion in the Eurodollar
 market, and $300 million against future exports
 to I ran.
 West Germany and Canada experienced no
 major financing problems as a result of higher oil
 prices. Bonn's huge $34-billion surplus in non-oil
 trade more than covered its $10-billion oil bill
 and a $14-billion deficit in services. Bonn has, in
 fact, been preoccupied with preventing capital
 from entering the country, to reduce upward
 pressure on the mark. As a net oil exporter,
 Canada benefited from the rise in  prices. Its
 surplus in the oil trade helped keep the current-
 account deficit to less than $2 billion.
 Italy's position is tenuous. Utilization of for-
 eign credits already arranged, borrowing from the
 new IMF credit facility, and the culmination of
 one or more of the bilateral deals that are being
 discussed with OPEC members may prove suf-
 ficient to cover Italy's needs. None of the others
