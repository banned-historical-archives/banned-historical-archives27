 ;;.,RUSSIA'S , SCATHING ATTACK ' ON
 PERSONALITY CULT
 ,MOSCOW, OCT. 23
 The Soviet Communist Panty today
 directly accused the Chinese Communist,
 Party. leaders of trying.-to form a ,new
 world communist movement under their
 leadership. The latest attack in the bitter
 ideological dispute  between . Moscow
 and- Peking was Published in the Soviet
 Communist Party's leading theoretical
 journal Komnrunirt and quoted by the
 The Chinese were accused of trying
 to replace  Leninism with Mao Tse-
 tungism  and adhering to the person-
 ality-cult-7-the first time such a charge
 has been, made in' a 'responsible party
 journal.. .
 Western observers interpreted this charge
 as' an angry Soviet reply to- repeated per-
 sonal attacks on : Mr, Khrushchev, . which
 have been appearing in the Chinese-press.
 Fhe Konununist editorial article was also
 seen as a step towards outlawing the Chinese
 party from the world communist movement
 if Moscow considered the ,time ripe to do
 so.  Next month communist leaders will
 discuss calling a world communist confer-
 ence,' where such an expulsion could be
 made.
 The leading article `claimed that the
 Chinese had moved on from their "splitting
 activities " and had decided to create " some
 now movement tinder their aegis ". China
 was inspiring and supporting "various anti-
 party and factional groups ".
 " The people in Peking are obviously try-
 ing to knock together an international block
 out of such groups and groupings, most
 consisting of people who were expelled
 from communist.parties all sorts of un-
 princirxled  and corrupt elements ", the
 journal said. ,
 Kumnrnnist said that the Chinese leaders
 needed  to defend the personality cult
 because their internal policies were based'
 on its preservation: : However, 65 'of the
 world's 86 communist parties had expressed
 "dull solidarity" with, the Soviet position
 in the clash.
 IMMENSE DAMAGE"
 The article stated: " We are witnessing a
 campaign against tho very fundamentals of
 Marxism-Leninism such as has not occurred
 since the days of Trotskyism ". The Peking
 campaign  against  fraternal  communist
 parties had nothing in common in its
 approach with a discussion among like-
 minded people.
 Immense damage is being done to the
 cause of socialism and the entire revolu-
 tionary movement; and every communist,
 in whichever., country' he may live and
 under whatever conditions he is fighting for
 his ideals, is in duty, bound to, carry out
 his international duty- to do everything pos-
 sible to halt the development of events in
 the direction which Peking wishes them to
 take, '
 Tass said that the article exposed in detail'
 the special platform, created in Peking in
 the theoretical field, in the social-political
 life of the country, and in the field of foreign
 policy and relations with socialist countries ".
 and summed up the " faulty methods ".of
 the Chinese leaders.             .
 "To  achieve  their aims' the  Chinese.
 leaders, to judge by their actions, have de-
 cided.to demolish the international commu-
 nist movement and create some sort of a
 new movemcnt.under their own aegis.. As
 they see it the shortest way of doing this
 is to discredit the Soviet Communisst Parts."
 Koni nmiist accused Chinese leaders "of"
 resurrecting the ideology and . practice. of
 the personality cult.  This was necessary
 because their !internal policy was based on'
 the Preservation of a regime of personality
 cult.   Chinese  leaders  pronouncements
 against doing away with the Stalin per=?
 sonality cult were  a call for the support
 of the' deification of Mao Tse-tung , in
 which   Chinese ?  propaganda  'is  now
 strenuously engaged ", the article said.
 "The communist movementhhasmet with'
 an attempt to replace Leninism witch.' Mao
 Tse=tong-ism',  The attempt to substitute,
 the ideas of' Mao Tse-tung for Marxism-
 Lenninism has provoked a resolute protest
 from all communists.  Our banner has',
 been and will be Marxism-Leninism;  We'.'
 have fought and will fight for.the,purity"
 .of Marxist-Leninist ideas.
 "The 'people in, Peking do not believe
 in the forces of world socialism, in their
 ability to. influence world development in'
 the interests of the revolution." ?
 Chinese 'propaganda limited itself to'
 " proclaiming .with fanfares the weld-know n
 Marxism truisms about the need of a?'
 socialist revolution and dictatorship of the
 proletariat ", but diverted attention from the
 pressing  tasks  of ' implementing ' these ,
 immensely important principles. The theory,'
 of some sort of "special " common interest
 of the peoples of Asia, Africa; and Latin
 America invented by the Chinese propa-
 gandists . fully, contradicted  Marxism
 Leninism:            .  .    '
 TROTSKYIST CHARGE ? .
 t
 "Such an interpretation of Afro-Asian'
 solidarity serves not so much as an instru, ,
 ment of struggle against imperialism as an
 instrument for isolating the peoples of these
 continents from the socialist states."
 The article said that the political and
 ideological ideas of the Chinese theoreti-
 cians                                                in, many respects coincided  with
 those of the Trotskyists.   One example
 was the Chinese view "that as long as
 imperialism exists the possibility of avert-
 ing war is an ' illusion ' "   There was
 "often  almost.  verbatim . coincidence
 between the      pronouncements of  the
 Chinese theoreticians and those of the
 Trotskyists
 The Peking leaders were inspiring and
 supporting  various anti-party, factional
 groups in other countries.  "Thepeople in
 Peking are obviously trying to knock
 together an international block. out of such
 groups and groupings, mostly consisting of
 people who were expelled from communist
 parties, all sorts of unprincipled and cor-
 rupt elements,
 "When  petty-tyourgeoise, ' nationalistic'
 revolutionarism,  leftist  phrase-mongering
 and leftist opportunism are forced on' a
 big communist party, especially one in
 'power, they become no less a danger than'
 revisionism, not only for this Particular-
 party but
 '    for. the'entire communist, move-

 present but also of the future'consequences
 of his present-day activities. ' -

 right to split the communist movement, to
 undermine the friendship, of, the, peoples:.

 of'-Soviet views on Ideology and
 foreign policy in a speech here
 today.
 Chao  No-chiang, ' "fraternal
 delegate" to the convention of

 11. Belgrade, Oct. 19 (PTI)--
 Hit by poor' living conditions
 and persecution, ' a  large
 number of Albanians have
 been crossing the northern border
 of Albania  into its neighbouring
 "ideological foe," Yugoslavia.
 The  Yugoslav  official news
 agency, Tanjug, reporting the exo-
 dus, said Albanian refugees were
 crossing over mainly from Scutari.
 Pishkopea and Kuks regions, The
 agency did not indicate the num-
 ber of persons who had fled Alba-
 nia in the last few days, but said
 they included intellectuals, work-
 ers and peasants.
 Circles  close ' to the  Yugoslav
 Government attributed the exodus
 to the "repression let loose" by Mr
 Enver   Hoxha,  the  pro-Chinese
 Premier of Albania, on "Khrus-
 chevites"                                                                                                   following deepening  of

 However, it seemed as if every
 'precaution had been taken to

 Communist  China  had,  of
 course, refused to attend the'
 conference.  This Red Chinese
 decision also kept other Asian
 journalists' groups under Peip-

 SWISS REVIEW OF WORLD AFFAIRS    OCTOBER, 1163
 The Conflict in World Communism   By Ernst Kux
 "Whatever the consequences the Communist conflict may yet produce, the contrasts
 between the free world and the Communist world are still greater than those between
 Moscow and Peking ... Only by serving its own future, not by opening the doors to
 Moscow, will the free world be able to profit from the schism in the Communist camp."
 Thus the Neuc Ziircher 7,eitung specialist on Soviet theory and practice concludes this
 summary-survey of the current quarrel between Moscow and Peking.
 Not very long ago it was being said in Moscow and
 Peking that Soviet-Chinese friendship was as ever-
 lasting as the Volga or the Yangtse Kiang; family-
 proud Mao spoke of "the big and the little brother,"
 and Khrushchev based his predictions regarding the
 future superiority of the "Socialist camp" on,
 among other things, the Chinese population and
 economic potential.
 Today Moscow and Peking are locked in a battle
 waged with government declarations and party
 epistles, to the accompaniment of an increasingly
 violent propaganda fire. As during Stalin's quarrel
 with Trotsky or after Tito's defection, they are
 mutually accusing each other of  "betrayal of
 Marxism-Leninism," "Goebbel's propaganda of lies,"
 "racism," "pan-slavism"; Communist rivals are
 called "agents of imperialism," or accused of creat-
 ing antagonism between leaders and people. Dos-
 siers recording the past sins of the opponent are
 opened,  long-secret  treaties  or. long-smoldering
 border conflicts are uncovered, past statements by
 the respective leaders assembled into monstrous
 documents. The two big Communist powers indeed
 are on the verge of a final break; two camps are
 taking shape in the East Bloc, ' and the quake
 spreads in waves to the Communist parties and
 front organizations all over the world.
 Stalin's Heritage
 Although factors of national and power politics are
 becoming  increasingly  evident  in  the  quarrel,
 basically the Soviet-Chinese enmity remains a con-.
 flirt within Communism, and the theoretical and
 practical components remain intertwined. Within
 the totalitarian Communist system ideology is not
 merely a facade for national interests or the ambi-
 tions of individual leaders, but a factor of power
 in its own right. It is in fact the ideological
 character of the quarrel between Moscow and
 Peking that endows it with the irrationality and
 vehemence characteristic of religious wars.
 There was no need of the Chinese reference to
 the 2011, Soviet Party Congress and the advent of
 "de-Stalinization" to reveal that the differences
 began with the death of Stalin and that they must
 be seen in line with the revolutionary eruptions in
 Eastern Europe in 1953 and 1956. Moscow's author-
 ity as the moral and political center was first shaken
 by antra-Soviet power struggles for Stalin's inherit-
 ance, then moderated by the beginnings of the
 updating of ' Soviet rule. Khrushchev's attempt to
 transform Stalin's empire into a "Communist Com-
 monwealth" was countered by the Chinese demand
 for a right of co-determination and advocacy of
 "independence and equality of all Communist coun-
 tries and parties." Historical differences between
 Russia and China and the two countries' unequal
 development on the "way to Communism" increas-
 ingly conflicted with the uniformity of theory and
 practice that Communism demands. Mao was unable
 to keep up with Khrushchev's effort to modernize  11
 party rule and mobilize Soviet society, because
 that would have endangered his still unstable
 system and thus damaged Communism in China
 and in the world. Very soon the dispute as to
 whether the slowest or the fastest member of the
 Communi
 t cam
 ld d
 i
 i
 s
 p wou
 eterm
 ne
 ts pace evolved
 into a dispute for leadership in the East Bloc and
 in world Communism.
 In addition to these increasingly sharpening
 internal contradictions between Communist theory
 and practice, world-political developments added
 fuel to the quarrel. Western capitalism was develop-
 ing in a way quite different from what Marxist
 dogma had prescribed for it. Not crisis and decline
 followed upon the second World War, but an
 unprecedented upward surge, not bitter and bloody
 rivalry, but far-reaching cooperation and integration
 among the countries of the free world. Stalin on
 the other hand left behind him an isolated and
 deteriorating empire heavily burdened by the crisis
 over Berlin and the war in Korea.
 The Communists reacted variously to this no
 longer deniable contradiction between their dogma
 and worldwide reality, sharpened by technical and
 social developments that Marx and Lenin had not
 foreseen. Through tactical adaptation of dogma
 and with the aid of "peaceful coexistence" Khru-
 shchev seeks to lead his country out of its isolation,
 to join up with the Western development, to even-
 tually surpass it in `-`peaceful competition" and thus
 to acquire the power necessary to "bury capitalism."
 Mao on the other hand clings to the idea of a
 revolutionary transformation of reality and inter-
 prets events in Asia., Africa and Latin America as
 "storm signals of the world revolution."
 Khrushchev and Mao
 These contrasts in strategy and tactic of the
 struggle for the ultimate victory of Communism,
 which both Mao and Khrushchev desire, has within
 a few years led to the emergence of two centers and

 SRJISS REVIEW OF WORLD AFFAIRS
 two camps in world Communism. The result thus
 far however has not by any means been an erosion
 of Communist ideology or dissolution of the Com-
 munist camp, but rather a sharpening of their
 ideological weapons and instruments, an increasing
 competition in world-revolutionary radicalism, and
 a new alignment around the Moscow center on the
 one hand, and the Peking epicenter on the other.
 No Communist party can avoid this polarization
 even if, as in Rumania or North Vietnam, it wants
 to wangle as high a price as possible for joining one
 or the other camp.
 Thus far Khrushchev has not been any luckier
 with his China policy than was Stalin. On the
 occasion of his visit to Peking in October, 1954,
 he courted Mao's support in the internal Soviet
 struggle for power and in exchange gave him not
 only some Soviet control positions in China, but a
 right of co-determination in the Kremlin, a right of
 which Mao decidedly wanted to avail himself in the
 crisis of 1956. By generous gifts Khrushchev wanted
 to win Mao for his modernization of the East Bloc,
 and not until too late, perhaps, did he realize that
 he was merely creating an opponent for himself.
 Whereupon with draconic pressure he applied all
 those methods against China for which he had
 condemned Stalin's rule over Eastern Europe. By
 the non-fulfillment of the secret agreement on the
 equipment of the Chinese army with Soviet atomic
 weapons, by the sudden withdrawal of Soviet
 technicians in the summer of 1960 and by' the
 promotion of irredentism in Sinkiang-where China
 has vital deposits of oil ind*uranium-Khrushchev
 was able to disturb China's development, but not to
 impose his line on Mao. His "big-power chauvinism"
 merely earned him the hatred of the Chinese, who
 felt hurt both in their faith in "Communist frater-
 nity" and in their national pride. Khrushchev's
 attempt at the 22nd Party Congress to isolate China
 within world Communism failed. While his Cuban
 adventure ended in an embarrassing defeat for him,
 Mao conducted his successful thrust against India,
 evaluating it as confirmation of his conviction that
 Communist thrusts can be made without giving rise
 to an atomic war, and which- certain observers in'
 Asia already describe as a first indirect attack by
 China on the Soviet Union.
 Cold War Between , Moscow 'and Peking
 The consequences of the Cuban crisis put Khru=
 shchev in a precarious situation in which lie found
 himself exposed to the Chinese water torture of
 ideological attacks. At ]ionic, lie had to face growing
 economic. difficulties and, possibly some opposition
 within the party leadership, while his quarrel with
 Peking wrought havoc with the international Com.-
 munist  movement.  In  this situation Khrushchev
 however succeeded by the conclusion of the Moscow
 nuclear test-ban . m greement to initiate a successful
 counter-thrust by 'diich he hopes'to strengthen his
 position and to isolate China. Tacking the label of
 "atom warmonger" on the Chinese, he seeks to
 brush up his.own "peaceful coexistence."
 The Chinese did not hesitate to reply. They
 concentrated their fire on Khrushchev personally,
 describing him as "the ally.of American imperialists,
 Indian  reactionaries  and  treacherous  Titoists,"
 and, for Western consumption, as a fickle politician
 and unfaithful treaty partner. Peking and Moscow,
 which until now had 'been enemy brothers, have
 become engaged in a full-fledged cold war.
 Already Moscow describes the Chinese dogmati-
 cians as "the principal danger," and it looks as if
 the predictions according to which the Soviet Union
 would have to ally itself with the West against
 China were to come true sooner than expected. But
 the Soviet leaders should not for that reason be
 expected to abandon the red banner already. Rather
 they have made it clear that they want to exploit
 the split in the Communist camp to bring about a
 split in the Western camp. Also, Khrusliclicv seems
 to harbor the intention of maneuvering himself out
 of the tiring two-front position in which he finds
 himself between Peking and Washington by getting
 the United States involved in a controversy with
 China, to enable him to emerge from the tangle as
 the triumphant third. By emphasizing the idea of a
 non-aggression  pact  between  NATO  and  the
 Warsaw Treaty countries Khrushchev attempts to
 achieve the success and consolidation he urgently
 needs in Eastern Europe-and to thus preclude the
 possibility of Washington's and Peking's'pulling on
 the same rope, as they did in the case of Poland in
 the fall of 1956. Such a development would keep
 Moscow's back in Europe free against China and at
 the same time not exclude an involvement of the
 United States in Asia, for which conditions in India
 and Southeast Asia seem already set. '
 Although in the United States and in Britain the
 Communist quarrel is evaluated primarily as a
 conflict between two big powers-to which one
 ought to react according to the classical rules of
 power polities-Washington does not seen dis-
 inclined to let itself be drawn into Khrushchev's
 ideological campaign against China. While the
 Soviet-Chinese conflict begins to shift the world-
 political fronts, it does not make, them simpler or
 clearer. Just as suddenly as a split of the absolute
 Communist dogma into two enemy components, each
 with its particular national emphasis, has occurred,
 a return to the common ideological foundations and
 aims may take place. The bonmot according to which
 Khrushchev's successor upon 'his arrival at the
 Peking airport will once again hail the "eternal
 Soviet-Chinese friendship" and attribute all respon-
 sibility for the quarrel to "that agent of the Vatican,
 Nikita. Khrushchev," is not without some foundation
 in view of the reconciliation with Tito, the heretic
 of 1947. Actually the Chinese leaders, full of hatred
 as'they are for Khrushchev, have repeatedly let it
 be 'understood to Western observers that they do

 since Khru-   revolutionary assertions, a remarkably realistic
 appraisal of the world situation, as when Peking
 points out the superiority of the United States and
 the West as against the insecurity of Communist
 domination in Eastern Europe and Asia.
 While the duration of the currently deep Com-
 munist conflict remains uncertain, it would be
 rathdr dangerous for the Western powers to blindly
 adopt the Soviet assertions on Chinese "atom war-
 nmon Bering" and "racism" and at the same time to
 fail to recognize the real Chinese intentions and
 threats. It ought not to be forgotten that in 1956 it
 was Khrushchev who enabled the Chinese to play
 a political role in Eastern Europe, and in 1957
 promised to give them atomic weapons, while now
 he warns of the "yellow danger." On the Chinese
 side on the other ]land there exists, for all the
 IITAIDUSTAAI TTIES
 19 October 1963
 Whatever consequences the Communist conflict
 may yet produce, the contrasts between the free and
 the Communist world are still greater than those
 between Moscow and Peking. Nor can it be the task
 of the free world to let itself be burdened with
 Khrushchev's failures in Peking. The history of the
 Soviet-Chinese conflict moreover clearly shows that
 the growing strength and cooperation of the West
 are of decisive influence on the break between
 Moscow and Peking. Only by serving its own future,
 not by opening the doors to Moscow, will the free
 world be able to profit from the schism in the Com-
 munist camp:
 Peking's Isolation
 London:
 THE Chinese Communists, who
 have   become a  sort  of
 pariah among the nations after
 their split with Russia, are try-
 ing frantically to break out of
 their world isolation. But thus
 far their efforts have met with
 little success.
 When Mr Khruschev decided to
 get tough with Mao and to isolate
 Communist China from Russia, he
 was counting on the fact that the
 Peking regime has very few fri-
 ends in the non-Communist world.
 He presumably hoped that, when
 the Chinese' found themselves cut
 off from the rest of the world,
 both Communist and non-Commu-
 nist, they would be forced to come
 to their senses  and   reach  an
 understanding with Moscow.
 Well aware of Mr Khruschev's
 intentions, even in the years be-
 fore the break the Chinese have
 been trying hard to draw people,
 parties and   governments  away
 from the Kremlin's wing.  Their
 efforts have naturally been con-
 centrated in                              Asia,  Africa and
 Latin America-areas where Mos-
 cow's influence is not always so
 strong. But the only success they
 have had so far has been in the
 specifically Afro-Asian "front" or-
 ganizations, which have a special
 appeal to the "have-not" peoples
 with yellow or black skins. It is
 this which has given the Russians
 some ,,rcunds for  accusing  the
 Chinese Communists of  introduc-
 ing an element of "racism" into
 what  started  as a political and
 ideological dispute.
 -China's relations with the rest
 of the world on the conventional
 governmental level are not   im-
 pressive. Peking maintains diplo-
 matic relations with a number of
 governments in Western Europe,
 including   Britain.        But,   apart
 from  their  activities  in        Berne,

 Ally Twice Told
 At about the same hour the other day
 the Foreign Minister of France was ad.
 dressing the National Assembly and the
 chairman of the Foreign Relations
 Committee was addressing the United
 States Senate. They were concerned
 with the same subject, the relations
 between the United States and France,
 and although the two countries are
 allies the speeches did not sound much
 alike. Senator Fulbright does not speak
 for the American Government, al-
 though on this occasion he was
 undoubtedly giving expression to Ad-
 ministration thinking; M. Couve de
 Murville does not always speak for
 President de Gaulle-only de Gaulle
 does that-but his policy review must
 be taken as official.
 In essence, the Foreign Minister said
 that -France had embarked upon its
 own defense program, exclusive of
 NATO, because the other European
 members of NATO had been so sluggish
 in their own military precautions. They
 had tended to rely wholly on American
 power,, whereas France had made its
 own private atomic arrangements. By
 so doing; he said, France had "shown
 herself as having a national will, and
 as a ,result is a real ally."
 Viewing' the same developments an
 ocean away, Fulbright said that as an
 ally. France "has been deeply disap.
 pointing." De Gaulle, he.said, had been
 quick to offer agreement in principle
 while withholding cooperation in fact.
 France is on its way toward. wrecking
 the Atlantic alliance and may even
 drive the United States out of Europe,
 Fulbright? warned. The Western union,
 he said, depends upon political con-
 sultation, the proper disposal of mill.
 tary forces, economic cooperation and
 the lowering of trade barriers. The
 Senator saw de Gaulle blocking each
 of these goals.
 If Couve do Murville wishes to dis-
 cover the success of the policies he de-
 scribed to the National Assembly, he
 would do well to study Fulbright. He
 will not get it straighter than that from

 WASHINGTON POST
 31 OCT 1963
 France and America
 Senator Fulbright's forthright discussion in the
 Senate and Foreign Minister Couve de Murville's
 review of foreign policy in the French National
 Assembly this week have at least revived the
 trans-Atlantic dialogue on the future shape of the
 Western Alliance.
 It is to be hoped that the French will not be
 .so annoyed at the Senator's blunt reproaches and
 criticism of, French policy that they will fail to
 sense the sweep of his constructive suggestions
 and the degree to which he spoke for a broad
 sector of American opinion. He was, to be sure,
 extremely critical. ? "For too long," the Senator
 said, "the voice of France has been a voice of,
 negation and dissent within the Western com-
 munity."  He reproached France for an "excess
 of pride and assertiveness," for taking the posi-
 tion that America cannot be counted on to come
 to Europe's defense, for an attitude leading to
 disunity in the West. He warned that the United
 States will not abandon Europe but that it can
 be driven from Europe by isolationist trade and
 defense policies.
 Couve de Murville, on his part, asked for a
 reorganization of NATO with a new distribution
 of duties and responsibilities.  He defended the
 French insistence on a separate thermo-nuclear
 deterrent, on' the control of its own forces and
 conceded that France may be a difficult ally, al-
 though still a loyal and sure. one.
 These accusatory and defensive maneuvers com-.
 pleted, the debate should move on to the area
 where constructive phase's could commence.
 If France finds Fulbright's scolding unpalatable,
 it should be able to approve some of his affirma-
 tive proposals:
 The necessary complement of a greater Euro.
 pean contribution to the alliance is a.greater
 European voice in its vital decisions. Europe
 can and should be brought into the strategic
 planning processes which govern the use of
 America's nuclear arsenal.
 Failure to devise the structural' changes of
 NATO that would permit this no doubt is behind
 some of the trouble in the alliance.  It is not
 easy to move from the Senator's generalizations
 to concrete and particular command arrangements .
 to make them effective. Still, it needs to be said
 with more frequency and more emphasis that this
 country is ready and willing to. consider and
 debate proposals for giving these generalizations
 practical .effect.

 South Africa to
 '. develop
 guided missiles
 From our Correspondent
 Johannesburg,
 October 27
 South Africa is to establish
 a rocket'research institute near
 Pretoria, to develop a ground-to-'
 air missile.  Professor Louis le
 Roux,  vice-president of  the
 Council for Scientfic and Indus-
 trial Research, said today "the
 Republic has been forced by
 events in Africa to enter the.
 missile field." He also announced
 that the institute would be sup-
 plemented                                                                                     by a firing. range l
 somewhere in the Republic."
 According to the Government l
 press, the cost of the missile pro..,,
 gramme will eventually run into
 millions.  Key posts at the new
 institute have already been filled'
 by scientists, most of whom have
 been trained abroad.  Professor
 le Roux said defence research,,
 which    began  last  year, has
 already achieved some striking
 successes.
 Intensified search for natural
 oil and plans for further oil
 from coal projects are other
 moves for countering external
 pressures  and  threatened
 ;sanctions against South Africa.
 Senator Fulbright rightly said:
 If the Western Alliance is to remain strong
 and united, it must be built on more than bonds
 of friendship and high regard. It requires work-
 ing agreements for political consultations and
 the command and disposition of military forces,
 for economic cooperation and the lowering of
 'trade barriers.
 The trans-Atlantic debate on the future shape
 of the Western Alliance is given a curious un-
 reality by the close correspondence of the ex-
 pressed views of the two countries and the wide
 divergence of these views from what each believes
 is the other's secret view. In this country, it is
 widely believed that France is in the grip of an
 emotional nationalism that menaces the unity of
 Europe and the solidarity of the free world. In
 France, obviously, it is very widely believed 'that
 the United States is still essentially too isolationist
 and too nationalistic to share in any genuine way
 the command of the nuclear forces of the free:
 world.
 The remarks of Senator ' Fulbright and those
 of Couve de Murville have the virtue of bringing
 these aspects of our mutual distrust into the open
 where.something can be; done about them.

 (Sun Staff Correspondent]
 New York, Oct. 30-Moscow's
 delegation today called on the
 United Nations Assembly to back
 Soviet Premier Khrushchev's pro-
 posal that an eighteen - nation
 summit conference be convened
 in Moscow within the next eight
 months.
 The 111-nation Assembly "would
 not he doing its duty" if it did
 not appeal. for such a conference,
 Nikolai T. Fedcrenko, chief Soviet
 delegate, declared.
 A meeting of the heads of all
 the governments involved in the
 disarmament conference begun at
 Geneva nineteen months ago is
 required to "lift it to the level
 of its task" and "produce a radi-
 cal change in the negotiations,"
 Federenko told the Political and
 Security Committee.
 Successful Move
 Meanwhile, the United States
 and Soviet delegations joined in
 a successful 'move to arrest a
 drive by the Assembly's "non-
 aligned" majority to suspend un-
 derground atomic tests until an
 enforceable East-West agreement
 to ban them can be negotiated.
 The delegations got the eight
 "nonaligned" members of the Ge-
 neva Conference to join them in
 proposing a resolution that-de.
 void of any specific reference to
 underground tests - would have
 the Assembly simply call on the
 Geneva conferees to continue ne-
 gotiations for a comprehensive
 treaty.
 The eight nations are Brazil,
 Burma, Ethiopia, India, Mexico,
 Nigeria, Sweden and the United
 Arab R  -M;
 Left Scat Vacant
 As participants in the Geneva
 Conference, they would be. in-
 cluded in Khrushchev's summit
 parley along with Britain, Bul-
 g9ria,                             Canada,  Czechoslovakia,
 Italy, Poland, Romania, the, So-
 viet Union. the United States and
 France, although it has left its
 seat vacant since the currently
 recessed conference began in
 14larch, 1962.
 Andrei A. Gromyko, Soviet For-
 eign Minister, renewed Khrush-
 chev's summit proposal when he
 addressed  the  Assembly  last
 month, but did not ask that the
 world organization support it.
 Federenko prefaced his plea to
 the Assembly with a 40-minute
 speech, reviewing East-West dis-
 armament negotiations to date.
 proposal not only before it wasp
 introduced by Abdel Fattah Has-`
 san of the U.A.R. but also before
 at least two of its sponsors had
 been notified that a backstage
 agreement on its wording had'
 finally been reached.
 Meanwhile, as the Political and
 Security Committee put off a vote
 on that resolution until tomorrow
 afternoon, there were these addi-
 tional developments  at United
 Nations headquarters:
 Agreement Reached
 1. The Assembly's stage man-
 agers arranged for ratifying, in
 a plenary session Friday,  an
 agreement reached yesterday to
 end a contest between Czecho-
 slovakia and Malaysia for a two-
 year term on the Security. Coun.
 cil by awarding the seat . to
 Czechoslovakia for 1964 and to
 Malaysia for the following year.
 2. They also arranged for be-
 ginning Friday debate on a pro-I
 posal to tap all available United
 Nations funds to aid in the re-
 habilitation of hurricane-wracked
 Cuba, the Dominican Republic,
 Haiti, Jamaica and Trinidad-
 Tobago.
 Mindful of the fact that Wash-
 ington provides at least 40 per
 cent of the funds to be tapped,
 the United States' delegation was
 still trying as of tonight to get
 the pending resolution changed
 so that it would ? refer only to
 "the Caribbean area" instead of
 specific countries there.
 Report Prepared
 3. U Thant, the Secretary Gen-
 eral, prepared for publication to-
 morrow a progress report on the
 world organization's efforts, -at
 Afro-Asian and Soviet bloc behest,
 to strip Portugal of all its African
 possessions. It is expected to an-
 nounce suspension until Novem-
 ber 21 of.talks between African
 delegates and representatives of
 Portugal.
 4. Thant expressed his "gratifi-
 cation" that an Algerian-Moroc-
 can truce was reached today and
 his "hopes that this will lead to
 a final and peaceful settlement."
 He managed thereby to offset
 some of the embarrassment ear-
 lier today because - of a report
 on the situation in Yemen.
 The report to the Security Coun.
 cil concluded with an announce-
 ment that he must withdraw the
 United Nations force of 200 "mili-
 tary observers" and plans to sub-
 stitute for them "a civilian United
 Nations presence" in Yemen.

 He took stands diametrically op-
 posed to those Charles C. Stelle
 had  taken  yesterday  for  the
 United States.
 He avoided mention of Wash-
 ington's announcement last night
 that a group of accused Soviet
 spies had just been caught in the
 New York area, including three
 members of Moscow's United Na=
 tions delegation. And also neg-
 lected   Moscow's   ritualistic
 charge that disarmament inspec-
 tion  machinery urged by the
 United States would open the So-
 viet  Union  to  Western "es-
 pionage."
 Federenko repeated a charge
 made September 19 by Andrei
 Gromyko, Soviet Foreign Minis-
 ter, that the Geneva conferees
 have been getting nowhere due
 to "the unwillingness of the West-
 ern powers to accept real dis-
 armament."
 Most of his speech was devoted
 to that contention and building
 up to his ultimate claim that an
 eighteen-nation summit conference
 on "both disarmament and sep-
 arate measures to achieve the
 further alleviation of international
 tensions" is imperative.   '
 "Detrimental To Peace"
 He renewed Soviet proposals for
 turning various parts of the world
 into "denuclearized zones," which
 the American had warned, "would
 alter the balance of power in a
 way that would be detrimental
 to world peace."
 The Soviet Union insists on in-
 ternational control over "disarma-

 He also reasserted, after the
 resolution about atomic tests had
 been introduced this afternoon,
 Moscow's contention that "na-

 ficient to detect, verify and con-
 trol" any underground  atomic
 tests that might be staged in
 clandestine violation of a treaty
 banning them.
 Speaking in support of the test-
 ban resolution a few 'minutes
 earlier, Stelle stressed the United
 States insistence that "national

 Five minutes from destruction
 One year. ago this morning, the world
 seemed nearer than ever before to a nuclear
 disaster. As one of President Kennedy's advisers
 said afterwards, they felt in Washington that
 they could be "within five minutes of destruc-
 tion."               By mid-afternoon, Greenwich time, the
 crisis was almost over.  Mr Khrushchev had
 undertaken to dismantle his missile bases in
 Cuba and to let United Nations representatives
 verify the fact. On both Mr Kennedy and Mr
 Khrushchev the crisis must have left a deep
 mark. Neither will willingly venture so near the
 brink again. They had been brought to it by
 misjudgments on both sides-presumably, by
 advice to Mr Khrushchev that the Americans
 would not react so strongly to the placing of
 missile bases in Cuba, and by advice to Mr
 .Kennedy that the Russians would not be so
 foolish as to try putting offensive missiles there.'
 But the Russians tried it, and the Americans
 ,reacted.
 By October 28, eleven days after President
 Kennedy first 'heard what the Russians were
 doing and four days after the. blockade of Cuba
 had been imposed, a choice had to be made in
 Washington. Mr Khrushchev had been warned
 that, one way or other, the Russian missiles must
 be removed. No time limit had been stated, but
 f unless Mr Khrushchev gave way soon Mr Kennedy
 had to act-by,pinpoint bombing of the sites, by
 a parachute assault,, by a massive invasion of
 Cuba, or by a nuclear strike on the bases. Ameri-
 can forces, including a great invasion fleet off
 Florida, were ready for any of these courses.
 Throughout  the  world,  at  the  same  time,
 American and some allied forces were on a full
 alert-the first ever called, and so far the only
 one-while on the Russian side intercontinental
 missiles must also have been manned and ready
 for the countdown. But Mr Khrushchev saw ,the
 folly of persisting?and a settlement was quickly
 reached.
 It was a near thing. The most reassuring
 aspect was that both men, soon afterwards, made
 plain that they understood this. Out of the acute
 tension over Cuba, and assisted by the Russian
 breach with China, came the improved relations
 of the past year. The agreement on a "hot
 line " linking the White House and the Kremlin
 was one immediate physical result, and that line
 is now in operation.  Mr Kennedy and Mr
 Khrushchev both knew and acknowledged that
 disaster was averted in October, 1962, only
 because they maintained, constant diplomatic
 contact-and because U Thant, on behalf of the
 United Nations, found a formula for giving both
 time to think at the beginning of the blockade.
 The agreement on a test-ban treaty wasanother.
 ,benefit that followed the  crisis.,  President
 Kennedy felt bitterly that he had been personally' -"
 deceived by Mr Khrushchev, both over the
 nuclear tests moratorium in 1961 and over the
 missiles in Cuba. The test-ban treaty this. year
 was part of Mr Khrushchev's attempt tb.make
 amends-and within twos weeks of the Cuban
 settlement last year "Pravda" and " Izvestia "
 were showing plainly that he wanted to use it in
 this way.
 The lessons of the crisis are . many. Inter-
 nationally, we need to go on looking for..agree-
 ments.  We need. also to remain armed--and
 ready to use force when confronted,,- though
 always the least force that will, be. effective.
 Russia was and is an expansionist Power:  Mr
 Khrushchev has learned the risk of expansion ;
 his successors may not recognise it. Agreements,
 however, can help to .reduce the dangers"
 -agreements that, at the next stage,.. should
 move towards nuclear-free zones; towards a
 .thinning out of troops in forward areas, and
 towards eventually removing all nuclear weapons
 from foreign soil. There is also the, need to
 stop the spread of nuclear weapons tq,further
 nations. If the threat to the world was great
 when only three . nations possessed -.nuclear
 striking forces, it will be far greater when ten
 or twelve nations do so ; and it is lamentable
 that, in the past. year, no practical steps. 'have
 been taken, apart from the test-ban, treaty:
 Within the alliance, the chief lesson. is that
 Governments ought to consult each other and that
 decisions ought to be shared. In the last resort,
 in a fast-moving situation, one man has to decide ;
 and nobody now is likely to challenge the skill
 and sanity of Mr Kennedy in his action'. But
 the fact remains that senators frpm California
 and Arizona were flown back to Washington for
 urgent and secret consultations ; London and
 Paris were no farther away, but senior Ministers
 were not invited to take part in the. White'
 House discussions. For decisions to be shared,
 and for the European members of the. Atlantic
 Alliance to have full confidence in what is being
 done, ' a stronger system for planning and con-
 sultation is essential. Mr Dean Rusk yesterday
 pointed once again to the failing of NATO
 members to meet their commitments in- forces
 and to the uncertainty on " who speaks , for
 Europe."  These are fair criticisms, and they
 were made at the time of the Cuban crisis. But
 the United States, too, in spite of the generous
 way it has shouldered a disproportionate burden
 within the alliance, could still show itself.to be
 more of a partner in taking, decisions.

 iN SO VI1 SPY CASE
 Russians Must Leave U.S.
 Within 2 Days-2.Others
 Are Held Without Bail
 Three members of the Soviet
 mission to the United Nations
 were ordered yesterday to leave
 the United States within 48
 hours.
 The expulsion order, Issued by
 the State Department, followed
 `accusations that the three were
 participants in an espionage
 'ring that was said to have re-
 kceived data on a worldwide
 communications  and  control
 system being developed for the
 Strategic Air Commands
 A New Jersey engineer who
 was accused of passing the de-
 fense secrets to the Soviet diplo-
 mats and a Russian chauffeur,
 who lacks diplomatic immunity,
 were being held without bail in
 the Hudson County Jail at Jer-
 sey City.
 U. N.'Agreement Cited
 The Soviet mission called the
 ouster a "deliberate provoca-,
 tion" against those who sought
 .to better relations between the
 two countries.
 The State Department's note
 said the three diplomats had
 flagrantly abused their privilege
 of residence in this country and
 were subject to expulsion under
 an agreement between the Unit-
 ed  States  and  the  United
 Nations.
 The Federal Bureau of Inves-
 tigation moved against the ring
 on Tuesday night after seven
 months of surveillance.
 Four of the men were seized'
 at a clandestine meeting at the
 Erie-Lackawanna Railroad sta-
 tion in Englewood, N. J., dur-
 ing which classified information
 was said to have changed hands.
 The four were the engineer,
 John W. Butenko, 38 years old,
 of Orange, N. J.; ,Glob A. Pav-
 lov, 39, an aVtT  he; Yuri A.
 Romashin, 38, third secretary of
 the mission, and Igor A. Ivanov,
 33, described as a chauffeur at
 the New York office of Amtorg,
 the Soviet state trading com-
 pany.
 The  third  Soviet  diplomat
 whose ouster was ordered, Vla-
 dimir I. Olenev, was said to
 have been present at earlier
 meetings of the group. He was
 not taken into custody.
 Had Top-Secret Clearance
 Mr. Butenko,?, a husky six-
 footer with black hair, had been
 employed since 1960 by the In-
 ternational  Electric  Corpora-
 tion of Paramus, N. .J., a sub-
 sidiary  of  the International
 Telephone and Telegraph Com-
 pany. The F.B.I. said he had a
 top-secret security clearance
 and was in charge of maintain-
 ing a master schedule for the
 Air Force project.
 Because the F.B.I. was aware
 of the spy plot and said it had
 shadowed Mr. Butenko at four
 previous meetings with the Rus-
 sians, it was assumed that the
 material  that  came  into  his
 possession had been altered to
 preserve defense secrets. How-
 ever, the Federal agency would
 not comment on this.
 Nor would the F.B.I. suggest
 a motive for Mr. Butenko's as-
 serted spying.
 Both his parents were born
 in Russia. His mother died in
 1957. Mr. Butenko, a bachelor,
 lived with his father, a semi-
 invalid  in  his  eighties,  in  a
 modest three-room apartment in
 a turreted private house at 366
 Park Avenue.
 Neighbors there described him
 as a quiet, friendly man, but
 withdrawn,   and   apparently
 without major extravagances or
 expensive hobbies. His salary
 was $14,700 a year.
 He was born in New Bruns-
 wick, N. J., and -:served in the
 Navy for 11 months before re-
 ceiving a medical discharge in
 1944. He was graduated. from
 Rutgers University with hon-
 ors in 1945.
 Before joining the Interna-
 tional Electric Corporation, he
 worked for the Radio Corpora-
 tion of America in Harrison,
 N. J., the Armed Services Elec-
 trostandards Agency at Fort'
 Monmouth, N. J., and the Civil
 Aeronautics     Administration,
 now  the  Federal      Aviation
 Agency, in Jamaica, Queens.   }
 Constant Surveillance
 Mr. Butenko and Mr. Ivanov
 were being held In maximum
 security cells at the Hudson
 County Jail, under constant 'ob-
 'servation. Both men were de-
 scribed as completely calm.
 Both pleaded not guilty at
 their arraignment, early yester-
 day and were held in $100,000
 'bail each. But during the after-'
 noon David M. Satz Jr., United
 States Attorney  in Newark,
 moved successfully to have bail
 revoked on the ground that both
 men might flee the country.
 Face Death Penalty
 Mr. Satz also pointed out that
 'the offense carried the death
 penalty. The wording of the
 charge against the two is "de-
 livering to a foreign govern-
 ment information relating to
 the national ? defense of the
 United States."
 Mr. Satz said he hoped to
 present the case to the grand
 jury within two weeks.
 In relating the events that
 led up to the arrests Tuesday
 night, the F.B.I. said Mr. Bu-
 tenko had carried a briefcase
 to the meeting at the railroad
 station, as he had previously.
 When  the  Federal  agents
 stepped from   the shadows
 around the station, deserted af t-
 ler the evening rush hour, they
 found it in the automobile in
 which Mr. Pavlov and Mr. Ivanov
 were sitting. The car was said
 to be fitted with a miniature
 document camera powered by
 the cigarette lighter. Mr. Rom-
 ashin, who was said to, have
 acted as a lookout, was seized
 near by.
 All four were taken to the
 Hudson County jail, which is
 used for the confinement of Fed-
 eral prisoners in northern New
 Jersey, until Mr. Pavlov and Mr.
 Ivanov established their diplo-
 matic immunity to arrest.
 The F.B.I. reported that it
 had observed earlier meetings
 that followed much the same
 pattern in Closter,  N. J.,  on
 April 21 and May 26, and near
 Paramus  on  Mar  27        and
 Sept. 24.
 The arrests marked still an-
 other episode In a year in which
 an unusually large number of
 espionage incidents has been
 made public around the world.
 A table compiled by The As-
 sociated Press lists 19 major
 cases.

 Economic Decisions Linked
 To Control By Khrus4chev
 By LRNE'ST B. FURGURSOY
 [Moscow Bureau of The Suit]
 ! Moscow, Oct. 30 - Soviet' eco-
 ~nomic decisions to quit the moon
 ,race, buy Western grain and ex-
 pand chemical output are all
 major political decisions demon.
 strating  how  firmly  Premier
 Khrushchev is now in control.
 There is little doubt among ob-
 servers here that Khrushchev's
 stated unwillingness to compete
 with the United States in sending
 men to the moon-if it is to be
 taken at face value- is primarily
 motivated by lack of funds rather
 than advance concern for the
 ,safety of those men.
 Enormous Cash Outlays
 There is even less doubt that
 the Russians would slow down
 their prestige-winning space pro-
 grain if it were not for the
 enormous cash outlays demanded
 by the other two decisions, which
 have been given foremost short
 and long-range economic priority.
 Khrushchev, although he has
 based his recent career on the
 promise of more and better things
 for Soviet consumers, probably
 would not-or even could not-
 ;have forced through those deci-
 sions as recently as seven months
 ago.
 Although they differ as to the
 genuine significance of the coin-1
 cidence, close followers of Krem-
 lin policy note that a shift in the
 Premier's public attitude imme-
 diately followed the sudden seri-
 ous illness of Frol R. Kozlov, the
 party secretary who long was
 Khrushchev's heir apparent.
 Speculate On Backdown
 Last February, there was grow-
 ing speculation that Khrushchev
 was in trouble in the wake of'
 his Cuban backdown. In the view
 of outside experts as well as some
 Communist party members, the
 hard-line opposition to him was
 led by Kozlov.
 On February 27, Khrushchev
 told a Kremlin "election" meet-
 ing that arms spending would con-
 tinue to take priority over meet-
 ing the people's daily needs.
 "We would like to build more
 enterprises putting out things for
 the satisfaction of man's require-
 ments.... To  give  more  good
 things to the people is the main
 aim of the Communist party....
 On the other hand, life demands
 the spending of huge sums on
 keeping our military might at the
 required level. This fact dimin-
 ishes, and cannot but diminish,
 the people's chances of obtaining
 direct benefits," Khrushchev said.
 tinov, longtime arms production
 chief, was named head of the new
 Supreme Economic Council and
 joined Anastas I. Mikoyan and
 Alexei N. Kosygin as a First
 Deputy Premier below Khrush-
 chev.
 Another month later,  Kozlov
 made the last appearance before
 his illness. He has not been seen
 in public since.
 Another Public Speech
 And exactly two weeks after
 that, Khrushchev, in another pub-
 lic speech, hinted at a turn in
 official thinking.
 He denied that Ustinov's ap-
 pointment meant the Soviet Union
 would "produce only rockets" and
 said one of his duties would be to
 oversee efficiency in the secret
 defense industry.
 "The defense industry is coping
 successfully with its task to cre-
 ate and produce modern arms,
 but it could be solved more suc-
 cessfully with less spending," the
 Premier declared to industrial
 and construction workers at the
 Kremlin.
 Again on July 19 Khrushchev
 told ? a Soviet-Hungarian friend-
 ship, rally that the expansion of
 chemistry would bring "increased
 production of beautiful high-qual-
 ity consumer goods." 1
 Dramatic Announcement
 Last week's broad-ranging 'in-
 terview with Communist and left-
 wing journalists,  including the
 dramatic announcement that the
 Soviet Union would not race
 America to the moon, seemed to
 set Russia firmly on the changed
 course.
 Parallel to this ' shift in eco-
 nomic emphasis-and it is a shift
 in emphasis, rather than a drastic
 about-face-still more spectacular
 political events were taking place.
 The signing of the atomic test-
 ban treaty and the relaxation of
 the crackdown on intellectual ex-
 pression were moves in the same
 direction as the new drive for
 consumer satisfaction.
 And it was a direction Kozlov
 would not have liked.
 There is no public proof that
 Khrushchev was bound by a cabal
 Iled by Kozlov when he made his
 "guns-before-butter"  speech  in
 February, or that Kozlov's dis-
 appearance from. active politics
 freed Khrushchev to turn the
 other way. Events inside the
 party presidium are as secret as'
 those inside Soviet rocket bases.
 ,But the difficult decision tot
 spend  Soviet  gold on  wheat!
 abroad, even though Khrushchev;
 said that with rationing the peo-;
 pie would have had enough to-eat '
 in , this disastrous farm year,'
 could not have been made by a
 Premier in the same political sit-
 uation as the Khrushchev who:
 made last February's speech.    f
 To cut back the rate of steel-
 production production increase, . and report-,
 edly oil-output growth as well, in
 order to fund plastics, fertilizers
 and artificial fibers, also is not
 .the., sort of decision a "guns-be-
 fore-butter" leader would make.
 Exactly how extensive the sac-
 rifice of more traditional produc-
 tion to boost chemical output will
 be'should be concluded at a party
 Central Committee plenum sched-
 uled for next month.
 :The fast-moving economic and
 .political developments of the past
 summer and fall, along with the
 projection of domestic and interT,
 national policies to ;follow them
 tip, also will be docketed at the
 plenum.
 Personnel Problems
 A decision on whether to retain
 Kozlov on the party presidium or
 remove him because of his last-
 ing illness may' be made, Other
 personnel problems . exist at the
 top party level.
 Mikoyan is reported sick, as is
 Mikhail A. Suslov, theoretician
 and presidium member; Otto V.
 Kuusinen and Nikolai M. Shver-
 nik,  presidium  members,  are
 aging into inactivity.
 'The political future of Ustinov,
 the former arms industry boss
 who by background would have
 been one of the main opponents
 of the recent economic shifts, may
 be determined. Soon after he be-
 came First Deputy Premier, there
 was a hint in Pravda that h
 would be moving into the top
 party hierarchy, perhaps as Koz-
 lov's replacement.
 But since then he has been in-
 conspicuous, while Kosygin, long
 known as a light industry advo-
 cate, has become more and more
 prominent on public occasions.
 Because of these pending deci-,
 sions, and because a stiff breeze'
 of change is blowing through the
 Kremlin, next month's party meet-
 ing will be a plenum to watch.'

 Soviet Cuts
 Purchases
 From West.
 By Preston' Grover
 MOSCOW, Oct. 30 `(AP)--
 Western businessmen in Mos-
 cow report a sharp reduction
 in Soviet orders for commer.
 cial products and industrial
 machinery.
 There is always a lull in the
 weeks before the annual So-
 viet budget comes out in late
 November or December, for
 the budget gives purchasing
 agencies a line on how much
 they can spend. But the lull is
 more marked than usual this
 year.  .
 Some representatives here
 have been told frankly that
 there is a shortage of funds
 clue to the nearly $1 billion
 that  has  been  s p e n t  for
 foreign wheat to make up for
 a poor Russian harvest.
 "The hold-down is about 50
 per cent due to the budget
 and about half due to the
 need to buy wheat" a West-
 ern diplomat said today.
 Fertilizer Machinery Sought
 One exception is machinery
 to make chemical fertilizers.
 A demand persists for that,
 though there is pressure for
 long-term  credit.  Increased
 use of fertilizers is one point
 in  Premier      Khrushchev's
 program to boost agricultural'
 production.                  {
 British, Italian, Japanese and
 West  German  firms       are;
 among those feeling the pres-
 sure. All are chary of men-
 tioning figures.
 Italian suppliers have been
 told that much of their deal-
 ings must be switched over to
 fertilizer  equipment.  Orders.'

 Money Reserve Unknown
 Just  how  much  spending,
 money the Soviet Union has
 is always a carefully guardedi
 secret. Gold production  re-
 putedIy  runs  from     $200
 million to $300 million a year.
 That amount of gold has
 been sold annually on the Eu.
 ropean markets  for several
 years to make up the chronic
 deficit between whab Russia
 sold in the West and what it
 bought.
 , Some diplomats were taken,
 recently on a tour of the Far
 Eastern Siberian gold mines..
 They said production is being
 stepped up. The mining is dif-
 ficult  and  expensive  since
 many of the deposits are in
 areas where the ground is per.
 manently frozen.
 Costs of mining  gold in
 some places are estimated at
 about twice the world price of
 gold, but of course such costs
 are paid for in rubles, not in
 foreign exchange..-          '

 Mr K. puts agriculture
 before heavy industry .
 By VICTOR ZORZA
 Mr Khrushchev has proposed that the industrial
 'development of the Soviet Union should be slowed down
 to make resources available to cure agriculture of its
 perennial crisis, but his views do not appear to command
 ,the full support of his associates in the leadership.

 more by a doctrinaire "class'" . In foreign policy, the ma-
 approach.
 Time and again, since. the
 Socialist  Party  was  first
 formed in 1892, its refusal
 to share in the government
 with the "bourgeois" forces
 was responsible for "lost op-
 portunities"                  to  strengthen
 democratic institutions and
 promote the interests of the
 Italian  workers-as    Nenni
 himself acknowledged in his
 opening speech to the Con-
 . gross last Friday.
 Stand Helped Fascists
 That     continued   refusal
 played a major role in pav-
 ing the way for the Fascist
 dictatorship in 1922.
 After the downfall of fasc-
 ism,  the        Socialists partici-
 pated   in  the           governments
 formed during  the last
 months of World War II and
 its  aftermath.  But  those
 were  emergency  coalitions,
 and had the support of all
 the anti-Fascist parties, in-
 cluding the Communists.               .
 In the early post-war years,
 Socialists joined in a close
 alliance  with  the   Commu-
 nists to oppose the demo-
 cratic and pro-Western coali-
 tion governments that ruled
 Italy after 1947. This in turn
 gave  Italy's   conservative
 forces a  controlling influ-
 ence within those coalitions.
 The consequent failure 'to
 adequately modernize Italy's
 ain and pursue an outward
 looking course in economic
 and commercial affairs. They
 now accept Italy's member-
 ship in NATO and the con-
 sequent obligations.
 But the Socialists show a
 marked  distaste  for  the
 whole idea of a multilateral
 nuclear force for NATO.
 In domestic policy, the ma-
 jority of the Socialists agree
 that the Communists must
 be excluded from the pro-
 jected  center-left  govern-
 ment's majority. They have
 taken further steps to loos-
 en their ties with the Com-

 ITALIAN CABINET
 EXPECTED TO QUIT
 Complex Negotiations for
 By ARNALDO CORTESI
 Special to The New York Times
 Rome, Oct. 30-Premier Gio-
 vanni  Leone  and  his  stop-
 gap Government are expected to
 resign next week, perhaps on
 Tuesday. The formation of a
 new cabinet is expected to be
 difficult.
 It is almost certain that the
 dominant Christian Democrats
 will first ask their party secre-
 tary,  Aldo Moro,  to form  a
 new government. He is expect-
 ed to try to bring into being a
 center-left coalition that would
 include Pietro Nenni's left-wing
 Socialists.
 The 35th congress of the So-
 cialist  party  authorized  Mr.
 Nenni yesterday to open nego-
 tiations   with  the . Christian
 Democrats with a view to part-
 nership in forthcoming govern-
 ments. Socialist participation,
 however, was made dependent
 on a number of conditions that
 the Christian Democrats may
 not accept.
 munists in the local admin
 istration. But they still hesi-
 tate to go all the way in
 that direction.
 Press for Reforms
 At  the  same  time,  the
 Socialists are pressing for
 speedy implementation of
 broad economic and social
 reforms which, while more
 typical of a modern democ-
 racy                                  than  of  a  Socialist
 society, are opposed, not only
 by the conservative groups.
 but also by many moderate
 forces within the Christian-.
 Democratic camp itself.
 Another question mark is
 represented by..the attitude,
 His Votes Needed
 Mr. Nenni will be in a strong
 position to negotiate with the
 Christian Democrats. The 260
 Christian Democrats, 33 Demo-
 cratic Socialists and six Repub-
 licans don't have a majority in
 the chamber, which has 630
 seats. They are in'absolute need
 of the 87 left-wing Socialist
 votes.
 On the other hand, Mr. Nen-
 ni's position will be weak be-
 cause his majority in the Cen-
 tral Committee of his party is
 not firm. Riccardo Lombardi
 controls some of the seats that
 Mr. Nenni includes in his ma-
 jority 'and it was Mr. Lombardi
 who last June rebelled against
 a Nenni plan to give parlia.
 mentary support to a govern-
 ment Mr. Moro was seeking to
 form.
 It will therefore be Mr. Lom-
 bardi who will be dictating the
 conditions for a left-wing So-
 cialist entry into a government.
 The negotiations to ' form a
 government  will  take  place
 while the country is in a diffi-
 cult situation.
 Charges to Nenni
 Mr. Nenni is committed not
 to permit a policy of deflation.
 The  Socialist  Congress  also
 charged him     to  organize a
 planned economy and to intro-
 duce major reforms in the or-
 ganization of the Italian state.
 The Christian Democrats will
 certainly find some of these
 positions extremely unpalatable.
 Despite the difficulties, the
 negotiations are generally con-
 ceded to have a 50-50 chance.
 Either they will succeed or
 Parliament will probably be dis-
 solved  and  general  elections
 held. Deputies of all parties are
 strongly opposed to this ide

 The  Shah  considers  him  a
 martyr to reform.
 For  their  part,  the land-
 lords are far from reconciled.
 Charges abound that the Shah
 is a traitor to his class, ex-
 ploiting the peasants for poli-
 tical expediency - that he is
 promising the peasants more
 than he can deliver and will
 suffer disaster when they be-
 come disillusioned. The land-
 lords are supported by some
 Teheran  bankers  when  they
 complain that the Government
 will not - indeed cannot -
 keep its promise to pay the
 landlords for so much land..
 This, they say, is just one
 tragic consequence of having
 rushed into land reform, pell-
 mell, without careful planning.

 come.over him. The lines of his
 face cut deeper grooves than
 they  used to.  His  thin  lips
 move tautly, his gaze sharpens
 and his voice becomes more
 authoritative as he discusses
 his plans.
 It is perhaps only natural
 that the landlords should pro-
 mayed by the Shah's "almost        "My job is to prepare my
 complete  reliance"  on  the .     country for democracy," he
 army and on his secret police,
 the Savak,. for information.
 Too often, it is feared, the
 generals isolate the Shah from
 unpleasant facts and close his
 ears to constructive criticism.
 During the past crucial year,
 for example, the execution of
 the reform program has been.,
 in the hands of the mild Pre-
 mier Asadollah Alam. He was
 chosen for the job largely be-
 cause he is a completely un-
 questioning supporter of the
 Shah,  a  friend  since their
 school days together.
 Some     critics  declare  the
 Shah's only interest in reform
 is his hope of perpetuating
 the monarchy for his new, son
 and heir. Certainly the Shah's ?
 new approach has been more
 evident  since  the birth  of
 Crown Prince Riza three years
 ago this Thursday. But any
 king naturally hopes to per-
 petuate the kingdom.
 Skepticism is  frequently
 voiced by educated Iranians in
 places  of  responsibility in
 government  and  the  pro-
 fessions, partly perhaps be-
 cause one Iranian is always
 reluctant  to trust another.
 They  fear  the  Shah  has
 plunged blindly into an ad-
 venture of political fortune.
 Not a few doubt he intends to
 fight to the finish; they pre-
 dict he will relapse once he
 has reaped the rewards of
 showing himself "a hero to the
 peasants."
 "This land-reform stunt was
 ill-conceived and not planned
 at all. It will not work," said
 a Teheran businessman bit-
 terly.
 test they have not been paid
 fair prices for the land taken
 from  them,  but  the  Shah
 pooh-poohs their, cries of an-
 guish. "What do, they expect?"
 he asks. "The Government is
 paying them what they them-
 selves let  the land be as-A
 sessed at for years, when they
 paid their taxes. They never
 complained before that assess-
 ments were too low."
 Landlords - and bankers -
 are not the only opponents of
 the  Shah's  program.  "Black
 reactionary" is an epithet he
 uses with increasing frequency
 these days, and it is directed
 most vehemently against the
 Shiite  mullahs,  the ultracon-
 servative Moslem leaders, who ?
 not only oppose land redistri-
 bution but say that the emanci-
 pation of women defies Islamic
 law. It is generally agreed that
 the mullahs provoked a demon-
 stration last June in Meshed,
 Iran's most holy city, in which
 a policeman was killed.
 THE Shah makes much of
 that incident,  but he is not
 inclined to discuss the rioting
 that broke out a day or two
 later in Teheran's old bazaar
 -the hotbed of conservative
 merchants and usurious money
 lenders. On this occasion, in-
 fantry and tank-corps men,
 under  orders,  fired  point-
 blank into a mass of demon-
 strators. The estimate of 100
 killed. and   wounded  is con-
 sidered                   conservative by wit-
 nesses.
 The army's show of strength
 -  coupled  with  the  jailing
 of several of the Shah's more
 outspoken critics - effectively
 decided    the course  of  the
 campaigning . for this  fall's
 Majlis (National     Assembly)
 election.  The Shah's    hand-
 picked slate won almost in its
 entirety.  The  consensus   in
 Teheran is that   the voting
 was more on the up-and-up
 than usual-a reform in itself.
 But that the election was far
 from "free" by Western stand-
 ards was all too evident.
 The size of the army is a
 frequent source of criticism.
 With United States aid, the
 Shah has built it up to 200.-

 THE Shah turned 44 yes-
 terday and may be said
 to be near the midpoint of his
 life and career. He began his
 reign in 1941, a bright, hand-

 ing. Doing away with stuffy '
 formality, he walks around his
 .desk to greet visitors with 'a
 smile and a handshake as they
 enter his office. To an Amer-
 ican,                                               he  speaks  vernacular

 is not the time.
 "I suppose in time we might'
 have a monarchy such as they
 now have in Britain or Sweden
 -when a king might play a
 different role [i.e., reign not
 rule]. But our people are not
 ready for that. Our people
 need the King. Without the
 King, Iran would have been
 gone long ago.
 "Some Western correspond-,
 ents who come here do not re-

 discipline we, cannot have a

 He speaks passionately of
 land reform: "It will be com-
 pleted because the people de-
 mand it. We have started it.
 We cannot turn back. The peo-
 ple will not let anyone, even
 those who give lip service to .
 reform, stop it."
 IS journeys around the
 country  have obviously  con-
 vinced him this is so. Every-
 where, peasants have greeted
 him with wild acclaim, and
 such popularity is a heady
 brew. The sour opposition of
 landlords  and  mullahs  and
 Teheran    skeptics has  not
 spoiled his enjoyment of his
 new friendship with the mass
 of his countrymen.
 It can be argued that the
 only way to accomplish land
 reform is to plunge into it as
 the Shah has done. I; would
 take years to prepare Iran
 completely for this desperately
 necessary change, and  then .
 it might well be too late. The
 Shah has many supporters who
 believe that action - abrupt,
 sometimes   mistaken, often
 fumbling,  but action - to
 right  the  injustices  of its
 ancient system of landholding
 is Iran's greatest need.
 THROUGH it all, the Shah,
 if he really wants to win his
 "election" as leader in fact as
 well as in name, must build
 new  confidence  among  his
 people in new ways of life.
 For "black reactionaries" have
 not been the only enemies of
 reform and change. The tradi-
 tional Persian cynicism and
 apathy have been a paralytic
 'disease for centuries. To get
 Iran moving, the Shah will
 need to ride a white charger
 of 'mythical  endurance  and
 speed.

 Special to The New York Times
 BAMAKO,  Mali,  Oct.  30-
 Morocco and Algeria agreed to-,
 night to a cease-fire in their
 border hostilities. It is takeef-
 feet at midnight Friday.
 President Ahmed Ben Bella
 of Algeria 'and Bing Hassan II
 of Morocco signed a delicately
 drawn 'compromise. The fight-
 ing has cost both sides several
 hundred casualties in an area
 300 miles southwest of Colomb-
 Bechar. The first incident in-the
 dispute was Oct. 8.
 As Emperor Haile Selassie of
 Ethiopia, the prime architect
 of the compromise, looked on,
 the  Algerian  and  Moroccan
 leaders signed the accord, and?
 then' shook hands and parted.
 Hassan smiled briefly while .. Mr.
 Ben Bella remained impassive.
 Terms of Accord Listed
 Mr. Ben Bella was clad- in
 the same rumpled olive-drab
 uniform that he wore on his
 arrival yesterday. King Hassan
 wore a business suit. The sign-
 ing took place in the Presiden-
 tial Palace of Modibo Keita,, the
 chief of state of Mali.
 The agreement was reached
 after considerable pressure had
 been put on the negotiators by
 the Ethiopians and Malians.
 The accord calls for these de-
 velopments:
 qThe cease-fire.
 gThe establishment of a com-
 mission of Malian, Ethiopian,
 Algerian and Moroccan repre
 sentatives to set up a neutral,
 demilitarized zone in the border ,
 area from which both sides
 would withdraw.
 9Supervision of this zone by_;
 Ethiopian and Malian officers.
 arbitration   committee.   This
 committee would seek to deter-
 mine which side was at fault for'
 the outbreak of hostilities and
 would inquire into conflicting:
 border claims and submit its
 conclusions to. both sides.
 In addition, both Morocco ;and
 Algeria agreed to cease all
 propaganda attacks by press or
 radio after Friday and each side;
 reaffirmed a policy of "nonin-
 terference" in the affairs of the
 other.
 Each side gained and lost "cer
 tain points. King Hassan gained
 ap agreement by Algeria to the ,
 principle that the frontier prob-;
 lem and the Moroccan demands
 for Tindouf and Colomb Bdchar
 should be negotiated.
 The Algerians won Moroccan
 agreement to the conference of?.
 the African Unity Organization..
 which Morocco had opposed:
 The neutral zone under the..
 accord gave the Algerians as-
 surance surance that their condition for
 a cease-fire-the withdrawal of
 Moroccan troops-would be met
 even if it meant withdrawal of
 Algerian troops as well.
 However, Western observers
 warned that such pacts'in the
 Arab world, as elsewhere, had
 collapsed    quickly    before.
 Neither side seemed overjoyed
 by the agreement. When      the
 signing ceremony ended there
 was a burst of applause from
 Mali officials.
 The Presidential Palace, an
 imposing structure on a hill,
 overlooking  the  Niger  River,
 was protected by United States
 trained paratroopers    wearing
 green berets and armed with
 submachine guns made in Israel.
 The entrance to the. palace is
 flanked by two enormous stat-
 ues of crocodiles.
 The three visiting chiefs of
 state were lodged in the palace
 after their arrival last night.
 Emperor Haile Selassie was
 given a suite between those of
 Mr. Ben Bella and King Hassan.
 The Algerian and Moroccan
 leaders met separately yester-
 day with the Ethiopian Emper-
 or and their Malian hosts. The
 members of the Algerian and
 Moroccan delegations carefully
 refrained from mixing.
 The Algerians were clad in
 baggy ? olive-drab uniforms in a
 show of their country's mobili-
 zation against what they term
 Moroccan "aggression."
