 Syria-Israel
 MAKING ASAD HAPPY IN MOSCOW
 The Soviets rolled out the red carpet for
 Syrian President Asad and opened the Kremlin's
 coffers a little wider in a less than subtle attempt
 to cement bilateral relations at a time when Mos-
 cow is having trouble elsewhere in the Arab
 world.
 Asad's five-day' Stay in the USSR coincided
 with the arrival in Washington of the Syrian del-
 egation to discuss disengagement and with strong
 anti-Soviet remarks by Egyptian President Sadat.
 With this backdrop, the Soviets had more reason
 than ever to use the visit to reiterate that Moscow
 President Asad and Soviet leaders at airport
 must be a party to any negotiations leading to a
 viable Middle East settlement.
 Moscow also went out of its way, apparently
 with some success, to keep Asad from following
 Sadat's path away from the USSR and toward the
 US. The final communique expressed the resolve
 of both sides to "rebuff" any attempts to damage
 Soviet-Syrian friendship. This was probably a
 muted warning to the US, but more importantly
 it implied that Syria will not follow Egypt's ex-
 ample of improving relations with the US at the
 USSR's expense.
 The Soviets were somewhat less reticent
 than before in publicly criticizing US-Egyptian

 bilateral negotiations.  Brezhnev  referred  to
 "ersatz-plans," concocted by "the aggressor and
 its patrons," to substitute partial agreements for
 an over-all settlement. He again stressed that the
 Geneva conference, where Moscow has a voice, is
 the authoritative international forum where a
 settlement must be worked out.
 The USSR has repeatedly failed to persuade
 Asad to by-pass or at least de-emphasize the
 Washington bilateral  negotiations in favor of
 Geneva, and it seems to have had no better luck
 this time. Asad's comment that "our points of
 view on the main questions coincide" suggests
 that there were areas of disagreement, probably
 including the disengagement talks. The final com-
 munique fails to mention Geneva arid merely
 repeats the language used in the one issued fol-
 lowing Gromyko's trip to Damascus last month-
 that disengagement is a partial step that must be
 tied to an over-all settlement, and that Moscow's
 participation in all the stages and spheres of a
 settlement is important.
 Asad, who probably viewed the visit as
 necessary to assuage Soviet ensitivities over being
 excluded from the disengagement talks, was very
 generous throunhout in his praise of Soviet sup-
 port for Syria. He characterized the Moscow talks
 in general as having consolidated ties of friendship
 and cooperation, but he was very bland and non-
 committal  concerning Soviet warnings against
 dealing with "imperialist and reactionary" forces.
 In light of Moscow's recent set-back in its
 relations with Cairo, Asad may have sensed an
 opportunity to obtain generous aid commitments
 from the Soviets. Details are not yet available on
 the economic, scientific, and cultural agreements
 that Asad signed in Moscow, but it seems likely
 that they are indeed favorable to the Syrians.
 The communique did not mention any
 agreement on military aid, but did say that the
 two sides had "outlined steps" for the further
 strengthening of the Syrian armed forces. It seems
 likely that the Soviets will be generous in this area
 as well. The communique reiterated an earlier
 formula that Syria has the right to use all "effec-
 Page 2
 tive means" for the liberation of its occupied
 lands, but it did not use the Golan fighting as an
 occasion for sabre rattling.
 Syrian hopes for an early disengagement
 agreement seem to have been dampened by the
 Israeli cabinet crisis. The Syrian Foreign Ministry
 reportedly believes the crisis will delay, if not
 prevent altogether, the conclusion of an accord.
 Strong suspicions have been aroused in Damascus
 that the Israelis are, in fact, deliberately trying to
 put off and possibly sabotage negotiations. Presi-
 dent Asad, hcwever, is likely to await the out-
 come of Secretary Kissinger's current efforts to
 bring  about  an  agreement  before deciding
 whether to increase or relax military tensions on
 the Golan Heights.

 Several high-level Syrian Foreign Ministry of-
 ficials are said to believe that if Tel Aviv had
 really wanted to conclude a disengagement
 accord, it would have delayed publication of the
 Agranat report and thereby avoided a domestic
 crisis at this time. These officials are said to fear
 that, if Israeli leaders are unable to put together a
 new government quickly, th' disengagement talks
 will be postponed until after elections are held,
 ,probably next fall. In that case, they fear, US
 pressure on Tel Aviv to sign an accord will have
 lessened because of congressional elections in the
 US.
 Despite this somber assessment, the Syrian
 Government reportedly does not want to touch
 off a full-scale war. Syrian leaders are said to have
 ordered the recent intensification of the fighting
 around Mount Hermon primarily to keep up the
 pressure on Tel Aviv to sign a disengagement
 accord and for "internal purposes."
 Over the weekend of April 13-14, Israeli and
 Syrian forces fought their sharpest battles since
 the war last October.
 The
 level of fighting generally decreased early this
 week, but on April 17 and 18 Israeli aircraft again

 marked for the central and southern portions of
 South Vietnam are sufficient to replace losses and
 to maintain most Communist forces for several
 months at the low level of fighting that has
 characterized  the  post-cease-fire period. Only
 2,000 troops have gone to northern South Viet-
 nam, where there                                                                  has been little fighting, but
 Hanoi could quickly augment its forces in this
 area. The remainder, more than 22,000 men, were
 sent to reinforce combat and logistic units along
 the infiltration corridor.
 After two days of heavy fighting in the
 central highlands, the Communists on April 16
 forced government Rangers to withdraw from a
 fire support base about 25 miles southwest of
 Pleiku City. The South Vietnamese have moved

 the border areas of Binh Duong, Hau Nghia, and
 Tay Ninh provinces. A recent shifting of North
 Vietnamese main force elements in Military Re-
 gion 3 has put the Communists in position to
 protect major infiltration corridors leading to Sai-
 gon and the delta. Some senior government offi-
 cials also see the pressure as an attempt to isolate
 Tay Ninh Province.
 To counter the Communists, the government
 has reinforced its units northwest of Saigon, and
 the outlook is for more shay  fi htin  in this
 sector.
 In  Military Region 3 the governmert's
 Ranger base at Tonle Cham on the border of Tay
 Ninh and Binh Long provinces finally fell to the
 Communists late last week after being under siege
 for over a year. The base was the last government
 outpost within a major infiltration route north-
 west of Saigon. The impact of its loss has been
 primarily political, however, as the South Viet-
 namese announced on April 16 that they were
 indefinitely suspending the Paris talks with the
 Viet Cong. They cited the fall of Tonle Cham,
 continuing Communist pressure against other gov-
 ernment positions northwest of Saigon, and new
 attacks in the central highlands as reasons for the
 suspension.
 As a military retaliation for the fall of Tonle
 Cham, the government directed air strikes against
 the Communist administration center at Logy Ninh
 in southern .South Vietnam and against other
 nearby targets. Meanwhile, almost all troops of
 the base's former garrison have managed to with-
 draw safely to An Loc. The ease with which the
 Rangers withdrew supports speculation that the
 base commander, in apparent violation of orders,
 abandoned the base in return for a Communist
 guarantee of safe passage.
 Communist pressure in the area northwest of
 Saigon is aimed at strengthening their p',sition i;i

 LAOS: THE PA CHET LAO HOLD FORTH
 The Lao Communists, wasting little time in
 establishing their political and military priorities,
 have struck a note of reasonableness within the
 new coalition structure. During the inaugural
 meeting of the new cabinet, Deputy Prime Minis-
 ter and Foreign Minister Phoumi Vongvichit-the
 senior Pathet Lao official in the cabinet-empha-
 sized that there must be strict coordination be-
 tween the cabinet, the advisory political council,
 and the Joint Commission to Implement the
 Agreement. Phoumi also noted that the Joint
 Commission should set up the modalities for the
 withdrawal of foreign troops, the dissolution of
 "special forces," and the return of refugees. At
 the same time, he agreed that the Joint Commis-
 sion should investigate cease-fire violations similar
 to those that occurred in central Laos on April 7
 and 8 when Communist forces captured several
 Lao Army positions. On the question of foreign
 relations, Phoumi stated that the new government
 must  define principles governing Lao foreign
 policy and foreign aid to Laos.
 Phoumi also dwelled on the Pathet Lao's
 interests in a frank and highly cordial meeting
 with the US ambassador, who assessed Phoumi as
 an individual willing to discuss serious matters in
 a non-polemical manner. Besides indicating that
 the Communists want to maintain good relations
 with the US, Phoumi tried    play down appre-
 hensions of a Pathet Lao take-over in Laos by
 stressing that the two sides should work calmly
 and amicabl*' toward reconciling their opposing
 political viewpoints. Phoumi also stated again that
 it was essential for all foreign soldiers to leave
 Laos, and he hinted that the Pathet Lao may
 request aid for refugee resettlement.
 Other Lao Communist members of the new
 coalition government have also been working hard
 to project an image of cooperation and cordiality.
 Minister of Economy and Plans Soth Pethrasy, for
 example, has told his subordinates that he has no
 plans to make any personnel changes soon be-
 cause this would "frighten" the ministry's direc?
 tors and rightist elements in Vientiane. In addi-
 tion, Soth admitted that he has much to learn
 about his new -esponsibilities and that he there-
 fore would depend on his secretary of state from
 the Vientiane side to organize the ministry. Soth
 evidently has some clear ideas about the minis-
 try's orientation, however. He complained that
 Laos is too dependent or Thai rice and petroleum
 products and noted that he would like to see
 more imports from socialist countries.
 The Lao Communist officials' relatively dis-
 arming performance may help to dispel some of
 the gloom that has settled over various non-
 Communist elements upset by the presence of
 large numbers of well-armed Pathet Lao security
 forces on the streets of Vientiane and Luang
 Prabang. Sume Lac Army officers and rightist
 politicians have been concerned over the Com-
 munists' high-profile and have complained that
 Prime Minister Souvanna has "sold out" to the
 Pathet Lao.

 CAMBODIA
 Some Unwelcome Fireworks
 The Khmer Communists dampened Buddhist
 New Year celebrations in Phnom Penh this week
 with their first sustained rocket attacks in over a
 month. Fifteen rockets fell on the capital be-
 tween April 13 and 15-most of them near the
 presidential residence-killing and wounding over
 30 civilians. At the same time, a flurry of Com-
 munist ground attacks forced government troops
 to abandon outposts along Route 5 some ten
 miles north of the city and along the Bassac River
 just below Phrom Penh Skirmishing continued in
 both areas late in the week as Cambodian Army
 units tried to retake the lost positions.
 In the countryside, the Communists are still
 block ding Kampot's outlet to the sea and are
 shelling the southwestern coastal city sporad-
 ically. Ground prr.,sure has slackened, however,
 and government reinforcements are having little
 trouble working their way overland from the
 coast. The Communists have kept Kampot under
 siege for over a mcnth, and they may soon begin
 to experience shortages of ammunition and other
 supplies. Moreove-, many insurgent units pres-
 ently at Kampot jaw action on other fronts ear-

 Some Welcome Attention
 Prince Sihanouk, who recently has been tak-
 'ng a bark seat to his touring "defense minister,"
 Khieu Samphan, began his annual visit to Pyong-
 yang late last week. In his major address in North
 Korea,  Sihanouk acknowledged  Samphan's
 growing political prominence by describing him as
 the "authentic representative of our people."
 Although Sihanouk was pessimistic about the
 prospects for a Khmer Commurist military vic-
 tory this dry season, he again ruled out any nego-
 tiations with the Lon Nol government or with any
 third force. He did not mention the possibility of
 direct talks with Washington-a theme he revived
 last month during his visit to Laos.          25X1

 CHINA: RESTORING THvS OLD
 The rehabilitation of veteran civilians who
 were ousted during the Cultural Revolution has
 long been a sensitive political issue in China. The
 struggle between those who favor bringing back
 former leaders and those who oppose the idea has
 been complicated by the related question of re-
 placing military men in top party and government
 posts with civilians. It appears to be easier for
 feuding central leaders to agree on removing sol-
 diers than on whc should rep%ce them, bi:t the
 recent appointment of a new provincial leader
 demonstrates that progress is being made.
 On April 15, e Peking broadcast describing
 the c7ening of the Spring Canton Trade Fair
 identified Chao Tzu-yang as the new party and
 government leader in Kwangtung Province. Chao
 headed the Kwangturg party committee prior to
 the Cultural Revolution, but was ousted after
 attacks by lefti3t Red Guards in 1967.
 His tortuous return to power has been typi-
 cal of others who have been rehabilitated. Chao's
 initial post - Cultural Revolution provincial ap-
 pointment was in Inner Mongolia. He then reap-
 peared in Kwangtung in April 1972, but was not
 named a secretary until January 1973. When the
 late-December rotation of military region com-
 manders vacated the top Kwangtung party and
 government posts, there were several candidates
 for the positions, including politburo member
 Hsu Shih-yu, the new Canton Military Region
 commander. Chao was elevated over two other
 Kwangtung secretaries who outranked him.
 Chao is the first appointee to a top provin-
 cial party post previously held by one of the
 rotated regional comrr:anders. The displacement
 of provincial military men has inc.eased markedly
 in the last few months, and many sol(+.i ;rs are now
 targets of critical wall posters. It seems clear that
 civilians will fill most of the slots vacated by
 military men.
 lution, was restored to the Politburo. Teng's ele-
 vation apparently took place in the face of sl.rong
 opposition, as did his return to public view in
 April 1973. Several other high-ranking cadres who
 were purged or demoted during the Cultural Rev-
 olution have also returned to official favor, but
 reports suggest that others who were candidates
 for rehabilitation, such as former Central South
 Bureau leader Tao Chu, have been successfully
 blocked.
 The rehabilitation question is clearly part of
 the anti-Lin, anti-Confucius campaign, and the
 issue appears to have been addressed by both
 sides. Depending on the context in which they are
 presented, media articles criticizing Confucius for
 wishing to "restore t,-~e old" can be read as thinly
 veiled attacks on either: pre - Cultural Rev-'?  on
 civilian officials, such as Teng or Cnao, any ?.ose
 who wish to rehabilitate them; or those who wish
 to bring back people brought down in the later
 stages of the Cultural Revolution, most of whom
 were leftists. The trend in favor of the rehabili-
 tated veterans is a favorable sign for Premier
 Chou, who has led the eff         g there back.

 Taipei last week underscored its tough stand
 on the impending China-Japan civil air agreement
 and put muscle into its threat to close Taiwan's
 airspace to Japanese planes by putting the Na-
 tionalist Air Force on alert.
 A few days before the alert, Foreign Minister
 Shen publicly repeated Taiwan's demand that the
 present civil air agreement between Taipei and
 Tokyo be maintained. He warned that Taiwan
 would give up air links to Japan and refuse per-
 mission for Japanese aircraft to enter the Taipei
 Flight Information Region and Air Defense Zone
 if the Japanese unilaterally altered the existing
 agreement ;n order to secure a civil air pact with
 Peking.
 Premier Chiang Ching-kuo is hoping that by
 cooperating on the air issue with the right-wing
 Seirankai group of Japan's ruling Liberal Demo-
 cratic Party, he can help damage politically Prime
 Minister Tanaka and Foreign Minister Ohira.
 Chiang long ago wrote off both men as too pro-
 Peking and would prefer a more conservative cabi-
 net in Tokyo. Chiang's estimate of the situation
 within the party clearly overstates the strength of
 Seirankai as well as his own influence on events in
 Tokyo.
 A by-prc uct of Chiang's course of action
 has been an increase in anti-Japanesr feeling on
 Taiwan. This atmosphere, which stems from the
 Nationalists' sense of grievance against Japan- se
 "perfidy," makes eventual comprorrise more
 difficult.
 The Nationalist Air Force has been in-
 structed to he prepared to intercept intruding
 Japanese aircraft, but the high command is aware
 of the potential of a Taiwan-created air incident.
 Orders for an interception would have to come
 from the highest level of the government. The
 Nationalists apparently are assuming that the
 Japanese wilt not attempt to enter Taiwan's iir-
 space once Taipei ae.nounces it is closed,
 not completely closed the door to negotiation,
 nor has he specified the exact conditions that
 would trigger a rupture in air service. The points
 at issue in retaining air links with Japan have been
 reduced to two: the presence of Nationalist air-
 line personnel in Japan and the conditions for
 maintaining necessary ground and business serv-
 ices                                                                  there for Taiwan's airline; and .Japanese
 handling of the name of Taiwan's airline. On the
 face of it, both points would appear open to
 discussion.
 In the present turbulent atmosphere, how-
 ever, Taipei may lose sight of the Iona-run neces-
 sity of maintaining good political and economic
 relations with Japan. It might precipitate a rup-
 ture that will embitter Nationalist-Japanese rela-
 tions in general, and make future working ar-
 rangements more difficult.
 Prime Minister Tanaka, for his part, is com-
 mitted to an air agreement with Peking and is
 unlikely to change course as a result of Taipei's
 tough stand. It is now planned to sign the agree-
 ment un April 20. Tanaka will then promptly
 submit it to the Dict for early ratification, which
 seems assured.
 Taipei's new tactics have nade it harder for
 Tanaka to se,ore rapid approval of an agreement
 in the councils of his own party and in the cabi-
 net. While there is good evidence that key fac-
 tional leaders, notably Finance Minister Fukuda,
 have decided against using the issue in an overt
 challenge to Tanaka's leadership, the Seirankai
 hopes to use the issue to force Ohira's resignation.
 The antagonistic Nationalist attitude will,
 nonetheless, encourage the ruling party's more
 ext ?eme ri_'ht-wing and pro-Taiwan elements to
 make sharp attacks on Tanaka and Foreign Minis-
 ter Ohira, who has staked his personal prestige on
 achieving the agreement with Peking. If the right
 wing makes a case that Ohira has failed diplomat-
 ically by his inability to preserve air link, with
 Taiwan, he may be compelled to assume the
 Despite his adamant public stand, which has
 aroused misgivings among his advisers, Chiang has
 blame and resign.

 YUGOSLAVIA: FINISHING TOUCHES
 Tito's program to re-establish the Commu-
 nist Party as the country's most powerful unify-
 ing force will take a giant step toward completion
 at the tenth party congress next month. The
 party's authority to make national policy and to
 exercise closer institutional control over the rank-
 and-file will be sharply increased.
 The last touches are now being applied to
 the report that will guide party policy fo; the
 next four years, and proposed changes in the
 party statutes are also under final scrutiny. Much
 of this was probably accomplished last week
 when party secretary Stane Dolanc, who is chair-
 man of the congress' preparatory commission,
 and Edvard Kardelj, the country's top ideologist,
 held sever-! days of discussions with Tito. Kardelj
 subsequently indicated that substantial changes in
 the central party machinery are in the works.
 One of the key changes would abolish the
 largely advisory Permanent Conference and re-
 establish a fuii-fledged central committee-which
 was dissolved in 1969-as the main repository of
 party authority between congresses. In the ab-
 sence of a central committee, Tito has sometimes
 found the presidium, the party's top policy-
 making body, to be insufficiently responsive to
 changing poiicy needs. Re-establishment of the
 central  committee, which will probably have
 around   165 members selected from regional
 parties and the military, appears mainly intended
 to bolster the party's control, stability, and con-
 fidence.
 There also is a proposal to enlarge the nine-
 man executive bureau, which has strongly sup-
 ported Tito's plans to recentralize the party. With
 increased staffi:ig, the bureau will be in an even
 better position to oversee and direct the activities
 of the party rank-and-file. In addition, the new
 party statutes enhance prospects for increased
 party controi by abandoning the efforts, initiated
 in 1969, to create autonomous parties in Yugo-
 slavia's  constituent  republics.  Regional  party
 congresses-now almost over-have already re-
 organized local party units to dovetail more
 closely with the functional subdivisions of the
 central party apparatus.
 The party remains very tight-lipped on the
 subject of personnel "rotation," which normally
 accompanies congresses. The key question centers
 on Stane Dolanc, the current head of the party's
 executive bureau, who by statute cannot succeed
 himself. This theoretical obstacle can easily be
 circumvented, of course, but the way this prob-
 lem is worked out could provide valuable clues to
 Tito's wishes r,:garding the still-unsettled question
 of party succession.
 Tito's reassertion of party dominance and
 Sc 'iet-Yugoslav rapprochement have,  in fact,
 helped to strengthen his pet*ntial successors
 against . oth foreign and domestic pressures. Un-
 derlying Tito's effc,is is also a strong national
 rededication to Yugoslavia's unique form of so-
 cialisin and independent foreign policy. This in
 itself speaks against any major shifts in the coun-

 USSR: SAKHAROV'S REJOINDER
 Academician Andrey Sakharov, in a retort
 on April 3 to exiled novelist Aleksandr Solzhenit-
 syn, moved away from total confrontation with
 the regime. He now supports Soviet detente
 policy while still dissenting on  the lack of
 democratization of the Soviet Union. His new
 position provides a badly needed focal point for
 reformist forces in Soviet society and finds partial
 common ground with the "modernizers" in the
 regime itself.
 The full text of Sakharov's statement, issued
 in response to Solzhenitsyn's September "letter
 to the Soviet leaders," is not yet available in
 Washington. Excerpts, however, show it to be an
 elaboration of the dialogue developinq in dissi-
 dent ranks, which differentiates the  inward-
 looking  orthodox  nationalists   (Solzhenitsyn)
 from the outward-looking modernists (Sakharov,
 Roy Medvedev, et al). This dialogue reflects the
 divergence in Soviet society between the West-
 ward-looking modernizers at one end of the spec-
 trum, and the conservative, isolationist national-
 ists at the other end.
 These two strains of thought can also be
 found in the different attitudes of Soviet leaders
 and in the contradictions of Soviet policy. Thus,
 the regime is encouraging Western-style modern-
 ization through detente, while trying to maintain
 all barriers against democratization. Sakharov
 adopted a very dangerous strategy last year when
 he divorced himself from all aspects of the re-
 gime's policy by arguing against trade with the
 West unless  it  was accompanied  by democ-
 ratization.  Now,                   in supporting detente-albeit
 ultimately  for  reasons  of  democ-
 ratization-Sakharov moves back closer to official
 opinion, z rid his words gain added weight.
 Sakharov has provided a strong and balanced
 counter-argument to Solzhenitsyn's views on the
 future development of Soviet-and, for Solzhenit-
 syn, principally Russian-society. While Solzhenit-
 syn disdains scientific progress and favors a simple
 authoritarian society based on Russian national-
 ism and the Russian Orthodox Church, Sakharov
 rejects mysticism and overemphasis on id?ology.
 He argues in practical terms for :he harnessing of
 science to serve arid better the lot of mankind and
 Sakliarov
 for the expansion of contacts between the Soviet
 Union and the West.
 SakharGv sees no absolute good in Russian
 traditional values, in contrast to Solzhenitsyn's
 mystical belief in them, and argues that Soviet
 democratic activists should be equally concerned
 about the suppression of non-Russian peoples in
 the Soviet Union. He takes Solzhenitsyn to task
 for his view that an authoritarian system based on
 the benevolent patriarchy of the church would be
 most suitable and healthy for the country. Sakh-
 arov states his belief that only in a democratic
 system can national and human character be fully
 developed. He sees no insurmountable barriers to
 the  possibilities  for  democratic  c avelopment,
 either in  Russian  history or in the Russian
 character.
 Sakharov is particularly hard on Solzhenit-
 syn for arguing that Russia needs to pull away
 from the evil influence of the West and to develop
 itself in "splendid and simple" isolation. He rea-
 sons that the world's problems are so immense
 that one nation cannot solve them alone. He
 mentions a variety of issues, ranging from disarrna-
 ment to environmental protection, in which in-
 ternational cooperation is essential.
 Sakharov makes a strong case, in this re-
 spect, for expanded trade, scientific and cultural
 exchanges, free travel into and outside the coun-
 try, and the free movement of people and ideas
 across national boundaries. He relates this to the
 development of a more democratic system in the
 Soviet Union, and brings in his theory of conver-
 c,ence ti argue that both voluntary measures and
 outside pressures can act as catalysts for henAfi-

 NIGERIA: SLOW MOTION
 With only two years still to go before the
 target date it set in 1970 for returning Nigeria to
 civilian rule, General Gowon's military govern-
 ment has made little  headway  in laying the
 groundwork for a transfer of power. The key to
 more rapid progress is the availability in the near
 future of census figures, and Gowon's handling of
 this politically sensitive matter wily shed light on
 how serious the military is about returning to the
 barracks.
 The preliminary results of the census that
 was completed last December have not yet been
 released, although in January Gowon promised
 the figures would be ready by the end of March.
 If the delay is due mainly to tardy processing, the
 results probably will be released shortly. If, how-
 ever, the figures are in fact available but, as some
 suspect, are regarded by key lez;uvrs as unaccept-
 able because they are disadvantageous to one or
 another of Nigeria's three major ethnic groups,
 the delay will continue until a consensus solu-
 tion-such  as  a time-consuming recount-is
 thrashed out. Controversy over the results of the
 1963 census heightened ethnic tensions and was a
 major factor in the political breakdown that pro-
 duced two military coups in 1966 and a civil war
 a year later.
 The census is one part of a nine-point pro-
 gram of political and economic changes that
 Gowon outlined four years ago for the military' to
 accomplish by 1976. So far, Gowon has moved
 forward on only two other points: launching a
 development plan, and reorganizing the military.
 Some of the remaining six tasks can be glossed
 over, but three of them-writing a constitution,
 establishing national political parties, and holding
 elections-must be completed before power can
 be transferred. Final census figures are essential to
 proceeding with these critical items. Meanwhile,
 public debate over the shape of future political
 institutions is growing.
 It is apparent that Gowon and his colleagues
 have not yet decided on what actions they will
 take to fulfill their program. The military has
 generally insisted that it intends to step aside for
 civilians, and some spokesmen have stressed the
 need to honor the target date. Others, however,
 President Gowon
 seem to hedge by emphasizing the importance of
 first putting the nine points fully into effect. For
 his part, Gowon appears to be striving to get a
 major military re-equipment program-including
 purchases from both Communist and Western
 sources-well under way in advance of 1976.
 The regime may soon give closer attention to
 the matter of restoring civilian rule. Gowon re-
 portedly )ians to hold monthly meetings, starting
 in late April, with key senior officers to discuss
 outstanding political questions and to float pro-
 posals before the civilian Federal Executive Coun-
 cil, which performs some cabinet functions.
 Many Nigerians suspect Gowon will not
 complete his program by 1976 and will use this as
 an excuse for delaying a full return to civilian
 rule. They speculate that Gowon may mark the
 occasion by putting on civilian garb as head of an
 interim government of soldiers and civilians,
 thereby stretching out the process of transferring

 Lieutenant Colonel Kountche, Niger's armed
 forces commander and leader of the coup on
 April 15 that ousted President Harnani Diori, has
 formed a new government composed entirely of
 army officers. Kountche, who heads a 12-man
 Provisional Supreme Military Council, has stated
 that he is not considering changing Niger's close
 relations with France.
 Kountche's decision to move against L iori,
 who had led the country since it became inde-
 pendent in 1960. was probably motivated in large
 part by dissatisfaction with the government's in-
 ability to overcome impoverished Niger's chronic
 economic stagnation. The country's plight has
 been compounded in recent years by the serious
 drought that has spread throughout mulch of
 western Africa. The new regime, however, does
 not appear at this time to be any more capable of
 coming to grips with Niger's serious economic
 problems than was Diori's government.

 role.
 There is no sign of any internal opposition
 to the new regime. A number of student groups,
 which had long been critical of Diori's leadership,
 have staged marches to demonstrate their support
 for the military leaders.
 Some of Niger's neighbors in west Africa
 may be slow to accept the new regime. Nigeria's
 General Gowon and Ivory Coast President Hou-
 phouet-Boigny both had close ties with the de-
 posed leader.
 Widespread unrest continues among the mili-
 tary and other groups despite the government's
 promise of far-reaching social, economic, and po-
 litical reforms. So far, there is no concerted effort
 to force out the Endalkatchew cabinet, but the
 unrest is straining government administration.
 In a policy statement issued on April 8, the
 government addressed many of the demands of
 dissident groups, particularly the crucial issues of
 land reform and corruption. The government pro-
 poses to prohibit any one person from holding
 more land than he can reasonably be expected to
 develop and  to abolish public land grants to
 people who do not work on the land. New laws
 are promised to regulate,  on an equitable basis,"
 the relationship between tenants and landlords.
 These proposals, if carried out, will disrupt
 Ethiopia's traditional land-tenure system and ulti-
 mately change the fabric of society. The measures
 will require the break-up of the estates that have
 provided the base of the economic and political
 position of the nobles and landlords, who have
 been powerful conservative forces. The Coptic

 Church and the imperial family, two of the larger
 landowners, probably command enough prestige
 to ensure their continuing influence. Abolishinn
 public land grants, however, will deny Haile Selas-
 sie one of his most valuable methods of rewarding
 loyal followers.
 Local noblemen and landlords are likely to
 use all the influence they can muster to delay and
 deflect the reforms. Their anger at what amounts
 to a revolution in their relations with the peasants
 will probably be matched by the pe,;ants' im-
 patience to have their own farms.
 The government proposes to deal with cor-
 ruption by requiring officials to declare their
 property holdings, including land acquired while
 in office. Ministers' personal finances will also be
 subject to scrutiny. Meanwhile, demands for the
 prosecution of officials already charged with cor-
 ruption and for the dismissal of additional senior
 officials continue to pcse a problem for the gov-
 ernment.
 The policy statement also provides for re-
 forms in government administration, education,
 development, wages and prices, and taxes. So far,
 however, it has had no perceptible effect on wide-
 spread labor  unrest. Municipal employees in
 Addis Ababa went on strike for several days,
 forcing the resignation of the capital's mayor,
 whom they accused of corruption. A strike by
 railway workers has virtually ended traffic on the
 link between Addis Ababa and the Red Sea port
 of Djibouti, Ethiopia's life-line for vital exports to
 world markets. Customs and Finance Ministry
 employees conducted a four-day strike and forced
 the removal of three senior ministry officials. Bus
 and taxi drivers are also on strike in Addis Ababa;
 workers in four provincial capitals have con-
 ducted short strikes.
 The strikers, encouraged by government con-
 cessions to other workers last month, mainly
 want higher wages or the redress of other par-
 ticular grievances, such as the right to form their
 own union or the removal of unpopular admin-
 istrators. Few of the groups say they have lost
 confidence in the government's willingness to
 fulfill promises to improve workers' economic
 conditions, They are simply impatient to gain as
 many concrete benefits as possible while the gov-
 ernment's bargaining position is weak.
 Reformist military elements, meanwhile, are
 keeping up pressure on the government. Junior
 and nor.-commissioned  officers of the Tenth
 Mechanized Br;.;;ade, thn army's most prestigious
 unit, took over the city of Jijiga in eastern Ethi-
 opia for four days Iasi. week. They arrested several
 senior officers and some customs officials for
 alleged corruption. The troops returned to their
 barracks after the government reportedly prom-
 ised to curb rising grain prices. A few days earlier,
 troops of the Third Division succeeded in forcing
 the removal of the deputy chief of staff of the
 Ethiopian Aimy. Police units in several areas,
 having grievances similar to those of the soldiers,
 also registered their complaints by jailing their
 officers until their demands were met.
 Haile Selassie stated on April 14 that his
 21-year-old grandson, Tara Yacob, was in the line
 of succession, which n- ay take some of the heat
 out of at least one potentially divisive issue. It
 reduces the chances of a struggle-and possible
 civil strife-among other claimants who might
 have stepped forward if Haile Selassie became
 incapacitated and Crown Prince Asfa Wossen were
 unable to assume the emperor's duties. Asfa
 Wossen suffered a stroke a little over a year ago,
 and cabinet officials and military leaders doubt if
 he could perform effectively. The added legiti-
 macy given Zara Yacob's position has set the
 stage for Asfa Wossen to be eased completely out
 of the line of succession on the grounds of pcor

 The first phase of the UN's General Assem-
 bly on raw materials and development, which
 opened on April 9, will end on April 23 after the
 last addresses to plenary meetings of the assem-
 bly. The second, working phase, however, has
 already begun with the establishment earlier this

 working group to review drafts of a declaration of
 principles and an action program prepared by the
 nonal;gned and developing states. These states,
 under Algerian leadership, have been the driving

 special session is expected to adjourn.
 The paragraph-hy-paragraph examination of
 the draft declaration has revealed several difficult
 issues, the most contentious being "permanent
 soverei,- ty over natural resources." This call for
 the right of states to nationalize their natural
 resources and be the sole judges of compensation,
 which has been a central theme of the developing
 states' program, is opposed by the developed
 states. To date, most differences in negotiating
 the declaration have occurred between the devel-
 oped states--including the USSR-and the devel-
 oping states-to which China claims membership.
 This split is reflected even on those points of the
 declaration on which some progress has been
 made:
 ? improving terms of trade for developing
 states;
 ? reform of the international monetary
 system to favor developing states; and
 ? granting developing states preferential
 access for their goods to the markets of devel-
 oped states without reciprocal preferences for
 the developed states.
 Real differences, however, also exist among
 the developing states. The poor oil-importing
 states have been the most adversely affected by
 the increase in oil prices and have looked to the
 oil producers for relief. The solidarity of the
 nonaligned and deve'iopitig group could well de-
 pend on resolution (f this issue. As many as ten
 different proposals have ;peen made-ranging from
 multi-tier oil pricing to oi' right grants and low-
 interest, long-term lowrs from oil earnir:;s re-
 cycled  through the  Inter,iational M,iiietary
 Fund-but few commitments have been received
 on funding. The oil-importing states, perhaps still
 hopeful of receiving direct bilalar,~! aid from Arab
 oil producers if multilateral aid is not forth-
 coming, have generally refrained from sharp criti-
 cism of the oil producers. Many of their speeches
 have noted the example set for suppliers of oth.;r
 raw materials by the oil producers with their
 embargo and price increase. They could, however,
 still break the ranks of the nonaligned and de-
 veloping group if they see no support coming
 from their more fortunate brethren.
 While the proposal of the Organization of
 Petroleum Exporting Countries to establish an aid
 fund has not caught fire, support may be in-
 creasing for an internationally administered aid
 program to be financed, in part, by excess Arab
 oil revenues. The managing director of the Inter-
 national Monetary Fund expressed qualified opti-
 mism about this approach after his recent tour of
 several Arab states, including Saudi Arabia.
 The UN session itself will clearly riot resolve
 the very peal conflicts of interest inherent in trade
 in raw materials and its relation to the larger and
 longer term question of economic development.
 The generally restrained tone of the session and
 the raising of several proposals for global ap-
 proaches to the development problem may never-
 theless serve as a springboard for future examina-
 tion of specific issues in forums more suited to
 the particular problem.
 Moreover, although the nonaligned - devel-
 oping country group commands enough votes in
 the UN to force a resolution endorsing its pro-
 gram, the possibility of a confrontation is miti-
 gated somewhat by awareness that the industrial-
 ized states might retaliate by withholding aid to
 the least developed of the poor countries.

 The complex political and economic cross-
 currents were, of course, reflected in the -- creches
 to thEl session. Algerian President Bou, ~diene,
 who called for the UN meeting last Januar /, set a
 more business-like tone for the session than many
 observers had expected. While he avoided iii;1am-
 matory and provocative rhetoric, Bou-nediene
 nevertheless was uncompromising in his call frr a
 new world economic order and his condemnation
 of existing economic disparities between develop-
 ing and developed states.
 Soviet Foreit_~, Minister Gromyko expressed
 solidarity with the developing states and rejected
 attempts 4.o polarize the world into camps of rich
 and poor countries-where the socialist states
 would be lumped together with the  'est's devel-
 oped economies. Chinese Vice , iemier Teng
 Hsiao-ping, on the other hand, called for the third
 world to overthrow super power control and
 viciously attacked the Soviet Union as being an
 especially exploitative, neo-colonialist plunderer.
 Secretary Kissinger's speech was generally
 well received, with most countries expressing sat-
 isfaction with his call for recognition of world-
 wide interdependence and endorsing the US pro-
 posals for liberalized trade, sharing of food-pro-
 ducing technology, and increased aid for the
 poorest developing states. Iran, however, criti-
 cized the speech as a "gross mis.?epresentation" of
 the causes of high oil prices, repeating Tehran's
 standard argument that the main reasons for high
 retail prices are excessive oil company profits and
 high taxes levied by consumer countries. Tehran
 alleged that the Secretary was calling for con-
 sumer nations to band together to prevent further
 action by producer cartels-an idea Iran labeled a
 INTERNATIONAL MONEY
 Central  bankers are  increasingly uneasy
 about international money market prospects. A': a
 closed meeting last week in Basel, centrai bank
 governors expressed concern that growing politi-
 cal and economic uncertainties in Italy and
 France will lead to massive speculative move-
 ments of capital from these countries. Such out-
 flows, the governors believe, would complicate
 the market's task of recycling surplus oil-producer
 revenue to consuming countries.
 Bank of Italy officals were optimistic that
 capital outflows from their country can be con-
 trolled, but this view was not shared by the other
 bankers. Administrative measures aimed at curb-
 ing these outflows have not be'n effective in the
 past. In addition, the central bankers feel that
 Rome will have to end its costly defense of the
 lira, even though a decline in its value probably
 would provoke further speculative outflows of
 funds.
 The Bank of Italy has used the proceeds of
 recent massive Eurodollar loans to support the
 lira. Market intervention in the first quarter cost
 about $3 billion, or twice the present foreign-
 exchange reserves. Because indebtladness now ex-
 ceeds $10 billion, Italy will find further borrow-
 ing more difficult and expensive.
 The franc is much stronger than the lira
 because of France's relatively healthier balance of
 payments, but it is weaker than the mark and
 vulnerable to speculative capital movements. The
 central bankers apparen-ily believe that fears of an
 election victory by Socialist candidate Francois
 Mitterrand could lead to sizable capital move-
 ments ,rom France. Similar fears during the last
 presidential election intensified market pressure
 on the franc.
 25X1
 Investors already are seeking safer havens for
 their funds, and large capital outflows to London
 and Switzerland have been reported. If the trend
 continues, Paris will have only two major options:
 to accept a weaker franc, at least until after the
 election; or to intervene in the foreign-exch_ age
 market, which would further deplete France's for-
 eign-exchange  reserves.

 COLOMBIA TO ELECT A PRESIDENT
 Colombia's first authentic presidential elec-
 tion in 24 years will take place on April 21, with
 Liberal Party candidate Alfonso Lopez Michelsen,
 a slightly left-of-(enter reformer, the overwhelm-
 ing favorite. The new president will be inaugu-
 rated on August 7,
 For the past 16 years, Colombian politics
 have been dominated by the National Front, an
 artificial coalition of Liberal and Conservative
 parties that is now ertiing. It was established as a
 means of assuring political peace after th D ouster
 of dictator Gustavo Rojas Pinilla in 1957. The last
 presidential election before Rojas' take-over was
 in 1950.
 Lopez' principal opponent is Alvaro Gomez
 Hurtado, a moderate Conservative whose efforts
 to divorce himself from the image of his extremist
 father, the monumentally unpopular president
 who was deposed by Rojas, have been unsuccess-
 ful. Gomez is likely to win about 35 percent of
 the vote, to Lopez' 45 - 50 percent.
 Also in the running is Maria Eugenia Rojas
 de Moreno, Rcjas' daughter and hopeful recipient
 of the populist vote among the millions of poor
 who once supported her father and the party he
 founded,  The  National  Popular Alliance
 (ANAPO). Changing times, the advanced age and
 ill health of her father, the slow but sure collapse
 of ANAPO, and resistance to the idea of voting
 for a   woman  have conspired against Mrs.
 Moreno's political ambitions. She is not likely to
 receive more than 12 or 13 percent of the vote.
 Two minor candidates can be expected to share
 less than 6 percent.
 The campaigning candidates have empha-
 sized economic issues, in general refraining from
 personal attacks. Lopez has assailed the inflation,
 food shortages, and budget deficits that have
 plagued tthe incumbent Conservative adminis-
 tration of President Pastrara. Gomez has been
 vague and defensive, championing generalized
 economic develo?)ment.  Mrs. Moreno has pro-
 moted herself as an alternative to the Liberal-
 Conservative establishment and has appealed to
 the lower classes with a promise of "Colombian
 socialism."
 Scattered acts of violence have marred the
 campaign, but this has come as no surprise in a
 country which experienced open political warfare
 between Liberals and Conservatives during the
 1940s and early 1950s. President Pastrana, whose
 assiduous aloofness from the campaign has out-
 raged some of his Conservative colleagues, can be
 expected to control this s oradi  electoral vio-
 lence.                                           25x1
 BRAZIL: RESTLESS STUDENTS
 Student unrest has led to large demonstra-
 tions and other forms of political activity, which,

 if they continue or intensify, could lead the
 administration to reinstitute repressive measures
 against the dissidents.
 For some time, University of Sao Paulo stu-
 dernts have been dissatisfied with a number of
 administrative policies at the school. The latest
 outLreak, however, was sparked by the arrest of
 some 30 of their colleagues suspected of trying to
 organize a subversive student movement. Security
 officials charge that some of those arrested have
 links with outlawed revolutionary groups.
 Another cause of the increased student ac-
 tivism may have been the arrest of seven Sao
 Paulo union leaders whose activities had aroused
 government suspicions, The seven were accused of
 being subversives, or at least of being under the
 influence of alleged subversive elements within a
 church-connected social organization working
 with them.
 The university students have organized a
 "Committee for the Defense of Political Pris-
 oners," whose purpose is to aid those detained by
 the government. The committee also calls for
 freedom of assembly and speech, and other forms
 of liberalization. Other student groups are seeking
 the support of workers, churchmen, and opposi-
 tion politicians in their quest for a variety of
 political aims.
 Throughout the ten-year history of the mili-
 tiiry regime, significant opposition-to the extent
 that there has been any-has come from students,
 liberal clergy, and some labor groups. The admin-
 istration is undoubtedly concerned that these
 groups may have misinterpreted its intentik i to
 seek a limited easing of politicai controls and are
 taking liberties. That possibility is likely to give
 weight to the argument of security officials that
 firm action is needed now to prevent the spread

 PERON AND THE TERRORISTS
 The shooting and kidnaping of a USIS repre-
 sentative in Cordoba by Marxist terrorists
 apparent;,, signals a shift in tactics to include
 atf-?icks on US Government officials in Argentina.
 The Peron government, viewing the accelerating
 tempo of violence with a mounting sense of
 alarm,  is urgently seeking a dramatic break-
 through in its campaign to stamp out terrorism.
 As the level of confrontation edges r:p a notch,
 however, a fresh wave of violence seems in-
 evitable.
 The ubiquitous terrorists have  been un-
 daunted by the government's proclaimed in-
 tention to crack down on them. The best organ-
 ized of the groups, the Marxist People's Revolu-
 tionary Army, has shown little inclination to let
 up its pressure, and its hand is evident in many of
 the bombings, kidnapings, and political assassina-
 tions that have become a part of everyday life in
 the country. The Marxist group, which has now
 targeted members of the US mission in Argentina,
 was probably responsible for recent telephone
 threats afgairist military officers assigned to the US
 Eml?assy in Buenos Air^s. Although these terror-
 ists are not likely to eschew attacks against for-
 eign businessmen, their change of focus is prob-
 ably attributable to the swelling exodus of alien
 executives and the staggering success of their ear-
 lier ransom and extortion efforts.
 By taking a new tack, the Marxist gr'iup may
 hope to obtain additional publicity fc r its an-
 nounced aim of attacking "imperia;lsm." More-
 over, abductions of US officials cov?ld be used in
 attempts to force the release of imprisoned terror-
 ists or to create a further source of embarrass-
 ment for the Peron government.               25X1
 By generating an
 atmosphere of political confusion and  uncer-
 tainty, the left-wing extremists hope to ft;,., the
 groundwork for chaos after Peron's death. The
 reasoning appears to be that if civil war can be
 provoked, the left might have a chance to rise to
 power. While this prospect seems remote, the
 Marxist group nevertheless has shown a remark-
 able ability to operate virtually unchecked.

 Meanwhile, Peron is atternptiroy to inject
 now blood into the government's counterterrorist
 program and is urging more aggressive action.
 Another shuffle was made in the federal police
 hierarchy after it became clear that the President
 was dissatisfied with its failure to produce results.
 Ironically, these frequent command changes, to-
 gether with internal dissension and poor morale,
 seem to be contributing to police ineffectiveness.
 As a result, a drarnatic victory against the ex-
 tremists continues to elude the security forces.
 While Feron is taking steps to eliminate extremist
 influence from government ministries dnd the
 universities, there are still no signs that he will be
 able to reverse the tide of terrorism in the near
 future.
