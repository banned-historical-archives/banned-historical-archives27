 '7 NOVEN.rER 1971
 I 11D0CH I NA
 President Nixon's 12 November press conference announcement that
 45,000 U.S. troops will be withdrawn in the next two months was
 promptly deprecated in Hanoi radio and press comment as a move
 to assuage public opinion while continuing the war.  Like the
 President's 7 April announcement that 100,000 more troops would
 be withdrawn by December, this one occasioned no high-level DRV
 official statement; prior to April, all the President's major
 statements on Vietnamization and troop withdrawal since November
 1569 had elicited official statements.  DRV Foreign Minister
 Nguyen Duy Trinh, in a speech at a reception for a Cambodian
 FUNK delegation on the 16th, did take brief note of the
 President's press conference, saying routinely that it again
 showed U.S. intent to maintain U.S. forces in South Vietnam and
 to continue support for the Thieu administration.
 In Peking's initial reaction to President Nixon's press conference,
 an NCNA report on the 15th echoed Hanoi's interpretation of the
 troop withdrawal announcement as a move to allay public opposition
 while persisting in the war in Indochina.  If the President were
 serious about withdrawing troops, according to NCNA, he would
 accept the PRG's seven-point peace proposal.  PRC delegate ..o
 the UNGA Chiao Kuan-hua, in his maid--n speech on the 15th, also
 expressed support for the PRG's seven points, adding that a U.S.
 troop withdrawal to allow the three Indochinese countries to
 solve their own problems is "the key to the relaxation of tension
 in the Far East."
 Moscow's limited reaction to the President's troop withdrawal
 announcEment complained that he failed to set a date for complete
 withdrawal.  Soviet media selectively reported his remarks to show
 that the United States intends to continue seeking a military
 solution.
 Hanoi's concern over inroads by the allied pacification effort in
 South Vietnam is reflected in a series of unusually candid articles
 in the North Vietnamese army paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN.  Wile
 reiterating Hanoi's stock for east that the pacification program
 will fail, the articles also take note of allied claims of success
 and acknowledge difficulties created by the program.
 HANOI DERIDES PRESIDENT'S TROOP WITHDRAWAL ANNOUNCEMENT
 Hanoi media reacted promptly and predictably to the President's
 unscheduled 12 November press conference at which he announced

 projected U.S. troop withdrawals from South Vietnam during the
 next two months.  The initial comment came on the 13th in a
 Hanoi radio commentary, followed on the 14th by a statement
 from the DRV spokesman in Paris and comment in the army paper
 QUAN DOI NHAN DAN.  On the 15th Hanoi radio broadcast a
 Commentator article in the party daily NHAN DKN, a standard
 vehicle for comment on the President's pronouncements.  The
 only available Front comment was an LPA commentary of the 14th,
 broadcast by Hanoi. as well as Liberation Radio.
 The Hanoi radio commentary on the 13th set the line when it
 said that the President had to continue to withdraw a portion
 of U.S. troops to placate public opinion but that his real
 policy was evident from his failure to set a date for total
 withdrawal, his remarks indicating that he would maintain
 forces in South Vietnam "indefinitely," and his "threat" to
 step up air action if U.S. troops are endangered.  The radio
 commentary, like the LPA comment, acknowledged that 45,000
 troops are to be withdrawn during the next two months.
 Other Hanoi propaganda failed to mention the figure, although
 QUAN DOI NHAN DAN did observe that the President "acted as if
 the rate of U.S. troop withdrawal was greatly increasing."
 The Hanoi radio commentary described the three factors which
 the President said would determine further withdrawals--the
 level of enemy activity, progress in Vietnamization, and
 progress in the release of POW's--as a "prete-:t" for continuing
 the war.*  It argued that the President's conditions cannot
 be met because the South Vietnamese will continue to fight
 as long as the United States maintains troops there and
 supports the "puppet" Thieu regime, because any progress in
 Vietnamization is an "illusion," and because the way to obtain
 the release of prisoners is to respond to the 1 July PRG peace
 proposal and set a deadline for a total withdrawal.  The same
 resolve to continue the struggle is reflected in other
 propaganda, and QUAN DOI NHAN DAN said the fact that the
 *  The propaganda of course obscured the President's remarks
 on the level of infiltration from North Vietnam in connection
 with "enemy" action.  And only the NHAN DAN Commentator article
 cryptically acknowledged that the President spoke of progress
 toward a cease-fire as well as on the POW issue in outlining
 the third factor that would determine future withdrawals.

 President has had to maintain a "large number" of troops in
 South Vietnam and "step up" air raids gives the lie to
 Secretary Laird's recent statement that Vietnamization will
 be successful.
 Propagandists of course obscure the fact that the President
 said U.S. air strikes would have to be intensified if there
 was stepped-up infiltration of DRV troops into Laos and
 through Cambodia into South Vietnam.  But Foreign Minister
 Trinh in his 16 November speech at the reception for the FUNK.
 delegation, after claiming that the President's press
 conference remarks showed U.S. intent to maintain troops in
 South Vietnam, went on to say:  "The U.S. imperialists, far
 from ending their war of aggression in Cambodia and Laos,
 are intensifying it with a threat of stepped-up bombing for
 the massacre of the three Indochinese peoples."
 The President's statement that the combat role of U.S. troops
 in offensive action has already ended was ridiculed in some
 propaganda.  The DRV spokesman bluntly said that the
 President "lied" in this regard, and NHAN DAN's Commentator
 called the statement a""hoax."  While Commentator was not as
 vitriolic toward the President as Hanoi propaganda has been
 on occasion  in the past, I.e injected  the personally abusive
 remark that "Nixon's ugly face was laid bare" when he refused
 to announce a deadline for total withdrawal, as demanded by
 public opinion.  Both NHAN DAN and QUAN DOI NHAN DAN cited
 critical reactions to the President's announcement by
 senators, including Mansfield and Javits.  And NHAN DAN's
 Commentator said that the President's "stubborn" attitude will
 give impetus to the U.S. antiwar movement and prompt the
 Senate to increase its pressure fcr a deadline for a total
 troop withdrawal.
 NEGOTIATIONS     NHAN DAN's Commentator ridiculed the
 President's remark on continuing negotiations
 at Paris--"a very old maneuver to deceive public opinion."
 This cannot deceive the "progressives" in the United States
 and throughout the world, Commentator said, adding that the
 President "must be held fully responsible" for the stalemate
 at Paris.  The Hanoi radio commentary on the 13th reported
 that the President said he does not see any "prospect or
 breakthrough" in the Paris negotiations.  But it distorted
 hi6 remarks when it said:  "But he went on to say that he
 would carry out diplomatic activities through other channels."

 The commentary called this "a dirty trick designed to sidetrack
 public opinion and evade replying to the PRG's seven-point
 proposal."  (The President's remarks were in fact made in the
 context of the POW issue.  After saying "we have not given up
 on the negotiating front," he added:  "I would not like to
 leave the impression that we see the possibility of some
 striking breakthrough in negotiations in the near future.  But
 we are pursuing negotiations in Paris and through whatever
 other channels we think are appropriate.")
 ELABORATION OF     In castigating the President for refusing to
 PRG PROPOSAL       respond to the PRG's seven-point proposal,
 some of the propaganda has echoed DRV Foreign
 Minister Trinh's recent elaboration of the eemands in point one
 on U.S. withdrawal.  Thus, the Hanoi radio commentary on the 13th
 specified that putting an end to aggression and withdrawing
 troops included the cessation of "all activities of U.S. air
 and naval forces in South Vietnam."  The DRV Paris spokesman's
 statement echoed this along with the other additional demand
 that the United States must stop military aid to the Saigon
 "puppet administration."  Trinh had spelled out these two
 additional demands in a 24 October speech at a banquet for the
 visiting DPP.K delegation, and they were incorporated in the
 29 October joint DPRK-DRV communique on the visit.*
 LOW-KEYED PEKING REACTION DENIGRATES PRESIDENTS ANNOUNCEMENT
 P.'king's reaction to President Nixon's 12 November press conference
 has been in a low key and sparing of abuse while glossing over
 key issues.  In the only direct comment thus far, an NCNA report
 carried in Chinese on the 15th and in English the next day**
 interpreted the President's announcement on further troop
 *   These elaborations are discussed in the TRENDS of 3 November
 1971, pages 11-13.  At the 4 November Paris session PRG delegate
 Nguyen Van Tien also inserted the demand for an end to
 activities of air and naval forces in reviewing the PRG proposal,
 but this was not reflected in the VNA account of the session.
 **  The President's 7 April TV speech announcing troop
 withdrawals was similarly reported first by NCNA in Chinese
 on the 10th and in English on the following day.  There was no
 Peking comment on a more authoritative level.

 withdrawals as a move to allay public opposition while seeking
 to "persist in and prolong the war of aggression in Indochina."
 While acknowledging that 45,000 more troops wculd be withdrawn
 in December and January, NCNA noted the President's statement
 that the United States would maintain a residual force in
 South Vietnam and would continue to use air power until the
 Saigon regime has developed the capability to handle the
 situation.  The report also noted the President's remark
 that the United States might have to step up air strikes,
 but NCNA did not, of course, report that he indicated this
 would be in response to increased infiltration from North
 Vietnam.  Similarly, NCNA failed to note the President's
 conditions affecting further troop withdrawals--the level of
 enemy activity and infiltration rates, progress in the
 Vietnamization program, and progress in obtaining the release
 of prisoners and a cease-fire in all of Southeast Asia.
 The NCNA report shied away from the question of negotiations
 and predictably ignored the President's remarks on his
 forthcoming visits to Peking and Moscow.  In a bow to the PRG's
 seven-point proposal, which Peking editorially endorsed three
 days after the plan was introduced on 1 July, NCNA said "it
 would be a matter not of 45,000 men but of accepting the
 seven-point proposal" if the President "seriously wants to
 withdraw troops,"  But NCNA ignored the President's remarks
 linking troop withdrawals and negotiations as well as his
 suggestion that a negotiated settlement would mean withdrawal
 of American forces stationed "in other places in Southeast
 Asia or in the Asia theater that are directly related to the
 support of our forces in Vietnam."
 While seemingly taking care not to encroach on Hanoi's
 prerogatives, the NCNA reaction to the President's press
 conference also reflected Peking's concern not to mar the
 atmosphere for his impending visit.  NCNA derided the President's
 opening statement as having "sanctimoniously" promised an
 announcement of substantially increased troop withdrawal.  It
 also charged that "'peace' in his mouth is merely a synonym for
 continued aggression" and that "U.S. imperialism" seeks to hang
 on in South Vietnam in order to turn it into a military base
 for "aggression against Indochina and the whole of Asia."
 Nonetheless, NCNA's reaction was relatively mild.  By contrast,
 NCNA's report on his 7 April address called it "a downright
 fraud" and contemptuously concluded:  "To hell with Nixon's

 'troop withdrawal' hoax!"  NCNA at that time referred to the
 President as the representative of "the arch criminals"
 composing "the U.S. monopoly ruling circles"; it also claimed
 in April that the President was "more frantic and adventurist"
 than his predecessors and that his address foreshadowed
 "a more rabid adventure" than the Cambodian and Laotian
 campaigns.
 As in the reaction to the 7 April address, Peking has again taken
 note of "strong" opposition from public opinion to the President's
 announcement.  NCNA cited the Western press as reporting that
 "some" senators expressed disappointment over the announcement
 and that the announcement may be a ruse for the coming elections.
 Also as it did in April, NCNA has reported Vietnamese comment
 on the President's announcement, summarizing NHAN DAN and
 QUAN DOI NHAN DAN articles on the 16th.  Characteristically,
 Peking has left it to Hanoi to press points currently being
 blunted in Peking's own comment.  Thus NCNA quoted a NHAN DAN
 Commentator article as saying the President's press corference
 once again demonstrated his "colonialist, aggressive stand
 and his bellicose, obdurate attitude."  NHAN DAN was also
 cited for the view that the President's reference to a
 negotiated settlement is a "customary trick" and that his
 refusal to respond to the PRG's seven-point plan shows his
 unchanged intention to seek a military victory.
 ROUTINE MOSCOW REACTION DEPLORES PRESIDENTS STATEMENT
 The first Soviet reaction to the President's press conference
 came early on 13 November in the usual prompt TASS report,
 which acknowledged that he said 45,000 more troops would be
 withdrawn In December and January but complained that he made
 furt"er withdrawals conditional on progress in Vietnamization
 and in the training of the Saigon army.*  TASS failed to
 Or  The 14 November domestic service commentator's roundtable
 discussion contains, for the first time, internal evidence that
 this Sunday feature is recorded earlier in the week.  In the
 program as aired at 0900 GMT on the 14th, a participant noted
 that the President was to make an announcement on Vietnam on
 the 15th, with no reference to the press conference g?.ven two
 days before.  A repeat broadcast of the roundtable, at 1500
 GMT, converted this passage into a complaint that the President
 said "nothing new" at the press conference, his "first
 preelection statement."

 acknowledge the other conditions--the level of enemy activity,
 progress in obtaining the release of prisoners, and
 progress toward a cease-fire in all of Southeast Asia.
 TASS complained that the President said he considers it
 necessary to maintain "residual" forces indef initely in
 order to "keep the present Saigon regime in power," but it
 did not mention his comments on prisoners or a negotiated
 settlement in this context.  Instead, TASS routinely scored
 the President for allegedly making no proposals for a
 political settlement and for again ignoring the PRG's
 seven-point proposal.
 The TASS report also noted that the President stressed that
 the United States would "not only continue the air raids
 but also intensify them," without, of course, acknowledging
 that he said the bombings would have to be stepped up if
 infiltration from North Vietnam into the South were increased.
 A foreign-language commentary by Shakov, broadcast on the
 13th and 14th, similarly noted without elaboration that the
 President said the raids would be intensified "if necessary."
 The Shakov commentary said that preparations to extend U.S.
 intervention in Southeast Asia account for the "negative
 attitude" of the U.S. delegation at the Paris talks.
 Without referring explicitly to the President's remarks in
 this regard, the commentator said "Washington politicians"
 have chosen this time to declare "repeatedly" that the
 United States "sees no prospect in the immediate future of
 any substantial progress at the Paris talks."
 A foreign-language commentary by Soltan on the 15th referred
 to the recent antiwar demonstrations in the United States
 and said the White House decided to make a "pacifying
 statement" in order to create the Impression that the
 Administration is "allegedly sincerely trying to reach a
 negotiated settlement in Vietnam."  Routinely criticizing
 the United States for ignoring the PRG's seven points and
 for trying to retain a "military stronghold" in Indochina,
 Soltan complained that the President set no date for complete
 troop withdrawal.  And a domestic service commentary on the
 15th charged that the President intends to retain residual
 forces "indefinitely" to support the Saigon regime.
 A PRAVDA article by Vishnevskiy, briefly summarized by TASS
 on 17 November, said that the announcement on the withdrawal
 of another contingent of 45,000 troops "by no means signifies

 the reduction of combat operations."  It asserted Lbat "Pentagon
 hawks" are calling for intensified bombings of the DRV and that
 the Administration publicly "admitted" its intention to keep a
 residual force in Vietnam indefinitely.
 Like Peking, Moscow predictably ignored the President's remarks
 on his forthcoming visits to China and the USSR.
 INDOCHINESE UNITY REAFFII1MED DURING CAMBODIAN VISIT TO DRV
 A delegation of Sihanouk's front (FUNK) and government (RGNU)
 paid a "friendship visit" to Hanoi from 10 to 17 November at
 the invitation of the DRV Government and the Vietnamese
 Fatherland Front to reaffirm Vietnamese-Cambodian solidarity
 and presumably to coordinate their anti-U.S. plans.  The
 delegation, led by Ieng Sary, "special envoy of the interior
 part" of the RGNU, included a number of FUNK Politburo members
 and RGNU ministers.
 The delegation was greeted with considerable fanfare in Hanoi;
 its impending arrival was announced in a communique issued by
 the DRV Foreign Ministry on the 10th, and the visit was
 hailed in editorials in NHAN DAN and QUAN DOI NHAN DAN on
 the same day.  The group was seen off in Peking by Li Hsien-nien
 and was met at the airport in Hanoi by Foreign Minister Nguyen
 Day Trinh.  The Cambodians had talks with a DRV Government
 delegation headed by Trinh and also attended by Pham Van Dong,
 and they were received by Ton Duc Thang, Le Duan, and Dong.
 These meetings were described as having taken place in an
 atmosphere of "militant solidarity" and "fraternal friendship."
 Ieng Sary has been playing a prominent coordinating role, both
 between the pro-Sihanouk Cambodian forces in the field and
 those based in Peking and now between the Cambodians and the
 Vietnamese.  He had gone to Peking in August "directly from
 the front lines" in Cambodia, and his arrival there was used
 as a demonstration of the unity of the Khmer "patriots" at
 home and abroad and as an occasion for a show of Asian unity
 embracing Peking and its allies.*  His image as a representative
 of unity among the Khmers was further served by his role in
 "seminars" in Peking involving FUNK members and RGNU heads of

 diplomatic missions.  RGNU Premier Penn Nouth, in a speech reported
 by the FUNK radio on 5 November, praised Ie:.g Sary for having
 played "the most important role in achieving unity of views and
 stands, conscience and policy, and in strengthening the unity of
 Cambodians at home and abroad" by means of the seminars.
 UNITY Tt-EMES     Ieng Sary's visit to Hanoi was also used to
 promote themes of unity.  The visit was
 accompanied by copious testimony to Vietnamese-Cambodian
 solidarity and mutual expressions of gratitude for assistance
 and support.  Speakers on both sides repeatedly reaffirmed their
 loyalty to the joint statement of the Indochinese People's
 Summit Conference and the determination of the Indochinese
 peoples to continue to fight together in unity until victory.
 According to the joint communique signed on the 16th, the two
 sides discussed the anti-U.S. struggle and Cambodian-Vietn.uiiese
 relations, revealing "identical views on all problems discussed."
 (Similar references to unanimity of views appeared in the joint
 communiques on Podgornyy's early-October visit to Hanoi and
 the 24-30 October visit of the DPRK's Pak Song-chol; in all
 three cases, surrounding comment suggested that this characteriza-
 tion was included at the visitors' behest.  DRV spokesmen during
 the course of the visits avoided referring to unanimity of views
 even as the visitors so characterized the talks.)
 At a farewell banquet on the 16th, Ieng Sary expressed
 satisfaction that an "identity of views" had been reached on all
 questions discussed.  "Our two parties have identical conceptions
 and stands regarding the conduct of the revolutionary war of
 national liberation and regarding the offensives launched
 against the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs," he said,
 adding that "our delegation has particularly noted the unanimity
 of view of our two parties on the conception of militant and
 fraternal friendship and fighting solidarity."  But Nguyen Duy
 Trinh, in his brief speech at the banquet, did not offer any
 assessment of the discussions during the visit.
 NIXON VISIT     There were indications that President Nixon's
 TO PRC          projected visit to the PRC--regarding which
 Hanoi expressed disquiet in polemics last
 summer--was also a subject of discussion.  In a banquet speech
 on the 10th, Trinh made what could be interpreted as an
 allusion to the visit when he condemned the U.S. Administration
 for "making propaganda blasts about their hypocritical 'peace
 plans' and resorting to many perfidious maneuvers to try to

 divide the Indochinese peoples and weaken the anti-imperialist
 forces and the world people's movement in support of the peoples
 of Indochina."  An allusion to the President's visit had
 appeared in a 10 November AKT. commentary on Cambodian-Vietnamese
 solidarity, not specifically pegged to the Ieng Sary visit but
 obviously timed for it and mentioning it in passing.  Asser;;ing
 that President Nixon has been using "numerous deceitful tricks
 clamoring about 'cessation' of war, 'serious negotiations,'
 and 'search for peace for future generations,"' the commentator
 complained that "everywhere he shows his 'white flag' to pass
 for a 'messenger of peace."'  AKI charged that the President
 wants to mislead U.S. and international opinion "in the hope
 of having his presidential mandate renewed in the next election."
 The image of the U.S. waving a white flag--which Kim Il-song
 had used in his 6 August speech endorsing Peking's invitation
 to the President--appeared in a speech by Ieng Sary at a
 Peking meeting marking Cambodian National Day on 9 November,
 the day before his departure for Hanoi.  Without directly
 mentioning the President's forthcoming 'isit, Ieng Sary warned
 that "though U.S. imperialism is compelled tc come to China
 with a white flag" it continues its "vicious intrigues" cf
 denying the rights of weak and small countries and is resorting
 to "new trickery" to deceive public opinion.  This passage--
 containing the first public reference to the President'r: visit
 to have been made in Peking, apart from announcements on the
 Kissinger missions--might be read as an expression of concern,
 shared with the Vietnamese communists, over what effects the
 presidential visit may have on the anti-U.S. cause in Indochina.
 SOVIET ROLE     Presumably in deference to their hosts'
 sensitivities, the Cambodians avoided pointed
 allusions to the USSR's failure to extent recognition to the
 RGNU.  The AKI commentary on the 10th, however, aired the
 Cambodians' resentment toward the Soviets by pointing out that
 recognition of the RGNU "is the dividing line between genuine
 and fake" revoluticnaries and between "those who actually
 oppose oppression and those who just profess to do so."

 CUNr1UNISTS CALL CAPTURE OF CAMBODIAN TOWN "STRATEGIC VICTORY"
 The capture of the Cambodian town of Rumlong was officially
 hailed in a 13 November communique from the Route 6 command of
 the Cambodian National People's Liberation Armed Forces
 (CNPLAF).  As carried by Sihanouk's news agency (AKI) on the
 16th, the communique announced that on the night of
 12-13 November, after three weeks of attacks, the CNPLAF
 and people "unleashed a decisive attack against the last
 enemy positions" at Rumlorig and "recorded a smashing victory
 by annihilating the 46th puppet brigade and liberating
 Rumlong."  It claimed that more than 1,000 government troops
 were killed or wounded in the fighting at Rumlong, that
 "hundreds of others" surrendered, and that "a large quantity"
 of arms and war materiel was seized.
 This "strategic victory," according to the communique, marks
 the defeat of the Cambodian Government's Chenla 2 operation
 to clear Route 6 and "signals the defeat of the Nixon doctrine
 in Cambodia."  Claiming that "numerous" government positions
 are being encircled and attacked, the communique called upon
 the armed forces on Route 6 to "exploit their victories" and
 "strike harder."
 Hanoi's acclaim for "the brilliant victories" on Route 6 was
 expressed by Foreign Minister Nguyen Duy Trinh, in a speech
 on the evening of the 16th at a reception given by the head
 of the viclting Cambodian delegation, Ieng Sary.  Trinh
 singled out for praise the "resounding exploits" at Rumlong.
 On the 17th the Rumlong victory was welcomed in editorials
 in both NHAN DAN and QUAN DOI NHAN DAN.  The NHAN DAN
 editorial termed the capture of Rumlong a "ne,:v and outstanding
 contribution . . . to the common victory of the Indochinese
 peoples" and said it proved that the CNPLAF is capable of
 "attacking and completely destroying an important troop
 concentration in a large operational area" despite the
 "greatest efforts" by the Lon Nol forces with "direct support"
 from U.S. and Saigon forces.  QUAN DOI NHAN DAN acclaimed
 the engagement at Rumlong as a "big battle of annihilation
 and a brilliant feat of arms."

 DRV ARMY PAPER DISCUSSES STRUGGLE AGAINST PACIFICATION
 The series of articles on pacification published in QUAN DOI
 NHAN DAN, also broadcast in Vietnamese to South Vietnam,
 presents an unusually candid discussion of the allied
 pacification program.  The first article in the series,
 monitored on 11 November, was said to have appeared in the
 paper on that day.   (Although the VNA press review mentioned
 an article on pacification in QUAN DOI NHAN DAN on the 10th,
 no broadcast of this article was monitored.)  Subsequent:
 articles in the series were broadcast on 12, 14, and
 15 November.
 The article broadcast on the 11th takes note of allied claims
 of success in pacification when it discusses indicators--
 such as improvements in road security--used by the allies
 to demonstrate pacification progress.  It ridicules the
 practice of measuring success by the frequency of attacks on
 lines of communications, declaring that such attacks
 represent only one of "hundreds of guerrilla combat methods."
 It is not possible, the paper argues, to assess "an entire
 guerrilla warfare movement" or "revolutionary activity in
 villages and hamlets" by measuring the results of a single
 combat method.
 The article concedes that "in some areas the U.S.-puppets
 have edged outward triflingly," but it insists that this
 does not prove the success of pacification.  Such "temporary"
 problems, it says, are due to the fact that "the regional
 people are not sufficiently vigilant and fail to cleverly
 combine various struggle methods."  It goes on to repeat
 the routine claim that the balance of forces favors the
 communists and that the "total collapse" of the allied
 pacification program "is only a matter of time."
 The article broadcast on the 12th describes various
 pacification plans, stressing the increased priority
 placed on the pacification effort by the Nixon Administration.
 It warns that the fight against pacification "can never be
 belittled or neglected, and we cannot be optimistic or
 belittle the enemy schemes."
 The final article, spelling out methods to oppose
 pacification, advises, among other things, that efforts be
 concentrated on "annihilation" of "ringleader hooligans"

 and on the destruction of military posts.  Calling for the
 destruction of strategic hamlets so as to enlarge  'liberated
 areas" and achieve "liaison" and "mutual support" between
 bases, the article also maintains that "only by launching
 concerted, large-scale offensive waves under a unified plan
 will the southern armed forces and people be able to achieve
 high combat efficiency, deal the enemy vigorous blows, and
 demolish military subsectors."
 NORTH VIETNAMESE SPOKESMAN ROUTINELY PROTESTS U.S. BOMBINGS
 Alleged U.S. air attacks from 9 to 11 November in the demilitarized
 zone and Quang Binh Province are the subject of a routine DRV
 Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement on the 13th.  The statement
 charges that U.S. planes, including B-52's, attacked Huong Lap
 village while U.S. artillery from ships and south of the
 demilitarized zone shelled Vinh Son and Vinh Giang--all of which
 it says are in the demilitarized zone "on DRV territory."  The
 statement says U.S. planes "raided" a number of places in
 western Quang Binh during the same period.  The last previous
 foreign ministry spokesman's protest, on 8 November, had
 atypically prompted a flurry of comment.*
 None of the recent strikes is mentioned specifically in a
 15 November QUAN DOI NHAN DAN editorial which says that each
 time the United States suffers a setback it embarks on a
 "new militaty adventure."  The paper calls upon the people's
 local armed forces throughout the North-?-"especially in the
 fourth military region, in the coastal areas and along
 important communications lines"--to further "heighten their
 vigilance with a determination to crush all war adventures of
 the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, whenever and by
 whatever means they may come."
 HANOI OUTLINES PROCEDURES FOR CHRISTMAS MAIL TO POWS
 The procedures governing the mailing of Christmas packages and

 SINO -SOVIET  RELATIONS
 NEW PRC CORDER NEGOTIATOR ATTENDS SOVIET EMBASSY CONCERT
 In a curious development, Moscow on 13 November reported--to
 the Chinese radio audience only--that Ambassador Tolstikov on
 the previous day had hosted a concert at the Soviet embassy
 attended by a legion of PRC offi ials, including the n'w
 Chinese chief negotiator at the Sino-Soviet border talks.
 This represents the only confirmation thus far in either
 Soviet or Chinese media of the appointment of Han Nien-lung,
 a vice foreign minister in charge of Far Eastern affairs, to
 replace Chiao Kuan-hua, the original Chinese negoti-: lr at
 the border talks and now head of the PRC delegation dt the
 UN Gea ral Assembly session.  Chief Soviet negotiator Ilichev
 and his deputy were also present at the concert.  Peking has
 not mentioned the event.
 The Soviet report made the exceptional. gesture of referring to
 the Chinese officials as "comrades," a fraternal title that
 fell out of favor in Sino-Soviet relations as party ties were
 broken under the impact of the cultural revolution.*  The
 concert, at which two Soviet artists performed, was also notable
 for being a half step toward resumption of cultural exchange,
 another victim of the deterioration of relations during the
 cultural revolution.  Though the concert was sponsored by the
 Soviet ambassador rather than being held at Chinese invitation,
 the large turnout of Chinese officials marked another in the
 series of moves by the two sides toward observance of the
 diplomatic amenities and improvement of their working relations.
 The Soviet gesture may have been intended to redress in some
 measure the effect of Moscow's attack on the Chinese in marking
 the October Revolution anniversary a few days earlier.  While
 Peking used the occasion to send a conciliatory signal to the
 Soviets,** Politburo member Grishin, in his keynote address on
 6 November, sharply denounced the Chinese for their "splitting,
 anti-Soviet line," an attack prompting a walkout by Chinese

 diplomats.  The Soviets have expressed concern over the effects
 on their interests of Peking's flexible diplomatic moves,
 particularly its invitation to President Nixon.  But while
 seeking to impose discipline on the Soviet wing of the communist
 movement in order to meet Peking's challenge, Moscow has been
 willing to persevere in the protracted border talks, now into
 their third year without a change from the Peking venue.
 According to a 7 November article by a leading proxy spokesman
 for the Soviets, the Hungarian NEPSZABADSAG's Varnai, the Chinese
 have rejected new high-level talks with the Soviet leadership.
 That the Chinese wish to keep the talks going at the level of
 deputy foreign ministers seems reflected in the appointment of
 Han Nien-lung to replace Chiao Kuan-hua.
 MOSCOii4 CAUTIOUSLY DISCUSSES CHINESE INTERNAL DEVELOPMENTS
 The Soviet central press has reacted cautiously to speculation
 that Lin Piao has been purged, limiting itself to publishing a
 TASS report citing the Paris AFP on the subject.  The AFP
 dispai.ch on the 12th, noting signs L'at Lin has been ousted
 and citing a recent RED FLAG article attacking "sectarianism,"
 concluded that the Chinese military were being "stripped of
 important political rights" and r;.dt civilians are in the
 ascendancy.  The TASS version of the report was carried without
 comment in PRAVDA and the other Moscow dailies on the 13th.
 In an effort to put current PRC developments into perspective
 for the domestic audience, Radio Moscow's weekly commentators'
 roundtable pr-'gram on the 14th broached the subject after
 discoursing defensively on the triangular aspects of President
 Nixon's projected trips to Peking and Moscow.  Citing "Western"
 news sources, the panelists recounted reports of "the reshuffle
 in the Chinese leadership" involv4ng the disappearance of Lin,
 his wife, and a number of military leaders.  One commentator
 seemed at pains to point out that the changes would not alter
 Peking's anti-Sovietism or its policy of rapprochement with
 the United States:  "Judging from the continuing Chinese
 propaganda, the anti-Soviet course and the simultaneous
 revision of Chinese policy toward the United States are
 continuing, as is the development of Maoist concepts leading
 to further weakening of the front of the anti-imperialist
 struggle."

 17 NOVEMBER 197'_
 Soviet agitational broadcasts to China have sought to fan
 party-military tensions, as in one of the special programs for
 the PLA, on 13 November, which said the army is being used as
 a pawn in the Maoist leadership's "political game."  Calling
 attention to the disappearance of the Chinese defense minister
 and of other high-ranking military officers, the commentator
 explained that Mao ib resorting to a purge of the military "to
 increase his influence on every aspect of the country's political
 and economic life and to limit the role of the FLA."  The broad-
 cast went on to warn that "this is only the beginning" and to
 forecast that "as in the past, hundreds and thousands of high-
 ranking and middle-ranking commanders will be r.epiaced or
 persecuted."
 Moscow has avoided airing speculation about the crash of the
 PRC jet in the Mongolian People's Republic on the night of
 12-13 September.  TASS on 30 September had carried the Mongolian
 MONTSAME agency's report on the crash, and on 1 October TASS

 defected to the USSR.  Soviet media have not picked up rumors
 circulating in the WL,Aern press that the crashed jet was
 carrying Lin Piao or other Chinese military leaders.

 CHINA
 RED FLAG ARTICLES ATTACK "SWINDLERS." CALL FOR UNITY
 Lin Piao's name has gone unmentioned by Chinese media for the sixth
 consecutive week.  Meanwhile press articles continue to indicate
 that. unnamed high-level "political swindlers" have tried to split
 the party.  An article by the writing group of the Liaoning CCP
 Committee, published it, the 12th issue of RED FLAG and reprinted
 on 13 November in all Peking dailies, added new fuel to the
 campaign with the charge that anonymous enemies at one point
 distorted Mao's five requirements for party members as outlined
 in the party constitution, "lowering the requirements."  In 1967,
 Lin had issued "three criteria" for training, selecting, and
 promoting, which are similar to Mao's party requirements.
 Lin's three criteria seem quite uncontroversial, having as their
 main message the need to follow Mao, keep in touch with the masses,
 and maintain revolutionary vigor.  They do, however, seem to fit
 the article's attack on those who "pass off fish eyes as pearls"
 by "wantonly altering the five requirements set forth by Chairman
 Mao."
 The precise issues in question are illuminated very little by
 the RED FLAG article, although the trappings of a major purge
 are obvious enough.  The article notes that a bourgeois
 political style "among some persons has resulted in their
 political degeneration," which has led in turn co "serious
 errors in orientation and line."  "Just as" in the cultural
 revolution, "swindlers" have opposed the revolutionary integrity
 of the proletariat.  Although the party constitution does not
 say so, the article claims that the five requirements were
 advanced as a specific reminder "to be vigilant against
 individual careerists and schemers like Khrushchev and to
 guard against such baC ;,_,sons  usurping the leadership of
 the party and state at all levels."  Since the army under
 Lin apparently controlled the apparatus at all levels, the
 reference seems most applicable to him.
 The RED FLAG article seems to take special aim at those
 "leftists" who, during the cultural revolution, failed to
 adhere closely enough to the zigs and zags of Maoist policy.
 "One who adheres to an erroneous line can commit even greater
 errors if he displays greater enthusiasm," the article observes.
 "Leftist" targets are indicated again via a critique of certain

 incorrect "standards for communist party members and revolutionary
 cadres" which made no mention of Marxism-Leninism--a rather common
 flaw during those periods of the cultural revolution when Mao
 alone was the declared fount of all knowledge.   (The new winter-
 spring schedules for the Peking domestic radio, effective
 15 November, drop certain programs entitled "selected readings"
 or "study" :E Mao's works in favor of programs entitled "s,;udy
 Marxist-Leninist works ori;i Chairman Mao's works.")
 COMMENT      The 12th issue of RED FLAG also contains a commentary
 ON SONGS     on the two songs now being widely popularized through-
 out China, the "Internationale" and "Three Main Rules
 of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention."  The latter song,
 based on rules long associated with Lin as well as their author
 Mao, was last popularized during the early stage of the Red Guard
 movement in the fall of 1966.  The major theme of the song, as
 stressed by the commentary, is the need for unity.  The song is
 presented as an injunction to the army, party and people to
 "observe discipline, implement policy and unity" under Mao's
 line.
 The rules and points as presented in the commentary are revised
 to make them somewhat more applicable to the modern context.
 The first rule, "obey orders," receives special attention, and
 the other two rules are combined into a general plea for
 "building the nation with diligence and thrift."  Of the
 eight points, the commentary singles out only two for special
 attention; the first, "speak politely," is now interpreted as
 an injunction to respect the masses and guard against arrogance,
 themes that broadcasts indicate have special relevance for
 some PLA cadres at local levels.  The fifth point for attention,
 "don't hit or swear at people," is now interpreted as an
 injunction "not to issue orders arbitrarily" and to strengthen
 ideological education among the masses.
 The popularization of the "Internationale" is apparently also
 related to the leadership situation.  The commentary echoes
 earlier articles in quoting from the song the phrase "never
 has there been a savior"--an implicit rebuke to Lin, who
 during the cultural revolution constantly hailed Mao as the
 genius responsible for the Chinese revolution.
 PROVINCIAL   In their turn, the provincial radios increasingly
 BROADCASTS   reflect elements of discord between army and party
 personnel.  The Hunan provincial radio on 5 November,
 for example, after reviewing the various historical attempts to
 undermine party unity, confidently predicted the inevitable doom

 of all "political swindlers" who plot to "sabotage unity and
 attempt to split the party."  Leveling direct criticism at PLA
 members of local party committees, the broadcast warned that
 "it is certainly not right to issue compulsory orders, and
 still less is warlordism permitted,"  Leading bodies were
 instructed to adopt methods of "persuasion and education" and
 to cast aside the "attitude of comrandism and methods of
 compulsion.."
 The Hunan commentator also forcefully argued the need to
 counter the .nfluence of "politi-al swindlers like Liu Shao-chi"
 who pretend to be "humble little commoners" (a reference to
 Chen Po-ta), and of those who "frantically preach the idealist
 theory of genius" in order to "lead us astray."  But the
 developing bill of indictement against Lin--for his erroneous
 view of the role of human genius and resultant "excessive"
 adulation of Mao--was spelled out more directly in a Szechwan
 broadcast on 5 November.  After asking its audience to "please
 listen carefully," the Chengtu radio followed RED FLAG'S
 lead in quoting from the song "Internationale"--"never has
 there been a savicr, nor will we ever rely on godfl and
 emperors"--to buttress its condemnation of "political
 swindlers" who have claimed to be gifted with genius but in
 fact "did not know how to work, til the land, or fight a war."
 Claiming that those "schemers and careerists" who pretended to
 be heroes have been "crushed to pieces by the advancing wheel
 of history," the broadcast firmly declared, "Let the absurd
 theory that 'heroes create history' go to hell!"
 Current party-army tensions were also discussed in a Shensi
 broadcast on 8 November which reported on the activities of
 a local PLA unit to increase the soldiers' perception of the
 harm done by previous attempts to split the party and army.
 Members of the unit turned to Mao's works to deepen their
 understanding of the "antiparty behavior of C}-ang Kuo-tao in
 splitting the red army" and concluded that since the question
 of "to unite or to split" separates "genuine and sham Marxism-
 Leninism" the goal of "party unity should be as dear to us as
 our own lives."  They also recalled the c--imes of "political
 swindlers like Wang Ming and Liu Shao-chi' who plotted to
 "split the party while constantly waving the signboard of
 Marxism-Leninism and putting forward a set of reactionary
 theories to deceive the masses."  Those cadres who had been
 "fooled thereby" were instructed to intensify their study of
 Mao's works "and unite closely around the party Central
 Committee headed by Chairman Mao."

 The specific need for greater civilian control over local PLA
 members engaged in the "three supports and two militaries,"
 administrative tasks entrusted to the PLA during the cultural
 revolu'Llon, was argued in a 6 November Changsha broadcast.
 Leading PLA cadres in local party organizations were instructed
 tQ urderstand fully that "the higher their aut!- -?ity, the more
 should they be modest and prudent and the more effort should
 they make to st-.en-then their concept of the party" and obey
 the "unified leadership" of local CCP committees.  The broadcast
 asserted '_h at military personnel, "no matter how high their
 positions are," must all place "themselves inside the CCP
 committees, not outside and above the CCP committees."
 A similar broadcast on 8 November by the Kwangsi provincial
 radio noted that the members of the Nanning garrison CCP
 committee are sharpening their understanding of "the importance
 of rifles being commanded by the party."  Apparently, however,
 there are still a few who resist this concept; the broadcast
 called for greater vigilance within all garrison departments
 to guard against those who "oppose the red flag with one of
 their own" and seek to "usurp our party and state."
 SHANSI PARTY-GOVERNMENT CHIEF LOSES POST AS #  CO+1ANDER
 In a move that may portend a coming trend, one provincial
 leader has given up his post as commander of the military
 district while continuing to serve as party and government
 chief of the province.  A 13 November Taiyuan broadcast,
 reporting on a local PLA rally for a martyr, identified Tsao
 Chung-nan as the commander of the Shansi Military District
 (MD), a post that had been previously held by Hsieh Chen-hua,
 first secretary of the Shansi Provincial Party Committee and
 chairman of the Shansi Revolutionary Committee.
 Both Hsieh and Tsao have had military responsibilities within
 Shansi since 1967.  Tsao became a vice-chairman on the
 provincial revolutionary committee last November and was
 named a secretary on the new provincial party committee
 announced last April.  Hsieh's vice-chairmanship on the
 revolutionary committee dates back to 1967:  In May 1970 he
 was identified as commander of the Shansi MD and in September
 this year as chairman of the revolutionary committee.

 This shift in MD leadership may have occurred, unannounced,
 sometime ago.  Although Hsieh has appeared regularly in recent
 months, including a 6 November appearance at a provincial
 conference on publishing work, he has not been identified as
 commander of the Shansi MD since C,;*ober 1970.  Since the
 formation of the provincial party cc~ aittee last April, he
 has been listed only as first secrets y of the provincial party
 committee and chairman of the revolutionary committee.

 MIDDLE EAST
 MOSCOW SUPPORTS CAIRO CALL FOR UNGA DEBATE ON MIDDLE EAST
 Soviet propaganda on the Middle East, sustained at a low level
 this fall, responds in low key to Cairo's request, reported
 in the 13 November AL-AHRAM, for an UNGA debate on the Middle
 East at the end of November.  Moscow does not deal with speci-
 fics of Egypt's plan of action, with a domestic service commen-
 tary by LITERARY GAZETTE observer Kurov on the 13th merely
 noting that Egypt is striving for a UN decision on fulfilling
 Resolution 242.  (As outlined by AL-AHRAM, Egypt will seek a
 resolution calling or. Israel to give a positive reply to
 Jarring clarifying its commitments toward implementation of
 Resolution 242, and, if Israel rejects such a solution, will
 ask the General Assembly to take several steps, including
 imposition of sanctions against Israel.)
 Other Soviet press and radio commeaL praises the decision as
 exemplifying Egypt's desire for a political settlement.  An
 Arabic-language talk and an English-language commentary on
 Radio Peace and Progress on the 14th reaffirm the Soviet
 position, stated by Podgornyy during Egyptian President
 as-Sadat's October visit to Moscow, of continued efforts
 for a political settlement while assisting Egypt and other
 Arab countries in strengthening their "defense capacity.."
 The Peace and Progress commentary provides the first avail-
 able Soviet reference to what the broadcast calls Washington'ss
 decision "not to renew deliveries" of Phantom planes to
 Israel "at the moment."  It calls  his "another of Washington's
 maneuvers" timed to coincide with the UNGA debate in an effort
 to forestall expected criticism of U.S. policy.  The radio's
 remark was presumably prompted by--but does not allude to--
 Secretary Rogers' U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT interview, in the
 issue dated 22 November, in which he said that up to now the
 military balance has not shifted, that a review is "in train" in
 light of the recent Soviet-Egyptian communique, and that Presi-
 dent Nixon has made it clear he will be sure that the military
 balance is continued.  Rogers added that the USSR in the last
 four or five months "operated with some restraint as far as
 shipments are concerned."

 AS-SADAT     The Kurov domestic service commentary on the 13th
 SPEECH       cited as-Sadat as saying, in his 11 November speech
 at the inaugural session of the People's Assembly,
 that the Miudle East question concerns withdrawal of Israeli
 troops and restoration of Palestinian rights, not the opening
 of the canal, and that Egypt will never agree to the substitu-
 tion of an agreement on opening the canal for an overall settle-
 ment of the crisis.  Kurov dismissed the idea, reported by Israeli
 and U.S. media on the 11tA, that Israel is prepared to let Egypt
 begin clearing the canal, without withdrawing Israeli troops from
 the east bank of the canal.  Such asgertions, Kurov said, would
 lead one to believe that the entire Middle East crisis was just a
 matter of navigation through the canal.  And in a 15 November
 PRAVDA article, Glukhov noted that as-Sadat's "peace initiative"
 regarding the canal is viewed as a first step on the road toward a
 general settlement.
 Glukhov cited as-Sadat's new condition--an affirmative Israeli
 reply to Ambassador Jarring's 8 February 1971 memorandum--as a
 preliminary condition "for discussing the question of opening
 the Suez Canal."  The Egyptian president had called it an
 "indispensable condition that must precede any other step" and
 had said that without an affirmative anewer from Israel "there
 will be no room for any debates or discussions."  While as-Sadat
 did not specifically link his condition with discussions on the
 canal issue, AL-AHRAM made this connection in a 13 November arti-
 cle.
 Moscow's first known acknowleigment of as-Sadat's declaration
 that 1971 will be "a decisive year"--first made in remarks to
 troops on the Suez front in early June and subsequently repeated--
 appeared in the TASS report of his Assembly speech on the 11th.
 TASS said he "reiterated" that 1971 must become the year of the
 solution of the Middle East crisis.  The "decisive year" formula-
 tion is also pointed up in - PRAVDA article by Demchenko on the
 16th:  Demchenko charged "imperialist propaganda" with trying
 to distort Egypt's real position as well as the meaning of
 as-Sadat's "statement that 1971 should become the decisive year."*
 Judging from the TASS report, Demchenko, without explanation,
 said that an end has been put to these propaganda "concoctions"
 by Cairo's new initiative in proposing an UNGA debate.
 *  AL-AHRAM editor Haykal, in his 5 November article, explained
 that decisiveness did not mean "reaching the ultimate result,"
 whether through peace or war, but only "making a decision."

 ROLE OF         Moscow has not yet publicly addressed itself to the
 BIG POWERS  matter of PRC participation in big power consulta-
 tions on the Middle East.  In the days immediately
 after the 25 October UNGA vote on PRC seating in the United Nations,
 Moscow had continued to press for renewed efforts by the "Big
 Four" in promoting a settlement.  Propagandists had been pursuing
 this line since Gromyko's complaint in his 28 September UNGA
 address that Israel and "its patrons" had paralyzed Jarring's
 mission and stalled the four-power consultations.  However, a
 possible allusion to a Chinese role appears in a 4 November
 PRAVDA article by Demchenko:  He assailed U.S. initiatives and
 mediation attempts undertaken without consulting "other member
 states" of the Security Council.  TASS' 31 October account of a
 press conference statement by Elysee spokesman Baudoin on the
 Brezhnev-Pompidou talks had failed to include his "wait-and-see"
 reply to a question about the effect of Peking's entry into the
 Security Council on the four-power discussions.
 Recent elite references to the Big Four talks have included
 Brezhnev's remark in Paris, at a 27 October dinner for Pompidou,
 that the four powers have a duty to facilitate a peaceful settle-
 mcnt.  The French-Soviet communique called it necessary to give
 Jarring an opportunity  to resume consultations and added that
 the USSR and France would use all available possibilities,
 including the quadripartite consultations, to explore ways for
 a Middle East settlement.  The 26 October communique on Kosygin's
 visit to Canada said the sides agreed on the need to support
 the efforts of the four powers and Ambassador Jarring.
 Moscow again spelled out its grievances against the U.S. position
 in the talks in a 28 October article by PRAVDA's New York
 correspondent Kolesnichenko, who in two previous articles this
 year--in February and August--had detailed, and attacked,
 Washington's "negative stand" in the talks.
 PRC ENVOY IN UNGA REAFFIRMS PEKING SUPPORT FOR PALESTINIANS
 In his maiden speech at the 15 November UNGA session, Peking's
 delegation head Chiao Kuan-hua sustained the PRC focus on
 the Palestinian element in the Middle East problem, mentioning
 the Palestinians six times in one paragraph.  But while expressing
 the belief that the Palestinians "and other Arab peoples" will
 recover the lost Arab territories and restore Palestinian "national
 rights," he seemed to be keeping the diplomatic options open on
 the question of a settlement by failing to advocate armed struggle.

 He defined the Middle East question as aggression by "Israeli
 Zionism" with the "support and connivance of the superpowers,"
 and took another swipe at the United States and the USSR in
 concluding that no one has the right "to engage in. political
 deals" behind the Arabs' backs, "bartering away their right to
 existence and their national interests."
 Chiao made no mention of the various efforts within or outside
 the United Nations to promote a settlement, and there has been
 no indication from Peking media of Chinese views on the problem
 since the 25 October UNGA vote on I'ZC seating.  Cairo sources,
 however, have evinced interest in the PRC position:  AL-AHRAM
 revealed on the 10th, according to tEe MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY
 (MENA), that "important contacts" had taken place recently
 between Cairo and Peking to learn China's opinion and the line
 it would take in the United Nations.  And the paper reported
 on the 13th that Egyptian Foreign Minister Riyad is expected to
 visit Peking in January at the invitation of the Chinese Govern-
 ment.
 MENA on the 10th said that the Chinese delegation to the United
 Nations, in a statement made during a stopover at Cairo airport,
 expressed China's firm support for as-Sadat's "attitude and
 efforts to achieve a just peace," and pointed out that the
 Middle East crisis would be a top item on the delegation's
 agenda at the United Nations.  The following day, MENA reported
 that PRC Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien, in a statement published
 in AL-JUMHURIYAH that day, affirmed the need for Israeli with-
 drawal from the Arab territories and i+aple-nentation of the
 November 1967 Security Council resolution.  MENA quoted Li as
 saying that nonimplementation of Resolution 242 and "failure
 of the talks"--nature unspecified---would create a complicated
 situation in the area.
 RELATIONS       According to MENA, Li expressed astonishment that
 WITH ISRAEL     Israel voted in favor of the Albanian draft resolu-
 tion on China; he denied rumors, MENA said, about
 the existence of PRC-Israeli trade relations and declared Peking's
 determination not to develop relations with Israel in any field,
 whether economic, political, or cultural.
 However, Chou En-tai in his ASAHI SHIMBUN interview, as reported

 relations with Israel but left the door open with regard to

 Peking had earlier reacted to "fabrications" in some Israeli

 establishment of diplomatic relations."' A PEOPLE'S DAILY

 in turn accusing the Soviet agency of trying to divert
 attention from the "sinister activities which social-imperialism
 itself is engaged in, including its collusion with Israel."*
 MOSCOW KILLS, RESURRECTS REPORT ON GOLDA MEIR IN WASHINGTON
 A series of recent reports by Moscow media alleging that Israeli
 Prime Minister Golds' Meir was visiting Washington seems to indi-
 cate the bureaucratic difficulties involved in killing an
 erroneous story once it gets into Moscow', propaganda pipeline.
 On 4 November, the day Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi began
 her Washington visit, a New York datelined TASS report said
 that Mrs. Meir had arrived in Washington and was expected to
 have meetings with President Nixon and other U.S. officials.  The
 item was transmitted in TASS' Russian-language service at
 0647 GMT.  TASS English transmitted the item at 0806 GMT and
 repeated it about an hour later, meanwhile having reported Mrs.
 Gandhi's visit.
 Some eight hours later, at 1559 GMT, TASS English finally trans-
 mitted a service message killing the item on Mrs. Meir.  But
 three hours after that Moscow's Arabic-language service had still
 failed to get the word:  A brief commentary in the 1900 GMT pro-
 gram on Israel's demand for more Phantom planes began with the
 statement that Golds Meir had arrived in Washington to meet with
 American officials.
 Curiously, the story surfaced again a week later, when Moscow's
 domestic service at 2230 GMT on the 11th carried a commentary
 by LITERARY GAZETTE observer Kurov on the Israeli budget debate.

 ARMS CONTROL
 SEMENOV REPLEDGES USSR TO SERIOUS EFFORT AT VIENNA SALT
 Negligible Soviet propaganda attention to the opening of the
 sixth round of the strategic arms limitation talks (SALT) in
 Vienna on 15 November has been confined to reportage on the
 arrival statements and activities of the U.S. and Soviet
 negotiators.  By contrast, on the eve of the opening, of the
 previous round in Helsinki on 8 July, a lengthy article by
 V. Viktorov in PRAVDA had recapitulated Soviet propaganda
 attacks on U.S. opponents of an agreement on arms limitation,
 at the same time noting that the 20 May U.S.-Soviet announce-
 ment said the two countries had agreed to concentrate their
 efforts this year on an accord limiting the deployment of
 antimissile defense systems and to work toward "certain
 measures" limiting strategic offensive arms.*
 Chief Soviet delegate Semenov in his arrival remarks on the
 14th, reported by TASS, repledged the USSR to serious
 negotiations, noting that the Soviet Government had
 instructed his delegation to "conduct the talks in a
 constructive manner."  Recalling that the course of the
 upcoming talks was specified in the 20 May U.S.-Soviet
 agreement, he said there is now "a real opportunity for
 obtaining positiv,_ results." In the pattern of his arrival
 remarks in Helsinki on 7 July, Semenov did not spell out
 the issues to be discussed.  He said only that the agreements
 reached at the last round--on improving the means of
 preventing accidental or unsanctioned use of nuclear weapons
 and on improving the Washington Moscow hotline--are proof
 that positive results can be achieved when there is "mutual
 good will."
 The same TASS report on the 14th said that Ambassador Smith,
 in a statement for the press, had expressed hope for
 "a successful completion of the talks in.the near future."
 A TASS report of President Nixon's 12 November press
 conference noted briefly that the President, in answer tc
 a question, said "he believed in the possibility of

 progress toward the achievement of an agreement before the end
 of the year."  TASS did not go on to cite his observation that
 an agreement must limit both defensive and offensive Weaponry.
 Moscow continues routinely to attack U.S. opponents of
 strategic arms limitation, with a lengthy article in the
 November issue of the journal MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZI?IDUNARODNAYA
 OTNOSHENIYA by A. Kalyadin, for example, complaining about
 "influential forces" in the United States which are striving
 "to retain as much freedom as possible for the military-industrial
 nomplex in building up military might."  Signed to the press on
 21 October, the artf.cle said that the participants in the
 "polemic" around SALT are divided into three groups--those who
 see a need to curb the growth of armaments through international
 agreements or through the policy of mutual example and who
 grant the possibility of some reduction in the existing level
 of world armaments; those who advocate limiting certain types
 of arms in favor of accelerating the development of others;
 and the "extremists" who are "sharply hostile to SALT, condemn
 the existing international agreements in this sphere, and
 oppose any attempts to prevent the buildup of military might
 and the improvement of the instruments of war."  The last
 group, the author asserted, id made up of businessmen who
 have grown rich on military contracts, "rightist" politicians,
 certain senators and congressmen, research corporations,
 centers for strategic studies, and activists from ultraright
 organizations like the John Birch Society.
 CHIAO MENTIONS LIQUIDATING BLOCS IN UN POLICY STATEMENT
 Chiao Kuan-hua, delivering the maiden PRC speech before the
 UN General Assembly on 15 November, in the main recited
 familiar Chinese i.Lrmulations on disarmament issues.  In
 one notable passage, however, Chiao took the occasion to
 hail what he described as the demand of the peoples of the
 world for the dissolution of military blocs, the withdrawal
 of foreign troops, and the dismantling of foreign military
 bases.  While Chinese spokesmen over the years have
 frequently called for troop withdrawal and liquidation of
 foreign bases, they have only rarely mentioned the third
 element of the trinity, the liquidation of military blocs.
 That demand was last broached in the 9 June communique
 following Ceausescu's visit to the PRC--evidently
 reflecting a Chinese effort to identify yet another point

 of convergence with the Romanians, who have long called for
 the liquidation of blocs.*  The last known high-level
 Chinese reference to the subject before that had been in
 November 1963, when the Chinese delegate at a World Peace
 Council meeting in Warsaw outlined a prograir _o prevent
 world war; among other steps, he called for the liquidation
 of forelen military bases, withdrawal of foreign troops, and
 dissolution of "aggressive" military blocs.
 In the UN speech, carried in full by NCNA on the 16th, Chiao
 disavowed any Peking intent to be a "superpower," at the
 same time assailing the "one or two superpowers" which would
 "manipulate and monopolize" the United Nations and are
 engaged in arms expansion while talking about disarmament.
 Without mentioning the Soviet proposal of last June for a
 conference of the five-nuclear powers, but in language
 reminiscent of the 30 July PRC statement rejecting that
 proposal, Chiao asserted that China "will never participate
 in the so-called nuclear disarmament talks between the
 nuclear powers behind the backs of the non-nuclear countries."
 The nuclear disarmament sought by the superpowers, he said,
 is "entirely for the purpose of monopolizing nuclear weapons."
 Defending the PRC's development of nuclear weapons, which he
 said are still in the experimental stage, Chiao insisted
 that the PRC's weapons are solely for purposes of defense,
 for breaking the nuclear monopoly, and for ultimately
 eliminating nuclear weapons and nuclear war.  He repeated
 the long-standing Chinese proposal for a world summit
 conference to discuss nuclear disarmament and, as the first
 step, to reach an agreement on the non-use of nuclear
 weapons.  Reaffirming that the PRC will never be the first
 to use nuclear weapons, Chiao went on to challe,-- the
 United States and the USSR--as in the 30 July PE,; statement--
 to commit themselves not to be the first to use the weapons.
 *  Sino-Romanian affinities in the diplomatic arena seemed
 reflected in a 13 November NCNA report on visits by Chiao to
 the Albanian, Romanian, and Algerian delegations to thank
 them for their efforts in behalf of PRC representation.  It
 would be natural for the Albanians and Algerians--principal
 cosponsors of the pro-PRC resolution--to be singled out in
 this way, but the inclusion of the Romanians appears to be a
 special gesture in their favor.  After his visit to Peking,
 C ausescu picked up the Chinese theme of common interests
 uniting the "small and medium-size countries."

 GERMANY
 AXEN IN FINLAND:  GDR MEDIA IGNORE DETAILS OF FINNISH PROPOSAL
 GDR media's coverage of SED Politburo member Hermann Axen's
 7-12 November visit to Finland, at the invitation of the
 Finnish Communist Party (SKP), has portrayed it not only as
 a parity-to-party contact but also as a public step forward
 in the development of state relations between the GDR and
 Finland.  Reporting on Axon's activities and meetings throughout
 the six-day visit, including talks with President Kekkonen,
 Prime Minister Aura, and Foreign Minister Mattila, East
 Berlin's ADN and NEUES DEUTSCHLAND have noted that problems
 of European security and the development of GDR-Finnish
 relations were discussed.  However, in keeping with past
 avoidance of any discussion of the details of the 10 September
 Finnish Government proposal to establish full diplomatic
 relations with both German states, East Berlin has refrained
 frum reporting the substance of Axon's public remarks on the
 subject in Finland.
 That the aim of the trip went beyond the mere holding of talks
 with a fraternal party was made clear in Axen's statement upon
 arrival back in East Berlin on the 12th.  The SED Central
 Committee, he said, had assigned him two tasks:  to strengthen
 relations with the SKP, and "to contribute, through talks
 with the leading political figures of the Republic of Finland,
 to fully normalizing relations between Finland and the GDR."
 Axen concluded that his talks with the Finnish leaders had
 promoted the latter goal, looking toward eventual full
 diplomatic relations.  The joint communique on the visit,
 however, sought to play down the official state aspects of
 the visit by noting only that Axon was received by Kekkonen,
 with no mention of his meeting with the Finnish premier and
 foreign minister, and by omitting any reference to the Finnish
 Government proposal.
 It is in a second document issued at the conclusion of the
 visit--a joint declaration entitled "For the Security of the
 Peoples of Europe," signed in the name of the SED and SKP
 central committees--that the SKP "welcomes the GDR's readiness
 to conduct negotiations on the conclusion of a state treaty
 on the settlement of relations between the GDR and the
 Finnish republic, including the establishment of diplomatic

 relations."  The SKP then restates its view, made previously
 in statements issued by its central committee in September and
 October, that "Finland must on no account make the establishment
 of diplomatic relations with the GDR dependent on the attitude
 of the FRG."*
 In publicizing the text of this document, East Berlin media
 carried their first acknowledgment that the Finnish proposal
 to establish relation- with the GDR is contingent on simultaneous
 approval by Bonn for the establishment of FRG diplomatic relations
 with Finland.  But where Helsinki radio reported Axen as stating
 at a press conference in Finland on the 12th that the GDR
 proposal, according to which talks should be held simultaneously
 with the two German states," ADN reported only that he called
 for the opening of bilateral negotiations between the GDR and
 Finland.  Helsinki's report said he added that while the GDR
 has given "an affirmative reply" to the Finnish offer, the
 "complete sovereignty of the sides" must be borne in mind.
 understood the principle of equality contained in the Finnish
 Although Axen in Finland publicly broached the Finnish proposal
 for negotiations on settlement of damagca caused by German
 troops in Finland in 1944-45, GDR media's brief accounts of
 his speeches ignored this aspect and it is unmentioned in the
 joint declaration.  On the 9th, according to Helsinki media,
 Axen remarked that it would be difficult to appraise the grounds
 for Finland's claim to compensation for war damages and asserted
 that the important thing was to move ahead with negotiations on
 normalizing relations.
 *  Moscow media have not been heard to report the joint
 declaration, although TASS briefly summarized the joint
 communique, including passages in which the two parties
 jointly condemned the "anti-Soviet chauvinistic policy of
 the Mao Tse-tung group."

 FRG- CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 PRAGUE ANTICIPATES PROGRESS IN NEXT ROUND OF BILATERAL TALKS
 In a speech one week before the fourth round of FRG-Czechoslovak
 talks, slated to be held in Bonn on 18 and 19 November, Czechoslovak
 party Presidium member Vasil Bilak foresaw "substantial" progress
 toward the talks' objective of bringing about negotiations to
 normalize relations.  In the speech, delivered at an election
 meeting on the 11th and carried in Bratislava media, Bilak may
 also have publicly foreshadowed a muting of Czechoslovakia's
 unyielding approach on the pivotal issue of the Munich agreement
 in the next round of the talks.
 Pointing out that the successful development of bilateral economic
 relations could serve as the model for normalization of relations
 in the political sphere, Bilak reiterated the basic Czechoslovak
 stand calling for West German recognition of the invalidity of
 the Munich agreement ab initio in order to give necessary impetus
 to the development of political ties.  "Sooner or lcter," he said,
 "the responsible circles in the FRG must realize that whatever was
 committed by Fascist Germany against our people was a crime and
 must be fundamentally condemned from its very beginning."  But he
 went on to indicate what may possibly be the basis for a face-saving
 gambit looking toward an accommodation on the issue:  He argued
 that "no extenuating circumstance or any justification exists or
 can exist even for the temporary validity of the Munich diktat;
 no Czechoslovak government can ever recognize even the temporary
 validity of the Munich agreement.  This was . . . a crime, and
 as a crime it cannot be acknowledged as an act of law."  The
 customary Prague presentation of this point has stipulated
 unequivocally that the FRG must join with Czechoslovakia in
 recognizing the agreement as invalid ab initio.  The implication
 if Bilak's more circuito'-.s presentation may be that Prague would
 cattle for a formula that would encompass the Czechoslovak
 Gov:rnment's unqualified position on the nonvalidity of the
 accord while permitting Bonn to declare the agreement invalid
 in such a way as to exempt or gloss over the period from
 September 1938 to March 1939, when Hitler's troops occupied
 Bohemia and Moravia.

 Czechoslovakia's inclination toward some kind of compromise
 that would enable the talks to move forward has seemed implicit
 in its comment since the third round of the talks on 27-28 September
 in Prague.  There has been a marked emphasis on Prague's interest
 in doing its part to reduce tensions in Europe in line with the
 CPSU's "peace program," and the normalization of relations with the
 FRG has been cited in this context.  Notably, at a Prague rally
 on 5 November marking the October Revolution anniversary, Premier
 Strougal prefaced remarks on Prague-Bonn relations with the
 statement that Czechoslovakia "is ready to contribute its share"
 to the Soviet peace program and went on to say, with respect to
 relations with Bonn, that "we are taking the necessary initiatives
 with the conviction that thereby peace and security in Europe will
 also be strengthened."  On the 11th TASS noted that Czechoslovak
 First Deputy Foreign Minister Krajcir had met that day with
 Gromyko in Moscow to discuss "questions of mutual concern."
 Krajcir's one-day trip to Moscow had not been announced in advance.
 Bilak in his speech on the 11th seemed to be seeking to assure
 West Germany that if the hurdle of agreement on the "fundamental"
 Munich agreement issue could be overcome, the talks could move
 ahead without difficulty.  "All the other existing problems are
 of a secondary nature," he said, in apparent allusion to Bonn's
 concern over possible Czechoslovak reparations demands as well as
 the myriad of legal issues surrounding the Sudeten German
 citizenship question.  A Radio Moscow commentary in German by
 "Soviet historian" Aleksandr Gal::in on 28 September, at the time
 of the third round of the Prague-Bonn talks, had directly
 discounted FRG concern on these counts:  Taking issue with
 the argument advanced in Bonin that the FRG must co-Lsider
 "possible legal consequences if the Munich agreement is
 declared invalid ab initio," Galkin pointed out that "the
 legal responsibility for the damage inflicted on the Czechoslovak
 Republic during the occupation has long since been apportioned
 by international accords on war criminals and b?; Czechoslovak
 laws which provide punishment for collaboration."*
 The notion that the FRG need have no concern about the "legal
 consequences" had also seemed implicit in Prague's modification
 of its long-standing formula that Bonn must recognize the Munich

 accord as invalid ab initio with "all the consequences arising
 therefrom."  The quoted concluding phrase was dropped in the
 communique on the 2 August Soviet bloc summit meeting in the
 Crimea, and subsequent Czechoslovak elite statements have
 repeated the formula without it.
 In his Presidium report to the CPCZ Central Committee plenum
 on 21 October, remarking that economic relations with Bonn
 were being pursued "without any serious disturbing moments,"
 Bilak noted that political relations were "developing on
 another level" and went on to call for FRG recognition of the
 Munich agreement as invalid ab initio.  The communique on the
 11-12 November visit of a GDR party-government delegation led
 by Honecker to Czechoslovakia registered the GDR1s support for
 the "Just" Czechoslovak demand regarding the Munich agreement.
 Winding up his remarks on relations with the FRG in his
 11 November election speech, Bilak expressed the conviction
 that "steps will be taken on the part of the FRG Government"
 at the forthcoming bilateral session "which will substantially
 advance the present talks."

 POLAND-USSR
 TOP LEADERS STRESS UNANIMITY ON EVE OF PZPR CONGRESS
 Without prior announcement, Soviet and Polish media on
 10 November reported the arrival that day in Moscow of Poland's
 Gierek and Jaroszewicz for "friendly" talks with their Soviet
 opposite members, Brezhnev and Kosygin.  Held some four weeks
 before the 6 December opening of the Sixth Congress of the
 Polish United Workers Party (PZPR), the meeting was duly
 publicized in PRAVDA and TRYBUNA LUDU on the 11th with a
 report--not designated a communique--on talks which "confirmed
 a complete unity of views" in an atmosphere of "cordiality,
 friendship, and fraternity."  The 1 November communique on
 Brezhnev's talks with Honecker in the GDR had included no
 reference to unity of views, although the Soviet and GDR
 leaders spoke of unanimity in their speeches that day.
 Radio Moscow on the 12th, reporting that a PZPR Politburo
 meeting had "fully endorsed the results of the visit,"
 noted an emphasis in Polish media both on "the complete
 coincidence of views . . . on all matters discussed"
 between the Polish and Soviet leaders and on "the truly
 inestimable importan:re" of Soviet bloc unity in light of
 "the cardinal shift toward international detente."
 This was Gie :k's third reported visit to the USSR this
 year:  With Premier Jaroszewicz, he made his first visit
 abroad as PZPR first secretary to Moscow in early January,
 when unity of views was also reported, and he took part in
 the rump meeting of Soviet bloc party leaders in the Crimea
 on 2 August.
 The 11 November report on the Moscow talks mentioned "a
 comradely exchange of opinions" on bilateral relations
 and "urgent" international topics--economic integration
 under CEMA, preparations for a European security conference,
 and "unity of action" of the socialist countries, the world
 communist movement, and "all anti-imperialist forces."
 Undoubtedly also discussed, but unmentioned in the report,
 was the internal matter of the impending Warsaw congress,

 which Brezhnev may he expected to attend.*      Advance propaganda
 indicates that the conclave will be attended by an unprecedentedly
 large proportion of younger delegates drawn from the urban
 proletariat who will he expecting further evidence of the change
 in style in the conduct of party affairs promised by the Gierek
 regime,  The new style is manifest, for example, in the use
 of the term "guidelines" to describe the congress directives
 which Gierek presented for adoption at the 4 September plenum
 of the PZPR.  Gierek stressed at the ilenum that the document
 was not "final" but was merely to serve as the basis for
 precongress discussion by the workers and party bodies.  Soviet
 media, in reporting the congress document, adhered to the
 orthodox term "directives."
 A Warsaw domestic service report on the 15th of a precongress
 party meeting in the Gdansk coastal area, where the riots
 broke out last December, exemplifies the Polish party leadership's
 concern to get across the idea that it has made good on its
 promises to the workers.  Gdansk Voivodship PZPR committee first
 secretary Karkoszka is reported to have insisted at the meeting
 that "the party has consolidated its bonds with the workers of
 the coastal area."  At the same time, he reminded the coastal
 workers of their "promise contained in the word 'pomozemy'
 [we will help] made during the meeting of comrades Gierek and
 Jaroszewicz with shipbuilders last January."
 In contrast to the regional first secretary's claim of
 successful "consolidation," a congress delegate from the Lenin
 Shipyard was quoted by the Gdansk domestic service, also on the
 15th, to the effect that the work of "regaining the workers'
 confidence in the party organization" was "not yet finished"
 and that "many comrades" were "somehow unable to grasp the essence
 of the seventh and eighth plenums" of the PZPR in December 1970
 and February 1971, respectively.  The delegate added a double-edged
 remark that "in our everyday work we assume that the sixth party
 congress will definitely and finally close the December events of
 last year."
 *  Brezhnev has attended virtually all the party congresses of
 Moscow's East European allies, including the Fifth PZPR Congress
 in November 1968, since taking over as CPSU leader in October
 1964.  A notable exception was the Romanian party congress in
 August 1969.

 TOPICS  IN BRIEF
 ARBATOV ON PRESIDENT'S USSR VISIT
 U.S. affairs specialist G.A. Arbatov's article in the November
 issue of the journal USA:      ECONOMICS, POLITICS, IDEOLOGY, the
 most authoritative comment to date to be pegged to the
 President's forthcoming Moscow visit, was signed to the press
 on 12 October--the day the announcement on the visit was
 released.   In the pattern of the 15 October Nekrasov article
 in PRAVDA and other comment, Arbatov's article defended the
 agreement on the visit as "another practical result" of
 So?riet efforts to implement the foreign policy program of the
 24th CPSU Congress, "a program fully in keeping" with
 principles of peaceful coexistence.
 With these prefatory remarks, Arbatov proceeded to recapitulate
 stock Soviet lines on U.S. Sbviet relations.  He deplored the
 existence of "influential" opponents of detente in the United
 States, and he outlined broad "problems whose solution would
 be in the interests" of both countries without damaging tl.e
 "legitimate interests" of others.  He identified these
 problems as prevp tion of a world thermonuclear war, the
 quest for a more ;table foundation for strengthening world
 peace and security, limitation of the arms race, and the
 broadening of trade and economic, scientific, and technical
 cooperation.  At the same time, Arbarov cautioned against
 expecting too much from the visit in light of the "complexity"
 of the relationship between the world's leading military
 powers.
 CCP-SPANISH CP MEETING
 In a notable show of flexibility in interparty relations paral-
 leling Peking's broadening diplomatic moves, the Chinese have
 disclosed the visit of a Spanish CP delegation headed by its
 general secretary, Santiago Carrillo.  According to NCNA on
 17 November, the delegation left "for Europe" the previous day
 after visiting Peking, Yenan, Canton, and Shanghai at the invi-
 tation of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship With
 Foreign Countries.  The Spanish CP's clandestine Radio Indepen-
 dent Spain, quoting the party organ VTNDO OBRERO, had reported
 on 28 October that the delegation was in China.

 Though the delegation was not invited by a party body, NCNA
 reported that it was received and entertained by Keng Piao,
 a central committee member and head of the CCP's international.
 liaison department.  NCNA made clear that the two parties hold
 divergent views, noting that Keng had "a frank conversation"
 with the delegation in which the two sides "expressed their
 respective stands and views."  It is nonetheless a significant
 sign of the times that Peking would publicize contacts with a
 West European party other than the ideologically subservient
 "Marxist-Leninist" parties.  A key to Peking's willingness is
 the well-known independence of Moscow demonstrated by the wing
 of the split Spanish CP led by Santiago Carrillo.
