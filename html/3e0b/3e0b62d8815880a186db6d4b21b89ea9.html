 LEBANON
 April 13, 1976
 There have been no additional Syrian troop movements to the Lebanese border
 area since the weekend. The major elements of three Syrian brigades are still along
 the border and remain in control of the Damascus-Beirut highway between the
 border and the road junction a few miles south of Zahlah.

 Israeli leaders are still avoiding public comment on the situation in Lebanon.
 Foreign Minister Allon refused to be drawn out on the subject at a special Knesset
 session yesterday, explaining that he felt it is extremely important to minimize
 public comment on Lebanon because of the critical nature of recent developments.
 The Israeli press has generally followed the government's lead and avoided
 dramatizing Syria's actions. Many commentators, however, are expressing misgivings
 about the government's restraint. An editorial in Israel's largest daily yesterday
 warned that if the government continues to tolerate the piecemeal introduction of
 Syrian troops into Lebanon, it will not be able to claim surprise as an excuse if Israel
 is suddenly faced with a Syrian-occupied Lebanon.
 Rumors yesterday of Syrian advances on Beirut caused some panic in the
 Lebanese capital and may have helped spark new fighting in the hotel district and in
 several other contested areas in the suburbs and the mountainous areas east of the
 city. Although the clashes have subsided, a wave of kidnapings-now a common
 ritual at the beginning of a new cease-fire agreement-has kept tensions high.
 Other areas of the country are relatively quiet. According to US embassy
 sources, the leader of the renegade Muslim army operating in the north around
 Tripoli is now cooperating with Syrian-controlled troops to "pacify" the area.
 Another rebel officer based in the south near Sidon is also reportedly cooperating
 with the Syrians. In the east, the Syrian troops that moved across the border over
 the weekend apparently have succeeded in lifting the leftist siege of the Christian
 city of Zahlah and are delivering much-needed food and fuel to Christian villages in
 the area.
 Officials close to President Franjiyah have told the embassy that Franjiyah will
 sign the amendment to the constitution providing for his departure before this

 The Soviet navy, meanwhile, continues to maintain a close watch on the US
 naval task force anchored southeast of Crete. The Soviets have four surface warships,
 some support ships, and probably several submarines in the area of the 11-shi  US
 force, which includes the aircraft carrier Saratoga.                                   25X1

 The rallies that have been held throughout China since April 8 to mark the
 dismissal of Teng Hsiao-ping and the appointment of Hua Kuo-feng as premier and
 as first vice chairman of the party have been well organized and orderly. The rallies
 seem designed to underline the contrast with the unruly demonstrations of April 5
 and to convey an image of popular support for the new personnel decisions.
 Participants in the rallies included several provincial officials who had not
 previously lent their public support to the campaign against Teng, as well as some
 who had themselves been under attack. Under the circumstances, it would be in the
 interest of these provincial leaders to dissociate themselves from Teng and to dispel
 any suspicion that they had been "colluding" with him. In any event, the prominent
 role they have taken at the rallies suggests they are not at present under serious
 political pressure and that the campaign against Teng will not spread to other
 political moderates. In fact, a Chinese official informed F_                I
 on April 10 that the minister of education, who had been under attack along with
 Teng since last autumn, had made a "satisfactory recantation" and that there would
 be no wide-scale reprisals against Teng supporters.
 Most of China's powerful regional military commanders, who had previously
 seemed to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, took part in the rallies. The Chinese news
 agency has reported numerous rallies involving military units in support of the
 decisions of April 7 at which high-level military figures spoke.
 There have been virtually no rallies of this sort since the Lin Piao "coup" of
 1971, and the sudden emergence of the military in a political connection suggests
 that prominent military figures may have played an important role in piecing
 together last week's apparent compromises. It is possible that political pressure
 against the military, a prominent feature of Chinese politics in the past several years,
 may now ease.
 In contrast to the public appearances of several moderate leaders in the
 provinces and some in Peking, China's leading leftists have not appeared since the
 announcement on Hua and Teng. Their absence further suggests that the party's left
 wing is not entirely satisfied with the outcome of the anti-Teng campaign.
 Despite the large provincial rallies, Teng's dismissal is probably no more
 popular in the provinces than was the campaign against him, which failed to generate
 much enthusiasm. The Chinese populace has undoubtedly been unsettled by the
 sudden leadership changes. Some Chinese officials abroad have also reacted to the
 personnel changes with uncertainty and concern, and a few have been unwilling to
 discuss the decisions.

 Given the signs of continued disunity at the top, Hua Kuo-feng's ability to head
 a leadership coalition effectively remains in question. He does not appear to have a
 power base of his own other than the relatively narrow one of the public security
 apparatus, which has until recently been largely ineffective and disorganized. As a
 relative newcomer to the highest levels of the regime, Hua lacks the experience and
 many long-standing ties to important second-level figures that both Chou En-lai and
 Teng Hsiao-ping possessed. Although Hua's political roots are in Hunan, Mao's home
 province, there is no evidence that he is personally close to the Chairman.
 The leadership clearly needs a mediator like Chou En-lai to bring the various
 factions together, but it is far from certain that Hua can function effectively in that
 capacity. Others in the leadership, notably leftist Politburo members Chang
 Chun-chiao and Wang Hung-wen, may have had their eye on one or the other of
 Hua's new jobs and may harbor some resentment toward him. Hua can probably
 count on the cooperation of moderates in the leadership for implementation of
 policies, but he will have to tread a careful path between pursuing relatively
 moderate policies and giving sufficient weight to the left's interest in the political
 struggle.
 Hua's ability to survive the twists and turns of the cultural revolution in his
 home province a decade ago indicates that he has some experience in playing this
 political game at the provincial level. At the national level, however, the stakes are
 much higher, and Hua is as yet untried.

 Italy continues to drift toward an early parliamentary election. All party
 leaders are trying to avoid responsibility for triggering the contest, and debate now
 appears to focus more on how to precipitate the election than on how to avoid it.
 A series of party strategy sessions and the resumption of parliamentary activity
 this week will probably move the situation into a decisive phase.
 The Socialist directorate is meeting today to discuss the party's next move. The
 Socialists have been pushing for either an election or the replacement of Prime
 Minister Moro's Christian Democratic cabinet with an emergency government that
 would negotiate its economic program with the Communists. Since the rejection of
 the emergency formula by the Christian Democrats last week, Socialist chief De
 Martino has welcomed the prospect of an election but remained reluctant to open
 his party to blame by toppling the Moro government.
 A Socialist decision to abandon Moro could come today, but the party will
 probably await the outcome of a meeting tomorrow of the Christian Democratic
 national council.
 The Christian Democrats are divided over their next step. The party's
 center-right leaders-who generally see more advantages than disadvantages in an
 early election-are reportedly recommending that Moro resign. They believe his
 resignation might increase their chances of installing a conservative as caretaker
 prime minister during the pre-election period.
 The Christian Democratic left-led by Moro and party chief Zaccagnini-want
 to schedule a parliamentary confidence vote on the government's economic
 program. These Christian Democrats-who still hope to avoid or at least to postpone
 an election-argue that such a vote would call the Socialists' bluff, forcing them
 either to abandon their threat or accept responsibility for the government's fall.
 Parliament seems likely to approve in the next few days a Socialist-sponsored
 bill that would reduce the preparatory period for the national election from 70 days
 to 45. Passage of the bill would weaken the argument of politicians who oppose an
 election on the grounds that the country cannot afford the lengthy period of
 governmental paralysis that usually accompanies a campaign.
 For his part, Communist leader Berlinguer continues to maintain that the
 Christian Democrats are responsible for the current impasse because they refused to
 Approved For Releas
 Approved For Relea
 National Intelligence Bulletin                 April 13, 1976
 accept his offer to cooperate in dealing with the country's problems. Berlinguer is
 likely to stress this theme in any election campaign.
 The economy continues to reflect the deteriorating political situation. The lira,
 which plunged to a record low of 898 against the dollar yesterday, will remain weak
 as long as political uncertainties persist. Inflation is running at an annual rate of 30
 percent, and additional price hikes can be expected as the sharp depreciation of the
 lira continues to boost: the cost of foreign goods. These problems drove the Italian
 stock market to a record low yesterday. Italy's trade deficit in February was the
 worst in any month since 1974, and the gap might widen in coming months when
 the need to restock inventories will spark import purchases.
 Moro's proposed austerity program has soured the government's relations with
 Italy's powerful labor unions. The government made no progress in an emergency
 meeting last week designed to encourage labor restraint in the current wage
 negotiations.

 The selection of a new Turkish air force commander is exposing differences
 within the military leadership and the government that the opposition is attempting
 to exploit.
 The debate was touched off in early March when air force chief Alpkaya
 resigned, following allegations that he had received bribes from an Italian aircraft
 company. General Staff chief Sancar reportedly recommended the next ranking air
 force general, Irfan Ozaydinli, for the top post. Prime Minister Demirel, however,
 vetoed Ozaydinli's appointment naming instead the number-three man, General
 Cemal Engin, as acting chief.
 Demirel's motives, in fact, probably are political, as the opposition charges. He
 takes a dim view of Ozaydinli's reported support of the opposition Republican
 People's Party and his ties to a former air force commander instrumental in forcing
 Demirel from power in 1971. National Salvation Party leader Erbakan, who holds
 the balance of power in Demirel's coalition government, is also thought to oppose
 Ozaydinli's elevation because, as a martial law commander between 1971 and 1973,
 Ozaydinli allegedly cracked down on Erbakan's supporters for their outspoken
 religious views.
 Opposition leader Ecevit during recent months has attempted to oust Demirel
 over a variety of issues. Last week he publicly charged Demirel with unwarranted
 interjection of politics into the military. Ecevit doubtless hopes that this time he has
 found an issue he can effectively exploit to weaken Demirel.
 Ecevit's charges were buttressed last week when one of Demirel's minor
 coalition partners announced that he would not accept any further delay in the
 appointment of an air force chief.
 Having fended off Ecevit's earlier attempts to unseat him, Demirel seems to be
 confident he can do it again. He appears to believe that his negotiation of a new
 defense pact with the US has left him with a reservoir of good will with the military
 that he can draw on in holding out against Ozaydinli. He no doubt is also aware that
 the military leadership is prevented from speaking with one voice by a division
 between those-such as Ozaydinli-who favor a more active political role for the
 military and those who do not.

 Whatever the outcome of the Ozaydinli case, it is likely to have continuing
 political implications.. If he is finally appointed, Ozaydinli will bring to the highest
 levels of military leadership a penchant for political involvement not presently there.
 If he is not appointed, the matter is likely to remain as yet another irritant in an
 already unstable political situation.
 Perhaps more important is the possibility that the intrigue and string-pulling
 involved in Ozaydinli's case could further alienate junior and middle-level officers,

 Firm  countermeasures by  Cypriot  police prevented anti-American
 demonstrators in Nicosia yesterday from penetrating the US embassy grounds.
 Some of the 1,000 demonstrators succeeded in penetrating two of the three
 outer protective barriers, but they were eventually forced back by the police, who
 used tear gas to disperse the crowd. There were some injuries on both sides.
 A five-man delegation was subsequently allowed to deliver a letter to the
 embassy protesting the new US-Turkish Defense Cooperation Agreement and its
 alleged consequences for Cyprus. The delegation left quietly when it was informed
 that Greek Foreign Minister Bitsios had just departed for Washington to discuss
 additional military assistance for Greece. The announcement of Bitsios' visit could
 lead to a cancellation of follow-up demonstrations set for the coming days and
 weeks.
 US embassy officials in Nicosia attributed the Cypriots' firm handling of the
 demonstration to strong warnings by the US, which were fully supported by the
 Greek government in Athens.

 SPAIN
 Basque terrorists may have seriously misjudged the reaction to their recently
 intensified campaign of violence in the troubled northern provinces of Spain.
 The murder last Thursday of a kidnaped industrialist by terrorists of the
 Basque Fatherland and Liberty organization has provoked a widespread outcry
 throughout Spain, and particularly in the Basque region. The Christian Democratic -
 oriented Basque Nationalist Party, which probably represents the majority of the
 Basque population, called the murder a setback for Basque autonomy. The Basque
 Nationalists have never before spoken out against terrorist violence.
 A further indication that the terrorists may have tarnished the Robin Hood
 image that had won for them at least the passive support of a large segment of
 Basques was the funeral service for the murdered industrialist; some 15,000 turned
 out in a massive outpouring of public disapproval of the terrorists' actions.
 Police have carried out large-scale raids in and around the city of San Sebastian
 since last Thursday, when the kidnaped industrialist's body was found. Last night
 the government announced that three of the four accused murderers had been
 arrested along with 84 other persons charged with being members of the Basque
 Fatherland and Liberty terrorist group.
 The Basque terrorist cause may have been dealt yet another blow by the recent
 disappearance of two Spanish policemen in the French border town of Hendaye.
 Basque Fatherland and Liberty is believed involved, although until now the
 organization has avoided carrying out operations on the French side of the border
 for fear of stirring up the French authorities and endangering the Spanish Basque
 apparatus in France.

 USSR-EGYPT-CHINA
 Press reports from Cairo that a senior Egyptian delegation will soon travel to
 Peking to discuss military and economic cooperation have evoked one of Moscow's
 harshest reactions since President Sadat's announcement on March 14 of his
 intention to abrogate the Soviet-Egyptian friendship treaty.
 I n a Pravda commentary on Saturday, Moscow gave a pointed defense of Soviet
 activities in Egypt. The article avoids direct threats against Egypt, but it notes that
 Cairo's defensive effort during the October war in 1973, "of which the Egyptian
 leadership is so proud," was achieved as a result of Soviet arms supplies and
 technical assistance.
 Because of what Pravda describes as Peking's well-known support for any
 anti-Soviet activity, it says it is natural for China to develop a sympathetic attitude
 toward Egypt at a time when Moscow is being attacked by much of the Cairo press.
 The  article  notes that  Egyptian journalists have distorted the facts of
 Soviet-Egyptian cooperation, a relationship which has always been to the benefit of
 the Egyptian people. In the most explicit appeal to the Egyptian domestic
 opposition thus far, the article claims that "essentially patriotic forces" in the
 country oppose the "subversion" of friendly Soviet-Egyptian ties and that only
 "international imperialism" and certain "Egyptian bourgeois circles" can gain from
 Cairo's present policy.
 Foreign Minister Fahmi announced on Sunday that Cairo's mission to Peking
 will be headed by Vice President Mubarak. Fahmi, who is in Vienna accompanying
 President Sadat on his European tour, did not indicate the date of the visit. The
 Western press quoted him to the effect that the China trip was the result of an
 exchange of messages between Sadat and Chairman Mao. At the same time, Cairo's
 information minister described the events as a "new phase" in Sino-Egyptian
 relations, and other Egyptian officials claimed that Peking has agreed to furnish
 spare parts for Soviet military equipment and Soviet-supplied industrial machinery.
 The prospect that Peking may use the current impasse in Soviet-Egyptian
 relations to improve its ties with Cairo is undoubtedly an unsettling thought for the
 USSR. Although it is doubtful the Chinese can offer assistance of any real
 significance, the symbolic importance, at least of the upcoming Egyptian visit, seems
 likely to produce an increasing flow of anti-Sadat rhetoric from Moscow.

 Two of Moscow's most prominent Jewish activists have told the US embassy of
 the "shock and concern" felt by Soviet Jews over the demonstrations and violence
 directed by Jewish extremists at the Soviet UN mission in New York.
 Both men said they have tried to communicate through Western newsmen in
 Moscow the "revulsion" that Soviet Jews feel at this kind of activity, believing it to
 be wholly inimical to their cause. One of the activists said he was "dismayed" to
 learn that he is among those whose cases are championed by the so-called Jewish
 Armed Resistance.
 The two dissidents agreed that the events in New York could result in more
 official intransigence than ever toward all would-be Jewish emigrants, as well as
 activists like themselves, who have been repeatedly denied exit permits. They said
 that, at the very least, the violence would reinforce latent anti-Semitism found at
 most levels of the Soviet bureaucracy, especially in the provinces where officials are
 under less compunction to mask their prejudices.
 The activists expressed particular concern lest a Soviet child become a shooting
 victim in New York. In their view, the violence up to now-shooting apart-was
 something the Soviet government "could understand and cope with," but physical
 harm to a Soviet child would evoke a genuine sense of outrage among all Soviet
 citizens.
 These sentiments appear to be widespread, especially among the top layer of
 educated, articulate activists, who are subject more than others to the arbitrariness
 of the bureaucracy. Their statements also recall the fears expressed by many activists
 last January that the bomb incidents in New York, which coincided with the UN
 debate on the Middle East, could lead to Soviet moves against Jews in the USSR on
 the grounds of "security."

 South Yemeni Foreign Minister Muti has visited Bahrain, Qatar, and the United
 Arab Emirates over the last 10 days to discuss economic assistance and the
 establishment of diplomatic relations. Muti also visited Kuwait, with which Aden
 already has diplomatic ties.
 Since its announcement on March 10 of an agreement to normalize relations
 with Saudi Arabia, Aden has moved toward normalizing its ties with the other Arab
 states of the Persian Gulf. The rapprochement between Riyadh and Aden received
 wide approval during Saudi King Khalid's recent visit to the Gulf states, and South
 Yemen is probably trying to capitalize on this support.
 Muti's hosts were generally noncommittal about the possibility of providing
 aid. They presumably will follow the Saudi example of moving slowly both in
 extending economic aid to Aden and in actually establishing embassies. The possible
 exception is Bahrain, since it has no funds to spare and feels that recognition of
 South Yemen already exists, inasmuch as both countries are members of the Arab
 League. Saudi Arabia's actions remain the key, and Riyadh is carefully monitoring
 South Yemeni intentions before it initiates any further steps toward normalization.
 Although the Saudis have reportedly agreed to provide some economic aid as
 part of normalization, Aden would like further to diversify its sources of assistance.
 Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates could be primary sources for funds to
 develop Aden's mineral and oil resources and to support other developmental
 projects.
 For Aden, rapprochement with Saudi Arabia is a major turning point in its
 foreign  policy. South  Yemen's Marxist government opposes the vestiges of
 colonialism and the traditional tribally based oligarchies found in other countries of
 the Arabian Peninsula. This image has prevented Aden from receiving any substantial
 economic assistance from the more moderate Arab countries. Although South
 Yemen will probably temper its Marxist rhetoric, it will probably remain covertly
 committed to subversion.
