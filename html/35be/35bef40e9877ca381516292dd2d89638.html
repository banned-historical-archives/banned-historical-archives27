Tasking Plan. To enhance the analysis of readout on operationally associated targets, each target is reported relative to its primary functional 
association (i.e., missile range tracking facilities are reported under "MISSILE RANGES," fly-away airfields at aircraft plants are reported 
under "INDUSTRY," airfield nuclear weapons storage facilities are reported under "AIR," etc.).
