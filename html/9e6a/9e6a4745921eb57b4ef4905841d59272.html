 7 MARCH 1973
 INDOCHINA
 Hanoi and other communist media have hailed the international
 conference in Paris and the signing of the nine-article conference
 act on 2 March as putting an international stamp of approval on
 the Vietnam peace agreement.  Stress was on the success of the
 conference, and there was little attention to such discordant
 notes as the controversy over Saigon's attempt to issue a statement
 on the exclusive legitimacy of the GVN in South Vietnam.  Sino-
 Soviet antagonisms were for the most part obscured in propaganda
 on the conference, although Peking's NCNA, in noting Gromyko's
 remarks on Asian collective security, seemed to be reflecting
 pique over Moscow's campaign touting this project it the wake of
 the Vietnam settlement.
 Hanoi has continued to obscure the U.S.-ARV controversy over the
 release of U.S. POW's which held up work at the international
 conference for a day, but it has continued to profess concern
 over alleged U.S. as well as GVN violations of the provisions of
 the peace accord.  A 1 March NHAN DAN editorial went beyond other
 propaganda when it said the United Mates had made "private
 commitments" to see that the accord is properly implemented.
 And an editorial in the paper on the 6th, without referring to
 any private commitments, complained that the United States has
 not sufficiently carried out its responsibilities concerning GVN
 responsibilities on the issue of military and civilian prisoners.
 DRV. PRG ASSAIL GVN AND U.S, ON PRISONER RELEASE. WITHDRAWAL
 Just as Hanoi did not report the 21 February threat by a DRV spokes-
 man in Saigcn that the release of U.S. POW's might be held up if
 there were not strict compliance with the peace agreement by the
 GVN as well as the United States, so it failed to acknowledge that
 the work of the international conference was held up last week
 while Secretary Rogers, at President Nixon's instruction, sought
 and obtained assurance that the DRV would release U.S. POW's within
 the 60-day period provided in the peace agreement.  VNA reported
 on 1 March that a meeting had been held in Paris the day before
 by Secretary Rogers and the foreign ministers of the three
 Vietnamese parties to the peace agreement "following very grave
 violations of the Paris agreement in South Vietnam" and that
 "strict implementation" of the aCreement was discussed.  However,
 Vietnamese communist media are not known to have reported the

 subsequent bilateral meeting at which Secretary Rngers--as he
 said at his 2 March Paris press conference--was assured by DRV
 Foreign Minister Nguyen Duy Trinh that the U.S. POW's would
 be released by Hanoi in four phases in accordance with the
 peace agreement.
 Hanoi's closest approach to a discussion of the controversy
 came in an article in the 1 March QUAN DOI KHAN LAN which scored
 the White House for "raising a hue and cry" about DRV violations
 and for "claiming that Hanoi must be held responsible for the
 delay in handing over U.S. military personnel."  The White House
 statements, not further described, were dismissed by the army
 paper as "a very brazen slander."  The article claimed that the
 DRV hr.d correctly implemented the peace agreement while "the
 U.S. and Saigon sides have blatantly and systematically sabotaged
 the most important and most urgent provisions of the agreement."
 Also on 1 March, a KHAN DAN editorial went beyond Vietnamese
 communist demands that the United States should help assure
 Saigon's implementation of the peace agreement to suggest tha`
 there were in fact secret understandings regarding U.S.
 responsibilitiej in the postwar period.  Declaring that the
 United States had signed the peace agreement and set forth
 "private commitments [cam keets rieeng] on a number of problems,"
 the editorial claimed that the United States has shown that "it
 has not attached much importance to its signatures and
 commitments."
 An indication that the Vietnamese communists expected the United
 States to assume special responsibility regarding implementation
 of peace accord provisions on civilian prisoners had appeared in
 an interview which DRV chief delegate to the Paris talks Xuan
 Thuy held with AFP on 10 November 1972.  Hanoi media did not
 carry the interview, but as reported by AFP Xuan Thuy explained
 that the DRV had agreed to separate the issues of the release r!
 POW's and Vietnamese civilian prisoners and said that the United
 States "should use its influence with the Saigon administration
 to urge it" to implement the clause on the detained civilians.
 There has been no repetition of the 1 March editorial's
 explicit reference to "private" U.S. commitments, and the
 propaganda for the most part has reverted to general charges that
 the United States has abetted violations of the accord.  However,
 the 6 March NHAN DAN editorial said that "adequate attention" must
 be given to the issue of civilian prisoners and complained that

 "in the past month and more, the United States has not correctly
 and actively .-arried out its responsibilities" concerning the
 problem of military and civilian prisoners.
 DEADLOCK ON            While the controversy between Hanoi and
 VIETNAMESE POW'S       Washington on the release of American POW's
 appeared to have been settled, Hanoi and
 Front media reported on the 6th that the four-party Joint Military
 Commission (JMC) on the previous day had reached a deadlock on
 the question of Saigon's return of Vietnamese prisoners of war.
 Liberation Radio noted the communist objection to the low figure
 on prisoners Saigon had proposed to return in the second phase of
 the Vietnamese POW exchange and said that even the United States
 "had to admit that each side had to retu.?n at least one fourth of
 the total number of personnel registered on the namelist."  The
 deputy head of the PRG delegation, Dang Van Thu. was quoted as
 warning that Saigon must take steps to avoid prolonging the delay
 in the prisoner exchange because otherwise future exchanges will
 be adversely affected.  He also declared that the PRG would not
 discuss other problems if the return of the second group of POW's
 was not solved satisfactorily.  Thu was quoted-as "demanding that
 the U.S. delegate shoulder responsibility for implementing all
 articles of the Paris agreement" and as "stressing that he should
 not be obsessed only with receiving U.S. military personnel, while
 at the same time condoning the Saigon administration's stubborn
 attitude and refusal to return PRG military personnel."
 WITHDRAWAL OF     Communist complaints about the implementation of
 U.S. TROOPS       provisions on the withdrawal of U.S. troops were
 spelled out in a 1 March statement by the PRG
 delegation to the four-party :AMC.  The statement charged that the
 United States had refused to discuss the modalities for troop
 withdrawal and that the JMC and International Commission for
 Control and Supervision (ICCS) had been unable to supervise the
 withdrawal of foreign troops.  It maintained that U.S. communiques
 on troop withdrawals are "unacceptable" because the withdrawals
 were unsupervised and "there is no practical or legal basis to
 confirm how many troops the United States has withdrawn and
 whether the withdrawing tro-.;ps have taker, with them all arms,
 munitions, and war means as provided for in Article 8" of the
 cease-fire protocol.  The statement rejected the contention, in a
 25 February note from the U.S. delegation, that the United States
 was correctly implementing the provisions on withdrawal.  It
 accused the United States of attempting to "cover up its secret
 maintenance in South Vietnam of disguised military personnel as

 7 MARCH 1973
 well as the illegal transfer of arms, munitions, and war means
 to the republic of South Vietnam."  Condemning such "tricks,"
 the statement demanded that the United States give proof to the
 JMC and ICCS of the number of troops withdrawn and of the
 removal of their weapons and that it ensure effective control
 by the control organizations over future withdrawals.
 In the pattern of propaganda beginning in mid-February which
 made specific charges of alleged U.S. violations, a NHAN DAN
 editorial on 5 March again claimed that the United States iias
 not carried out the provision on troop withdrawal "undk.r due
 supervision and control," that it has evaded the dismantling
 of U.S. bases, and that it has not "strictly and quickly"
 implemented the protocol on removal and deactivation of mines
 in North Vietnam.
 MOVEMENT OF SAM'S     Hanoi and Front accounts of the 28 February
 INTO QUANG TRI        session of the JMC noted that PRG representa-
 tive Dang Van Thu rejected allied charges
 that the communists had installed SA-2 missile sites at the Sanh,
 Quang Tri Province, since the start of the cease-fire.  Thu
 reportedly recalled that PRG delegation head Tran Van Tra, at
 the previous session of the commission, had stated the PRG
 position that "there has been absolutely no movement of missiles
 or technical weapons since the time the agreement came into
 effect."  Thu added that "nobody has the right to ask the PRG
 to withdraw any of its units from the area under its control."
 He was also said to have "served notice" on the U.S. delegate in
 connection with the latter's "threat to use violence against the
 area controlled by the PRG"--an evident allusion to General
 Woodward's statement at the 28 February JMC meeting that if the
 communists failed to move the missiles the United States and its
 allies would reserve the right to take appropriate actions.
 DRV MINISTRY SPOKESMAN CHARGES REMOVAL OF U.S, MINES DELAYED
 Hanoi's policy of avoiding discussion of the prisoner-release
 controversy was also evident in propaganda related to U.S. mine
 clearance.  On 1 Ma-,ch a statement by the DFV Foreign Ministry
 spokesman, release! at a Hanoi press conference, charged that
 no mines had been cleared and maintained that the United States
 has "deliberately violated the spirit and letter of the protocol"
 on mine removal.  At the press conference, Major Pham Lam, a
 member of the DRV delegation on the problem of the mines,

 CONFIDENTIAL           FBIS TRENDS

 criticized the alleged U.S. delay in some detail, among other
 things noting, without elaboration, that scheduled operations
 did rot begin on 26 and 27 February and that on the 28th U.S.
 personnel returned to their ships, which withdrew from their
 positions near the coast.  Thus, consistent with Hanoi's
 silence on the controversy over POW's, Pham Lam obicured the
 fact that the suspension of preparations for clearing the mines
 at that time was related to Hanoi's delay in releasing the
 second group of American POW's.  On 4 March a brief VNA item
 recalled the 1 March foreign ministry spokesman's protest and
 noted, again without further explanation, that on the 4th U.S.
 representatives and the U.S. fleet assigned to clear mines had
 returned to the Haiphong area.
 Pham Lam complained about various alleged U.S. interpretations
 of the accord:  He criticized the position that delayed-action
 bombs would not have to be (''pared since they were not mines,
 and he assailed the view that mines need only be cleared from
 the central channel of rivers and not from one bank to the other.
 The latter point elaborates on cryptic references in the foreign
 ministry spokesman's statement as well as in the 26 February
 DRV Government statement that the United States was trying to
 evade responsibility for clearing mines on the inland waterways.
 Pharr Lam also complained about U.S. failure to provide equipment
 to th_~ DRV, noting that North Vietnam had been given no means
 to transport five-ton "pipes" which were to be used to destroy
 mines.  And he took the United States to task for failing to supply
 the means for removing mines on the grounds that the U.S. Navy does
 not have such equipment.
 The issue of mine clearance continued to be pressed in :omment on
 the 2d with an article in QUAN DOI NHAN DAN, for example, accusing
 the United States of "nurturing the dark scheme of continuing
 the blockade of the sea entries of the DRV in an attempt to
 prevent transport between our country and others and to isolate
 North Vietnam."
 PARIS 12-NATION"! CONFERENCE LAUDED FOR ENDORSING PEACE ACCORD
 HANOI     DRV propaganda, highlighted by a 3 March NHAN DAN editorial,
 greeted the 2 March signing of the act of the international
 conference on Vietnam as a great victory for the Vietnamese people
 and for world peace.  Underlining Hanoi's satisfactic-., a report
 from the Paris correspondent Hong Ha, published in NHAN DAN on the

 4th, claimed that the act "contains nearly all the contents"
 of a draft act proposed by the DRV delegation "with the
 agreement of the PRG delegation."  The editorial on the 3d set
 the tone for other comment when it maintained that the act had
 "increased the juridical value on the international arena" of
 the peace agreement and had provided a "new political and
 juridical basis" for the struggle to make the United States and
 Saigon respect and implement the accord.
 The NHAN DAN editorial. also credited the act with affirming the
 "important position and great prestige'of the DRV and PRG and the
 "powerful support" of the socialist countries for Vietnam.  The
 controversy at the conference over the PRG's position was
 reflected in Hong Ha's report on the 4th, which noted GVN Foreign
 Minister Lam's attempt at the 1 March meeting to have his
 statement on the exclusive legitimacy of the GVN be made an
 official document of the conference; the report also quoted
 Gromyko's objections to the proposal.
 Hanoi's reports on the conference had taken note of PRG Foreign
 Minister Binh's meetings with other delegates, including UN
 Secretary General Waldheim.  However, it was not until 7 March
 that Hanoi radio carried a more detailed report on "meetings
 and an  exchange of views" between Waldheim and Binh, noting for
 the first time that the Secretary General had confirmed that they
 had discussed the PRG's establishment of a liaison office and
 designation of observers at the United Nations.
 The 3 March NHAN DAN editorial, like other propaganda, decried
 alleged U.S. and Saigon violations of the peace accord and
 warned:  "These acts pose a great danger to the Paris agreement . . .
 and have, in a dangerous manner, increased the tension in Vietnam
 and Indochina as a whole."  In a similar vein, DRV Foreign
 Minister Nguyen Duy Trinh had warned of the dangers to peace in
 his press conference statement at the close of the international
 conference.  Trinh maintained that "Vietnam's experience since the
 1940's has proved that foreign military involvement and interference
 and domestic fascism in the service of neocolonialism are the origin
 of war."  He went on to advo:?re an  end to such policies, the
 achievement of reconciliation and concord, and respect for
 scif-determination in South Vietnam, warning that "only in this way
 can pence in Vietnam be maintained and consolidated.  Otherwise,
 violations will grow from small-scale hostilities to major conflicts,
 and peace will be wrecked. . . ."

 7 MARCH 1973
 The Chinese have authoritatively endorsed the results
 of the Paris conference as providing an "explicit
 international guarantee" for the "fundamental national rights
 of the Vietnamese people" acknowledged in the 27 January peace
 agreement.  The basic thrust of the brief speech by Foreign
 Minister Chi Peng-fei   at the find session of the conference
 on 2 March and a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial the next day was that
 primary responsibility for implementing the Vietnam settlement
 tests with the four signatories  and that the other parties
 represented at the international conference have now committed
 themselves to respect the settlement.  This approach accords
 with Peking's welcome for the agreement as removing a major
 source of tension in Asia.
 Peking's coverage of the conference proceedings included the
 text of the  act,  texts of the speeches by the Vietnamese
 communist delegates, and reports on Chi's meeting with Secretary
 Rogers on 25 February and his dinner for the Secretary on
 1 March.  Peking's accounts of speeches by-other delegates were
 generally straightforward except for the South Vietnamese and
 Soviet foreign ministers.  NCNA dc:fsively observed that "while
 presenting no positive views" on the issues, Gromyko had
 "boasted" that the Paris agreement had proven the effectiveness
 of what Moscow calls its peace program.  Most notably, NCNA took
 the opportunity to respond to Moscow's campaign touting its
 Asian collective security project in the wake of the Vietnam
 settlement  Ac:ording to NCNA, Gromyko sought to bring the
 Indochina situation "into the orbit of that 'collective
 security system."'  (During the period when it adamantly opposed
 negotiations on Vietnam, Peking had repeatedly charged that
 Moscow was seeking to bring the Vietnam question into the orbit
 of Soviet-U.S. cooperation.)  Turning Moscow's language back
 against it, NCNA observed that the Asian collective security
 system "is none Lther than a 'policy of grouping, a policy of
 ranging some states against others."'
 Peking did not indicate  that Chi joined in the criticism of GVN
 Foreign Minister lam at the 1 March session for pressing the
 notion that his government is the only legitimate one in South
 Vietnam.  However, Chi apparently was alc.ie in delivering a
 formal speech at the final session on the 2d.  Alluding to the
 contention over the PRG's status, he complained that "certain
 people" still want to deny its existence.  And apparently as a
 fur%he: demonstration of support for the PRG, he went on to
 specify that "the Saigon authorities" have been creating serious

 incidents, taking particular note of attacks on the communist
 delegations to the JMC.     In his main address at the conference
 nn 26 February he had observed ;.hat violations of the agreement
 had occurred but did not blame particular parties.
 The PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on the conference included the
 United States in its indictment of -violations of the agreement,
 though it singled out "the Saigon authorities in particular."
 Earlier, a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on 1 ::a,:ch--seconding PRG
 and DRV protest statements of 25 and 26 February--spelled out
 charges against Saigon and added that the United States had
 delayed the removal of mines in North Vietnam and refused to
 dismantle its military bases in the South.  The editorial noted
 cryptically that these acts not only violated the relevant
 provisions of the agreement "but also made it difficult to
 implement other important provisions."
 Reflecting Peking's interest in the tttuation, the 1 March
 editorial asF"rted that strict imple?.rentation of the agreement
 would contribute to the maintenance of peace in Southeast Asia.
 In  his context it pointed out, rather cautiously, that "people
 cannot but show concern" over violations of the agreement.
 MOSCOW     Moscow media's reporting of the closing events of the
 international conference included Foreign Minister
 Gromyko's departure statement on 3 March.  He expressed hope
 that all the parties would "observe strictly and punctually" the
 provisions of the Paris agreement as well as the act signed at
 the conference, a document which he said has "great positive
 significance.   The Moscow press published the text of the act
 promptly on the 3d, but there is little available independent Soviet
 comment.  The TASS press review on the 5th reported that IZVESTIYA
 expressed hope that the conf?rence decisions would serve the cause
 of "the establishment of lasting peace"; the paper stressed
 "editorially," TASS added, that "it is necessary to exclude any
 possibility of the resumption of interference in whatever form
 in the internal affairs of Vietnam."
 Moscow promptly took issue with Peking's account of Gromyko's
 speech* at the Paris conference in a Mandarin-language broadcast
 *  Although Hanoi media reported that Gromyko had participated in
 the criticism of GVN Foreign Minister Lam at the 1 March session,
 Moscow is not known to have reported Gromyko's remarks.  A dispatch
 published in PRAVDA on the 2d, reporting DRV spokesman Nguyen Thanh
 Le's press conference on the session, quoted Le as saying only that
 Lam's claim of sole legitimacy for the GVN was rejected by the
 "other delegates."

 on the 2d which claimed that Peking "slandered" and iauncned an
 "unbridled attack" on Gromyko's statement.  Moscow argued that
 Gromyko's remarks renewing the Soviet proposal for a collective
 security system in Aoia were "completely it order" ant would
 "remove the basis for forming any kind of alliance and for any
 imperialist intervention."  Echoing othpt recent Soviet
 propaganda in the weeks since the pea-a agreement was signed,
 the broadcast went on to charge that Peking's policy is aimed
 at forming a temporary alliance with "the imperialist bloc" and
 not objeczfag to the retention of U.S. armed forces in Asia.
 The notion of U.S.-PRC "collusion" has contirjed to be expressed
 in other Moscow propaganda.  vor example, an item in PRAVDA on
 4 March reiterated that the PRC takes an "indulgent attitude"
 toward the fact that although the Vietnam war has ended, the U.S.
 military presence in that part nf the world "is not being
 reduced."

 KHARTOUM EVENTS
 USSR CONVEYS DISAPPROVAL OF PALESTINIANS' "SENSELESS CRIME`'
 Moscow has again conveyed its disapproval of terror tactics in
 reportage on the 1 March seizure of the Saudi Arabian embassy
 in Khartoum by members of this Palestinian Black September
 Organization (BSO) and their killing of three of the five
 diplomatic hostages the following day.  In keeping with the
 guarded Soviet trer;tment of pant terrorist incidents, Moscow's
 reaction has been :onfined to brief media reports of events
 surrounding the se:lzure of the embassy and the deaths of incoming
 U.S. Ambassador NoA.1l, outgoing U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission Moore,
 and Bel.eian Charge ?i'Affaires Eid.
 Press comment thus far has been limited to brief "reference
 information" on the BSO appearing in PRAVDA on 4 March, appended
 to five short TASS dispatches.  In apparent effort to transfer
 at least some of the opprobrium from the Palestinian organizations,
 PRAVDA referred cryptically to "certain facts" suggesting ties
 between Black September and "certain extremist non--Palestinian
 organizations."  It recalled the BSO's responsibility for aircraft
 hijackings as well as for the "attacks" on athletes at the Munich
 Olympics and on embassies in Bangkok and Khartoum "and a Cairo
 hotel"--an allusion to the assassination of the Jordanian prime
 minister in Cairo in November 1971.  At the time Moscow all but
 ignored the assassination, which was acknowledged only in a one-
 senterce TASS report from Cairo that at-Tall "was killed today"
 at t'  entrance to the Sheraton Hotel.
 PRAVDA's "reference information" was repeated without attribution
 in a Moscow broadcast to Britain on the 4th which also remarked
 that the BSJ "unites a few extreme groupings of Palestinians."
 Echoing a past theme of Soviet comment on terrorist activities,
 the PRAVDA information note added that "numerous representatives
 of the Arab public" consider such actions "tremendously damaging
 both to the Palestine Liberation Organization and to the Arab
 countries' common struggle against the consequences of Israel's
 aggression."  A Moscow domestic  service broadcast on 5 March
 similarly called the terrorists' action a "senseless crime"
 which did "immeasurable harm" to the national libera'Zion movement.
 Noising that "bourgeois news agencies" had already forgotten
 Israel's downing of the Libyan airliner, the broadcast claimed

 that the reaction of "Western ptvpagandists" showed who benefited
 from such te.rorist actiono &q that in Sudan.  The broadcast
 said it was impossible not to agree -aith the Cairo AL-AHRAM, which
 editorially called the attack on the embassy and the killing of
 three Western diplomats a blow to the Acab people's struggle
 against "Israeli aggression."
 While TASS' initial two-sentence report on 1 March said "Palestinian
 partisans" were holding the American ambassador and other diplomats
 hostage in Khartoum, subsequent reporr.ago has almost uniformly
 described the perpetrators as members of the "terrorist" Black
 September.  There has baen no comment on the incident in Moscow's
 broadcasts to Arab audiences, but programs on 3 and 4 March briefly
 reported developments, again ascribing the events to this "extremist"
 or "terroristic" organization.  A 5 Mer,h broadcast in Arabic
 said that PRAVDA and SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, reporting the BSO action,
 published extracts from the telegram sent by Sudanese President
 Numayrl to President Nixon in which "he described the killing
 of the foreign diplomats as despicable" and said his country
 definitely rejected such a means of solving problems.
 As in its reportage and comment surrounding the Munich incident
 last September, Moscow has again taken pains to dissociate the
 chief fedayeen groups, such as Fatah and the overall umbrella
 organization, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO),
 from responsibility for terrorist actions.  Thus Moscow's raports
 have repeatedly pointed out that PLO chairman and Fatah leader
 Yasir 'Arafat in a telegram to Numayri insisted that "the
 organization which he heads" had nothing to do with the Khartoum
 incident.  But TASS on the 7th did acknowledge that Numayri, in
 a radio and television speech on the 6th, charged that the Khartoum
 branch of Fatah had a hand in the seizure of the Saudi embassy.
 TASS cited Numayri as saying "specifically" that the head of the
 Fatah office in Khartoum had left for Libya in a Libyan plane
 several hours before the attack on the embassy, and it added that
 Numayri announced the termination of Palestinian organizations'
 activities in Sudan.  TASS disseminated, in conjunction wi'-h this
 Khartoum report, a Beirut-datelined dispatch noting that the PL1.
 publication FALe:STIN ATH-THAWRAH had rejected any link whatsoever
 between Fatah and Black September and had pointed out that the
 BSO was not represented in any organ of the PLO.
 U.S. REACTION     Reporting President Nixon's 2 March press
 conference, TASS noted that he said a
 senior State Department official had been sent to Khartoum to
 seek the release of the diplomats held hostage there by the BSO

 "terroristic organization."  The President said, TABS added,
 that the United States would do everything it could to get
 them released but that it would not yield to the blackmail
 demands of the terrorists.  A short TASS dispatch on the 7th
 reported that President Nixon, addressing a ceremony at the
 State Department commemorating the two American diplomats killed
 in Khartoum, pointed out that U.S. policy is not to submit to
 international blackmail and asked other governments to take the
 same firm stand.
 EVENTS IN JORDAN     Moscow has reported--but  drawn no direct
 connection between--the demands of the BSO
 terrorists in Khartoum for the release of Palestinians held in
 Jordan and the Jordanian Government's decision confirming death
 sentences meted out to this group.  But Soviet reportage has
 briefly and indirectly indicated Moscow's concern over the
 latter development, with TASS on 5 March citing the Paris LA
 NATION as emphasizing that execution of the "Palestinian patriots"
 might "greatly damage Arab unity."
 A TASS dispatch from Khartoum on the 3d acknowledged the BSO
 demands for the release in Jordan of a group of Palestinians
 "accused of preparing a state coup" and of a n'imber of political
 prisoners, as well as the release of Robert Kennedy's assassin,
 Sirhan Sirhan, and members of the Baader-Meinhoff "terrorist
 group" arrested in the FRG.  Subsequent reports broadcast by
 Moscow in Arabic on the 3d And 4th indicated that the demands
 had been scaled down, with the terrorists insisting on the
 release of Palestinians held in Jordanian and "Saudi Arabian"
 prisons and said to be calling for the release of Palestinians
 arrested "in some countries."
 Without recalling the Khartoum demands, TASS on the 5th reported
 from Amman the Jordanian Government decision confirming the death
 sentences handed out by a military tribunal on Fatah leader
 Abu Dawud and other Palestinian guerrillas arrested in February.
 They were charged, TASS noted, with infiltrating into Jordan in
 an attempt to sL.age a coup d'etat.*  (The clandestine "Voice of
 *  A PRAVDA analysis of the Palestinian movement last August cited
 "the committing of terrorism inside Jordan" among various "desperate
 acts" perpetrated by soma Palestinian organizations which had
 gr,.itly damaged the reputation of the entire resistance movement.

 Palestine," in a broadcast on 27 February, admitted that Abu
 Dawud had entered Amman "to carry out a suicide fedayeen operation
 against King Ilusayn's regime and tc paralyze the political
 activity which the king began in the United States.")
 TASS subsequently reported a growing campaign in Arab countries
 in protest against the death sentences, citing massages to
 Arab heads of states by PLO leader 'Arafat and Algerian leaders.
 And in promptly reporting King Husaya's appointment of Lt. Gan.
 Raoul al-Kilani as director of general intelligence and national
 security eflairs advisor, TASS added the observation, in an
 Amman-datelined report on the 6th, that "local circles" viewed
 the appointment as an indication of a tougher policy toward
 the Palestinian i .asistance move-went.
 BACKGROUND     Moscow has consistantly handled extremist fedayeen
 actions with caution, treating them in reluctant
 and implicitly disappruving fashion when mentioning them at all.
 Its coverage of the Munich events last September glossed over
 much of the detail, anel there were only semiofficial expressions
 of regret, confined to trief statements by sports officials and
 organizations. * While displaying the same restrained approach
 with regard to the Khartoum incident, Moscow seems to have been
 a shade less hesitant in this instance to brand tht actions as
 those of "extremists" and "terrorists."
 Subsequent to the Munich events, Podgornyy had gone on record
 at a 14 September banquet for the visiting Iraqi president with
 a declaration that "we cannot look with favor on the actions of
 certain elements who harm the Palestinian movement."  Gromyko
 had been more explicit in his 26 September address at the UN
 General Assembly when he said it was impossible to approve of
 the terrorist actions of "certain elements" in the Palestinian
 movement, which led among other things to the tragic Munich
 events.   Declaring that "their criminal actions" had struck
 a blow at the Palestinians' national interests and aspirations,
 Gromyko expressed Soviet opposition to acts of terrorism "which
 violate the diplomatic activity of states and their representatives,
 transport, communications," and the normal progress of international
 contacts and meetings.

 USSR DECRIES U.S. DEFENSE BUDGET HIKE, AVOIDS SALT II LINKAGE
 Reacting with a proiictable show of dismay to the announced boost
 in U.S. defense expenditures projected in the draft FY-1974 U.S.
 budget, Moscow has deplored the boost as an expression of the
 continuing influence of the "military-industrial complex" on
 U.S. policy and as a reflection of an attitude that is inconsie"pnt
 with the developing spirit of detente in U.S.-Soviet relations.
 At the same time, in keeping with  he policy of circumspection it
 has observed since the opening of SALT II in November, It has
 refrained from dwelling on the negative implicationb of .his
 criticism for the prospects in SALT and has continued to draw
 attention to positive as well as negative indicators of U.S.
 intent in this regard.
 BUDGET HIKE     Voluminous Soviet criticism of the new U.S.
 defense budget has focuse1 on the charge that
 the planned increase in expenditures is due primarily to increased
 outlays for strategic weapons.  Moscow has complained that this
 runs counter to the spirit of the tim.:s.  Typic't was the charge
 by PRAVDA coamentat.or Victor Mayevskiy and carrescondent
 B. Strelnikov in the 31 January issue of that E,aper that the
 budget proposals were in "flagrant contradiction to the period
 of easing in tensions."  While avoiding any detailed analysis
 of specific weapons programs embodied in the budget proposals,
 the commentaries have referred in general terms to strategic arms
 implications.  Mayevskiy and Strelnikov, for example, referred
 to new "superweapons," and V. Berezin, writing in RED STAR on
 3 February, mentioned U.S. plans for new submarine-launched
 missiles.
 Moscow has been generally reticent about linking these criticisms
 of the budget to the prospects for SALT.  However, USA Institute
 head Georgiy Arbatov in an article on U.S.-Soviet relations in
 the latest issue of KOMMUNIST--summ.iri.zed serially by Moscow
 radio between 1 and 5 March--noted that the new budget request
 came in the wake of the SALT I agreements as well as the Vietnam
 cease-fire.  He implied that the expanded military budget was
 one of the "leftovers" of the cold war in U.S. policy that
 presented an obstacle to further normalization of U.S.-Soviet
 relations.  An unusually detailed article on the budget in the
 8 February PRAVDA UKRAINY by that paper's military observer
 V. Zharov concluded that since the Pentagon was intent on
 continuing the arms race, the USSR was forced to strengthen its
 own forces.

 MIRV, 'JLMS     '11ij.s criticism comes against a background of
 Srviet comment expressing concern over current
 trends in U.S. strategy, particularly tke programs for
 improving sea-based strategic forces and for MIRVing land-
 based ICBM's.
 Spokesmen have for some time been citing budget figures and
 official U.S. statements bearing on thR importance of the U.S.
 naval forces--present and projected--in overall U.S. strategy.
 More recently, Captain lst rank Ye. Shcheglov, in the 20 February
 RED STAR, discussed the "decisive" role of the Atlantic fleet
 including the 6th Fleet--the Navy's "forward grouping in the
 Mediterranean"--and particularly its nuclear missile submarines.
 The Zhc.rov PRAVDA UKRAINY article noted that the U.S, military
 press was discussing a U.S. transition to a "sea strategy,"
 since, as he put it, underwater missile systems are relatively
 invulnerable to a surprise pre-emptive strike.  Zharov noted
 that the proposed ULMS system was a product of this strategy.
 Moscow's sensitivity to the potential impact on the SALT
 negotiations of possible. improvements in the U% missile
 submarine fleet has been displayed in recent weeks in its
 reaction to British press reports that Prime Minister Heath
 had discussed acquisition of Poseidon mimsiles in his recent
 visit to the United States.*
 While Moscow has been reticent about discussing MIRV's since
 the SALT I agreements were signed, two recent articles have
 mentioned the subject in discussing U.S. strategic programs.
 The USA Institute's I. L. Orlenkov, in a survey of the U.S.
 Air Force in the December 1972 issue of USA magazine, cited
 estimates of the timing of the MIRV conversion on the basis
 of U.S. Senate hearings.  ._.,uugh he noted that "the rates of
 (MIRV) rearmament are considerable," he did not cite MIRV
 specifically in concluding that "several" Air Force programs
 are aimed at achieving "military-technical supremacy."**
 *  Moscow's reaction to these reports is discussed in the TRENDS
 of 28 February 1913, page 25.  Shcheglov's discussion of the U.S.
 Atlantic fleet complements a previous analysis by him of the
 Pacific Fleet in the 20 April 1972 RED STAR.
 ** In proceeding to discuss other elements of the U.S. strategic
 strike force, Orlenkcw offered an argument for maintaining the
 role of strategic aviation in the strategic forces when he noted
 that aircraft "allow one to react to an alert signal without
 making an irreversible decision to launch strategic missiles--
 a decision fraqght with suicidal consequences."

 The Zharov PRAVDA UKRAINY article also focused on MIRV and
 noted that the system would considerably enhance the U.S.
 nuclear strike potential.
 SALT II     Arbatov, in the KOMMUNIST article, appeared to
 have U.S. weapons development In mind in asserting
 that the initial SALT agreements will take on lasting
 significance only if "attempts are not made to seek loopholes
 in order to accelerate the arms race in those spheres not yet
 embraced by treaties."  Otherwise, however, Moscow has not
 directly linked its expressions of concern over U.S. strategic
 weapons development with the SALT negotiations.  It has sustained
 an even-handed approach to SALT, limiting its direct comment
 since the opening of the second round to occasional reaffirmations
 of Soviet interest and to reiterations of Brezhnev's hopeful
 remarks on the subject at the USSR's 50th Anniversary celebrations
 last December.*
 TASS, in brief reports on President Nixon's inaugural address
 and on remarks by Secretary Rogers to the Senate Foreign Relations
 Committee on 22 February, singled out their statements on continued
 U.S. interest in the negotiations, including Rogers' remark thaC the
 United States was "encouraged" by Brezhnev's reference to the
 desirability of a gradual reduction in strategic weapons.  The
 only extensive commentary on ShLT II, by Boris Svet;ov in the
 first 1973 issue of NEW TIMES, was generally objective and
 noncommittal but notable for its warning against those in the
 United States who were hoping to obstruct the second round by
 calling on the government to continue arms development to acquire
 "trump cards" for the negotiations.  Svetlov's reference to tip,
 permanent consultative commission established by the first
 session of SALT II is the only Soviet mention of that body to
 date since the TASS communique at the end of the session on
 December 21.

 Kissinger's 15-19 February visit to China announcing the
 establishment of liaison offices, Peking took the occasion of
 a Taiwan anniversary that has been ignored in recent years to
 accelerate its campaign encouraging moves toward reunification
 of Taiwan with the mainland.  Peking's first major overture to
 the ROC concerning peaceful negotiations since the period of
 "peaceful coexistence" in Chinese foreign policy during the
 mid-1950s took place at a meeting sponsored by the united f;ont
 organ, the CPPCC, marking the 26th anniversary of the 28 February
 1947 uprising on Taiwan against the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek
 government.  Major speeches by PRC Overseas Chinese expert
 Liao Cheng-chih and former Kuomintang general Fu Tso-t as well
 e_. several briefer addresses all stressed the need for
 reconciliation, with Fu Tso-i's keynote address specifically
 urging ROC officials ;:o begin negotiations.
 Thta marked the first time Peking has observed the anniversary
 since 1965 and the first major celetration of the event since
 the 10th anniversary in 1957.  In keeping with the discreet
 approach taken by Peking in the period of developing detente
 with the United States, the treatment of the anniversary avoided
 portraying the uprising as a model fo,7 insurrection today and
 muffled invective against Chiang and his entourage.
 The major speakers at the anniversary meeting were obviously
 chosen for their special ties to the Kuomintang.. Liao Cheng-chih
 in the son of a famous ::uosintang martyr who was associated with
 Sur: Yat-sen.  Fu Tso-i is the former IQIT commander of Peking who
 surrendered to the co+amunists after peaceful.negotiations in 1949.
 tsecause of his s"ort.-. -der and his subsequent honored position in
 the PRC hierarchy, though never in positions of real power, Fu
 has traditicnal'?r been held up by Peking as a model for ROC
 officials in Taiwan to follow.  Fu had made a similar speech on
 3 February 1956, 'packing a Chou En-lai report four days earlier
 which called fur "peaceful liberation" and negotiations with
 Chiang.  Chou has not yet lent his personal prestige to the
 current effort.

 Setting the stage for Fu's keynote address, Liao Cheng-chip
 dwelt on themes present in PRC comment on Taiwan over the past
 year in playing up Peking's strengthened domestic and inter-
 national position.  Liao cited in particular PRC entrance into
 the UN, improved relations with the United States and Japan,
 as well as the 22 February Sino-U.S. communique and recent peace
 agreements in Vietnam and Laos to demonstrate that the "situation
 is now very favorable" for the liberation of Taiwan.  Calling
 attention to a feeling of common pride among people on both aid's
 of the Taiwan Strait over Peking's accomplishments, he noted that
 many Taiwan "compatriots" have returned to tour and visit
 relatives, helping to promote "great patriotic unity."  Addressing
 ROC officials, Liao asserted that the "general trend and the
 desire of the people" to liberate Taiwan "is now very clear" and
 warned them not to "miss the opportunity to make contributions to
 the unification of the motherland."  Promising that Peking regards
 all patriots as "one big family whether they come forward early or
 late," he assured all who work for reunification that they will
 be treated with "due respect" and will be forgiven past wrongs.
 Fu Tso-i's "few words to the military and administrative personnel"
 on Taiwan dwelt in the most explicit terms thus far on the
 improvement in Sino-u.S. relations in order to show the futility
 of the ROC's continued reliance on Washington, and he alluded to
 possible ROC-USSR ties in warning against shifting reliance to
 "someone else."  Calling unification the "trend of the times"
 that "no force whatever can obstruct or undermine," Fu gave notice
 to officials on Taiwan that they "should no longer cherish any
 illusion about outsiders."  Asserting that American policy toward
 Taiwan had changed as "is very clearly shown in the two Sino-U.S.
 communiques," and callin?, attention to Kissinger's remarks "of
 late" that the UniL'4 States favors a peaceful resolution of the
 Taiwan problem, Fu asked rhetorically:  "It is obvious:  how long
 can Taiwan rely on the United States?  Absolutely not long."
 Moving immediately to the problem of possible Soviet involvement,
 he warned against the "dream of relying on someone else,"
 asserting the ROC "must not make a fresh error."  Claiming that
 President Nixon has now become committed to a policy of coexistence
 with China that will make it "absolutely impossible for the United
 States to maintain its former relations with Taiwan for long," Fu
 claimed that the United States at the same time would not "allow
 Taiwan to 'cooperate' with anybody else to disrupt peace" in Asia.
 He cited La this connection the 1972 Sino-U.S. Shanghai communique
 which affirmed the two sides' determination to oppose "any third
 party" seeking hegemony in the axea.

 Pointing out that "this situation cannot be changed," Fu got
 to the main point of his address with a patriotic pitch:  "We
 are awl Chinese.  Why couldn't we talk for the sake of the
 sacred cause of unifying the motherland?"  Citing the authori-
 tative example of Mao Tse-tung's trip to Chungking in October
 1945 to conduct talks with Chiang Kai-shek, Fu said the two
 sides should come together and talk, "the sooner the better."
 Avoiding any specification of PRC terms for the talks, Fu
 merely asserted that Peking remains open to either formal
 sessions or informal cuntacts, and that it would remain silent
 on the talks if so desired by Taipei.  In an effort to reassure
 ROC officials with "doubts" that they will receive good treatment
 during the raiks ard after unification, Fu cited not only his
 own position despite his Fast record as a "war criminal" but
 pointedly mentioned the example of PR., treatment accorded the
 most famous ROC returnee to the mainland, former ROC President
 Li Tseng-jea, whom ne made a point of calling by his honorific
 name, Li Te-lin.
 PRC media devoted extensive coverage to the 28 February meeting
 but have thus far not folluwed up with significant comment.
 Radio Peking extended its usual 30-minute programs on 1 March
 to 45 minutes in order to cover the session, while Peking's
 programs to Taiwan were extended from the usual 15 minutes
 to 45 minutes.  The only subsequent developments related to
 Taiwan have been a 3 March: report describing the arrival in
 Peking of a former ROC commercial attache in Australia and a
 1 March account of a meeting of Chinese residents in Japan
 which  stressed the importance of Taiwan's liberation.

 CHILE
 NDSCOW, HAVANA SEE ELECTIONS AS TRIL14PH FOR ALLENM REGIME
 E:.c.ensive but repetitive Moscow comment and more limited Havana
 comment or the 4 March Chilean legislative elections have
 treated the outcome as a triumph for the Popular Unity (UP)
 government and a vindication of its program.  Both Soviet and
 Cuban media have emphasized that the UP managed the difficult
 feat of increasing its share of the popular vote over that
 obtained in the 1970 presidential elections, ignoring the fact
 that the earlier election was a three-way race while the current
 contest involved only two major contenders.
 Moscow and Havana also stressed that the opposition's effort
 to obtain two-thirds control of the Chilean Senate--the number
 required to impeach President Allende--had been thwarted for the
 most part ignoring pre-election statements by key opposition
 spokesmen emphas'zing their goal of a simple majority of the
 popular vote.  Although pre-election comment had noted the
 opposition's view of the contest as a plebiscite and Allende's
 denials that thin was the case, there was scant reference to
 this point in postelection comment.  Moreover, Moscow and
 Havana conveniently chose to play down the opposition's
 continuing control of both houses of congress, while highlighting
 the UP's increased representation in the two chambers.
 MOSCOW     Exultant Soviet reaction to the election was typified
 by a 5 March TASS commentary by Nikolay Chigir.
 Hailing the "new major success" by the UP,  Chigir noted that the
 tendency of the party in power in Chile to lose popular support
 with the passage of time had been reversed by the Allende regime,
 with the election serving to demonstrate "convincingly" that
 the government had "considerably gained in strength in two years
 and four months" in office.  Like other Soviet commentators, he
 alleged that the aim of the "reactionary" opposition was "to
 seize political power" by gaining two-thirds control of the Chilean
 Senate and stressed that this goal ha-! been rejected by the
 electorate.  Chigir characterized the outcome as "a victory
 of the entire Chilean people" who favor "further implementation
 of the program of revolutionary socioeconomic transior.ation"
 paving the way to Chile's "further socialist development."

 Although Moscow comment focused on the opposition's failure to
 gain the two-thirds control of the Senate and or the gain's
 made by the regime, a Radio Moscow commentary beamed to Latin
 America on the 6th recalled this opposition's contention that
 the elections were "a kind of plebiscite to decide the fate
 of the popular government" wherein Allende would have to
 "quit and make way for the opposition" if the UP obtained less
 than half of the voc.es.  However, it went on to denigrate the
 notion as "unconstitutional in its very essence," implying
 that the government's continuing min,irity status would not produce
 a retrenchment:  "The government led by President Salvador
 Allende is fully determined to continue realising its program cf
 radical transformations."
 Some Moscow comment o!;erved vaguely that the Chilean electoral
 results would have a salutary influence on the political
 situation elApwhere in Latin America.  Thus, a PRAVDA article in
 the 7th termed the election "a graphic illustration" of the "sig-
 nificant" political changes taking place on the continent and
 concluded that it would be "difficult to overestimate" its
 impact on "the direction of further development of events is
 Latin American u,untries."  In a similar vein, Radio Moscow
 the day before predicted that tae Chilean balloting would have
 "broad political repercussions" on Latin American "democratic
 and progressive cit?lea."  The  "strengthening" of the government's
 position, it alleged, was "evidence of the upsurge of the liberation
 processes, not only in Chile but throughout Latin America."
 Despite Moscow's et'allient reaction to the elections, there were
 sums intimations of doubt about the future stability of the
 Allende regime.  A Radio Moscow commentary on the Sth for example,
 cited Chilean leftist sources as alleging that Chilean extreme
 rightists "generously supported from the outside" have not
 eschewed their coupist plans and that "the danger of civil war
 remains very real."  It concluded, however, that Chilean workers
 were prepared "to repulse any reactionary attempts to foil
 revolutionary changes."
 HAVANA     There has been very little Cuban resent on the
 elections thus fat--a limited reaction that may be
 related to Havana's fundamental skepticism about elrationr in
 general and more specifically to its reservations about the
 feasibility of Allende's effort to build socialism within the
 confines of a "bourgeois" system.  Last September Castro had

 buen embarrassed by foreign prose reports that he had privately
 alleged that the Chileans would have to abandon "bourgeois
 legality" if their revolution was to progress.  While he
 strongly denied the reports, they appear consistent with his
 views on revolution in Latin America.
 Havana's initial reaction was by domestic TV commentator Jose
 Maria Gonalez Jerez on the 5th in an analysis of the Chilean
 and French elections.  Both contests, he alleged, demonstrated
 "the victory of the people, their radicalization, and their
 cleatcut veer toward th4 left--a characteristic of this nascent
 post-Vietnam phase."  Observing that opposition efforts to gain
 the necessary two-thirds control (f the Senate for Allende's
 impeachment "fell flat,"  Gonzal_., Jerez hailed the election
 result as "a splendid battle won by the people," one that "sets
 up more favorable conditions" for the UP to implement its program.
 The only other monitored Cuban commentary, by PRENSA LATINA
 correspondent Pedro Lobaina, examined the results of the
 senatorial, races in Santiago province and their implications
 for the 1976 presidential contest.  In a Santiago-datelined
 dispatch on 6 March, Lobaina noted that former Chilean President
 and leading Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei was the chief vote-
 getter among the senatorial candidates--the opposition captured
 three out of the five of the senate seats at stake in the province--
 and concluded that he had "emerged as the possible candidate for
 the right" in the 1976 presidential elections.  While noting
 that of the two victorious UP candidates the Chilean Communist
 Party's (PCCh) representative had garnered slightly more votes
 than that of the Socialist Party (PS), he declared that it was
 "still premature" to forecast who the left's presidential candidate
 would be.  Lobaina concluded that emergence of "a clear maen ity"
 for either the PCCh cr the PS would "undoubtedly" influence the
 choice of Allende's successor.  PRENSA LATINA on the 5th had
 carried a PS Political Commission statement declaring that the
 election had resulted in the party's maintaining "its position
 as the foremost political force in the UP."
 Lobaina's commentary was unusual, since Havana has only rarely
 acknowledged the sharp political rivalry between the two major
 elements in the UP coalition.  Although P&%NSA LATINA correspondents
 in Santiago have reported to Havana in great detail on policy
 and ideological conflicts between the PCCh and Allende on the one
 hand and the more radical PS and extremist Leftist Revolutionary
 Movement (MIR) on the other, these :.sports have rarely appeared
 in Cuban media, presumably because of Castro's desire to avoid
 any impression of interfere'ice in the internal politics of his
 closest ally in the hemisphere.

 The only available Havana cowaentary on the internadine prtr-.dlection
 conflict was by Lobaine on 8 Februat'y.   Reporting the adoption
 of the Up political platform after "two weeks of intensive debates
 on tactics," he noted that "discrepancies among the ruling parties
 arose over differing priorities."  Without spelling out the
 positions of either tarty, he indicated that the PCCh regarded
 the consolidation of existing gains and the improvement of the
 efficiency in state-run industries as a "key taskl" the PS argued
 that "top priority" must be given to enlarging the "socially
 owned" sector of the economy.  While noting that top PCCh and PS
 leaders, "in a unity gesture," had sat alongside Allende at
 a political rely, Lobaina implied that the modus vivendi might
 not survive the elections.  The new UP platform, he charged,
 "does not define the issues of the recent polemics."  The document,
 he went on to say, "appears to demonstrate, rather, the desire
 of the UP parties to keep discrepancies from going any further
 with just a short time to go before the crucial parliamentary
 elections."

 YUGOSLAVIA-USSR
 TITO STRESSES CLOSER TIES WITH MO COW, CONTIMIED NONALINEMENT
 More cordial. relations with the Soviet Union, along with steadfas?
 adherence to ~he nonalinement policy, were underscored by Tito in
 a lengthy irtd rvisw published in the 23 Fabruary issue of VJESNIK,
 the authoritative Zagreb daily ')f tl+e Socialist Alliance of
 Worki.ng People (SAWP) of Croatfs.  The interview, which also
 included remarks on Belgrade's relations with the Peopio's
 Republic of China and the United States, steered clear of the
 internal situation--stil.1 marked by a continuing purge of "liberal"
 elements, the latest victims being the top three officials of the
 SAWP of Serbia.
 The Yugoslav President was interviewed by VJESNIK editor Dare.
 Janskovic on Brioni on S February, but the interview was not
 publicized until the 21st when the TANJUG dourest?,c service
 carded the text, published in identical form in VJESNIK two
 days later.  After discussing Vietnam, Europe, and the Middle
 East ("the USSR has a right to be interested in the Middle East
 situation"), Tito stressed that Belgrade's cooperation with the
 Soviet Union was increas'ng, mainly in the economic caalm.
 "Since our relations with the Soviet Union improved severrt
 years ago," he noted,  our economic croperation has developed
 constantly."  He added that the USSR "is now in third place,
 and it could soon be in first place in our trade with foreign
 countries."  Alluding to the Soviet loan granted to Bol,grade
 last November, Tito remarked that "as for the credits, who else
 would give us half a billion dollars or even more than chat--
 600 to 700 million?" and added that the amount would increase
 to a billion within a year or two.  The USSR, he remarked, is
 also a valuable market for Yugoslav goods which cannot be sold
 in Western markets.
 Tito made it clear that the bad feelings aroused by the 1968
 Czechoslovak crisis no longer stand in the way of improved
 Moscow-Belgrade relations, noting that "what happened in
 Czechoslovakia has been outgrown" although Yugoslavia's
 disagreement with the intervention is well-known.  "The Soviet
 Union iu not at war anywhere," he added, praising the USSR's
 "pacification" course and its "enormous" i?upport for liberation
 movements in Vietnam and elsewhere.

 Tito portrayed Belgrade's policy of nonalinsment as approveJ by
 the Soviet leaders, "primarily Sreshnsv," who "told me they
 fully agree" with this policy as "beneficial In the struggle
 against impartalism."  At the as" time, he remarked that "a
 little bit of time was needed" before the Soviets could publicly
 express this view.  Regarding the Soviet loan, he Losisted, as
 Belgrade commentaries had last November, that the Yugoslavs had
 made "nu political concessions" to get the loan.  He declared
 that Yuji Levi.  is accepted we a nonalined socialist country
 outalle the Warsaw Pact," pointing out that Belgrade had also
 accepted credits from the West, including the United States,
 "and yet we have not joined the Atlantic pact."  One factor
 underlying Tito's emphasis on continued nonallnement was high-
 lighted by a Moscow-datelined report in the same newspaper on
 the 28th stressing Yugoslav-Soviet disagreements on questions
 of bilateral trade.
 The Yugoslav leader portrayed re Litions with Poking as improving
 though understandably less devslo,)sd than those with the USSR,
 with which Belgrade has party and cultural as well as economic
 ties.  He insisted that he would not take sides in the Sino-
 Soviet conflict, saying he had "told this to Comrade Brashnev,
 too."
 Relations between Belgrade and the United States, Tito declared,
 "are not only normal but ale  good, ragarclass of the fact that
 we do not agree with their policy"--a disagreement hit said had
 not prevented increased tourism and economic relations between
 the two countries.
 PRAVDA COVERAGE     A Belgrade-datelined TASS report of Tito's
 interview carried in PRAVDA on the 24th
 briefly cited his reference to Belgrade's nonalined policy,
 though not including his remark that the policy had Soviet
 sanction, and featured his portrayal of developing Moscow-
 Belgrade relations.                          While predictably omitting his favorable
 remarks on relations with Peking, PRAVDA did include his
 criticism of .unspecified attempts "to equate the USSR and the
 United States" because both are big powers, without taking into
 .account the respecti';o countries' specific actions.

 USSR  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 GOSPL N DEPUTY CHIEF Sd4DU/ OPPOSES CUTBACKS IN AGRICULTURE
 In the wake of calls by Premier Kosygin and Gosplan Chairmen
 Baybakov to cut back on construction starts, Gosplan First Deputy
 Chairman Ti. .Sokolov has written an article in the February
 PLANNED ECONOMY expressing concern that this may be done at
 agriculture's expense.  Where Saybakov at the December Supreme
 Soviet session had sharply assailed the proliferation of local
 construction projects. Sokolov came out in their defense on
 grounds that such projects have enabled farms to most their urgent
 construction needs.  The journal containing Sokolov's article was
 signed to pr,mss on 11 January--three weeks before the demotion of
 top agricultural spokesman Polyanskiy.  Kosygin and Baybakov have
 usually associated themselves with the interacts of industry,
 while Sokolov is a longtime agricultural spokesman like Polyanskiy.
 The current drive to cut back local construction projects was
 launched by Kosygin at a 30 Septeober Gesplan meeting.  Kosygin
 harshly assailed the proliferation of new construction projects
 and especially the ballooning of construction financed with
 noncentralized investments, which in 1971 exceeded the plan by
 3.2 billion rubles.  Baybakov's report on the 1973 plan at the
 December ,upreme Sov i.t session likewise complained of "great
 excesses" in the use of noncentralized investments, such as the
 construction of unnecessary projects not stipulated in the plan
 'nd the resultant diversion of material and labor resources from
 construction of "very important" projects.
 To ensure completion of the "most important" projects, the 1973
 plan placed limits on capital investments made through noncentralized
 sources.  This, according to Saybakov, was designed to ensure that
 the economic priorities atip!:` ted in the five-year plan would be
 maintained.  He pointed out ,..at the previously adopted level of
 investment for agriculture was being retained, but there were also
 hints in his speech that this sector may suffer.  For example, in
 citing the need to limit noncentralized investments, he exempted
 projects fini..ced by sovkhozes operating under full cost-accounting
 or using special-purpose bank credits, but he said nothing about
 projects of other sovkhozes and kolkhozes.
 The implications of the Kosygin-Baybakov austerity program appear
 to have alarmed Sokolov, who emerged as an outspoken defender of
 agriculture immediately following his appointment as Gosplan first

 deputy chairman in the spring of 1970.  In his latest article
 Sokolov indicated that agriculture is highly dependent on
 non-centralised investments because centralised funds are
 still being diverted from that sector.  He pointed out that
 agricultural construction tasks were overfulfilled in 1971-72,
 but only because of the overt ulfLlleent of non-centralised
 financing.  And he warned that "attempts to limit farms' rights
 to use noncentralised capital investments under the pretext
 of a shortage of material resources are objectively aimed at
 housing back the growth of the material-technical bane of
 agricultural production," especially since centrally funded
 materials are not used for many farm construction projectr..
 In another article, in the February ECONOMICS OF AGRICULTURE,
 Sokolov had also discussed agricultural needs and urged industry
 to seek out additional possibilities for producing more
 fertilizer and equipment for agriculture.
 CUTBACKS IN         Sokolov's warnings appears to be directed at
 "NONPRODUCTiON"     cutbacks in the so-called "nonproduction"
 sphere, which now accounts for only 15 percent
 of state capital investment in agriculture end includes such
 projects as the construction of rural housing, schools, hospitals,
 and the like.  Figures cited by Gosplan Deputy Chairman N. Gusev
 in a February 1973 ECONOMICS OF AGRICULTURE article indicate that
 while agriculture this year will retain approximately the previously
 planned level of funds--16.4 billion rubles--construct 6an of
 production facilities will increase, esp,e:aily for the two
 priority fields of livestock complexes and land Lm;rovement.
 Construction of livestock complexes will increase from 622 million
 rubles in 1972 to 1.1 billion for 1973, while an October 1972
 Central Committee-Council of Ministers decree "significantly
 increased" investment in land improvement, raising it to 5.3 billion
 rubles, according to Gusev.  The increases were apparently obtained
 at the expense of the nonproduction sphere.
 Sokolov, like Polyanskiy, has favored increases in construction
 not only of rural production facilities but also of rural housing
 and other nonproduction projects as a means of raising rural living
 standards.  After transferring to Gosplan, Sokolov managed to alter
 Gosplan's planning practices so that beginning in January 1971.
 production and nonproduction projects In agriculture were planned
 jointly rather than independently.  The result, according to
 Sokolov, has been better provision of resources for rural housing
 and cultural projects, which in the past usually received the
 leftovers.  Investment in rural nonproductiun projects increased
 conciderably in 1971 and building materials for such projects

 financed by kolkhozaN and sovkhozes were supplied from central
 and republic resources, although, as Sokolov complained, some of
 these materials were still being divertud to industrial uses,
 Prospecto In this field appeared to briithten when RSFSR Premier
 Voronov, whose republic was singltd out In 13 October 1971 RURAL
 LIFE for delaying fin,ences and rea"urces for rural conatruct-ion,
 was removed in late July 1971 and the Central Committee and
 Council of Ministers adopted a 26 August 1971, decree levying quotas
 on ministries for the production of building materials for rural
 construction.
 But the proliferation of kolkhoz and sovkhoz constructiou projects
 presumably contributed much to the swelling of non-centrally
 financed construction and to the abuses condemned by Baybakcv.
 An article by L. Braginskiy in the February QUESTIONS OF ECONOMICS
 criticized the absence of central controls over kolkhoz construction
 projects and urged that ouch projects be included in the plan.
 Even Sokolov in his recent article conceded the need to improve
 control of construction financed by kolkhuses and aovkhozes in order
 to a,'oid "excesses" and "mismanagement," but the thrust of his
 argument was to expand rather than restrict the scope of such

 AQRICULTURAL PRONOIJNCENENTS CONTINUE MODERATE POLICIES
 The annual PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on spring planting, released
 on 2 March, indicates no change in agricultural policies in the
 wake of last year's disappointing harvest.  The editoriai calls
 for continued implementation of the party's moderate rural
 policies, which have been in full effect sinco the fall of 1970,
 following the second party plenum at which the position of
 Lin Piao and the radicals was eroded.  The "most important task"
 for the coming year in agriculture, according to the editorial,
 is intensif ication of "criticism aiming at the political and
 ideological essence of the revisionist line pushed by swindlers
 like Liu Shao-chi."  Policies advocated include continued stress
 ota all- ound develcpment and agricultural diversification, and
 an unusually strong directive to cadres to personally work on the
 farms, including "places with harsh living conditions."  Implying
 that natural conditions `his year are no better than those which
 were vesponsibls for last year's disappointing harvest, the
 editorial quotes "comrades" to saying'  "If there is any doubt as
 to whether or not there will be natural disasters, w4 must be
 prepared for this eventuality.  If we do not knew whether the
 dater will be serious or mild, we must be prepared for a
 serious one."
 Continuation of recent ~:mliciea had been clearly indicated in
 several provincial and central articles calling for agricultural
 diversification even though grain harvests were down.  A
 28 February Peking radio commentary reiterating this line noted
 that "merely grasping grain, that is, developing an economy
 through one single sector, cannot satisfy the varied needs of
 the state and of the people's daily life."  This is a direct
 attack on policies advocated at the height of the cultural
 revolution when grain was stressed to the detriment of other crops.
 The reversal of that line had not been reflected fully in the media
 until the spring planting editorial in 1971, but a September 1970
 editorial in PEOPLE'S DAILY, shortly after the second party plenum,
 had laid the basis for the changes by denouncing leftist as well
 as rightist errors in agriculture.  There have been several recent
 provincial references to that editorial as a continuing guide to
 correct policy.
 The 28 February Peking radio commentary criticized the view of
 "some comrades" who have apparently decided that the answer to

 current grain shortages in to plant more "high-yield crops"
 such as so-cghum and corn.  Rejecting any quick-fix solution
 to grain shortages, the commentary ,pointed out that low-
 yielding crops can eventually be made to yield more and that
 in any case emphasis on output alone, "causing an unbalanced
 proportion of the crops planted, will affect the people's
 daily life and the fulfillment of state plans."
