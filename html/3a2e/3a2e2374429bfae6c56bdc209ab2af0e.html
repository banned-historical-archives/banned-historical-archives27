 Moscow's notes of 10 January calling for a German

 and keep pressure on the West for negotiations.                 In West-

 a year in which--unfettered by assembly pressure-,.he can
 try to carry out a program to rally public support for a
 conservative government.  Phoui will reorganize his cabi-

 greater proportion of young reformers.   In gaining his
 12-month respite, Phoui used North Vietnam's military
 pressure in the disputed frontier area to justify his
 request for full power.   Laos has not accepted Hanoi's

 the people at a time when the regime is stepping up its
 demands on their time and energy.  A promised increase in
 the cotton cloth ration will be welcoued by tb.o-Chinese
 consumer, but it does not begin to keep pace with the
 claim that cotton production doubled in 1958.
 'PEIPING PRAISES USSR AS MODEL OF SOCIALISM .  .    .  ?  .    ?  Page
 The Chinese Communists are reviving the theme of
 "learning from the Soviet Union in building socialism"--
 'a line.not prominently mentioned in China during most of
 l98 0  This display of deference to the Soviet example
 is another step in Peiping's modification of its earlier
 claims of a rapid advance toward Communism, and suggests
 China will avoid further public statements implying that
 its "road" is basically different from the one already
 traveled by the USSR.  The continuation of-the commune
 campaign demonstrates, however, that Peiping to a large
 degree is still independent on the practical level.
 THE NEW SOVIET VOLUNTEER WORKERS' MILITIA   .  .  .  .    .       Page
 Volunteer workers' militia detachments are being

 versial points, has not deviated from the basic position
 taken on 25 December by Gromyko--that alleged "invalid
 conditions" of the West were blocking agreement..  Moscow
 may believe that ostensible agreement on all matters ex-
 cept those "conditions" will further the Soviet effort
 to place on the West the onus for any stalemate.   The
 Soviet bid of 10 January to resume negotiations on the
 adjourned surprise-attack talks is intended to contrast
 favorably with.the Western insistonce on'Tirst evaluating

 have been exerting a special effort to influence the labor
 movement.       Provisional President Urrutia and the leading
 members of his cabinet are anti-Communist but seem unlike-
 ly to take decisive action against the Communists' Popular
 Socialist party.  Fidel Castro has declared that the party,
 with a membership estimated at 8,000 to 12.000, now will
 be permitted legal status.
 BLOC ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN IRAQ .  .  .  .    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  9
 The Sino-Soviet bloc, which has made substantial arms
 shipments to Baghdad, is making a concentrated effort to
 develop economic as well as political relations with the
 new Iraqi Government.  A Soviet delegation arrived in
 Baghdad early this month to discuss economic and technical
 cooperation between the two countries, and it is likely that
 Moscow will soon offer financial aid.
 NEW BELGIAN POLICY TOWARD THE CONGO   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 10
 Belgium's 13 January announcement of a new policy for
 the Congo, given special urgency by the recent rioting in
 Leopoldville, promises limited autonomy in the near future
 and full independence eventually.   The Belgians hope for
 some federative ties with their African colony.         In the
 Congo the new policy pronouncement will probably be re-
 ceived with suspicion and distrust by increasingly impa-
 tient African Nationalists.  Among the colony's approxi-
 mately 23,000 permanent white settlers, it may evoke strong
 opposition and possibly agitation for the extension of au-
 tonomy to defined "European" regions.
 NEW FRENCH MOVES ON ALGERIA .  .
 .  .  .    .    .  .    .    .  .  Page 12
 Despite De Gaulle's public position that a political
 solution for Algeria is to be delayed pending progress
 toward economic and social development, French propaganda
 and behind-the-scenes moves appear aimed at early nego-
 tiations with the rebels.  While rebel leaders remain dis-
 trustful of Paris, settler apprehensions over De Gaulle's
 intentions are becoming more outspoken, and any evidence
 that rebel desires for independence are actively being
 discussed will arouse violent reaction.
 BERBER DISSIDENCE IN MOROCCO . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .Page 13
 Moroccan authorities appear to have made some prog-
 ress--although not as much as they are claiming--toward
 re-establishing order in areas of northern Morocco where
 Berber tribal dissidence recently assumed serious pro-
 portions.  However, hard-core dissidents remain active in
 the mountains and will probably continue their resistance
 at least until Rabat takes measures to alleviate Berber

 BAGHDAD PACT MINISTERIAL COUNCIL MEETING .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  Page  14
 The Baghdad Pact Ministerial Council, which is to
 hold its semiannual session in Karachi from 26 to 28
 January, will concern itself primarily with the effects
 of the Iraqi revolution last July.   Iraq still has not
 made clear its official policy toward the pact.      Steps
 are being taken to strengthen the organization through
 bilateral defense agreements between the United States
 and Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan.
 EFFECTS OF CEYLON'S AGREEMENTS WITH SINO-SOVIET BLOC .  .  .  Page  15
 Ceylon's economic and cultural pacts signed with
 Peiping and Moscow about a year ago have not yet substan-
 tially increased Communist influence on the island or ad-
 versely affected the neutralist government's attitude
 toward the free world.   Sino-Soviet efforts to expand
 cultural relations with Ceylon have thus far proved more
 successful than the bloc's economic activity.
 INDIA PREPARING AMBITIOUS THIRD FIVE-YEAR PLAN . .  .  .  .  .  Page  16
 Recent statements by Indian leaders and resolutions
 passed at the 6-11 January annual meeting of the Congress
 party indicate that Nehru plans to intensify the pace of
 India's economic development under the Third Five-Year
 Plan (1961-66) in an effort to keep up with Communist
 China's "giant leap forward."  New Delhi apparently is
 planning a goal of nearly $21 billion for the third plan,
 compared with a probable expenditure of $13.5 billion, 80
 percent of the original goal, during the second plan.  The
 target is beyond India's financial capacity and would
 probably have a foreign exchange gap of several billion
 dollars.

 The minority Agrarian government finally formed by
 V. J. Sukselainen on 13.January has as its chief task the
 normalizing of trade and political relations with the USSR--
 a problem made more urgent by Finland's growing economic
 difficulties.  The Sukselainen government may be forced to
 depend on the combined votes of the Communist-front Finnish
 People's Democratic League and the splinter Opposition So-
 cial Democrats.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 PRESIDENT FRONDIZI?S PROBLEMS IN ARGENTINA . .  .  .  . .  . .  Page  1
 Argentine President Arturo Frondizi, who will visit
 the United States from 19 January to'l February, initiated
 on 1 January a rigorous austerity and monetary stabiliza-
 tion program which will be backed by $329,000,000 in for-
 eign credits                                     Opposition
 groups, especially the Peronistas, who are trying to regain
 control of organized labor through elections now under
 way, have already attacked the program, casting doubt
 on Frondizi?s ability to carry it out.  Frondizi is, how-
 ever, determined to push the program,. and the state of
 siege imposed on 11 November to quell politically moti-
 vated labor disturbances will probably be continued
 during the initial stages of the new program.
 THE SOVIET COLLECTIVE FARM -- THEORY AND PRACTICE  .  .  .  .  Page  8
 In the face of Chinese Communist claims that the
 commune is a "more progressive" form of social organiza-
 tion, Moscow has continued to maintain that the collective
 farm system must be "consolidated," not eliminated, and
 that the arrival of Communism under the formula of "from
 each according to his ability, to each according to his
 needs" must await the achievement of material abundance,
 The Soviet regime's policy in the countryside calls for
 the eventual transformation of rural life through evolu-
 tionary policies larded with material incentives, rather
 than through violent changes in organization such as the
 Chinese have employed.  Despite these differences in ap-
 proach, however, Moscow's final aim,  like Peiping's,  is
 to effect a.fundamental alteration of the collective farm
 structure and, in accordance.with,long-standing,, Marxist
 doctrine, to convert the peasant to a political, economic,
 and social status identical with that of the factory
 worker.

 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 Soviet Peace Proposal
 The USSR's notes of 10 Jan-
 uary to the Western powers call-
 ing for a conference in Warsaw
 or Prague within two months to
 conclude a German peace treaty
 and to discuss the Berlin ques-
 tion are intended to demon-
 strate Soviet desire to nego-
 tiate.  The USSR wishes to ap-
 pear responsive to Western ob-
 jections to discussing Berlin
 except within the wider frame-
 work of Germany and European
 security.   Soviet leaders ap-
 parently expect that the pro-
 posal  to hold a peace confer-
 ence will place the Soviet
 Union in a position to exploit
 growing pressures wi 111
 Western powers
 or a gen-
 eral policy review of problems
 relating to German reunifica-
 tion.
 The draft peace treaty ap-
 pended to the notes elaborates
 the 11 "basic provisions" for
 a treaty set forth in the aide-
 memoire Mikoyan delivered to
 Secretary Dulles on 5 January.
 It is essentially a formula
 for a neutral Germany, with
 the central theme that Western
 recognition of two Germanys
 is necessary to any progress
 on a German settlement.   It
 provides for participation by
 both Germanys'in the negotia-
 tion and signing of a treaty..
 If a German confederation should
 then exist, it would also be
 represented.
 The draft also provides
 for the withdrawal of foreign
 troops from Germany, a ban on
 German possession and produc-
 tion of nuclear weapons and oth-
 er instruments of mass destruc-
 tion as well as bombers and sub-
 marines, and a prohibition on
 German participation in mili-
 tary alliances directed against
 any of the signatory powers. It
 would bind "Germany" to suppress
 any Nazi organizations and ac-
 tivities as well as any organi-
 zations, including those of
 refugees, hostile to any of the
 Allied powers.   A demilitarized
 "free city" of Berlin would be
 established pending the reuni-
 fication of Germany.
 The notes warned again
 that Western refusal to nego-
 tiate will not prevent the USSR
 from "renouncing its functions
 in Berlin" and transferring con-
 trol over Allied access to Ber-25X6
 lin to the East Germans, but
 failed to mention again the six-
 month    deadline.   Moscow is
 in a position to be able to
 hand  over  its  quadripartite
 functit>ns in Berlin to the East
 German. regime at any time.
 Moscow probably does not
 expect a conference to take
 place now on these terms.  So-
 viet leaders apparently hope,
 however, that constant pressure
 will eventually produce a break
 in the Western position on Ger-
 many and European security or
 at least will lead to greater
 popular acceptance of the So-
 viet view that rapprochement
 between the two German states
 is the only solution to the re-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 15 January 1959
 Soviet draft treaty, and the
 West German press backed up
 this demand with sharp criti-
 cism of the treaty as demanding
 a "second surrender" of Germans.
 On the question of future nego-
 tiations, there was less unanim-
 ity in Bonn than elsewhere.
 Most-papers saw a high-level
 meeting on Germany taking place
 within the next few months.   The
 pro-Social Democratic (SPD)
 press and some independent pa-
 pers called for negotiations in
 the hope of inducing the Soviet
 Union.to :modify its  "maximum
 demands."  SPD Deputy Chairman
 Wehner warned against flatly
 rejecting the Soviet proposals.
 French Foreign Ministry of-
 ficials believe the Soviet note
 is an unacceptable basis for
 negotiations and is a tougher
 position than previous Soviet
 peace treaty proposals.  An an-
 alysis of Mikoyan's aide-memoire
 stressed that the 10 January
 note makes clear the Soviet aim
 of neutralizing Germany with-
 out reunification.   Some of the
 French press, however, noted a
 more conciliatory language,
 which was felt to indicate Mos-
 cow's desire for negotiations.
 The British press with near
 unanimity  continues to argue
 for:. "less negative" Western re-
 sponses and discussions of the
 revised Rapacki plan.  The Man-
 chester Guardian observed that
 "an unconstructive Russian ap-
 proach is not justification for
 an unconstructive Western reply."
 East Germany - Berlin
 Strongly echoing Moscow's
 claim that East Germany is a
 fully sovereign state, the U1-
 bricht regime now appears to be
 laying the groundwork for an
 eventual claim'that it is the
 only legitimate German state.
 Its note of 7 January to Moscow
 reiterated that West Berlin be-
 longs to East Germany.  The note
 further declared that the East    25X6
 Berlin municipal authorities are
 the "sole rightful organs" for
 the whole city.   Premier Grote-
 wohi's tour of the Middle East
 is also designed to underline
 East German claims to sovereign-
 ty.  Following Grotewohi's minor
 successes in Cairo and Baghdad,
 he saw Nehru, but apparently
 failed to change India's policy
 of nonrecognition of East Ger-
 many.
 Soviet authorities in Ber-
 lin are continuing to insist that
 American authorities must now
 deal with East Germany on all
 questions concerning American
 military personnel in East Ger-
 many and East Berlin.
 While the Soviet Kommand-
 atura in East Berlin continues
 its normal activities at Karls-
 horst, a Soviet pamphlet, com-
 menting on the Soviet note of
 27 November, explicitly stated
 that the Kommandatura would be
 closed down and the guard troops
 attached to it withdrawn from
 the city as part of the Soviet
 handover of its functions to
 East Germans.  American of-
 ficials note that the USSR is

 MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS
 Although Iraqi Prime Min-
 ister Qasimes speech on 6 Jan-
 uary implied that students and
 other elements who have en-
 gaged in street demonstrations
 should get back to work and
 that the role of the Communist-
 dominated Popular Resistance
 Force (PRF) should be limited,
 his words seem to have had
 "little effect.   Street clashes
 have continued; the pro-UAR
 "nationalists" have had the:l
 better .of it ;t?iA M6sul;in'r orth-
 ern Iraq but are the underdogs
 elsewhere in the country. The
 port of Basra, where a mob be-
 seiged the army garrison early
 in December, remains a hotbed
 of radical agitation and of
 demands that the PRF be given
 arms.
 Qasim on 14 January an-
 swered this agitation with a
 decree which declares that the
 PRF functions only under the
 command of the army and only in
 wartime or specified emergency
 conditions.   Members must be
 in a special uniform,?and carry
 documentation when, on duty. The
 Communist press in Baghdad has
 not printed or referred to this
 decree, which most probably is a
 result of army-pressure 'on !Qasim.
 The newspaper war between
 Cairo and Baghdad appears to
 have subsided somewhat, although
 pro-Communist and UAR-subsidized
 papers in Beirut are still vio-
 lently assailing each other.

 Communist campaign reportedly

 cial centers, such as Alexandria
 and Aleppo, nevertheless continue
 to indicate a thoroughgoing:_
 sweep which has brought in a
 number of leading,Communist
 intellectuals as well as party
 activists.
 In Syria the campaign has
 even touched some of Interior
 Minister Sarraj's own subordi-
 nates, and his passports con-
 trol officer and the secretary
 general of the Interior Minis-
 try, who was responsible for
 police and secutity affairs,
 have .,:~~bee a~: ;r.emoved,,!,'.fi"om  their
 posts.   The latter official,
 known for his Communist sympa-
 thiea,: was chief prosecutor
 during the so-called "American
 conspiracy" trials in 1957.
 Sarraj went to Cairo for an
 interview with Nasir on 11 Jan-
 uary.
 Although overshadowed by
 the developments in UAR-Iraqi
 relations and by the UAR anti-
 Communist effort, Cairo's hos-
 tility toward pro-Western gov-
 ernments in the area appears
 unabated.   Cairo radio continues
 vitriolic attacks on Tunisian
 President Bourguiba, promising
 that the Arab people will even-
 tually deal with him and imply-
 ing that he will share the fate
 of Nuri Said.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 15 January 1959
 Cambodian Premier Sihanouk
 has been apprised of plotting
 by South Vietnam and Thailand
 to overthrow his neutralist
 regime.  Charges of American
 involvement have been made by
 the Chinese Communist Embassy
 in Phnom Penh, which sounded
 the initial warning to Sihanouk
 of the gathering threat against
 him.  The French ambassador, who
 also discussed the reported plots
 with Sihanouk, warned against
 the Communist allegations and
 urged caution in taking counter-
 measures so as to avoid inter-
 national repercussions.  Rupture
 of relations with South Vietnam
 seems an immediate prospect.
 Sihanouk reportedly is
 considering an accord with
 Peiping for the stationing of
 Chinese Communist troops in
 Cambodia to forestall efforts
 to unseat him.   Sihanouk has
 claimed to have received a
 standing offer of direct support
 for his regime when he visited
 Peiping last August.   He is
 aware, however, that acceptance
 of even token Communist mili-
 tary aid would jeopardize con-
 tinued American assistance,
 and would risk alienating the
 anti-Communist Cambodian Army.
 Unless driven by despera-
 tion, Sihanouk will probably
 stop short of such measures,
 but might enter into some form
 of mutual defense pact with
 Peiping to intimidate his foes.
 He is likely, however, to de-
 nounce the plotting against him
 as Western-inspired efforts to
 draw Cambodia into SEATO, and
 will probably portray it as a
 threat to destroy the monarchy..
 South Vietnam and Thailand
 strongly feel that Sihanouk's
 accommodation with the Communist
 bloc menaces their own security,
 and they would like to see him
 removed from leadership in Cam-
 bodia.   Opponents of Sihanouk,

 15 January 1959
 Ngoc Thanh  and royal councilor
 Sam Sary,are meeting increasing-
 ly sympathetic response in Bang-
 kok and Saigon in their intrigues
 against Sihanouk.
 In  Thailand,   there  are
 growing indications that Mar-
 shal Sarit is not exercising
 full control over governmental
 affairs.
 Sarit's juniors in the
 ruling military group hesitate
 to fill the leadership vacuum,
 however, probably fearing that
 in one of his occasional mo-
 ments of effectiveness Sarit
 might suddenly turn on them.
 The lesson of Sarit's summary
 execution of a number of.sus-
 pected Chinese arsonists has
 doubtless not been lost on them.
 The Laotian National As-
 sembly on 14 January granted
 Prime Minister Phoui Sanani-
 kone   full governmental powers
 for 12 months to meet what he
 terms ,a situation of "national
 danger" stemming from internal
 subversion and external pres-
 sures.from North Vietnam.  In
 essence, the assembly voted
 approval of Phoui's program
 and assured him a year to im-
 plement it in which he will
 be unfettered by assembly pres-
 sures.   He will also be able
 to reorganize his government
 as he sees fit.   As part of his
 program, Phoui will ask the
 crown to appoint a commission
 to study revision of the con-
 stitution, with emphasis pre-
 sumably on strengthening the
 powers of the executive at the
 expense of the legislature.
 The conservative Laotian
 politicians probably voted the
 special powers to Phoui reluc-~.
 tantly,with the realization
 that the alternative to Phoui
 might have been an outright
 military coup.   Phoui, however,
 has sweetened the bitter pill
 by promising a number of gov-
 ernment sinecures to idled con-
 versative deputies.   Phoui is
 reportedly thinking in terms
 of a 12-man cabinet, including
 four young reformers from the
 Committee for Defense of Na-
 tional Interests, two senior
 army officers, and six pol-
 iticians from conservative ranks.
 The considerable jockeying
 for position that almost cer-
 tainly will accompany selection
 of a cabinet could lead to fric-
 tion between Phoui and his army
 supporters, especially if Phoui
 attempts to pack  the cabinet
 with members of his family.
 While three ineffectual members
 of the present cabinet will
 probably be dropped, there is
 a possibility that Defense and

 Laos' Communist-dominated
 Neo Lao Hak Zat (NLHZ) party
 has been extremely apprehensive
 over the prospect of govern-
 ment suppression, and many of
 its supporters have taken cover
 on the North Vietnamese border.
 Phoui's repeated. assurances that
 the legal status of the NLHZ
 would be recognized appears to
 have had some effect, since all
 NLHZ deputies were present in
 Vientiane for the special as-

 The adamant attitude of the
 Soviet negotiators at the annual
 Soviet-Japanese fishery negotia-

 12 January suggests that the
 USSR will propose increased re-
 strictions on Japanese fishing
 next year in the North Pacific

 Soviet radiobroadcasts to

 and egg products--usually suf-
 fers during Peiping's big cam-
 paigns, the shortages appear
 to be somewhat more severe this
 year and could become a major
 source of irritation among the
 people at a time when the re-
 gime is stepping up its de-
 mands on their time and energy.
 there is a reported shortage of
 rice and flour in Peiping;
 sweet potatoes have been sub-
 stituted to make up the deficit,
 but is doubtful  that the Chi-
 nese will regard them as an
 adequate replacement.
 Transportation difficul-
 ties have added to the problem.
 The high priority assigned the
 iron and steel campaign has
 disrupted the normal flow of
 agricultural goods, and there
 are numerous accounts of farm
 produce being piled up at trans-
 portation terminals.
 The shortages may be partly
 attributable to distribution
 shortcomings, and Peiping's eco-
 nomic planners would not neces-
 sarily feel compelled to in-
 crease the consumer's share of
 food and textiles in direct pro-
 portion to claimed gains.
 The food shortages are poor
 advertising, however, for the
 "leap forward" and the new
 commune system. So-called
 secondary foods are important
 to the Chinese diet, and the
 shortages, coming as they do
 after months of very hard work
 and on the heels of a big prop-
 aganda campaign about tremendous
 production increases, must be    25X1
 exceedingly irritating to the
 Chinese.
 The recently announced in-
 crease of about one third in this
 year's cotton cloth ration will
 act as a balm to sooth the con-
 sumer, but it should be noted
 that the measure only restores
 cuts made in 1957 and that the
 ration now is back to the ap-
 proximate level of 1956, when
 production of raw cotton was
 only 1,500,000 tons.   This year's
 crop is claimed by the regime
 to have reached 3,350,000 tons.
 significant production increases
 in basic foods, grains, and cot-
 ton were probably achieved. De-
 spite these successes, imbalances
 and shortages, whatever their
 causes, have an important im-
 pact on the living standard
 of the average Chinese.
 The Chinese Communists
 are    reviving  the  theme  of
 "learning from the Soviet Union
 in building socialism"--a line
 not prominently mentioned in
 China during most of 1958.This
 display of deference to the So-
 viet example is another step in
 Peiping's modification of its
 earlier claims of a rapid ad-
 vance toward Communism, and sug-
 gests that China will avoid
 further public statements imply-
 ing its "road" is basically dif-
 ferent from the one already
 traveled by the USSR.   The com-

 Peiping's wiilingness.to
 drop some of its own and reaf-
 firm the USSR's doctrinal cri-
 teria for "building socialism"
 is demonstrated in the party's
 18 December resolution on com-
 munes.  The resolution declares
 the communes are a form of col-
 lective ownership--therefore a
 stage of socialist development--
 rather than the complete state
 ownership of the ultimate Com-
 munist stage, as was implied
 by some Chinese commentators
 last summer.  Thus ownership
 in China's countryside is sim-
 ilar, in theory at least, to So-
 viet rural ownership.  The 18
 December resolution also ac-
 knowledges the correctness of
 Soviet doctrine by stressing
 that China would be building
 socialism for a decade or more
 and could begin the "transition
 to Communism" only on the basis
 of highly developed modern in-
 dustry, agriculture, science,
 and culture--all prerequisites
 recently emphasized by the So-
 viet Union.
 ;led. F`` az _,-,, the top theoreti-
 cal journalof the Chinese Com-

 called for "conscientious study"
 of Khrushchev's Seven-Year Plan
 and the "brilliant example" of
 Soviet experience in building
 socialism and Communism.  The
 article characterized the cur-
 rent Soviet program as convinc-
 ing proof the USSR is the "core"
 of the bloc and of the internal
 tional Communist movement.  On
 5 January People's Daily de-
 scribed Chinas  ig  coal out-
 put as a victory attained "after
 serious study of advanced So-

 These Chinese gestures of
 conciliation follow indications

 feels Soviet good will is too
 valuable to be risked for an
 ideological position.  Chinese
 leaders apparently expect Mos-
 cow to assert vigorously its
 claim to doctrinal pre-eminence
 during the forthcoming Soviet
 21st party congress.   Peiping's
 chief delegate to it probably
 will find occasion to offer
 further remarks on the need for
 unity and the value of the So-
 viet experience.
 Peiping's long-standing
 claim that the translation of
 Soviet experience to Chinese
 conditions constantly requires
 new methods of application prob-
 ably will continue, however,
 with such "creative" activity
 attributed to Mao Tse-tung. For-
 eign Minister Chen Yi suggested
 as much last month when he told
 members-of the Peiping diplo-
 matic corps that Mao will con-
 centrate on ideological and pol-
 icy matters, particularly with
 respect to underdeveloped areas.
 In any doctrinal theses Mao
 publishes in the near future
 as a result of these studies,
 he may avoid insisting his gen-
 eralizations were applicable be-
 yond China, while permitting
 his audience to draw its own
 conclusions.
 THE NEW SOVIET VOLUNTEER WORKERS' MILITIA
 Volunteer workers' militia
 detachments are  being  formed
 in the USSR as. civilian auxil-
 iaries to the                   regular  police
 (militia).  This movement, which
 began in Leningrad last Novem-
 ber,   has                 now spread to Riga,
 Rostov-on-Do,n,  Yakutsk,  and
 other localities in the USSR.
 Its primary, purpose appears to
 be the strengthening   of  the
 SECRET
 campaign against drunkards and
 hooligans, with whom the mili-
 tia apparently has been unable
 to cope.   Ideological support
 had been given to this develop-
 ment by describing it as an ex-
 ercise in preparation for the
 "withering away of the state,"
 at which time the functions of
 the state will be performed by
 the general citizenry.

 The concept of volunteer
 aides to the regular police is
 not new in the USSR.   Brigades
 to assist the militia were
 created in the 1930s to supple-
 ment the ranks of the police
 in providing protection on
 special occasions--such as
 parades--or in carrying out
 special assignments.   The chief
 of the Leningrad Militia Admin-
 istration, describing the new
 development, stated that it
 would not be the same, however.
 He did not elaborate further,
 except to say that many details
 about the organization of the
 volunteer militia were still
 unclear:.   One difference is
 that the new organization is
 apparently carrying out regular
 patrols rather than awaiting
 calls for duty on special oc-
 casions.
 The Soviet youth organi-
 zation Komsomol since the war
 has also been called on to
 supply brigades to round up
 hooligans and drunkards and
 generally ride herd on the more
 irrepressible.; young people
 Articles in the press on Kom-
 somol activities, however, re-
 veal that the youth organization
 has not been altogether success-
 ful in carrying out this mission.
 The new volunteer militia
 detachments, with more stable
 and mature personnel, may be
 designed to accomplish what the
 Komsomols have been unable to
 do,    Only "the best of the best,
 the most authoritative and
 proved comrades,  are to be en-
 rolled in the new detachments.
 The members are expected to
 influence their friends and
 associates through example and
 education, thus helping to pre-
 vent violations of the law.
 Although the original
 impetus for the formation of
 the detachments came from Len-
 ingrad, it appears that Ryazan,
 a city about 100 miles south-
 east of Moscow, with more than
 1,000 volunteers, will be the
 first city to have them in
 large-scale operation.   Tenta-
 tive plans call for a detach-
 ment of 300 to 500 men, sub-
 divided into brigades and groups,
 for each rayon in Ryazan.
 Guidance will be given the de-
 tachments by councils composed
 of representatives of the rayon
 party committee, the executive
 committee, the trade unions,
 the Komsomol, and the regular
 police.
 The detachments, commanded
 by persons elected by the mem-
 bers themselves, are to pre-
 serve order on streets and
 streetcars, in stores and clubs,
 and to apprehend "anti-social"
 elements.   The regular police,
 however, will retain the primary
 responsibility for the inves-
 tigation and apprehension of
 criminal elements.
 The workers' militiamen
 will serve in their leisure
 hours, without pay, and will
 carry arms.   Eventually all
 will be uniformed or wear badges;
 for the present, however, red
 armbands will identify them.

 Moscow probably hopes to

 a more complete record of its
 desire for agreement--in the
 form of conference-approved
 draft articles on noncontro-

 intended to create the false
 impression of progress, which
 would transfer to a subsequent
 portion
 of the

 a Western-proposed
 article
 with which Moscow dis-
 agreed,

 stripping the
 article
 of any

 CUBAN COMMUNIST GAINS
 The Cuban Communists,
 whose party was outlawed by
 Batista in 1953, have been
 making rapid gains since his
 fall and have been exerting a
 special effort to influence
 the labor movement.   Provi-
 sional President Urrutia and
 the leading members of his
 cabinet are anti-Communist
 but seem unlikely to take de-
 cisive action against the Com-
 munists' Popular Socialist
 party (PSP).   Fidel Castro,
 commander of the armed forces
 and dominant figure in the new
 regime, has declared that the
 PSP now will be permitted le-
 gal status, "since freedom of
 political action is guaranteed
 by the constitution." "Che"
 Guevara, a leftist colleague
 of Castro's who now controls
 an army fort in Havana, went
 further than his chief and
 said he would not oppose Com-
 munist participation in the
 government.
 The PSP, with a member-
 ship estimated at 8,000 to
 12,000, surfaced immediately
 after Batista's fall and suc-
 ceeded-in naming five repre-
 sentatives to a 22-man "na-
 tional labor committee" which
 intends to reorganize the po-
 litically important labor
 movement completely.   The party
 has opened at least two offices
 in Havana and one in Santiago,
 has resumed publication of its
 daily newspaper Hoy,and held
 a public rally inavana on 10
 January.   Exiled Cuban Commu-
 nists, including the dynamic
 labor leader Lazaro Pena, have
 returned to the island, as
 have a number of Venezuelan
 and Dominican Communists.
 Active opposition to Com-
 munism may be developing in
 the labor movement, probably
 the Communists' main target
 and one in which they already
 have. formidable assets.   David.
 Salvador, head of the national
 committee for reorganizing the
 labor movement, is believed to
 be anti-Communist_   He is close
 to Fidel Castro
 ro-
 as ro  abor organizers expect
 to dominate most unions through
 elections planned in each union
 in the near future and claim
 their objective is to replace
 all Communists now holding
 union office.
 Meanwhile, professional
 revolutionaries of all political
 views in the Caribbean area are
 looking to the new Cuban Gov-
 ernment for support in their
 aim of ousting area dictator-
 ships. "General" Miguel Angel
 Ramirez, non-Communist Domin-
 ican exile, arrived in Cuba on
 5 January.   He is chief of the
 now inactive Caribbean Legion    25X1

 finance; in his conversation
 with Qasim he discussed Soviet

 plan for economic development.

 Maletin and Qasim report-

 of developing metallurgical
 and machine-building enter-
 prises and of establishing
 light industrial concerns,fac-
 tories for processing agricul-
 tural produce, and mineral
 fertilizer plants. They also
 reportedly discussed possible
 Soviet assistance to Iraq in
 conducting geological surveys,
 remodeling Iraqi ports, and
 organizing river navigation
 services.
 Although there have been
 no specific references to So-
 viet offers of credits thus
 far, it is likely that Moscow
 will soon offer financial aid
 to Baghdad.   The present Iraqi
 regime inherited an ambitious
 but reasonable economic de-
 velopment program from its
 predecessor, but Qasim is anx-
 ious to promote development
 projects--possibly including
 a steel mill--which have a more
 immediate impact on the popu-
 lace than those of the old gov-
 ernment.
 The projects called for
 under the former government's
 program were essentially organ-
 ized and managed by Western
 concerns,  but these companies
 have recently been discouraged
 from implementing their proj-
 ects or bidding on new ones.
 Thus the door is left open for

 ably financial assistance from

 Unlike many other under-
 developed countries, Iraq has
 a steady and abundant earner
 of hard currencies in its pri-
 mary export--oil, which accounts
 for nearly 90 percent of export;
 revenues.   In 1958 Iraq earned
 about $235,000,000 in royalties
 from the Western oil companies
 operating there. Baghdad is
 thus in a position to pay cash
 for much of its development
 program.   It is possible, how-
 ever,  that revenues and cash
 reserves will not be sufficient
 to cover expanded economic de-
 velopments.   In addition,  Iraq
 must pay for its normal imports
 --which reached about $280,000-
 000 last year--and the $170,000-
 000 Soviet arms aid program.
 Since the formation of
 the new Iraqi-Government in
 July,  the Sino-Soviet bloc,
 which has made substantial arms
 shipments to Baghdad, has also
 made a concentrated effort to
 develop economic as well as
 political relations in order
 to underscore  its endorsement.
 Practically all the members of
 the bloc have already concluded
 trade agreements with Iraq, and
 Bulgaria is presently negotiat-
 ing one in Baghdad.   Most of
 these pacts suggest that the
 bloc countries' exports to Iraq
 will exceed their imports. In ad-

 two of Leopoldville's African

 the increased Congolese contacts

 NEW FRENCH MOVES ON ALGERIA
 Despite General de Gaulle's
 public position that a political
 solution for Algeria is to be
 delayed pending progress toward
 economic and social development,
 French propaganda and behind-
 the-scenes moves appear aimed
 at early negotiations with the
 rebels.   While rebel leaders
 remain distrustful of Paris,
 settler apprehensions over De
 Gaulle's intentions are becoming
 more outspoken, and any evidence
 that rebel desires for inde-
 pendence are actively being dis-
 cussed will arouse violent re-
 action.
 De Gaulle is impelled to
 try to ease the drain of the
 Algerian war in order not to
 jeopardize his austerity pro-
 gram.   Italian Premier Fanfani
 made a quick trip to Paris im-
 mediately after returning from
 Cairo as an intermediary between
 Paris and Egyptian President
 Nasir, if not the rebel leaders
 themselves.   In December, De
 Gaulle asked Fanfani to sound
 out Nasir on Algeria, and Finance
 Minister Pinay made a "flying
 trip" to Rome the day before
 the Italian premier took off for
 Cairo.
 A spokesman for the Algerian
 provisional government said he
 had reason to believe De Gaulle
 would follow up the clemency
 movement for rebels announced
 on 12 January by quietly launch-
 ing a new formula for a political
 solution.  He expects this to
 be a call for round-table talks
 involving the recently elected
 Algerian deputies and Messali
 Hadj's  Algerian National Move-
 ment as well as the Algerian
 National Liberation Front.   De
 Gaulle probably would refuse to
 consider the "government's' rep-
 resentat iOn . as  such,   but the
 FLN  name  would  not  be ob-
 jectionable to him.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 15 January 1959
 Paris probably intended
 the clemency measures to be a
 show of strength. which would
 discourage rebel leaders, but
 there is no indication that the
 rebels are inclined to abandon
 their position on negotiations.
 Despite waning military effec-
 tiveness, the rebels seem dis-
 posed to step up their attacks
 --at least in the form of ter-
 rorism, which rose sharply last
 week after a considerable lull.
 They fear French efforts to di-
 vide the Moslem factions, but
 they maintain that a cease-fire
 could be quickly arranged if
 Paris seemed tacitly committed
 to eventual independence for
 Algeria.
 De Gaulle's failure to
 name Jacques Soustelle premier
 and his continued reference to
 association rather then inte-
 gration of Algeria with France
 appear finally to have convinced
 extremist elements among the
 settlers that De Gaulle is "un-
 reliable."  Veterans' organiza-
 tions in Algeria have criticized
 him openly for the first time,
 and the settlers have formed a
 new political organizatipn,
 Movement for French Algeria, in
 an effort to regroup the frag-
 mented committees of public
 safety.
 They are certain to

 efforts again to win
 military
 support and to exert
 pressure
 on both Delegate

 so far, for five days controlled
 the land approaches to the port
 of Alhucemas. As of 13 January
 the roads leading to this city
 were still not considered safe,
 despite assurances in the Moroc-
 can press that all points of
 agitation had been eliminated.
 Whatever the government's
 gains, they may have been won
 at the cost of permanently
 alienating at least some of the
 important Berber tribes in-
 habiting the Rif. Concern, on
 this score appears to be re-
 flected in numerous statements
 by Moroccan authorities--in-
 cluding Crown Prince Moulay
 Hassan,  who personally directed
 army operations in the Rif--
 minimizing the significance of
 the clashes between Berber par-.
 tisans and security forces and
 insisting that the Royal Army
 at  no  time  initiated  any
 exchange of fire and has been
 carrying  out  more : of an
 administrative and educational
 than a military mission.
 In any event, some dis-
 sident elements will almost
 certainly continue their re-

 EFFECTS OF CEYLON'S AGREEMENTS WITH SINO-SOVIET BLOC
 Ceylon's contacts with the
 Sino-Soviet bloc have expanded
 only slowly since the c,onclusiork
 of its trade, aid, and cultural
 pacts with Peiping and Moscow
 in late 1957 and early 1958.
 Colombo has lagged in utilizing
 the Sino-Soviet economic develop-
 ment loans, and efforts to spur'
 trade and cultural exchanges have
 originated primarily in the
 USSR and Communist China.
 The Ceylonese Government's
 tardiness does not reflect a

 to maintain friendly relations-

 private trade with Communist
 China and the USSR were lifted
 about a year ago, although the
 government still handles the
 substantially reduced rice-
 rubber trade with Peiping.   The
 bloc subsequently intensified
 its efforts to attract private
 Ceylonese traders.   In March the
 Chinese Communists held a rel-
 atively successful commodity
 exhibition with the prime pur-
 pose of inducing local importers
 to buy Chinese goods.   The USSR
 may be planning to hold a trade
 fair in Colombo within the next
 several months.   Such efforts
 apparently have not yet resulted
 in a corresponding increase in
 Ceylon's total trade with the
 bloc, however.
 The Ceylonese-Soviet cul-
 tural agreement thus far has
 proved a more successful means
 of increasing Communist contacts
 with Ceylon than have the aid
 and trade agreements.   Moscow
 and Peiping have sent a rela-
 tively steady flow of cultural
 delegations and materials to the
 island.  A few Ceylonese groups
 and individuals visited tb:: bloc
 in 1958, but the number of
 Communist invitations and
 delegations to the island ex-
 ceeded those sent by Ceylon.
 The Ceylonese people presum-
 ably enjoy such attention, but
 bloc overtures have not yet
 significantly lessened the
 value Ceylon attaches to its
 relationships with the  Common-
 wealth and the free world.

 "ocent statements by Indian

 the challenge of China's "giant.

 appears to have reached this

 over the outlays likely between
 1956 and 1961.
 A plan of this size is
 beyond India's financial capac-
 ity,; particularly in view of
 the low level of foreign ex-
 change reserves and the large
 foreign obligations that fall
 due during 1961-66.  The extent
 of the difficulty the country
 will face, however, will depend
 on whether the plan concentrates
 on agricultural development or
 calls for sharp increases in in-
 dustrial as well as agricultural
 production.   If, as seems like-
 ly, New Delhi decides to follow
 the latter course, it will prob-
 ably face a foreign exchange gap
 of several billion dollars.
 While the Ministry of Finance,
 which is opposed to such a
 large plan, may succeed in cut-
 ting its goals somewhat, present
 indications are that Nehru in-
 tends to increase economic de-
 velopment outlays substantially,
 counting on Western and Soviet
 bloc interest in India to result
 fulfill the plan.
 FINLAND'S NEW GOVERNMENT
 The minority Agrarian
 government, finally formed by
 V. J. Sukselainen on 13 January
 ending the cabinet crisis which
 began with the resignation of
 the five-party Fagerholm coal-
 ition on 4 December, has as its
 chief task the normalizing of
 trade and political relations
 with the USSR--a problem made
 more urgent by Finland's growing
 economic difficulties.  The
 Sukselainen government may be
 forced  to depend on the combined
 votes of the Communist-front
 Finnish People's Democratic
 League (SKDL) and the splinter
 Opposition Social Democrats.
 The USSR, displeased with
 the ',rightist and pro-Western
 character" of the previous five-
 party government of Karl August
 Fagerholm, exerted strong eco_
 nanic pressure on Finland by cur-
 tailing trade and payments.
 This pressure, coupled with the
 political maneuvering of the
 Agrarians, resulted in Fager-
 holm's resignation on 4 December.
 As late as 7 January Izvestia
 accused "rightist Social Demo-
 crats" of trying to divert Fin-
 land from the "Paasikivi-   Kek-
 konen line of friendship with
 the USSR" and warned against
 seeking Western trade and cre-
 dits.
 There is no indication as
 yet that the suspended trade
 payments have been resumed, and
 as of 3 January the USSR had
 still made no moves regarding
 any intergovernmental negoti-
 ations, including a trade agree-
 ment for 1959.  Finnish officials
 apparently hope that Moscow will
 be reluctant to damage permanent-
 ly the image of Finland as a
 showpiece of "exemplary" relations

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 PRESIDENT FRONDIZI'S PROBLEMS IN ARGENTINA
 During his seven turbulent
 months in office, Argentine
 President Frondizi has taken a
 number of bold steps to counter
 a decade of severe economic de-
 terioration and to reduce deep-
 seated political animosities,
 although aware that over the
 short run some of these steps
 would feed discontent in most
 sectors, according to the in-
 terests affected.   Frondizi,
 who will visit the United States
 from 19 January to 1February,
 warned that two years of "hard
 times and sacrifice" were ahead
 for all Argentines when he
 initiated on 1 January an aus-
 terity and monetary
 stabilization pro-
 gram which will be
 backed by some
 $329,000,000 in for-
 eign credits, mainly
 from the United
 States.
 Opposition
 groups have already
 attacked the program,
 raising strong
 doubts regarding
 Frondizi's ability
 to carry it out. The
 Peronistas,  whose
 attention is par-
 ticularly focused on
 the present labor
 union elections, have
 denounced the plan as "condemn-
 ing the nation to the yoke of
 foreign capitalism" and a be-
 trayal of the promises on
 which they backed Frondizi's
 election last February.
 Economic Problems
 Argentina's serious eco-
 nomic situation has its roots
 in problems which have been
 intensifying over the past 10
 years: accelerating inflation,
 a declining rate of productiv-
 ity,             a nearly empty treasury,
 and a large foreign debt, When
 World War II ended,  Argentina
 had little foreign debt and
 $1.6 billion in gold and for-
 eign exchange reserves; but by
 last December the external
 debt had passed a billion dol-
 lars and reserves had fallen
 to only $148,000,000.
 From 1948 to 1957 per cap-
 ita gross national product de-
 clined nearly 1 percent a year,
 since the rise in GNP was only
 14 percent, at 1950 prices,
 compared with arise of 22 per-
 cent in population.   During
 this period,  living costs rose
 about 600 percent and in 1958
 another 48 percent.
 Reduced domestic cap-
 ital formation and
 negligible foreign
 investment prevented
 adequate moderniza-
 tion or expansion of
 capital equipment.
 Despite severe import
 restrictions, trade
 deficits have been
 chronic,  reaching
 $340,000,000 in 1957
 and an estimated
 $250,000,000 in 1958.
 To counteract
 this fundamental dis-
 equilibrium, Frondizi
 laid the groundwork
 for his basic stabi-
 lization program by taking steps
 to resolve a number of problems
 affecting Argentina's credit
 standing with European countries.
 The Frondizi-controlled Congress
 also ratified actions in this
 field which had already been
 taken by the provisional Aram-
 buru regime.
 Another preparatory step
 was Frondizi's oil policy an-
 nounced on 24.July calling for
 the participation of foreign
 companies in the development
 of Argentina's oil resources
 on a contract basis,   The

 somewhat and reduce the appeal
 of politically motivated strikes,
 the government plans to allow
 moderate wage increases and
 then to freeze wages for one
 or two years.
 Argentina's plans for the
 program include institution of
 a single fluctuating exchange
 rate,  taxes on both exports and
 imports, and the cessation of
 trade discrimination against
 various trading areas of the
 world.   Priority attention is
 to be given to the reduction
 of government deficits--both
 federal and provincial--which
 have been the principal cause
 of inflation.   Excess person-
 nel are to be released, pro-
 cedures streamlined, and sub-
 sidies terminated for govern-
 ment-owned industries and
 services, such as railways and
 petroleum.   Public works not
 immediately aiding economic im-
 provement are to be postponed.
 By these measures and modest
 tax reforms,  the government
 hopes its 1958-59 deficit will
 be less than a third of the
 preceding deficit,  estimated
 at about $800,000,000.
 Other measures include
 strict credit control and tem-
 porary price controls on a few
 essential commodities, but
 prices for most consumer goods
 are rising in seeking their
 own level.   In view of wide-
 spread complaints over these
 rises,  Frondizi has warned he
 will prosecute price gougers;
 and, acting independently, a
 congressional investigation
 committee has closed down a
 number of shops for profiteer-
 ing.   To soften the impact
 Within the room for ma-
 neuver created by political
 pressures,  Frondizi has moved
 to carry out his campaign
 promises,  which emphasized
 the need for improved living
 conditions, economic develop-
 ment with foreign investment,
 the rule of law, and "national
 reconciliation," with amnesty
 for all those Peronistas not
 charged with serious crimes.
 The Peronista attack against
 his program is characteristic
 of the deep-seated political
 divisions within the country
 and the widely varying reac-
 tions to most of Frondizi's
 moves.
 These have caused him some
 loss of popularity and will
 continue to be an inhibiting
 factor in carrying out eco-
 nomic and political reforms.
 The major opposition People's
 Radical party, which split
 from Frondizi's Intransigent
 Radicals before the elections,
 is following a policy of oppo-?
 sition on all issues and ac-
 cuses Frondizi of abandoning
 the nationalistic Radical plat-
 form he used to fight Peron.
 The Communist party,  which
 urged its 80,000 to 90,000
 members to vote for Frondizi,
 has also declared its strong
 opposition to the government
 and has organized neighbor-
 hood committees to protest
 high living costs.
 Frondizi's principal polit-
 ical concern at present,  how-
 ever,  is Peronista pressure
 through labor,  especially in
 view of strong wage complaints.
 Frondizi apparently considers
 it essential to detach Peron-
 ista support from Peron if

 labor measures,  however,  the
 Peronistas have increased
 strike pressure against Fron-
 dizi's policies, and their
 protest strike against his
 petroleum policies resulted in
 the declaration of a state of
 siege on 11 November. Possibly
 because of dissatisfaction over
 living conditions, the Peron-
 istas appear to have gained
 strength during the past sev-
 eral months, although there is
 still disunity among Peronista
 leaders.
 In accordance with Peron's
 orders from his exile in the
 Dominican Republic,  the Peron-
 istas will compete in several
 provincial elections next March
 but under the Justicialista par-
 ty label, since the Peronista
 party remains outlawed. This
 will be the first test of rela-
 tive popularity between Fron-
 dizi and the Peronista party.

 While Frondizi and the
 military were suspicious of
 one another last May, the armed
 forces now appear to have be-
 come more closely identified
 with him--if only temporarily.
 This probably stems not only
 from their support of him
 (luring the confusion result-
 ing in Vice President Gomez'
 resignation on 18 November but
 also from their strong endorse-
 ment of his crackdown on Peron-
 ista and Communist agitation.
 Despite adverse popular reac-
 tion, Frondizi will probably
 retain the state of siege dur-
 ing the initial stages of the
 stabilization program.
 Frondizi, anticipating
 an adverse political reaction,
 has warned that he will fight
 any obstacle to his program.
 Strengthening his stand are
 his apparently strong mil-
 itary support, his personal
 determination,  and consider-
 able support in informed cir-
 cles.   If successful, the
 program should strengthen Ar-
 gentina's trade and friendly
 relations with the United
 States and have a favorable

 CURRENT INTE'LLI`GENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 15 January 1959
 Renewed discussion about
 the present and future role of
 the collective farm has        been
 provoked in the USSR by attempts
 to provide a theoretical "basis"
 for the abolition last spring
 of the machine tractor stations
 which, with the  state  farms,
 were long considered the  ad-
 vanced posts of Communism                    in
 the Soviet countryside.   The ex-
 position of Soviet thinking on
 the subject has gone on against
 the background of developments
 in Communist China, where the
 commune has been represented as
 an advance over the collective
 farm.
 Chinese theorists, in the
 first flush of enthusiasm, had
 described the commune as a'large.
 step toward the traditional. Marx-
 ist goals of eliminating the dis-
 tinction between the peasant and
 the urpan worker and of provid-
 ing "distribution according to
 need."  Moscow has continued to
 maintain, however, that full com-
 munization must await the achieve-
 ment of material abundance.
 The Kremlin's policy in the
 countryside calls for the "con-
 so;idation" of the collective-
 fa'm system rather than its
 elimination and for the eventual.

 15 January 1959
 transformation of rural life
 through evolutionary policies
 larded with material incentives
 rather than through violent
 changes in organization such as
 the Chinese have employed.   Al-
 though Moscow's policy toward
 the vestiges of private property
 in the collective farm--the
 private plot and privately owned
 livestock--remains cautious, it
 is clearly anticipated that the
 expansion of production and
 peasant incomes from the com-
 munal sector will gradually
 erode the private holdings.
 Economic goals--primarily
 increased production but also
 the reduction of costs and the
 transfer of labor to the facto-
 ries--will continue to have pri-
 macy over purely ideological
 objectives in Soviet agricultur-
 al policy.   It is also clear
 that the Soviet Union, recalling
 earlier unsuccessful experiments
 of its own, views the Chinese
 commune as a utopian venture.
 At the same time, Moscow
 insists that its own agricultur-
 al reforms are ideologically
 progressive.   There is little
 doubt that these reforms, no
 less than the Chinese policies,
 are intended to secure fuller
 state control over peasant ac-
 tivity and output and to trans-
 form the collective farm grad-
 ually into a "higher form of
 socialist organization"--an or-
 ganization which functions very
 much like a state farm or fac-
 tory.
 Theoretical Argument
 The ending of forced de-
 liveries from the peasant's
 private plot on 1 January 1958,
 the transfer of machinery to
 individual collectives under
 the MTS reorganization enacted
 last spring, and changes in the
 system of agricultural procure-
 ment introduced by the June
 plenum of the central committee
 evidently came as a shock to a
 good number of theorists steeped
 in orthodox Marxism-Leninism.
 On the surface,  each of
 these measures represented con-
 cessions to the collective farmer
 and ran counter to the direction
 anticipated by many Soviet the-
 orists.   Some theorists had
 supposed, for example, that the
 MTS would eventually absorb the
 collective farm, rather than
 the reverse; others had fore-
 seen the direct conversion of
 the cooperatively based collec-
 tives into fully state-owned
 farms.   In doctrinaire terms,
 the MTS reorganization meant
 the transfer of "means of pro-
 duction" from state to coopera-
 tive ownership.
 Khrushchev,  in his MTS
 theses issued last February,
 conceded that "some comrades,
 chiefly economists, expressed
 their anxiety lest the sale of
 technical equipment to collec-
 tive farms should cause a weak-
 ening in national public owner-
 ship.   The problem was also
 raised as to which form of so-
 cialist agriculture is the more
 progressive--collective farms
 or state farms?...   Some com-
 rades suggested that perhaps
 one should transfer collective
 farms to the state-farm system.
 Khrushchev asserted in re-
 buttal that between ' the collective
 and state ;farm there _were
 differences of degree but not
 of kind;  although the state farm
 is a "higher"-form, both are
 genuinely socialist forms. There-
 fore, he stated, the correct
 course is to "raise gradually
 the level of socialization of
 collective-farm ownership and
 bring it up to the level of na-
 tional ownership.   This can be
 done only through a further
 thorough consolidation and de-
 velopment of both state- and
 collective-farm ownerships."
 Elaborated in various ways by
 lesser spokesmen,  Khrushchev's
 remarks appear to provide not
 only the theoretical rationali-
 zation for current agricultural
 organization but some indication
 of its future development as
 well.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE SUMKAR'Y
 15 January 1959
 State vs. Collective Farms
 The number of state farms
 and the total size of their
 holdings have been substantial-
 ly increased by the development
 of the "new lands."   The pro-
 portion of state farms has also
 risen in other areas, where in-
 stances of the conversion of
 collectives into state farms
 continue to occur.   Moreover,
 the regime has recently decreed
 that networks of vegetable- and
 fruit-producing state farms are
 to be set up to supply the USSR's
 major cities.   Their operation
 will inevitably strike directly
 at the private plot,  from which
 hitherto these commodities prin-
 cipally came.
 Whatever the cumulative
 effect of these developments
 might be, however, regime spokes -
 men emphatically insist that
 the future of the collectives
 will be determined not by their
 wholesale conversion into state
 farms, but by changes in the
 internal and external structure
 of the collective, which will
 eventually render it essentially
 identical with the state farm.
 The regime's organizational
 objective with regard to the
 collectives is to strengthen the
 communal sector at the expense
 of the private, primarily through
 envelopment tactics and economic
 devices calculated to render
 private undertakings progres-
 sively less attractive.   The in-
 creased material incentives
 which Khrushchev frequently men-
 tions refer primarily to com-
 munal activity rather than to
 private, and the "strengthening"
 of collective-farm economy is
 to come from the expansion of
 communally owned capital stock.
 Expansion of capital in-
 vestment in the communal economy
 is to be effected by increasing
 the share of collective-farm in-
 come devoted to the "indivisible
 fund"--that part of the collec-
 tive farm's resources not sub-
 ject to distribution among its
 members.   It is these funds,
 regarded as socially owned prop-
 erty, to which all newly pur-
 chased machinery will belong,
 and it is on their growth that
 the party theoreticians now
 rest their claims that the col-
 lective farm contains authentic
 seeds of a future Communist
 form.
 Through the enlargement
 of these funds, the ideologists
 argue, the collective farm can
 be transformed into a form of
 public property.   Khrushchev
 made this point in his MTS
 theses, arguing that the improve-
 ment of agriculture meant "first
 of all the strengthening of col-
 lective-farm ownership,  the con-
 solidation of the indivisible
 funds....   The greater the in-
 divisible funds, the more ma-
 chinery there will be on the
 collective farms, the better
 the work will be mechanized,
 the higher labor productivity
 will be, and the quicker the
 collective economy will develop.
 The work of the collective farms,
 based on a broad application of
 modern machinery, will approach
 in its characteristics the work
 of industrial workers."
 The regime has not confined
 itself to exhortation in this
 connection.   In March 1956 the
 Collective Farm Statutes were
 amended to "allow" individual
 collective farms to establish
 their own limits for additions
 to the indivisible funds, pre-
 viously set at a minimum of 10
 percent and a maximum of 20 per-
 cent of their annual incomes.
 The press subsequently reported
 instances in-whidh collective
 farm general meetings had "de-
 cided" to increase allocations
 to the indivisible fund to any-
 where from 25 to 30 percent.
 At the March 1958 session
 of the USSR Supreme Soviet, Khru-
 shchev signaled a further step,
 Collective farms should aim, he
 said,  to put 30 or 35 percent

 of their incomes into the fund.
 }le recommended that such a;change
 in the Collective Farm Statutes
 be adopted at the Collective
 Farm Congress to be held early
 this year.
 Waning of Labor-Day System
 The regime is testing other
 measures designed to strengthen
 the purely communal sector of
 the economy and to effect that
 which, in Soviet parlance, is
 called the transition from the
 kolkhoz-cooperative property,
 stage to the higher form of na-
 tional property.
 One of the most widely dis-
 cussed and fully tested of these
 measures relates to the labor-
 day system, under which collec-
 tive farmers are paid annually
 in both money and kind on the
 basis of accumulated work-day
 units.   Various schemes for mod-
 ifying or abolishing this sys-
 tem are already in use in se-
 lected collective farms. A de-
 cree of March 1956 authorized
 advance monthly cash payments
 for work-day units earned.
 One collective farm, wide-
 ly publicized recently as a suc-
 cessful pilot model, has re-
 placed the labor-day system al-
 together with a piece-rate sys-
 tem and monthly payment in cash.
 In this collective the payment-
 in-kind has been abolished: peas -.
 ants have traditionally used
 this type of payment to trade
 on the collective-farm market
 or to feed their private live-
 stock.
 Under 'the new system the
 difference between collective
 farmers and state-farm workers
 is considerably reduced.   One
 aim of the wage system is to
 show the collective farmers
 "graphically the direct connec-
 tion between the level of pay-
 ment for their labor and the
 communal economy," and through
 such a form of "material incen-
 tives" to wean the peasant away
 from his private holdings.   A
 second objective is to facili-
 tate the introduction into the
 collective farm of cost-account-
 ing, which, by permitting a cal-
 culation of production costs,
 would result in more effective
 state and managerial control..
 The economic limitations
 of many collective farms may
 prevent the immediate, universal
 introduction of a wage system.
 Authoritative spokesmen, includ-
 ing Khrushchev, have made it
 clear, however, that the labor-.
 day system must go.   Although
 the regime has not indicated
 how and when it will act, formal
 measures to hasten the conver-
 sion apparently are imminent.
 One party official has indicated
 that the question will be raised
 at the 21st party congress later
 this month.
 Amalgamations
 Along with these attempts
 to alter the inner structure of
 the collective farms, the re-
 gime is continuing along an
 older line aimed at changing
 its character from without. The
 amalgamation of collectives is
 still going on at a rapid pace.
 Figures given by Khrushchev to
 the December plenum of the cen-
 tral committee indicate that
 the number of collective farms
 was reduced by 10,000 during
 1958--the result mainly of amal-
 gamations, presumably.
 Reconstruction of farm vil-
 lages as a means of "bringing
 the daily life of the collective
 farmers closer to the conditions
 of city life" has also recently
 received renewed emphasis.   It
 has been strongly urged as..a prof -
 ~table way of spending the col-
 lective farm'. increased com-
 munal funds and is being carried
 out in various areas.   An August
 1958 article in Izvestia on this
 theme quoted from one of Khru-

 to'.the controversial "agro-city"
 scheme, which would consolidate
 rural villages into larger units
 resembling urban centers. There

 was no specific reference to
 the "agro-city," which is not
 likely to be revived in all its
 features at this time, but it
 seems likely that Khrushchev en-
 visions substantial changes in
 the physical  layout  of villages
 and improvement in rural housing
 over a period of time through
 careful planning of new  :con-
 struction with collective farms'
 funds and labor forces.
 A newer but complementary
 approach to the goal of tying
 individual collective farms
 closer to one another and of in-
 creasing the peasant's depend-
 ence on communal undertakings
 is contained in an effort, now
 gaining momentum, to expand the
 scale of interkolkhoz coopera-
 tion.   As with the indivisible
 fund, projects of this kind--
 which include the erection of
 interkolkhoz power stations, ir-
 rigation canals, schools, hos-
 pitals, restaurants, and bak-
 eries--are officially portrayed
 as an expression of the transi-
 tion of the collective farm into
 a higher form.
 Khrushchev has called for
 an extension of such ihtorkolkhoz
 links.   Some writers, carrying
 the idea a significant step fur-
 ther, have proposed;. the,:,estab-
 lishment of collective-farm-un-
 ions with authority to coordi-
 nate the production and distri-
 bution activities of member col-
 lectives and to invest some of
 the profits of the efficient
 farms into the backward collec-
 tives.
 The peasant's private hold-
 ings of land and livestock are
 regarded as the chief mark of
 distinction between the collec-
 tive farm and more "advanced"
 forms of organization.   Because
 of the important share of farm
 output derived from this source
 and the peasants'  stubborn at-
 tachment to it,  however,  the
 private plot remains one of the
 most delicate political and eco-
 nomic problems facing the re-
 gime.
 The decree issued by the
 December plenum of the central
 committee ruled that the state-
 farm workers must surrender their
 private holdings within the next
 few years; in speaking of the
 much larger holdings of the col-
 lective farmers, however, the
 order merely expressed confidence
 that these farmers would even-
 tually see the economic wisdom
 of surrendering their holdings
 voluntarily.
 Khrushchev's native village
 of Kalinovka has been made a
 test case in this respect.  There
 the collective farm has pledged
 to move toward abandonment of
 the private plot, and the peas-
 ants have already turned their
 cows over to the communal herd
 in return for guaranteed deliv-
 eries of milk from the farm for
 their own consumption. Although
 this practice has been heavily
 encouraged"?by the Soviet press,
 the regime's hesitancy to push
 too hard is evident from a Feb-
 ruary .1958 decree of the Ukrai-
 nian central committee condemn-
 ing officials "who, under the
 guise of purchases, have forced
 collective farmers to give. their
 cows to the collective,  thereby
 grossly violating the statutes
 of the agricultural artel and
 the laws of the Soviet state?"
 Regime's General Objectives
 The collective farm, long
 the outstanding exception to
 the Marxist rule of full state
 ownership of the means of pro-
 duction, has been a persistent
 problem for the Soviet theoreti-
 cians and the most pragmatic of
 policy makers alike.   From all
 appearances,  the present party
 leadership is more concerned
 with meeting the difficult ag-
 ricultural goals it has set it-
 self than in serving pure theo-
 ry.   However, since from both
 a practical and theoretical
 point of view the collective
 farm is regarded as an imperfect

 and transitory form which even-
 tually must disappear,  recent
 steps aimed at increasing agri-
 cultural output also serve as
 new chapters in the book of
 "creative Marxism."
 The Soviet regime, despite
 its evident disapproval of the
 Chinese communes on the grounds
 of timing and method, has staked
 out a course the final aim of
 which is, similarly, the elimi-
 nation of the "differences be-

 means the conversion of the
 peasant to a political,  econom-

 worker.

 THE STATUS OF SOVIET INDUSTRIAL REORGANIZATION
 Further steps in Khrush-
 chev's evolutionary reshaping
 of Soviet economic institu-
 tions may be revealed in con-
 nection with the forthcoming
 21st party congress which is
 convening this month to launch
 the new Seven-Year Plan (1959-
 1965).   Measures affecting So-
 viet industry which might be
 taken include a redefinition
 of administrative regions,
 clearer assignments of respon-
 sibility and authority to re-
 public and regional organs for
 deciding investment alloca-
 tions, and the re-establish-
 ment of a Supreme Economic
 Council.
 Action in these fields
 would be consistent with the
 trends,  persistent problems,
 unresolved questions, and pol-
 icy tenets noted in the first
 18 months since the inaugura-
 tion of the industrial reor-
 ganization.   Although realign-
 ment of relationships within
 the chain of command between
 the controlling center and
 the producing enterprise will
 continue,  there is no indica-
 tion that the system of direct-
 ing  the economy by command is
 to be altered.
 Despite the industrial
 reorganization's present pop-
 ularity among Soviet adminis-
 trators  a   sober appraisal of
 its success to date must await
 the release of more detailed
 performance data than that
 usually contained in annual
 reports of plan fulfillment.
 Reorganization Proposals
 Khrushchev's program was
 first proposed in February
 1957, when the continued high
 rates of economic growth neces-
 sary to catch up swiftly with
 the United States were deemed
 in jeopardy.   The program
 sought to promote industrial
 expansion both by increasing
 efficiency of the administra-
 tion of production and by ex-
 ploiting hitherto untapped re-
 sources.   Coming hard on the
 heels of Pervukhin's modest
 draft for the 1957 economic
 plan and of the Hungarian cri-
 sis,  there were clear political
 overtones in the prososals
 whereby Khrushchev personally

 Local party organs were
 charged with monitoring local
 economic operations,  and eco-
 nomic officials could no longer
 effectively counter their inter-
 vention by direct recourse
 through ministerial channels
 to Moscow.   Financial and sta

 to conform to the new structure;
 statistical offices with their
 own channels with Moscow were
 established in each economic ad-
 ministrative area to provide
 the center with independent
 statistical information,  as

 centrally determined tasks were
 to be met.
 Almost simultaneously with
 the initiation of the new sys-
 tem, opposition to it and to
 Khrushchev erupted within the
 top leadership among the so-
 called "antiparty group" which,
 with an assist from a hastily
 called central committee plenum,
 Khrushchev  promptly   ousted.
 Khrushchev's personal role in
 promoting the reorganization
 scheme thus was emphasized.
 Initial Policies
 The need for avoiding dis-
 rupt ion in production operations
 was the key to policy during
 the initial phases of the re-
 organization.   The shift took
 place in the middle of the plan
 year,  thus permitting enter-
 prise operations to continue
 while adjustments were being
 made and providing the altered
 planning organs a breathing
 spell in which to get under way
