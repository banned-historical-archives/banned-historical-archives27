 Franjiyah is expected to take a hard stand
 with Asad on the issue of Palestinian intervention
 in Lebanese affairs, but has hinted he may be
 more flexible on Muslim political demands. These
 hints of concessions are probably only tactical
 moves intended to persuade Syria not to permit
 more armed Palestinians into Lebanon. Franjiyah
 will also use the temporary military advantage the
 Christians have gained through the blockades to
 press an earlier Christian proposal that any com-
 prehensive agreement be guaranteed by an inter-
 national police force that includes Saudis and
 Kuwaitis as well as Syrians.
 ANGOLA
 This week the Popular Movement for the
 Liberation of Angola advanced deep into the
 tribal heartland of the rival National Front for the
 Liberation of Angola. The Movement's gains vir-
 tually closed out the battlefront in northwestern
 Angola and opened the way for new drives
 southeast from the Movement's key positions in
 the central sector. At the special summit meeting
 of the Organization of African Unity that ended
 on January 13, the Popular Movement failed to
 win recognition as the sole legitimate govern-
 ment of Angola, but it is close to gaining formal
 acceptance by a majority of OAU members. The
 Movement continues to receive extensive
 material support from Moscow and Havana, in-
 cluding increasing numbers of Cuban combat
 troops.
 army aided the Christian militiamen who took the
 camp. In the past, the Palestinians have ex-
 aggerated the army's involvement in the fighting,
 but there is growing evidence that the army is
 now siding more openly with the Christians. Army
 units appear to be supporting Christians in Zahlah
 and in the Tripoli-Zagharta area where clashes are
 especially heavy.
 Although   the  involvement  of the
 predominantly Christian-officered army is still
 limited, it has accentuated the strictly religious
 aspects of the dispute and will provide the
 Muslims and Palestinians justification for bringing
 in more fedayeen units. If main-line Palestinian
 forces do step in, this would erode the last con-
 straints to all-out civil war.
 With the resurgence of fighting, Syria is trying
 harder to find a solution to the dispute. The
 Syrians played host this week to leading Christian
 figures and representatives of the major Lebanese
 leftist and Muslim groups in preparation for a
 meeting in Damascus between President Fran-
 jiyah and Asad this weekend.
 Military Situation
 The National Front's attempt to hold off ad-
 vancing Popular Movement forces in the north
 collapsed abruptly late last week as Front forces
 gave up one position after another and fled in
 panic toward Zaire. Ambriz, the Front's main
 headquarters in Angola since last spring, fell
 before the weekend. Toto and Bessa Monteiro
 were taken over by rapidly moving Popular
 Movement troops on January 11. Ambrizete,
 another key Front stronghold on the coast, was

 evacuated by Front troops the following day as
 was Sao Salvador, close to the Zairian border.
 Movement forces raced on toward Tomboco and
 Santo Antonio do Zaire as the rout continued.
 Cuban troops were apparently primarily respon-
 sible for the Movement's gains.
 With the defeat of the Front in the north,
 Popular Movement leaders and their advisers will
 probably quickly divert more resources to central
 Angola, where South African troops and
 mercenaries have been supporting forces of the
 Front and its southern-based ally, the National
 Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
 Popular Movement troops moving out of
 strongholds at Quibala and Malanje apparently
 made gains in several directions during the week;
 South  African press reports mentioned heavy
 fighting around Gabela and Mussende in par-
 ticular.
 Uneasy Allies
 As the Popular Movement presses south it
 stands to profit from serious friction between
 National Front forces in central and southern
 Angola and those of the National Union. These
 Front forces are not really responsive to that
 organization's top leader-Holden Roberto-but
 are personally loyal to Daniel Chipenda, a former
 Popular Movement military commander who
 nominally joined the Front last year. An ambitious
 free-wheeler, Chipenda is also a tribal rival of the
 National Union's Jonas Savimbi.
 OAU Deadlocks
 The OAU emergency summit that convened
 in Addis Ababa on January 10 adjourned three
 days later with partisans and opponents of the
 Popular Movement among the 46 member states
 totally deadlocked. Unable to act, the con-
 ference, which was attended by some 20 heads of
 state or government, in effect pigeonholed the
 problem until the next regular summit convenes
 in Mauritius later this year.
 The impasse at Addis Ababa is something of a
 victory for the National Front and the National
 Union inasmuch as the Luanda-based regime of
 Popular Movement leader Agostinho Neto was
 not seated. The failure of the conferees to reach
 an acceptable compromise, however, rules out,
 for now at least, any collective African role in the
 search for a settlement of the Angolan conflict.
 For Africa, the summit heightened tensions
 among OAU members and severely damaged the
 prestige of their regional organization.
 The standoff developed early in the meeting
 as representatives of 44 countries split evenly in
 lining up behind pro- and anti-Popular Move-
 ment draft resolutions, both of which provided
 for explicit condemnation of South Africa's in-
 volvement in the Angolan civil war. The draft sub-
 mitted by Neto's supporters named his regime as
 the legal government of Angola. The opposing
 draft denounced all foreign intervention and call-
 ed on the three warring Angolan groups to con-
 clude a cease-fire and agree on a government of
 national unity.  Uganda, because of President
 Amin's role as OAU chairman, and Ethiopia, the
 host country, refrained from taking sides formally.
 As the conference proceeded amidst
 sometimes bruising exchanges among a succes-
 sion of speakers for the two sides, numerous
 attempts at compromise were made. Although

 Holden Roberto (1) and Jonas Savimbi at OAU summit
 leading partisans-for example, pro-Neto Nigeria
 and anti-Neto Zambia-displayed considerable
 give, all of the attempts failed, including a final ef-
 fort by a 10-country negotiating committee form-
 ed during the early hours of January 13. Neto's
 hard-line  supporters-Algeria,  Guinea,  and
 Mozambique-seem to have finally pulled back
 on the recognition issue, but those states and
 others refused to accept demands for an im-
 mediate cease-fire and withdrawal of all foreign
 forces by the hard liners on the other side,
 notably Ivory Coast and Senegal.
 A high-level Cuban delegation sent to Addis
 Ababa especially for the meeting may have
 helped stiffen resistance to a compromise by the
 Popular Movement's staunchest backers. The
 Cubans lobbied hard throughout the session on
 behalf of Neto and reportedly counseled his
 African friends that no summit decision would be
 better than a bad one.
 In the end, the turbulent meeting produced
 neither a resolution nor even a consensus state-
 ment and was simply declared adjourned by
 Amin. Pretoria thus escaped any formal condem-
 nation for its role in Angola. An OAU spokesman
 who announced the closure said that a committee
 of nine African leaders established by last year's
 summit had been asked to continue to follow the
 problem closely, but early action by the group is
 not likely.
 The summit's failure in effect leaves OAU
 members not committed to the Popular Move-
 ment free to follow their own course, including
 continued neutrality. Neto's main backers will
 almost certainly step up their campaign for
 recognition of his regime with a view to forcing
 the issue to a successful conclusiori at the next
 summit. With the action of Niger and the Comoro
 Islands last week and Ethiopia on January 15, at
 least 22 OAU members have now officially en-
 dorsed the Luanda government. No government
 has recognized the joint regime proclaimed by
 the National Front and the National Union.
 Some of Neto's African supporters, frustrated
 by the summit's outcome, may try to blame it on
 the US. One OAU official insisted, in contacts
 with officers of the US embassy in Addis Ababa
 after the conference, that the US could get the
 South Africans out of Angola but didn't want to.
 The embassy has heard reports that Nigeria,
 Mozambique, and Tanzania may also be casting
 the US in the role of scapegoat.

 Soviets Disappointed with the OAU
 Publicly, the Soviets have shown disappoint-
 ment over the inconclusive results of the OAU
 summit conference on Angola. Except for the
 OAU's failure to call for the withdrawal of all
 foreign forces, including Soviet and Cuban, from
 Angola, Moscow probably takes little comfort
 from the summit's outcome. The conference had
 been convened at the initiative of Popular Move-
 ment supporters, with Somalia and other African
 states sympathetic to Moscow in the lead. The
 USSR had made a considerable diplomatic effort
 to line up support for the Popular Movement, and
 the Soviet media worked hard to give the impres-
 sion that a Popular Movement bandwagon was
 developing within the OAU.
 Tass in an article later echoed by a Pravda,
 commentator over Radio Moscow, blamed
 "feverish" diplomatic and economic pressure by
 the US and other "imperialist states" for helping
 defeat an OAU resolution that would have
 recognized the Soviet-backed Popular Movement
 as the sole legitimate government in Angola.
 Other Soviet commentary was even more explicit
 in denouncing as "direct blackmail" the recent
 African trip by Assistant Secretary Schaufele and
 President Ford's circular letter to African heads of
 state on the eve of the OAU summit.
 In its summit post-mortem, Tass implicitly re-
 jected a resolution calling for a cease-fire and the
 formation of a national unity government-which
 also had failed to win OAU endorsement. Tass
 described the National Front and National Union
 as Angolan "splittists" that had discredited
 themselves by virtue of their close alliance with
 South Africa. Pravda, in its radio broadcast, ex-
 pressed the hope that "progressive forces" in the
 OAU will eventually prevail and that the African
 organization will ultimately adopt the "only just
 solution,"  recognition of the "lawful
 government" of the MPLA.
 Privately, however, the Soviets have been
 putting out the line that some sort of coalition
 formula for resolving the Angolan conflict might
 eventually be acceptable to Moscow. V. V.
 Zhurkin, a prominent Soviet academician
 who-as deputy, director of the USA
 Institute-closely follows the Kremlin's relations
 with Washington, recently  mentioned this
 possibility to a Western diplomat in Moscow.
 Zhurkin's comments were further refined early
 this week by two other Soviets in Moscow, one of
 them the director of the USSR's Africa Institute.
 They told US embassy officials that a coalition
 government of the Popular Movement and the
 National Union, including National Union leader
 Savimbi but presumably dominated by the
 Popular Movement might be possible.
 They ruled out inclusion of National Front
 leader Roberto in a coalition on grounds that he
 would never be acceptable to Popular Movement
 "President" Neto and his colleagues. The officials,
 however, left open the possibility of participation
 in the coalition by other National Front leaders.

 SPANISH SAHARA. GOBBLED UP
 Moroccan and Mauritanian forces further ex-
 panded their occupation of Spanish Sahara this
 week as Spain completed its military withdrawal.
 The final transfer of administrative authority is to
 take place by the end of February. Algeria,
 meanwhile, is continuing its support to Polisario
 Front guerrillas, who are carrying out harassing
 actions against the occupiers over a wide area.
 Both Moroccan and Mauritanian troops were
 on hand as the last Spanish troops departed Villa
 Cisneros, the territory's largest commercial
 center. Spain had earlier promised to hand over
 the town to Nouakchott, but Rabat probably in-
 sisted on a joint take-over to secure the town
 against possible occupation by the guerrillas.
 Morocco's move probably was also influenced by
 its interest in the lucrative commercial fishing in-
 dustry located there.
 The two countries have apparently not reach-

 ed full agreement on how to divide the territory
 Spain is abandoning, and they may well hold
 differing views on the disposition of Villa
 Cisneros. Moroccan media treatment of its oc-
 cupation strongly suggested that Rabat intends to
 stay.
 For public consumption, Morocco is playing
 down clashes with the guerrillas as minor police
 operations. The Moroccans are sufficiently confi-
 dent of their control of population centers that
 they are inviting foreign journalists to visit the
 territory.
 Despite Moroccan control of most towns in
 the north, the guerrillas continue to attack
 Moroccan convoys and patrols both in the Sahara
 and in southern Morocco. Their ambush tactics
 and minelaying operations are beginning to take
 a toll.
 Fighting between Mauritanian and Polisario
 forces has increased as Mauritanian troops ad-

 Nouakchott has taken control of several towns
 despite resistance by Front partisans. Isolated skir-
 mishes arealso being reported inside Mauritania,
 most recently across from the long eastern border
 of the Sahara.
 Algeria is prepared to back a long-term
 guerrilla struggle. At present, Algiers is also ex-
 ploring the possibilities of mediation of the dis-
 pute, probably mainly with a view to delaying in-
 ternational recognition of the Moroc-
 can-Mauritanian take-over. The Algerians also
 probably want to gain time to build up the
 military strength and political credibility of the
 Polisario Front.
 In recent weeks, Algiers has had contacts
 with Senegal looking to possible African media-
 tion. Given the inconclusive outcome of the UN
 General Assembly debate on Spanish
 Sahara-two contradictory resolutions were pass-
 ed last week-Algeria's only remaining move at
 the UN would be an appeal to the Security Coun-
 cil on grounds that the Saharan dispute con-
 stitutes a threat to international security.

 Meanwhile, the Polisario Front this week

 Libya, which had maintained a public position of
 neutrality in the dispute. In a speech on January
 12, President Qadhafi announced that he had
 been channeling weapons and ammunition to the
 Front since 1973 and that he would continue to
 support its "armed struggle" against Morocco

 almost certainly a reflection of a new closeness in

 ISRAEL: MISSILE BOAT PATROLS
 The Israeli navy may be planning to begin
 naval patrols in the southern Red Sea. Two
 Reshef-class guided-missile patrol boats were
 observed off the coast of Ethiopia on December
 24, according to the US naval attache in Tel Aviv.
 It is likely the boats operated in the area for about
 a week. The mission was probably for familiariza-
 tion before the start of regular operations in the
 Bab el Mandeb - Gulf of Aden area. Such
 operations would be in accord with Israel's evolv-
 ing naval strategy of extending protection over
 Israeli shipping lanes in both the Mediterranean
 and Red seas and of developing a capability of at-
 tacking potential enemy forces in their home
 waters.
 Israel has long been concerned about the
 Arabs' ability to close the Red Sea to ships carry-
 ing Israeli cargos. About five years ago, Tel Aviv
 began constructing six Reshef boats for use in the
 Red Sea. Two boats were completed shortly
 before the October 1973 war, but neither was in
 the Red Sea at its outset, leaving Israel unable to
 challenge Egypt's blockade of the Bab el Mandeb.
 Since the war, four Reshefs plus two  of the
 smaller, French-built, Saar II missile boats have

 been sent around Africa into the Red Sea. From
 their home port of Sharm ash Shaykh, the Reshefs
 could operate in the Bab el Mandeb and the Gulf
 of Aden without refueling, although they would
 be beyond the range of effective Israeli air cover.
 The shorter range Saar Its would be limited to
 operations closer to home port.
 Israel has also taken steps to improve its naval
 capabilities in the Mediterranean. Last year, Tel
 Aviv purchased from the US a logistic ship
 originally designed to support deep water drilling
 operations which it intends to use after conver-
 sion to support missile boat operations in the
 Mediterranean. The ship is in Israel being
 modified and reportedly will be ready in March. It
 will enable Israeli missile boats to operate in the
 central and western Mediterranean and will bring
 within range Arab states such as Libya and Algeria,
 which the Israelis believe will be major con-
 tributors to any new round of fighting in the Mid-
 dle East.
 The size of Israel's missile boat force also is
 being increased. Construction has been authoriz-
 ed for at least six more Reshef boats, and work has
 already begun on three of them. When all six are
 commissioned, Israel will have 12 Reshef-class
 missile boats and 12 Saar-class.F

 ETHIOPIA: TROUBLE ALL AROUND
 The new year finds the ruling military council
 hanging on in Addis Ababa, but its control over
 the countryside is still being widely challenged.
 Violence is occurring in nearly all of Ethiopia's 14
 provinces.
 The secessionist  movement  in  Eritrea
 Province remains the most serious of the
 numerous insurgencies facing the government,
 although the conflict has been stalemated for
 some time. Fighting could pick up soon, but
 neither the rebel nor the government side has the
 ability to overcome the other.
 Logistic problems, indiscipline, a shortage of
 trained officers, and low morale have restrained
 government military operations. A battalion of
 reinforcements arrived in Eritrea last week, and
 more troops may follow shortly. The arrival of the
 reinforcements may signal an increase in govern-
 ment operations against the rebels.
 The insurgents are divided into two rival fac-
 tions and their units seldom coordinate
 operations against government forces.   Their
 leaders apparently have not devised a coherent
 military strategy nor tried to apply theories of
 modern guerrilla warfare.
 Parts of four other northern provinces are
 outside government control because of rebellions
 led by landlords opposed to Addis Ababa's land
 reform program and by prominent figures from
 the old regime. A group called the Ethiopian
 Democratic Union began an insurrection in
 Begemdir Province in November. The group,
 which reportedly is also active in Tigre Province,
 periodically cuts a main road leading to the
 Sudanese border. The group's two main leaders,
 who are believed to have widespread support
 throughout northern Ethiopia, are probably also
 in contact with local notables who lead minor in-
 surrections in Begemdir, Tigre, Gojjam, and Shoa
 provinces.
 In southern Eritrea and eastern Wollo
 pravinces, a guerrilla force composed of
 rebellious Afar tribesmen occasionally is able to
 cut the road between Addis Ababa and Assab,
 where Ethiopia's only oil refinery is located. Most
 of the clashes between the Afars and government
 forces are minor, but in December the Afars
 reportedly executed 18  suspected government
 sympathizers. Government troops promptly ex-
 ecuted 40 Afars.
 During the past six weeks, insurgents have
 also become active in the Ogaden region, par-
 ticularly Harar and Bale provinces. Both the
 ethnic Somalis and the Ethiopian Gallas are in-
 volved. Somalia has apparently aided the groups
 with arms and training in guerrilla warfare.
 Mogadiscio claims the Ogaden as part of "greater
 Somalia."
 In an attempt to deal with the growing
 violence, Ethiopia's military rulers have begun ex-
 panding the armed forces. Large numbers of
 veterans have been recalled and local militia
 forces are to be created. The new troops,
 however, will be costly and will place additional
 burdens on the government's already strained
 logistic capabilities. Such new forces will enhance
 the regime's ability to contain for a while longer
 the various insurgencies, but will not significantly
 improve its offensive military capability.

 MOSCOW QUESTIONS PEKING'S MOTIVES
 The Soviets are still not saying much either
 publicly or privately about China's release of the
 helicopter crew.
 Their public diffidence may be partially ex-
 plained by the desire to avoid anything that might
 blur in the minds of the Soviet people the picture
 of Chinese intransigence that now exists. Last
 week a Moscow lecturer, having difficulty fielding
 a question on the release, took refuge in an
 allegation that one of the crewmen had been mis-
 treated.
 that of Politburo member Tung Pi-wu last year.
 The only difference, which Krasheninnikov did
 not mention, is that on this occasion the Soviet
 press has noted that a condolence call was made
 at the Chinese embassy. First Deputy Premier
 Mazurov, who paid the visit on Wednesday,
 January 14, was filling in for Premier Kos  in, now
 on vacation.                                   25X1
 In private, the Soviets have been skeptical
 about the meaning of the release. Two Soviet of-
 ficials, in comments to Western officials, describ-
 ed it as essentially a message to the US rather than
 to the USSR. One cited the continuation of an-
 ti-Soviet statements in the Chinese press as
 evidence that Peking is not ready to lessen ten-
 sion with the USSR.
 In a recent conversation with a US embassy
 official, Viktor Krasheninnikov of the Foreign
 Ministry's First Far East Division did not mention
 the US aspect but said that, the helicopter crew
 release notwithstanding, it was still up to the
 Chinese to demonstrate their interest in better
 relations. He suggested they could do so by
 responding favorably to Soviet suggestions for in-
 creased trade and a renewal of cultural and scien-
 tific exchanges.
 Krasheninnikov implied that the Soviets feel
 under no pressure to respond to China's gesture
 and, contrary to a statement by a Sinologist at-
 tached to the USA Institute, said he knew of no
 current plan to send Deputy Foreign Minister
 Ilichev, Moscow's negotiator for the border talks,
 back to Peking. He also said that there would be
 no change in Soviet treatment of China at the
 coming party congress.
 The Soviet diplomat seemed to be going out
 of his way to emphasize that Moscow's "correct
 and principled" policy regarding China would
 continue and pointed out that Moscow had
 handled Chou En-tai's death in the same way as

 tors will probably be sufficient to offset the short-
 fall and maintain an overall balance.
 The new plan provides for annual production
 of 1,340 to 1,380 billion kilowatt hours of electrici-
 ty by 1980, an increase of 29 to 33 percent over
 1975. Total industrial output is to increase at a
 faster rate, and industry's share of total power
 consumption may be greater than in the past.
 Since the rural economy will also seek to increase
 its share of electric power, competition for elec-
 tricity is likely. Regional power shortages almost
 certainly will become more prevalent, especially
 in the European USSR, which consumes 80 per-
 cent of Soviet electricity but is deficient in energy
 resources.

 Electric Power Production
 The goal for electric power production dur-
 ing the tenth five-year plan (1976-80) may be op-
 timistic, but a serious imbalance between power
 production and requirements seems unlikely.
 Even if goals for the electric power industry are
 not fully realized, lags in power consuming sec-
 Achievement of the goal for electric power
 production depends on the installation of 67,000
 to 70,000 megawatts of new generating capacity
 and on the construction of high-voltage, long-
 distance transmission lines. Nuclear-electric
 power plants are to account for approximately 20
 percent of the planned additions to
 capacity-compared with about 7 percent in the
 last five-year plan-with another 20 percent in
 hydroelectric plants. The remainder will be in
 conventional thermal power plants, some to be
 built in the eastern regions of the country to
 utilize cheap coal. All the nuclear capacity and
 more than one third of the hydro capacity will be
 added in the European USSR. Past performance
 suggests that the addition of new capacity will fall
 short of plans.
 The plan also calls for installation of a large
 number of gas turbines to meet demand for
 power in hours of peak use. The Soviet equip-
 ment industry has not mastered their production,
 however, and the Ministry of Power has been
 forced to seek them in the West. Because of the
 large hard-currency deficit, recent negotiations
 with General Electric for the purchase of equip-
 ment, probably including gas turbines, have been
 discontinued, and the problem of covering peak
 demand may grow more severe.
 Work on a unified transmission network for
 the entire Soviet union will continue with con-
 struction of main transmission lines carrying

 discussed 1,500-kilovolt, direct-current transmis-
 sion line that the Soviets plan to use to move large
 amounts of electric power from eastern regions to
 the European USSR is not included in the plan. As
 a result, the location of generating facilities in
 areas far from major western centers of power
 consumption may still remain a problem.
 Preparing for the 25th CPSU Congress
 The Armenian and Lithuanian party con-

 SOVIETS INVITE OBSERVERS
 Moscow has invited the Greek and Turkish
 military attaches to observe the Soviet military ex-
 ercise to be held in the Caucasus from January 25
 to February 6. Bulgaria and Romania from the
 Warsaw Pact and Yugoslavia, which is nonaligned,
 have also been invited to attend.
 Invitations such as these, although among the
 confidence-building measures of the Helsinki ac-
 cord, are voluntary. The Soviets apparently desire
 to counter Western criticism of Moscow's record
 with regard to the accord and to improve the at-
 mosphere for the force reductions talks that
 resume in Vienna later this month. The Soviets'
 first act of compliance with the confidence-
 building measures was January 4, when they gave
 notification-21 days in advance-of a maneuver
 that involved about 25,000 troops within 250
 kilometers of the border of a Helsinki par-
 ticipatory state.

 tive," and either the combat-ready airborne divi-
 sion at Kirovobad or the airmobile unit at Kutaisi
 could be used. Elements of some of the five
 motorized rifle divisions located near the exercise
 area, and combat aircraft from the tactical air
 force are also expected to participate.

 ICELAND: BREAK WITH UK LOOMS
 Iceland is apparently prepared to break
 relations with the UK, but may wait until after
 NATO Secretary General Luns has had a chance to
 air his proposals for settling the fisheries dispute
 between the two allies. Luns arrived in Reykjavik
 on January 14. Britain has suggested that, rather
 than a trip to London, he meet with British
 Foreign Secretary Callaghan on January 20 in
 Brussels during the EC Foreign Ministers'
 meeting.
 The decision to send Luns, who helped
 mediate a settlement of the last cod war in 1973,
 was made at an emergency session of the North
 Atlantic Council on January 12. Although Reyk-
 javik did not receive the strong support it had ex-
 pected at the NATO meeting, the majority of the
 ambassadors called for a withdrawal of British
 frigates from the contested waters as a first step
 toward settling the dispute. Reykjavik has in-
 dicated that it might call home its ambassador to
 NATO, if the British continue to operate within
 Iceland's 200-mile limit and the NATO allies take
 no action.
 Prime Minister Hallgrimsson insists that Luns'
 visit should not be considered a mediation effort,
 but rather a fact-finding mission prior to conven-
 ing another NATO meeting to consider further
 measures. Hallgrimsson claims that domestic opi-
 nion is opposed to further negotiations while
 British frigates remain in Icelandic waters.
 Emotions are continuing to run high in
 Iceland. Hallgrimsson told the US ambassador last
 weekend that he believes anti-NATO sentiment
 in Iceland is stronger now than during the
 national debate in 1973 over renewing the treaty
 governing the US-manned NATO base at
 Keflavik. Angry fishermen blockaded two NATO
 facilities outside the main Keflavik base last
 weekend, charging that NATO had failed to de-
 fend Iceland from British aggression.
 The protracted dispute appears to be creating
 political difficulties for Hallgrimsson who claims
 that he is losing the support of his own
 Independence Party, as well as that of the
 Progressive Party, the junior coalition partner.
 Hallgrimsson argues that he must take a stronger
 position in the fisheries dispute to prevent the
 Progressive Party from abandoning the coalition
 and  bringing down the government.
 EC: TINDEMANS SUBMITS HIS REPORT
 Europe's continuing effort to organize itself
 has again taken center stage following publication
 last week of Belgian Prime Minister Tindemans'
 report on European union. The report has been
 under preparation since late 1974, during which
 time Tindemans discussed relevant issues with
 government, party, business, and labor leaders in
 the member countries.
 The report, which provides a blueprint for
 evolution toward union, is already controver-
 sial-some regret its lack of originality, and others
 complain that it goes too far, on defense policy
 for example. The principal value of the report will
 be to spur debate on Tindemans' underlying
 thesis that European unity cannot be attained un-
 less it reflects a consensus on political and security
 issues as well as agreement on joint economic
 policies. The debate will presumably gain
 relevance because of the expectations that direct
 elections to the European Parliament-scheduled
 for 1978-will reinforce a sense of Community
 self-awareness.
 The Prime Minister, who set no deadlines for
 specific actions, defines European union as a way
 station between today's European Community
 and a United States of Europe. It is thus seen as a
 process characterized by increasing accord on
 economic and foreign policies and a growing
 assumption of authority by supranational Com-
 munity institutions. The priority concerns seen by
 Tindemans in foreign policy are the developing
 world, relations with the US, security and defense
 issues, and unstable political situations in Europe.

 Tindemans wants joint security policy to be
 enhanced through regular consultations on
 East-West matters. Defense policy itself, a sine qua
 non for ultimate union, should be approached
 now through cooperation in armaments
 manufacture and, possibly, the creation of a Euro-
 pean armaments agency. Defense should be a
 major issue in proposed top-level discussions
 between the US and one of the nine heads of
 government representing the Community.
 The report proposes that the economically
 healthier members should go ahead with
 economic and  monetary union, leaving the
 others-Ireland, the UK, and Italy-to catch up.
 All the members, however, would participate in
 deciding on the common goals.
 Tindemans also calls for a substantial
 strengthening of EC institutions. The parliament
 should initiate policy along with the Commission,
 and the Commission itself should have a
 "political" president-selected by the heads of
 government. The role of the European Coun-
 cil-the heads of government of the Nine-and
 its method of working should be more precisely
 defined and the executive powers of the Council
 of Ministers increased, with more of its decisions
 reached by compulsory majority vote.
 Initial official reaction to the report has been
 mostly cautious and noncommittal. Press com-
 mentary has been extensive, however, and seems
 to reflect a widespread feeling that the report, at
 the least, perceptively analyzes the obstacles to
 European unity. It is evident, nevertheless, that
 Tindemans has offered no magic formulas for
 overcoming traditional differences among the
 Nine.
 The smaller countries have shown some
 suspicion that consultation among the heads of
 government is emphasized to the detriment of
 Community institutions. Britain, Ireland, and Italy
 are wary of the "second-class membership" im-
 plications of Tindemans' economic proposals.
 Both Denmark and the Netherlands are concern-
 ed about the effects on NATO of premature Euro-
 pean defense efforts. In France, meanwhile, both
 the Gaullists and the Communists have railed
 C(2S
 against the implied loss of national independence
 through European union.
 It nevertheless seems unlikely that the report
 will be "buried" as Tindemans seems to fear, if
 only because the issues it addresses appear in-
 creasingly ineluctable to most Europeans. Some
 of the Nine have set in train parliamentary debate
 as a prelude to the next European Council on
 March 15-16 in Luxembourg, where the report
 will be the centerpiece. The EC Council and Com-
 mission are then likely to be asked to prepare
 proposals for examination later this year. Early
 changes in the Community's structure and com-
 petence are unlikely, however, especially since
 certain proposals, such as the formal incorpora-
 tion of political consultations into the EC
 framework, would require treaty amendments
 and could also give rise to referenda in some

 ITALY: MORE PROBLEMS FOR MORO
 With a new mandate from President Leone,
 Aldo Moro has begun the process of trying to
 patch together a government to replace the one
 he headed until last week when the Socialist Party
 forced him to resign by withdrawing its
 parliamentary support.
 Moro will reportedly try first to get all four
 parties of the center-left-his Christian
 Democrats, the Socialists, Social Democrats, and
 Republicans-to resume full participation in the
 government. An alliance among these parties has
 been the basis for most Italian governments since
 the "opening to the left" in 1963 that brought the
 Socialists into the government. The alliance was
 never very tranquil, but the differences among
 the parties have been magnified by several recent
 trends, such as the country's severe economic
 problems and the growing influence of the Com-
 munist Party. Following the collapse in late 1974 of
 the last coalition in which all four parties par-
 ticipated, only two-the Christian Democrats and
 the Republicans-accepted positions in Moro's
 cabinet. The Socialists and Social Democrats
 limited their role to providing Moro the
 parliamentary support he needed for a majority.
 Differences among the parties have deep-
 ened since then, leaving Moro with major hurdles
 to clear in his effort to restore cooperation
 among the four parties. One problem stems from
 Socialist leader De Martino's assertion that his
 party is entitled to be treated as a political equal
 by the dominant Christian Democrats because of
 the growing strength of the left.
 Despite the relatively small representation De
 Martino's party has in parliament, it is in a pivotal
 position. Socialist votes alone are sufficient to give
 the Christian Democrats the majority they need to
 continue governing without the Communists.
 That situation has led some Christian
 Democrats and Socialists to urge in the past that
 the two smaller parties of the center-left formula
 be dropped or relegated to minor roles-a
 suggestion that may resurface as the search for a
 new government proceeds. As long as the Social

 Democrats' and Republicans are involved in the
 bargaining, however, they are likely to resist any
 Christian Democratic attempt to pacify the
 Socialists with more ministries and more in-
 fluence on economic and other policies.
 The largest stumbling block in Moro's path,
 however, is the Socialists' insistence that a more
 open consultative relationship be established
 between the government and the Communist op-
 position. The Christian Democrats are strongly
 opposed to any such agreement, but the Socialists
 believe it is necessary to limit the Communists'
 ability to capitalize on their opposition status.
 Socialist chief De Martino has been backpedaling
 on this issue, but he has yet to drop the demand
 altogether.
 The situation is complicated by the latest
 Communist statement, in which the party says it
 wants either to remain in opposition or to have
 full membership in the government. The Com-
 munists in the past have favored a formal con-
 sultative relationship with the government,
 presumably as a step toward establishing their
 credentials as a governing party. Since the Com-
 munists' sharp gains in the June elections,
 however, the party has sought to avoid any
 appearance of condoning the kind of govern-
 ment it attacked with such success in those con-
 tests.
 The refusal of the Communists to be drawn
 into an arrangement such as that proposed by the
 Socialists could ease the way for a compromise
 between the Socialists and the other parties. On
 the other hand, the Communist move might rein-
 force the tendency of some Socialists to view the
 risks of an early parliamentary election as
 preferable to being the only major party on the
 left that has to defend government actions to the
 voters.

 dustries were most affected. A slowdown also dis-
 rupted telephone service in northern Spain.
 Dockworkers went on strike in Barcelona, and
 workers at power stations refused to make repairs
 and threatened to cut off electricity to the city if
 police intervened in their dispute.
 Spanish government officials claim that the
 Communists, encouraged by the turmoil of last
 week's subway strike, are trying to use the current
 wave of unrest to prepare for a general strike later
 this month that would discredit the Juan Carlos
 regime and upset the country's economy. Com-
 munist labor leaders have reportedly taken the in-
 itiative in organizing street incidents that have
 resulted in confrontations with the police, but
 attempts to politicize the strikes appear to have
 had limited success to date. Although strike
 appeals often contain some political
 demands-amnesty for political prisoners, free
 labor unions, legalization of political par-
 ties-strikes have occurred primarily in industries
 where economic or labor problems already ex-
 isted, and particularly in those where new collec-
 tive bargaining contracts are being negotiated.
 The government has indicated that strikes
 with purely economic goals will be
 tolerated-even when they do not conform to the
 strict controls required of a "legal" strike-but
 Interior Minister Fraga warned that any public
 disturbances would be dealt with firmly. Police
 have on several occasions during the past week
 resorted to tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse
 unruly demonstrators and eject workers oc-
 cupying work areas, offices, and churches.
 The government has not interfered with
 negotiations between striking workers and their

 Spanish riot police watch over striking bank workers
 employers, although in the case of strikes
 "disrupting public order" pressure has been ex-
 erted to get the strikers back to work even if
 negotiations have not been concluded. During
 the five-day Madrid subway strike last week, in-
 direct pressure was applied by bringing in special-
 ly trained army personnel to keep the trains roll=
 ing. An even more serious disruption caused by
 the one-day postal strike in Madrid on January 13
 was dealt with by placing postal workers tem-
 porarily under the direct control of the area's
 military commander and making them subject to
 the code of military justice.
 The strikes and demonstrations are increasing
 pressure on the government to slow the planned
 pace of liberalization. Rightist political leaders
 have been meeting in an apparent effort to get
 the government to crack down on labor. The con-
 servative finance minister is calling for strict wage
 controls, blaming large pay hikes of the past two
 years for Spain's roughly 15-percent rate of infla-
 tion. So far, the government has held to its policy
 of restraint, but if the strikes and demonstrations
 continue to spread, the government may find it
 has no recourse but to adopt the harsh measures
 of the Franco regime.

 JAPAN-USSR: GROMYKO VISIT
 Foreign Minister Gromyko's visit to Tokyo
 did nothing to improve bilateral relations. A brief
 communique, issued after Gromyko had
 departed, expressed the usual platitudes about
 the desirability of expanding economic and
 cultural relations, confirmed that the talks on a
 peace treaty would continue, and announced that
 Foreign Minister Miyazawa would go to the USSR
 later this year.
 One major stumbling block was Tokyo's
 desire to include an explicit reference to the
 Northern Territories issue. In line with Moscow's
 current tough stance toward Japan, Gromyko
 would not go beyond the statement included in
 the Brezhnev-Tanaka communique of 1973,
 which implied that the territorial issue would be
 covered as part of the continuing negotiations on
 a peace treaty. Gromyko raised the possibility of
 an interim treaty of friendship and cooperation
 that would not cover the Northern Territories
 issue, but he reportedly did not press the
 proposal when the Japanese demurred.

 The Soviet foreign minister made some
 attempt to put a more positive light on his visit.
 He was relatively conciliatory on the fisheries
 problem, saying that Moscow would soon release
 32 Japanese fishermen detained in the USSR and
 promising increased Soviet efforts to carry out the
 fisheries agreement that the two sides signed last
 summer.
 Gromyko was especially harsh on the
 Japanese for considering a treaty with Peking that
 would include an anti-hegemony clause. He said
 publicly that Moscow would have to review its
 relations with Tokyo if the Japanese went ahead
 with the treaty. Claiming that Peking seeks
 hegemony in Asia, he attacked the Chinese for
 pressing the Japanese to go along with an an-
 ti-Soviet policy.
 The Japanese, for their part, insisted that the an-
 ti-hegemony clause is not aimed at the USSR and
 moved quickly to dispel any idea that Soviet ob-
 jections would dissuade Tokyo from further nor-
 malizing its relations with Peking. Shortly after
 Gromyko left, Prime Minister Miki said publicly
 that Japan would continue working to conclude a
 treaty with Peking, despite Soviet objections.
 Miki's forthright stance was undoubtedly also
 shaped by his domestic political calculations;
 national elections are possible as early as this
 spring, and Miki along with other conserva-
 tive politicians would have been unlikely to
 adopt a compromising posture on any of the long-
 standing differences between Moscow and Tokyo.
 Peking is no doubt delighted at Gromyko's
 failure to stimulate  any  progress  in
 Soviet-Japanese relations. Ever since the visit was
 announced, the Chinese have maintained a
 steady drumbeat of press comment against
 Moscow, charging that the Soviet refusal to return
 the Northern Territories is an example of Soviet
 "hegemonism" and that Gromyko's primary ob-
 jective was to throw obstacles in the path of im-
 proving Sino-Japanese relations. Peking will
 highlight Miki's comments on the importance to
 Tokyo of the proposed Sino-Japanese peace trea-
 ty and may attempt to capitalize on the momen-
 tum generated by the Gromyko visit by
 suggesting a resumption of the long-stalled treaty
 CHINA: MOURNING CHOU EN-LAI
 As China devoted an unprecedented week to
 official mourning for Chou En-lai, there was am-
 ple evidence that most Chinese felt their country
 had entered a period of transition. Condolence
 messages from foreign governments, other than
 those of the Soviet Union and its closest allies,
 paid glowing tribute to the deceased premier,
 and the official Chinese obituary termed his death
 a "gigantic loss." Even the staid Chinese
 leadership indulged in uncharacteristic displays of
 emotion-some leaders were shown on national
 television crying as they paid final respects to
 Chou.
 Peking had made no effort to hide Chou's ill-
 ness now officially confirmed as cancer, from the
 Chinese people. They were prepared for the mo-
 ment of his death and accepted the news without
 any visible signs of anxiety about the future but
 with obvious grief. Hundreds of thousands of
 people filed tearfully by as Chou lay in state.
 Chinese leaders, including those from the
 provinces, have been meeting in Peking every day
 since Chou's death. One purpose of the meetings
 undoubtedly is to confirm senior vice premier
 Teng Hsiao-ping as Chou's successor. Teng has
 been filling in for Chou for more than a year, but
 his appointment to the premiership will not sit
 well with the party's left wing, which was in-
 strumental in ousting him in the mid-1960s. Most
 Chinese leaders probably would like to confirm
 Teng's appointment quickly, in order to convey
 an image of continuity and smooth transition.
 Prolonged wrangling over the issue could result
 in growing political malaise.
 Teng has moved vigorously over the past year
 to consolidate his authority. He holds important

 posts in the party, state, and military
 bureaucracies and has appointed close associates
 to key jobs in each area. Teng lacks, however, the
 overwhelming prestige and affection accorded to
 Chou by the Chinese public and by many officials,
 and he does not seem to possess Chou's talents
 for conciliation and compromise. Indeed, Teng's
 failure to take into account the views of the par-
 ty's left wing, as well as the growing recognition
 of Chou's imminent demise, probably con-
 tributed in no small measure to the leftist
 backlash that has appeared in the propaganda
 since last month.
 Teng appears, however, to have the con-
 fidence of Mao Tse-tung, who along with Chou,
 had a personal hand in bringing Teng back from
 political disgrace. Although Teng has a
 well-deserved reputation as an efficient and
 tough-minded administrator, he lacks Chou's
 broad perspective and depth of experience. As a
 consequence, Chou's absence over time will
 almost certainly have a subtle effect on the shape
 and flexibility of Chinese foreign and domestic
 policies. Teng appears, for example, to accept ful-
 ly the rationale that led to Peking's partial rap-
 prochement with Washington, but he was not
 part of the leadership when that initiative was
 made and his prestige is not so deeply bound up
 with its success.
 Chou's death underlines the age and uncer-
 tain health of other Chinese leaders, particularly
 Mao himself, who turned 82 last month and who
 is obviously frail. Chou was the second party vice
 chairman to die within one month and the third
 member of the Politburo's elite standing com-
 mittee to die in less than a year.
 The meetings currently under way in Peking
 may also be dealing with the question of
 reconstituting the party's top echelon by moving
 up some second-ranking figures and possibly
 rearranging the pecking order. Chou's demise
 leaves 40-year-old Wang Hung-wen as the
 nominal number two man in the leadership, but
 Wang has been rumored to have shown signs of
 political immaturity during the past year, and Pek-
 ing may want to move a more experienced official
 THAILAND: NEW ELECTIONS
 The political situation in Bangkok carne un-
 stuck this week when Prime Minister Khukrit's ef-
 forts to fend off a parliamentary challenge to his
 government backfired. Unable to form a stable
 coalition, he asked King Phumiphon to dissolve
 the National Assembly and call for new elections,
 which were requested by the King on January 12.
 General elections, as required by the constitution,
 will be held on April 4. Khukrit and the present
 cabinet will remain in a caretaker status.
 Khukrit had attempted to buy off his
 parliamentary opponents by bringing them into
 the cabinet. By doing so, however, he upset the
 already delicate balance of his eight-party coali-
 tion. Many rank-and-file members of the coali-
 tion parties threatened to join the opposition in a
 vote of no-confidence in protest over Khukrit's
 cabinet reshuffle.  Khukrit, faced with the
 possibility of losing the vote and convinced that
 none of his rivals stood a better chance of forming
 a new government, played his final trump card
 and called for the dissolution of the assembly.
 Most observers do not believe that new elec-
 tions will strengthen the parliamentary process.
 During last January's election, 22 political parties
 won seats in the assembly. There are still no
 restrictions on the number of parties, and there
 seems little likelihood that the new assembly will
 be any less faction ridden.
 The Prime Minister has announced that he
 will stand for election. Presumably Khukrit will
 exploit his control over the government's election
 machinery to strengthen his own Social Action
 Party, but it is not a foregone conclusion that he
 will remain prime minister.
 Retired army commander Krit Siwara, who
 was instrumental in stimulating the parliamentary
 challenge, is likely to run for a seat in the
 assembly in order to become eligible for a cabinet
 position or the prime ministership. Should he
 win, Krit would be a leading candidate to form a
 new government

 ECUADOR: NEW FACES; OLD PROBLEMS
 The three-man military junta that took over
 from former president Rodriguez Lara last
 weekend may be no more stable than the ineffec-
 tual and problem-ridden government it replaces.
 On January 11, after months of political un-
 certainty and internal disorders, a triumvirate
 consisting of the armed forces chiefs replaced the
 discredited four-year-old Rodriguez regime.
 Their peaceful assumption of power-delayed
 several hours so Rodriguez' daughter could be
 married in the presidential palace-does not
 presage any significant  change  in  Ecuador's
 domestic and foreign policies. Although the
 move was apparently designed to remove the
 focus of criticism by labor and students and near
 continuous plotting by the military, the new
 government is not likely to develop rapid
 remedies to the problems that plague Ecuador.
 The new leaders, with Admiral Alfredo Poveda
 SRS
 Burbano assuming the role of spokesman, say
 they intend to adhere to the "revolutionary prin-
 ciples and programs of the armed forces," in-
 cluding a return to civilian rule by the end of 1977.
 Critics of the military are already reacting to
 the prospect of two more years of military rule.
 Four ex-presidents have issued a call for the
 return of the government to civilian hands, and
 party leaders have informed US embassy officers
 that they are working on a joint manifesto calling
 for immediate general elections.
 When it becomes clear that pressure will not
 speed the return to civilian government, the op-
 position is likely to adopt,the same tactics-strikes
 and disorders-that paralyzed the Rodriguez
 regime in its final weeks. Thus far, Ecuadoreans
 seem to have accepted the news of the new
 government quietly and with general in-

 difference, perhaps reflecting a belief that a few
 new faces at the top will not improve things
 much. Economic problems will continue to be
 more important to Ecuadoreans than the
 ramifications of a political shuffle.
 Economically, the country is in poor shape.
 The three-year-old oil boom is fizzling despite a
 reduction in oil prices and an increase in exports.
 Due  to  government  ineptitude,  petroleum
 revenues have not kept pace with rising import
 bills. The government's erratic treatment of the
 foreign oil companies has frightened off other
 potential foreign investors. Moreover, increased
 government spending created a sizable deficit last
 year that had to be covered with foreign loans.
 Inflation has been on the rise since 1973 and has
 been the cause of recent student and labor un-
 rest; there is no immediate solution to this
 problem.
 The longevity of the military junta ultimately
 will rest on its ability to work together; prospects
 for this are not good. A simmering rivalry
 between Poveda and army commander General
 Duran threatens to continue factionalism within
 the armed forces. Poveda's action allocating for
 himself responsibility for the military and security
 services while putting Duran in charge of
 economic policy may fan the animosity between
 them. Duran will consider the move an attempt to
 undercut his support in the army by making him
 the focus for discontent in the country.
 Moreover, the army hold six posts in the new
 cabinet while the navy and air force hold only two
 each. Civilians hold the posts of finance, foreign
 relations, and industry. Air Force chief Luis Leoro
 Franco is expected to play a minor role in the
 triumvirate. These rivalries will hinder the har-
 monious execution of triumvirate policies. A solu-
 tion to this difficulty is not readily apparent. The
 emergence of a strong man from the junta would
 certainly be opposed by other members and also
 by the various services.
 VENEZUELA: OIL JITTERS
 President Carlos Andres Perez and other
 government officials are warning that the oil
 bonanza Venezuelans have taken for granted may
 be short-lived and that a nationwide austerity
 program must be implemented immediately if the
 country's long-term economic development
 programs are to be fulfilled.
 In an unusually frank speech on the occasion
 of the nationalization of the foreign-owned
 petroleum industry, Perez berated Venezuelans
 for squandering the country's oil wealth "on all
 manner of junk" and maintained that unless this
 mentality changes, nationalization will be a
 failure. Perez' tough language reflects the private-
 ly held views of many Venezuelan officials and
 leaders of the governing Democratic Action Party
 that nationalization has created some potentially
 dangerous political pitfalls for Perez and that the
 political fortunes of the party will ride or fall on
 the ability of Venezuela's petroleum corporation
 to maintain petroleum production.
 Management problems will be legion. Added
 to this are declining revenues stemming from the
 government's insistence on maintaining OPEC
 price levels in a depressed market. The opposition
 parties have made clear their intention to main-
 tain close watch and publicize any misstep in the
 government's management of the country's two

 important extractive industries and major sources
 of revenue-oil and iron ore.
 Venezuelans expect many immediate social
 and economic benefits from nationalization.
 Thus, any government deficit that results will
 diminish the government's popularity and create
 a situation of political and labor unrest. Adding to
 the self-doubt and trepidation is a genuine con-
 cern over the government's ability to maintain
 labor peace in this vital sector of the economy. In-
 dustry-wide contract negotiations for some 24,000
 highly paid petroleum workers begin in April and
 will be difficult. Many of the tactics used by the
 opposition political parties in provoking wildcat
 strikes after the nationalization of the iron mines
 last year apparently are being repeated among
 the petroleum workers with some effect. To en-
 sure labor peace, the Democratic Action Party is
 making a strong bid to win control of the
 petroleum workers federation in union elections
 scheduled for the first week in February.
 The government is also making a strenuous
 effort to keep the decline in petroleum revenues
 to a minimum. It is giving top priority to develop-
 ing new markets.
 The tough talk has undoubtedly come as a
 shock to Venezuelans who have come to accept
 as a matter of fact the oil riches of the past few
 years. The changing petroleum situation has
 probably had the salutary effect of stimulating the
 government to face up more realistically to some
 of its fundamental problems.
 The new realism reflects the belief that even
 though nationalism has been proclaimed and the
 administration has wrapped up a sales and service
 agreement with Creole (EXXON), the country's
 largest major refiner/producer, the process of
 putting the oil industry on a sound footing is far
 from over. In fact, agreements with the other ma-
 jor companies are still subject to settlement of
 some sensitive details and are expected to drag on
 for some time

 LATIN AMERICAN ARMS PURCHASES
 In the late 1960s, many Latin American coun-
 tries began major programs aimed at modernizing
 their armed forces. These moves grew out of
 national competition for hemispheric leadership,
 the fueling of intra-regional rivalries, and the
 desire of military governments to enhance their
 prestige.
 Purchases of foreign arms reached an average
 of $600 million a year in the five-year period,
 1970-74, a two-fold increase over the average in
 the previous five-year period. Five coun-
 tries-Argentina,  Brazil, Chile, Peru, and
 Venezuela-accounted for about 80 percent of
 the total. Purchases in 1975 may reach a record
 $1.2 billion because of large Venezuelan and
 Argentine orders for ships and an Ecuadorean
 deal for ground equipment.
 Despite the large jump in procurement, Latin
 America remains the smallest arms market among
 the regions of the Third World and accounts for
 only 8 percent of total military purchases by the
 Third World. In the 1970s, Iran, Israel, and Saudi
 Arabia each purchased more arms than all of Latin
 America.
 Like other developing countries, Latin
 American states have sought costly, high
 technology ordnance. Almost three fourths of
 their orders have been for warships, including
 destroyer escorts equipped with guided-missile

 systems, and aircraft, including mach-2 jet
 fighters.
 West European countries have won two
 thirds of the arms contracts awarded in the last six
 years, moving into a market previously dominated
 by the US. The substantial shift resulted from
 aggressive European sales tactics, US restrictions
 on sales and credit, and a concerted effort by ma-
 jor Latin American purchasers to reduce their
 dependence on the US.
 West European countries, as a group, sold
 $2.4 billion of arms to Latin America during the
 past six years-mostly high cost, sophisticated
 combat equipment. One half of the aircraft and
 ground forces equipment and about 80 percent of
 the naval ships have come from Western Europe.
 The UK, France, West Germany, and Italy have
 been the major suppliers. A new record for West
 European arms sales to Latin America-over $1
 billion-was probably reached in 1975.
 The US still has a 24-percent share of the
 market-the largest of any single country-mainly
 because of sales of follow-on equipment and
 spare parts for weapons already in Latin American
 inventories. Despite its reduced role as an arms
 supplier, the US remains the major source of
 foreign technical services to Latin American arm-
 ed forces through training missions, equipment
 installation, and maintenance operations.
 Less than 10 percent of Latin America's
 foreign arms purchases have come from countries
 outside of WesternEurope and the US. Peru so far
 is the only non-communist country in Latin
 America to sign a military agreement with
 Moscow.
 The more industrialized Latin American
 nations are developing their own arms industries,
 often through licensing and assembly agreements
 with West European countries. Foreign com-
 ponents are frequently used for all or part of the
 finished weapons made in Latin America. These
 arrangements are intended to save foreign ex-
 change, to  improve domestic technical

 capabilities, and to adapt weapons systems to
 local needs. Although ten Latin American coun-
 tries are able to manufacture a variety of infantry
 weapons, small arms ammunition, and quarter-
 master supplies, only Argentina and Brazil are ap-
 proaching self-sufficiency.
 Because Latin America has been remarkably
 free of major military conflicts, Latin countries, as
 a whole, have consistently spent a smaller propor-
 tion of their gross national product on defense
 than other developing nations. Between 1966 and
 1972, the average annual outlay in Latin America
 was about 2 percent; since then it has dropped to
 less than 1.5 percent. Average expenditures of all
 third-world nations were more than 5.5 percent,
 and the figure for the Middle East was almost 12
 percent.
 Latin American military budgets typically
 allow 10 to 15 percent of total expenditures for
 procurement of foreign arms. By spreading
 delivery and repayment over a number of years,
 countries have made large arms purchases
 without seriously straining their balance of
 payments. Although the annual payment on the
 military debt has increased to some $300 million
 to $400 million during the past three years, Latin
 American countries should be able to meet
 current repayment schedules without jeopar-
 dizing economic development.
 We expect Latin American arms purchases to
 run about $1 billion annually over the next five
 years, two thirds above the last five. Higher out-
 lays principally reflect increased prices for
 sophisticated weapons systems and growing re-
 quirements for follow-on support. We do not an-
 ticipate any large increase in the quantities of
 equipment ordered, primarily because of
 balance-of-payments and other fiscal constraints.
 Although Latin America has shown
 preference for US aircraft, West European
 suppliers will get a somewhat larger share of the
 contracts because they offer a wider variety of
 equipment and faster delivery. US government
 restrictions on the sale of certain weapons
 systems, as well as prior commitments to US
 forces and Middle East customers, will help

 VIOLENCE IN JAMAICA
 The partisan violence that erupted last week
 in several Kingston slums and elsewhere in
 Jamaica has subsided, but Prime Minister Manley
 is taking advantage of the disturbances to
 strengthen his position.
 Conflict between supporters of Manley's
 Peoples  National  Party  and  the opposition
 Jamaican Labor Party has been endemic in West
 Kingston's slums, but the level of tension has
 recently increased as political bosses in both par-
 ties tried to expand their area of control. A gang
 led by Housing Minister Anthony Spaulding, a
 leader of the left wing of Manley's party, has had a
 major role in the turbulence. Spaulding has been
 pressing Manley for some time to be more an-
 ti-US and to speed the creation of a socialist state.
 Manley's response to the violence can be in-
 terpreted as a reaffirmation of his intention to
 keep his government on a leftward course. He
 refused to give security forces a free hand in
 halting the rioting-which resulted in the deaths
 of some 10 civilians and injured over 100-and
 now appears to be trying to turn the situation to
 his political advantage. He accused the Jamaican
 Labor Party of "hiring armed gunmen to shoot
 their way to power" and announced plans to
 create a self-defense force within his own party.
 The Prime Minister also called for a mass meeting
 on January 29 of "those who will be going forward
 to socialism in 1976."
 The self-defense force is likely to be drawn
 from the youth arm of the Peoples National Party,
 an organization with close ties to Havana. Its
 members last week joined with a Marxist-Leninist
 labor group to protest the presence in Jamaica of
 the CIA and "US imperialists" and to stone the US

 are having difficulty selling their oil. Consump-
 tion of heavy fuel oil slumped with the drop in in-
 dustrial output, particularly in Western Europe,
 where most of OPEC's heavy crude is marketed,
 causing refiners to accumulate large excess stocks
 of heavy fuel oil. As a consequence, while overall
 OPEC output has increased since the first half of
 1975, output of heavy crudes has fallen.
 Compared with the first half of 1975, output
 of heavy crudes in Iran, Venezuela, and Kuwait
 had fallen by 2.3 million barrels per day or 35 per-
 cent. In contrast, output in other OPEC countries
 has risen by 2.5 million barrels per day or 15 per-
 cent. In Iran, output traditionally has consisted of
 about half heavy oil and half light oil. In recent
 months, heavy crude exports have been cut by
 nearly half, whereas light crude sales have been at
 near capacity levels.
 The market is unlikely to provide any quick
 relief for the heavy oil producers. The drop in
 heavy crude consumption stems from the con-
 tinuing recession  in industrial countries.
 Moreover, although relatively little substitution of
 other fuels for OPEC oil has occurred, that which
 has taken place has been at the expense of heavy
 fuel oil. In Western Europe, natural gas from the
 Netherlands and the North Sea is being used un-
 der boilers to replace heavy oil, while growing
 steam coal consumption in Japan, the US, and
 Western Europe is reducing use of heavy oil by
 utilities.
 Light oil producers, on the other hand, are
 enjoying strong demand for their low-sulfur
 high-gravity crudes. They are taking steps to boost
 prices above those set last October to reflect this
 rise in demand. Nigeria has just boosted its prices
 by an average of 40 cents a barrel.
 The heavy oil producers are steadfastly refus-
 ing to cut prices. OPEC countries are keenly
 aware of the problem, which they view as mainly
 one of differentials. We believe the problem is
 more basic and that even if the heavy oil
 producers reduce their prices to reflect current
 market trends, they will probably continue to
 have problems marketing their oil. Unless world
 economic recovery is more rapid than we expect,
 heavy fuel oil use will lag behind growth in con-
 sumption of light oil products, and the demand
 for heavy crude will remain low relative to lighter
 crude.
 Establishing and maintaining realistic oil
 quality differentials has been one of OPEC's most
 difficult problems. Disagreements over the
 proper level of such adjustments have strained
 cartel unity on several occasions, most recently at
 the Vienna meeting in December, where most of
 the members attacked Iraq for shaving prices by
 offering inadequate quality and freight differen-
 tials. In fact, most of the difficulties faced by Iran,
 Venezuela, and Kuwait were caused by a sharp
 shift in relative product prices, which had made
 their crude oils uncompetitive. Had the meeting
 not been disrupted by the kidnaping, the oil
 ministers would probably have taken some steps
 to remedy the growing gap between market
 values and official differentials.
 OPEC is likely to respond to the situation
 over the next few months by a series of ad hoc
 measures that will gradually widen existing gravity
 differentials. Prices for heavy crude oils will be
 lowered, while those for light crudes will rise.
 Even if the price of Saudi benchmark oil remains
 frozen through June-as OPEC announced
 following the pricing decision of last
 September-the overall cost of oil to consumers
 will probably rise, since more light oil is being
 produced.
 The US will be particularly hard hit by a
 re-arrangement of quality differentials, since it
 imports primarily light crudes. The recent
 Nigerian price boost may increase US annual oil
 import costs by $130 million. If crude prices adjust
 to reflect fully current product prices, total crude
 oil to the US will rise by about $200 million per
 year. Western Europe and Japan will face smaller
 rises in their oil bills since they use more heavy
