 October 1959-January 1960'
 1.  CIA Periodic Requirements Lists (PRL's), which are prepared
 by the Office of Current Intelligence in CIA, are designed to point
 up the information required for current intelligence coverage of
 significant developments during the 4-month time period covered by
 each PRL.
 2.  Coordination with the Department of.State includes the PRL's
 for all the world areas:   (a) the USSR,  (b) Eastern Europe,
 (c) Western Europe,  (d) Near East/Africa, (e) Far East and (f) Latin
 America.  As a result, the PRL's include current intelligence
 requirements from the Intelligence and Regional Bureaus of the State
 Department, as well as those from the CIA Offices of Current Intelli-
 gence (OCI), Research and Reports (ORR) and Scientific Intelligence
 (OSI).  'In'addition, the PRL's include major intelligence deficiencies
 noted in the Post-Mortems of appropriate National Intelligence Esti-
 mates (NIE's) approved by the US Intelligence Board (USIB)--the
 principal governing body for US intelligence, comprised ofthe
 heads of all US intelligence agencies under the chairmanship of
 the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI).
 3.  The PRL's are disseminated to the collection components of
 all USIB agencies.   It is recognized that the Lists may, in total,
 present requirements beyond the mission and capabilities of any
 single collection facility.  However,  to the extent that the
 collector has a capability, it is hoped that these PRL's will
 provide effective guidance for current intelligence reporting.
 For those collectors who may not have access to background infor-
 mation, explanatory paragraphs have been submitted with many of
 the requirements.
 4.   To facilitiate and possibly expand the use of the PRL, all
 items contained herein have been classified separately and bear one
 of the following classifications:   SECRET (S), SECRET/NOFORN (S/NOFORN),
 CONFIDENTIAL (C), CONFIDENTIAL/NOFORN (C/NOFORN), OFFICIAL USE ONLY
 (OUO), and UNCLASSIFIED (U).
 5.   Comments on the PRL's are encouraged and should be directed

 (1 October 1959 - 31 January 1960)
 The Ne Win regime has announced to Parliament that elections will
 be held in the last week of January or the first week of February 1960.
 There is every indication that the elections will be held on schedule
 and that the army and Ne Win plan to exercise behind-the-scenes control
 over a parliamentary government formed by the Ba Swe-Kyaw Nyein faction
 of the Anti-Fascist   People's Freedom League, the expected winner of
 the elections.   Of prime interest, therefore, during the next four
 months will be the election campaign, particularly information suggest-
 ing the probable outcome of the elections.   Also of importance will be
 information on the impact of the Laotian crisis, the Sino-Indian border
 clashes, and the Eisenhower-Khrushchev exchanges on the direction of
 Burmese foreign policy.
 A.   Political - Internal
 1.   Ne Win's intentions.   As the increasingly unquestioned
 boss of Burma's military esta   ishment, the intentions of General Ne
 Win continue to be of prime importance.   Of interest will be information
 on the degree to which Ne Win will permit the army to rig the elections
 in favor of the Ba Swe-Kyaw Nyein faction;  the criteria by which he
 will judge the performance of the expected Ba Swe government in the
 light of his reported promise to permit the military to resume control
 should Ba Swe founder;  the degree to which he will personally interest
 himself in governmental affairs once he steps down as premier;  and his
 sympathies as regards'the various political parties.   Information on
 his attitude toward the US in general and toward US military forces
 and military policy in particular,  is desired.   (C)
 2.   Relationship between Ne Win and the "political colonels".
 Any evidence of serious divergency of views or goals?  Any evidence
 the "political colonels" intend to leave the army to pursue openly
 political careers at the head of an army-favored party?   (C)
 3.   Relationships among political leaders:   Relationships
 between U Nu and Ba Swe.   Re a ions hips between U Nu and Kyaw Nyein.
 Relationships between Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein.   Relationships between
 We Win and each of the forementioned leaders.   Possibility of recon-
 ciliation among foregoing three leaders or between U Nu and either
 of the other two.   Attitude and intentions of Dr. E. Maung.   Transfers

 A.   Political
 1.   The latest pro-Western swing in Cambodia's pendulum-
 like neutrality policy under the leadership of Crown Prince Sihan-
 ouk, may take on more significance than have previous such moves.
 Sihanouk, already shaken by Communist Chinese repression in Tibet,
 is seriously concerned over the Communist insurgency in neighbor-
 ing Laos;  India's border troubles with Communist China is an addi-
 tional factor.   While these developments thus far have not dis-
 lodged Sihanouk's official subscription to a policy of neutrality,
 there are indications he is beginning to take a more realistic at-
 titude toward the danger of Communist subversion.  Continuing in-

 9.   Nuclear Ener
 a.   The Chinese nuclear energy program entered an active
 phase when the 6-10 MW research reactor supplied by the USSR came
 into operation in mid-1958 at the Institute of Atomic Energy in
 Peking.    Other nuclear energy research centers are reported to be at
 Wuhan, T:Lentain, Hsi-An, Canton, and Shanghai.   Very little informa-
 tion is available on any aspect of the Chinese nuclear energy program.
 (S)
 (1)  Where are the Chinese centers for nuclear energy
 research---exact locations and site layouts?  What information is
 available on the number of persons employed, names of leading per-
 sonnel, equipment in operation or under construction and major re- -
 search efforts at each research center?   (OUO)
 (2)  What is the extent of the exploitation (pros-
 pecting, mining and refining) of domestic supplies of nuiclear :raw
 materials;  such as, uranium,  thorium, zirconium, and beryllium? (OUO)
 (3)  What is the extent of production of heavy water
 and nuclear pure graphite?   (OUO)
 (4)  What is the extent of Soviet and Satellite
 assistance in the Chinese nuclear energy program-personnel, train-
 ing, supply of equipment, and in the exploitation of raw materials?
 (OUO)
 (5)  What are the plans for the use of nuclear energy
 in a weapons program?    Are there any plans for the Chinese to ac-
 quire nuclear weapons from the USSR?  What nuclear weapons testing
 and storage sites have been planned or constructed?    What is the
 extent of nuclear weapons training given to Chinese troops?  (C)
 10,   Scientific and
 Technical Manpower and Education
 a,   A new graduate degree program got underway in
 1956 and a new policy of sending only graduate students for train-
 ing in the Soviet Union was announced in mid-1957, both programs
 aimed at increasing the number of scientists.   Since the Fall of
 1957 nothing has been said about these programs by the Communists,
 In June 1958, there was an announcement of the establishment of a
 new University of Science and Technology,   A February 1959 Communist
 announcement indicated that only 5,500 Chinese students were studying

 in the Soviet Union.   This number is far fewer than would be expected
 from the quotas set up in the First Five-Year plan and indicates that
 the rate of sending new students to the Soviet Union was reduced from
 about 2,000 per year to less than 200 per year for the years 1957 and
 1958.  Information is needed on the graduate training program and on
 training in the Soviet Union and other Bloc countries.   (C)
 (1)  Has the quality of undergraduate training been a
 major hindrance to the expansion of the graduate training program? (C)
 (2)  Was the new University of Science and Technology
 established because the regular universities and colleges had failed
 to prepare students adequately for graduate work?   (C)
 (3)  Has the expansion of the graduate program in
 China been temporarily postponed pending the improvement of under-
 graduate preparation?   (C)
 (4)   Is the great change in the rate of sending stu-
 dents to the Soviet Union a result of the new policy. of sending only
 graduate students?       (C)
 (5)   Is the new policy ending the dispatch of under-
 graduate students to the Soviet Union the consequence of 1) an effort
 to conserve foreign exchange, 2) a reluctance on the part of the
 Soviet Union to accept large numbers of Chinese students, 3) some
 political reason such as possibly a Chinese Communist desire to avoid
 exposing undergraduates to the somewhat more liberal atmosphere of
 Soviet universities, or 4) for some other reason?   (C)
 (6)   Is there any indication of the Soviet Union at-
 tempting to hold back the expansion of the number of well=--trained
 Chinese scientists?           (C)

 E.   Economic                              October 1.959-January 1960
 1.   General
 a. Agricultural and industrial targets for the
 Chinese Communist Second Five Year Plan (1958-62) were fitst
 made public at the Eighth National Party Congress in 1956.  Many
 of the goals for 1962 were claimed to have been surpassed in the
 great "leap forward" effort of 1958, but because of the drive to
 achieve higher physical output at almost any costs, it is, believed
 that plans and the planning system were thrown into disorder.
 Skepticism about their claims for 1958 and their goals for 1959
 were Justified by the Central Committee communique of 26 August 1959,
 in which figures for the 1958 production of several important
 agricultural and industrial commodities were lowered,  and. the four
 main targets of grain, cotton, steel, and coal for 1959 were cut
 back.  To improve our understanding of current economic activity in
 Communist China we would like to obtain information on the
 following:
 (1)  Further revisions of agricultural and
 industrial targets for 1959 and for the Second Five Year Plan as
 a whole.   (U)
 (2)  Any evidence that the exaggerated claims for
 agricultural production in 1958 have been revised even further.
 Any information on the division of the 1958 and 1959 grain figures
 into their components - rice, wheat, corn, sweet potatoes, etc.  (U)
 (3)  Any information ofa conflict between a group
 in the top leadership urging "Balanced and rational" planning and
 a group urging a renewal and intensification of the "leap forward".(U)
 b.   Developments during the early period of the commune
 movement are fairly well known by now, but a new trend is currently
 developing -- a decided slackening of control over the daily lives
 and activities of the commune members.  The recent developments which
 indicate an apparent drawing back from the full-blown commune idea
 are:   a relaxation in the regulations governing membership in
 messhalls; the reinstatement of private plots to households; the
 return of some livestock to individual care; a reemphasis on sideline
 occupations; an increased emphasis on incentive wages; the opening
 of limited free markets within communes; and the reported reopening
 of "lower level tax offices" to improve the work of collecting rural
 taxes.  We would like supporting evidence on the above developments--
 evidence which does not appear in. the press or periodicals, or over
 broadcasts which we normally receive.  Attention should be given
 both to evidence of deterioration of the structure of the commune;
 and to more recent Party reaffirmation of the vital role of the
 commune.  Have any concessions granted to the peasants been withdrawn?
 Have any functions been restored to the communes?   (U)

 a.         During the winter months,     the Communists planned
 to complete numerous large-scale water conservancy projects
 throughout the country.   (U)
 (U)
 (1)  What increase in irrigated acreage has resulted?
 (2)  What effect has the water conservancy effort
 had on the land utilization pattern of the country?   (U)
 (3)  What percent of the-grain crops in China by
 type were under irrigation in 1959?   (U)
 b.   During the winter months fertilizers were accumulated
 for application on spring and summer sown crops. -(U)
 accumulated?   (U)
 (1)  How much fertilizer, by type and amount, was
 (2)  What was the rate of application on the various
 spring and summer sown crops?   (U)
 c.   Food shortages were reported in various areas
 during 1959.   Official sources attribute shortages in urban areas
 to lack of transport.  Further information is desired on the causes
 of shortages, their severity, their duration, and on the measures
 taken by the regime to end shortages.   (U)
 d.   To what extent has hog-raising, poultry-raising
 and production of vegetables and other subsidiary items reverted
 to private management?   (U)
 e.   The Communists have announced plans to double-crop
 areas of North China with wheat and rice.   What progress was
 achieved during 1958 and 1959?   (U)
 f.   During 1959, Communist China has been beset with
 various natural calamities, primarily floods and severe droughts.
 Although the Communists may be exaggerating to some extent the
 seriousness of the weather conditions in order to cover up
 agricultural policy mistakes,  sufficient information on weather
 conditions is available which substantiates to some extent their
 occurrence.  (U)

 f.      (1)  What has been the extent of crop damage due
 to natural calamities in 1959?  How -much area affected?  What were
 the yield losses by crops?   (U)
 (2)  How effective have their irrigation facilities
 been, particularly those constructed during the leap--forward period,
 in reducing losses? (U)
 (3)  To what extent have irrigation facilities such
 as ponds, catchment basins, reservoirs, etc., which are primarily
 dependent upon rainfall, been effective in alleviating drought
 conditions?   (U)
 g.     The Chinese Communists have made little mention
 of their 1959 cotton crop.   The original plan called for a crop of
 5 million tons, recently lowered to 2.3 million tons.  The unusual
 lack of reporting on this crop would tend to raise suspicions as to
 the actual condition of the crop.   (U)
 (1)  How much area was planted to cotton in 1959?(U)
 (2)  Has the cotton crop suffered exceptionally
 high losses due to natural calamities in 1959?   (U)
 h.   What is the composition bf miscellaneous grains,
 by type and amount, for 1958 and 1959?  '(U)
 i.   Deep-plowing was to have been accomplished on most
 of the area sown to winter wheat in the Fall of 1958.  What effect
 has this had on yields and total production of the wheat crops? (U)
 What spring and summer sown crops were grown on deep-plowed land? (U)
 J.   The quality of published statistics, especially
 in agriculture, deteriorated in 1958.   The August 1959 communique
 of the Central Committee contained sharp downward revisions of the
 original :1958 production claims, but some (e.g., grains) still
 appear high.   In addition, no breakdown was given as to the com-
 position of the revised 250 million ton claim for grain. We would
 be interested in any further discussions and evaluations of the
 1958 claims.   (C)
 k.   Communist announcements of the value of agricultural
 and industrial production are now being given in 1957'prices instead
 of constant 1952 prices that were reported for the period up through
 1957.   In evaluating price changes, information on farm procurement
 prices and prices for producer goods is of particular importance.

 number of women working on farms and the importance of this work.
 Any information on this subject, particularly numbers of women
 employed, tasks to which they are assigned, whether they work in
 teams with men or separately, their pay compared to men, and what
 jobs the men are concentrating on now that women have become more
 important in farm work is of interest.   (U)
 M.   State farms are still mentioned by Peiping.   What
 is their present purpose, are their numbers increasing, how many are
 there now in each province, what are the plans for their future, what
 is their relationship to the communes and local government in general?
 Is:there any indication that they may be the forerunner of an

 production of methane gas for local heating, power, and lighting?(U)
 3.   Transportation
 a.   During 1959-60 continued increases in Chinese
 railroad traffic performance can probably be achieved only by
 sizeable increases in the freight car and locomotive parks, rather
 than by much further improvement in operating efficiency, where the
 limits appear already to have been reached or exceeded.   (S)

 freight cars and locomotives at the end of 1958, mid-1959, and the
 end of 1959?   (S)

 (3)  What was the absolute level of railroad
 investment in 1959, and the breakdown of investment among new
 line construction, improvement of existing lines,  and increase
 in the rolling stock park?   (S)
 b. Although the Chinese have recently released more
 data concerning the commodity composition of freight traffic,  the
 information is not adequate for a completely accurate appraisal of
 commodity movements.   (C)

 large portion of this 73 percent increase, what additional labor
 was required?   (C)
 e,    The Chinese Communists realized the tremendous
 gains of 1.958 in motor truck transport largely by increased
 utilization of trucks.   This created a shortage of spare parts.  (S)

 performance in 1959?        (C)

 Iron and Steel
 a,   The Chinese Communist plan to produce 12 million
 tons of crude steel in 1959.  At the beginning of 1959, Communist
 China lacked sufficient casting, forging, and rolling facilities to
 finish 12 million tons of crude steel.  As a result, the Chinese
 are trying to build or import enough finishing equipment to remedy
 the situation.   China has not published any official, annual
 production figures for steel mill products (rolled steel, forgings,
 castings) since 1956, probably because of the imbalance between
 crude steel and steel finishing capacity.
 (1)   Report any information relating; to the
 success or failure of Communist China to provide enough finishing
 facilities to match its crude steel production.   (C)

 Year Plan(1958--60) requires that by the end of 1960 all peasants
 be organized into cooperatives; the pace of the program, therefore,
 will have to be accelerated if this goal is to be met. It is felt.
 that any such speed-up in socialization would be resented by the

 Marshal Sarit, his health apparently at least temporarily
 stabilized, is extremely active in directing his personal attention
 to virtually every facet of government administration.  At the same
 time, however, grumbling within the ruling military group over Sarit's
 alleged failure to consult it on policy matters or to take its in-
 terest adequately into consideration is increasing.  The attitudes
 of Sarit's military supporters, particularly any firm indications of
 an intent to oust him, will be an important intelligence target during
 the next four months,  Also of continuing interest are Sarit's plans
 in his campaign to revitalize the government administrative structure,
 promote economic development, and limit domestic communism.   The im-
 pact of the Laotian crisis, the Sino-Indian frontier dispute, and the
 Eisenhower-Khrushchev exchanges on the degree of resolution of Thai-
 land?s anti--Sino-Soviet bloc posture will also be of great interest.
 1.   Factionalism within ruling clique:   Relationships between
 Sarit's followers in the coup group will be of vital intelligence in-
 terest.                           In particular, what is the status of relations between Thanom
 and Prapat?  Is there any evidence that they have quietly worked out
 a modus vivendi which would permit them to share power as successors
 to Sarit?  What other leaders might challenge their positions?  In
 particular, what chances have the Punnakan brothers to achieve power?
 (C)
 2.   Popular attitudes toward Ruling Clique:   Reactions to the
 military?s overthrow of the constitution.  Any indications that op-
 position politicians, most of whom are now stripped of assembly status,
 may try to incite the populace, particularly students, into overt pro-
 test against the authoritarian regime.   (C)
 3.   The Monarch :   Relations between the King and leading
 members of military group.       Any evidence that the royal family is
 secretly egging on potentially disaffected elements in the military
 to overthrow Sarit?  (C)
 4.   Corruption:   Any evidence that Sarit is seriously follow-
 ing through on his stated intention to reduce corruption.   Effect on
 intra-coup group politics of any Sarit moves to reduce corruption, or
 at least to centralize graft to a greater degree.   (C)
