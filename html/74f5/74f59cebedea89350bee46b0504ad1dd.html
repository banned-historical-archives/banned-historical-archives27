 Hammarskjold's Efforts
 UN Secretary General Ham-
 marskjold apparently obtained
 in his talks in Cairo some
 small adjustments in Egypt's
 position regarding the opera-
 tion of the Suez Canal, and
 some assurances that Nasr does
 not intend to make any sudden,
 drastic move on the question
 of navigation of the Gulf of
 Aqaba.   However, he'had little
 progress to'show on the Gaza
 strip issue.
 Egyptian-Israeli relations
 were the subject of Hammar-
 skjold's early interviews with
 Nasr.   An agreement appears to
 have been reached that the
 UNEF should exercise some po
 lice powers in the Gaza strip,
 if only to protect  its own
 equipment.   On the more basic
 question of the future over-
 all role of the UNEF, the Egyp-
 tian leader seems to be willing
 to keep the UNEF as a buffer' force
 to protect the strip---and the
 Sinai--from possible Israeli
 military action, even if the
 Israelis refuse to allow UN
 troops on their side of the
 border.
 Nasr reportedly considers
 the Gulf of Aqaba .issue as a
 secondary question at this
 stage, and indicated he would
 not seek to replace the small
 UNEF contingent at Sharm al-
 Shaikh with Egyptian troops.
 It appears that Nasr is con-
 tent for the time being to let
 Saudi Arabia bear the burdeni
 of argument against the Israeli
 claim to freedom of navigation,
 while he gives an appearance
 of reasonableness by allowing
 CO-YL tD1-
 hints that Egypt would abide
 by a decision of the Interna-
 tional Court of Justice.
 The burden of the six- and
 eight-hour marathon talks over
 last week end, however, was
 the future of the canal.   Ham-
 marskjold reportedly believes
 his task was complicated by
 Krishna  Menon,  India's rov-
 ing diplomat who had visited
 Cairo just before the secretary
 general arrived there and who
 may well have excited Nasr's
 suspicions of the Western pro-
 posal on canal tolls.   What
 Haminarskjold got from Nasr was
 essentially an elaboration of
 the Egyptian memorandum of the
 previous week.   Nasr agreed to
 set aside 30 percent of the
 canal toll income--25 percent
 for development work and 5
 percent for compensation to
 the stockholders of the Suez
 Canal Company.   Egypt would,
 however, deposit the tolls,
 which are authorized to be paid
 to the account of the Egyptian
 authority, either with the
 Bank of International Settle-
 ments (BIS) in Switzerland or
 the National Bank of Egypt.
 The use of the BIS, an inter-
 national "bankers' bank" which
 acts as agent for central banks
 in the European Payments Union,
 may be designed to appear as a
 concession, though it in fact
 in no way affects Egypt's ex-
 clusive control of the funds.
 Nasr reportedly believes
 that these proposals will in
 fact be the permanent settle-
 men?t of the canal issue, rather
 than the interim arrangement
 which the West has sought be-
 fore final settlement. According

 to the memorandum, Egypt ex-
 pects to open the canal to all
 shipping in mid-April.
 The Israelis have assumed
 an air of disinterest in Ham-
 marskjold's negotiations.   Is-
 raeli foreign minister Meir  .
 told Ambassador Lawson that she
 doubted the secretary general
 would come to Israel, since
 he would not have anything
 worthwhile to bring,   Israeli
 spokesmen have continued their
 propaganda war against Hammar-
 skjold personally, whom they
 assert is unfavorably biased
 in regard to Israel, and against
 the UN generally, which they
 now accuse of merely protecting
 Egypt and other Arab states
 from the consequences of their
 folly.   .
 Hammarskjold did not even
 try to visit Israel as he had
 planned, reportedly because he
 was informed he would not even
 be given an interview with
 Prime Minister Ben-Gurion.
 Jordan
 The political scene in
 Jordan remains confused.   No
 significant overt moves have
 been made by the king and his
 conservative allies or by the
 leftist influences which domi-
 atmosphere in Amman is such
 that Prime Minister Nabulsi has
 announced, without contradic-
 tion, that his government is
 determined to recognize Com-
 munist China.   In a speech to
 a labor union rally, Nabulsi
 referred to alleged similari-
 ties between the Chinese and
 the Arabs, who had both "thrown
 off the imperialist yoke."
 Saudi Arabia-Lebanon
 Saudi Arabia and Lebanon
 meanwhile have issued a com-
 munique stating among other
 aims their determination to
 fight the expansion of Communist
 influence.   This statement was
 a product of Lebanese president
 Chamoun's visit to Riyadh--one
 of a, series of meetings between
 King Saud and pro-Western lead-
 ers in the Middle East.   Saud,
 who previously enjoyed a visit
 from the Shah of Iran, has also

 THE ATTACK ON THE MOLLET GOVERNMENT
 The general policy debate
 which started on 14 March in
 the French National Assembly
 has brought out more and sharper
 opposition to the Mollet govern-.
 ment than had heretofore been
 evident.   The debate revealed
 a new critical attitude on the
 part of the right-center and a
 more serious threat to Mollet's
 position than any since he took
 office in January 1956.

 considered to be appreciably
 stronger as a result of his
 visit to Washington and France's
 good showing in the UN debate
 on Algeria.   His position was
 put in a new light by the heavy
 attacks on government policies
 on a variety of topics ranging
 from constitutional revision to
 Algeria, but' chiefly on economic
 and financial questions.
 A broad segment of politi-
 cal opinion has been increasing-
 ly alarmed over France's dwin-
 dling monetary reserves, the
 growing inflationary trend, and
 the inadequacy of Mollet's
 measures to correct these weak-
 nesses.   The prospect of budget
 cuts, particularly in military
 appropriations, has split his
 cabinet, and Finance Minister
 Ramadier's inept defense of
 government policy before the
 assembly did little to appease
 his critics among the Radicals
 and conservative Independents.
 Moreover, Ramadier's hint of
 SECRET
 new taxes further irritated
 this element in the assembly.
 The government's North
 African program has also en-
 countered growing opposition
 from right-wing groups, which
 want a stronger policy toward
 Morocco and Tunisia, as well
 as Algeria.   Minister Resident
 in Algeria Lacoste's lengthy
 defense of French policy failed
 to win back supporters lost
 over economic problems, despite
 his efforts to water down the
 conciliatory aspects of the
 Algerian program announced by
 Mol]'.et on 9 January.
 During the debate, the
 premier was forced to concede
 that: the fate of his minority
 government of Socialists and
 some Radicals and Social Repub-
 licans rested largely in the
 hands of the conservative Peas-
 ant and Independent bloc, which
 controls 100 votes.   On the two

 it clear that its support is
 increasingly tenuous.   Its

 that its future position will
 be determined more and more by
 the extent to which the ground-

 Planning for an alternative

 hitherto been inhibited by the
 reluctance of right-center
 elements to provoke a crisis

 The political arithmetic
 of  the National Assembly has
 also been a major source of
 Mol:Let's strength.   Since any
 successor government would
 probably require either the
 support or the acquiescence of
 the 100 Socialist votes he

 been able to use the confidence

 to win grudging support.   Now,

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 REACTIONS TO THE BERMUDA. CONFERENCE
 Most European comment on
 the Bermuda conference of Pres-
 ident Eisenhower and Prime Min-
 ister Macmillan has enthusiasti-
 cally endorsed "the restoration"
 of Anglo-American harmony, but
 in the Middle East and South
 Asia, countries not members of
 the Baghdad pact have vented
 their resentment,
 The British press with
 rare unan     y has applauded
 the conference for restoring
 "close and friendly relations"
 with'the United States.   This
 contrasts with the cool ad-
 vance notices the meeting re-
 ceived.  Most comments credited
 Macmillan with achieving far
 more than was expected and
 suggested he scored many points.
 The only important sour note
 appeared in some criticism'of
 tue decision to continue tests
 of nuclear weapons,
 In France official quarters
 have expressed "great satisfac-
 tion" over the'agreement be-
 tween France's two major allies,
 but the press has added criti-
 cism that their differing views
 on methods left the prospect of
 joint Western action in the
 Near East crisis still pending.
 There also appeared some hints
 from Paris that Western "Big
 Three" relations would not be
 restored to their pre-Suez
 status until the three meet
 together again--thus suggesting
 that French eyes will be focused
 on the NATO ministerial meetings
 in early May.  The comparatively
 limited reaction to Bermuda re-
 ported from other European
 countries has been generally
 favorable.
 In the Middle East, all
 Baghdad pact powers welcomed
 the American offer to join the
 pact's military committee.
 King: Saud has not yet mentioned
 the matter of the Baghdad pact
 to Ambassador Wadsworth, but
 one of his principal advisers
 has condemned the American of-
 fer.   Indian press comment has
 also attacked the pact announce-
 ment.
 The Arab press has been
 almost universally hostile to
 the very holding of the con-
 ference, taking it as evidence
 that the United States is again
 in league with the "arch-
 imperialist."  Damascus radio
 reminded "the two states that
 the source of all troubles in
 the Middle East is the attempt
 of certain big powers to make
 decisions on Middle Eastern
 affairs without reference to
 the Arabs or asking their opin-
 ion,;" Behind a similar charge
 from Nasr's controlled press--
 that Arab problems had been
 ignored at Bermuda--lies the
 complaint that the United States
 and Britain are concerting
 together, which has the effect,
 of restricting the Arab states
 freedom of action.
 The central theme of Soviet
 propaganda on the conferencee5~s-
 been its alleged failure to
 overcome acute Anglo-American
 disagreements.   (For another
 aspect of the Soviet treatment,
 see the following article.)
 Soviet broadcasts to the United
 Kingdom have concentrated on the
 themes of British concessions to
 the:US and American.:domina-
 tion  of British policy to the
 detriment of British interests
 Moscow's comments beamed
 to the Arabs portray Anglo-
 American rivalry as secondary
 to the pursuit of common "colo-
 nialist"  aims in the Middle

 East.    The American decision to
 adhere to the Baghdad pact mili-
 tary committee was described
 as further proof of the aggres-
 sive aims of the American Middle
 East proposals.  Pravda com-
 mented on 26 Marcftt a "there
 is no difference between the
 colonizers' Baghdad pact and
 the colonialist policy expounded
 in the Eisenhower Doctrine" and
 Moscow radio charged that Amer-
 ican adherence. to  the military
 committee, following the "proc-
 lamation  of the Eisenhower
 Doctrine," destroys "the myth
 of the anticolonialism of the
 United States."
 USSR PRESSES PROPOSAL FOR
 On 26 March Soviet Foreign
 Ministry press chief Ilychev
 announced that the USSR is pre-
 pared to conclude an agreement
 for the "temporary" suspension
 of nuclear tests.   This was
 intended to counter the Bermuda
 proposal for advance registra-
 tion of tests with the UN and
 "limited international observa-
 tion" of tests.   It was also
 designed to contrast Moscow's
 demand for immediate suspension
 with the Anglo-American posi-
 tion that "continued nuclear
 testing is required" to main-
 tain the West's nuclear deter-
 rent capability.
 This modification of Soviet
 demands over the past year for
 an agreement to ban nuclear
 tests independent of other dis-
 armament problems provides
 further evidence of Moscow's
 determination to focus world
 attention on the test issue and
 its belief that the United
 States and Britain are particu-
 larly vulnerable on this point.
 The Soviet leaders are seeking
 to develop this into a major
 Chinese Communist comment
 on the con erence  o  owed the
 Soviet line, charging that
 alleged American efforts to
 "control" and "supplant" the
 British will be a source of
 continuing conflict between the
 two countries.  Peiping asserted
 that British hopes for any real
 concessions were disappointed,
 and that MacMillan was compelled
 to approve measures which would
 increase Washington's domination.
 American adherence to the mili-
 tary committee,of the Baghdad
 pact, according to Peiping, was
 a move to edge the British out
 "colonialists."
 and take over their role as
 SUSPENDING NUCLEAR TESTS

 ploit growing sentiment among

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 March 1957
 Soviet defense minister
 Zhukov recently departed from
 the standard Soviet propaganda
 line when he described nuclear
 weapons as the decisive element
 in a future war.   In a speech
 to the All-Army Conference of
 Distinguished Army Men on 16
 March,  he rejected arguments
 that no one would ever use
 atomic weapons because of fear
 of mutual destruction.   He
 asserted that atomic weapons
 would be the main means for
 defeat, and would be introduced
 on a wide scale as a standard
 weapon.
 This is the first time a
 Soviet leader has publicly
 given such weight to the role
 of atomic weapons.   In August
 1956, in answer to questions
 submitted by an American cor-
 respondent,  Zhukov rejected
 the suggestion that air forces
 equipped with nuclear weapons
 are the dominating aspect of
 armed forces,  and said that
 nuclear weapons cannot, by
 themselves,  decide the issue
 of an armed struggle.   Similar
 remarks, emphasizing balanced
 forces,  and conventional weap-
 ons.  as essential corollaries
 to nuclear weapons,  have typi-
 fied Soviet statements on the
 character of future warfare.
 Zhukov's latest statement
 may be in part a reaction to
 President Eisenhower's announce-
 ment that the United States
 will station atomic support
 commands abroad to bolster the
 defense forces of other free
 world nations.   Soviet propa
 ganda seems to have been in-
 tended primarily to intimidate
 the prospective participants
 in the American plan.
 Zhukov implied in his
 speech that the United States,
 as well as the other NATO
 countries,  is vulnerable when
 he called American calculations
 naive and said that the Soviet
 air force is "able to deal
 crippling blows to the enemy
 wherever he is, wherever he
 hides."   Furthermore,  he added
 that the USSR is also subject
 to nuclear attack, a point
 generally ignored in Soviet
 statements.
 in by OSI)
 Zhukov's speech may have
 been released with the idea of
 influencing the current disar-
 mament negotiations in London.
 The USSR has maintained that a
 major step in any disarmament
 program is the elimination of
 nuclear weapons from national
 armaments.                 Concurred    25X1
 SOVIET UNION WARNS NORWAY ON' NUCLEAR BASES
 Premier Bulganin's letter
 of 21 March to Nrwegian pre-
 mier Gerhardsen.warned against
 any expansion in Norway's mili-
 tary commitments to NATO.
 The blunt warnings to Nor-
 way were contained in an other-
 wise moderate note aimed osten-
 sibly at exploring ways of con-
 tinuing the improvement of

 relations between the two
 states.   Bulganin warned that
 the Norwegian people "might
 have to pay dearly" if Norway
 became  a base for atomic
 attack on the Soviet Union,
 since the USSR would be forced
 to retaliate with a "destructive
 blow against the aggressor and
 also against the bases which
 are located near our borders."
 The most immediate purpose
 of this letter was probably to
 deter Norway from accepting
 new missiles and rockets which
 can be equipped with atomic
 warheads.   It also was intended
 to warn against any Norwegian
 decision to change its policy
 of barring foreign troops from
 its soil, as applied to Ameri-
 can forces equipped with atomic
 weapons.   Although Bulganin
 said he was not asking for early
 Norwegian renunciation of NATO,
 he warned that as long as Norway
 is a member,  its territory and
 bases will be used by NATO
 forces in wartime and it will
 therefore be exposed to re-
 taliatory attack.
 The propaganda campaign
 against American plans to.
 station atomic-equipped units
 abroad has been pressed
 strongly in a number of.coun-
 tries,  beginning with a TASS
 statement in January warning
 against the risks of Soviet
 retaliation.   The letter to
 Norway is the first formal
 communication,  but there have
 been a number of informal
 diplomatic warnings to other
 countries.
 There have also been re-
 ports that the Norwegian and
 Danish Communist Parties have
 been instructed to step up
 their anti-NATO campaign;
 these parties have already been
 warning against the introduction
 of atomic weapons.
 Efforts of National Party
 chairman Suwirjo to form a "bus-
 iness cabinet," in accordance
 with President Sukarno's instruc-
 tions of 25 March,  appear likely
 to be undermined by the attitude
 of the Nahdlatui Ulama (NU),
 Indonesia's third largest party.
 A business cabinet,  by
 Indonesian definition, is formed
 of "experts," irrespective of
 party affiliation.   Formateur
 Suwirjo is accordingly approach-
 ing possible ministerial candi-
 dates as individuals rather than
 as party members.   The NU,  how-
 ever,  continues to regard cabi-
 net negotiations from a partisan
 position,  and has reportedly
 ordered its members not to
 accept posts in the cabinet
 without the party's approval.
 Kasimo have both been quoted
 as stating that their parties
 wil:L not participate in the new
 administration should Suwirjo
 invite Communists or even fellow
 travelers to join it.   There are
 other indications that the NU
 has aligned itself with the
 anti-Communist Masjumi and non-
 Javanese areas generally in the
 demand that former vice president
 Hatta be given important politi-
 cal responsibility in the govern-
 ment.
 President Sukarno resorted
 to the idea of a business cabi-
 net after Suwirjo had failed in
 a   :LO-day effort to form a parlia-
 mentary cabinet.   Suwirjo's
 initial failure was also caused
 by the NU,which,  in opposition
 to terms imposed by. Sukarno,  had
 insisted on including the Masjumi
 NU deputy chairman Dachlan               in a non-Communist cabinet.
 and Catholic Party chairman                     Sukarno apparently hopes a

 business cabinet can side-step
 Moslem demands and permit the
 formation of a cabinet which
 either includes both Masjumi
 and Communist representatives
 or excludes them both.
 The Communist Party has
 threatened a nationwide strike
 by Sobsi, the Communist-
 controlled and largest labor
 federation in Indonesia, if
 the Masjumi is included in the
 cabinet and the Communists are
 barred.  Army headquarters and
 the territorial commanders,
 however, reportedly have agreed
 to deal "ruthlessly" with any
 strikers.
 The army, through the chief
 of ,staff, has warned that it
 plans to stamp out corruption
 in government--one of the basic
 causes of the current crisis.
 In this connection, several
 prominent political leaders
 have already been called in for
 questioning by military authori-
 ties.   Despite an army dis-
 claimer,  concern is growing in
 Djakarta over the possibility
 of the emergence of            y
 junta.
 POLITICAL SITUATION IN PAKISTAN
 President Mirza's action
 on 21 March suspending the West
 Pakistan  legislative assembly
 and taking over the functions
 of the provincial government
 came as the climax to intensive
 maneuvering by all major polit-
 ical  groups.   The result may
 be a realignment of forces in
 both West and East Pakistan
 which may favor the present
 regime.
 Both Mirza and Prime Minis-
 ter Suhrawardy have been identi-
 fied with moves to reshuffle
 various factions of the con-
 tending parties into a combina-
 tion which would strengthen
 their leadership and isolate
 dissident leftist elements.
 Pressure to form a new
 combination resulted from the
 growing strength of the Moslem
 League in the West Pakistan
 assembly.   By co-operating
 with the left-wing Pakistan
 National Party, the Moslem
 League was in a position to
 bring down the Republican
 government in the western
 province.   Defeat of the
 Republicans at the provincial
 level would have endangered
 the Republican-Awami League
 coalition in the national
 government.   When a considerable
 number of Republicans defected
 to the opposition on 21 March,
 making the overthrow of the
 West Pakistan government in-
 evitable, Mirza stepped in with
 his proclamation of president's
 rule on the pretext that the
 government was incapable of
 passing the provincial budget
 before the 31 March deadline.
 The, united stand of these
 opposition parties as well as
 the Republican defections were
 made possible by a decision of
 the Moslem League to support
 the opposition demand for annul-
 ment of the single-unit adminis-
 trative setup_  in West Pakistan,
 an issue on which the league
 previously had been sharply
 split.
 The suspension of repre-
 sentative government in West
 Pakistan will probably in-
 crease popular support for the
 opposition parties'  demand for
 restoration of the six western
 provinces as they existed prior
 to 1955.  Leaders of the coali-
 tion,  however,  are optimistic

 about retaining their present
 strength through the period of
 the president's rule, which is
 constitutionally limited to
 six months.
 In East Pakistan,  the prof-
 fered resignation of Maulana
 Bhashani, pro-Communist presi-
 dent of the eastern branch of
 Suhrawardy's Awami League,  has
 given new impetus to plans
 aimed at realigning government
 support in order to cleanse it
 of pro-Communist and     ian-
 influenced elem
 Suhrawardy's position at
 the national level will remain
 insecure as long as the politi-
 cal problems in both provinces
 are unresolved.   To meet the
 chaLlenge to his authority, he
 will probably continue to co-
 operate with Mirza in working
 out a compromise coalition of
 non:Leftist forces which can
 bring stable government to
 West Pakistan and at the same
 tiie safeguard the national
 reg:Lme.  This probably can be
 accomplished only through an
 understanding with the Moslem
 League.   Consequently,  nego-
 tiations which reportedly took
 place during the past month
 are likely to be resumed in an
 effort to agree on conditions
 under which the Moslem League
 might return to the ruling
 coalition, dropping its support
 of the agitation against the
 single-unit system.
 In East Pakistan,  the
 prime minister's fortunes may
 hinge on agreement between his
 faction of the Awami League
 and other nonleftist parties
 which would result in an align-
 ment strong enough to counter-     25X1
 balance the defection of the
 Bhashani forces.
 NEW CYPRUS NEGOTIATIONS POSSIBLE
 New negotiations to resolve
 the Cyprus dispute may occur
 as a result of Britain's re-
 lease of Archbishop Makarios.
 The negotiations are likely
 to take place in London and
 to  be  based  on the Radcliffe
 constitutional proposals.   The
 British are willing to make
 minor modifications in these
 proposals in an effort to enlist
 Makarios' co-operation in get-
 ting self-government started.
 Makarios was reported will-
 ing to call for the cessation of
 terrorist activity on the island
 after he was released and if the
 British suspended military opera-
 tions against EOKA.   The British
 have announced their willingness

 ARGENTINA'S ECONOMIC CRISIS
 To avert the exhaustion
 of Argentina's hard currency
 reserves, President Aramburu
 announced on 22 March a series
 of sweeping economic ref orm
 proposals emphasizing austerity
 and discarding broad state
 economic controls in order to
 promote free enterprise.   Al-
 though politicians share the
 government economists' view
 that the crisis constitutes a
 "national emergency," party
 leaders have strongly protested
 against the politically unpop-
 ular proposals.   The proposals
 precipitated a cabinet crisis
 which has resulted in the re-
 placement of Treasury Minister
 Verrier,  author of the proposals.
 Verrier insisted that his
 proposals were essential to
 stave off "national bankruptcy"
 by the end of 1957, commenting
 that present gold and dollar
 reserves are even inadequate to
 cover this year's fuel bill.
 Gold and dollar holdings, he
 pointed out, fell to $237,000,-
 000 at the end of last year and
 since then have further declined.
 Imports from the United States
 alone reduced Argentina's gold
 holdings by some $100,000,000
 during 1956.   The 1956 dollar
 payments deficit of $250,000,-
 000 is expected. to be repeated
 this year, and the government's
 1957 budget deficit will amount
 to ;crate $777, 000, 000,
 Foreign exchange earnings
 have! been prejudiced by the
 adverse trend in prices for
 various agricultural products.
 The financial problem is ag-
 gravated by the increased need
 for dollars for essential items,
 particularly fuel, the Suez
 crisis having reduced oil sup-
 plies reimbursable in sterling
 and increased both oil prices
 and shipping costs by $40,000,-
 000 to $60,000,000.   Concomitant-
 ly increased petroleum consump-
 tion--a rise of 10 percent is
 estimated for 1957--is not
 snatched by domestic production,
 which.now supplies only about
 40 percent of Argentina's re-
 quirements.
 To remedy the situation,
 Verrier proposed a free enter-
 prise approach.   His many sweep-
 ing measures were designed to
 reduce consumption, increase
 exports, eliminate the balance
 of payments deficit, attract
 foreign investment and provide
 larger amounts of foreign ex-
 change to purchase the capital
 goods needed to. rehabilitate
 the Argentine economy after 10
 years of deterioration.   Specific
 proposals included ending state
 subsidies of services and com-
 modities, freeing prices, con-
 tinuing the wage freeze, free-
 ing imports of machinery and
 other capital goods, and reduc-
 ing the trade deficit in the

 this direction
 have already
 been taken,
 including ending on
 28 February
 of subsidies
 amount-
 ing to some
 $166,000,000
 yearly.
 Aramburu, although report-
 edly supported by the military
 ministers, is faced with strong
 objections from five other cab-
 inet ministers and many politi-
 cal                 leaders, who are mindful
 of the national elections this
 year.   These objections apparent-
 ly center on the proposals to
 abolish price controls while
 retaining the wage freeze, but
 there is also opposition among
 ultranationalist, elements to
 foreign investment in the fields
 of oil and electric power.   It
 was probably such elements who
 were behind the recent move of
 the Cordoba provincial govern-
 ment in seizing a small Ameri-
 can-owned electric light plant
 in defiance of present federal
 government policy.
 The newly appointed treas-
 ury minister, whose views are
 similar to those of his predeces-
 sor, may modify the proposals
 sufficiently to meet the objec-
 tions on price-wage relation-
 ships, but Aramburu seems in-
 tent on implementing as much of
 the total program as is political-
 ly possible.  He has already
 made the move of asking the
 political party leaders to go
 on record with their own specific
 suggestions for resolving the
 economic crisis, offering them
 access to government files for
 this purpose.
 LEFTIST LABOR UNIONS SCORE SUCCESS IN JAPAN
 The recent wave of strikes
 for higher wages involved 2,600,-
 000 workers and was conducted
 by the leftist Japan General
 Council of Labor Unions (Sohyo).
 It resulted in wage increases
 for the major unions and in the
 government's agreement to arbi-
 trate increases for public
 workers.
 The strikes began on 7
 March and. were: spearheaded by
 the 160,000-member Coal Miners'
 Federation among the private
 unions and by the 370,000-mem-
 ber Government Railway Workers
 and the 545,000-strong Japan
 Teachers' Union among public
 workers' unions.   They were
 joined by government communica-
 tions workers, private railway
 workers, and other miscellaneous
 unions.
 Wage increases won by the
 private unions averaged $3.60
 monthly, somewhat short of the
 $5.55 they sought, but still
 considerably higher than expected.
 Government workers probably
 will do almost as well when a
 settlement is reached by arbi-
 tratiLon early in April.
 The amount of the wage hike
 can be attributed in part to
 generally improved economic
 conditions, which permitted the
 unions to sustain their strikes
 longer and placed management in
 a better position to afford the
 increased labor costs.   The gov-
 ernment, however, may have to
 draft a supplementary budget to
 cover the anticipated increases
 for public workers.   The wide-
 spread rise in the wage level,
 accompanied by proposed tax re-
 ductions, can be expected to
 exert further inflationary pres-
 sure on the already rising trend
 of consumer prices.
 Sohyo's success this year
 contrasts with its reverses in
 1956 when two major wage of-
 fensives were regarded as fail-
 ures.                                                      The slow but steady in-

 GOMULKA'S EFFORTS TO TIGHTEN PARTY DISCIPLINE
 During.. fhe. past, :ten days,
 the Soviet and Satellite press,
 seizing on Gomulka's difficul-
 ties in re-establishing dis-
 cipline in the party and youth
 organizations, has resumed at-
 tacks on Polish deviations from
 orthodox Communist practice.
 This culminated in a blistering
 criticism of the lack of dis-
 cipline among Polish youth.
 The Soviet press has also con-
 tinued its "objective criticism"
 of various phases of Polish
 life, such as the lack of dis-
 cipline among liberal journal-
 ists and the conflict between
 adherents of collectivization
 and their opponents in the
 villages.
 Gomulka continues.,: to..
 face the dilemma of meeting
 internal and Soviet pressures
 without undermining his own
 announced program.   He is still
 installing his supporters in
 key posts--notably Witold Jaro-
 sinski,a central committee sec-.
 retary who has taken over the
 Warsaw city party organization--
 as well as two other central
 committee secretaries who have
 been moved to the provinces.
 No major internal reform has
 yet been  rescinded, despite
 Polish lip service to the So-
 viet line on such matters as
 national Communism and the
 counterrevolutionary sources of
 the Hungarian uprising, and
 general endorsement of Soviet
 foreign policy.
 Gomulka is also continuing
 his policy of co-operation with
 the Catholic. Church.
 In a step which may serious-
 ly aiatagonize working-class sup-
 port, however, Gomulka announced
 on 2:1 March that the government
 did not plan to honor its prom-
 Ise.: to make... up arrears of pay
 promised under earlier work
 agreements.   In the opinion of
 the American embassy in Warsaw,
 this abrupt move, which was not
 discussed with the workers, will
 be viewed by them as a breach of
 the regime's policy of "openness"
 in its relations with the popula-
 tion.
 Wage increases granted
 since Gomulka came to power,
 however, have been popularly at-
 tributed to his personal inter-
 vention.   These increases, as

 GROWING UNEMPLOYMENT IN SATELLITES
 Despite Communist claims
 of having abolished unemploy-
 ment,  it has become a serious
 problem in all the Satellites
 except East Germany and Czech-
 oslovakia.   Government measures
 to economize by reducing the
 size of the bureaucracy and
 eliminating "featherbedding"
 among industrial workers are
 increasing the number of un-
 employed.   Growing unemployment
 in Poland, Bulgaria,  and Rumania
 is adding to popular dissatis-
 faction and could result in
 localized demonstrations in
 those countries.
 The ramifications of the
 problem are particularly serious
 in Poland, where uneasiness
 about job tenure has become
 general, and where the regime is
 especially sensitive to internal
 disruptions.   Po Prostu,  a forth-
 right Polish journal,  revealed
 that in 1956 there may have been
 as many as 300,000 unemployed,
 about 4.5 percent of the non-
 agricultural labor force.   This
 number will probably double dur-
 ing 1957 as a result of further
 dismissals of state employees,
 new arrivals in the labor force,
 and repatriations from the USSR.
 Next to Poland, Bulgaria's
 stability is most seriously
 menaced.   Unemployment is re-
 ported to number about 380,000
 persons, or about 9 percent of
 the total labor force.   The un-
 employment problem is serious
 enough for the regime to under-
 take widespread "makework"
 remedies and to be considering
 the dispatch of possibly 15,000
 jobless to the USSR for work in
 the new lands.   A further com-
 plication is the plan to reduce
 the size of Bulgaria's bureauc-
 racy  by 50 percent before 1960.
 Unemployment in Hungary at

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Unemployment in Rumania,
 more serious now than at any-
 time since the war,                    is the re-
 sult largely of an economy
 drive in 1956 which resulted
 in large-scale dismissals from
 the administrative apparatus
 and state enterprises.  A fur-
 ther 40,000 persons are re-
 ported to be on the verge of
 losing their jobs as a result
 of the ministerial reorganiza-
 tion and staff cutbacks set for
 early 1957.  A decree was passed
 in early March attempting to
 reduce unemployment by cancel-
 ing work contracts with persons
 having more than one source of
 income and limiting to one the
 number of employed persons in
 a family, but the outcry which
 greeted the decree caused its
 hasty recision.
 East Germany is currently
 suffering a labor shortage,
 largely because of the steady
 exodus to West Germany.   Highly
 industrialized Czechoslovakia
 is experiencing a continuing
 labor shortage, particularly
 in mining, agriculture, con-
 struction and transportation.
 The shortage results in part
 from the expulsion of the
 Sudeten Germans after the war
 and partly from the high level
 of foreign trade.
 The Satellites have tried
 a variety of measures to combat
 unemployment.   Poland has set
 up "intervention funds" of
 300,000,000 zlotys ($75,000,000)
 and put them at the disposal of
 local councils to expand local
 industry and crafts.  Local and
 co-operative
 industries in
 1957
 are to absorb
 workers.
 about 50,000
 Bulgaria is trying to ex-
 pand industrial production as
 well as to export those with-
 out jobs.  The Hungarian problem
 probably cannot be met until
 production is restored to pre-
 revolt levels.   Some feeble
 measures have been taken by ex-
 tending loans to establish
 private business, reducing the
 pension age, and allowing exit
 permits for selected categories
 of persons.  Rumania seems to
 have done little about its un-
 employment except to contemplate
 sending jobless workers to. the
 USSR, and to make exit permits
 available to some categories
 of persons.
 A considerable force of un-
 employed will probably exist
 for some time in most of the
 Satellites, especially, since
 the period of radical industrial
 expansion has ended.   Recognizing
 this, a Polish economist re-
 cently commented that "we must
 rid ourselves of the belief
 that unemployment cannot be a
 problem in a socialist society."

 The recently concluded an-
 nual meeting of the national
 committee of the Chinese
 People's Political Consultative
 Conference, an "advisory" group
 with representatives from the
 Chinese Communist and puppet
 parties, was marked by forth-
 right criticism of certain re-
 gime programs.  While the
 leaders of the regime received
 the usual adulation, lower-
 ranking cadres came in for
 sharp attack.   Peiping apparent-
 ly wished to encourage out-
 spokenness in order to demon-
 strate that it is honoring the
 promises held out last year for
 democratization.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The conference, which was
 originally constituted with
 some of the trappings of a
 legislative assembly, was rel-
 egated  to an advisory role in
 the government structure after
 the National People's Congress
 was established in 1954.   How-
 ever,  its sessions have con-
 tinued to provide an important
 platform from which to promote
 major Chinese Communist'. programs.
 Conference delegates were
 evidently emboldened by a major
 address by Mao Tse-tung shortly
 before the session on "contra-
 dictions within the ranks of  .
 the people."  The text of Mao's
 speech has not been released,
 but subsequent speeches sug-
 gested that he dwelt on the
 distinction that must be made
 between "contradictions" among
 people united under socialism
 and those between the people
 and the enemy.   Mao apparently
 professed that the privilege
 of freer discussion could
 safely be extended to those
 who supported the regime.   He
 seems to have repeated his
 call of last year to "let all
 flowers bloom together, let
 all schools of thought contend."
 At the closing session,
 Chou En-lai observed approv-
 ingly that 44 percent of the
 conference delegates had
 spoken out on matters of con-
 cern to them, twice the propor-
 tion of last year's meeting.
 Among the criticisms
 voiced by delegates were those
 of defective planning in eco-
 nomic development programs.   A
 leading economist attacked fre-
 quent revisions of plans and
 called for closer ties between
 planners and those who execute
 the plans.   Scientists com-
 plained of a poor division of
 labor among researchers and a
 failure to use the short
 supply of scientists in posi-
 tions commensurate with their
 abilities.
 A Christian leader criti-
 cized anti-Christian bias in
 government organizations and
 local interference with reli-
 gious freedom.  A puppet party
 member asserted that the "major
 fault" behind difficulties in
 relations between Communists
 and non-Communists lies in the
 "attitude of some of the Com-
 munists."
 Some criticism was leveled
 at specific government policies.
 An architect argued that the
 ratio of investment between
 heavy and light industry should
 be lowered to six to one,  in
 contrast to the ratio of from
 seven to eight to one in the
 first four years of the present
 Five-Year Plan,  in order to
 permit the allocation of more
 funds for the production of
 consumer goods.
 Lifting of restrictions
 on abortions and sterilization,
 suggested as a birth control
 measure by the minister of
 health, was also sharply
 criticized.
 This freedom of expression
 indicates that Peiping; intends
 to continue its liberalization
 program as first announced a
 year ago.   Following the East
 European disorders last fall,
 the Communists in Peiping, like
 those elsewhere in the bloc,
 were impressed by the need for
 caution in carrying out liberal-
 izatJLon premises.   Peiping now
 apparently is convinced. it can
 keep its liberalization program
 under control.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Hong Kong's poverty-
 stricken and embittered Chinese
 refugees      pose a serious thres.t
 to the colony's security.  While
 many harbor resentment against:
 the Peiping regime, which they
 blame for their present hard-
 ships, their extreme dissatis-
 faction nevertheless could be
 exploited by the Chinese Com-
 munists.   The danger resulting
 from their accumulated discon-
 tent was demonstrated by the
 Kowloon riots of October 1956.
 Since January 1949, it is
 estimated that almost 1,000,000
 Chinese refugees have sought
 asylum in the colony,
 OLD REFUGEE HOUSING IN KOWLOON
 The bulk of Hong Kong's
 2,500,000 population is concen-
 trated in the 6.5--square-mile
 Kowloon-Victoria area, where
 population density reaches
 2,000 persons per acre, or 14
 times as high as Manhattan.
 Recent Hong Kong government
 surveys reveal that 225,000
 Hong Kong children suffer from
 malnutrition,  and that there
 are an estimated 50,000 active
 contagious tubercular cases in
 the colony.  School facilities
 are available for little more
 than 50 percent of the school-
 age children.
 Some 600,000 persons are
 in need of better housing; of
 these, 300,000 have no homes
 at all. Approximately 200,000
 persons are surplus to Hong
 Kong's estimated future man-
 power requirements.
 To ameliorate housing con-
 ditions, the government in 1954
 initiated a "vigorous" resettle-
 ment, campaign to house Hong
 Kong's homeless.  To date the
 program has successfully housed
 200,000 persons.  Governor
 Grantham, when outlining pro-
 spective ameliorative measures
 to be taken over the next five
 years, however, noted that both
 colonial government and private
 welfare agency resources were
 inadequate for the task remain-
 ing, and called for United
 Nations assistance.
 Government concern over
 the refugee problem was in-
 tensified by the three-day
 October riots, during which
 there was an estimated $780,000
 worth of property damage, and
 59 lives were lost.  The ease
 with which criminal elements
 exploited the riots for purposes
 of looting, together with the
 inability of the police to
 control. the rioters--mostly
 refugees--in the labyrinths
 of narrow streets, demonstrated
 the potentially explosive nature
 of the colony's refugee problem.
 The vast majority of Hong
 Kong's Chinese are reported

 fields.  Also active in the
 colony are pro-Nationalist and

 Friction between these groups
 poses a constant threat of

 USSR URGES "SOCIALIST COMPETITION`TO RAISE,PRODUCTION
 In recent weeks the Soviet
 press has begun a campaign rem-
 iniscent of the Stalin era.,to
 induce the workers to increase
 production through "socialist
 competition."  The campaign
 has been accompanied by offi-
 cial reassertions of confidence
 that the output goals of the
 Sixth Five-Year Plan would be
 fulfilled.
 The campaign, part of the
 build-up of this fall's cele-
 bration of the 40th anniversary
 of the revolution, has succeeded
 in persuading millions of work-
 ers to join competitions for
 increased output, according to
 Soviet reports.  The worker is
 urged to display initiative in
 the introduction of new tech-
 nology, to muster "internal re-
 serves," to organize production
 more efficiently and to reduce
 waste,
 Soviet metallurgical work-
 ers have responded by pledging
 to smelt hundreds of thousands
 of tons of metal over the 1957
 plan.  Donbas coal miners, have
 also pledged overfulfillment
 of the 1957 plan and in addi-
 tion have urged the support of
 all miners in the struggle for
 implementation of the decisions
 of the 20th party congress.
 A Pravda editorial of 6 March
 contaied an_ appeal from the
 agricultural workers of
 Smolensk Oblast to all agri-
 cultural workers to develop a
 competition for overfulfillment
 of the tasks of the Sixth Five-
 Year Plan and stressed the
 fact that such overfulfillment
 depends on the worker, since
 the collectives and state farms
 "have everything necessary" for
 fulfilling the tasks set by
 the 20th party congress.
 Such statements, along with
 various official pronouncements,
 including a Pravda editorial
 which assumed pre-term fulfill-
 ment of the Sixth Five-Year
 Plan, contrast with Pervukhin's
 announcement on 5 February of
 the downward revision of the
 1957 plan.  The reduction in
 1957 goals does indeed increase
 the probability of overfulfill-
 ment of this year's plan but at
 the .same time makes considerably
 more difficult,  if not impos-
 sible in some cases, fulfill-
 ment of original 1960 goals.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 THE NEW PHILIPPINE ADMINISTRATION
 The new president of the
 Philippines, Carlos P. Garcia,
 i's, a lifelong  public servant
 and stalwart of the ruling Na-
 cionAlistaParty,.  Because he has
 been identified with the "old
 guard" faction of the party,
 which has been inclined toward
 narrow nationalism, there is
 concern in Manila that the late
 president Magsaysay's programs
 and policies might be gradually
 shunted aside.
 Garcia's Aspirations
 The 60-year-old
 Garcia is a lawyer
 and landowner as well
 as a literary figure
 in the Philippines.
 His long record in
 public office in"
 cludes the governor-
 ship of his native
 Visayan Province,
 and membership in the
 Philippine Congress,
 both before and after
 independence in 1946.
 His record, plus the
 pressure of the old-
 line Nacionalista
 policies remain to be tested.
 Within six weeks after Magsay-
 say's inauguration on 31 Decem-
 ber 1953, Garcia, who was then
 also secretary of foreign af-
 fairs, joined the ultranational-
 ist Senator Recto in advocating
 an "Asia-for-Asians" foreign
 policy.   Shortly thereafter,
 the reparations settlement he
 agreed to with Japanese nego"
 tiators was rejected by Magsay-
 ' say
 Garcia tended to dis-
 regard security, and
 delicate matters were
 frequently leaked to
 the press.   In addi-
 tion, his appoint-
 ments were criticized
 for failing to improve
 the caliber of the
 Philippine foreign
 service.   As a result,
 Garcia never won the
 confidence of Magsa -
 say
 conservatives, led to his nom-
 ination as Magsaysay's running
 mate in the 1953 elections.
 One of Garcia's first acts
 after succeeding to the presi-
 dency on 18 March was to promise
 to carry out fully the domestic
 reforms and pro-American foreign
 policy established by Magsaysay
 and to maintain the present
 cabinet in office.  He declared
 that the Philippines would con-
 tinue to co-operate with the
 United States and would oppose
 admission of Communist China
 to the UN; he rejected any
 notion that trade relations can
 be developed with the Communist
 bloc.
 Garcia's willingness and
 ability to carry on Magsaysay's
 However much Garcia may
 desire to follow the lead of
 his predecessor, there are in-
 dications that he intends to
 make the compromises required
 to win the presidential elec-
 tion in November.   There are
 already rumors that he is making
 a deal with Senator Recto and
 that, to head off the candidacy
 of the powerful Senator Laurel,
 he will accept the latter's
 son, House Speaker Josd, Jr.,
 as his running mate.   In addi-
 tion,, Garcia's statement that
 economic development plans
 would continue to be studied
 raises the possibility that,
 in return for the support of
 the powerful sugar bloc, he may
 adopt ther special-interest
 economic policies, which Magsay-
 say had opposed.

 Administration Changes
 Although Garcia has said
 he intends to retain the Mag-
 saysay cabinet, changes are.re-
 portedly being discussed.   The
 post of secretary of education
 is open, as the previous sec-
 retary was also a victim of the
 plane..::crash that killed Magsay-
 say.
 Garcia has already made one
 important appointment in des-
 ignating  Raul Manglapus as
 acting foreign affairs secreta.ry-.
 Although the president intends
 to retain the foreign affairs
 portfolio himself, he has for
 all practical purposes put the
 department in the hands of a
 young but extremely capable
 appointee. of Magsaysay.  Mangla-
 pus had been heavily relied on
 to counteract the extreme na-
 tionalist pressures and anti-
 American attacks of Magsaysay's
 opponents.  Although he is a
 member of the..Citizens' Party,
 headed by Recto's campaign
 manager Senator Tanada, Mangla-

 Magsaysay.

 Soviet press of Russian Jews
 with alleged American intelli-

 anti-Semitism even though they

 them with Zionist and imperial-
 ist subversion.  This develop-
 ment appears to be primarily a
 by-product of the present cam-
 paign against internal unrest
 and Western influences, rather
 than a campaign against Jews
 as such.
 Policy in Relation to Jews
 Since 1917 the Soviet re-
 gime has officially sought to
 achieve a multinational federa-
 tion of brotherly peoples which
 together constitute a unified
 "Soviet culture."  With. regard
 to the Russian Jewish community,
 however, there has been a di'.
 chotomy in policy and propagan-
 da,            Policy has alternated be-
 tween ignoring the Jews as a
 homogeneous group and isolating
 them as politically unreliable
 and contagious in their disaf-
 fection.  Measures have been
 taken to fragment and starve
 out Jewish culture:   virtually
 all Jewish theaters and news-
 papers were closed down in 1948;
 there was no rabbinical seminary
 from the early days of the So-
 viet regime until this year;
 the opening of synagogues and
 maintenance of existing ones
 are discouraged; and communi-
 cation between Jewish commu:---
 Aities has been virtua.l.iy : elimi-
 nated.
 Since 1952 there have been
 persistent reports that a quota
 has been imposed on the number
 of Jews permitted in intellec-
 tual activities.  According to
 these reports, the number of
 Jews in "sensitive" professions,
 i.e., scientific research and
 development, communications,
 transport.and defense, is being
 cut down.   Recent rumors stress
 the dismissal of many Jews oc-
 cupying high administrative
 positions in the government
 bureaucracy, as well as engi-
 neers, scientists and techni-'_,
 cians employed in strategic
 defense and research facilities.

 several of the top Russian
 ave expresse
 strongly anti-Semitic sentiments
 and, told anti-Semitic jokes.
 In May 1956, Khrushchev
 bluntly asserted to a French
 Socialist delegation that re-
 strictions on Jews entering
 higher educational institutions
 and holding white-collar jobs
 were justified by the re-creation
 of a large Russian intelligentsia
 to replace that decimated by the
 revolution and civil war.  The
 obvious implication was that
 Jewish intellectuals were used
 after 1918 as a :stopgap measure
 and can now be discarded.
 Kaganovich, himself a Jew, has
 insisted that the Jewish minor-
 ity is being absorbed culturally
 and no longer displays any
 interest in Jewish theaters,
 schools or press.
 Although Soviet propaganda
 has not abandoned the line that
 the Jews are being assimilated,
 it periodically exposes them as
 a weak link in Soviet society
 which must be isolated for
 security reasons.  The ill-fated
 scheme to develop Birobidzhan
 as a Jewish national homeland
 in the Far East is a case in
 point.  After "voluntary settle-
 ment" proved a failure, the
 Jewish emigration to Birobidzhan
 came to consist almost entirely
 of prisoners.  As recently as
 November 1956 there was a ru-
 mored mass deportation to
 Birobidzhan of Jews and some
 Poles from the western border
 regions of the USSR.  These
 deportations, if they occurred,
 were probably related to the
 crisis in Soviet-Polish rela-
 tions.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 March 1957
 Influence of Israel
 Russian rulers, both
 Tsarist and Soviet, have often
 used the smoldering .prejudices
 of Great Russians, Ukrainians,
 Belorussians and other national-
 ities against the Jews in order
 to divert popular discontent
 from embarrassing matters.  'The
 rise of Israel as a viable in-
 dependent Jewish state has given
 the problem of the Jewish minor-
 ity in the USSR new dimensions.
 Since September 1948 when Ilya
 Ehrenburg flayed the new state
 as the creature of bourgeois,
 nationalistic Zionist mystics,
 the official rationale for anti-
 Semitic policies has been the
 need for protection against an
 unassimilated, influential and
 politically unreliable portion
 of a minority group with power-
 ful international connections.
 The nine villains of the
 "doctors' plot" in 1953, five
 of whom were Jewish, were ac-
 cused of having "sold them-
 selves for dollars to American
 intelligence" through the Am-
 erican-Jewish Joint Distribu-
 tion Committee, described as a
 "Zionist espionage organizaT.'
 tion."  There is ample evidence
 that the Russian people drew an
 anti-Semitic inference from
 this and that this was the re-
 gime'.s intent.  The coincidence
 of a vigilance campaign with
 the doctors' plot indicated
 that the attack on the Jews was
 only part of a larger target,
 namely, the general tightening
 of security and discipline.
 The parallel to 1953 is
 obvious in the present con-
 currence of spy-scare vigilance
 propaganda with reports of
 rising anti-Semitism character-
 ized by dismissals of Jews on
 a professional and security
 basis.
 In 1957, however, the
 threat of intellectual unrest
 to internal security must be
 added to the alleged Zionist
 threat to bloc security.  A
 significant number of Jews in
 the, Soviet Union are engaged
 primarily in intellectual
 activity despite.  the numerous
 measures in the past designed
 to disperse them to rural areas
 and to farm or factory labor.
 Thus, unrest among the intelli-
 gentsia and Zionist subversion
 of the Jewish minority are
 closely linked in official
 thinking.
 The Moldavian Republic
 newspaper Sovetskaya Moldavid
 on 2 March reporte  the arrest
 of three spies, belonging to a
 Jewish sect, who had been en-
 gaging in "undermining activ
 ities" in Moldavia under orders
 from an "American center."  The
 newspaper called for the "un-
 mas:king" of the sect because it
 was "interested not=-only in
 the Bible but in anti-Soviet
 affairs in liaison with American
 imperialists."  Cited as evi-
 dente were typewritten letters
 in the Russian, Ukrainian and
 Rumanian languages, illegal
 literature of American origin
 and a report on the sect's
 activities from 1952 to 1956,
 purportedly found at its
 "regional office."
 Any anti-Semitic movement
 in the Soviet Union, whether
 officially inspired or not,
 runs the risk of getting out
 of hand, and it is unlikely,
 therefore, that the present
 leadership will resort to ac-
 tions, resembling the doctors'
 plot.  Quiet removal of Jews
 from positions in which they
 might have contact with for-
 eigners or--from the point of
 view of an oversensitive re-
 gime--an opportunity to sabo-
 tage science and defense, will
 probably continue, however,
 along with arrests of Jews as
 Zionist spies, paralleling
 arrestsc of Great Russians and
 other nationals as imperialist
 agents.

 PAKISTAN'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS
 The Pakistani government
 has recently instituted its
 first Five-Year Plan in an ef-
 fort to overcome the country's
 basic economic problem--lagging
 agricultural production.   The
 plan, if pushed vigorously by
 the government, should lead to
 economic progress sufficient to
 raise per capita income slight-
 ly.   Pakistan would still, how-
 ever, be heavily dependent on
 foreign aid when the plan ended.
 When the Indian subconti-
 nent was partitioned in 1947,
 almost all of its industry and
 about 90 percent of the trained
 administrators and technicians
 fell to India.   The areas that
 became Pakistan were predominant-
 ly agricultural, with rice pro-
 duction in East Pakistan and
 wheat in West Pakistan just suf-
 ficient to feed the people and
 permit very small exports.   The
 economy was heavily dependent
 on raw jute and cotton exports
 .for its foreign exchange earn-
 ings.
 Industrial Production
 Despite their lack of ex-
 perience, the Pakistanis have
 made striking industrial prog-
 ress;.; since partition.   Indus-
 trial production began to ex-
 pand rapidly after 1950, when
 large jute and cotton earnings
 made possible the importation
 of considerable amounts of in-
 dustrial equipment.   Pakistan
 had no jute mill in 1950; today,
 it has 12 and exports jute
 manufactures as well as raw
 jute.   The cotton textile in-
 dustry operated 178,000 spindles
 at the time of partition; to-
 day, it operates over 1,000,000
 spindles and exports cotton
 textiles.
 Production of steel ingots,
 cement, paper, electric power,
 tires and many types of con-
 sumer goods has risen rapidly
 since 1948, and output would
 have been even higher if there
 Industrial production
 should continue to rise rapidly
 in the future.   Large-scale hy-
 droelectric resources are avail-
 able--chiefly in West Pakistan.
 A major natural gas field has
 been put into operation to sup-
 ply fuel for industry in West
 Pakistan, and recent drillings
 have indicated that another siz-
 able gas field may exist in
 East Pakistan.   Four foreign
 oil companies, confident that
 large fields will be found, are
 already drilling for oil.
 Food 'Grain Production
 Pakistan's food production,
 however, has failed to keep up
 with its population growth of
 nearly 1,000,000 a year.   The
 country needs to increase its
 food grain output by about 150,-
 000 tons a year just to ensure
 its people their present diet

 The grain harvest, large
 enough in the first years after

 ports, fell sharply from 1950
 to 1953, chiefly because of
 drought in West Pakistan and
 the shift of some land to jute
 and cotton production during
 the Korean war.   Most officials
 considered the problem temporary,
 however.

 Since 1954, Pakistani
 leaders have gradually come to
 recognize that their food prob-
 lem is a chronic one.   They ex-
 pect to import 1,257,000 tons
 of grain valued at $129,150,000
 in the year ending in June 1957.
 While the foreign exchange cost
 of this grain will be only $49,-
 350,000 since most of the grain
 is supplied for rupees by the
 United States, even this is a
 major drain on Pakistan's for-
 eign exchange holdings and a
 major burden on its already
 overloaded transportation sys-
 tem.
 In addition,  since the
 imported grain is more expen-
 sive than locally grown grain,
 the government has subsidized
 it in an"attempt to hoa.d prices
 down.   This subsidy cost the
 government over $40,000,000
 last year, a major portion of
 the budget deficit.   While ag-
 ricultural production for the
 year ending in June 1957 should
 be significantly better than in
 th-e, past two years, it will not
 be high enough to eliminate the
 need for sizable imports.
 The major. reason agricul-
 ture has failed to stay ahead
 of population growth has been
 the lack of any comprehensive
 agricultural development plan.
 Since little has been done in
 the -way of land reform, the
 peasant has little incentive
 to expand production.   The
 amount of land added to culti-
 vation by various irrigation
 schemes appears to be less than
 the amount that has gone out
 of production because of water-_
 logging and salinity.   The ag-
 ricultural extension service
 has not been developed to the
 point where modern techniques
 of farming can be taught to the.
 individual farmers, with the
 result that yields are extremely
 low.
 Foreign Trade
 While the degree of depend-
 ence on raw jute and cotton ex-
 ports is falling as Pakistan's
 exports become more diversified,
 the country continues to derive
 near:Ly three fourths of its. for-
 eign exchange earnings from
 these two products whose price

 1951 because of the Korean war
 boom, but by 1954 they had
 fallen to $270,217,000, forcing
 Pakistan to cut imports of con-
 sumer goods severely.
 Following the devaluation
 of the Pakistani rupee from
 30.5 cents to .21 cents on 31
 July 1955, export earnings rose
 moderately.  By continued re-
 striction of imports,
 the government built
 up its foreign ex-
 change reserves from
 the dangerously low
 figure of $210,147,-
 000 in October 1955
 to $292,866,000 at
 plan until May 1956.   As amended
 by the National Economic Coun-
 cil after considerable contro-
 versy over the respective shares
 of East and West Pakistan, the
 plan now calls for expenditure
 of $2,268 billion, of which
 the government was to spend
 $1.575 billion and private
 investors $693,000,000.

 mean  a per capita increase of
 about 7 percent in view of the
 expected population increase.
 The plan calls for a 13-percent
 increase in food grain produc-
 tion and a 71-percent increase
 in industrial production by
 1960 as compared to 1954, the
 last full year before the plan.
 The planners estimate that
 total public and private sav-
 ings during the period of the
 plan will amount to about `;6
 percent of the country's gross
 national product, or $1.386
 billion,of which $210,000,000
 would be public savings and
 $1.176 billion private savings.
 This would leave a gap of $882y-
 000, 000 to be filled by foreign
 assistance, of which $84,000,000
 is to come from private foreign
 investment, and the remaining
 $798,000,000 from foreign loans
 and grants.
 Outlook for the Plan
 Despite the delay in approv-
 ing the plan, funds have already
 been appropiated for some of its
 projects.   The government has al-
 located $186,690,000 for economic
 development in the 1955-56 budg
 et, $234,696,000 in the 1956-57
 budget, and $337,491,000 in the
 budget for the fiscal year begin-
 ing on 1 April 1957.  While there
 probably will be a lag in the
 actual expenditure of these
 funds., the increased allocations
 show the rising tempo of econom-
 ic development. Industrial pro-
 duction, scheduled to increase
 by '71 percent, was 40 percent
 above the pre-plan level in 1956
 and is likely to be above plan
 goals in 1960.   Agricultural de-
 velopment has been neglected to
 date, however, and this neglect
 indicates that it will take six
 or seven years to reach theagri-
 oultural:production target.
 The Chinese Communists
 have moved with great energy to
 improve the 14,000 miles of
 badly deteriorated railroad
 they took over from the Chinese
 Nationalists in 1949 and have
 extended the rail system into
 parts of the country never be-
 fore served by modern means of
 transportation.

 ished in mid-1955.                      It serves
 an important strategic airfield
 at Suichi and the port of Chan-
 chiang, which is being developed
 as an alternate to Canton and
 Hong Kong.   The second, the
 Yingtan-Amoy, was completed in
 December 1956 and will be of-
 ficially opened to traffic
 shortly.   This line, together,
 with a branch to Foochow which
 may be operating within the
 next several months, greatly
 increases the Chinese Communist
 logistic capabilities in the
 Taiwan Strait area, and will
 aid in the exploitation of
 Fukien's economic resources.
 Construction
 was begun on other
 important projects,
 the most noteworthy
 from a strategic and
 economic point of
 view being the Trans-
 Sinkiang line.   This
 will extend from
 Lanchow through the
 Kansu corridor, a-.
 cross Sinkiang Prov-
 ince  to the USSR
 border and on to
 Aktogay, where it
 will connect with'

 of rich oil deposits  found
 there.
 Construction of a double-
 deck, rail-highway bridge over
 the Yangtze River at Wuhan is
 the largest bridge project ever
 undertaken in China.   Scheduled
 for completion late this year,
 the bridge will remove the chief
 bottleneck to rail movement
 between Peiping and Canton.
 With over 1,000 miles of
 new line completed in 1956,
 Peiping is planning to add only
 375 miles during 1957.   This
 includes 200 miles on the Paotow-

 the Soviet Turk-Sib line.   By
 mid-1956 the line had given
 China its first rail access to
 Yumen, the nation's largest
 producing area of natural crude
 oil (more'.than 500,000':tons.in
 1956).   By the end of the year
 it was nearly half finished,
 having reached almost to the
 Sinkiang border.   Some track
 was
 put down
 on the Soviet
 side.
 The 1957
 program calls
 for
 the
 laying of only 22 miles
 of
 track, which amounts to a vir-
 tual abandonment of the project
 for the year.   Since work teams
 probably are already active
 within Sinkiang, however, it is
 likely that this target will be
 overfulfilled.   The entire line
 could be completed in late 1958
 or early 1959.   It will have a
 tremendous impact on the open-.
 ing of China's far west, par-
 Lanchow line and completion of
 the Pisechai-Hokou; and the
 Wuhan-Tayeh lines as well as
 a number of minor service and
 forestry railroads.
 Pre-1949 Lines
 The notable achievements
 of the Chinese Communists in

 ambitious plans for the future
 should not obscure the fact
 that the pre-1949 lines are
 being pressed hard to meet the
 sharply increased traffic  de-

 half of 1956, is still local.
 Hardest hit were the lines
 leading north and west of the
 important junction of Chengchow.
 While this condition is ex-
 pected to continue and perhaps
 worsen, the Chinese have recog-
 nized the problem and are tak-
 ing s:tep8  to remedy it.
 The First Five-Year Plan
 goal for double-tracking was
 increased during 1956 and, by
 the end of the year,  500 miles
 of line had been double-tracked.
 Work was undertaken during the
 year on nearly 160 miles of
 double-track leading out of
 Chengchow.
 In 1957, three fifths of
 the scheduled investment of
 the Ministry of Railways is to
 be spent on improving the
 freight-carrying capacity of
 the older lines.   The year's
 program includes reconstruc-
 tion of some lines, 375 miles
 of double-tracking, expansion
 of yard facilities, installa-
 tion of automatic signaling
 devices, and procurement of ad-
 ditional engines and freight
 cars.   During the Second--Five-
 Year? Plan, a thorough rehabilita-
 tion of existing lines will be
 undertaken, highlighted by the
 double-tracking of the entire
 length of the Peiping-Wuhan
 railroad.

 5,600 miles of new
 track during the Sec-
 ond Five-Year Plan
 (1958-1967).   Among
 the projects to be
 finished by 1962 are
 lines between Chengtu
 and Kunming, Hunan
 and Kweichow, Lanchow
 and Paotow, Neichiang
 and Kunming, Lanchow
 and the Tsaidam Basin,
 as well as two branch
 lines designed to
 serve potential oil
 fields and other
 economic installations
 in Sinkiang.   Work
 will also be under-
 taken on a connection
 between Wuhan and Wuwei
 via Sian, and perhaps
 on one leading south-
 ward from the Tsaidam
 Basin to Lhasa, Tibet.

 The over-all
 quality of construc-

 will probably continue
 to be, good.   Defects

 Such difficulties and delays
 as have taken place can general-

 the tremendous strides taken
 by the Chinese in rail construc-

 Figures released by the
 Chinese Communists show that
 China in 1956 was producing,
 about 65 percent of the net ad-
 ditions to its motive power and
 rolling stock inventory.  Out-
 put has consistently run behind
 goals, however, and China will
 probably have to continue to
 rely on other countries to sup-
 ply some of its needs.  Since
 1953, production of rolling
 stock has been shifted to the
 building of tank cars and 50-ton
 freight cars.  In 1956, China
