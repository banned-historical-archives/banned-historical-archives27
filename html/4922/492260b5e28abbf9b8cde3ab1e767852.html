 Press Conference:                       STATION  C-SPAN
 Ambassador Zdzislaw Rurarz
 DATE        December 28,  1982     9:00 P.M.       CITY      Washington, DC
 SUBJECT     Full Text
 HOSTESS:   Dr.  Zdzislaw Rurarz,     former Polish Ambassador
 to Japan.
 A week and a half ago you were sentenced to death by a
 military court in Poland on the charge of high treason.   What
 does that mean?
 ZDZISLAW RURARZ:   Well,  the military tribunal  in Warsaw,
 on December 17 of this year,     has sentenced me to death in
 absentia for the high treason.   And believe me that just upon my
 defection,  probably the next hour,     I was already sentenced to
 death.   But only now it was announced.   And this means that they
 will be -- of course,  not only the Poles,  those from the
 equivalent of the KGB under the military intelligence service,
 but of the Soviet special services and all the Eastern countries,
 including Cuba and so on -- they will be trying to carry out the
 verdict.     There is no doubt about that.
 HOSTESS:   Are you concerned for your safety here in the
 United States?
 RURARZ:   Well,  I have decided to fight for  free Poland
 and I consider myself as a soldier of free Poland.         And,  well,
 the soldiers should be prepared for anything.
 HOSTESS:   Okay.
 We're here tonight with Dr.  Zdzislaw Rurarz,  the former
 Polish official who defected to the United States and who's been
 sentenced to die by a Polish court.
 To talk to him,  you might start dialing right now....

 Zdzi.slaw Rurarz served as a Polish Ambassador to Japan
 from February to December in 1981,  and was to become Ambassador
 to the Philippines,  but then was granted political asylum in the
 U.S.   Prior to his post in the Polish government,  the Ambassador
 was an economics professor at the Central School of Planning and
 Statistics in Warsaw.   Between 1976 and  '81,  Ambassador Rurarz
 was an economics adviser to the Minister of Foreign Affairs in
 Poland.     Also,  he has served as economic adviser to Edward
 Gierek, the Communist Party chief,  and has served also in many
 other advisory capacities in the Polish government.   Overall,
 he's been an official of the Polish government since 1953.
 Isn't that  right?
 RURARZ:   Yes.   That's true.
 HOSTESS:   Thank you  for joining us tonight.
 Mr.  Ambassador,  the Polish government has met in its
 last session today under martial law.   Martial law will be lifted
 on New Year's Eve.      Is the government taking this step for the
 benefit of the Polish people or  for some other reason?
 RURARZ:   Well,  for some other reasons,  because the
 government is facing definite economic and social and political
 difficulties,  and especially the government wants to reopen the
 negotiations with the Western governments and Western commercial
 banks,  not only rescheduling of debt,  which partly is still not
 rescheduled, but on new fresh credits.    And they want to create
 the impression that the situation is returning to normal.
 But I  don't believe in any lifting of the martial law.
 This will be the martial law,  only different by name.
 HOSTESS:   ...Let's go out to Glendale,  California....
 MAN:   Mr. Ambassador,  I  would like to congratulate you
 on the courage it must have taken in your defection,  and welcome
 you most warmly to our country.
 And I have three short questions,  one of which I think
 has almost been answered.   I was wondering    if the United States
 has offered you protection from our security services.
 And then secondly,  I'm curious to know how much the
 average Polish citizen knows about what's going on in the world
 in general.   Like how much censorship and lack of communication
 is there in Poland?   Does the average Polish citizen know the
 support that he has in the United States?
 And thirdly,  if you can briefly,  can you personally tell

 Approved For Release 2007/03/14: CIA-RDP88-0107OR000100550002-3
 me of any plan which you may be a party to or can suggest that
 may eventually get your country out  from under the Russian yoke?
 RURARZ:   I  thank you very much  for your kind words.
 Answering  the  first  question, I  think  I  am provided with
 sufficient security by the U.S.  authorities.   I enjoy their
 understanding and support.
 And secondly,   when it comes to how the Polish opinion is
 informed about what is happening in the West,   what the West
 thinks about Poland,      I  think that,  through the Voice of America,
 through Radio Free Europe,  Radio France,  Vatican,  BBC, Deutsche
 [unintelligible],  the Polish public opinion is well-informed
 about what  is hapening here in the West,  what the West is doing
 when it comes to Poland.   And so the people know.
 When  it comes to the official propaganda and official
 mass media,  these are lies,  lies,  and only lies.
 Thirdly, what I will be doing,  if I understood
 correctly.   Well, I will be trying to teach the economics of the
 Communist countries and to participate in some research.   But
 taking my special status here,  I have to remember about the
 sentence which is hanging on me.
 HOSTESS:   ...Out to Taylor,  Michigan.
 MAN:   Could you -- I don't know if you have any
 information about it or not.   But they made an attempt on the
 Pope's life.   Is there a possibility that  another attempt could
 be made on his life?
 RURARZ:   I  am not excluding that.   However,  I think that
 right now it will be much, much more difficult,  because I  think
 that the world opinion was that much alerted,  that it would be
 difficult to proceed with another attempt   immediately upon the
 first  failure.      But I would not exclude that. As long as the
 Pope will be doing what he's doing,  will be that much attached to
 Poland as he is -- and certainly he will be -- he will always the
 threat to the Soviet domination in Poland.
 HOSTESS:   As you mentioned during the press conference,
 the Italian government has recently unearthed some evidence that
 indicates the Bulgarians might be involved.   Do you believe
 that's possible?
 RURARZ:   Certainly.   I  know something about the special
 services of the Eastern countries.   It is out of the question
 that a Turk that much known for his assassination,  who escaped
 from the prison -- nobody really knows who was helping him to

 Approved For Release 2007/03/14: CIA-RDP88-0107OR000100550002-3
 escape from the prison -- that he came to Bulgarian and then he
 left Bulgaria with money,  that he was living quite freely,
 changing the hotels,  and so on and so -- so that this is out of
 the question that the Bulgarians would be unaware of whom he was,
 and that,  besides,      they would be not trying to use him for this
 attempt which he did.
 I  am not,  of course,  sure whether he was not recruited
 before by the special services of the Eastern countries,  because
 this is not known to me.   I think that I would be not excluding
 even that.   Because why he  immediately escaped to Bulgaria?   This
 is something which is raising my eyebrows.
 HOSTESS:    San Diego,  California.
 MAN:   Mr.  Ambassador,  I'm wondering,  in the 50 visits
 that you had to the Soviet Union,   were you able to get a sense of
 the people,  the working people,       as Solidarity does in Poland?
 Can you tell me, is there anything that suggests that there is a
 bottom-up kind of movement that there is going on in Poland -- I
 don't know what I'm trying to say.
 Well,  I have been many times to the U.S.S.R.  in the last
 30 years. The last year,  in June and in July,  I was in Moscow.
 Already when I was Polish Ambassador to Japan,  I was traveling to
 Poland via the U.S.S.R.  And I  know the Russians and the Soviets,
 I think,  quite well.
 Well,  I should like to say,  very frankly,  that although
 I believe that many Russians and other nationalities in the
 U.S.S.R.  are unhappy with the system they have,  that many even
 organize and protest,  in this or another way,  still I think there
 is no comparison to the public mood,    if I may say so,  in the
 U.S.S.R.  and in Poland.
 In the U.S.S.R.,  this Bolshevik Revolution was their
 own.   And many of them,  they honestly believe in their
 revolution.   And don't forget that  for the last 65 years
 they have been brought up under this new system.   Whereas  in
 Poland,     the communism was imposed by the U.S.S.R.,  it was never
 accepted by the population.       I  know this only too well because I,
 myself, was in the Communist Party of Poland.   And believe me,  I
 hardly met a real communist in Poland.   But this is not true
 about the U.S.S.R.
 They have the sense of being superpower, of having some
 would-be mission in the world.        And many of them, unfortunately,
 honestly believe in those would-be ideas.   And this is
 unfortunate.   And I would be not counting too much on the revolt

 Approved For Release 2007/03/14: CIA-RDP88-01070R000100550002-3
 or something like that,  as the case was in Poland.
 HOSTESS:   Let's go back out to Michigan.   Hazel Park....
 MAN:   ...I would first like to compliment him on his
 courage,    and certainly it took a lot of courage for him to do
 what he did.
 What I wanted to ask him was this:   Can he -- after
 being here in America,  can he notice the difference between the
 news media there and here,  in the sense that it seems as though
 that our media is constantly on the negative side of the
 policies of the President,  and certainly the Administration?   And
 I know as a citizen,  myself,  it's left me rather concerned.   I
 don't understand why that we're not fully informed -- our people
 aren't,  certainly -- on the atrocities and the feebleness of the
 Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc nations.   I can't understand why
 we don't seem to get the truth from the media.
 I'd like to get his comment on that.
 RURARZ:   Well,  I  am sorry,  you know,  I will be a bit too
 diplomatic.   If you don't mind,  I would prefer not to comment on
 your question.   I     think that you --    I mean the Americans -- you
 have the right to make any comments on that.           I  am only the guest
 here.
 Well,  I  have very mixed experience.     But believe me
 that your mass media are a million times better than anything in
 the East.    Also,     they are probably still not as good as they
 should be.   But this is up to you to discuss and to improve that.
 And if you don't mind,  I would stop on that.
 HOSTESS:   Mr. Ambassador,  you say that the Polish people
 as a whole don't support communism.   In a recent interview, Lech
 Walesa has stated that any victory to be attained should be done
 -- should be attained politically and not through force.   Would
 you agree with that?
 RURARZ:   Well, unfortunately,  I have to agree.
 Unfortunately, I  say,  because throughout our history we were
 always fighting with the arms in our hands for our freedom.   This
 time the situation is,  unfortunately,  very much different.   We
 cannot,  ourselves -- I mean the Poles alone -- beat the Soviets.
 Quite simply.
 Therefore,  many of us choose,  as I did in the past, to
 change the system by staying within the system,  even within the
 establishment.
 Right now,  to reach out  for arms would be an extreme

 Approved For Release 2007/03/14: CIA-RDP88-0107OR000100550002-3
 bloodshed in Poland,  and certainly would end in a debacle.   But I
 am not excluding that one day it can come to that.   Because if
 the people become desperate and if there is no improvement in
 anything -- we are 36 million,  and several millions of us live in
 the West.   Nobody will kill all of the Poles.   Nobody. And the
 people one day may have enough of everything  and may start
 fighting.    And it would be,  I think,  a problem for the Soviets
 to quell this Polish revolt.
 What I cannot forgive Jaruzelski -- and this was one of
 the reasons why I have defected.   It   is that if he would resist
 to the Soviet pressure,  I think the Soviets would probably not
 risk to invade Poland militarily.   Certainly they would beat the
 Polish Army,  but at a very high price.   And they pobably would
 not risk that.   Now they can do this because the Polish nation is
 a bit split.   Well, there is a couple of thousands of
 Zumwatpruvs (?)  and others and the establishment,  the generals
 and so on.   They are siding with the Soviets.   So that this is
 certainly bad and this is complicating the situation.   But sooner
 or later,  I believe that if the Soviets do not understand the
 Polish situation,  I think they must be prepared that the Polish
 movement -- I mean this resistance -- will become more
 radicalized.
 But we are in a different situation.   We are not in a
 situation comparable to that one in Afghanistan.   We are
 surrounded by the Soviet divisions.   There are only 15 Polish
 divisions against 65 Soviet divisions in Poland and around
 Poland,    plus East German,  six divisions;  plus Czechoslovak,  10
 divisions.   We are,  the Polish troops,    poorly supplied with
 ammunition,  with some other material,  and so that it would be
 difficult  for us to win.
 But certainly -- certainy everything has the limits.
 And one day I would be not excluding that kind of solution.
 HOSTESS:   Let's go down south to Homestead,  Florida.
 MAN:   Ambassador Rurarz,  this is Mr.  Morris.   I'm glad
 you used the expression U.S.S.R.  and U.S.A.   Perhaps you'll
 instruct,    as a professor,  our commentators in this country not to
 refer to the Soviet Union as Russia and the United States of
 America as Americans, as you know why.   We have North Americans,
 South Americans,  and everything.
 Now my question.   Would you suggest that Das Kapital,  as
 you know,  that Karl Marx wrote as a timetable of our destruction,
 be instructed,  not indoctrinated,  instructed in American schools
 on the secondary level,  before they can get  into college,  so they
 can ask their professors intelligent questions?

 Approved For Release 2007/03/14: CIA-RDP88-0107OR000100550002-3
 Also,  you remember Mao Tse-tung wrote a timetable of our
 destruction,  and Hitler wrote a timetable of the West's
 destruction, Mein Kampf.
 Thank you,  sir.
 RURARZ:   Well,  I think that what Marx,  by the way,
 wrote,  nobody realy knows.   What he wrote could be edited in
 something like 40 volumes.    Eleven volumes have been re-edited.
 Eighteen have been very,  very much twisted,  depending on who was
 editing and when.   Everything was changed.   And 11 has -- 11
 volume have been never edited.   So that  if somebody says that he
 knows Marxism,  I must doubt.
 Besides, Marx,  as you know very well,  he wrote Kapital
 for 23 years,    and only 20 copies of his Das Kapital,  the first
 volume,  were sold.   And this is --  I  read Kapital several times,
 and this is a complete misunderstanding from a purely economic
 point of view.   This is nothing.
 And we know -- I mean many Poles -- much more about what
 Marxism means in practice.   I  am afraid that people here  in the
 West do not know much about that.     And especially,  sometimes
 Marx,  Engels,  and so on,  are unnecessarily glorified.   And if
 many people were really reading what Marx and Lenin were writing
 and would,  by the way,  even the [unintelligible]  in English,  like
 Lenin's works and so on,    I think that many would have no
 slightest  illusion,  as you rightly say,  about the goals of
 Marxism-Leninism.
 That's my opinion.
 HOSTESS: ...Let's go out to Indianapolis,  Indiana.
 MAN:   I'd like to welcome you to this country and say
 that I support the efforts of Solidarity and hope that things are
 straightened out so that one day you can return to your country
 in freedom.
 But I              have one question I'd like to ask that kind of
 disturbs me. I  saw an American newscast that showed that some
 Polish people who had left were migrating to the Union of South
 Africa.     And I'd like to know,  are large numbers of people who
 have left,  you know,  moving to South Africa?   And the reason why
 I  ask this, it disturbs me that they would move to South Africa,
 you know,  and the type of repressive government they have against
 the majority black population there.   And I'd just like to have
 your comment on that.
 RURARZ:   I  fully understand you,  and I  am also disturbed
 that this is happening.   But you have to understand that right

 now,  according to very incomplete statistics, there is about
 150,000 Poles in the West looking for a place to live.   And as
 you know, there is the quota here in the United States and, of
 course,  in Western Europe and in Canada,  and even Australia is
 recently limiting.   So that many of these Poles neither can
 return to Poland nor stay in many camps for the refugees,  in
 Austria,  especially,and  in Western Germany.   And  unfortunately,
 some of them,  they believe that by going to South Africa,    maybe
 after some time they will be able to move further,  to Australia
 or to the United States or somewhere,  or even perhaps return to
 Poland one day if the situation would change,    as you believe and
 I  also do believe that it will change.
 But I  agree with you that this is unfortunate.   And,  of
 course,  I  would prefer them not to go.   But please take into
 account that some of them are waiting at the refugee camps for
 more than one year,  having no prospective of going to any
 country.    And returning to Poland would be certain persecution of
 many,  if not worse than that.
 HOSTESS:   To Middletown, Ohio.
 MAN:   Good evening, Dr.  Rurarz.   I  welcome you to the
 land of the free.      And I hope your stay with us is a long and
 happy one.
 Doctor,  I have two questions for you.     The first is on
 the Polish national budget.   As you know,      the Jaruzelski
 government,  economically,  is balancing on the edge of disaster.
 Don't you agree that  in the long run it would be to the best
 interests of all the Polish people for the United States to say
 now that we will no longer save that dictatorship  from financial
 insolvency,  and say to the Russians that if they insist on
 enslaving the Polish people,  that they must  accept the
 responsibility to feed them and clothe them?
 And my second question is upon dealing with the
 Russians on such terribly important questions as disarmament and
 control of nuclear weapons and nuclear freeze,   and so forth.   Our
 President has declared that at any time it suits their purpose,
 the Russians will  lie and cheat to gain their ends.   Would you
 agree with our President on that statement?
 RURARZ: Well,  concerning the budgetary deficit, really,
 it is very big in Poland.   In terms of dollars,  it  is difficult
 to say what  it  is. But the budgetary deficit is something like
 15 percent of the GNP  in Poland,  and it is growing.
 By the way,  I  have very strong suspicion that this
 budgetary deficit  is to a large extent thanks to the very, very
 expanded security police activities in Poland.    By the way,  prior
 to the strike wave in Poland in 1980,  the burden of military
 spendings and spendings on the security police in Poland was
 Approved For Release 2007/03/14: CIA-RDP88-010708000100550002-3
 Approved For Release 2007/03/14: CIA-RDP88-0107OR000100550002-3
 probably equal to 20 percent.   It  is difficult to calculate
 because everything is very secret.   But this is a very heavy
 burden,  something like four times,  relatively,  as big as here in
 the United States.   And this is exclusively in the Soviet
 interest because we do not need to spend that much.   And this
 continues.
 You should remember that the Polish Army is the third-
 largest army in Europe,  after Soviet Army and West German Army.
 We have about 4000 tanks.   And even Poland is producing more
 tanks than the United States.   What  for?   Because we are supposed
 to participate in the Soviet aggression against Western Europe,
 or,  more precisely,  against Northern Germany and some other
 smaller countries.    So that this is there.
 And as long as this continues,  whatever reform or
 would-be reform would be done,  if that burden stays with the
 Polish nation,  we would never bottom out of this crisis which we
 have.
 And therefore I think that sinking new money by the West
 into Poland,  or into any Eastern European country -- U.S.S.R,  of
 course,  included -- is suicidal.   Because first of all, those who
 are providing those regimes with the credits,  they will never see
 the money back.   Never,  I say.   Beside,  they are only supporting
 the dictatorships,  and,  by the way,  increasing the Soviet war
 potential.
 You have provided -- I mean the West -- the Eastern
 countries with something like $80 billion.   This is the
 equivalent of 80,000 tanks,  seven times more than the United
 States has.   So that this is that.
 And the second question -- sorry,  I -- sorry,  I  forgot.
 Oh,  whether I  agree with President Reagan and what he says about
 the Soviet  intentions,  and so on.
 I can assure you, assure you,  that you are underplaying
 the Soviet  intentions.   There is no slightest doubt -- I could
 even quote right now several examples from my memory how much teh
 Soviets are prepared to jump on the West.   It only depends when
 they will do that and where.   Very likely it could be Western
 Europe,  Northern Germany,  in Persian Gulf, or somewhere else.
 And they are deadly serious about it.   Very deadly serious.
 The Soviet armed forces are the offensive armed forces.
 And the Warsaw Pact forces,  like the Polish Army,  is also like
 that.   And there is no joke about that.  That superiority which
 they have already gained in conventional and chemical weaponry
 and in the number of troops,  and so on,  is now compounded by the
 superiority in both tactical and strategic nuclear weapons.

 And I believe that you are the only ones, the Americans,
 which can reverse that trend,  if you only do what you say.
 Because right now there is much more rhetoric than actual acts.
 The others are already capitulating before the U.S.S.R.
 Don't  forget  that  the combined GNP  of Western Germany
 and France is as big as that one of the U.S.S.R.   Whereas
 militarily speaking, these two countries combined are a peanut
 comparing to the Soviet war potential.   Japan has the GNP almost
 equal to the Soviet one.   And again,  militarily,  they are a
 peanut comparing to the Soviets.
 If this goes like that,  I  am very much afraid,  very much
 afraid that there will be the war.       I  am not going to scare
 everybody -- and the Soviets will win it.
 HOSTESS:   Brookfield,  Connecticut.
 MAN:   I have a question for Dr.  Rurarz.   Knowing the
 political situation as it  is,       in his beliefs,  the ideology in
 Poland,  that what might happen.   But what's going to happen now,
 presently,  with their economy?   How are the Polish people going
 to survive the present economic disaster,      I would call  it?
 RURARZ:   Yes. Well,     this is a very hard answer for me.
 The living standard in Poland in the last three years,       and
 especially this year,  has been reduced for some groups of the
 population by as much as 40 percent.   And that standard of living
 was relatively low already.   For the next year,  another,  maybe,
 20 percent  for most of the people,  another reduction in the
 standard of living can be the case.
 Right now, many of the people are quite simply, on the
 purely medical grounds,  undernourished.   And this is a tragedy,
 especially for the children.
 But on the other hand,  the Poles are quite accustomed to
 difficult living conditions.   And I believe they would never
 trade certain freedoms for any material improvements.   Besides,
 those material  improvements without those freedoms are quite
 simply impossible.
 So that the Poles will certainly endure.   And they will
 be waiting for the better times,  in a difficult situation,  to be
 sure.   But  I am a hundred percent sure that the Poles will never
 capitulate.   Never.
 There's only the question,  as I was saying,  what  forms
 of their resistance they will be opting for.   But they will not
 capitulate.   And sooner or later,  Jaruzelski and the Soviets will
 come to a collision with the Polish nation,  I believe.   It's only

 a question of time.
 HOSTESS:   Speaking of freedoms for the Polish people,
 under the civil rule,  when martial law is lifted,  the government
 will be imbued with a whole host of other powers.   What powers --
 how will that affect...
 RURARZ:   Well, may I  quote the example that during the
 so-called Stalinist era in Poland,  '49-53,  there was no martial
 law.   And you can believe me that it was much worse than under
 the martial law recently.   People were disappearing from the
 streets, mysteriously dying.   Many were persecuted in all
 possible ways,  and so on,      including even the communists,  by the
 way and the army elite.   Many Polish officials were shot,  quite
 simply,  because the Soviets,  who were controlling the Polish
 Army,  were believing that they were nevertheless -- although they
 were the party members sometimes,  that they were the Polish
 patriots,  for example.   And they were shot, many of them.   So
 that -- and there was no state of war.
 Now,  I think one can replace the state of war by fairly
 the same as it was during the Stalinist era,  especially that you
 have Andropov in the U.S.S.R.,  who has very long experience in
 KGB and so on,  and he knows how to do that.  And he will be
 pressing Jaruzelski,  or anybody as who will be his successor,  to
 do exactly what the Soviets would like to do.
 HOSTESS:   Arlington, Virginia.
 MAN: Yes, Mr.  Ambassador.   Historically,  given the poor
 relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, how would you
 assess Soviet  intentions in their relations toward the Japanese
 government?
 And secondly,  as Ambassador to Japan from Poland,  what
 were Polish relations with Japan?   That  is,  what were your
 objectives as Ambassador to Japan?
 RURARZ:   Well,  starting with the second question --
 second part of your question.   Before the martial law was
 declared,    the relations between the Polish government and the
 Japanese [technical difficulties] and improving.   And I
 personally had very good relations with the Japanese government.
 And should martial law been not declared in Poland,  I  think that
 those relations were very,  very promising.
 When it comes to the Soviet relations with Japan,  they
 are quite simply intimdiating Japan.   You know that they have
 these four islands,  northern islands, and there are the military
 bases around.   And they are even strengthening recently.   And I
 think the Japanese are quite aware of that.   And I think that

 Approved For Release 2007/03/14: CIA-RDP88-01070R000100550002-3
 you,  the Americans,  are even more aware of that.   And you press
 the Japanese to do something about that.
 Of course,   the Japanese,  they have some problems in
 complying with legitimate requests by the U.S.  Government.   They
 are doing something;  however,  not as much as they should,  I
 believe.    Because for Japan to spend one percent of their GNP on
 defense is really nothing,  especially that they are that vitally
 dependent on the sea lines and on the defense in general of their
 air space and so on.
 So I  think that they should do more.   But,  of course,  it
 is a free democratic government,  it has its own parliament.   And
 what they will do is up to them.
 HOSTESS:   San Antonio,  Texas.
 MAN:   About five months ago the United States paid
 interest on Polish loans from European banks to avoid Poland's
 default.   And my question was,  if the United States would have
 allowed Poland to default on these loans,  what effect would it
 have on the Polish economy and would this have created greater
 Soviet control over the Polish people?
 RURARZ:   Well,  I was, myself, several times advocating
 the declaration in default.   Well,  I understand that the
 situation is very difficult because the United States is only one
 of the partners in the club,  I would say.   There is 15 countries,
 all together, who have substantial assets in Poland -- well,
 assets.     Now they are certainly not.   And the action should be
 coordinated.   And there are some countries,  like Western Germany,
 and so on,  who feel that if Poland would be declared in default,
 they could lose.   I think they will lose anyway.   And that that
 could spread to some other Eastern countries,  and so on.
 Well,  I understand that this is a very delicate
 political question.   Although,  as I said,  I don't believe that
 anybody will recovery any of the money invested in Eastern Europe
 and in the U.S.S.R.   Probably the situation will be like that,
 that the West will be again lending the East,  rolling over the
 principal,  lending new credits to recover the interest payments,
 and financing the experts.   That is the only possible way out,
 which is,  of course, not a way out,  because the debt will be
 growing,    and the bankers and the governments will be never seeing
 the money back.
 So that I think that the hour is truth is coming,  and
 the Western countries will have to do something about that.   But
 many of them are terribly exposed.
 Take Austria.   Austria has lent for about $6 billion to

 Approved For Release 2007/03/14: CIA-RDP88-01070R000100550002-3
 the East.   Taking on a per capita basis,  here in the United
 States it would be the equivalent of something like $160 billion.
 So by declaring the country or the countries in default,
 you would never see that money back,  legally even.
 So that many people have certain [unintelligible].   But
 whether they would see that money back without declaring those
 countries in default,  well,  I  don't know.   But  from a purely
 legal point of view,   Poland is not servicing the inter-
 governmental debts.                           Only come commercial banks are getting some
 of the money.   And besides,  I don't believe that if nothing is
 basically changed,  that Poland would be able to serve -- not only
 Poland;  the other countries too.
 HOSTESS: Jacksonville,  Florida.
 MAN: Let me welcome the Ambassador,  and also to let him
 be assured that the American people would certainly have his
 concern for his family,  and we would empathize with him in that
 relationship, and know what he must be going through there.
 And thirdly,  real quickly, to say that let me encourage
 him to continue this type dialogue and to offer himself for
 cross-examination.   It's been most  informative,  and points of
 view that we really don't get the chance to have expressed to us
 from people who are really involved with it.
 Now to my question.   We hear much in this country about
 those who say that this Russian buildup of arms and their control
 of Eastern Europe,  and things,  is strictly because of their
 paranoia through history about different countries invading them.
 And then these same people will use the argument that we have a
 parnoia ourselves,  that we really think the Russians are slowly
 going to pick away at us,  which really they don't have these
 goals or ambitions.
 And is this true about both of us?   Or  is there one
 point of view more sure about that?   And you,  as a Pole,  did you
 ever fear that the Americans wanted to use their techno...
 HOSTESS:   Caller,  do you think the Soviet Union has
 those intentions?
 MAN:   Do I think they're expansionist?
 MAN:   Yes.   I'm one who believes that their will -- they
 are there to probe our weaknesses when we allow them.   That's the
 reason they have this large forces.   And to suppress and to keep

 Approved For Release 2007/03/14: CIA-RDP88-01070R000100550002-3
 their people in line,  which we've never used our power to try and
 suppress a person,  to make them believe the way we wanted to.
 The only thing we ever used,  I think,  and what history teaches me
 and what I've been either brainwashed to believe -- that the only
 thing we used our power for was to allow people to have their
 freedoms.
 HOSTESS: Do you think the Soviets were behind the
 assassination attempt of the Pope?
 MAN:   Evidence indicates that.   I can't be sure of that.
 Except from what we've been told,  it would seem that -- I can
 see how it would be logical that they would be.   I'm not
 absolutely sure,  but I  think that it could fit  in the scheme of
 things.
 But he's more involved in this type thing.   He seems to
 have had some history with them.   Do they have a true paranoia,
 or do they have expansionist goals?
 RURARZ:   Well,  I think that,  as I was already saying,
 that you are a bit underplaying the Soviet threat.      And if you
 look at the Soviet behavior in the last 30 years,  or something
 like that,  you can very easily detect that they slowly,  or even
 sometimes not that much slowly,  are creeping forward.   And ever
 more,  they somehow grab under their control.
 It happened last year that I  was in [unintelligible]  and
 I saw the Soviet big fighters and the Soviet officers.    So
 wherever you go,  you see the new places where they move forward.
 And I think that they are very much prepared  for the strike,  I
 think,  in Western Europe,  in Northern Germany,  as I was saying.
 If you look at the map -- I don't know why sometimes you
 are not attaching the importance to that -- and if you would see
 how the Soviet troops are deployed,  how much they are armed,  and
 so on,  you would clearly see that this is exactly the situation
 in which 24 hours -- sometimes  it could be in 48,  but I believe
 that the    front-line troops could [unintelligible] readiness could
 be made in 24 hours -- that they can strike.   And I can assure
 you that the Third Soviet Guard Division,  which is composed of
 five divisions,  four tank divisions and one motorized rifle
 division,  could break the crust of the Western defenses,  of the
 Bundeswehr,  because the American Army is to the south.   And
 immediately,  over these German flanks,  22 Soviet divisions plus
 six East German and 15 Polish would enter;  and in three days'
 time would be probably half of Western Germany, Denmark,  the
 Netherlands and Belgium taken,  if the U.S. would not use their
 nuclear tactical weapons.
 And here  is the situation,  whether you would use.

 Approved For Release 2007/03/14: CIA-RDP88-0107OR000100550002-3
 Because right now the Soviets,  they have the superiority in
 theater nuclear weapons in Europe and in strategic ICBMs.   You
 would be risking your own territory.
 And if you don't use that,  I can assure you that the
 conventional chemical attack by the Soviet and some Eastern
 European armies would win,  if it would materialize.   This is not
 a paranoia.   I'm only wondering why many people do not believe in
 that.   If they don't believe,  well,   they should explain why the
 Soviets have four times more tanks in this so-called northern
 [unintelligible],  which is 250 miles long in Western Germany --
 in Northern Germany.   Why they have such a superiority.   In
 close-support combat planes is also almost four times the
 superiority.   Everything is prepared for the attack.
 They may not decide to attack because there is the
 Persian Gulf,  there is some other possibilities,  and so on.   And
 besides,    the Polish situation,  I think,  has very much  foiled
 their strategy plans.
 But this is that.   And I  don't know why this  is played
 down and believed that this is paranoia,  that if some people say
 this,  this is not true.   Well,   I can assure you, with all the
 responsibility,  I know this very well because I  was very much,
 myself,  involved in that.
 The intelligence service of all the Warsaw Pact
 countries is gathering all the information concerning the
 possibility of the roads,  of the bridges,  of everything,  of all
 the details,  air shelters,  everything.   And this is updated on a
 continuous basis.
 Why you need -- why you think this is really needed?
 And this is not only covering the NATO countries in Western
 Europe, but also Switzerland,  for instance.
 I can assure you I  am not lying.
 HOSTESS:   ...Let's go out to Warren, Michigan.
 MAN:   Maybe we'll take this down to more of a personal
 level.   I'm a young man of Polish descent and my relatives speak
 Polish and we go to Polish meetings and groups and have general
 Polish-American activities.   Yet the question to us, what can we
 do here in America?   Is there something that the people of Poland
 would want us to do,  those that our ancestors had come to America
 in the last hundred years?   Perhaps  is there something that we,
 being in a country that is free,   would have more options
 available to us to change things in the world,  to help other
 people?

 might do?
 HOSTESS:   Caller,  do you have some thoughts on what we
 MAN:   Well,  of course,  we write letters.   And sometimes
 we  wonder of the  censorship --  just  to  keep  the  people over  there
 aware that we are concerned and to give them hope.   But we really
 don't know what we could do as far as the governments are
 concerned.
 HOSTESS:   Would you support continuing economic
 sanctions against the Polish government,  even though perhaps they
 might hurt the Polish people themselves?
 MAN:   I'm really [unintelligible] understand all the
 implications of the economic policies.   But I really don't -- I
 really wouldn't want any of our money going toward the military
 aspects of the economy.
 RURARZ:   Well,  I think that what the Poles here can do,
 well,  they should stay united and they should exercise the
 influence on the senators, members of the House,  on the govern-
 ment.                    And by the way,  this is being done.   And I  think that they
 remain active.   But I would wish they would be more active,  as
 the case was during the First World War.   And I think that this
 large Polish community in the United States and the other Western
 countries could be very much influential.   And I would wish more
 activities by this community.   And I think that this will be the
 case.   I   strongly believe that.
 Well,  as I say,  well, it's up to you.   You decide.   You
 are meeting over there.       I  am hardly showing up during such
 meetings,  and so on.   But I believe you also will  find the proper
 way.
 HOSTESS:   Mr.  Ambassador,  what do you think about the
 economic sanctions?
 RURARZ:   Well, I think that the economic sanctions
 should be definitely continued.   And there  is absolutely -- the
 just decision by the U.S. Government,  with the MFN treatment,
 with the credits which have been suspended,  and so on,  this is
 absolutely so.      Because after all,  by assisting the junta,  or the
 Polish government,  you would be, in a way,  facilitating its
 situation.   And then the government would be oppressing the
 people and would be even rewarded for that oppression.    And this
 could be a wrong signal to the Polish nation.
 So that I think that what has been done by the United
 States was the right decision.   I would only wish that some other
 Western governments would do the same.   However,  they did not do
 that.   And I think that the United States should also not forget

 about the U.S.S.R.,  who is the main instigator and the main
 troublemaker in Poland.
 And this is,  of course,  a much more complicated
 question,   even,  as we know,  because Western Europeans,  the
 Japanese do not    go  along.  Although  the Americans  also,  they
 believe that by selling the grains to the U.S.S.R.  you will
 settle the problem of your agriculture.   This is also wrong.
 But -- well.
 HOSTESS:   Seattle,  Washington.
 MAN:  Mr.  Ambassador,  I just want to say God bless,  and
 I just wish yu the best of luck in trying to free Poland.
 I want to say a few things to the listeners out there in
 America concerning communism and the worldwide communist
 movement.   The American Congress in 1950 passed the Subversive
 Activities Control Act of 1950.   And it says,  "As a result of
 evidence adduced before various committees of the Senate and the
 House of Representatives, Congress hereby [unintelligible]  that
 there exists a world communist movement which,   in its origins,  in
 its development and its present practice,  is a worldwide
 revolutionary movement whose purpose it is,  by treachery,  to seek
 infiltration into other groups,            governmental and otherwise...."
 RURARZ:   Well,  I know,       I think, quite well the history
 of the assistance by the West to the U.S.S.R.,  which started
 right after the revolution.  And unfortunately, the Americans
 played a very substantial role here.   I  wouldn't like to mention
 the names.   You probably know those names.
 And everybody,   somehow,  was always believing that by
 investing money in the U.S.S.R.,       in Eastern Europe,  that he's
 changing the nature of communism,  that they will be nicer
 guys,  and so on.
 Right now I  think you should,  you should,   after having
 the experience of almost 65 years of helping the Soviets and
 communism in general,  financially, and not only financially.
 Sometimes politically too -- that I  think that this is the
 right time now to sum up what are the results of those policies
 and to draw the proper conclusions.
 If you continue -- I mean not -- by saying you,  I think
 the West -- the old policies -- and I believe that many in the
 West are very much itching to restart this erroneous approach to
 the Eastern countries,  that  you can change the nature of

 communism by investing money,  by being nice to them,  and so on.
 Well,  you will not.
 I think Alexander Solzhenitsyn is right,  that the
 communists are writing very openly what they want to do with the
 West,  with the democracies and so on.   Somebody,  however,  does
 not believe that.   He believes that this is only the rhetoric,
 that they have to say something like that,  and after all they do
 not believe.
 You can believe me that I, myself,  was within that
 movement.   Although I was Polish,  so I was first Polish and
 afterwards I was in the movement.   But  I know very well the
 Soviets.    They were not joking about it. They were very serious
 about that.
 Well,  I think it's time to realize that.
 HOSTESS:   Good evening,  Cincinnati,  Ohio.
 MAN:   My compliments to the Ambassador.   And I would
 like to ask the Ambassador if he sees [unintellible] how the
 other Warsaw Pact nations are holding up,  and do you see other
 countries in the Warsaw Pact having the same problems as Poland,
 like Hungary and Czechoslovakia?   Do you see them having many of
 the same economic or political problems as your country has?
 RURARZ:   Well,  think about the Polish Army.   I have to
 defend that army.   Because during the martial  law,  the army was
 very little involved.  Only three divisions were taken for some
 logistical missions,  and the soldiers were not having the
 contact,    even,  with the workers and with the population.
 Everything was done by the security police and the special units
 of the so-called Zomo  (?), who are the criminals and so on.   So
 that the Polish Army,  which is three-quarters composed of the
 conscripts,  I think one day can carry out the appropriate mission
 as the Poles can do.   And these 200 Polish generals who are
 siding with Jaruzelski are definitely riot those who represent the
 Polish Army.   There are many other senior officers who think
 otherwise.
 They had no occasion,  by the way,  to demonstrate that.
 Because if the Soviets would invade Poland,  certainly there could
 be a spontaneous resistance to the Soviets.   Here,  they were
 caught by surprise themselves.   The Polish Army is
 well-disciplined.   They didn't know how to behave,  and so on.
 Besides,    as I  said, the Polish Army was staying a bit aside.   But
 I strongly believe that that army one day will properly play
 their role, and I  think that we should remember about that.
 There are many, many signs that the soldiers,  junior

 officers,  and many senior officers do not support that situation
 which exists in Poland.   There is,  however,  very limited  field of
 maneuver for the time being.   But let's be patient.
 HOSTESS:      Out to Eau Claire,  Wisconsin.
 MAN:   Mr.    Ambassador,  two short questions.   Just how
 widespread is dissent amongst your people in Poland?           And is
 there a possibility for a revolution in the near future?
 RURARZ:   Well,  first of all,    we have to remember that
 that peaceful revolution which was mostly led by the Solidarity
 movement,  and not only,     was mostly composed of the young people,
 mostly of the young people,  of this new generation which does not
 remember the wartime,  and even the first postwar period in
 Poland.     And that new generation of the Poles -- and you should
 remember that the Polish nation,  demographically speaking,  is a
 very young nation.   The average age of the Pole is 27 years.   So
 that we're a young nation,  demographically speaking.
 Those Poles who stayed for 16 months free,  the germ of
 freedom has penetrated their minds.   And by  force,  you will not
 change the minds of the Poles.
 So that this is only a question of time,  as I was
 saying.     The powder keg exists in Poland.   It is only the
 question of spark.
 HOSTESS:   New Orleans,  Louisiana.
 MAN:   Some say that [unintelligible] heading the new
 Polish government.   Why was Jaruzelski chosen over him?
 HOSTESS:   Caller, are you still there?   Why was'
 Jaruzelski chosen over?
 HOSTESS:   Stefan Oszowski?   Could you give us some
 background on that?
 MAN:   Well,  I'd heard that Stefan Oszowski was a...
 RURARZ:   Oh,  Olzevski  (?),  you mean.
 MAN:   Yes.
 RURARZ:   Oh,  yes,  yes.   Okay.   Yes,  yes.   I couldn't
 understand the name.

 Well, why Jaruzelski was chosen by the Soviets and not
 The Soviets arrived at the conclusion that the party,
 the Communist Party is unable to [unintelligible]  the situation
 in Poland.  And that the Soviets,  who were planning the military
 coup in Poland through Jaruzelski,  they were trusting only him.
 And they knew that he is the professional,  that he can do that.
 Olzevski has no slightest  idea about the army,  security police,
 and so on,  although he's pro-Soviet.   Jaruzelski has.   He has a
 very good training.   He has experience, wartime experience,
 postwar experience.   He is the professional.   When he was
 attending the Soviet War Academy in Moscow,  he was the first one
 among the participants at this War Academy.
 So that they believed that he would do the job.   And he
 definitely did,  for the time being,  at least.   So that their
 choice was here as it was.   They wanted to have the professionals
 who would have some authority among the people.
 By the way,  Jaruzelski had the repuation among the
 people that he was not very much pro-Soviet,  because he,  himself,
 spent some time in the Soviet concentration camp.   His father
 died over there.   And people wanted to believe that he would not
 follow the Soviet orders.   Unfortunately,  he did. And that was
 one of the reasons that also caught by surprise many of the
 Poles.
 But that's not the end of the story.   This is the only
 the beginning.
 HOSTESS:   All right.
 We've been spending the last hour with Dr.  Zdzisla
 Rurarz,  the  former Polish Ambassador to Japan,   who defected to
 the United States when martial law was imposed there.
 In the last remaining minutes,  do you see the emergence
 of the Solidarity union again,  or any other movement that might
 grant    freedoms to the...
 RURARZ:   Well,  the Solidarity was never liquidated,  as
 such.   It exists in the underground.   And I believe it will
 exist.   It has become a symbol and it will exist.   However, what
 will be the form of it,      whether this will be only a trade union
 movement or anything else,  it remains to be seen.   It will be not
 erased from the memory of the Poles.    Out of the question.
 All right.
 Thanks to all of our viewers who participated....
