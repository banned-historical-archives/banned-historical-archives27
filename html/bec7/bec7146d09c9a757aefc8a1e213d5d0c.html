 lieve merits the attention of Members of
 Congress.
 I ask unanimous consent that this
 study, by Robert Yoshioka, Galen Fox,
 Stuart Kiang, John Goodbody, and Brian
 Lederer, be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the state-
 ment was ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:

 Pacific Ocean, on the west bounded by the
 high ranges of the Tien Shan, the Pamirs,
 and the Himalayas.  On the north China is
 separated from Russia by wide desert and
 steppe terrain.  Solely in the south, through
 the valleys leading to Indochina, Burma, and
 Thailand, has there been an opening for
 Chinese expansion. As the only strong Com-
 munist  nation                          in  southeast  Asia,  China
 serves as the Communist base in this area.
 More than half of the Chinese land fron-
 tier lies along the borders of other Com-
 munist countries, principally Russia.                          This
 brings China into conflict with her northern
 neighbor, for, in her efforts to decrease the
 population problem in her central and south-
 ern provinces, Red China has been forced
 to  increase  colonization  of  her northern
 border areas, which have long been under
 Russian  influence?     Across  the   Taiwan
 Straits lies Formosa, a constant source of
 irritation to Red China.
 In addition to these geographic realities,
 the factor of Red China's population has a
 vital influence on her internal and foreign
 policy.  Based on the 1954 figure of 583
 million, and counting on an average increase
 of 12 to 13 million per year, the Chinese
 population now approximates 660 million?

 nomic and technical development.  Agricul-
 ture is the basis of the Chinese economy;
 however, because of China's lack of modern
 tools and materials, the chief target of the
 "Great Leap Forward" has been industry?s
 China is far behind Russia in this respect,
 and is dependent on Russia for heavy ma-
 chinery of all types: It is evident that China
 needs to increase her agricultural as well as
 industrial  production,  and  machinery  is
 vital to both.
 In her attempt to build up the economy,
 China is conducting a campaign to promote
 increasing self-sufficiency at home in order
 to lessen her dependence on foreign prod-
 ucts.  The recent crop failures throughout
 China have accentuated this need, and the
 communes have been placing emphasis on
 local self-sufficiency as well"

 dence of Red China's attempt not to rely
 on one nation-notably the Soviet Union-

 avoid the status of a satellite?4

 Today, aware of their backwardness, the
 Chinese are anxious to regain their former
 position in the center of the world.
 The other historical aspect of Chinese na-
 tionalism is a reaction of hostility toward
 and suspicion of the West as a result of
 nearly a century of exploitation by the West-
 tern Powers.  Thus, Chinese nationalism ex-
 presses itself through a drive toward regain-
 ing her former position of preeminence in
 the world.
 Hardened by the years spent in gaining
 control  of  China, the Communist leaders
 feel a strong sense of mission to speed up the
 course of an inevitable world revolution. In
 April 1960 the editors of Red Flag stated:
 "We are living in a great epoch in which
 the collapse of the imperialist system is be-
 ing further accelerated."
 The Chinese are doing all they can to
 speed up the course of the world revolution.
 They promote constant change with the hope
 that each change will further their long-
 term aims.  Thus, they are willing to make
 temporary tactical retreats when necessary
 if these retreats will bring closer the world
 revolution.  The Chinese are not concerned
 with freezing the status quo or stabilizing
 the situation.  This indicates their desire of
 using every possible means, formal and in-
 formal, overt and covert, to influence social
 trends, political  opinions,  and  economic
 conditions within foreign countries which
 will further revolutionary changes 1'  As will
 be demonstrated, the Chinese use a variety
 of tools in the implementation of their aims
 abroad.
 Chinese Communist doctrine is based on
 orthodox Leninism.  The Chinese Commu-
 nists attack the "modern revisionists" who
 hold that Leninism is outmoded.  Building
 on the base of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Tse-
 Tung has developed a philosophy adopting
 a more militant attitude toward the world
 struggle, as evinced by his statement:  -

 the pages which I have asked to be in-
 serted in the RECORD.  I would like to
 have the whole book appear in the REC-
 ORD, but it would be rather costly.  If
 that is the desire of the Senate, I shall
 be glad to include the whole book in the
 RECORD at some later time.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. In the book is
 there some statement made that, ac-
 cording to Mr. Welch, the late John
 Foster Dulles, one of our great Secre-
 taries of State, and his brother, Allen
 Dulles, head of the Central Intelligence
 Agency, were, likewise, agents or dupes
 of the Communists?
 Mr. YOUNG of North Dakota.  That
 is correct. I wish to read just one para-
 graph with reference to President Eisen-
 hower.  It is one that has not received
 much publicity. It appears on page 266
 of the book:
 For the sake of honesty, however, i want
 to  confess  here  my own  conviction  that
 Eisenhower's motivation is more ideological
 than opportunistic.  Or, to put it bluntly,
 I personally think that he has been sympa-
 thetic to ultimate Communist aims, realis-
 tically willing to use Communist means to
 help them achieve their goals, knowingly ac-
 cepting and abiding by Communist orders,
 and consciously serving the Communist con-
 spiracy, for all of his adult life.
 That is what he said about President
 Eisenhower.
 Mr.  MANSFIELD.  I  think  every
 American would consider as a slur on
 our entire country any imputation on
 the character of either former President
 Eisenhower or his brother Milton Eisen-
 hower.                  The same would apply to the
 late great Secretary of State, John Fos-
 ter Dulles, and his brother, Allen Dulles.
 It is my understanding that this so-
 ciety advocates, among other things, the
 impeachment of Earl Warren, Chief Jus-
 tice of the United States; the repeal of
 all income taxes; vigorous opposition to
 the NATO alliance, and similar opposi-
 tion to the United Nations-all this, and
 more, too.
 I ask unanimous consent to have
 printed at this point in the RECORD a
 commentary from the Christian Science
 Monitor of recent date, under the title
 "State of the Nations; Far-Right Goals."
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 FAR-RIGHT GOALS
 (By William H. Stringer)
 WASHINGTON,--Some Americans are under-
 standably concerned that the free world,
 particularly the United States, is not win-
 ning more immediate battles against com-
 munism.                          They may become even more wor-
 ried before the rugged Lao crisis is resolved,
 though  elsewhere  new  tactics  and  ap-
 proaches by the United States-in Africa and
 Latin America, for instance-hold promise
 of halting the Communist inroads if every-
 one is resolute.
 But a question is posed right here, as rad-
 ical right-wing organizations such as the
 John Birch Society receive an unusual and
 perhaps unwarranted amount of publicity.
 This is whether the programs and prescrip-
 tions of the far right, which are billed as
 combating communism, really do this very
 effectively and safely.
 Everyone must make up his own mind
 here.  Is a program responsible and percep-
 tive; or is it based on a dim comprehension
 of what is happening in the world and a
 malaise which is, at base, a wish to be living Mr. JAVITS.  Madam President, will

 quote: "Neither the list of our members of

 Most of the people who I believe are mem-

 commendation for this objective.
 You  condemn  me  for inserting  in  the
 RECORD a sermon by the Reverend John A.
 Crane. This was a part of a series of articles
 printed in the Santa Barbara News-Press. I
 might say that the News-Press is not a left-
 wing publication.   It is  a very reputable
 newspaper.  Incidentally, its managing ed-
 itor, Mr. Veblen, is a former North Dakotan.
 Your statement, "Wittingly or unwittingly
 you are serving the cause of communism"
 is typical of many of the letters I am re-
 ceiving from people I suspect are members
 of the John Birch Society.  Apparently this
 is part of your doctrine.   You label every-
 one who disagrees with you on any subject
 a Communist or pro-Communist.  Am I to
 believe that irresponsible accusations such
 as this are symbolic of the lofty objectives
 of the John Birch Society of more respon-
 sibility and a better world?
 Very truly yours,
 MILTON R. YOUNG.

 BIRCHERS  "OUT OF Focus,"  CATHOLIC PAPER
 SAYS
 BOSTON, April 7.-The Pilot, official organ
 of the Boston Roman Catholic Archdiocese,
 today said that the John Birch Society move-
 ment "with all kinds of good intentions al-
 lowed, is unbalanced, excited and definitely
 out of focus."
 On page 1 of the same issue, the Pilot
 printed a story on Richard Cardinal Cush-
 ing's speech Wednesday at North Easton.  At
 that  time,  the cardinal  described Robert
 Welch, founder of the Birch Society, as "a
 sincere and dedicated man."
 In its lead editorial, titled "The Unbal-
 anced View," the newspaper said:
 "In a world as complex as ours, simplifica-
 tion can be a vice and sincerity is no excuse
 for exaggeration.  Nothing discredits a good
 cause quicker than supporting it by misrep-
 resentation.  When we feed the cause of
 genuine anticommunism with overstatement,
 we err just as badly as those who nourish
 communism itself by understatement * * *."
 The Pilot said that the lessons that can
 be profitably drawn from such an endeavor-
 "a good thing gone wrong"-are many and
 should not be lost on thoughtful observers.
 "In protecting ourselves against commu-
 nism," the Pilot said, "We should be careful
 that we do not fall into evils almost as bad.
 It is possible to escape the dogs only to
 perish in the swamp.
 "Moreover, we must remember that we
 cannot rewrite history; it is fatuous to speak
 of  returning to the  simplicity  of  earlier
 times or to suggest carrying out the respon-
 sibilities  of present-day Government with
 the machinery of the 18th century.
 "We live in a real world with real prob-
 lems which we must meet realistically; there
 is no place for hysteria, exaggeration, accusa-
 tion or misrepresentation in an authentic
 anti-Communist effort."

 persons who, through concerted action,    There being no objection, the excerpts
 lif
 e or
 would work important changes in the
 government of the republic.
 All we know about the John Birch Society
 is what we read in the papers.  It is quite
 enough to draw some conclusions. It is quite
 enough to be reminded that a patent-medi-
 cine cure for evil can often be just about as
 bad as the evil itself.  The founder of the
 John Birch Society, Robert Welch, of Bel-
 mont, Mass., quite candidly condones mean
 and dirty tactics in opposition to the mean
 and  dirty  Communists  and  presumably
 against all the other things the society and
 its members oppose.
 These are the publicized characteristics of
 the John Birchers that strike us most forci-
 bly: They are againsters, and they eschew
 the tools of reason and democracy in their
 assault on those things they are against.
 Although  Mr.  Welch  calls  his  society
 "monolithic," his againsters have their own
 peeves. All, by the very mature of their asso-
 ciation, are against Communists-and, if that
 was as far as it went, the society would be
 the mosp popular in the country. But the
 record shows that they are also against those
 who just anybody says may be a Communist
 or  a  Communist  sympathizer.      They  are
 against liberals.  They are against taxes in
 any amount necessary to mount a real de-
 fense against the real Communists.
 Some   are  against the public schools as
 being  dominated     by  radicals.  Some  are
 against newspapers, the Communist press, to
 use  a phrase   popular      among  the  John
 Birchers.
 On the local front, some are against school
 consolidation.    Some, not only in the South,
 are against integration of the races in the
 schools and elsewhere.   Some  are against
 textbooks that appear to them to be obscene
 or radical.
 Most members, it appears, are against Re-
 publicans Dwight Eisenhower, Earl Warren,
 and Nelson Rockefeller. and against John
 Kennedy (Reuther's stooge) and Harry Tru-
 man.
 We mean no blanket indictment of the
 John Birch Society.  There is a place in our
 society for organizations that are against
 the things the John Birchers are against.
 There should be a place in such organiza-
 tions  for  positive                                                                        as  well  as  negative
 principles.
 The John Birch Society publicity will serve
 a  good purpose if   it alerts  some of the
 society's members to the dangers of a pro-
 gram overburdened with ill will, and if it
 alerts men of good will to their own respon-
 sibilities for action on matters of public con-
 cern.   The citizen who refuses to take an
 active role in determining the policies of his
 schools, his Government and other public
 affairs is in no position to be critical of the
 active role pursued by the extremists.  It is
 no public service, for example, just to be
 against the John Birch Society.
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 The political affiliations of some of Eisen-
 hower's appointees, however, are as vague
 and mysterious as were his own.  Also, the
 categories above do sometimes overlap with
 regard to a particular individual; that is,
 he may appear to be a leftwing Democrat,
 for instance, and actually be a Communist.
 So we are going to list below some 40 ap-
 pointments made by Eisenhower, or which
 could not have been made by department
 heads under him, if he disapproved, with-
 out trying to separate them into the three
 classifications.  But we shall try, in most
 cases, to make clear the place of the appoint-
 ment in this whole story, by at least a brief
 word of comment.
 1. Milton  Eisenhower:  Presidential  ad-
 viser.  At least in appearance.  Had always
 been an ardent New Dealer, to put it mildly,
 and still is. Proof of at least pro-Commu-
 nist leanings is implicit in his support of
 Owen Lattimore, and of others like him, at
 Johns Hopkins.  In my opinion the chances
 are very strong that Milton Eisenhower is
 actually Dwight Eisenhower's superior and
 boss within the Communist Party.  For one
 thing he is obviously a great deal smarter.
 2. Maxwell E. Rabb: Presidential adviser,
 and assistant for relations with minority
 groups: First official title, "associate coun-
 sel" for the President;  then "Secretary to
 the Cabinet."  Now in private law practice.
 Drew a salary all during 1952, while helping
 to run the Eisenhower campaign, for a post
 he never filled with the Democratic-con-
 trolled  Senate                                                                                                                                 Judiciary  Committee.  The
 staff director of this committee did not even
 know him.
 Max Rabb is a very clever and cagey man.
 Proof that he is a Communist would not be
 easy, except as a logical deduction from his
 overall  actions  and  visible  purposes.   In
 masterminding the steal of the Republican
 nomination at Chicago in 1952, however, he
 followed so faithfully and cleverly the exact
 Communist technique, of always accusing
 your enemy, first and loudly, of the very
 crime which you yourself are committing,
 that the long arm of coincidence would be
 strained in reaching so far.
 3. John Foster Dulles: Secretary of State.
 America's case against Secretary Dulles and
 company was presented by Senator William
 E. Jenner in an article in the April 1956
 issue of the American Mercury.  We cov-
 ered a certain amount of additional ground
 on pages 23 to 28 of the June 1958 issue of
 American Opinion.  We'll try to summarize
 these and other appraisals here as briefly
 as we can.
 John Foster Dulles is the man who chiefly
 persuaded Thomas E. Dewey and the Re-
 publican opposition, in  1944 and 1948, to
 go along with, instead of fighting, the pro-
 Communist foreign policies of the Roose-
 velt and Truman administrations.   Dulles

 Mr. YOUNG of North Dakota. Madam
 President, for many weeks I have been
 receiving a considerable number of let-
 ters condemning me for being opposed
 to the John Birch Society.  Since it is
 a secret organization, there is no way to
 know for certain whether the writers of
 these letters are members of the John
 Birch Society.  A small percentage will
 admit they are members.     Most of the
 letters follow the same pattern, however,
 that is, if one is opposed to anything the
 head of this organization, Mr. Welch,
 does or says, one is assumed to be some
 kind of a Communist or Communist dupe.
 Typical of the type of letters I am
 receiving is one from Mr. Thomas E.
 Woods, an attorney from Wichita, Kans.
 In his letter, he states:
 Wittingly or unwittingly you are serving
 the cause of communism.
 Madam President, I ask unanimous
 consent to have printed at this point in
 the RECORD, as parts of my remarks,
 the letter from. Mr. Woods, and my reply
 to his letter; an article entitled "Birch-
 ers 'Out of Focus' Catholic Paper Says,"
 published in the Washington Post for
 April 8, 1961, and based on an editorial
 appearing in the Pilot, the official organ
 of the Boston Roman Catholic arch-
 diocese; and an editorial entitled "The
 Againsters," published in the Oregonian,
 of Portland, Oreg., of April 5, 1961.
 There being no objection, the letters,
 article, and editorial were ordered to be
 printed in the RECORD, as follows:
 WICHITA, KANS., April 6, 1961.
 Hon. MILTON R. YOUNG,
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR YOUNG:  For many years it
 has been my privilege to receive the CoN-
 GRESSIONAL RECORD.   Over the years I have
 experienced humor, pleasure, displeasure, and
 the whole gantlet of emotions concerning
 the contents thereof. Of course I can appre-
 ciate that all Congressmen are politicians,
 and perhaps it Is sometimes with tongue in
 cheek that certain activities, letters, and arti-
 cles are included in the CONGRESSIONAL REC-
 ORD.  However, recently I am appalled at
 what I read.  I have reference to the items
 you have chosen to place  in the RECORD
 regarding the John Birch Society.
 Lest there be any misunderstanding let
 me say that I am a member of the John
 Birch  Society-and proud  to be one.  Of
 course I did not join the society until I had
 satisfied all my doubts regarding its purpose,
 scope, and the dedication of the members I
 knew.  Of course this is not a problem for
 anyone having the slightest interest in the
 organization either with a view of joining
 or out of curiosity.  We have open meetings
 and all of our material is available at the city
 library.
 Apparently it is the purpose of the society,
 its increasing membership, and effectiveness
 which is causing the press to rise in anguish
 and  question  everything  about  us.  Of
 course there is no such anguished beating
 of breasts over the continuing Communist
 success throughout  the world.  And  it is
 apparently due to our increasing effective-
 ness against Communist subversion that has
 caused  the  homegrown  Communists  to
 honor us with the proclamation that the
 John Birch Society must be destroyed at all
 costs.  Wittingly or  unwittingly you are
 serving the cause of communism.
 Please do not misunderstand me. It is
 not my purpose to attempt to prevent your
 criticism  of  the  society-provided it is
 valid.  That Is your privilege and mine as
 citizens of this great. country to express our
 opinions on any and all subjects, subject
 only to the legal rights of others.
 The misinformed and the uninformed are
 the greatest dangers that any society faces.
 With all themarvelous means of communi-
 cation, transportation, and the masses of
 information available to us today we must
 be even more vigilant.  And here is where
 I take Issue with you.  It is my opinion. that
 if you had a sincere interest in the society
 and it's purpose, you would not have adopted
 the course you have.
 Perhaps you are not aware of the fact
 that the article in Time magazine which
 you read into the RECORD on March 8, 1961,
 is largely based on an article in the Peoples
 World, dated February 25, 1961.  For your
 information the Peoples World is a publica-
 tion of the Communist Party U.S.A. as listed
 by the House Un-American Activities Com-
 mittee.
 Another facet to this whole matter that
 disturbs  me  is  the fact  that  among the
 items placed in the RECORD on. March 20,
 1961, is a sermon by John A. Crane, a Uni-
 tarian minister.  Coincidentally, a John A,
 Crane, who is also a Unitarian minister, is
 one of the signers of an appeal for the recog-
 nition of Red China in the Worker dated
 December 8,  1957,  at paragraph four and
 nine.  Do you not make any independent
 investigation of the items you read into the
 RECORD?
 The attacks on the society seem to be
 largely based on the fact that we are a secret
 organization, whatever that means.  There
 is no question about It-we are a private
 organization.   But  so  are the Knights of
 Columbus, Masons, Elks, etc.  Does this fact
 in and of itself militate against us?
 Another fact that seems to concern many
 is that Robert Welch has said or written
 many things about Eisenhower, Dulles, etc.
 I am not familiar with any of the material
 he has allegedly written for it is not a part
 of the socitey material.  Reference is made
 to a letter he wrote 4 years or so before the
 society was organized.  The contents of this
 letter, if it did exist, were never published
 until the society started to become effective
 and then our critics started the publication
 of  this  alleged letter.   Also for whatever
 it may be worth, you might examine into
 the  fact  that  the  ghostwriter  for  Eisen-
 hower's book was identified by Louis Budenz,
 Chambers, and others, as a Communist.        I
 do not imply that the general knew this at
 the time the book was written, but it is a
 fact nevertheless.
 Needless to say this letter will probably
 have little effect on your future activity,
 but as  a representative  of the  people it
 would seem that you might make a little
 investigation into the facts before you place
 articles such as you have in the RECORD.
 And even a little investigation would have
 given you all the information you were look-
 ing for-if that was the purpose of the in-
 sertion of the articles in the RECORD.
 Very truly yours,
 U.S. SENATE,
 COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE
 AND FORESTRY,
 Mr. THOMAS E. WOODS,
 Attorney at Law,
 Wichita, Kans.
 DEAR  MR.  WOODS:  This will acknowledge
 your letter of April 6.
 Your letter is typical of what is wrong
 with the John Birch Society.  Your leader,
 5267
 Robert Welch, is unwilling or does not have
 the decency to apologize for the Communist
 accusations  he  leveled  against President
 Eisenhower   and a host of  other patriotic
 American leaders.  If I were to make such
 charges as this, I certainly' would have been
 run out of the Republican Party and prob-
 ably out of my State.
 All through Mr. Welch's book, "The: Poli-
 tician," lie accuses President Eisenhower, his
 brother Milton Eisenhower, Allen Dulles, Di-
 rector of the CIA, and many others of being
 Communists  or  following  the  Communist
 line.  On page 267 of "The Politician", Mr.
 Welch states "that Milton Eisenhower is a
 Communist, and has been for 30 years." On
 page 210 he also says of Milton Eisenhower,
 "In my opinion the chances are very strong
 that Milton Eisenhower is actually Dwight
 Eisenhower's superior and boss within the
 Communist Party."
 One of the most damnable of gal his accu-
 sations  against President Eisenhower-and
 one that has not been carried in the news-
 papers-,appears on page 266 of "The Poli-
 tician:" "F'or the sake of honesty, however,
 I want to confess here my own convictions
 that Eisenhower's motivation is more ideo-
 logical than opportunistic.  Or, to put it
 bluntly, I personally think that he has been
 sympathetic to ultimate Communist aims,
 realistically willing to use Communist means
 to help them achieve their goals, knowingly
 accepting a. id abiding by Communist orders,
 and consciously serving the Communist con-
 spiracy, for all of his adult life."  If per-
 chance you should call yourself a Republican
 and are a member of the John Birch Society,
 whose  leader  has  made  such  outrageous
 charges and is unwilling to either retract
 them or apologize for them, then you are not
 my kind of a Republican.
 It is understandable why you folks in the
 organization are doing nothing about these
 charge.  You probably dont dare.  In your
 application  for  membership  in the  John
 Birch Society, you "agree that my member-
 ship may be revoked at anytime, by a duly
 appointed officer of the society, without the
 reason being stated, on refund of the pro
 rata part of my dues paid in advance."
 This means that Mr. Welch can remain
 the head of the John Birch Society so long
 as he desires, regardless of' his beliefs, ac-
 cusations, or  conduct.  If  any effort  ever
 should be made to depose Mr. Welch as head
 of this organization, the membership of such
 individuals,  chapters,  or even  the entire
 State organization could be revoked by Mr.
 Welch without the reason being stated.
 In  the February  29,  1960,  bulletin for
 March written by Robert Welch and sent to
 all members of the John Birch Society, and
 contained in the white book of the John
 Birch Society for 1960, there is this state-
 ment:  "Report to me all of the horrible
 things you will increasingly be hearing about
 your founder, if you think it is worthwhile,
 but put no credence in them, no matter the
 source from  which  they  come-or  resign
 from the society if you do."'  There is noth-
 ing very democratic about such a procedure.
 No wonc!er Mr. Welch calls democracy "a
 perennial fraud."
 You state that the organization is no more
 secret than the Knights of Columbus, Ma-
 sons, Elks, or others.  Many organizations
 refuse to give a list of their membership
 to any agency or other persons for various
 reasons,  but :mainly beca'txse they  do not
 like to have them become subjected to pro-
 miscuous mailings by oftentimes disreput-
 able sources.  You can go into any commu-
 nity                                                                                                                                    in        the United  States,   however, and
 contact the heads of these organizations and
 I think you will find that invariably they
 will tell you who their members are.  Cer-
 tainly no person who Is a member of the
 organizations you mentioned will ever deny
 such  membership.  Usually  they are  very
 proud of their membership.  They have no
 provision such as the one appearing in the

 be full exploration of the potential use
 of a wide variety of modern teaching
 aides and rapid teacher training pro-
 grams.
 PEACE CORPS
 The new Peace Corps can play a very
 important part in meeting the need for
 primary education in the newly devel-
 oping nations.
 Peace Corps members can perform
 vitally needed education functions, de-
 veloping and introducing new teaching
 systems, and training the teachers who
 will teach millions of new rural school-
 teachers.
 I believe that other countries have the
 right and the duty to develop their own
 education systems, according to their,
 own national needs and their own na-
 tional tional goals-without outside interfer-
 ence.
 But I also believe that American sup-
 port for education in these lands-
 whether through the Peace Corps or
 through such private efforts as the lit-
 eracy campaign of Dr. Frank Laubach-
 can make a powerful contribution to
 peaceful transformation and moderniza-
 tion in the emerging countries of Asia,
 Africa and Latin America.
 I am not suggesting that education
 for peace efforts must come only from
 our Federal Government.
 WIDE SUPPORT NEEDED
 On the contrary, I believe this effort
 must have the support of many differ-
 ent groups. We must enlist the support
 of the general public, the great educa-
 tional institutions of America, and the
 experience, the advice, and the support
 of American teachers and those who are
 experimenting  with  new   teaching
 techniques.
 The dramatic, enthusiastic response
 of the American people to the Peace
 Corps proposal gives convincing evidence
 that our people are eager to extend a
 helping hand in a spirit of brotherhood
 to conquer those ancient enemies-pov-
 erty, hunger, disease, ignorance,. and
 illiteracy.
 As the world-famous historian, Arnold
 Toynbee, points out:
 The  Peace Corps  can  give  America a
 chance to recapture her birthright-nothing
 less than the leadership of the world revo-
 lution that she started in April 1776 when
 her embattled farmers fired the shot heard
 round the world.
 PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
 In line with this spirit, a growing num-
 ber of responsible people believe that an
 opportunity for a significant new foreign
 policy initiative is to be found in a pro-
 gram for cooperation with other nations
 in the field of education.  The Presi-
 dent's recent message on foreign aid sup-
 ports this view. As the President noted:
 A large infusion of development capital
 cannot now be absorbed by many nations
 newly emerging from a wholly underdevel-
 oped condition.  Their primary need at first
 will be the development of human resources,
 education,  technical  assistance,  and  the
 groundwork of basic facilities and institu-
 tions necessary for further growth.
 To speed this development, to help es-
 tablish this groundwork, I am submit-
 ting a concurrent resolution designed to
 create an International Educational De-
 velopment Foundation.
 VALUE OF PROGRAM
 Such a program for educational co-
 operation with other countries through
 this foundation would have several im-
 portant values.
 First, it would help restore the image
 of America with respect for intellectual
 and cultural values.  It would symbolize
 our dedication to the development of the
 individual human personality.
 Second, newly emerging independent
 nations will see tangible symbols of
 friendship  and  progress,  symbols of
 America's goodwill, in the schools, uni-
 versities,  libraries  and  laboratories,
 which we help establish through this
 foundation.
 Third, the importance of educational
 development to longrun economic de-
 velopment is increasingly clear.     The
 lack of literate, educated manpower is a
 major obstacle to effective use of avail-
 able capital and technology in the
 emerging underdeveloped nations.
 And fourth, a major effort to speed
 international educational development
 can help to counteract and overcome the
 lure of rapid progress in education within
 the Sino-Soviet Communist world. Edu-
 cational development in the free world is
 essential to create the conditions for
 progress and to maintain the opportuni-
 ties for freedom.
 Thus, educational development in the
 free world will serve our national in-
 terests and the objectives of our foreign
 policy.  Furthermore, it serves deeper
 spiritual  purposes.   It  indicates  the
 American belief in universal education as
 a fundamental condition of personal
 liberty, representative government, and
 a democratic way of life.
 The concurrent resolution which I am
 submitting today is a statement of in-
 tention that our Government should
 launch a full-scale program of coopera-
 tion with other nations to develop their
 educational resources.
 FOOD FOR PEACE AID
 This resolution also expresses the hope
 that suitable organizational machinery
 will be established to assure vigorous
 leadership and coordination for interna-
 tional educational activities by our Gov-
 ernment as well as help and support for
 private efforts in the field of interna-
 tional education.
 As to financing educational coopera-
 tion with other countries, we should look
 to the great pool of local foreign cur-
 rencies-more than $2 billion-owned or
 controlled by the United States and ac-
 cumulated largely through sales of agri-
 cultural surpluses under Public Law 480.
 I am convinced that our food for peace
 program can furnish sound, continuing
 financing procedures for American par-
 ticipation in this education-for-peace
 program.
 AMERICA'S OPPORTUNITY
 The revolution of rising expectations
 is under way.                                     We have an opportunity
 to help guide this revolution in the
 emerging nations of Asia, Africa, and
 Latin America into the paths of peaceful
 progress which enhance personal free-
 5265
 dom and human dignity. I am confident
 that America will rise to  this op-
 portunity.
 Madam President, I submit my educa
 tion-for-peace concurrent resolution for
 appropriate reference.
 The concurrent resolution (S. Con.
 Res. 19) submitted by Mr. HUMPHREY,
 was referred to the Committee on For-
 eign Relations, as follows:
 Whereas the American people believe that
 sound education is a fundamental condition
 of personal liberty, representative govern-
 ment and a democratic way of life; and
 Whereas, in an age of science and tech-
 nology, education, especially higher educa-
 tion, is essential to social progress; and
 Whereas education and training of talented
 individuals is indispensable to the economic
 development  of  underdeveloped  countries,
 whose chief resource is human beings; and
 Whereas  education  and  truth,  its vital
 spirit, are powerful instruments of interna-
 tional understanding and peace; and
 Whereas the    exchange of  students and
 teachers under the Fulbright and Smith-
 Mundt Acts has demonstrated the value of
 international   cooperation  in educational
 matters to friendly relations between the
 United  States          and  other countries: Now,
 therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
 resentatives concurring), That it  shall  be
 the policy of the United States to assist other
 nations to establish, improve, and develop
 their educational systems, to assist in bring-
 ing the benefits of education to all their
 citizens, and to encourage and help make
 possible  higher  education  and  advanced
 training for deserving students;  and be it
 further
 Resolved, That the United States Congress
 recognizes and affirms the inalienable right
 of other nations to establish their educa-
 tional institutions in accordance with their
 own national aspirations and cultural herit-
 age, and pledges itself to adopt suitable
 measures to assist other nations which seek
 the aid of the United States to establish or
 improve their educational systems  accord-
 ing to their own values and traditions; and
 be it further
 Resolved, That the Congress hereby en-
 courages the enlistment of all appropriate
 agencies for this purpose, including United
 States educational institutions, corporations,
 foundations, and other private organizations,
 departments and agencies of United States
 Government, and the United Nations Organi-
 zation and its specialized agencies; and, more
 specifically, be it further
 Resolved, That the United States stands
 ready-
 (1) to assist other nations in the efforts
 they are making to improve their own edu-
 cational system by enabling them to train
 teachers  and instructors  and  by assisting
 them to obtain teachers and instructors from
 other countries; by helping them to obtain
 books, materials and equipment essential to
 education, training, and research; by assist-
 ing them to establish, enlarge, or alter phys-
 ical facilities for education, training, and
 research; by encouraging and assisting them
 to obtain expert guidance with respect to
 modern methods of educational development
 and administration;
 (2) to encourage and support measures to
 bring the benefits of higher education and
 advanced training within the reach of quali-
 fied and deserving students of other coun-
 tries without regard to their personal eco-
 nomic condition;
 (3) to promote mutual assistance among
 nations in matters of education, training,
 and research;
 (4) to help remove barriers to, and to en-
 courage and support, the free exchange of

 educational, scientific, and cultural mate-
 rials, and the interchange among nations of
 students, teachers, and persons of special
 skills and learning; and be it further
 Resolved, That it is the sense of the Con-
 gress that there should be established in the
 executive branch of the Government an In-
 ternational Educational Development Foun-
 dation, or other suitable organizational en-
 tity, with sufficient stature and independent
 authority to assure a vigorous program to
 accomplish the purposes of this resolution
 and to coordinate the international educa-
 tional activities of the United States Gov-
 ernment, and the Congress declares its will-
 ingness to provide suitable financing for the
 accomplishment of this program, including
 but not limited to provisions for the use of
 foreign currencies available to the United
 States for such purposes.

 TE JOHN BIRCH SOCIETY
 Mr. M:cGEE.  Madam President,  I
 ish to refer to a news-ticker item in
 regard to a speech delivered last night,
 in Los Angeles, by Robert Welch, of the
 John ]3irch Society.  According to the
 news ticker, Mr. Welch said in the
 course of that speech:
 Protestant ministers do not become Com-
 munists--but   Communists   do   become
 Protestant ministers.
 Madam. President, that is another kind
 of reckless slur and smear that this
 man and the spokesmen for this slurring
 society are visiting upon various re-
 spectable sentiments of American so-
 ciety.  Nothing could be more ridiculous
 than to believe that the students of
 theology, the ministers of the Gospel,
 could be handmaidens of the cause of
 the Communists, who believe in any-
 thin.:; but God; arid I suggest that
 nothing could suit the Communists pur-
 pose more completely than the sugges-
 tion that the Protestant ministry is be-
 ing infiltrated by communism.
 Furthermore, I raise serious question
 about the motives of Mr. Welch and
 whatever inspires those who join his
 society, if they attack with that kind of
 invective the segments of our own com-
 munities.
 I believe it is time that we bring
 squarely to the mat the issues between
 our society and these twisted, distorted,
 sick people who seek to charge with con-
 spiracy all who differ with them.
 These people are afraid of trusting
 others, they are afraid of America, and
 they are afraid of freedom; and for that
 reason they seek to pull down those
 around them by using the smear and the
 invective in which DIMr. Welch has once
 again indulged in the course of his
 speech. in Los Angeles.
 I ask unanimous consent that the item
 from the news ticker be printed at this
 point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the item
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 Los ANGELES.-Robert Welch, founder of
 the John Birch Society, says:
 "Protestant ministers do not become Com-
 munists--but   Communists   do   become
 Protestant ministers."
 He told a capacity audience of 6,000 at the
 Shri:o.e  Auditorium  last night that Com-
 munists and their sympathizers  are infil-
 trating the Protestant. ministry--because it
 is the last place where Americans would ex-
 pect to find them.  However, he added:

 bellied politicians, pacifist preachers, addle-
 pated professors and all the rest of that sorry
 claque which responds so supinely to de-
 mands of the enemy.
 Your statement * * * tops all efforts of
 those seeking to curry Kremlin favor through
 utterances of puerile pettishness and pturid
 pettifoggery. Moreover, you display abysmal
 ignorance of the form and nature of the
 Federal Government and the Constitution
 which it operates. * *
 By your asinine remarks you have shamed
 the loyal citizens of Wisconsin, and most
 particularly the citizens of the district who
 elected you to represent them.  I am sure
 that only a tiny fraction of them wish to be
 represented by a man who rushes too quickly
 to obey Communists pleasure that he does
 not stop to take time to read the Constitu-
 tion, and who is willing to vilify those of
 this constituents and all other Americans
 who seek to repeal the advance of our enemy,
 the Communist hordes.
 Very sincerely,
 VERNE P. KAUR.
 I have  attempted to outline, Mr.
 Speaker, what I consider to be the seven
 deadly parallels between the Nazi move-
 ment and the John Birch Society. I have
 shown that:
 First, both detest the principles and
 institutions of democracy;
 Second, both seek to destroy the es-
 tablished government, by fraud if pos-
 sible, by force if necessary;
 Third, both espouse the Fuehrerprin-
 zip, whereby total control is exercised by
 the leader;
 Fourth, both rely for their primary
 organization on a small elite corps of
 zealots;
 Fifth, both use front organizations to
 augment their strength with persons in-
 terested in limited parts of their pro-
 gram but who could not swallow the
 whole thing;
 Sixth, both draw significant support
 from wealthy industrialists who should
 know better; and
 Seventh, both profess militant anti-
 communism, but they adopt with relish
 the dirty methods of the Communists.
 Let me be very clear. I would not for
 one moment restrict in any way the right
 of the John Birch Society to its freedom
 of speech.  Nor would I allow the plot-
 ting of these pipsqueak Hitlers to make
 us hysterical.
 But the Birch  Society  cannot be
 laughed out of existence nor ignored out
 of existence.  Its organized propaganda
 must be challenged, fairly and vigor-
 ously, wherever it appears.
 For&1MgQJO kfi~bRBPq4p
 I April 12
 Inasmuch as it appears you are anti-anti-
 Communist, the natural conclusion is that
 you  are  pro-Communist     and  a  Soviet
 sympathizer.
 Part of our activities are those of keeping
 files on such people in case of an attack on
 this country by the Soviet; a list of po-
 tentially                         dangerous people  who may col-
 laborate with the enemy.
 With the above in mind we would ap-
 preciate a statement of your position if
 you care to make it.  Otherwise the classi-
 fication will be made on the basis of the
 data we have.
 Yours very truly,
 GEO. E.  DEATHERAGE,
 Director.

 DEAR SIR: I would like to write this letter
 concerning your stand on the John Birch
 Society.  Many  people  have said we are
 subversive. We will be subversive when a
 dog becomes president.  We are fighting for
 the principles that made our country great.
 We have done this in the past and will do
 it in the future.
 Several people have Mr. Welch called Eisen-
 hower a Communist.  In all the official pub-
 lications I have received he has never said
 this.  He has said the last three presidents
 were deceived by the Communists.  In clos-
 ing I would like to assure you we are a
 patriotic  group,  doing things that  would
 help our country.  Thank you.
 Sincerely,
 LEE SHIVLEY, Jr.
 MILWAUKEE, WIS.
 Representative HENRY S. REUSS,
 Congressman, Fifth Congressional District,
 State of Wisconsin, Washington, D.C.
 Mr. REUSS: As one of your constituents,
 let me say that I am not a member of the
 John Birch Society, but I heartily endorse
 its program.  Maybe a verbal war such as
 they are wajing  [sic]  will serve to make
 people aware of what really has downgraded
 America in the last half century.  President
 Wilson (at the suggestion of'Paul Warburg,
 who was probably a Communist) started the
 decline of this country's position by estab-
 lishing the Federal Reserve which took the
 right to coin the peoples' money away from
 the people  (their representatives in Con-
 gress), and gave that right to a private cor-
 poration which was controlled by foreigners.
 Paul Warburg was an Eastern European.
 If we in this country ever have a run on
 the banks, I will do my best to gather all the
 1$ bills [sic] that I can, because they are
 silver certificates with silver to back them
 up.  Federal Reserve money is a figment of
 someone's  imagination,  because  nothing
 exists to back it up except "the credit of the
 United States" upon which a bunch of for-
 iegners [sic] could foreclose (and our own
 laws would protect them).
 I heartily urge the repeal of our Federal
 income tax and urge the restoration of gov-
 ernment  under  our Constitution in  fact,
 instead of just supposedly.

 MY DEAR MR. REUSS: Dismal failure of the
 Kremlin-motivated project for destruction of
 HCUAA  (often improperly  designated  as
 HUAC) has been followed by frenzied efforts
 to deactivate one of the House committee's
 most sturdy and effective supporters, The
 John Birch Society.
 Zany statements besmirching the society
 and its founder have gushed forth in dizzy
 torrents from pens and tongues of Coman-
 chean commentators, ignoble idietors, pot-
 MICHIGAN'S  REPUBLICAN  PARTY
 NOT QUITE DESTITUTE
 The SPEAKER.  Under previous or-
 der of the House, the gentleman from
 Michigan [Mr. HOFFMAN] is recognized
 for 5 minutes.
 Mr. HOFFMAN   of  Michigan.  Mr.
 Speaker, in Sunday's issue of the De-
 troit Free Press, Judd Arnett recalls he
 "wrote a piece pointing out the Demo-
 cratic Party of Michigan is loaded with
 'charmers'," thus leaving the impres-
 sion that, to win an election, Republi-
 cans of Michigan must come up with
 candidates who have "charm."
 He further comments that, "Once
 again the Republicans have snatched
 defeat out of the jaws of victory."
 Michigan taxpayers do retail the
 Democrats' chief charmer, Soapy Wil-
 liams, who more recently has been hold-
 ing forth in Africa. Nor have they for-
 gotten that, while Soapy was a real
 charmer, Walter Reuther  and Emil
 Mazey, using union money illegally, did
 finally leave Michigan bankrupt, many
 unemployed, and several so-called dis-
 tressed areas.
 It is quite true that Republicans in
 Michigan, defeated at several elections,
 have lost control of the State and that,
 under the leadership and direction of
 Soapy, and the policies of Reuther and
 Mazey and their political union aides.,
 we have unemployment and distressed
 areas, and the Democrats are now beg-
 ging,the taxpayers to bail them out.
 However, Republicans were defeated,
 Democrats won, not necessarily because
 of the charmers, but because, lacking in
 political honesty many candidates prom-
 ised more for nothing than did the Re-
 publicans who, strange as it may be in
 this day and age, seemed to have a sense
 of honesty and responsibility.
 Unfortunately, Michigan's voters are
 now learning the hard way and ulti-
 mately will accept the truth that even
 rich as is Michigan, it cannot forever
 yield to the demands of any special pres-
 sure group without bringing hardship to
 the majority.
 Fortunately, the Republican Party not
 only has a few charmers of its own, but,
 in addition to the charm, these gentle-
 men have ability, integrity, and a reali-
 zation of their responsibility to all of the
 poeple of the State, wear no man's collar,
 serve exclusively no particular interest,
 have in mind the welfare of the State as
 a whole.
 The Free Press prints a likeness of one
 of Michigan's outstanding charmers who
 possesses in ample measure the qualities
 which go into the makeup of a statesman
 and a patriot, our colleague from the
 Fifth District, JERRY FORD, who, because
 of his outstanding ability and industry,
 has won the respect and admiration of
 House Members.
 Arnett's piece reads:
 [From the Detroit Free Press, Apr. 9, 19611
 GOP  GLAMOR
 A few days ago I wrote a piece pointing
 out the Democratic Party of Michigan is
 loaded with "charmers," not the least of
 whom are Gov. John Swainson, Senator PHIL
 HART   and  Highway  Commissioner  John
 Mackie.
 It was suggested that the Republicans had
 better groom a few "glamor boys" if they
 want to get back into serious contention.
 (What was it someone said after Monday's
 election?  "Once again the Republicans have
 snatched   defeat  out of the  jaws of  vic-
 tory * + + ?)
 Anyhow, since then there have been letters
 and calls, with rather indignant partisans
 contending that the Grand Old Party already
 has  some  handsome,  uppen    atem    young
 stalwarts.
 Advanced were such names as Thomas B.
 Adams, the Detroit advertising executive;
 Jack McDonald, elected supervisor of Med-
 ford Township; and John S. Pingel, also of
 the world of advertising, who ran well but
 fell short of election to the Michigan State
 University Board of Trustees.
 Perhaps  significantly,  every  caller  and
 writer mentiond one other Republican, Rep-
 resentative JERRY FORD of the Grand Rapids
 district.

 keep strict and careful control on what
 every chapter is doing, and even every mem-
 ber of every chapter so far as the effective
 work of the John. Birch Society is concerned
 ("Blue Book," p. 165).
 Continuous control is necessary ac-
 cording to Welch because:
 The biggest of all organizational mistakes
 is to set up a local group for some contin-
 uing purpose, exhort them to do a good job,
 and then leave them alone to do It ("Blue
 Book," p. 86).
 Welch makes it abundantly clear that
 the  "information" received  by local
 chapters, the orders that they will be
 required to act upon, and the views that
 they will be expected to express, will all
 reflect the views of the leader:
 Only if the members of these groups de-
 clared allegiance to, came to feel an un-
 shakable  loyalty  for,  and  thus  accepted
 direction from, a dynamic personal leader;
 only under  these conditions  would there
 be any possibility of the members of these
 groups, and of all other Americans who feel
 basically as they do, supplying what is
 needed ("Blue Book," pp. 115-116).
 4. THEY BOTH RELY FOR THEM PRIMARY ORGAN-
 IZATION ON A SMALL ELITE CORPS OF ZEALOTS
 In "Mein Karnpf," book 2, chapter 11,
 Hitler states that propaganda attempts
 to influence a whole people, while the
 party organization is designed to incor-
 porate only a small portion of the more
 militant members of the total public.
 He distinguishes between the "radical
 people" who were capable of accepting
 the rigorous demands of membership in
 the party, and the thousands of sym-
 pathizers who were "too cowardly" to
 make the required sacrifices.
 Hitler's belief that a minority com-
 prised the elite formation of the party
 organization, is paralleled by Welch in
 his discussions in the Blue Book of the
 Birch Society's membership:
 And while there will be some of us, an
 increasing number, but still a small minor-
 ity, who will actually be giving practically
 the whole of our lives to this cause, we
 neither ask nor expect so much from the
 vast majority of our members.  I think that
 a million members is all we would want, at
 least in the United States.    For we need
 disciplined pullers at the oars, and not pas-
 sengers in the boat ("Blue Book," pp. 165,
 166).
 Welch also emphasizes the demands
 that will be made on members:
 Let me point out and emphasize that we
 are expecting far more work and dedication,
 and far more sacrifice of other interests, on
 the part of those who do become members
 of the John Birch Society, than you ever
 thought of giving to any other organization
 whcih you joined or even considered joining
 ("Blue Book," p. 166).
 8. THEY  BOTH USE FRONT  ORGANIZATIONS TO
 INVOLVE  PERSONS  INTERESTED  IN  LIMITED
 PARTS OF THEIR PROGRAM, BUT WHO COULD
 NOT SWALLOW THE WHOLE THING
 One of the unique organizational de-
 vices of the Nazi movement was the
 "front" organization. Hitler discovered
 the value of creating such "fronts,"
 realizing that they could serve a dual
 purpose.  They provided a mechanism
 through which the Nazi movement could
 attract  sympathizers    and  supporters
 among the public, and at the same time,
 limit the number of active, participat-
 ing members.  Secondly, they acted as
 a buffer between the public and the
 membership, protecting the party itself
 from attack, and at the same time dis-
 seminating its views.
 Welch also makes use of front organi-
 zations i
 We would organize fronts-little fronts,
 big fronts,  temporary fronts,  permanent
 fronts, all kinds of fronts. One of the great-
 est weaknesses and mistakes on the conser-
 vative side has been that almost all of the
 organizations, real ones or just letterhead
 outfits, have been put together for general
 purposes.  The Communists have been far
 smarter.  They would never think of setting
 up publicly, for instance, a committee to
 promote communism.
 It Is too general.  Yet we have several
 leagues against communism, and others just
 as vague in the fronts they present.
 The most effective fronts, on either side,
 are ad hoc committees, aimed to accom-
 plish, or at least publicize, one particular
 purpose.
 Of course fronts alone aren't going to
 stop the Communists either.  But enough
 of then:[ being constantly organized-for
 this purpose, that purpose, and every kind
 of purpose-some fading out and new ones
 coming an all of the time, can bother the
 Communists, can occasionally put them on
 the defensive, can bring more of the unin-
 formed and previously indifferent but patri-
 otic Americans into the fight, and can help
 our cause in many ways.  Again, let me try
 to make my point clearer, and to make it
 more easily, by suggesting a few examples.
 With such fronts as "A Petition To Im-
 peach Earl Warren" (and I think we could
 get the names of a hundred outstanding
 leaders from the South and many from the
 North on the letterhead right now) ; a "Com-
 mittee To Investigate Communist Influences
 At Vassar College" (headed by Vassar gradu-
 ates, of Course); and "Women Against Labor
 Union Hoodlumism" (which would pick up
 the individual stories of husbands injured,
 cars wrecked, houses damaged, families ter-
 rified, in the strike at Kohler and others
 like it, tell those stories from the women's
 point of view and show the suffering they
 caused wives and mothers); with these and
 dozens of new fronts popping up to attack
 the Communists-or persons, institutions,
 and movements giving aid and comfort to
 the Communists---we can certainly keep this
 whole front operation from being so one-
 sided, as it has been.  We can stop letting
 the Communists have the whole effective use
 of this weapon practically by default, and
 what's more, we can use the noise and tur-
 moil to help to wake up a lot of people to
 the fact that there is a deadly fight going
 on of which they had been blissfully un-
 aware ("Blue Book," pp. 86-91.)
 8. THEY   BOTH  DRAW   SIGNIFICANT   SUPPORT
 FROM VVEALTHY INDUSTRIALISTS WHO SHOULD
 KNOW BETTER
 Hitler's principal sources of funds for
 his drive to power in the period 1930-33
 were such leadingindustrialists as Fritz
 Thyssen of steel, Emil Kirdorf of coal,
 Von Schnitzler of the chemical industry,
 and Von- Schroeder of banking.
 Similarly playing on fears of com-
 munism, the Birch Society has studded
 its ranks with corporation presidents,
 board chairmen, and two past presidents
 of the National Association of Manufac-
 turers.  To its credit, the National As-
 sociation of Manufacturers has officially
 repudiated the Birch Society.
 7. THEY BOTH  PROFESS  MILITANT  ANTICOM-
 MUNISSLI, BUT THEY ADOPT WITH RELISH THE
 DIRTY METHODS  OF THE COMMUNISTS
 In his drive to attain power in Ger-
 many Hitler followed a policy that the
 end justifies the means. The big lie, the
 use of scrapegoats, smear campaigns,
 witch hunts, and total disregard - for
 fair play were synonymous with nazism.
 So it is with the Birch Society mem-
 bers are "to play rough":
 It isn't numbers we have to worry about in
 this connection, but the courage on the part
 of our followers to stick their necks out and
 play rough--the same as the Communists
 do all of the time--and that courage will
 come too with gathering strength  ("Blue
 Book," p. !)7).
 Letterwriting is encouraged:
 Letterwriti:ng of a different order of planned
 Continuity   and  volume   than anything
 attempted before--except o:n a somewhat
 more  sporadic  scale by  the Communists
 themselves--letterwriting of the kind that
 builds opinion exactly the way single grains
 of sand build a whole barricade; this is only
 one  but a still important one, of the dis-
 ciplined activities by which we would keep
 a million men working eve:ry day, adding
 small increments of strength to the anti-
 Communist ride, for every bit of the time
 and energj they could devote to the cause
 ("Blue Book," p. 87).
 The Communists boast that they can now
 land 50,000 individually written letters in
 Washington, on either side of any subject,
 within 72 hours.  Actually that is not too
 startling  an  accomplishment.   We  could
 make it look like peanuts, with the million
 truly  dedicated and  controlled supporters
 who    constitute the   hypothesis-though
 merely a hypothesis-of this part of this
 discussion.  There should be a continuous
 overwhelming flood of letters, not just to
 legislators or the executive departments in
 Washington, but to newspaper editors, tele-
 vision and radio sponsors,  educators, lec-
 turers,  State  :Legislators  and  politicians,
 foundation heads and everybody else whose
 opinions, actions, and decisions count for
 anything in the ultimate total actions and
 decisions.   Such an  outpouring  of  mall
 would give more courage to a lot of people
 who would prefer to be more clearly on our
 side,  and   would at  least slow down  the
 brazen advance of some of those on the other
 side.  Let me give you an illustration.
 A few months ago United Airlines started
 a movement, which could have  had  tre-
 mendous                                                                                                                                               psychological  and  propaganda
 value for the internationalist leftwingers, by
 putting the Insignia of the 'United Nations
 on their planes, with the words "We believe"
 under the Insignia. And In this case a spon-
 taneous letterwriting campaign,  with the
 only  organization  or  inspiration  of  the
 campaign coming without any coordination
 whatsoever    from  a  few  small rightwing
 groups and individuals, was able to force
 United Airlines to back down completely
 and publicly admit that they had made a
 mistake.   This in itself would have been
 significant enough, but there was one angle
 to it, completely unpublicized, which made
 the results more striking.   This was that
 United Airlines backed down, and took the
 U.N. Insignia off their planes, despite the
 fact that Paul Hoffman, Gardiner Cowles,
 and Eric Johnston are all members of United
 Airlines board of directors.  This shows what
 letterwriting can do, even against deter-
 mined  and  entrenched  opposition  ("Blue
 Book," pp. 94-85).
 Since making public my criticism of
 the Birch Society, I have been receiving
 a swarm of letters which bear the ear-
 marks of society tactics.  For example:

 Since Robert Welch demands that his
 members "accept direction from their
 leader"-`Blue Book," page 116-it is
 hard to see how the word from Welch can
 be anything other than John Birch So-
 the idea of a majority, but upon the idea
 of a single personality.
 During the years that followed he bru-
 tally  attacked  democracy  and  the
 Weimar Republic in general, and the
 Republic's office holders in particular.
 Although the antidemocratic ideas
 propounded by the Birch Society are
 somewhat obscured by its fervent and
 vitriolic attacks on individuals who are
 alleged to be Communists, its philosophy,
 as recorded in the speech delivered by
 its founder Robert Welch, Jr., in In-
 dianapolis in 1958, parrots Hitler's dis-
 dain for the principles and institutions
 of democracy:
 A Republican form of government
 lends itself too readily to infiltration, dis-
 tortion, and disruption.  And democracy, of
 course,  is merely  a  deceptive  phrase,  a
 weapon of demagoguery, and a perennial
 fraud ("Blue Book," p. 159).
 Welch aims his attack not only at the
 Government in general, but at all three
 of its branches and the individuals in
 them.
 First. Of the Supreme Court he says:
 It is now so strongly and almost completely
 under Communist influence that it shatters
 its own precedents and rips gaping holes in
 our Constitution in order to favor Com-
 munist purposes ("Politician," pp. 272-273).
 And, of course, the drive to impeach
 Chief Justice Warren is one of the So-
 ciety's main aims.
 Second. Of the Congress Welch says:
 The legislative branch of our Government
 has been-brought so far in line (with Com-
 munist objectives)  that it  will ratify  an
 Austrian peace treaty without debate, ap-
 prove the appointment of a Zellerbach with-
 out a question, and listen to the speech of a
 Sukarno with applause ("Politician," p. 272).
 Third. Of  the executive branch,
 Welch says:
 The executive department of our Govern-
 ment * * * has become * * * to          a large
 extent, an active agency for the promotion
 of Communist aims ("Politician," p. 273).
 He called former President Eisenhower
 an agent of the Communist Party and
 accuses him of being guilty of treason:
 My firm belief that Dwight Eisenhower is
 a dedicated, conscious agent of the Commu-
 nist conspiracy is based upon an accumula-
 tion of detailed evidence so extensive and so
 palpable that it seems to me to put this
 conviction  beyond  any  reasonable doubt
 ("Politician," p. 267).
 There is only one possible word to de-
 scribe his purposes and actions.  That word
 is "treason" ("Politician," p. 210).
 Further:
 ciety doctrine.
 2.  BOTH  SEEK TO DESTROY
 GOVERNMENT,  BY  FRAUD
 FORCE IF NECESSARY
 THE  ESTABLISHED
 IF  POSSIBLE, BY
 While still in prison in 1924, Hitler
 said:
 When I resume active work it will be
 necessary to pursue a new policy.                                             Instead
 of working to achieve power by armed coup,
 we shall have to hold our noses and enter
 the Reichstag  against the  Catholic                                              and
 Marxist deputies.  If outvoting them takes
 longer than outshooting them, at least the
 result will be guaranteed by their own con-
 stitution.  Any lawful process is slow * * *.
 Sooner or later we shall have a majority-
 and after that, Germany.
 However, on February 27, 1925, after
 identifying the republican regime as the
 enemy to be defeated, he shouted:
 To this struggle of ours there are only two
 possible issues: either the enemy passes over
 our bodies or we pass over theirs (William
 L. Shirer, "The Rise and Fall of the Third
 Reich," p. 119).
 Like Hitler, the Birch Society recog-
 nizes the convenience of seizing power
 through established constitutional pro-
 cedure:
 We would put our weight into the politi-
 cal scales in this country just as fast and
 far as we could.  For unless we can even-
 tually, and in time, reverse by political ac-
 tion the gradual surrender of the United
 States to communism, the ultimate alterna-
 tive of reversal by military uprising is fear-
 ful to contemplate ("Blue Book," p. 111).
 I would like to emphasize this point,
 Mr. Speaker.  it is among the views of
 this organization that a change in the
 existing order by military uprising is an
 acceptable-even if fearful-alternative.
 Fortunately, the war that the Birch-
 ites are fighting, is, as they see it,
 "still political and educational rather
 than military"-"Blue Book" page 76-
 but in appraising the danger which this
 society presents we must consider what
 they view as the immediate manifesta-
 tions of the "surrender of the United
 States to communism": social security,
 foreign aid, income taxes, American
 participation in the United Nations and
 in the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
 tion.  These are the things which the
 Birch Society seeks to reverse.  Since
 such a reversal by conventional politi-
 cal action seems most unlikely, how long
 must we wait for the "reversal by mili-
 tary uprising" which they accept as
 "the ultimate alternative"?
 The Birch Society might also be de-
 scribed, as was the Nazi Party, as a "se-
 cret society established in broad day-
 light." Unlike the traditional secret so-
 ciety which operated in a wholly con-
 The Communists are so firmly entrenched
 by now, that even if Eisenhower disappeared
 from  the  scene  all  the  momentum  and
 strength of the forces we have .seen at work
 would still have to be overcome. * * * The
 firm grip on our Government of the forces
 that have  worked  through Eisenhower  is
 more  important   than  Eisenhower himself
 ("Politician," p. 266).
 There has been some disposition for
 the leaders of the Birch Society to dis-
 avow these statements of Welch on the
 ground that they were in a private
 "letter."  I have seen the "letter," Mr.
 Speaker.  It is a black, paperbound,

 ties have not been revealed. The society
 does not disclose the size of its total
 membership.   It  closely  guards  the
 names of its members. It does not make
 public the source or the extent of its
 financial support. It does not reveal how
 its funds are used.  All of the ritual of
 the secret society is observed, even
 though the necessity for secrecy is ob-
 viated by the fact that their "subver-
 sive" purpose is openly proclaimed:
 Our determination to overthrow an en-
 trenched tyranny is the very stuff of which
 revolutions are made ("Blue Book," p. 169).
 3. BOTH ESPOUSE THE FUEHRERPRINZIP, WHERE-
 BY  TOTAL  CONTROL  IS  EXERCISED  BY  THE
 LEADER
 Hitler adopted the principle that the
 will of the leader is law, stating:
 I alone lead the movement and no one
 can impose conditions on me so long as I
 personally bear the responsibility for every-
 thing that occurs in the movement.
 Welch expresses similar views in the
 Blue Book where he states:
 The men who join the Birch Society * *
 will be doing so primarily because they be-
 lieve in me and what I am doing and are
 willing to accept my leadership anyway.
 Whenever that loyalty ceases to be sufficient
 to keep some fragment in line, we are not
 going to be in the position of having the
 society's work weakened by raging debates.
 We are not going to have factions develop-
 ing on the two-sides-to-every question theme
 ("Blue Book," p. 161).
 The intricate party organization that
 Hitler built consisted in party chapters
 corresponding to the political and geo-
 graphic subdivisions of Germany, with
 chapter leaders appointed by and wholly
 responsible to Hitler himself.
 The actual structure of the Birch
 Society closely parallels this.  Although
 in the "Blue Book," Welch suggests that
 the organization which he proposes to
 establish, will be of "an entirely different
 nature from anything that the word
 [organization] might bring to mind"-
 "Blue Book," page 157-as soon as he be-
 gins to describe the structure of this
 wholly "different" organization it be-
 comes very clear that, while it is certainly
 unlike any organization existing in the
 pluralistic society of f. democratic coun-
 try, it is not unlike the complex network
 of organizations that brought Adolf
 Hitler into power.
 As set up by Welch :
 The John Birch Society will function al-
 most entirely through small local chapters,
 usually of from 10 to 20 dedicated patriots,
 although some  chapters. may occasionally,
 and for a while, be larger.  Each will have
 a chapter leader, appointed by headquarters,
 which is in Belmont, Mass., or appointed
 through officers of the society, in the field,
 who have themselves been duly appointed by

 viled by some members of this organiza-
 tion.
 There are many good but mistaken
 people who belong to the John Birch
 Society, but there are some others who
 are neither good nor mistaken, and they
 are its leaders.  Speaking for myself, I
 suggest to the Senate that a proper func-
 tion of the Senate Government Opera-
 tions Committee would be to call before
 it Mr. Welch of Massachusetts and ask
 him the basis upon which he makes
 these fantastic charges. Since he will be
 unable to document them, he should be
 made to apologize in public not alone to
 Eisenhower, not alone to Warren, but
 also to the people of the country.
 Mr. YOUNG of North Dakota.  Mr.
 President, I deeply appreciate the kind
 comments concerning me made by the
 distinguished Senator from Connecticut
 with respect to the John Birch Society
 and charges which have been leveled
 against me by its members.
 I have been the subject of a barrage of
 letters written to every newspaper in my
 State which will carry them, which
 insinuate, at times, that I may be op-
 posed to any movement which would
 contain communism and which charge
 me with all manner of things.
 I believe that in my State the great
 majority of the members of the society
 are very good people, but they have been
 unaware of the type of person they have
 as a leader and the accusations he has
 been making. No one knows for sure ex-
 actly who are the members of the so-
 ciety; that is one of the difficult things
 in dealing with the organization.  I do
 not know of more than a half dozen
 people in my State who will admit they
 belong to the organization.
 Those who are members of the organi-
 zation, for the most part, are very fine
 people. I believe they are honestly and
 sincerely trying to. combat communism,
 and that one day they will repudiate the
 charges made by their leader, Robert
 Welch, against President Eisenhower and
 other fine patriotic citizens and leaders
 of our Nation.
 HURRICANE MESA
 Mr. BENNETT.    Mr. President, in the
 special message on the defense budget
 which President Kennedy submitted to
 the Congress Tuesday, the President an-
 nounced that he had directed the Sec-
 retary of Defense to take steps to inacti-
 vate and discontinue 21 oversea bases
 and 52 military installations in the
 United States, thought by the new ad-
 ministration to be excess to the defense
 needs of our country.  Although not on
 the official list, one of the facilities to
 be closed by the Kennedy administra-
 tion is the Hurricane supersonic re-
 search site, located at Hurricane, Utah.
 This is an Air Force installation op-
 erated under contract by the Coleman
 Engineering Co., Inc., of Torrance, Calif.
 At this site, high speed rocket sled tests
 and aircraft crew escape systems are
 tested under the direction of the Air
 Force Flight Test Center, Air Research
 Development Command, Edwards Air
 Force Base, Calif.
 The Hurricane test track is a com-
 paratively new installation, first acti-
 vated in 1954 and formerly referred to
 by the Air Force as Project Smart. The
 track is unique in many ways.  It is lo-
 cated on a high plateau in southwestern
 Utah near Zion National Park and ap-
 proximately 75 miles north of Grand
 Canyon National Park.  HSRS provides
 the only known facility in the world on
 which a test item can be guided at su-
 personic speed over a 12,000-foot track,
 launched from a precipice 1,500 feet
 above the surrounding terrain, and then
 closely observed through a relatively
 horizontal free-flight path.  The Air
 Force has two other test tracks, one at
 Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., and one
 at Holloman Air Force Base, N. Mex.,
 and the Navy operates a track at the U.S.
 Naval Ordnance Test Station, Inyokern,
 Calif.,  All three of these installations
 have flat tracks, whereas the facility at
 Hurricane has the only elevated launch
 track.
 The concept of an elevated launch fa-
 cility was originated by the Wright Air
 Development Division as a means to pro-
 vide an extended period of free-flight
 testing for aircraft escape systems.  A
 comparable period of free flight before
 ground impact is not available to test
 items launched upwards from moving
 vehicles on flat tracks.  Flight char-
 acteristics can be more fully studied at
 the Hurricane track, because the free-
 flight feature provides designers and en-
 gineers time to study and evaluate sta-
 bilization and parachute recovery sys-
 tems under conditions similar to those
 experienced in actual flight.
 The  Hurricane  track was  designed
 and originally constructed at a cost of
 $2.4 million. The present value of fa-
 cilities and equipment at HSRS is $5.6
 million. Approximately   3,508 acres
 have been utilized for this test facility.
 Of this total 2,851 acres were obtained
 under permit from the Department of
 Interior, 643 acres were leased from the
 State of Utah and 14 acres were leased
 from private individuals.
 Mr. President, the Air Force has stated
 its reason for discontinuance of the
 Hurricane Track, as follows:
 The Hurricane Supersonic Research Site
 (HSRS)  was constructed primarily to test
 aircraft crew escape systems.  At the pres-
 ent time the major use of this facility is
 divided between tests of conventional air-
 craft escape systems and aircraft capsule
 escape systems.  With the decline of em-
 phasis  on  new manned  aircraft,  the  re-
 quirement for escape systems tests has ac-
 cordingly been diminishing.  We have re-
 cently completed a study of our require-
 ments for future sled track operations, and
 have considered in this study a request by
 the Atomic Energy Commission to conduct
 certain tests on Air Force tracks.  We have
 concluded that Air Force and AEC testing
 can be accomplished on two tracks instead
 of three.  Accordingly, we plan to discon-
 tinue operations at Hurricane Mesa at the
 expiration of the present contract on June
 30, 1961.
 I cannot quarrel with the principle of
 economy and the need for elimination of
 duplication wherever it may exist in our
 Defense Departments or other govern-
 mental agencies.  However, I do ques-
 tion whether the correct decision has
 been made as to which track should be
 discontinued and which kept in opera-
 tion.  It is significant that the Hurri-
 cane Track has unique features not
 available at any of the other tracks and
 that future testing of aircraft escape
 systems will be seriously hampered by
 the closing of HSRS.  In this regard, I
 ask unanimous consent to place in the
 RECORD at the end of my speech, five
 communications testifying as to the con-
 tinuing need for the Hurricane facility
 and showing that this track has particu-
 lar advantages over the flat tracks which
 will be kept in operation.  These com-
 munications are as follows:                                                                                                     Lockheed
 Aircraft  Corp.,  Vought    Aeronautics,
 Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp.,
 Convair, Department of Navy Airborne
 Division.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection to the request of the Senator
 from Utah?  The Chair hears none,
 and it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit 1.)
 Mr.   BENNETT.    Mr.   President,
 another significant fact which I think
 should be taken into account is that
 the Hurricane Track is the only one of
 the four now in operation which is op-
 erated by a private company under an
 Air Force contract.  The decision to close
 this track is another body blow at pri-
 vate industry and runs contrary to the
 recommendations of the Hoover Com-
 mission of getting the Government out
 of all business-type activities.  In this
 regard, this project is of particular im-
 portance to Washington County, Utah,
 because it constitutes the only industrial
 type activity in this area of the State.
 At present there are 65 permanently
 employed technicians at the site and
 the annual payroll is approximately half
 a million dollars.  Although this may
 appear to be an insignificant amount, it
 is of major. importance to this remote
 area of Utah, and its closing will create
 a real hardship, because there is no
 other industry to provide jobs or take
 up the slack when the testing track is
 closed.
 Mr. President, I have sent a letter to
 the chairman of the Senate Armed
 Services Committee, asking that the
 Preparedness  Subcommittee  make  a
 thorough study of the four existing
 tracks to determine whether, in the best
 interest of our Nation's defenses, the
 Hurricane Track should be kept on op-
 erational status.
 I ask unanimous consent that the let-
 ter be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the letter
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 THE JOHN BIRCH SOCIET`
 r. DODD.   Mr. P
 rgdaent;`It is un-
 ~
 fortu1ate--fee-aur- c1S'6 iety that opinions
 about communism frequently tend to
 polarize to extreme positions.
 On the one hand, there have always
 been naive or softheaded people, ultra-
 liberals who refuse to believe.that com-
 munism can be all evil; who insist that
 the Communists are like ourselves and
 that, if we are prepared to be reasonable,
 coexistence with them is possible; who
 close their eyes to all the massive evi-
 dence that communism is an interna-
 tional conspiracy committed to the de-
 struction of freedom and religion; who
 cry `witch-hunt" or McCarthyism at
 every effort to investigate Communist
 front operations and Communist infil-
 tration of government positions; who are
 not pro-Communist, but react with far
 greater emotion against every manifes-
 tation of anticommunism than they
 ever seem capable of displaying against
 communism.
 At the other extreme, there are those
 who are sincerely anti-Communist but
 who believe that everyone who dis-
 agrees with them is either a Communist
 or a dupe of the Communists, that every
 political figure who has been guilty of
 an error in judgment or a policy that
 failed, is ipso facto, a member of the
 Communist conspiracy.
 These extreme positions beget and
 encourage each other. The ultraliberal
 extremist becomes more extreme every
 time he is presented with evidence that
 someone has been the target of unjust
 or exaggerated accusations.
 The ultraconservative extremist be-
 comes more extreme, more set in his
 views, with every new manifestation of
 ultraliberal tolerance toward Communist
 and Communist-front operations.
 For these reasons, Mr. President, I be-
 lieve that the distinguished senior Sena-
 tor from North Dakota performed a real
 service when he brought certain facts
 about the John Birch Society to the at-
 tention of this body on March 8.
 Here is an organization which many
 thousands of sincere, dedicated citizens
 have joined because they are concerned
 over the Communist successes in recent
 years and would like to know more and
 to do something about it.
 The evidence, however, suggests that
 many of those who joined the John
 Birch Society did so in ignorance of the
 real views of the leadership of the organ-
 ization.
 Mr. Robert Welch, the head of the John
 Birch Society, is certainly opposed to
 communism.  But how does he oppose
 communism? Approximately 4 years ago
 he brought out a book entitled "The
 Politician," which was given limited
 circulation.  In this book.  Mr. Welch
 assailed Presidents Roosevelt, Truman
 and Eisenhower, the late Secretary of
 State John Foster Dulles, Mr. Allen
 Dulles, head of the Central Intelligence
 Agency, Chief Justice Warren, Dr. Mil-
 ton Eisenhower and many others, as
 Communists or Communist agents.
 To accuse people like President Eisen-
 hower and John Foster Dulles and the
 others of being Communist agents is an
 affront to both decency and intelligence.
 It brings our leaders and our institutions
 into disrepute, it sows division, it makes
 it easier for the Communists and the
 ultraliberals  to  equate  opposition  to
 communism with political lunacy.
 I believe, Mr. President, that the ex-
 treme views of Mr. Welch are not shared
 by the great majority of the sincere
 Americans who have joined the John
 Birch Society because of their genuine
 concern over communism.  But these
 views cannot be dismissed out of hand as
 the individual views of one man.  Mr.
 Welch happens to be the head of the
 organization.  The views in question
 moreover are recent views, which Mr.
 Welch has never repudiated.
 Quite inevitably, Mr. Welch's extrem-
 ism has infected some of his more im-
 pressionable followers.  It has come to
 my attention, for example, that the
 senior Senator from North Dakota and
 the senior Senator from California have
 been the targets of vicious, organized
 campaigns of letterwriting.  The gist of
 these letters, some of them addressed
 directly to the Senators, some of them
 sent to local newspapers, is that the Sen-
 ators in question are soft on communism
 or are dupes of the Communists. Some-
 times these charges are made openly;
 sometimes they are made by innuendo
 and implication.  The people who write
 these letters do not identify themselves
 as members of the John Birch Society,
 but no knowledgeable person has any
 doubts about the origins of this despic-
 able campaign of harassment.
 But I want to tell the people of Amer-
 ica and, in particular, I want to tell the
 members of the John Birch Society, that
 there are no more stanch anti-Commu-
 nists in our country than the senior Sen-
 ator from North Dakota and the senior
 Senator from California.  I consider the
 attacks on them to be beneath contempt.
 I agree with the opinion expressed by
 the conservative Los Angeles Times in its
 editorial of March 12:
 If the John Sirchers follow the program of
 their leader, they will bring our institutions
 into question exactly as the Communists try
 to do.  They will sow distrust, and aggravate
 disputes,  and  they will  weaken  the  very
 strong case for conservatism.
 I believe that it weakens the anti-
 Communist cause and it plays into the
 hands of the Communists, when anti-
 communism can be associated with this
 kind of sweeping, irresponsible, and re-
 pugnant charges made against so many
 distinguished Americans.
 Few men have held high public office
 without committing  their quotas of
 blunders and miscalculations.  For my
 own part, I believe that the free world
 has been guilty of many grave blunders
 in the postwar period-blunders com-
 mitted because we failed to understand
 the true nature of communism. But it
 is the worst kind of madness to charge
 that all of these blunders were perpe-
 trated under the direction of the Com-
 munist conspiracy by men who hold or
 have held the highest offices our country_
 has to offer.
 I want to commend the American press
 for bringing this situation to light.  I
 welcome this evidence of vigor and in-
 itiative on the part of the press.
 The press has a tremendous weapon
 for public good in the power of exposure.
 It has used it effectively in the case of
 the John Birch Society.  But for some
 reason which I cannot understand it has
 not used this weapon anywhere near as
 effectively against the Fair Play for Cuba
 Committee, the various offshoots of the
 Communist peace offensive, and the
 other Communist-front operations in
 this country.
 There is a job of political balancing to
 be done.  For my own part, I would be
 more than satisfied if our press devoted
 as much column space in coming months
 to exposing the subterranean operations
 of the Communist Party in this country
 as they have in recent weeks to exposing
 the excesses of the John Birch Society.
 Mr. KUCHEL.  Mr. President, I am
 more grateful than I can say for the
 comments made by the distinguished
 Senator from Connecticut CMr. Dona].
 Mr. President, international commu-
 nism has been and will continue to be
 an evil, dangerous worldwide conspiracy.
 Its intent continues to be to destroy free-
 dom. It is the very anthithesis of free-
 dom. Everything which .Americans hold
 dear is directly, completely opposite to
 international, communism.
 This country, under Democratic ad-
 ministrations and under Republican ad-
 ministrations, has demonstrated a cour-
 age and a zeal to maintain freedom, to
 deter Communist aggression, and, if nec-
 essary, to combat it.
 We have in this country, regretably,
 some few people who are guilty of
 treason.  I suppose that is always the
 case in any society. There are some who
 would pull down the pillars and try to
 destroy the very freedom under which
 they are .able to engage in their kind
 of ugly and reprehensible activity.
 But there is an equal danger in this
 country from those who take shocking
 and unbelievable positions, who continue
 an extreme philosophy of objecting to
 every kind of progress, who point the
 finger at, those who disagree with them,
 and say, "There walks a Communist."
 It is a fantastic and incredible libel
 upon one of the world's great exponents
 of freedom. when the head of this society
 accuses Dwight Eisenhower of being "a
 card-carrying Communist." Should the
 American people and the.American Gov-
 ernment let that kind of vile spleen be
 poured upon one who has given his
 whole  life  to  dedicated  service  to
 America, through participation in the
 world's greatest war, as the top com-
 mander, in which his armies emerged
 victorious, and through 3 years of un-
 selfishly serving the American people as
 their Chief Executive?
 Mr. President, I denounce anyone who
 makes that kind of false and contempt-
 ible charge.
 Across the street sits the Chief Justice
 of the United States, another great
 American.  People in this society be-
 smirch his character.
 Many of us in Government have been
 denounced and our names have been re-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX                April 14
 However, there is no inherent inconsist-
 ency between demanding competition and
 prescribing the rules by which it may be
 conducted.  It is true that some antitrust
 laws forbid the use of certain competitive
 weapons and techniques.  This does not,
 however, indicate that these laws require
 what their detractors derisively call "soft
 competition," or, indeed, that they are in
 any degree  anticompetitive.   There  is  no
 sport or contest conducted in civilized so-
 ciety without its rules.  These rules invari-
 ably permit certain forms of rivalry and pro-
 hibit certain other types of action as means
 of winning the sport, game, or contest.   Of
 course, there are always those who decry
 any limitation on the mayhem or bloodshed
 that is permitted by the prevailing rules of
 organized sport.  The Marquis of Queens-
 bury rules, I am informed, were once re-
 garded as wholly destroying the noble sport
 of manly combat in the ring.  There will al-
 ways be those who proclaim that any new
 rule takes all the fun and most of the com-
 petition out of a game.  However, civilized
 society lives by its laws, and competition
 within civilized society is always inhibited by
 authoritative standards of acceptable social
 behavior.  Were it otherwise, we would not
 have civilization but anarchy, and life would
 be quite intolerable.
 There may well be reasonable debate as
 to whether or not a particular rule is de-
 sirable in organized sports, other games or
 contests, or in application to the economy
 by the antitrust laws.  However, such an is-
 sue cannot be determined by the dogmatic
 assertion that all regulatory rules are incon-
 sistent with the basic principle of competi-
 tion.  it is not necessary to hit below the
 belt in order to fight as hard as you can.
 The rules that prescribe the mode and weap-
 ons of competition are not anticompetitive,
 but, on the contrary, are quite consistent
 with free  and  vigorous  competition in  a
 civilized society.
 Finally, let me express my profound con-
 viction that competition is neither incom-
 patible with nor a limitation upon efficiency.
 Indeed, competition is likely to be the stim-
 ulus which engenders efficiency.  It is sig-
 nificant that the greatest industrial and eco-
 nomic development has taken place in those
 countries which have had the greatest degree
 of economic freedom and competition.  Al-
 though there is not the time to offer the
 evidence now, I believe that an analysis of
 history  suggests  that  the  antitrust laws
 have not only permitted but have substan-
 tially contributed to the tremendous eco-
 nomic            and  polititcal  development of       the
 United States.  However, we must now bear
 in mind that the future is not foreordained;
 and that it will be determined not by our
 past history but by our present character and
 future conduct.
 The great issue of this age is whether this
 Nation, or any nation, can achieve full eco-
 nomic development, the satisfaction of all
 material needs, and the provision of adequate
 economic opportunities for all, together with
 political and civil liberty.  We believe that
 these goals are compatible,  and that the
 method by which they will be achieved is
 by observance of the principles embodied in
 the antitrust laws.  The diffusion of eco-
 nomic power and the freedom which en-
 genders competition are expressions in the
 economic realm of the basic faith of our
 culture that the individual human spirit rep-
 resents the highest social value.  Thus, we
 in the Antitrust Division are and will be
 dedicated to the faith that liberty, equality,
 and prosperity are consistent social objec-
 tives.            We are and will be devoted to the ef-
 fort to achieve these. goals by a vigorous and
 uncompromising enforcement of  the laws
 prescribing competition as our basic eco-
 nomic condition that we may protect and
 preserve economic freedom in this country.
 Hospital Ship "Hope"
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. WILLIAM B. WIDNALL
 OF NEW JERSEY
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, April 13, 1961
 Mr. WIDNALL.            Mr. Speaker, a pri-
 vately sponsored humanitarian effort of
 the American people that has had alto-
 gether too little publicity in relation to
 its accomplishments is Project Hope.
 Hope means Health Opportunity for
 People Everywhere.  Its chief instru-
 ment is a floating medical training cen-
 ter, the SS Hope I, a 15,000-ton vessel
 owned and loaned by the U.S. Govern-
 ment.  Primarily a teaching program,
 Project Hope combines both instruction
 and treatment in countries visited by
 SS Hope I.
 Project Hope as a mercy mission is not
 a governmental operation.  In fact, the
 Government does nothing more than
 lend the ship. It is a free expression of
 a free people.  It should be encouraged,
 and, since it is financed by contributions
 from private individuals and groups, it
 deserves general public support.
 An article on this subject by Charles
 J. Munzinger appeared on April 6 in the
 Oakland Bulletin, the Pompton Bulletin,
 the Riverdale Bulletin, and the Lincoln
 Park Herald.
 The story of Project Hope follows:
 HOSPITAL SmP "HOPE"
 (By Charles J. Munzinger)
 The following is a brief background on
 Project Hope.
 This is a privately sponsored program of
 help and relief to share our country's mod-
 ern medical knowledge and skills with all
 those in need thruout the world.  It is a
 floating medical training center for South-
 east Asia, and  is on loan from                                                                          the U.S.
 Government.
 Project Hope has the most modern medi-
 cal equipment and supplies, together with
 training aids. This ship, formerly the SS
 Consolation, is a 15,00-ton vessel, with 230
 beds, constructed during World War II.
 The permanent medical staff on this ves-
 sel includes 15 physicians, two dentists, 25
 nurses, and 30 auxilitary personnel.  Volun-
 teer teams of up to 35 physicians will be
 flown to the ship on a rotating basis for
 tours of 4 months.  The medical staff in-
 cludes top specialists in the key fields of
 medicine.
 Hope is essentially  a teaching program,
 although necessarily there  will  be treat-
 ment involved.                                                                         American members of the
 medical staff will be assigned to work in
 small teams with their local counterparts.
 This will enable the American staff to pass
 along  modern techniques and the  latest
 medical  knowledge under    working condi-
 tions.
 Part of the medical staff will work on
 shipboard; part will be in mobile units, on
 duty inland.  They will work with special-
 ists,  nurses,  midwives,  and  technicians.
 Training will also be conducted through
 classroom lectures and discussions, -movies
 and film strips.
 Teaching is stressed because this will en-
 able Hope to have a more enduring effect on
 local health conditions,  than  would  at-
 tempts at widespread treatment.                                                                              Concen-
 tration on training will enable Hope to
 help upgrade the local medical staff in their
 ability to diagnose and treat.  In this *ay,
 these people will in turn be able to teach
 others.  Thus, Hope's impact will grow and
 spread.
 The SS Hope will visit only those countries
 to which it has been invited by the local
 medical professions.  It is just completing
 a 6 months stay at Indonesia.  Vietnam will
 be next, for a stay of 4 months, after which
 Hope will return to the United States.  In-
 vitations have also been received from Korea,
 Okinawa and Pakistan.
 Hope's program is geared to the specific
 needs  of  the  countries visited. Activities
 are worked out in advance with local doctors.
 This will enable Hope to concentrate on the
 most serious and -pressing problems of each
 country.
 A recent study conducted by the Depart-
 ment                                                                                                                           of  Health,  Education,  and  Welfare
 shows  that  the construction  costs  of  a
 260-bed hospital total $5,720,000, while an-
 nual operating costs amount to $2,982,700,
 for a total of $8,702,700.
 In comparison, the total cost of operating
 the 15,000-ton, 230-bed SS Hope -as a medi-
 ical training center and hospital will come
 to less than $3.5 million a year.
 The funds to operate Hope are  coming
 from private contributions, also from busi-
 ness, industry, labor unions, and other-pri-
 vate groups  and individual                                                                                                                           contributions.
 The government's only role in this endeavor
 is the loan of the hospital ship.
 Support for Project Hope is widespread.
 It has been endorsed by the American Medi-
 cal and Dental Associations, and many other
 medical agencies.  It had the personal back-
 ing of ex-President Eisenhower and has the
 wholehearted support of President Kennedy.
 The American President Lines are operat-
 ing the SS Hope at cost.  Drug and phar-
 maceutical companies of our country are
 supplying drugs and medicines when needed.
 The American petroleum industry has un-
 derwritten fuel costs to operate Hope.  The
 Pure-Pak  Division  of Ex-Cell-O  Corp. is
 sponsoring a major motion picture project
 to raise funds for Hope.
 Poverty, disease and malnutrition are com-
 mon in Southeast Asia. Millions of people
 there are caught up in a catastrophe-they
 have to pr-.)duce to survive, but unhealthy
 men cannot produce.     -
 Hope is an experiment in international
 cooperation.  Hope's  backers  believe  that
 better understanding among the people of
 the world can be achieved on a personal level,
 through friendship, the sharing of knowl-
 edge and helping others to help themselves.
 Hope's medical staff will benefit greatly,
 in newfound knowledge.  Information will
 flow both ways.  The experience to be gained
 in diagnosis and treatment of tropical di-
 seases couldn't be gained anywhere in the
 United States.
 These people to people contacts can help
 form the basis of a lasting peace and under-
 standing.  Hope  means-Health  Opportu-
 nity for People Everywhere.
 The need for Hope is great.  In much of
 Southeast Asia, there just  aren't enough
 doctors to go around.  In Indonesia, there
 is one doctor for every 71,000 persons.
 With such a condition, the medical men
 are so busy that they find it difficult to keep
 up with modern techniques and develop-
 ments.  This means they can't get away to
 the United States or Europe to gain advanced
 training.
 Project Hope  will,  in  effect,  bring  the
 medical school to these physicians.
 Nurses aboard the good ship Hope, now on
 a training and teaching mission to the Re-
 public of Indonesia, where the religion is
 chiefly Moslem, report that patients coming
 aboard the ship carry small compasses, to
 show them the direction of Mecca.
 Project Hope is headed by Dr. William B.
 Walsh, heart specialist at Washington, D.C.

 11 don't think anybody should really pay
 too much attention to them.  I think they
 make no contribution to the fight against
 communism here in the United States and,
 in fact, I think if anything they are a hin-
 drance.  It seems to me It is an organization
 in the area of the humorous and I don't
 think so much attention should be taken."
 We can agree: that they make no contribu-
 tion to the fight against communism.  But
 we cannot agree that they should be ignored.
 These people need to be exposed because
 they weaken our democratic fabric when it
 Is in mortal combat with communism and,
 in that respect:, they serve the cause of com-
 munism.  They breed distrust of democracy.
 They have members who are men of great
 wealth and influence in the country.  Three
 former heads of the National Association
 of Manufacturers are members.  A former
 head of the Internal Revenue Service is a
 member.  Their governing council includes
 prominent industrialists across the country.
 Their founder, Robert Welch, is a suc-
 cessful businessman, whose public speaking
 appearances are  attracting  capacity  audi-
 ences.                            The membership of this organization
 has grown rapidly In the few years of its
 existence.
 Its      methods of  operation-anonymous
 telephone calls and mail to public officials-
 are calculated to frighten timid officehold-
 ers with being smeared with the Communist
 label.
 They are masters at exploiting the deep-
 rooted  fear  of  communism  among  our
 people.  Fear-ridden people believe a lot
 of ridiculous things.  They might even be-
 lieve that our last three Presidents were
 part of the Communist conspiracy, particu-
 larly if the charges are Ignored. Remember
 what Hitler said about the "big lie."
 There is only one way to deal with people
 like this-make them prove their charges.
 McCarthy was finished when he went before
 the country to try and prove his charges
 against the Army.
 Recent Developments in Antitrust
 Enforcement
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. HUBERT H. HUMPHREY
 OF MINNESOTA
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Friday, April 14, 1961
 Mr. HUMPHREY.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent to have printed
 in the Appendix of the RECORD the text
 of the speech delivered by Lee Loevinger,
 Assistant Attorney General in charge of
 the Antitrust Division, U.S. Department
 of Justice, before the American Bar As-
 sociation at Washington on April 7,
 1961.
 I am sure that all Senators will find
 the  speech  very  informative.  Mr.
 Loevinger is considered to be an out-
 standing authority in the field of anti-
 trust law.
 There being no objection, the address
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 RECENT  DEVELOPMENTS  IN  ANTITRUST
 ENFORCEMENT
 (Speech by Lee Loevinger to Antitrust Sec-
 tion, American Bar Association, Washing-
 ton, D.C., April 7, 1961)
 One year ago I appeared before this dis-
 tinguished and elite group to deliver what
 was then expected to be a "swan song" with
 relation to my active antitrust participation.
 The curious surprises that fate has in store
 for us and the verity of Bobby Burns' sage
 observation on the plans of men and the
 lower animals could not be better illustrated
 than by the events that have happened to
 me since then.  Indeed, the circumstances
 that have thus drastically affected my own
 life may well be relevant to the assigned
 topic of this speech which is "Recent De-
 velopments in Antitrust Enforcement."
 The conventional approach to this topic
 is to review carefully and in detail the de-
 cisions of appellate courts that have been
 rendered since the last such  discussion.
 This seems unnecessary on this occasion.
 All of you follow the development of anti-
 trust law in the courts; and it would be fu-
 tile and foolish to attempt to improve upon
 either the reporting service of Law Week,
 C.C.H., and the advance sheets, or the analy-
 ses and discussion available to you both in
 publications and in your own offices. It may
 be more relevant and important to indicate
 what I consider to be the most important de-
 velopment in antitrust, as in other law en-
 forcement, during the past year.
 The most important development in the
 enforcement of the antitrust laws since your
 last meeting has undoubtedly been the elec-
 tion of John F. Kennedy as President of the
 United States.  This has resulted in the in-
 fusion of a new spirit of energy and dedica-
 tion throughout the public service.  Beyond
 this that historic event has brought to the
 highest levels of Government administra-
 tion and law enforcement a new understand-
 ing and a firmer faith in the principles upon
 which antitrust is founded than there has
 previously been for many years.
 This may most usefully be illustrated for
 you by suggesting some of my own views.
 Perhaps these may also serve to lay at rest
 a few ancient shibboleths of the antitrust
 bar.  The first is the notion that violation of
 the antitrust laws, whether intentional or
 not, is merely a normal business risk and
 really quite respectable.  This is related to
 the feeling that has heretofore been tacit but
 pervasive that it is inappropriate to have
 criminal sanctions in the antitrust laws, and
 that, In any event, these were to be applied
 only to corporations and not to individuals.
 In this view even deliberate violations of the
 antitrust laws were, at worst, venial offenses
 of no more moral significance than a park-
 ing ticket.
 It may be hoped that the Philadelphia
 electric cases, for which the preceding ad-
 ministration of the Antitrust Division is to
 be given all due credit, have helped to dispel
 this  misapprehension.  In  any  event,  it
 should now be clear that a deliberate or con-
 scious violation of the antitrust laws is not
 a mere personal pecadillo or economic eccen-
 tricity, but a serious offense against society
 which is as immoral as any other act that
 injures many in order to profit a few.  Con-
 spiracy to violate the antitrust laws is eco-
 nomic racketeering which gains no respect-
 ability by virtue of the fact that the loot
 is secured by stealth rather than by force.
 Those who are apprehended in such acts are,
 and will be treated as, criminals and will
 personally be subjected to as severe a punish-
 ment                                                                             as we  can  persuade  the  courts  to
 impose.                   -
 In the second place, the Antitrust Division
 is not receptive to pleas for exceptions, ex-
 emptions or special treatment of any com-
 pany or Industry.                                                                            We have been told fre-
 quently and are quite well aware that every
 industry and situation is unique, that every
 company is most exceptional and that every
 case is quite extraordinary. We are also well
 aware that Congress and the courts have re-
 peatedly  and  emphatically  declared  that
 competition, rather than collusion or mo-
 nopoly, shall be the basic rule of commerce.
 This rule springs from the conviction that
 competition is the counterpart and corollary
 of economic freedom, and that a free econ-
 omy is necessarily a competitive economy.
 Therefore, in general we will oppose excep-
 tions to or exemptions from the antitrust
 laws, sought by way of departmental policy
 or judicial. rulings.  When asked for com-
 ment on a legislative proposal for antitrust
 exemption;, we will take a long, hard look.
 With exceptions already covered by existing
 laws, we have seen no persuasive case for
 compromising  any  antitrust  principles  in
 special cases.
 That  the  necessity  for  complying with
 high standards of business conduct required
 by the moral principles inherent in our legal
 codes may sometimes cause concern to busi-
 nessmen and lawyers is inevitable.  This is
 not a difficulty unique to the antitrust laws.
 The temptation to get rich quickly by dis-
 honest Ineans abounds in private life.  Some
 succumb, but we do not listen sympathet-
 ically to the plea that theft or embezzlement,
 for example, should be legalized because it
 is no difficult to acquire wealth by other
 means.   While the antitrust laws are, in
 some respects, complex, they are also flexible
 and reasonable.  The burden of proof rest-
 ing on those: who seek exceptions or ex-
 emptions is not borne by the showing that
 it is more profitable or convenient to have
 no such Inhibiting standards of conduct.
 In the third place, the argument that the
 laws are basically sound but that they must
 be  made more acceptable to  business by
 modifications to make them both more flexi-
 ble and more certain is either disingenuous
 sophistry  or  compounded  confusion.   To
 seek both flexiblity  and certainty in the
 same laws is a logical contradiction.  It is
 equivalent to a demand that we simul-
 taneously institute both  higher and lower
 prices for a commodity. It is easy enough
 to write laws that are certain in their op-
 eration.  In the antitrust field, the per se
 violations are examples of rules that pro-
 vide certainty. These could well be extended
 by either judicial or legislative adoption of
 more per se rules.  Conversely, it is easy
 enough to write principles that are flexible.
 In the antitrust field the rule of reason is
 an example.  But it should be clear to any
 reasonable man that a rule which is cer-
 tain is, by virtue of that very fact, not flexi-
 ble.   A rule                                                                                                                                         which  is  flexible  cannot  be
 certain in prospective application.
 As applied to the interpretation of law,
 the demand for certainty and flexibility in-
 volves polar concepts which must be recon-
 ciled and compromised.  The difficult task
 is to write a law which provides a reason-
 able certainty and a reasonable flexibility
 respecting  a  single subject  matter.  No
 doubt judgments may differ as to the precise
 balance between flexibility and certainty
 that is desirable in a given instance. There
 is no objective or absolute standard that
 can provide a clear determination of the
 proper  balance  between  these  competing
 considerations.  However, it is futile and logi-
 cally absurd to demand more of both flexi-
 bility and certainty from the same law at
 the same time.
 The antitrust laws combine both flexibility
 and certainty to a degree that has been
 thought appropriate to their subject matter
 by several  generations  of  legislators  and
 judges.   Perhaps they are imperfect;     true
 perfection is probably beyond human attain-
 ment.  improvement may be possible; but
 it is possible only when the demand is for
 consistent objectives.
 In the fourth place, aside from the inevita-
 ble compromise between flexibility and cer-
 tainty, the antitrust laws themselves appear
 to me to embody a consistent conception
 and system.  The argument is sometimes
 made that while the basic mandate of the
 antitrust laws is for competition, other parts
 of the laws, such as those against price dis-
 crimination, Inhibit competition.

 That is what the Constitution says.
 The House shall originate the revenue
 measures, not any committee of the
 House.
 How about money to be drawn from
 the Treasury?  Section I, article 9 pro-
 vides:        ,
 No money shall be drawn from the Treas-
 ury, but in consequence of appropriations
 made by law.
 Note that the appropriations are to be
 made by law, not by the Appropriations
 Committee.
 Who shall make the laws? Article VI
 of the Constitution states:
 This Constitution, and  the laws of the
 United States which shall be made in pur-
 suance thereof * * * shall be the supreme
 law of the land.
 Every bill that has been referred to by
 those who talk about back-door spend-
 ing has been passed by the Congress, the
 duly elected representatives of the peo-
 ple.        A part of that Congress are the
 members of the House Committee on
 Appropriations. If they do not like any
 bill that is being presented it is their
 prerogative and duty to stand here in
 the well of the House to oppose it and by
 their vote show their disapproval.
 Congress in its wisdom decided that
 for good management we should have
 various committees in the House, but
 there is no committee of the House that
 is superior to the Congress itself. When
 Congress decides that there shall be a
 call upon the Treasury, that is the su-
 preme law of the land. There is no veto
 power placed in any committee of the
 House or Senate.  That is what the
 Founding Fathers said.  If we want to
 change it, it is within our prerogative,,
 but until that times comes this bill is
 perfectly legitimate. There is nothing
 in it that is illegal. There is no back-
 door spending.  It is spending by Con-
 gress as authorized by Congress, and
 should be approved.
 The Economics of Hospital Care
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. CLINTON P. ANDERSON
 OF NEW MEXICO
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Friday, April 14, 1961
 Mr. ANDERSON.  Mr. President, the
 April edition of the Progressive carries
 an article by a highly regarded writer
 on medical problems, Selig Greenberg,
 of the Providence, R.I., Journal and
 Evening Bulletin.  It is an exceptionally
 clear presentation of the economics of
 hospital care. Mr. Greenberg expresses
 a view with which many of us in Con-
 gress have long been in sympathy, which
 is that what happens in medicine affects
 each and every American; therefore the
 business of medicine is the public's
 business.
 I commend this article to everyone in-
 terested in a concise analysis of a rather
 complex problem, and ask unanimous
 consent that it be printed in the Appen-
 dix of the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 CRISIS IN TILT: HOSPITALS
 (By Sel,ig Greenberg)
 The Nation's hospitals-the  outposts  of
 our phenomenal medical progress-are now
 confronted with a profound crisis, at the
 very time they are advancing toward ever
 greater miracles of healing and lifesaving.
 Soaring hospital costs and hospitalization
 insurance rates have brought a rising tide
 of public concern, expressed in demands for
 greater efficiency in hospital operation, and
 for reforms in the prevailing patterns of
 health insurance.  Across the country labor
 unions, business firms, citizens' groups, and
 public officials are calling for controls on
 skyrocketing costs, curbs on services which
 are either wholly unnecessary or could be
 furnished less expensively, and a more ra-
 tional and coherent system that will get
 the most out of the medical care dollar.  In-
 creasingly, warnings are heard from respon-
 sible sources that the squeeze of spiraling
 costs may price voluntary insurance out of
 the market and force full Government con-
 trol of our whole complex of health services.
 There is probably no more explosive issue
 in the entire controversial field of medical
 economics than that of hospital costs.  For
 it is here, more than in any other area of
 medical care, that the problems of the tech-
 nological revolution in medicine are rapidly
 coming to a head.
 Hospital services now not only account for
 the largest single portion of the Nation's
 health care bill, but they are at the heart
 of our system of medical practice.  As med-
 icine grows more intricate and its tools more
 elaborate,  the  trend  inevitably  is  toward
 increasing concentration of medical services
 within  the  hospital.  And  it is  the   very
 triumphs of medicine which are catapulting
 costs.  Nowhere is this more evident than
 in the hospitals, which have become a large-
 scale and complex business requiring the
 coordination of a great array of professional
 skills and huge capital investment in ex-
 pensive facilities and equipment.
 Basically, the crisis of hospital function
 and financing stems from the fact that we
 are both the beneficiaries and the victims
 of  the  remarkable  progress  of  medicine
 which  has brought us better health and
 longer life but also has enormously com-
 plicated the rendering of medical services
 and raised their costs.   The resolution in
 medicine is far from over, and hospitals have
 yet to fulfill their growing potential.  Fur-
 ther  scientific  advances  will                                                                          unavoidably
 mean still costlier diagnostic and treatment
 procedures, more elaborate,  and expensive
 equipment, and an even greater need for
 technical personnel. A continued rise in
 hospital costs thus appears inescapable.   So
 it is all the more vital to eliminate the waste,
 duplication, and lack of integrated planning
 now common in the hospital field.  If there
 are  ways of operating hospitals more ef-
 ficiently and economically-as many author-
 ities believe there are-the public certainly
 has the right to insist an getting full value
 at the lowest possible price consistent with
 high quality.
 Good hospital care clearly cannot be pro-
 duced cheaply.  But if costs are to be kept
 within acceptable bounds and quality im-
 proved, we will need a much higher degree
 of self-discipline by the medical profession
 and a far greater readiness on the part of
 hospitals to yield some of the privileges of
 their cherished autonomy than have so far
 been evident.  It is no exaggeration to sn,j
 that the future of the organization of medi-
 cal care and practice in the United States
 depends on the extent to which the doctors
 and the hospitals can be prevailed upon to
 recognize that their business is the public's
 business.
 The statistics of rising hospital costs and
 utilization are instructive and soberjng.
 For  a  number     of  years,  hospital  room
 charges have been  advancing at       a much
 faster rate  than  any  other  item  in   the
 United States Department of Labor's con-
 sumer price index.                                                                                                                                 The overall index, which
 is pegged at 100 for the 1947-49 period, had
 risen to 124.6 by the end of 1959.   At that
 time the index for all medical care services
 put together stood at 150.8.  But for hospi-
 tal room rates it was 208.9.
 In 1946, the average cost per patient-day
 in voluntary hospitals was $9.39.    By 1959,
 it had jumped to $30.19, an increase of more
 than 220 percent.  Nor is the end of the
 spiral anywhere in sight.  Experts are gen-
 erally agreed that hospital costs will continue
 to rise at the rate of 5 to 10 percent a year.
 A spokesman for the American Hospital As-
 sociation has predicted that the average cost
 per patient-day may reach $50 by 1968.
 Of equal Importance in contributing to the
 steady climb of the Nation's hospital bill is
 the striking increase In the rate of hos-
 pitalization.  Thirty years ago, 37 out of
 every 1,000 Americans were admitted to gen-
 eral hospitals in the course of a year.  Since
 then the ratio of hospital admissions has
 zoomed to 124. A variety of factors has
 figured in this upward trend.  For one thing,
 hospitals can do much more for the sick
 than they could two or three decades ago.
 Widespread insurance coverage has removed
 much of the economic deterrent to hospital
 care for those In the middle- and low-income
 groups.  In the  Nation's population there
 has been a steady increase in the numbers
 and in the proportion of older people, who
 have a higher incidence of chronic diseases
 requiring  more  frequent  hospitalization.
 Many conditions of modern city living make
 for significantly higher hospital use than in
 rural areas.  The large proportion of work-
 ing wives means that often there is no one
 at home to take care of a sick husband or
 child.  The high price of household or nurs-
 ing help to care for the sick at home and
 the limited size of city apartments also force
 up the hospitalization rate.
 The net effect of higher costs of hospital
 care and its much greater frequency has
 been a tripling of expenditures for hospital
 services in the United States in the past 15
 years.  Out of a total private medical care
 outlay of $18.3 billion in 1959, payments to
 hospitals were $5.5 billion, the biggest single
 share,  and  $500  million more  than  the
 amount paid to physicians.  The latest avail-
 able breakdown shows that 30 cents out of
 every medical care dollar now goes to hos-
 pitals, 27 cents to doctors, 26 cents for drugs
 and appliances, 11 cents to dentists, and the
 remaining  6  cents  for  other  professional
 services.
 There  are many sound reasons for the
 continued rise in hospital operating costs.
 A  U.S. Public  Health  Service  official  has
 summed them up with the cogent observa-
 tion that "when we talk about the cost of
 medical care today as compared to the past,
 we're talking about the price of an electric
 washer-dryer compared to a washtub."
 There is no ready solution for the costli-
 ness of new and more effective medical pro-
 cedures, more elaborate surgery, and more
 potent drugs.  Such dramatic advances as
 open-heart surgery, artificial kidneys, heart
 pacemaker units, cobalt radiation treatment,
 and radioisotopes to pinpoint internal ab-
 normalities are restoring patients to health
 sooner and more completely, and, frequently,

 One of those holding that genuine econ-

 lessening quality of service, and that Blue
 Cross should insist on such economies in-
 stead of merely acting as a collection agency
 for the hospitals, is Francis R. Smith, Penn-
 sylvania'  dynamic State insurance commis-
 sioner.
 Smith, who feels that his authority to pass
 on Blue Cross premium rates  goes much
 further than the checking of actuarial tables
 and extends to the things which pyramid
 costs, has for several years been preaching
 the doctrine that neither the hospitals nor
 Blue Cross have done all they can and should
 to control such abuses as unnecessary admis-
 sions and excessively protracted stays and
 to put into effect other efficiency measures.
 And the commissioner has used his legal
 powers to enforce his views.  In a series of
 trail-blazing decisions, he has ordered Blue
 Cross and the hospitals in Philadelphia and
 other cities to adopt certain economy meas-
 ures before any further insurance rate boosts
 would be granted. Among the economy pos-
 sibilities he has advocated are wider use of
 opportunities for outpatient diagnosis and
 treatment, tighter controls on the schedul-
 ing of admissions  and discharges and on
 length of stay, better scheduling of medical
 procedures to avoid needless delays, more
 effective use of technicians and nurses, shar-
 ing of specialized equipment among hos-
 pitals, and greater standardization of sup-
 plies along with joint purchasing.
 Considerable progress has been achieved
 in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and other Penn-
 sylvania communities under Smith's prod-
 ding during the past 2 years.  Blue Cross
 plans have developed medical review teams
 to ferret out abuse of insurance contracts.

 about the significance of this group, and
 I hope that my colleagues in the Con-
 gress will take time to read it.            I ask
 unanimous consent that it be printed in
 the Appendix of the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Pine Bluff Commercial, Apr. 1,
 - 1961]
 THE NEW PERIL
 We have been trying to work up a proper
 degree of concern and Indignation about
 the John Birch society, and have not so far
 made the grade.
 The society may well be the menace it is
 being painted to be.  We remember a fellow
 who laughed at Joe McCarthy.
 But the Republic has stood off the Soviet
 Union  since  1945  and,  with  considerable
 help, whipped two sets of Fascists plus Mus-
 solini's legions more or less simultaneously
 in the period immediately preceding.
 It lived through the know-nothings, the
 Klan,  the  silver  shirts, and  the  afore-
 mentioned McCarthy, and will, from all in-
 dications, also survive the citizens councils.
 We are experienced,  as      a Nation,  with
 crackpots and authoritarians.  If the John
 Birch Society is not about the nearest to im-
 potent of the lot we are, as a newspaper, a
 good way wide of the mark.
 It has been alleged that the John Birch
 Society is a hate group, hence dangerous.
 Certainly it is made up of people who know
 how to hate, and who enjoy the sport.  But
 they are also, and more profoundly, people
 shaken to their being by fear.
 Whether the founder (who girded for his
 present large responsibilities in his brother's
 candy factory)  knows it or not, the John
 Birch Society is built upon the proposition
 that mankind is doomed, and that there is
 now time only for a desperate rearguard
 action.
 The society is convinced that all forces of
 change are exclusively in the service of the
 Kremlin, and that they threaten the civi-
 lized world at every point of contact.
 What we have here is a fellowship of fear.
 In its articles of faith, the society resembles
 nothing so much as one of those sects which
 have from time to time taken to the base-
 ment and sealed up the cracks around the
 door in the conviction that the world would
 end at 5:27 a.m. a week from Thursday.
 Consider the men and things which the
 John Birchers or their founder have already
 conceded to the Communists: They include
 the Preisdent and his predecessor; the Su-
 preme Court ; the Nation's city managers;
 the urban renewal advocates; the proponents
 of fluoridation; the United Nations.
 These people  don't need condemnation.
 They need help.
 They need, each of them, a quick course in
 American history, a heart-to-heart talk with
 a trustworthy friend and then, perhaps, a
 good long rest.
 The evidence is that John Birchism is in-
 curable, but we can try.
 Nor does John Birchism seem to us to be
 contagious.  The presumption on which the
 organization has been viewed so generally
 with alarm, is that it is a virus likely to in-
 fect innocent people.
 All of the evidence we've seen indicates
 that the people already had the virus, and
 have simply  gotten together to share its
 miseries.
 We suppose that there may be people in
 meaningful   numbers willing  to take  the
 oath of allegiance to an outfit which is will-
 ing to forfeit the American system of Gov-
 ernment for something the John Birchers
 call, quite gratuitously, "the American way
 of life."
 But we doubt that there are many men
 of sound mind willing to accept the col-
 lateral dictum that Dwight Eisenhower is a
 Communist.
 To the extent that they have done any-
 thing, except to each other and themselves,
 the John Birchers seem to us to have per-
 formed a substantial public service.
 They have alerted their fellow Americans
 to the existence on the far, far right of the
 political spectrum of people every bit as
 confused,  troubled and willing  to  be  led
 around by the nose as their opposite num-
 bers on the far, far left.
 The society also has provided an inter-
 esting litmus test for some of our noisier
 politicians.
 Senator  EASTLAND, for example, has just
 spoken well of them.
 Until they move beyond their present ac-
 tivities, which appear to consist pretty ex-
 clusively of whipping up each others' hysteria
 and of occasionally slandering men so em-
 inent as to be substantially invulnerable to
 such attacks, we think the John Birchers
 more a nuisance than a peril.
 If we must have people willing to believe
 in the things the society stands for, we may
 as well have the society.
 The existence of such a group is bound
 to cut down on the number of Birchists run-

 "Wisconsin Agriculturalist" Writer Ralph
 Yohe Describes Vocational Training
 Outlook for Rural Youth
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. WILLIAM PROXMIRE
 OF WISCONSIN
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Tuesday, April 18, 1961
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, the
 outstanding farm paper, the Wisconsin
 Agriculturalist, has been carrying  a
 series of fine articles on the theme
 "Rural  Education  on  Trial."   They
 have been written by a distinguished
 Wisconsin farm writer, Mr. Ralph S.
 Yohe.   The most recent two articles in
 this series describe recent developments
 in  vocational schools and  technical
 training.
 Mr. Yohe notes that Wisconsin has
 one of the better vocational training
 programs in the Nation, established 50
 years ago. Sixty-two cities in Wiscon-
 sin offer vocational and adult education
 courses. As of last year, well over 5,000
 students were enrolled in these programs.
 Mr. Yohe asks:
 How does farm youth fit into this picture?
 Only 20 to 30 percent of the youth growing
 up on farms will be able to find good farm-
 ing opportunities.  This means that 70 to
 80 percent must eventually find jobs in
 factories and offices.
 Yet a smaller percentage of farm youth
 take training in the State's vocational schools
 than city youth.
 The writer goes on to examine the
 reasons for this. He suggests in conclu-
 sion that vocational training schools be
 expanded and upgraded, to meet the
 needs of both city and rural young pea-
 Apxil 18
 ple. To better accomplish this he rec-
 ommends that area vocational schools
 be established in various parts of the
 State.
 In view of the great interest in voca-
 tional training that has arisen in con-
 nection with the area redevelopment bill,
 I ask unanimous consent that Mr.
 Yoke's articles and the accompanying
 table be printed in the Appendix of the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the articles
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 How Do WE STAND WITH VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS?
 (By Ralph S. Yoke)
 Wisconsin has one of the better vocational
 training programs in the Nation.  The Wis-
 consin Legislature established vocational and
 adult education in 1911-50 years ago.
 The program was set up to furn[sh voca-
 tional and industrial training for people in
 the growing towns and cities of Wisconsin.
 At that time, there was little thought that
 such training might someday be desirable
 for rural youth.
 "The growth of the schools has been cor-
 related with the growth of the communities
 in which they exist; and as the communities
 have grown and expanded, greater demands
 have been placed upon the schools for broad-
 ened and more comprehensive service," says
 C. L. Greiber, director of the State board of
 vocational and adult education.
 LAW ALLOWS AREAWIDE SCHOOLS
 The original law set up the program as in-
 dividual community activities.  The courses
 are approved, the schools supervised and co-
 ordinated by the State board of vocational
 and adult education.
 In 1955, the legislature passed a law to al-
 low areawide vocational schools. Any county
 or area with 20,000 or more people can set up
 an area vocational school to meet their needs.
 So far no such area schools have been
 established. Why?
 Such schools must be built and run largely
 through local tax money.  The areas that
 need them most are the least able to build
 and support them.
 Most of the areas that are able to run and
 support vocational schools already have voca-
 tional schools in one or more of the cities.
 Wisconsin's present vocational schools get
 most of their support from the local towns
 and  cities  where  they  are  located.   The
 State's vocational schools' income in 1960
 came from: 75 percent, local property tax
 base; 4 percent, State funds; 3 percent, Fed-
 eral Government; 7 percent, fees and tui-
 tion; 11 percent, other sources.
 Last year the State's part of the $10 mil-
 lion for running vocational schools in Wis-
 consin amounted to $420,000.  This yeas it
 will be upped to $1,785,000.
 The Wisconsin program is quite in con-
 trast to States like Connecticut, where voca-
 tional schools get nearly 100 percent of their
 help from the State.
 The 62 vocational schools scattered over
 the State offer a variety of training-trade
 and business extension education, general
 adult  education,  training for  apprentices,
 and instruction for high school age youth.
 Wisconsin laws require youngsters to go
 to' school until they are 16 or have gradu-
 ated from high school.   Where vocational
 training is available, youngsters under       16
 who have graduated from grade school can
 take full-time vocational work instead of
 high school.
 The law also requires that town and city
 youth from 16 to 18 who are not enrolled
 or have not  graduated from high  school
 must attend vocational school 1 day a week.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX                   A2585
 Welt Behlen, laid off from the cornfields
 by mechanization, became an inventor of
 improved farm equipment.  He started with
 nothing and his company now does $14 to
 $16 million volume annually.  He is the
 town's most famous success story, but there
 are dozens of others.  And now Columbus is
 known through the Plains States as a little
 hub of technology for the farm. Population
 has climbed to 13,000.
 EXUDE CONFIDENCE
 "If Columbus can catch up, so can the
 country's scientists," says  a  pipe-smoking
 store owner.          "We're doing all right with our
 missiles, and it won't be long before we show
 the Russians something.  Funny thing about
 Americans-once they wake up they usually
 go to town.           Some people don't believe that,
 but I do."
 William Floyd is 45 years old and he has
 been principal of Columbus Senior High
 School for 6 years..  In those years the num-
 ber                  of  students  taking  advanced  science
 courses has almost; trebled, and he attributes
 this to the effect of the East-West space race
 on  the popular imagination. He  thinks
 Gagarin's flight should be kept in perspec-
 tive.
 "I don't lie awake nights about it. Re-
 member Russia has really concentrated on
 this project to the exclusion of many other
 fields of inquiry.  The United States is well
 ahead in the overall picture, and in time
 we'll overtake the Communists in space ex-
 ploration.  It would be a mistake, I think,
 for the country to become alarmed because
 the first man to orbit the earth was a Rus-
 sian.
 "It's  overall  balance that counts, don't
 forget. Why we've had outstanding hurdlers
 from time to time and still had lousy track
 teams."
 Columbus High is a sprawling buff-colored
 structure situated just north of U.S. Route
 30, a major transcontinental highway.  The
 school  is  3  years  old  and impressively
 equipped.   In one room, a laboratory, stu-
 dents not entirely unhappy about an inter-
 ruption in their work gave a visitor their
 views about Gagarin's flight.
 "I don't think of it as a space race," says
 Bert  Aerni,  an  18-year-old  senior,  as  he
 throws aside his rubber apron.  Bert, who
 wants  to be  an electrical engineer, adds,
 "It's all human achievement no matter who
 does it.  The Russians will make propaganda
 gains, but I don't think we're very far be-
 hind them."
 After a pause Bert says softly, "Even so,
 I guess I am disappointed we didn't do it
 first."
 Anita Mueller, 17, a senior who plans to
 be a math teacher, isn't especially impressed
 with the Soviet feat.  "Really," she remarks
 with it twinkle, "what's the difference be-
 tween a man and a monkey?"
 Back downtown Ben B. McNair, president
 of the Citizens Bank, leans back in his chair
 and rubs his chin.     Mr. McNair, at 63, has
 been a banker all his life, but it was only
 .2 years ago that he helped found Citizens.
 The institution has grown rapidly and now
 has deposits exceeding $2 million.  Mr. Mc-
 Nair doesn't think "we should be down on
 ourselves."
 "The Government's going about this space
 business in a logical way," he says. "We're
 not shooting a man up there just for the
 sake of trying.
 "The sad thing is that some foreign na-
 tions are so impressionable.  When I was in
 Italy a while ago, some people over there
 told me communism has more to offer than
 democracy.  They tried to support this no-
 tion by pointing to Russia's superior ath-
 letes.  What sense does this make?  But un-
 doubtedly many people will be impressed in
 the same way by the Soviet space man."
 The idea that many of the peoples of the
 world use vulnerable criteria in judging ide-
 ologies was echoed heatedly by Peter Haas, a
 young farm-equipment salesman.
 "Answer me this, will you?  Why should
 we get in a scientific vaudeville show with
 the Russians?  So what if all the banana
 countries start doing  a rain dance  every
 time somebody shoots off a rocket.   Sure,
 putting that guy up there was a great stunt,
 but does anybody doubt next year at this
 time we'll. have guys doing the same thing?
 I'm tired of all this moaning and wailing."
 But Alice Micek, a bookkeeper, was un-
 willing to  pass off the  Soviet success so
 lightly.  "This is a serious setback for the
 United States.  It will provide a lot of propa-
 ganda for the Reds.  I think the Russians
 are ahead of us because we give away too
 many secrets.   Television and newspapers
 report about our missiles in such detail, it's
 no wonder the Communists have the advan-
 tage.  Now something should be done about
 it."
 OTHER  PROBLEMS
 Joe Justice, an auto mechanic, doesn't see
 the sense of space experiments in the first
 place.  "The Government is having a hell of
 a time making ends meet on earth without
 going someplace else," he declares.
 Mike Kincaid, owner of KJSK, the local
 1,000-watt radio station, believes interservice
 squabbling is still holding up the U.S. mis-
 sile program.  He thinks it's time we got
 busy and got a man up there too.  And he's
 confident  we will eventually outstrip the
 Russians in space.
 Expressing similar confidence were three
 workers at the Behlen Manufacturing Co., a
 farmer and his helper who were repairing a
 corn crib, two housewives browsing in the
 J. C. Penney store, a pharmacist, and James
 Preston, manager of the Columbus Chamber
 of Commerce.
 And if a casual traveler through the pleas-
 ant streets of Columbus, Nebr., can claim a
 total impression it must be that confidence
 in America's ability to cope with this chal-
 lenge in space is both strong and deep,
 It could be, of course,  that Columbus,
 which found out how to make such a strong
 comeback itself, could be an exception.  Or
 it could be that the climate that permitted
 the ingenuity of its citizens full play is not
 much different from the climate in Liver-
 more, Calif., and Waterville, Maine.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. WILLIAM M. McCULLOCH
 OF OHIO
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, April 18, 1961
 Mr.   McCULLOCH.  Mr.   Speaker,
 each year the American Legion of Ohio
 promotes as essay contest among the
 high school students in Ohio.
 The subject assigned always has some
 connection with civic or governmental
 responsibility.
 This year the subject assigned was
 "The Constitution and What It Means."
 I am proud that the Fourth Congres-
 sional :District of Ohio is represented
 among the 12 winners selected this year.
 Miss Diana Dietrich of Laura, Ohio,
 is one of the ninth grade winners.  Her
 prize winning essay is as follows:
 THE  CONSTITUTION  AND  WHAT  IT  MEANS
 To fully develop your own character you
 .must know your country's character. There-
 fore it is necessary to understand our Con-
 stitution of the United States.  The Con-
 stitution of our country provides for the
 form  of government,  limits  the  Govern-
 ment's powers, and assures the rights and
 liberties of the citizens.   First, let's con-
 sider the history of our Constitution.
 The signing of the Declaration of Inde-
 pedence marked the birth of a new nation.
 In the period between the signing of the two
 documents, America had no centralized gov-
 ernment.  In 1778 the Articles of Confedera-
 tion were drawn. up by the Second Continen-
 tal Congress.  These articles left much to be
 desired.  There was no President, Vice Presi-
 dent,                                                                                                                                        or Supreme  Court.   Congress could
 make laws, but had no means of enforcing
 them.  In  September  1786,  commissioners
 from five States met at Annapolis.  This im-
 portant meeting soon led to the ratification
 of the Constitution by nine States on June 21,
 1778.  From this time on the Constitution
 became  the  supreme  law  of  the  United
 States. Many  people  agree this was the
 most important document    made     in  our
 history.
 What I like best about the Constitution is
 the soul and heart of it.  Unless our Con-
 stitution satisfies the feelings of our heart,
 unless it feeds the human soul, unless it.
 stirs our emotions, it cannot be regarded as
 an expression of the American spirit.  The
 most precious expression, next to the Bible,
 is the Constitution.  In the Bible we find our
 relationship  to God.   In the Constitution
 we find liberty, the next important thing in.
 life.   In  studying  the  Constitution every
 American can say with pride: "When danger
 threatens my life and liberty neither the
 President r..or Congress nor armies can enter
 and take away my life and liberty."    The
 soul of the Constitution is in every para-
 graph.  All the parts are mighty links that
 hind the people in an unbreakable chain of
 the Union.
 You need not be a a scholar to under-
 stand the basic principle of the Constitu-
 tion. Yes, it is important to know the laws
 and regulations, but not as much as know-
 ing it gives the three God-given rights: life,
 liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
 Let's consider the Preamble to the Con-
 stitution.   We  do not  know from  whose
 brain it came.  It is a great voice of the peo-
 ple, giving expression to their souls' desire.
 Summed up, the Preamble declares that our
 forefathers sought union, justice, tranqual-
 lity, safety, welfare, and liberty.  You should
 read the Preamble again and again.  As you
 read it, the words are most ardent hopes
 and the holiest feelings of the human heart.
 Times does not wear down nor eat away
 the truths of the Constitution.  War can-
 not overturn our liberty as long as Ameri-
 cans are worthy of their forefathers.   In-
 stead of fading with age, the glory of the
 Constitution will remain through the ages.
 May we guard our birthright and hand it
 down to our future generations as the "jewel
 of their soul.

 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Tuesday, April 18, 1961
 Mr. FLLBRIGHT.  Mr. President, an
 excellent editorial concerning the John
 Birch Society  appeared  in  the  Pine
 Bluff Commercial, a rather small daily
 newspaper in my State.   I think that
 this editorial hits the nail on the head

 was reaffirmed 100 years ago during the great
 crisis that threatened to destroy the Nation.
 On September 22, 1862, President Lincoln
 issued the Emancipation Proclamation free-
 ing the slaves from the bondage that had
 long been a glaring gap between the lofty
 idealism of America as the land of the free
 and the actual reality of everyday life in the
 young Republic.  It is small wonder that in
 the great world beyond our shores Abraham
 Lincoln is the best known President of the
 19th century; he was the man who reaf-
 firmed our  basic American, belief  in  the
 equality of mankind and man's natural right
 to freedom.
 In our own days, 100 years after Lincoln's
 stirring proclamation,  there still  exists a
 glaring gap between the political idealism
 we profess and the reality of American so-
 ciety. In deflaIce of clear and precise orders
 from the highest court in the land, a large
 segment of our population is still denied
 basic civil liberties and rights, thereby cre-
 ating a scandal in the world and giving our
 enemies  ammunition to  use  against us.
 Anyone who has traveled beyond our fron-
 tiers, well knows that tie first question a
 foreigner asks about the United States of
 America deals with the problem of discrim-
 ination.                  And we do not need to travel
 abroad to know that we have a desperate
 need to strengthen our heritage and to bol-
 ster our self-respect as a nation by closing
 the gap between our lofty aspirations and
 the political reality that so humiliates us.
 Our national mystique is as lofty and noble
 as any ever conceived by any people, but we
 must live up to these ideals if we are to be
 true to our destiny.
 The American Religious Town Hall of the
 Air represents a program of action committed
 to the proposition that Americans can best
 be educated to fulfill their responsibilities
 if they can have and hear free and frank
 discussions of the issues before the Nation.
 As an interreligious institution, including
 within its scope all facets of religious life
 in our land, the Religious Town Hall of the
 Air has brought to the radio and television
 audiences discussions of all sorts of religious,
 political, social, and economic issues, with
 emphasis upon the moral problems that are
 involved, and with ample opportunity for
 all points of view to ventilate opinions.  We
 believe that in this program we are helping
 to strengthen the determination of our fel-
 low citizens to defend and protect the ideals
 of civil and religious freedoms of our Nation.
 With this in mind we would like to suggest
 that it would be fitting for the Nation to
 pause for a review of the problems of equal
 rights for all citizens during the 100th anni-
 versary of the Emancipation Proclamation.
 Therefore, we of the Religious Town Hall
 of the Air urge other Americans interested
 in maintaining the moral tone of our Na-
 tion to join us in an appeal to the President
 of the United States for the proclamation
 of a new national frontier of freedom and
 equality  during  the  centenary  of  the
 Emancipation Proclamation.        Let us join to-
 gether to expel the remnants of intolerance,
 tyranny and oppression, and let us renew
 our faith in our national         mystique that
 honors liberty, equality, and opportunity for
 all by declaring the period from July 4 to
 September 22,  1962  as a national jubilee
 commemorating the liberation of the in-
 alienable rights of all men.

 "Hope" Comes to Indonesia
 EX 1 NSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. WILLIAM S. MAILLIARD
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, April 18, 1961
 Mr.                                       MAILLIARD.  Mr.  Speaker,  I
 know many of my colleagues share my
 great personal interest in project Hope.
 Accordingly, I call their attention to the
 following article appearing in the San
 Francisco News-Call Bulletin on April 1,
 1961:
 "HOPE" COMES TO  INDONESIA-NATIVES  HAIL
 CHAPLAIN OF HOSPITAL SHIP
 (By the Reverend  William P. Anna, Jr.,
 rector of Zion parish, diocese of Washing-
 ton)
 (The Reverend William P. Anna, Jr., an
 Episcopal                 priest,  is Protestant  chaplain
 aboard the steamship Hope.  This San Fran-
 cisco-based hospital ship, financed by pub-
 lic contributions and Government help, is
 spending a year in the South Seas.                It treats
 native patients aboard and ashore; its staff
 teaches nurses and doctors.  How the Hope
 has become a symbol of international hope
 is told in Father Anna's article.)
 ABOARD SS "HOPE."-The first greeting I got
 in Indonesia was from a 10-year-old boy.
 The Hope had been at sea almost 3 weeks
 out from Honolulu.  It was Sunday.     She
 was  docking  at Balikpappan  in   Borneo,
 during the 7 o'clock communion service.
 After the service, I went ashore.  As I
 stepped onto the dock, the boy came up.  I
 greeted him in what I believed was idomatic
 Indonesian we had studied evenings on the
 voyage.  "Salamat  pagi,"  I  said.  "Good
 morning."
 In very intelligible English, the lad re-
 plied:  "Good morning, Pastor.  Thank you
 very much.  Welcome to Indonesia. We are
 glad to see you. We like to practice our
 American."
 The language barrier, I discovered, is not
 at all impossible.  Ours is studied in their
 high schools and universities, their second
 language.
 Indonesian contains no conjugation or de-
 clensions.  Man is                                                                              "orang";  men, "orang-
 orang."
 By the time  we     reached Djakarta,  the
 ship's hospital was in order, ready for busi-
 ness.
 Twenty nurses from the training center at
 Bandoeng were with us, and 30 other nurses
 are with us for 6 months.  They will form
 the nucleus of the teaching staff for the new
 Thu Sukarno Hospital in Djakarta, where a
 nursing ,academy will be established.
 I went out to the theological seminary to
 talk with the student body. The faculty is
 American, Dutch, Filipino and Indonesian.
 I learned quickly, I hope, never to preach
 to them nor lecture them.  Just answer their
 questions.   And  the questions  about the
 Hope and its purpose were sharp.
 "Tell us about your church in America?"
 they asked. "Tell us about your home and
 family?"  In the end, I told them almost
 every detail, even about our dogs.
 "We like you," they said.  "We like Amer-
 ican people.  We like America.  We do not
 understand American policy."
 I certainly learned more about Indonesia
 than I have been able to tell them about
 America.
 The most unexpected call of the first half
 of our tour was Sumbawa, a primitive and
 sparsely populated island, but seemingly rich
 in resources.
 We stopped in a well-protected anchorage
 to go ashore.
 There is only one doctor on the whole
 island, a German from Stuttgart who came
 here after his retirement to spend the rest
 of his medical career working in a place that
 otherwise would be without a physician.
 Our work was well organized.  Soon the
 hospital was full.  A clinic, set up ashore in
 a  warehouse,  operated  at  full capacity.
 Ninety-eight operations were performed by
 our surgeons in 2 weeks. A German surgeon
 aboard did a fantastic number of cataract
 operations, and for these he is especially well
 qualified.
 The gratitude of one old man surpassed
 anything I have seen, and it was rather a
 symbol of what makes our medical project
 real.
 He came on the first day.  Constantly, he
 asked, "Am I next?"  All he was praying for
 was to be able to see the outline of his
 family.
 I was going down the aisle in the ward
 just before he was to go to the operating
 room.  He pulled my shirt.  "They say I am
 next," he said; and they rolled him off the
 cart, rejoicing.
 The last day in Sumbawa they had a final
 reception and lunch for the staff.
 There he was, standing at the edge of
 the crowd, and repeating again and again,
 "Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you."
 A Responsible Study To Advance Free-
 dom-Against Communism
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 or
 HON. WILLIAM PROXMIRE
 OF WISCONSIN
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Tuesday, April 18, 1961
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, the
 problem of alerting the American people
 to the significance of freedom and the
 danger of communism is far too impor-
 tant to be left to the crackpots.
 The fact is that communism is on the
 march in the world.  Freedom has been
 on the defensive.  Too few Americans
 care deeply  about freedom.  The op-
 pressive nature of communism is far too
 little understood.
 For these reasons, it was heartening
 to read of a responsible and constructive
 attempt to meet this need.  An article
 in a recent issue of the Milwaukee Jour-
 nal reports on the efforts of a group
 sponsored by corporations, and several
 foundations, to do this.  Educational
 and Federal Government leaders met
 and worked with this group.
 I ask unanimous consent that this
 article be printed in the Appendix of the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 IT IS NOT CONSERVATISM
 (By Raymond Moley)
 Five weeks ago I noted in this space the
 rapid growth of conservative groups on many
 college  campuses.  That  manifestation  of
 dissent from prevailing liberal thinking, to-
 gether with the evidence that conservatism
 is growing among older people as well, is a
 wholesome sign.  It offers a promise that
 our two-party system and our national elec-
 tions will be real contests of opposing polit-
 ical philosophies.   And  the  fact  that  so
 many young people are in the movement
 indicates that the coming generation real-
 izes more than ever the burdens and debts
 which it will inherit :from the altogether
 too spendthrift governments we have had
 since the war.
 The perils that threaten this growth of
 conservatism will come, not from its liberal
 opposition but from those who in the name
 of conservatism would bring  discredit by
 igniting passions against their neighbors,
 besmirching good Americans as friends and
 dupes  of  communism,  and   by  adopting
 methods of organization which should be
 alien in this country. One such threat is
 the John Birch Society and the utterances
 and activities of its founder, Robert Welch,
 and some of the leaders in the group.
 I have watched the growth of this society
 with the deepest regret and misgivings es-
 pecially because so many sincere people have
 become members of it and risk their good
 names through association with its more
 radical spokesmen.  Those who are devoted
 to sound conservative principles owe it to
 themselves and their true objectives to re-
 pudiate the John Birch Society and methods
 as I do here.
 COMMUNISM AND CRIME
 As I have noted the writings of Robert
 Welch over the               past decade I have  seen
 the transformation of a man who in the
 beginning spoke out against a certain blind-
 ness in our foreign policies to the real nature
 of the international Communist conspiracy
 and the danger embodied in the presence
 in our Government and society of elements
 of communism.  Well before Welch appeared
 on the scene I advocated in this space and
 before a congressional committee the out-
 lawing  of  the                         Communist  party  in  the
 United States. That objective has substan-
 tially been accomplished although it must
 be recognized that elements of that con-
 spiracy still lurk in our midst.  It is the
 responsibility of our Government and indeed
 of all of us to expose and eliminate such
 elements by due process of law, just as we
 would deal with the criminally inclined ele-
 ments of other sorts.
 But opposition to communism as a crim-
 inal activity is not confined solely to con-
 servatives.  Individuals  of  all  shades  of
 ideology  share  the  conservative's fear of
 communism. In fact, it was to a degree
 due to the warnings of American socialists
 that this Nation was sharply made aware
 of  the   danger.  Because    Norman Thomas
 and I agree that communism is our enemy
 at home and abroad does not make us ideo-
 logical brothers.
 UNFORTUNATE METHODS
 The evidence is now before us through
 the enterprise of the press and the state.
 ments  of                Members  of Congress  that  the
 John Birch  Society, has so  concentrated
 its attention on communism and has become
 so vehement in its pursuit of that one issue
 that it has adopted methods and has made
 statements which must bring it into general
 disrepute.  Specifically, Americans do not
 like the terms "monolithic" or "authoritar-
 ian" as applied to any American group or
 society.  They resent loose and inaccurate
 name calling especially when applied to
 Presidents and other high officials who are
 charged by the people with responsibility
 for their protection.  They don't like the
 idea of "infiltrating" various worthy organ-
 izations in our society.
 I need not elaborate  upon  these facts.
 They were documented by Senator MILTON
 YOUNG of North Dakota in the CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD of March 20.
 For a good many years I have specified
 those mistaken policies of Government under
 the name liberal which tend to limit the
 liberty of the individual, weaken the fiber
 of America and its institutions, and endan-
 ger national solvency.  A belief in dynamic
 growth through individual enterprise con-
 stitutes a true conservatism.  It is endan-
 gered by those who assume the livery of
 conservatism,  but adopt radical  methods.
 Peace Corps Relationship With the Selec-
 tive Service System Explained by Lt.
 Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, Director of the
 Selective Service System
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. RICHARD BOLLING
 OF MISSOURI
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, April 18, 1961
 Mr. BOLLING.                               Mr. Speaker, the fol-
 lowing article appeared on page 1 of the
 April 1961 issue of Selective Service, the
 official publication of the Selective Serv-
 ice System:
 PEACE CORPS RELATIONSHIP WITH SELECTIVE
 SERVICE SYSTEM  EXPLAINED
 (By Lt.                   Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, Director,
 Selective Service System)
 The Peace Corps has been established by
 Executive order of the President.  Legisla-
 tion has been requested to continue this
 organization.  The  activities of the Peace
 Corps have been covered rather completely
 by the press, radio, and television. Its rela-
 tionship with the Selective Service System
 has been indicated but a statement of this
 relationship seems advisable.
 The Universal Military Training and Serv-
 ice Act, as amended, is flexible enough to
 provide deferment for members of the Peace
 Corps without amendment of any kind.  In
 other words the relationship of the Selective
 Service System with registrants who become
 members of the Peace Corps can be han-
 dled administratively.
 The power to defer registrants who per-
 form  functions  in  the  national  health,
 safety, or interest now exists.  The estab-
 lishment and operation of the Peace Corps
 is in the national interest.  So the classifi-
 cation of registrants in the Peace Corps can
 be handled as any other registrant engaged
 in activities in the national health, safety,
 or interest.  They will, of course, enjoy the
 right to appeal shared by all registrants of
 the Selective Service System.
 These statements presuppose the continu-
 ance of the present situation of the United
 States in relations with other nations'of the
 world.
 The question has been raised as to the
 status of registrants who enroll in the Peace
 Corps, after their return from this assign-
 ment.  This requires the assumption as to
 the situation of this Nation in the world,
 the age of the registrant when he returns,
 the physical co d-lion of the registrant with
 reference to his acceptability for military
 service, his marital status, and the regula-
 tions which apply in existence at the time
 of his release from the Peace Corps, and
 whether or not the registrant on his return
 from service with the Peace Corps engages
 in an activity which permits him to be de-
 ferred  in the  national  health,  safety,  or
 interest.
 The fact that the registrant has been a
 member of the Peace Corps will not prevent
 him from qualifying for :further deferment,
 the same as any other registrant who is en-
 gaged  in- activities  vital  to  the  national
 health, safety, or interest.

 HON. HUBERT H. HUMPHREY

 Tuesday, April 18, 1961
 Mr. HUMPHREY,  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that a declara-
 tion by the American Religious Town
 Hall Meeting, Inc., calling on the Presi-
 dent of the United States to proclaim
 a "new national frontier of freedom and
 equality," be printed in. the Appendix of
 the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the declara-

 RECORD, as follows:
 A DECLARATION BY THE AMERICAN RELIGIOUS
 TOWN HALL MEETING, INC., CALLING ON THE
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES To PRO-
 CLAIM  A  "NEW FRONTIER OF  FREEDOM,"  A
 NATIONAL   JUBILEE  COMMEMORATING THE
 INALIENABLE RIGHTS                             OF ALL MEN DURING
 THE   100TH   ANNIVERSARY   OF PRESIDENT
 LINCOLN'S                             EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION
 At this time when our liberal-democratic
 society is confronted by dangerous enemies
 abroad whose intention is to destroy our
 way of life and to dominate the course of
 human history, it well behooves America
 to look closely to the springs of her culture,
 to the sources of her liberty.  Every society
 expresses its highest aspirations, its con-
 ception of civilized man and his destiny, and
 its hopes for the future, in the idealism of
 its founders.  These goals, aspirations, hopes
 and ideals can be called the mystique of the
 society; ours has been boldly expressed in
 great  documents,  stirring  orations  and
 beautiful poetry that has warmed the hearts
 of millions.  We all known only too well
 that it is difficult to realize all these social
 goals  in actual  practice;  nonetheless, a
 society is judged by the gap that exists be-
 tween the ideals of constitutional govern-
 ment it proclaims, and the political. reality
 of everyday life.  It is on this level that our
 enemies attack us in the forum of the world;
 they compare our lofty idealism with some
 of the sordid problems that mar our every-
 day life. It is to be noted also that they
 compare  our  problems,  particularly  the
 questions of  civil  equality  and economic
 opportunity, with the idealism, that is, the
 mystiques of  communism:       They carefully
 avoid comparing the realities of social life
 in the United States of America with that of
 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
 Our liberal-democratic political idealism
 has been proclaimed for the world to hear
 by  Franklin,  Paine,  Jefferson,  Hamilton,
 Adams, Jackson, and a host of other states-
 men and philosophers who assisted in the
 founding of the Republic.  That mystique

 Higher Postal Rates Are Needed
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. FRANK J. LAUSCHE
 OF OHIO
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Tuesday, April 18, 1961
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  Mr. President, is it
 not worth a nickel to mail ii- letter to
 your old Aunt Hepsibah in California?
 Is it not worth 8 cents to fly a letter to
 Maine? These two questions have been
 raised and other comments have been
 made in an editorial supporting the
 Postmaster General's recommendation
 for postal increases in order to help re-
 duce the annual $800 million deficit.
 This editorial appeared in the April 15,
 1961, edition of the Cleveland, Ohio,
 Plain Dealer.  I ask unanimous consent
 that the editorial be printed in the Ap-
 pendix of the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 HIGHER POSTAL RATES, ARE NEEDED
 When the total U.S. postal deficit amounts
 to more than $800 million a year, Postmaster
 General J. Edward Day has every reason to
 seek to reduce this deficit, and every Ameri-
 can ought to be willing to accept the re-
 quested rate increases in good spirit.  The
 $741 million a year increase requested of Con-
 gress will not permit the postal service to
 break even, but it will cut down the loss to
 a great extent.
 After all, where can you buy so much serv-
 ice for your money?  Isn't it worth a nickel
 to mail a letter to your old Aunt Hepsibah in
 California?  Isn't it worth 8 cents to fly a
 letter to Maine?  Isn't it worth 4 cents to
 send a surface postcard or 6 cents to send a
 postcard by airmail?
 It will be noted by those who study the
 new rates that books and publishers' second-
 class matter, which includes newspapers and
 magazines, are in for some sort of increase,
 for, according to the Associated Press, the
 proposal would increase the rates of "all
 other classes of mail."  This, at any rate,
 should preclude the receipt of letters saying.
 "Naturally you're for higher postal rates-
 you won't be affected."                  To what extent we
 shall be affected we do not know at this
 moment, but we have said before-and we
 repeat: We are perfectly willing to pay any
 increase  in  postal  rates  the  Government
 thinks we should pay.
 Actually, the larger the  newspaper,     the
 smaller the percentage of its mail circula-
 tion.   American Newspaper Publishers As-
 sociation figures show that of papers over
 100,000 circulation, only 5.7 percent of this
 circulation uses the mails, whereas in papers
 under 5,000  circulation, 28.2 percent goes
 through the mails.
 Perhaps one reason Uncle Sam has been
 moderate in increasing mail rates for news-
 papers (outside of the perfectly obvious one
 that he thinks it valuable to have citizens
 well-informed)   is  that  the newspapers,
 themselves,  give him a lot of help, even
 though paying full rates for services  not
 rendered.    Some 83.3 percent of all copies
 of daily newspapers in second-class mail are
 sorted by the newspapers, arranged in sacks
 or packages by the  newspapers,  delivered
 to railroad stations or post offices by the
 newspapers,  thus  eliminating     sorting  or
 other handling by postal employees.
 Since we too shall be affected, we can, in
 good  conscience,  applaud the  Postmaster
 General's wise plan to put the Post Office
 Department on a more businesslike basis-
 and we hope Congress will give him what
 he asks.
 Moral Principles Have To Be Revived
 HON. WILLIAM H. BATES
 OF.MASSACHUSETTS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, April 18, 1961
 Mr. BATES.  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Julius
 Szygowski, representative of the Polish
 Government in exile, has written a time-
 ly letter under the heading of "Moral
 Principles Have To Be Revived."  I be-
 lieve                                                                     the  cause  of  liberty       will  be
 strengthened by calling nationwide at-
 tention to this excellent document, and
 under leave to extend my remarks in the
 RECORD, I submit the following state-
 ment by Dr. Szygowski:
 The disquieting turn of events upon the
 international  arena  makes  it  ever  more
 urgent to reassess western policy with regard
 to Russia and her ruthless methods.    The
 truth must be faced and the admission made
 that so far the behavior of the Western
 Powers towards Russia and her political aims
 has ben marked by vacillation and mistakes,
 even by moral shortcomings.  As an out-
 come, public opinion has the deeply rooted
 impression that the Western World cannot
 cope with Russia and is defenseless against
 the progressive expansion of international
 communism.
 The process which has brought about
 these pernicious consequences is not of re-
 cent origin.
 It cannot be denied that many lofty ideals
 proclaimed  by  the  Western  Powers  were
 abandoned.  Many agreements for assuring
 the fate of minor nations were not honored,
 and many war aims were jettisoned.
 All this took place gradually, until the
 Western  World's     moral  position offered
 rather gloomy perspectives before the sub-
 jugated and other countries.
 There is a small wonder that in this moral
 and political climate, Russian affirmations
 that the Western World will gradually be
 forced by pacific means to submit to the
 Communist world, superior to it in every
 field, are beginning to acquire an air of prob-
 ability  especially  in  the  eyes  of  various
 masses of Asian and African populations.
 On the other hand, the memory of vari-
 ous accomplished facts so  detrimental   to
 different nations lives forever in the minds
 of people and in the pages of history, serv-
 ing us a warning not to believe in the words
 of those who once have broken them.
 The elevated and equitable principles for-
 mulated for the postwar world in the At-
 lantic Charter and later incorporated within
 the Charter of the United Nations Organiza-
 tion remained only upon paper.
 Soviet Russia understands well this moral
 weakness of the West and takes proper ad-
 vantage of it.  And so, Khrushchev's obvi-
 ous aim is to undermine the authority and
 prestige of the governments, systems, and
 ideologies of the Western democracies.  He
 tries to destroy this not only among the
 Western peoples, not only among the captive
 nations living in hope that the West will
 help to liberate them, but also among the
 people of the newly  formed  African   and
 Asian state entities.
 CASE OF POLAND
 Lack of broadly conceived political vision,
 a decline in morality with regard to other
 countries and in the sense of obligation to
 honor agreements on the part of the West
 are nowhere more evident than in its atti-
 tude to Poland, its most loyal ally and holder
 of a prime key position in Europe.
 The  Ribbentrop-Molotov  agreement  of
 August 1939 for a new partition of Poland
 should have helped the West to see through
 Russia, while the latter's invasion of Poll d
 on September 17 of the same year should
 have opened eyes to Russia's chief purpose,
 i.e., to the spreading of communism west-
 wards.
 Immediately after the Germans attacked
 her on June 22, 1941, and she had to seek
 salvation in Western aid, Russia was obliged
 to conclude agreement (signed on July 30
 and December 4, 1941) with the Polish Gov-
 ernment, then in London.  She announced
 in this that the German-Soviet treaties for
 the partition of Poland (of 1939) were con-
 sidered null and void.
 Yet Russia did not for a single moment
 hold  up efforts to undermine the  Polish
 Republic from within and from without, nor
 cease to lay insistent claim to Poland's east-
 ern provinces.  The Western Powers failed at
 the time to assess the danger facing the
 whole democratic world, they gave Poland no
 proper support against Soviet designs, thus
 opening the way for the Communist west-
 ward drive.
 It was in October 1943 that Great Britain,
 the United States, Russia, and China agreed
 under paragraph 6 of their security decla-
 ration drawn up at a conference in Moscow
 that a Soviet administration would take over
 Polish territories in measure as war opera-
 tions proceeded.  Here it must be stressed
 that  the  Polish Government  in  London,
 though an ally in good standing and obvi-
 ously a party most directly affected, was
 neither invited to the conference nor in-
 formed of this decision.
 On Stalin's demand and chiefly with the
 support of President F. D. Roosevelt, it was
 definitively decided at the Teheran Confer-
 ence in November 1943-again without the
 knowledge of the allied Polish Government
 in London-that in the allocation of occupa-
 tion zones, i.e., future spheres of influence,
 Russia's share would embrace all Poland and
 Hungary, a large part of Germany, and part
 of Austria.
 It  was  only  later,  at  the  Yalta  Con-
 ference held on 4-11 February, 1945, that
 formal  agreement  was  reached     between
 Great Britain, the United States, and the
 Soviet Union regarding the annexation of
 nearly half of Poland's territory by Russia
 who would also have absolute control over
 the rest of Poland.
 It can be safely stated that most of the
 world perturbations and the menace to se-
 curity  in general undoubtedly stem from
 this hardly creditable transaction.  It de-
 cisively helped to shift the balance of power
 between  the  two  incompatible  worlds  in
 favor of the  Russian  communistic    impe-
 rialism.
 All this could have been avoided but not
 being so, the Western  World had to pay
 dearly for the subsequent consequences.
 KATYN WOOD MASSACRE
 As mentioned before, Russia on July 30,
 1941,   declared   the Ribbentrop-Molotov
 agreement of 1939 null and void and in the
 same time concluded the treaty with the
 Polish Government in London, whereby dip-
 lomatic relations were resumed.  This, how-
 ever, did not hinder Russia from continuing
 to prepare Communist administrative and
 military cadres which were to seize  in  a
 proper time all civil and military authority
 in Poland.
 But after 21 months, Soviet Russia broke
 off  (on April 26, 1943)  relations with the
 Polish Government in London as a first step
 to securing a free hand.  The pretext for
 this unusual step toward an ally in time
 of   war  was  an  exceedingly  flimsy  one:
 namely,   Poland  had  requested  an  inves-
 tigation into the massacre of several thou-
 sands of Polish officers in the Soviet Union,
 in Katyn Wood near Smolensk.
 On April 15, 1943, the Polish Government
 applied to the International Committee of
 the Red Cross asking it to appoint a dele-
 gation to investigate the case on the spot.

 A25 i!                  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX
 S  in thereupon wrote personal letters to
 President Roosevelt and to Mr. Churchill
 on April 21, 1943, accusing the Germans of
 this mass murder of Polish  officers.  The
 Western Powers ostensibly accepted the So-
 viet version and, judging by the documents
 published to date, refrained from alluding
 to this  crime at any major international
 conference, at Teheran, Yalta, Potsdam, or
 on any latter occasion.
 In the U.S. House of Representatives a
 resolution  was  passed  on  May  18,  1951,
 whereby a Committee for the Investigation
 of the Katyn Murder was set up with Hon,
 RAY J. MADDEN as chairman.  Detailed evi-
 dence was collected and the committee filed
 its final report on December 22, 1952, with
 the following recommendations:  (1)  that
 the U.S. President issue instructions to the
 U.S. Delegate at the United Nations Organ-
 ization to present the Katyn case to the
 General Assembly;  (2) that the President
 request that the General Assembly seek ac-
 tion before the International Court of Jus-
 tice against the U.S.S.R. for committing the
 massacre; and (3) that the President Instruct
 the U.S. delegation to seek the establish-
 ment of a temporary U.N. Commission which
 would investigate mass murders and crimes
 against humanity.
 Since then, however, nothing has been
 done.  It can be safely stated that the atti-
 tude of the Western Powers with regard to
 the Katyn massacre does not reflect credit
 upon them nor raise their prestige.
 The rupture of diplomatic relations with
 Poland,  because  Polish  Government  re-
 quested the International Red Cross to in-
 vestigate the Katyn massacre, was deemed
 necessary by Stalin not only for the realiza-
 tion of his underhand plans against that
 country but also for his longer designs
 against the whole democratic world.
 FOREIGN OCCUPATION OF POLAND
 This whole unfriendly attitude of Western
 Powers toward Poland and disregard of the
 international law, allowed Stalin to realize
 his plans.           In measure as Germans evacu-
 ated Polish soil before the advancing So-
 viet forces, Stalin handed over the civil ad-
 ministration of Poland to his stooge organi-
 zation, the so-called "Polish Committee of
 National Liberation" very soon proclaimed as
 the government of the country.  It cannot
 be too strongly stressed that this alleged
 government could not be and was not a
 Polish government in the legal and Con-
 stitutional sense.  It was nothing but a po-
 litical tool in the hands of the Kremlin.
 The German administration of rump Po-
 land during the occupation (1939-45)  was
 directed by a German governor-general in
 Cracow.  Craftier Communist Russia has
 camouflaged her occupation of Poland by
 ruling through "the Government of the Po-
 lish People's Republic" in Warsaw but com-
 posed for the most part  of Communist
 graduates of the Moscow school.  Both sys-
 tems, of course, can be regarded merely as
 the administrative organs of a foreign oc-
 cupation.  The  only difference, that the
 German occupation never claimed to be any-
 thing else whilst that of the Russians is
 more skillfully and  cunningly  devised.
 Stalin succeeded even to obtain the re-
 spectability for his administration in Poland
 by assuring its legal status upon the in-
 ternational forum.  And again, this success
 will be found to derive from the weakness
 and  imprudence  of the representative  of
 Anglo-American policy at the Yalta Confer-
 ence.  Thus, Poland has been given, against
 her will, the status of a Russian satellite.
 CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT OF
 POLAND-IN EXILE
 In virtue of the Polish constitution and,
 hence, of the International law, there ex-
 ists                  the  legal  and constitutional Polish
 Government (in exile) in London, England.
 It works and acts abroad for the reestab-
 lishment  of Poland's freedom and inde-
 pendence.  Realizing that in our times the
 liberation of Poland has to be based upon
 a broader scheme which would help other
 eastern-central European nations to regain
 their freedom, the Polish Government  (in
 exile) deems that the following points ob-
 viously merit an  examination:  (The be-
 low described plan has been repeatedly pre-
 sented to the Governments of Western de-
 mocracies  by  the  Polish  Government                                                                                       in
 exile since October 1955; however there has
 been no favorable reaction at this time.)
 1. It is an essential condition for security
 in Europe and (owing to this continent's
 key position) to the whole world to estab-
 lish such a state of affairs that could elimi-
 nate or at least seriously hinder any direct
 clash of the war potentials.  This could be
 attained by linking together the countries
 of Europe within a United States of Europe.
 Until nations of Europe become ripe for
 this, it is necessary to seek some inter-
 mediate solution.
 2. The solution of this problem should be
 sought in the creation of a neutral zone be-
 tween East and West.  It would embrace
 countries neighboring with Russia and now
 subjected by her: Estonia, Latvia, Lithu-
 ania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and
 Rumania.  The setting up of such a neutral
 zone on sound political, economic and mili-
 tary foundations would produce a favorable
 basis for a durable arrangement of peaceful
 relations in Europe.
 3. This neutral zone in east-central. Eu-
 rope should be created on the basis of an ac-
 cord concluded on the one hand by all the
 member-countries as sovereign states, free
 of any foreign military occupation and for-
 eign-imposed governments, and on the other
 hand, by all the powers interested in the
 maintenance of world peace.  The countries
 of the neutral zone should bind themselves
 not to join any warlike blocs and not to
 conclude any military alliances with coun-
 tries outside the neutral zone.  The powers
 not belonging to the neutral zone and inter-
 ested in maintaining world peace, including
 a united Germany and Soviet Russia, would
 jointly guarantee the frontiers of the neu-
 tral zone countries so that, in case of ag-
 gression from East or West, all the guarantors
 would automatically become the allies of the
 neutral-zone lands in defense against such
 an aggression.  Such a situation would un-
 doubtedly become an element arresting any
 kind of aggressive design from whichever
 direction it may come.
 4. The neutral zone so conceived would
 not act as a barrier separating East from
 West, but would preeminently serve as an
 intermediary and liaison between them in
 the ideological, cultural and economic fields.
 Those member countries of the neutral zone
 who have for centuries past been so wronged
 by both Russia and Germany, would grad-
 ually lose memory of this painful past, the
 bitterness felt toward these neighbors would
 die out little by little and could in the fu-
 ture become transformed into a loyalinter-
 national collaboration based on sincere, nat-
 ural amity.
 5. The  relations  between  the  member-
 states of the neutral zone in east-central
 Europe would best be based on a, sun generis
 confederate agreement. Such a union of in-
 dependent states, adequately armed for the
 defense of its neutrality and guaranteed by
 the other powers, would provide full assur-
 ance for the maintenance of peace in Europe
 and hence facilitate this in the whole world.
 Only under such conditions would the ques-
 tion of disarmament acquire current signifi-
 cance, and only then could the huge sums
 now uneconomically expanded be devoted to
 the good of humanity.
 6. The problem of the unification of Ger-
 many can really be reduced to that of lib-
 eration of East Germany from Soviet occu-
 pation.   Once  such  a  zone  of  neutral
 April 18
 countries is created between Russia and
 Germany, with East Germany west of ' this
 zone, unification of the two German repub-
 lics would probably be immediate and auto-
 matic.  Hence, it can be said that the prob-
 lem                                                                                                                                    of the unification  of Germany  is  a
 function of the general problem of security.
 7. In order to accomplish this, the West-
 ern Powers should regain the political ini-
 tiative at all. costs.  Under the present cir-
 cumstances, this could be achieved solely
 by presenting Russia with the demand for
 a far-reaching revision of the situation she
 has brought about by dint of violence, un-
 derhand methods and the violation of in-
 ternational.  agreements.   Russia's  acts  to
 the plain detriment of the weaker nations
 should be disavowed and denounced forth-
 with.                                                                                                                                    It is necessary firmly to demand the
 immediate and unconditional liberation of
 the captive nations, and the righting of all
 the wrongs inflicted upon them.  But again
 at this point it should be cited that the
 Western democracies failed  (a)  to guaran-
 tee the existing frontiers between Germany
 and Poland (b) to initiate talks about the
 organization of eastern-central Europe, thus
 giving Mr. Khrushchev an opportunity to
 bring up these two problems at the U.N.
 General Assembly in September 1960 In such
 a way as to further his own interests.  The
 hypocritical  and  brutal  ideology  of the
 Communist world should be countered by a
 clearly formulated, broadly conceived ideol-
 ogy based upon the moral, principle of the
 truth that equal rights are due both to
 strong and to weak nations.
 It is worthwhile to mention that the re-
 cent "14  points  accord"  of  Gov.  N.  A.
 Rockefeller and Vice  President  Richard
 Nixon st_.,essed the necessity "of leading and
 inspiring the formation in all great regions
 of the free world of confederations, large
 enough and strong enough to meet modern
 problems and. challenges," and suggested
 that  "we   fthe  United   States]   should
 promptly lead toward the formation of such
 confederations in the North Atlantic Com-
 munity sand in the Western Hemisphere."
 In applauding this idea, such remarks
 seem to be proper: the more precise and
 definite are the plans of the Western de-
 mocracies,  the  greater  the  determination
 they show in. the realization of these plans,
 the greater their pressure toward this end
 and  the greater their solidarity  in  such
 action, the sooner and the more certainly
 will it be possible to establish a system of
 relations that will enable mankind to enter
 upon the road of lasting peaceful develop-
 ment, and assure Europe the possibility of
 real unification.
 And this must be done---before it is too
 late.  A two-power world can never be at
 gence.~

 Facts Pave the Way to Truth
 The need for Federal FEPC legislation is
 President Kennedy Rightly Urges Creative
 painfully evident. The 17 States which have
 such legislation on their books (and Penn-              Thinking by TVA
 Sylvania since 1955 is one)  are hopelessly
 hamstrung in obtaining adequate enforce-
 ment where interstate commerce is involved,
 as it is in such a large percentage of com-
 mercial   employment   situations.   Thirty-
 three States with almost 80 million people
 are outside the coverage of any FEPC legis-
 lation today.
 With unemployment in the United States
 at about 7 percent of the total labor force
 in February, nonwhite unemployment stood
 at a staggering 15 percent, a rate that would
 never be tolerated if it applied across the
 board.  But this discrepancy is not limited to
 recessions.   Unemployment  among  non-
 whites runs just about double the rate for
 whites at all times according to the Bureau
 of Labor Statistics.
 Among the employed, the pattern of dis-
 crimination is less apparent, but no less real.
 In the occupational structure of our society,
 positions as managers, officials, executives
 and proprietors are held at 14 percent of all
 white male workers, but only 2 percent of all
 Negro male workers.  Over 10 percent of all
 white male workers are in professional and
 technical occupations; less than 3 percent of
 all Negro male workers.  Over 33 percent of
 all white female workers are in clerical oc-
 cupations.  Only 8 percent of all Negro fe-
 male workers have gained access to clerical
 work.
 The difference in wage rates is' no less
 startling. The Department of Commerce re-
 ports that in 1957 the average wage or sal-
 ary of a white person was $3,775; of a non-
 white $1,845.   This deficiency in earnings
 for Negroes as a class is said to total a stag-
 gering $12 billion per year.  Granting exist-
 ing differences in educational opportunities
 and trained skills these statistics still estab-
 lish a substantial differential based on racial
 prejudice.
 The bill which Congressman Celler and I
 have drafted would make racial discrimina-
 tion in hiring, promotion, and firing, an un-
 fair labor practice for which administrative
 and ultimately judicial sanctions would be
 available.  The proposed law, which would
 be administered by a 5-man Fair Employ-
 ment, Practices Commission, would apply to
 all  employers, business or labor organiza-
 tions, who are engaged in interstate com-
 merce or operations affecting such commerce
 and employ more than 50 persons.
 While the roadblocks to such legislation
 in the Congress under our archaic and un-
 democratic rules of procedure are substan-
 tial, we are hopeful that this bill will pass
 the 87th Congress before it finally adjourns
 in 196.   I am confident that these meas-
 ures will ultimately have the all-out support
 of the administration.   The only question
 is one of timing.
 It was President Kennedy who stated last
 fall that "Freedom Is indivisible, in all its
 aspects.  To provide equal rights for all re-
 quires that we respect the liberties of speech
 and belief and assembly, guaranteed by the
 Constitution, and these liberties in turn are
 hollow mockeries unless they are maintained
 also by a decent economic life.  Those who
 are unemployed, or too poor, uninformed, or
 too uneducated to enjoy their constitutional
 freedoms of choice, do not really possess
 those freedoms."

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS    -
 OF
 HON. LEONARD FARBSTEIN
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, April 13, 1961
 Mr. FARBSTEIN.  Mr. Speaker, Mr.
 John Crosby, columnist of the New York
 Herald Tribune, recently in one of his
 articles referred to the fight against the
 program "The Untouchables" in a man-
 ner which was interpreted as maligning
 persons of Italian origin.  Representing
 as I do the 19th Congressional District
 in which there are a great number of
 persons of Italian origin who are con-
 tributing to the success of the great city
 of New York and to the development of
 our country, I can attest to the contribu-
 tions made by this segment of our popu-
 lation.
 I deplore the references by Mr. Crosby
 and believe that his statements are
 divisive.   The Americans of  Italian
 origin are aroused by this column, and
 an indication of the resentment of per-
 sons of Italian origin to the unfair refer-
 ences can be gleaned by an article pub-
 lished in the Il Progresso on Sunday,
 March 26, 1961. The resentment of the
 Italian-Americans has been manifested
 against the program "The Untouch-
 ables" by pickets, boycotts, and concili-
 atory conferences.  The leading organi-
 zations in this fight to eliminate the un-
 fair stereotyping of Americans of Italian
 origin were the Federation of the Itali-
 an-American Democratic Organizations
 of the State of New York, Inc., the Sons
 of Italy, the Columbian Association, and
 the National Italian-American League
 to Combat Defamation.
 The column published by the Il Pro-
 gresso sets forth the contributions by
 persons of Italian origin through the
 years, during the wars and defense of our
 country, and in the promotion of our
 economy and our country.  This article
 answers fully any statements made by
 Mr. Crosby and any unfair inferences
 which might be derived from a reading
 of his article.  The open letter to Mr.
 Crosby which was published on Sunday,
 March 26, 1961, follows.  I am certain
 that the reading public will draw the
 proper conclusions after reading this
 open letter:
 AN  OPEN  LETTER  TO  A  COLUMNIST                                                                    OF  THE

 episodes of the television series would re-
 frain from using Italian names for its fic-
 tional characters of hoodlums and delin-
 quents.  And you decry that "one more na-

 the ranks of villainy."  Of course your feel-
 ings are completely at variance with those
 of the great majority of Americans who re-

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOE L. EVINS
 OF TENNESSEE
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, April 11, 1961
 Mr. EVINS.                              Mr.  Speaker,  under
 unanimous consent, I include in the
 Appendix of the RECORD an editorial en-
 titled "President Rightly Urges Creative
 Thinking by TVA," which appeared in
 the Nashville Tennessean of March 29,
 last.
 The editorial follows:
 PRESIDENT  RIGHTLY  URGES  CREATIVE
 THINKING BY TVA
 If any member of the Tennessee Valley
 Authority Board of Directors had any doubts
 concerning what the President of the United
 States feels this Independent agency's role
 is, Mr. Kennedy's latest letter should have
 dispelled those doubts.
 The President wrote; "The TVA is in the
 business  of  resource  development  and  I
 want to feel that in your future thinking on
 the continuing problems of the valley re-
 gion, you will  be giving                                                                             thought to the
 problems which go beyond the production
 and sale of power.
 "We need much creative thinking in this
 area and the TVA has stood in the past for
 original and bold thinking.  This vigorous
 and  imaginative  momentum  must  be
 continued."
 This was President Kennedy's reaction to
 the Board's decision to locate  its newest
 steam plant on the Clinch River in east Ten-
 nessee.   The President had suggested fav-
 orable consideration of a site in southeast
 Kentucky, a seriously depressed region with
 idle coal fields.
 Never did President Kennedy presume to
 dictate policy decisions to TVA, an inde-
 pendent agency, and it Is in keeping with
 this approach that he has termed the Board's
 steam plant decision the proper one.  A dif-
 ference in capital outlay of $30 million he
 deemed complete justification for selecting
 the Clinch River site.
 Nevertheless, the reminder Mr. Kennedy
 has given the Board is one which was needed.
 Since TVA constructed its first steam plant
 at New Johnsonville, its underlying philoso-
 phy has seemed to shift slowly away from
 the emphasis on "the business of resource
 development."  Its "production and sale of
 power- role, a legitimate one, has received
 increasing attention.
 This newspaper has called attention to
 this situation. It has suggested that the
 slide rule Is a magnificent instrument, but
 that it should not entirely replace TVA's
 department  of  vision  and  farsightedness.
 When TVA came to this valley it thought in
 terms of river  navigation,  flood  control,
 recreation, forest protection, improved agri-
 cultural methods, and saving eroding soil,
 as well as cheap electrical energy.
 It dreamed of lifting a region by the in-
 telligent use of all its resources, not by the
 coldly efficient and economic development of

 ished from the American scene and feel It
 is high time to do likewise with "Tony"
 the gangster.
 Your statement "that  it would be ex-
 tremely difficult to write a history of or-
 ganized crime in this country * * * without
 filling  it  almost  exclusively  with  Italian
 names", is more indicative of prejudice than
 of accuracy.    You offer no statistical proof
 of your wholly gratuitious assertion.   Let us
 offer you the survey of the U.S. Bureau of
 Prisons, Department of Justice, which indi-
 cates that the Federal  prison  population
 with Italian names is less than 3 percent.
 This means that 97 percent of all Federal
 prisoners are of ethnic origin other than
 Italian.  This despite the fact that Ameri-
 cans of Italian origin constitute about 10
 percent of the national  population.  You
 describe the use of Italianate names or Si-
 cillanate types in "The Untouchables" as
 one of the few admirable things" about it,
 thus revealing an instinctive approval of the
 very sore point which Desilu recognized and
 promised to remove in the interests of bet-
 ter intergroup ;relations to which you are
 obviously opposed.
 And when finally you reluctantly concede
 that Italians have produced "Toscanini too"
 * * * it is apparent that you have not
 gasped the significance or import of our
 contribution to the greatness  of   America
 in every field of human endeavor since its
 discovery  by  Christopher  Columbus.  Yes,
 the  history   of  our  country, which  was
 named    for Americus   Vespucci,  is replete
 with Italians like Marco da Nizza, who ex-
 plored what is Arizona today and Francesco
 Chino who laid the foundation for the great
 cattle industry in the Southwest; and En-
 rico Tonti, who founded the first trading
 post in Chicago and was one of the founders
 of the colony of Louisiana.  And his brother
 Alfonso Tonti who helped Cadillac found
 the city of Detroit and Umberto Beltrami
 who discovered the sources of the Missis-
 sippi.  And Filippo Mazzei, physician and
 counselor to Thomas Jefferson, who Incor-
 porated the philosophy of Mazzeiin the De-
 claration of Independence with the immor-
 tal words "That all men are created free and
 equal."
 And  wasn't  it  an  American  patriot  of
 Italian origin who made possible the vic-
 tory of Gen. George Rogers Clark which en-
 abled                    him to open          up  the great North-
 west?                         Yes, it was     Col. Francis Vigo who
 financed the expedition and also furnished
 the  military  information  which  brought
 about the defeat of the Indians in this cru-
 cial period in American history.
 And it might Interest you to know that
 in the Capitol in Washington 90 percent
 of the art work, frescos, paintings, sculp-
 tures are the work of Italian artists such as
 Costantino Brumidi, Joseph Franzoni, John
 Andrei.  And even the silver dollar was de-
 signed                    by  the  Italian  DeFrancisci.
 In the field of science, how can we evalu-
 ate the contributions to America and the
 world, of the genius and wizardry of Mar-
 coni?                            What is the impact on history of Dr.
 Enrico Fermi, who made nuclear fission a
 reality? And Drs. Ghiorso and Rossi of the
 University of California who discovered ele-
 ment                    100 used in  the hydrogen bomb?
 And Dr. Failla who designed the  world's
 largest radium therapy apparatus?
 Great educators like Angelo Patri, con
 gist; Dr. Rettaghata, president of the Illi-
 nois Institute of Technology; Dean Emeri-
 tus Cosenza, of Brooklyn College; Dr. Edward
 Mortola, president of Pace College; Mario
 Pei,   world-renowned   philologist,   whom
 George Bernard Shaw cited as a master of
 the  English  language; Dr.  Francis   Verdi,
 professor of surgery at Yale University, have
 left an indelible imprint on the minds of
 American students.
 Many great captains of Industry contrib-
 Ute to the daily enrichment of the Nation.
 Men like Giannini, who founded the great-
 est bank  in the world;  the  Vaccaros  of
 Louisiana, and the DiGiorgios,  the fruit
 kings of America; the Cuneo brothers, opera-
 tors of the great printing establishment in
 the world; Amedeo Obici, who founded the
 Planters peanut empire; Crespi, the cotton
 king of Waco; Ross Siracusa, head of Admiral
 television;  Martino,  president  of National
 Lead Co.; Salvatore Giordano, head of Fed-
 ders air conditioning; Riggio, who was presi-
 dent of the board of American Tobacco Co.;
 our own Pope brothers, of the Colonial Sand
 & Stone Co., and countless others.
 And builders of roads, tunnels, airports,
 and  skyscrapers,  engineers and  architects
 * * * men like the Gulls, DiNapoli, Rizzi,
 Corbetta,  DelBalso,  Paterno,  Petrillo, Lou
 Perini, at al.
 In the field of labor we have such out-
 standing                                                                                     leaders  as Luigi  Antonini, first
 vice president of the International Ladies

 you just a few of the outstanding pers9nali-

 We have produced outstanding men In
 other  fields:  the food  industry;  vintners,
 restaurateurs, and politics where space will
 permit us, in passing, to mention men like
 Senator  Pastore  and Governor DiSalle  of
 Ohio;  Rosellini  of  Washington,    Volpe of
 Massachusetts, and Notts of Rhode Island,
 and the incomparable Fiorello LaGuardia.
 But we are proudest of our contribution to
 the defense of our country in all the wars
 America has fought.   We recall the story
 of  Francis  Spinola, who  though  he  de-
 nounced. Lincoln's fratricidal war which di-
 vided                                                                           the country,  nevertheless formed        a
 brigade of volunteers to defend the Republic.
 He was wounded in battle, leading his men,
 was given the Congressional Medal of Honor
 and was promoted to brigadier general by
 President Lincoln himself.  Since then the
 number of our Medal of Honor winners has
 become :legion.
 These  are  the  kind  of   Americans,  Mr.
 Crosby, who-many  millions      strong-have
 made and are making their proud contribu-
 tion to the greatness of America and who
 justly denounce discriminatory presentations
 such as "The Untouchables" for their dis-
 tortion of the true Image of the devoted
 American of Italian origin.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. VANCE HARTKE
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Thursday, April 13, 1961
 Mr. HARTKE.                                Madam  President,
 much has been written and said recently
 April 13
 about the John Birch Society. My good
 friend, Marsee Cox, the editor of the
 Terre Haute, Ind., Tribune, made a very
 candid analysis of the situation, I be-
 lieve,  in  a recent  editorial  entitled
 "Doctrine of Hatred." I ask unanimous
 consent that the editorial be printed in
 the Appendix of the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 DOCTRINE OF HATRED
 Senator                                  BARRY  GOLDWATER,  who  has  be-
 come known as the spokesman of Republi-
 can conservatism, is of two minds about the
 controversial John Birch Society.                                Recently
 he  told newsmen that while he disagrees
 with its far-right theories he Is "impressed
 by the type of people in it."  They are, he
 thinks, "the kind we need i.n politics."
 They are also either remarkably naive or
 reactionary in the nth degree. And in fair-
 ness it should be noted at cnce that though
 GOLDWATEn is "'impressed" by those attracted
 to the group he has specifically disavowed
 some  of  its  more  extreme   contentions.
 Among these are the claims that ours is not
 a fit form of government with which to fight
 communism., that Communists have influ-
 enced Supreme Court decrees, that recent
 Presidents  from Roosevelt through Eisen-
 hower have been Commur.L:,sts or Commu-
 nist tools, that; Chief Justice Warren should
 be impeached, and so on.
 The  John Birch  Society',  founded by   a
 wealthy retired candy maker named Robert
 Welch, poses a familiar dilemma.     GOLD-
 WATER expressed a common. attitude when
 he said, "They, are anti-Communist and I
 don't see how we can be against that."  Of
 course  no  responsible  American  can  be
 "against" anticommunism.  But the ques-
 tion is: Should not Americans be against
 communism  by  being     vigorously for the
 principles which have made this Nation a
 great citadel of freedom?
 We say "Yes." We say being for those prin-
 ciples, and working actively to preserve and
 strengthen them, is far and away the most
 effective way to fight communism.  That is
 something the members of the John Birch
 Society have yet to learn.  The society's per-
 verted appeal resorts to tactics of both com-
 munism and. fascism.  Whatever may be said
 of the people attracted to It, its doctrine of
 hatred is emphatically not the kind of doc-
 trine we :o.eed in American politics.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. RUSSELL R. LONG
 OF LOUISIANA
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Thursday, April 13, 1961
 Mr, LONG of Louisiana.' Mr. Presi-
 dent, on April 12 it was my pleasure to
 have as my guests the senior class of the
 Metairie  Park Country  Day School.
 This fine institution, which is located in
 Metairie on the outskirts of New Orleans,
 has one of the loveliest settings of any
 school I have ever seen.
 The school is dedicated to the pursuit
 of higher education and to the develop-
 ment of the kind of individual who will
 become a valuable citizen in this great
 country.

 5986                     CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 and also of the acting minority leader
 [Mr. GOLDWATER].
 Mr. President, I wish to make it plain
 why I shall vote for H.R. 3935 on its final
 passage, notwithstanding my absolute
 disapproval of the false definition of
 interstate commerce and the arbitrary
 classification of various enterprises set
 out in paragraph (s) of section 2, which
 appears on pages 14 and 15 of the bill,
 and which is designed to add a new par-
 agraph (s) to section 3 of the Fair Labor
 Standards Act of 1938.  For clarity and
 convenience, I shall hereafter call this
 paragraph 3(s).
 I wish to state at the outset that de-
 spite my emphatic disapproval of para-
 graph 3(s), I am of the opinion that
 H.R. 3935 is a vast improvement in at
 least two respects over the similar bill
 which the Senate debated at is post-
 convention session last August.  In the
 first place, most of the provisions of
 H.R. 3935 are consistent with the con-
 stitutional definition of interstate com-
 merce; and in the second place, H.R.
 3935 expressly excludes from its coverage
 certain local enterprises which the other
 bill attempted to bring into the maw of
 Federal regulations.
 Most major pieces of Federal legisla-
 tion are not all good or all bad.  It
 Is inevitable that this should be so.
 Such  legislation  is  obtainable only
 through    compromise of the varying
 views of a majority of the 100 Members
 of the Senate and a majority of the 435
 Members of the House.
 A Senator is at liberty to seek to im-
 prove any bill by amendments until such
 bill is read the third time and the ques-
 tion of its final passage arises.  When
 these events occur, however, the Senator
 must vote the completed bill up or down.
 If the bill contains both good and bad
 provisions, the Senator must base his
 vote on final passage upon his conclusion
 as to whether the good or the bad provi-
 sions predominate.  Under article I of
 the Constitution, Congress has the power
 to regulate interstate commerce, which
 Is defined in clause 3 of section 8 as com-
 merce "among the several States." Un-
 der the 10th amendment to the Consti-
 tution, the power is reserved to each
 State to regulate intrastate commerce,
 which is commerce within such State.
 As one who shares Gladstone's belief
 that the Constitution of the United
 States is the most wonderful work ever
 struck off at a given time by the brain
 and purpose of man, I believe that the
 power of the Congress to regulate in-
 terstate commerce and the power of the
 State to regulate intrastate commerce
 should be preserved.  Indeed, in my
 opinion, the preservation of these two
 separate powers is essential to the pres-
 ervation of our federal system.
 For this reason, I have always favored
 the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938,
 which constituted a valid exercise of the
 power of Congress to regulate inter-
 state commerce because it restricted its
 coverage .to the employees of industries
 engaged in interstate commerce or in
 the production of goods for interstate
 commerce.
 For a like reason, I favor the mini-
 mum  wage law  of North  Carolina,
 which establishes a minimum wage of
 75 cents an hour for the employees of
 most industries engaged in intrastate
 commerce, that is, commerce within
 North Carolina.  I am confident that
 the North Carolina Legislature will in-
 crease the coverage of this law and the
 minimum wage thereby established as
 soon as it finds such action on its part
 to be feasible.
 H.R. 3935, which is to be cited as the
 "Fair Labor Standards Amendments of
 1961," has two objects in view. The first
 is to increase the minimum wages of
 employees now covered by the Fair
 Labor Standards Act of 1938 from $1
 to $1.25 an hour over a period of 2 years
 and 4 months; and the second is to ex-
 tend the coverage of the act to em-
 ployees of certain enterprises not now
 covered.
 While I am conscious of the possibility
 that the proposed increase in the mini-
 mum wages of those already covered by
 the act may work severe hardships in
 the case of some industries, I am satis-
 fied that the overwhelming majority of
 industries employing persons now cov-
 ered by the act will be able to adjust
 their compensation rates to the in-
 creased minimum wages without too
 much difficulty, and thereby enable their
 employees to share more fully in the
 fruits of their labor.
 For this reason, I favor the first object
 of H.R. 3935 and wish to vote for its
 provisions  increasing  the  minimum
 wages of employees already covered by
 the Fair Labor Standards Act from $1
 to $1.25 an hour over a period of 2 years
 and 4 months.
 I would favor any reasonable exten-
 sion of the benefits of the Fair Labor
 Standards Act to persons not now cov-
 ered if such extension of coverage were
 confined to employees of enterprises en-,
 gaged in interstate commerce or in the
 production of goods for Interstate com-
 merce as these terms are defined in
 clause 3 of section 8 of article I of the
 Constitution and section 3 of the Fair
 Labor Standards Act itself.
 But I am opposed to that portion of
 the second object of H.R. 3935 which Is
 embodied in paragraph 3(s).
 The opening clause of this paragraph
 reads as follows:
 Enterprise engaged in commerce or in the
 production of goods for commerce means
 any of the following in the  activities of
 which employees are so engaged, including
 employees handling, selling, or otherwise
 working on goods that have been moved in
 or produced for commerce by any person.
 When this opening clause is translated
 from legal gobbledygook into plain Eng-
 lish, it asserts, in substance, that an en-
 terprise is engaged in interstate com-
 merce or in the production of goods for
 interstate commerce if those employed
 in it handle, or sell, or work on goods
 that have been moved in times past in
 interstate commerce or have been pro-
 duced in times past for interstate com-
 merce by any person.
 This attempted new definition of when
 .an enterprise is engaged in interstate
 commerce or in the production of goods
 for interstate commerce is absolutely in-
 consistent with the constitutional provi-
 April 20
 sion granting Congress the power to reg-
 ulate commerce "among the several
 States," and with the constitutionally
 sound definitions of these same terms in
 section 3 of the Fair Labor Standards
 Act.  Moreover, it asserts to be true
 something which is obviously false.
 A sale made or a service rendered
 within the boundaries of a single State
 constitutes intrastate commerce, even
 though the sale or the service may in-
 volve goods made in another State and
 shipped in interstate commerce.  Both
 the English language and the decisions
 of the courts declare this to be so, and
 Congress cannot make it otherwise by
 uttering a legislative lie.
 If Congress can expand its powers un-
 der the Constitution by giving false
 meanings to such constitutional terms
 as "commerce among the several States,"
 then ordered government under a writ-
 ten Constitution has perished in Amer-
 ica.
 Before H.R. 3935 was read a third time
 and the question of its final passage
 arose, I did everything within my power
 to remove from the bill by appropriate
 amendments the provisions of paragraph
 3 (s).  To this end I voted for the Hol-
 land amendment, the Monroney amend-
 ment, and the Russell amendment. Any
 one of these amendments would have re-
 moved the constitutional objections to
 the bill.  Each of these amendments
 suffered defeat.
 Notwithstanding this fact, I will vote
 for the bill on final passage for these
 reasons.
 The conference committee will have
 an opportunity to remove the objection-
 able features from the bill.  If this
 should not occur, then in my judgment
 the courts will be compelled to declare
 that the attempt to expand the powers
 of Congress over retail and service estab-
 lishments engaged solely in intrastate
 commerce by the false definitions em-
 bodied in paragraph 3 (s) are void under
 article I and the 10th amendment, and
 that the second object of H.R. 3935 is
 valid only insofar as it undertakes to ex-
 tend the coverage of the Fair Labor
 Standards Act to uncovered employees
 of enterprises actually engaged in inter-
 state commerce or actually engaged in
 the production of goods for interstate
 commerce.
 The courts are expressly empowered to
 take such action and at the same time
 to uphold the validity of the first ob-
 ject of H.R. 3935 by section 19 of the Fair
 Labor Standards Act, which reads as
 follows:
 If any provision of this chapter or the ap-
 plication of such provision to any person
 or circumstance is held invalid, the remain-
 der of this chapter and the application of
 such provision to other persons or circum-
 stances shall not be affected thereby.
 While I do not desire to belabor the
 point, I have misgivings concerning the
 classification embodied in subsections
 (1) to (6) of paragraph 3(s) as to the
 enterprises to be embraced within the
 additional coverage.  The classification
 appears to be without legal or economic
 rhyme or reason and might well be ad-
 judged by the courts to constitute an
 arbitrary classification within the pur-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 OHN BIRCH SOCIETY
 sional committees have vigorously con-
 centrated their fire on internal com-
 munism.  Ignored in recent years has
 been the development of fascism in
 America in the worm of a secretive or-
 ganization known as the John Birch
 Society. This fascist group numbers in
 its ranks former officials of the National
 Association of Manufacturers, retired
 military leaders and a wide assortment
 of out-and-out crackpots. Its leader, a
 former candy manufacturer from Mas-
 sachusetts, has written his equivalent to
 Hitler's "Mein Kampf," in which he
 ridicules democracy.  He charges that
 former President Eisenhower is a Com-
 munist sympathizer, and he maligns
 many other highly respected American
 leaders.
 Its every action and policy is con-
 trary to the traditions of our Republic.
 From promoter Welch right down the
 line into every cell, the rightwing active
 members-termed by the St. Louis Post
 Dispatch "Birchsaps"-not only pass out
 disturbing comments and false charges
 against neighbors, against leaders in
 parent-teacher association groups, and
 even against members of the clergy and
 against loyal, elected and appointed gov-
 ernment, State and local, officials. But
 the principles they advocate, if adopted,
 would turn back the clock 90 years;
 would repeal and rescind the 20th cen-
 tury.
 Mr. President, Robert Welch, self-ap-
 pointed vigilante, head of the John
 Birch Society, is keeping inviolate some
 personal secrets.  He will not disclose
 publicly how many members there are
 in his organization.  He will not dis-
 close the names of his members. He will
 not inform the public of the number of
 cells in the John Birch Society.
 Above everything else, he will not dis-
 close the names of those silly persons
 who paid $1,000 to be life members of the
 John Birch Society.
 It goes without saying that this self-
 appointed "fuehrer" refuses to give any
 accounting for the money he receives in
 life memberships and in dues.
 He has fixed this intake at $24 per
 year for men who become members.
 For women, he allows a cut rate of $12
 per year.
 Mr. President, Robert Welch, retired
 lawyer and candy manufacturer of Bel-
 mont,  Mass.,  recently  addressed  an
 audience of 6,000, each one of whom
 paid $1 admission fee. Though his dem-
 agogic speech lasted 90-minutes, he was
 well paid.  One technique of the mem-
 bers of the John Birch Society, which
 they of course acquire from their lead-
 er, is to accuse persons who disagree
 with their views as being Communist
 sympathizers.  They make these brave
 charges without any documentation nor
 justification.
 We in America face an appalling
 threat of Communist aggression but that
 threat comes from Red China with its
 population of 650 million and from the
 Soviet Union with a population of more
 than 200 million. Members of the Birch
 Society claim to see Communists under
 neighbor's beds.  Their dictator Welch,
 who is a self-appointed vigilante play-
 ing God with other people's patriotism,
 declaims he is anti-Communist.   He
 alleges that there are 7,000 ministers
 of the Gospel in the United States who
 are Communists or Communist sympa-
 thizers. He could not name 70 nor even
 7.  He is guilty of uttering demagogic,
 untruthful, and wildly fantastic charges.
 Mr. President, Dictator Franco of
 Spain, is also anti-Communist.  Hitler
 and Mussolini were anti-Communists up
 to the time they met violent deaths.
 Does anticommunism alone qualify a
 man as a loyal American?  What can
 serious-minded Americans really think
 of this man Welch who made money as
 a lawyer and as a candy manufacturer
 and now is making much more money as
 a promoter and denunciator? This fel-
 low has termed former Presidents Eisen-
 hower  and  Truman as "Communist
 sympathizers."  He denounced the late
 John Foster Dulles and his brother,
 Allen Dulles, who is presently Director
 of our Central Intelligence Agency as
 pro-Communist and Communist.  He is
 urging the impeachment of the Chief
 Justice of the United States, Earl War-
 ren, who is a thoroughly great and loyal
 American and who was vice presidential
 candidate  of  the Republican Party.
 What can Americans think of a fellow
 such as this, other than that he has a
 wicked tongue and is a crackpot or an
 unscrupulous, mercenary demagog and
 slick promoter?
 Mr. President, the facts are that we
 who are rank and file Americans can
 well consider Welch and those active in
 his John Birch Society as being sub-
 versive of the worst kind.  While pre-
 tending to be loyal Americans, they are
 in reality fomenting suspicion against
 their neighbors, in the churches, and in
 the universities.
 When Robert Welch states the im-
 peachment of Chief Justice Earl Warren
 is "just one of our specific objectives,"
 he is seeking to undermine the confi-
 dence of people in a loyal and dedicated
 American leader while at the same time
 pretending that he himself is a loyal
 American.
 Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy
 is correct in his statement that the John
 Birch Society "is ridiculous" and that its
 members "make no contribution to the
 fight against communism here in the
 United States, and in fact-if anything,
 they are a hindrance."  The California
 State Senate factfmding committee on
 Un-American activities has announced
 that it has started an inquiry into the
 John Birch Society. Personally my view
 is that as not one of the members of this
 society, nor its leader, Welch, has com-
 mitted any overt act of force and vio-
 lence against constituted authority in
 this country, I feel there Is no occasion
 for any congressional or legislative in-
 vestigation of this secret society. Welch
 5985
 has the same right all Americans cher-
 ish-to enjoy the freedom of speech.
 In 1850 and 1856, members of the
 Know Nothing Party elected candidates
 to office and their candidate for Presi-
 dent of the United States in 1856, Mil-
 lard Fillmore, :received many thousands
 of votes.  They claimed that the Pope
 was coming to America to establish the
 Vatican somewhere along the Missis-
 sippi River..  They denounced immigra-
 tion laws and members of the Catholic
 Church; ttey termed themselves a native
 American party.  Like a wave of hys-
 teria, the movement spread through
 many States from the 1840's to 1856.
 Then after 1856, the "know nothing"
 movement died and nothing further was
 heard of it.  Know-nothingism of 100
 years ago died the same death that the
 John Birch Society will die of-unwept,
 unhonored, and unsung. Leaders of the
 John Birch Society are busy denouncing
 the whole foreign-aid program of Presi-
 dent Eisenhower and the foreign-aid
 program being carried forward by this
 administration.
 Misguided citizens who become mem-
 bers of the John Birch Society, even
 briefly, are making the battle against
 communism more difficult for govern-
 mental agencies such as the FBI. J. Ed-
 gar Hoover. Director of the FBI, has
 denounced activities of the sort prac-
 ticed by the John Birch Society. Many
 persons who have become members are
 really men and women of good will and
 their motives are of the best. They have
 been duped by a slick promoter of a
 secret society whose methods are uncon-
 scionable and whose statements are
 fantastically false.
 Mr. President, like the "know noth-
 ings" of more than 100 years ago and the
 "$50 every Friday" movement of recent
 years, this will come and go.  However,
 the strength and power of our Republic
 and the American way of life will grow
 and grow.
 FAIR LABOR STANDARDS AMEND-
 MENTS OF 1961
 The Senate resumed the consideration
 of the bill (H.R. 3935) to amend the
 Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as
 amended, to provide coverage for em-
 ployees of large enterprises engaged in
 retail trade or service and of other em-
 ployers engaged in commerce or in the
 production of goods for commerce, to
 increase the minimum wage under the
 act to $1.25 an hour, and for other pur-
 poses.

 are only 6 minutes remaining for the

 am happy to yield 10 minutes to the Sen-
 ator from North Carolina, because I

 ting rather short..
