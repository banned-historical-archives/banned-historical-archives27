CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 
The. Vice President 
United States Senate 
Washington 25, D.C. 
WASHINGTON 25, D. C. 
OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR 
Dear Mr. Vice President: 
1 1 APR 1959 
has furnished information on discussions 
which Latin American delegates to the 21st Congress of the GPSU 
had with Soviet officials in Moscow and Prague and with Chinese 
leaders in Peiping. I am certain that this report, a copy a which 
is attached, will be of interest to you. 
Soviet leaders showed sensitivity to Free World propaganda 
exposing their control of the international Communist movement. 
It was decided_ that Communist literature would no longer make 
reference to CPSU leadership and direction, or the need to defend 
the Soviet Union, although the Soviets of course remain in control. 
Both Soviet and Chinese officials gave high priority to the 
support of Communist activities in Latin America. The Chinese, 
indeed, believe that Chinese tactics can be fruitfully applied to 
? 
the underdeveloped countries of that area. Leaders of both 
nations were encouraged by the success of the Castro revolt in 
Cuba, but Mao Tse-tung cautioned that Castrols tactics should not 
be mechanically imitated. Legal tactics should be tried first, 
and. an increased capacity to manipulate nationalist, anti-U.S. 
elements should be obtained. 
A secret conference of Latin American Communists developed 
a common action program emphasizing campaigns against U. S. 
bases and missions. Soviet officials advocated that "U. S. 
imperialism" be attacked in its own backyard, and pledged 
continued aid. 
POPVCDF

Mao Tse-tung and other Chinese leaders, unlike Krushchev, 
found time to talk at length with the Latin American delegates. 
The Chinese contended that international tension benefits the 
Communists; exploitation of such tensions forces the "imperialists" 
to spread themselves thin. Chinese attacks on the offshore islands 
following U. S. landings in Lebanon were cited as an example of 
the successful diversion of "imperialist" forces. Mao claimed 
that the United States considered Chiang Kai-shek a liability and 
was ready to overthrow him. 
An interesting development was Maois request that thought 
be given to the union of several small Latin American countries in 
one national entity, in order to strengthen the fight against 
"imperialism". There is no indication that the Soviets raised 
this matter with the Latin American delegates. 
Plans were made to intensify the Chinese training program 
for Latin American Communist leaders; tentative arrangements 
to establish a network of correspondents of the New China News 
Agency in Latin America were worked out. The Latin American 
delegates were favorably impressed by the Chinese, probably 
because of the efforts made to receive them well, and appeared 
receptive to Chinese advances. 
I shall appreciate it if you will restrict access to this 
sensitive report. 
A copy of this report has been furnished to the Special 
Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs; the Acting 
Secretary of State; the Secretary of Defense; the Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff; and the Director of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation.as well as to General Goodpaster.

SUMMARY 
25X1 
1. This report is extremely sensitive. It contains highlight's 
of the observations of Latin American Communist Party dele-
gations to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union (CPSU), and of experiences with the re,rnrniinisf Ps.r 
China in Peiping after the 21st Congress,  25X1 
2. Pre-Congress Meeting on Propaganda Treatment of 
Soviet Leading Role. Before the Congress a ranking Soviet 
Central Committee member, possibly Mikhail SuSlov, obtained 
agreement from all foreign delegates that the Soviet Union and 
the CPSU would no longer be depicted in Communist literature 
as having a directing role and that all Communist parties should 
be portrayed as independent and equal, in order to discredit 
propaganda of "the imperialist and revisionist enemies" which 
claimed Soviet control over Bloc states and all CP's. Coopera-
tion and mutual assistance among Communist parties supplied 
or directed by the CPSU would, however, continue undiminished. 
At a special conference with the Latin American delegates (see 
below), Soviet Presidium member Otto V. Kuusinen pledged 
effective aid to the Communist parties. Another leader pledged 
"more economic aid than ever" in support of delegations to the 
Seventh World Youth Festival in Vienna. Intensive private 
discussions were held between Soviet officials and Latin Amer-
ican delegation leaders to iron out special problems, such as 
contact methods and Soviet financial aid. 
3. Special Conference of Latin American CP's. Although 
the special (closed) conference of the Latin American delegates 
(9-13 February) was attended by ranking Soviet "observers," 
it was formally chaired by a Cuban Communist leader. The

Soviet observers addressed the meeting only after the completion 
of its business, and made clear the highest priority of interest 
attached by the USSR and the CPSU to developments in Latin 
America, where "imperialism is beginning to be weakened in its 
own backyard." Latin American Communist parties were re-
lieved of the need to include language about the "defense of the 
Soviet Union" in their programs, but were urged to "struggle for 
the liberation of their countries" and to take territory away from 
the imperialist camp as the most effective aid which could be 
rendered to the USSR. CP Cuba was warned that the regime may 
"go to the right" just like Nasser, who had betrayed the anti-
imperialist, anti-feudal revolution. 
4. Action Program for Latin American GP's. The special 
conference of Latin American delegates agreed to make more. 
concrete the common action program developed for Latin America 
in Moscow, November 1957. It was resolved to organize an 
"anti-imperialist" People's Congress between April and June 1959;1 
to render the tactics of the Communist labor federation, Con-
federation of Workers of Latin America (CTAL) more effective 
by bringing together trade unions of the same type and by linking 
up CTAL headquarters; and to intensify the Peace Movement 
through mass meetings and suitable concrete actions or campaigns 
against military budgets, U.S. bases or missions, etc. 2The 
tactical objective of the program was to obtain greater popular 
support. Concealment of Communist language and organizational 
controls was therefore emphasized. 
5. Discussion of "Problems of Peace and  Socialism". 
Officials of the international publication Problems of Peace and 
Socialism in Prague sought to interview all foreign delegates 
transiting en route to and from the 21st CPSU Congress, in order to 
fulfill the mission of the publication. Problems of Peace and 
Socialism is to be (a) the collective organ of all Communist

parties and (b) a vehicle for the exchange of practical experiences 
of all Communist parties in solving concrete problems, especially 
new Communist methods to combat new forms of imperialist 
penetration. Representatives of Problems of Peace and Socialism 
levied on Latin American delegates specific requests for certain 
types of articles, CP documents and exchanges, and arranged 
legal and illegal communication channels. 
6. Chinese Views on International Affairs. MAO Tse-tung, 
LIU Shao-ch' i and other Chinese leaders, in conversations with 
Latin American CP delegates in China in February and March, 
followed previously expressed official or unofficial lines on inter-
national affairs. 
a. They stressed the affinity of the stuatidns in the 
underdeveloped countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America 
and advocated an exchange of experience among the CP's of 
these countries. 
b. They maintained that international tensions benefit 
cp,s and aid China because Communists, by coordinated 
action, are able to distract and disperse imperialist forces 
and to force them to spread themselves thin over a vast area. 
They said Communist parties should not be afraid of inter-
national tension ? "we" need more of it. 
7. MAO on the Taiwan Problem. On the question of Taiwan, 
MAO Tse-tung explained how "Yankee imperialist aid to the 
Kuomintang" was useful to the Communists as a unifying issue 
which could be -used to show up U.S. imperialism and inter-
ventionism. He claimed that CHIANG's policy of fighting the 
creation of two Chinas coincided with MAO's objectives of 
exposing the U.S. as the "principal enemy" and exacerbating 
"contradictions" between the British and Americans, and

between CHIANG Kai-shek and the Americans. By preventing 
the creation of two Chinas, MAO stated, and by avoiding UN 
control of Taiwan, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was 
able to "strike blows against the United States without 
engaging directly in military actions with the United States." 
MAO claimed that Dulles and the U.S. were aware of this, 
considered CHIA.NG a liability and held in reserve a secret 
provisional government to take his place by a coup. 
8. MAO on the Liberation Struggle in Latin America. 
MAO stated: 
a. the struggle for national liberation in Latin 
America had developed in a situation of international 
tension during the past two years; 
b. the Cuban revolution had shown that the battle 
could be carried to the imperialist rear and that the 
imperialists were paper tigers; 
c. armed action on the Cuban model should not be 
applied mechanically; Latin American Communist parties 
should try legal, peaceful means first. 
9. MAO on Unification of Small Latin American Countries. 
MAO asked the Latin American CP representatives to consider 
and to report to the CCP their views on the possibility of unifying 
several small tin American countries in order more efficiently 
to resist imperialism. 
10. CCP Training Program for Latin American CP's? 
Representatives of ten Latin American CP s made arrangements 
for the dispatch of from two to five trainees per CP to a four to 
six months' practical training course for future national or regional

CP leaders which was to be organized by the CCP and would 
start on 1 August. The CCP agreed to pay air transportation 
costs at an average of $700 per student and gave each delegation 
cash in U S . dollars for this purpose. 
11. Establishment of Clandestine CP's ParallelPubli?
Known CP's. Officials of the CCP briefed Latin American CP 
representatives on the need to establish a truly clandestine CP 
functioning alongside the legal, semi-legal, or outlawed CP in the 
same country. Their reasoning was that a publicly known CP was 
vulnerable to destruction and repression. In their experience, 
only a truly and permanently Clandestine Communist party paral-
leling the known CP can avoid such destruction and repression. 
At the same time it can function effectively and assist with the 
development of sources of funds and information. 
25X1 
12, Latin American CP's to Furnish Corres ondents for 
New China E.ez_. The Director of the New China 
News Agency opened negotiations with the Latin American CP 
representatives to establish, with their help, correspondents for 
NCNA in Latin America who preferably would be CP members, or 
at least trusted by the CP's. NCNA would pay $100 per month 
plus expenses, for news and political coverage. NCNA would also 
furnish radio receivers or purchase-mon.ey for same, in order 
to facilitate daily monitoring by correspondents of the Peking 
Spanish language broadcasts. NCNA desired to have "legal" 
correspondents where feasible, and "-Illegal" correspondents 
where the political situation was adverse. The Latin American CP 
representatives took the matter under consideration and promised to 
send a reply through participants at the training school (see para. 10). 
13. Attitudes of Latin American CP Re resentatives to Soviet 
and Chinese Communists. The attitude of the Latin American CP 
representatives toward the Soviets was one of respect and auto-
matic submission, but some complained about Soviet aloofness,

arrogance, and coldness. The Latin Americans considered 
Chinese Communists to show less arrogance, greater kindness, 
greater hospitality and more humility than the Soviets. They 
agreed that Chinese conditions are more like those in Latin 
America than those of any other Bloc country, and that much 
could be learned from the Chinese Communists. 
14. Reflections on Sino-Soviet Relations. In their talks 
with the Latin American CP representatives both Soviet and 
Chinese leaders emphasized friendship, understanding, close 
relations and the absence of differences between the USSR and 
China. Nevertheless, the impression was left that differences 
have existed and do exist "within the family," possibly in the 
ideological field. In this respect, it was significant that a 
majority of Latin American CP representatives vetoed the 
proposal of a Latin American delegate to hold a discussion with 
the Chinese on the subject of "different roads to Socialism." 
The subject was apparently considered controversial.

Leading Role  
3 
1. Three days before the 21st CPS-U Congress, "Nikolai," 
an official of the department of the Central Committee of the Com-
munist Party of the Soviet Union handling relations with foreign 
Communist parties, consulted secretly with delegates from all 
Communist parties regarding the suitability of a formulation with 
respect to the "leadership" role of the USSR and-the CPS-U -which 
Kh-rushchev was to include in his report to the Congress. The docu-
ment presented to the delegates for discussion and approval contained: 
a. An analysis of the declaration of the twelve Bloc 
Communist parties at Mos cow in November 1957 showing 
the declaration to be basically correct and to be the basis 
for unity of the International Communist Movement. 
b. A statement ?of the need for clarity as to the 
"lead-ership" role of the USSR among the socialist states 
and of the -C-PSU among the Communist-parties. It was 
pointed out that the November 1957 declaration provided 
the imperialist and revisionist enemies with the opportunity 
to charge that the uss-R exploited the other socialist states 
and that the CPSU?  directed the other Communist parties. 
The latter point had caused problems for many-Communist 
parties: internal problems with revisionist elements and 
external problems vis-a-vis the masses, the national 
bourgeoisie and the bourgeois governments. 
c. A statement of the need for the  dilation from 
all Communist literature of references to the "directing" 
role of the USSR and the CPSU; also of the need for

emphasizing the equality and independence of all the Com-
munist parties. This in no way diminished the "vanguard" 
role of the USSR as the first socialist state, and of the CPSLT 
as the party which established that state. Likevrise this did 
not diminish in any way coordination and fraternal aid among 
the Communist parties in the fight against the common enemy. 
2. The docu M Li -was- prese as a "development" of the 
November 1957 formulation and specifically not as a correction. 
The representative ii of the Communist parties of Latin America 
approved the "development." 
B. 5 ecial Conference of Latin American Communist Parties 
1. A special clandestine conference of Latin American Com-
munist parties was held during 9-13 February 1959 in the Institute 
of Marxism-Leninism in Moscow. 
2. Representatives from CP Spain and CP Portugal were 
invited. They asked for fraternal support in the campaign for 
the release of political prisoners. 
3. In keeping with the line regarding non-direction of CPIs, 
the Soviets did not preside over the conference. Several Soviet 
officials, who attended as observers, addressed the conference 
after its conclusiol. These were Otto V. Kuusinen, aged former 
Cominterg official; the director of the Institute of Mrxism.

of the Central Committee, CPSU7 
C. Action Program for Latin American GP's 
1. Prior to the Latin American conference, a preparatory 
meeting of the chiefs of delegations was held on 1 February 1959. It , 
was resolved that the conference should agree upon concrete action

to be taken by the Latin American V's in further development of 
the November 1957 action program regarding (a) an organized 
defense of natural resources, (b) the trade union problem in Latin 
America, and (c) the peace- movement in Latin America. 
2. Latin American People's Congress. The conference treated 
the agenda items in the above order of importance and resolved first 
to organize a "People's Congress" in April 1959 aimed ostensibly at 
defense of natural resources.9 The subject of defense of resources 
was treated also at the 21st Congress itself. The Communist origin 
of the People's Congress is to be concealed. The tactic is to have 
the Congress convoked by leading figurei such as Lazar? CARDENAS 
of Mexico, Fidel CASTRO of Cuba, Rornulo -BETANCOURT of 
Venezuela, Jos-e FIGUERES of Costa Rica or others. All Communists 
are to -attend-as "persons" and not as CF--representative-s. "Anti-
imperialist" language in organizing and -holding the Congress is 
specifically to be avoided. However, the resolutions of this Congress 
should be anti-imperialist in content. The aim of this tactic is to win 
the broadest support possible. In developing this-Congress, impor-
tance is to-be given to the struggle against -dictatorships in Latin 
America and the defense of the revolutions in Cuba and Venezuela, 
and "other democratic regimes." Fraternal delegates from Asia and 
Africa are to be invited. The site is to be a Latin-American country 
where conditions are "appropriate." The C-ommunist parties of 
Brazil, C-hile, Venezuela, and Mexico are to be in charge of the 
organization of this Congress. 
3. Modification of Trade Union Tactics. Second, the conference 
resolved to modify trade union organizational tactics in Latin America 
so as to achieve -greater unity. The aim is to seek unity in relation 
to specific problems of workers in accordance with actual conditions 
in each country. Latin American meetings of trade unions in the same 
field of work should be proposed. In this activity, the-Confederation 
of Workers of Latin America (CTAL), Latin American regional affil-
iate of the WFTU, should develop its campaign to get closer to the

Latin American trade union movement. To facilitate the work, It 
is necessary that leaders be representatives of trade union centers 
actually affilined with the CTAL. For example, Victor Manuel 
GUTIERR-EZ, of CTAL headquarters in Mexico City, is not truly 
a re-presentative in the sense cited, despite his merits as a trade 
union leader and Communist. Furthermore, CTAL headquarters 
should be located in a country where it has a large mass bas-e. 
Hence the CTAL leadership should be reorganized and its headquarters 
transferred. 
4. Strengthening of Rea-ce Movement.Third, the conference 
decided that the peace movement must be strengthened. Where con-
ditions permit, the struggle should be through peace committees. 
Elsewhere, the struggle should be carried out by means of concrete 
actions or campaigns as, for example, activities against military 
budgets, U.S.: military missions and U-.-S-. bases. A Latin American 
meeting of peace partisans should be held during the first half of 
1960. In order to achieve the broadest participation in this meeting, 
sectarianism must be avoided. CP Argentina is charged with making 
preparations for the meeting. 
5. Sp-eeche-s by- et-Observers after-Conference 
a. Remarks by  Kuusinen. Kuusinen stated that the Latin 
American conference proved the correctness of the November 
19-57 declaration of the CPIs, for the February 1959 conference 
revealed-the maturity of the Latin American CP's and revealed 
that no one is in a better position to resolve proble-ms and lead 
revolutions than the CP's of each country, because only they are 
in a position to know well the peculiar conditions in their 
countries. 
He remarked that the-best way to-contribute to
internationalism is for the C-P's to struggle for liberation 
in their own countries, thus taking territory_away from the

imperialist camp. It is not necessary for Latin American CP's 
to include the defense of the USSR in their programs, because 
the Soviets are strong enough to defend themselves. Any revolu-
tionary advances in other countries would aid the USSR since the 
common enemy would thereby be weakened. 
Kuusinen asserted that events in Latin America in recent 
years are of great importance because they signify that imperi-
alism is beginning to be weakened in its own backyard. The Latin 
American CP's should, more than ever, coordinate and unite 
their efforts, and maintain firmly the principles of proletarian 
internationalism, be-canse imperialism will try various ways to 
counterattack, possibly through alliance with the national bour-
geoisie on the basis of concessions, or through intervention of 
the Guatemala type. 
Kuusinen stressed the importance of events in Cuba. He 
remarked that the situation must go to the left or the right; the 
direction would depend on the work of CP-Cuba inside the country, 
and on the work of the other Latin American CP's in defense of 
the Cuban revolutitin.. He cited, as an example of the turn to the 
right, the case of Nasser, who began as the leader-of the anti-
imperialist and anti-feudal-revolution, but later betrayed the 
revolution and reached agreement with the imperialists. He 
added that the national bourgeoisie of Cuba may try to do the 
same. 
Kuusinen concluded by remarking that recent events in 
Latin America -reveal that it is possible to defeat imperialism on 
its own ground. The USSR and the-CPSU pay great attention and 
attribute the highest importance to that fact. 
b. Remarks by the First-Secretary of the Komsomol on the 
Seventh World Youth Festival. In his remarks concerning the

that the Austrian government has denied the use of public buildings 
and schools. The anti-Communist organizations in Austria are 
developing a big campaign against- the holding of the Festival in 
. AuStria and threaten to sabotage and create serious problems for 
it, Moreover, Austrian students are developing a campaign 
against the Festival, and Hungarian refugees are threatening 
violent measures against Festival participants and events. 
The First Secretary added that in order to overcome the 
above obstacles, it is necessary to mobilize the maximum number 
of youths for the Festival. The organizing committee will give 
greater economic aid than ever to delegations. The committee 
has already determined the number of delegates per country. In 
order to avoid the Communist label, funds will not be channeled 
via the CP but will go to the local preparatory committee or youth 
group designated by the CP. Greatest care should be taken to 
avoid inclusion of provocateurs in the delegations. 
D. Individual Meetin s of Latin American CP Representatives with 
CPSU Officials 
Individual meetings of Latin American Communist party repre-
sentatives with CPSU officials were held before and after the special 
conference. All Latin American delegations or chiefs of delegations 
consulted privately with the CPSU regarding their problems, espe-
cially those concerning relations, channels, and forms of contact with 
the CPSU, and regarding CPSU aid of the type needed by a given-CP. 
(The Soviet modus operandi  in granting financial aid to GPIs was not 
discussed during the special conference. Ku.usinen pledged "effec-
tive aid" to the GP's.) These private meetings were held with 
Kostia,11 Spanish-speaking Soviet who maintained direct contact 
with the Latin American CP delegates, and who is an official in 
the CPSUs, Foreign Section (International Department) with special 
responsibility for Latin. America. Kostia discussed the problems, 
then referred them to the Central Committee via "N.kola,i." The

Central Committee replied via "Nikolai" and Kostia. Some Latin 
American CP-1s, for example those of Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Uruguay, 
and Venezuela, held several such meetings. Possibly, they talked to 
higher-ranking Soviets than Kostia or "Nikolai." 
E. The New International Communist Publication 
1. Officials of the new international Communist journal, 
Problems of Peace and Socialism, sought to interview all foreign 
Communist delegates who transited Prague en route to the CPSU 
Congress. 
121 
2. A Soviet called "Ca,ranov, who was said to be in charge of 
the new journal, made the following remarks through an interpreter 
to one Latin American delegation. 
a. -He described the journal's mission as that of becoming 
a collective organ for all CP-'s and a vehicle for the exchange by 
all CP's of practical experiences in solving their concrete prob-
lems. In particular, the journal wanted to include the experiences 
of CP's in solving new forms of imperialist penetration, including 
the new struggles and methods developed by CP-'s to combat these 
forms. 
b. He was interviewing the delegation in order to obtain 
help in solving the journal's problems so that it could fulfill its 
mission, which had not been satisfactorily accomplished to date. 
c. He noted that different reading tastes and different 
interests in various parts of the world had posed difficulties for 
the journal. 
d. -He-stated-that when articles are needed Iruin a CP they 
should be written by a CP-member. With respect to 'articles 
already published by non-party authors, if a CP finds one in 
accord with the party line the party should get the author's

3. The Latin American delegation -received from "Caranov" a

periodic submission-byCP-Ls- of -data for-the new journal. These 
requests are in addition to articles which may previously have been 
requested of a given-CP. The new requests are related to specific 
regular sections of the journal. 
a. For the section In the--Communist and Workers' Parties": 
submit official party documents regarding the most important 
internal questions for the party, and also regarding problems of 
a type not restricted to one CP only;

4. When the Latin American delegation was transiting Prague 
en route home-from-Moscow, it was again interviewed by an official 
of Problems of Peace and Socialism. This time the interview was 
conducted by another Soviet (name unknown) via an interpreter called 
"Simoniev," also a Soviet. The official requested that the CP submit 
articles for the journal on the following subjects: 
a. the organizational consequences within the CP of what 
had proved to be an undue reduction in the number of paid, full-
time CP functionaries; 
b. information on the revision of the CP's statutes, including 
the reasons for the revisions, the effects, etc.; 
c. official party documents on past as well as future party 
Congresses. 
5. In the same interview, arrangements were also made for 
communications between the CP-and the headquarters of the journal 
in Prague. Because the C-P involved feared mail interception, it was 
advised to forward three copies of all articles in the following manner:, 
(a) one copy to the drop address of a neighboring CP; (b) one copy to 
the official address of the journal in Canada;") and (c) one copy to the 
official-address of the journal in London!3 The possibility of sending 
a copy via the journal's office in Rome was mentioned but not agreed 
upon. 
6-. It was also agreed thxt a test of sending mail directly to 
Prague would be made. This would be done by mailing three cards 
directly to a personal addressee at Sadava 3, Prague 6, the journal's 
official address in Czechoslovakia. One card was to be sent every 
fifteen days. Receipt of the cards would be acknowledged.

II. LATIN AMERICAN DELEGATES' VISIT TO COMMUNIST 
CHINA  
A. Chinese Views on International Affairs. 
In late February and early March 1959, a group of Latin 
American Communist party leaders travelling in Communist 
China after the 21st CPSU Congress was given a briefing on 
international affairs by MAO Tse-tung, LIU Shao-ch'i and other 
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leaders. The principal points 
made by the Chinese Communist leaders in these briefings 
follow. 
1. The situation in Latin America is similar in many 
ways to that in the countries of Asia and Africa. 
a. Latin America countries, like those in Asia 
and Africa, are underdeveloped economically and have 
been the victims of both direct and indirect interven-
tion by the imperialists. 
b. Although a certain degree of industrialization 
has been achieved in Latin America., this development 
has not been accompanied by a corresponding growth of 
capitalistic political and social forms. State power in 
these countries continues to be in the bands of feudal, 
comprador -bourgeois, and bureaucratic bourgeois 
forces. 
c. Countries in these areas are often dependent 
upon one-product economies a,nd have served primarily 
as sources of raw materials for the economies of the 
imperialist world.

d. The revolution in the countries of these areas 
is still in its first stage, that is, the anti-imperialist, 
anti-feudal revolution. The immediate task is the 
completion of this first stage. 
e. The countries of these three areas now serve 
as a main support of the economy of the imperialist 
world. Together they represent a majority of the 
population of the world and control the greater part of 
its territory and natural resources. 
2. As a consequence of these similar conditions and 
problems, it follows that the exchange of experience among 
the Communist parties of these areas is of great value to 
all of them. By coordinated action Communists are able to 
distract and disperse the imperialist forces over a vast 
area. 
3. From this it may be seen that a policy of main-
taining international tensions is beneficial to Communists. 
Communists should not fear tension. "We need more of 
it," said one Chinese Communist leader. 
4. The CCP has applied the principle of tension in 
the case of Taiwan, Quemoy and the Matsus. When the 
imperialists have intervened in underdeveloped countries, 
the Chinese Communists have come to the aid of these 
countries by drawing off the imperialist forces. Lebanon 
is an illustration of this policy. 
? 5. In the same way, when tension is created in other 
parts of the world, by events such as the stoning of Vice 
President Nixon, the revolutions in Cuba and Venezuela, 
the expropriation of the Suz Canal, the imperialist inter-
vention in the Middle East, and so on, it is helpful to the

Chinese Communists. MAO Tse-tung and LIU Shao-ch'i 
both then added, "...and in this Mr. Dulles is our ally. " 
B. MAO on the Taiwan Problem. 
MAO Tse-tung explained to the Latin American repre-
sentatives Chinese Communist policy on the question of Taiwan. 
1. The conflict over Taiwan is a continuation of the 
Chinese civil war. In this it is plainly different from-the 
situations in other divided countries such as Germany and 
Korea. 
2. Although Yankee imperialist aid to the Kuomintang 
has delayed the final Chines-e -Communist victory, -that aid 
serves to demonstrate to the peoples of China, of Asia and 
of the. whole world, the imperialist and interventionist 
character of the U.S.A. The realization of this provides 
the basis for unity in Asia and for the anti-imperialist 
struggle in the dependent countries of Africa and Latin 
America. It serves as a noose around the neck of the 
imperialists which is drawn tight by the Communists when-
ever it serves their purposes in the policy of world tension. 
Dulles, who understands this very well, would like to undo 
the noose, but the CCP will not permit him to do so. 
3. The CCP, besides making use of the contradic-
tions between itself and the United States, also utilizes 
and exploits the contradictions which exist among its 
enemies: 
a. between British and American imperialism 
--
the British need to trade with China and therefore 
oppose the American military policy;

b. between CHIANG Kai-shek and the U.S.A.; 
c, between the U. S. A, and countries which are 
peace-loving even though anti-Communist and which 
_therefore opperse -the -American military policy. 
4. These contradictions are exploited by the CCP 
with the intention of isolating the U.S.A. as the principal 
enemy and target for attack. Thus the CCP "joins with" 
the CHIANG Kai-shek clique in opposing the creation of 
"two Chinas" and refuses to participate in meetings and 
organizations such as the U.S. -controlled UN which are 
attended by representatives of CHIANG's clique. In this 
way friction is maintained between CHIANG and the 
U.S.A.,. thus preventing the latter's escape from the 
noose. By this policy the CCP can ignore the decisions 
? of the UN and enjoy complete freedom of action. 
5. Communist China does not desire at this time 
to join the UN. The Soviet Union speaks for her there 
and exercises the veto in China's behalf. 
6. By preventing the creation of "two Chinas" or 
the establishment of UN control of Taiwan and by main-
taining a state of tension in the Taiwan area, the CCP is 
able to strike blows against the US.without engaging in 
direct military action with US.forces. 
7. Mr. Dulles understands very well the advantages 
that this policy obtains for the CCP. He realizes that 
CHIANG Kai-shek is an obstacle to American interests. 
Therefore the US is planning to overthrow CHIANG 
through a coup to be carried out by a Chinese officer who 
has already been trained in the US. The U.S.A. also has

a secret provisional government ready to take over after the 
coup. 
C. MAO on the Liberation Struggle in Latin America.  
MAO Tse-tung also analyzed the progress of the 
national liberation movements in Latin America during the past 
two years. 
1. He pointed out that these movements have all 
developed during a period of international tension. 14 
2. The success of the armed revolution in Cuba 
showed that it is possible to carry the struggle to the 
imperWist rear, that notions about imperialist superi-
ority are superstitions, and that ideas that th.e Latin 
Americans are not able to struggle against the imperial-
ists and their puppets are incorrect. The victory of a 
small revolutionary force over the much .larger forces 
of the imperialist puppets in Cuba shows again that the 
imperialists are "paper tigers. " 
3, Although the CCP approved of the armed revolu-
tion in Cuba,. it was not MA0's intention to direct all Latin 
American Communist parties to undertake similar action. 
Peaceful and legal means should be tried first. The time 
for armed struggle will be determined by the conditions of 
imperialist oppression rather than by the Communists own 
decision. 
D. MAO on the Unification of Small Latin American 
Countries. 
MAO Tse-tung also raised the question as to whether 
the division of the Latin American area into a number of small

countries had not helped to make them easy prey for the 
imperialists. He asked whether the Latin American repre-
sentatives had given this question any thought and whether they 
considered the possibility of uniting several of these small 
countries into one larger one which would be better able to 
resist the imperialists. He asked the Latin Americans to 
meditate on this point and to report their conclusions to the 
Chinese Communist Party. 15 
E. Chinese Communist Party ,Training of Latin American 
CP Members. 
1. Representatives of the Communist parties of 
Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, 
Honduras, Panama, Peru, Salvador, and Venezuela 
individually asked Chinese Communist Party leaders in 
Peiping, during the last week of February 1959, to make 
possible the sending of party members to study under CCP 
direction. 
2. LI,16 member of the Department of Foreign Rela-
tions of the, CCP, and other officials of the CCP called 
the representatives of the above-mentioned parties together 
and advised them that the Central Committee of the CCP 
had decided to prepare a four to six months course for 
Latin American CP students. The course will be based on 
practical_ experiences of the Chinese Revolution. Its aim 
will not be to teach general Marxist-Leninist theory, for 
that can be leaxned in any country. Consequently, students 
selected should be leadership cadres of genuine quality-. 
The CCP will pay all costs including air transportation to: 
China. All students should be in China by July 1.959 at the 
latest in order to begin the course by 1 August 1959.

3. The Latin American CP officials then asked the 
CCP representatives how many students each CP would 
send; the number stated in the reply ranged from two to 
five students. Each CP was required to present air 
transportation "budgets, " that is, the cost of travel from 
its respective country to Prague, from which 'city the 
students would be flown to China. via Moscow. The day 
before the departure of the Latin American CP delega?
tions, CCP officials gave each a sum of dollars (U. S.) in 
cash., without a receipt, to cover the transportation cost 
of each proposed student from that CP. The amount varied 
but the average, was about $700 per student. The Latin 
American CP representatives stated that they would send 
the following number of students: Guatemala, five; 
Salvador,. three; Honduras, three or five; Costa Rica, 
three; Panama., two; Bolivia., five; and Peru, three. 
The number proposed by the GP's of Venezuela, Colombia, 
and Ecuador,. was uncertain but would vary from two to 
five students each. 
F. Establishment of Clandestine, Ulega.l CP's Paralleling 
Overt, 
Legal CP s. 
1. An official of the CCP spoke to the Latin American 
CP representatives in Peiping in late February 1959. He 
stressed the need for clandestine activity carried out by an 
illegal CP functioning parallel to a legal or semi-legal CP 
in the same country. The knowledge of the existence of the 
illegal CP must be limited to members of the Central 
Committee of the legal CP, and better still, to only a few 
of them. The illegal CP should never surface, even if 
conditions of legality permit. When part of the illegal CP 
or one of its members loses contact, by reason of investi-
gation or repression, the "lost" unit or person should not 
seek to reestablish contact with the illegal CP. The latter

will make contact at a suitable time. If a long time passes 
and no contact is made, the "lost" unit or individual should 
join the overt, legal CP without ever mentioning the illegal 
CP. The illegal CP should be organized in highly compart-
mented form to avoid destruction when part of it is dis-
covered. 
2. It was pointed out that the CCP used this system 
successfully, especially in Shanghai. The director of the 
electric power plant in Shanghai on 7 March also affirmed 
the necessity of having a parallel illegal CP. He stated 
that without it, the CCP could not have accomplished 
"great things." LI, member of the Department of Foreign 
Relations of the CCP, stated on 9 March in Peiping that a 
truly clandestine CP, operating alongside a legal CP, is 
essential to avoid disaster brought about by total repres-
sion. He added that the illegal CP is in a good position for 
organizing, apart from its normal tasks, financial sources 
for both illegal and legal CP's,. and sources of information 
of all types. 
G. Chinese Communist Offer to Finance Correspondents 
Latin America. 
1. Early in March 1,959, in Peiping, the Director of 
the New Chinese News Agency (NCNA) stated to Latin 
American Communist representatives that the Agency 
desired to establish correspondents in Latin America, 
and asked assistance in solving the problems involved. 
He described the conditions set forth by the Agency. 
2. Correspondents should be persons- trusted by 
the respective Communist party, and preferably should 
be members of the CP. They should be, as-often-as 
possible, journalists persons ass ociated with journalism,

or at least individuals with sufficient talent for the job. 
The Agency will pay a salary of $100 per month, plus the 
costs of dispatching the news. Correspondents would have 
the following obligations: 1) send to the Agency a minimum 
of fifteen news items per month pertaining to their country, 
2) send photographs regarding important events, when 
possible, 3) listen daily to "Radio Peking" Spanish lan-
guage broadcasts, and 4) issue a monthly information 
bulletin if political conditions in the country permit. The 
Agency is willing to supply a radio receiver, or money to 
purchase one. 
3. The Chinese News Agency made arrangements 
with individual Latin American CP delegations regarding 
channels (forms, means) for dispatching news, sktgries 
and expenses, since c4onditions in the Latin American 
countries were not ut;iform. In countries such as Venezuela, 
Cuba, Colombia, and Uruguay, where legal conditions exist 
for the establishment of correspondents openly, normal 
channels of communication (cables, letters) directly to and 
from the Agency will be used. In countries where the 
political situation is adverse, the clandestine correspondent 
of the Agency: 1) will be a CP member and 2) will send, 
his news airmail to a "legal" correspondent in a nearby 
country. The latter will then cable the news to the Agency 
as if it were produced by him. 
4. The Agency expressed willingness to advance the 
salaries for the correspondents to be namedfixi Latin America. 
Several Latin American CP delegations indicated that a 
definitive reply to the Agency's proposals would be sent via 
the students which the CF's are to send to China next July 
for training.

H. Attitude of Latin American CP Representatives toward 
Soviet and Chinese Communists. 
1. With reference to the Soviets, the attitude of the 
Latin American CP representatives was one of respect and 
submission. They generally remained silent in the presence 
of high-ranking Soviet officials and approved anything said 
without daring to ask questions. The Latin Americans spoke 
well of the Soviets. They consider the USSR and the CPSU 
the most advanced and capable state and CP, respectively. 
They admire the Soviet economic and technical advances 
and marvel at Soviet ballets, music, and painting. In com-
parison with the Chinese Communists, they consider the 
Soviets less courteous and less well-mannered, and lacking 
the humility of the Chinese. They remarked about the 
difficulty encountered in getting to see high-ranking Soviets. 
2. A number of specific cases were cited in support 
of the above observations. When "Nikolai" brought forth 
the document regarding the "leadership" role of the USSR 
and the CPSU for approval by the Latin American CP 
representatives, prior to its inclusion in the Khrushchev 
report one representative said it would be difficult to give 
an immediate reply as the problem was profound and 
required deep thought. The other representatives turned 
and looked as if a sacrilege had been committed. In 
another instance, a representative from CP Brazil said in 
China, "The Soviets are arrogant, and lack the simplicity 
and humility of the Chinese." He cited the fact that LIU 
Shao-ch'i lit his cigarette and served him a meal, and 
stated, in contrast, "A Soviet marshal, is a Soviet marshal." 
Gilberto VIEIRA White, Secretary General of CP Colombia, 
stated that one could respect and admire the USSR, but 
that one fell in love with China. Pompey() MARQUEZ

Rodriguez, Secretary General of CP Venezuela, stated that 
Chinese kindness was unlimited. They did everything well 
and win one completely. In China one really learned, and 
one felt the affection of comrades. 
3. An the Latin American CP representatives agreed 
that the Chinese were better hosts; won the hearts of 
visitors; taught much; were humble; and said great things 
with simple words. Further, Chinese conditions were more 
like those in Latin Arne rica than are those of any other 
Socialist country; hence it was there that advantage should 
be taken of experience, for the benefit of Latin America. 
I. Sino-Soviet Relations.  
I. The Soviets constantly stressed the importance of 
unity of the entire Socialist camp, and of friends14 and 
aid among the Communist parties of the world. They 
singled out especially the friendship, understanding, and 
close relations between the USSR and China, which the 
imperialist and revisionist enemies desired to poison. 
2. Koatia, an official of the Department of the 
Central Committee CPSU handling relations with foreign 
CP's, personally passed on to the Latin American CP 
delegates the CCP invitation to visit China. He recom-
mended that they accept since the weather there was better 
than in Moscow at the time. He remarked that they could 
tour the USSR upon their return when the weather was 
better. Kostia himself took them to the Chinese embassy 
in Moscow for their visas, and spoke highly of the Chinese 
people, adding that one learned. much from a trip to China. 
3. Kuusinen spoke of the "indestructible" Sino-Soviet 
friendship in his address to the Latin American CP delegates?

after the special clandestine conference during 943 
February. Lidiya Petrovna,17 secretary to Kostia, 
spoke highly of Chinese painting, dances, and courtesy. 
Other Soviet interpreters made no mention of China. 
4. Victor (mnu),18 Soviet interpreter who met the 
Latin American CP representatives upon their return to 
Moscow from China in March, queried them regarding 
their impressions. They replied, "Magnificent!", to 
which Victor said, "That is what all visitors to China say. 
It is a great country." 
5. With, reference to expressions by Chinese officials, 
LIU Shao-ch'i stated at a reception given by the Central 
Committee of the CCP for the Latin American CP repre-
sentatives in Peiping on or aboUt 23 February that the 
USSR was the bulwark of the Socialist camp. The CPSU 
was the vanguard of the International Communist Move-
ment. The USSR had given enormous aid to China in the 
fields of international affairs, economy, technology and 
military matters. For that very reason China is obligated, 
as proletarian internationalism requires, to aid other 
countries and other Communist parties. Those who 
believed that differences exist between China and the USSR 
and that they can become enemies were mistaken. (Similar 
statements were made by MAO and other top Chinese 
officials.) 
6. The directors of various factories visited in China 
stressed the valuable aid received from their Soviet friends. 
Many people in the streets, especially children, warmly 
greeted the Latin American CP representatives as "Soviets." 
7. Despite the foregoing, it was the impression from 
so much talk of friendship that differences had existed and

do exist "within the family," between the USSR and China, 
possibly in the field of theory. On one occasion a Latin 
American CP representative proposed that the Chinese be 
requested to dislcuss the concept of the "different roads to 
socialism," and also "peaceful means of transition"; this 
proposal was vetoed by a majority of the Latin American 
CP representatives as being a delicate matter concerning 
which there have been many differences.

(Venezuela), and Pedro SAAD (Ecuador).

Buenos Aires from 4 to 7 December 1958. This date was 
later changed to April 1959. Recent information indicates 
that suggestions are being solicited for an alternate site 
for the Congress because of the stiffening anti-Communist
