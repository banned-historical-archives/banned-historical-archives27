 ^ 1220
 THE TWO-STEP FISCAL POLICY
 (Mrs. HOLT asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1 min-
 ute and to revise and extend her re-
 marks.)
 Mrs. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, the balanced
 budget caucus organized this morning
 under the leadership of the-gentleman
 from Missouri and the gentleman from
 Indiana, and so the support for the con-
 cept is mounting.
 Mr. Speaker, we are nearing the stage
 at which we will be considering the first
 budget resolution for the 1980 fiscal year,
 but the process for exercising this ex-
 tremely important responsibility is woe-
 fully deficient.
 - We have a system which forces us to
 debate and act on specific spending deci-
 sions before we adopt aggregate fiscal
 policy. We will be haggling over priorities
 before we decide how much to spend in
 total, and the effect will be to drive total
 spending upward. The system we are us-
 ing reinforces the normal political in-
 stinct to accommodate everybody's spe-
 cial interest.
 Instead, we should be establishing fis-
 cal policy first, and only then should we
 proceed to debate our specific spending
 priorities within that policy. It was under
 this procedure that we were able to get
 the large number of votes last year on the
 Holt amendment which would have re-
 duced the rate of growth of Government.
 I have introduced H.R. 55, which would
 force us to establish how much we can
 afford to spend before we wrestle with
 how much to spend on this program or
 that. I hope you will join me in cospon-
 soring this legislation.
 THE DOLLAR MUST BE BACKED
 WITH INTRINSIC VALUE
 (Mr. PAUL asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1 minute
 and to revise and extend his remarks.)
 Mr. PAUL. Mr. Speaker, "The first
 panacea for a mismanaged nation," wrote
 Ernest Hemingway, "is inflation of the
 currency."
 This has been true in civilizations an-
 cient and modern. And it is true in the
 United States today.
 The dollar that bought 100 cents worth
 of goods in 1967 buys only 49 cents worth
 today. A year from now it will probably
 purchase less than 44 cents worth.
 The Government is considering killing
 off the $1 bill, now that we will have an
 appropriately small $1 coin. In the fu-
 ture, will we carry $5 and $10 coins in-
 stead of nickels and dimes?
 Unless the Government stops its delib-
 erate policy of inflating the money sup-
 ply, in order to stimulate the economy
 and pay for more spending, that is exact-
 ly the way we will end up. Only a dollar
 backed with something of intrinsic value,
 instead of political promises, can stem
 inflation once and for all.

 UNITED STATES-TAIWAN
 RELATIONS ACT
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Speaker, I move
 at the House resolve itself into the
 minittee of the Whole House on the
 S to of the Union for the further con-
 si                                                 ration of the bill (H.R. 2479) to help
 maintain peace, security, and stability
 in the Western Pacific and to promote
 continued extensive, close, and friendly
 relations between the people of the
 United States and the people on Taiwan.
 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The ques-
 tion is on the motion offered by the gen-
 tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. ZABLOCKI).
 The motion was agreed to.
 IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
 Accordingly the House resolved itself
 into the Committee of the Whole House
 on the State of the Union for the further
 consideration of the bill I.R. 2479, with
 Mr. DANIELSON in the chair.
 The Clerk read the title of the bill.
 The CHAIRMAN. When the Commit-
 tee rose on Thursday, March 8, 1979, title
 II had been considered as having been
 read and open to amendment at any
 point.
 Are there further amendments to title
 II?
 AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. SYMMS
 Mr. SYMMS. Mr. Chairman, I offer an
 amendment.
 The Clerk read as follows:
 Amendment offered by Mr. Symms: Page
 5, line 18,                                 add the following immediately
 after the period. "The President shall make
 every effort to reach an agreement with Tai-
 wan to assure that the facilities used by such
 instrumentality to conduct its affairs in the
 United States be at or near the locations of
 the consular establishments of Taiwan in
 the United States existing on December 31,
 1978."
 ^ 1245
 (Mr. SYMMS asked and was given per-
 mission  to  revise  and  extend  his
 remarks.)
 H 1255
 Mr. SYMMS. Mr. Chairman, when
 the administration broke diplomatic re-
 lations with the Republic of China to
 establish full diplomatic relations with
 the People's Republic of China, the
 President said that even though political
 relationships between the United States
 and the Republic of China had changed,
 the trade and cultural ties would grow.
 Now the administration is indicating
 that they want to close the number of
 consular offices by five so as to bring the
 total down to eight. It makes no sense to
 me to close the primary vehicles of trade
 and  cultural relations,  the  consular
 offices, when we are attempting to ex-
 pand those ties. I am particularly con-
 cerned about closing the offices which
 are close to agricultural trading zones
 such as Portland, Oreg.; Kansas City,
 Mo.; and others.
 It seems to me that the President's
 statements are contradictory concerning
 our continued trade and cultural ties
 with Taiwan, and I would urge support
 of the Members for this amendment,
 which will coincide with the promised
 intent of the administration.
 Mr. Chairman, I would just like to
 point out to the Members of the body
 that for fiscal year 1978, ending Septem-
 ber 30, 1978, the Republic of China on
 Taiwan purchased $729 million worth of
 agricultural products from the United
 States. Out of that number, there was
 $219 million for soybeans, $177 million
 for. feed grains, $146 million for cotton,
 and $77 million worth of wheat.
 Mr. Chairman, I think that it is
 worthy to mention that of the offices
 which are now open, the following offices
 will be closed: On American Samoa, the
 office in Pago Pago; the office in Calex-
 ico, Calif.; and the office in Agana,
 Guam. I know the Delegate from Guam
 is interested in this matter.
 Also scheduled for closing, Mr. Chair-
 man, is the office in Kansas City, Mo.,
 which is in the heart of the grain belt;
 and the Portland, Oreg., office, which
 handles much of the white wheat which
 goes to the Pacific Northwest; also I un-
 derstand Boston, Mass., is closed.
 Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I think this
 amendment should not be greeted with
 anything but enthusiasm by most Mem-
 bers of the body.  -
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Mr. Chairman,
 will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. SYMMS. I am happy to yield to
 the gentleman from California.
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Mr. Chairman,
 I thank the gentleman for yielding.
 Last week I had the, occasion to meet
 with the newly elected Governor of
 American Samoa, Mr. Peter Coleman.
 He expressed to me his very great inter-
 est in and his concern about the ques-
 tion of whether or not the Taiwan con-
 sulate in Pago Pago will be continued.
 He pointed out, for example, that there
 are some 2,000 Taiwanese fishermen who
 are based in American Samoa, who are
 in and out. He said that the consulate
 officer which the Taiwanese Government
 has had there has been invaluable to
 his government in solving problems
 which those fishermen have from time
 to time.
 He expressed a very strong wish that
 we would provide, in some way or other,
 that that service be continued.

 Approved For Release 2008/10/27: CIA-RDP85-00003R000100050012-9
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE            March 13, 1979
 Mr. Chairman, I very strongly support
 the gentleman's amendment and hope it
 will be adopted. -
 Mr. SYMMS. Mr. Chairman, I thank
 the gentleman from California  (Mr.
 LAGOMARSINO) very much.
 Mr. Chairman, I would only ask again
 for support for this amendment which
 I believe will be helpful in continuing
 the agricultural and other types of trade
 and other relations with the government
 on Taiwan which we have had in the
 past.
 Mrs. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chair-
 man, I rise in support of the amend-
 ment.
 (Mrs. SMITH of Nebraska asked and
 was given permission to revise and ex-
 tend her remarks.)
 Mrs. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chair-
 man, I rise in support of the amendment
 offered by my good friend and colleague
 from the great State of Idaho. In fiscal
 1978 the Taiwanese purchased $729 mil-
 lion worth of agricultural products from
 the United States. The consular offices
 that the President wants to eliminate
 played an important role in facilitating
 these purchases. These consular offices
 are especially important to my State of
 Nebraska. And let me add at this point
 that I enthusiastically support this bill
 as a whole.
 I find it disappointing and saddening,
 however, that we here in the Congress
 must endeavor in this fashion to patch
 up foreign-policy disasters caused by
 the administration.
 I say we should return to our tried
 and true bipartisan system of making
 American foreign policy. The tattered
 and torn system, such as.we have now,
 seems to be conducted either at a snail's
 pace or with such impetuous speed as
 to  defy  understanding.  Impetuosity
 marked the break with Taiwan.
 Of course, there is no question but
 that we are going to have full diplomatic
 relations with the People's Republic of
 China.
 And, there is no question but that
 Taiwan needs more protection than the
 administration was willing to guarantee.
 There is a real question, however,
 about what our relationship with Tai-
 wan will become. That is the work we
 are today engaged in. Taiwan has a vi-
 able government for its 17 million peo-
 ple, with whom we have had full diplo-
 matic relations for'30 years. Taiwan is
 one of our top 10 trading partners.
 Taiwan has been our ally in war and
 in peace. We need all the allies we can
 get in today's world. This bill will help
 maintain and support our friends, the
 people and the Government of Taiwan.
 This is a simple forthright measure: It
 clearly states that Taiwan's safety is
 paramount and that any threat to it
 would call forth appropriate action by
 the President and the Congress, acting
 through and within our constitutional
 processes.
 Mr. SYMMS' amendment opens up
 avenues for trade and I urge my col-
 leagues to support both his amendment
 and the bill.
 ^ 1250
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, I rise
 in opposition to the amendment.
 (Mr. ZABLOCKI asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his
 remarks.) .
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, this
 may be a well-intentioned amendment,
 but it is unnecessary.
 Mr. Chairman, as many of my col-
 leagues know, the establishment of con-
 sulates on the part of a. foreign govern-
 ment is within the discretion of that
 foreign government, in cooperation and
 in consultation with the host govern-
 ment, in this case of Taiwan with the
 United States. Many of us are concerned
 ? about the 14 consulates or more-that
 the United States is closing throughout
 all parts of the world. It is our decision
 whether we want to open or close a con-
 sulate, and we then negotiate with the
 host government.            ,
 In this instance I think the gentle-
 man's amendment is unnecessary be-
 cause  the  Coordination  Council  for
 North American Affairs has already been
 created by the Government in Taiwan.
 On March 1 that Coordination Coun-
 cil for North American Affairs began
 operations in Washington, D.C., and
 eight other cities: New York, Chicago,
 Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles,
 Honolulu, Houston, and Atlanta.
 This seems, Mr. Chairman, fully ade-
 quate to conduct necessary business,- and
 the choice of cities was made by them.
 Under the legislation, if they choose
 to keep an office in Guam or wherever,
 it is their choice, in agreement with the
 host government. I do not think that this
 body, this committee, should advise the
 Taiwan Government, as it is now called,
 the  Coordination Council for North
 American Affairs, where they should'
 establish consulates.                    ,
 Mr. Chairman, I again repeat, the
 legislation does not bar them from estab-
 lishing offices throughout the United
 States. If they decide to close them in
 some of the cities that the gentleman
 from Idaho (Mr. Symms)  had men-
 tioned, it is their decision. I do not think
 we should resist.                     -
 Mr. SYMMS. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Idaho.
 Mr. SYMMS. I thank the gentleman
 for yielding.
 I would have to say, Mr. Chairman,
 that everything the chairman says I cer-
 tainly agree with, and it is true, except
 there is one more part of the equation
 you are leaving out and that is that our
 Government is putting pressure on them
 to close the consulate offices-or the new
 name that they have for them-to close
 the number down from 14 to 8. So we are
 finding out that the Taiwanese are being
 pressured to close them out of their fear
 of whether or not the United States will
 support them in the future in other en-
 deavors. They are sitting over there, a
 small country of 16 million people, fac-
 ing the Reds of 1 billion people, wonder-
 ing what is going to happen. So the -
 United States is in the position and we'
 are putting pressure on them to close
 them.
 The reason that I think it is not only
 unwise but foolish for us to put this
 pressure on them, as I mentioned before,
 is we sold nearly $1 billion worth of agri-
 culture products through those quotas
 with those consulate offices. Here we are
 encouraging them to close one in Kansas
 City, Mo., right in the heart of where
 the breadbasket can be to export wheat
 and grain; in Portland, Oreg., where all
 the soft wheat of the Pacific Northwest
 goes out, where there have been long and
 lasting  good  relationships  with  our
 friendly allies and our trusted friends
 on Taiwan.
 ^ 1255
 So why should it be a Government pol-
 icy? All I am trying to do with thiL,.-
 amendment is to say that the President
 does what it was he said he was going
 to do, so that we do not encourage them
 to close their American offices. If they
 choose to do it, that is fine; but if we
 put this language in the bill, it says the
 President shall make every effort to
 reach an agreement with Taiwan to be
 sure that the facilities used by such in-
 strumentality to conduct its affairs in
 the United States, be at or near the lo-
 cations of the consular establishments
 of Taiwan in the United States existing
 on December 31.
 So we are saying as our policy with
 this resolution passing the Congress to-
 day that we want to encourage them to
 keep everything the way it was, instead
 of saying we want to cut it down, because
 we are going to start looking for a bigger
 market over on the mainland. That is
 what we are talking about here. That is
 what I really think.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. If the gentleman
 from Wisconsin, Mr. Chairman, can re-
 trieve his time, I will merely state that
 this is the very purpose of this bill, that
 we can have continuing relations with
 the people of Taiwan and their instru-
 mentalities.
 Now, these will not be consular offices.
 The Government of Taiwan, the Repub-
 lic of China, and the present Govern-
 ment on Taiwan, has agreed to this.
 Mr. SYMMS. Under duress.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I mentioned to the
 gentleman from Idaho, we have repeat-
 edly heard there has been supposedly
 pressure made allegedly on the part of
 our Government on the Taiwan repre-
 sentatives here as to their consulates.
 Let me tell the gentleman, if the gen-
 tleman from Wisconsin does, indeed, find
 evidence of that type, we will certainly
 correct that; but let me point out that
 in some of our consulates that our Gov-
 ernment is closing, for instance, one in
 Austria, it is desired on the part of the
 Government of Austria that we do not
 close that particular consulate and some
 of the other consulates; but it was our
 decision, for whatever purposes, that we
 close them.
 I think in this instance, as far as the

 duties, and it is their decision to close
 them.
 I do not think we should in this
 amendment tell them where to go.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman from Wisconsin has again ex-
 pired.
 (By unanimous consent, Mr. ZABLOCKI
 was allowed to proceed for 1 additional
 minute.)
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, in the
 final analysis, let me again reassure the
 gentleman that the Government on Tai-
 wan, if it so desires to have offices un-
 der the coordination council, whether
 -it is on Guam, Kansas, or in other places,
 if they want to remain and keep them
 open, this legislation does not preclude
 them, or does not insist that they be
 -closed, no way.
 Therefore, I think it would be an in-
 sult to Taiwan. The gentleman's amend-
 ment, instead of being helpful as we try
 to assure that there will be a continua-
 tion of the relationships between the
 United States and Taiwan, the gentle-
 man risks insulting the Taiwanese in
 telling them where they must keep their
 offices for consular-type purposes.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Chairman,
 will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I am glad to yield
 to the gentleman from Michigan.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I
 would like to ask the chairman of our
 committee, for his comments on this
 matter because I have mixed emotions
 about this amendment. I just want to
 get the gentleman's reaction to this
 amendment.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman from Wisconsin has again ex-
 pired.
 (At the request of Mr. BROOMFIELD, and
 by unanimous consent, Mr. ZABLOCKI Was
 allowed to proceed for 1 additional min-
 ute.)
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Chairman, if
 the gentleman will yield further. I am
 deeply concerned about this matter. My
 original feeling was that the amendment
 was not necessary and then as I further
 listened to the debate, which touched
 upon the closing of Taiwanese consulates
 in Kansas City and Portland as well
 as other consulates which may be closed,
 I now see some need for this amend-
 ment. I have one question. What is the
 gentleman's feeling with regard to our
 State Department placing pressure on
 the new council. In other words, the
 closing or establishment of consulates
 should be based on Taiwan's judgment.
 Certainly it should not be the State De-
 partment which dictates to the new co-
 ordinating council as to what Taiwanese
 consulates should be open in the United
 States.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, if I
 may be permitted to answer, let me as-
 sure the gentleman it is my position,
 furthermore, if we learned that the
 State Department would be doing.that,
 we would object.
 ^ 1300
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Chairman, in
 view of the statements and the assur-
 ances the chairman of the committee
 has made, and since that is my under-
 standing, I would say that the amend-
 ment is not necessary. I would, there-
 fore, ask for a no vote on the amend-
 ment.
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. Mr. Chairman, I
 move to strike the requisite number of
 words. .
 Mr. Chairman, I also had the same
 feelings as the gentleman who preceded
 me and spoke concerning the amendment
 offered by the gentleman from Idaho
 (Mr. Symms).
 The chairman of the committee has to
 a certain extent satisfied some of my ob-
 jections, but I would like to make one
 thing very emphatic. I would hope that
 the distinguished committee chairman,
 the gentleman from Wisconsin  (Mr.
 ZABLOCKI), would as emphatically state
 to us here that the legislative intent in-
 herent in this legislation is that there
 shall be no pressure as to by what extent
 we can control the administration or in-
 strumentality oo the Government on
 Taiwan in the United States of America
 to reduce in any way their presence in
 whatever that office might be called in
 any part of the United States.
 I say that because I would find it not
 only disastrous but Insulting to this
 House if we were to understand one thing
 here and the administration, unbeknown
 to us, would be exerting pressure to re-
 duce their presence. The love, admiration
 and respect which I have for all the
 Chinese people, regardless of on which
 side of the straits they might live, should
 be passed on to the Government of
 Taiwan, whatever instrumentality they
 have to represent them in this country,
 should not be abridged or in any way
 pressured by the administration or any-
 one else if they desire to have an office in
 Houston or Dallas or wherever.
 Would the distinguished gentleman
 from Wisconsin agree that that basically
 is the intent of this legislation?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. I am happy to yield
 to the committee chairman.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, that
 is indeed within the intent of this
 legislation.
 On page 5 of the bill, section 202(a),
 subparagraph (2) clearly states-
 Dealings of Taiwan with the United States
 Government  shall  be  conducted  by  or
 through such instrumentality e o
 And in this case that would be the'Co-
 ordination Council for North American
 Affairs. And then it states that this in-
 strumentality would be appropriate for
 such dealings-
 And which has the necessary authority un-
 der the laws of Taiwan to provide assurances
 and take other actions on behalf of Taiwan
 with respect to the United States Govern-
 ment.
 It is the intent, with this legislation,
 that if Taiwan wanted to retain any of-
 fice it had-it would be a consular type
 office in this instance-in any part of
 the country, they should have that right
 to retain them as they had them prior
 to January 1, 1979, provided of course
 H 1257
 this is done with agreement of the host
 government, which is the normal prac-
 tice.
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. And is the gentle-
 man aware of any attempt to quote nuin -
 bers to them, that is, how many they can
 have in the United States of America?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. No, I am not aware
 of that, and if I find out that is true, on
 behalf of the concerned Members of Con-
 gress, we will protest it. I have heard that
 they were limited to eight, but I have no
 such knowledge.
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. Mr. Chairman, with
 that information and assurance from the
 chairman of the committee, I also feel
 that possibly the amendment might be
 superfluous, as long as we have the clear
 legislative intent as enunciated by the
 committee chairman.
 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. I yield to the gentle-
 man from New York.
 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Chairman, I think a
 clarification is necessary. The State De-
 partment has requested that the number
 of  offices  that  the  Taiwan  entity,
 The Coordinating Council for North
 American Affairs can have here is limited
 to eight. There have existed more than
 that number, so, therefore, there is a
 requirement that they close several of
 their offices. I do not think that is the
 intent of the Congress, however. The in-
 tent of the Congress is to maintain the
 relationship on the same basis that exists
 today.
 ^ 1305
 The number of offices can be'dependent
 upon the Coordinating Council.
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. If the gentleman
 from New York is correct, then we are
 back to where we need the gentleman's
 amendment.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Chairman,
 will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Michigan.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I
 agree with the gentleman.
 The  CHAIRMAN.  The  time of the
 gentleman from Texas (Mr. DE LA GABZA)
 has expired.
 (On the request of Mr.  BROOMFIELD
 and by unanimous consent, Mr. DE LA
 GARZA was allowed to proceed for.2 addi-
 tional minutes.)
 Mr.  BROOMFIELD.  Mr.   Chairman,
 will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Michigan.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I
 merely would like to add that the gen-
 tleman is absolutely correct. If the gen-
 tleman from New York says that the
 State Department has given instructions
 that the new Coordination Council can
 only have eight councils, then I think
 it is absolutely clear that the amend-
 ment the gentleman is offering should
 be considered favorably by us, because
 that is certainly the intent of the mi-
 nority side.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Wisconsin.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE           March 13, 1979
 Mr. ZABWCKI. I have just been in-
 formed by the subcommittee chairman
 that a witness from the State Depart-
 ment did indeed give information con-
 cerning this matter.
 Mr. WOLF'F. Mr. Chairman, if the
 gentleman will yield: the information
 was received from Mr. Harvey Feldman
 of the State Department.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, we
 accept the gentleman's amendment.
 Mr. WON PAT. Mr. Chairman, several
 days ago I rose to give my wholehearted
 support for continued close ties between
 this country and our friends in Taiwan
 as proposed in H.R. 2479.
 -1 wish to support an amendment to
 this measure offered by the gentleman
 from Idaho (Mr. SYMras), asking that
 the President permit the Government of
 Taiwan to retain its offices in Guam and
 elsewhere in this country.
 As many of my colleagues know, the
 Carter administration has proposed that
 Taiwan close some of its commercial of-
 fices in this country. It has also imposed
 an agreement that would limit the num-
 ber of commercial offices to 8, as opposed
 to the 14 commercial and consular offices
 the Republic of China had in various
 parts of the United States.
 I believe that the restrictions we seek
 to impose on Taiwan in this instance
 would create significant hardships for
 many  American  business firms  and
 thousands of former residents of Tai-
 wan who now reside in the United States.
 This is particularly true of my own
 Congressional District of Guam, where
 the residents of that island enjoy ex=
 tremely close commercial and cultural
 ties with Taiwan. 'Several weeks ago, the
 official Taiwan office in Guam was closed.
 This has created a tremendous problem
 for the hundreds of individuals and
 firms who want to continue their rela-
 tions with Taiwan.
 The Guam-Taiwan office was heavily
 utilized. It was far more than a mere
 outpost of the Government of Taiwan.
 The President's proposal that Taiwan
 restrict its U.S. offices to a few loca-
 tions is detrimental to the best interest
 of both this country and Taiwan. I am
 confident that Taiwan would welcome
 the opportunity to keep its Guam offices
 intact.
 The CHAIRMAN. The question is on
 the'amendment offered by the gentle-
 man from Idaho (Mr. Symms).
 The amendment was agreed to.
 The. CHAIRMAN. Are there other.
 amendments to title II?
 AMENDMENT OFFERED  BY  MR.  DERWINSKI
 Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Chairman, I of-
 fer an amendment.
 The Clerk read as follows:
 Amendment offered  by. Mr.  DERwiNSKI:
 Page 4, line 21, following "on December 31,
 1978," add: "including multilateral conven-
 tions to which both the United States and
 Taiwan, known at the time as the Republic
 of China, are contracting parties."
 (Mr.  DERWINSKI  asked  and  was
 given permission to revise and extend
 his remarks.)
 Mr.   DERWINSKI. Mr.    Chairman,
 after listening to the debate on the
 amendment offered by the gentleman
 from Idaho, I do not know whether I    And the gentleman adds his language-
 should quote the State Department in                                                                including multilateral conventions to which
 favor  or  opposed  to my  amendment.    both the United States and Taiwan, known
 Actually this is a rather noncontrover-  at the time as the Republic of China, are
 sial amendment, as I see it. The purpose contracting parties, shall continue in force
 frankly is this: There are fn existence  between the United States and Taiwan un-
 .                                                                                              les  terminated  in  accordance  with  their
 tions to which both the United States
 and the Republic of China are contract-
 ing parties. For example,  the  1963
 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the
 Convention  on  Narcotic  Drugs, the
 Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear
 Weapons, and soon.
 It seems to me necessary and practical
 and appropriate, in light of this legisla-
 tion, that we make it clear that these
 multilateral conventions would remain
 in force between the United States and
 Taiwan after January 1, 1979. I presume
 that is the administration's intent. I pre-
 sume that this would be consistent with
 the President's statement that only the
 Mutual Defense Treaty was abrogated
 and, therefore, my amendment is in-
 tended to specifically spell out what I be-
 lieve is understood and would just fill
 out a possible gap in the legislation be-
 fore us.
 I would hope that in that spirit the
 amendment would be analyzed, and I
 would hope it would be accepted.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield for a question?
 Mr. DERWINSKI. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Wisconsin.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, the
 gentleman's amendment deals with mul-
 tilateral agreements.
 Mr. DERWINSKI. That is right.
 Mr.  ZABLOCKI.  The  gentleman's
 amendment, in the interpretation of the
 gentleman from Wisconsin, is that the
 amendment would, in a way, authorize
 the United States to determine unilater-
 ally whether multilateral agreements will
 continue in force, and that will their
 membership be. Is that a correct inter-
 pretation?
 Mr. DERWINSKI. No. It is the intent
 of the amendment to state that the mul-
 tilateral  conventions  to  which both
 United States and Taiwan, formerly
 known as the Republic of China, which
 were in force- at the time of the change
 of status between the two countries, Jan-
 uary 1, 1979, remain in effect as previ-
 ously contracted, which was my under-
 standing of the statement made-by the
 President and further amplified by other
 officers in the executive branch since that
 time.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield further?
 Mr. DERWINSKI. I yield to the gen-
 tleman from Wisconsin.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, I know
 that the gentleman is an excellent legis-
 lative draftsman, but in reading the gen-
 tleman's amendment, and folding it into
 the language of the bill, it would read as
 follows :
 ^ 1310
 On page 4, beginning on line 19, the bill
 before us reads:
 (c)  All treaties and other international
 agreements which were in force between the
 United States and the Republic of China on
 December 31, 1978-
 I see no real harm in the gentleman's
 amendment, but will the gentleman fur-
 ther accept a suggestion. I am rather
 sensitive about repeating "Republic of
 China" twice in one sentence. That is not
 serious, but I am sure the gentleman
 from Illinois will agree that his language-
 as I read it is kind of clumsy.
 Mr. DERWINSKI. I admit that some-
 times when one is motivated by purity of
 heart, it does not necessarily follow that
 his language structure is perfect, so in
 that sense I accept the gentleman's con-
 structive comments.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the
 gentleman from Illinois has expired.
 (At the request of Mr. SOLARz and by
 unanimous consent Mr. DERwINsKI was
 allowed to proceed for 2 additional
 minutes.)
 Mr. SOLARZ. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. DERWINSKI. I weld to the gentle-
 man from New York.
 Mr. SOLARZ. Mr. Chairman, I do not
 want to panic the gentleman or under-
 mine the obviously broad-based support
 for his amendment by letting him know
 that I think he has a remarkably good
 idea here, which I can comfortably sup-
 port, but anytime DERWINSNI and SoLARz
 can agree on an amendment, it is either
 prima facie evidence that it is unassail-
 able in its virtue or there is something
 fishy going on. I would, however, like to
 suggest to the gentleman one very small
 grammatical correction in his amend-
 ment which I think is necessary in order
 to clarify its intent.
 The gentleman proposes to insert his
 amendment on page 4, line 21, following
 the phrase, "On December 31, 1978."
 But, at the end of his amendment,
 after the word "parties" he has a period
 rather than a comma. I think, in order
 for the amendment to make grammatical
 sense as part of the paragraph in which.
 it is proposed to be included, that period
 should be a comma.
 So, I would ask unanimous consent,
 without objection certainly from the
 gentleman in the well, to amend the
 Derwinski amendment by changing the
 period after the word "parties" at the
 end of his amendment to a comma. It
 would then read:
 All treaties and other international agree-
 ments  which  were  in  force  between  the
 United States and the Republic of China on
 December 31, 1978-
 And here we pick up the Derwinski
 amendment-
 including multilateral conventions to which
 both the United States and Taiwan, known
 at the time as the Republic of China, are
 contracting parties-
 And here the period becomes a comma,
 and it goes on- .
 shall continue in force-

 And so forth.
 The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection
 to the request of the gentleman from
 New York (Mr. SOLARZ) ?
 There was no objection.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield further?
 Mr. DERWINSKI. I yield to the gen-
 tleman from Wisconsin.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, with
 the perfections that have been accepted
 by the gentleman from Illinois, the sense
 of the amendment is nothing more than
 the bill before us intends. We accept the
 amendment on this side.
 Mr. RUDD. Mr. Chairman, I would
 like to speak in support of the amend-
 ment proposed by my good friend from
 Illinois  (Mr. DERWINSKI).
 I believe that it is important to protect
 the status of the Republic of China in
 all international organizations and in-
 stitutions. It is wise that the Congress
 exert its prerogatives and provide a de-
 gree of international security for our
 friends on Taiwan.
 FREE CHINA AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 This amendment would require the
 U.S. representative in such organizations
 to use for Nation's voice and vote on
 behalf of protecting the status of Taiwan
 as a member of all international organi-
 zations and institutions of which it was
 a member as of December 31, 1978.
 It would also require the United States
 to support the status of Taiwan in all
 international agreements to which Tai-
 wan was a party at the end of 1978, and
 to urge other nations to do likewise.
 Similarly, it would require U.S. op-
 position to any sanctions, especially in
 the form of a trade boycott, which might
 be attempted against the Republic of
 China by the People's Republic of China.
 The primary need for these protec-
 tions, Mr. Speaker, is to insure that the
 international rights and status of the
 people and Government on Taiwan are
 not endangered by the absence of full
 diplomatic relations with the United
 States.
 We in the Congress should exert our
 influence through this legislation to
 make the best of what I consider a de-
 plorable situation.
 We should indicate forcefully our
 si::cere desire to protect our friends on
 Taiwan by strengthening this legislation.
 In this way, Congress can demonstrate
 its intention to avoid complicity in the
 President's unilateral decision to recog-
 nize the People's Republic of China at
 the expense of our friend and long-time
 ally, the Republic of China.
 PROTECT FREE CHINA'S ECONOMIC SECURITY
 The continuation of Taiwan's inter-
 national economic relationships is cru-
 cial to their continued prosperity, and,
 indeed, to stability in that part of the
 world.
 Additionally, it should be remembered
 that Taiwan's prosperity is not unrelated
 to our own economic prosperity. Taiwan
 is our eighth largest trading partner.
 Difficulties for them would undoubtedly
 have ripple effects which would disturb
 the U.S. economy as well.
 It is important that Taiwan's economic
 security not be threatened, even indi-
 Approved For Release 2008/10/27: CIA-RDP85-00003R000100050012-9
 rectly, by President Carter's unilateral
 and unexpected move. Stability is cru-
 cial, and this can be encouraged by U.S.
 insistence that Taiwan remain a member
 of the international organizations of
 which she was a member prior to Janu-
 ary 1, 1979, at which time the President's
 recognition of the People's Republic of
 China took effect.
 The rumors have already begun that
 the People's Republic will move to oust
 Taiwan from the "China seat" in a num-
 ber of international organizations. A suc-
 cessful challenge in that direction might
 also endanger the long-term loans which
 Taiwan has previously secured, particu-
 larly from some of the international fi-
 nancial institutions of which she is pres-
 ently a member in good standing.
 The  potential economic  disruption
 which would follow such loan cancella-
 tions would be disastrous for the free
 Chinese economy and for our economic
 relations and trade with Taiwan.
 This amendment will serve to protect
 the economic interests of Taiwan and the
 United States.
 CONGRESSIONAL ROLE IGNORED
 Mr. Chairman, the amendments which
 we are working to incorporate into the
 bill today are designed to overcome the
 obvious shortcomings of the President's
 shortsighted  policymaking  decisions.
 Proper discussion would have allowed the
 development of better United States-
 Taiwan relations.
 While it is true that, under our consti-
 tutional processes, the President has pri-
 mary responsibility for the conduct of
 our foreign policy, the Constitution also
 provides for full consultation with the
 Congress.
 No such consultation with the Con-
 gress was attempted by the administra-
 tion prior to the decision to derecognize
 the Republic of China and to establish
 full diplomatic ties with the People's
 Republic of China.
 It should be understood that any
 clarification  of  U.S.  relations  with
 Taiwan enacted by the Congress is aimed
 at correcting this glaring omission, and
 in establishing the kind of relationship
 with the Republic of China which the
 Congress would have urged upon the
 President had he conferred with Con-
 gress prior to his decision.
 I have previously indicated my com-
 plete disagreement with the President's
 decision to end our relationship with the
 Republic of China and the defense com-
 mitments our Nation 'had with Taiwan.
 I am pleased to have joined with my
 distinguished colleague from Arizona,
 Senator BARRY  GOLDWATER,  and  other
 past and present Members of Congress
 who have entered suit to challenge the
 President's single-handed abrogation of
 this important commitment.
 Needless to say, I would prefer a re-
 turn to the situation with regard to the
 Republic of China as it existed prior to
 the  President's  December  15th  an-
 nouncement, regardless of whatever U.S.
 relations we adopted with the Peking
 Government.
 I think that it is important for the
 world to know the value which the Amer-
 ican people, if not their President, place
 111259
 on our friendship and continued rela-
 tionship with the people of Taiwan.
 For this reason, it is absolutely im-
 perative that the Representatives of the
 American people here assembled ex-
 press with a clear and unmistakable
 voice that the people of the United States
 earnestly desire to protect the interna-
 tional economic security of the people of
 Taiwan.
 I urge the adoption of the Derwinski
 amendment.
 The CHAIRMAN. The question is on
 the amendment offered by the gentle-
 man from Illinois (Mr. DERWINSxX), as
 modified.
 The amendment, as modified, was
 agreed to.
 ^ 1315
 Mr. PRICE. Mr. Chairman, I move to
 strike the last word.
 Mr. Chairman, I visited Taiwan last
 November and was impressed with their
 realistic evaluation of the energy prob-
 lem they face which, incidentally, is
 similar to ours. Taiwan though, is doing
 more to solve their energy problem than
 we are to solve ours. They have faced the
 reality that nuclear energy is the only
 alternative they have toward a goal of
 reasonable independence of petroleum.
 They have,  accordingly,  proceeded
 with a nuclear rowernlant construction
 program which is dependent on our con-
 tinued supply of enriched uranium fuel.
 They are paying full costs for this fuel.
 They have now reached the point where
 an increase in the ceiling for our supply
 of such fuel under their Agreement for
 Cooperation with us is necessary. Pres-
 ent legislation requires submission of a
 request by the administration to the
 Congress to increase this ceiling. As I
 understand it, Taiwan is in need of an
 increase in the ceiling for the supply of
 enriched uranium from 7,500 megawatts
 of electrical generating capacity to ap-
 proximately 15,000 megawatts. I would
 hope that the Foreign Affairs Committee
 would encourage and support the ad-
 ministration in increasing this ceiling
 since it is so vital to the future welfare
 and security of Taiwan. It would cer-
 terest in the future of Taiwan. Support
 of Taiwan in their efforts would also a,s-
 tainly be a positive indication of our in-
 sist other nations in contending with
 their energy supply problems. An indi-
 cation of the views of the chairman on
 the support of such a change in the ceil-
 ing for enriched uranium under our
 Agreement for Cooperation with Taiwan
 would provide an important Incentive
 for such a change. Would the chairman
 like to provide his views and intentions
 on this matter?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. PRICE. I yield to the gentleman
 from Wisconsin.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman,  I
 thank the gentleman for yielding.
 Mr. Chairman, the committee under-
 stands that conversations have already
 begun dealing with the renegotiation of
 the Taiwanese Nuclear Agreement- for
 Cooperation, to which my friend and col-
 league, Chairman PRICE has just re-
 ferred. These negotiations, which are

 unrelated to the change in United
 States-Taiwanese relations, aim at up-
 dating and streamlining the agreement
 under terms consistent with those set
 forth in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
 Act. These negotiations further demon-
 strate the willingness of both the United
 States and the Taiwanese to continue to
 expand and improve their cooperation in
 the nuclear area; they also provide the ?
 basis for renewing and perfecting the.
 various assurances and guarantees nec-
 essary for the effective safeguarding of
 U.S. nuclear materials and technologies.
 I understand that U.S. officials in-
 volved in these talks have already indi-
 cated their willingness to look favorably
 upon an increase in the nuclear fuel
 ceiling for Taiwan. I can assure the gen-
 tleman that I, too, would favor such an
 increase and would recommend support
 for it once the agreement comes before
 the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I am
 confident these discussions will be con-
 cluded in the relatively near future.
 I hope these reassurances are helpful.
 BACKGROUND NOTS
 Tht current ceiling will not affect or
 prevent the export of the two reactors
 now pending before the U.S. Nuclear
 Regulatory Commission; that is, units 5
 and 6. Nor would it constrain the import
 or fueling of a subsequent seventh unit.
 Taiwan would not actually begin to
 bump against the existing ceiling until
 the late 1980's in connection with secur-
 ing the last portion of fuel required for
 their proposed reactor unit No. 8.
 Taiwan is amenable to renegotiating
 the agreement, is not nervous about the
 current ceiling, and is satisfied to have-
 it raised within the context of the on-
 going negotiations.
 Mr. PRICE. Mr. Chairman, I thank
 the Chairman of the Committee on For-
 eign Affairs for his comments, and I am
 certainly in accord with the views he
 has expressed.
 Mr. STRATTON. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. PRICE. I yield to the gentleman
 from New York.
 Mr. STRATTON. Mr. Chairman, I cer-
 tainly support both Chairman PRIGS and
 Chairman ZABLOCKI in their expressed in-
 tent to stand by our commitments to
 Taiwan under our agreement for cooper-
 ation in the peaceful uses of nuclear en-
 ergy. In addition to contributing to the
 welfare and security of Taiwan, the in-
 creased ceiling of uranium fuel will fur-
 ther our trade efforts with Taiwan by
 opening up the option of additional
 power-generating equipment from the
 United States. Taiwan has, in the past,
 relied heavily on the technology and
 equipment of the United States for the
 generation of electricity. At the present
 time, when our purchases of nuclear pow-
 er plants are depressed because of a vac-
 illating national policy on the produc-
 tion of energy, additional international
 business will provide a vital contribution
 to keeping our industrial capability
 viable as I have reason to know will apply
 in my own district, where an important
 electrical industry is located. We then
 will be able to move ahead with our own
 meaningful energy program when our
 national policy catches up with the facts
 of the dilemma we face.

 AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. ASHBROOK
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Chairman, I
 offer an amendment.
 The Clerk read as follows:
 Amendment offered by Mr. AsHBROOK: Page
 9, strike out lines 1 through 9 and insert in
 lieu thereof the following:
 "(c) Employees of the designated entity
 shall be employees of the United States. Em-
 ployees who are separated or transferred un-
 der this section shall be subject to the same
 laws of the United States relating to em-
 ployees of the United States as they were im-
 mediately prior to their separation or trans-
 fer. Any other employees of the designated
 entity shall be employees of an Executive
 agency within the meaning of part Ill of title
 5, United States Code."
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Chairman, if we
 look at the bill, the current section (c)
 has a very strong odor to it. We are told
 that this is going to be a straightforward
 dealing with our friends on Taiwan. We
 are told that we want to continue in
 normal ways and yet, for some reason or
 other, mysteriously all these people deal-
 ing with our friends in Taiwan are sup-
 posed to be out there somewhere in
 never-never land. They are not going to
 be employees of the United States. Listen
 to what the bill says:
 (c)  Employees of the designated entity
 shall not be employees of the United States
 and, in representing the designated entity,
 shall be exempt from section 207 of title 18,
 United States Code.
 I would ask my friend, the chairman of
 this committee, the gentleman from Wis-
 consin (Mr. ZABLOCKI) to explain to the
 House just what it means to be exempt
 from section 207 of title 18, .United States
 Code, and why the employees of this
 agency,  entity,  designated  entity  or
 whatever one wants to call it, are going
 to be out there somewhere in an unof-
 ficial never-never land, not being em-
 ployees of the U.S. Government?
 Are we so afraid of having any vestige
 of government-to-government relations
 that we are even going out of our way to
 say these people will not be employees of
 the United States?
 I will ask my friend, the chairman, the
 gentleman from Wisconsin, to respond to
 that question and tell the committee just
 what it means to be exempt from section
 207 of title 18.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. ASHBROOK. I certainly yield to
 the gentleman.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I thank the gentle-
 man for yielding.
 As I understand, the gentleman is try-
 ing to clarify and confirm what my
 understanding of section 207, title 18, of
 the United States Code is. It is my under-
 standing that section 207 of title 18 of the
 United States Code prohibits for 2 years
 any Government employees from appear-'
 Ing before a Government agency, for
 which he worked. This exemption is
 necessary because it does not make sense
 not to prohibit the people who were
 formally in the U.S. Government who
 would be now employed by the designated
 entity from appearing before a Govern-
 ~ment agency in order to bring about the
 relationship that would be continued
 under the authorities of the entity. That
 is all it does.
 Mr. ASHBROOK. It seems as though
 it is a rather strange pattern.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. It is necessary for the
 entity to be workable.
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Why is it necessary?
 It is necessary because the gentleman is
 trying to create a group of employees who
 are Really in never-never land. They will
 be former Government employees who
 will be acting in the capacity of repre-
 senting the Government, but they will
 not be representing the Government; so
 therefore, the gentleman has to exempt
 them from the provisions that we apply
 to those who used to work for the Gov-
 ernment but who now represent private
 agencies before the Government. It is a
 rather complicated process. Would it not
 be simpler to just say honestly, out-
 right, and forthwith that this entity
 shall be comprised of employees who
 work for the U.S. Government? Are they
 not in effect, if everything we have said
 is true and heard up to now, working
 for the U.S. Government? Why do we
 need to create this section? Could my
 colleague tell me that?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. ASHBROOK. I certainly will yield
 to the gentleman.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I thank the gentleman
 for yielding.
 I will attempt again to try to explain
 it. We are faced with a fait accompli as to
 a decision on the part of the President to
 establish  a  nongovernmental  agency
 called the U.S. Institute in Taiwan. The
 name we did not choose. We deleted it
 in our legislation. We leave it up to the
 President as to what he calls it and
 what he wants it to be in consultation
 with the authorities on Taiwan.
 ^ 1325
 Furthermore, it is necessary to pro-
 tect these former governmental em-
 ployees, whether they are in the State
 Department, foreign service, former Am-
 bassadors or formerly with the Depart-
 ment of Defense or the Department of
 Energy. It is also essential that there be
 authority to assign former governmental
 personnel to work for this entity without
 jeopardizing their long range employ-
 ment, retirement and other rights.
 What this legislation does, and I hope
 the gentleman from Ohio will agree with
 pie, is to protect these U.S. employees.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman from Ohio has expired.
 (At the request of Mr. ZABLOCKI, and,
 by unanimous consent, Mr. ASHBROOK
 was allowed to proceed. for 3 additional
 minutes.)
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, if the
 gentleman will yield further, protect
 some of the benefits that would be theirs
 had they remained in government dur-
 ing the period of their tenure with the
 designated entity.
 Mr. ASHBROOK. My mind goes back
 and my memory goes back to the very
 first year I was in Congress. I remember
 the very first relationship I had with
 the war. in Vietnam. A former service-

 man from Ashland, Ohio, died. He was
 killed in Vietnam. He had $60,000 worth
 of insurance coming, because he really
 was a serviceman in Vietnam who was
 not a serviceman in Vietnam. We cre-
 ated the fiction that he was no longer
 working for the Government, but he was
 over there as an adviser, as a civilian,
 retaining all his military rights, all his
 pensions and insurance.
 All of a sudden, the minute he died,
 he was again a serviceman, but while
 he was over there he was not a service-
 man. You know, the more we get into
 this type of illusions, this type of fiction
 the more cloudy our actions and inten-
 tions become. The chairman has re-
 ferred to them as U.S. Government em-
 ployees three times, as I have heard in
 the gentleman's response. Yet the gen-
 tleman is saying in the bill they will no
 longer be U.S. Government employees.
 Here we go and we are on the same fic-
 tion, creating the same shell game. Why
 not flat out say they are Government
 employees?
 The gentleman also said something to
 which I would take umbrage, too, that
 we are dealing with a fait accompli. If
 it is a fait accompli, we do not need this
 bill. The fact we need this bill is the
 best indication that it is not a fait ac-
 compli, that the Congress does have
 some say, we do have some imput.
 I am saying to my chairman, to my
 friend, in all fairness, here we go again,
 creating a fiction,-and it is this type of
 fiction that gets us into trouble across
 the world, whether it is the CIA, the
 double agent, the fiction we had in Viet-
 nam, or the fiction we are now creating
 that we are now going to have nongov-
 ernment employees. I have in my hand
 the articles of cooperation of the Ameri-
 can Institute in Taiwan which were filed
 here in the District of Columbia. As I
 read that, I wish all Members had it, a
 certificate of the Office of the Recorder
 of Deeds, a fate accompli, it is kind of
 like the guy who is so busy selling stock
 that he forgot to go ahead and form the
 company. They have incorporated. They
 have gone ahead with all this. They have
 the Institute of Taiwan already in place.
 That is a part of the fact accompli; but
 do we in the Congress have to under-
 write everything that has been done
 down there if we do not agree with it?
 I say let us make them official Govern-
 ment employees. Let us not create the
 fiction. That is all my amendment would
 do. I hope the gentleman from Wiscon-
 sin will agree and I would hope we not
 pull all the pieces apart that have been
 put together; but again let's be honest
 and adopt my amendment. Do we want
 to live by a fiction in this House, or will
 we once in a while deal with reality?
 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. ASHBROOK. I yield to the gen-
 tleman from New York.
 Mr. WOLFF. The gentleman keeps re-
 ferring to fiction. Actually, what we are
 talking about are facts. These are basi-
 cally what the facts are. These are not
 going to be Government employees at
 this time. They are so specifically set up.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the
 gentleman from Ohio has again expired.
 (By unanimous consent, Mr. AsH-          sentatives there, in complete contradis-
 BROOK  was allowed to proceed for I                                                           tinction or contradiction to what the

 Mr. ASHBROOK. May I say, we are          Mr. Chairman, let me ask, has not the

 employees. They are nothing until this   derecognize governments?

 a fact. There is no legal entity in place gentleman is absolutely correct. Under  ~
 which we have to recognize here in Con-  our Constitution it is the President who
 gress.                                   makes the decision.

 Mr. WOLFF. The entity is in place to-    Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, the
 day. The Taiwan Government has al-       gentleman is correct. He has stated ex-
 ready designated their entity. We have                                                        actly what I had intended to state later
 designated our entity. What we are do-   in my remarks, that indeed what this
 ing here in this particular section is ~, nenciment would dO would not help
 trying to protect the people of the.'=/'aiwati.
 United States so that these people who-  This amendment is similar to the
 are serving their connection on a tempo-
 rary basis will be subject to the same
 rules and regulations as if they had
 stayed in the employ of the United
 States.
 Mr. ASHBROOK. They are severed on
 a temporary basis. That is not a fiction.
 They are severing their relationship on
 a temporary basis so they can join an
 entity that is out there in never-never
 land, and that is not a fiction. That is
 a fact.
 [1 1330
 Mr. WOLFF. They are not in a never-
 never land. They are in another office
 set up to deal with the problems between
 our Government and the people on Tai-
 wan. That is all. We are trying to facili-
 tate something that could not exist
 under any other circumstances.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, I rise
 in opposition to the amendment.
 Mr. Chairman, I certainly must ad-
 mire the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.
 ASHBROOK). He is not in a never-never
 land, as far as his intentions are con-
 cerned. The gentleman's amendment
 would require that employees of the en-
 tity be employees of the United States.
 In one respect, because they will be
 working for a  governmentally-desig-
 nated entity, they might be regarded in
 a way as employees of the United States.
 But where the gentleman really spells
 out his true intent is when. he says that
 they shall be employees of an executive
 agency within the meaning of part 3 of
 title V of the United States Code, which
 means Government employees.
 Now, it may be a never-never land or
 whatever, but the President has normal-
 ized relations with the PRC under cer-
 tain conditions, and one of the conditions
 was that our governmental relations with
 Taiwan would have to be severed. We
 indeed had derecognized, so to speak,
 Taiwan on a formal basis. We have
 closed the Embassy in Taipei.
 Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Yes, I yield to the
 gentleman from Missouri.
 Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, let me
 ask the gentleman this question: If this
 amendment were adopted, it would be
 exactly the same'as if we were to estab-
 lish a liaison office on Taiwan, because
 would we not then be putting Govern-
 ment employees or Government repre-
 amendment  that  was  defeated  last
 Thursday; that is the amendment to
 establish a liaison office in Taipei.
 If this amendment were adopted, it
 would fly in the face of the agreement
 made and negotiated with the PRC, and,
 therefore, there would be no recourse or
 there would be no relationship available
 by the United States and no activities
 with Taiwan.
 There is not at the present time an
 embassy there. We do not have any estab-
 lished  governmental  relations.  They
 have been severed. But we do have this
 nongovernmental entity, and we are in
 this legislation providing for staffing the
 personnel for this entity and giving it all
 the protection the gentleman was con-
 cerned about in our colloquy earlier.
 Mr. WHITE. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Texas.
 Mr. WHITE. Mr. Chairman, I would
 like to clairfy for the record the status of
 this particular presence in Taiwan in the
 event the amendment offered by the
 gentleman from Ohio (Mr. AsEBROOK)
 is not agreed to.
 Let us suppose someone is at the entity
 and should develop a tort claim. In other
 words, under the present law, if there
 were a government present, they would
 have a tort claim against the U.S. Gov-
 ernment. Now, how is that addressed in
 this bill, under the present language of
 the bill?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, under
 section 201, subparagraph (b) (1), the
 bill has specific provision to continue
 unchanged the application of the United
 States with respect to Taiwan. Both Tai-
 wan and this country could sue and be
 sued likewise.
 Mr. WHITE. Mr. Chairman, if the
 gentleman will yield further, I am not
 talking about that. I am talking about
 American citizens. Could an American
 citizen sue in the U.S. courts for an
 action taken by a member of this entity
 insofar as they are not government em-
 ployees?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Yes, just as he was
 in a position to sue prior to this time, it
 is intended that it would be possible for
 an injured party to sue the U.S. Govern-
 ment under the Tort Claims Act for in-
 juries resulting from actions of em-
 ployees of- the designated entity.

 has expired.
 (By unanimous consent, Mr. ZABLOCKI
 was allowed to proceed for 2 additional
 minutes.)
 Mr. WHITE. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield further?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Texas.
 ^ 1335
 Mr. WHITE. Where does it say this in
 the bill or in the report?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. In the report on page
 11, and in the bill on page 5, is language
 pertaining to section 202, subparagraph
 (b) (1), on line 17. If I may read, it:
 (b) (1) The laws of the United States which
 apply with respect to agencies of the United
 States Government shall, to the extent the
 President may specify, apply with respect to
 the designated entity as if the designated
 entity were an agency of the United States
 Government.
 Mr. WHITE. But suppose the President
 does not specify the tort claim. It says:
 . to the extent the President may spec-
 ify...
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. The legislation before
 the committee provides:
 (b) (1) The absence of such relations and
 such recognition shall not affect the applica-
 tion of the laws of the United States with
 respect to Taiwan, and the laws'of the United
 States (including laws relating to rights, ob-
 ligations, standing to sue and be sued, legal
 capacity, or eligibility to participate in pro-
 grams and other activities under the laws
 of the United States) shall apply with re-
 spect to Taiwan in the manner that the laws
 of the United States applied with respect
 to Taiwan prior to January 1, 1979.
 We provide, that whatever the situa-
 tion was concerning the rights of Amer-
 ican citizens in any country, particu-
 larly, in this case, in Taiwan, prior to
 January 1, 1979, shall continue.
 Mr. WHITE. I want to say to the chair-
 man that I merely want to point out that
 in every instance the gentleman talked
 about that I want to make sure we have
 an understanding ' that this language
 deals with Taiwan, and I want to make
 sure that we are dealing with American
 citizens and we are dealing with the in-
 tent. I want to make sure the tort claim
 would apply to those specified.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. ZABLOCKI)
 has expired.
 (On request of Mr. ASHBROOK and
 by unanimous consent, Mr. ZABLOCKI was
 allowed to proceed for 2 additional min-
 utes.)
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. In response to the
 gentleman from Texas, the protection of
 the American citizen is intended to be
 as it is now under existing laws of the
 United States.
 Mr. WHITE. I know. But even though
 the President does not specify?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. The President would
 have to specify in some way so that the
 rights of a citizen in tort cases would
 continue as before.
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Ohio.
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Chairman, are
 not the operating words, in response to
 the gentleman from Texas, the words "to
 the extent the President may specify"?
 it very clearly reads:
 The laws of the United States which apply
 with respect to agencies of the United States
 Government shall, to the extent the Presi-
 dent may specify ...
 In any other area, this Congres would
 be up on its heels about giving the Pres-
 ident that much authority. We have
 talked about the rights he has under the
 Constitution. Here we are talking about
 the laws that are passed by the Congress,
 and we are letting the President waive
 them as he might see fit.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. The gentleman from
 Wisconsin would like to clarify or cor-
 rect a prior response. In referring to
 page 5, line 17, that 'was with respect to
 the entity that was authorized.
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Chairman, if
 my colleague will yield, we have the Gov-.
 ernment's ability to decide whether the
 Government should be sued or not sued.
 That is something that is disputed. That
 is not an automatic right of the citizen.
 The President can specify that the Tort
 Liability Act would not be applicable to
 the new entity.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Again, I want to
 make it very clear, and I hope this legis-
 lative history will make it even more
 clear, as to what the intent of Congress
 is. Using section 201(b) (1) as that sec-
 tion applies, the President has no waiver
 authority. Under section 202(b) (1), he
 has the authority to make laws appli-
 cable to U.S. agencies apply to the desig-
 nated entity to the extent necessary.for
 efficient functioning of the entity in
 carrying out its duties and for the pro-
 tection of U.S. citizens.
 ^ 1340
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the
 gentleman from Wisconsin has again
 expired.
 (By unanimous consent Mr. ZABLOCKI
 was allowed to proceed for 1 additional
 minute.)
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Further as to the au-
 thority that the President has on page 5,
 section 202(b) (1), that is in reference
 to the agencies of the U.S. Government.
 In this case, it would also be the desig-
 nated entity.
 Mr. ASHBROOK. I thank my col-
 league for his answer.
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. Mr. Chairman, I
 move to strike the requisite number of
 words.
 Mr. Chairman, I think that the gen-
 tleman's amendment needs more discus-'
 sion in areas really not addressed by him,
 because I feel under the legislation before
 us that the employee would be taken care
 of nonetheless either under the bill, or as
 the gentleman suggests.
 My concern is to what I deem to be
 inconsistencies in the legislation. This is
 so important, Mr. Chairman, that we
 must have legislative history because I
 have not been privy, unfortunately, to
 the hearings held by this prestigious
 committee and by the gentleman from
 Wisconsin: Last year, when I temporarily
 was serving on this committee, I was
 privy to no information at all, and I
 heard on the television the great an-
 nouncement of what we were about to do.
 So, having not been consulted then, I
 doubt that I will be consulted now or in
 the future.
 My question is, page 5, section 202(b)
 (1) says that the President can make
 anything he 'wants, specifying as if it
 were an agency of the U.S. Government.
 But, over here where we were talking
 previously, it says, "All treaties and in-
 ternational agreements ? ? ?" and so
 forth, on page 4, "? * * or otherwise in
 accordance with the laws of the United
 States." That is at the bottom of page 4.
 Now, on (b) (1), lines 17 to 21, page 5,
 it seems that here we give the 'President
 authority to go back and undo some of
 what I read heretofore. Also, why have
 we given the President the authority here
 with regards to laws of the United States
 related to agencies, why then do we
 prohibit him on page 9 by saying that the
 employee shall not be deemed the em-
 ployee of the United States? Some peo-
 ple are saying that this is a deal struck
 with the PRC. Well, I was not privy to
 that, and it may well be, but to what ex-
 tent are we going to allow the PRC to
 conduct the affairs of this House and of
 this country?
 Some of us need some satisfaction that
 we. know or will have reasonable knowl-
 edge of what is going to happen, because
 as' I see it here, we let the President do
 or undo whatever he wants as far as
 specifying or not specifying.
 Then, how do we handle this? This is
 very important. How do we handle any
 activity of the Secretary of State related
 to the designated agency? How do we
 handle any'activity on any given day by
 the Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern
 Affairs relating to the designated agency?
 How do we handle any individual spend-
 ing one minute of time related to the
 designated agency? Does he for that 1
 minute lose his employment with the U.S.
 Government?
 ^ 1345
 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. Let me yield to the
 chairman of the Committee on Foreign
 Affairs first, the gentleman from Wiscon-
 sin (Mr. ZABLOCKI).
 Mr.  ZABLOCKI. Mr.  Chairman,  I
 thank the gentleman for yielding. How-
 ever, -I would prefer that the gentleman
 yield to the gentleman from New York
 because I understand that this question
 has been clarified in hearings. The
 gentleman from New York (Mr. WOLFF),.
 is in a better position to deal with this
 matter since he chaired the Subcommit-
 tee on Asian and Pacific Affairs.
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. Mr. Chairman; I
 thank the distinguished gentleman of
 the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and I
 yield to my colleague, the gentleman
 from New York (Mr. WOLFF)
 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Chairman, first of all,
 in response to 'the latter part of the
 question, does the gentleman really be-
 lieve that we have any control over the
 Secretary of State now, regardless of
 whatever place in the world he deals
 with?
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. We should have.
 Mr. WOLFF. We should have, but, in

 to control the activities of the Secretary
 of State.
 We do have within the aegis of this
 committee  oversight  responsibilities.
 These oversight responsibilities are taken
 up by the chairman of the Subcommittee
 on International Operations.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman from Texas (Mr. DE LA GARZA)
 has expired.
 (By unanimous consent Mr. DE LA
 GARZA was allowed to proceed for 2 addi-
 tional minutes.)
 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield further?
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. I yield to the gen-
 tleman from New York
 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Chairman, only this
 morning in a hearing before the Com-
 ,.mittee on International Operations, the
 ranking member of the committee and
 the chairman of that committee told
 the full committee that they would ex-
 ercise the oversight responsibility over
 the American Institute on Taiwan. Really
 what is happening here, with all due re-
 spect to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
 DE LA GARZA), is a determination as to
 whether or not we should have govern-
 ment-to-government relations. That is
 basically what is involved in this amend-
 ment which the gentleman has just of-
 fered, and it is basically what is involved
 in most amendments and subsequent
 ones which will be coming up.
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. Mr. Chairman, I
 appreciate the gentleman's comments.
 However, that is not my immediate
 concern. I have great confidence in the
 gentleman from Florida as far as over-
 sight is concerned.
 My immediate concern is, nonetheless,
 that we go back and forth here; and I as
 one Member of this House do not want
 to yield 1 ounce of legislative jurisdic-
 tion which we might have. I say again
 that I am not clear as to what area or
 what agreements were made with the
 PRC. I do not know. I am dealing from
 a very inadequate position.
 What I would like to do is to affirm
 here what our legislative intent is, if we
 could.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Wisconsin.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, I un-
 derstand fully the gentleman's concern.
 However, let me make it indelibly clear
 that page 4, section 201, is a very impor-
 tant section -which states that all U.S.
 laws will continue to apply with respect
 to Taiwan notwithstanding the with-
 drawal of U.S. diplomatic relations.
 The Presidential flexibility of waiver
 which is included in section 202 does not
 apply.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman from Texas (Mr. DE LA GARZA)
 has expired.
 (By unanimous consent, Mr. DE  LA
 GARZA was allowed to proceed for 2 ad-
 ditional minutes.)
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. If the gentleman will
 yield further, Mr. Chairman, the purpose
 for the waiver of authority in section 202
 (b) (1) is that the waiver of authority is
 only given to the President to the extent
 that it deals with the entity. The present
 flexibility in section 202, as far as the
 gentleman from Wisconsin is concerned
 and as far as the sponsors of the legis-
 lation, the Committee on Foreign Affairs,
 are concerned, is to express the intent
 that we allow the President to move
 closer on a government-to-government
 relations basis with the authorities on
 Taiwan if he chooses, but it does not
 mean that he must be limited. In other
 words, he does not have to limit U.S.
 dealings with Taiwan to those conducted
 to the nongovernmental entity, although
 he is given that authority to do so.
 Mr. Chairman, I submit that this is
 necessary to deal with this matter at this
 time in a nongovernmental basis in order
 to continue our activities and our rela-
 tionships with Taiwan.
 I would prefer to call this bill the Tai-
 wan Protective Act because it is going to
 protect the interests which we have and
 the interests which Taiwan has in con-
 tinuing  relations  with  the  United
 States.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the
 gentleman from Texas (Mr. DE LA GARZA)
 has again expired.
 (By unanimous  consent,  Mr. DE  LA
 GARZA was allowed to proceed for 2 ad-
 ditional minutes.)
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Chairman, will
 my colleague, the gentleman from Texas,
 yield?
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. Let me just make
 this statement, and then I will be happy
 to yield.
 Nonetheless, if I read English correct-
 ly, we say in one section-and this lan-
 guage is on page 4 of the bill-"otherwise
 in accordance with laws of the United
 States."
 Then on page 5, section 202(b) (1) this
 language appears:
 The laws of the United States which apply
 with respect to agencies of the United States
 Government shall, to the extent the Presi-
 dent may specify, apply with respect to the
 designated entity as if the designated entity
 were an agency of the United States Govern-
 ment.
 ^ 1350
 These are the sections of this bill
 which shall apply to the entity, and as
 I read them we revert to any action the
 President takes.
 My concern is let us say Taiwan is a
 member of a fisheries agreement among
 five countries. We say we do not abro-
 gate that agreement. We cannot. That
 is up to that entity to abrogate it. But,
 nevertheless, who is going to participate
 with the United States with the daily
 activities of that agreement, or the an-
 nual activities-the designated entity, or
 the Secretary of State, or the Depart-
 ment of Commerce? Who participates
 in those matters?
 Mr. Chairman, this deals with far too
 important a matter to be here having
 it dealt with a minute at a time: Some
 of us need some assurances. Again re-
 peating, not being a member of this
 distinguished committee, I am asking
 the chairman, the gentleman from Wis-
 consin, for assurance.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. I yield to the gen-
 tleman from Wisconsin.
 II 1263
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I thank the- gentle-
 man for yielding.
 I can give the gentleman that assur-
 ance. Section 202(b) (1) says:
 The laws of the United States which apply
 with respect to agencies of the United States
 Government shall, to the extent the Presi-
 dent may specify, apply with respect to the
 designated entity ... 11
 The gentleman's concern is unwar-
 ranted.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman has expired.
 (At the request of Mr. AsHBROOx, and
 by unanimous consent, Mr. DE LA GARZA
 was allowed to proceed for 2 additional
 minutes.)
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Chairman, will
 my colleague yield?
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Ohio.
 Mr. ASHBROOK. I thank the gentle-
 man for yielding.
 With all honesty, my good friend, the
 gentleman from Wisconsin  (Mr. ZA-
 BLOCxI) cannot make an assurance of
 that type. Read section 202. We are talk-
 ing about the President of the United
 States. In one section the gentleman says
 "to the extent the President may specify,
 ? *.",That is the law. Later on the
 section says, "upon such terms and con-
 ditions as the President may direct."
 Down at the bottom another operative
 phrase says : "The President is author-
 ized to extend     ' such privileges and
 immunities  ? as may be necessary
 for the effective performance of their
 functions."
 Add those three up. "To the extent
 the President may specify," "such terms
 and conditions as the President may
 direct," and he can add "such privileges
 and immunities" as he finds necessary.
 No one can make assurances as to what
 this President or a subsequent President
 will do with that broad authority, which
 now comes not under the Constitution,
 not under the powers of dealing with
 foreign nations, but under what we are
 extending to him as a Congress, as a
 governing part of law. So there is no way
 my friend, the gentleman from Wiscon-
 sin (Mr. ZABLOCKI) can make the assur-
 ances he just made to my friend, the gen-
 tleman from Texas (Mr. DE LA GARZA).
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman has expired.
 Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Chairman, I
 move to strike the requisite number of
 words, and I rise in support of the
 amendment.
 (Mr.. DERWINSKI asked and was
 given permission to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Chairman, this
 has been a subject that could well have
 provoked an emotional atmosphere. It
 has not. I commend all the Members for
 maintaining an objective, calm, practi-
 cal-I would call it diplomatic-attitude
 toward this measure. But I want the
 Members on my side of the aisle to un-
 derstand that it bothers me a bit when
 they use any statement in debate to crit-
 icize our President. I happen to have the
 highest regard for our President not-
 withstanding his tendency toward im-
 perfection. I think that we should de-

 bate this bill without using. it as a vehicle
 to criticize the President.
 May I say to the Members on the ma-
 jority side that, keeping in mind this
 great respect I have for our President,
 it pains me when I hear some of them
 discuss the virtues of the senior Senator
 from Massachusetts, or the Governor of
 California. I do not think either of those
 gentlemen could fill the shoes of our be-
 loved President. Now having said that,
 I am about to get to the point,of sup-
 porting the gentleman's amendment.
 0 1355
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Will the gentleman
 yield?
 Mr. DERWINSKI. I yield to the
 gentleman from Ohio (Mr. ASHBROOK).
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Before we get too
 far, I very carefully said: This President
 or a subsequent President. I would add
 that my response would be the same if
 this whole charade had been in existence
 during the administration of a previous
 President. We are not talking about
 any President who would have wide lati-
 tude and authority.
 Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Chairman, I ac-
 cept that as the gentleman's joining me
 in the acceptance of our President's good
 character.
 The gentleman from Ohio in propos-
 ing his amendment should have labeled
 it "An amendment to end double talk."
 I refer the gentleman to section 203,
 page 7 of the bill. I call his attention to
 the fact that subparagraph 3 reads:
 (3) An officer or employee entitled to re-
 instatement rights under paragraph (2) of
 this  subsection  shall,  while  continuously
 employed by the designated entity with no
 break in continuity of service, continue to
 participate in any benefit program in which
 such officer or employee was participating
 prior to employment.
 This means as you read further a Fed-
 eral employee will continue to receive
 his health insurance, his retirement cov-
 erage, his life insurance, all the benefits
 of Federal employment. When he returns
 from this entity, returns to employment
 within the Federal structure, he keeps
 all of his seniority, he transfers to what-
 ever position he is entitled to or pro-
 moted to and, here is the key point, that
 while in the service of this entitly, if by
 death or retirement his service is inter-
 rupted, he shall be considered a Federal
 employee. So all the gentleman from
 Ohio is doing is saying the obvious, that
 for everything but terminology, these
 people will be Federal employees.
 I predict to the gentleman that 6
 months from now whoever heads this
 entity will be affectionately known in
 Taiwan as the Ambassador of the Unit-
 ed States. That is a fact of life. It is
 just as natural as night following day.
 The gentleman from Ohio is just ask-
 ing that our employees who will be Fed-
 eral employees, who will not accept this
 assignment unless they are told their
 Federal employee rights will be guaran-
 teed, that they shall in fact be designated
 as Federal employees.
 I think it is a good amendment, I think
 it is a practical amendment, I think it
 is in the interests of the employees. I also
 suggest that you are setting a dangerous
 precedent through this legislation if you
 do not in fact acknowledge that a Fed-
 eral employee is nothing but that. You
 should want him to be known as a Fed-
 eral employee and I would urge support
 of the amendment.
 Mr. BAUMAN. Will the gentleman
 yield?
 Mr. DERWINSKI. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Maryland.
 Mr. BADMAN. Is it not true this des-
 ignated agency or entity or whatever
 they finally call it in fact be using ap-
 propriated funds which will come from
 this Congress and if we do not adopt an
 amendment of this nature it will not be
 at all clear that we have control over
 the taxpayers' money or the people that
 are spending it?
 it is virtually unprecedented that Con-
 gress would hand out millions of dollars
 of tax moneys to an entity to be spent
 when it is not under our control.
 Mr. DERWINSKI. We will be appro-
 priating money from the taxpayers.
 The CHAIRMAN. The question is on
 the amendment offered by the gentle-
 man from Ohio (Mr. AsHBROOK) .
 The question was taken; and the
 Chairman being in doubt, the committee
 divided,  and  there  were-ayes  28,

 ^ 1415
 Mr. DANIEL B. CRANE changed his
 vote from "no" to "aye."
 So the amendment was rejected.
 The result of the vote was announced
 as above recorded.
 The CHAIRMAN. Are there other
 amendments to title II?
 AMENDMENT OFFERED HY MR. EDWARDS OF
 OKLAHOMA
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. Mr.
 Chairman, I offer an amendment.
 The Clerk read as follows:
 Amendment offered by Mr. EDWARDS Of
 Of Oklahoma: On page 10, line 12, strike out
 ""and the Pescadores" and insert In lieu
 thereof  "the  Pescadores,  Quemoy,  and
 Matsu".
 (Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma asked
 'and was given permission to revise and
 extend his remarks.)
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. Mr.
 Chairman, the amendment which I have
 offered Is very simple and uncomplicated.
 It merely broadens the definition of the
 term "Taiwan" to Include not only the
 island of Taiwan and the islands of the
 Pescadores chain, but also those two is-
 lands which mean so much to the de-
 fense of Taiwan, the islands of Quemoy
 and Matsu.
 On these two islands live 76,000 free
 Chinese. Moreover, these two islands
 contain a substantial of Taiwan's armed
 forces.
 ^ 1420
 Mr. Chairman, to exclude the two
 islands of Quemoy and Matsu from this
 act Is an open invitation to Peking to
 attack these islands without so much as
 a suggestion from us that it might be of
 some concern to the United States.
 Some  people,  knowing  that  this
 amendment was going to be offered, have
 argued that the Mutual Defense Treaty
 of 1954 did not extend to. these islands,
 and that to include them in this act goes
 beyond what we were willing to do previ-
 ously. But what was our previous com-
 mitment? To furnish military equip-
 ment. To furnish our Air Force, our Navy,
 our fighting men and women, if neces-
 sary, to defend the freedom of the Re-
 public of China. But what are our re-
 sponsibilities to Taiwan under this act
 now before us? Only to express our grave
 concern.
 I must say that I do not know, Mr.
 Chairman, whether having grave con-
 cern Is more or less than to deplore or
 to condemn, since rhetoric is relative.
 But all this is a statement of concern.
 Is the United States so afraid to be an
 International power that it fears
 extend- ing even its concern for the freedom and
 safety of the 76,000 Chinese on Quemoy
 and Matsu? Who here seriously believes
 that this administration would be willing
 to do anything more than to deplore a
 Communist attack on these islands? But
 if Peking sees that the Congress of the
 United States is willing to extend its
 concern at least to Quemoy and Matsu,
 perhaps that would be some deterrent
 to any attack on those islands.
 In the last Congress we expressed our
 outrage over the treatment of Jews in
 the Soviet Union and blacks In South
 Africa. Today will we extend that same
 concern for the very freedom and safety
 of the 76,000 Chinese on Quemoy and
 Matsu? This act incorporates a new re-
 lationship between the people on Taiwan
 and the people of the United States. The
 President has requested an end to the
 government-to-government relationship.
 We in the House now have the responsi-
 bility to speak for the people of the
 United States in this new relationship.
 There is no precedent for this corporate-
 to-corporate format, but the President,
 constitutionally entrusted with the con-
 duct of our foreign policy, has chosen
 to have a corporation represent our in-
 terests in Taiwan. I do not believe the
 President can have it both ways, as some
 of my colleagues have suggested. We in
 the House must exercise our constitu-
 tional responsibility to protect American
 interests and to shape our future policy
 toward the people of Taiwan.
 Hermann Hesse, in his book, "Demi-
 an," wrote that Europe had conquered
 the whole world only to lose her own
 soul. Mr. Chairman, a nation is like a
 man. It must keep its soul. It must do
 what is right. I submit that this amend-
 ment-this amendment which does no
 more than express our national concern
 for the safety of the Chinese on Quemoy
 and Matsu, and which recognizes the
 danger to all of Taiwan if those islands
 fall-will help this Nation, this great
 Nation of ours, to do the right thing and
 keep its soul.
 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. I yield
 to the gentleman from New York.
 Mr. WOLFF. I thank the gentleman
 for yielding.
 Is the gentleman aware that there
 are a number of other islands which are
 under the control now of the present
 Government on Taiwan? Those islands
 would not be covered. In other words,
 what we would do, then, is exclude those
 islands. Or does the gentleman mean
 that this resolution would apply to all
 of the islands that are now under the
 control of Taiwan.
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. This
 amendment applies only to covering un-
 der the definition of Taiwan the island
 of Taiwan itself, the Pescadores chain,
 Quemoy, and Matsu.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the
 gentleman has expired.
 (At the request of Mr. WOLFF, and by
 unanimous consent, Mr. EDWARDS of
 Oklahoma was allowed to proceed for
 2 additional minutes.)
 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. I yield
 to the gentleman from New York.
 Mr. WOLFF. I thank the gentleman for
 yielding.
 On page 16 of the report we specifi-
 cally refer to Quemoy and Matsu. The
 indications are that the above defini-
 tions are illustrative but not limiting the
 term "laws of the United States" and
 "Taiwan" are to be construed expansively
 to carry out the purposes of this act.
 "Thus, for example, the term `Taiwan'
 may in some contexts appropriately en-
 compass the islands of Quemoy and
 Matsu, as well as other islands governed
 H 1265
 by authorities exercising government
 control on Taiwan."
 Basically, this issue was fought back
 in 1954 when the Mutual Defense Treaty,
 was passed and entered into by this
 Government. At that time it was felt
 that we should exclude both Quemoy and
 Matsu from the agreement. In fact, the
 Formosa Act was repealed In 1974 again
 on that basis of Quemoy and Matsu.
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. If I
 may reclaim my time to respond to the
 gentleman, first of all I acknowledge
 what is in the report. Unfortunately, we
 will not be voting on the report. The
 report is not what is before us. We are
 voting on the bill, and the bill does not
 Include Quemoy and Matsu in the defi-
 nition.
 ^ 1425
 Secondly, I will repeat the point I
 made earlier that the decision that was
 made in 1954 referred to a defense treaty
 which called for the commitment of
 American military force. What we have
 before us here is merely an expression of
 our "grave concern" and I would suggest
 to the gentleman that It Is not asking
 too much that this great body, represent-
 ing this great and powerful country of
 ours, be willing to say that we consider
 that an attack on Taiwan, Quemoy, or
 Matsu would be a threat to the peace and
 stability of the Western area and of grave
 concern to the United States. This is all
 we are talking about.
 Mr. WOLFF. Will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. I yield to
 the gentleman from New York.
 Mr. WOLFF. It is the Spratly Islands
 today.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the
 gentleman from Oklahoma has again ex-
 pired.
 (At the request of Mr. LAGOMARSINO,
 and by unanimous consent, Mr. EDWARDS
 of Oklahoma was allowed to proceed for
 2 additional minutes.)
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Will the gentle-
 man yield?
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. I yield
 to the gentleman from California.
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. I offered the
 same amendment in committee and many
 of the same arguments we are hearing
 this afternon were used against it at that
 time.
 I think the gentleman made a good
 point as to whether or not language in a
 report would be helpful here. I submit
 that we are partly in the problem that we
 are in today because the President and
 his administration not only does not par-
 ticularly pay attention to language in
 reports but sometimes language in legis-
 lation itself does not get proper attention,
 as with the language in the Security
 Assistance Act of last year, which man-
 dated the President to consult with Con-
 gress before taking any action in this
 field.
 It seems to me the other point the gen-
 tleman made; namely, that the reactions
 that would occur should there be an at-
 tack on or threat to Quemoy and Matsu
 would be determined by the administra-
 tion in consultation with Congress and
 there are certainly no requirements that
 that action would be the same as if the
 Island of Taiwan itself were attacked. It

 is ambiguous now; to clear up that am-
 biguity the amendment should not be
 adopted.
 Mr. WOLFF. Would the gentleman
 yield further?
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. I yield
 to the gentleman from New York.
 Mr. WOLFF. The point I was trying to
 make before is the fact that while the
 Spratly Islands are very highly contest-
 ed islands, and very valuable resources
 to Taiwan, you do not cover them. The
 reason we did not cover specifically the
 territories that Taiwan exercises control
 over is to be all-encompassing so that
 the areas that are now governed by the
 present Government on Taiwan would
 be all-inclusive in this bill.
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. May I
 say to the gentleman that the difference
 is the location of Quemoy and Matsu
 and the fact that a very sizable portion
 of the armed forces of Taiwan is lo-
 cated on Quemoy and Matsu and that
 therefore a threat or an attack against
 Quemoy and Matsu would pose a grave
 peril to the safety of Taiwan itself.
 Mr. WOLFF. Will the gentleman yield
 further?
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. I yield
 to the gentleman from New York.
 Mr. WOLFF. However the territories
 of Quemoy and Matsu are considered
 part of this.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman from Oklahoma has again ex-
 pired.
 (At the request of Mr. SKELTON, . and
 by unanimous consent, Mr. EDWARDS of
 Oklahoma was allowed to proceed for 1
 additional minute.)
 Mr. SKELTON. Will the gentleman
 yield?
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. I yield
 to the gentleman from Missouri.
 Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, actu-
 ally talking about the Islands of Que-
 moy and Matsu, as it was referred to by
 the subcommittee chairman, the gentle-
 man from New York (Mr. WOLF ) that
 the battle was fought back in 1954. There
 was a subsequent battle over these is-
 lands-and I think it was debated all over
 the Nation and decided at that time in
 the elections of 1960 between the con-
 tenders for the Presidency, President
 Kennedy and then Vice President Nixon,
 it was settled then. Does the gentleman
 not agree?
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. If I may
 respond to the gentleman, no, I do not
 agree. That was the point I was making
 to the gentleman from New York. In 1954
 and then in 1960 were referring to a
 defense treaty, we were talking about a
 commitment by this' country to.provide
 servicemen to defend these islands. Now
 we are only talking about whether or
 not we as a people would express our
 "grave concern" in the case of an attack
 against those islands. That is not hardly
 the same point.
 ^ 1430.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, I rise
 in opposition to the amendment.
 (Mr. ZABLOCKI asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, I have
 taken the well rather than speaking from
 the mike at the table because I can hear
 myself better here, and I do not get such
 an overtone as I do at the mike at the
 table.
 Adoption of this amendment, Mr.
 Chairman, would be unwise. The pro-
 posed amendment offered by the gentle-
 man from Oklahoma (Mr. EDWARDS) has,
 indeed been, considered in the Foreign
 Affairs Committee and rejected. As the
 chairman of the Subcommittee on Asian
 and Pacific Affairs has stated, in refer-
 ring to the language on page 16 of the
 report, the term, "Taiwan," may in some
 context appropriately encompass the is-
 lands of Quemoy and Matsu, as well as
 other islands governed by authorities ex-
 ercising government control on Taiwan.
 Quemoy and Matsu, Mr. Chairman.
 were deliberately left out of the mutual
 defense treaty, and I' am sure my col-
 leagues will agree with the members of
 the committee that we should not be
 expanding the U.S. security commitment
 beyond what was in the treaty. Quemoy
 and Matsu are considered by both Taipei
 and by Peking to -be part of mainland
 China. They are in the province of Fu-
 kien. Quemoy is only 7 miles offshore,
 and Matsu is 12 off the mainland coast.
 They have been the repeated targets of
 shellfire, including propaganda shelling.
 Any shelling of the islands in the future
 would be of grave concern to the United
 States. We should consider this.
 Does the United States want to regard
 the shelling of the islands as of "grave
 concern" to our country? In 1974 the
 Congress repealed the Formosa resolu-
 tion in part because it implied a possible
 U.S. security commitment to these is-
 lands.
 As I stated earlier, the reference in
 the committee report deals with a dif-
 ferent context. It applies to a situation
 in which there could be commercial, cul-
 tural, and other exchange programs,
 which already extends to the people on
 these islands because they are under the
 Taiwan Government's control and which
 we want to continue to apply.
 Yes, Mr. Chairman, it would be unwise
 for this bill to specify that the offshore
 islands of Quemoy and Matsu are within
 the definition of "Taiwan." We should
 recall, as I said earlier, that these is-
 lands are on the outskirts of the main-
 land. They are not a part of Taiwan
 per se. They were not included in the
 mutual security treaty, and both the ad-
 ministration and Congress have recog-
 nized the danger of any implication of a
 U.S. security commitment to these is-
 lands, and we, therefore, as I said, re-
 pealed the Formosa regolution.
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. Mr.
 Chairman, will the gentleman yield to
 me?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I will yield in just a
 few seconds.
 Mr. Chairman, as far as the participa-
 tion of people from Quemoy and Matsu
 are concerned in commercial or exchange
 programs, again I must point out the re-
 port of the Committee on Foreign Affairs
 makes it clear that no bar is intended.
 and thus, as an example, the term "Tai-
 wan," as'I said earlier, in our definition
 and in the report may in some contexts
 appropriately encompass the islands of
 Quemoy and Matsu. And we might even
 include certain other small islands which
 the gentleman's amendment does not
 include.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the
 gentleman from Wisconsin  (Mr. ZA-
 BLOCKI) has expired.
 (On request of Mr. EDWARDS of Okla-
 homa, and by unanimous consent, Mr.
 ZABLOCKI was allowed to proceed for 1
 additional minute.)
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. Mr.
 Chairman, will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I yield to the gentle-
 from Oklahoma.
 man
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. Mr.
 Chairman, I have asked the chairman of
 the committee to yield only that I might,,
 make two points.
 The first point is this: The chairman
 of the committee refers to .the fact that
 the report states that in some contexts
 Quemoy and Matsu might be included
 in the definition of "Taiwan." But the
 chairman of the committee cannot tell
 us, and the report does not tell us, who
 will determine in what context Quemoy
 and Matsu will be included.
 My second point is this, if I may re-
 peat a point that I made earlier: This is
 not a security commitment. The com-
 mittee chairman referred to a security
 commitment but this is merely a state-
 ment that a threat to Quemoy and Matsu
 would be of grave concern to us. I sub-
 mit that to specifically exclude Quemoy
 and Matsu from this. bill is to say in
 effect to Peking that a threat to Quemoy
 and Matsu would not be of concern to us.
 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman
 for yielding.
 ^ 1435
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. As far as the ref-
 erence in the committee report is con-
 cerned, it does not extend our security
 commitment in its referral to Quemoy
 and Matsu.
 The CHAIRMAN. The question is on
 the amendment offered by the gentle-
 man from Oklahoma (Mr. EDWARDS).
 The question was taken; and on a di-
 vision (demanded by Mr. EDWARDS of
 Oklahoma) there were-ayes 30, noes 45.

 Mr. DERRICK changed his vote from
 "aye" to "no."
 Mr. STRATTON changed his vote from
 "no" to "aye."
 So the amendment was rejected.
 The result of the vote was announced
 as above recorded.
 ^ 1455
 The CHAIRMAN. Are there further
 amendments to title II?
 Mr. FINDLEY. Mr. Chairman, I move
 to strike the last word.
 Mr. Chairman, it is very important, I
 think, that we have the fullest possible
 clarification of the language in this reso-
 lution. In the light of some of the com-
 ments made last week'in consideration
 of this bill by the gentleman from New
 York (Mr. STRATTON) I reexamined sec-
 tion 101 and I would appreciate it if the
 distinguished chairman of the House
 Foreign Affairs Committee would help me
 clarify the effect of section 101.
 It is my understanding, Mr. Chairman,
 that nothing in this legislation should be
 construed or can properly be construed
 as giving the President any authority or
 direction in respect to the use of U.S. mil-
 itary forces which he would not already
 have in the absence of this legislation. Is
 that the gentleman's interpretation of
 the resolution?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Will the gentleman
 yield?
 Mr. FINDLEY. I do yield.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, I
 thank the gentleman for yielding.
 The gentleman has interpreted the in-
 tent of this legislation very accurately. In
 no way does this legislation give the
 President any more authority in the use
 of military forces employed in the areas
 of combat than he already has, and the
 provisions of the War Powers Act will
 continue to apply.
 Mr. FINDLEY. Mr. Chairman, may I
 further ask the gentleman if he would
 agree with this statement that it can-
 not properly be construed, the resolution
 cannot properly be construed as author-
 izing or suggesting the use of U.S. mili-
 tary forces in any particular circum-
 stance or in response to any threat or
 danger. Am I correct?
 .  Mr. ZABLOCKI. Will the gentleman
 yield?
 Mr. FINDLEY. Yes.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Yes, the gentleman is
 correct.
 Mr. STRATTON. Will the gentleman
 yield to me since he mentioned my name?
 Mr. FINDLEY. I will be glad to yield to
 the gentleman from New York.
 Mr. STRATTON. The gentleman said
 his query of the chairman came from the
 colloquy that I had on this floor last
 week. Now, that colloquy simply went to
 the point that the language in the reso-
 lution which you have before you specifi-
 cally spelled out precisely the same cap-
 ability to do the things that the gentle-
 man is referring to that were also con-
 tained in the '114utual Defense Treaty;
 namely, to take such 'action as was
 deemed proper by the President and
 Congress under our constitutional proce-
 dures.
 The gentleman's colloquy just now
 with the gentleman from Wisconsin,
 however, suggests that in some way this
 particular section degrades the capabil-
 ity of the United States to respond from
 what it would have prevailed under the
 still existing defense treaty.
 Mr. FINDLEY. Mr. Chairman, if the
 gentleman would permit me to respond,
 there were similarities in the language of
 the Mutual Defense Treaty and section
 101 of this resolution. It was not identical
 language. In fact, my examination after
 the gentleman very. thoughtfully called
 my attention to dissimilarities led me to
 conclude that the differences were sub-
 stantial but in order to eliminate any
 possible question as to the effect of this
 legislation, in authorizing or not author-
 izing the use of military forces, I wel-
 comed the clarification by the gentleman
 from Wisconsin, the chairman of the
 Committee on Foreign Affairs.
 Mr. STRATTON. If the gentleman will
 yield further, it is hard for me to see how
 the gentleman can get that out of the
 relatively minor differences in the lan-
 guage unless we are beginning to inter-
 pret English in some different way. No-
 body suggested that under the treaty
 that the President could go to war except
 through appropriate procedures estab-
 lished by the Congress. That is also pre-
 cisely what the resolution at hand does.
 I think that a simple statement by the
 gentleman from Wisconsin is adequate to
 support the conclusion that there are
 profound differences in meaning between
 the language of the resolution and the
 language of the defense treaty. The gen-
 tleman from Illinois ought to set forth
 the reason for his belief rather than sim-
 ply suggest that a statement by the gen-
 tleman from Wisconsin, establishes a leg-
 islative history when that interpretation
 is not backed up by the words that are in
 print.           1
 Mr. FINDLEY. If the gentleman will
 permit me to respond, the gentleman
 from Wisconsin is the author of the leg-
 islation, he presided over all the hear-
 ings, directed a very intensive staff scru-
 tiny and, in fact, the staff he directed
 entered very heavily into the construc-
 tion of the legislation itself.
 ^ 1550
 So his word does, of course, add enor-
 mous weight to legislative history. The
 differences between the language in the

 CONGR]ESSIIONAL RECORD RECORD-HOUSE           March 13, 1979
 mutual defense treaty and the language
 in section 101 are, of course, very impor-
 tant, and the differences are substantial.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman from New York (Mr. STRATTON)
 has expired.
 (On request of Mr. FINDLEY, and by
 unanimous consent, Mr. STRATTON' Was
 allowed to proceed for 2 additional
 minutes.)
 Mr. FINDLEY. But to me, Mr. Chair-
 man, the important thing is not the effect
 of mutual defense treaty language but
 the effect of the language now before us,
 and I think the gentleman from Wiscon-
 sin (Mr. ZABLOCKI) has rendered a great
 service in helping to clarify the effect
 and the parameters of this language.
 Mr. STRATTON. Mr. Chairman, let
 me ask the gentleman what are the dif-
 ferences that the gentleman bases this
 conclusion on, if he would be so good as
 to spell them out?
 Mr. FINDLEY. The differences be-
 tween what and what?
 Mr. STRATTON. Between the lan-
 guage that is before us and the language
 of the defense treaty.
 Mr. FINDL,EY. If the gentleman could
 supply me with the language of the
 treaty. I could respond better. I do not,
 frankly, happen to have it right before
 me.
 Mr. STRATTON. In other words, the
 gentleman admits that he does, not know
 what he is talking about.
 Mr. FINDLEY. The gentleman from
 New York (Mr. STRATTON) is, of course,
 entitled to his own interpretation of my
 position, but if he would examine the
 language of the treaty and the language
 of the legislation before us, he would see
 very distinct differences.
 In fact, any reasonable interpretation
 of the treaty language would show that
 it calls upon the President, of course,
 through constitutional procedures, to act
 to meet 'any danger. That is the critical
 difference. I do not have the precise lan-
 guage, but I think I may very wellhave
 used the exact words in what I have just
 stated.
 Mr. BAUMAN. Mr. Chairman. I move
 to strike the requisite number of words.
 Mr. Chairman, I take this time in
 response to the gentleman from Illinois
 (Mr. FINDLEY) and the gentleman from
 Wisconsin (Mr. ZABLOCKI)..During the
 hearings before the Committee on Rules
 on this legislation, I raised this same
 question with the gentleman from Wis-
 consin, because I read the provisions of
 the legislation. I call the attention of the
 committee to page 5., section 202(b) (1),
 that reads:
 The laws of the United States ... shall
 ... apply to the extent ~ the President may
 And then section 202(b) (2) says:
 Any agency of the United ,States Govern-
 ment may sell, loan, or learn property ...
 Taken together that language allows
 the President to use this designated
 agency as a conduit which could allow
 defense materials and all sorts of weap-
 ons to be transferred to the counterpart
 entity on Taiwan.
 It seems to me that a future President
 who is not so sanguine in defending the
 interests of Taiwan might decide the
 War Powers Act should be waived. It
 seems to me the language is plain here
 that it gives him that authority. These
 provisions point up the broad nature of
 the authority contained in this legisla-
 tion. I do not think any of my liberal
 colleagues who were so concerned about
 the actions of a Lyndon Johnson or
 others in regard to the Vietnam war
 should be so placid in their acceptance
 of particular language.
 There it is. It is right there before us.
 All the legislative history the courts
 have held is not worth a tinkers dam, as
 opposed to what the law says as it is
 written on the books.
 Mr. FINDLEY. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. BAUMAN: I yield to the gentleman
 from Illinois. '
 Mr. FINDLEY. Mr. Chairman, I am
 curious to know the gentleman's inter-
 pretation as to the effect of section 101.
 'I think it is the (b) section, the para-
 graph that contains the word, "action."
 Mr. BAUMAN. Yes, but the gentleman
 from Illinois (Mr. FnvDLEY) fully knows
 the history of the Vietnam conflict. It
 was not a declaration of war that got us
 into the situation there, it was a piece-
 meal approach.
 Mr. FINDLEY. That is true.
 Mr. BAUMAN. The problem came after
 years and years of attrition by Presidents
 of both parties, sending troops and send-
 ing weapons, and so on. That was the
 genisis of the problem.
 Here in this bill there is the possibility
 of the same kind of arrangement, but
 sanctioned bylaw.
 On the President's own authority, he
 can waive the War Powers Act, and he
 may specifically waive it with respect to
 the designated entity and turn that en-
 tity into a conduit for arms to be sent to
 Taiwan. If the gentleman is concerned
 about this as it regards one part of Asia,
 it seems to me he should be consistent
 and be concerned as it pertains to
 Taiwan.
 Mr. FINDLEY. Mr. Chairman, I won-
 der if the gentleman would comment on
 the effect of this sentence:
 The President and the Congress shall de-
 termine, in accordance with constitutional
 processes, appropriate action by the United
 States in response to any such danger.
 0 1505
 Mr. BAUMAN. Mr. Chairman, the con-
 stitutional process requires an act of war
 to have the approval of Congress. But
 the history of the imperial Presidency
 indicates an assumption of power short
 of war can be the same as war.
 Mr. FINDLEY. That is right.
 Mr. BAUMAN. What I am pointing to
 is that here lies the possibility of a Presi-
 dent in the future, even this President,
 if he should so desire, to escalate appre-
 ciably the military situation as pertains
 to Taiwan.
 Mr. FINDLEY. Would the gentleman
 read that sentence in a way that should
 be construed as authorizing military ac-
 tion by an adventuresome President in
 the future.
 Mr. BAUMAN. It is not up to the gen-
 tleman from Maryland to judge what
 might be an adventuresome President in
 the future. Some think we have had too
 many of them in the past.
 Mr. FINDLEY. Of course, it is a pos-
 sibility. But would the gentleman con-
 strue it as giving the President that
 power?
 Mr. BAUMAN. I think the potential
 proves exists, in the very broad drafts-
 manship in this legislation. But the world
 will little note, nor long remember what
 we say here.
 Mr. FINDLEY. The Gulf of Tonkin
 resolution, which many of us-in fact, all
 of us then in the House-very unwisely
 supported in 1964 was often cited by
 President Johnson as legitimative au
 thority to carry on a very wide-scale mili-
 tary operation in Vietnam. I think the
 gentleman from Maryland was here in
 another capacity at that time, and hg,
 certainly has been an observer of the
 American scene. I wonder if he would
 interpret this language as having within
 it the same mischief as was contained in
 the Gulf of Tonkin resolution?
 . Mr. BAUIVLAN. It is in the nature of a
 blank check for any President, including
 the incumbent or any future President,
 to do as he pleases so far as using this .
 entity, so far as transferring arms or
 any military equipment, and that could
 be an act short of war, but certainly one
 that could have a great deal of con-
 sequences.
 The CHAIRMAN. Are there further
 amendments to title II?
 AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. SOLOMON
 Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Chairman, I offer
 an amendment.
 The Clerk read as follows:

 I would also like t call the attention of
 some of my colleagues from New York,
 particularly those from New York City,
 who  have  been voting  consistently
 against many of the amendments that
 so many of us are concerned about, that
 these Members, particularly those whose
 names might appear on this bill before
 us, that I detect a certain amount of re-
 sentment among my colleagues from
 around the country because of some of
 these votes.

 I would like to point out to them and
 to myself that may have constituencies
 -.that may be interestec: in Israel, that in
 the not too distant future we may be
 faced with legislation that is going to be
 very similar to what we have here.
 . Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. SOLOMON. I yield to my colleague
 from New York.
 Mr. WOLFF. Does the gentleman
 equate Israel and Taiwan? Is that what
 he is saying?
 Mr. SOLOMON. As far as our future
 policy is concerned; yes, sir.
 Mr. WOLF. In other words, the gen-
 tleman now equates all the votes that
 we are taking with vote that subse-
 quently we will take on Israel? Is that
 right?                              `
 Mr. SOLOMON. No, I say to my col-
 league from New York, I simply call this
 to your attention because I am very much
 concerned about It.
 Mr. WOLFF. We thank the gentleman
 very much, If the gentleman will yield
 further, for calling our attention to it.
 Mr. SOLOMON. I thank the gentle-
 man.
 Mr. Chairman, the reason I rise is to
 offer this amendment which does estab-
 lish consular relations with Taiwan sim-
 ilar to those consular relations that we
 now have with other countries which we
 do not recognize diplomatically. The ba-
 sic question throughout the debate over
 the legislation dealing with Taiwan has
 focused on what kind of relations we
 should continue to have that deal with
 both historical and political realities.
 The contention is made that we cannot
 have diplomatic relations with Taiwan
 because this would interfere with nor-
 malization of relations with the PRC.
 Another argument raised against this
 proposal  was  that  liaison  relations
 meant, nonetheless, a two-China policy.
 Thus, a proposal to have liaison rela-
 tions-which is a form of diplomatic re-
 lations-was narrowly voted down in the
 House last Thursday. Those were some of
 the votes I referred to.
 Having said all that, it is also true
 that if there are no established relations
 with the people on Taiwan, there is a
 failure to recognize the reality of Tai-
 wan's existence as a political entity with
 "international personality", as that term
 is used by Victor Li in his testimony be-
 fore the Senate committee. I have a copy
 of that testimony which I would like to
 insert at this point in the RECORD.
 PREPARED STATEMENT OF PROFESSOR VICTOR Li
 I am delighted that normalization of rela-
 tions with the People's Republic of China has
 finally taken place. But normalization still
 leaves many political and legal problems to
 be resolved, including the status of Taiwan.
 After January 1, 1979, we know what Tai-
 wan is note it is not the de jure government
 of the state of China. Much less clear, how-
 ever, is the question of what Taiwan is.
 We also know that U.S.-Republic of China
 (ROC) treaties do not automatically lapse
 upon withdrawal of recognition. The Mutual
 Defense Treaty continues In effect for one
 more year. In a December 30, 1978 memoran-
 dum for all departments and agencies, Presi-
 dent Carter declared:
 Existing international agreements and ar-
 rangements in force between the united
 States and Taiwan shall continue in force
 and shall be performed and enforced by de-
 partments and their agencies beginning Jan-
 uary 1, 1979, in accordance with their terms?
 But the United States has not explained the
 legal rationale for preserving treaties and
 maintaining commercial, cultural, and other
 relations with an unrecognized entity.
 1. TWO POSSIBLE CHOICES
 1. Successor Government
 One possible rationale is that the United
 States has treaty and other relations with the
 state of China. Prior to January 1, that state
 was represented by the ROC government.
 After the switch of recognition, the United
 States regards the People's Republic of China
 (PRC) as the successor government to the
 ROC. As such, the PRC assumes the rights
 and obligations of its predecessor.
 The successor government theory is well
 known. For example, in 1971, the PRO was
 recognized by the United Nations as the only
 legitimate representative of China, and took
 over the seat belonging to that state.   .
 Applying the above theory to the present
 situation, the PRC has succeeded to the Mu-
 tual Defense Treaty and other agreements
 with the United States. These treaties re-
 main in force because the PRO has agreed, in
 an implied manner, that they should con=
 tinue to serve as the bases of American rela-
 tions with the Chinese territory of Taiwan.
 In addition, since the PRC is the govern-
 ment of all of China including Taiwan, the
 United States can have no direct relations
 with the authorities on Taiwan, unless the
 PRC consents. Taiwan would have no capac-
 ity to conduct foreign affairs, except insofar
 as the PRC consents, even if only in an
 implied manner.
 2. De facto entity with international
 personality
 A second possible description of the legal
 status of Taiwan after withdrawal of recog-
 nition is that it is a "de facto entity with in-
 ternational personality." That is, while no
 longer regarded by the United States as a de
 jure government or state, nevertheless Tai-
 wan continues to control a population and
 territory and to carry out the usual func-
 tions of government. Sec. 4 of the Restate-
 ment, Second, Foreign Relations Law of the
 United States (hereafter Restatement) pro-
 vides:
 Except as otherwise indicated, "state" as
 used in the Restatement of this Subject
 means an entity that has a defined territory
 and population under the control of a gov-
 ernment and that engages in foreign rela-
 tions.
 Similarly, the Convention on Rights and
 Duties of States, 49 Stat. 3097, T.S. 881 (1933)
 says:
 Art. 1. The state as a person of interna-
 tional  law  should  possess  the  following
 qualifications: (a) a permanent population;
 (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and
 (d) capacity to enter into relations with the
 other states.
 In other words, whether Taiwan is re-
 garded as a "state" or juridical person in
 international law depends on whether it car-
 ries out the usual functions of a state, and
 not whether it is recognized de lure by other
 states.
 If Taiwan is a de facto entity with inter-
 national personality, it may carry out the
 full range of foreign relations, including
 entering into international agreements and
 sending and receiving of official missions.
 With respect to pre-existing treaties and
 agreements, international law does not re-
 quire that traties entered into with a once
 recognized government, the terms of which
 are limited to the territory actually con-
 trolled by that government, must lapse after
 that government loses de lure recognition
 while still exerting de facto control.0 In such
 an  unprecedented  situation,  the  United
 States could make a political decision to
 maintain these treaties on the ground that it
 may continue to deal with the authorities
 in actual control of Taiwan.
 II. THE UNITED STATES POSITION
 The PRC obviously views the switch of
 recognition as a successor government situa-
 tion. The position of the United States is not
 clear. In the Joint Communique of Decem-
 ber 15, 1978, the United States "acknowl-
 edges the Chinese position that there is but
 one China and Taiwan is part of China," and
 ''recognizes the People's Republic of China
 as the sole legal Government of China. With-
 in this context, the people of the United
 States will maintain cultural, commercial,
 and other unofficial relations with the people
 of Taiwan."
 One possible interpretation of these state-
 ments is that the PRC is the successor gov-
 ernment to the ROC: there is one state of
 China which includes Taiwan, and the PRC
 is the sole legal government of this state.
 Moreover, since the United States can deal
 with Taiwan only "within this context," the
 United States acknowledges the PRO's ulti-
 mate legal authority over Taiwan, including
 the right to approve future U.S.-Taiwan
 relations.
 A second interpretation is that acknowl-
 edgement of the Chinese position is not
 tantamount to agreeing with it.  Thus the
 status of Taiwan remains "undetermined."
 Moreover, the United States also has said
 that:
 Whenever any law, regulation, or order of
 the United States refers to a foreign coun-
 try, nation, state, government, or similar
 entity, departments and agencies shall con-
 strue those terms and apply those laws.
 regulations, or orders to include Taiwan.'
 This statement might be read as an indi-
 cation that Taiwan is a de facto entity hav-
 ing the attributes of a state or government.
 In selecting between the successor govern-
 ment theory and the de facto entity theory.
 I believe that the former is not workable and
 does not serve American Interests. First, the
 need to obtain the PRC's consent, even if
 only implied, for continued dealings with
 Taiwan constantly places the United States
 on the defensive. Serious difficulties would
 arise if, at a later time, the PRC objects to
 some aspect of U.S.-Taiwan relations.
 Secondly, the successor government theory
 lends to problems in areas other than treaties
 or official relations. For example, the ROC
 has deposited in American banks over 84
 billion of its foreign exchange reserves. If
 the PRC is the successor government,  it
 could assert that this money belongs to the
 "state of China" and should be handed over
 to the proper representative of that state,
 the PRC. The transfer of such a vast sum
 would undercut any policy to ensure that the
 people of Taiwan "face a peaceful and pros-
 perous future."
 Finally, one of the reasons for moving
 ahead with normalization is to bring Ameri-
 can policy into accord with reality, a laud-
 able goal. Structuring our dealings with Tai-
 wan as though it were a subordinate unit of
 the PRC would be a departure from reality.
 I believe that the United States should

 H 1270
 W1Nk7RhbbJLU1NAL KLWK0-11uu5J            March 13, 1979
 make clear that it regards Taiwan as a de
 facto entity with international personality.
 Such a stand accurately reflects reality: de-
 recognition has not affected the manner in
 which the authorities and 17 million inhabi-
 tants of Taiwan conduct their affairs. The
 United States simply is acknowledging the
 fact that Taiwan continues to manage its
 affairs in an autonomous manner.
 I should note that the above suggestion
 does not violate the principle of one China.
 The de facto entity concept deals with pres-
 ent  political  realities,  and  Vice-Premier
 Teng's recent indication that Taiwan may re-
 tain its own political and economic systems
 as well as maintain separate armed forces
 acknowledges the same realities.
 The United States may derive some short
 term benefits from refusing to clarify the
 legal rationale for continued dealings with
 Taiwan. After all, explicitly calling it a de
 facto entity would aggravate the PRC, while
 adopting the successor government theory
 would damage Taiwan. This policy of inten-
 tional ambiguity may be difficult to maintain
 for an indeterminate time. In the years to
 come I suspect that we will see many situa-
 tions where the PRC would attempt to assert
 its position as the successor. Each instance
 would set a precedent for future dealings.
 One of the first possible cases is likely to
 involve the ownership of the former ROC
 embassy at Twin Oaks. The PRC may con-
 sider the obtaining of the state of China's
 diplomatic property an important political
 and symbolic act. If the Executive or the
 courts transfer the property to the PRC as
 the successor government, then other ROC
 assets, such as the several billion dollars in
 bank denosits may also be jeopardized. Allow-
 ing the PRO to succeed only to property ac-
 quired before 1949 removes many of the diffi-
 culties, but still leaves unresolved problems
 such as the $550 million contribution made to
 the International Monetary Fund by the ROC
 In 1947.
 III. ATTRIBUTION OF A DE FACTO ENTITY WITH
 INTERNATIONAL PERSONALITY
 This section discusses the capabilities and
 disabilities of a de facto entity, comparing
 them with the attributes of a de lure recog-
 nized state. It should be pointed out at the
 outset that the de facto entity concept is
 not new or unfamiliar. Prior to January 1,
 1979, the United States dealt with the PRC
 on exactly such a basis. Although we did not
 extend de lure recognition, official missions
 were exchanged, agreements were reached,
 American presidents visited the PRC, and a
 considerable amount of trade and travel was
 carried out. No one seriously questioned the
 capacity of the PRC to engage in such rela-
 tions.
 1. International law perspective
 A de facto entity has the capacity to have
 treaty and other foreign relations, even with
 countries not extending it de lure recogni-
 tion. Sec. 107 of the Restatement provides:
 An entity not recognized as a state but
 meeting the requirements for recognition [of
 controlling a territory and population and
 engaging in foreign affairs], or an entity
 recognized as a state whose regime is not rec-
 ognized as its government, has the rights
 of a state under international law in rela-
 tions to a non-recognizing .state, although it
 can be precluded from exercising such a right
 if:
 (a) The right is of such a nature that it
 can only be exercised by the government of
 a state, and
 (b) The non-recognizing state refuses to
 treat the purported exercise of the right as
 action taken by the government of the other
 state.
 In recent years, the United States has en-
 tered into agreements regarding a wide vari-
 ety of subjects with de facto entities such
 as the Democratic People's Republic of Viet-
 nam, the German Democratic Republic, and
 the PRC.
 The American decision to conduct future
 relations with Taiwan through a quasi-gov-
 ernmental corporation rather than through
 formal official channels does not affect the
 status of Taiwan in international law. This
 decision reflects political factors in U.S:
 PRC-Taiwan relations, and is not the result
 of some inherent disability of de facto en-
 tities.
 2. Existing legislation
 There are very few provisions in American
 legislation which provide that de lure and
 de facto entities should be treated different-
 ly.T In general, the legislative approach has
 been to treat them similarly, unless there
 is a specific provison to the contrary. Some
 semantic confusion exists, since terms such
 as "foreign country" or "foreign government"
 are often used in an undefined and even
 inconsistent manner. President Carter's mem-
 orandum of December 30, cited earlier, and
 the proposed legislation resolve this confu-
 sion by making all such terms applicable to
 Taiwan.
 The proposed legislation resolves most the
 legal problems which may arise after with-
 drawal of recognition. However, two potential
 difficulties remain.  A number of statutes
 place various restrictions on dealings with
 "Communist countries."
 For example, the Export-Import Bank may
 not take part in transactions involving sales
 to or products from "a Communist country,"
 unless the President determines that the
 transaction is in the national interest. The
 Foreign Assistance Act bars assistance to
 countries that are "dominated or controlled
 by the international Communist movement,"
 as well as to "any Communist country" un-
 less the President finds that such assistance
 is "vital to the security of the United
 States." 9 Similarly, Communist countries are
 not eligible for purchase of surplus agricul-
 tural products on credit or for foreign cur-
 rencies,'0 cannot be designated a beneficiary
 developing country for purposes of the gen-
 eralized  system  of  preference,u  and  are
 charged a higher tariff rater
 As discussed earlier, the December 15 Com-
 munique states that the United States "ac-
 knowledges the Chinese position that there
 Is but one China and Taiwan is part of
 China." This sentence might be read to mean
 that Taiwan is part of a Communist country,
 the PRC. Such an interpretation appears to
 be contrary to the President's position, but
 neither earlier official statements nor the
 proposed legislation directly addresses this
 problem.
 In addition, other statutory programs are
 applicable only to "friendly countries." These
 include military sales and assistance= the
 Overseas Private Investment Corporation,14
 sale of American agricultural surplus on
 credit terms or for foreign currency by the
 Commodity Credit Corporation,zs loans to
 small farmers of predominantely rural coun-
 tries,16 and expenditures of funds received
 pursuant to the Agricultural Trade Develop-
 ment and Assistance Act of 195417 Interest-
 ingly, nowhere in these statutes is the term
 "friendly" defined.
 The proposed legislation does not explicitly
 affirm Taiwan's "friendly" status, although
 testimony by Administration officials makes
 clear that the intention of the legislation is
 to leave unchanged Taiwan's eligibility for
 the above mentioned programs.
 3. Judicially developed rules
 Even without  the proposed legislation,
 judicially developed rules impose few serious
 disabilities on de facto entities. They are
 entitled to claim sovereign immunity to the
 same extent as de lure recognized states. In
 Wolfson v. Russian Socialist Federated So-
 viet Republic, 23 N.Y. 372, 138 N.E. 24 (1923)
 the R.S.F.S.R. was "an existing government
 sovereign within its own territory," but un-
 recognized by the United States. Immunity
 was granted on the ground that a foreign
 sovereign, even if unrecognized, cannot be
 sued in an American court without his con-
 sent. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act
 of 1976, 90 Stat 2891, makes no explicit
 mention of unrecognized entities, but in-
 stead refers generally to "foreign states". The
 absence of a specific provision implies that
 pre-existing rules established by case law
 remain valid. Moreover, President Carter's
 directive of December 30 and the proposed
 legislation  directing  that  laws  regarding
 "foreign states" should apply to Taiwan also
 would support the granting of Immunity.
 The act of state doctrine provides:
 Every sovereign state is bound to respect
 the independence of every other sovereign
 state, and the courts of one country will
 not sit in judgment on the acts of the gov-,,
 ernment of another, done within its own ter-
 ritory. Underhill v. Hernandez, 168 U.S. 250,
 18 S. Ct. 83 (1897).
 In Salminoff & Co. v. Standard Oil Co. of
 New York, 262 N.Y. 220 186 N.E. 679 (1933)
 (refusal to examine the validity of a law
 confiscating property located in the Soviet
 Union), the court applied this doctrine to
 acts of the Soviet government, which was
 unrecognized but in actual control.
 The  "constitutional  underpinning"  for
 the act of state doctrine is the separation of
 powers. The Judiciary is reluctant to inter-
 fere with the conduct of foreign affairs by
 the Executive. Banco National de Cuba v.
 Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398, 84 S. Ct. 923 (1964).
 Applying this rationale to the politically deli-
 cate situation in United States-PRC-Taiwan
 relations, courts should be especially wary of
 making pronouncements about the validity
 or invalidity of Taiwanese governmental ac-
 tions. The act of state doctrine should be
 applied, leaving such determinations to the
 Executive.
 The only disability Imposed by the courts
 on de facto entities is that they may not
 have standing to bring suit in an American
 court. In Russian Socialist Federated Soviet
 Republic v. Cibrario, 25 N.Y. 255, 139 N.E.
 259 (1923), the court held that allowing an
 unrecognized government to sue would un-
 dermine the Executive decision not to ex-
 tend de lure recognition.
 Yet even this position has eroded sub-
 stantially over time. A Soviet-owned cor-
 poration organized under the laws of New
 York was allowed to bring suit. Amtorg Trad-
 ing Corp. v. United States, 71 F. 2d 324 (1934).
 In Upright v. Mercury Business Machines, 13
 A.D. 2d 36, 213 N.Y.S. 2d 417 (1961)  an
 American assignee of a corporation controlled
 by the unrecognized German Democratic Re-
 public also was permitted to sue.
 More recently, in Federal Republic of Ger-
 many v. Elicofon, 358 F. Supp. 747 (E.D.N.Y.)
 (1972), aff'd, 478 F. 2d 231, 415 U.S. 1931
 (1974), reh denied, 416 U.S. 952 (1974), the
 court did not allow the Weimer Art Collec-
 tion, an East German museum which was an
 arm of the East German government,  to
 bring suit. However, the court added In a
 footnote:
 It Is unclear whether this reasoning sup-
 ports a rule invariably denying standing to
 unrecognized governments. There may be
 special circumstances In which action by the
 President can be interpreted as creating an
 exception to the rule. For example, it may
 be argued that the act of the Executive In
 permitting American nationals to engage in
 commercial relations with unrecognized gov-
 ernments or their instrumentalities carries
 with it a grant to those governments or in-
 strumentalities of standing to litigate claims
 arising out of those transactions in United
 States courts.
 The same reasoning could be applied to

 March 13, 1979           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE                      111271
 the Taiwan situation where the United States
 is allowing, and indeed encouraging, con-
 tinued economic, cultural, and other rela-
 tions.
 The Upright case actually deals with both
 the act of state doctrine and the question
 of standing to sue. The starting point for
 the court is that a "foreign government, al-
 though not recognized by the political arm
 of the United States government, may never-
 theless have de facto existence which is jur-
 ldicially cognizable." The court looked to
 "the realities of life" and noted that an un-
 recognized government carriers on many rou-
 tine activities and that trade between the
 two countries is not forbidden. The legal
 consequences of non-recognition should be
 narrowly construed, unless they "can be
 properly related as inflnical to the aims and
 purposes of our public and national policy."
 Assuring the continued prosperity of Taiwan
 appears to be part of the American national
 policy. This policy would be hindered by
 denying Taiwan the standing to bring suit
 in American courts.
 Thus, judicial doctrine may be evolving to
 a position where unrecognized entities have
 standing to sue, at least in cases involving
 economic and cultural relations. Be that as
 It may, the proposed legislation removes
 whatever. legal disabilities may exist be-
 cause of a' lack of recognition.
 In summary, pre-existing legislation does
 not make major distinctions between de jure
 and de facto entities. Judicial practice also
 imposes few, if any, additional disabilities.
 The proposed legislation would remove the
 remaining obstacles to continuing all eco-
 nomic and cultural relations with Taiwan.
 However, the inclusion of an affirmation of
 Taiwan's "friendly" status, and a reference
 to the fact that Taiwan is not part of a
 Communist country would add to clarity.
 It should be noted that the act of extend-
 ing de lure recognition to the PRC, in and
 of itself, grants the PRC few rights and
 privileges. At this point, we should at least
 ask why we continue to use the concept of
 recognition, If the extending or withdraw-
 ing of recognition indeed produces few or
 no legal consequences of importance. Could
 it be that this concept, which has so shaped
 the United States-China relations debate, has
 only symbolic content? If so, perhaps we
 should consider whether it would be simpler
 and better for countries to merely "deal"
 with each other, without being tied to the
 ritual of recognition.
 IV. A PERSPECTIVE ON TAIWAN
 The formulation "de facto entity with in-
 ternational personality" is awkward, both
 semantically and substantively. But since
 both the PRC and Taiwan agree on the prin-
 ciple of one China, it is hardly appropriate
 for the United States, as an outsider, to
 propose any other question. Having to oper-
 ate within this principle, the United States
 must use the de facto entity concept if it is
 --to maintain economic, cultural, and other
 ties with Taiwan into the indefinite future.
 While we may hope that Taiwan will adopt
 a more flexible stance in due course, the
 central authorities there must resolve some
 fundamental  difficulties before  any major
 policy shifts can occur. Despite the slogans
 and political speeches, I believe that few re-
 sponsible people on Taiwan think that they
 will recover the Mainland from the Com-
 munists, or that they rule anything more
 than the territory of Taiwan. At the same
 time, over 1,500 persons in the National As-
 sembly and Legislative Yuan hold office by
 virtue of elections held on the Mainland in
 1947. If Taiwan forsakes its claim to the
 government of all of China, then the legal
 basis for these 1,500 persons as well as others
 retaining their positions also would vanish.
 Moreover, considerable political debate must
 take place. some of which may be acrimoni-
 ous, to decide the form and personnel of the
 new government.   -
 In making a national decision about the
 future of Taiwan, the views of all of the
 people of Taiwan should be considered. In
 recent years, the electoral process was begin-
 ning to bring new people representing a
 broad range of views into the political sys-
 tem. Although Taiwan is essentially a single
 party state, "non-party" (i.e., opposition)
 candidates won 38% of the popular vote in
 the 1977 election for local offices. In the 1978
 national elections, since only 38 seats (out
 of 400) in the Legislative Yuan and 56 seats
 (out of about 1,200)  in the National As-
 sembly were up for election, the makeup of
 these bodies would hardly change even if
 opposition candidates won a sizeable num-
 ber of contests. Nevertheless, the elections
 provided the public an opportunity to ex-
 press                                                                  its  views.  More  importantly,  the
 winners, who would likely have included a
 number of opposition leaders, would have
 obtained legitimate standing to participate
 in the national debate about the future of
 Taiwan.
 The  normalization  announcement  was
 made in the middle of the Taiwan elections,
 and led to their indefinite suspension. Op-
 position candidates cannot use their cam-
 paign speeches and literature as means of
 voicing their opinions. Censorship and re=
 strictions  on  political  activity  limit  the
 means by which other persons may express
 dissenting views. Decision making falls back
 into the exclusive hands of the Nationalist
 party. I am concerned that the lack of a
 legitimate and adequate forum for national
 debate may lead to internal problems on
 Taiwan.
 Finally, I want to make some comments
 about American normal obligations to Tai-
 wan. Over twenty-five years ago, in a world
 that was very different, the United States
 provided massive military and other as-
 sistance to Taiwan when such assistance was
 sorely needed. In subsequent  years,  the
 United States contributed greatly to the
 remarkable growth of that island.
 At some point, the original American com-
 mitments to Taiwan for military protection
 and economic assistance would have been
 fulfilled. Taiwan is not the 51st state which
 must be defended and assisted under any
 circumstances and for all time. In the course
 of helping to build a new society on Taiwan,
 however, I believe the United States has in-
 curred new obligations to give that society
 an opportunity to survive and grow.
 Taiwan is going through a transition from
 being the Republic of China representing all
 of China to some new and still undefined
 status. What that new status should be must
 be decided by the people on Taiwan. They
 must consider the offers being tendered by
 the PRC. If they feel the offers to be unsatis-
 factory,  they  must  seek  better  terms  or
 search for new solutions.
 I believe the responsibility of the United
 States is to give the people on Taiwan a fair
 opportunity to make decisions about its own
 future. The use of the de facto entity ap-
 proach which I have urged provides the
 smoothest means of making a transition. It
 is time for Taiwan to take its own problems
 in hand. If it wishes to continue the fiction
 of being all of China, then it has had ample
 notice that it must stand alone and face
 the consequences. If it wishes to reunify
 with the PRC or adopt some other status,
 then it must begin the process.
 Thank you very much.

 3 There is a potentially serious linguistic
 discrepancy between the English and Chinese
 texts. The Chinese text uses ch'eng-jen for
 "acknowledges." In this context, the Chinese
 term carries a strong connotation of accept-
 ance or agreement. Moreover, the Shanghai
 Communique states:  "The United States
 acknowledges that Chinese on both sides of
 the Strait agree that there is but one China
 and Taiwan is part of China. We do not chal-
 lenge this position." The Chinese text uses a
 correct equivalent,  jen-shih, for  acknowl-
 edges. Reading the Chinese texts of the' two
 communiques together, the United States
 has increased the degree of its acquiescence
 in the Chinese position from Yen-shih (ac-
 knowledges  to  takes  note)  to ch'eng-jen
 (recognizes or accepts).

 In order to accommodate both the
 problems of the so-called two-China
 dilemma and the reality of Taiwan, we
 should set up consulate offices with Tai-
 wan, and we should do it in this legis-
 lation. This would mean contact with
 Taiwan without at the same time taking
 any position on the basic question of the
 international legal status of Taiwan.
 Nor would it constitute diplomatic rec-
 ognition of Taiwan by the United States,
 which is what the President seems to
 want.
 We currently have consulate rela-
 tions-and I wish the Members would
 listen to this, because I think this is the

 most important part of the entire argu-
 ment on this amendment-we currently
 have consulate relations, not diplomatic
 relations, with, other international po-
 litical entities, as is Taiwan, such as
 Estonia,  Monaco,  Lithuania,  Latvia,
 many of which are beyond the Iron Cur-
 tain, and in many of which we do have
 consulate offices even though we recog-
 nize Russia and not these countries dip-
 lomatically. We also have the same kind
 of arrangement with Jerusalem, of all
 places.
 With other countries we have diplo-
 matic relations with embassies in the
 capital city and consulate offices in other
 cities. We have the gentleman from
 Minnesota (Mr. ERDAHL), who is former
 Secretary of State of Minnesota, which
 has consulate offices from foreign coun-
 tries in his State; yet, that foreign coun-
 try does not recognize the State of
 Minnesota as a national sovereignty.
 In the situation of China, we can
 easily have an embassy in Peking that
 represents formal diplomatic relations
 in China, and our consulate in Taiwan
 as well.

 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman from New York (Mr. SOLOMON)
 has expired.
 (By unanimous consent, Mr. SOLOMON
 was allowed to proceed for 2 additional
 minutes.)
 Mr. SOLOMON. To continue, Mr.
 Chairman, such an arrangement is per-
 fectly logical because both Taipei and
 Peking insist that there is a province of
 China, both countries do. The reality is
 that the Government of Taipei controls
 and governs that particular part of
 China. Thus, without prejudicing any
 further the position of the PRC or of
 Taiwan, we will continue to have a pres-
 ence with the people of Taiwan, under
 this amendment, through the establish-
 ment of a consulate office in Taipei as
 the mode of continued contact. By this
 action we make it clear that we are sim-
 ply dealing in the reality of who runs
 Taiwan.
 Mr. Chairman, I ask, Who does run
 Taiwan? A consular relationship with
 Taiwan will not jeopardize a peaceful
 settlement of the Taiwan-PRC dispute,
 and it will not interfere with the normal-
 ization of relations between the United
 States and the PRC.
 A consulate does not mean formal dip-
 lomatic relations with a country, accord-
 ing to the Geneva Convention revisions
 which this country and this body have
 recognized.
 I would like to quote from "Law Among
 Nations"-and perhaps some of the older
 Members have read-it-but I would ask
 all Members to read it. I have a copy of it
 here. It is very interesting. It says the
 following:
 . a severance of diplomatic relations
 does not, ipso facto, mean a breaking off of
 consular relations. It is also possible to estab-
 lish consular relations between states that
 do not have diplomatic relations with one
 another. In this sitaution, the consular rela-
 tions represent the only official relations of
 permanent character between the states in
 question.
 Thus, just because we have begun dip-
 lomatic relations with Taiwan does not
 mean that we cannot have consular rela-
 tions. By all standards, consular rela-
 tions are lower relations than a formal
 status. Actually, there is just mean con-
 tact between the two international politi-
 cal entities.
 In this case, Mr. Chairman, we can
 make it clear that the unusual situation
 with China makes creation of these kinds
 of relations absolutely necessary.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman from New York (Mr. SOLOMON)
 has again expired.
 (By unanimous consent, Mr. SOLOMON
 was allowed to proceed for 1 additional
 minute.)
 To continue, Mr. Chairman, we must
 deal with Taiwan because it does exist.
 It is a reality at present around the
 world.
 Many of our State governments have
 what can be termed consulate offices in
 foreign countries, and that does not
 mean a compromise of the relations be-
 tween Washington and that foreign
 capital or that the foreign government
 recognizes the State's government as a
 separate foreign nation, as I referred to
 when I mentioned the gentleman from
 Minnesota, (Mr. ERDARL).
 If anything, it reinforces the notion-
 and I think the Members should listen
 to this-that both Peking and Taipei
 have what they want, that Taiwan is a
 part of China and that this is the only
 way in which we can have contact with
 the people of the province of China. Any
 other method of dealing with the prob-
 lem short of diplomatic recognition
 evades the basic reality and cannot work,
 in the long run.
 Mr. Chairman, the bill says over and
 over again that Taiwan exists and that
 we must recognize that reality by having
 contact with the authorities in Taipei.
 In substance, Mr.  Chairman,  this
 amendment simply establishes a consu-
 late office in Taiwan identical to those
 which exist in other foreign countries
 with which we do not have diplomatic
 relations today, again, such as Latvia,
 Lithuania, Estonia, Monaco, San Marino,
 and even Jerusalem.
 In allowing the President of the United
 States to establish to whatever degree,
 greater or lesser, as he may choose, a
 consulate office, he does have a respon-
 sibility to establish just what authority
 that consulate would have.
 Therefore, Mr. Chairman, we should
 adopt this amendment today.
 ^ 1520
 It would uncloud all of the problems
 that the gentleman and I and everyone
 else have as far as international law and
 the Vienna Convention-all the problems
 that we have.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman has expired.
 (At the request of Mr. SKELTON, and by
 unanimous consent, Mr. SOLOMON was al-
 lowed to proceed for 2 additional min-
 utes.)
 Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. SOLOMON. I yield to the gen-
 tleman from Missouri.
 Mr. SKELTON. I thank the gentleman
 for yielding.
 As I understand it, the gentleman
 wants to establish a consulate office, is
 that not correct, in Taiwan?
 Mr. SOLOMON. That  is absolutely
 correct. That is what the amendment
 says.
 Mr. SKELTON. And the consulate of-
 flee is, of course, under the Department
 of State; is that not correct?
 Mr. SOLOMON. Either fortunately or
 unfortunately, yes.
 Mr. SKELTON. The answer is, yes, is
 that right?
 Mr. SOLOMON. I believe it is, yes.
 Mr. SKELTON. And the Department of
 State is part of the executive branch; Is
 that correct?
 Mr. SOLOMON. Yes, it is.
 Mr. SKELTON. And the executive
 branch is controlled by the President of
 the United States; is that right?
 Mr. SOLOMON. Yes.
 Mr. SKELTON. As the gentleman
 knows, according to the Constitution the
 President has two exclusive powers that
 no one, especially Congress, may invade.
 One is the right of pardon, and the other
 is the power to receive ambassadors,
 which includes the right of recognition
 and derecognition. Does the gentleman
 understand that? If we were to pass this
 amendment and subsequently ? pass this
 bill, does the gentleman not agree it
 would be invading the prerogative of the
 President and the sole and exclusive
 rights afforded to him by the Constitu-
 tion?
 Mr. SOLOMON. I do not agree with
 that because this is not a body that comes
 under diplomatic relations. We do not
 have diplomatic relations with Estonia
 right now.
 Mr. SKELTON. If the gentleman will
 excuse me, I thought the gentleman said
 this was done by the Department of
 State.
 Mr. SOLOMON. It Is.
 Mr. SKELTON. Is the gentleman say-
 ing that the Department of State does
 not deal in foreign relations? It does not
 act under the President? Does not ex-
 tending ourselves into another country
 by establishing a consulate there consti-
 tute an extension of the executive branch
 into a foreign country, whether we do it
 by liaison office or by consulate or any
 other  way? That is the truth of the
 matter. The gentleman is invading the'
 prerogative of the President.
 I would have done it differently, but I
 am not the President. We are not the
 President, but we have to go by what is in
 the Constitution; do we not?
 Mr. SOLOMON. Let me answer the
 gentleman's question. It seems to me the
 gentleman voted for Public Law 95-393
 on September 3, 1978, which gave the au- '
 thority to extend most favorable or less
 favorable treatment to foreign countries.
 That is exactly what we are doing here.
 We put the power in the hands of the
 President.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman has expired.
 (At the request of Mr. LAGOMARSINO,
 and by unanimous consent, Mr. SOLOMON
 was allowed to proceed for 2 additional
 minutes.)
 Mr. SOLOMON. As I read that favored
 nation treatment that the gentleman
 from Missouri voted for, it seems to me
 that we had invaded at that time both

 the Department of State and the Presi-
 dency. That is exactly what I am say-
 ing here. I will read to the gentleman
 from the Vienna Convention revising the
 authority of a consulate, and it talks
 about nine items here which I will be glad
 to give to the gentleman. It talks about
 protecting in the receiving state the
 interests of exports and imports. It talks
 about promoting trade, which is what we
 are interested in in this country. It talks
 about issuing passports, which we are
 interested in in this country; about act-
 ing as notary and civil registrar, and
 representing nationals of the sending
 state in cases of succession in the terri-
 tory of the receiving state. It talks about
 representing nationals of the sending
 state before the courts; serving judicial
 documents or executing commissions;
 And exercising rights of supervision and
 inspection, et cetera, et cetera.
 It lets the President to a greater or
 lesser degree decide what he wants to do.
 I think the President would accept this.
 I recall the honorable majority leader
 on this floor saying that the free Chinese
 government on Taiwan had agreed to
 this legislation because, and I quote the
 majority leader, "We are blackmailing
 them into accepting this bill." I call
 assure you that the President would
 accept this because it gives him the
 power, but it does away with the laun-
 dering of money which the gentleman
 from Maryland, (Mr. BAUMAN) or who-
 ever it was a few minutes ago who was
 talking about it said, whether govern-
 ment employees are legal or illegal. It
 does solve all those problems. It does
 exactly what we want. We ought to adopt
 this amendment and end this debate
 and pass the bill.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the
 gentleman has expired.
 Mr. BINGHAM. Mr. Chairman, I move
 to strike the requisite number of words,
 and I rise in opposition to the amend-
 ment.
 (Mr.  BINGHAM  asked  and  was
 given permission to revise and extend
 his remarks.)
 Mr. BINGHAM. Mr. Chairman, this is
 just another effort to upset the arrange-
 ment that has been so carefully worked
 out by making the relationships be-
 tween the United States and Taiwan
 official relationships.
 We have now had two votes in which
 the  Members  resoundingly  defeated
 other such efforts. This is a similar
 effort.
 I asked for the floor because I wanted
 to discuss the examples that the gentle-
 man from New York mentioned where
 there  have been  consulates  without
 diplomatic relations. I was interested in
 his statement that there were such
 cases, and then I listened carefully to
 his examples. The examples were first,
 Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. Ob-
 viously, the consulates that we retain in
 those areas are there with the consent of
 the Soviet Govgrnment. Does the gentle-
 man think for one moment that we could
 maintain consulates in those areas if we
 did not have the consent of the govern-
 ment in Moscow?
 ^ 1525
 Mr. SOLOMON. Will the gentleman
 from New York yield?
 Mr. BINGHAM. I yield to the gentle-
 man from New York.
 Mr. SOLOMON. The gentleman asked
 if I thought for a moment if we had a
 strong President; sir, yes, they would
 yield.
 Mr. BINGHAM. Mr. Chairman, if the
 gentleman wanted to add to his amend-
 ment that the consulate would be estab-
 lished when and if the government in
 Peking agreed to it, that would be one
 thing, but that is certainly not the case
 now.
 Two other examples he mentioned
 were Monaco and San Marino. Obvious-
 ly the reason is those are such small
 territories they do not want to have the
 expense of maintaining embassies or ex-
 changing full relations with the United
 States. The situation is clearly not
 comparable.
 The final example the gentleman
 mentioned is truly an extraordinary
 one. He mentioned the consulate in
 Jerusalem. Jerusalem is clearly a part
 of the State of Israel. We maintain a
 consulate there not only with the con-
 sent of the Government of Israel, but
 because the Government of Israel is
 located in Jerusalem. Many of us feel
 that we should have moved our Embassy
 from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem long ago, but
 the fact of the matter is that the ad-
 ministration is content now merely to
 have a consulate in Jerusalem. So there
 is not even a remote parallel in that
 case.
 So the examples mentioned, I would
 submit to the members of the committee,
 are not parallels at all. There is no case
 where a consulate has been established
 without diplomatic relations except for
 these unusual circumstances.
 I would ask the gentleman, would he
 favor establishing a consulate in South
 Vietnam or in North Korea or in Cuba,
 countries with whom we have no dip-
 lomatic relations? I am sure he would
 not.
 I yield back the balance of my time.
 Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I move
 to strike the requisite number of words.
 ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE MAJORITY LEADER
 Mr. Chairman, I take this time to make
 an announcement in the nature of an
 invitation, and also to say a few words
 with respect to the amendment now
 pending.
 First the announcement and invita-
 tion:
 All Members are invited to join in
 greeting President Carter upon his ar-
 rival at Andrews Air Force Base this
 evening as a gesture of respect for his
 courage and his persistent personal en-
 deavors in seeking peace in the Middle
 East.
 The President will be arriving at ap-
 proximately 12:45 a.m. Members should
 arrive at Andrews at midnight and those
 desiring bus transportation from the
 Capitol should call the Sergeant at Arms
 office at extension 52456. Wives are in-
 vited to accompany their husbands.
 Mr. Chairman, let me say something
 now with regard to the amendment pres-
 ently before us. I think it suffers two
 deficiencies.
 First, it is unnecessary. It would ac-
 complish nothing beyond what is ac-
 complished in the bill. Secondly, it prob-
 ably would subject the bill to a veto on
 the grounds of an unwarranted invasion
 of Executive power.
 Let me point out to those who have not
 focused carefully upon the strong lan-
 guage already contained in this legisla-
 tion. First, looking to section 204 as it
 appears at page 9 of the bill, we see that
 the designated entity is fully empowered
 to perform those services normally per-
 formed by a consulate of the United
 States.
 Let me attract our attention next to
 the language,appearing on page 5 begin-
 ning on line 17. This is language which
 would be stricken from the bill by adop-
 tion of the amendment.
 The laws of the United States which apply
 with respect to agencies of the United States
 Government shall, to the extent the Presi-
 dent may specify, apply with respect to the
 designated entity as if the designated entity
 were an agency of the United States Gov-
 ernment.
 Finally on page 10 in definitions of
 -what is meant in our reference to the
 laws of the United States, we find the
 definition :
 (1) the term "laws of the United States"
 includes any statute, rule, regulation, ordi-
 nance, order, or judicial rule of decision of
 the United States or any political subdivi-
 sion thereof:
 The definition could hardly be broad-
 er.
 ^ 1530
 So what we have for all practical in-
 tents and purposes is a consulate. It
 serves every conceivable purpose a con-
 sulate could serve. We have arranged a
 unique entity in the exercise of the con-
 gressional prerogative. The bill creates
 a  continuing  relationship  with  our
 friends in Taiwan. We are empowered
 to deal with them, for every practical,
 purpose precisely as we have dealt with
 them in the past.
 Now, the language which is contained
 in this bill is strong language. It as-
 serts the emphatic desire of the United
 States to protect our friendship with
 Taiwan. It asserts that the future of
 Taiwan must be determined through
 peaceful means without prejudice to the
 well-being of the people on Taiwan.
 It declares that any armed attack
 against Taiwan or any use of force.
 boycott, or embargo to prevent Taiwan
 from engaging in trade with other na-
 tions would be a threat to the peace and
 stability of the Western Pacific area
 and of grave concern to the United
 States.
 It declares that the United States
 will make available to Taiwan defense
 articles and defense services for its de-
 fense against armed attack.
 I do not know what more the gentle-
 man wishes. Those representatives of
 the Government of Taiwan who have
 discussed the matter with me have
 declared that they desire for this bill
 to be passed, for this entity to be created,

 be served by creating a direct conflict
 which would provoke a confrontation
 with the executive branch of Govern-
 ment, invite a veto, and delay and leave
 further in limbo the important rela-
 tions which we as a people desire to
 maintain with the people of Taiwan.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman from Texas (Mr. WRIGHT)  has
 expired.
 (On request of Mr. MCDONALD, and by
 unanimous consent, Mr.  WRIGHT was
 allowed to proceed for 1 additional
 minute.)
 Mr. McDONALD. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. WRIGHT. I yield to the gentleman
 from Georgia.
 Mr. McDONALD. Mr. Chairman, the
 distinguished majority leader In his pre-
 sentation just now stated that he was re-
 ferring to the Republic of Taiwan and
 the island of Taiwan. Is it the distin-
 guished majority leader's view that in-
 deed the Government of the Republic of
 China is an independent republic or just
 simply an island area?
 Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, as the
 gentleman from Georgia fully knows, the
 Idea of a two-China policy has been re-
 jected by both the people of Taiwan and
 the people of mainland China. Many of
 us instinctively think of them as two
 separate entities, but this is satisfactory
 to neither of them. For 30 years both of
 them have rejected that concept, and' it
 goes to the roots of their heritage. Both
 those on Taiwan and those on the main-
 land prefer to contend that it is one na-
 tion, and their argument has been over
 who is entitled to run the government.
 We could bring up a similar quarrel
 with respect to what is Hong Kong. Much
 of the world maintains that it is a British
 Crown Colony. Those in Hong Kong itself
 hold to that position. The government in
 Peking maintains that it is a part of Chi-
 na. Now, that semantic disagreement as
 to just wiat it is has gone on for a long
 time. Yet it has not provoked any armed
 conflict nor disrupted the affairs, com-
 mercially or otherwise, that are con-
 ducted in Hong Kong and by Hong Kong
 with other nations of the world.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the
 gentleman from Texas (Mr.  WRIGHT)
 has again expired.
 (On request of Mr. McDoNALD, and by
 unanimous consent, Mr. WRIGHT was al-
 lowed  to  proceed  for  3                 additional
 minutes.)
 Mr. McDONALD. Mr. Chairman, if the
 gentleman will yield further and con-
 tinuing on that point, is the majority
 leader saying that the people on Taiwan
 believe they are part of the mainland
 Chinese Government, or that they them-
 selves are an independent republic?
 Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I will
 let the gentleman define for himself what
 he believes the people may conceive to
 be their case. The people on Taiwan for
 30 years have maintained that theirs
 was and should be the proper govern-
 ment for all of China, including main-
 land China. Those on mainland China
 have maintained that theirs was and of
 right ought to be the government for all
 of China, including Taiwan.
 Now, the only way we can break apart
 from these two separate interpretations
 would be to establish a two-China policy.
 Both Taiwan and mainland China have
 rejected that conclusion.
 ^ 1535
 It is not an option available to us. So
 whatever the gentleman desires to use
 by way of reference may be his. We in
 the Congress, and members on the com-
 mittee on Foreign Affairs, have very
 carefully drafted language which permits
 us to do those things which we desire to
 do as a nation: To maintain our rather
 special relationship with Taiwan and its
 people. The gentleman may call them
 what he wishes.
 Mr. CHARLES H. WILSON of Cali-
 fornia. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman
 yield?
 Mr. WRIGHT. I yield to the gentle-
 man from California.
 Mr. CHARLES H. WILSON of Cali-
 fornia. I thank the gentleman for yield-
 ing.
 Mr. Chairman, the gentleman men-
 tioned, in his discussions with those rep-
 resentatives from the Republic of China
 about this legislation, that they were in
 agreement with the legislation. Would
 it be appropriate for the gentleman to
 mention the names of those people from
 the Republic of China with whom he has
 discussed this?
 Mr. WRIGHT. I would be happy to do
 so were I certain of my memory. I am
 sorry to say that I am not just sure that
 I can recall. The names are available
 in my office. I would prefer not to make
 an effort and give an inaccurate or only
 partially accurate response. I hope the
 gentleman will not insist on an answer
 at this time. I will supply it for the
 RECORD.
 Mr. CHARLES H. WILSON of Cali-
 fornia. No. I understand this completely.
 Mr. WRIGHT. I have not the ability.
 to recall with sufficient confidence in my
 memory at the moment.
 Mr. CHARLES H. WILSON of Cali-
 fornia. Did the gentleman, by chance,
 discuss this with Minister S. K. Hu, who
 is now replacing Ambassador Chen who
 is representing the Republic of China
 here? Does the gentleman recall any dis-
 cussions with Minister Hu on this sub-
 ject?
 Mr. WRIGHT. I do not believe that he
 was one of those with whom I talked. I
 would appreciate it very much if the
 gentleman would not further contribute
 to my temporary embarrassment over
 my inability to recall with clarity the
 names of those with whom I discussed
 this matter. Two of them came to my
 office a month or 6 weeks ago, and we
 had .a rather lengthy discussion. I shall
 supply their names later today.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman from Texas (Mr. WRIGHT) has
 expired.
 (On request of Mr. HANSEN and by
 unanimous consent, Mr. WRIGHT was al-
 lowed to proceed for 1 additional min-
 ute.)
 Mr. HANSEN. Mr. Chairman, will the
 distinguished majority leader yield for
 a question?
 Mr. WRIGHT. I yield to my friend, th
 gentleman from Idaho (Mr. HANSEN).
 Mr. HANSEN. Mr. Chairman, it seems
 that there has been some information
 that passes through here, and I notice
 it was used in the dialog a moment ago,
 about the fact that there is not a two-
 China policy, there has not been a two-
 China policy, and I guess I am wonder-
 ing what we had for 7 years when we had
 a consulate office in the People's Republic
 of China and an Embassy in Taipei. It
 seems to me that there was, in actuality,
 a two-China policy for 7 years, until our
 current President decided to abdicate
 that One entity, the People's Republic of
 China, and sever relations with the Re`-
 public of China.
 How can the gentleman say there has
 not been a two-China policy when it was
 there, in reality?
 Mr. WRIGHT. The gentleman is en-
 titled to his own interpretation. I think
 perhaps it amounted to something less
 than a two-China policy. The people,
 both in Peking and in Taipei, reject of-
 ficially the concept of a two-China policy.
 Mr. HANSEN. Would the gentleman
 concede that perhaps there was a One
 and one-half China, policy? There is
 more than a one-China policy, with the
 recognition of the two nations.
 Mr. WRIGHT. If that were the case
 in the past, it may be so described by
 some in the future, in the bill which the
 committee has drafted. The gentleman
 is entitled to his interpretation. I merely
 suggest to the committee that this is a
 strong bill. This is not a bill dictated by
 the President. it is a bill created by the
 Congress to express our intense desire to
 maintain our friendly relations with Tai-
 wan and to assert our continued interest
 in the safety and security of Taiwan. I
 believe the committee wisely has gone as
 far as it can go and should go. I believe
 this is the most that we can successfully
 enact into law. I would appeal on that
 ground with my friend to support this
 legislation rather than find fault with it.
 ^ 1540
 Mr.  BUCHANAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I
 move to strike the requisite number of
 words.
 Mr. Chairman, I join the distinguished
 majority leader in applauding the efforts
 of the President in the Middle East, but
 I want to make plain, as one proponent
 of this legislation produced with some
 reluctance   and   with   considerable
 thought by the Committee on Foreign
 Affairs, that I do not endorse the Presi=dent's China policy, nor do I feel that we
 should not have a two-China policy. It
 is the only rational policy to have. Had
 I personally been the President of the
 United States-God forbid-but had I
 been, we neither would have negotiated
 the Panama Canal treaties as they are,
 nor would we have come to this agree-
 ment with China.
 Now, what we are setting up may ap-
 pear to be a very phony operation, but it
 is the only means under the agreement
 the President has made by which we can
 restore and sustain vital relationships
 between the United States and Taiwan.
 I believe the President had the consti-
 tutional authority and the prerogatives

 March 13, 1979           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE
 to do what he did, although I disagree
 with him. I am quite certain the major-
 ity leader is right, that if we in this bill
 in any way include provisions that pro-
 vide for government-to-government re-
 lations, the President will proclaim that
 to be an invasion of his constitutional
 prerogatives. He will veto the bill, and
 we will not be helping the people on Tai-
 wan or the Republic of China which, yes,
 does exist and is an entity and, yes, is
 in control of Taiwan-and in my judg-
 ment ought to be.
 Now, I believe the only thing we can
 do here is either decide by voting for one
 .of these series of amendments that we
 will, yes, have a confrontation with the
 President, go through the exercise of
 a veto, and then come back on another
 .,day to try to pass legislation to restore
 and sustain those vital relationships, or
 decide to pass it now. The fact is that,
 however much I may disagree with what
 the President has done, however dif-
 ferent what I would have done would
 have been, he has done it. I believe it is
 within his constitutional prerogative to
 do so. Under these circumstances, I see
 no alternative but to pass the strongest
 legislation we can pass other than one
 which includes elements pertaining to
 government-to-government relations be-
 tween the United States and Taiwan.
 I personally hope and pray and shall
 work for the day when what ought to
 happen does happen, and that is that
 Taiwan declares itself to be an independ-
 ent entity from the mainland, declares
 its independence, exercises its self-deter-
 mination, and the day in which the
 United States recognizes as the Govern-
 ment of Taiwan with full diplomatic
 relations that government which the
 Taiwanese themselves shall choose.
 Let me say one further thing on that
 subject. Long ago, Taiwan should have
 declared its independence and we should
 have had a two-China policy. I hope and
 pray we-
 Mr. CHARLES H. WILSON of Cali-
 fornia. Mr.- Chairman, will the gentle-
 man yield?
 Mr. BUCHANAN. Yes.
 Mr. CHARLES H. WILSON of Cali-
 fornia. Mr. Chairman, I am disturbed
 when the gentleman says he would not
 have done what the President did, but
 we have no choice but to follow what
 the President has decided that we should
 do. Now, we have several important
 issues coming up here that I hope that
 this philosophy is not going to prevail.
 We are going to have some very impor-
 tant votes on implementation of the
 Panama Canal treaties, and I hope we
 .are not going to be told, "Well, the treaty
 is law and we have to pass it; we have
 no choice."
 Mr. BUCHANAN. Our only choice, I
 believe, I say to the gentleman, is action
 by the Congress. Otherwise it is Taiwan
 that suffers-it is Taiwan that suffers-
 not the People's Republic of China, not
 the  government  I  would not  have
 recognized.
 We must restore the relationship to
 Taiwan, because the diplomatic recogni-
 tion has been transferred, but I am say-
 ing that this committee, the House For-
 eign Affairs Committee, and this Com-
 mittee of the Whole House sooner or
 later must act to restore our relations to
 Taiwan on whatever'basis we can.
 I am not saying we have no choice. If
 we want to have a confrontation with
 the President, we can. If we want to have
 a veto, we can. If we want to string this
 out for a period in which we do not re-
 store the relationship, we do not change
 the law so that we can continue to have
 those vital relations with Taiwan, we
 can string it out forever.
 ^ 1545
 Certainly, that is our prerogative, but
 we cannot change the basic situation
 which the President has created by' the
 exercise, I believe unwisely, of constitu-
 tional prerogatives which he does, in
 fact, have.
 The fact of the matter is that through
 the provisions of this legislation, we are
 maintaining relations-trade relations,
 cultural relations, and defense commit-
 ments to the people on Taiwan. However,
 were we to adopt sonfe of these provi-
 sions which would establish more formal
 relations, we would be likely to end these
 relations, because the President would,
 first, veto the legislation, or second, re-
 fuse to acknowledge the formal repre-
 sentatives of the Republic of China. In
 either instance we would have no vehicle
 through which to maintain our relation-
 ships with the Republic of China, the
 Government of Taiwan. While I do have
 serious reservations with regard to our
 relations with the People's Republic of
 China, I feel it is more important to
 maintain  our relationship with  the
 people of Taiwan than, to try to do what
 we do not have the power to do, and that
 is to unrecognize the People's Republic.
 The President has made his decision.
 It is up to us to frame the strongest ties
 with people on Taiwan possible without
 risking the total halt to those ties.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, I move
 to strike the requisite number of words.
 Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment
 not identical but similar to three others
 which the committee has defeated. We
 defeated similar amendments last week,
 and three of them today.
 Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I ask unan-
 imous consent that all debate on this
 amendment and all amendments thereto
 conclude in 5 minutes.
 The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection
 to the request of the gentleman from
 Wisconsin?
 There was no objection.
 The CHAIRMAN. Members standing
 at the time the unanimous-consent re-
 quest was agreed to will be recognized for
 30 seconds each.
 The Chair recognizes the gentleman
 from Michigan (Mr. BROOMFIELD).
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I
 rise in opposition to the amendment.
 I just want to associate myself with
 the remarks of the chairman of our com-
 mittee, the gentleman from Wisconsin
 (Mr. ZABLOCKI).
 We have had numerous amendments
 which affect the government-to-govern-
 ment relationship.
 In my judgment, if this amendment
 passes, all we are going to do is to jeop-
 ardize the legislation. We are going to
 H 1275
 have to have new legislation again. The
 President has indicated that he is op-
 posed to this kind of arrangement be-
 cause of the agreement he has made with
 the PRC.
 I therefore oppose the amendment,
 Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield to me briefly?
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Yes, I am happy to
 yield to the gentleman from Texas.
 Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I thank
 the gentleman for yielding. I should like
 to respond now to the question asked
 earlier by the gentleman from California
 (Mr. CHARLES H. WILSON).
 He asked for the names of the two Tai-
 wanese who came to visit me. On Feb-
 ruary 2 I was visited by C. T. Chang and
 H. K. Yang. The latter is represented to
 me to be the official designee handling
 the transition for the Government on
 Taiwan.
 (By unanimous consent, Mr. HOPKINS
 and Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma yielded
 their time to Mr. SOLOMON.)
 The Chair recognizes the gentleman
 from Pennsylvania (Mr. MARKS).
 Mr. MARKS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in
 opposition to this amendment.
 (By unanimous consent, Mr. MARKS
 yielded his time to Mr. SKELTON.)
 The CHAIRMAN. The Chair recog-
 nizes the gentleman from California
 (Mr. LAGOMARSINO).
 (Mr. LAGOMARSINO asked and was
 given permission to revise and extend'
 his 'remarks. )
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Mr. Chairman,
 the gentleman from New York (Mr.
 BINGHAM)  mentioned Cuba in his re-
 marks.
 I would point out that Cuba is not
 recognized by the United States. How-
 ever, we do have an official interest sec-
 tion in Havana, staffed by official State
 Department personnel. There are only 4
 million people there; we take the position
 that that government is an enemy. Yet
 there are 17 million people on Taiwan
 who are and have been our friends for
 over the last 30 years.
 It seems to me that inasmuch as estab-
 lishing a consular office does not con-
 stitute diplomatic recognition; it would
 not hurt the basic purposes of this act
 to adopt this amendment. If the Presi-
 dent feels it would, then, of course, he
 will have to do what he feels it is his
 duty to do, just as we have to do what we
 feel it is our duty to do.
 ^ 1550
 The CHAIRMAN. The Chair recog-
 nizes the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
 BAUMAN).
 Mr. BAUMAN. Mr. Chairman, the ma-
 jority leader just said he was visited by
 two Taiwanese officials on February 2
 and that they endorsed this legislation.
 This legislation did not exist on Febru-
 ary 2. It was not written or reported until
 February 28. The implication in his re-
 marks is that officials of the Republic of
 China want no change in the bill, that
 they will swallow anything under duress.
 I think this statement deserves some
 clarification. I doubt that the free Chi-
 nese would endorse this legislation. I

 think they would support this consular
 amendment.
 The CHAIRMAN. The Chair recog-
 nizes the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.
 SKELTON).
 Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, we
 have before us a legal issue that I think
 we should face up to and discuss very
 briefly. I would like to refer, Mr. Chair-
 man, to the Supreme Court case of ex
 parte Garland which deals with one of
 the two exclusive powers of the President
 regarding the power of pardon, stating
 that the power of the Presidential par-
 don is unlimited and that this power
 is not subject to legislative control, in a
 very comparable situation; and also the
 Supreme Court case of the United States
 against Curtis-Wright Corp., which says
 the President is the sole organ of the
 Nation in its external relations, and it
 is the sole representative with foreign
 nations.
 Thus, this decision not to have a diplo-
 matic office of any kind in Taiwan is
 one that can, under our Constitution, be
 made by the Chief Executive alone. It
 is  constitutionally his sole decision.
 Thus, I think we have no choice but to
 defeat this amendment under the terms
 of the U.S. Constitution.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman has expired.
 The Chair recognizes the gentleman
 from New York (Mr. SOLOMON).
 Mr.  SOLOMON.  Mr.  Chairman, I
 would just like to point out to the hon-
 orable majority leader that my prede-
 cessor once removed, the Honorable
 Carleton J. King, who I know was a good
 friend of his, always spoke very flatter-
 ingly of the majority leader. During my
 tenure here, I have come to accept that
 flattery as truth.
 I would just like to say this, that
 when the majority leader started off by
 saying that my -amendment was not
 necessary because it was really already
 contained in the bill, and then went on
 to tear this amendment apart bit by bit,
 he totally confused me and many Mem-
 bers of this House. Many Members of this
 House today are completely confused
 about this whole issue, as is the Depart-
 ment of State of this country.
 In my conversations with them, I got
 the distinct impression that they were
 afraid that this amendment will work.
 They really, I believe, in their own
 hearts, as I believe truly the majority
 leader believes, believe that this is what
 we really need-a consulate office in Tai-
 wan. I believe if we are going to pass this
 amendment and send it on to the confer-
 ence with the Senate, because of all the
 other amendments that we have to have
 considered by this joint body, I believe
 that we ought to do it in order to clarify
 all of these serious issues that many of
 us have brought up over the last 2 days
 in the debate on this most important
 issue.
 I would really urge the passage of this
 amendment so that we can go to the
 conference to see if it passes there.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the
 gentleman has expired.
 The Chair recognizes the gentleman
 from New York (Mr. WOLFF).
 Mr. WOL1P. Mr. Chairman, the au-
 thor of this amendment says he is con-
 fused, and I guess' that is a very true
 statement. There are some people in this
 body who would like to be more Taiwan-
 ese than the Taiwanese themselves. I
 have a letter here from former President
 Nixon which clearly delineates the posi-
 tion we find ourselves today. I quote:.
 Any one of us might have handled this
 situation differently, but now that the de-
 cision has been made, we should look to the
 future and to the past.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-,
 tleman has expired.
 The Chair recognizes the gentleman
 from Wisconsin (Mr. ZABLOCKI), the
 chairman of the committee, to close the
 debate.
 (Mr. ZABLOCKI asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, this
 amendment, as I pointed out earlier, is
 similar to amendments that would pro-
 vide for government-to-government re-
 lations that the committee has defeated
 resoundingly several times today. I might
 say to' my colleague and a member of
 the committee, my good friend, the gen-
 tleman from California (Mr. LAGOMAR-
 snvo), that the creation or establishment
 of consular relations is certainly, as the
 gentleman knows, a government-to-gov-
 ernment act. The consulate is the busi-
 ness arm of the Embassy; the Embassy
 is the arm of the President. Mr. Chair-
 man, I hope the amendment will be de-
 feated.

 So the amendment was rejected.
 The results of the vote was announced
 as above recorded.
 The CHAIRMAN. Are there further
 amendments to title II?
 AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. DANNEMEYER
 Mr. DANNEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I
 offer an amendment.
 The Clerk read as follows:
 Amendment offered by Mr. DANNERIEYER:
 On page 5, strike out lines 1 through 5 and
 insert in lieu thereof the following: "deal-
 ings of the United States Government with
 Taiwan shall be conducted through a quasi-
 governmental entity, to be designated "The
 United States Commission in Taiwan" (here-
 inafter referred to as the "designated en-
 tity".) ".
 ^ 1615
 Mr. DANNEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I
 supported early amendments calling for
 more direct relations between the United
 States and Taiwan. However, the House
 has not approved those. Therefore, I am
 offering an amendment which, because of
 its ambiguity, allows the United States
 to continue more direct relations with
 the government and people of Taiwan,
 while still allowing the administration
 and the State Department latitude in our
 relations with the People's Republic of
 China.
 Mr. Chairman, my amendment offers
 at least a minimum of recognition of
 reality to 17 million people and their
 government, while not directly granting
 full  government-to-government  rela-
 tions.
 I urge the Members to support this
 amendment in the interest of fair play
 and in the interest of recognizing reality.
 ? Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying
 which goes: "When you get to the end
 of a rope, you tie a knot and hold on."
 I think that is where we are to keep
 from falling off. We should understand
 that this bill, if it is adopted in the form
 in which it is before us, will, in effect,
 create a monster for any American busi-
 nessman wanting to do business. in Tai-
 wan. Those o: us who have been involved
 in business know that it is tough enough
 when one has to deal through two gov-
 ernments to get where he wants to go.
 However, now, in our wisdom, we are pre-
 paring to add an entity in the United
 States and an entity in Taiwan, saying,
 in effect, that if a businessman in the
 United States wants to do business with
 a company in Taiwan, he has to go
 through four offices to get something
 done.
 Mr. Chairman, that judgment of the
 House, I think, is where we are; and I
 do not seek to change that, although the
 last amendment did. This amendment,
 however, accepts the concept of the pri-
 vate entity.
 Mr. Chairman, if the Members will
 read the language on page 5 of the pro-
 posed bill, they will see that we seek by
 legislation to create a new entity. In the
 bill before us it is called a "nongovern-
 mental entity."
 All this amendment does is to change
 the word "nongovernmental" to "quasi-
 governmental."
 Immediately someone may ask, "Why
 in the world are you trying to do that?"
 The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.
 ZABLOCKI), the learned chairman of the
 committee, several times in the debate
 today made reference himself to the fact
 that this entity is a quasi-governmental
 entity.
 Since I am one who tries to deal in
 reality and since I always pursue that
 purpose in legislation, it strikes me that
 it is only appropriate that the legisla-
 tion which we adopt reflect what we are
 doing; and if we are, in fact, establish-
 ing quasi-governmental relations, why
 do we not say it in this bill?
 That is what this amendment is all
 about. Let us make no mistake about it,
 some day an appelate court someplace
 is going to decide what we are doing with
 this new entity. I submit that if we have
 the courage to say that this entity has
 the status of a quasi-governmental en-
 tity, we are giving it a leg up in terms
 of its respectability and an enhanced
 chance of some businessman having his
 rights protected.
 ^ 1620
 That is what this is all about. I think
 it will give some encouragement to our
 friends on Taiwan that we are con-
 cerned about their continued viability
 as an economic unit. I ask for the Mem-
 bers' support.
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Mr. Chairman,
 will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. DANNEMEYER. I yield to the
 gentleman from California.
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. I thank the gen-
 tleman for yielding.
 I want to compliment the gentleman
 on his amendment. As he knows, I sup-
 ported the other amendments that spoke
 to this same section of the law that at-
 tempted to create something more of-
 ficial, but I think that with the amend-
 ment the gentleman is proposing what
 we are really doing is calling it what it
 is. Throughout the discussion today and
 last week, numerous speakers have re-
 ferred to the entity that is created in the
 bill as it came out of the committee in
 terms such as quasi-governmental. It
 really is quasi-governmental. It is paid
 by the Government. It is under the di-
 rection of the Department of State. I
 do not think there is anybody on this
 floor who thinks for a moment that if
 the President or the Department of State
 directs those gentlemen in that partic-
 ular entity to do something that they
 would not do it.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman has expired.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, I rise
 in opposition to the amendment. This is
 another amendment attempting by the
 side door or back door to try to establish
 a government-to-government relation-
 ship. The gentleman has stated that the
 gentleman from Wisconsin referred to
 the entity as a quasigovernmental insti-
 tution, and that is very true.
 Mr. Chairman, in view of the fact
 that we have had this repetitious array
 of amendments that have been intro-
 duced by Members-and I am basically
 very patient-time is really of the es-
 sence. I think we have had an oppor-
 tunity to discuss this legislation and the
 amendments.
 Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that debate on all amendments
 pending and all amendments thereto
 end at 4:45 o'clock.
 The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection
 to the request of the gentleman from
 Wisconsin?
 Mr. BAUMAN. Reserving the right to
 object, could the Chair tell us how many
 amendments are at the desk?
 The. CHAIRMAN. There are eight
 amendments at the desk.
 Mr. BAUMAN. Further reserving the
 right' to object, the gentleman from
 Ohio (Mr. ASHBROOK) has two amend-
 ments that he has been waiting to offer
 since last Thursday. I am sure they are
 superior, knowing the quality of his
 amendments. It seems to me that that is
 a somewhat arbitrary restriction on the
 time. The President is not arriving at
 Andrews until 12:45 tomorrow morning.
 The gentleman can still make it to the
 airport in plenty of time.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. BAUMAN. I yield to the gentleman
 from Wisconsin.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I thank the gentleman
 for yielding.
 As far as the gentleman from Wiscon-
 sin is concerned, I am willing to stay
 here until midnight, and I asked the
 gentleman from Maryland if he would
 stay with me on the floor, and he failed
 to respond.
 Mr. BAUMAN. I will not only stay with
 the gentleman, but I.will hold his hand
 if he begins to feel faint.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. And right from here
 we could go to Andrews Air Base.
 Mr. BAUMAN. No. I will not go that
 far.
 Mr. Chairman, I object.
 The CHAIRMAN. Objection is heard.
 ? Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, I move
 that debate on all amendments pending
 and all amendments thereto end at 5
 o'clock.
 The CHAIRMAN. The question is on
 the motion offered by the gentleman from
 Wisconsin (Mr. ZABLOCKI).
 ^ 1625
 The question was taken; and on a divi-
 sion (demanded by Mr. ASHBROOK) there
 were-ayes 53, noes 40.

 Messrs. JACOBS, DICKINSON, FISH,
 WHITE,  GONZALEZ,  and  WHITE-
 HURST changed their vote. from "aye"
 to "no."
 So the motion was agreed to.
 The result of the vote was announced
 as above recorded.
 The CHAIRMAN. Accordingly, all de-
 bate on this bill and all amendments to
 the bill will cease at 5 p.m.
 ^ 1645
 PREFERENTIAL MOTION OFFERED BY MR. BAUMAN
 Mr. BAUMAN. Mr. Chairman, I offer
 a preferential motion.
 The Clerk read as follows:
 Mr. BAUMAN moves that the Committee
 do now rise and report the bill back to the
 House with the recommendation that the
 enacting clause be stricken.
 Mr. BAUMAN. Mr. Chairman, I regret
 that I have to take the time of the com-
 mittee by this parliamentary device. But
 this is the only way to obtain the time to
 discuss this bill in what I assume are its
 final moments before the House. How-
 teristic of the gentleman, who has served
 with great distinction as chairman of
 this committee, to try to limit the rights
 of Members. There are eight amend-
 ments pending at the desk and other
 amendments still to be offered from the
 floor. It is not even 5 p.m. I do not know
 of any major cocktail party or any lobby-
 ing groups holding dinners tonight. Thq
 President will not be back from Israel
 until tomorrow morning. Yet we are told
 that we have to condense the future of
 18 million free Taiwanese and Chinese
 into 10 minutes' debate. That is a shame-
 ful situation.
 Mr. Chairman, this situation is not to
 the credit of this great body or the com-
 mittee which presented this legislation
 to the House.
 I can only say, Mr. Chairman, that as
 one Member of the House who has read
 this legislation, unparalleled as it is in
 our history, I would urge the Members
 to vote against it. There is no validity to
 the argument that this legislation helps
 the Taiwanese. It is, as I suggested the
 other day, rendering the same service
 as the corpse receives from the grave-
 digger.
 This bill eventually is going to nail
 shut the coffin of a free Taiwan, I hope
 that everyone will oppose it.
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. BAUMAN. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Ohio (Mr. AsHeRooK), who
 was precluded by the motion of the gen-
 tleman from Wisconsin from offering his
 amendments.
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Chairman, I
 thank my colleague for yielding.
 I hope the American people develop
 some understanding of just what is hap-
 pening here. We are getting into the
 middle of March. This body has done
 next to nothing. We have had little legis-
 lative output. We have had token ses-
 sions, and now when the first major bill
 of any importance comes up, the ma-
 jority has gagged* the minority.
 ^ 1650
 Let me repeat that. The majority on a
 rollcall vote has gagged the minority.
 Not necessarily a party majority, I might.
 add. It is going to be a long session, and
 it will ill behoove anyone who wants co-
 operation later in the session to preclude
 those of us who have serious amend-
 ments from offering them at this time
 in this forum. This House has not done
 itself a service, and those of us in the
 philosophical minority who wanted open
 debate ought to realize precisely what is
 being done to us. There will come a time
 and place when they want some coopera-
 'tion. We will serve notice right now that
 we will return it in kind.
 Mr. BAUMAN. The gentleman is cor-

 Richmond

 Robinson          foreign policy matter of this magnitude
 Roth              to discuss at length, if necessary, the pro-

 Schulze

 rect. I will add it saddens me to know
 that some of the votes that produced the
 gag rule in this House were provided by
 our side of the aisle, the minority side.
 That does not speak very well, I think,
 for the manner in which the House is to
 conduct its business. I would suggest if
 the motion now pending before the House
 is adopted and the enacting clause is
 stricken, we might very well come back
 with legislation that is better in its final
 form than this is. It would not take much
 to be better than this legislation.
 Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 . Mr. BAUMAN. I yield to the gentleman
 from Texas.
 Mr. GONZALEZ. I thank the gentle-
 man for yielding.
 the gentleman said awhile ago that
 the majority throttles the minority. I
 want to point out that some of us on
 the majority are with the minorit ' in
 this case, and we voted against throttling
 anybody.
 Mr. BAUMAN. The gentleman from
 Texas deserves the thanks of the com-
 mittee for making that statement. I just
 wish there were more like him.
 Mr. DICKINSON. Mr. Chairman, the
 people of the United States and the 17
 million free people of the Republic of
 China (ROC) who live on Taiwan have
 been friends for a long time. We are
 similar peoples in many ways. We both
 believe in human freedom and demo-
 cratic, representative government; we
 both believe in and practice the free
 enterprise economic system; we both be-
 lieve in and practice freedom of religion
 (millions on Taiwan practice some of
 the same faiths that millions of Ameri-
 cans practice) ; and for years we have
 been partners in resisting the spread of
 Communism in Asia. I' go to Taiwan to
 take a message from the American peo-
 ple that the great majority of Americans
 are very much concerned with the con-
 tinued security of Taiwan as a nation.
 Now the people of Taiwan and the
 millions of Americans who disagree with
 it are faced with an ill-founded policy
 by the Carter administration that vio-
 lates our longstanding commitment to
 the freedom of the ROC. This new policy,
 which betrays the ROC, is unacceptable
 to me, and I believe to the great major-
 ity of Americans. We have always served
 the role of "Freedom's" guardian in the
 world. Certainly we would never have
 dealt away, directly or indirectly, the
 liberty of another 'free people. And yet
 that will be the result of administration
 plans to abrogate the ROC-U.S. Mutual
 Defense Treaty. I have no objections to
 developing our relations with Red China,
 but not at the expense of Taiwan's free-
 dom.
 United States security relationships
 with Taiwan have not been a one-way
 street. The ROC has served as a valuable
 outpost of freedom and an ally to the
 United States through both the Korean
 and Vietnam wars, while the Red Chi-
 nese provided manpower, weapons, and
 money to kill Americans and to thwart
 U.S. efforts to help free nations in that
 part of the world. And I believe there can
 be future requirements for a United
 States-Taiwan  military  relationship.
 How can we be assured the Red Chinese
 will always want to be our friends? We
 should not make that assumption.
 The admiinistration "hints' that it has
 private understandings that Red China
 will not destroy free China. Who can be-
 lieve such "dreams" when the mainland
 leadership asserts publicly that they "will
 not wait long for reunification," and that
 it will be brought about by "force if nec-
 essary."
 Actually, the mainland Red Chinese
 may be able to legally destroy Taiwan
 without firing a shot. The President's
 statement that there is only "one China"
 and that Taiwan is a part of the main-
 land establishes the PRC's legal claim
 under international law to all land, sea,
 and air territorial rights presently exer-
 cised by Taiwan.
 In the future, after Jimmy Carter is
 gone from the scene, what will the United
 States and other nations do when the
 PRC blockades Taiwan and announces to
 the world that all sea and air traffic to
 the island is forbidden? In such an event
 the free people of Taiwan will be cut off
 from the world and at the mercy of Red
 China. Would the United States use force
 of arms to keep the air and sea lanes to
 Taiwan open? When the Red Chinese an-
 nounce in the U.N. that this is an "inter-
 nal matter and of no concern to the
 United States, the U.N., or the outside
 world," what can the free world say then?
 The thing that bothers me most about
 the President's new China policy-and
 our so-called diplomats at the White
 House and the State Department who
 concocted it-is that they act like they
 are playing some impersonal game like
 chess. But we are talking about the free-
 dom and lives of real "flesh and blood"
 people-millions of innocent children,
 women, and men who live on Taiwan. We
 are not playing with plastic toys.
 I hope that our Nation, acting through
 this great deliberative body, will act re-
 sponsibly and morally and give the free
 people on Taiwan the security guarantees
 that the administrations' "sham" pro-
 posal will not do. We should, at least, give
 Taiwan the same diplomatic status that
 we have given the People's Republic of
 China for the last several years. We have
 recognized two Chinas with an embassy
 on Taiwan and a liaison mission in Pe-
 king. We should do at least the same
 thing for.Taiwan-that is, establish offi-
 cial diplomatic contacts between Taiwan
 and Washington with a liaison mission.
 I hope this body will not formalize the
 administration's action of "abandoning"
 the people of Taiwan.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, I rise
 in opposition to the preferential motion.
 It is not the intent of the gentleman
 from Wisconsin to cut off debate without
 due consideration of the amendments
 that were pending and the amendments
 that were offered. We have debated this
 10-page bill for 2 days. Many of the
 amendments that were offered were
 similar. At one point we had four simi-
 lar amendments, and it appeared to the
 gentleman from Wisconsin that some
 Members in this body were resorting to
 ?  111279
 dilatory tactics. I think everybody under-
 stands what this bill is intended to do.
 I see no reason to debate it any further.
 There are some who just do not intend
 to listen to the explanations of the pur-
 poses of this legislation.
 Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield for a question?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Texas.
 Mr. GONZALEZ. I thank the gentle-
 man for yielding.
 During this debate I have been in-
 trigued by reference to the various en-
 tities here discussed, and I have here a
 copy of a Department of State memo-
 randum to all assistant secretaries and
 office heads. It says:
 With the recognition of the People's Re-
 public of China as the sole legitimate gov-
 ernment of China and with the severance of
 diplomatic relations with the authorities on
 Taiwan, guidelines are necessary to insure
 that all U.S. Government official statements
 and publications concerning Taiwan conform
 to our policy.
 It goes on and says,
 things-
 The  adjectival  form  is  "Taiwan,"  not
 "Taiwanese." People should be referred to as
 "from Taiwan," "on Taiwan," "of Taiwan,"
 etc., rather than as Taiwanese.
 I just think we ought to be informed
 on this.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I am happy that the
 gentleman from Texas has informed the
 others. I do not necessarily agree with
 the Department of State's definitions or
 interpretations or orders.
 Mr. BAUMAN. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Maryland.
 Mr. BAUMAN. I thank the gentleman
 for yielding.
 Did I hear the gentleman say that in
 connection with this legislation he did
 not agree with the Department of State
 on some aspect of this bill?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Not in all aspects.
 That is very clear.
 Mr. BAUMAN. I thought I heard that.
 Amazing.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. As I advised the gen-
 tleman from Maryland time and time
 again, if he had only seen the legislation
 the executive branch. had sent to the
 Congress, he would fully realize to what
 extent we perfected it and brought forth
 legislation that I think is worthy of sup-
 port.
 Mr. Chairman, I yield back the re-
 mainder of my time.
 The CHAIRMAN. The question is on
 the preferential motion offered by the
 gentleman from Maryland (Mr. BAU-
 MAN).

 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Mr. Chairman,
 this amendment would establish a joint
 congressional commission which would
 monitor implementation of this act, and
 U.S. policy concerning security and co-
 operation in East Asia.
 The commission would also oversee
 the operation of the U.S. entity which
 was approved earlier today. It Is spe-
 cifically charged with seeing that free
 cultural, economic, and other exchanges
 with Taiwan are maintained. In addi-
 tion, it would review the human rights
 of the Chinese on Taiwan.
 The commission would have a 4-year
 lifespan, and would be composed of six
 Members from each Chamber. The House
 Foreign  Affairs  Committee  and  the
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee
 would each have three Members serving
 on the committee.
 The need for an oversight commission
 is obvious to those who have followed
 the course of this legislation. The need
 was also obvious to the U.S. Senate,
 which has already agreed to a similar
 amendment. The need stems from the
 inability of the administration's pro-
 posed "institution" to guard the freedom
 of the people on Taiwan.
 This commission would supplement the
 fine work already being done by the
 chairman of the Foreign Affairs Com-
 mittee. Besides requiring that three
 members from the Foreign Affairs Com-
 mittee serve on the commission, the
 amendment requires consultation be-
 tween the commission and the com-
 mittee.
 These provisions are not .included in
 the amendment adopted by the other
 body.
 I would expect that the commission
 also will work closely with the chairman
 and the ranking member of the Subcom-
 mittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs.
 Let me briefly summarize the need for
 such a commission that will be estab-
 lished by this amendment.
 First, the new relationship with Tai-
 wan is unprecedented. The only distant
 connection would be the oversight com-

 to time consult with and provide informa- Helsinki agreements. I doubt if any of
 tion to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of my colleagues question the value of that
 the House of Representatives and the Com-  'commission. Similarly, an oversight com-
 mittee on Foreign Relations of the Senate,                                                    mission to monitor the events in East
 and the Joint Commission shall provide in- Asia would have the same effect. It would

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE          March 13,. 1979
 Second, the new relationship with
 China is untested. Who is going to guar-
 antee the freedom of Taiwan in the ab-
 sence of the security treaty? Peking has
 publicly stated that it has not changed
 its "reunification" plans. With this com-
 mission Congress will have a formal
 instrument which could closely monitor
 these possible developments. It seems to
 me that this is the least the Congress
 could do to demonstrate its concern for
 our ally of 30 years.
 Third, we have $7.2 billion of trade
 with Taiwan; she is our. ninth largest
 trading partner. Peking could easily
 strangulate this vital economic link-
 through blockade, embargo, or some
 other form of economic squeeze. The pro-
 posed "institute" would be unable to
 prevent such actions, any more than it
 would be able to promote our trade with
 Taiwan in a normal pattern. A congres-
 sional body, as proposed in this amend-
 ment will have the authority and intent
 of purpose to monitor this important
 aspect of our relations with Taiwan.
 I think that my colleagues would wel-
 come this commission in light of the
 ambiguity which funs throughout this
 legislation.
 In summary, Mr. Chairman, the over-
 sight commission is needed for several
 reasons: It dramatically shows that Tai-
 wan has not been forgotten by Congress;
 that an official body of ongoing contact
 has been set up, that we will formally
 monitor and report on the continuing
 status and freedom of Taiwan, and that
 this process will formally involve the
 Congress of the United States in the
 oversight function.
 AMENDMENT OFFERED BY  MR. BROOMFIELD AS
 A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE AMENDMENT OFFERED
 BY MR. LAGOMARSINO
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I

 So the amendment was rejected.
 The result of the vote was announced

 The CHAIRMAN. For what purpose
 does the gentleman from New York (Mr.

 Mr. PEYSER. Mr. Chairman, due to
 the fact that all time for debate on the
 amendments at the desk has expired, I

 amendments be considered and voted
 on in 5 minutes instead of 15 minutes.
 The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from New

 Mr. BAUMAN. Mr. Chairman, reserv-
 ing the right to object, do I understand
 the gentleman's request is to reduce the
 voting time?
 Mr. PEYSER. Mr. Chairman, if the
 gentleman will yield, I am asking unani-
 mous consent that the voting time be
 reduced to 5 minutes, and the amend-
 ments can be voted on in that order.
 There is no debate on these amendments.
 Mr. BAUMAN. Mr. Chairman, when
 we start fooling around with the rules of
 the House, I must object.
 The CHAIRMAN. Objection is heard.
 Are there other amendments to title

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE           March 13, 1979
 appointed that the House chose to go
 along with the administration and thus,
 the Red Chinese, on several amendments
 which would have materially strength-
 ened U.S. support for the Republic of
 China. Included in those amendments
 were one which reaffirmed the U.S. posi-
 tion of 30 years and was contained in
 the Mutual Defense Treaty which re-
 quires the United States to act in accord-
 ance with constitutional processes to
 meet the danger of an armed attack
 against the Republic of China;  an
 amendment which sought to require the
 President to consider the possibility of
 withdrawing diplomatic recognition of
 Red China in the event of a threat to
 the security of the Republic of China;
 and an amendment that sought to re-
 quire that relations between the United
 States and the Republic of China be con-
 ducted through a liaison office rather
 than the so-called "nongovernmental,
 independent entity."
 Regardless of the foregoing, I would-
 like to state for the record that I found
 Mr. Carter's actions toward the Republic
 of China so incredible that they defy
 description by socially acceptable exple-
 tives. If December 8, 1941 was a "day of
 infamy" then December 15, 1978 ranks
 right up there in international betrayal.
 In this regard, I know that in some
 quarters it is simply not polite to remem-
 ber or mention the extermination of be-
 tween 32 and 61 million people in Red
 China, but ignoring history has never
 erased the facts.
 In pragmatic terms, I do not agree
 that recognition of Red China is a "sim-
 ple reality" when that reality is achieved
 by discounting the simple reality of 18
 million people in the Republic of China
 and the simple reality of the President
 unilaterally abrogating a Mutual De-
 fense Treaty. A two-China policy would
 have been the obvious goal and the one
 most reasonable persons would agree on.
 Why then did the United States come
 out of the negotiations with nothing and
 the People's Republic of China with ev-
 erything? There has not been such a
 "shutout" since the Giants beat the
 Redskins 52 to 0.
 Red China wanted us to remove our
 troops-they got it. They wanted us to
 break diplomatic ties-they got it. They
 wanted us to break the 1954 Defense
 Treaty-they got it. What did we get?
 They promised not to "object" to con-
 tinued interest in the future of Taiwan.
 (By the way, what does that mean exact-
 ly? Does that mean they promise not to
 send us a nasty telegram or not to de-
 clare war?) They allowed us to uphold
 the stipulation in the Defense Treaty
 that said the signators had to give 1
 year's notification to break the treaty.
 Now, I consider that a mighty big con-
 cession-allowing us to uphold the terms
 of a contract.
 Finally, they "tacitly" agreed not to
 object to arms sales to the Republic of
 China. I take that to mean that this is a
 gentleman's agreement, and I certainly
 do not want to muddy the waters by
 questioning the gentlexnanliness of the
 boys in Taipei.
 It is rather like saying that we all had
 a chicken dinner. We got the wings and
 the feathers; they got the rest. of the
 bird-but we all got chicken. This deal
 will certainly go down in history as a
 diplomatic coup-for Red China, that is.
 The pathetic thing about this whole
 mess, however, is that it is typical of this
 administration's conduct of foreign af-
 fairs, which could be kindly described as
 being riddled by ineptitude and hypoc-
 risy. We have had to watch a U.S. Presi-
 dent receive a tongue lashing from the
 President of Mexico while our President
 fumbles around with an embarrassing
 joke of questionable taste. We have had
 to put up with a U.S. Ambassador to the
 U.N. who is about as diplomatic as a bull
 in a china shop and even though he
 insults with impunity our strongest and
 closest allies, he is still on the job. We
 have had to watch a revolution in Iran,
 for which we were. totally unprepared
 and to which we had no official warning.
 And, finally, we have had to watch the
 one bright spot in, the administration's
 foreign policy, the Camp David accords,
 turn into yet another dismal failure.
 I am not going to go so far as to ques-
 tion the administration's sanity, but I do
 seriously question its commonsense and
 the credibility of its much-flaunted hu-
 man rights policy.
 In closing, I would like to reiterate
 that I am not pleased with this bill or
 the betrayal which forces its passage. It
 is rather like taking bitter medicine for
 the treatment of a terminal illness, and
 at this point, my, greatest hope is that
 Mr. Carter's stamp on America's foreign
 policy does not become so irrevocable
 that we cannot recoup some of the fail-
 ures after 1980.0
 0 Mr. ROUSSELOT. Mr. Chairman, the
 December 15th announcement by Presi-
 dent Carter that the United States and
 the People's Republic of China . had
 reached an agreement to "normalize"
 relations conditional upon : One, break-
 ing diplomatic relations with the Re-
 public of China on Taiwan; twp, the
 termination of the U.S.-Taiwan Mutual
 Defense Treaty; and three, the with-
 drawal of U.S. troops from Taiwan, is a
 disgrace to U.S. foreign policy. This ac-
 tion, taken alone by President Carter,
 has injured the virtue of the United
 States of America and has placed Amer-
 ica in the wretched situation of broken
 trust with the free Chinese on Taiwan.
 What free nation will again put confi-
 dence in a government that abrogates
 its treaties?
 The bill that this House is consider-
 ing today reaches new plateaus in politi-
 cal rhetoric. H.R. 2479 is written in
 dramatic language to profess friendship
 between the "people of the United
 States" and the "people of Taiwan" and
 it purports to "help maintain peace,
 security, and stability in the Western
 Pacific and to promote extensive and
 close relations" with Taiwan, but the
 members of the committee who are pre-
 senting this bill today are not playing
 the flip side of the record which, in fact,
 carries the explicit message that the
 United States intends to terminate its
 Defense Treaty and diplomatic ties with
 the Republic of China-a drastic change
 from the intention of the United States-
 Taiwan Mutual Defense Treaty. A gov-
 ernment-to-government treaty is a far
 stronger document than a people-to-
 people agreement.
 It is understandable that the adminis-
 tration wishes to "enhance consultative
 relations on matters of common interna-
 tional concern and expand bilateral re-
 lations" with the People's Republic of
 China. Improving relations has positive
 advantages for America, but certainly
 this could have been achieved without
 such a radical change in the U.S. policy
 toward the Republic of China on Taiwan.
 President Carter agreed to the terms
 of the People's Republic- of China in the
 agreement to establish full diplomatic re-
 lations and in so doing he blatantly ig'-
 nored congressional legislation that re-
 quired advance consultation with Con-
 gress gress prior to abrogation of any of the
 Mutual Defense Treaties with the Re-
 public of China. May I remind this House
 that in July of 1978 the Senate unani-
 mously (94 to 0) adopted an amendment
 offered to the International Security As-
 sistance Act by Senators STONE and DOLE
 which called on the President to consult
 with the Senate before making any pol-
 icy changes affecting the continuation of
 the United States-Republic of China Mu-
 tual Security Treaty. The amendment
 was later approved in a House-Senate
 conference, making it a resolution of the
 full Congress. Further, the United States
 (via President Carter) agreed to a mora-
 torium on new U.S. arms sales to the Re-
 public of China on Taiwan during 1979 in
 return for an "implied" commitment
 from the People's Republic of China not
 to threaten the security of the Chinese
 people on Taiwan. Who is kidding whom?
 To "imply".is not to make a direct state-
 rrient regarding rights and obligations.
 Can this administration be so naive as
 to conclude that the smooth, ingratiat-
 ingly tactful, and well-mannered utter-
 ances of Communist diplomats could be
 relied on as a commitment? When Vice
 Premier Teng visited our country, Presi-
 dent Carter, it is said, was supposed to
 obtain a firm commitment on Taiwan's
 security, but this subject was not dis-
 cussed and agreement was never reached,
 probably because President Carter knew
 Teng's position and that it was firm.
 What have we gained from normaliza-
 tion of relations with the People's Repub-
 lic of China? Have we not endangered
 the economic stability of Korea and Ja-
 pan who will find it very difficult to re-
 sist Peiping's pressure? The World Anti-
 Communist League, China chapter has
 stated that to effect the economic isola-
 tion of the Republic of China:
 The combined political, economic and mili-
 tary pressure exercised by Communist China
 around  Taiwan  will  increase  armament
 buildup and    cause  other destabilizing
 changes in all countries in the area.
 In the Philippines, Papua-New Guinea,
 Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thai-
 land, and in the Mideast there is in-
 creasing anxiety over weakening U.S. re-
 lations. '
 What have we gained from normaliza-
 tion of relations with the People's Re-
 public of China? The loss of a friend. In
 February 1972, when Richard M. Nixon
 and Chou En-lai issued their Joint com-
 munique in Shanghai, I voiced an objec-

 cinch 13, 197, Approved For Release 2008/10/27: C A-RDP85-00003R000100050012-9
 tion. The meaning of the communique
 was ambiguous but the United States
 certainly made no commitment to sever
 diplomatic relations with the Republic of
 and to abrogate the mutual defense
 treaty. The Republic of China has faith-
 fully fulfilled its obligations under the
 treaty and the treaty is essential to the
 security of the Republic of China. Nul-
 lifying this treaty will surely encourage
 the Chinese Communists to improve
 their armed forces to challenge the Re-
 public of China. They will surely use
 political pressure to isolate Taiwan
 economically.
 It is with shame and disgust that I
 'lsten to the Members of this House seri-
 ously consider passage of H.R. 2479 with-
 out the amendment offered by Mr.
 QUAY]L13 to provide that the dealings of
 the United States with Taiwan be con-
 ducted through an official U.S. liaison
 office on Taiwan and that a similar Tai-
 wanese liaison office be established in the
 United States thus granting privileges
 and  immunities  similar  to  those
 extended to diplomatic missions and
 personnel of accredited foreign govern-
 ments.  And  without  accepting              Mr.
 QuaYI.z's amendment to the declaration
 of principles stating that any armed
 attack or use of force, boycott, or em-
 bargo to prevent Taiwan from engag-
 ing in trade with other nations would be
 a threat to the peace and stability of the
 Western Pacific and to the security
 Interest of the United States-and with-
 out accepting Mr. DERWINSBI's amend-
 ment that the United States shall use its
 voice and vote in international institu-
 tions and organizations to protect the
 status of Taiwan as ' a member of all
 international organizations and institu-
 tions of which it was a member as of
 December 31, 1978 and all international
 agreements to which it was a party as
 of the same date, and to oppose any
 sanctions, especially a trade boycott by
 the People's Republic of China against
 Taiwan and to procure privileges and
 immunities for U.S. personnel on Taiwan
 an a reciprocal basis to those enjoyed by
 Taiwanese  personnel  in  the  United
 States.
 What have we gained from normaliza-
 tion       of relations with  the         People's
 Republic of China? A loss of prestige and
 credibility in the free world. The United
 States has hastily agreed to normalize
 relations with the People's Republic of
 China without considering the full con-
 -sequences this will have on our relations
 with Taiwan and without proving that
 there will be real benefits to offset the
 feeling that we have deserted a loyal
 e:1ly.O
 0 Mr. DUNCAN of Oregon. Mr. Chair-
 man, on December 15, at the time the
 relationship of this country with the
 Republic of China was changed, I issued
 a statement in which I said :
 I believe myself to be a pragmatic poli-
 tician, but I am not a cynic.
 I believe political abandonment of Taiwan
 can be justified only for geopolitical consid-
 cratlons of the highest magnitude. While I
 have not been briefed, I see no such.
 Certainly  increased  trade  with  China
 would come without this step because China
 seeds trade and if not, I would not sell my
 loyalty to cur tr2mvz and allies ?2 many
 years-rallies who wem fighting fascism In
 Asia years before Pearl Harbor for a mess of
 pottage.
 I believe recognition on these terms could
 have been achieved long ago. I see no express
 protection against the use of force by China
 against Taiwan. I see only the termination
 of the U.S. Taiwanese treaty. What did we get
 out of the deal that our present relation-
 ship doesn't give us?
 To say we can't ignore the presence of
 the most populous nation on earth is be-
 side the point. We don't. We haven't. We
 couldn't. We couldn't ignore the civil war
 they fought during the war against Japan.
 We couldn't ignore their armies attacking
 us in Korea and the threat they posed to our
 forces in Vietnam. While Taiwan was sup-
 porting the United States and steadily mov-
 ing their people to greater political freedom
 and participation, expanding their economy
 and raising  their standard of living and
 human rights of their people, the People's
 Republic has swung violently through re-
 pression and banishment and only now is
 permitting or encouraging questioning post-
 ers which come and go as if on command.
 While there may be greater human rights
 than those of individuals involved here, it
 is not apparent to me what those are. They
 may be to those more cynical, or pragmatic
 than I.
 It isn't formal recognition that I object to,
 but the high price we are forced to pay.
 Nothing has occurred in the interim
 to subs a tially change my initial reac-
 tion ;,o this policy decision. It is true that
 the Vice Premier has visited this country.
 It is also true that the Chinese army in
 vaded Vietnam immediately upon his
 return.
 On December 15, my reaction was one
 of dismay. It was, and is, my belief that
 the controversy which has ensued over
 the President's decision arises not so
 much because of the extension of full
 diplomatic relations to Peking, but from
 the manner and the terms on which the
 decision was made-that is, the failure
 to advise and consult with the Congress
 and the failure to adequately provide for
 a continued American commitment to
 the people on Taiwan.
 I have reservations concerning the
 "rationality" and "realism" said to un-
 lie the President's action. Honor, credi-
 bility,                                               and  morality  (unfashionable
 words these days) may be intangible
 qualities, but they have real effects in
 the real world. Granted the basic ra-
 tionality of having regular diplomatic
 relations with a nation comprising one-
 quarter of the human race, there is no
 certainty that Chinese-American friend-
 ship is here to stay. In accepting Peking's
 three prime conditions, the normaliza-
 tion of relations was acknowledgement,
 said President Carter, of "simple reality."
 Yet the past history of Chinese-Ameri-
 can relations has been far from simple,
 and it is my hope that the present
 euphoria  which  persists  after  Teng
 Tsiaoping's visit will not keep us from
 seeing some of the problems which lie
 ahead.
 It is true, furthermore, that treaty-
 breaking carried to extremes can de-
 stroy the legal basis upon which sover-
 eign states must deal with each other.
 Many have raised the critical concern
 that this decision has eroded and under-
 mined our credibility with the people of
 1285
 Taiwan and amongst our allies in other
 parts of the globe.
 But the question here today is not
 what should have been done. We must
 cope with the world as it exists-with
 the fact of a dramatic change in our
 relations in the Western Pacific which
 has already occurred. Our job is to sal-
 vage what we can of our relationship
 with Taiwan and to do so without creat-
 ing other and more dangerous problems
 in the process-and to pass a bill which
 will not be vetoed.
 Under these circumstances I think the
 committee has done a workmanlike job.
 It would be better to have retained diplo-
 matic relations. It would have been bet-
 ter to have a liaison office, but not at
 the expense of further compounding our
 problems. I, therefore, support and will
 vote for the bill.
 I must say, however, that I do not
 understand the administration's initial
 handling of even this low-grade unof-
 ficial relationship with Taiwan. Prior to
 the President's action, the Republic of
 China had 13 consulates. They were use-
 ful, not just to Taiwan but to this coun-
 try and our citizens. The administration
 has imposed a limit of eight offices of
 the Coordinating Committee for North
 American Affairs-the unofficial entity
 through which we will deal with Taiwan.
 I believe this to be arbitrary and unwise.
 Taiwan represents one of the most
 advanced economies in Asia, and an im-
 portant trading partner for the United
 States. Fortunately, Taiwan's leaders
 have already demonstrated the ability
 to sustain and restructure the island's
 economic, cultural, and educational rela-
 tions with many nations, notably Japan,
 in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.
 Much of the necessary liaison work
 and documentation which makes this
 trade possible has been' carried  on
 through consular offices. The mainte-
 ndnce of consulates is now impossible,
 but I cannot accept the administration's
 position of objecting to the reestablish-
 ment of an equal number of nongovern-
 ment bodies-including an important
 one in Portland. It is my belief that we
 should encourage the people on Taiwan
 to promote, rather than curtail their
 trading with the United States, and I
 will continue to seek a replacement for
 the office in Portland.
 One of every nine employment 0p-.
 portunities in the State of Oregon is di-
 rectly or indirectly the result of our
 trade. Oregon is one of the few States
 in this Nation which can boast an ex-
 port surplus. Traditionally, Taiwan has
 been one of Oregon's top 10 trading
 partners. The trade between us in wheat,
 electronics,  electrical switching gear,
 and a host of other merchandise was
 facilitated by the existence of a consular
 office in the city of Portland.
 Therefore, the loss of this office would
 present more than just an inconveni-
 ence to Oregon business. Trade Pat-
 terns-both within this country and in
 international markets-tends to follow
 the path of least resistance. It seems to
 me that the existing patterns are fragile
 enough without unilaterally taking an
 action which would endanger this rela-
 tionship.  I see no reason for any

 limitation on the number of offices which
 should be maintained on this unofficial
 basis.
 Therefore, I was pleased to support
 the amendment offered by my colleagues
 from Idaho, Mr. SYMMs, which directed
 the President to reach an agreement
 with Taiwan to assure that the facili-
 ties used to conduct its affairs in the
 United States be at or near the loca-
 tions of the consular establishments of
 Taiwan existing prior to December 31,
 1978. This amendment, while it does not
 guarantee that the Taiwanese will re-
 open the Portland office, does give them-
 and us-that opportunity. I hope the
 conference retains this provision.
 ? Mr. DANNEMEYER. Mr. Chairman,
 very soon the Members of this House
 will be voting on final passage of a bill
 which will establish a new framework
 for relations between the United States
 and Taiwan. In so doing, we will bear a
 tremendous responsibility for the con-
 tinued freedom and well-being of a na-
 tion which over many years has been
 tied to the United States by bonds of
 friendship, commerce, and philosophy.
 It is disturbing to me, and to many
 other Members of this body, that our
 Government should have conceded so
 much to the government in Peking, and
 yet has received so little in return. It is
 disturbing that we should have recog-
 nized the "reality" of Communist rule
 on mainland China, but now totally re-
 fuse to recognize the reality of an ef-
 ficient, productive, and well-ruled state
 which has existed on Taiwan for over
 30 years. It is even more disturbing that
 we have chosen, in a flight of wishful
 thinking, to unquestioningly assume that
 Peking will not use force or coercion
 against Taiwan in the future, when even
 Peking's leadership insists that force re-
 mains an option. The current Chinese
 invasion of Vietnam should give us all
 pause in this respect. It now appears
 clear that Peking wished to have the
 United States at its back before launch-
 ing its Vietnam adventure. And now that
 we have developed such a close relation-
 ship with Peking, what influence have
 we gained with our new quasi-allies? If
 China's Vietnam gambit is any indica-
 tion, the answer clearly is none. In any
 event, the Chinese invasion of Vietnam,
 coming as it does so closely on the heels
 of normalization, must raise doubts
 among serious observers about the wis-
 dom of blindly assuming the People's
 Republic's peaceful intentions toward
 Taiwan. This suggests to me the need for
 a strong security commitment to Taiwan
 in our pending bill on China.
 A recent article in the Washington
 Post by a distinguished scholar and prac-
 titioner of U.S. China policy, Eugene K.
 Lawson, helps to clarify many of the
 outstanding issues regarding Taiwan,
 our negotiations with the People's Re-
 public, and our future responsibilities in
 the area of China. I urge it to the Mem-
 bers' attention, and include it in the
 RECORD:
 TAIWAN: WE FORGOT WHO HELD THE TRUMP
 CARDS
 (By Eugene K. Lawson)
 1979 is the year of the Ram, and Taiwan
 just got gored-needlessly.
 It didn't have to be that way. It has been  the door open on its ultimate status, in the
 six years. since the Shanghai communique    same way Japan, Canada, the United King-
 was drafted, which laid the basis 4pr an                                                                         dom and others have done.

 to be worked out. On the Issue of Taiwan, the Ronald Reagan's challenge to Gerald Ford
 United States gave nothing away. The opera- prevented the latter from normalizing rela-
 tive language said we acknowledge that "all
 Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait
 maintain there Is but one China .and that
 Taiwan is a part of China. The U.S. govern-
 ment does not challenge that position." The
 statement, written by weary U.S. negotiators
 in the middle of the night in Shanghai, was
 not bad. It was sufficiently ambiguous to sat-
 isfy the U.S. desire to keep the ultimate reso-
 lution of Taiwan's status still open, and it
 satisfied Peking's need for a face-saving ges-
 ture from us on that issue.
 But the key passages in the Shanghai com-
 munique were the anti-hegemony clauses
 aimed at the Soviet, Peking was willing to lay
 aside Taiwan with almost no concession by
 us in return for our help against Moscow.
 Peking saw Taiwan as a minor irritant com-
 pared with the Soviet danger. Subsequently,
 U.S.-P.R.C. ties developed quickly despite the
 Taiwan Issue. Taiwan was the "Panama
 Canal" of Chinese policies, "forgotten except
 as a banner with which to rally the factional
 faithful during leadership contests." A year
 later the lessening importance of Taiwan was
 underscored when Peking agreed to open a
 liaison office a few blocks from the Republic
 of China's embassy.
 In retrospect, our China policy after 1973
 was probably flawed. We were so sure that we
 could make a deal with Peking that would
 preserve Taiwan's security that we began to
 cover our domestic flank from a right-wing
 attack by strengthening our ties with Tai-
 wan, thus making it more agonizing than
 necessary when the inevitable break came.
 We increased the number of Taipei's con-
 sulates, sold more sophisticated weaponry
 than ever before, appointed a senior diplomat
 as ambassador and promised prior consulta-
 tion before making any future major moves.
 Instead, we should have smoothed the road
 to normalization by systematically reducing
 our ties to Taiwan and giving it time to
 adjust. We should have reduced our embassy
 to the charge level, withdrawn all our troops
 (this would have psychologically prepared
 Taiwan better than anything else we could
 have done) and discussed with the Congress
 the most effective means of replacing the
 mutual defense treaty.
 .  The defense treaty was, of course, the bot-
 tom line, and of Peking's three demands
 (break  diplomatic relations  with  Taiwan,
 withdraw our military and end the treaty),
 that is the one we should have worked on.
 And, in fact, the Nixon administration did
 have a package of minimum conditions in
 its mind to implement.
 The most important element in the Nixon
 plan included the ways and means to find a
 plausible substitute for the treaty. First, the
 United States would cite only those People's
 Republic statements that spoke of resolving
 the situation peacefully and ignore the more
 belligerent ones. Second, the president would
 issue with the Congress a statement after
 normalization with Peking was achieved that
 any use of force by anyone in the Taiwan
 Straits would cause the United States to
 consider whatever military actions appeared
 necessary to preserve peace.
 Moreover, we would continue to ensure
 that the international waters existing be-
 tween the mainland and Taiwan would be
 open to all countries, and, finally, we would
 continue to sell defensive equipment to Tai-
 wan. Our assumption was that we were in
 the driver's seat, and Peking needed us more
 than we needed it. While Peking had its
 conditions for normalization, we had ours.
 As for the future of Taiwan, we would fol-
 low the Shanghai communique by keeping
 tions. Then the proponents of a born-again
 foreign policy came in. The first policy ac-
 tions about East Asia and China were not
 reassuring:  a proposed rapid withdrawal
 from South Korea, a plan to give up' U.S.
 bases in the Philippines, a disastrous visit to
 Peking by the secretary of state, which was
 denounced immediately after by Vice Premier
 Teng Hsiao-ping. The lack of effective con-
 sultation with Congress was apparent early
 on, and a new harder line by Peking began.
 Instead of limiting itself to Its original
 three conditions, Peking sensed the weak-
 ness in our leadership and very shrewdly
 began to escalate its demands. First, Teng
 would tell visiting congressmen that PekiI g
 could not accept a unilateral U.S. declaration
 about Taiwan's security. Next, Chairman
 Hua Kuo-feng would inform a U.S; trade
 delegation that continued U.S. arms sales to
 Taiwan after normalization would not be
 allowed.
 Somehow, somewhere, the corporate mem-
 ory about our China policy failed. We forgot
 that we held most of the trump cards and
 that we could obtain both the kind of agree-
 ment needed to preserve Taiwan's security
 and yet proceed in a more important rela-
 tionship with Peking. When we overcome one
 of Peking's new demands (that we end arms
 sales to Taiwan), we took that for a great
 concession, again forgetting that Peking at
 first had only three conditions. In spite of
 the fact that we enjoy more leverage and
 influence over Peking now than in 1972, we
 obtaind no concessions from Peking and gave
 Taiwan precious little security. The presi-
 dent's statement that the United States con-
 tinues to have an interest in the peaceful
 resolution of the Taiwan issue" is woefully
 inadequate. The failure to consult with key
 members of Congress about the conditions of
 normalization leaves that body of individuals
 in a rebellious mood when both branches
 should be united in their views. Failure to
 give early warning to Taiwan and the Con-
 gress leaves us scurrying around to find a
 solution to (among many others) our nuclear
 sharing agreement with Taipei.
 And most unaccountably of all, the ad-
 ministration tried hard to close the door on
 Taiwan's ultimate status by stating that
 Taiwan is part of China. The enormous dif-
 ference between President Carter's statement
 and the language contained in the Shanghai
 communique seems lost to National Security
 Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. In his press
 backgrounders, he cited the Shanghai com-
 munique as the foundation for this agree-
 ment. He simply has misread it. None of our
 major allies had to make that concession.
 Taiwan is obviously not under the de facto
 control of the mainland, and to say that it,
 is part- of China, de jure or otherwise, is a
 gratuitous concession to Peking, and deprives'
 us of leverage we might need later.
 The statement by Secretary of State Cyrus
 Vance that it "doesn't make any sense" for
 the People's Republic to opt for a violent so-
 lution is, unfortunately, just an opinion.
 This group of leaders in Peking may put Tai-
 wan on the back burner, but a different group
 might not. The leadership coalition is hardly
 stable (Teng is 74), and the costs of a West-
 ern style modernization to China may create
 a domestic, xenophobic backlash, as it has so
 often in the past, and produce a more reac-
 tionary leadership. We obviously cannot rely
 on good sense in Peking for Taiwan's security.
 As happened so often in the past two years,
 the professionals are yet again picking up the
 pieces. Taiwan will no doubt forgive us our
 clumsiness and inexcusable speed If we
 quickly get Congress to maintain some 59

 treaties we have with the island and issue

 the whole exercise is depressing. Once again,
 this administration has proved itself inept,
 taking a problem already mostly solved and
 turning a small success into a small fiasco.?
 0 Mr. ANDERSON of California. Mr.
 Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2479,
 a bill assuring the continuation of U.S.
 relations with Taiwan. New relations
 with the People's Republic of China
 have already been established. This leg-
 islation we are considering today does
 not address that. For really, there is lit-
 tle this body is empowered to do with
 respect to the Executive actions revising
 'United States-China policy.
 What we must do now, those of us
 concerned with the future of Taiwan,
 is act to guarantee the viability of an
 Independent people there. H.R. 2479 does
 assure that this viability will be main-
 tained.
 The legislation states that continued
 close and friendly relations between the
 people of the United States and Tai-
 wan must be assured. And it recognizes
 the fact that an armed attack against
 Taiwan would constitute a threat to
 the peace and stability of the Western
 Pacific. This continued peace and sta-
 bility, according to logic and H.R. 2479,,
 is in the political, security, and economic
 interests of the United States.
 The legislation before us today states
 clearly that the United States will make
 available to Taiwan articles and serv-
 ices necessary for its defense against
 armed attack.
 H.R. 2479 assures that all agreements
 entered into between the nations of Tai-
 wan and the United States will be con-
 tinued as if the derecognition had not
 occurred. Taiwan will still be a most-
 favored-nation for trade purposes, and
 will continue to be eligible for Export-
 Import Bank loans and other U.S. Gov-
 ernment programs and forms of aid.
 Finally, this legislation allows the es-
 tablishment of a nongovernmental en-
 tity for the continuation of relations
 with Taiwan in the future.
 Clearly; the primary theme of H.R.
 2479 can be seen as one of continuity
 in a time. of change. It was Executive
 policy that altered the structure of our
 past  relationships. The House today
 must act to minimize any negative ef-
 fect these new relationships might have
 on the longstanding friendship that ex-
 ists between the United States and Tai-
 wan. The mutual interests of the people
 of these two lands have not been changed
 'by derecognition. It is these mutual in-
 terests that must serve as the basis of
 our continued friendship: The passage
 of H.R. 2479 will help assure the main-
 tenance of commercial, cultural, and
 touristic relations between us. With
 these continued relations, and with the
 sfle of defense weapons, we can work
 to see that the basic situation in Taiwan
 will go unchanged. This situation is one
 of freedom for the people who live
 there, and the security of American in-
 terests in the Western Pacific.o
 vents $37 Million in proposed cuts in
 esential health education programs.
 Offered by Mr. STAGGERS-the chair-
 man of the committee responsible for
 atuhorizations for these programs-the
 amendment restores $17,046,000 for ad-
 vanced nurse training programs and $20
 million for the capitation grant program
 which provides financial support for
 medical, dental, and osteopathic schools.
 The severe funding slash represented
 by H.R. 2439 is unconscionable in the
 middle of the fiscal year. Both the af-
 fected programs were originally slated
 for modest extensions. Both programs
 were funded at a reasonable level by the
 previous Congress.
 The Nurse Training Act was passed by
 a vote last year in the House of 393-12,
 but it was pocket-vetoed by the Presi-
 dent. The President then agreed; how-
 ever, to support a continuing resolution
 which preserved this vital program.
 Over 50 national health organizations
 and related groups have spoken out in
 opposition to the proposed rescission.
 Among these groups are the Association
 of New York Neighborhood Health Cen-
 ters, the Mental Health Association, and
 Planned  Parenthood  Federation  of
 America.
 The chairman of the Health Subcom-
 mittee, Mr. WAxMAN, has noted that this
 budget rescission would result in the
 abrupt termination of 33 research proj-
 ects and scholarships for 3,500.nursing
 students, most of whom are from low-in-
 come families.
 I would like to point out to those of
 my colleagues. who support the budget
 rescission as a step toward balancing the
 budget that this $37 million cut would
 in fact be an illusory savings. Decent
 health care for Americans, which these
 programs help insure, will save the Gov-
 ernment and taxpayers money in the
 long run. We should not seek to econo-
 mize at the expense of our constituents'
 health.
 Health education institutions and pro-
 gram  administrators  have  already
 planned for fiscal 1979 on the assumption
 that the funding level approved and
 promised them by both the President and
 Congress would in fact be delivered. They
 have rightly assumed that our commit-
 ments would be honored. We cannot now
 turn. away from this pledge.e

 There being none, under the rule, the

 Accordingly the Committee rose; and

 close, and friendly relations between the
 people of the United States and the peo-

 the House with sundry amendments
 adopted by the Committee of the Whole.

 The bill was ordered to be engrossed
 and read a third time, and was read the
 third time.
 MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY
 MR. DERWINSHI
 Mr. DERWINSKL Mr. Speaker, I offer
 a motion to recommit.
 The SPEAKER. Is the gentleman op-

 Mr. DERWINSKI. I am, in its present
 form, Mr. Speaker.
 The SPEAKER. The Clerk will report
 the motion to recommit.
 The Clerk read as follows:
 Mr. DERwrNsxI moves to recommit the bill,
 H.R. 2479, to the Committee on Foreign Af-
 fairs with instructions to report the bill back
 to the House forthwith with the following
 amendment: On page 10, immediately after
 line 4. Insert the following new section, and
 redesignate the succeeding sections accord-
 ingly:
 "REAFFIRM TION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
 "SEC. 205. Nothing contained in this Act
 shall contravene the President's stated pol-
 icies and positive interest in human rights,
 especially with respect to those human rights
 of the approximately 18 million inhabitants
 of Taiwan. The preservation of the human
 rights of the people of Taiwan is hereby re-
 affirmed as a commitment of the United
 States."
 The SPEAKER. The gentleman from
 Illinois (Mr. DERwINSKT) is recognized
 for 5 minutes in support of his motion
 to recommit.
 (Mr. DERWINSKI asked and was
 given permission to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Speaker, due to
 the lateness of the hour, I will not take
 5 minutes; I hope to confine my remarks
 to 1 minute.
 I will point out, Mr. Speaker, that at
 least since the era just preceding World
 War II, bipartisanship has been a great
 American factor in the conduct of for-
 eign affairs. I, for one, have great re-
 spect for the President's emphasis on
 human rights. I sometimes wonder if the
 advice he receives from subordinates in
 the executive branch is as sound and ac-
 curate as it should be, but the President
 himself is a man of great character and
 strength, and his human rights policy
 comes from the heart.
 It is in support of that, recognizing
 that it is the fundamental conviction of
 the American people that nothing con-
 tained in our readjusted China policy
 should deprive the people on Taiwan of
 their human rights, that I offer this mo-
 tion to recommit, realizing it is a re-
 affirmation of public policy and govern-
 mental policy, as well as the strong con-
 victions of the Members of this body.
 Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
 of my time.
 The SPEAKER. The gentleman from
 Wisconsin (Mr. ZABLOCKI) is recognized
 for 5 minutes.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise
 not in opposition to the motion to re-
 commit with instructions, but I do want
