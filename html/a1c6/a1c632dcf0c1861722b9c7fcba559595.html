 Vietnamese communist media dismiss President Nixon's 8 May press
 conference as an unsuccessful attempt to cope with the protests of
 students and others in the United States over the "overt aggression"
 against Cambodia and the expansion of the Vietnam war to the whole
 of Indochina.  Propagandists continue to obscure the President's
 statement that the aim of the U.S. and GVN operations is to clear
 out Vietnamese communist sanctuaries in Cambodia; the allied action
 is pictured as directed against the Cambodian "patriots."  On
 11 May the DRV Ilureign Ministry protests the naval operation up the
 Mekong and says Western sources have revealed that "the Saigon
 puppet administration, o.,,TJ.S. orders, plans to use its navy to
 blockade the Cambodian coast : . . ."
 The "Royal National Union Government," announced by Sihanouk on
 5 May, has now been recognized by 16 governments, including the
 PRC and six other communist countries.  But only Romania of the
 USSR's European allies has extended recognition, and Kosygin
 pointedly fails to mention the new government in a message,
 carried by Soviet media on the 12th, which greets the "united
 front of Cambodia," the "united front of the people of Indochina,"
 and the struggle of the "patriotic forces of Cambodia."  Peking
 gives unprecedented publicity to Cambodian developments--70 percent
 of total comment.  More than a quarter of the items on Cambodia
 concern the new government, and on the 12th NCNA carries a Burmese
 CP statement which says that the Soviets "have not dared up to now"
 to recognize it.
 High-level Moscow and Peking consultations with the Vietnamese are
 now publicized with the reports that First Secretary Le Duan had talks
 with Brezhnev on the 8th and with Chou En-lai on the 11th, the same
 day Le Duan was received by Mao and Lin Piao.  There are continued
 attacks in Peking propaganda on alleged Soviet "collusion" with the
 United States, and Moscow continues its propaganda attacks on the PRC
 for failing to join in "united action" in regard to Indochina.  Hanoi
 takes its consistent public stance in playing up support from both
 countries.  A NHAN DAN editorial ~n 13 May says statements issued in
 the USSR, PRC, and other fraternal socialist countries "have laid
 stress on their resolve to take resolute actions, on the pressing need
 for strengthening the unity of all socialist, anti-imperialist
 and peace forces in order to stay the hands of the U.S. imperialist
 aggressors . . . ."
 PRESIDENT NIXON'S PRESS CONFERENCE, ANTIWAR DEMONSTRATIONS
 HANOI AND     VNA observed on 9 May that the President called his press
 THE FRONT     conference at a time when the United States "has entered
 a political crisis graver than any under the Johnson
 Administration" and that the meeting with the press "was intentionally

 J.3 MAY 1970
 Front propaganda on the press conference uniformly  includes references
 to the recent student demonstrations, particularly the death of the four
 students at Kent University.  A QUAN DOI NHAN DAN article on the 11th
 sees evidence of Ln effort by the President to "deplete" the Washington
 demonstration in his early morning visit with students at the Lincoln
 Memorial on the 9th, as well as in his earlier invitation to students
 for "private: contacts."
 The QIJAN DOT NHAN DAN article repeats a 10 May VNA report of the
 demonstration in claiming that 200,000 people attended.  It adds
 that many Republican and Democratic congressmen have participated
 in the "struggle."  The article, like a Hanoi radio broadcast on the
 loth, says that 250 State Department employees sent a letter to
 the Secretary--an "unprecedented" occurrence in the Department.
 Earlier, Hanoi media had publicized messages to U.S. organizations
 extending wishes for success of the planned demonstrations.  They
 included messages to the Students Mobilization Committee and Students
 for a Democratic Society from the Vietnam Students Union, the
 Committee for Solidarity with the American People, and the Liberation
 Student Union. A VNA item reports that the Solidarity Committee and
 Students Union held a meeting in Hanoi on Lhe 8th to protest the U.S.
 "invasion" of Cambodia and to welcome the U.S. protest movement.
 The 9 May VNA report of the President's press conference sees the
 "anxiety and discontent of broad sections" reflected in the fact that
 24 out of 27 questions were about Cambodia and Vietnam, but this and
 other Vietnamese communist propaganda ignores much of the substance of
 the press conference.  VNA says all the President's efforts and
 activities since his inauguration have been aimed at winning a military
 victory and bringing Vietnam and Indochina under U.S. sway.  This
 contention appears in other propaganda, including a 9 May statement
 by the DRV press spokesman in Paris reported by Hanoi media on the 11th.
 The President's remarks on a withdrawal from Cambodia by the end
 of June are noted disparagingly.  The ZTNA report says that to deal
 with "embarrassing questions" on a pullout he "had to mention
 30 June as a time limit," and it views his remark that some U.S.
 forces would be withdrawn within a week as "an immediate step to
 soothe public opinion."  VNA also contrasts the President's
 statements with the reported remark by ARVN 3d corps commander
 Gen. Do Cao Tri that "the occupation of Cambodia would be indefinite."
 A Hanoi radio broadcast, also on the 9th, dismisses the promise
 that U.S. forces would be withdrawn by the end of June with the
 observation that "indeed U.S. troops would be forced to return to
 South Vietnam because in July, with the onset of the rainy season,
 they would be bogged down if they remained."

 CONFIDENTIAL              FBIS TRENDS
 13 MAY 1970
 The general tone of the comment is typified by the 9 May Hanoi
 braodcast's claim that the President's explanation of his Indochina
 policies and his statement that the antiwar protesters' objectives
 are similar to his own amount to the same "crafty arguments" he
 used in his 30 April speech and represent "the extreme limit of
 lying and scorn for public opinion."  An LPA Commentator article,
 carried by Liberation Radio on the 10th, says "Nixon talked
 nonsense because he had run out of reason" and asks:  "Can
 anyone believe that the U.S. aggressive operations in Cambodia and the
 American people's antiwar demonstrations have the same objectives?"
 A NHAN DAN commentary on the 11th, as summarized by VNA the same
 day, observes that unlike his 30 April address the President's
 latest remarks acknowledge the "intensity of the protest movement
 in the United States."  But the paper says "Nixon remains as
 bellicose and adamant as ever, and because he tried to justify the
 unjustifiable, his contentions are full of sophisms, lies, and
 stupidities."  VNA. also briefly reviews an 11 May QUAN DOT NHAN DAN
 article which questions the President's rationale for the Cambodian
 operations--that the Vietnamization program was threatened.
 Pointing out that in his 20 April speech announcing another troop
 withdrawal the President had said the program was progressing, the
 paper says "Nixon has proved to be the biggest double-crosser, a
 most pernicious opponent of the righteous demands of the American
 people."
 Hanoi's failure to acknowledge the substance of President Nixon's
 remarks is illustrated by the radio broadcast on the 9th.  It says
 cryptically that the President claimed that even after the
 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Cambodia, the United States
 "would pay attention to the future and neutrality of Cambodia and
 Laos."  It then proceeds to cite examples of U.S. "aggression"
 which give the lie to professions of respect for neutrality,
 and it totally ignores the context of the exchange--the fact that
 the President, responding to a question on policy toward Cambodia,
 observed that it was necessary to use diplomacy regarding the
 neutrality of small coi-aitries which are unable to defend themselves
 and that the United States is  exploring this problem with the
 USSR, Britain, and the Asian countries which are to meet in Djakarta.
 Hanoi also ignored the President's references to pursuing
 negotiations in forums other than the Paris talks and his statement
 that he wc'ild deliver a report to the nation upon the conclusion
 of the Cambodian operation.  Vietnamese communist comment also
 failed to note that the President was asked specifically about
 Paris; however, the PRG Paris spokesman's statement--also made on

 the 9th and carried by communist media on the llth--did reiterate
 the line that "it is obvious the Nixon Administration is continuing
 to prevent all progress at the Paris conference . . . while creating
 an extremely serious situation in Indochina and Southeast Asia,"
 MOSCOW     Moscow has given the press conference minimal attention.
 The initial TASS report on the 9th observes that it was
 "mainly devoted to the armed intrusion of U.S. troops into neutral
 Cambodia" and that the President used old arguments in an attempt
 to "dampen the powerful wave" of protests at home and abroad.  TASS
 says the President supported Secretary Laird's "recent belligerent
 statement" that the United States may resume bombing of the DRV and
 warned that "large and more effective forces" may be used against the
 North, but TASS does not acknowledge that the President made these
 actions conditional on a DRV troop movement across the DMZ.  A radio
 commentary in English to the United Kingdom on the 9th expresses
 skepticism about the President's promise that withdrawal from
 Cambodia will. begin next week and be completed by the end of June.
 TASS carries numerous reports on the U.S. antiwar demonstrations and
 notes that Dr. Spock, Mrs. Coretta King, and Senator Brooke were on
 the speakers' platform at the 9 May rally in Washington.  It also
 takes note of protest by such figures as UAW leader Walter Reuther,
 Mayor Lindsay, and Yale President Kingman Brewster, as well as the
 petition to the Secretary of State from Department employees; there
 is publicity for a message from the Student Councils of the USSR
 and of various Soviet cities to the National Student Association
 expressing support for the 9 May Washington demonstration.  On the
 12th TASS notes the vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
 on the amendment to the foreign military sales bill cutting off funds
 for U.S. forces in Cambodia.
 PEKING     The only available PRC acknowledgment of President Nixon's
 press conference comes in an 11 May NCNA report of the
 antiwar demonstrations.  NCNA says the President "hastily held a
 press conference" on the eve of the Washington rally, again using
 "deceptive tactics" to appease the anger of the American people.
 NCNA carries numerous reports on the demonstrations, mentioning the
 "mammoth" demonstration of some 100,000 people in Washington and
 describing rallies at colleges and universities throughout the
 country.  A PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article, carried by NCNA
 on the 9th, scores the Nixon Administration's "persecution" of
 the American students, pointing to the deaths of the Kent State
 students and the stationing of "fully armed troops and police"
 at various universities.  The Administration aims its guns at the

 American people as well as the people of Indochina, Commentator
 says, but he states that such suppression will only intensify the
 protest movement.
 On 7 May NCNA and Peking radio's English-language broadcasts carried
 a cable from Penn Nouth, Prime Minister of the "Royal Government of
 National Union," to Senator Mansfield recalling the Senator':;
 past friendship for Cambodia and asking him to use his influence
 to make the American people understand that they are being "dragged
 by their President" into a spreading war.  The message also thanks
 Mansfield and his congressional colleagues for their stand against
 the President's decision.
 RECOGNITION OF "ROYAL NATIONAL UNION GOVERNMENT" OF CAMBODIA
 Sihanouk's new "Royal National Union Government" to date has been
 recognized by 16 governments, including seven communist regimes.
 But the USSR so far has withheld recognition, as have all of its
 East European allies except Romania.*  On 12 May TASS released the
 undated Kosygin message to Sihanouk which "greets" the formation
 of "the united front of Cambodia, the strengthening of the united
 anti-imperialist front of the peoples of Indochina, and also the
 measures taken to organize the struggle of the patriotic forces of
 Cambodia against the American aggression."  Kosygin fails to mention
 Sihanouk's titles, addressing him only as "esteemed Samdech."
 Paris AFP reports on the 12th that Sihanouk "immediately" answered
 Kosygin's telegram, thanking him for his support but formally
 requesting official Soviet recognition of the new government.
 Communist media are not known thus far to have mentioned Sihanouk's
 response, but NCNA publicizes a "special message" from Sihanouk to
 the Cambodian liberation armed forces on the 12th in which he
 notes that a "great number" of countries have already broken with
 the Lon Nol regime and adds that "in the future only the countries
 subservient to or friendly with the United States will maintain or
 establish their embassies in Phnom Penh."
 *  The other communist countries are the PRC, DRV, Albania, Cuba,
 North Korea, and Yugoslavia, as well as South Vietnam's PRG.
 Noncommunist countries known to have extended recognition are
 Syria, Iraq, Algeria, Congo (B), Mauritania, South Yemen, Sudan,
 and the UAR.

 13 MAY 1970
 Also on the 12th, NCNA carries a 10 May statement by the Burmese
 Communist Party, scoring U.S. "aggression" in Cambodia, which
 includes an attack on the Soviets:  the "Soviet revisionist clique,
 though compelled to issue a statement containing pretentious
 denunciation, dares not denounce the counterrevolutionary
 Lon Nol-Sirik Matak clique by name, and has not dared up to now
 to recognize the Royal Government of National Union."
 PEKING AND     Peking seized on Belgrade's condemnation of the
 BELGRADE        U.S. Cambodian action and prompt recognition of the
 Sihanouk government on 6 May, the day after its
 formation was announced.  On the 8th NCNA carried a Belgrade-datelined
 item--highly  unusual for Peking--publicizing Tito's message to
 Sihanouk and citing BORBA for an account of the Yugoslav Federal
 Executive Council session which decided to recognize the Sihanouk
 government-in-exile.  The same item summarized an Executive Council
 communique condemning "U.S. open military intervention in Cambodia
 and the resumption of bombing of the DRV."  Yugoslavia's reaction to
 the U.S. actions has been notably vehement, with Tito denouncing the
 American move in two speeches, seconded by other leading figures and
 by articles in BORBA and other Yugoslav media.  TANYUG has recounted
 angry popular protests.
 DIPLOMATIC   The PRC is the only country thus far to have accepted an
 PERSONNEL    ambassador from the government-in-exile, NCNA reporting
 on 9 May that the PRC Government had agreed to the
 appointment of Ker Meas.  On the 9th NCNA scored the Phnom Penh
 authorities for holding Chinese diplomatic personnel "hostages" until
 the return home from Peking of the Cambodian diplomats representing
 Lon Nol's government.  Pyongyang's KCNA carried an "authorized
 statement" on the same day denouncing Phnom Penh for similarly
 holding North Korea's diplomats.
 Hanoi media on the 13th carried a DRV Foreign Ministry statement
 recalling that on 25 March the DRV Government had decided to "stop"
 the activities of the DRV Embassy and commercial representation
 and to bring home all personnel except for a number to guard the
 property.  The statement says the DRV has now decided that the stay
 of the latter personnel "is no longer necessary" and asks Phnom Penh
 to permit their departure.  A similar PRG Foreign Ministry statement
 was carried by Liberation Radio on the same day.
 FIRST SECRETARY LE DUAN REPORTED IN POLAND, USSR, PRC

 leaders "in a cordial and fraternal atmosphere."  TASS quoted
 the PAP report some four hours later on the 6th.*
 This was the first known reference in communist media. to Le Duan's
 whereabouts since Prague's CTK--as well as Western news agencies--
 reported on 30 April that he had left Moscow the day before for
 Peking.  Le Duan had arrived in Moscow on 18 April at the head
 of the DRV delegation to the Lenin anniversary observances.
 On 8 May TASS reported that Brezhnev received Le Duan in Moscow
 for talks on "questions connected with the intensification of the
 U.S. imperialist aggression against the peoples of Indochina" and
 about "some measures to strengthen further friendship and
 cooperation" between the two countries.  TASS said the conversation
 took place in an atmosphere of "brotherhood and cordiality."  VNA
 carried a similar report on the 9th, and on the same day TASS briefly
 reported that Le Duan had "left Moscow for home."
 On 10 May NCNA reported Le Duan's arrival that day in Peking for
 "a visit to China."  The next day NCNA said that he was received
 by Chou En-la? for"cordial and friendly talks" and that on the
 same day he v   accorded the honor of being received by Mao Tse-tung
 and Lin Piao,  NCNA noted on 12 May that Sihanouk had a "cordial and
 friendly" meeting with Le Duan that day, and later on the 12th
 NCNA said Le Duan had left for home "after concluding his visit to
 China."  VNA has reported the meetings with Chou, Mao and Lin, and
 Sihanouk.
 ISSUES OF INTERNATIONAL, ASIAN CONFERENCES ON INDOCHINA
 Some inconsistency on the issue of an international conference is
 displayed in Moscow propaganda following Kosygin's 4 May press
 conference remark that the "decisive word" rests with Cambodia,
 Vietnam, and Laos but that now seems the time not for meetings but
 for actions to stop U.S. "aggression."  TASS reported promptly
 on 6 May that Secretary General U Thant had made a statement on
 Indochina the day before.  TASS noted that Thant "urged the use of
 *  A message from VNA's home office in Hanoi to the Moscow office
 on 9 May asked for a report on Le Duan's visit to Poland.  A reply
 from VNA Moscow the same day said that there had been no public
 announcement when the delegation visited Poland but that there was
 authorization now to publicize the fact of the visit.  On the 11th
 Moscow VNA sent the Hanoi office a more detailed report of the visit
 with the caveat "check the following report before releasing it."

 all means to settle the Vietnam problem by peaceful talks," but
 it neglected to mention that he spoke of the French proposal on broad
 negotiations.  PRAVDA published the brief TASS report in full, but
 an IZVESTIYA item noted only that U Thant expressed "profound
 concern" over the U.S. escalation in Indochina and said nothing
 about talks of any kind.
 TASS on the 7th, reporting remarks by Polish Foreign Minister
 Jedrychowski at a luncheon given by the French Diplomatic Press
 Association in Paris, quoted him as saying Poland would not object
 to an enlarged conference on Indochina as proposed by France
 "provided a majority of countries agreed."  Bulgaria is the only
 other communist source known to have reported Jedrychowski's comments
 on a new  conference.  Moscow papers have carried no report of his
 remarks in Paris.  The Warsaw PAP account of the foreign minister's
 remarks does not mention an enlarged conference, and an account
 published in ZYCIE WARSZAWY on the 7th says only that "both countries
 are profoundly disturbed by the dangerous development of the conflict
 in Indochina and wish to do their best to restore peace there as
 soon as possible."
 On 11 May Soviet media commented negatively on the British stand on
 a Geneva conference.  A TASS commentary, attacking the British
 Government's failure to censure the U.S. intrusion into Cambodia,
 says that Britain "insists on its proposal to convene a new
 international conference on Indochina and to resume the activity
 of the neutral group of observers in Laos and Cambodia."  TASS
 calls it "ludicrous" to propose the convening of a new conference
 after the United States has "arrogantly violated" the 1954 Geneva
 agreement which serves as the basis for Cambodia's status.  A
 Moscow commentary broadcast in English to North America the same
 day says that the British Government, a Geneva conference
 cochairman, has tried to "camouflage" its support of the United
 States by suggesting another Geneva conference on Indochina.  It
 remarks that at a time when Cambodia is "occupied" by U.S. and
 Saigon troops, "such a conference would merely be a screen for
 future violations of the already existing Geneva agreements."
 Another critical reference to Soviet UN representative Yakov Malik
 appears currently in Peking propaganda.  NCNA on the 13th carries
 a statement by the Thai CP on Cambodia which denounces Malik's
 statement on a Geneva conference as an effort to "legalize" the
 Lon Nol-Sirik Matak "clique."

 13 MAY 1970
 DRV ON      DRV media promptly scored Secretary General U Thant's remarks
 U THANT     on an Indochina conference, with I'Iano: radio on 8 May
 taking him to task for failing to criticize the U.S.
 "imperialists" and instead expressing concern about the "recent
 situation in Indochina."  The broadcast said Thant's call for "urgent
 negotiations among all parties in Indochina" was consistent with a
 U.S. scheme aimed at legalizing the Lon Nol regime, and it noted
 that Secretary Rogers had immediately endorsed U Thant's remarks.
 Hanoi recalled that the declaration issued by the 24-25 April
 Indochina summit conference had "strongly condemned all schemes of
 the United States and its hirelings as well as Asian reactionaries
 to take advantage of the United Nations or any international or
 Asian organization or conference to legalize" the Lon Not regime.
 VNA commented along the same lines on the 9th and expressed support
 for Sihanouk's 5 May statement that "no one has any right to convene
 any international conference on the question of Cambodia."
 DJAKARTA       A Moscow broadcast in English to Southeast Asia on
 CONFERENCE     6 May, commenting on the proposal for an Asian and
 Pacific countries' conference on Cambodia, reported
 that seven out of 21 countries had rejected Djakarta's invitation
 but proceeded to list only six--the DPRK, the DRV, India, Pakistan,
 Burma, and Ceylon.  A Djakarta broadcast on 1 May reported Indonesian
 Foreign Minister Adam Malik as stating that the PRC had officially
 declined his invitation, but available Peking propaganda has not
 mentioned the invitation.
 MOSCOW CONTINUES CRITICISM OF CHINESE POSITION
 In the wake of Kosygin's statement on 4 May that the escalation of
 U.S. "aggression" makes "even more urgent the need for uniting and
 strengthening the cohesion of all the socialist, anti-imperialist,
 and peace-loving forces," routine Soviet propaganda dire-ted to
 the PRC has continued to stress the theme of united action.  The
 day after a 5 May Radio Peace and Progress broadcast in Mandarin
 recalled various past proposals on united action,* another one
 recalled that joint actions of the USSR and the PRC in the past had
 dealt blows to the "imperialists" and cited the example of the
 resolution of the Indochina question at the 1954 Geneva conference.
 Moscow propaganda periodically cites the example of Sino-Soviet
 cooperation at the Geneva conference, the most recent previous case
 being in a 26 April Radio Moscow broadcast in Mandarin.

 A Moscow broadcast in Mandarin on 9 May scored the Chinese for
 opening an "unprecedented" anti-Soviet campaign at a time when
 "all the peace-loving nations are faced with the solemn and
 pressing question of how to adopt united actions to counter the
 aggressors" in Indochina.  The commentary says that at the end of
 April the Chinese stepped up their campaign, thus leading
 Washington to believe that "Peking's hands were tied in the
 north" and encouraging the Americans to expand aggression in
 Southeast Asia.  Comparing this with the period of the inception
 of the bombing of the DRV, the commentary repeats the recurrent
 allegation that Mao Tse-tung assured the American writer Edgar
 Snow that China would not go to war if Chinese territory were
 left alone.  Recalling that at that time the Chinese rejected
 proposals on united actions, the commentary remarks that the
 "situation is roughly similar today."  While "the need is greater
 than ever" for all anti-imperialist forces to act in unison, it
 says, the Chinese leaders stubbornly disseminate the idea that
 China is in danger of being invaded from the north.
 A 12 May Peace and Progress commentary in Mandarin quotes
 Kosygin's greetings message of that date to Sihanouk and
 reiterates that the escalation of U.S. aggression in Indochina
 makes more urgent the need for uniting and strengthening socialist
 cohesion.  It recalls that U.S. actions in Indochina were denounced
 in the 7 May Soviet-Czechoslovak communique as well as by Brezhnev
 in Prague on the 7th and that the comuunique also denounced Peking
 for pursuing a splittist, anti-Soviet policy.  The commentary
 repeats the charge that the Chinese encouraged U.S. escalation by
 their anti-Soviet policy and mentions the "scoundrelly" PEOPLE'S
 DAILY article of 22 April which "was in reality Mao Tse-tung's
 invitation to the United States to begin the invasion of Cambodia."*
 MILITARY AND POLITICAL SITUATION IN CAMBODIA
 ALLIED MOVES     A Hanoi radio report on the 9th takes note of the
 launching across the Cambodian frontier the
 preceding day of a combined U.S.-South Vietnamese naval force up the
 Mekong River and predictably calls it a "new aggressive attack
 against Cambodia."  Earlier Vietnamese communist comment had largely
 ignored the location of the military operations in the "Parrot's
 Beak" area of Svay Rieng Province and the "Fishhook" area of

 Kompong Cham Province.  But Hanoi now notes the allied thrusts
 into Svay Rieng, Kompong Cham, Kratie, Mondolkiri, and Ratanakiri
 provinces in asserting that the naval, "attack" in the direction
 of Phnom Penh has "unmasked" President Nixon's statement that
 U.S. forces have not moved beyond 30 kilometers inside Cambodia.
 Both an LPA dispatch and a NHAN DAN article of the 9th comment on the
 Mekong expedition, LPA saying that the "alleged" purpose is to
 assist interned Vietnamese residents in Cambodia but that in fact
 the naval armada is "ferrying armaments" to the Phnom Penh
 authorities and carrying out the "vicious scheme" of "forcibly"
 repatriating Vietnamese residents to  GVN-controlled areas of
 South Vietnam.  NHAN DAN also takes note of the arrival in
 Cambodia of "thousands" of native Cambodian "mercenary troops"
 from South Vietnam and a reportedly "secret" visit to Phnom Penh
 by Vice President Ky to discuss with government leaders further
 repressive plans against the Khmer people and Vietnamese residents.
 The allied naval expedition also prompts a DRV Foreign Ministry
 statement of the 11th, carried by VNA the same day.  The statement
 condemns "this extremely impudent aggressive act," repeats the
 DRV's denunciation of the "massive aggressive operations in the
 eastern provinces of Cambodia from Ratanakiri to Svay Rieng," and
 takes note of Western reports that the GVN intends to use naval
 forces to blockade the Cambodian coast and "land troops at Ream
 and Kompong Som."  The DRV Foreign Ministry demands an "immediate
 end" to these actions and routinely says that the United States,
 Saigon, and Phnom Penh "must bear full responsibility for all the
 consequences arising from their acts."
 STATEMENT BY       The first statement        uted to the "command"
 CAMBODIAN PLAF     of the "Cambodian Peoi.      Liberation Armed
 Forces" (PLAF), dated 3 May, was carried by VNA
 )n the 11th.  VNA said it was released by the "Information Bureau
 of the National United Front of Kampuchea" (FUNK), an organization
 which had been mentioned as early as 7 May in a report of military
 developments.  The PLAF statement contains a call by the command to
 its forces throughout Cambodia to 1) quickly develop the three
 categories of armed forces, 2) attack enemy troops of all kinds,
 be they government, Khmer Serei, U.S.,or Saigon forces, 3) carry
 out political agitation among enemy troops, and 4) closely unite
 with the Vietnamese and Chinese residents.  The statement also
 expresses the Cambodian PLAF's conviction that "our Khmer people
 and armed forces will certainly attain our immediate fighting
 objectives."

 The statement claims that the PLAF has "repeatedly attacked the enemy
 and liberated hundreds of hamlets and villages and dozens of subsectors
 and district towns together with tens of thousands of people .  .  . and
 built up FUNK committees of various levels in the newly liberated
 areas."  Similar general references to the establishment of popular
 administration had appeared in a 6 May Hanoi radio commentary and in
 a VNA report on the 7th.  Some reports in mid-April specified that
 provisional committees had been set up in areas of Kompong Cham and
 Svay Rieng provinces.
 SIHANOUK    Sihanouk's 12 May message to the armed forces mentions the
 CLAIMS      creation of people's administrations "in many provinces
 and districts, particularly in Svay Rieng, Prey Veng,
 Kandal, Kompong Cham, Kompong Sepu, Takeo, Kampot, Mondolkiri,
 Ratanakiri, Kratie, and Stung Treng provinces."
 Sihanouk's 12 May message does not repeat his 25 April reference to
 "Indochinese people's liberation forces" and repeatedly refers to
 military activity waged by "our liberation army" or "our people's
 army."  In briefly tracing the chronology of developments in Cambodia
 leading up to the American decision to move "against our people,"
 NCNA reports Sihanouk as saying  that "our people's ar:.-,y had already
 surrounded Phnom Penh and was on the point of taking the capital by
 assault" before the allied military moves were made.  Earlier, NCNA's
 11 May report of a Royal Government statement proclaiming the
 severance of diplomatic relations with the United States asserted
 that had it not been for U.S. intervention the FUNK's armed forces
 "would have been in Phnom Penh by now."
 Sihanouk's message also contains a brief account of military victories
 allegedly achieved by the liberation forces, including "the capture
 of the cities of Kratie, Senmonorom, Stung Treng, Chhouk, etc.    . .,
 the cutting off of the communication, telegraphic and telephone
 lines between more than 20 urban centers and Phnom Penh." (The
 ellipses are NCNA's.)  In the meantime, the message adds, "in 13
 provinces, including Battambang, a large part of the population has
 been freed from the control of the Lon Nol administration."
 FUNK OFFICIALS  VNA on the 9th and NCNA on the 11th carried a second
 IN CAMBODIA     statement, dated 1 May, from the same three former
 Cambodian deputies who authored a statement dated
 26 March, released by VNA on 10 April.*  The three former deputies--
 Khieu Sam Phon, Hou Youn, and Hu Nim--are Political Bureau members of

 the FUNK's Central Commi+,tee and, respectively Minister of National
 Defense, Minister of In ',jrmation, and Minister of Interior in
 Sihanouk's self-proclaiwed "Royal Government of National Union."
 In addition, VNA now identifies them as "representatives of the
 Cambodian People's Movement of United Resistance affiliated with
 the FUNK."  This is the first time the propaganda has mentioned
 such an organization.  The new statement, "on behalf of the members
 of the Cambodian People's Movement of United Resistance," sets
 out general tasks for all Cambodians, the "FUNK committees at
 various levels in the country," and the liberation forces.
 NCNA on 11 May reported Sihanouk as having said, during a reception
 hosted in Peking the same day for friendly diplomats, that the
 three authors of the statement "are in their home country leading the
 Cambodian people to carry out heroic struggles."  And Sihanouk
 says in his 12 May message that he has entrusted the management of
 Cambodia "entirely to the patriotic persons who are now leading
 the national resistance in the country, particularly Comrades
 Khieu Sam Phon, Hou Youn and Hu Nim."
 STATEMENT BY         The Cambodian CP-front organization called the
 "PEOPLE'S GROUP"     "People's Group" (Pracheachon) resurfaced when its
 Central Committee statement, dated 23 April, was
 carried by VNA on 3 May and subsequently publicized by Front and Chinese
 media.  Expressing support for Sihanouk's 23 March appeal, the statement
 says that "ovrer the past 15 years (1955-70)" the People's Group, under
 "difficult as well as favorable circumstances," has consistently and
 actively carried out its political stand of uniting "patriotic"
 Cambodians--including "patriotic members of the royal family"--in
 the struggle against U.S. imperialism.
 The People's Group was announced on 6 August 1955 when VNA summarized
 a statement saying that it had been established in July in accordance
 with the Cambodian national constitution and that it was made up
 of "former members of the Khmer resistance."  The People's Group
 ran candidates under its own label in the 1955 and 1958 Cambodian
 elections.  It was suppressed by Sihanouk in the early 1960's.

 SITUATION IN SOUTH VIETNAM
 MILITARY                                  Vietnamese communist reports on military
 DEVELOPMENTS                         action in the first week of May include
 several items hailing the attacks on Chu
 Lai, Quang Nam Province, and attacks on bases along the Cambodian
 border said to have been used to launch allied actions in
 Cambodia.  A Hanoi radio commentary of the 9th says that these
 early May "victories" are strong encouragement for the Khmers.
 A PLAF command instruction, broadcast by the Front on the 10th,
 urges combatant,y to accelerate their emulation in fighting to
 defeat the allies and thus commemorate the historic days in May:
 Ho's birthday, the anniversary of the PRG, the recent founding of
 the'tndochinese people's front,"and the anniversary oL Dien Bien Phu.
 The instruction, dated 7 May, hails the "victories" of the communists
 in April, routinely calling them a violent blow to Vietnamization
 and to U.S. expansion of the war, and proof of solidarity among the
 Indochinese people.  It sets forth several tasks for the PLAF:
 developing the offensive and annihilating allied troops and
 destroying their materiel, aiding the people in their uprisings,
 and striving for "thrift" and for boosting production.
 PEOPLE'S UPRISING,       An undated QUAN GIAI PHONG commentary,
 REVOLUTIONARY ORGANS     broadcast by the Front on the 7th, claims
 that in the early days of April people's
 uprisings occurred vigorously along with the military offensive.
 The commentary describes a variety of actions throughout the
 South including demonstrations, punishing allied "agents," and
 military attacks.  It claims that certain localities which used to
 struggle in legal and overt ways now have "arisen to annihilate
 tyrants" and take part in military action.  This upsurge of
 uprisings demonstrates that "our political strength is tremendous"
 and the political position of the "revolution" is enhanced even in
 allied-controlled areas.
 On the 9th the Front radio reports a conference held by Ben Tre
 Province on 24 April to discuss plans for stepping up activities of
 the revolutionary administration and consolidating and supporting
 its organizational apparatus.  Representatives of the various
 echelons of the "administration" were reportedly present.
 A people's revolutionary court in a Can Tho district held a public
 session on 20 April to try two "U.S. spies," Nguyen Van Hai and Tran
 Van Ba, according to a Front broadcast on the 8th.  The broadcast
 reports that Hai was sentenced to death because he had been an
 informer and refused to be "educated" or warned about his "crimes."

 COMMENT ON GVN             The recent disturbances at the progovcrnment
 Buddhist temple in Saigon prompt communiuL
 propaganda attacks on the GVN.  Antigovernment
 youths and Buddhists reportedly seized the temple; progovcrnment
 Buddhists recaptured it early on the 5th.  The communists charge
 that the latter group of Buddhists was composed of disguised GVN
 police, and a Front radio broadcast on the 9th ridicules GVN
 denials of involvement.
 On the 7th LPA notes chat GVN's action in closing all Saigon schools
 beginning 5 May and increasing curfew hours.  The item calls these
 moves further steps in repressing the students, and adds that
 "Saigon is now in a very tense situation."  Several items report
 other incidents, including student demonstrations at the Cambodian
 embassy and protests against massacres of Vietnamese in Cambodia.
 A Front radio commentary on the 12th asserts that in another "fascist,
 repressive, and terrorist action" b, the Saigon regime, the GVN
 supreme court on 11 May decided to put three student leaders on
 trial befor: a military court.  Available communist propaganda has
 not acknowledged the supreme court ruling that Tran Ngoc Chau should
 be released from prison or its decision declaring invalid the
 military court trials of arrested students.
 DRV FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN ON U,S. ENCROACHMENTS
 Hanoi radio on 13 May broadcasts a DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's
 protest condemning alleged U.S. artillery shelling on 11. May against
 Vinh Hoa village from the southern side of the demilitarized zone.
 It adds that at the same time U.S.aircraft fired rockets at Vinh
 Gia village.  It asserts that both villages are located on the
 northern side of the DMZ.  The protest routinely condemns the alleged

 LINO - SOVIET  R ELATIONS
 MOSCOW, PEKING PLAY DOWN DISPUTE, MANEUVER ON INDOCHINA
 In a setting dominated by Indochincoc developments, Moscow and
 Pelting have played down their polemic on bilateral iuoucs while
 maneuvering to strengthen their respective positions vis-a-vis -the
 parties involved in Indochina.*  Public statements and propaganda
 surrounding Le Duan's visits to Moscow and Peking have included no
 reference to the state of Nino-Soviet relations.  Last October DRV
 Premier Phan Van Dong, on the return leg of his visit to the PRC
 winding up a tour that included the USSR and the GDR, had endorsed
 the recently opened Sino-Soviet talks and expressed "deep hope"
 that they would succeed.**  NCNA noted at that time that Dong had
 arrived in Peking after visiting the Soviet Union and the GDR;
 this time NCNA's 10 May announcement of Le Duan's arrival did not
 mention his previous whereabouts.
 Minima], comment on China in Moscow's central media consists
 essentially of ideological attacks and avoids the previously
 emphasized theme of provocative Chinese war preparations and anti-
 Soviet hysteria.  The border talks were the subject of a 6 May
 Moscow broadcast in Mandarin to southeast Asia, elaborating on
 Kosygin's l- May press conference remarks on the talks, which went
 beyond Kosygin in charging that the Chinese have obstructed the
 restoration of good relations by launching an anti-Soviet campaign.
 Observing that within the past year Moscow on several occasions
 has proposed the normalization of relations, the broadcast said the
 Soviets had advanced "concrete proposals" to this end--possibly an
 allusion to such proposals as an exchange of ambassadors.
 There has been no announcement on the border talks, with chief
 Soviet negotiator Kuznetsov's trip to Moscow unreported by either
 side.  The head of the PRC delegation at the talks, Vice Foreign
 Minister Chiao Kuan-hua, attended a Czechoslovak embassy reception
 on 9 May, according to NCNA.
 *   See the Indochina section of this TRENDS for documentation of
 Soviet and Chinese propaganda on Cambodia.
 **  An appeal for fraternal unity reminiscent of statements by Hanoi
 last fall is contained in a speech delivered by the Italian CP's
 Berlinguer on 3 May.  Calling for solidarity among the Soviet Union,
 the PRC, and other socialist countries on the Indochina conflict,
 Berlinguer recalled the appeal in Ho Chi Minh's testament for an end
 to fraternal strife.

 GRECHKO SPEECH     Moscow'n current restraint on the China question
 is reflected in Defense Minister Grechko's 8 May
 speech marking the 25th anniversary of Nazi Germany's defeat.  In
 contrast to his attack in an article on the occasion last year on
 the "adventurist" line of the "Mao Tse-tung group," Grechko this
 time did not mention the Chinese by name.  But while respecting
 current political considerations, he served notice that the Soviets
 regard China as a source of major concern and have not loi;. e d their
 guard.  Demanding heightened vigilance toward both "imperialist and
 other militarist [read:  Chinese] forces," he warned that Moscow has
 drawn "the most serious conclusions from the alteration in the
 military-political situation in the Far East"--that is, the Sino-
 Soviet confrontation.   He added that the Soviets are undertaking all
 necessary measures to insure that their defense "in both West and East
 is strong and' indestructible."
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA     The sensitive subject of Czechoslovakia has again
 figured in Sino-Soviet polemical crossfire.  The
 7 May joint communique on the Brezhnev-Kosygin delegation's visit to
 Czechoslovakia took the opportunity to register the two sides'
 "unanimous" views on Peking's policies in the communist movement and
 denounced the Chinese for interfering in the internal affairs of the
 socialist countries.  Moscow has sought to drive the point home in
 broadcasts to China censuring the Maoist leadership for its divisive
 approach and its inflammatory propaganda urging the Czechoslovaks to
 resist their leaders and their Soviet overlords.
 Peking has provided a reminder of its effort to probe Soviet
 vulnerabilities in Eastern Europe by sending a message to the
 Czechoslovak Government on the occasion of Czechoslovakia's
 national day.  The message pointedly hails the Czechoslovaks as a
 people with "a glorious revolutionary tradition."  An NCNA
 dispatch on 8 May, rounding up worldwide activities marking May
 Day, directed a barb at the Soviets in taking note of a Swedish
 demonstration against the U.S. invasion of Cambodia and the "Soviet
 revisionist military occupation of Czechoslovakia."

 YUGOSLAVIA
 BELGRADE USES CAMBODIA ISSUE TO PRESS NONALINEMENT
 Belgrade has used the U.S. "invasion" of "nonalined" Cambodia
 to give impetus  to the projected third nonalined summit,
 scheduled to be held in the Zambian capital of Lusaka in the
 first half of September.  Addressing a Belgrade luncheon for
 visiting Zambian President Kaunda on 7 May, Tito asserted,
 according to TANJUG, that "it is high time indeed for all
 democratic and peaceful forces to oppose the most resolute
 resistance to the policy of force and to eliminate it from
 international relations." He went on to condemn "the brutal
 violation of Cambodia's sovereignty" as "a challenge to all
 mankind striving for peace."  The communique on the two leaders'
 talks, released by TANJUG on the 6th, contained a condemnation
 of the U.S. action and emphasized that nonalinement "is the
 only alternative to the policy of pressure and force and as a
 road leading toward progress and peace."  Tito had made a point
 of Cambodia's nonalinement in a 3 May speech assailing U.S.
 "aggression" against that country.
 Tito's cloLe associate Kardelj, currently on a tour of Latin
 America apparently designed in part to drum up support for
 the Lusaka summit, used the occasion of an airport reception
 in Santiago, Chile, on 10 May to call on all "peace-seeking
 forces" to raise their voices in opposition to the U.S. action.
 TANJUG quoted Kardelj as declaring that "acquiescence in U.S.
 aggression jeopardizes the independence and sovereignty of every
 country, for the plight in which Cambodia finds itself may be
 the fate of other people tomorrow."
 Yugoslavia's prompt recognition of the Sihanouk government-in-
 exile on 6 May, the day after its formation was announced, would
 also appear to have some relevance to the forthcoming Lusaka
 summit, where the gaestion of accreditation of a Cambodian
 delegation may be expected to be an issue.  At the Dar es Salaam
 preparatory meeting held 13-17 April, neither the Sihanouk
 delegation nor the Lon Nol regime's representation was
 allowed to take part.  A decision on whether or not to seat the
 Vietnam PRG delegation must also be made at the Lusaka summit.

 MIDDLE  EAST
 MOSCOW ASSAILS ISRAEL FOR INCURSION INTO LEBANON
 Moscow promptly denounces Israel for increasing tension in the Middle
 East by its 12-13 April raid into southern Lebanon, taking the line
 that Washington and Tel Aviv are trying to detach Lebanon from the
 "common Arab front" and isolate it from the rest of the Arab world.
 According to Shragin in a domestic service commentary on the 12th,
 Israel and the United States thus want to use Lebanon as a base for
 action against the UAR and other "progressive" Arab countries.
 Shragin and other propagandists link the incursion with reported U.S.
 plans to reconsider its program of arms supplies to Israel.  Vasilyev
 says in RED STAR on the 13th, according to TASS, that President
 Nixon's "recent statement on U.S. readiness to reconsider additional
 deliveries of aircraft to Israel came as a 'stimulant"' for Israel's
 attack on Lebanon.  TASS on the 9th, reporting the President's press
 conference the previous day, noted that he "confirmed the old
 policy of supporting the Israeli aggressors and stated that the United
 States may review the question of selling new consignments of combat
 planes to Israel."  Moscow gave the President's statement no further
 attention in its very meager broadcast propaganda on the Middle
 East over the past week.
 In the fir-ct comment on the new Israeli action, TASS commentator Orlov
 on the 12th broaches the arms delivery question along the lines of
 Moscow's recent evasive propaganda response to Israel's charge that
 Soviet pilots were taking part in operational missions in Egypt.
 Concurrently with the attack on Lebanon and continuing air strikes
 on other Arab countries, Orlov says, "imperialist and Zionist"
 circles are waging a propaganda campaign based on allegations about
 Arab threats against Israel, using them as a "false pretext" for
 U.S. reexamination of the arms deliveries.
 An Arabic-language commentary on the 12th also finds the timing. of
 the Israeli action "significant" in that it coincides with "flimsy
 hints" in the U.S. press regarding Washington's "readiness to
 increase militar  ind material aid to Tel Aviv."  This commentary
 claims that the L__ited States and Israel are concerned with the
 Lebanese progressive forces' success in consolidating solidarity
 with the Palestinian resistance movement, "which is of significance"
 in the Arab struggle for liberation of the occupied territories.
 The broadcast suggests that Israel suffered such "intense retaliation"
 on the Egyptian front that it was forced to select other targets,

 possibly considering Lebanon the least dangerous.  But it is
 dangerous for Israel, the broadcast adds, to "rely on the
 weakness of a particular Arab country" in view of the Arabs'
 growing solidarity, which has been "brilliantly manifested" in the
 current attack.
 Reporting the Security Council's unanimous adoption on the 12th
 of a resolution demanding immediate Israeli withdrawal from
 Lebanese territory, TASS says that the U.S. and British representa-
 tives tried to delay the voting "in the interests of the Israeli
 aggressors" but that a U.S.-proposed amendment was rejected.
 TASS makes no mention of the Soviet sub-amendment or of any
 remarks by Soviet delegate Malik.  Reporting the Council's evening
 session of the 12th, TASS the following day states that Israeli
 delegate Tekoah "impudently" said Israel had not yet carried out
 the resolution on withdrawal and that he "boasted of the
 destruction and casualties" caused by Israeli troops.

 GRECHKO ATTACKS 'IMPERIALISTS," AFFIRMS SOVIET "PEACE" POLICY
 Soviet Defense Minister Grechko's 8 May keynote speech on the
 25th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany balances reaffirma-
 tions of Soviet adherence to a policy of peaceful coexistence with
 warnings about a continuing "imperialist" threat, predictable for
 the occasion.  Grechko calls "American imperialism" the "chief
 bulwark of international reaction," pointing to the United States'
 accumulat4on of :Large stocks of nuclear-missile arms, its support
 for Israeli "aggression," and its efforts to "implement armed
 intervention against revolutionary Cuba" as well as its actions in
 Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.  Both Kosygin and Brezhnev in speeches
 in Prague on 6 and 7 May, respectively, had decried U.S. action: in
 Southeast Asia, including the incursions into Cambodia.  Kosygin
 said the U.S. operations in Cambodia compel the Soviet Union and
 the other Warsaw Pact countries to do "everything possible to
 repulse and halt imperialist aggression."
 Grechko underscores the adequacy of the defenses of the Soviet Union
 and its Warsaw Pact allies, at one point noting that the imperialists
 have been "forced to admit" that a direct clash with the socialist
 system, particuarly in a nuclear-rocket war, "must lead to
 disastrous consequences for the capitalist system."  A third world war,
 Grechko says, would "compel mankind to suffer unprecedented trials,
 [but] it would inevitably lead to the collapse of imperialism as
 a world system."  He stops short of declaring, however, that the
 socialist system would in fact be the "victor."*
 Grechko goes on to state that "a new war is by no means a necessary
 prerequisite for the universal victory of socialism" and that war
 can be averted by the united actions of the peace-loving forces--a
 theme also sounded by Marshal Bagramyan in a talk broadcast by Radio
 Moscow for foreign audiences on 9 May.  Bagramyan called for unity
 in the struggle against war "in a time of lethal weapons of gigantic
 destructive capacity" and added that "in our time, war is no  longer
 a fatal inevitability."
 *  One of the infrequent Soviet references to socialist victory had
 appeared in a 30 August 1969 SOVIET RUSSIA article by Marshal Krylov,
 pegged to the anniversary of the outbreak of World War II.  Krylov
 said "victory" in a nuclear war "will be on the side of world
 socialism and all progressive mankind."

 Grechko declares that the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries
 are pursuing "a Leninist policy of peace and friendship" and that their
 foreign political activities are permeated with a concern for improving
 the political climate in the world, "first and foremost in Europe."
 The policy is also directed, he says, at discontinuation "of the
 strategic and all other kinds of arms races," at establishing a
 reliable system of collective security, and at eliminating without
 delay the hotbeds of war in Southeast Asia and the Near East, "for
 which imperialist powers are to blame."  He remarks further that
 the socialist countries, "following the principles of peaceful
 coexistence, . . . do not doubt the expediency of this or that
 concrete agreement with capitalist states, the possibility and
 necessity of settling unsolved problems by means of diplomacy."
 Cooperation between countries with different social systems, he
 concludes, "can be utilized in solving a whole series of questions
 which are of interest both to the socialist and capitalist states"
 of the world.

 WEST  GERMANY
 STOPH TO ATTEND KASSEL SUMMIT DESPITE FRG'S "DISCRIMINATION"
 GDR propaganda and leaders' statements indicate that Premier Stoph
 will attend the second summit meeting with FRG Chancellor Brandt,
 scheduled to be held at Kassel on 21 May, notwithstanding numerous
 GDR protests against West German "discrimination" against the East
 Germans and increasingly personal attacks on Brandt.  There is
 no evidence of any change in the GDR's basic demand presented at
 the 19 March Erfurt summit:  international recognition of the GDR.
 This position is restated in numerous commentaries and statements,
 including an exchange of letters between Stoph and Brandt, leaders'
 speeches and comments surrounding the 25th Victory Day anniversary,
 and GDR protests arising from West German efforts to prevent GDR
 admission to membership in the World Health Organization (WHO) at
 its Geneva assembly that opened 5 May.
 KASSEL TALKS     Ulbricht personally confirmed that the GDR will not
 back out of the second summit at Kassel, declaring
 in a 7 May speech to a Berlin teachers' congress that "we are eager
 to hear the arguments" Brandt will present to Stoph at Kassel.
 Restating the GDR's established line and noting that its draft treaty
 has been in Bonn's hands "for a long time," Ulbricht declared that
 the second summit would prove whether the FRG Government "is willing
 at long last" to accept the GDR as an equal and recognize it and
 accede to other GDR proposals.
 GDR media continue to report the activities of GDR officials negotiating
 on "technical protocol prerequisites" in Bonn and Kassel, as they
 had done prior to the meeting in Erfurt, and ADN notes on 12 May
 that GDR officials expect to make one more visit to Kassel before
 the summit takes place.
 STOPH-BRANDT         Late on 6 May, GDR media publicized Stoph's
 CORRESPONDENCE       5 May letter to Brandt expressing concern about
 "necessary conditions to insure equal negotiations
 without any discrimination."  Couched in relatively nonpolemical terms,
 Stoph's letter explained that his doubt that essential conditions for
 the Kassel summit existed stemmed from the continued existence of
 the so-called "handcuff law" treating GDR citizens as subject to FRG
 laws and the fact that a West German "fascist" had filed a charge--
 Stoph did not acknowledge that it was a murder charge--which was
 "treated provocatively" by FRG judicial authorities.  Stoph also
 protested FRG efforts to prevent GDR admission to the recent ;session
 of the UN Economic Commission for Europe and to membership in WHO,

 concluding that the "contradictions" between Brandt's Erfurt
 decln,rations and the actual policy of the FRG "are not conducive
 to promoting the consultations    in Kassel."
 Stoph said the GDR stresses that all FRG laws infringing on
 "elementary principles of equality and nondiscrimination" must be
 eliminated.  And he expressed "hope" for "a binding assurance" from
 West Germany that the GDR delegation will enjoy in Kassel all the
 "rights, privileges, and immunities" granted "equal-ranking
 representatives of other sovereign states" in accord with international
 law.
 Brandt's 6 May reply, according to ADN on the 7th, "merely gives
 the assurance" that Stoph and his party will get the same treatment
 Brandt had received at Erfurt, ignoring the GDR's demand for rights
 due heads of "other sovereign states."  ADN also says Brandt's
 reply "defended" discriminatory FRG laws, "expressly affirmed" the
 FRG's intentions to continue a discriminatory policy and "blatant
 interference" in GDR affairs, and "arrogantly" mad;, It clear that the
 FRG would not change its policy until the GDR submits to its
 "revanchist demands."  This "blackmail concept utterly contradicts"
 FRG declaratior;s and international law, ADN complains.
 GDR ATTACK      GDR media have contrasted the Victory Day anniversary
 ON BRANDT       speeches by GDR leaders with an 8 May Bundestag
 statement by Brandt on the same occasion.  As quoted
 by ADN on the 10th, NEUES DEUTSCHLAND accused Brandt of failing to
 "dissociate himself from those responsible" for World War II, of
 "covering up the crimes of German imperialism before and after
 8 May 1945," and of "glossing over present-day war crimes--the U.S.
 attack on neutral Cambodia."  ADN also reports that BERLINER ZEITUNG
 called Brandt's speech one of "revanchism and nationalism" and
 charged that Brandt's "embrace" of former Chancellor Adenauer's
 policies was "tantamount to revanchism,"
 Stoph's own Victory Day speech at Berlin ceremonies, broadcast by the
 East Berlin radio on the 8th, covers familiar ground in praising the
 Soviet role in crushing Hitlerite fascism, tracing the GDR's develop-
 ment as a peace-loving state that has eliminated "imperialism and
 militarism forever," and impugning FRG intentions.  Stoph does not
 attack Brandt by name, but refers to statements by "leading politicians
 in Bonn" who, Stoph charges, still seek to camouflage an old policy
 aimed at "revenge and conquest" with statements lacking the substance
 of a "truly new policy."

 USSR AND CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 NEW TREATY INCORPORATES LIMITED SOVEREIGNTY DOCTRINE
 The new Soviet-Czechoslovak treaty of friendship, cooperation, and
 mutual assistance signed in Prague on 6 May, as released in full by
 TASS the same day, incorporates Moscow's ex post facto rationale
 for the invasion of Czechoslovakia in a clause--the first of its
 kind to appear in a Soviet treaty with an East European ally--binding
 the signatories to undertake "the necessary measures to defend the
 socialist gains" of the two countries.  The preamble reinforces the
 thrust of this proviso in terming the protection of socialist gains
 "a common internationalist duty of socialist countries"--the now
 standard formula advanced in the Bratislava Declaration of
 3 August 1968, imposed on Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw 3ive shortly
 before the invasion.  The Bratislava statement declared "support,
 consolidation, and protection" of socialist gains to be "a common
 internationalist duty of all socialist countries."  Czechoslovakia's
 vassal status is underscored in the new treaty by a provision, without
 precedent in such a documert, for expansion of "direct ties between
 bodies of state power and the public organizations of working people
 of the two countries."
 Brezhnev highlighted the treaty's inclusion of the limited sovereignty
 doctrine in his Prague Castle speech at the signing, noting, according
 to the Moscow domestic service text, the+ the pact expresses both
 countries' "firm will to take all measures necessary to defend the
 socialist gains" of the two peoples.  He warned in the same context:
 "May our foes never forget that any attempts to violate the
 territorial integrity of socialist Czechoslovakia will meet with an
 effective, powerful rebuff from our joint forces."  These remarks are
 featured in the 10 May PRAVDA editorial on the new treaty.
 The Prague trade union daily PRACE on 7 May promptly defended the
 incorporation of the provision on protection of socialist gains,
 citing as its forerunner not the Bratislava Declaration but "the
 appropriate conclusions" drawn by the June 1969 international party
 conference in Moscow,  Predicting that the new treaty clause would
 "be the object of the strongest clamor of enemy propaganda," the
 paper proceeded to rebut such "clamor" in advance with the stereotyped
 rationale about socialist states having the "duty" to assist any
 of their number whose "workers' class is unable to overcome the
 attack of the enemy forces on its own."  Articles by RUDE PRAVO's
 chief editor and in Bratislava PRAVDA on the 12th, reviewed by CTK,
 are more forthright in rebutting Western talk about "limited
 sovereignty" and in citing the Bratislava Declaration as the
 antecedent of the statement in the preamble on protection of socialist
 gains.

 DELETION OF "IN EUROPE" PHRASE FOLLOWS TWO PRECEDENTS
 Against the background of the Sino-Soviet conflict, the new
 Czechoslovak-Soviet treaty follows a three-year-old Soviet practice
 in the renewal of such pacts by deleting the phrase "in Europe"
 from an article binding each contracting party to rome to the
 other's aid in the event of an attack.
 The preamble states that the new treaty takes into account "the
 present situation" in the two countries'  relations as well as
 changes in Europe "and in the whole world" since the original
 Soviet-Czechoslovak treaty was concluded on 12 December 1943.
 The renewal of that 20-year pact had been accomplished merely by a
 protocol, signed 27 November 1963, which updated the 1943 text by
 referring to peaceful coexistence and to the Warsaw Treaty of
 14 May 1955.  The latter document provides for mutual assistance
 "in the event of an armed attack in Europe on one or several states
 participating in the Treaty, by any state or group of states ... ."
 An "in Europe" clause comparable to the one in the Warsaw Treaty
 was incorporated in the USSR's new bilateral 20-year treaty with
 East Germany, signed 12 June 1964.  The new Soviet treaty with
 Poland, signed 8 April 1965, altered the formula to specify an
 attack by West Germany "or any other state which would enter into an
 alliance" with that country.
 Geographical confines were removed entirely from the formula in the
 new USSR-Bulgarian pact of 12 May 1967 and the new USSR-Hungarian
 pact of 7 September 1967, both of which refer simply to "an armed
 attack by any state or group of states."   The new treaty with
 Czechoslovakia follows suit.  Moscow's demand for such an open-ended
 commitment from its treaty partners may be assumed to be one factor
 underlying the absence of an announced renewal of the Soviet-
 Romanian 20-year treaty, which expired on 4 February 1968 and remains in
 force under an automat;.c five-year extension clause.

 13 MAY 1970
 PCI USES LENIN CENTENARY TO REASSERT AUTONOMOUS STANCE
 Italian Communist Party (PCI) spokesmen have used the Lenin centenary
 celebrations in Rome and Moscow to reassert the party's thesis of
 "national" paths to socialism. An extraordinary session of the PCI
 Central Committee and Central Control Commission on Lenin Day in Rome
 was marked by an indirect exchange on the issue between CPSU Central
 Committee member and Deputy Chairman of the USSR Academy of Sciences
 A.N. Rumyantsev and PCT Politburo member Giorgio Napolitano.  At the
 Moscow celebrations, PCT Politburo member Gian Carlo Pajetta argued
 the need for communists to give prime consideration to specific national
 conditions in formulating their strategy.  Napolitano's and Pajetta's
 remarks were in keeping with PCI efforts since last October to use the
 Lenin centenary as a peg for exposition of the party's heterodox
 views:  Articles iii the PCI press invoked Lenin's teachings to justify
 the espousal of diverse roads to socialism and counterposed Leninism
 to Stalinism, going so far as suggest that the CPSU is still organized
 along Stalinist lines while the PCI is a truly Leninist party.*
 POLEMIC     Rumyantsev's remarks in Rome on 22 April, summarized by
 IN ROME     the PCI organ L'UNITA on the 23d, seemed contrived as an
 oblique rebuke to the PCI for failure to take due account
 of the Soviet revolutionary "model."  He described the Soviet revolu-
 tionary experience as something that "no people can fail to consider";
 and while granting the relevance of national conditions, he stated
 that "many general laws" which have universal validity are applicable
 to the process of building socialism. He also contended that the
 closer a country comes to launching a socialist revolution, "the more
 precious, actual, and important for them become the experience and
 conclusions drawn by those who have already gone through that stage
 of political and socialist development."
 In an indirect rejoinder, Napolitano affirmed that the PCI was able
 to hew to Leninist concepts "without withdrawing into an absurd
 obedience to a rigid and unchangeable model" which would have been
 "contrary" to Lenin's teachings.  His party, he said, had always
 placed stress on "a diversity of conditions and historical experiences
 which must be recognized openly and on a variety of paths of access
 to socialism and of building socialism."  While conceding that the
 "historical context" was different, he cited asrelevant today a
 statement by Lenin that "socialism is inconceivable without democracy."
 He pointedly credited the 20th CPSU Congress with providing a great
 imretus to the PCI's development of "an original prospect of advance
 toward socialism" and at a later point deplored Stalin's "deforming
 and opportunist" simplification of Lenin's thinking.

 FBIS TRENDS
 13 MAY 1970
 The Rumyantsev-Napolitano exchange had been foreshadowed in a
 discussion of the Leninist concept of the state at a Soviet-
 Italian historical meeL?:Lng in Florence in mid-April.  According
 to a 15 April account of the meeting in L'UNITA, Italian and
 Soviet scholars registered "differences of interpretation" on
 the concept of socialist democracy.  PCI Central Committee member
 Luciano Gruppi's remarks, as cited in this account, seemed a
 transparent criticism of the Soviet model of socialism:  the
 soviets which were supposed to be a government of the workers,
 he said, "were in fact a government for the workers exercised
 by the vanguards," and the "bureaucracy" which arose after the
 Bolshevik revolution was "wedded to 'Great Russian' chauvinism,"
 causing Lenin to be coacerned that "the rights of nations to
 separation should not be a formal one but real."  Perhaps with
 Czechoslovakia in mind, Gruppi concluded that "internationalism
 can only be the result of the unity of the workers, which can
 only be achieved when national claims have been satisfied."
 OBSERVANCE    Speaking at the Moscow ceremonies on 22 April Paletta
 IN MOSCOW     was considerably more circumspect than Napolitano  as
 in Rome in pressing for distinctively national roads
 to socialism. He did argue that for the PCI being Leninist means
 giving prime emphasis to "securing a profound connection between the
 party and the reality of one's country," and he invoked Lenin's
 authority in noting the party's rejection of "the schematism of
 those who have tried to turn Marxist teaching from an instrument for
 recognizing reality . . . into a dogma."  Paj tta cited among factors
 contributing to Lenin's stature among revolutionaries his insistence
 on careful analysis "of the special conditions of each separate .:ountry
 and each separate historical period."  He concluded that "Leninist
 internationalism" entails firm backing for "the self-dependence of
 e'rery party, regard for a given country's particular features, and
 the independence of every country."
 BACKGROUND    PCI leaders on past occasions have been explicit in
 rejecting Italian communist emulation of Soviet
 experience.  PCI Secretariat member Paolo Bufalini, for example,
 writing in the 17 April issue of the PCI theoretical journal
 RINASCITA on a 1951 clash between Stalin and Togliatti, declared:
 We are struggling for the democratic and socialist renovation
 of Italy on a path and perspective which are profoundly different
 than those of the USSR and other socialist countries.  We are
 struggling to arrive at socialism by a democratic path, to
 arrive at a pluralistic socialist society.  History cannot be
 repeated . . . .

 The PCI has persistently and directly censured Moscow for ignoring
 the question of democratization of Soviet society.  For example, a
 lli April L'UNI'T'A article by the paper's Moscow correspondent, after
 discussing recent debates in the USSR on economic reform, observed:
 "What has been lacking up to now, at least in the public debate, . . .
 is a speech which would broaden the debates to include problems of
 a more specifically political nature, taking up, for example, the
 study of, the reasons which actually limited the debate at the 20th
 CPSU congress to a mere denunciation of the errors of Stalin without
 tackling the problems of the structure and expansion of socialist
 democracy."
 STRESS ON PARTY AUTONOMY SERVES DOMESTIC POLITICAL ENDS
 Emphasis by PCI spokesmen on the party's complete autonomy has seemed
 calculated in considerable measure to bolster the party's domestic
 political position, with regional elections slated for 7 June.
 Frequently citing the PCI's opposition to the invasion of Czechoslovakia
 as proof of its independence, party spokesmen have on occasion
 contrasted this position with the alleged subservience of center-left
 Italian parties to U.S. dictates.  PCI Deputy General Secretary
 Berlinguer on 21 April, contended that "no other Italian party has
 given more proof of its independence than the PCI" and concluded,
 recalling the party's opposition to the August 1968 intervention,
 that the Czechoslovak events had afforded "new reasons" to justify
 PCI opposition to the division of Europe into rival military blocs
 which "severely limit the independence and free development of every
 country."
 Berlinguer made it clear in that speech that the PCI's vision of
 democratic socialism had nothing in corimon with the socialism
 practiced in Eastern Europe.  "We intend," he said, "to follow the
 path of a novel and modern socialism, one which is not bureaucratic,
 one which is based on the protection and exaltation of all individual
 and collective liberties," with "the concurrence of a plurality of
 political forces."
 In a 3 May speech condemning the U.S. intervention in Cambodia,
 Berlinguer scored the Italian ruling parties' "timid silence" on
 the issue while highlighting the PCI's "autonomous positions" on
 problems affecting socialist countries.  PCI spokesmen have used
 much the same approach in arguing for a severance of Italian ties
 with NATO.  Thus a L'UNITA article on 15 April, recalling the PCI's
 firm opposition to "limited sovereignty" in any form and most recently
 in Czechoslovakia, went on to ask rhetorically "who among the men of
 the noncommunist left" were prepared to take a comparable position
 "in the face of the 'limited sovereignty' imposed on the Italian state
 by Atlantic military integration."

 USSR  INTERIJAL AFFAIRS
 MAY DAY PHOTOGRAPHS REFLECT RANKINGS OF SOVIET LEACERS
 Comparison of May Day photos of Soviet leaders with the last photo-
 graphic lineups published in the central press late last year
 (7, 8, and 26 November, 7 and 17 December) suggests some shifts in
 the fortunes of junior Politburo members.  Polyanskiy, mos.'
 frequently ranked sixth in late 1969, has now slipped below Pelshe
 and Mazurov.  Pelshe has risen to No. 6--his highest ranking since
 Joining the Politburo.   Pelshe's status in the past has been
 unclear; for example, PRAVDA's 8 November 1969 photo showed him in
 seventh place while all the other central papers showed him last.
 Voronov is again shown standing last, as in PRAVDA's 7 December
 picture.
 The May Day standings appear to set the six older men--from the 71-year-
 old Pelshe to the 64-year-old Brezhnev and Kirilenko--apart from
 the four younger men.  Those in the younger group, from the 60-year-
 old Voronov to the 52-year-old Shelepin, are relegated to the lower
 positions.
 There is a more marked change in the Ukrainian press rankings of
 Moscow Politburo members.  The lineup of portraits published in
 the 2 May Kiev RADYANSKA UKRAINA strikingly favors Shelepin, placing
 him far higher than in Moscow's lineup and far higher than the
 Ukrainians had been ranking him:

 Shelepin has consistently ranked next to last, No. 10, for the last

 raised to No. 6 in the 8 November and 25 December 1967 RADYANSKA UKRAINA--
 but dropped back to tenth place on May Day 1968 and subsequently.
 Since late 1967 the Ukrainians have consistently ranked Suslov below
 Kirilenko and have consistently listed Mazurov, Voronov, and Polyanskiy
 in that order.  The Ukrainians always rank their leader, Shelest,
 No. 7 and Pelshe last.  Suslov and Polyanskiy are always less favored
 in the Ukraine than in Moscow.  S elep'n' s ups

 INFIGHTING CONTINUES IN UKRAINIAN WRITERS UNION
 Recent reports in the Ukrainian literary press indicate continuing
 turmoil in the Ukrainian Writers Union and complicated maneuvering
 among its feuding moderate and conservative leaders.  There is
 evidence that after setbacks suffered in late 1969 and early 1970,
 the moderates have won a few rounds themselves.
 Last December the moderates lost ground when conservatives engineered
 the expulsion of dissident writer Ivan Dzyuba from the Writers Union
 as well as the removal of Marharita Malinovaka,a defender of Writers
 Union Chairman Oles Honchar's novel "Sobor," from her post as deputy
 editor of the main Ukrainian literary newspaper, LITERATURNA UKRAINA.
 Although Ionchar's first deputy, conservative Yuriy Zbanatskiy, now
 appears to be playing a bigger role, especially in organizational work,
 the moderate Honchar is himself still very much in evidence.  In April
 Honchar took advantage of the Lenin birth centenary celebrations to
 call again for a tolerant policy toward writers' creative work.  Also
 in late April, one of Honchar's leading critics and the initiator of
 public attacks on Dzyuba, Oleksiy Poltoratskiy, was forced to make a
 public confession that his own work lacked ideological demandingness.
 VICTORIES FOR     Although Ivan Dzyuba's openly anti-Russian book
 CONSERVATIVES     "Internationalism or Russification?" was published
 in the West in 1968, the Ukrainian Writers Union
 failed to take any action against him.  Writers Union chairman Oles
 IIonchar failed to criticize Dzyuba or to participate in action against
 other Ukrainian dissidents.  The attacks on the signers of Ukrainian
 protest petitions circulating in early 1968 were made by Vasyl
 Kozachenko, Ukrainian Writers Union secretary and Kiev writers' party
 committee secretary (LITERATURNA UKRAINA, 21 and 24 May 1968), and
 VSESVIT editor Oleksiy Poltoratskiy (LITERATURNA UKRAINA, 16 July 1968).
 At a December 1968 meeting of Kozachenko's Kiev writers' party
 organization, Poltoratskiy initiated the attack on Dzyuba and also
 criticized the defenders of Honchar's novel "Sobor" (LITERATURNA
 UKRAINA, 27 December 1968).  For many months Poltoratskiy remained
 the only one on record publicly attacking Dzyuba's book.
 Finally, in late 1969, the conservatives moved against Dzyuba without
 the cooperation of Writers Union Chairman Honchar.  The Kiev writers
 organization board, of which Kozachenko is chairman, expelled Dzyuba
 from the Writers Union.  In late December 1969 the presidium of the
 Ukrainian Writers Union met to consider confirmation of Dzyuba's
 expulsion.  The meeting was conducted by Kozachenko and conservative
 Writers Union first Deputy Chairman Yuriy Zbanatskiy, with Chairman
 Honchar not participating.  After obtaining a partial recantation

 from Dzyuba, the presidium decided to allow him to remain in the
 union if he changed his ways (LITERATURNA UKRAINA, 6 January 1970).
 Dzyuba was again admonished at a 15 January 1970 Writers Union
 board plenum, where keynoter Pavlo Zahrebelnyy complained of the
 "many unpleasantnesses" Dzyuba had caused the union by his speeches
 and book (LITERATURNA UKRAINA, 16 January 1970).  Belated attempts
 were undertaken by the Ukraine's foreign propaganda organ, the
 Society for Cultural Ties With Ukrainians Abroad, to counteract the
 damage done by Dzyuba's book.  At a 12 February meeting the society's
 chairman, Yuriy Smolich, announced that the society had published a
 book by Bohdan Stanchuk to refute Dzyuba's book (VISTI Z UKRAINI,
 19 February 1970).  It was also published in English under the title
 "What I. Dzyuba Stands For, and How He Does It" and was described in
 the society's English-language paper NEWS FROM UKRAINE, No. 4,
 February 1970.
 Moderat-9 received another blow at the beginnin(; of January with the
 removal of LITERATURNA UKRAINA's deputy editor Marharita Malinovska.
 Malinovska had been the first to laud Honchar's "Sobor" when it was
 published in January 1968; her review appeared on the 19th of that
 month in LITERATURNA UKRAINA, and in RADYANSKA UKRAINA of 26 April 1968
 she was attacked by M. Yurchuk and F. Lebedenko for praising "Sobor"
 even before the novel had reached the reader.
 Signs of trouble in LITERATURNA UKRAINA's editorial board had first
 appeared in October 1969.  On 21 October chief editor I. Zub's name
 was removed from the list of editorial board members, and Malinovska's
 name was moved up to head of the board, although she was still listed
 only as deputy editor.  On 21 November LITERATURNA UKRAINA carried an
 account of a meeting of Kozachenko's Kiev writers' party organization
 at which LITERATURNA UKRAINA was criticized for publishing material
 which "lacks ideological sharpness and party principledness."  The
 same issue listed Zub again as chief editor, after a month with no
 chief editor listed.  A few days later Malinovska lost her title of
 deputy editor and from 5 December on was simply another editorial
 board member.  A month later--in the same 6 January 1970 issue which
 announced the expulsion of Dzyuba and his recantation--Malinovska was
 dropped from the editorial board altogether.
 Four days later the Ukrainian Central Committee organ RADYANSKA UKRAINA
 carried writer Boris Buryak's criticism of LITERATURNA UKRAINA for
 "praising clear artistic failures" and not reflecting the "tastes of
 readers and the writers' organization."  In March the Writers Union

 party committee discussed LITERAT'URNA UKRAINA's work and took it to
 task for not criticizing recent literary works of V. Drozd,
 R. Ivanichuk and I. Chendey.*  LITERATURNA UKRAINA was warned to
 raise its ideological demandingness and was admonished that "Lenin
 was implacable to what he called 'literary disguising' of anti-
 socialist ideas .  . ."  (LITERATURNA UKRAINA, 13 March 1970).
 GAINS SCORED     Honchar and the moderates appear to be holding their
 BY MODERATES     own.   In January a defender of Honchar's novel became
 chief of the Writers Union bool: advertising; in April
 Honchar made a speech urging a policy of toleration in literary work;
 and at the end of April Honchar critic and hardliner Poltoratskiy was
 publicly humiliated for himself publishing ideologically objectionable
 material.
 At a meeting of the presidium of the Writers Union on 20 January 1970
 Vitaliy Petlyovanyy resigned as director of the Writers Union literary
 advertising bureau for reasons of health, and V. Pyanov replaced him
 (LITERATURNA UKRAINA, 23 January).  Conservative Petlyovanyy had
 generally concurred in criticisms of "Sobor," in LITERATURNA UKRAINA
 on 27 December 1968), while Pyanov had highly praised "Sobor" in the
 22 February 1968'ROBITNICHA HAZETA.  After a 26 April 1968 article in
 the Central Committee organ RADYANSKA UKRAINA had attacked "Sobor"
 and Pyanov's review, ROBITNICHA HAZETA admitted on 28, April that
 Pyanov's article had been a "mistake."
 HONCHAR APPEAL   Speaking on behalf of the Writers Union at a 9 April
 FOR TOLERATION   1970 joint plenum of Ukrainian creative unions on
 Lenin's 100th anniversary, Honchar delivered a strong
 appeal for tolerance and nonintervention in literary life.  Noting the
 frequent rebukes to young authors, he declared that no one has exact
 answers for all new phenomena and "life cannot be laid in a Procrustean
 bed of dogmatism."  He stated that it is in the interests of foreign
 eneries to have Soviet literature appear dry, dogmatic, and schematic
 and for Soviet literature to "lose the readers' faith."  The party
 "orients us to create highly-talented literature" which can win the
 reader "by the strength of artistic images," he said, quoting Lenin
 to the effect that talent must be carefully protected.  While "we must
 accept readers' demandingness without irritation," he admonished, the
 "readers must also be taught deeper understanding of the specific
 features of literary and, in general, artistic work," since, for example,
 "among the youth some have superficial bourgeois ideas about the hard

 work of creative intelligentsia."  People can be educated "only
 by truth," he declared, and "the time of vulgar criticism has
 passed, and unfounded critical willfulness is an unpopular
 thing now."
 Honchar also appeared to aim a jibe at russified oblasts like
 Dnepropetrovsk, where Ukrainian literature is sometimes discriminated
 against.  He declared that Ukrainian literature enjoys aide popularity
 outside the Ukraine and is honored everywhere--"which, unfortunately,
 cannot be said about some of the oblasts of our own republic, where
 carelessness stubbornly shows itself, say, in the fitting out of
 children's, school and factory libraries." Dnepropetrovsk officials
 led the persecution of Honchar's "Sob or," and according to a
 purported April 1969 letter from a Ukrainian citizen published in
 the October 1969 emigre journal SUCHASNIST, there is a ban on "Sobor"
 in Dnepropetrovsk oblast.
 In another instance of Dnepropetrovsk leaders' support of a hard
 line, Dnepropetrovsk ;ity First Secretary A. A. Ulanov, a foe of
 Honchar,* wrote an article published 12 March 1970 in Moscow's
 SOVIET CULTURE defending interference in art and telling of a
 new crackdown on Dnepropetrovsk theaters.
 That Honchar's views enjoy a measure of party support seems apparent
 from the publication of his long speech not only in LITERATURNA
 UKRAINA but also--fully--in the Ukrainian Central Committee organ
 RADYANSKA UKRAINA on 10 April 1970.
 HONCHAR CRITIC    Moderates apparently could take some satisfaction
 UNDER ATTACK      from the misfortune of one of their most outspoken
 critics, Oleksiy Poltoratskiy, who wars subjected
 to criticism by fellow-conservatives.   On 24 April a meeting of the
 Writers Union board presidium was held to discuss the work of the
 journal VSESVIT, which publishes foreign literature in Ukrainian.
 A meeting of the Writers Union party committee shortly before had
 made "serious criticisms" of the work of chief editor Poltoratskiy
 and of the journal's party organization and editorial collegium.
 Zbanatskiy, who delivered the 24 April report, berated VSESVIT for
 printing works of "second-rate foreign writers" and works "of
 doubtful value by adherents of modernistic trends," as well as
 novels and stories of "low ideological-artistic quality."  Its

 poetry selections were "even worse," and its political. articles
 "lack aggressiveness" (LITERATURNA UIRAINA, 28 April 1970).
 Poltoratskiy acknowledged the criticism as "correct and timely."
 Writers Union party committee secretary Yakiv Bash called for
 more interference in the work of VSESVIT by the journal's party
 organization as well as by the Writers Union leadership.  Four
 members of VSESVIT's editorial board accused Poltoratskiy of
 running the journal singlehandedly.  Even conservative Kozachenko
 criticized Poltoratskiy's "mistakes" and "loss of a high sense
 of demandingness."
 Although there was no indication that Poltoratskiy would lose his
 post, the notably severe treatment of him personally suggests
 that he was the victim, of infighting.  VSESVIT had been criticized
 in the past for poor ideological standards in choosing works for
 publication--an occupational hazard in a journal reprinting
 noncommunist literature.  But the present criticism is more
 serious.  It appears to stem from the January 1970 Writers Union
 board plenum on "international ties of Ukrainian literature."
 Plenum keynoter Zahrebelnyy, who has himself been attacked by
 conservatives in the past, noted VSESVIT's popularity and its many
 awards but criticized its "mistakes and its "inconsistent" attitude
 toward representatives of "bourgeois modernism" (LITERATURNA
 UKRAINA, 16 January 1970).  At the plenum, Poltoratskiy defended
 his choice of foreign works presented in his journal--noting, for
 example, that in mid-1968 "we were reproached" for publishing
 Remarque, yet soon afterward PRAVDA itself described Remarque
 as a "talented antifascist writer" (LITERATURNA UKRAINA,
 20 January).

 PRC  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 REBUILDING OF PARTY STRUCTURE CONTINUES AT CAUTIOUS PACE
 PRC central and provincial radio reports suggest that the year-long
 campaign to rebuild the Chinese Communist Party into a disciplined
 organizational structure continues to make slight progress at the
 county level.  While central press editorials and RED FLAG articles
 have clearly asserted the authority of rebuilt party committees over
 established revolutionary committees, as well as the need to set party
 members apart from the masses, implementation has apparently been
 slowed by misunderstandings at the local level.
 A 19 April NCNA report which has recently become available cited a
 Harbin factory as a model for restoring party authority.  The report
 criticized members of mass organizations, including members of the
 Young Communist League (YCL), who act only "on Chairman Mao's teachings
 and the instructions of the party Central Committee" and do not comply
 with the decisions of the local party branch.  The party branch in the
 factory, the report said, organized study classes which taught that
 the party's authority, inspired by Mao's thought and leadership, "is
 carried out through party organizations" and that "we must obey the
 correct leadership of the party branch."  To aid the party branch in
 avoiding "doing whatever the masses want to do," which "harms the
 cause of the revolution," NCNA said the masses should be limited to
 regular meetings with party members once every two weeks.
 Provincial reports reflect central concern for establishing the
 correct relationship between :party units and mass organizations,
 while claiming that some progress is being made.  On 9 May Harbin
 radio reported that Wargkuei and Ningan counties had established
 new party committees; Heilungkiang had previously reported a county-
 level committee for Hulin county as well as one for the Hulin YCL.
 An article written by the Wangkuei party committee, arguing forcefully
 for improvement of the party's organizational discipline, claimed
 that in the rebuilding process it was necessary to criticize the
 incorrect idea" that "rebels win merits and have a chance to be
 admitted to the party" and that "whoever takes part in the three-
 in-one combination should join the party."  It added that standards
 for party membership should not be lowered and that activists
 applying for party membership should be judged according to the
 party constitution to insure "the fine quality of party members."
 All mass organizations must accept the concept that the party
 leadership is superior "and must be respected by everybody," it
 concluded.

 Hupeh, Chekiang and Kwangtung have now claimed one or more
 reconstructed county-level party committees.  Only Kwangtung
 has rebuilt a city-level committee.
