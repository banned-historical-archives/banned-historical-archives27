MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
Morning Meeting of 3 March 1969  
DD/I characterized Anatole Shub's article in the Sunday Washing-
ton Post on Soviet intentions regarding Berlin as rather dramatic and 
alarming and reported that he has asked to prepare a 25X1 
critique of the article today. 
*DD/I related that a draft brief for the Director's use in appearing 
before Congressman Pike's Pueblo subcommittee will be completed 
today. The Director asked the DD/I, Bross, Houston, and Maury to 
review the draft to determine whether it constitutes a sensible approach 
to the problem. The Director asked them to keep in mind the fact that 
all the subcommittee members with the exception of Congressman Bray 
are new to CIA. 
Godfrey noted that the results of the Chilean congressional elections 
were somewhat surprising in that, while the Christian Democrats lost 
some ground, the radicals, Communists, and Socialists did not make 
substantial gains. 
Godfrey reported they are puzzled that the ChiComs and Soviets 
are each publicizing their differences over the most recent ChiCom/ 
Soviet border dispute. He noted that there have been some 3,000 such 
incidents in the past. 
Godfrey reported that Berlin is essentially quiet, with traffic 
moving this morning. 
Godfrey reported that they have received word from State Depart-
ment Counselor Richard Pedersen that Agency support to the Secretary 
of State during the course of the President's trip was quite satisfactory. 
In response to the Director's question, D/ONE noted that USIB 
will meet on Thursday to consider SNIE 97-69, Peru and the U. S. --
The Implications of the IPC Controversy, and SNIE 13-69, Communist  
China and Asia.

Carver reported that Saigon was hit by rockets again last night. 
Carver noted the loss of to the North Vietnamese and led 
a brief discussion on the technical and political implications. DD/I 
characterized Ambassador Sullivan's message as perhaps overstating 
the significance of the event. 
Carver called attention to the Saigon station's follow-up message 
to MACV's cable regarding the turnover of Phoenix. 
Maury mentioned that today he will be receiving the text of 
Admiral Moorer's intended testimony before the Pike subcommittee. 
Maury noted that Saturday's briefing of Senators Jackson and 
McClellan went well and observed that, according to Senator Jackson, 
Senator McClellan now seems predisposed to support our position on 
the Ervin bill. The Director passed a "Well done" to all concerned 
and observed that Senator McClellan will return for additional briefings 
in the future. The Director observed that this was apparently Senator 
Jackson's first visit to Headquarters. 
Maury called attention to differences that exist between New York 
Times correspondent John Finney and Senator Jackson. The Director 
pointed to Finney's article in Sunday's New York Times regarding 
differences as perhaps contributing to Finney's uneasy conduct on the 
Meet the Press panel. 
Bross noted that he saw Admiral Taylor during the course of his 
recent leave. 
DD/S&T reported that they are doing a post-mortem analysis of 
Senator Jackson's remarks on Meet the Press, giving particular attention 
to the Senator's data on FOBS and on the ChiCom orientation of the pro-
jected ABM system.

expressed by General Phillip Davidson, MACV/J-2, and General

*The Director asked that DD/I analysts study the Nasser/Sulzberger 
interview as reported in yesterday's New York Times.

2 March noting the appearance of a book by Marshal Zhukov on Stalin's 
posture at the Potsdam Conference. He asked the DD/I to obtain a

effort to seek to document the state of their nuclear understanding.

The Director outlined Admiral Moorer's intended testimony before 
the Pike subcommittee and observed that Secretary Laird was recently 
aboard the Palm Beach to acquaint himself with Pueblo-type vessels. 
The Director noted the President's scheduled visit to Headquarters 
on 7 March. The Executive Director is organizing the necessary arrange-

that Goodwin decide where photographs are to be taken.

Nixton's Job Offer to Humphrey 
Included Wide Patron* Power 
By JOHN W. FINNEY 
Special to The New York Times 
WASHINGTON, March 1 ? 
President Nixon was willing to 
grant former Vice President 
Hubert H. Humphrey unusual 
patronage powers in the Repub-
lican Administration if the 
Democratic Presidential candi-
date had become United States 
Ambassador to the United Na-
tions. 
In ?offering the United Na-
tions job to his opponent short-
ly after the election, Mr. Nixon 
suggested the Democratic lead-
er would be free to pursue his 
own political ambitions, would 
have veto rights over appoint-
ment of Democrats to the Ad-
ministration and would have 
the right to nominate a cer-
tain number of persons to Gov-
ernment jobs. 
The offer was refused by 
Mr. Humphrey, largely because 
he felt he could pursue his 
own political interests and am-
bitions better outside the Ad-
ministration. The proposal, 
without parallel in modern po-
litical history, underscores, 
however, how far Mr. Nixon 
was willing to go in his de-
sire to establish an Adminis-
tration of "national unity" with 
bipartisan participation at the 
Cabinet level. 
Mr. Nixon, who during the 
campaign proclaimed his inten-
tion of bringing Democrats into 
his Administration, failed to 
find a prominent Democrat 
willing to serve in a Cabinet 
level job. But it has become 
apparent that in the immedi-
ate weeks following the elec-
tion, Mr. Nixon was willing to 
go to considerable political 
lengths to find a Democrat for

?,? 
THE NEW YORK TIMES, SUNDAY, MARCH .2, 196, 
NixonjobOffertoHumphreyClarified

his Cabinet. 
When Mr. Humphrey de-
clined the United Nations post, 
the President-elect unsuccess-
fully approached Sargent Shri-
ver, an in-law of the Kennedy' 
family, and then Senator Eu-
gene J. McCarthy. Meanwhile, 
Mr. Nixon was pressing Senator 
Henry M. Jackson, Democrat 
of Washington, to be Secretary 
of Defense. 
After declining the Pentagon 
post, Senator Jackson learned 
that if he had been interested 
in joining the Nixon Adminis-
tration he probably could have 
had the job of Secretary of 
State if he preferred that post 
to the Defense Department. 
The Nixon offer to Mr. Hum-
phrey, so politically generous 
that it momentarily interested 
the defeated Democratic can-
didate, was made during a 
meeting between the two at 
Opa-Locka, Fla., three days 
after the election, according to 
Humphrey associates. 
Mr. Nixon's offer of the 
United Nations post to Mr. 
Humphrey has become known, 
although never officially con-
firmed by either party. What 
has not been disclosed are the 
unusual political concessions 
that went with the offer. 
At the private, 30-minute 
meeting in an upstairs room in 
the Coast Guard operations of-
fice at the Opa-Locka Airport, 
the President-elect, after the 
customary political pleas-
antries, was reported to have 
made his offer and then gone 
on to add the following con-
ditions: 
As United Nations Ambassa-
dor, Mr. Humphrey would have 
Cabinet status and be consulted 
on all matters affecting for-
eign policy. 
Mr. Humphrey would have a 
veto power over all Democra-
tic appointments to the Govern-
ment, such as to regulatory 
agencies, thus, in effect, giving 
him control over Democratic 
patronage. 
Aside from this veto power, 
Mr. Humphrey would have the 
right to nominate an unspeci-
fied number of persons for Gov-
ernment jobs, with the implica-
tion that his nominations would 
be accepted by the Nixon Ad-
ministration, 
While serving in the Nixon 
Administration, Mr. Humphrey 
would be free to pursue his 
party activities, such as mak-
ing speeches to help repay the 
campaign debt of the Demo-
cratic party. 
The discussion then turned 
into a frank, intimate political 
talk between the two Presi-
dential candidates as they con-
sidered the possibility that they 
might be running against each 
other again in 1972. 
The talk was led by Mr. 
Nixon. Mr. Humphrey, on his 
way to a vacation in the Virgin 
Islands, was still depressed 
over his loss of the Presidency. 
Just the day before, on a stroll 
down a Washington street, he 
had confided to a friend "I 
was prepared to be President. 
I was prepared for the job. I 
knew what needs to be done." 
Appreciates Party Loyalty 
Despite their _political differ-
ences, there is considerable 
personal respect between the 
two men. In a personal, confi-
dential manner, therefore, Mr. 
Nixon said he appreciated that 
Mr. Humphrey still had per-
sonal political ambitions as well 
as obligations to help rebuild 
the Democratic party. 
The President-elect empha-
sized that Mr. Humphrey would 
be free to pursue his politi-
cal ambitions and to fulfill his 
obligations to his party. He 
then observed that it was pos-
sible that Mr. Humphrey would 
be his Presidential rival in 1972 
and that the United Nations 
job might help him politically 
in keeping him in the public 
limelight. 
"Tha is a risk I am prepared 
to take," the President-
elect was reported to have con-
fided to his defeated opponent. 
Mr. Humphrey did not im-
mediately reject the offer. His 
initial reservations were over 
the uncertainties of the Nixon 
Administration's foreign pol-
icy and over who would be 
Secretary of State, and thus 
his direct boss at the United 
Nations. 
These initial reservations 
were then overtaken by poli-
tical considerations. In finally 
rejecting the offer, Mr. Hum-
phrey was said to have con-
cluded that he could not remain 
as head of his party and leader 
of the loyal opposition, speak-
ing out on issues, if he took a 
job with the Nixon Adminis-
tration.

Zhukov, in Book Sold to British, 
Depicts Stalin at Potsdam Talks 
By HENRY RAYMONT 
Stalin, who reacted with ap- the British publishing house 
Macdonald and Co., Ltd. Mr. 
MacGibbon said in London he 
bought the rights for "a six-
figure dollar sum" in an un-
usual arrangement with Novosti

dent Truman informed him at 
the Potsdam conference in July, 
1945, that the United States 
possessed a new weapon of fear-
ful power, was in fact attempt- Press Agency, the Soviet fea-
ing to conceal the Soviet ture syndicate. 
Novosti has agreed to let 
Macdonald publish the book in 
its Russian version in London 
to establish copyright and has 
said that the Soviet Union 
would issue the book in Russian 
only after the English transla-
tion is published next year. 
Since the Soviet Union is not 
a member of the Berne Copy-
right Convention, its books nor-
mally pass into the public do-
main and are available to any-
one to translate. 
Under the agreement be-
tween Nervosa and Macdonald, 
Marshal Zhukov, who is 72 
years old, will add some pas-
sages for the English-language 
version, which is being trans-
lated by Prof. John Erickson, a 
military historian at Edinburgh 
University. 
Macdonald has offered the 
American book rights to sev-
eral United States publishing 
houses through its representa-
tive here, MTS. Rhoda Weyr, a 
literary agent. It is reported to 
have stipulated a minimum 
price of $200,000. 
Earlier efforts by Novosti to 
sell the book directly to pub-
lishers in the United States 
were unsuccessful. Publishing 
sources said the Soviet agency 
ha dasked $1.5-million to 
$2-million. 
Reached at his home in 
Edinburgh yesterday, Professor 
Erickson said Marshal Zhukov's 
book begins with his childhood 
in Moscow, tracing his quick 
rise in the Red Army through 
the border encounters against 
Japan, the crucial battle of 
Leningrad, and the defense of 
Moscow.

Union's own atomic bomb pro-
gram, according to a com-
mander of Soviet armed forces 
in World War II. 
The account of Stalin's re-
sponse is contained in the un-
published memoirs of Marshal 
Georgi K. Zhukov, the com-
mander, who accompanied Sta-
lin to Potsdam two weeks be-
fore the first American nuclear 
weapon was dropped on Hiro-
shima. 
Marshal Zhukov's version, 
which became available to The 
New York Times yesterday, 
suggests that Stalin was aware 
of the implications of Mr. Tru-
man's report and ordered the 
Soviet nuclear research pro-
gram to be accelerated. 
A Soviet physicist who 
worked in the program, Dr. 
Igor N. Golovin, disclosed in a 
history of the project published 
In 1966 that it had been accel-
erated after the United States 
had exploded its first bomb on 
July 16, 1945, near Alamo-
gordo, N.M. 
Mr. Truman said in his 
memoirs that "the Russian 
Premier showed no special in-
terest," and Prime Minister 
Winston S. Churchill wrote, 
later, "I was sure he [Stalin] 
had no idea of the significance 
of what he was being told." 
Marshal Zhukov indicates 
that the Soviet leader deliber-
ately appeared indifferent in 
an effort to conceal the Soviet 
Union's own research on the 
atomic bomb.

tion of our territory and as 
long as the United States 
supplies Israel with planes 
while it is occupying our ter-
ritory, there will be difficul-
ties, because if we resume re-
lations and Israel receives 
Phantoms, what will be the 
reaction? Receive Phantoms 
while occuping our territory? 
This means the United States 
encourages Israel to continue 
to occupy our territory. 
Q. Do you expect more 
from the Nixon Administra-
tion than its predecessor? 
Did the Scranton visit seem 
to encourage a better atmos-
phere? 
A. Of course, we hope so. 
Really, after the June war 
we faced a situation where 
the United States supported 
completely and 100 per cent 
the point of view of Israel. It 
was said by Governor Scran-
ton that he thinks the United 
States must have a more 
even-handed policy in deal-
ing with the. situation. That 
is to say, we want from the 
United States not to take 
sides. Not to take our side, 
but not to support the occu-
pation of our territory by Is-
rael. 
View of American Policy 
Q. Why is United States 
policy always viewed so neg-
atively? After all, in 1956 
we strongly opposed Britain, 
France and Israel, and in 
1967 we gave no active aid 
to Israel. 
A. We have great admira-
tion for President Eisenhow-
er and for Nixon. When Nix-
on visited us in 1963, he was 
out of politics but we re-
ceived him as Eisenhower's 
Vice President, although not 
as a President who will be 
elected. But of course people 
still look back today to the 
fact that there is Israeli oc-
cupation of our territory. No-
body could look at 1956 and 
forget what happened in 
1967-68. 
Q. Do you foresee a fourth 
round of war? 
A. This is a very simple 
question. We are striving to 
end the occupation of Arab 
territory - in Egypt, Jordan 
and Syria by a political so-
lution ? by peaceful means. 
If we don't achieve it by 
peaceful means, what result? 
We must strive by other 
means to achieve it. One 
could not accept occupation 
of his country by aggressive 
armed force. One has to fight. 
Q. Do you feel there is 
danger of a nuclear explo-
sion in the Middle East? 
A. As long as they don't 
sign the nonproliferation 
treaty, there is danger. We 
have signed it. But if they 
begin, there will be a race 
also. If they tried to build 
nuclear weapons, we would 
try to have our own. We 
have the capacity but what 
we need is the investment 
money required for produc-
tion. I do not believe the Is-
raelis have such weapons 
now. 
Cairo's Terms for Peace 
Q. Would you spell out (A) 
the short-range and (B) the 
long-range terms for peace. 
A. When I speak of a set-
tlement I don't mean ? short-
term and long-term. If we 
solve the problem of the oc-
The New York Times 
C. L. Sulzberger with President Gamal Abdel Nasser as the Arab leader commented on problems Pacing the Middle East 
cupied territory and of the 
refugees from Palestine, this 
will result in a peaceful set-
tlement in spite of what took 
place during the last 20 or 
more years. But if we solve 
only the problem of the oc-
cupied territory but neglect 
the other part, there will be 
no peace. 
According to the U.N. 
1948, 1949 and 1966 Assem-
blies, there were resolutions 
for the right of Palestinians 
to return back to their own 
land. But this was neglected 
completely by the Israelis 
and this is the main part of 
the problem. The Israelis have 
expelled more than one mil-
lion Arabs ? Christians and 
Moslems. They wanted a 
country based on Judaism. If 
they accept refugees and 
evacuate conquered areas, 
there will be lasting peace. 
Q. What would be the ba-
sis for this Jewish-Arab state 
in Palestine? 
A. After the war of 1948, 
there were resolutions in the 
United Nations according 
to Arab refugees expelled by 
Israeli terrorists the right to 
return to their own land. 
Now they are outside be-
cause Israel refused; and 
they want to return back to-
their own land. This is the 
reason for the fedayeen 
movement. They are mostly 
the children of those expelled 
in 1948 and who wish to re-
turn. The man who was killed 
by the Israelis in the recent 
Zurich airport raid was born 
in Haifa and expelled. 
This is the main problem 
?the right of the Palestin-
ians in their own land. They 
lived there for thousands of 
years and now they are ex-
pelled. Sirhan was expelled 
from his home and village 
and went to the United 
States; and he has the de-
sire to return to his own 
land. Without fulfillment of 
such claims, this problem 
will continue for tens of 
years. 
'The Right to Return' 
Q. How do you conceive 
of an Israel with the refugees 
returned: a larger state? 
A. I don't mean that Is-
rael should gain part of our 
Arab territory and then say 
in exchange it would accept 
Arabs. But certainly those ex-
pelled have the right to re-
turn back to their homeland. 
Q. Would you want the 
1967 U.N. resolution frontier? 
That is to say, the June 1, 
1967 borders? 
A. Nobody will accept the 
expansion of Israel because 
if this is permitted, it would 
merely be a step to achieve 
the dreams of some of the 
leaders of Israel to have Is-
raeli territory expand be-
tween the Nile and the Eu-
phrates. Yes, we would take 
the June 1, 1967, frontiers. 
Q. What might be the in-
fluence of Eshkol's death? 
Could there be a succession 
contest of hawks versus 
doves in Israel? 
A. I don't believe there are 
hawks and doves there. Some 
people like to speak diplo-
matic language like Abba 
Eban. They say he is a dove. 
Yet last week he was for 
continuation of the occupa-
tion of Arab territory. You 
say he is a dove? There are 
no real differences and I 
don't think there will be any 
change. 
Q. What do you think of 
Eisenhower's formula for in-
stalling several large nuclear 
plants in the general area of 
Palestine in order to desalt 
water for irrigation and pro-
vide power for industry in 
new settlements which could 
be developed by Palestinian 
refugees? 
A. I will tell you some-
thing. We gave great atten-
tion to these statements by 
General Eisenhower and 
those by President Johnson, 
and we tried to have con-
tact between American offi-
cials and our Government 
and American enterprises and 
our Government to put these 
ideas into effect in our coun-
try. All were without any re-
sult. The last contact took 
place two months ago. 
But what happened after 
the ideas of General Eisen-
hower were only statements. 
We need water for our des-
erts, but there is no attempt 
to put that into effect We 
could not neglect the rest of 
the problem and deal with 
it from this point of view 
only. The idea of nationalism, 
the Palestine problem, the 
people who want to return 
to their homeland ? this is 
our character and our inheri-
tance, and we cannot separ-
ate it from other approaches. 
Jews in the Arab States 
Q. What is your view of 
the position of Jews now re-
siding in Arab states? What 
is the status of the Jewish 
community in Egypt? Are the 
Jews now in Egypt free to 
leave if and when they wish? 
A. First of all, I want to 
speak about the question of 
the Baghdad hangings. I am 
sorry to say that the press 
of all the Western countries 
tried to visualize the ques-
tion as the hanging of Jews. 
It was not hanging of Jews; 
it was hanging of spies. Some 
were Moslems, some Arab, 
some Christian. It was not a 
hanging of Jews. After that, 
the second time, there was 
the hanging of Moslems only. 
But these were spies. It was 
the hanging not of Moslems, 
Christians, Jews, but of spies. 
We have here about 5,000 
Jews. We have about 100 
under arrest because they 
are Zionists and are in con-
tact with Israel and put un-
der arrest after the war. 
Those who want to leave the 
country can leave, and many 
got permission to leave the 
country. The rest live as 
Egyptians and have all rights. 
The Israelis are creating 
propaganda against that. Yes-
terday I was reading a re-
port about the visit of the 
Red Cross in Gaza. Six hun-
dred Arabs were in the pris-
ons of Gaza. Of course, if we 
speak about the rest of the 
occupied territory, there will 
be thousands under arrest by 
the Israelis for reasons of se-
curity. We also arrest for 
the security of our country. 
Q. Given the present sit-
uation, do you think that 
Jews in the Arab world ought 
not only to be permitted but 
perhaps even encouraged to 
emigrate? 
A. The Jews are our cous-
ins. Moses was born in Egypt. 
Don't stress this. I don't want 
it to be an Israeli claim. 
They say we are anti-Semitic, 
which is nonsense. We are 
Semites ourselves. We look 
upon Jews in our country as 
Egyptians, The Jews who 
live in the Arab countries 
feel it will be always more 
suitable for them to live in 
Arab countries rather than to 
go to other countries. Theft 
fathers and grandfathers 
lived here for thousands of 
nyeatairosn.without any discrimi-
Q. What is your attitude 
toward Al Fatah? I have 
heard this described as both 
favorable and unfavorable. 
A. I admire them. As a 
man, I admire, them because 
they are fighting for their 
rights. They waited for 20 
years looking to the world 
to regain for them their de-
prived rights. Now they are 
fighting for these rights. I 
think everyone must agree 
with them because they have 
to fight. I admire them as 
we admired the resistance 
movements which took place, 
for example, in Europe and 
the Philippines during the 
Second World War, 
Q. Don't you think there 
is a danger that Al Fatah 
may politically take over the 
Government of Jordan or 
other Arab states? 
A. I am sure the Fatah 
movement has as one of its 
main principles not to inter-
fere with the internal affairs 
of any of the Arab countries 
like Jordan or Syria. It con-
centrates on planning on the 
Palestine question and how 
Palestinians can end the oc-
cupation and achieve their 
rights in their homeland. ' 
Q. Do you still feel there 
should ultimately be one sin-
gle Arab state, a kind of fed-
eration of Pan-Arabism? It 
seems to me that comparable 
ideas, such as the Pan-Turk-
ish and Pan-Slavic move-
ments, never worked; do you 
think that present circum-
stances in the Arab world 
favor such a concept? 
A. I think when the Arabs 
realize that unity and feder-
ation will be in their own 
interests and strength, this 
will help to achieve the ob-
ject of Arab unity. It is not 
an easy question because of 
the contradictions politically 
and socially. These contradic-
tions remain to be liquidated. 
People of all Arab countries 
want unity, but how to ful-
fill it is not an easy ques-
tion. It can best be started by 
unity between two or three 
countries ? by federation or 
confederation. 
Ties With Syria Affirmed 
Q. At one time Syria was 
a member of the U.A.R. but 
this did not work. 
A. I accepted that union 
in spite of myself. I was not 
convinced that the time was 
Nasser Foresees Fourth Round of War Unless Israelis Pull Back 
Continued From Page 1, Col. 2 
histrionics in an interview at his 
residence today on the eve of 
the Moslem holiday period of 
Bairam, in which Id el Adha, 
the Feast of the Mutton, is cel-
ebrated. 
It was most informal. He 
wore slacks and a short-sleeve 
shirt with open collar. We sat 
around a table, sipping Turkish 
coffee, along with Mohammed 
Hassanein Heykal, Mr. Nasser's 
close friend and editor of Al 
Ahram, the Arab world's larg-
est newspaper. 
The President spoke easily and 
patiently for two hours, cover-
ing a wide range of topics. The 
meeting took place in a salon 
often used as a waiting room, 
outside his presidential office. 
On the mantle and atop tables 
were the many signed portraits, 
ranging from Nehru, Tito and 
Prince Sihanouk to a colored 
drawing of Lyndon B. Johnson, 
with an inscription exxpressing 
the hope for good relations. 
Willing to Resume Ties 
The conversation started on 
that subject. Mr. Nasser ex-
pressed readiness to resume 
diplomatic relations with the 
United States?which he sev-
ered in June, 1967, but made 
it clear that serious difficulties 
existed, since the United States 
was selling Phantom jets to 
Israel while her forces occupied 
conquered Egyptian territory. 
ffiFI,"NM.E   
uudncLeqFx-Anfisp igLi,irmA? 
courages Israel to continue to 
occupy our territory." 
He thought that the Johnson 
Administration had "supported 
completely and 100 per cent 
the point of view of Israel" 
but hoped that the Nixon Ad-
ministration would be, as he 
saw the situation, less partial. 
"We want from the United 
States not to take sides," the 
Egyptian President said. "Not 
to take our side, but not to 
support the occupation of our 
territory by Israel." 
As might be expected, a good 
part of the interview was taken 
up with the Arab world's most 
burning question ? the per-
sistent if intermittent Palestine 
war. 
Mr. Nasser said he did not 
think that Israel had any 
atomic weapons. But he 
warned: 
"As long as they [the Israel-
is] don't sign the nonprolifera-
tion treaty, there is danger. We 
have signed it. If they tried to 
build nuclear weapons, we 
would try to have our own. 
We have the capacity but what 
we need is the investment mon-
ey required for production." 
Fears Israel's Expansion 
President Nasser professed 
to be convinced that Israel, if 
permitted to retain any of her 
1967 conquests, would some 
day again seek to expand, aim-
ing at a realization of "the 
dreams of some of the leaders 
of Israel to have Israeli terri-
tory expand between the Nile 
[OLA GX auci p6fM6GIJ fpG 14116 
Ili rn iirt, n 
Government has denied such 
an idea. 
Mr. Nasser did not think 
that the death this week of 
Premier Levi Eshkol would 
have any effect on the situa-
tion. He made it clear that he 
regarded all Israeli leaders?an 
therefore Mr. Eshkol's ultimate 
successor?as hawks. 
The President showed re-
strained interest in the Eisen-
hower-Strauss plan to construct 
large nuclear plants in the pal-
estinian area?both Israeli and 
Arab?to provide desalted sea 
water, power industry and jobs, 
hoping to absorb many of the 
Arab refugees. The plan was 
advanced in 1957 by President 
Eisenhower and his Secretary 
of Commerce, Lewis L. Strauss. 
He said that Washington did 
not respond to his "contacts" 
on this ? the last but two 
months ago; anyway he thought 
the program could not be con-
sidered practical while the 
frontier and refugee issues re-
mained unresolved. 
Says Jews May Leave 
Mr. Nasser insisted that Jews 
n the United Arab Republic 
were treated as Egyptians 
with "all rights" and were free 
to emigrate if they wished?
a statement that is contested 
by foreign observers. 
He reckoned that there were 
about 5,000 Jews in Egypt, of 
whom about 100 were under ar-
rest "because they are Zionists 
and are in contact with Israel." 
He insisted that in the Gaza 
Strip ? a segment of former 
Israel-600 Arabs were in pri-
son for security reasons. 
Mr. Nasser thought it silly 
to talk of anti-semitism in the 
Arab world because: "the Jews 
are our cousins. Moses was 
born in Egypt. Don't stress this. 
Don't want it to be an Israeli 
claim. They say we are anti-
semitio, which is nonsense. We 
are Semites ourselves." 
He criticezed Western reac-
tion to the hanging of nine 
Jews in Iraq on Jan. 27. 
"It was not hanging og of 
Jews," he said, "it was hang-
ing of spies. Some were Mos-
lems, some Arab, some Chris-
tian." 
Admiration for Al Fatah 
Asked about reports of dis-
sension between Cairo and Al 
Fatah, the principal Palestin-
ian guerrilla organization, Mr. 
Nasser said: "I admire them 
as we admired the resistance 
movements which took place, 
for example, in Europe and 
the Philippines during the sec-
ond World War." 
He expressed confidence that 
Al Fatah would not interfere 
in the internal, affairs of any 
Arab country. 
Mr. Nasser said that, al-
though Soviet naval vessels 
often visit Egyptian ports, there 
were none here at the moment 
and that no military bases on 
his territory had been granted 
to any foreign country. He as-
serted that there wer probably 
fewer than 1,000 Russian tech-
nicians and training personnel 
otian-held terntopti, in' _.4g 
E bc!so-pGiq AP tg9W- F eefiF 
Cairo diplomats?and added, 
"But I am asking for more." 
The President also said that 
while Moscow had sent in large 
arms shipments to make up for 
losses in 1967, the United Arab 
Republic has not at this date 
exceeded its prewar weapons 
strength. 
Worried About Arms Ban 
"That is why we are parti-
ularly worried about state-
ments in Western countries 
that they want to ban arms 
entering this area," Mr. Nasser 
said. "The meaning of an Arms 
ban would be that Israel will 
have superiority . . . in both 
army and air force, while we 
won't get the opportunity to 
replace what we lost . . . this 
would put Israel in a superior 
position and encourage it to 
continue occupation of Arab 
territories." 
On other subjects, Mr. Nas-
ser did not believe that there 
was any unusual power con-
test in the Kremlin now. "At 
the top," he said, "there is al-
ways a power contest in every 
country.' 
He thought that his revolu-
tion had evolved its own par-
ticular ideology, which he de-
scribed as a "socialist commun-
ity" and that it had made great 
strides in improving living stan-
dards. Moscow, he said, had 
given much aid by financing 
and helping to construct the 
Aswan High Dam and a steel 
041tPgpililegotatIs84Ah68lifgdod 
11 lin I 611 I rnm ? 
? ripe for union. I said to the 
Syrians that I don't know Sy-
ria. In order to have unity, 
politicians must know each 
other. I thought we needed 
five years, but they insisted. 
But we now have coopera-
tion with Syria in all fields. 
Q. What rights does the 
Soviet Navy have in Alexan-
dria, Port Said and Port 
Suez? 
A. We don't have any base 
in our country for any for-
eign country. Of course, the 
Soviets were visiting our 
ports before the aggression 
against our country and they 
visit our ports also now. 
However, no single ship is 
here right now. We don't 
have any ships now in Alex-
andria; but they visit us ev-
ery now and then. We wel-
come visits because the So-
viet Union helped us after 
the aggression, they helped 
us in the United Nations and 
they supplied us with arms 
after we lost our arms. 
Q. How many Soviet mili-
tary training personnel and 
technicians are there today 
in the U.A.R.? 
A. Really, I don't know 
the figure, but I am asking 
for more technicians. 
Q. Is it a large figure? 
five thousand? 
A. It is less than 5,000. 
You know, it is probably 
even less than 1,000. But I 
am asking for more. 
Q. Does the U.A.R. have 
greater military, air and na-
val strength now than on 
June 1, 1967? 
A. Of course, we are try-
ing to rebuild our armed 
forces and, of course, we 
have new arms now instead 
of the older arms which were 
lost during 1967. Also we 
have acquired other material. 
But I could not say we have 
exceeded what there was in 
1967. 
That is why we are par-
ticularly worried about state-
ments in Western countries 
that they want to ban arms 
entering this area. The mean-
ing of an arms ban would be 
that Israel will have superior-
ity in both army and air 
force, while we won't get 
the opportunity to replace 
what we lost. We are wor-
ried because this would leave 
the Israeli's Phantoms from 
the United States and tanks 
from the United Kingdom 
while we attempt to rebuild. 
This would put Israel in a 
superior position and encour-
age it to continue occupa-
tion of Arab territories. 
Condition of the Economy 
Q. What is the economic 
situation of the U.A.R. today 
and has the Aswan Dam had 
any effect on the standard 
of living? When the dam was 
first started you told me the 
population was increasing so 
rapidly that at its optimum, 
the dam would only keep 
the standard of living at the 
level it then was. Is this the 
way things have worked out? 
A. No. The standard of liv-
ing rose because the increase 
in the economy's annual 
growth rate was about 6.5 
per cent from 1960. The in-
crease of population was 2.8 
per cent. This makes a differ-
ence of about 3.7 per cent. 
Last year and this year we 
were not able to achieve this 
same level because of the 
conditions of occupation and 
the shifting of part of our 
budget to defense invest-
ment. But we think that we 
could increase the national 
economy every year by 7 per 
cent ? not only by agricul-
ture but by industry. 
Q. What is your feeling 
about recent speculation that 
there is a power contest at 
the top in the U.S.S.R. to-
day? 
A. I will tell you something 
from my experience. At the 
top, there is always a power 
contest in every country. This 
is my experience. There are 
always differing points of 
view and ideas in the top 
everywhere. I think in ev-
ery country there is a power 
contest. I don't know about 
the United States. 
Really, I read press art-
icles from the Western coun-
tries on Russia, but I don't 
think it is like that Last 
July I met Brezhnev and Ko-
sygin and Podgorny, and we 
discussed and were able to 
agree about many questions. 
Shelepin later came here and 
he spent about 10 days and 
told me he would return and 
give a report to Brezhnev. I 
think in Western countries 
they exaggerate these ques-
tions. There are always some 
differences in governments 
Take Israel. Under Eshkol, 
there were Dayan and Esh-
kol. At the top, there is al-
ways some difference. 
Matters of First Concern 
Q. What is your feeling 
about the so-called Brezhnev 
doctrine ? the right of Mos-
cow to intervene in other so-
cialist countries? Tito says he 
is very much opposed to this 
and I know you have a high 
regard for Tito. 
A. I will tell you some-
thing. As long as the Israelis 
are occupying our country, 
we are not concerned with 
these questions. I am speak-
ing to you frankly. Our main 
problem is the Israeli occupa-
tion of the Arab countries 
and how we can work to get 
rid of it either politically or 
by any other means. 
Q. Do you intend to invite 
General de Gaulle to visit 
Cairo or do you have any in-
tention of visiting Paris? 
A. No, we have no plans 
for that. But I am sure that 
Ezvptian 
90 people -would 
24=2 ? ?  
de Gaulle to our country at 
any time. 
Q. I remember in your 
book, "Philosophy of the 
Revolution," you discussed 
the three linked circles of 
Arabism, Islam and Africa. 
Have you made any progress 
along this philosophical line? 
A. I think it is progressing. 
We have better relations with 
the Arab countries. We are 
sending delegations to the 
Moslem countries. You know 
how the Moslems look to Je-
rusalem as a sacred city. We 
have contacts with all the 
African countries who sup-
ported us when Israel occu-
pied our territory. I would 
add to that: not only African 
countries, but also Asian 
countries. 
At the time the "Philoso-
phy of the Revolution" was 
published, there were only 
three independent coun-
tries in Africa. Now there 
are more than 30. We have 
an African unity organization 
which has its center in Addis 
Ababa. There is a Moslem 
congress next month in Ma-
laysia, and you know the 
Arab League is now strong-
er. After that there were 
many Arab meetings of the 
Kings and the Presidents. 
The Nasser Ideology 
Q. You have told me in 
the past that you have no 
ideology as such, that you 
are pragmatic rather than 
dogmatic. Have you by now 
developed an ideology and 
could you describe this to 
me a bit? 
A. We met the last time 
in 1963. In 1962 there was 
a Charter and the principle 
of the ideas of development 
in our society and our cul-
ture was published in May, 
1962. Our line for develop-
ment after that was clearer 
than before. 
Q. Could you describe this? 
A. We don't describe it as 
socialist democracy, but as 
a "socialist community." Peo-
ple base their lives on social-
ism. Democracy, according 
to the charter, is freedom 
for the community and free-
dom of the individual, but it 
ends exploitation of the indi-
vidual. The result was na-
tionalization in 1961. 
Q. Forgive me for saying 
this, but it seems to me that 
you have an unusual talent 
for turning defeat into vic-
tory and for climbing out of 
pits. What is the secret? 
A. You know, I believe 
that I am a lucky man in 
spite of the catastrophe we 
face now. On the other hand, 
I don't plan it. It is natural. 
After the defeat, I was will-
ing to leave. But you know 
when I said that I was self-
ish. I was trying to escape, 
but I was not able to. 
Nobody was informed of 
my intention except three 
men. I was really intending 
to leave. I was very tired 
and sick. But now it is over. 
When I went to Khartoum, 
all the people came to the 
streets and I could not for-
get what was said in one of 
the magazines: "Hail the con-
quered." To be conquered is 
not a determined issue, but 
to surrender is. I am not go-
ing to surrender. I believe 
in God. I am a fatalistic man. 
I believe in His will. I don't 
plan for any of these crises. 
Q. Who most influenced 
the shape of your life and 
philosophy ? what person 
during your lifetime or what 
historical figure? 
A. Of course, I was influ-
enced by Mohammed and 
also by Jesus. I believe in 
both of them. Did you know 
that we believe in Christ 
also? I think many people in 
our country are influenced 
by him. 
No Longer Plays Tennis 
Q. Is there a more con-
temporary figure who had an 
influence on you? 
A. I think the most effec-
tive man was Gen. Aziz el-
Massa I admired him when 
I was a young officer. He 
fought for independence, in-
sisted on independence. I met 
him many times before the 
revolution and after the rev-
olution until his death. He 
was appointed in the army 
as a general. He was in Tur-
key during the First World 
War and then he came to 
Egypt, and he was not in 
the army except for a period 
during the Second World 
War. 
Q. What are your hobbies 
nowadays; do you still play 
tennis? 
A. No. You know my leg 
was not well last year. I can-
not play tennis. The recom-
mendations of the doctor was 
not to have hard sports but 
to walk. Now I have returned 
to being normal, because last 
year I was not well. But I 
walk generally before lunch. 
During the winter it is bet-
ter to dip it before lunch. 
Q. Do you watch movies a 
lot still? 
A. Yes, but not as much as 
before. Only about once a 
week. When I see a film, I 
begin about 11 o'clock or 
midnight. I have so many 
meetings until then. 
Q. Do you read? 
A. Last year I was not 
able to read a lot, but now 
I am regaining my capacity 
to work as before, so I read 
more books. In the last few 
days I have been reading a 
book by Mao Tse-tung by a 
Canadian author. I can read 
some more now because we 
are starting a holiday. 
Q. What is your dream 
that Egypt will be in 25 
years' time ? both in terms 
of its internal society and 
its external world position? 
A. You know, during the 
last 17 years we were not 
able to fultill all our dreams 
because of the continuous 
problems: the occupation, the 
aggression of 1956, and so 
on. My main dream is to de-
velop this country. To have 
electricity in each village and 
have work for every man. 
We have work for every man 
in spite of many problems ? 
the increase of the popula-
tion by one million per year. 
We must have an. increase 
in order to have jobs for 
one-half a million every year. 
This year we will have elec-
tricity in 300 villages. We 
have surplus electricity and 
water because now we have 
the water of the High Dam, 
which will help in land re-
form. 
We don't have money for 
investment. We want also to 
use this electricity, and we 
have a committee of Soviet 
experts which handed us rec-
ommendations for using sur-
plus electricity of the High 
Dam. We also want to devel-
op the nhosphate and ferti-
lizer industry. We are going 
into heavy industry. We are 
building steel mills to give a 
production of one million tons 
of steel with a loan from the 
Soviet Union. The first phase 
will end by 1972 
We have to encourage in-
vestment in industry. This is, 
of course, my dream. I want 
to see this coubtry without 
servants before my death. 
Now it is difficult for people 
to find servants. And 
this always-increasing prob-
lem about getting servants 
means an increasing standard 
of living. 
'No Personal Life' 
Q. You are still quite a 
young man (52)t what is your 
dream for your own person 
in 25 years? Is there any-
thing out of the realm of po-
litical life you would like to 
have achieved by that time?
such as writing a book or 
painting a picture? 
A. I have no personal 
dreams. I have no personal 
life. I have nothing personal. 
Many people may not be-
lieve that, but this is the 
truth. 
Q. What would you consid-
er as your greatest success 
and greatest failure? 
A. You know, as I told 
you, I velieve in God; I am 
a fatalistic man. I believe 
that life is a combination of 
success and failure. It could 
not be comprised of only suc-
cess. Look at history. I have 
to accept failure. I have to 
do my best in order to change 
failure to success. I think 
the main success was the suc-
cess of the revolution, the 
success of the 23d of July, 
1952. I don't think that our 
defeat by Israel is a failure. 
I believe it will be followed 
by success. 
My biggest mistake? Our 
life is full of mistakes. Al-
ways there are mistakes. 
There are many mistakes. I 
cannot really see something. 
Daily we have mistakes.

Bross reported that recently received 
a detailed briefing on DIA s information handling system and noted the 
progress which DIA is making in this field. 
DD/S&T reported that he will attend a Defense Science Board 
briefing on the Sentinel system next Tuesday. 
Executive Director reported receipt of a telephone call last night 
from Hugh Sloan advising that the White House will abide by our wishes 
that no pictures be taken in the auditorium during the course of the 
President's visit tomorrow. The Director asked the Executive Director 
to walk him through the President's schedule today or tomorrow. 
The Director briefed on his several observations growing out of 
attendance at the President's briefing of Congressional leaders on his 
recent European trip. 
The Director briefed on yesterday's NSC meeting, noting that it 
was exclusively confined to the Sentinel problem, with Secretary Packard 
personally and ably presenting DOD material. The Director observed 
that following Secretary Packard's presentation BOB Director Mayo 
lucidly remarked on the cost of the program. The Director suggested 
that, given Mayo's perceptibility, we should be well prepared for hard 
questions from this quarter. 
The Director thanked those who participated in preparing the text 
of his testimony yesterday and asked that similar careful attention be 
given to responding to additional questions growing out of the hearing. 
The Director summarized his response to the questions raised with 
respect to the role of the 303 Committee and Senator Symington's release 
of the Director's letter. The Director noted his reservations concerning 
the value of those testifying as to the "tremendous loss" in terms of 
damage done to the intelligence collection effort. 
The Director noted, 
however, that he did have an opportunity to converse with General 
Westmoreland, who made it clear that he had not requested the 206,000 
troops as reported in today's New York Times.

Then came a series of signal events: 
Senator Eugene J. McCarthy scored a :.? 
stunning upset in the New Hampshire - 
.Democratic primary on March 1. Ameri-
can dead and wounded in Vietnam ' 
reached 139,801 ? exceeding over-all' 
? Korean-War losses. American and West- ' ? 
ern European bankers held an emer-
gency meeting in Washington to stem , 
the run of gold as the price soared.1 
;Senator Robert F. Kennedy announced 
on March 16 that he would seek the; 
Democratic Presidential nomination... 
,All this formed the backdrop for the) . 
'most delicate argument of all ? that't 
,  
:about the bombing. 
On March 15, Arthur 3. Goldberg', the 
fAmerican representative at the United 
Nations, sent an eight-page memo to the 
President urging him to halt the' bomb- ? 
1 Mg to get negotiations started. ' ' , 
. Others in the Administration favored'? 
such a step?Mr. Katzenbach and Am-
bassador-at-Large W. Averell Harriman, 
among them?but it was Ambassador.,'I 
, Goldberg, increasingly frustrated by his 
,.?sense of powerlessness on the Vietn'arry 
; issue, who dared brook the President's' 
. anger by raising the issue directly.',: 
, . 
Few officials knew he had done so. Hel 
t drafted the memo himself .and sent it 
labeled "For the President's Eyes Only.",,N 
Copies were given to Secretaries, Rusit, 
? ;.?and Clifford, and Mr. Rostow, ?as 'the 
?;,President's aide, sass it in due course,1 
? (hut Mr. Goldberg discussed it with none?; 
.;? of them. ? 
, Still others, including Assistant Secre-,F 
' tary of State Bundy, favored waiting for,, 
i?several weeks on the ground that 
.:another enemy offensive might be near. -? 
-1 A day after the Goldberg memo ar-1;; 
:rived, the subject came up in Mr. John-
son's inner circle. The President, his i.z.? 
:patience sorely ?tested, sat up in ? his) , 
chair and said: ? ." , ? ? ;:,??
