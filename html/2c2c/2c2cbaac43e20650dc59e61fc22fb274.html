 (Mar. 31-Apr. 6, 1952)
 SUMMARY
 .Broadcasts to the Chinese people during  he week ending Apr. 6 shoved unmistakably, both
 %uantitatively and in subject matter, that the anticorruption drive was being brought to an end
 as rapidly as corruption eases could be settled. A statistical survey of regional.broadcasts
 disclosed that 703 news items were contained in the 148 clear news
 programs monitored from 21
 regional stations.  Of this total, 162'items, approximately  3 percent, had to do with the
 anticorruption drive,  This compares with 42 percent devoted to the drive in the week ending
 Max a 9, with 58 percent in a survey made Feb. 21+, And with 63 percent Feb. 10 a  AiiAZer subject
 now has taken, precedence over the drive, for during the week 232 news its, approximately 33
 percent of the total, were devoted to agriculture -- spring cultivation., drought prevention,
 production quotas, irrigation, insect control, and so forth.
 Reports of confession and accusation meetings still were broadcast.  However, the main p    se
 of the meetings apparently was to wring confessions from businessmen who already had bee   ccused
 and therefore must confess in order to be pardoned.  Pardons were granted at most of the'
 meetings., although many victims were arrested because they stubbornly refused to admit their
 guilt.  A secondary aim of'the meetings seemingly was to get businessmen who had been pardoned
 or given lenient treatment to join more wholeheartedly in the five-anti's drive against bigger
 and more corrupt businessmen-the 5 percent mentioned by the Shanghai :'Promises of reward for all-out effort to ey              Mayor the previous week.
 xpose corruption during the drive were being fulfilled.
 The special People's Tribunals suggested the previous week by Peking were organized in numerous
 places for rapid adjudication of corruption cases.  The East China Military and     nistrative
 Committee even went further and set up a "Tribunal Inspection Committee" to supervise the work of
 the People's Tribunals.  Another new tool for rapid adjudication was adopted by Tientsin in'the
 form of a "technical committee" to study cases appealed from the Austerity Committee, make
 recommendations, and assemble "technical data," such as "statements of accounts," to be used as
 evidence.
 In spite of severe, punishment meted out to some offenders, broadcasts also reported some astounding
 instances of leecy.  One Hangchow businessman was pardoned when he confessed.`to corruption
 amounting to 83o million Yuan and refunded. the money.  Other evidence of appeasement of

 onfessions and Accusations.        Dairen reported (Apr. 2) that local hardware shop clerks were
 romoting the anticorruption drive by exposing corrupt merchants.  Hardware merchant Chou
 ning-wu at first refused to confess, because he did not believe that his brother, Chou
 ei-Chien, had exposed him.         Hardware merchant Li Kuo-thing refused to confess until he was
 Kposed by his accountant, Cheng Chi-vu.  Tsinan announced (Mar. 31) that several persons were
 ardoned after they made full confessions and returned their embezff1ed funds at a rally of the
 3inan branch of the China Department Store. Two corrupt elements were arrested when they
 Bfused to confess.  Tsinan added (Apr. 4) that the Government in Hsite Hsien,_Shantung,
 ailed a rally Mar. 30, when several corrupt elements were pardoned following confessions,
 file those who refused to confess were arrested.
 aanghai announced (Apr. 1) that 3,000 persons attended a rally called liar. 31 by the Shanghai
 A.sterity Committee "to conclude the first stage of the drive and start the second."  Workers
 dd clerks were urged to "intensify their efforts and not relax until all corrupt elements are
 Dunded up." -Nanchang said (Apr. 3) that a rally was held in Chintecien City, Kiangsi, Mar. 26,
 ten several minor grafters were pardoned and six persons were arrested for refusal to confess.

 '""capitalists" was apparent.  Tientsin Mayor Huang Chin in a public statement warned that the
 drive "was not aimed to destroy private enterprise," spoke of the danger of "wounding friendships
 with heated accusations," and suggested that corrupt merchants might even be friends rather than
 enemies.
 A''new note injected into anticorruption drive broadcasts was the effort to regain funds taken from
 public organizations by corrupt elements.  Peking outlined a Central' Government directive calling
 for "restitution in principle," and repayment of funds, or even promises to repay, went a long
 way toward gaining lenient verdicts for offenders.  Cadres were urged to see that corrupt elements
 repaid stolen funds, a new angle, for, as Wuhsi explained, "Many of the cadres had stopped when
 corrupt elements confessed, failing to ask for restitution."
 Though concentration on businessmen was apparent, several important cases of corruption among
 officials were noted..  Hangchow told of a 10-year prison term for one official who embezzled
 Resist-America, Aid-Korea donations and relief allotments for Army dependents.  Wuhsi reported
 expulsion from the Party of a department head. who had been a Communist for 10 years.  Peking
 said that Ho Heng-fu,, high official in the Central and South China Government, had been
 dismissed for corruption.
 Complaints of economic dislocation as a result of the anticorruption drive were heard less
 frequently, and claims that the drive had promoted production were made more often.    However,
 there still was considerable evidence of dislocation.  Tsinan stated that the local Railway
 ?ureau had sent 1,500: cadres out to "solicit business" from merchants and cooperatives.  The
 Aaftchow Austerity Committee was quoted as exhorting businessmen "to carry on business as usual
 erdless of their investigative status" and-to "drop their wait-and-see attitude."      State
 tZading companies still were reported placing orders with private business to revive trade.
 Tamine and food shortages also were apparent, as well as a shortage of seed for spring sowing.
 ganchang reported "44 percent of the villagers" in one Kiangsi hsien short of food, and Foochow,
 where evidences of trouble had been noted for weeks, said "relief had been rushed to 458 foodless
 :families" in the city's suburbs.  Worry over deficient warehouses and a resulting spoilage of
 scarce grain was reflected in several broadcasts.
 With promotion of spring farming now the chief concern of the broadcasting system, some difficulties
 were noted.  Farmers in one area failed to take delivery of fertilizer they had ordered "because
 they had no money."  One office complained that the "peasants have not enough confidence.."  Some
 farmers were "afraid to make loans for fear of being upgraded..,"  In one area of Fukien paddies
 were reported drying up, endangering the spring rice crop.   -
 ikden reported a campaign to "popularize horse-drawn implements" on farms., and said that the first
 ones manufactured in China were now in use.  Tsinan told of plans to develop a whale and seal
 industry off Shantung shores.
 Wuhan criticized land reform cadres in Hupeh for having no confidence in "poor and hired farmers,"
 -nd. announced that a land reform exhibition in Wuhan would "demonstrate the leadership of the
 '''ommunist Party in the rise of the farming class."  Resistance to the land reform program still
 ias reported from Kiangsi and Yunnan, with Nanchang describing one Kiangsi community as a
 'reactionary stronghold."
 'he propaganda campaign against American use of bacteriological warfare seemed to be dying out.
 reports of protests broadcast by the regional stations were few, and Peking made no new charges
 of germs dropped over China.  A new type of broadcast was heard from Chungking when the names of
 .2 Szechwan soldiers in Korea who had been "gloriously martyred" were given, along with
 renouncement of their awards and descriptions of their heroic exploits.

 held a "monster parade" calling for a victorious conclusion to the second stage of the anti-
 corruption drive, and had been joined by "corrupt merchants who were pardoned in the first
 stage and have now joined the struggle" to expose other merchants.  Hangchow announced (Apra 2)
 that the anticorruption drive had been "victoriously concluded" in the Hangkiang Textile Mills,

 ]Caifeng declared (Apr. 3) that the anticorruption drive was being promoted in the Honan
 Transportation Company, the Chengchow Power Factory, the Honan Machine Tool Factory, the No. 2
 Tobacco Factory, and the Honan Post Office.  Kaifeng reported (Apr. 4) that 50 Kaifeng workers
 listened to a broadcast of the trial of merchant Li Yu-cheng and his accomplices who killed a
 shop clerk, and then sent a letter to the broadcasting station expressing their determination
 to support the anticorruption drive.
 'Wuhan asserted (Apr. 3) that Canton clerks had made 100,000 accusations and "completed preliminary

 FFamine and Shortages0 Hangchow stated (Apra 1) that 369 peasant families in Chinhai Hsien,
 Chekiang, were suffering from famine, in the same area which suffered severely from famine last
 year.  As "cadres were reluctant to do anything," model farmers had been sent into the area to
 organize the farmers for relief work by making fishing nets, while 8,000 catties of relief grain
 had been distributed.  Kaifeng complained (Apra 3) that 1,893 households in Pingyang Hsien, Honan,
 were found to be short of food, "while cadres took no action to promote the antidrought and farm
 production programs."  Nanchang reported (Marv 31) that the Party'Committee of Linchuan Hsien.,
 Kiangsi, had called a meeting to organize relief because "40 percent of the villagers are short of
 food and have no fertilizer or seeds for spring farming."  Because of last year's. drought the
 peasants already were 50 million catties short of grain, and this year's heavy snow destroyed
 100,000 mou of ripe crops.  Nanchang said (Apra 3) that the Party Committee of Shangjao Hsien,
 Kiangsi, had issued a directive calling upon cadres to save daily rice rations for relief of
 famine sufferers, and estimating they could save 4.50,000 Yuan and 400 catties of rice by

 some areas, and other difficulties were admitted.
 Hangchow announced (Apr. 1) that cadres in Wuhsing Hsien, Chekiang, "had been ordered to correct
 their misconceptions" of the Government fertilizer policy.  They had stopped the use'of natural
 fertilizers and ordered farmers to buy fertilizers in accordance with the size of their farms or
 the number of persons in their families, with the result that orders for fertilizer had reached,
 only 365 percent of the plan.  Hangchow said (Apra 2) that 67 farmers of Wuchiatun village,
 Shouchang Hsien, Chekiang, had ordered 22,400 catties of fertilizer, but failed to go through
 with the transaction because they had no money.  The local Party secretary called a meeting and

 peasants."  Hangchow reported (Apr. 2) that the Wuhsien Special District Administrative Office
 called a meeting of directors, of peasants associations and explained that "peasants have not
 enough confidence," and that better leadership at the hsiang level was needed, as well as
 markets for native products and better drought prevention.
 Nanchang stated (Apr. 2) that in Hupei Hsiang, Shangjao Hsien, Kiangsi, spring farm production
 was being promoted by private borrowing and lending of grain,,but that some farmers with
 surplus grain "went around complaining of poverty, and were afraid to make loans for fear of being
 upgraded."  Foochow complained (Apr. 2) that cadres in Yunhsiao Hsien, Fukien, "failed to show
 any solicitude-toward the farmers."  When one peasant sought the help of a cadre in borrowing an
 ox for spring farming the cadre said to him-.  "The Volunteers at the Korean front have overcome
 greater difficulties; why can't you do something?"  Foochow reported (Apr. 3) that cadres had
 been sent to Chinchiang Hsien, Fukien, where 27,000 mou of paddy was in danger of drying up,
