 Kluushchev is right in predicting that com-
 inunisrn is sweeping the  world  and that,
 short of war, we have no means of stopping
 it.
 They are like the man who, as an ex-
 perienced diplomat once put it many years
 ago, is so worried that lie will fall off the
 top floor of the Empire State Building that
 ho stops the elevator and Jumps out of the
 s.inth door widow, I believe this defeatism
 to be profoundly mist.a.l..eti and unwarranted.
 It Is based on it misreading and a misunder-
 standing of what has happened since  the
 second World War and what is happening
 now.  The root of the error is to equate, in-
 stead of to differentiate, between the Com-
 munistic movement which owes allegiance
 to Moscow and Peiping and the worldwide
 movements of social reform and social revo-
 lution, which almost everywhere seek na-
 tional independence and nonalinement with
 the great powers.
 Mr. Khrushchev's hope and belief is that
 he will  lead and direct all the reforming
 and rcvolutiouary movements.  We play right
 into his hands when we identify ourselves
 with the opponents of change rather than
 with the leaders of change.
 For those who think that Laos and South-
 east Asia are gone and that like the dorninocs
 all the Asian nations and the Pacific will go
 too, I should like to call attention to Egypt.
 It was not so many years ago-in fact it
 was in 1955--when we were told that Egypt
 and Syria and Iraq, and all the oil of the
 Persian Gulf, and the Suez Canal, were gone
 or  going.   Egypt  had  gotten  arms  from
 Czechoslovakia, it got Soviet help in building
 the Aswan Dam, it nationalized the Suez
 Canal, and all was lost.
 Yet look at it now.  Syria and Iraq and the
 Persian  Gulf  States are not    Communist..
 Egypt continues to put its Communists in
 jail.   Mr. Khrushchev has attacked Egypt
 publicly.  President Nasser is calling it con-
 gress of the neutrals who do not take their
 direction from Moscow.   Egypt has played a
 decisive part in preventing the flow of Soviet
 arms to the rebels in the Congo.
 After Egypt and the Middle East, look at
 Africa, look at Guinea, which 6 months ago
 was written off as gone. It is not gone de-
 spite the several hundred Soviet technicians
 who are there.  Probably it is not gone in
 part at least because the Soviet technicians
 who are there have made themselves so un-
 popular.  In any event the chances are good
 that Guinea in the end will line up with the
 rest of independent Africa as a neutral state.
 There is now a great likelihood that the
 whole  of North Africa, all the  way  from
 Morocco to Egypt, will take a neutral line,
 refusing to be dominated by Moscow or to
 take  direction from  Paris  or  Washington.
 Moreover, I do not believe that Cuba is
 gone, and I have a very strong impression
 that Mr. Khrushchev does not begin to think
 Cuba is  as  gone  as,  let  us  say,  Senator
 Sarn?rrrrns thinks It is.  For Cuba is as far
 from Moscow as Laos is from Washington.
 In time, not necessarily in a very long time,
 the Cuban revolution will rejoin the com-
 munity of American states.  It will do this
 because it has no other place to go.
 The wave of the future is not Commu-
 nist domination of the world.  The wave of
 the future is social reform and social revo-
 lution driving toward the goal of uaLional
 independence   and  equality of   personal
 status.   in  this  historical  tendency Mr.
 Khrushchev will be, as Mr. Alsup tells its he
 is supposed to have described himself, "the
 locomotive of history," only if we set our-
 selves up to be the roadblocks of history.
 What is the lesson of all these experiences?
 At bottom the lesson is that there is, as the
 President said the other day, a worldwide
 social upheaval which the Communists did
 not create but which they hope to capture.
 If we make our own policy one of opposition
 to  this  worldwide  movement  of  social
 change, we shall lose Lite cold war and Mr.
 Khrushchev's hopes will be realized.  If, on
 the other hand, we befriend and support
 with active measures the movements of so-
 cial change, their leaders will not; submit to
 Moscow because they do not have to sub-
 mit to Moscow.  They do not wish to submit
 to  Moscow because  what  they  want  is
 independence.
 SOME REFLECTIONS UPON RECENT
 EVENTS AND CONTINUING PROB-
 LEMS
 Mr. FU1,13RIGIIT.  Madam President,
 for the past 2 months the attention of
 the world has been engaged by a series
 of dramatic events.    In their wake, a
 great many Americans have been left
 shocked, confused, and frustrated by un-
 mistakable blows to the prestige of the
 United  States.  First,  a  Soviet  flier
 orbited the earth in   a space vehicle.
 Theca came the misadventure in Cuba.
 This was quickly followed by a further
 decline in the Laos : ititaLion, which has
 set the stage for what may be an un-
 happy denouement to that affair.
 On the heels of these events, there has
 emerged another Berlin crisis, one that
 probably is more serious than any of its
 predecessors.  I do not now intend to
 explore the elements of the Berlin situ-
 ation.  It is at this moment under the
 most serious study by this Government
 and our European allies.
 My fear  is  that  many  Americans,
 including some whose judgment is gen-
 erally                                                                good,  are         drawing  the  wrong
 conclusions from the earlier events I
 mentioned From  the      Soviet  space
 achievement, they conclude that we must
 dramatically expand our man-in-space
 program, whatever the cost. The lesson
 of Cuba, they suggest, is that the objec-
 tive was the correct one, but that the
 means employed were inadequate.   And
 they further suggest that any means by
 which  we  can  block  Communist  en-
 croachment in our hemispheric garden
 is the proper course of action.  From
 the events in Laos, many of these voices
 argue that a political settlement in the
 present circumstances will simply yield
 up another country to communism; that
 we  must  prevent  with  any available
 means the formation in Laos of a gov-
 ernment that includes Communist par-
 ticipation.
 What these voices are saying is that
 the United States is the strongest coun-
 try in the world, and should not hesitate
 to commit its strength to the active de-
 fense of its policies anywhere outside the
 Communist empire.  This is dangerous
 doctrine; nothing would please Commu-
 nist                                                                leaders  more than  to  draw  the
 United States into costly commitments
 of its resources to peripheral struggles
 in which the principal Communist pow-
 ers are not themselves directly involved.
 As a Nation, we are understandably
 prone to be more responsive to dramatic
 events  than  to  the  hard,  continuing
 struggle itself.  This is a susceptibility
 that is common to free societies, but
 much less a problem to totalitarian so-
 cieties.                                                                As a Nation, we are a ruggedly
 pragmatic people,  accustomed  to dis-
 posing of problems swiftly and resolute-
 ly.  Yet it may be that the simple trial
 and error methods that accompanied
 our growth are not relevant to our pres-
 ent role as defenders of Western civili-
 zation.
 As leader, we must recognize that the
 struggle with our Communist adversary
 has entered a critical phase.  Our posi-
 tion has been steadily receding: over sl_~
 past several years.  We can no lone,:
 afford errors.  Ilcncefortii, we must (,n-
 dow our actions with greater wisdom,
 judgment, and consistency than has been
 the case in recent years.  This is a, large
 order.   We are caught up in a swirl of
 events.  Wisdom and judgment derive
 from reflective thought.   It is difficult
 to bring these qualities to bear on events
 that  often  develop  with  bewildering
 speed.  The answer, of course, is policy.
 We must develop policies against which
 we can properly evaluate our initiatives
 and our responses to critical events. We
 must also develop style. It is one thing
 to enunciate policies, and another  to
 make them credible.     It is style, our
 performance as a Nation and a great
 power, that determines the credibility of
 our policies.   In the present struggle,
 style is as important as power.   They
 have a 1-to-1 relationship.
 Cuba, Laos, the Soviet cosmonaut--
 none of these by itself is a threat to our
 national security or to the long-term
 success of our policies.  But by exag-
 gerating their significance and reacting
 to them injudiciously we disfigure our
 national style and undermine our poli-
 cies.
 Since the end of World War II, our
 overall policy has been clear to us; but
 its  outlines  have  occasionally  been
 blurred in the view of others by our
 diplomatic performance.  Our objective
 has been world peace, which we have
 tried to maintain by cooperating wita
 many other countries and assisting the
 efforts of each one to find its own des-
 tiny in an atmosphere free of coercion.
 More specifically, we helped to preserve

 with timely assistance.   The Marr i .

 actor, and restored the ruI n  ,m .;
 economic health.
 We sought to iiikcriiationalizc control
 of the atom at a moment when we, alone,
 possessed  the  knowledge  of  nuclear
 power.  This initiative was frustrated by
 the  Soviet  Union.  At  that  moment,
 when we possessed a nuclear monopoly,
 we might have imposed our will upon the
 Soviet Union; but we did not.  Subse-
 quently, the pressures arising from the
 Soviet Union's imperialistic design in-
 duced us to form defensive alliances with
 other countries.  As the stress of the.
 struggle shifted from a military to an
 economic and social context, we intensi-
 fied our efforts to enable other countries
 to develop strong institutions and better
 standards of life for their peoples.  We
 have  encouraged  regional    groupings.
 With the OECD, we have recognized the
 interdependence of  our own economy
 with those of 19 countries; and we have
 led in creating an instrument that will
 enable other capital exporting countries
 to join with us in an effort to narrow the

 A  peaceful  revolution   should  be

 The meeting in Uruguay this August

 offers an opportunity to give additional
 credibility and momentum to the  al-

 make clear that it is not seeking to cul-

 independent and progressive societies.
 Our duty is to show that between corri-

 United States recognizes a third choice--
 perinissive societies whose central pur-
 pose is to embody the peoples' will and
 the peoples' needs.
 In Latin America, as in much of the
 rest of the world, the question is being
 posed: Can. social and economic prog-

 discipline?  It is our duty to provide a
 credible case for the affirmative side of
 this debate. Our economic and philo-
 sophical resources, if wisely used, should
 enable us to succeed.
 REORGANIZATION PLAN NO. 4
 The Senate resumed the consideration
 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1961.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Madam President,
 I wish to renew my request made previ-
 ously that the discussion on Reorganiza-
 tion Plan No. 4 be limited to 2 hours, 1
 hour to be under the control of the dis-
 tinguished minority leader I Mr. DIRK-
 srN I and 1 hour under the control of the
 chairman of the committee, the distin-
 guished  Senator  from Arkansas  [Mr.
 MCCLELLANI, with the proviso that prior
 to the limitations going into effect 5
 minutes will be allocated to the Senator
 from Idaho [Mr. Cuuncnl, 5 minutes to

 fines of not more than $5,000, or imp.ris-

 'iIle bill contains a unique presumption
 section under which proof of bribery
 would raise a presumption that there was
 a scheme in interstate commerce to fix
 the event.  Thci,e are precedents for such
 Presumptions    in  other  criminal  stat-
 utes such is those relating to narcotics.
 I believe that the reasonableness of such
 a presumption was amply demonstrated
 in a rcceut report of the New York State
 Commission on Investigations showing
 the nationwide network relied upon by
 professional gamblers.
 Today's gambling fraternity is not
 just  a  local  operation.   The  bigtime
 bookmaker,  in order to survive, must
 have a reliable line on the contest, which
 requires expert,  up-to-the-nminute   ad-
 vice,                                                               a  method         of  layoffs          to  insure

 With so much at stake, the temptation
 to fix various athletic events is always
 present. For all of these services the
 bookmaker must rely upon a syndicated
 operation and upon many individuals
 outside his community.
 We have all been shocked by the re-
 cent basketball scandals which are still
 being investigated.  This is the second
 basketball scandal to come to light in a
 relatively short time.  The last basket-
 ball investigation involved 23 cities, in-
 cluding  New  York,                                                                        and  17  different
 States, and exposed score rigging deals
 in almost 50 college games.
