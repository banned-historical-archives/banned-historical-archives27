 Possible Chinese Responses to Gorbachev's Speech
 Summary
 We  believe   China  will  seize  the  opportunity  presented  by
 Gorbachev's Vladivostok speech to push for further Soviet concessions, to
 increase Chinese leverage with the United States, to explore ways to
 reduce the Soviet threat to China, and to sow concern in Hanoi about the
 reliability of Soviet support. Domestically, Deng may see an opportunity
 to set the course for China's relations with the USSR before he hands over
 power to his successors, leaving them free to focus on the reform
 program.
 In  our  judgment,   China  has  not  changed  its  fundamental
 assessment of the Soviet threat--nor is it even  reevaluating  it.  By
 publicly calling for Soviet concessions on Cambodia, Beijing has placed a
 constraint on how far it can go with Moscow and tried to reassure
 Washington.  In responding to Gorbachev, we believe Beijing will attempt
 to probe for and encourage additional concessions from Moscow without
 alarming the United States and China's Asian friends or allowing Moscow

 to exploit a Sino-Soviet dialogue to enhance Soviet leverage in the
 triangle.  In keeping with its "independent foreign policy," moreover, China
 will continue to send mixed signals in its press commentary on both
 Soviet and US actions.
 When the ninth round of bilateral consultations begins in Beijing in
 October, we believe, in addition to pressing on Afghanistan and Cambodia,
 Beijing will push Moscow to:
 ? Withdraw the majority of Soviet troops from
 Mongolia.
 ? Pull back troops from its border with China.
 ? Reduce SS-20s deployed in the Soviet Far East.
 ? Curtail reconnaissance flights against China
 through North Korean airspace.
 ? Relinquish Chimnaya/Heixiazi Island across from
 Khabarovsk.
 to our judgment, significant Soviet concessions in at least one area
 could  induce  China  to  make  one  or  more  of  the  following
 counter-concessions:
 ? Conclude a mutual nonaggression pact with Mongolia.
 ? Revive Sino-Soviet border talks.
 ? Agree to confidence-building gestures along its northern border.
 ? Set dates for foreign ministerial talks.
 ? Expand Soviet access to senior Chinese leaders.
 ? Increase working-level exchanges and consultations.
 We believe the Chinese will continue to rebuff Soviet efforts to
 reestablish party ties and will not agree to a summit between Gorbachev
 and either preeminent Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping or General Secretary
 Hu Yaobang prior to significant Soviet concessions on Cambodia and
 Afghanistan.  China will most likely normalize party relations with Eastern
 Europe--a move apparently sanctioned by Moscow as a way to facilitate
 possible normalization of Sino-Soviet party ties later--to promote Chinese
 influence in the region at Moscow's expense.   The Chinese also will
 continue to expand defense and economic ties with the United States

 Beijing's Soviet Policy on the Eve of Gorbachev's Speech
 In the months preceding Gorbachev's speech on 28 July, the Chinese increasingly
 exhibited signs of frustration with Moscow's refusal to follow up its smooth rhetoric
 with concessions on any of what China calls the "three obstacles" to improved relations:
 Soviet  support  for  Vietnam's  occupation  of  Cambodia,  the  Soviet  presence  in
 Afghanistan, and the deployment of Soviet troops in Mongolia and along the Sino-Soviet
 border. Beijing last year tried to encourage Gorbachev to reassess Moscow's hardline
 policies toward China's security concerns by agreeing--without corresponding Soviet
 concessions--to resume long-suspended trade union and parliamentary relations and to
 exchange visits by their foreign ministers in 1986.  We believe these moves were also
 designed to increase Beijing's leverage with Washington
 Moscow's  continued  intransigence  at  the   last  three  biannual  Sino-Soviet
 consultations and its blatant efforts to exploit the impression of improved Sino-Soviet
 ties to enhance its position vis-a-vis Washington, however, caused Beijing to brand
 Gorbachev's foreign policy as meaningless "smile diplomacy" and to back away from the
 exchange of foreign ministers.  We believe Beijing chilled political relations for two
 reasons.  First, the Chinese wanted to remind Moscow that the Soviets must address at
 least one of the "three obstacles" if gradual normalization of relations were to continue.
 At the same time, the Chinese sought to reassure the United States, Thailand, Pakistan,
 and others that China remained committed to resisting the security threat posed by the
 USSR and its Asian allies.
 Indeed, Soviet military developments prior to Gorbachev's speech did little to
 persuade Beijing that Moscow had altered its long-term strategy of encircling China.

 Gorbachev's Proposals
 In his speech given in Vladivostok on 28 July, Gorbachev made the
 following new proposals concerning China:
 ? The Soviet Union will withdraw six regiments from Afghanistan by
 year's end.
 ? Moscow is ready to discuss "concrete steps" to reduce land forces
 along the Sino-Soviet border.
 ? Soviet and Mongolian leaders are examining the removal of a
 "substantial part" of what we believe to be approximately 60,000
 Soviet troops in Mongolia.
 ? The Soviet Union and China could cooperate in space exploration.
 Gorbachev once again:
 ? Proposed bilateral discussions "any time, and at any level"
 on improving relations.
 ? Suggested the official boundary on the Amur River might pass
 along the main shipping channel instead of the Chinese bank.
 (Although this is the first time Moscow has publicly proposed
 this boundary formula, the Soviets did so privately as early
 as 1964.)
 ? Resurrected his call last year for a Helsinki-style Asian
 security conference.
 ? Reiterated Soviet willingness to establish a rail link between
 Soviet Kazakhstan and Chinese Xinjiang.
 ? Endorsed already-begun bilateral negotiations to jointly develop
 the Amur River Basin.

 Factors Governing China's Response
 statements by senior Chinese officials indicate that Beijing
 not changed.
 sees   Gorbachev's   proposals     as   failing   to   address   China's   top   security
 concerns--Vietnam's efforts to expand its influence at China's expense and Soviet
 efforts to encircle China militarily.3 Chinese strategic thinkers have also stressed in
 private conversations with Americans that China's assessment of the Soviet threat has
 Nonetheless, we believe China has compelling reasons to begin a dialogue with
 Moscow on Gorbachev's proposal.  In our judgment, Beijing believes further marginal
 improvements in Sino-Soviet relations would:
 ? Buy time for China to modernize its forces along the border.  Beijing is in the
 process of implementing a new defense strategy that it believes requires at least
 a decade of reduced tensions to become completely credible."
 ? Stimulate competition between Moscow and Washington to woo Beijing.
 ? Increase tension in Soviet-Vietnamese relations, a major Chinese goal, by playing
 on Hanoi's fear of being sold out by Moscow.  Vietnam periodically dispatches
 delegations to Moscow to seek reassurances of Soviet support.
 ? Assist domestic political goals.
 At the same time,  Beijing  is well aware that too positive a response to
 Gorbachev's  proposals could jeopardize its access to US, Japanese, and Western
 European advanced technology, investment, trade, and defense cooperation--major
 Chinese political goals.  Nor does Beijing want to signal its friends and enemies in
 Southeast and  South  Asia  that it might reconsider its  stand on Cambodia and
 Afghanistan. Therefore, we believe China will attempt to:
 of three major obstacles."
 Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian and Vice Foreign Minister Qian Qizhen noted to US
 officials on 31 July that Gorbachev had not addressed the Cambodian problem.
 According to foreign press reports, Deng Xiaoping commented to a visiting Japanese
 politician on 5 August that "I think we still have the three obstacles."  Vice Foreign
 Minister Zhou Nan reportedly told a foreign diplomat in early August that Soviet
 Deputy Foreign Minister Kapitsa's characterization of the Vietnamese occupation of
 Cambodia as "irreversible" was very disappointing.  The Foreign Ministry spokesman
 on 13 August quoted Foreign Minister Wu as telling the Soviet charge d'affaires in
 Beijing:  "What he (Gorbachev) said about some questions is still far from the removal

 ? Encourage Soviet -flexibility while continuing to criticize on the three obstacles
 and other security issues.
 ? Probe for major Soviet concessions on the three obstacles and China's northern
 boundary.
 ? Reassure Washington of China's pro-Western tilt without forgoing the option of
 being able to play the "Soviet card."
 ? Reduce Moscow's ability to play the "China card" against Washington.
 ? Keep Thailand and Pakistan from wavering on Cambodia and Afghanistan.
 Domestic Fallout from the Gorbachev Speech
 Deng and his reform allies can gain in two areas from some further
 relaxation in Sino-Soviet relations, in our view.  First, any reduction in tensions
 tends to benefit China's economic modernization program. Second, progress on
 the issue should smooth the transition to power for Deng's successors.
 We believe Deng has designed many of China's foreign policy initiatives,
 most notably closer relations with the West, to support his economic reforms.
 Consequently, although he distrusts the Soviets, Deng would probably be willing
 to be more flexible if he believes he can win real Soviet concessions that can
 help his modernization goals.  Avoidance of border tensions allows a more
 measured pace of military modernization and frees transport, manpower, and
 other resources.  Deng may also hope to expand exports of goods China cannot
 trade elsewhere and gain further Soviet assistance in modernizing Soviet-built
 factories.
 On the political front, Deng may see an opportunity to set China's Soviet
 policy before he hands power over to his successors. We believe that Deng has
 kept foreign policy issues closely under his own control, relying on his personal
 prestige and influence to manage this sensitive area.  Deng's successors will
 not have his personal clout and therefore might be more vulnerable to groups
 that either have a different foreign policy orientation or seek to exploit foreign
 affairs for domestic political ends.  The more Deng can stabilize relations with
 Moscow and win agreement on how to proceed, the more likely we believe his
 successors will be able to carry on the reform program with a minimum of
 distraction.
 In our estimation, Deng's conservative opponents, who argued last year
 for a more flexible approach to the Soviets, cannot capitalize politically on
 Gorbachev's initiatives.   We believe that recent political developments have
 greatly weakened the conservatives--especially those at the top--and have

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/11/25: CIA-RDP86T01017R000606380001-7
 made it increasingly unlikely that the conservatives will be able to challenge
 Deng.  In any case, it is our judgment that the conservatives are suspicious of
 both the United States and the Soviet Union. Thus, while there is some support
 among the conservatives for more distant relations with Washington, we also
 see very little active pressure for closer political relations with Moscow.
 Possible Chinese Responses
 We believe the Chinese will use scheduled contacts over the next several weeks
 to seek further indications of Soviet intentions, but the ninth round of vice foreign
 ministerial consultations in Beijing in October provides the best venue to engage the
 Soviets in a meaningful dialogue on Gorbachev's proposals.   Outlined below is our
 speculation about what the Chinese may say in October and why.
 Security issues.  Remarks by Chinese strategic thinkers support our judgment
 that China will not be satisfied with Gorbachev's implicit pledge to freeze the number of
 SS-20s in the Far East or his explicit promise not to relocate in the region any SS-20s
 that might be removed from Europe.  We believe the Chinese will continue to press for
 their total withdrawal.  We also expect China to protest overflights of North Korea by
 Soviet reconnaissance planes targeting the Chinese coast, Moscow's expansion of its
 Pacific fleet, and the upgrading of Soviet airpower in the Far East.
 We nevertheless believe that the Chinese view Gorbachev's offer to withdraw
 troops from Mongolia and the Sino-Soviet border as an important unilateral gesture.  If
 the Soviets commit themselves to withdraw one or more               divisions in
 Mongolia--a move that would not jeopardize Soviet or Mongolian security--Beijing
 could reciprocate in a number of ways without compromising its own security. Chinese
 options include:
 ? Announcing the "deactivation" of the I           I Army opposite Mongolia (we
 believe this unit was secretly deactivated last September).
 ? Agreeing to warn each other of military exercises or major troop movements
 near the Sino-Mongolian border.
 ? Pulling back tank regiments from selected border defense divisions along the
 Mongolian frontier.
 If the Soviets go beyond a token withdrawal and pull back most if not all of their forces
 from Mongolia, we believe the Chinese would be willing to go further, perhaps signing a
 friendship treaty with Mongolia that would renounce any claim to Mongolian territory
 and serve as a de facto mutual nonaggression pact--something the Soviets have been
 seeking.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/11/25: CIA-RDP86T01017R000606380001-7
 We believe a Soviet proposal to negotiate some sort of demilitarized zone along
 the Sino-Soviet border would be far less attractive to China than deactivation of Soviet
 divisions.  Beijing has always expressed greater concern about the number of Soviet
 divisions in the Far East than about their proximity to the Chinese border.  Nonetheless,
 if the Soviets offered to pull back all regular ground units 30 kilometers from the border,
 China, in our judgment, could respond by transfering northern border security duties
 from the PLA to the People's Armed Police.  China's major PLA border units are already
 deployed 100 kilometers back, leaving small border defense regiments as the only forces
 Expanded Political Contacts
 China's cautious response to Gorbachev's initiative comes amidst a flurry
 of high-level exchanges with the Soviet Union and Mongolia that we believe is
 a combination of earlier scheduling, Chinese interest in Gorbachev's proposals,
 and Moscow's desire to portray Sino-Soviet relations as improving:
 ? Soviet First Deputy Premier Arkhipov arrived in China for
 "acupuncture treatment" on the eve of Gorbachev's speech
 and met with Vice Premiers Li Peng, Wan Li, and Yao Yilin
 before returning to Moscow on 26 August. According to a
 Western press account, Arkhipov presented the Chinese
 with an advance copy of the speech.
 ? Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuqing proceeded with
 a long-scheduled trip to Mongolia--the highest-level
 Chinese visit to that country in over 20 years--which
 culminated in the signing of a consular treaty on
 9 August. This treaty is consistent with similar
 agreements Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian signed in Berlin
 and Budapest in late spring, but takes on added signifi-
 cance because it follows on the heels of Gorbachev's
 Mongolian overture, which the two sides also discussed.
 ? Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong began a two-week visit to
 Moscow 17 August, the first such mayoral visit since
 the 1950s.
 ? Soviet Deputy Premier and Alternate Politburo member
 Talyzin, possibly accompanied by Deputy Foreign Minister
 Rogachev, is scheduled to visit China in early September
 as the guest of Vice Premier Li Peng. According to a
 Soviet diplomat in Beijing, the Chinese in early May
 pushed for the visit of a deputy premier to reciprocate
 for Vice Premier Yao Yilin's visit in July 1985. Talyzin's
 visit is in response to this, but its timing nevertheless
 fortuitously strengthens the impression of improved ties

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/11/25: CIA-RDP86T01017R000606380001-7
 following Gorbachev's speech.
 ? We expect Wu and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze to
 discuss Gorbachev's proposals in the third annual Sino-Soviet
 foreign ministerial meeting at the opening of the UNGA in
 September in New York.
 ? Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang and President Li
 Xiannian will host a visit to China by East German
 General Secretary and President Honecker in October.
 Honecker's visit to China--the first such trip in many
 years by a Soviet bloc party leader other than Romania's
 Ceaucescu--and the expected reestablishment of party ties
 most likely signal similar developments with other East
 European Communist parties. Although intended by Beijing
 to increase Chinese influence in East Europe, Honecker's
 party position and the certainty that Moscow has
 approved his trip nonetheless will give the visit a
 Sino-Soviet focus as well.
 ? Rogachev in October will lead the Soviet delegation
 to Beijing for the ninth round of Sino-Soviet vice
 ministerial consultations.
 Boundary Talks.  We think it likely that China could decide to reopen formal
 border negotiations, which broke down in 1978 after Beijing publicly insisted on Soviet
 withdrawal from disputed areas and added a new demand that Moscow reduce its forces
 along  the Sino-Soviet  border  to  the  level  of  Khrushchev's  time.5  Gorbachev's
 acceptance of the deepest channel  (thalweg) of the Amur River as the line of
 demarcation gives China most of the disputed islands in the river.   Ownership of
 Chimnaya (Heixiazi) Island opposite Khabarovsk, however, is likely to be a sticking point,
 and any negotiations on the border are likely to be protracted as both parties weigh the
 impact on disputes with other nations.
 Amur River Basin and Railway Cooperation.  China earlier this year reopened to
 Soviet shipping the port of Tongjiang on the Songhua River near the Amur, and we
 believe the two sides will sign an agreement on use of the basin based on their recent
 expert-level  negotiations.   China  has  announced that  it  plans  to  extend  the
 Harbin-Longzhen railway 240 kilometers to Aihui on the Amur River and might cooperate
 with  the  Soviets  in  building  a  rail  bridge across the Amur between Aihui  and
 Blagoveshchensk to facilitate border trade.    In the west, China plans to add some 400
 kilometers to the single-track Lanzhou-Urumqi     railway, extending  it to within 80

 kilometers of the Soviet railway terminus at Druzhba.  We would not be surprised if
 Beijing accelerated its construction schedule and agreed to connect the two railways as
 a sign of. goodwill to. Moscow.
 Areas Where Beijing is Unlikely to Accommodate Moscow
 Beijing has stated it will not compromise with Moscow on Afghanistan and
 Cambodia,  and  we  believe  China  will  hold  significant  improvements  in  political
 relations--such as party ties and a Deng/Hu-Gorbachev summit--hostage to meaningful
 Soviet movement on these "obstacles."  China probably calculates that even the hint of
 China's flexibility on these issues would greatly harm its credibility with the United
 States, and such Asian friends as Pakistan and Thailand.  Moreover, we believe the
 Chinese will attempt to assuage their friends' natural suspicions of any Sino-Soviet
 border agreement, and may couple progress in one area with stepped-up criticism of
 Soviet activity elsewhere, especially Cambodia and Afghanistan.  We expect the Chinese
 to reject Gorbachev's proposed Asian security conference, as they have in the past.
 Beijing also will not, in our view, agree to forswear the option of strategic cooperation
 with Washington against Moscow.
 Finally, Beijing's pride in its own space-launch capabilities most likely will keep
 China from taking Gorbachev up on his offer to join the ranks of Mongolia, Cuba, and
 various East European satellites as a junior partner in the Soviet space program.  The
 Chinese, moreover, have already expressed interest in a US invitation to participate in a
 future space shuttle mission.
 Positive Signals China Can Send in Other Areas
 Even if the Chinese rule out concessions specifically linked to Gorbachev's
 proposals on the grounds that Gorbachev merely responded to earlier Chinese gestures,
 they could nevertheless reward Gorbachev and encourage further Soviet concessions in
 other ways. Possible moves might include:
 ? Expanding Soviet access to senior Chinese leaders.
 ? Increasing consultations between working-level officials on international issues,
 including relations with the United States.
 ? Regularly exchanging views (but not intelligence) between think tank experts on
 economic development and foreign policy issues.
 ? Proceeding with the exchange of foreign ministerial visits.
 ? Exchanging visits by editors of Pravda and People's Daily.

 Without significant progress on Afghanistan or Cambodia, however, we believe
 the Chinese remain highly unlikely to agree to a summit between Gorbachev and Deng
 Xiaoping or Hu- Yaobang.  Such a move would be too close to a resumption of party
 ties, which Beijing probably believes would give the Soviets excessive leverage within
 the strategic triangle while undermining China's credibility as an independent actor in
 both the West and in the Third World.
 We expect the Chinese to try to use Gorbachev's initiative to encourage US
 concessions on Taiwan, trade, and technology transfer, although Chinese officials in
 private probably will take pains to reassure the United States and others of China's
 continued goodwill.  Beijing, in our judgment, will use Defense Secretary Weinberger's
 coming visit and the first port call to China by US Navy warships this fall both to press
 the Soviets in October for concessions on Gorbachev's proposals and other security
 concerns, such as Soviet reconnaissance overflights of North Korea against China, and
 to balance any improvements in ties with Moscow.  China will also closely monitor
 developments  in      US-USSR  relations  as  a  possible  Reagan-Gorbachev  summit
 approaches, out of concern that Beijing may be caught behind the curve.  Finally, in
 keeping with its "independent foreign policy," China will continue to send mixed signals
 in its press commentary on both Soviet and US actions.
