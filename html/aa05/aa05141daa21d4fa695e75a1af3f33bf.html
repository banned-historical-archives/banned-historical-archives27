 Radio Phnom Penh has been off the air since late on
 April 17, and the French representative in the capital
 is.the only contact with the outside.   He is apparently
 staying inside the French embassy compound, and thus has
 provided few details on the communist occupation. I
 There is still no evidence that senior Khmer commu-
 nist leaders have entered Phnom Penh to setup their new
 regime.   Their occupation plans called for the establish-
 ment of a temporary "revolutionary council" to consoli-
 date control in the city, and press reports indicate
 that a "council" has indeed been formed.
 Prince Sihanouk is still in Peking, where he has
 received numerous congratulatory messages.   The most in-
 teresting of these was a telegram from Soviet leaders
 Brezhnev, Podgorny, and Kosygin, who somewhat lamely
 claimed that "the Soviet Union has always supported the
 Cambodian'patriots."  Moscow also promised support to
 build an "independent and flourishing Cambodia."   Siha-
 nouk for his part is still being coy about his travel
 plans.
 The. Association of Southeast Asian Nations--Thailand,
 Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines--
 yesterday announced joint recognition of Sihanouk's gov-
 ernment.   Laos and Portugal made similar announcements.
 Japan followed suit today, even though Sihanouk had told
 a Japanese newsman that any such move would be rebuffed
 because of Tokyo's past support for the Lon Nol govern-
 ment.

 SOUTH VIETNAM
 April 19, 1975
 The communists are tightening the noose around Sai-
 In a matter of days they will have 17 full divisions
 to commit against remaining government positions defend-
 ing the capital and the delta, and will outnumber the
 government forces by about two to one.            The South Viet-
 namese have only seven divisions left, and many of these
 have recently been hard hit.  Three other divisions are
 in the process of rebuilding, but they cannot be expected
 to be ready for combat in the next few critical days.
 Moreover, communist artillery attacks are threatening
 to make inoperative the government's airbases close to
 the capital.  Without air support, the South Vietnamese
 will be greatly outgunned as well as outmanned.
 On the eastern end of Saigon's defense line, at
 Xuan Loc, South Vietnamese forces are still crumbling
 in the face of sustained communist attacks.   It appears
 likely that the South Vietnamese 18th Division and an
 airborne brigade will be lost.   At least one of the
 attacking communist divisions--the North Vietnamese 6th--
 already has pulled away from Xuan Loc and is swinging to
 the south, headed either for Vung Tau or around the gov-
 ernment's southern flank and on toward Saigon.
 A large gap in the defense perimeter at Bien Hoa was
 filled yesterday when a brigade of marines was moved into
 blocking positions north of the city.  Despite airstrikes
 against North Vietnamese artillery positions, the Bien
 Hoa airbase has been hit again with large-caliber artil-
 lery and rockets.
 To the south and west of Saigon,. the communists are
 bringing the fight closer to the capital.   During the
 past two days, a flurry of communist attacks in Long An
 Province spread to the outskirts of the capital.  A num-
 ber of smaller positions were overrun, and many others
 were hit hard with shellings and ground attacks.

 The communists are threatening to close down the
 government's two large airbases at Bien Hoa and Tan Son
 Nhut.      The Bien Hoa airfield has already been hit by
 122-mm. artillery, which has a range of 13 miles; the
 communists also possess the heavier 130-mm. field gun,
 which is accurate up to 17 miles.

 CHINA
 .April 19, 1975
 Continuing the themes that have typified Chinese
 commentary on the insurgent offensive in Cambodia since
 it began early this year, Peking's major statements yes-
 terday on the "liberation" of Phnom Penh emphasize China's
 solidarity with the rebels and the importance Peking at-
 taches to Prince Sihanouk's past and future role in Cam-
 bodia.
 An authoritative People's Daily editorial yesterday
 declared that the Cambodian people were successful
 against the government because they rallied around a
 united front that included Sihanouk as well as the com-
 munists.  Expressing its interest in Sihanouk's future
 role, the editorial also asserted that the united front,
 formally chaired by Sihanouk, and the royal government
 "represent the interests of the Cambodian people."
 Moreover, Peking's congratulatory message from Chair-
 man Mao Tse-tung and other Chinese leaders was addressed
 to "head of state" Sihanouk, as well as to the prime
 minister and deputy prime minister of the royal govern-
 ment.  These references indicate that Peking hopes the
 Prince will play a significant role in Phnom Penh; they
 may also mean that the Chinese hope to preempt any pos-
 sible move to shunt Sihanouk aside, now that the war is
 over.
 The thrust of the Chinese statements is that Peking
 should be considered the new regime's most consistent
 ally--now and in the future.  The editorial specifically
 contrasted Chinese support with the duplicity of the
 Soviets.  The editorial carefully balanced criticism of
 the US role in Cambodia with an attack on the Soviets
 for supporting Lon Nol until the last minute.   It said
 Moscow had been exposed as "a political gambler who has
 lost his all."
 Neither the. editorial nor the congratulatory message
 made any direct reference to Hanoi---an indication that
 the Chinese may expect to find themselves in competition
 with the North Vietnamese for influence in Phnom Penh.

 Peking appears to be setting down a moderate tone
 for North Korean President Kim Il-song's visit, which
 began on Thursday.
 A People's Daily editorial that appeared the day be-
 fore Kim's arrival in Peking pledged support for the
 "correct policy" of peaceful reunification of the two
 Koreas.   Treatment of the US role in Korea was perfunc-
 tory;  US involvement in the Korean war was not even men-
 tioned, while the only reference to US troops in the
 south was a pro forma statement that they "must be with-
 drawn."
 The editorial did not attempt to associate recent
 events in Indochina and the Kim visit.   In fact, the
 references to "peaceful reunification," as well as the
 relatively restrained criticism of Seoul, strongly sug-
 gest that Peking is in no mood to support any thoughts
 Kim may have about increasing tensions on the Korean
 peninsula.
 The importance that the Chinese attach to Kim's
 visit is obvious from the massive welcome given him and
 the fact that he met with Mao--the Chairman's first ap-
 pearance in three months--only hours after he arrived in
 Peking.   The very fact that Kim traveled to China--his
 first official visit in 14 years--in itself suggests
 that issues of importance to both countries are under
 discussion.
 The pre-arrival editorial suggests concern by Peking
 that North Korea, perhaps influenced by recent events in
 Indochina,  is seeking support for a more militant posture
 toward Seoul.   Although the editorial clearly comes down
 on the side of moderation,  it also goes to great lengths
 to emphasize the importance of continuing Sino-Korean
 friendship.

 Kim's talk with Mao probably centered on military
 matters because military aid negotiator 0 Chin-u was par-
 ticipating.   If Kim is in Peking to solicit support for
 any sort of specific military moves, the Chinese will be
 careful in responding because of concern that the North
 Koreans will turn to the USSR if they are given the cold
 shoulder by Peking.  Although Moscow has shown no dis-
 position to encourage possible Korean adventurism, the
 Chinese have continually evinced great sensitivity about
 Soviet relations with Pyongyang.

 SYRIA
 President Asad failed to strengthen significantly
 his tenuous hold on the Syrian Baath Party at its sixth
 congress, which ended earlier this week with the election
 of new members to the regional command, the party's gov-
 erning body.
 Four of the seven new members of the ruling group--
 like President Asad--are members of Syria's minority
 Alawite sect.  All seven of those dropped were from the
 country's Sunni Muslim majority.   To a limited extent,
 this will strengthen the President's influence with the
 party, but it will also risk aggravating Alawite-Sunni
 tensions.   In the past there have been charges that Asad's
 government is not representative of all Syrians.
 The most notable addition to the regional command
 is Rifat Asad, brother of the President and commander of
 the elite security force that guards the capital.   Rifat's
 election reportedly was the result of aggressive lobby-
 ing on his part before and during the party congress.
 His elevation was, if anything, opposed by the President,
 who nonetheless is now open to charges of nepotism.   It
 cannot be taken as evidence that Rifat has   ut aside his
 often basic differences with his brother
 Rifat's election at least confirms that the military
 plays a dominant role in party affairs, and that the Pres-
 ident has only a limited ability to force his views on
 the party.
 Prime Minister Ayyubi lost his place on the regional
 command.   Always ineffectual, he has recently been at
 odds with the President and may be dropped in the near
 future.    Reports in the Arab press suggest that the Pres-
 ident plans to form a new cabinet soon.   Also dropped
 from the regional command was Naji Jamil, one of the re-
 gime's inner circle who has been serving as air force
 commander, deputy defense minister, and director of the

 national security apparatus.   Jamil may lose his secu-
 rity responsibilities as a result of his failure to be
 re-elected and the limited effectiveness of government
 efforts to control the proceedings at the conference and
 the outcome of the election.
 Resolutions passed by the congress on general Middle
 East issues broke no new ground.   They called for total
 support for the Palestinians--including implementation of
 President Asad's recent proposal for joint Syrian-Pales-
 tinian political and military commands--and better cooper-
 ation among the Arab states.
 The President stuck mostly to domestic themes in his
 address to the assembly.   He pointed out that the outgoing
 congress was the first to serve a full four-year term, and
 he stressed that his government, in power since 1970, has
 provided Syria with its first extended period of political
 stability.

 Admiral Antonio Alva Rosa Coutinho reportedly will
 soon be named chief of staff of the armed forces.                He
 will replace General Francisco da Costa Gomes, who will
 retain the presidency.
 Coutinho was an original member of the now-disbanded
 Junta of National Salvation, and until last January he
 was the high commissioner in Angola.   He has recently
 been appointed executive director of
 the ruling Council of Revolution--a
 position he would be :Likely to re-
 tain, if given the new post.
 The admiral is believed to have
 the allegiance of the largest faction
 within the Council, but Prime Minis-
 ter Goncalves may still wield the most
 power because of his government posi-
 tion and support from the Communist
 Party and its allies.  Coutinho's
 group, composed of left-leaning na-
 tionalists, is opposed to heavy reli-
 ance by the Armed Forces Movement on the Communist Party
 and its allies.   It supports a continuation of Portugal's
 ties with Western Europe and NATO as well as an expansion
 of relations with the third-world countries rather than
 Eastern Europe.
 As armed forces chief, Coutinho would assume command
 of the 2d Division of the General Staff, which is re-
 sponsible for most internal security and counterintelli-
 gence activities, and the Continental Operations Com-
 mand elements charged with external intelligence.   Con-
 trol of the armed forces and the security structure would
 provide the admiral with greater influence in an apparent
 power struggle developing with Prime Minister Goncalves.
 It would also make him a leading contender to replace
 Goncalves, should the occasion arise.

 Coutinho's expected appointment as chief of staff
 coincides with the planned reorganization of Portugal's
 internal security structure, which may provide him with
 an even more powerful base.  A new organization, with
 Coutinho in charge, will bring together various intelli-
 gence activities.   They include those charged with dis-
 solving the internal security services of the Salazar-
 Caetano regime, investigating the treatment of political
 prisoners, and examining the ouster of President Spinola
 last fall as well as the more recent rightist coup fail-
 ure.  The new body will also investigate problems relat-
 ing to the economy.
 Although Coutinho has been characterized as a left-
 leaning socialist and has shown disdain for most politi-
 cal parties, he is widely respected by Movement officers
 and politicians of all persuasions.   Leaders of the cen-
 ter-rightist Social Democratic Center Party have described
 him as pragmatic, nationalistic, anticommunist, and "in-
 terested in constructing a national brand of socialism
 adapted to national realities."  Furthermore, the admiral
 recently announced his belief that Portugal's membership
 in NATO is imperative because of the country's location.

 Criticism of the US by Prime Minister Gandhi and
 other Indian officials, aimed primarily at domestic In-
 dian audiences, is beginning to increase as election
 campaigns approach.
 Early this week, Mrs. Gandhi publicly referred at
 least twice to foreign "threats," including a new threat
 from the sea, which she said justify the continuation of
 a state of emergency in force since the 1971 war with
 Pakistan.  Mrs. Gandhi has used her emergency powers
 primarily to detain suspected terrorists and smugglers.
 Her insistence on retaining the emergency powers has
 been frequently attacked by opponents, including her
 leading critic, Jayaprakash Narayan.
 When asked by newsmen what sea threat she had in
 mind, Mrs. Gandhi said it was "obvious."  US officials
 in New Delhi believe there is little doubt she was re-
 ferring to US sea power, including plans for expanding
 US naval facilities on Diego Garcia Island in the Indian
 Ocean.
 Over the past two months Mrs. Gandhi and other In-
 dian officials have been critical of the US policy change
 in February that permitted the resumption of arms sales
 to Pakistan.  The rhetoric had been relatively restrained
 but has become sharper during the past week.  Some cab-
 inet members have stated that US arms are sure to make
 Pakistan a source of intrigue and aggression.  The pres-
 ident of.Mrs. Gandhi's Congress Party and the chief min-
 isters of two states have gone even further, suggesting
 that US policies are creating tension throughout Asia.
 New Delhi has long opposed the presence of outside
 powers--particularly the US--in the Indian Ocean, as
 well as other US policies such as involvement in Indo-
 china and military cooperation with Pakistan.   In addi-
 tion, Mrs. Gandhi has in the past shown a readiness to

 blame foreign countries, especially the US, for India's
 problems.  Such rhetoric may well increase as elections
 draw nearer in Gujarat state, where they are scheduled
 for June, and on the national level, where they are ex-
 pected by early next year.

 The navy has expressed renewed interest in purchas-
 ing Harrier vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL)
 strike and reconnaissance aircraft, produced in the UK,
 to replace obsolescent Sea Hawk fighters assigned to In-
 dia's aircraft carrier.
 t is likely that the navy
 initially will buy seven of the aircraft, but details of
 the agreement have not been worked out.  Additional air-
 craft and trainers may be purchased to equip a land-based
 squadron so that replacements could rotate to the air-
 craft carrier.  Acquisition of the Harrier would provide
 the navy with an improved strike capability to complement
 the carrier's antisubmarine warfare mission.
 The British Naval Arms Committee stated in September
 that up to 25 Harriers might be sold to India.   It is
 believed that delivery of the aircraft may be completed
 in two years if contracts are concluded in the near

 JAPAN-AUSTRALIA
 April 19, 1975
 Reduction of certain import barriers is among the
 topics being negotiated by Japan and Australia; the sub-
 ject is likely to be contentious.  Unless these restric-
 tions--imposed during the past year--are eased, they
 may cut significantly into the two countries' $6-billion
 yearly trade.
 Japan--now Australia's leading trading partner--will
 be the hardest hit by new Australian tariffs and quotas.
 About one quarter of Japan's exports to Australia are
 affected by the new restrictions, with textiles, steel
 products, and cars leading the list.  Australia, for
 example, initiated quotas on car imports after imports
 from Japan doubled in 1974 to $1 billion.  Additional
 trade restrictions now under consideration in Canberra
 could increase to 35 percent the share of Japanese goods
 covered by tariffs or quotas.
 Canberra finds objectionable the restrictions Tokyo
 imposed early last year on imports of beef.  These re-
 strictions all but eliminated a $250-million annual
 market for Australian meat.
 Tokyo, with US support, is pushing for an investi-
 gation of the Australian trade curbs by the council of
 the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  Australian
 officials, for their part, have threatened to embargo
 coking coal shipped to Japan unless the beef import re-
 strictions are lifted.
 No agreements to reduce restrictions are likely to
 emerge from these meetings.   Even a general economic re-
 lations treaty that was to be signed at the ministerial-
 level meetings next month is in trouble.   The two coun-
 t
 i
 r
 es have not been able to agree on a definition of
 most-favored-nation status and Australian controls on

 Cyprus:   Rival demonstrations by opposing women's
 groups in Cyprus tomorrow have the potential for vio-
 lence.  A group of foreign and Greek Cypriot women plans
 to hold a demonstration on the cease-fire line south of
 Famagusta to protest Turkish noncompliance with the UN
 resolution calling for safe return of refugees to their
 homes.
 Turkish Cypriot women have responded by schedul-
 ing a counterdemonstration
 for
 the same time.   They plan
 to protest past injustices
 at
 the :hands of the Greek Cyp-
 riots.
 The prospect that
 some
 of the women sympathetic
 to the
 Greek Cypriot cause
 may
 try to break through the
 Turkish
 lines has prompted
 UN
 officials to attempt to
 arrange a meeting between
 repr
 esentatives of the two op-
 posing groups between the
 Gree
 k and Turkish lines.   It
 is hoped the demonstrators will return peacefully to
 their respective sectors after the meeting.
