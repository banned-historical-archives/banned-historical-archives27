 The urgency of the financial question over which Premier
 Mollet fell on 21 May places the French assembly under con-

 theless, the complete absence of any clear alternative to
 Mollet's 16-month-old minority government ma  result in a

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 INDONESIA  .
 Page  1
 Tension remains high in the non-Javanese provinces
 of Indonesia, while central government officials in
 Djakarta are sharpI    nd    my divided on how to end
 provincial di     ection. Prime Minister Djuanda has ad-
 vocated a more conciliatory policy than Sukarno's and, as
 a result, has been publicly opposed by his own deputy prime
 minister and in one instance overruled by the army chief
 of staff.

 The UN Security Council debate on Suez ended on 21 May
 without any action, but the council remains seized of the
 question.   Israel may soon test canal passage, and could do
 so with little or no advance notice.

 Two weeks after the rightist defeat in the parlia-
 mentary by-elections, political events in Syria show
 further encroachment by leftists in the government and
 army.   The country remains in a state of limited martial
 law, and open criticism of the government may soon be
 silenced.  Foreign and domestic policy follow extreme
 leftist lines, and attacks on the United'States are in-
 creasing in frequency and bitterness.

 ADENAUER'S WASHINGTON VISIT  .  .  .  .  .  ..,  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 4
 Chancellor Adenauer is scheduled to begin his Washing-
 ton talks on 27 May at a time when West Germany is in the
 midst of a lively debate over disarmament and European
 security arrangements.   The approaching Bundestag elec-
 tions will make Adenauer unusually eager to demonstrate
 an identity of views with American leaders, since the
 opposition Social Democratic Party would exploit any
 SOVIET THREATS AGAINST ATOMIC ARMS FOR. WEST GERMANY   .  .  .  Page a
 The USSR's diplomatic warnings to Bonn that grave
 consequences are inherent in arming West German forces
 with nuclear weapons apparently are being supplemented
 by, planted reports that Moscow will not tolerate such a
 move and is prepared to take military action to prevent
 it.    These warnings, taking advantage of the nuclear
 arms controversy in West Germany, have been accompanied
 by hints that the USSR would make concessions on reuni-
 fication if Bonn would withdraw from NATO.   The Soviet
 Union made similar threats of military action in late
 1954,, when it was trying to block ratification of the
 Paris agreements bringing West Germany into NATO.
 GOMULKA GAINS SUPPORT AT CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING .  . . .  Page 6
 The Polish Communist central committee closed its
 ninth session on 18 May with a resolution reaffirming
 Gomulka's "October" program and the principles of Polish
 independence within the Soviet bloc enunciated in Gomulka's
 15 May keynote speech.  Although deep factional cleavages
 within the party have not been healed, Gomulka's firm
 policy statement, after six months of uncertainties and
 lack of control at the lower party levels, will probably
 win substantial support from the broad mass of hitherto
 uncommitted party functionaries.

 SOVIET-MONGOLIAN ECONOMIC AGREEMENTS    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 8
 The Soviet-Mongolian communique issued in Moscow on
 14 May itemizing new Soviet aid to Outer Mongolia marks
 another step in Moscow's policy of maintaining a major voice
 in Mongolian affairs while avoiding the appearance of direct
 control typical of the Stalin era.  Moscow has agreed to
 turn over control of the petroleum industry and mineral ex-
 ploitation and to provide financial assistance for Mongolia's
 three-year plan, which begins next year.  Peiping apparently
 is not contesting the continued dependence of Outer Mengolia
 on Soviet economic assistance and has hailed the agreements
 as indicating the existence of a "new equality and mutual
 "
 assistance
 between a large and small country.

 NORTH VIETNAM'S LAND REFORM POLICY MISCARRIES   .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 9
 The North Vietnam government's vacillating land re-
 form policy is creating dissatisfaction and confusion
 among the peasantry.   The regime is welshing on its
 promises to restore to small independent peasants land
 taken away from them during.the land reform campaign of
 1954-56.   Some members of the party district and village
 committees have resigned in protest over this zigzag
 policy.  Catholics, a large minority in North Vietnam, are
 among the most vocal critics.

 Premier Souvanna Phouma probably will remain in office
 and will be given a fresh opportunity to settle the Pathet
 Lao problem.  Souvanna is planning to make the Pathets a
 "take-it-or-leave-it" offer of a coalition government in
 return for promises of submission to the royal govern-
 ment's authority.                    The Pathets are unlikely to give these

 guarantees, but will probably seek to prolong ne
 in order-to further their subversive activities.                      25X1
 THE SITUATION IN HAITI                                .    . , .    .  Page 10
 A military government seized power in Haiti on 21 May
 but may have difficulty maintaining control, particularly
 if there is a general strike.  Despite an early announce-

 who engineered the bloodless coup, a serious rift may exist

 Argentina's provisional government believes that Peron,
 now in Venezuela, is a threat to its stability as long as
 he remains in the hemisphere, but efforts to have him ousted
 have failed.  Peronista exiles, especially in the five coun-
 tries neighboring Argentina, are engaged in propaganda

 Despite continued official insistence on uncon-
 ditional surrender of the insurgent Burma Communist Party,
 the Burmese government is reported divided on the question
 of a settlement.        It seems only a question of time before
 some kind of negotations are begun.          The campaign of the
 insurgent Communists to achieve legal status is being
 supported by other Communist groups and pro-Communist mem-
 bers of the Burmese parliament.

 FOOD SHORTAGE POSES THREAT TO EAST PAK[STAN GOVERNMENT .  .  Page  14
 Rapidly rising food prices in East Pakistan in recent
 weeks have endangered the provincial government, which is
 led by the eastern branch of Prime Minister Subrawardy's
 Awami League.  A similar food crisis in 1956 was an impor-
 tant factor in the downfall of the previous East Pakistan
 government, and a repetition could threaten Suhrawardy's
 central government coalition.  The central government is
 unlikely to secure the rice it needs from Southeast Asia,
 and may make an urgent request for additional American
 assistance.   F--                 I

 Greece continues to seek American intervention to break
 the deadlock over Cyprus and hopes continued quiet on the
 island will induce the British to reopen negotiations with
 Archbishop Makarios.  Britain hopes discussions on the inter-
 national status of Cyprus will be initiated within the NATO
 framework before it begins negotiations with the Cypriots on
 self-government.  NATO's Secretary General Spaak has already
 begun informal consultations with the permanent represent-
 atives of Britain, Greece, and Turkey.

 The Christian Democratic minority government of Adone

 on 29 May, but its chances are at present rated fairly good.
 Zoli reportedly is working out a program that might give
 his government more than "caretaker" status.

 SOUTH KOREAN ARMED FORCES COMMAND CHANGES   .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  Page 17
 The sweeping command changes in the South Korean
 armed forces recently announced by President Rhee were
 probably initiated to reduce factionalism, to improve
 morale and efficiency, and to assure delivery.of the mili-
 taryvote to the Liberal Party in the 1958 assembly elec-
 tions.  The changes are not likely to affect the combat
 capability of the armed forces and do not foreshadow
 preparations for a "march north."
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 PUBLIC DISCUSSION IN THE USSR  .  .  .  ..  .  . .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  Page 1
 The Soviet leaders, moving away from the arbitrariness
 of the Stalin era, are attempting, by encouraging public
 discussion, to enlist popular support for the solution of
 complex and pressing domestic problems.        Since 1953, when
 a public examination of "contradictions" in Soviet society
 was officially sanctioned, these discussions have been
 marked by increasing boldness and candlor, culminating this
 year in a frank airing of domestic problems and short-
 comings in the Soviet Communist Party press.   In order to
 keep these discussions under control, the regime finds it
 necessary continually  o redefine the limits of criticism.

 DETERIORATING CONDITIONS IN SPAIN
 .    .  .  .  Page 3
 The severe inflation in Spain is causing increasing
 dissatisfaction with Franco's regime even among the groups
 that have supported him in the past.  The Falange has been
 weakened by disaffection within its ranks, and elements of
 the church are moving to dissociate themselves from the
 regime.   In view of his skill in playing one group against
 another and his ability to suppress overt opposition, Franco
 probably is in no immediate danger.  However, his position
 is less secure than in the past.
 MAO TSE-TUNG'S UNPUBLISHED SPEECHES
 Mao Tse-tung, in two speeches on :27 February and 12
 March, which have not yet been published, stated in Marxist
 terms that differences or "contradictions" existed in China
 between the populace and the Communist leaders which might
 lead to strife if left to be handled by bureaucratic means.
 He emphasized that these differences were reconcilable and
 advocated persuasion rather. than force to resolve them.
 Moscow will find Mao's doctrines generally acceptable, al-
 though Soviet leaders have some reservations about their
 application.  Polish leader Gomulka has endorsed the doc-
 trines but has made clear'that he    i d   mit their appli-
 cation in Poland.

 The urgency of the finan-

 Mollet fell on 21 May places
 the French assembly under con-

 a new cabinet quickly.  Never-

 of any clear alternative.to

 President Coty's consulta-

 successor are complicated by
 the fragmented nature of the
 National Assembly, which gives
 Mollet's 100 Socialist deputies
 virtually a veto power on any
 new coalition.  There are re-

 return with a broadened coali-

 bloc  heartened by its success
 in recent by-elections and its
 improved tactical position in
 the assembly--has added to the
 pressure by calling for a non-
 Communist National Union govern-
 ment and by claiming that it
 could block the formation of a

 France's worsening finan-

 create counterpressures for a

 NOTES AND COMMENTS'
 Tension remains high in
 the non-Javanese provinces of
 Indonesia, while central gov-
 ernment officials in Djakarta
 are sharply and openly divided
 on how to end provincial dis-
 affection.
 In his first appearance
 before parliament since he as-
 sumed office in April, Prime
 Minister Djuanda stated on 17
 May that relations with the
 provinces must be readjusted,
 and that he intends to meet
 provincial demands as far as
 is possible.   Having just
 visited East Indonesia, Djuanda
 advised against the removal of
 the area commander, Lt. Col.

 Djuanda's deputy prime

 however, that he did not favor
 compromise with the provinces.
 On 18 May, the army announced
 the relief of Samual, on orders
 of Chief of Staff Iasution.
 Although President Sukarno did
 not become publicly involved in
 either issue, he undoubtedly
 approved the actions of both
 Hardi and Nasution.
 Samual is unlikely to obey

 Masjumi chairman Natsir, and
 police chief Sukanto--have
 highlighted regional determina-

 honoring Hatta.   Hatta strongly
 supported provincial demands
 and warned Djakarta that pre-

 lead to anarchy.  He tempered
 his support, however, by
 stating that regional activity

 that a general British-Egyptian
 rapprochement is taking place
 at the expense of the United
 States and France.   British
 officials in the past week have
 indicated no hurry to re-
 establish diplomatic relations
 with Cairo, and say that London
 hopes to negotiate a long-term
 settlement with "an Egyptian
 government," but not now.
 The Israelis are continu-
 ing their psychological war-
 fare campaign on the Suez is-
 sue.   Although Israeli ambassa-
 dor Eban last week stated offi-
 cially that Israel had no
 present plans for making a test
 of its right to use the canal,
 the Israeli embassy in Paris
 is briefing selected corre
 ,spondents to tiie effect that a
 ship is now being readied for
 such a test.   Israel is trying
 by these means to keep this
 question of its rights alive,
 and possibly also to provoke
 Egypt into making a bellicose
 gesture or statement which
 would give the Israelis a dip-
 lomatic advantage.
 Israel appears to be pur-
 suing somewhat similar tactics
 with regard to a test of the
 Tiran Strait.  and the Gulf of
 Aqaba.   Press reports, origi-
 nating with Israeli sources,
 have alleged that the Israeli-
 flag vessel Atlit, which is
 en route to Eilat around Africa,
 left Djibouti in French Somali-
 land on 20 May.   Lloyd's, how-
 ever, has reported that the ves-
 sel only left Durban,  South
 Africa, on 18 May, and it is
 now estimated that the Atlit
 will not arrive at Eilat until
 between 7 and 17 June.
 The Egyptians have made
 no clear public statement as
 to what their response to
 Israeli test attempts would be.
 Egypt
 apparently is still relying on
 the Saudis to meet the Israeli
 challenge on the Aqaba issue,
 since no statements on this
 have appeared.   If the Saudis
 allow an Israeli ship to pass
 the Tiran Strait,   Nasr might
 seek to use this fact to
 damage Saud's standing in
 Aralb eyes.

 state of limited martial law,
 and open criticism of the gov-
 ernment may soon be silenced.
 Pro-Western and moderate ele-

 ground to the leftist Baath
 and Communist forces.   Foreign
 and domestic policy follow ex-

 ADENAUER'S WASHINGTON VISIT
 Chancellor Adenauer is
 scheduled to begin his Washing-
 ton talks on 27 May at a time
 when West Germany is in the
 midst of a lively debate over
 disarmament and European secu- --
 rtty arrangements and when many
 Germans believe American policy
 toward Europe is undergoing a
 change.  The approaching Bun-
 destag elections will make Ade-
 nauer unusually eager to demon-
 strato  an identity of views
 with American leaders, since
 the opposition Social Democratic
 Party (SPD) would exploit any
 appearance of differences.
 The West Germans have been
 agitated by press reports that
 Washington plans a demilitarized
 zone "from France to Estonia"
 without German unification.
 These reports moved the SPD to
 charge that Adenauer's policies
 were "thoroughly compromised"
 and would collapse.  Even after
 Secretary Dulles' press state-
 ment on 14 May opposing any
 military arrangement in Europe
 based on Germany?s partition,
 only Adenauer's Christian Dem-
 ocratic Union (CDC) was osten-
 sibly convinced that no Amer-
 ican policy change.was in pros-
 pect.
 While Adenauer and other
 Bonn officials steadily in-
 sisted that a general disarma-
 ment agreement must include
 provisions for unification,
 their attitude has not crystal-
 lized in respect to limited
 agreement.  On 15 May the chan-
 cellor endorsed the idea of a
 "test tube" arms inspection area
 in :Europe, referred to by Pres-
 ident Eisenhower on 8 May, but
 emphasized that Soviet forces
 in :East Germany should come
 under such inspection.
 In general, Adenauer evi-
 dently believes that the West

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 May 1957
 Germans regard the Soviet po-
 sition on German matters as
 so hopeless that they will de-
 mand no major shift in Western
 policy.  Responding to what
 seems to be a public demand
 for "reasonable flexibility,
 however, Adenauer has twice
 recently offered to renounce
 military use of the East .zone
 upon German unification.
 German public opinion con-
 tinues to give Adenauer trouble
 on the question of nuclear weap-
 ons for the Bundeswehr.   The.
 latest opinion poll shows that
 72 percent of the people are
 opposed to its having such
 weapons and 77 percent are op-
 posed to the stationing of atomic
 weapons in',the Federal Republic.
 While in the period before the
 election the government will
 emphasize its desire for dis-
 armament, it probably holds to
 its public position of early
 spring that eventually the
 Bundeswehr  must have atomic
 arms if other "fourth powers"
 do.
 SOVIET THREATS AGAINST ATOMIC
 The USSR's diplomatic
 warnings to Bonn that grave
 consequences are inherent in
 arming West German forces with
 nuclear weapons apparently are
 being supplemented by planted
 reports that Moscow will not
 tolerate such a move and is
 prepared to take military action
 to prevent it.  These warnings,
 taking advantage of the nuclear
 arms controversy in West Germany,
 have been accompanied by pri-
 vate hints that the USSR would
 make concessions on reunifica-
 tion if Bonn would withdraw
 from NATO.
 The planted reports are
 intended to reinforce the warn-
 ings in Moscow's 27 April note
 to Bonn that arming the BundesL
 wehr with nuclear weapons would
 expose West Germany to a
 "terrible danger," would strike
 an "irreparable blow" at re-
 unification prospects, and
 would trigger an atomic arms
 race in Europe in which the
 Soviet bloc would take "appro-
 priate measures" to strengthen
 its defenses.
 These activities are remi-
 niscent of the Communist decep-
 tion campaign in late 1954 de-
 signed to block ratification of
 the Paris agreements which
 brought West Germany into NATO.
 At that time,  Moscow sought to

 Europe by circulating reports
 and rumors of imminent Soviet
 military action and general war.
 While the immediate aim
 might be to forestall atomic
 armament of the new West German
 forces,  the USSR may also seek
 to exploit both Germany's basic
 revulsion at the prospect of
 nuclear warfare and its desire
 for reunification,  to further

 of increasing popular opposition

 GOMULKA GAINS SUPPORT AT CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING
 The Polish Communist cen-

 session on 18 May with a resolu-
 tion reaffirming Gomulka's
 "October" program and the princi-
 ples of Polish independence with-
 in the Soviet bloc enunciated in
 Gomulka's 15 May.keynote speech.
 Although the deep factional
 cleavageswithin`.the party have
 not been healed, Gomulka's
 statement of a firm policy,
 after six months of uncertain-
 ties and lack of control at
 the lower party levels, will
 probably win him substantial
 support from the broad mass of
 uncommitted party functionaries.
 The final resolution, while
 clearly demanding full respect
 for Poland's national sovereignty
 and its own forms of building
 socialism, specifically renounced
 "national Communism" and pledged
 no revival of bourgeois charac-
 teristics.   It also expressly
 reaffirmed Poland's ties with
 the Soviet Union and branded
 as "false pretense" those
 claiLms voiced by members of the
 Stalinist Natolin faction that
 "the policy of the party leads
 to the weakening of the alliance
 with the USSR."

 of extremist views on both
 sides, it cited liberal tenden-
 cies as representing the great-
 est danger to socialism.   Party
 members guilty of either fac-
 tionalism or the public expres-
 sion of opposition to party
 policies were warned that they
 could be expelled for such
 activity.
 Franciszek Mazur--hitherto
 regarded as a leader of the
 Stalinist wing--reportedly pro-
 vided one of the dramatic mo-
 ments of the meeting by pro-
 claiming his loyalty to Gomulka's
 October program.  This move,
 coupled with broad Soviet public-
 ity  given to Gomulka's keynote
 speech, suggest Soviet endorse-
 ment of Gomulka's continued
 leadership of the Polish party.
 Mazur's gesture reportedly fol-
 lowed a bitter factional strug-
 gle in which Gomulka was sup-
 ported by former party chief
 Ochab,  and in which virtually
 every aspect of the October
 program came under criticism
 by the Natolinists.
 Two of Gomulka's closest
 collaborators, Zenon Kliszko and
 politburo member Jerzy Morawski,
 were nominated for secretaryships
 in the central committee.  The
 Natolin faction apparently did
 not even attempt a nomination
 of one of their number.  Ochab
 was relieved from his post as
 secretary,fr.eeing him to concen-
 trate his efforts on ;the keSr.tasks
 of agricultural reforms.   His
 removal does not appear to have
 been a demotion.
 A special resolution con-
 demning past security police
 activities placed the responsi-
 bility for them on former
 politburo member Jakub Berman
 and former security minister
 Stanislaw Radkiewicz and ousted
 both from the party, though it
 stated that neither of them was
 aware of these excesses.   The

 The Soviet-Mongolian com-
 muniqud'`issued in Moscow on 14
 May itemizing new Soviet aid
 to Outer Mongolia marks another.
 step in Moscow's policy of
 maintaining a major voice in
 Mongolian. affairs while avoiding
 the appearance of direct control
 typical of the Stalin era.   At
 the same time,  it apparently
 attempts to. bolster Outer Mon-
 golia's claim to UN membership
 as a fully sovereign state.
 Moscow has agreed to turn
 over control of the petroleum
 industry and the mineral ex-
 ploitationcompany and to pro-
 vide 200,000,000 rubles in
 financial assistance for Mon-
 golia's three-year plan, which
 begins next year.  Peiping, which
 has hailed the agreements as in-
 dicating the existence ofa "new
 equality and mutual assistance"
 between a large and small coun-
 try, apparently is not contest-
 ing the continued dependence
 of Outer Mongolia on Soviet
 economic assistance.
 The communique notes that
 Moscow had already made avail-
 able to Outer Mongolia 900,000-
 000 rubles ($225,000,000 at the
 official exchange rate) in the
 past ten years, and had turned
 over to it control of its bank-
 ing apparatus and certain rail-.
 road facilities.
 Although China in recent
 years has increased its partici-
 pation in the development of
 Outer Mongolia's economy,  it
 has contributed considerably
 less than the USSR.  The only
 loan Peiping is known to have
 extended, announced in August
 1956, consists of the equivalent
 of $40,000,000 and covers the
 years 1956-59.   The money is
 being used to build small in-
 dustrial plants,  and,according
 to Ulan Bator radio, "thousands
 of Chinese workers" are giving
 direct assistance in the de-
 velopment of industry and agri-
 culture.
 Communist China's improved
 standing in Outer Mongolia is
 indicated by the recent reshuf-
 fling of Mongolia's representa-
 tion in Peiping.  The former
 Mongolian ambassador has been
 recalled to Ulan Bator to take
 up the post of vice minister
 of foreign affairs.  The new
 ambassador is a man of consider-
 ably more prestige and was
 previously a vice premier.
 While there may be some
 truth in rumors that the Chinese
 Communist leaders are disturbed
 over the continued dependence
 of Outer Mongolia on Soviet
 economic assistance, Peiping
 is not in a position to contest
 Soviet predominance in the coun-
 try at this time.   Actually,
 Peiping has a genuine interest
 in seeing economic development
 take place in Outer Mongolia
 and has praised Soviet efforts
 along these lines. The Chinese
 apparently co-operated with
 the Russians and Mongolians in
 planning and achieving the rapid
 completion of the Trans-Mon-
 golian Railroad, which has
 shortened the Moscow-Peiping
 run by 715 miles, facilitating
 Sino-Soviet trade.  The Chinese
 Communists continue to support
 the Kremlin's efforts,to portray
 Outer Mongolia as a sovereign
 state.   F-         I (Con-

 NORTH VIETNAM'S LAND REFORM POLICY MISCARRIES
 The North Vietnam govern-
 ment's vacillating land reform
 policy is creating dissatis-
 faction and confusion among
 the peasantry.   The regime is
 welshing on its promises to
 restore to small independent
 peasants land taken away from
 them during the land reform cam-
 paign of 1954-56.   Some  mem-
 bers of the party district and
 village committees have re-
 signed in protest over this
 zigzag  policy.
 As a result of popular re-
 vulsion against the violence
 and other excesses of party
 workers in the land reform:
 campaign, an "error-correction"
 program was inaugurated last
 fall.  The party workers' bias
 in favor of the poorest peas-
 ants.~  during land reform had
 led to the dispossession not
 only of the larger landowners
 but also of many peasants own-
 ing and tilling small sections
 of land who were misclassified
 as landlords.   At the same
 time, estimates of normal crop
 yields had been set unreason;
 ably high to increase the-tax
 burden on the peasants.   Many
 of the party workers themselves
 became unsympathetic to party
 directives and were expelled
 from the party for failing to
 display the requisite zeal:
 Hanoi's efforts beginning
 last fall to correct the situa-
 tion did not have the desired
 effect of relaxing tensions in
 the countryside.   The main ob-
 stacle was resentment on the
 part of the'poor.peasants' who
 received land in the original
 land reform program.  The Hanoi
 party press last month noted
 that "individuals who were
 awarded land during agrarian
 reform" and participated in
 the denunciation of landholders
 are afraid that they now must
 give up part of their property.
 Faced with the possibil-
 ity of losing support of the
 poor, peasants, the Hanoi regime
 has shifted ground again and
 has begun to renege on its
 "error-correction" campaign.
 In February the restoration of
 property to former owners was
 ordered suspended, and today
 the regime is emphasizing the
 need to "rely completely on the
 poor peasants" in determining
 the reclassification of land-
 lorcls--a development which will
 presumably preserve for the
 poor peasants most of their
 gains under land reform.
 This new shift in land
 policy has evoked renewed crit-
 icism                                                               of the regime from the
 dispossessed small landowners
 who had hoped to get their
 property back.   Catholics, a
 large minority in North Viet-
 nam, appear to be among the
 most vocal critics.   After
 several riots occurred last
 gall, principally instigated
 by Catholics in rural areas,
 Hanoi pursued a policy of con-
 ciliation toward the Catholics.
 Now, however, individual priests
 are being denounced in the press,
 and the church is accused of
 "engaging in political activi-
 ties prejudicial to the policy
 of the state and the laws of
 the country."
 Although Hanoi would prob-
 ably like to scrap its error-
 correction program entirely,
 the regime sees a political need
 to appease small landowners and
 so is continuing the program
 in name at least.  It is in-      25X1
 creasingly nervous, however,
 about the effect of its Poli-
 cies on rural morale.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 May 1957
 LAOS
 The preponderance of evi-
 dence indicates that there will
 be no early government crisis
 in Laos and.that Premier Souvan-
 na Phouma will be given afresh
 opportunity to settle the Pathbt is
 Lao problem,  This development
 is due primarily to the fact
 that no Other Laotian political
 leader is capable of mustering
 sufficient support in the Na-
 tional Assembly to replace
 Souvanna:
 Souvanna, who is display-
 ing renewed confidence, is pre-
 paring to reveal to thbe. recently
 reconvened'National Assembly.a
 "new" plan for a "final" round
 of negotiations aimed at a
 settlement with the Pathet Lao.
 He has indicated that hbc~in-
 tends to make a "take-it-or-
 leave-it" offer of a coalition
 government in return for firm
 guarantees of Pathet submission
 to central authority.
 The prospects are that the
 assembly, anxious for peace and
 unity, will,support Souvanna's
 "new" approach..  The deputies,
 however, seem to be increasingly
 aware of the-
 Communist-orienta-tion of the Pathet ' Lao and prob-
 ably will resist beingrstaLmpeddd
 into a "give-away."settlement.,
 The Pathets are likely to
 seize on any offer from Souvanna
 as an opportunity to prolong
 negotiations' and to further
 their subversive activities.
 They are most unlikely to give
 the guarantees demanded by
 Vientiane, unless they can
 negotiate a substitution of
 language sufficiently vague to
 satisfy the form but not the
 substance of the government's
 demands.  They may, however,
 abandon their insistence that
 Laos immediately accept Chinese
 Communist aid as evidence of
 the royal government's neu-
 trality.
 Meanwhile, the Pathets,
 backed by Peiping. and Hanoi
 broadcasts, have opened a strong
 propaganda campaign to shift
 blame for the continued divi-
 sioix )6f t'the'couhtrr)on" American
 interference.   Pathet Lao lead-
 er Prince Souphannouvong, in a
 recent interview in Vientiane,
 justified Pathet demands for
 far-reaching concessions by the
 government on the grounds that

 In a conversation with US

 23 May 19 57
 Meanwhile, in a separate
 development, a new upsurge in
 army dissension has been high-
 lighted by the replacement of
 the war minister and the arrest
 on 22 May of the army commander
 in chief and some 20 other of-
 ficers.   Major points of army
 dissension reportedly include
 the man chosen as the new war
 minister,  the program for re-
 organization of the army, and
 the plans for holding elections
 to a constituent assembly prior
 to national elections.
 The air minister issued on
 22 May a strongly ;worded order
 of the day ordering air force
 members to tend to their jobs
 and .stay out of politics.   The
 navy is reported quietly back-

 prevent it from deteriorating in-

 BURMESE GOVERNMENT MAY NEGOTIATE WITH INSURGENT COMMUNISTS
 Despite continued official
 insistence on unconditional sur-
 render of the insurgent Burma
 Communist Party (BCP), the Bur-
 inese government is reportedly
 divided on the question of a
 settlement.
 Over the past six months,
 insurgent Communist Party chair-
 man Thakin Than Tun has sent
 a number of widely publicized
 letters to key government fig-
 ures, urging an end to the
 "civil war" so that "progres-
 sive" forces could work to-
 gether to promote Burma's de-.
 velopment.   Earlier letters in
 the series, while couched in
 conciliatory terms, sought to
 create the'impression that the
 BCP was dealing from a position
 of strength, and implicitly,
 placed the onus for continua-
 tion  of the conflict on the
 government.
 In the most recent letter,
 dated 10 May and addressed to
 the home minister, the BCP
 lowered the price for a settle-
 ment, suggesting that peace
 could be achieved if the govern-
 rent dropped the word "surrender"
 and replaced it with the word
 "amnesty."
 Other Communist groups
 have given support to the BCP's
 peace campaign through the
 medium of the Internal Peace
 Organization, a front group
 apparently created to propa-
 gandize insurgent peace feelers.
 It is- .headed by Thakin Kodaw
 Hmai:ng, a recipient of the
 Stalin "peace" prize who,   as
 Burma's "grand  old man of
 letteers, " has frequently served
 the Communists well as a front.
 Large crowds at many of the In-
 ternal Peace Organization's
 rallies.attest to growing pop-
 ular discontent over the lack
 .of any real security in all but
 the tew largest towns in Burma.
 The principal opposition
 to the government in parliament--
 members of the Communist-domi-
 h ated National United Front--
 is danducting a well-organized
 campaign to publicize the issue
 and bring popular opinion to
 bear on the government.   The
 appealing arguments of this
 group stand in sharp contrast
 to the government's weak rebut-
 tals?

 FOOD SHORTAGE POSES THREAT TO EAST PAKISTAN GOVERNMENT
 Rapidly rising food prices
 in East Pakistan in recent weeks
 have endangered the provincial
 government, which is led by the
 eastern branch of Prime Min-
 ister Suhrawardy's Awami League.
 A similar food shortage in 1956
 was an important factor in the
 downfall of the previous East
 Pakistan government,. and a
 repetition could threaten
 Suhrawardy's central government
 coalition.   The central govern-
 ment, unlikely to secure the
 rice it needs from Southeast
 Asia, may make an urgent re-
 quest for additional American
 assistance.
 While the activities of
 speculators have contributed
 to the 30-percent increase
 since mid-April in the price
 of rice, the basic cause is
 the failure to secure adequate
 imports.   The East Pakistan
 government,  lulled by a good
 winter rice crop, did not ask
 the central government to pro-
 CYPRUS
 Greek and Greek Cypriot
 leaders, seeking ways to break
 the stalemate over Cyprus, con-
 tinue to solicit American in-
 tervention.  Foreign Minister
 _Averoff told Ambassador Allen
 on 20 May that Greece and Arch-
 bishop Makarios could accept
 vide sufficient imports.   The
 central government has not
 secured even the inadequate
 amounts requested,. and although
 it now claims to have commit-
 ments for the amounts needed,
 it is still only negotiating
 for most of these supplies.
 .Suhrawardy has charged that
 rumors spread by, pro-Communists
 and speculators are behind the
 price rises and has ordered the
 central government to send ex-
 tra shipments to the area.   He.
 has also threatened to have the
 army patrol the border between
 East Pakistan and India to re-
 duce the widespread smuggling
 of rice to India.   Meanwhile,
 the provincial government has
 introduced modified rationing.
 These actions are not likely
 to halt the rising prices, how-
 ever, since additional imports
 of several hundred thousand tons
 are needed to. meet the minimum
 requirements.

 Scandinavia and then plans to
 proceed to the United States in
 time for the opening of the UN
 General Assembly session next
 fall.   Athens probably hopes
 that continued peace on Cyprus
 will lead to an invitation for
 Makarios to negotiate in Lon-
 don.   However, the British are
 not likely to receive Makarios
 except as part of a delegation
 of representatives of the vari-
 ous communities on Cyprus--
 Greek, Turkish and perhaps
 Maronite and Armenian.   The
 British Ambassador in Athens
 told his American colleague on
 17 May that his government
 would not be pleased if Makarios
 arrived in London uninvited.
 Nevertheless, he added, it would
 have to talk to him.
 Although London has not
 yet officially indicated any
 departure from its previous in-
 tention to retain bases on Cy-
 prus regardless of its eventual
 disposition, Governor Harding
 said on 6 May that Britain is
 reassessing the strategic value
 of the island.
 Britain hopes discussions
 on the international status of
 Cyprus will be initiated. within
 the NATO framework before it
 begins negotiations with the
 Cypriots on self-government.
 NATO's Secretary General Spaak
 has already begun informal con-
 sultations with the permanent
 representatives of Britain,
 Greece and Turkey.   Britain is
 prepared to.proceed with the
 partition of the island if Greece
 and Turkey cannot reach an agree-
 ment with London on another solu-
 tion of the problem.
 According to the British
 ambassador in Athens, London
 would prefer that Makarios
 meanwhile continue to "stew in
 his own juice in Athens."  How-
 ever, the American ambassador
 believes any  view that Makarios'
 influence is declining reflects
 wishful thinking, induced part-
 ly by Greek opposition politi-
 cians in contact with the Brit-
 ish embassy who are disgruntled
 over their failure to gain
 Makarios' support for  their
 own ends.
 The reported "ultimatum" to
 Britain on 20 May by the polit-
 ical. arm of EOKA probably rep-
 resents a Greek Cypriot effort
 to hasten British action regard-
 ing new negotiations.   It may
 also foreshadow some  kind of
 civil disobedience cam aign.
 The Christian Democratic
 minority government of Adone
 Zoli may depend on the "benev-
 olent abstention" of some of
 the small parties when it seeks
 parliamentary confirmation on
 29 May, but its chances of con-
 firmation are at present rated
 fairly good.   Zoli reportedly

 might give his government more
 than "caretaker" status.
 Zoli seems to have empha-
 sized technical competence in
 making his cabinet choices,  in-
 cluding one nonparliamentary
 member without any party affil-
 iation.   The appointments show
 a delicate balance among the
 factions within the Christian
 Democratic Party.
 Zo.li has scheduled his ap-
 pearance, before parliament for
 next week, presumably to pro-
 vide time to resolve internal
 party disagreements over the
 government program.   He intends
 to tackle the problems now be-
 fore parliament as well as
 others he considers urgent.  Re-
 portedly, however, Zoli has en-
 countered some opposition to a
 program which would give his
 government more than the care-
 taker functions to which the
 right wing of his own party
 would like to limit him.
 Though the Democratic So-
 cialists, who precipitated the
 crisis by withdrawing their 1'
 votes, have indicated that they
 will oppose a one-party govern-
 ment, the American embassy in
 Rome on 22 May still expected
 the government to win confirma-
 tion.   Preliminary estimates
 give Zoli a victory in the Sen-
 ate,,and 'from 274 to 334 favor-
 able votes out of a possible 590
 in the Chamber of Deputies, with
 enough abstentions in either
 case to ensure confirmation.
 If only the 265 Christian Demo-
 crats support him,  however,  the
 possibility of a new crisis is
 heightened.   The debate is ex-
 pected to last about a week.

 JAPAN CONSERVATIVES PLAN CRACKDOWN ON LEFTIST LABOR
 Japan's ruling Liberal-
 Democratic Party, under the
 guidance of Prime Minister Ki-
 shi's cabinet, is planning a
 new labor program which would
 curb the political power of. the
 leftist Japan General Council
 of Trade Unions (Sohyo), but
 would also include "progressive"
 features designed to have wide
 popular appeal.   The program
 provides for strengthening the
 penalties for illegal activities
 by Sohyo's 3,000,000 members,
 particularly strikes by public
 corporation employees.   The
 government has the support of
 business, the press, and the
 general public, all of which
 resent Sohyo's ability to stage
 strikes and violent demonstra-
 tions at will and with virtual
 impunity.
 The Liberal-Democratic Party
 has formed a labor policy com-
 mittee to draft a program which
 will be submitted to the Diet
 for legislative approval next
 fall.   The committee apparently
 contemplates some curtailment
 of the checkoff system, under
 which union dues are deducted
 in advance from salaries.   This
 has been one of the principal
 sources of funds used by Sohyo
 for political struggles in sup-
 port of the Socialist Party.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY

 The prospective program also
 would authorize the levying of
 fines and jail sentences for
 leaders of strikes against
 public corporations.   Such
 strikes are already illegal but
 punishable only by worker dis-
 charges, suspensions and repri-
 mands.   The legislation would
 also make public corporation
 unions responsible for finan-
 cial losses caused by their
 strikes.
 In the field of "progres-
 sive" legislation, the Liberal-
 Democrats are likely to study
 the implications of minimum
 wage legislation.   This has be-
 come an important issue in Japan
 which the Socialists have ex-
 ploited to some advantage.   The
 conservatives are under pres-
 sure to take action on the
 matter, but are opposed by small
 and medium-size  businesses
 which generally would be unable
 to absorb the increased cost.
 Nevertheless, the party feels
 obliged to make a start in this
 direction, in principle if not
 in practice.
 Sohyo, working through the
 Socialist Party, can be expected
 to fight against restrictions of
 its power and has threatened to
 follow up its nationwide strikes
 of ]L1-12 May with further strikes
 in June.   However,  the conserva-
 tive parliamentary majority, the
 widespread belief that Sohyo is
 overstepping its bounds, and
 evidence that leftist labor
 solidarity is breaking down in
 the face of government actions
 and threats, suggest that the
 cabinet's program can be enacted
 successfully.
 President Syngman Rhee an-
 nounced on 18 May the most
 sweeping changes yet made in
 South Korea's armed forces high
 command.   General Paek Son-yop,
 the commander of the first field
 army, was appointed chief of
 staff, and Lt. Gen. Yu Chae-hung,
 the former vice chief of staff,
 was assigned to be chairman of
 the joint chiefs of staff.   The
 latter post is of less importance
 in the South Korean army estab-
 lishment.   The command of the
 first army, which includes the
 bulk of the combat forces sta-
 tioned along the truce line,
 went to a relative unknown, Lt.
 Gen. Song Yo-chang, a former
 corps commander.
 Rhee probably had several
 motives in making the changes,
 including a desire to stamp out
 factionalism in the services and
 to assure his Liberal Party the
 military vote in the 1958 assem-
 bly elections.   He may also be-
 lieve that by making room for
 promotions and introducing new
 blood into command positions, he
 can improve morale and efficiency.
 The president very likely
 hopes that the removal of Gen-
 erals Yi Hyong-kun and Chong
 I1-kwon--the former chief of
 staff and chairman of the joint
 chiefs of staff respectively--
 will eliminate the bitter rival-
 ries which have plagued the South

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 May 1957
 the development of public dis-
 cussion has been one of the
 principal domestic goals of
 the post-Stalin regime,  By
 appealing to reason and re-
 treating from the arbitrariness
 of the Stalin era, the Soviet
 leaders are attempting to en-
 list active popular support for
 the solution of complex and
 pressing domestic problems.
 Since 1953, when Soviet
 citizens were officially per-
 mitted to examine "contradic-
 tions" in their society, public
 discussion has been marked by
 increasing boldness and candor,
 culminating this year in ex-
 tremely frank discussions of
 domestic problems and short-
 comings in the Soviet Commu-
 nist Party press.   The regime
 finds it necessary, however,
 continually to redefine the
 limits of these.discussions
 lest  they conflict with its
 interests.
 Public discussion. under
 Stalin was stifled by fear of
 the ubiquitous secret police,
 particularly after the great
 purges of the late 30's, and
 by official insistence on a
 facade of social harmony and
 economic prosperity.  The live-
 ly debates of the 20's over
 serious domestic issues gave
 Way to stagnant conformism.
 Following World War II,
 the Soviet regime, faced with
 the difficult task of reimpos:-
 ing the"strict ideological con-
 trol relaxed during the war,
 sought to gain support for'its
 policies by encouraging public
 discussion.  Although conducted
 within strict limits set by the
 regime, discussion in this
 period, both in the party and
 in  the professions, was con-
 siderably more candid than
 after mid-1948.
 Zhdanov, Stalin's spokes-
 man for ideological pur.ity'in
 this period, made the unpre-
 cedented assertion that there
 was a "conflict of contradic-
 tions" (a euphemism for impor-
 tanit unresolved problems) in
 the USSR and that it could be
 resolved primarily by "criticism
 and self-criticism."  This,
 Zhdanov maintained, constituted
 the principal dynamic element,
 the "moving force," in Soviet
 society, distinguishing it from
 capitalist society in which
 coercion and "class struggle"
 were said to prevail.
 This early postwar campaign
 to ensure ideological control
 through discussion and persua-
 sion failed, however, largely
 because of passive resistance
 to the regime's demands for
 economic austerity and intel-
 lectual conformity.  As a re-
 sult, from mid-1948 on, Stalin
 found it necessary to revert
 increasingly to his traditional
 policy of terror.  After 1948,
 the purge of "cosmopolitan"
 intellectuals, the decapita-
 tion of the Leningrad party
 organization and the transfer
 by force of "alien" people from
 the border areas of the USSR'
 poisoned the atmosphere of
 public discussion.  During
 Stalin's last years the Soviet
 people were in effect officially
 forbidden to see, hear, or speak
 evi]L about their domestic life.
 Since Stalin's death and
 the purge of secret police
 chief Beria, the Soviet leaders
 have attempted to stimulate
 pub]Lic discussions of important
 domestic problems,  again  with-
 in strict limits defined by
 the regime.   The convocation,
 on E6  fairly regular basis, of
 plenary sessions of the party
 central committee has served
 not only to reactivate the
 party as the leading political
 institution in the Soviet state
 but also to focus national at-
 tention on such outstanding
 problems as agricultural pro
 dut,tioa, icidustrial moderniza-
 tion, and, more recently, eco-
 nomic decentralization.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 May 1957'
 The regime has also spon-
 sored numerous professional
 meetings, published many new
 professional journals, and lib-
 eralized some of the security
 procedures in the professions.
 These measures, which have
 helped to reduce some of the
 barriers within and between
 professional groups, were de-
 signed to elicit professional
 know-how and public support for
 the solution of national prob-
 lems.
 Since 1954, when Zhdanov's
 dictum on the role of "criticism
 and self-criticism" as the
 "moving force" in Soviet society
 was revived intact, Soviet in-
 tellectuals have been examining
 domestic "contradictions" with
 increasing boldness and candor.
 Despite their use of Marxist
 jargon, these intellectuals have
 directed fairly pointed criticism
 at Soviet domestic life, some
 of them skirting perilously
 close to heresy.
 Beginning in the spring of
 1955, for example, some Soviet
 intellectuals intimated that
 low living standards were an
 important source of such so-
 called "survivals of capitalism"
 in the USSR as the anti-Soviet
 attitudes of the population.
 Others have held that differ-
 ences do exist within and be-
 tween Soviet social groups, and
 that, although they are not
 "antagonistic" nor comparable
 to the "class struggle" said to
 exist under capitalism, they
 can lead to serious conflicts
 of interest if they are not
 promptly recognized and dealt
 with by the party leaders.
 Although Soviet intellec-
 tuals have stressed in their
 public discussions the essen-
 tial harmony between the Soviet
 regime and people,  they have
 warned that toleration of "mis-
 takes" in policy can damage
 Soviet social stability.   The
 glossing over of real "contra-
 dictions" in Soviet society in
 Stalin's time, according to
 these intellectuals, disarmed
 Soviet cadres and left them ill-
 equipped to deal with the press-
 ing problems of the day.   They
 have candidly asserted that
 failure to recognize and struggle
 with existing domestic problems
 could weaken the USSR.
 Since De=Stalinization
 The reaction to de-Stalin-
 ization by elements within the
 Soviet party and population,
 as well as the events in Poland
 and Hungary last fall, appears
 further to have brought home
 to the Soviet leaders some of
 the glaring inadequacies in
 their domestic education and
 indoctrination program.  After
 their initial reaction to
 the Polish and. Hungarian de-
 velopments--the tightening of
 controls, the warnings against
 subversion, and the increased
 calls for vigilance--the So-
 viet leaders seem to have
 recognized that repressive
 words and deeds were inadequate
 to cope  with  real popular
 grievances.   The more candid
 and realistic. treatment this
 year of domestic problems in
 the Communist Party press in-
 dicates that the Soviet leaders
 believe that in the long run
 they can better control, and
 even reduce, popular dissatis-
 faction by'providing a legiti-
 mate avenue for public expres-
 sion in the state-controlled
 organs of public communication.
 By admitting publicly that
 the USSR is a good deal less
 than perfect, the Soviet lead-
 ers                                                        are attempting  to identi-
 fy themselves  with the inter-
 ests                                                        and aspirations  of the
 population  at large. By per-
 mittting  popular grievances
 to  be aired, as they were
 at the February Supreme Soviet
 meeting, the regime  hopes to
 steal the thunder from the so-
 called "politically immature"
 or "demagogic" elements in the
 population and to'convince the
 masses that it is seriously at-
 tempting to improve their
 material welfare.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 May 19 57'
 The difficulties Soviet
 leaders face in  controlling
 discussion  within the Commu-
 nist Party itself                     were re-
 cently  revealed by the party
 journal Kommunist,   which
 admitted  the existence of
 "contradictions"  within the
 party. Although      these "con-
 tradictions" were said to take
 the  form of "controversies"
 between "like-minded  persons
 over the best  ways and means
 of solving the tasks facing
 the party," the brunt  of
 Kommunist's criticism  was
 directed  against party mem-
 bers who had attacked party
 policies and the party apparatus.
 By admitting the existence of
 "contradictions" within the
 party and by criticizing "po-
 litically immature" party mem-
 bers, the regime is attempting
 to direct discussion within
 the party along desired lines
 and warn the "hostile" deviators
 of the potential dangers of
 their behavior.
 The efforts of Stalin's suc-
 cessors to develop professional
 and popular support by limiting
 the role of coercion in Soviet
 public life derive from a recog-
 nition that Stalin's methods
 were both dangerous and unproduc-
 tive over the long run.   Stalin.-
 ism had produced in the Soviet
 system a complex of internal
 disorders, none of which was
 fatal but which together threat-
 ened to retard seriously the
 growth of Soviet national power.
 The Soviet leaders have
 had,to appeal in some measure
 to the public, primarily be-
 cause their efforts to diagnose
 the real condition of Soviet
 society and remedy its disorders
 have been obscured and hindered
 by widespread public apathy and
 inarticulateness.   If these
 measures should fail, the regime
 would be faced with the prospect
 of reverting to terrorism ~;with'.all

 DETERIORATING CONDITIONS IN SPAIN
 The severe inflation in
 Spain is causing increasing dis-
 satisfaction with Franco's re-
 gime even among the groups that
 have supported him in the past.
 The regime is in no immediate
 danger, but the deterioration
 in its position seems likely to
 continue as the cabinet appointed
 three months ago delays coming
 to grips with the country's in-
 creasingly serious economic
 problems.
 Economic Difficulties
 Spain remains in the grip
 of strong inflationary pressures
 set off during 1956 by expand-
 ing bank credit, extensive def-
 icit financing of industrial
 development and welfare projects,
 and substantial wage increases
 without a corresponding rise
 in productivity.   Unusually
 severe winter weather which
 damaged citrus and olive crops
 BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEFICIT
 MILLIONS

 contributed to the economic
 difficulties by depriving Spain
 of approximately $100,000,000
 in much-needed foreign exchange.
 Spain entered 1957 with an
 estimated dollar reserve of
 only $20,000,000--less than a
 fifth of its holdings 14 months
 before--and the cost of living
 increased 12.5 percent from
 November 1956 to March 1957.
 Within the past few weeks a
 shortage of wheat has become
 a serious problem, and the gov-
 ernment has pressed the United
 States for emergency shipments
 of 500,000 metric tons of wheat
 before 30 June as an alternative
 to drawing on scarce foreign
 exchange.   The new crop is ex-
 pected to fall a million tons
 short of the country's annual
 consumption, and Spain is seek-
 ing still more American surplus

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 May 1957
 in a speech on 17 March, Franco
 referred to the economic crisis
 as "a small difficulty," and,
 except for seeking more Ameri-
 can aid, he has since taken no
 action suggesting a graver view
 of the problem.
 The only important step
 taken since the cabinet shake-
 up of 25 February is the re-
 placement of the multiple for-
 eign exchange system by a single
 import-export rate for the peseta
 in order to increase Spanish
 exports to dollar markets and
 reduce the large trade deficit.
 Various anti-inflationary
 measures still under discussion
 include the encouragement of
 foreign capital participation
 in Spanish enterprises, the es-
 tablishment of an  interminis-
 terial committee to examine
 expenditures, and reductions in
 the level of new debt issues in
 Bank of Spain credits to govern-
 ment organizations and in capi-
 tal allocated,to government-
 operated industry.
 Franco has three possible
 courses of action.   He can elect
 to do nothing, in which case
 present inflationary trends will
 continue; he can introduce a
 policy of retrenchment to combat
 inflation, taking the risk of
 further alienating the still
 powerful Falange; or he can fol-
 low a policy of big spending
 which, while stilling worker
 discontent temporarily, would
 ultimately contribute to infla-
 tion and further estrange labor
 as well as influential conserva-
 tive elements of his support.
 Disaffection in the Falange
 Franco is reluctant to
 adopt a policy of retrenchment,
 chiefly because he does not wish
 to face a showdown with the
 Falange--Spain's only legal
 political party and an important
 source of the regime's stability.
 The Falange has long sought--
 without much success--to develop
 strong labor support, and it
 would suffer a critical blow
 from a reduction in government
 spending for social and welfare
 projects accompanied by rigid
 wage controls under conditions
 of rapidly rising prices.   As
 it is, the economic crisis has
 been responsible for increasing
 disaffection in the Falange.
 Franco set the Falange back
 severely last winter when he
 rejected drafts of laws which
 would have ensured its position
 in Spain's political life.   The
 church, the army, and business
 and landowning interests have
 long opposed the Falange's ef-
 forts to consolidate its posi-
 tion, and Franco has always
 been careful to prevent any
 element of his support from be-
 coming too powerful.   Many
 Falangists believe that the
 party, though formally retain-
 ing its position in the 25
 February cabinet reshuffle, ac-
 tually lost further ground.
 An internal crisis in the
 Falange is apparent in the
 number of resignations tendered
 by minor party officeholders in
 recent weeks.   Resignations have
 been noted particularly in Va-
 lencia, where many Falangists
 reportedly fear that the long
 delay in naming a civil governor
 may mean the army and church
 have been successful in bring-
 ing about a separation of the
 functions of the provincial
 head of the Falange from those
 of the civil governor.   Franco's
 reduced support is most apparent
 among the party "old shirts"--
 pre-Civil War members--whose
 mainstays in the cabinet have
 been replaced by considerably
 less important narty fi or?roc
 Other Falangists, notably
 the poet Dionisio Ridruejo,have
 left the movement in the past
 year or so and are trying to

 the left.   The American embassy

 MAO TSE-TUNG'S UNPUBLISHED SPEECHES
 On 27 February Mao Tse-
 tung delivered an address before
 the Supreme State Conference
 on "The Correct Handling of
 Contradictions Within the Ranks
 of the People."  The Supreme
 State Conference is a gathering
 of China's top officials con-
 vened at irregular intervals
 to hear Mao set new lines for
 Peiping's major policies.   Fol-
 lowing the conference, Mao
 spoke on the same subject at
 the National Conference on
 Propaganda Work on 12 March.
 Mao's remarks have not
 publish
 Chinese press is carrying-ex-
 tensive commentaries on Mao's
 analysis.  From these com-
 mentaries, the following emerge
 as Mao's key points:
 (1) Mao distinguished be-
 tween two types of contradic-
 tions, i.e., antagonistic con-
 tradictions "between us and
 the enemy" (which are irrec-
 oncilable) and nonantagonistic
 contradictions (which are ad-
 justable).   Cautioning that
 the latter could become an-
 tagonistic if badly handled,
 he stressed the need for per-
 suasion rather than force in
 mollifying malcontents.   He
 noted that China's present con-
 tradictions were largely antag-
 onistic; for example, the con-
 tradiction between the people's
 demand for higher incomes and
 the economic conditions that
 thwart this demand.   There are
 also contradictions between
 the military and the populace,
 between military officers and
 enlisted men, between peasants
 and workers, between co-opera-
 tives and peasants, and between
 government organs of upper and
 lower levels.   Above all, Mao
 addressed himself to the con-
 tradiction between the people
 and the leaders.
 (2) In discussing remedies,
 Mao stressed the urgency of cor-
 recting bureaucratic methods of
 leadership.   In accordance with
 his recommendations, the party's
 central committee has called
 for a program to rectify bureau-
 cratic habits among officials,
 who have been directed to gain
 new insights into local problems
 by establishing direct contact
 with the populace.   Party, gov-
 ernment and military officials
 have been urged to engage in
 manual labor "among the masses,"
 adopt a self-critical attitude,
 and permit the populace to ex-
 press their opinions "boldly
 and freely."
 (3) Mao warned against
 the errors of dogmatism and
 doctrinairism and strongly re-
 affirmed his policy to "let all
 flowers bloom and diverse schools
 of thought contend."
 Mao's remarks on this
 point were critical of tight
 Soviet control over the arts,      125X1

 (3) A march by dissatisfied
 cadres from Chengting toward
 Peiping to present their griev-
 ances to Mao.                       They were per-
 suaded to turn back.  The method
 reportedly recommended by Mao
 for resolving internal contra-
 dictions was the method of
 patient persuasion and ideo-
 logical re-education rather
 than crude or "administrative"
 methods.
 Mao reportedly analyzed
 two kinds of democracy,  One
 was "big. democracy," which
 meant strikes, demonstrations
 and other strong manifestations
 of the popular will.. The other
 was "little democracy," which
 meant all forms of argument,
 negotiation and discussion.
 Within the ranks of the people,
 "little democracy" was normal-
 ly correct, but nevertheless
 there might sometimes be scope
 and need for "big democracy."
 The deputy director of the
 party's propaganda department
 stated on 7 May that the Chi-
 nese populace had the "right to
 demonstrate &Ad strike" and
 that "no leaders of strikes
 should be penalized."
 In Poland, Mao's views have
 been hailed by the liberal Com-
 munists as support of their de-
 mands for complete freedom of
 discussion and dissent, and the
 trade union newspaper Glos
 Pracy keyed Mao's remas on
 "allflowers" to a denuncia-
 tion of local "Stalinists;"
 At the recent Polish party
 plenum, Gomulka endorsed Mao's
 doctrines, including the "all
 flowers" thesis.  At the same
 time, he made clear he would
 limit the application of this
 doctrine in Poland when he at-
 tacked the liberal Communist
 "revisionists" who endanger the
 regime by advocating or tolerat-
 ing_  anti-Communist views.
 The Soviet leaders will
 probably react to Mao's speeches
 with mixed emotions.  Part of
 Mao's thesis, particularly his
 view on contradictions, is gen-
 erally in line with long-held
 Soviet views on this subject
 (See Part III, p.1), and a key
 Chinese editorial in Mao's
 analysis of contradictions was
 reprinted in Pravda in April.
 The Soviet leaders appar-
 ently considered the Chinese
 editorial in harmony with their
 own campaign against bureaucrat-
 ic practices in the Soviet ad-
 ministrative structure.  They
 may also have intended, in
 taking note of a major pronounce-
 ment by Mao, to emphasize the
 close ties which exist between
 Moscow and Peiping.
 Mao's theory of "big democ-
 racy,"' with its implied accept-
 ance of the right to strike,
 however, will probably be dis-
 tasteful to Moscow at a time
 it is experiencing troubles
 with labor unrest.  Even more
 disagreeable to the Kremlin
 would be Mao's alleged slap at
 Soviet cultural policy contained
 in the "birds of a feather"
 reference.
 Actually, Mao's thesis of
 contradictions within a social-
 ist society is no great de-
 parture from Soviet theory,
 which has also drawn a sharp
 line between "antagonistic" and
 "nonantagonistic" contradictions.
 Chinese commentaries ' on the
 speech do. not support the in-
 ference made by some Western
 observers that Mao held the
 "system" gives rise to insoluble

 23 May 1957
 problems between the party and
 the populace.  Like Soviet the-
 orists, the Chinese writers
 insist that the socialist system
 is "correct."  The Chinese, how-
 ever, have given greater empha-
 sis than the Russians to the
 theme that, even with the best
 "system," all Communist parties
 are fallible, and all must be
 vigilant to keep their mistakes
 from becoming widespread and
 lasting.
 Mao's purpose in making
 the speech is to be found in
 his apparent determination to
 apply to Communist China the
 lessons of unrest in Poland and
 Hungary.  His preoccupation with
 the contradiction between the
 people and their leaders sug-
 gests that he saw some parellels
 between popular unrest in East-
 ern Europe and the state of
 morale in China, and supports
 other reliable evidence of
 growing alienation of the Chi-
 ese populace from the leader-
 ship.
 The Communist Party line is
 a notoriously shifting guide to
 action, but for the present,
 Mao's speech would appear to
 assure a "soft" approach by
 Peiping's leaders to China's
 internal problems.  With respect
 to intrabloc relations,  Mao's
 prestige is such that few Com-
 munist leaders will dismiss
 lightly his appeal to avoid the
 use of force except as a measure
 of last resort.  While the USSR
 is probably annoyed at the anti-
 Soviet overtones being read in-
 to Mao's speech, Mao is far
 from  aligning  himself With`..
 hostile;..oritics  of  Kremlin.'.
 policies.  When force must be
 applied, as it had to be in Hun-
 gary, Mao provides Moscow with
 a ready rationale in the thesis::
 that repressive measures are
 justified against groups who
 cause nonantagonistic, contra-
 dictions to take on an antag-
 onistic, or "enem  " form.
