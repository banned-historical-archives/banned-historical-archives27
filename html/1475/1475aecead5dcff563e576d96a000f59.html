 Portugal: Facing TouVaah Problems
 ^
 An incipient rebellion in the Azores added
 to Portugal's troubles this  past week when
 separatists turned a farmers' protest demonstra-
 tion into a ral:y for independence from the
 mainland. The demonstrators forced the resigna-
 tion of the civil governor of Sao Miguel Island,
 thus dramatically focusing Lisbon's attention on
 the  growing  independence sentiment in the
 Azores.
 Lisbon's response was twofold: it promised
 a sympathetic hearing to the Azoreans' legit-
 imate economic grievances, while at the same
 time clamping tight restrictions on separatist
 activities. On June 10, Portuguese authorities
 arrested 29 suspected leaders of the movement
 in Sao M'auel. The leftist-controlled media in
 Portugal are criticizing military and police of-
 ficials in the Azores for their handlii,g of the
 demonstration,  and  a  purge of Portuguese
 representatives in  he Azores known to h., in
 sympathy with the separatists seems likely to
 follow.
 Unlike  Portugal's African  colonies,  the
 Azores are regarded as an integral part of the
 mainland. Lisbon will probably yield to many of
 the economic demands of the Azoreans, but has
 mad-2  known  its  strong opposition    to  the
 nascent independence movement.
 Although  the separatists have demon-
 strated that they have the necessary following to
 create public disturbances, they have also shown
 themselves to be badly organized and extremely
 vulnerable.  Further  demonstrations  by  the
 separatists have been proscribes; by the Portu-
 guese authorities, and the movement is expected
 to go underground for a wIiile.
 Meanwhile, Lisbon is faced with serious
 problems in Angola where the military situaticn
 continues to worsen. Hostilities between the
 Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola
 and the National Front are pushing the territory
 to the brink of civil war. Additional Portuguese
 troops were airlifted to Angola last weekend,
 but leading Portuguese military authorities are
 in general agreement that there is little they can
 do to control the fighting there. Continuing
 strife in Angola will lead to a further exodus of
 refugees to Portugal and a further rise in un-
 employment there. Even more important, the
 Angolan developments will cast a pall over the
 Armed  Forces  Movement's  most  significant
 achievement to date-decolonization.
 On the home front, the festering dispute
 between the Movement and the Socialist Party
 over press freedom abated somewhat after the
 Socialists agreed to remain in the coalition gov-
 ernment in exchange for the reopening of the
 party newspaper, Republica. The critical issue in
 the Republica dispute-whether the Communist
 printers or the Socialists' editorial board would
 exercise control of the paper-was resolved by

 the government in favor of the Socialists. The
 printers are still demanding a voice in editorial
 policy, however, and the agreement could come
 unglued at any time.
 A potentially explosive conflict with Por-
 tug-il's Catholic Church is also gathering momen-
 tum. Lisbon's Cardinal Ribeiro told US embassy
 officials that Communist seizure of the radio
 station operated by the Church and government
 interference in  parochial  schools are rapidly
 leading to a church-state confrontation. De.iun-
 elation of Movement policies from the country's
 pulpits could deal a crippling blow to the ru!ing
 military's already waning popularity.
 Portugal's leaders are not faring any better
 in their efforts to solve the nation's zconomic
 headaches. When EC Council President Garrett
 FitzGerald visited Lisbon last week, government
 officials pleaded for EC assistance to shoYP up
 the sagging economy. FitzGerald noted that EC
 loans could be made only for specific projects
 and not solely to reduce balance-of-payments
 pit:,sures. As has happened repeatedly in the
 past, the Poi iuguese were unable to come up
 with specific proposals. FitzGerald emphasized
 the need for Portugal's political development
 along democratic lines and a reduction of corn-
 munist influence
 FitzGerald  himself is prepared to argue
 within the EC for early aid. EC foreign ministers
 may agree in principle to be forthcoming with
 assistance to Portugal when they meet later this
 month, but implementation of more generous
 terms for renewing the trade agreement will be
 tied to the further course of events in Portugal.
 The US embassy in Lisbon has reported
 growing popular disenchantment over the direc-
 tion                                                                  of  Movement policies and  its  seeming
 inability to cope with the country's urgent prob-
 lems.  While the embassy believes                                                                   Portugal's
 experiment with consensus government could
 still continue for a time, it also believes that
 there is a possibility of one-man rile if the
 government does not soon begin to deal more
 Ango'a: On the Brink
 The rival armies of the two main nation-
 alist groups in Angola's transitional government
 again engaged in heavy fighting in Luanda dur-
 ing the past week. Coming on top of recent
 clashes between the same groups throughout a
 wide area north and east of the capital and in
 tt,: exclave of Cabinda, the latest round of fight-
 ing appears to have edged the troubled territory
 closer to all-out civil war.
 Most of the fighting over the past three
 weeks was touched off by the Soviet-backed
 Pcpular Movement for the Liberation of Ango!a,
 which has become militarily stronger than it was
 last winter when the National Front for the
 Liberation of Angola appeared to have a decided
 edge in troops and guns. At present, neither the
 Popular Movement nor the National Front has
 the supplies or mobility to force a military
 showdown. Both groups appear to be preparing
 for such an eventuality, however.
 Outside  Luanda,  each  croup  has  now
 largely secured the areas in which its ethnic
 support is strongest, clearing them of the troops
 of the rival organization. This development has
 undermined a key provision of the independ-
 ence accord that all three nationalist groups
 signed with the Portuguese Dist January. I t had
 assured each group the right tr engage freely in
 political activity throughout the territory.
 In the capital, where three rounds of fight-
 ing have occurred since March, neither group is
 clearly dominant at this time. The initiative
 seems to rest with the Popular Movemc.-it, which

 also appears to be in a good position to disrupt
 the National Front's supply routes to the city
 from  northern Angola. Portuguese forces in-
 tervened in the latest Luanda fighting more
 forcefully than in the past, losing at least three
 dead. After the fighting ended, the Portuguese
 raided arms depots in the city, a move that
 could throw the Popular Movement and the
 National Front off balance for the time being.
 In Cabinda, representatives of the three
 nationalist groups reportedly signed a cease-fire
 that calls for each group to maintain only, a
 token military force in the largest city. During
 the fighting, the Popular Movement, which has
 been active in Cabinda much longer than its
 rivals, apparently succeeded in driving forces of
 the National Front from the city and the adjoin-
 ing countryside.
 Further serious fighting seems un.'kely,
 pending the outcome of a meeting of the leaders
 of the three groups that is scheduled to begin in
 Nakuru, Kenya, on Sunday. The meeting was
 promoted by Jonas Savimbi, head of the Na-
 tional Union for the Total Independence of
 Angola, smallest of the three nationalist groups.
 Savimbi has emerged as a conciliator in recent
 months. His group has tried to stay neutral, but
 was drawn into the recent fighting in Luanda.
 At "the Nakuru meeting, Savirnbi, Popular
 Move:,R,~nt leader Agostinho Neto and National
 F.-ont president Holden Roberto, as a means of
 easing competition among them, may discuss
 postponing cor:stituent assembly elections until
 after Angola receives independence in Novem-
 ber. They may also try to reach agreement on a
 candidate to ;iez 3  a post-independence govern-
 ment., It seems clear that any bargains struck at
 the meeting will only serve to postpone a final
 r".ckoning between Roberto and  Neto, who
 opnrete.

 Consorflu

 nisi?n
 After more than a year of intensive nego-
 tiations, the four-nation consortium composed
 of Belgium,  Denmark, the Netherlands, and
 Norway has agreed to buy the US-made F-16
 fighter as a replacement for the obsolete F-104
 aircraft. Some of the governments, however,
 face sharp domestic criticism as a result of their
 decision, which is regarded as a blow to hopes of
 developing a European aircraft industry. The
 opposition parties as well as the left wings of the
 governing parties in these countries may revive
 the issue if defense spending and unemployment
 become contentious questions in the future.
 France spearheaded the campaign to "buy
 European," and vigorously promoted its Mirage
 F-1E. Francophones in the bilingual Belgia.i gov-
 ernment favored the Mirage, and Prime Minister
 Tindemans may be in political difficulty as a
 result of the decision. There wee veiled hints
 that Paris might consider cooperating in Euro-
 pean defense matters if the consortium chose
 the Mirage. Sweden, with its entry, the Viggen,
 tried to exert pressure o:' Denmark by stressing
 "Scandinavian solidarity" and, like France, of-
 fered a substantial eleventh-hour price reduc-
 tion. All  three planes fulfill NATO require-
 ments, but the greater production run for the
 F-16-which was also selected by the US Air
 Force--made the American entry the best eco-
 nomic choice. Additionally, some countries may
 get sub-contracts for F-16 components that will
 exceed their expenditures for the planes.
 Last  month, Denmark, the Netherlands,
 and Norway agreed to purchase the F-16 pro-
 vided Belgium followed suit. The decision was
 most difficult for Brussels because of its strong
 cultural ties to Frame and the extensive French
 business interests in 3elgium. Two of the three
 parties in Prime Minister Tindemans' coalition
 government  have French-speaking wings, and
 the other is entirely French-speaking. Neverthe-
 less, the government won a narrow vote of con-
 fidence in parliament yesterday following a chal-
 lenge by a                        French-speaking opposition party
 that favored the Mirage.

 The minority Social Democratic govern-
 ment in Denmark also has been criticized for its
 choice of the F-16, but easily won pro forma
 parliamentary approval on Wednesday despite a
 Communist-inspired demonstration in Copen-
 hagen  earlier this week. Nevertheless, Stock-
 holm's last-minute offer to Copenhagen of a
 25-percent reduction in the price of the Viggen
 may yet cause Prime Minister Jorgensen prob-
 lems in  Denmark, where there are few sup-
 porters of large outlays for defense.
 The Dutch government also encountered
 opposition, especially from leftists in parliament
 who oppose the purchase of any plane to re-
 place the F-104. Prime Minister den Uyl, how-
 ever, has the backing of the coalition parties for
 his decision, which was predicated on a unani-
 mous choice by the consortium, and does not
 require  parliamentary approval.  Nevertheless,
 one of the small parties in the five-party coali-
 tier has called for an investigation to determine
 whether the aircraft companies may have tried
 to influence The Hague's selection. Although
 the debate over the government's decision will
 probably subside gradually, developments at the
 recent Dutch Labor Party congress are indicative
 of growing anti-Americanism in Dutch political
 life that Dutch leasers will have to deal with
 before the elections ir, 1977.
 Only the Norwegian government can ex-
 pect little challenge over its choice. A strong
 supporter  of  NATO and the  Atlantic com-
 munity, Norway attaches great importance to
 Western defense cooperation. In additinn, Osio's
 oil wealth will enable it to maintain a relatively
 effective defense contribution to NATO, while
 at the same time underwriting the extensive and
 expensive domestic social welfare programs that
 Norwegian voters demand.

 Another  inconclusive  round  of  inter-
 communal talks was held in Vienna last week
 under the auspices of UN Secretary General
 Waldheim. Greek Cypriot negotiator Clerides
 and Turkish Cypriot negotiator Denktash could
 not come to grips with major issues because the
 constitutional committee commissioned at the
 first Vienna round last month failed to make
 any headway on the powers of the central gov-
 ernment in the proposed federation. The nego-
 tiators, apparently under pressure from Athens
 and Ankara, went through the motions in order
 to maintain the cordial atmosphere created at
 the meeting of the Greek and Turkish prime
 ministers in Brussels. last month.
 On June 13, the UN Security Council will
 hear Waldheim's noncontroversial report on the
 status  of a negotiated Cyprus settlement.  It
 notes the lack of progress, but calls for the
 continuation of negotiations between the two
 parties. Waldheim, reported to be displeased
 with the slow pace of the negotiations, is aware
 of the need to preserve the present negotiatin
 UK: CLOSER TIES TO EUROPE
 The negotiators did have some heated ex-
 changes. Denktash refused to set forth concrete
 positions or, the territorial and refugee questions
 as promised in the earlier round, citing as justifi-
 cation the lack of progress in delimiting the
 structure of the proposed federation. He pre-
 sented some tentative views on the powers and
 functi-ns of the central government and also
 propo  d that a joint transitional central govern-
 ment be established, pending a final settlement.
 Clerides did not respond to the proposals
 on the central government because Denktash
 had refused to discuss the territorial and refugee
 issues. Clerides did give conditional acceptance
 to the proposal for an interim government, and

 The substantial margin by which British
 voters approved continued participation in the
 Comr,'on Market signals changes in both domes-
 tic political alignments and in Britain's relation-
 ships with the EC.
 Prime Minister Wilson's cabinet reshuffle
 may have  eased post-referendum tensions in
 Britain, but the EC states may respond coolly to
 at least one of the change. by shifting anti-EC
 leader Anthony Benn from industry minister to
 secretary of state for energy, Wilson has mini-
 mized the adverse domestic reaction that would
 have res,ilted from demoting him to a i .ss pres-
 tigious post. Nevertheless, some questions will
 be raised about the wisdom of placing Benn in
 the sensitive energy cost. Britain has not been
 enthusiastic about supporting a common EC
 energy policy, and Benn's appointment may be
 taken by the EC as a signal that the UK intends
 to continue  its  independent  line  on energy
 matters. Benn's debut on June 26 in the EC
 Council debate on new energy proposals should
 provide some indication of whether his appoint-
 ment portends continued British reservations in
 this arei of EC cooperation.
 The pledges of support to the government
 by all seven anti-EC ministers immediately after
 the referendum and Wilson's careful changes in
 the cabinet appear to have restored Labor Party
 unity for the time being. The cabinet reshuffle
 has been accepted with a minimum of grumbling

 rrune Minister Wilson announces that the British people voted overwhelmingly to stay in in the EC
 by the British public, and Wilson hp . avoided
 the necessity of forming a coalition government,
 as Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher
 had suggested.
 The  Conservative  Party  leadership  may
 eventually be affected by the outcome of the
 referendum. Thatcher lost considerable prestige
 by the low profile she maintained in the cam-
 paign, in contrast to the extremely favorable
 pt. 'lic response to the vigorous pro-EC cam-
 poign waged by her principal rival, former prime
 minister Edward Heath.
 Britain's partners, although they had as-
 sumed the referendum would be positive, never-
 theless were relieved that the uncertainty over
 UK membership had been removed. Typical of
 the public reaction in Western Europe was Ger
 man  Chancellor Schmidt's comment that he
 greeted the outcome with "sz.tisfaction and
 joy," and Commission President Ortoli's remark
 that the  vote  marked a "new point of de-
 parture" for the EC. Danish politicians, mean-
 while, were particularly glad that the results in
 Britain obviated the need for a referendum in
 Denmark.
 Community diplomats are aw;re, howevor,
 that the referendum only establishes the mini-
 mum condition for development of the EC and
 does not assure it. They will be disappointed if
 London does not soon bee i to show a more
 positive attitude toward the ,.ommunity, at least
 by the next EC summit in mid-July.
 Now that the British voters have reaffirmed
 support for continued membership in the EC,
 the Labor Party will soon end its long boycott
 of the European Parliament by choosing its
 representatives to that organization. The British
 trade unions have also announced their inten-
 tion to join various EC committees.
 Although these actions would have a defi-
 nite invigorating effect on the community, a
 more important indication of British attitudes
 will be London's recommendations for the re-
 port on the next steps toward European Union
 being prepared by Belgian Prime Minister Tinde-
 mans. Britain, along with Denmark, has not yet
 committed itself to direct elections to the Euro-
 pean Parliament by  1978. However positive
 London's  attitude  toward getting the Com-
 munity  moving  again,  concern  persists that
 Britain's economic problems may lead to various
 calls for special treatment that would again test
 EC solidarity. The EC Commission has quietly

 The campaign for regional and local elec-
 tions on June  15-16  ends  today, with  the
 dominant Christian Democrats still hoping to
 keep their losses to the left within the 2-3 per-
 cent range by attracting increased support from
 moderate and conservative voters.
 running on joint slates with the Communists in
 more localities this year than ever before. The
 Socialists, caught off guard, merely reiterated
 their demand for a "free hand" at the local
 level.
 The harsh d-bate between the Christian
 Democrats  and  the  Socialists  continued  to
 dominate the campaign in its final week. Atten-
 tion was distracted                     from  regional and local
 issues throughout the campaign by discussion of
 what     vote would mean for national po!itics.
 The entire Socialist campaign has been an
 elaboration on two of their most widely broad-
 cast electoral slogans: one advising voters that
 "Italy is changing, but the Christian Democrats
 are not," and the other asserting that a vote for
 the Socialists is the only vote for the left that
 will "really bother the Christian Democrats."
 They charge that the Christian Democrats, after
 nearly 30 years as Italy's dominant party, are
 too corrupt and conservative to respond to the
 problems that have accompanied rapid social
 and economic change in Italy. Concerned that
 voters inclined to switch to the left might turn
 to the Communists, the Socialists have insisted
 that theirs is the only party-by virtue of its
 acce--s to the government-that cen actually use
 leftist votes as leverage against the Christian
 Democrats.
 The Christian Democrats, while claiming
 credit for Italy's postwar transformation to an
 industrialized  sot.iilty,  have  hit  hard  at the
 Socialists' failure to advance specific proposals.
 Christian Democrat leader Fanfani, meanwhile,
 has continued to dramatize the need for tough
 law enforcement and to attack the Socialists for
 their equivocal attitude toward anti-crime meas-
 ures re'.ently passed by parliament.
 Fanfani also stepped up his attack this
 week on the distinctior: the Socialists make
 Among the reasons the Socialists insist on
 this point is the fact that they may have an
 opportunity after the elections to join the Com-
 munists in administering two more regions; they
 already share power with the Communists in the
 latter's  north-central  strongholds  of  Emilia-
 Romagna,  Tuscany,                                                                                  and  Umbria.  The    two
 parties   now  stand  a chance of gaining slim
 majorities in the neighboring regions of Marche
 and Liguria.
 Foreign policy issues continued to hinder
 the Communists in their efforts to campaign on
 the claim of running efficient administrations at
 the regional and local levels. Communist chief
 Berlinguer has complained, for example, about
 the preoccupation of the press with such issues
 as Portugal and relations with Moscow. The
 Communists,  nevertheless,  have  mounted  a
 vigorous and well-organized campaign and are
 likely to continue their postwar trend of steady
 gains at the polls.
 As the campaign drew to a close, party
 leaders began to think out loud about the future
 of Prime Minister Moro's Christian Democratic -
 Republican coalition, still widely regarded as a
 stop-gap  measure to get the country through
 the elections. Most comments were cautious,
 howaver, and no party leader is yet demanding
 Moro's resignation right after the elections. The
 Socialists would probably trigger a crisis if they
 scored dramatic gains-upwards of 3 percent for
 example-but even they seem more inclined to
 leave Moro in place through the summer. That
 would give both the Socialists and the Christian
 Democrats time to firm up bargaining positions
 on the tErms for a new government and to have
 between
 themselves and  th? Communists.

 FINLAND: GOVERNMENT RESIGNS          FRANCE: NUCLEAR TESTING RESUMES
 The deeply divided  four-party cralition
 broke up after failure of repeated attempts to
 resolve persistent disagreements. The dispute be-
 tween the two major coalition partners-the So-
 cial Democrats and Kekkonen's Center Party-
 started  in  April  when the Center Party an-
 nounced it would not support the government's
 regional  development  package.  Despite  Kek-
 konen's intervention and intermittent efforts at
 cooperation, neither major coalition partner was
 willing to compromise.
 54.6 percent of the electorate, compared with
 Opinion polls indicate that both the Social
 Democrats  and  the  Center  Party  would
 strengthen their parliamentary representation in
 a new election. A Gallup poll published last
 month indicated that in an election the Social
 Democrats would garner 27 percent of the votes
 and the Center Party could count on 18.7 per-
 cent. The same poll indicated that the four
 parties represented in the present coalition-the
 Social Democrats, Center Party, Liberals, and
 the Swedish Peoples Party- -are supported by
 ourges said in a communique that the test was
 a complete success both from the technical v,id
 safety points of view.
 Paris' decision to resume underground nu-
 clear testing follows several years of protest
 against French atmospheric tests in the Pacific
 by Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and several
 west coast Latin American countries. Bourges'
 mention of the safety factor probably was in-
 tended to head off another round of protests.
 International  reaction to the detonation has
 been muted. Australian Prime Minister Whitlam
 noted that  France was refraining from con-
 ducting atmospheric tests in the Pacific; how-
 ever, both he and New Zealand Prime Minister
 Rowling reaffirmed their countries' opposition
 to any  type of  nuclear explosions-whether
 atmospheric or underground.
 President Kekkonen has scheduled parlia-
 mentary elections for September 21-22 follow-
 ing the resignation of Prime Minister Sorsa's
 center-left coalition government last week. Kek-
 konen will probably wait until next week to
 dissolve parliament; work should have been com-
 pleted by then on several important bills.
 The President is expected to appoint either
 a non-political government of civil servants or a
 "presidential" caretaker government that would
 remain in office until a new cabinet is formed. A
 "presidential" government would consist of na-
 tionally known political figures serving at the
 request of the president and with the permissioi'.
 of their respective parties. Kekkonen may opt
 for the latter solution because the conclusion of
 the European security conference will probably
 take place in Helsinki this summer or fall, and
 the President wishes 'a have a group of dis-
 tinguishr d national figures representing Finland
 as the host government.
 The French conducted their first nuclear
 test of 1975 on June 5 of the Fagataufa Atoll in
 the South Pacific. The underground explosion
 was France's first since underground testing was
 terminated in 1965  in  Algeria's Sahara desert.
 Thr French conducted a series of underground
 tests there through the mid-1960s.

 USSR: SEEKING AVIATION TECHNOLOGY
 The Soviets want a modern civil air fleet
 with safety, quality, and maintenance up to
 Western standards, and an aircraft of Soviet
 design that would be competitive in the inter-
 national air transport market.
 Recent agreements between the USSR and
 the UK are the latest in a series of attempts to
 acquire the much-needed technology.
 ? A science and technology agreement
 signed in March set the stage for more spe-
 cific ones between Soviet enterprises and
 UK industries.
 ? A protocol signed with Rolls Royce in
 April took the USSR a long step toward
 acquiring the technology to modernize its
 civil air fleet, and in particular toward pro-
 ducing a wide-bodied transport.
 The science and technology agreement is
 similar to those signed earlier with the US. Six
 of the 19 specific fields covered by the agree-
 ment with the UK pertain directly to the air-
 craft industry. Of the six, one calls for contacts
 and cooperation between British industries and
 Soviet enterprises on gas turbine engines, auto-
 matic engine controls, and engine component
 fabrication.
 The Soviets may thus be able to secure
 technical details of a high-performance engine
 comparable to those manufactured by General
 Electric and Pratt and Whitney. The acquisition
 of such technology is, in fact, the chief Soviet
 purpose in negotiating the protocol with Rolls
 Royce. Since March, Soviet delegations have
 met at least twice with teams from Rolls Royce
 to discuss the purchase of an improved engine.
 craft, such as the IL-86. The joint L,velopment
 of improved versions is also envisaged. Such
 engines are essential to efficient,  long-range
 operation of large transport aircraft.
 Co-productic , of engines will result in the
 actual transfer of manufacturing technology, as
 well as operational and maintenance methods
 and processes. With this highly reliable and ef-
 ficient turbofan engine technology the USSR
 would  overcome the principal barrier to its
 development of transport aircraft that would be
 competitive internationally.
 Soviet Deficiencies
 At present, the Soviets have two serious
 deficiencies in  commercial  aviation  tech-
 nology-jet  engines  z,id  internationally                                                                          ac-
 ceptable avionics equipment. Technical main-
 tenance services will also have to be brought up
 to world standards. The TU-1E4s sold to Egypt
 were a case in point; most became inoperative
 because spare parts and maintenance were un-
 available. Cairo eventually returned them.
 The Soviets are from two to eight years
 behind the US in design and production tech-
 nology  for  transport  aircraft  engines.  They
 started to develop turbofan engines later than
 the West did, and then generally concentrated
 on  less  sophisticated, less  efficient models.
 Furthermore, the Soviets have been unwilling to
 introduce  the  required  complex production
 technology and have been unable to match some
 of the more advanced Western technology used
 in producing engines with greater thrust for less
 fuel.
 The protocol with Rolls Royce opens the
 door for contracts to purchase Rolls Royce
 engines already in production, as well as for the
 cooperative manufacture of these high-thrust,
 turbofan engines. Acquisition of such an engine
 would make possible the production of signifi-
 cantly improved versions of wide-bodied air-
 By Western standards, the Soviets also have
 serious deficiencies in avionic subsystems, es-
 pecii,lly in inertial navigation and flight-control.
 They have had difficulty in achieving high ac-
 curacy and  reliability  in components.  Their
 computers are bulky and slow, although they
 have acquired some suitable US computer equip-
 ment throu,.h third countries.

 During the past decade, the USSR has
 maintained a high priority effort to acquire
 Western aircraft technology through both overt
 and covert programs aimed primarily at France,
 West Germany, the UK, and the US. Soviet
 officials have used the atmosphere or detente to
 intensify overt collection efforts.
 Intensive technical discussions have been
 held with officials of each of the three US
 manufacturers of wide-bodied aircraft: Lock-
 heed, McDonnell-Douglas, and Boeing. In addi-
 tion to Rolls Royce, Soviet delegationss have
 visited various engine manufacturers, such as
 General  Electric and Pratt and Whitney. The
 Soviets  have studied Western  business and
 management methods,  including marketing
 analysis.
 Some 30 US companies, including Boeing
 and Lockheed, have signed Article 4 of the
 US-USSR science and technology agreement.
 This article, intended to promote contacts be-
 tween Soviet officials and private L'S firms, has
 greatly increased opportunities for Soviet engi-
 neering and management personnel to hold di-
 rect technical discussions and to observe aero-
 space manufacturing equipment in operation.
 No specific aircraft project is in the final
 stages of negotiation, but whatever evolves will
 be subject to US government approval. Never-
 theless, a considerable amount of US technology
 has already been revealed through preliminary
 negotiations,  proposals, ;,nd exchange visits.
 How well the Soviets have been able to use this
 technology is not yet clear.
 One of the Soviet tactics in negotiations
 with the US was to offer to buy wide-bodied
 aircraft as an inducement for the construction
 of a complete aircraft manufacturing complex in
 the Soviet Union by US firms under contract.
 The US has refused permission for the saie of
 such a complex, and this hzs been a major factor
 in Moscow's decision to move ahead with the
 production of its own adv,nced transpe.t air-
 engines.

 IRAN: AIR POWER AND AIR DEFENSE
 The Shah  is taking steps to make more
 effective  use  of  the  advanced  aircraft and
 sophisticated air defense missiles he is acquiring
 from the US. His air force, already the dominant
 local air power in the Persian Gulf, by the 1980s
 will be able    to extend its influence to the
 Arabian Sea. The Shah's plans also call for most
 of Iran's military installations and key industrial
 facilities to be protected by H;,wk missile sites
 within the next five years.
 Iraq
 GULF OF OMAN
 Northrop F-5E Tiger and F-5F trainer
 The air force is rapidly phasing out its
 older model  US-built F-5  Freedom Fighters.
 Some 20 of the F-5s were sent to Jordan earlier
 this year and another 12 may be sent this fall.
 An additional 20 are to be returned to the US.
 These aircraft are being replaced with improved
 F-5E "Tiger  II" interceptors. The Shah has
 ordered 141 of these new F-5s, plus 28 trainer
 models-some 75 have been delivered.
 The Shah is intent on obtaining the newest
 and best aircraft. In addition to the F-5 Tiger
 Ils, he has some 135 F-4 Phantoms, with an
 additional 70 to be delivered. Iran also has con-
 tracted for at least 80 US F-14s equipped with
 advanced Phoenix air-to-air missiles. The first of
 the F-14s are scheduled for delivery before the
 end of the year. The Shah has expressed an
 interest in acquiring the F-16 lightweight jet
 fighter as well.
 To project his air power into the Arabian
 Sea, the Shah is planning to base F-4s at two
 forward  airfields. Bandar  Abbas will be the
 home base for two squadrons of F-4s, and an-
 other airfield is being built on the coast at Chah
 Bahar, where two fighter squadrons will be sta-
 tioned in the late 1970s.                                                                          From these bases,
 Iranian aircraft could dominate the nearby ship-
 ping lanes and reach as far as Bombay, India.

 The Shah has re-evaluated the priorities for
 loca'Ling the Hawk surface-to-air missiles. Hawks
 will continue to be placed first at key military
 installations, but more emphasis is to be di-
 rected at protecting important industrial and
 petroleum sites. The capital area, nor example,
 still is to receive the largest number of missiles,
 but it will not get them until the Isfahan steel
 works and the Kharg Island petroleum facility
 near Bushehr are protected.
 May was unable to reach an accommodation
 with him.
 Soon after the fighting began, Ali Mirah
 fled to the nearby French Territory of Afars and
 Issas and plans to go to Saudi Arabia and direct
 his Muslim tribesmen from there. He will prob-
 ably seek additional aid from Arab countries
 and al:,o try to promote cooperation between
 his forces and the Eritrean rebels.
 The overall air defense plan for the country
 is steadily falling behind schedule, however.
 Some 25 Hawk launchers have been delivered
 under the purchase agreement with the US, but
 none is yet operational. The first site at the
 Vahdati air base will probably not be ready until
 late this summer-several months behind sched-
 ule. The new plans call for missiles to be err-
 placed in eight locations by 1980, two more
 than  originally  planned. The two additional
 units will be assigned to the industrial center at
 Ahvaz and the     port area at Bandar Abbas.
 Ethiopia's military rulers, already beset by
 rebellion i;i Eritrea and rural unrest in ot'ier
 provinces, found themselves embroiled in still
 another conflict on June 1 when heavy fighting
 broke out between Afar tribesmen and govern-
 ment security forces in eastern Ethiopia. The
 clashes subsided this week, but the Afars will
 probably continue  guerrilla operations in an
 attempt to fend off control by the military
 council in Addis Ababa.
 Suntan Ali Mirah, the Afar leader, opposes
 the council's socialist policies, especially its land
 reform program. He was one of the few major
 tribal figures to remain free during the council's
 roundup of traditional leaders last year, but he
 felt the council would eventually move against
 him as part of its campaign to destroy Ethiopia's
 old ruling class. He refused repeated council
 requests to come to Addis Ababa, and a council
 delegation that traveled to Afar territory in late
 The Afars are a threat to both the main
 highway linking Addis Ababa with the Red Sea
 port of Assab-site of Ethiopia's only oil refin-
 ery-and the railway to the port of Djibouti in
 the French Territory. During the fighting last
 week, the Afars blew up a bridge on the high-
 way, setting off panic buying of gasoline in the
 capital.
 Government forces will probably be able to
 control the main towns in the area, but will not
 be able to completely subdue the Afars. The
 army is already stretched thin. The Afars num- 25X1

 President  Q.idhufi  is  putting  pr cssur c  on,
 Arab and Islamic leaders to denounce Egyptian
 President Sadat's recent statements concerning
 recognition of Israel and the possibility that
 Israeli cargoes will  be permitted to move
 through the Suez Canal. Qadhafi's latest ani:i-
 Sadat offensive may complicate Egypt's efforts
 to put together a joint Arab negotiating pc'.cy.
 According to the Libyan press, Qadhafi nas
 received messages from Syria, Tunisia, Algeria,
 North Yemen, and Bahrain disapproving of
 Sadat's remarks. President Asad is quoted as
 stating, "Syria has not and will not consider
 recognition of the Zionist enemy, which is not
 the right of any chief of state."
 Qadhafi hopes that a general Arab con-
 demnation of E~Iypt's recent moves will isolate
 Sadat  and  undercut Egypt's credibility as
 spokesman for the Arabs during the next round
 of negotiations with Israel. Libya probably also
 wants to harden Arab negotiating positions
 before the Arab summit later this summer
 Qadhafi has met with several fedayeen
 leaders in Tripoli to consider other v,'ays to
 block Sadat. He has talked with George Hab:'ash
 and Ahmad Jabril-two of the most radical ter-
 rorist leaders-arid with Nayif Hawatmah and
 Faruq Qaddumi, members of the n ore moderate
 Palestine  Liberation Organlzctiun. All  four
 Palestinians denounced Sadat's geasiurc ; toward
 Israel, declaring that the Palestinians would not
 accept !sraeli use of the Suez Canal.
 The Libyan media have stepped up their
 denunciation of Sadat; some attacks contain
 scarcely veiled calls for the Egyptian leader's
 assassination. Last weekend, the Libyans staged
 the largest anti-Sadat demonstrations since the
 1973  "people's  march" on Cairo.  Nearly
 ].0,000-including many  Egyptian workers-
 participated in a rally in Tripoli.
 These actions are bound to draw a sharp
 reaction from Cairo. They may once again bring
 Libyan-Egyptian relations, which have been sour
 for mar.v month- to the breaking point. F_

 the minimum wage, Argentine workers have re-
 acted strongly against price hikes announced by
 Economy Minister Celestino Rodrigo who (nly
 last week was named to replace an outspoken
 foe of continuing concessions to them. Sharp
 increases  in utility  rates and  the  prices of
 gasoline,  basic foods, transport, and  services
 have provoked strikes by taxi drivers and mari-
 time                                                                    and        port workers.  Nine persons were
 wounded when police broke up an angry crowd
 of steelworkers protesting rising prices.
 Less       than  a  week  after taking   office,
 Rodrigo also announced the devaluation of the
 peso  to   one  third its February value and
 endorsed previously approved measures to cur-
 tail imports. Argentina has been experiencing
 mounting  inflation-it    now  exceeds         a
 100-percent annual  rate-and  a deteriorating
 balance of payments. In addition, the adminis-
 tration has reiterated the urgent need to increase
 productivity, probably in reference to the seri-
 ous problem of w,, ker absenteeism.
 The government undoubtedly is in for even
 greater problems with labor. More than a week
 after the announced deadline for completion of
 wage negotiations with industrial unions, the
 Peronist labor confederation announced suspen-
 sion rf the talks until such time as the full
 effects of the devaluation and price increases are
 known.
 The halt may really be due to dissension in
 labor's ranks and to diminishing support for the
 workers' own negotiators. Indeed, the heads of
 two top labor groupings are rumored ready to
 resign their posts. In the meantime, both sides
 are clearly seeking to play down their differ-
 ences, in public at least. Labor leaders, perhaps
 in an effort to buy time, have assured workers
 that the eventual agreement will be retroactive
 to June 1, when the old accord expired. In the
 final analysis, however, union leaders may be
 obliged to press the government hard if they are

 Argentina reportedly has transferred spent
 fuel elements containing about 50 kilograms of
 plutonium from the Atucha power reactor to a
 storage facility without notifying the Interna-
 tional Atomic Energy Agency. Buenos Aires is
 obligated to make such notification under the
 terms of the IAEA safeguard provisions covering
 the Atucha reactor. Although an IAEA safe-
 guard inspector's report of the transfer was for-
 warded to the energy agency in March 1975, its
 existence has apparently been concealed by an
 Argentine citizen working at IAEA headquarters
 and  has  not been recorded  in  the  IAEA's
 Department of Safeguards and Inspection.
 The failure to provide notification could be
 an inadvertent omission, but it could be an
 attempt by Buenos Aires to circumvent the safe-
 guards                      system  as a test of its effectiveness.
 Intentional or not, this failure of the reporting
 and  recording procedures  demonstrates  the
 vulnerability of the system to a planned diver-
 sion of plutonium by a country wishing to
 circumvent the system.
 Argentina is undoubtedly concerned about
 the impending West German sale to Brazil of a
 complete nuclear fuel industry. The Argentines
 will not b e facilities for the separation of
 plutonium from irradiated reactor fuel in large
 quantities for at least two years, but should they
 then complete the necessary weapons research
 and development work, they could construct a
 nuclear explosive device which would keep them
 ahea.. of Brazil.
 Even after a change of economy ministers
 the government  is still encountering consider-
 able difficulty in its efforts to deal with the
 country's severe  economic problems without
 alienating organized labor.

 Guatemalan President Laugerud appears to
 be embarked on a plan to cast off the extrer.ie
 right-wing member )f the two-party governing
 coalition and eventually form a new political
 alliance to govern the country. The alliance he
 apparently h;,s in mind would not significantly
 change the coi,servative cast of the government.
 Current maneuvering by Laugerud centers
 on the election of a president of Congress on
 June 15. This post, a much-sought-after political
 plum, had been held for several years by the
 senior partner in the coalition, the rightist
 National Liberation Movement, led by Vice
 President Sandoval. The Movement lost it last
 year to a small party outside, but closely aligned
 with, the coalition and wants it back. Laugerud,
 who has been trying for some tome to ease the
 party and the power-hungry vice president out
 of the political limelight, is supporting a candi-
 date of the Democratic Institutional Party, th^
 other member of the coalition. This party, less
 strident  in its conservatism,  is regarded by
 Laugerud as better suited to his style and polit-
 ical philosophy.
 The two opposition parties, the centrist
 Revolutionary Party and the leftist Christian
 Democratic Party, have thrown their support to
 the  Laugerud candidate,  making him the
 Favorite to win. These parties are only too will-
 ing to support Laugerud on this issue, having
 resented the :ron-handed and arrogant way the
 Sandoval party has run Congress in the past.
 Moreover, they have been going along with the
 President on other issues in hopes of being in-
 cluded in any new coalition excluding the Na-
 tional Liberation Moverr:ent. Laugerud report-
 edly has been thinking of an alliance among the
 Democratic  Institutional  Party,  the Revolu-
 tionary Party, and a smaller party of followers
 of former president Arana.
 Faced with the possibility of being bumped
 from          the coalition, National Liberation

 Movement members are becoming worried. One
 has charged that Sandoval's inability to swing
 the election to their candidate is leading the
 party to ruin. Others claim that a weakening of
 the coalition   .iuld weaken the government
 itself.
 Sandoval is remaining publicly silent for
 now. Although it is his nature to threaten and
 intimidate  in  order to  show  opponents the
 power of his party, he is also shrewd enough to
 know that he would not succeed in any con-
 frontation with  Laugerud. Laugerud                                has the
 backing of the army, which, in the end, is the
 chief political arbiter in the country. After a
 final try at persuading Laugerud to pick another
 candidate. Sandoval is likely to go along with
 the President's choice.
 For the National Liberation Movement and
 Sandoval,  losing the congressional leadership
 will not necessarily lead to an immediate split in
 the partnership, but it does indicate, along with
 previous disputes, that bitterness has grown to a
 COLOMBIA: DECL INING PUBLIC ORDER
 Pressure  on  President  Alfonso  Lopez
 Michelsen to declare a state of siege continues to
 mount.  Public order  is  deteriorating, with
 student protests in several cities now added to
 existing country-wide demonstrations against
 economic hardships. Army units have helped the
 national police maintain order, but the army
 high command has made clear its distaste for
 such use of troops except when legalized by a
 state of siege. Last week, following the letter of
 constitutional law, the council of state auth-
 orized the President to declare a state of siege.
 Although Lopez remains extremely reluctant to
 abridge civil liberties with such a declaration, it
 seems only a matter of time until he is obliged
 to do so.
 Student unrest has been focused on the
 rectorship of the National university and a con-
 troversy over medical students' management of
 their own clinical training. In an attempt to
 forestall existing and anticipated student prob-
 lems, President Lopez appointed a Marxist to
 the rectorship following his inauguration ten
 months ago. In the midst of this month's out-
 break of student demonstrations, Lopez fired
 the Marxist rector for failing to provide a useful
 channel of communication between the student
 body and the government. This has only further
 aggravated the students, who have intensified
 their support of residents and interns seeking to
 control one of Bogota's largest hospitals and
 have carried the violence-charged issue to other
 universities and other major cities.
 I he key argument in favor of a state of
 siege r lay well be the politically explosive issue
 'if urban transpor.::tion fares. Colombia began
 to ;:"Port oil last year, erasing a tradition of  Fx'
 abundant domestic oil with subsidized low 25X1
 prices at the gasoline pump. Lopez' efforts to
 maintain the price level have led to an increasing
 drain of treasury funds into fuel subsidies. In
 late May, Lopez moved to suspend or minimize
 gasoline imports and ration local consumption.
 This will postpone but not eliminate an eventual
 price rise and a resultant increase in transporta-
 tion fares. In the past, even minor fare hikes
 have provoked violent protests by lower income
 riders. Lopez would probably be forced to use
 the army to control such demonstrations, and
 he would almost surely declare a state of siege
 first.
 Lopez may  he tempted to act now in
 response to the student unrest and then permit
 gasoline prices and transport fares to rise with
 the army already in control of public order.
 With a mid-term election coming next April, the
 President may prefer to confront sooner rather
 than later what could be the most serious polit-

 The government has undertaken a sweeping
 crackdown on opponents in the wake of its
 claim that three Dominican terrorists secretly
 entered  the country from Cuba on June 1.
 During the  past week, security  forces have
 carried out searches, set up roadblocks, and ar-
 rested  several  hundred people in what they
 claim is an effort to apprehend three Dominican
 extremists who have been living in Cuba. The
 authorities maintain that the trio was brought to
 the Dominican Republic by three Puerto Ricans
 who were arrested on suspicion of narcotics
 smuggling on June 2. Military and police forces
 were dispatched to the area where the landing is
 alleged to have taken place, but apparently did
 not find their quarry.
 General Nivar, the chief of the National
 Police, has linked the widespread arrests to the
 guerrilla  landing  and  to  "subversive  plots."
 Opposition party leaders, students, labor union
 officials, and journalists seem to have been the
 main target of the roundup. Many of the de-
 tainees have been released after interrogation,
 but others remain in custody. Fifteen, including
 three important Communist labor leaders, have
 been formally charged with conspiring to over-
 throw the government.
 Considerable skepticism has been reflected
 in the press and in public and private statements
 by many opposition politicians and some mili-
 tary officers concerning the alleged arrival of the
 three terrorists. There is a suspicion that the
 incident was fabricated by General Nivar to
 bolster his reputation with President Balaguer
 and to steal a march on Nivar's arch-riva! Gen-
 eral Perez y Perez, the secretary of the interior
 and police.
 Now that the authorities have publicly
 claimed that the three terrorists have returned.
 they will be under increasing pressure to appre-
 hend them, otherwise protests against the deten-
 tions are almost certain to increase. It will be
 very difficult for the government to continue to
 maintain that the arrested people actually pre-
 sent any security threat. General Nivar has been
 making nearly all the ?.,ublic pronouncements on
 the episode, and will probably have to bear the
 main responsibility if the government cannot

 President Velasco made one of his i -.fre-
 quent public appearances this past week pre-
 siding  over  the  traditional  pledge-to-the-flag
 ceremonies in Lima on June 7. The economic
 and political spotlight, however, is increasingly
 on his probable successor, Prime Minister Mo-
 rales Bermudez.
 Last week, Morales Bermudez announced
 plans for new errn-nic measures to combat
 spiraling inflation       grcw;ng budgetary defi-
 cit. The plans c                                                                                   -er'. ction-and in some
 cases abandonment-of  a,sive government sub-
 sidies on essential agricultural and petroleum
 products. The measures amount to a significant
 departure from President Velasco's almost sacro-
 sanct policy of keeping the potentially volatile
 urban dwellers quiescent through massive sub-
 sidies. To offset the anticipated reaction, Mo-
 rales  Bermudez is urging the government to
 adopt a general price freeze and an increase in
 minimum daily wage and salary levels.
 For some time, international lending agen-
 cies and technical-level officials within the Peru-
 vian  government  have  been  recommending
 tough new measures to ward off what they see
 as a serious economic problem. The present
 system of direct and indirect subsidies ac-
 coured  for  approximately  half  of  the
 1973-1974 biennial budget deficit. Further ag-
 gravating the economic situation is the apparent
 inability to deal with excessive wage demands.
 Inflation, earlier estimated at 25 percent or
 more this year, now appears to be heading even
 higher.

 The economic plight of the government has
 also sparked rumors of devaluation. Although
 these rumors are being given some credence in
 local business circles, there  is  no evidence that
 the government is planning any such politically
 unpalatable move in the immediate future. Fur-
 ther, President Velasco has in the past been very
 firm in stating that his government will not
 preside over  devaluation.     Morales Bermudez'
 views are not known, although he is generally
 regarded as more flexible on financial policy
 than Velasco. While it is true that he is gradually
 assuming a greater role in the decision-making
 process, particularly in economic affairs, he is
 probably not ready to take such a major step.
 In fact, morales Bermudez will have his
 hands full in trying to avoid being the political
 victim of his controversial subsidy policy with-
 out becoming the focus of opposition on an
 even more controversial issue. As the subsidies
 are gradually  reduced in the months ahead,
 prices will inevitably rise and labor dissatisfac-
 tion, already high, will increase. There are indi-
 cations that the strong communist trade union
 confederation is feeling increasing internal pres-
 sure to refuse or withdraw its support of the
 government. Implementation of the new eco-
 nomic measures will do little to assuage such
 pressures. Perhaps symbolic of this new strained
 relationship was the relatively minor role that
 the confederation played in the Flag Day cere-
 monies, and the absence of its representatives in
 a "march" of enthusiastic civilians who followed
 Velasco back to the presidential palace.
 Public reaction to the economic measures
 so far has been slight, but it may pick up in late
 July when the government is expected to raise
 the price of petroleum products, a move that
 will almost immediately be felt in the vital trans-
 portation sector.
 For Morales Bermudez, much is at stake.
 Successful implementation of the new policy
 and an improvement in the economic situation
 would further strengthen his position within the
 government and solidify his hold on the succes-
 sion. On the other hand, a major slip now would
 probably leave the field to other ambitious and
 less  moderate  aenerals-

 Cholera is endemic to the country, and
 conditions in refugee-packed Phnom Penh were
 ideal for an outbreak this year. The deteri-
 orating military situation in March and April
 prevented any meaningful monitoring of the
 health situation, but it now appears that Phnom
 Penh had a serious cholera problem by the time
 the communists took over on April 17. A West-
 ern journalist who was among those deported
 from the country last month reported that at
 least 80 cases of cholera were under treatment
 when  the  insurgents  occupied  the  capital's
 hospitals.                             25X1

 Phnom Penh's two million inhabitants were

 though the exact toll that cholera took during
 the march itself will probably never be known,
 there is little doubt but that it was considerable.
 Individuals who were evacuated and who sub-
 sequently  escaped  the  country  report  that
 doctors confirmed a number of cholera deaths
 during the initial days of the evacuation. Less

 last year, during which troops killed more than
 20 demonstrators.
 Last weekend the protests took on a more
 virulent antigovernment tone as several thou-
 sand students marched through the streets of
 Rangoon. A considerable number of workers in
 the  Rangoon  area joined  in, and what had
 originally been work slowdowns became strikes,
 resulting  in  the closure of several factories.
 Students in Mandalay also staged a demonstra-

 demands of the workers would be met and send-

 AUSTRALIA: CABINET CHANGES
 The most prominent casualty of the cabi-
 net shuffle announced last week by Prime Minis-
 ter Whitlam was Deputy Prime Minister Cairns.
 Cairns was removed as federal treasurer and
 assigned to the considerably less prestigious post
 of minister of env;ronment. William Hayden, a
 young comer who ha.; been social security min-
 ister, repiaces Cairns as treasurer.
 Cairns' transfer, after less than six months
 as treasurer, reflects adversely on his ability to
 ease Australia's economic difficulties. His repu-
 tation has also been tainted by the influence
 e;,erted by his private secretary-and mistress.
 Cairns hds charged that he was the victim of
 misrepresentations made about his dealings with
 a Melbourne financier, but in fact his demotion
 is symptomatic of a more basic fall from politi-
 cal grace. Once considered Whitlam's heir appar-
 ent, Cairns is now almost certainly out of the
 running.
 CONSOLIDATING CONTROLS
 The Pathet Lao .are moving quickly to con-
 solidate political and military control. They still
 pay lip service to the coalition concept, but it is
 clear the coalition is now nothing more than a
 convenient facade for a complete communist
 take-over of Laos.
 Cairns with secretary
 William Morrison, a left-winger and some-
 time critic of the US, has moved from the
 science ministry to the defense ministry post
 vacated by the moderate Lance Barnard, who
 resigned to take an ambassadorship. With the
 downgrading of Cairns, Whitlam probably used
 the appointment of Morrison to maintain +h^
 relative strength between leftists and moderates
 in the cabinet.
 Whitlam r,obably hopes the changes will
 give the Labr,.r government an image of vigo-
 that will help offset its weak position in parlia-
 ment. The Liberal-Country opposition no do':bt
 sees the cabinet shakeup as a further sign of
 Labor weakness and feels that its own electoral
 chances have been enhanced. It will probably
 not push for an early contest, however. It real-

 The Pathet Lao are also continuing efforts
 to neutralize the non-communist Royal  Lao
 Army as an effective fighting force. Having al-
 ready succeeded in driving most of the army's
 competent commanders into exile, the commu-

 Pat et  Lao  "IectWers" at the seminar were
 "acting" Defense Minister Khamouane Boupha,
 Deputy Prime Minister Phoumi Vongvichit, and
 chief agitprop sp,acialist Sanan Soutichak. The
 tone of their presentations was strongly anti-US
 and strongly pro - North Vietnamese.

 neutralists.                                  25X1
 There are tenuous indications that a Lao
 Communist Party Central Committee meeting
 may be under way in Sam Neua. Phoumi Vong-
 vichit and Sanan Soutichak traveled from Vien-
 tiane to Sam Neua tor unexplained reasons last
 weekend. Moreover, Prince Souphanouvong-the
 nominal leader of the Lao communists-has in-
 explicably delayed his scheduled return from
 Sam Neua to Luang Prabang for the opening 25X1
 session of the coalition's Joint National Political
 Council, which the Prince chairs. Souphanou-
 vong has been at communist headquarters for
 the past two months.                            25X1
 If such a conclave has been called, the
 Pathet Lao leadership will almost certainly want
 to assess-among other things-the major suc-
 cesses achieved over the past six weeks and to
 determine the pace at which a complete take-
 over of Laos should proceed.

 CHINA-PHILIPP!PaES, DIPLOMATIC TIES
 Peking's campaign: for improved official
 relajions with non-communist Southeast Asian
 countries took an important step forward this
 week with the announcement that China and
 the Philippines had established diplomatic rela-
 tions on June 9. A trade agreement was signed
 on the same day, but no details were provided.
 President Marcos sees relations with Peking as a
 vital part of his more general effort to create an
 independent foreign policy and end his nation's
 inter nz-tional image as a US client state.
 Peking now has official ties with two mem-
 ber countries of the Association of Southeast
 Asian Nations. Relations with Malaysia were
 opened last year and, according to recent re-
 ports, Thailand is prepared to follow suit with
 an announcement that could come as early as
 next month. That would leave Singapore and
 Indonesia as the only remaining ASEAN coun-
 tries having no active diplomatic relations with
 Peking.
 The Chinese used the occasion of Marcos'
 visit to Peking to warn against attempts by the
 USSR to expand its influence in Asia and to
 express Peking's sensitivity about charges of Chi-
 nese interference in the internal affairs of other
 countries.
 Chinese fears that the Soviets are attempt-
 ing to take advantage of recent communist vic-
 tories in Indochina to improve their position in
 the area were evident in the joint communique
 announcing the establishment of relations, as
 well as in Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping's speech
 at the banquet welcoming Marcos. The commu-
 nique included a provision condemning any
 country that attemots to "establish hegemony
 or spheres of influence in any part of the
 world," a now standard ingredient in Peking's
 anti-Soviet fare.
 In addition, Teng complimented Manila, for
 its opposition to "hegemonism" it recent years
 and pointed out that Southeast Asian countries
 had broad international support for the plan to
 create a zone of peace and neutrality in South-
 east Asia, a scheme that Peking apparently be-
 lieves will help foresta" any increase in Soviet
 influence in the region. Teng confidently de-
 clared that Asian countries would quickly see
 through any Sov' t "wiles and schemes" in the
 region.
 On the subject of interference   internal
 affairs, the communique stated that both coun-
 tries condemn foreign aggression and subversion,
 as well as all attempts by any country to contro,
 another country or to interfere in its internal
 affairs. In addition, Teng said in his speech that
 China would never "bully" another country and
 acknowledged that a country's social system can
 be decided "only by its own people." This
 formulation goes slightly further than that used
 at the time of Malaysian recognition and appears
 to be another indication that China expects to
 play down support for Asian insurgencies in the
 aftermath of Indochina.
 On the Taiwan issue, the Philippines stated
 in the communique that it "fully understands
 and respects" Peking's claim to the island-a
 standard formulation. The communique also in-
 cluded notice of Manila's decision to withdraw
 all official representatives from Taiwan within
 one month. There is a good chance, however,
 that the Philippines will maintain a significant

 number of commercial and other non-official
 contacts with the Nationalists on Taiwan.
 In the communique, both sides agreed that
 citizens of one country who acquire citizenship
 in the other automatically forfeit their original
 citizenship, a formula for dealing with the sensi-
 tive question of overseas Chine, e residents in the
 Philippines. The provision does not take into
 account Peking's responsibilities toward those
 ethnic Chinese who retain Chinese citizenship,
 although Peking has for several years consis-
 tently urged overseas Chinese to adopt the Liti-
 zenship of the country in which than reside.
 CHINA: TRADE RETRENCHMENT
 Worldwide inflation and recession defused
 China's foreign trade boom in 1974 and is lead-
 ing to a retrenchment in 1975.
 Soaring prices boosted China's import bill
 in 1974 to $7.4 billion, while the economic
 slowdown in the West dampened th? demand
 for Chinese goods. Total exports rose to only
 $6.3 billion, resulting in a record $1.1-billion
 trade deficit. China's current account balance
 with non-communist countries plunged $1.3 bil-
 lion into the red, and, despite a greater use of
 supplier credits and short-term borrowing, Pe-
 king had to draw down its reserves by $300
 million to finance the gap.
 Sales at the Canton Trade Fairs, a major
 indicator of Chirese exports, point to lagging
 exports this year. Althcugh the Chinese tried to
 boost sales by cutting prices at the fall 1974 and
 spring 1975 fairs, commercially both were
 dismal events. Attendance at the spring fair may
 have fallen to  15,000, compared with the
 25,000 figure Peking reported last fall, and the
 volume of business was probably less than the
 $700-million fall fair level-the lowest in years.
 tural products will fall from the record $1.9
 billion in 1974 to about $1.3 billion this year.
 China will purchase only 4.4 million tons of
 grain-down from 7 million tons last year-at a
 cost of $675 million. Cotton purchases also are
 down  sharply; soybean  imports  have  been
 phased out.
 Machinery and equipment imports, which
 more than doubled in 1974 to $1.7 billion, will
 grow more slowly this year. Much equipment is
 in the pipeline under contracts signed in the past
 few years, but Peking has restricted new pur-
 chases to badly needed replacements and high-25X1
 priority  machinery  such  as  oil drilling and
 mining    equipment.  New  orders  for  whol.
 plants-$1.2 billion in 1973 and $900 million in
 1974-will probably decline sharply this year. In
 the  irst four months, Peking only concluded
 contracts for bearings plants worth $20 mil-
 lion-a radical scale-down of the $100-million
 facility originally sought.
 Barring a rapid turnaround in the world
 economy, Chinese exports this year will prob-
 ably grow little over last year's level. Partia
 trade returns for 1975 indicate that exports are
 up about 10 percent over the same period last
 year. If the trend continues, they would total
 about $6.9 billion this year. With imports likely
 to be about the same as in 1974, the trade
 deficit would be reduced to about $500 million,
 resulting in an improvement in China's hard-
 currency balance of payments.
 Despite the deficit in 1974, China's balance
 of payments is not in crisis. Although repay-
 ments of short-term credits and progress pay-
 ments for whole plants will total more than $1
 billion this year, reserves are adequate and Pe-
 king's credit rating is excellent. Credits for grain,
 whole plant equipment, and Japanese steel and
 fertilizer will finance much of the reduced trade
 deficit in 1975. With continued large remit-
 tances from overseas Chinese and some bank
 borrowing, however, China will probably be able
 In an attempt to redress its trade deficit,
 Peking will trim its imports during the year.
 Based on existing contracts, imports of agricul-
 Lo avoid drawing down its reserves of gold and
