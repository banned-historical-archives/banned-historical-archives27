 (Information as of noon EST, 29 December 1965)
 VIETNAM
 A brief Christmas lull interrupted the continuing high
 level of military activity.  A further cease-fire was a
 possibility for the lunar new year.  The South Vietnamese
 Government began to implement a hard-line policy towards
 FULRO, responsible for the recent montagnard uprising.
 The Directorate still plans to launch a civilian advisory
 council next month.  Hanoi's propaganda reaction to the
 cessation of bombing in the North has been an attempt to
 discredit the move.  A top Soviet leader, party secretary
 Shelepin, is scheduled to visit Hanoi to reassert the
 USSR's presence.   Hungary has granted some economic aid
 to the DRV.  The presence in North Vietnam of high-per-
 formance MIG-21s was confirmed.,  Nine new SAM sites were
 discovered.
 PEKING BEGINNING BIRTH CONTROL PROGRAM IN RURAL AREAS
 Communist China is apparently preparing to extend its
 birth control program from the cities to the rural
 areas, where the bulk of the population lives, but
 there is little chance that the effect on population
 growth will be significant in the near future.
 EASTERN EUROPEAN DEFECTIONS OF GROWING CONCERN
 The relatively high rate of escapes, especially of
 professionally trained men, has caused both Czechoslo-
 vakia  and Hungary to reimpose some restrictions on
 their only recently liberalized travel regulations.
 FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE IN THE USSR
 The spread of foot-and-mouth disease may have been
 checked, but the outbreak is still widespread and ef-
 fects of the disease will reduce the output of Soviet
 livestock products next year.

 This radical West African state is subject to acute
 internal tensions that could threaten the stability of
 President Tourers regime.  After seven years of inde-

 country's single political party is wearing thin and
 Tours has felt obliged to make sweeping internal changes
 to preserve his dominance.  Guinea has steadily in-
 creased its ties with the US following the abrupt halt-
 ing of large-scale Communist aid in late 1961.   However,
 current domestic political pressures could produce
 ancther shift in orientation as sudden as that of four
 years ago.   (Published separately as Special Report

 The Viet Cong generally ob-
 served its own conditional ces-
 sation of hostilities on Christ-
 mas eve, although guerrilla ac-
 tivity resulted in allied casual-
 ties in two instances.   Enemy ac-
 tivity picked up on Christmas
 day well before the end of the
 30-hour allied cease-fire, how-
 ever, and allied forces resumed
 combat operations early on 26 De-
 cember.
 Military activity before and
 after the lull continued at the
 comparatively high level sustained
 during recent weeks.   Communist
 attacks in battalion strength oc-
 curred in Quang Tri, Quang Nam,
 and Quang Ngai provinces before
 the holiday, and in An Xuyen and
 Quang Duc provinces on 26 and 28
 December.   The most successful
 government operation of the week
 was in Chuong Thien Province.
 US military officials in
 Saigon report that 1,000 PAVN
 troops may have crossed the Lao-
 tian border into Quang Tri Prov-
 ince on 25 December.   In addition
 to an enemy battalion-size attack
 on 23 December, two bridges on
 Route 9 were recently destroyed,
 and large-scale enemy activity
 may be imminent.
 On 28 December,  the Front's
 central committee announced that
 Viet Cong forces would observe a
 cease-fire toward South Vietnamese
 troops during the lunar new year
 period from 20-23 January.   Both
 government and Viet Cong forces
 sharply decreased their activi-
 ties during this period last year.
 South Vietnam
 Political         ion
 II Corps commander General
 Vinh Loc last week issued two
 communiquds that clearly indi-
 cate a hardened government at-
 titude toward FULRO, the dissi-
 dent tribal organization respon-
 sible for the recent montagnard
 uprising in four central high-
 lands provinces.   One communique
 states that any person caught
 assisting a FULRO member will be
 shot; the other allows FULRO
 members 20 days to surrender or
 face severe punishment.
 Military trials have been
 held in Pleiku for 39 members
 of a regional force company that
 participated in the rebellion.
 Four were sentenced to death,
 two of whom have already been
 shot, 30 have received prison
 sentences, and five have been
 acquitted.   Some 300 FULRO sym-
 pathizers are now in government
 ]hands, and additional courts-
 martial have been scheduled for
 at least some of them.  Defense
 Minister Co in Saigon is report-
 edly urging moderation, and cau-
 tioning against mass executions.
 Major General Chieu, secre-
 tary general of the ruling mili-
 tary Directorate, told US Embassy
 officials last week that the Di-
 rectorate still plans to launch
 a 60-man civilian advisory coun-
 cil, probably some time next
 month.  He said a majority of
 the Directorate favored giving
 the council some concrete re-
 sponsibilities in addition to its

 advisory role.   However, Chieu
 was unable to indicate who the
 council members might be, leav-
 ing the impression that candi-
 dates may be hard to find.        He
 also said his own efforts to es-
 tablish a national front group-
 ing of politicians who would sup-
 port the military government had
 been unsuccessful, and that this
 project would be at least tem-
 porarily postponed.
 Rumors continue that Na-
 tional Police Director Lieu and
 I Corps commander General Thi
 are attempting to undermine Pre-
 mier Ky and Chief of State Thieu.
 Although Thi and Lieu--long-time
 close associates--are politically
 ambitious and frequently critical
 of Ky,  there has been no firm
 evidence that they are actively
 preparing a coup.
 Hanoi propaganda has al-
 ready attempted to discredit the
 current US cessation of the air
 attacks against North Vietnam by
 claiming that hostile US air ac-
 tivity over the DRV is continu-
 ing.   The DRV has protested to
 the ICC that "many formations of
 US jet fighters repeatedly over-
 flew the DRV and carried out re-
 connaissance and provocative ac-
 tivities on 25, 26, and 27 De-
 cember."  This is the same line
 Hanoi took toward the five-day
 cessation of the bombings last
 May.   Neither Peking nor the
 Liberation Front has yet commented
 on the current standdown.
 Soviet Leader to Visit Hanoi
 Moscow's decision to send a
 top leader--party secretary
 Shelepin--to Hanoi indicates a
 clear intention to exert a strong
 influence upon the North Vietnam-
 ese.   His trip is the first high-
 level Soviet visit since the
 Kosygin mission last February,
 and the Soviets probably feel
 that the current bombing pause
 provides a good opportunity to
 encourage Hanoi to seek political
 alternatives to the war.
 Announcement of the visit
 coincides with increased Russian
 material and political support
 foil, the DRV and with renewed ex-
 pressions of Hanoi's gratitude
 for Moscow's "great assistance."
 The visit represents a direct
 challenge to China's influence,
 however,  and Hanoi appears to have
 made an effort to placate Chinese
 concern.   The party daily on 28
 December published a lengthy ar-
 ticle praising the "broad and
 tremendous support" Peking has
 provided.  Also cited were num-
 erous examples of Chinese pledges
 of support, including statements
 by Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai.
 An undertone in the article,
 however, suggested Hanoi feels
 Chinese aid has been more talk
 than action.   Although Peking has
 insisted that it will "stand
 shoulder to shoulder" with its
 Vietnamese comrades, Hanoi may

 tional material assistance and

 Hungarian Economic Aid
 Hungary has granted North
 Vietnam a new long-term, interest-
 free loan as well as a moratorium
 on repayment of past loans, ac-
 cording to a joint communique
 signed by DRV Deputy Premier Le
 Thank Nghi and Hungarian Deputy
 Premier Fock on 28 December.   A
 separate agreement on "economic
 aid of a different nature" was
 also listed.   The vague revela-
 tions? on this agreement may indi-
 cate that while Budapest is will-
 ing to give Hanoi's war effort
 minimum support,  it does not wish
 to publicly commit itself to any
 specific military assistance. The
 public announcements suggest that
 the assistance offered is more
 generous than Le Thanh Nghi was
 able to arrange when he was in
 Budapest early last summer.
 The DRV delegation left for
 Germany on the 28th, suggesting
 visits to several East European
 capitals.   Hanoi's initial an-
 nouncement indicated the trip
 would include only Moscow, Pe-
 king, and Pyongyang.
 High-Performance Aircraft in DRV
 The presence of new-genera-
 tion, high-performance fighter
 aircraft in the DRV was confirmed
 last week by high-altitude drone
 photography.   Seven MIG-21 Fish-
 beds were seen at Phuc Yen Air-
 field.   Four other canvas-covered
 planes may also be MIG-21s.   In
 addition, a total of 63 MIG-15/17
 fighters were seen at Phuc Yen
 and Kep airfields, very close to
 the accepted air order of battle.
 New SAM Sites
 Nine new surface-to-air mis-
 sile (SAM) sites--numbers 53
 through 61--were disclosed by
 photography                       One   25X1
 of the sites is still under con-
 struction and missiles and mis-
 sile-associated equipment were
 noted at one other site.

 several years from the cities to
 the rural areas, where over 80
 percent of the estimated 763 mil-
 lion population lives.   There is
 little chance that the effect on
 the population's rate of growth
 in the near future will be
 significant.   The practical dif-
 ficulties of training personnel
 to administer a nationwide pro-
 gram and of providing enough con-
 traceptives are severe.   Moreover,
 the regime seems still to be in-
 hibited by ideological concerns
 and by anxiety over the possibil-
 itv of arousing the resistance of
 the  conservative peasantry.
 China's population problem
 is growing more acute.   Food pro-
 duction has been outstripped by
 the growth of the population,
 which during the past six years
 has risen by an estimated 80-90
 million.   Rations are still near
 the edge of subsistance despite
 grain imports of 5-6 million tons
 annually since 1961.   Private
 plots--allowed to revive during
 the post - Leap Forward food dis-
 aster years--have become a vital
 and apparently permanent supple-
 mentary source of food.   In-
 dividual food intake remains be-
 low the level of 1957,  the year
 before the Great Leap, and there
 is little chance that it will be
 restored to that level, since ac-
 complishing this would require
 doubling grain output over the
 next 20 years.   Food reserves,
 with the possible exception of
 small stores for military con-
 tingencies, are believed to be
 nonexistent.
 The information available so
 far indicates that the spread of
 birth control practices in the
 countryside will be slow, and in
 part contingent upon more-or-less
 chance factors such as the pres-
 ence of rural hospitals or par-
 ticularly zealous cadres.   No
 preference has become discerni-
 ble for any one device or method,
 although the intra-uterine loop
 has obvious advantages for China
 in cost, ease of manufacture,
 and administration.
 Sufficient trained tech-
 nicians are presently lacking
 to administer even the simplest
 methods in a nationwide program.
 However, starting in the second
 half of 1965, large numbers of
 urban medical personnel h ve been
 reassigned to rural work.
 As a  further harbinger of
 developments to come, the recent
 nationalconference of gynecolo-
 gists and obstetricians--Commu-
 nist China's first--announced
 that large numbers of rural part-
 time health workers will be
 trained and that among their newly
 adopted textbooks will be one en-
 titled "Modern Methods of Child-
 birth and Birth Control."

 EASTERN EUROPEAN DEFECTIONS OF
 Czechoslovakia and Hungary
 have become increasingly concerned
 with the rising number c.' defec-
 tions--a consequence of the liber-
 alization of travel restrictions--
 of professionals such as physicians,
 scientists,  and engineers.   The
 problem also has had repercussions
 in the recipient countries of
 France, Austria, and--possibly--
 West Germany,  and transit countries
 such as Yugoslavia.
 Critical comments have ap-
 peared in Czechoslovakia and Hun-
 gary recently, culminating in Hun-
 gary in a speech to parliament by
 Premier Kallai.   Kallai admitted
 that .005 percent of the Hungarians
 traveling to the West this year had
 chosen not to return.   The figure
 in the Czech party press was  0092
 percent for Czechs choosing the
 West.   The percentages may appear
 low, but the loss of 3,000 Hungar-
 ians and at least a similar number
 of Czechs for a nine-month period
 must be disturbing,  particularly
 since these figures include a large
 proportion of professionals and
 represent only the totals publicly
 admitted by the regimes without
 reference to secret escapes across
 the border.
 The regime's solutions have
 been to revert to a limited reim-
 position of restrictions.   The
 Czechs have revived the "hostage"
 system whereby at least one member
 of the family must remain home,
 while Hungary reportedly has been
 placing stricter limitations on
 travel by professional men.
 Recipient countries have been
 unhappy about the situation also.
 Austria and France, for example,
 are interested in improving rela-
 tions with the East, but find them-
 selves faced with accommodating
 ever greater numbers of refugees
 from these countries.   Austria has
 upon occasion returned would-be de-
 fectors, who have then been sen-
 tenced to at least three years im-
 prisonment.   France, once the eas-
 iest European country in which to
 find refuge, reportedly has been
 refusing to grant asylum or work
 permits.  Recently the Bavarian
 Government returned a would-be Hun-
 garian defector, but this may have
 been an isolated incident rather
 than a reflection of a change in
 West German refugee policy.
 Now that travel to Yugoslavia
 has been made easier,  that country
 is being used as a jumping-off point
 for the West.   Belgrade has promised
 -to cooperate with its Eastern Euro-
 pean neighbors, however, and in many
 cases has thwarted defection at-
 tempts.   The Yugoslav borders with
 the West nevertheless remain a much-
 used roadway for illegal travel to
 the West.
 Defections are not a serious
 problem to the Polish regime, prob-
 ably because the population feels
 relatively secure in the knowledge
 that the right to travel has become
 more or less established since 1956.
 Rumania and Bulgaria are not faced
 with the problem because they do not
 permit travel to the West except by

 MOSCOW'S POSITION IN THE UPCOMING INDIAN-PAKISTANI TALKS
 Moscow is probably approaching
 tue 4 January meeting at Tashkent
 between Indian and Pakistan
 leaders with the expectation
 that about the best that can be
 achieved is an easing of the
 hostility between the two coun-
 tries and perhaps an agreement to
 hold further discussions.   So-
 viet leaders could consider it
 a net gain simply to have brought
 Ayub Khan and Shastri together
 under the aegis of their "good
 offices."   They view the forth-
 coming meeting both as a step
 forward in their efforts to win
 a firm diplomatic foothold in
 Pakistan,   and as a move to de-
 prive the Chinese of an oppor -
 tunity to exploit discord in
 South Asia
 Over the past year, Moscow
 has worked at improving its re-
 lations with Pakistan and re-
 cently has adopted a more non-
 committal attitude on the ques-
 tion of Kashmir in order to win
 greater influence in Rawalpindi.
 However, the USSR doubtless feels
 that it can retain the confidence
 of the Indians on the strength
 of its past record of support
 for New Delhi's claims.   The
 Soviets appear so far to have
 satisfied the Indians that
 Moscow's recent tactics have
 been designed to frustrate the
 Chinese and to exert a moder-
 ating influence in Rawalpindi.

 CAMBODIA SEEKING TO AVOID INVOLVEMENT IN VIETNAM WAR
 Prince Sihanouk evidently
 is groping for a diplomatic ri-
 poste to meet what he presumably
 views as a grave threat to Cam-
 bodia contained in recent public
 statements concerning possible
 US military ground operations on
 Cambodian territory.   So far,
 the Cambodian Government's reac-
 tion has been confined to ap-
 peals to the international com-
 munity and standard denunciations
 of US policy in Indochina.
 Several official communi-
 ques issued over the past week
 suggest that at least for the
 present Sihanouk's principal
 tactic will be to portray Cam-
 bodia as the innocent victim of
 the escalating war in South Viet-
 nam.   He has called on the Geneva
 co-chairmen to take a "clear
 position" on the US decision to
 authorize the violation of Cam-
 bodia's borders.   He also has
 hinted that Cambodia may appeal
 to the United Nations in an at-
 tempt to win international sym-
 pathy.
 Sihanouk is attempting to
 put the onus on the US for the
 tense situation along the bor-
 der.                                                                He has forcefully reiter-
 ated denials that the Viet Cong
 use Cambodia for sanctuary or
 as a source of arms and ammuni-
 tion.                                                                At the same time, he has
 renewed calls for an expanded
 International Control Commission
 (ICC) to inspect and "control"
 the border area.   An ICC inspec-
 tion team is currently in Siha-
 noukville at Sihanouk's invitation,

 disposal."
 Thus far, Sihanouk has been
 circumspect concerning the pos-

 South Vietnamese "attack."  A
 government communique issued on
 26 December referred to a "pos-

 for assistance and support.   Two

 The Harad peace conference
 between Yemeni royalists and re-
 publicans has been recessed, pos-
 sibly until late February,  and
 bothsides are prepared for out-
 breaks of trouble during the in-
 terim.
 A month-old conference,  born
 out of the agreement last August
 between King Faysal and President
 Nasir, has been called off at
 least until the end of the holy
 month of Ramadan, and it is un-
 clear when the talks will resume.
 The Ramadan fast has provided a
 logical excuse to break off the
 deadlocked attempt to form a
 caretaker all-Yemen government.
 Shortly before the recess, the
 republican side had finally ac-
 cepted the royalist view that the
 caretaker government be neither
 royalist nor republican in form.
 This first agreement of any sub-
 stance added a note of optimism
 that the meeting would,  in fact,
 be reconvened.
 Both Nasir and Faysal will
 actively encourage renewal of
 talks.   Despite their individual
 efforts to obtain the most favor-
 able terms possible, there is lit-
 tle doubt of their desire for
 peace in Yemen.   Ever since their
 August agreement on steps to end
 the three-year-old civil war,  they
 have done their best to discourage
 clashes between the naturally
 fractious tribes and surprisingly
 few incidents have occurred. The
 two leaders have been less suc-
 cessful in damping inflammatory
 propaganda and rash partisan
 statements.
 The Saudis have apparently
 lived up to their agreement to
 suspend arms support to the roy-
 alists,  and are now attempting
 to persuade the Egyptians to be-
 gin troop withdrawals without
 waiting for the formation of an
 interim government.   The start of
 Egyptian troop movements would
 almost certainly stimulate a new
 interest on both sides in renew-
 ing the Harad conference.
 The republicans appear re-
 signed to eventual Egyptian with-
 drawal.   They have attempted to
 set up several defense organiza-
 tions to protect themselves from
 the expected postwithdrawal rav-
 aging by fierce royalist tribes.
 The royalists, despite alarmist
 press reports that they were
 ready to attack, have been bel-
 ligerent only in isolated cases.
 Nevertheless, both sides still
 regard each other with suspicion
 and are making contingency plans
 in case the talks fail.   Nasir
 has announced he will strike back
 against any royalist attack, and
 the Saudis continue to stockpile
 weapons along the Yemen border.

 ZAMBIA MAINTAINS PRESSURE FOR EMERGENCY SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS
 Zambia's President Kaunda.
 is maintaining high pressure on
 Britain and others to accelerate
 the flow of emergency oil ship-
 ments into his country and to
 prepare Zambia. to invoke a com-
 plete economic embargo against
 Rhodesia..
 Numerous operational dif-
 ficulties, such as a shortage
 of oil drums,  threaten to de-
 plete Zambia's low petroleum
 reserves.   The joint UK-US con-
 tingency planning committee in
 Lusaka, however, remains op-
 timistic that over 11,000 tons
 of oil can be sent to Zambia in
 January and that deliveries will
 eventually approach the UK goal
 of 17,000 tons per month.   This
 would be close to Zambia's nor-
 mal consumption before Rhodesia
 cut off Zambia's supplies.   Gas
 rationing has begun in both
 countries.
 Kaunda is disappointed with
 the UK-US-Ca.nadia.n effort thus
 far.   Unless the supply opera-
 tion becomes quickl  and visibly
 effective, Kaunda.
 might yet institute rash eco-
 nomic sanctions against Rhodesia.
 Such action could wreck the Zam-
 bian economy and increase the
 possibility of a large-scale
 flight of essential European
 workers.
 On 22 December, Kaunda's
 threatened move to bar imports
 of vital Rhodesian coal supplies
 was averted at the last minute
 only by Prime Minister Wilson's
 reminder of the disastrous con-
 sequences of such a move for the
 Zambian economy
 In London, Wilson obtained
 parliamentary approval for in-
 stituting oil sanctions, but at
 the price of reaffirming his gov-
 ernment's opposition to the use
 of military force in the Rho-
 desian crisis.

 DEVELOPMENTS IN TRADE
 Despite the recent conclu-

 East and West Germany on inter-
 zonal trade (IZT), important is-
 sues remain unresolved.

 BETWEEN EAST AND WEST GERMANY
 Under the new agreements,
 West Germany will transfer 50 mil-
 lion DM from the East's surplus
 balance in the consumer goods
 and food account to its deficit
 strategic goods account.  As a
 counterconcession,   East Germany
 in 1966 will buy coal valued at
 40 million DM, almost 50 percent
 above such purchases thus far in
 1965.
 Discussion of the main un-
 resolved issues--FRG compensation
 for elimination of the petroleum
 products subsidy, and the method
 of signing basic modifications
 of the IZT agreement--will resume
 at the next regular meeting sched-
 uled for 10 January.
 Despite the current impasse,
 trade in the near future is ex-

 high levels apparently achieved
 in 1965.
 BELGIAN PROBLEMS IN WALLONIA
 The Belgian Government is
 assigning highest priority to ac-
 tion to counter the growing eco-
 nomic deterioration and political
 alienation in Wallonia, the coun-
 try's French-speaking area.
 The Wallonian problem is
 acute at this time because of the
 difficulty that the coalition
 parties are having over next
 year's budget.   Prime Minister
 Harmel's Social Christian Party
 (PSC) is seeking cuts in expend-
 itures for social security and
 education as the price for hav-
 ing supported some Socialist pro-
 posals for increased taxes. The
 PSC's acceptance of higher taxes
 was not enough,  however,  to se-
 cure the support of a majority
 of the Walloon Socialist deputies,
 who broke party discipline to
 vote against the government's
 revenue bill.   These dissidents
 may be joined by others of both
 parties in opposing the govern-
 ment's attempts to reduce expend-
 itures.
 The parties have reluctantly
 agreed that a number of uneconomic
 coal mines, representing 12 per-
 cent of the nation's total pro-
 ducing capacity, will be closed
 as an added economy measure. Gov-
 ernment subsidies to the remain-
 ing mines will be increased, but

 the mine closings will seriously
 hurt the economies of the affected
 areas, most of which are in Wal-
 lonia.
 To counter the growth of
 federalist sentiment in Wallonia,
 the government hopes initially
 to attract American investment
 to provide employment there. The
 minister of economic affairs told
 US officials in Brussels that un-
 less several large American firms
 are brought into the area within
 the next six months to offset the
 effect of the mine closings, there
 is a serious danger the Socialist
 Party will break into Walloon and
 Flemish wings.   In such an event
 the Socialists could no longer
 Liege
 L I E G E
 participate in the coalition,
 which would mean the downfall of
 the present government.
 In contrast to historically
 dominant Wallonia, the Dutch-
 speaking Flanders portion of Bel-
 gium has shown increasing pros-
 perity in recent years, partly
 as a result of receiving since
 1959 some 80 percent of all for-
 eign investment in Belgium. This
 reversal of economic roles has
 heightened long-standing animosi-
 ties between the two linguistic
 communities.   For example, some
 50 persons were injured at Fouron
 on 19 December in the latest of
 a series of clashes between the
 two groups.

 GERMAN CHANCELLOR'S
 Bonn officials are express-
 ing satisfaction with Chancel-
 lorhard's mid-recember visit
 to Washington despite the pub-
 lic impression that results
 failed to equal the expectations
 Bonn had permitted to build up.
 On the key question of nuclear
 sharing in NATO,  the Germans
 have acknowledged that no de-
 cisions were taken,  but they are
 looking to further discussions
 among the interested governments
 and in the recently established
 NATO Special Committee on nu-
 clear questions.
 Bonr press spokesman Karl
 Guenther von Hase told newsmen
 on 22 r:ecember that Bonn's ob-
 jective during the Washington
 talks was to set forth "prin-
 ciples" concerning an "appro-
 priate share"  in nuclear defense
 and not to seek agreement on a
 specific project at this time.
 As outlined by lefense Min-
 ister von Hassel,  Bonn now an-
 ticipates two general fields
 of action on nuclear sharing:
 consultation on strategy and plan-
 ning as foreseen for the NATO
 Special Committee, and "quiet
 discussions" among alliance mem-
 bers aimed at establishment of
 a common weapons system.   Bonn
 presumably hopes to gain even-
 tual acceptance of a NATO sub-
 marine fleet along the lines of
 the British proposal for an At-
 lantic Nuclear Force.
 Erhard's expression of
 satisfaction with the talks was
 mirrored in the optimistic state-
 ment issued by his Christian
 VISIT TO WASHINGTON
 Democratic Party's press service
 that a way out of the impasse
 on nuclear sharing has been
 found.   The independent,  influ-
 ential newspaper Die Welt saw
 the  ,understanding on principles"
 as a good beginning,  the poten-
 tial of which should not be un-
 derestimated.                                                                       The press service
 ,of the opposition Socialists,
 'however,  took the view that the
 'appropriate share in nuclear
 !defense" envisioned in the com-
 munique was the "least binding"
 of possible declarations and
 concluded that all projects for
 physical participation in weap-
 ons systems must now be written
 off.
 On other questions, Von
 Hase expressed Bonn's satisfac-
 tion with the "understanding
 shown by US officials of the West
 German view that the effects of
 a nonproliferation agreement on
 the alliance should be studied
 carefully before concluding any
 such agreement.   Political par-
 ties and the press also welcomed
 the American invitation to par-
 ticipate in US space projects
 as a highly significant oppor-
 tunity for German science and in-
 dustry.   The US ambassador to
 NATO feels the American initia-
 tive on space cooperation comes
 at a most propitious time,  since
 European countries increasingly
 are concerned about the techno-
 logical gap between themselves
 and the US.   He feels Germany is
 one of the countries ideally
 suited to cooperate effective!
 such space endeavors.

 PROSPECTS IMPROVE FOR ITALIAN SOCIALIST REUNIFICATION
 Prospects for reunification
 of Italy's Socialist (PSI) and
 Social Democratic (PSDI) parties
 have been gradually improving in
 recent weeks and are expected to
 receive another boost from the
 8-11 January PSDI national con-
 gress.   The issue is crucial for
 future political developments be-
 cause leaders of both parties
 feel that a reunified party--
 representing some 18 percent of
 the total vote--would be able
 to increase its leverage on the
 dominant coalition partner, the
 Christian Democrats, and to com-
 pete effectively with the Commu-
 nists for the allegiance of
 Italy's large leftist electorate.
 PSDI Secretary Mario Tanassi
 --who until recently had serious
 reservations about reunification
 --has declared that the merger is
 now "inevitable."   He believes
 a majority of over 95 percent at
 his party's congress will approve
 prompt acceptance of the PSI's
 proposal for immediate launching
 of "common action at all levels"
 between the two parties.   PSI-
 PSDI caucuses in both houses of
 the Italian Parliament have al-
 ready developed plans for joint
 action and close cooperation.
 An important early test of PSI-
 PSDI harmony may be provided by
 the expected post - PSDI congress
 meeting of  Italy's governing
 coalition partners to consider
 the status of the government's
 legislative program.
 Tanassi also expects his
 party will place no conditions
 on the merger despite the ob-
 stacles that the PSDI has cited
 in the past.   These included the
 issue of PSI ties with the
 Italian Communists at the local
 administrative level and in the
 labor field,  the relationship of
 the PSI to the Socialist  Inter-
 national, and the PSI's adher-
 ence to what some Socialist Demo-
 crats describe as an obsolete
 concept of "neutralism and in-
 ternationalism" in foreign pol-
 icy.   Leaders of both parties,
 however,  now appear willing to
 seek compromises, and the PSI
 has already taken positive steps
 to meet PSDI reservations.
 Beyond these obstacles,
 the question of the timing of So-
 cialist reunification remains
 the most difficult to resolve.
 Both Italian President Faragat
 and Deputy Prime Minister Nenni
 are committed to the merger as
 soon as practicable and report-
 edly hope to accomplish the
 process by next fall--well in
 advance of the 1968 national
 elections.
 The PSI,  however,  is also
 concerned that the merger not
 occur before "other democratic
 socialist forces" can be included
 so as to give the party a broader
 base.   Therefore,  the Socialists
 --with an eye to their eroding
 electorate--are likely to move
 cautiously toward reunification,
 and the actual merger,  if all
 goes well, may not be realized

 Although Christmas passed
 peacefully enough, underlying
 tensions continue in expectation
 of action Garcia Godoy may take
 after last week's firefight be-
 tween the rebels and regular
 military in Santiago.   The Pro-
 visional President appears con-
 vinced that both sides share re-
 sponsibility for the conflict
 and may feel compelled to take
 some punitive measures.   The two
 contending factions,  however,
 have developed their own versions
 of the event and neither is likely
 to be satisfied with less than
 complete vindication.   If recal-
 citrants on either side object
 to the presidential decision,
 the provisional regime will prob-
 ably again have to fall back on
 the Inter-American Peace Force
 (IAPF) .
 Under pressure from younger
 officers, Defense Minister Rivera
 has been taking a harder line,
 charging that presidential ad-
 viser Buenaventura Sanchez has
 attempted to split the President
 from the regular military.  Ri-
 vera.has also issued in the name
 of the Defense Ministry a mani-
 festo blaming the rebels for the
 Santiago fighting.   The US De-
 fense attaches report that com-
 pany-level officers and NCOs are
 agitated over the provisional
 government's continued toleration
 of Caamano's "army."   Before the
 holidays,  they reported that "most
 military are spoiling for a fight"
 and this view still holds.
 Isolated acts of terrorism
 by extremists on both the right
 and left have further aggravated
 the situation.   Homes and busi-
 nesses--including two radio sta-
 tions--owned by rebel supporters
 have been shot up or bombed, prob-
 ably by the right.   On the left,
 terrorism is being spearheaded
 by the pro-Pekin  Dominican Pop-
 ular Movement
 In this delicate situation,
 the Provisional President has
 abandoned his earlier view that
 the public "demands" quick retri-
 bution for the Santiago fighting
 and has been temporizing in evi-
 dent hope that passions will cool.
 He postponed a public report on
 the Santiago incident slated for
 last week, and now says he will
 make one on the night of 29 De-
 cember.   Garcia Godoy has told
 Ambassador Bennett he intends to
 Jo something drastic "before
 that t."

 Garcia Godoy will probably
 attempt to moderate the impact of
 whatever course of action he
 chooses by consulting beforehand
 with all interested parties,                          in-
 cluding the OAS ad hoc committee.
 Under present circumstances
 violence could break out without
 warning and an unplanned incident
 could escalate into a major con-
 frontation,  a development that al-
 most  inevitably would involve the
 IAPF.   The Communists would almost
 certainly attempt to exploit such
 a situation through their ability
 --demonstrated during the past two
 weeks--to manipulate street mobs        25X1
 and rioters.   This, combined with
 a widespread availability of arms,
 poses a continuing danger to secu-
 rity.
 Although the British Guianan
 People's Progressive Party  (PPP)
 and its December special congress
 concentrated on electing new of-
 ficers and did not decide whether
 to follow a policy of peaceful
 or violent opposition to the Burn-
 ham government,  Cheddi Jagan's
 undisputed leadership of the
 party was reconfirmed,
 The PPP's last regular con-
 gress, held in April 1965,  broke
 down because party  leaders could
 not decide whether to elect a
 moderate or an extremist as party
 chairman--the number two position
 in the PPP.   In order to prevent
 an open rift, Jagan postponed
 elections and assumed sole interim
 responsibility for PPP administra-
 tion.
 All of Jagan's choices for
 party officers were elected at
 the December congress.   Cedric
 Nunes, an activist currently
 detained for suspected complicity
 in the June bombing of the US
 Consulate office, was elected
 chairman.   Since Nunes is in
 prison,  he is unlikely to play a
 major part in policy formation
 at present.   Jagan's support for
 Nunes'  candidacy may have been
 one of many strategic moves de-
 signed to satisfy all factions
 in the party and thereby paper
 over the moderate-extremist split.
 It is likely that PPP lead-
 ership will continue to be divided
 and that the party will drift in-
 effectually until Jagan stops
 vacillating and clearly opts for
 a policy of moderation or extrem-
 ism.                                                                 He is currently on a trip
 abroad that is scheduled to in-
 clude stops in Prague, Havana,
 and Moscow, and he will probably
 return home in February.   No im-
 portant policy decisions are
 likely to be made in his absence.

 With the February 1967 election
 little more than a year away,  Nic-
 araguan political activity is gain-
 ing some momentum.   General Anas-
 tasio Somoza, commander of Nic-
 aragua's National Guard,  has left
 no doubt about his intention to
 run as the candidate of the ruling
 National Liberal Party  (PLN).  How-
 ever,  the opposition conservative
 parties are still primarily en-
 gaged in internal feuding and have
 been unable as yet to organize an
 effective campaign against the
 Somocistas.
 During the past month,  Gen-
 eral Somoza has engaged in a
 veritable whirlwind of activities
 to enhance his reputation prior
 to the PLN convention.   These
 noisy events have been widely pub-
 licized by the Somoza press, with
 editorials and poems lauding the
 general in effusive terms as a
 "condor soaring over the Andes"
 and with other hyperboles.   Dur-
 ing 'the festivities for the gen-
 eral's 40th birthday,  Chamber of
 Feputies President Orlando Mon-
 tenegro actually proclaimed Somoza
 a candidate for the presidency.
 The general acknowledged the trib-
 ute,  but remarked that he could not
 accept a nomination while he re-
 mained in the army.
 Discord in the opposition
 camp is highlighted by the dilemma
 facing Traditionalist Conservative
 Party  (PCT)  leader Fernando Aguero,
 who finds it difficult to maintain
 even a facade of party unity. While
 denouncing the PLN and the "Somoza
 dictatorship," Pugero has in turn
 been denounced by members of his
 own party.   Jose Cuadra Cardenal,
 prominent PCT official,  recently
 resigned his post as technical
 secretary of the party and an-
 nounced his intention to fight
 against "bad leadership."  US Em-
 bassy observers believe former
 president Luis Somoza could be be-
 hind Cuadra's resignation.,  Since
 Aguero's dictatorial tactics have
 alienated many conservatives, there
 is a possibility that Cuadra might
 serve as a rallying point for
 dissenters
 However, at present Cuadra has
 chosen to remain within the PCT.
 In addition,  the PCT has had
 several other setbacks.   For ex-
 ample, interparty negotiations on
 electoral reform came to a sudden
 halt when the present Schick gov-
 ernment refused to accept any of
 the substantive changes requested
 by the PCT.   The party must now un-
 dertake an expensive and cumber-
 some petition process if it is to
 be legally reinstated.
 The embassy has noted that
 with the failure of political con-
 ciliation efforts, hotheads on both
 sides may force a return to tradi-
 tional intransigence.                                                                             Moreover,
 ill-feeling against the Somozas re-
 mains alive, and the probability of
 a return to the Somoza  "dynasty"
 could revive old hatreds and create
 additional domestic turmoil.   In
 any case, the outlook for the
 coming year appears to be an in-
 creasing deterioration of the re-
 laxed atmosphere fostered by Presi-
 dent Schick.

 The military junta has an-
 anounced its plan to restore con-
 stitutional government in 1966
 through presidential elections to
 be held on  5 June.   A two-month
 campaign in which the political
 parties are promised -full free-
 dom within the                    limits of public
 order would precede the contest.
 The president-elect would take
 office on 1 September.
 Constitutional changes to
 be made before the campaign will
 probably include a ban on re-
 election of aspiring former pres-
 idents such as four-time presi-
 dent Josd Maria Velasco Ibarra
 and e..-President Camilo Ponce
 Enriquez.   The office of vice
 president probably will be sup-
 pressed and the  legislative branch
 reformed.
 The junta's plan reflects
 determined opposition by the
 armed forces high command to both
 an interim civilian president and
 a constituent assembly--steps
 desired by most politicians who
 fear that otherwise the military
 will impose a president.   The
 armed forces are aware, however,
 that in the past such arrangements
 have tended to exacerbate insta-
 bility.
 The politicians have dis-
 played negligible energy since
 the failure of attempts to over-
 throw the junta last July, and
 are unprepared for a presidential
 race.   They probably will con-
 tinue to urge a constituent as-
 sembly that they could control,
 but may also attempt to concert
 ephemeral "fronts" or coalitions
 in hopes of developing a winning
 combination.   Lack of provision
 by the junta for election of a
 congress--historically the least
 stable or effective branch--thwarts
 the ambition of many politicians
 and may further inhibit their cam-
 paign enthusiasm.
 Minister of Government Garcia
 Velasco, who favored a constituent
 assembly, has left the government,
 and for the moment, other parti-
 sans of this approach are muted.
 Ex-junta member Freile has found
 no response to his plaints against
 the government from hiding, and
 he now lacks the organized fol-
 lowing to give his presidential
 ambitions more than a remote
 chance.   Little has been heard
 from exiled Velasco Ibarra,  al-
 though some of his partisans an-
 nounced that he would be a can-
 didate regardless of the govern-
 ment's attitude.   The other nomi-
 nees, Raul Clemente Huerta and
 Carlos Guevara Moreno, remain
 silent.
 There are persistent rumors
 that some  opponents  of the tran-
 sition plan have found military
 support and may attempt to es-
 tablish a new junta or a single
 executive.   Embassy sources indi-
 cate that ex-President Ponce is
 behind efforts to concert a civil-
 military coup in order to prevent
 his being barred from the June
 contest.   Pressures for such an
 attempt will likely become most
 serious near the 29 January anni-
 versary of the widely hated Rio
 Protocol which defined Ecuador`s
 boundaries with Peru.

 Seven years after independence, the radical
 West African state of Guinea is subject to acute
 internal tensions that could threaten the stabil-
 ity of President Sekou Tourd's regime.   The polit-
 ical enthusiasm initially generated by the coun-
 try's single party, the Democratic Party of Guinea
 (PDG), is being stifled by local, tribal, and in-
 dividual. interests.   Despite Tourd's attempts to
 blame many of Guinea's difficulties on foreign med-
 dling, he has already felt obliged to make sweep-
 ing internal shifts.
 For a country of its small size and relative
 lack of development, Guinea exercises a dispropor-
 tionate amount of influence among the more radi-
 cal African states.   This, together with its poten-
 tial economic importance as possessor of over 40
 percent of known world reserves of bauxite, has
 tended to make it a focus of international inter-
 est.  An influx of Communist aid and advisers
 shortly after independence made it appear that
 Guinea was being drawn irreversibly into the Com-
 munist sphere.   However, this trend was abruptly
 halted following exposure of an allegedly Soviet-
 inspired plot in late 1961.   Since 1962, Guinea has
 steadily increased its ties with the US, which is
 now the principal donor of economic and technical
 aid.   Close relations have never been resumed with
 France despite the example of other French-speaking
 African states and the desires of many influential
 Guineans.   Domestic political pressures could pro-
 duce another shift in orientation as sudden as
 that of four years ago.
 When Guinea abruptly voted
 its independence in September
 1.958, its chief asset was its
 highly organized political party,
 the PDG, which had a revolution-
 ary, egalitarian, and somewhat
 puritanical outlook.   During the
 final years of French rule, Tourd
 and his associates used the party
 to fuse Guinea's normally antagonis-
 Page 1
 tic tribes and social classes into
 a unified anticolonial force,
 and the momentum of this effort
 carried over into the early pe-
 riod of independence.   After
 seven difficult years, however,
 the PDG's ability to engage all
 the people in a selfless nation-
 building effort is showing signs
 of fraying.
 On the positive side, Tourh's
 regime, by creating a widespread

 sense of civic responsibility,
 has accomplished far more than
 have most other newly independ-
 ent African states.   His regime
 is well ahead of others in the
 field of social development, es-
 pecially in terms of education,
 status of women, and the eradi-
 cation of tribalism.   Neverthe-
 less, these things represent good
 beginnings rather than final ac-
 complishments, and they are sub-
 ject to undermining by internal
 rivalries, foreign manipulation,
 and economic difficulties.
 In fact, economic conditions
 in Guinea have been deteriorating
 ever since independence. Although
 Communist countries soon stepped
 in to replace the suddenly ter-
 minated French support, many of
 their initial aid projects proved
 to be ill-conceived and unproduc-
 tive.   During the past few years,
 foreign aid to Guinea has come
 from more diversified sources and
 has been somewhat better suited
 to the country's needs.   It has
 contributed a modest variety
 of processing plants and a lim-
 ited improvement in such fields
 as communications and transporta-
 tion.   Simultaneously, however,
 vital agricultural production
 has declined in both the subsist-
 ence and small plantation sectors,
 and there have been intermittent
 food shortages.
 The country's economic prob-
 lems are rooted in the govern-
 ment's capricious domestic poli-
 cies, which are more often promul-
 gated to satisfy nationalist sen-
 timent or to follow a socialist
 pattern than to deal with the sit-
 uation at hand.   In 1960, for ex-
 ample, Guinea adopted its own cur-
 rency as a manifestation of polit-
 ical independence, but the cur-
 rency is now virtually worthless
 and nonconvert ible .   Moreover,
 shortages of foreign exchange have
 cut deeply into supplies of con-
 sumer goods and have prompted var-
 ious clandestine trading arrange-
 ments. There has been a mounting
 incidence of farmers' withholding
 their produce, of illicit deals
 in foreign currency, and of
 b]tackmarketing and smuggling.
 In 1964 an estimated 60 percent
 of Guinea's exportable products
 were smuggled out for hard cur-
 rency and even most goods legally
 imported were smuggled out be-
 fore they could reach local con-
 sumers.   It was general knowl-
 edge that police and party of-
 ficials participated extensively
 in these activities.
 For several years the gov-
 ernment attempted directly to
 conduct most retail trade in
 Guinea.   In November 1964, after
 a year of experimenting with a
 more liberal commercial system
 and attempting persuasion through
 PDG channels, it resorted to
 force to induce observance of
 stringent new economic regula-
 tions.   Smugglers were arrested
 and many independent merchants
 and peddlers were put out of
 business as retail trade in
 staple goods reverted to direct
 government operation.   A special
 party commission was set up to
 investigate possible economic
 wrong-doing on the part of of-
 ficials.
 Other economy measures in-
 troduced in 1964 added to the gen-
 erral discontent.   Of these, the
 most unpopular appears to have

 been a rigid restriction on the
 number of students permitted to
 go on to secondary schools in
 Guinea or to continue their ed-
 ucation abroad.
 One dramatic result of all
 these measures has been a massive
 emigration from Guinea to neigh-
 boring countries, especially to
 relatively prosperous Ivory Coast
 and Senegal.   Conakry officially
 closed the borders in November
 1964 and used security forces to
 enforce the closure; some of the
 restrictions were lifted during
 1965, but controls remain tight
 and certain categories of indi-
 viduals such as soldiers, stu-
 dents, and unmarried girls are
 still not permitted to leave.  In
 all, about ten percent of the
 Guinean population is estimated
 to have departed, mostly during
 the past two years.
 SEKOU TOURS
 Politically, Tourd has never
 been an absolute master in Guinea,
 and as contradictory pressures
 build up, his policy decisions
 tend to become more erratic. PDG
 doctrine, for which Tourd is ul-
 timately responsible, emphasizes
 broad participation in govern-
 ment affairs and the use of the
 consensus method for determining
 policies.   Tourd probably cannot
 arbitrarily impose his will even
 within the PDG's 15-member polit-
 buro,and he has not been able to
 generate real forward movement
 at several of the recent specially
 called sessions of the party's
 national council. Although Tourd
 has a unique ability to artic-
 ulate the needs, emotions, and as-
 pirations of the Guinean people,
 there are also a number of other
 top figures who are politically
 important in their own right
 and can probably delay or reshape
 policies they oppose.
 There is good evidence that
 Tourd has long been dissatisfied
 with some of his colleagues. How-
 ever, his efforts to purge the
 politburo--dating back to 1962--
 have been notably unsuccessful.
 As president, he has a freer
 hand to reshuffle the government
 than the party, but even there
 certain individuals apparently
 are virtually untouchable.
 Local complaints recur about
 party and government officials
 practicing tribal discrimination
 or using their positions for
 personal gain.    Over a year
 ago, Tourd accused unspecified
 officials of improper conduct in
 their dealings with foreign

 embassies.   More recently, exten-
 sive transfers have been carried
 out in the security forces, in-
 cluding the dismissal of the com-
 mander of the large military camp
 near Conakry and the replacement
 of the defense minister.   The
 general atmosphere of suspicion
 and recrimination appears to have
 intensified as conditions within
 the country have worsened.
 Tribal antagonism to the re-
 gime has occurred primarily among
 the Fulani, who make up over a
 third of the population, and among
 the Malinke, the second largest
 group.   The Fulani enjoyed a
 privileged position under French
 rule and have never been fully
 reconciled to the present system.
 The Malinke, on the other hand,
 are the dominant tribe in the
 PDG and the government, but many
 of them are also members of the
 traditional merchant class that
 has been badly hurt by the con-
 trols on commerce.
 Other political tensions ap-
 pear to arise from various domes-
 tic factions siding with different
 foreign powers.   Prominent Fulani,
 for instance, have been critical
 of Toure for the exclusion of
 France from Guinea's economic de-
 velopment since 1958.   Some other
 leaders would prefer to see the
 Soviet Union or Communist China
 in the place of the US, which
 Toure has now accepted as the
 leading partner in Guinea's eco-
 nomic development.
 In this atmosphere, rumor
 campaigns of the wildest kind
 have developed.   Some of the
 stories circulated include re-
 ports of gross police brutality
 against people picked up for mi-
 nor infractions of economic regu-
 lations, of a supposed US-insti-
 gated plot to overthrow Toure,
 and of the alleged mysterious
 death in the Soviet Union of the
 regime's most prominent Fulani
 personality.
 November "Plot" Expose
 Sekou Toure's dramatic pub-
 lic charges last November that
 domestic enemies and foreign
 powers were plotting against him
 brought some of the smoldering
 dissidence out into the open.  It
 Is unlikely that those accused
 actually possessed a serious po-
 tential for overthrowing the
 government.  Nevertheless, the
 "exposure" of the plot provided
 the occasion for sweeping person-
 nel changes.   Party activity was
 ELlso stepped up to demonstrate
 public solidarity with the re-
 gime.   Announcements that inves-
 tigations are continuing in order
 to establish evidence against ad-
 ditional plotters may be designed
 to intimidate other malcontents.
 As elaborated thus far, the
 plot supposedly was planned by
 Ivory Coast President Houphouet-
 Boigny with the support of two
 French cabinet ministers and the
 presidents of several other
 moderate African countries. The
 principal agent identified in-
 side Guinea was Mamadou "Little"
 Toure, a Malinke cousin of the
 President and the former head of
 the state textile trading company.
 His role allegedly was to hire
 "commandos" who would create dis-
 turbances as a cover for the as-
 sassination of Toure.   According

 to government accounts, three
 such assassination attempts have
 failed, including two on the 2
 October national holiday.
 The money involved was al-
 legedly brought in from Abidjan
 by Francois Kamano, head of the
 Ivory Coast Social Security Of-
 fice, who has family ties in
 Conakry and visited there often
 as Tourd's guest.   Both "Little"
 Tourd and Kamano seem to be free-
 wheeling operators well known in
 Ivory Coast as well as Guinea.
 The latter was arrested briefly
 in 1963 in connection with a
 plot against Houphouet-Boigny.
 on President .Houphouet-Boigny,
 under whom Tourd began his po-
 litical career in the 1940s. They
 broke in the 1950s over ideolog-
 ical issues, and currently are
 rival spokesmen, respectively,
 for radical, anticolonial, and
 socialist Africa and for moderate,
 pro-Western, and capitalist Af-
 rica. Tourd's quarrel with Ivory
 Coast is of such emotional in-
 tensity that it may be partially
 responsible for Guinea's recent
 militancy regarding the Organi-
 zation of African Unity and the
 Rhodesian issue.   Guinea was the
 first of the nine states that
 broke diplomatic relations with
 Britain over this question.
 This and other prevailing
 conspiracy stories reflect a com-
 bination of normal Guinean dis-
 trust of foreigners, tribal an-
 tagonisms, echoes from two plots
 exposed some years ago, and gen-
 eral suspicions aroused by Guinean
 feelings of frustration and iso-
 lation.   Guineans are also likely
 to confuse foreign contact with
 plotting, and criticism with sub-
 version.   Thus far, government
 and party surveillance has been
 adequate to detect and neutralize
 any serious threat.
 External Repercussions
 One immediate result of the
 November plot charges was a
 break in diplomatic relations
 with France.   The two embassies
 were promptly closed and economic
 negotiations, which had seemed
 to be progressing, were called
 off.
 Tourd's charges against
 French-oriented Ivory Coast were
 accompanied by a stinging attack
 In any case, the pro-French
 and pro-Ivorian group within the
 Guinean regime is currently in
 eclipse.   There are some indica-
 tions that in order to bring
 this about, Tourd may have felt
 obliged to ally himself with pro-
 Soviet elements, thereby increas-
 ing their weight in the Guinean
 political equation.   Although
 the President presumably be-
 lieves that he can remain their
 master, their influence may prove
 more than he bargained for in an
 essentially fluid situation.
 A new rapprochement with Mos-
 cow was under way even before the
 recent plot disclosures.   In July,
 President Tourd made his first
 official visit to the Soviet
 Union since the 1961 episode in
 which the Soviet ambassador was
 sent home for his alleged sub-
 versive activity.  Before leaving
 Conakry, Tourd implied to US of-
 ficials that the visit was a ges-
 ture meant to please PDG elements
 dissatisfied with the results of

 the priority given to Western aid
 over the past few years.
 Moscow may have offered to-
 ken commitments to Tourd, but
 no new aid agreements are known
 to have been signed.   However,
 Guinea has persisted in claim-
 ing that the USSR "would assure"
 construction of the long-pro-
 jected Konkoure dam, hydro-
 electric plant, and aluminum
 smelter, as well as a detailed
 list of other projects.   The ag-
 gressive handling of the subject,
 both in the news media and at a
 special meeting of the top party
 council, may have been aimed at
 putting additional pressure on
 Moscow, but was more likely in-
 tended to satisfy the pro-Soviet
 faction within the regime.
 Many Guinean leaders would
 welcome Soviet entry into the
 aluminum picture either for its
 own sake or as a form of pres-
 sure on the Western companies to
 step up their activities. Guin-
 eans tend to view rapid develop-
 ment of the bauxite industry as
 their chief hope for overcoming
 their present economic diffi-
 culties.
 Current production is pro-
 vided mainly by Fria, a consor-
 tium of Western companies in
 which the US firm, Olin Mathie-
 son, is the principal shareholder
 and a French firm has operational
 responsibility.   Another American
 firm, Harvey Aluminum, has an
 exclusive concession for exploi-
 tation of the massive reserves
 at Boke and has formed a mixed
 company with the government of
 Guinea.   Last June, US AID pro-
 vided the proposed Boke opera-
 tion with a loan guarantee, but
 arrangements for financing have
 not been completed.   The Guinean
 Government, which nationalized
 a French concession on these
 reserves four years ago because
 of nonperformance, presumably is
 becoming impatient at the delay
 in beginning work on the proj-
 ect.
 Although the Chinese Commu-
 nists are active in Guinea and
 their aid programs are generally
 well received, they do not ap-
 pear to have any significant
 group of supporters among PDG
 or government leaders.   Tourd
 himself appears to have been so
 upset by the militarist and
 racial doctrines expounded by
 Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi
 while visiting Conakry last Sep-
 tember that he is unlikely to
 develop closer relations with
 Peking in the foreseeable future.
 The current tense situa-
 tion in Guinea could continue
 indefinitely.   The country's
 economic problems and political
 tensions have already been build-
 ing up over a span of several
 years and there is little indi-
 cation that a dramatic denoue-
 ment is in sight.   Moreover, it
 appears unlikely that Tourd's re-
 gime could be overthrown by do-
 mestic dissidents in the near fu-
 ture.

 Sudden shifts in Guinea's
 domestic and foreign policy can-
 not be ruled out, however. Guinea
 already has moved from a close
 identification with the Communist
 bloc in 1961 to a primary reli-
 ance on US aid in 1965. The per-
 manence of present and future al-
 liances will be equally depend-
 ent on the views of Guinea's
 leaders as to where their best
 interests lie.
 It is an important article
 of Sekou Tourd's political faith
 that his regime should reflect
 the wishes of the people.   If
 competing pressures should be
 resolved and a new consensus
 produced within the PDG in fa-
 vor of different policies, Tourd
 might be expected to adjust
 his programs with little or no
