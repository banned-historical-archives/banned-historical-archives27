 Mr. Herbert E. Hetu
 Assistant for Public Affairs
 Central Intelligence Agency
 Washington, D. C.  20505
 Here is the edited version of our background session at the
 Agency, which we are planning provisionally to publish in the magazine
 appearing Monday, November 21.
 It was necessary,, obviously, to cut drastically -- we had enough
 for 15 pages -- but I have striven throughout to preserve not only the
 language of the analysts but the nuances of the points they were making.
 I would be most grateful if we could have this back with any
 corrections sometime Monday to allow ample time for layouts and art work.
 We will arrange to pick it up if you will let me know when it is ready.
 Again, many thanks for your help in arranging this project.  We
 feel that the result is really most worthwhile and will provide U.S.News
 & World Report readers with an exceptional insight into world issues that
 concern them.

 If our projections are right and if actuarial tables can
 be relied upon, two developments are likely to coincide in
 the Soviet Union in the first half of the 1980s: an energy
 and economic crunch and a fairly large-scale renovation of
 leadership.
 You now have a kind. of gold-watch leadership--a leadership
 at the end of its tenure. It has not had a record
 distinguished by innovation in domestic policy. And it is not
 one that you would expect to produce radical reforms to
 ameliorate acute problems shaping up in five or six years.
 We discern no evidence that the Soviets are beginning to
 undertake the costly measures--political and economic--that are
 needed to cope with the crunch we see coming up in the early
 '80s--for example, in energy. Now, it may be that the
 leadership has long been aware of what lies ahead and has a
 certain confidence that the country can muddle through--that

 they will be able to get through this rough period ahead with
 treasures that are not highly disruptive.
 Another possibility is that we see things that they do not
 yet see clearly. If that is true, then there is a much
 greater potential for radical changes in Soviet policy. That
 is why we are watching as carefully as we can for evidence of
 how the Soviets perceive their economic situation in the
 early '80s.  It is terribly important in analyzing what to
 expect when the crunch comes.
 A worst-case scenario goes like this: The leadership in
 power today is unwilling or unable to take the long-lead-time
 measures to cope with the economic situation that we see
 coming; up in the early '80s. Then the succession occurs with
 none of the, necessary hard decisions having been made.
 The succession brings into power a leadership that may
 have a better appreciation of the problem but is even less
 capable of dealing with it because it is preoccupied for five
 years sorting itself out and establishing who has the real

 clout. In that situation, you could expect a very sharp
 struggle over the allocation of resources and immobilism when
 it comes to introducing major reforms in the Soviet system to
 cope with their economic problems. That is the worst case
 from the Soviet viewpoint.

 In Russia in-the-early_'80s?
 Already economic growth is slowing down markedly. In the
 '60s Soviet growth averaged 5 per cent if you use Western
 concepts of national income. In the first half of the  '70s,
 growth averaged 4.9 per cent and this year we expect less
 than 3 1/2 per cent. We expect the slowdown to continue into
 the '80s.
 In the past, the problem could be attributed to
 agriculture, which caused cyclical swings. The leadership.
 could blame the weather. You recall how, when there was a bad
 harvest,-Khrushchev complained that ""God has done it to us
 again. " But now a lot of underlying, long-range trends are

 weather, climate or agriculture.

 One-of the most serious is in energy. The CIA has made a
 prediction that Soviet oil production will start declining
 between now and the early 1980s. Today the Soviet Union is a
 net exporter, delivering 1.1 million barrels daily to Eastern
 Europe--at well below the world market price--and another
 300,000 barrels to other Communist countries. Exports to
 Eastern Europe are supposed to increase to 1.6 million
 barrels by 1980.
 If you take our middle projection of.Soviet oil production
 between now and 1985--neither the most optimistic nor the most
 pessimistic--then Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union together
 will be in the market for 2.7 million barrels daily.
 Aside from footing the greatly increased bill for oil
 imports on that scale, they have three options. One is to
 mount a typical, all-out Bolshevik-fashion campaign, which

 might enable them to achieve 5 per cent conservation while
 maintaining economic growth at the assumed rate of 3 to 4 per
 cent. A second option is to let the economic growth rate drop
 to 2 1/2 or even 2 per cent while pushing for coal, nuclear
 energy and other oil substitutes.
 The most drastic option is for the Soviets simply to tell
 the East Europeans,    You have to go your own way. We will
 have to reduce our oil exports to you from the 1.6 million
 barrels that we have promised to 800,000." Now you're
 talking about an increased oil bill for Eastern Europe of 6
 billion to 7 billion dollars a year in terms of probable 1983
 oil prices. Those are the kinds of numbers that would have at
 least a transitory political shock on Eastern Europe. You're
 right when you suggest that this could be potentially
 dangerous.

 shapirg up as another serious drag on the economy. To patch
 out the labor force a bit,-you might very well see pressure
 to reduce the size of the armed forces, which number about 4
 1/2 million men--more than double the size of our forces. One
 possibility would be a reduction to 3 1/2 million by
 shortening the time of compulsory military service. These
 kids would provide a very useful addition to the labor force,
 as they would be much more sophisticated in an industrial

 rigors and discipline of military life.

 Over the next four to five years we don't see anything

 programs--offensive and defensive--which actually account for a
 relatively small percentage of the total.
 But there is this caveat:  It's very difficult to
 anticipate what happens when the crunch comes and the
 leadership feels it can't maintain that pace. When the
 leadership fully perceives its problems, which we think they
 increasingly will do, there surely will be friction among the
 claimants of resources. To judge how they will respond we-.

 From an economic as well as political and military

 This point should be rrade first: The Soviets see what they
 regard as the correlation of forces as moving perceptibly in
 their favor since World War.II. At the same time, they
 traditionally have been concerned about the danger of pushing
 the U.S. and the West generally over the brink--the danger
 that cumulative Soviet successes could have a galvanizing or
 provocative effect on the behavior of the West. The Soviets
 still have a great deal of respect and concern about the
 potential of the United States for engaging them in a
 competition that would be less comfortable for them than the
 one that they've experienced over the past decade or so. They
 regard the detente mechanism as a way of preventing bumps
 which could lead to unwanted or desired confrontations or

 the danger of a lashing-out in the West as a reaction to the

 They always have to make a very difficult judgment of what
 the traffic will bear in any given situation. Their decision
 depends on how they read probable U.S. behavior. Whether they
 were pursuing an active policy of detente with the United
 States or not, they would be concerned to avoid a high-level
 military confrontation with the U.S.
 In the." third world," their policy largely reacts to
 circumstances, opportunities, risks and dangers which are not
 of their making. If you look at the record of the past 10
 years or so, there isn't a great deal of evidence that they
 have desisted from seizing opportunities that fortune threw
 in their way.

 The Soviet debt is now 16 billion. Both have been rising

 amassed in the past few years. The West German, French and
 British bankers are especially uneasy and are bringing
 increasing pressure on their governments to provide

 They seem unmoved when you point out that the Soviets are in
 trouble, too. They're confident that the Soviets politically
 can't allow Bulgaria to go down the tubes.
 The fact is that in the Eastern Europe-Moscow economic
 relationship the Eastern Europeans always ask for more and
 they get less. For example,-this year the Eastern Europeans
 are in trouble again in agriculture because of stagnation.
 They would dearly love to get hold of grain from the Soviets.

 The Soviets are very hard-nosed with them.
 A Polish Ambassador said publicly that "the best the
 Soviets are going to do for us is 1 to 1 1/2 million tons. We
 need 6 million tons minimum and perhaps 7 million tons of

 It's a real dilemma for them. They're pulled in several
 directions simultaneously, and that's not a sham.
 They welcome in a general way a leftist tendency in
 Western Europe because it has some potential long-term
 payoffs for the Soviets. But, on the other hand, they are
 dealing with heterodox Communist parties and the degree of
 control that they will be able to exercise over these parties

 is uncertain at best.
 Also uncertain is the impact on foreign policy--say, in
 France--of a left coalition running French affairs. After all,
 the Soviets have done fairly well in dealing with anti-
 Communist French Governments since De Gaulle. There are
 rumors that they would prefer to have Giscard d'Estaing
 returned to power rather than see a victory for the Union of
 the Left, including the Communists. That might have an
 additional side benefit of teaching the French Communist
 Party a lesson about defying Moscow.
 Furthermore, the Soviets obviously are impressed by the
 fact that Euro?-Communism has certain infectious potential for
 Eastern Europe and perhaps even for the Soviet Union in the
 long run. In other words, the Soviets are truly and genuinely
 ambivalent about Euro-Communism.

 favor and likely to remain so at least over the next five
 years. This is due to a combination of two factors.
 First is the tremendous improvement in Israel's military
 capabilities since the 1973 war, partly as a result of the
 receipt of massive amounts of U.S. equipment, including
 scphisticated weapons. In addition,.Israel has expanded the
 size of her active-duty forces and improved the efficiency of
 the reserve system. On top of that, of course, is the fact
 that Israel enjoys certain geographic advantages which
 enhance her defensive posture.
 By contrast, the principal Arab states have had a very
 uneven record in terms of improvement in their military
 capabilities.
 For example, Egypt's capability is relatively less than in
 `73 primarily because of the breach in her relationship with
 the Soviet Union. Ninety. per cent of the equipment of the
 Egyptian armed forces still is Soviet.

 major impact on her military capabilties. Syria's posture in
 e Golan Heights is the weakest since '73 because about a
 quarter of her combat-maneuver brigades are committed to
 lebanon.
 Saudi Arabia has never been a major military factor nor
 has Jordan, for that matter.  Iraq is the one Arab state that
 has made major--indeed, impressive--improvements in military
 capabilities since '73. The forces that Iraq could dispatch
 to the Golan Beights in the event of renewed hostilities
 would be significantly larger than they were in the last war
 but still not enough to reverse Israeli military superiority.
 Libya, of course, has been busily accumulating huge stocks
 of equipment, but basically these are going into storage.
 Practical logistical difficulties make it doubtful that those
 stocks could be made available to the confrontation states in
 a timely fashion. Also, Libya's dispute with Egypt has
 reduced the likelihood, in the near term at least,-that she
 would be much disposed to assist the Egyptians.

 STORY :CIA
 It would be a mistake to assume that all of this means
 that the Arabs have no military options. As in '73, they have
 the capability to initiate a new war in the hope that they
 would impose heavy losses on Israel and that pressures of the
 international community would bring the hostilities to a
 quick end before the Arabs were defeated. They would hope
 that they would achieve benefits in the ensuing negotiating
 process.
 In_this_situation=_what-are_the_chances_of_Israel_
 launch;tp_g_a_prg_emptive_war?
 The Israelis are much more alert than ever before due to
 the effect of the military equipment we have provided and the
 fact that they were taken by surprise in '73. It's very
 unlikely that they will be surprised again. Therefore, the
 chances for a pre-emptive Israeli attack are real if they see
 themselves threatened by the Arabs or if they believe that
 the Arabs are ready to go to war.

 nuclear war in_the_foreseeable_future?
 Given the Israelis' current military capability, there
 should be no impulse or need for them to move to the use of
 nuclear weapons. They should be able to wi   the next war in a
 relatively short period of time--although in the end that will
 depend on the fortunes of battle. If for some reason the
 Israelis were not achieving as quick or clean a victory as
 they would like, the pressure on them would not be so much to
 use nuclear weapons. Rather they would have to decide whether
 to halt offensive action and settle into a defensive posture
 or whether to continue to pursue the Arab armies, despite the
 losses, in the hopes of defeating them thoroughly and ending
 the threat for a considerable period in the future.
 An~l_the_Arabs?
 We don't see any of the Arab states having a nuclear
 capability during the coming five years. Beyond that, the
 possibility exists that one or a number of them might have
 the technical, capability to develop nuclear weapons.

 How_susceptible_is_Israel to_pressure_from_the_U~S~?
 In terms of economic pressures, the likely Israeli
 response would be negative. In terms of military equipment,
 we are their major supplier, in particular, of sophisticated
 weapons which give them their edge over the Arabs. If that
 source of supply were to dry up.-there would be few options
 for Israel.
 But it is misleading to pose the question in terms of
 overt pressure being brought to bear on Israel. The fact is
 that any Israeli leader would have to look down the road and
 ask whether the course he was pursuing was going to alienate
 the United States, whether as a result of his policy he could
 count on the United States as a continuing supplier of
 weapons, economic support and diplomatic support. Trying to
 determine how this will influence Israel's attitude toward
 negotiations and a settlement with the Arabs is a much more
 difficult computation.

 The Saudis are the key to this question, and we should
 understand that they are under dual pressures. On the one
 hard,  they have always been and. will continue to be reluctant
 to antagonize the U.S. That is so in part out of fear of
 retaliation but also out of fear of deterioriation in their
 relationship with this country--military, economic and
 political.
 On the other hand, if the Geneva Conference fails to start
 by the end of the year or shortly thereafter, or if
 negotiations were to break down, other pressures would come
 to bear forcefully on the Saudis. They would be influenced by
 the fact that they, like any other Arabs, get angry and
 frustrated when there is no progress. More importantly,-the
 Saudis would come under severe pressure from other Arabs to
 do something if negotiations broke down--to use their oil and
 financial resources as a political weapon. Simply in order to
 save their own hides they would have to consider use of those

 weapons.
 We don't want to be pinned down to specific scenarios. But
 take a situation where negotiations broke down but there is
 to war and not even consideration of a war. There are several
 things the Saudis could do short of overt use of the oil
 weapon. They could consider a selective embargo on purchases
 of U.S. goods as a signal to us--even though that would entail
 risks to their own military program and their economic-
 development program.
 They could also play a less moderating role in influencing
 OFEC decisions on oil-price increases. So far they have been
 the principal price moderator in OPEC. But in the event of
 slow or inadequate progress on Geneva,  they may feel
 compelled to relax whatever pressure they might be planning
 to bring to bear on OPEC to restrain price hikes.
 It is not just a matter of the Saudis being pushed by
 other Arabs. All along they have been concerned about
 protecting themselves against radicalism and Soviet influence

 in the area. They see both of these as a direct threat to
 their regime. The Saudis will have to consider whether the
 failure to move toward an Arab-Israeli settlement increases
 radicalism or Soviet influence. If they decided that this was
 the case, -then you should not write off their use of any
 weapons at their disposal to change the situation-primarily
 ty using the oil weapon to pressure the United States to move
 toward a settlement.

 That question should be considered in terms of the Chinese

 world as an offset to the Soviet Union is much more important
 than 'their interpretation of movement on the Taiwan issue.
 One must distinguish the difference between Chinese posturing
 and reality. We are dealing with a shrewder, tougher, more
 innovative negotiator in Peking than before. The Chinese are
 going to look at practical adjustments in relations with the
 Soviet Union, and, at the same time, they are more inclined
 to play hardball on Taiwan. They will make the political
 costs slightly higher for the U.S. They will continue to

 The Chinese are moving to make their relationship with the
 United States less important by cultivating other
 relationships. They see the connection with Japan as very
 important, particularly as a source of technology. Also, they
 are seeking stronger ties with West Germany as another
 offset.
 You see, after the 1969 border confrontation with the
 Soviets, the Chinese had nowhere else to turn but to the
 United States. Now they are trying to reduce their reliance
 on the U.S. by employing much more skill, much more open-
