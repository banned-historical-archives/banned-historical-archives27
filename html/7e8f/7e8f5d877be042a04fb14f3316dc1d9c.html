 Afghanistan's Masood:
 Building a Durable Insurgency
 Key Judgments    Insurgent commander Ahmad Shah Masood is the dominant resistance
 In/ormation available   leader in northeastern Afghanistan, where he either controls or strongly
 as 4f 2 February 1987   influences as many as 20,000 insurgents in six provinces. Over the next  25X1
 was used in this report.
 year he will probably escalate the level of fighting in the northeast,
 successfully attack isolated Afghan regime garrisons, and disrupt lines of
 communications to force the diversion of scarce Soviet resources.
 Masood's success in building a durable insurgency in the northeast will
 prompt guerrilla leaders to give more attention to military and political
 organization, tactics, and cooperation with other insurgent groups. Masood
 and other commanders will probably seek increasing assistance-especially
 highly sophisticated weapons and training-from the United States and
 other backers of the resistance.
 Masood has significantly strengthened the previously moribund insurgency
 in northeastern Afghanistan and scored promising military victories.
 Building on techniques he used to construct a successful organization in the
 Panjsher Valley, Masood has brought many of the major insurgent groups
 in northeastern Afghanistan under his control and established alliances
 with other influential commanders. He has created a political organization,
 instituted innovative military techniques, increased the pace and intensity
 of military activity, and developed an impressive second-echelon leader-
 ship.
 Masood plans increased activity in urban areas and the establishment of
 closer ties to insurgent leaders in other parts of Afghanistan. He wants to
 increase the level of combat to score additional impressive victories to
 demoralize the Afghan regime and the Soviets and to build his credentials
 as a leader of national standing.
 Although Masood has successfully reduced the level of factional strife and
 enlisted fighters from outside his own Tajik ethnic group over the last two
 years, suspicions and jealousies among the traditionally dominant Pashtuns
 and the Peshawar elites will prevent him from realizing his goal of national
 military leadership.
 The Soviets and the Afghan regime regard Masood as one of the most dan-
 gerous insurgent leaders and will continue their efforts to kill him. They
 know he is a hero in the West and that his death or capture would be re-
 garded by the insurgents and their supporters as a major blow.

 Masood's death or capture would have a significant impact on the
 insurgency in the northeast. The resistance probably would not recover 1'or
 years as morale would temporarily plummet and factional discord again
 increase. His proteges would carry on the fight, although it would take
 years for a single leader to emerge who would approach Masood's
 leadership skills and persuade the diverse northeastern leaders to accept
 direction.
 Masood must deal with several problems: factionalism- especially be-
 tween his forces and those of the Hizbi-Islami (Gulbuddin~undercuts
 unity efforts; his supply lines are vulnerable; and Soviet and Afghan regime
 infiltration of his organization complicates the organization of complex
 offensives. His prospects for continued success, however, are good. His
 victories last year at Farkhar and Nahrin have sharply increased his forcE;s'
 morale, and his men are better armed, better trained, and more experi-
 enced.
 As a member of the Jamiat-i-Islami, Masood supports a moderate version
 of Islamic fundamentalism and is not as radical as either Gulbuddin
 Hekmatyar's Hizbi-Islami or Abdul Rasul Sayyaf's Ittihad-i-Islami Barai
 Azadi Afghanistan. Relations between Masood and Pakistani authorities
 are cool but correct, with some Pakistani officers believing that Western
 journalists are overimpressed with Masood and Masood resenting attempts
 by the Pakistanis to advise him. We know little about his attitudes
 regarding cooperation with the United States, but his Western education
 and anti-Soviet attitudes suggest he is sympathetic to US interests.

 Afghanistan's Masood:
 Building a Durable Insurgency
 Ahmad Shah Masood is one of the few Afghan
 insurgent commanders with a cohesive political and
 military strategy for waging a protracted guerrilla
 war against the Soviets. Masood, an ethnic Tajik, has
 been building an effective insurgent organization
 since his return from exile in Pakistan in 1978. He has
 brought together disparate groups and created a
 formidable political and military force. He has orga-
 nized insurgent forces in the Panjsher Valley and used
 them in coordinated offensive and defensive opera-
 tions.
 Analysis of Masood's past practices demonstrates that
 he emphasizes organization, training, planning, disci-
 pline, mobility, and technical expertise. In contrast to
 many resistance commanders, he has persuaded insur-
 gents to fight outside their native areas. He stresses
 the importance of local support and is sensitive to
 local leaders and politics. Masood attempts to meet
 civilian security and material needs and to dissuade
 the local population from fleeing to Pakistan.
 Masood's military operations have been well planned
 and tactically sophisticated by Afghan standards. His
 military operations emphasize retaining the initiative
 and striking when the chances of victory are most
 favorable. He maintains pressure on Soviet and Af-
 ghan regime forces through low-risk guerrilla tactics
 such as mining, ambushes, and harrassing rocket and
 mortar fire. His occasional assaults on vulnerable
 regime garrisons and outposts in the Panjsher Valley
 have caused significant damage. The regime lost
 approximately 600 men to Masood when his forces
 overran the Peshghowr garrison in June 1985. His
 forces have rarely stood and fought against superior
 enemy forces, and, when faced with impending offen-
 sives by Soviet and regime forces, he has ordered the
 evacuation of civilians, abandonment of base camps,
 and dispersal and burial of food, arms, and ammuni-
 tion.
 We believe the Soviets regard Masood as one of the
 most troublesome insurgent leaders. Since the inva-
 sion in December 1979, Soviet and regime forces have
 launched seven major offensives and numerous small-
 er operations in unsuccessful efforts to drive Masood's
 forces out of the Panjsher Valley and cripple his
 organization.

 Masood is in25X1
 t o secon  p ase o a t ree-p ase political-military
 strategy. In the first phase he emphasized classic
 guerrilla hit-and-run tactics while he strengthened his
 organization in the Panjsher Valley. In the second
 phase he is attempting to unify all of the insurgent
 groups throughout the northeast, raise combat activi-
 ty there, and conduct coordinated attacks on vulnera-
 ble regime garrisons. Masood's long-term goal-and
 the third phase of his strategy-is to initiate a
 strategic offensive against powerful Soviet and regime
 bases in the northeast

 he believes a durable insurgen-

 war there to the Soviets, undermine the regime's  25X1

 Masood is a Panjsheri Tajik who belongs to Burhan-
 uddin Rabbani's Jamiat-i-Islami party. The Jamiat-
 i-Islami, the only predominantly Tajik party in the
 primarily Pashtun resistance alliance, seeks an Is-
 lamic government and society in ~gfghanistan, al-
 though the tone of its ideology is moderate. Members
 of the Jamiat-i-Islami are drawn from former stu-
 dents oj'state religious schools, Rabbani's clerical
 colleagues, Islamic intellectuals, and members of the
 Sufi brotherhood of the north. Jamiat relations with
 most other insurgent organizations are good, but
 relations with parties ciliated with Gulbuddin Hek-
 matyar and Abdul Rasul Sayyctf are strained.
 The 3 million Tajiks of ~lfghanistan,form the largest
 ethnic group Q1'ter the Pashtuns. Sedentary and with-
 out tribal customs, they are divided by dialect, social
 custom, geography, and, to a lesser extent, by reli-
 gion. Tajiks serve in a wide range ofprofessions, jrom
 agriculture and small business to military and civil
 service. Compared with the Pashtuns, Tajik society
 more easily permits the emergence of a leader who
 lacks social standing or wealth. Tajiks olten display
 teamwork as fighters, unlike the Pashtuns, who are
 more individualistic.
 The Tajiks of the Panjsher Valley derive their cohe-
 sivenessfrom their attachment to their locale. They
 have developed special social customs, dialect, and
 economic patterns, and this localism contributes to
 rivalry with neighboring Tajik communities.
 using techniques he employed in constructing his
 Panjsher Valley organization. Masood will also at-
 tempt to persuade the civilian population to remain in
 Afghanistan in relatively safe valleys so they can
 provide food and shelter to the insurgents and enable
 him to keep as many men as possible in the field,
 The Tajiks of Herat speak the same Persian dialect
 as the Iranians of Mashhad, with as many as 40
 percent of the Herat Tajiks belonging to the Shia
 branch oj'Islam. Their level oj"education is higher
 than other Tajiks, exceptfor those living in Kabul.
 The Sunni Tajiks of Herat have intermingled with
 other ethnic groups in the province, especially the
 Aimaks and the Pashtuns.
 Northern Tajik communities extend from Badakh-
 shan and Takhar Provinces-where they are in the
 majority-to Badghis Province. Tajiks in Badakh-
 shan, Takhar, and some areas of Baghlan speak a
 distinct dialect of Persian known as Badakhshi. Tlie
 Persian dialect of the other northern Tajiks-those
 in Faryab, Jowzjan, Balkh, Samangan, Baghlan, and
 Konduz-is similar to the dialect in Kabul. The
 northern Tajiks have so intermingled with the Uz-
 beks that most are fluent in both Persian and Uzbelci.
 The central Tajiks live in Ghazni, Lowgar, Kabol,
 Parvan, and Kapisa Provinces, speak various dialects
 of Persian, and are nearly all Sunni. Except jor the
 Panjsheris, they have intermingled with the Pash-
 tuns, and many ethnic Pashtuns in the region have
 adopted the Tajik language and Tajik social cus-
 toms. The Tajiks and Pashtuns of these areas have
 long been on good terms. They would cooperate

 Masood has not been completely successful in secur-

 east. For example:
 ? He has found Hizbi-Islami (Gulbuddin) insurgents
 to be especially reluctant to accept his leadership,
 and fighting between the two groups continues
 despite a truce Masood secured with the group's

 and has refused to join Masood's alliance.

 Secret
 We believe that Masood's success in recruiting allies
 reflects his increasing political sophistication and
 sensitivity in dealing with local people who in the past
 regarded him as an outsider and feared Panjsheri
 "imperialism." The Andarab Valley guerrillas and
 civilians now support Masood, in contrast to their
 defection to the regime in 1982 when Masood's initial
 attempt to expand his influence failed because of
 Building a Structure. Masood has organized councils
 of resistance leaders to coordinate insurgent activil:y,
 heavyhanded Panjsheri tactics
 Several factors, in our view, contribute to the local
 commanders' willingness to work with Masood:
 25X1
 25X1
 ? According to Jamiat press sources, Masood seeks to
 assuage local fears by giving the commanders in
 each area important roles in planning and carrying
 out combat operations.
 ? He has shown over the years that he can effectively
 plan and carry out important attacks and has
 managed more than most leaders to avoid publicized
 defeats.
 Masood has taken additional steps to foster political
 unity across provincial, tribal, and ethnic boundaries
 in the northeast,
 25X1
 25X1
 ? Some insurgent commanders in the northeast are
 worried about the growing number of regime and
 Soviet outposts in that area and want help in actions
 against them.
 ? He has given credit for successful operations to local
 commanders, thereby increasing their prestige and
 alleviating their fears of being eclipsed by Masood.
 ? He can help local commanders get arms, ammuni-
 tion, and other supplies by personally requesting
 them on their behalf from Jamiat leaders in Pesha-
 war or distributing excess captured weapons in
 return for accepting his authority.
 We believe, moreover, that Masood's organization
 and efforts illustrate a growing professionalization of
 regional resistance organizations along similar lines.
 Ismail Khan in Herat, Mullah Malang in Qandahar,
 and Jalaluddin Haqqani in Paktia Province are all
 emphasizing cooperation, establishing rudimentary
 political and administrative structures, and seeking to
 expand outside their traditional areas of influence.
 ? In late spring 1986 a separate Military Council of
 the North was formed to end internal feuding and
 coordinate the armed activities of Jamiat groups in
 Badakhshan, Takhar, Konduz, Baghlan, Parvan,
 and Kapisa Provinces.
 ? Masood has established a newspaper entitled Muja-
 hid, which is prepared and printed in the Eshka-
 mesh area of Takhar Province and distributed
 throughout the northeastern provinces.
 ? Masood has moved the Panjsher Military Academy
 and the central judicial court into the Khailab
 Valley in Takhar Province,
 The military academy trains junior com-
 manders from throughout the northeast, showing
 them the advantages of cooperation under Masood's
 leadership, and then sends them back to their home
 areas to spread Masood's ideas and imitate his
 military strategy.

 Strengthening Local Control. Masood has worked to
 develop local supervisory councils to oversee political,
 military, and economic affairs, according to the Ja-
 miat press. The development of effective administra-
 tive structures at the local level will aid his efforts to
 obtain money, food, construction materials, couriers,
 saboteurs, and intelligence agents, as well as strength-
 en local insurgent forces. Masood apparently devotes
 much time and energy to consulting with local coun-
 cils, elders, and insurgent commanders and intends to
 resolve questions of military deployments, operational
 areas, military planning, and mediation between rival
 insurgent groups.
 Expansion Plans. Masood intends gradually to ex-
 pand his influence,
 both farther north and south of the Salang Tunnel
 area and into the Shomali Plain to widen the scope of
 his attacks against convoys and protect the main
 entrance to the Panjsher,
 A Cohesive Military Strategy
 Masood's military strategy, in our view, is based on
 demonstrating the concrete benefit of cooperation
 among commanders. He has had substantial success
 in using mixed units of insurgents from several areas
 to score dramatic victories
 Central Units. A cornerstone of Masood's military
 strategy is the creation of "central units"-mixed
 fighting units from several ethnic groups under Ma-
 sood's central command-which are used outside

 The units receive
 Masood eventually wants to form 10 central units that
 will be mobile, well trained, knowledgeable of terrain
 outside their home areas, and readily accepted by
 local populations
 Central unit personnel have to be experienced in
 combat and have at least a high school education,
 Masood hopes to
 use these fighters to form a cadre of experienced
 leaders, who will, in turn, train and lead similar
 groups throughout the northeast.

 Base Areas. Masood has established and organized
 mountain bases in deep valleys in the rugged moun-
 tains in the northeast.
 each mountain base has its own "general comman-
 der"; tens of group commanders; local defense, mo-
 bile, and strike groups; and training areas as well as
 numerous subbases. Each mountain base has its own
 civil administration including a judiciary, clinics, and
 schools. Cave shelters for civilians and insurgents and
 irrigation channels are being repaired or built, accord-
 ing to press accounts.
 Demonstrating Success. Masood's successes in over-
 running the regime garrisons at Farkhar and Nahrin
 in Takhar and Baghlan Provinces in August and
 November 1986 demonstrated the potential of the
 central units and further enhanced his personal pres-
 tige. The units, after weeks of careful training and
 preparation, carried out the assaults
 Preparing./or the Next Round. Masood probably will

 depend heavily, in our view, on his ability to supply
 everything from food and clothing to heavy weapons

 Masood's capture of the regime garrison at Farkhar
 on 21 August 1986 was a major step in his campaign
 to increase the tempo of the war in northeastern
 Afghanistan and marked the first successful deploy-
 ment of Masood s central units, the multiethnic,
 specially trained groups he has been developing over
 the past year. The attack demonstrates Masood s
 ability to bring together insurgent units from several
 northeastern provinces and his growing influence and
 power outside his home base in the Panjshe
 The regime garrison at Farkhar was occupied by a

 It consisted of four or  ve matn  ases

 Insurgent casualties were four killed and two wound-

 part to Masood s planning and the use of trained
 insurgents as well as the absence of regime air and
 artillery support, Soviet advisers, and reinforcements.
 Masood's success at Farkhar apparently encouraged
 him to go ahead with asimilar-and equally success-

 Weapons and Equipment. Although Masood claims
 he captures 80 percent of his arms, ammunition, and
 equipment, we believe he is exaggerating and that he
 depends heavily on external support, especially for
 heavy weapons and large quantities of ammunition for
 field guns, rockets, recoilless rifles, mortars, and small
 arms. He will also need specialized military equip-

 lenses, sleeping bags, boots, clothing, and jackham-

 financial aid to refugees and families of insurgents

 organizations and Arab groups.

 Factionalism
 Disputes with other insurgent groups frequently result
 in armed clashes, divert scarce military resources, and
 distract Masood's senior leaders.
 many of the conflicts can
 be traced to longstanding local feuds and jealousies
 between rival ethnic and religious communities. US
 Embassy sources indicate Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,
 leader of the Hizbi-Islami (Gulbuddin) party, who is
 jealous of Masood's reputation and fears Masood's
 expansion will cut into his political influence, encour-
 ages his largely Pashtun supporters to resist Jamiat
 expansion into their areas and ignore Masood's offer
 of military cooperation.

 We believe Masood enjoys excellent relations with
 Jamiat-i-Islami leader Burhanuddin Rabbani and has
 powerful allies in the party hierarchy, which should
 help him retain his share of the aid provided by the
 party. Rabbani's control of money, weapons, and        25X1
 equipment received by the Jamiat-i-Islami, the in-
 creasing isolation of the extreme fundamentalist
 clique, and Masood's powerful allies in the party's

 advise him and sees such efforts as an attempt to

 Soviet and Regime Threats
 Soviet Military Operations. Intense Soviet and re-
 gime military operations against Masood's base areas
 may occasionally disrupt his plans and prevent him
 from increasing military pressure in the northeast.
 Soviet and regime
 forces launched two large operations in northeastern
 Afghanistan last summer, employing heliborne as-
 saults and nearly 1,000 vehicles-including armor,
 self-propelled artillery, and multiple rocket launch-
 ers-as well as heavy air support. Such operations
 result in the cancellation of planned operations as
 insurgents seek to avoid the overwhelming firepower
 of these forces. Moreover, widespread bombing of
 villages and farms results in localized food shortages
 and heavy casualties, which undermine insurgent and
 civilian morale.
 Subversive Operations. A major threat to Masood's
 success, in our view, is regime subversive operations
 aimed at sharpening rivalries in his group.

 of the war to undercut popular support for the
 insurgents,                         Both the
 Soviets and the regime almost certainly intend to
 continue their attempts to assassinate the more effec-

 fighting leader and his growing abilities to deal with
 ethnic and local rivalries will enable him to spread his

 convince other guerrilla leaders of the advantages of
 careful planning, unity, organization, training, anti

 Masood's long-term prospects depend, to a large

 Soviet and Regime Forces in the Northeast
 We believe that the ~g1ghan regime's military assets
 are inadequate to counter the threat that Masood
 poses. The provinces of Baghlan, Konduz, Takhar,
 and Badakhshan-where Masood is strongest-con-
 tain only one regime division scattered in three
 regiment-size and jour battalion-size garrisons
 There are many smaller
 regime posts, suc  as Far  ar, scattered around
 these provinces, but they have little military capabili-
 ty and are vulnerable to Masood's assaults.
 Soviet and regime forces assigned to the northeast
 are, in our view, inadequate to prevent the continued
 buildup of Masood s organization. A Soviet motor-
 ized rifle division and an independent motorized rifle
 regiment-a total of 12 motorized rifle battalions
 plus supporting armor and artillery-are assigned to
 the northeastern provinces. Many of these battalions
 are assigned to road security duties along the
 Kabul-Termez and the Keshem-Feyzabad roads, as
 well as manning a security perimeter around Khana-
 bad,
 An attack helicopter regiment is based at
 Konduz, but there are no fixed-wing aircrclf't in the
 immediate area. The Soviets also have six KGB
 border security battalions in the area. The Soviets
 could respond to Masood s campaigns either by
 frequently deploying forces from other parts of the
 country for temporary operations in the northeast or
 by stationing more units permanently in the north-
 eastern Hindu Kush. Soviet garrisons, however, are
 under considerably less risk of attack by Masood s
 forces
 In the Panjsher, a regime infantry division, a Soviet
 motorized rifle regiment, and a Soviet airborne bat-
 talion are garrisoned to hinder attacks on the Kabul-
 Termez highway. Thefurthest regime penetration is

 of Spetsnaz or airborne troops in the area would pose
 a greater threat to Masood's plans. Moscow probably
 would make more use of aircraft based in the Soviet
 Union. Continued success by Masood so near the
 Soviet border probably would provoke systematic
 campaigns to eliminate most organized resistance, a
 tactic employed by the Soviets early in the war
 because of similar concerns.
 25X1
 25h i
 The death or capture of Masood, in our view, would 25X1
 have a dramatic impact on the insurgency in the
 northeast. The resistance probably would not recover
 for years as morale plummeted and factional discord   25X1
 increased. We believe a new and strong leader would
 eventually emerge from the cadre of second-level
 commanders Masood has developed over the years,
 but his successor would have to establish his leader-
 ship and combat credentials as well as succeed in
 persuading other insurgent groups to coordinate their
 activities.
 Longstanding ethnic animosities and personal antago-
 nisms, in our view, will prevent Masood from realizing
 his dreams of national leadership. The Pashtun clans
 and tribes of the heavily populated eastern province25X'25X1
 believe that, as in the past, they should dominate   25X1
 Afghanistan and would be unlikely to accept an
 ethnic Tajik as a leader, no matter how impressive his
 military credentials
 We believe that the Pakistanis also will continue to
 regard Masood as an opportunist, no more worthy of

 Masood's efforts have major implications for the
 insurgency as it tries to maintain continued military
 pressure against the Soviet occupation of Afghani-
 stan. As Masood's operations become more far reach-
 ing and sophisticated, his financial and material    25X1
 requirements will continue to increase. He will almost

 certainly seek to obtain more sophisticated weapons-
 including antiair weapons-to combat the regime's
 technologically superior forces. Masood will continue
 to need large amounts of money and humanitarian aid
 to care for civilians who have lost everything in the
 fighting. Masood probably will also seek additional
 tactical and leadership training in Pakistan to
 strengthen his organization.
 Another impact of Masood's efforts will be greater
 combat activity in areas of the northeast that have, to
 date, seen little intense fighting. Prolonged combat
 operations almost certainly would result in a new
 surge of refugees from the northeastern provinces to
 Pakistan, further straining Pakistan's ability to pro-
 vide aid and maintain internal stability. Deteriorating
 security close to the Soviet border will almost certain-
 ly result in an increase in Soviet and regime opera-
 tions and make it even more unlikely that a viable
 pro-Soviet regime could survive a Soviet withdrawal.
 We know little about Masood's attitudes toward the
 United States, but his Western education and anti-
 Soviet attitude suggest he would be sympathetic to
 Western concerns and open to cooperation if he had a
 major leadership role in apost-Soviet Afghanistan.

 The Pen and the Sword
 Unlike many resistance leaders, Ahmad Shah Masood
 has a formal education and experience in guerrilla
 warfare that predates the Soviet invasion of Afghani-
 stan in December 1979. After attending the highly
 rated Istiqlal Lycee Francais in Kabul, he studied
 engineering at Kabul University and became active in
 the Muslim Youth Organization. He joined the stu-
 dent underground in 1973 when Mohammad Daoud
 overthrew the monarchy and, one year later, fled to
 Pakistan with other student dissidents. According to
 the Western press, he received training in guerrilla
 warfare from the Pakistanis. While in self-imposed
 exile, he apparently returned to the Panjsher Valley
 several times in the late 1970s to launch raids on
 government outposts. By 1979 he had set up his own
 operation in the valley, this time in opposition to the
 Communist regimes of Hafizullah Amin and Nur
 Mohammad Taraki.
 he had only a few weapons in his possession and a
 handful of men, mostly fellow Panjsheri students. To
 the best of our knowledge, Masood has not left the
 country since 1979.
 Masood has also put into practice Napoleon's tenet
 that organization and training are more important
 than weapons.
 new recruits undergo three months' instruction, which
 includes physical training, tactics, and indoctrination
 on current affairs and the nature of Communism.
 Masood's "warfare" schools also train fighters from
 other Jamiat groups,

 Masood demands similar discipline from his men. He
 insists upon their complete obedience and loyalty,
 according to the Western press. In 1982 a regime
 police officer confirmed that he will tolerate no
 insubordination or opposition.
 A man of action, Masood leads his men in battle. He
 personally selects his commanders,
 and is directly involved in training his
 troops. He mingles and jokes with his men and is
 concerned about their welfare.
 Masood is equally concerned about the civilian popu-
 lation.                       he is admired by
 the local population because of his honesty and com-
 mon touch and because he has shared their suffering.
 He sends out advance parties to lay the groundwork
 for local acceptance of his forces by the people,
 stressing the holy nature of the conflict and subse-
 quently recruiting and mobilizing them. He has set up
 a Panjsheri administrative framework that includes
 political, judicial, and taxation systems. He has
 helped resettle families forced from their homes by
 the war, encouraged private enterprise to stimulate
 the economy, opened schools, and launched a drive
 against drug abuse and traffickin .
