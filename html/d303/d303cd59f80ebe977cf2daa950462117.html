 Flake or Fox?
 Libya's Kaddafi is a dangerous man, but he seems to know what he's doing
 Now His
 Mind Works
 Egypt's Anwar Sadat once claimed that
 Kaddafi was "100 percent sick and pos-
 sessed of the demon." Another old
 foe, former Sudanese President Jaafar Ni-
 meiry, diagnosed him as "a split personal.
 ity-both evil." Even his admirers con-
 cede that Kaddafi is moody, hot tempered
 and unpredictable. An administration of-
 ficial argues that Kaddafi  "displays
 behavior typical of many sociopaths or
 psychopaths-extremely warm one mo-
 ment, then hostile and cold the next." Un-
 proven but persistent rumors speak of se-
 cret treatments in a Swiss sanitarium
 years ago. But there is no solid clinical
 evidence on which to base a judgment
 about Kaddafi's mental health, which
 forces analysts to rely on their own in-
 stincts. Former CIA Director Richard
 1 Helms, who has extensive experience in
 J the  i  e asoncludes that "Kaddafi
 is in some respects crazy like a fox. His
 various moves, even though seeming
 outlandish, appear to have some strategic
 or tactical motive behind them. I think
 he's peculiar, quixotic, eccentricBuut I
 on 't t in  e s crazy by any means."
 In large part, Kaddafi is a product of
 Bedouin culture. He was born 43 years ago,
 the son of a shepherd who lived in agoatskin
 tent in northern Libya, a region steeped in
 poverty despite the oil that enriched a few
 under the Libyan monarchy. Kaddafi took
 to the gospel of revolution at an early age,
 modeling himself at various times on
 Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser and China's
 Mao Tse-tung, among others. He learned a
 little English at a school in Tripoli and
 studied briefly in England, where he felt
 like an outsider, he says now. Back in Libya,
 he joined the Army, . married a former nurse
 and eventually fathered seven children. In
 1969 Kaddafi and a small group of fellow
 officers overthrew King Idris and steered
 Libya on to a radically new course.
 Reflecting his nomadic tribal back.
 ground, Kaddafi instinctively opposes the
 rich and powerful and resists any form of
 political structure and the impediments
 that go with it. Under his leadership, Libya
 has been transformed into al Jamahi-
 riyah-"the state of the masses." The oil
 wealth has been widely redistributed. Kad-
 dafi's political, social and economic ideas,
 some of them distinctly half-baked, are
 spelled out in the three slim volumes of his
 Green Book, self-consciously modeled on
 Mao's Little Red Book. "No representation
 in lieu of the people" is its overriding prin-
 ciple-the idea that everyone should share
 in government, town-meeting style. In
 practice, however, the Green Book con-
 cedes that any society will be ruled by the
 strong-in this case, Kaddafi. The colonel
 holds no formal job in the state; he is simply
 at Qaid, The Leader.
 "Kaddafi's foremost ambition is to domi-
 nate and unite the Arab world," says a
 white paper released by the State Depart-
 ment last week. He frequently compares
 himself to Garibaldi or Bismarck and has
 justified his use of violence and terrorism
 against moderate Arab regimes as neces-
 sary to achieve Arab unity." Kaddafi is also
 an egotist and a crybaby who sulks or
 throws tantrums when he doesn't get
 what he wants. He can act prudently and
 will even back down when he has to. But a
 study by the CIA and other U.S. intelli-
 gence agencies predicted a -year, ago that
 Kaddafi will never change. "We concluded
 that- tFiere is a zero pro Fa iytlit   that
 a  a  will abandon his dream of unit-
 ing the                                                                    ra  wor  under his leadership
 and of humiliating the United
 States," says an administra-
 tion official. "and an equally
 remote chance that he will
 abandon terrorism as his prin-
 cipal weapon.

 SOVIET ACTIVE MEASURES
 AND DISINFORMATION:
 by
 OVERVIEW AND ASSESSMENT                                          DENNIS KUX
 L ately there has been increased public
 attention  regarding  Soviet  "disin.
 formation" and "active measures,"
 attempts by Moscow to influence political
 attitudes  and public  opinion  in non-
 communist countries through deceptive and
 often covert means.
 Yet serious analysis has been limited.
 There has been a great deal of focus on
 Moscow's espionage endeavors, but this
 other facet of the Kremlin's intelligence
 operations has received far less scrutiny,
 either by the press or academics.
 The  terminology  pertaining  to  the
 subject is unfamiliar and loosely defined,
 even among specialists. In fact, the terms
 "active measures" and "disinformation" are
 both imported directly from the Soviet in-
 telligence lexicon. "Disinformation," the
 more frequently used and better-known term,
 is the English transliteration of the Russian
 "dezinformatsiya" or misinforming through
 the dissemination of information that is
 totally or partially false. The phrase "active
 measures" is the English translation of
 "aktivnyye meropriyatiya," the name of the
 Soviet KGB unit charged with implementing
 these activities.
 In  Soviet  intelligence  doctrine,  the
 concept of "active measures" covers a wide
 span of practices including disinformation
 operations, political influence efforts, and
 the activities of Soviet front groups and
 foreign communist  parties.  All  active
 measures have the common goal of enhancing
 Soviet influence, usually by tarnishing the
 image of opponents. They generally involve
 elements of deception and often employ
 clandestine means to mask Moscow's hand in
 the operation.
 Overall, where active measures fit in the
 Soviet framework may be better understood
 by considering the whole spectrum of Soviet
 foreign policy endeavors through the optic of
 "white," "gray," and "black" operations.
 Normal diplomatic, trade, aid, and in-
 formational  efforts  can  be  considered
 "white" or overt activities. "Gray" activities
 are  those  involving  communist  fronts,
 foreign communist parties, "clandestine"
 radio stations, or well-known media outlets
 for disinformation.  While not officially
 acknowledged to be Soviet sponsored, semi-
 overt "gray" activities are widely known as
 under  Soviet  direction  and  control.  In
 contrast, "black" activities involve genuinely
 clandestine operations: the use of agents of
 influence, spreading false rumors, duping
 politicians and journalists, and disseminating
 forgeries and  fake  documents.      Active
 measures fall under either the "gray" or the
 "black" rubric, although the line between the
 semi-overt and the clandestine is     often
 blurred.
 Finding an appropriate English phrase to
 describe active measures is difficult. Former
 Under Secretary of State Lawrence Eagle-
 burger has written: "No phrase in English
 conveys  precisely  the  meaning  of  active
 measures.       Perhaps  World    \k'ar   11
 psychological warfare operations proside the
 closest parallel.
 The Sosietc first u,ed active measures as
 a policy tool in the 1920s tihen %Iosco<
 sought to discredit emigre groups in Vice`tern
 Europe, particularly it France, by spreading
 disinformation and b\ luring emigre actiststs
 back to Russia through various subterfuges.
 Even before the 1917 Resolution, the Tsarist
 secret  police emplo%ed  similar  deceptive
 techniques, using foreign agents not only to
 collect intelligence but also to sow dissent
 among emigre groups and, by cos ert sub-
 sidies to selected journals, to attempt to
 create a better foreign press for Imperial
 Russia.=
 In  the  1950s  the Soviet  Union  in-
 stitutionalized these practices, establishing an
 intelligence unit that specialized in disin-
 formation; this was Department D within the
 First Chief Directorate of the Soviet in-
 telligence organization. In the 1960s, the term

 A S RECENTLY AS 1950 LIONEL TRILLING COULD PRO-     CSIS

 claim
 as if it
 i
 ,
 were
 ncontestable, that American
 conservatives had no ideas, only "irritable mental
 gestures." Today, though many conservatives remain irri-
 table, ideas they possess in abundance. Conservative
 thinking has not only claimed'the presidency; it has spread
 throughout our political and intellectual life and stands
 poised to become the dominant strain in American public
 policy. While the political ascent of conservatism has taken
 place in full public view, the intellectual transformation
 has for the most part occurred behind the scenes, in a net-
 work of think tanks whose efforts have been influential to
 an extent that only now, five years after President Reagan's
 election, begins to be clear.
 Conservative think tanks and similar organizations have
 flourished since the mid-1970s. The American Enterprise
 Institute (AEI) had twelve resident thinkers when Jimmy
 Carter was elected; today it has forty-five, and a total staff
 of nearly 150. The Heritage Foundation has sprung from
 nothing to command an annual budget of $11 million. The
 budget of the Center for Strategic and International Stud-
 ies (CSIS) has grown from $975,000 ten years ago to $8.6
 million today. Over a somewhat longer period the endow-
 HE CENTER FOR                 AND
 Studies, like Hoover at Stanford, is a conservative
 policy center attached to a generally liberal univer-
 sity (in this case, Georgetown). Unlike Hoover, CSIS is lo-
 cated well away from the parent campus: its offices on K
 Street, Washington's legal row, have the aspect of an in-
 vestment-banking firm.
 Perhaps because of its emphasis on international affairs,
 CSIS is the most aristocratic of the think tanks, and the
 most ceremonial. Big names abound. Henry Kissinger,
 Zbigniew Brzezinski, and James Schlesinger are "senior
 scholar-statesmen in residence." Other CSIS names are
 Thomas \ borer, a former chairman of the joint Chiefs of
 Staff; Ray Cline. a former deputy CIA director for inrclli-
 gence; the authors Walter Laqueur and Michael Lcdeen;
 the military analyst Edward Luttwak; and the economist
 Paul Craig Roberts. The most recent CSIS annual report
 resembles a social directory, listing a sixty-fiyc person ad-
 visory board, a fourteen-person executive board, a rvvcnrv-
 seven-person international research council, scat}, .,nd a
