on South America for coffee. As in Tibet, polyandry and polygamy are practiced; largely 
for economic reasons, it is common for sisters to share one husband and brothers to share 
one wife. This further checks the population increase. Sexual habits are rather free, and 
the incidence of venereal disease is high. Since they wear ragged sheepskin garments 
(without trousers or underwear) the year round, the people are dirty. Smallpox is still very 
common, and large numbers of the population have pock-marked faces. 
Sinkiang, Tibet, and the ether western provinces perch on a high plateau where agri-
cultural opportunities are highly limited. The Chinese are vigorous people, and would have 
advanced to the Western frontier long ago but for the fact that they could not support 
themselves there by agriculture. This is why they have moved instead toward Manchuria, 
Inner Mongolia, and Southeast Asia, and left the West alone. Barring large-scale industrial 
development, it will be hard even for the Communist government to induce the Chinese to 
leave the over-populated coastal areas and go to China's Northwest and Southwest. 
Sinkiang 
This vast border province :s the Northwest Administrative Region is surrounded by 
the Mongol People's Republic, Soviet Russia, India, Tibet, Tsinghai, and Kansu. Its area 
is 660,805 square miles, and its population 3,870,950. It is the largest province in China and 
contains four large mountain ranges. The Tien Shan, in the western and central areas, 
subdivides in the latter into the North Tiensha.n or Pei-lu and the South Tienshan or Narelti. 
The other ranges are the Altai in the north, the Karakoram along the Indian border, and the 
K'un-lun on the Tibetan border. Outside these areas, the province is a high altitude plateau, 
with many steppes and deserts. There are several land depressions, the largest occurring 
near Turfan, where the altitude is 928 feet below sea-level. 
The important rivers are the Tarim, NI &MISS, and the Ili. The Tarim River with its 
tributarie forms an extensive network in the western arid central areas and empties into 
the salt lake, Lop Nor, South of this river in the central area of the Tarim basin lies the 
Takla Makan Desert. The Manass River in the north, with its terminal lake, Telli Nor, 
is another long river. These rivers and lakes are well known for the shifting course they 
follow due to silting or the low water table. In addition to these river valleys there are 
several oases where there are permanent settlements. The province is arid, but less in the

north than in the south; precipitation amounts to about 10 inches annually, with a maximum 
on the mountain slopes, but variations are extreme. Temperatures vary greatly by season 
as well as from day to night, with a range of over 100?F to ?25?F. 
Agriculture found in the river valleys and at such permanent oases as Yarkand, 
Khot an (iio-tien silgar. Ariste Torfan, Quomul (11a-rni). Some areas with semi-
permanent streams are hastily cut with irrigation ditches and cultivated at times when water 
from the uplands replenish the flow. The crops cultivated are wheat, knoliang, millet, 
beans, rice, tobacco, cotton, and excellent fruits, The Dzungaria area north of the 'Nen 
Shan offers some possibilities for dry agriculture. The slopes and uplands of the Altai and 
'Men Shan serve as grazing areas for sheep, horses, and goats, most of the plains area being 
too arid for this. The animal husbandry provides a good wool slimly. Sinkiang is reported 
to have large resources of coal and iron ore and a certain amount of oil at Wussu, along the 
7'h-it Shan. Lead, nine, gold, silver, and jade are ltistl present, gold being produced at Altai, 
Kenya, and Chuguelesk. The province ranks sixth in iron ore reserves, but as yet produces 
no iron. Industries are limited to a few small chemical plants and cotton and woolen mills 
at Urumchi (Tihwa). There are general handicrafts in many sections. 
The province has no rail lines, although a I.' rumehi-l-ning (Kuldja)-Lanschou line has

it mainly with Russian and Kansu. Sinkiang is the center of the old "Silk Route," which 
connected China with the Middle East and Rome in early history and is still used. There 
are three air terminals, at Urumehi, Quomal, and Ta-ch'eng. 
The provincial capital of Urumchi (Tihwa) (43048' N and 870 36' E) is a trading center 
for wool, furs, hides, salt, and cotton goods. It is the terminus of the important roads from 
through Ch'i-rai. An important oasis in the southwest is Yarkand (38? 24' N and 
77? 16' E), with an area of 810 square miles and a population of 60,000. It is also a trading 
city on the old trade route to India and Afghanistan. Other important oases and trading 
towns are Agsu (41? 6' N and 790 58' E), on
tae A _gat: Rii es, with a cultivated area of 600 
square miles and a town population of 20,000, Khotan (37?7' N and 79? 56' E), with an area 
of 620 square miles and a town population of 26,000, Kaaligar (39? 27' N and 75? 50' EL 
with a cultivated area of 1,()00 square miles and a population of 35,000, and Ila-mi (420 
48' N and 93? 27' E), a smali town famous for its melon production. Southwest of the 
lia-tu-shan gold mines is the frontier town of T'a-ch'eng (460 45' N and 820 57' E). Farther 
north is the trading (Teter of Ch'eng-hua (47? 52' N and 88? 7' El, which is inhabited mainly 
by Mongols and Moslems engaged in grazing and farming. 1-ning (Kuldja) (43? 55' N and 
81? 17' E), in the West. is a strategic commercial town epecializing in tea and live-stock. 
Sinkiang is the largest but one of the most thinly populated provinces in China-
With the exception of Tibet, it is the least Chinese of the provinces as regards ethnic com-
position, Chinese accounting for oaly about 5 or 6 percent of its population. It also has 
a few Mongols and Manchus, but 90 percent of its population are members of various Mos-
lem tribes in Central Asia, of which the more important are the 1:ighurs, called in (7hina the 
Ch 'an T'ou Hui (Turban !lead Moslem), the Kazakhs, the Khirghiz, the Taranehite and the 
Uzbeks. The dominant. tribes like the Uighurs and Khirghiz are Turkic in race and speech. 
This population has evolved historically by the merging of an indigenous population with 
successive waves of invaders. The i'ightirs are agricultural, and live on the ontiefi of the 
Tarim basin; some of the population, :Ike the Ehirghiz, are nomads. There are also a few 
naturalized White Russians. 
Sinkiang hafi. been intermittently under Chinese rule for 2,000 years. K nown in history 
as Hsi Yiieh (Western territory), it was re-named Sinkiang, meaning New Dominion, by the 
Manchu government. The great Ilan generals, Chang Ch'ien and I'm! reached

Sinkiang. Effective Chinese influence was extended there also during the early T'ang 
dynasty. During the decline of the T'ang, however, the Moslem religion took hold on the 
Sinkiang population. During the Yuan dynasty, the Meegols conquered Sinkiang and 
the various tribes did not wax strong again until the Ch'ing dynasty. Following the exploits 
of Yo Chung-ch'i and Men Keng-yao, the Emperor Ch'ien-lung made an expedition 
to Sinkiang, and when he departed took back with him the Moslem princess Hsiang Fei, the 
"Fragrant Royal Concubine." (There is a portrait of her by Castiglione which shows her 
as a remarkably beautiful woman in martial dress.) About the time of the rai-p'ing 
Rebellion, the Moslems in the Northwest broke into rebellion, and it. became clear that 
Russia had designs on Sinkiang, especially on the Western district called An expedition 
led by Teo Tsung-t'ang put down the rebellion, and since then Sinkiang has been governed 
mostly by governors of Chinese origin. The problem, however, caused the Ch'ing 
gover--ent a great deal of trouble. 
After the establishment of the Republic (1912), Sinkiang was at first ruled by Yang 
Tseng-hsin, who preserved the area's neutrality and played Russia off against the National-
ist government. He was murdered in 1923, and was succeeded by Chin Shu-jen, a less able 
and more greedy man. After the rebellion of Ma Chung-Ying, Sheng Shih-ts'ai teak over 
and controlled the territory from 1932 to 1944. He was in some ways a rems.rkalA governor, 
but his harsh rule provoked the Kazakhs and led them to form an autonomous East Turkes-
tan Republic in the District. His replacement, when finally it occurred, was nevertheless 
an indication that central authority had at last penetrated Sinkiang. After that time the 
most .ritluential figure in Sinkiang affairs was General Chang Chih-chung, who improved 
economic relations with Soviet Russia and had some success in pacifying the various peoples. 
He later joined the Communist government. The political integration of Sinkiang into 
Communist China, however, is apparently proceeding slowly. 
The various national groups in Sinkiang, of course, have different customs and habits. 
One major problem is that the Chinese minority, though they have the advantage of being 
better educated, can not assume positions of leadership without provoking the other national 
grou pa. 
Suiyuan 
Suiyuan is a province in the North China Administrative Region. It is bordered by 
the Inner Mongol Autonomous Region, the Mongol People's Republic, Ningsia, Shensi, 
Shansi, and Chahar. Its population totals 2,057,750, and its area is 127,147 square miles. 
The province is geographically part of the Mongolian Plateau, and has the characteristic 
sparse population of desert areas. The Yin Shan in the central area, the chief mountain 
range, joins the Ho-lan Range to the west in Ningsia. The only river of significance is the 
Hwang (Yellow), which enters the province in the west. It separates into two courses 
within the province, the major channel running eastward to T'o-k'o-t'o, where it turns 
southward to form the boundary between Shensi and Shansi provinces. The other course, 
to the north, is an ancient channel (it dates back to the Ming dynasty). A system of irriga-
tion canals is located between Pao-Cou and Kweisui. The climate is continental, with 
ticvew winters, pnrtictilarly in the areas north of the Yin Shan. The desert areas receive 
almost no precipitation; the latter, therefore, is confined to the southern areas. 
Agriculture is limited to the Hwang River area, particularly south of T'o-k'o-Co. The 
crops cultivated are wheat, barley, kaoliang, soybeans, and medicinal herbs. Animal hus-
bandry, primarily in the hands of Mongols, is prosperous; camel hair and sheep wool are the 
chief exports. There are small deposits of coal, salt, and soda, with as yet only limited 
production. Industrialization is In its very beginnings: there are a few wool, flour, and egg-

processing mills at Kweisui, Pinat'ou, and Feng-chen, and wool and rug handicrafts are 
represented. 
The only rail line is the Peking-Suiyuan line, which enters Suiyuan in the southeast and 
extends west to Pan-t 'on. There are over 4,0(X) kilometers of highways leading to surround-
ing areas, chiefly concentrated in the southeast area. Only a portion of the Hwang River 
around the T'o--k'o-eo region is accessible to junk navigation. 
The provincial capital of Kweisui (40? 47' N and 1110 37' F.) is a trading and com-
munications center for Mongolia. It is on a rail line, and owes its development to this fact. 
It is about two miles from the old city of Kuei-hua. The terminus of the line is at Pao-Cou 
(40? 36' N and 110' 3' E), which serves as a center for the transshipment of goods between 
Tientsin and the northwest provinces. The goods 1:n:1:fled include imports of matches, tea, 
and kero:..ene, and exports of wool, fur, cotton, and medicinal herbs: ro-k't's-t'o (400 15' N 
and 1110 12' E) is a trading center in the heart of the best agricultural area. Feng-chen 
(40? 27' N and 113? 8' EL in the east on the rail line, is one of the few towns with industrial 
development. Northwest of the provincial capital is Pai-ling-miao (410 50' N and 1100 
27' E), seat of a lamasery with 1,000 lamas and one of the largest. in China. 
For historical and sociological information on this province see the section in this 
chapter entitled "Mongolia." 
Sungkiang 
This Manchurian province has an area of 79,200 square miles and a population of 
5,149.909. It is surrounded by Russia. Ileilungkiang, and Kirin, and includes the territories 
that the Nationalist government designated as Sungkiang and llokiang provinces (a 011iel 
of what was Suitgkiang, however, has been incorporated into Ileilungkiang Province). 
Major branehes of the Ch'ang-pai Range are included in the province: the I lsiao-psi Shan 
in the central area, the Lao-yeh Ling across the southern area (which is the watershed of the 
Milling and Suifen rivers), and the Wan-t a Mountains in the tiorthea.st from the Milling 
to the confluence of the Sungari and Ussuri rivers. Westward, there are the I Isiao-hsing-an 
Mountains, which form the boundary with Iledungliiring Province. The Sungari is the 
leading river in the province. It enters in the west and is joined by several rivers before 
flowing into the Amur at T'ung-ehiang. The Amur and Ussuri form part of the national 
boundary with Rus.sia. The N1uling and Noll ri??ers are tributaries of the Ussuri, and are 
partially utilized for irrigation and navigation. The climate varies considerably according 
to locality, temperatures ranging from 100?F to ?40?F (yearly mean: rbout 36?F). Pre-
cipitation, which is most abundant in the south, decreases toward the northwest (annual 
mean: about 22.6 inches). 
The chief agricultural crops are soybeans and beets around Pinkiring (Harbin), and 
rice, soybeans, and tobacco in the Mut an River Valley. The northern area of the province 
is agriculturally undeveloped. There are large forests in the upland areas which extend 
down to Kirin. Coal is the only significant mineral resource, there being large deposits at 
Mu-leng, Tung-ning, Mi-shan. 1-lan, and In production the Mi.alnin and Mu-leng 
mines are the most important. Chia-mu-ssu contains a munitions works; other industries,

is navigable heyond Pinkiang, and is used as a highway for horse-drawn vehicles during 
winter. The t'ssuri accommodates small steamboats up to Hu-lan, while the Mutan liver 
is navigable for smaller craft in the vicinity of the city of that name. The Tumen River is 
neeeersible to small steamboats. 
The provineial capital Pinkiang (Harbin) (45? 47' N and 126? 39' E), is an imp?tant 
communications and commereial center fer the entire northeast region. It has a population 
of 760,000. Mu-tan-chiang (45? N and 129? E) is the former provincial capital in the east, 
and the junction of the and "T'" chin'' rail lines. It is the marketing center 
for the surrounding Mutan River valley. An important rail terminus in the north is the 
agricultural town of Chia-mu-ssu (46? 49' N and 130? 21' E), on the south bank of the 
Sungari River. The richest agricul'ural town in the north is Hu-lan (45? 59' N and 126? 
36' E), located north of !Lubin at the confluence of the Hulan and Sungari rivers. At the

Szechwan 
The province of Szechwan is bordered by Hupeh, Shensi, Kansu, Tsinghai, Sikang, 
Yunnan, Kweiehow, and Hunan, nnd is part of lie. Southwest Administrative Region. It 
has an area of 117,200 square miles and a population of 48,091,400. According to an 
authoritative report of March 1952, it then had no provincial government, and was being 
adininistt?red by Districts, the North, East, West, and South, with District administrative 
headquarters at Nan-ch'ung, Wan-hsien, Chengtu and Lu-hsien respectively. Szechwan 
is practically isolated by mountains surrounding the fertile Red Basin. The average altitude 
of the province is over 9,500 feet, but it has many areas of depression below sea level, the 
largest occurring between the Min and To rivers. The only large level area is the alluvial 
fan around chengna The chief mountain ranges are the Min Shan in the northwest, the 
Ta-pa Shan or Wu Shan along the Ilupeh border, the Chiung-lai between the Min and 
Tutu rivers, and the Ta-hung Shan along the Sikang border. Four major rivers, the Min, 
To, Wu, and Kialing rivers, all of which empty into the Yangtze, traverse the province and 
give it its name which means "Four Rivers." The province, because of its topography, has 
a unique climate for its geographic pusition: the Ch'in Ling Mountains to the north bar the 
cold 'Mongolian air. The climate is consequently temperate, with scant snow or frost in 
winter_ nseeipitlition, abundant throughout the year, is at its maxiesere during the sum-
mer months, when some areas, particularly Chungking, are hot and humid. 
Agriculturally, Szechwan is one of China's richest provinces. The Chengtu Basin is 
capable of producing three crops annually. The leading crops are rice, wheat., cotton, beans, 
corn, sweet potatoes, and tole:re?. Szechwan produces the largest quantity of medicinal 
herbs in all China, and its silk production is exceeded only by that of Chekiang and Kiangsu. 
Tung oil, hog bristles, tea, and sugar are also produced in large quantities for export. Iron, 
coal, oil, and sulphur ?leposits are found in fair quantity, with sufficient production to make 
Szechwan one of the leading producers. Salt leads all other minerals, and the numerous salt 
wells at T411-lin-ching resemble a in oil field. The major industries are salt and 
sugar refining, but the chemical, metallurgical, textile, and oil industries, though smaller, 
arc thriving. Industrialization went forward rapidly during the latter nha.ses of World

War II, when the province became China's leading industrial him,. Its embroidery and 
porcelain products are well-known. 
Prior to 1952 there were no rail lines in the province, but the long planned Chengtu-
Chungking railway has now been completed. It is being extended north. There are about 
6,000 kilometers of highways, the. most impoztant being the Chengtu-Chungking, Szeeh-
,.wan-Shensi, Szechwan-Sikang, Szechwan-Kweichow, Szechwan-Yunnan and Szechwan-
Hunan highways. All the major rivers are navigable for steamships (the province's largest 
shipping firm, the Ming Sung Industrial Company, was once a ship-building firm). Air 
sei vice connects Chungking, Chengtu, Lo-shan, and Im-hsien with the rest of China.. 
The provincial capital of Chenegu (30? 40' N and 104? 4' E) is located in the richest 
agricultural area of the province. It has impressive scenery, and is a historical center of 
some importance, having been the capital of the Shu kingdom during the period of the Three 
Kingdoms. The population totalled 620,300 in 1948. The Special Municipality of Chung-
king (29? 34' N and 106? 35' E), China's wartime capital with a present population of 
985,700, is located at the confluence of the Yangtze and Kialing rivers. It is a commercial 
center for the surrounding provinces and the leading communications center of Szechwan 
itself. with major highways teas:new to the surrounding areas. Northeast of Chungking lies 
the Yangtze River Port of Wan-hsien (30' 19' N end 108' 24' E), a marketing (enter for 
tung oil, sugar, and hog bristles. Another marketing center in the south, mainly for trade 
with Yunnan, is I-pin (28? 46' N and 104' 34' E), which marks the upper hmit of steam 
navigation on the Yangtze. Lo-shan (knit ung) (2)? 34' N and 103? i 4' E) is another impor-
tant trade town located at the confluence of the Min and Tatu rivers in the southwest. The 
center of salt production is at Tzu-liu-ching (29- 25' N and 101?15' E) in the central part 
of the province, while its parallel center of sugar production is at Nei-'hiiang (29? 35' N and 
105? 3' E) on the Chengtu-Chungking highway. Northeast of Chengtu is the town of 
Kuan-hsien (31? 0' N and 103? 37' E), of considerable historic interest because of its 2,000-
year old irrigation system. The famous Chengtu plain irrigation system was initiated by 
Li Ping in the time of the Ch'in dynasty (221 to 207 inc.). This indicates that even at that 
early time Szechwan was an area of some importance to central China. The Ch'ing-ch'eng 
Shan, west of Kuarehsien, was reputedly one ofthe centers of early Taoism. 
After the fall of the Ilan dynasty, 1:-Izerhwan was for a time the center of the Kingdom 
of Shu, under the wise management of the able statesman Chu-ko Liting. It. was mainly 
the area's self-sufficiency that enabled Shu to %withstand the onslaught of the Wei for so 
long a time. Other important episodes in the history of Szechwan are: the flight of Thing 
Ming Huang to the province upon An Lu-shan's revolt ; the strangling of his favorite con-
cubine, Yang Kuei-fei, at Ma-wei; and the systematic massacre of the Szechwan population 
by the notorious bandit Chang Ilsien-chung epon the collapse of the Ming dynasty. flow-
ever, the influx of other provincials into Szechwan after the massacre during the Ch'ing 
dynasty soon restored its population to its previous level. 
Despite the fact that Szechwan is one of the richest provinces in China, the farmer's 
life there was not easy during the first decades of Republican China. The area MIS then 
the happy playground of war lords, some of whom taxed the farmers as much as sixty yearis 
M advance. Because it promised irmnedinte cash returns, poppy-planting was encouraged 
in favor of cereal cultivation, with the result that ninny people in Szechwan and Yunnan 
often took up the habit of opium-smoking. During the thirties, when Chiang's forces were 
engaged in liquidating the Communists in Kiangsi, two war lords, Liu Wen-hui and his 
uncle Liu Hsiang, fought each other for the control of Szechwan completely disregarding 
the welfare of its people. 17pon the outbreak of the Sino-.Japanese War, Chiang eliminated 
the war lords and Szechwan came under central authority.

During the war years, Chungking was famous as the wartime capital of China. How-
ever, its location and weather are far from ideal; it is overcrowded, it is humid, hot, and 
rainy through most of the year, and it has scant transportation and traffic facilities. Its 
great advantage as a wartime capital lay in the numerous mountain caves in and around the 
city, which provided natural air-raid shelters for the inhabitants. It became notorious, 
however, for its raze, yeleet grew in large numbers and had little fear of humans. Chung-
king, on the other hand, is not typical of Szechwan. Chengtu, for example, enjoys a 
temperate climate and has much more pleasant surroundings. 
Szechwan people are very clannish; the water-front coolies, for example, are efficiently 
organized in secret societies. The natives have bitterly resented the intrusion of large num-
bers of government personnel and businessmen from coastal provinces, especially enterpris-
ing folk from Shanghai. The native populace have continued to patronize their own shops, 
while the immigrants have established their own retail shops, restaurants, and banks, and 
were soon doing a larger volume of business than their native competitors. 
As in other humid provinces along the Yangtze, the natives take to hot food and pepper. 
A famoue hot condiment. used in the province is Ch'a Tsei, which adds a genuinely delicious 
flavor. The cuisine has a style of its own, and many foreigners find it quite delicious. 
Szechwane6.e: restaurants are popular in Shanghai and Peking. 
Szechwan has many picturesque mountains. The 0-mei Mountain has been famous 
as the sacred home of Buddhist monks and Taoists, the Yangtze Gorges equally so for their 
weird scenery. The monkeys on the cliffs of Wu Ch'a have been celebrated in verse by 
Li Po. The Red Basin is entirely inhabited by the Chinese, but there are Lobos in south-
weetern Szechwan and Nliaos in the areas close to Kweichow. Many Chinese have gone 
to live among the aborigines and have since followed their customs. 
Szechwan has produced many men of letters: the Han Confucianist and writer Yang 
lisiung; Ch'tTh Shou, chronicler of the official History of the Three Kingdoms; the rang poet 
Li Po; the Sung poet, prose-writer, painter, calligrapher, Su Tung-p'o; and his slightly less 
famous brother and father, Su TO and Su Ilsien. The Han poet Ssit-ma Hsiang-ju was a 
native of Szechwan; himself an impoverished scholar, he courted the rich widow Cho W&I-
chtin. Their romance was celebrated in China, and Cho Wen-chtin was considered one of 
China's beauties. Modern Chinese writers from Szechwan, like Kuo Mo-jo and Pa Chin, 
are noted for their emotional intensity. 
Chang Ch'un is an important Kuomintang official, and Chang Ta-chien a noted painter 
from Szechwan. 
Chu Telt came from Szechwan, and the province can point to some prominent Com-
munist generals as its sons. Liu Po-ch'eng, "the one-eyed dragon," is the Commander of 
the Second Field Army; Ch'en I was formerly Commander of the Third Field Army and 
Mayor of Shanghai. 
Taiwan (Formosa) 
Taiwan (Formosa) includes the island proper, 16 nearly islands, and the 64 islands of 
the P'eng-hu or Pescadores group. All these are still under the National Government of 
China. Upon their return to China by Japan in 1945, the islands gained provincial status 
under Chiang Kai-shek's government. Under the Communists, they would presumably 
become a province and fall within the East China Administrative Region. 
Taiwan Island has an area of 13,881 square miles (it is 249 miles in length an-21 93 miles 
in width) and a population well in excess of 8,000,000. It is located 93 miles from the Fukien 
Coast and has a coastline 1,062 miles in length.

One-third of Taiwan is mountainous, the remainder being "plain." The Tai-wan or 
Central Mountain Renee runs roughly north and south through the eastern part of the 
island. The mountainous eastern section also contains the rei-tung and Fan-ehieh-ling 
ranges. Most of the rivers are found in the plain area in the west, the largest being' the 
Dakusui or Choshui River. Their swift currents make them highly suitable for water-
power development. There are only two natural lakes on the island. One of these is an 
irrigation reservoir at Kanden (Kwanden) west of Mato City. The Sun Moon Lake or 
Jitsugetsteean (Lake Candidius) is the more important, because it supplies the power for 
major hydroelectric installations. It is located north of Dakusui at the approximate 
geographic center of the island. 
The island is located in the tropical zone, but benefits from oceanic winds. The sum-
mers are long, with abundant precipitation. AVerage annual precipitation totals 98 inches, 
but varies from -10 inches along the coast to 289 inches in the mountains. The temperature 
ranges from 100?F to 33?F with an average temperature of 71?F at Teipeh and 80?F at 
Kao-hsiung. The island lies in the typhoon belt, and is particularly threatened during the 
months from May to October. It also lies within the earthquake zone: quakes average 
almoz.4. one per day, but nearly all are weak and insignificant. 
Chiefly an agricultural area, tlie island prealuces mainly sugar cane, rice, tea, potatoes, 
peanuts, wheat, barley, sesame, jute, longans, vegetables, and fruits. The first three crops 
mentioned are the most important and are produced mainly in the south, central, and 
northern areas respectively. Export products are cane sugar, rice tea, menthol, and cam-
phor, of which Taiwan supplies three-fourths of the world's supply. There tire three rice 
crops annually. 
Mineral resources are varied but limited; they inelude gold, silver, copper, mercury, 
and sulphur. Taiwan is the leading copper producer in all China. There are large coal 
deposits in the north and salt evaporating centers along the west coast.. Petroleum pro-
duction is being expanded, and Taiwan is already the third-largest producer of all Chinese 
provinces. The island is highly industrialized, with over 9,500 factories including textile, 
lumber end ceramic mills, and chemical, metal, and machine-tool plants. Cotton piece 
goods, flour, fertilizer, and kerosene are the major exports of these industries. By far the 
greatest resource, however, is hydroelectric power. The economy of Taiwan reflects the 
planning under past Japanese rule, which made the island one of the most efficiently 
exploited colonial areas. 
There are about 2,2C0 miles of railways, most of which have had to be repaired due to 
damage during the last war. The major rail line rune from Chi-lung (Keelung) in the north 
through the western plain to Kao-hsiung and Tung-chiang (floko) in the south, with branch 
lines extending cast and west at various points. A single iine from Tai-tung to Chi-lung 
links the east coast to this major railroad. There is an equal mileage of highways, which 
generally accompany the railroads. A crude but important highway runs along the cliffs on 
the east coast. Push-car lines penetrate the inaccessible areas, but the final resort is the 
native trails, which are often the only means of transportation in the mountain areas. The 
swift currents that make the rivers potential sources of hydroelectric power make them, by 
the same token unsuitable for navigation. External rommunicat inn is via air and oceanic 
navigation. Chi-lung in the north and Kau-I:slung in the south are the two major ports, 
with the latter playing a major commercial role in Southeast Asia trade. 
The provisional capital of the Nationalist government and proposed provincial capital 
under the Communists is 'Faipeh (25? 3' N and 121? ;30 F.) known :1..5 TiiihOkt1 under 
Japanese occupation. It is the political, economic, and cultural centcr of the province, and 
the center of the tea production. The 1910 population of 362,407 has now incrmsed to

estimated 5M000. A major commercial port and former naval base (during the Japanese 
occupation) is the northern port of ChieJung or Kiirun (2508' N and 1210 44' E). Surround-
ing it is a rich agricultural p,/ea, with Coal reserves suitable for steamers. Trans-shipment 
of goods is hampered by excessive rain storms. The population is estimated at 145,000_ 
Kao-hsiung (22? 38' N and 1200 17' E), formerly known as Takao, is the chief port in the 
south. Its thief advantage over Chi-lung is the limited precipitation in the area, which 
makes it easier to handle such products as chemicals, salt, and sugar. It is the chief export 
port and in 1950 handled almost twice the tonnage that passed through Chi-le:rig. It is the 
center of the cement, sugar, iron, steel, and ship-building industries (population: 275,000). 
T'ai-chung (Taichu) (24? 8' N and 1200 40' E) is the marketing center and leading agri-
cultural town for the T'ai-chung Plain, in the geographic center of which it is located. Its 
population is estimated at 207,000. The oldest city on the island is Hsin-chu (Shinchiku) 
(240 28' N and 120? 5:14' E), a highly developed industrial and agricultural center with a 
population of 165,000. On the east coast supported by the surrounding agricultural, forest, 
and mining industries is the city of Ilua-lien (23? 59' N and 121? 36' E), known under 
Japanese rule as Karenko. T'ai-nan (23? 0' N and 120? 12' E), on the west coast, has a 
population of 229,000 and is a city full of historical interest, having been the ancient capital 
of the island. 
Taiwan became a part of China during the Yuan dynasty. Although the administra-
tion ceased to function temporarily after the downfall of the Yuan dynasty, it was reestab-
lished in 1-105, when the Ming eunuch, Cheng Ho, began his adventures in the South Seas. 
Large number of Chinese from Fukien and Kwangtung began to teigrate to Taiwan in the 
seventeenth century, and as early as the Sul dynasty (581-618) some Chinese had already 
moved to the island. 
Portuguese sailors first went to Taiwan in 1383 and called it "Ilha Formosa," meaning 
"Isle Beautiful." At the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Dutch and Spanish 
tried to establish themselves there, and held on until 1661-62, when they were driven out by 
Cheng Ch'eng-kung and his band. The latter remained loyal to the fallen Ming dynasty, 
and used Taiwan as a base for art attack on the mainland. Cheng Ch'eng-kung died in the 
prime of his life, but his son maintained a precarious hold over it until the island was con-
quered by the Manchus in 1683. Under two hundred years of Manchu rule many Cantonese 
and Fukien folk from around Amoy emigrated to Taiwan. This emigration ceased when the 
island was ceded to Japan after China's shameful defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War in 
1895. Upon the defeat of japan in World War II, Taiwan was returned to China. 
The large-scale Chinese immigration forced the aborigines into the mountainous 
regione. There are seven major tribes, who account for some 150,000 out of a total popula-
tion of over 7,600,000. They are tattooed, have had little contact with Chinese culture, 
and still practice such customs as head-hunting. Even aborigines who live among the 
Chinese still cling to their nutive customs. They engage in agriculture in the mountain 
districts and, on the whole, are harmless. The Japanese population in Taiwan, even during 
the occupation, as small, though its members naturally filled all the positions of leadership 
in government and industry. For all that it suppressed native leadership and discouraged 
higher learning for the Formosans, Japan did an exeellent colonial job there. industrializing 
Taiwan and giving it a compulsory primary education (China proper has never had com-
pulsory primary education). When the Chinese government took over Taiwan, it found 
most of the population to be bilingual (Japanese and Chirmsr). After the liberatien, most 
Taiwan people learned to speak .landarin. 
The Japanese also inculcated habits of personal cleanliness, so that the Formosans 
make a point of taking baths rather frequently. They are cheerful end courteous, though

the men are sometimes inclined to self-protective sullenness and mistrust, Untouched as 
they are by the restrictive influence of Confucian morality, the women are gay-hearted and 
uninhibited; they are industrious workers and make good wives. Because of the strong 
sugar element in heir diet and the prevalence of mosquitoes. their beauty is often marred 
by gold-tilled teeth and mosquito-bitten legs. Before the liberation, the men wore shabby 
clothes, us-nally only shirts and pants, -and the women wore skirts and blouses of loud colors. 
Now the Taaran women imitate the women on the mainland, and take to Ch'i-pao and 
leather shoes. With the influx of Chinese, new housing projects are replacing theefragile 
hut pretty Japanese-styled structures with straw-filled tatami floors. Because of the 
intensive effort at national defense and ever-constant apprehension about a Communist 
attack, the restaurants, bars, and picnic resorts in Taipeh are no longer as gay as they 
used to be. 
Except during the typhoon se:teems; the coastal cities of Taiwan enjoy good rainfall and 
sunshine and are pleasant places in which to live. It is an extremely rich province, though 
the mountain ridges in the center and east of the island occupy much valuable space. Fruits 
are abundant : oranges, bananzts, pineapples, and watermelons are sold during every season 
of the year. The native population takes to sea food, but the cuisine in most of the res. 
tauran Is does not compare with Chinese coastal city food. Rice is the staple cereal. Many 
picturesque Chinese customs regarding the New Year, burial, and worship have been 
preserved. 
Production has now surpassed the pre-war record of the Japanese. The Formosan 
people enjoy equitable represent at ion in provincial and national government. There is 
some reason to believe that the mutual (list rust told antagonism between the native popula-
tion and the Chinese from the mainland is diminishing. 
No Formosan has yet been entrusted with a position of prominence in the National 
government. A conspicuous member of the CCP is the Tniwati woman Ilstieh 
who in her younger days was a bound servant and coneuhitic. She now represents Formosan 
interests in the Communist government. 
Tsinghai 
The province of Tsinghai is in the Northwest Administrative Region and is bordered 
by Kansu, Sinkiang, Tibet, Sikang, and Szechwan. It has an area of 257,600 square miles 
and a population of 1,123,200. Geographically, it is part of the Tibetan Plateau, and is a 
mountainous area except for the Tsaidam Basin in the north and the (h'ing Hai I Koko

(ra-erh-ssu) (36' 31' N and 101? 37' E) is the location of a famous lamasery with over three 
thousand Lama priests. An important communication and trading town is Yii-shu (330 I' N 
and 96 52' E) in the south, it being the terminus of the highway to Sikang. 
Tsinghai was made a province in 19'29. It is populated by Tibetens, Mohammedans, 
Mongols, Chinese, and aboriginal tribes. At present, the Mongols inhabit the northern 
border; the Tibetans the southern border; the Chinese and Moslems the cities near the 
provincial capital, Sining. It would be interesting to trace the history of each race in this 
district. Suffice it to say that Tsinghai was once the home of fierce barbaric tribes, variously 
knew!! as Si '1 ung or Si Hsia.and ,-as a constant nuisance to the Chinese during the Han, 
'clang, and Sung dynasties. After the conversion of Tibetans to Lamaism, the Tibetan 
culture and religion permeated Tsinghai (ae noted, Tsinghai forms a part of the Tibetan 
Plateau). During the Sung dynasty, the Mongols began to come down in search of pasture 
for their horses and cattle. During the Ytian dynasty, the Moslems began to increase their 
influence in the area. In numbers the Tibetans and Mongols exceed the Moslems, but the 
Moslsms are definitely superior in political influence. They are a more dynamic people, and 
it With no accident that the Nationalist Government appointea the Mohammedan Ma Pu-
fang governor of Tsinghai. The Moslems there speak the Chinese language. 
The early years of the Ch'ing dynasty were a remarkable period of Chinese colonization 
and expansion. During the reign of Yung Cheng, the militant generale, Nien li&ig-yao and 
Yo Chung-ehi conquered Tsinglini; Yo Chung-chi went further into Tibet, and exacted 
obedience from the Tibetans and the aborigines. 
The Tibetans and Mongols wear fur clothing most of the year. Their habits as regards 
personal cleanliness leave non h to be desired. There is great freedom among them, regard-
ing marriage and sex. The Moslems, by contrast with the Mongols and Tibetans are clean 
and vigorous, and their sexual morals are strict. They are fiercely nationalist, and have 
rebelled several times during the last few decades. In f928, after a relative of his was 
executed at Lan-chou by rtnig Yu-hsiang, an 18-year-old Moslem lad, Ma Chung-ying, 
raised the standard of Moslem revolt in Sining. 'Fhb revolt spread to many Moslem 
provinces before it was finally quelled. Because they are nationalist the Moslems are 
fiercely anti-Communist, but since the general collapse of the Kuomintang, their leaders 
have not been able to hold out against the lied tide. In the past decade, relations between 
the Chinese and the Moslems have been happy. The last Tsinghai governor, Ma Pte-fang, 
was nominally subject to Nationalist authority but exercised unchallenged authority in the 
province Under him the province made notable progress on the social, political, and eco-
nomic fronts. The Moslem leaders in the Tsinghai-Ningsia-Kansu region are Hochow Ma's. 
The climate of Tsinghai is continental, and is noted for its violent transitions of hot 
and cold. t proverb has it that only during the months of July, August, and September, 
is the traveller relatively unhampered by the weather. Because of the many tribes repre-
sented in the province, sharp differences in marriage and  burial engin rig eiar.a.t

Yunnan 
This province is in the Southwest Administrative Region and is bordered by Kwangai, 
Kweichow, Szechwan, Sikang, Burma, and Indo-China. It has an area of 162,300 aluare 
miles and a population of 9,284,600. Yunnan is It part of the Yunnan-Nstveichow Plateau, 
and has an average altitude of 5,000 meters. It is broken by small plains in the east. The 
Kao-1i-kung Shan, Nu Shan and Viin-ling Shan are the three major ranges, all originating in 
Sikang Province. The Yangtze, Mekong, and Salween rivers enter from Sikang and pass 
through Yunnan. Arming the few lakes in the province, the Tien on the outskirts 
of the provincial capital, is the largest. The clirr.ate is subtropical, hut mild and comfort-
able due to the influence of altitude. Seasonal ehanges are not great and precipitation, 
half of which is in July and August, averages 42 itnlies annually. Kunming has a particu-
larly attractive climate, with a temperature range of 29? F to 90? P. Western Yunnan has 
suffered severely from earthquakes. 
Since only 5 to 10 pers-ent of the province is level land, potential cultivation is limited. 
Rice, wheat, barley, and cotton are the chief crops, with tea, silk, and medicinal herbs 
produced for export. Only one summer crop of rice is produced, despite a growing season of 
325 days. Two-fifths of the fields raise a %vim er crop. Ns with S?echwan, where trn.ntIrtft,-. 
tion costs make a compact, high-priced commodity desirable, Yunnan has Ireen a high 
producer of opium. 
The province is extremely rich in mineral deposits, particularly copper and in. Tin 
production, the leading industry in the province, is (-entered at ho-chiu, and is the largest 
in all China. In copper production the province ranks a pair third after Taiwan and'Alan-
churl& Coal and iron are produced in fair quantities, slid gold, silver, and iron deposits 
have been reported. Kunming is the industrial center. it was developed for the most part 
via the transfer of coastal factories during the war, tall in view of OW high transportation 
costs to and from the city it is a matter of conjecture how many of these factories have 
stayed on. 
The Yunnan-Indo-China railroad is the chief line in the province, connecting Kun-
ming with the Indo-Chinese rail system. A short ';ne, the Pi-se-chai-Ko-chiu, joins it in 
the south. A major line has been planned to connect the province with Burma in the south 
and with Kweichow and Szechwan in the northeast. The Nuinning-Ch'it-ching section is 
reported finished, and the rest under construction. Highways total I ,5(X) k ilometera, the 
most important being the Burrna or Stilwell Road, which was China's last hind Well, le Of 
supply during World War II. The rivers are almost unnavigable due to the swift currents. 
Another wartime development, (Inc to the air-ferrying of vital war supplies, was the estab-
lishment of Kunming as an important air terminus. 
The provincial capital and the political, communications. and commercial venter of the 
province is Kunming (25?4' N and 102? 41' El, which has a population of 255,500. Goods 
marketed here are copper, tin, silk, tea, and Yunnan ham. The tin center of No-chin

chu government was hazy about what constituted the precise Yunnan frontier, the French 
and still more the British took advantage of the fares and appropriated areas of Yunnan, the 
British government actually sending troops to occupy the northwestern frontier up as far 
as Pien-ma. At present, the area of Yeh-jen Shan and Chiang lIsin P'o is legally still Chinese, 
though in actual fact most of it has long been occupied by Burmese. In maps made in other 
countries, as compared to those made in China, one immediately notices the reduced terri-
tory along the Western border. As a result of the abatement of British and French impe-
rialiern after World War II, Yunnan now has more secure borders. When the Nationalist 
Government moved to western China after 1937, Yunnan suddenly became important as 
the only communications ceistea through which western munitions and goods could be 
transported to China. The Burma Road became justly famous. 
Yunnan is beautiful country, with a subtropical climate and good rainfall; its capital, 
Funming, perhaps enjoys the best climate in all China. It was an important province even 
during the Ch'ing dynasty, because of its invaluable deposits of copper, marble, and tin. 
All (Una's coins used to be minted there. 
Yunnan is inhabited by many races. Among the aborigines Shans and Lobos predomi-
nate. The Shuns are akin to the nation of tribes along the Yunuan-Burma border. The 
Lobs live mainly in the remote mountain districts, along the Yunnan-Sikang border, and 
number about 1,500,000. They are a nomadic people, very brave and warlike. They lead 
a Spartan life and are trained to fight from childhood. They have a blinding passion for 
blood feude, which they pursue endlessly from one generation to another. There are three 
distinct classes of Lobos: the "Blairk Bones," who constitute the pure-blood nobility; the 
"White Bones," who are enfranchised descendants of Chinese slaves; and the Wa tzu, or 
newly-enslaved Chinese. The "Black Bones" spend much of their time raiding distant 
Chinese communities and carrying off men and women to serve them as slaves. Women 
hold an exalted position among the Lobos. 
Yunnan has also been the most important Moslem stronghold outside the North-
western provinces. The Moslem settlers were cruelly oppressed under the rule of Manchu 
viceroys. During the rai-p'ing Rebellion they took advantage of Peking's preoccupation 
with the Yangtze rebels to stage their own uprising in Yunnan. This rebellion lasted from 
1S51 to 1873, and cost millions of lives. 
Yunnan was famous for the 1915 uprising against Yuan Shih-k'ai, led by Ts'ai 0. 
From 1913 to 1027 it was governed by the ambitious T'ang Chi-yao, and for the next eighteen 
years (1027-1945) was under the power of another irresponsible war lord: Lung Yuri, a 
native of 'Yunnan. I?nder their reign, the people's life was hard and poppy-growing became 
widespread. It 'vas estimated in 1923 that it accounted for two-thirds of the cultivated 
land during the winter season, and that 00 percent of the men and 60 percent of the women 
in Kunming were opium addicts. Only when the Nationalist Government m( ed into 
the interior did the central authority reach the province. Lung Yiin was then replaced by 
another native of Yunnan, Lu Ban. 
The retreat of many higher institutes of learning into Kunming, especially the South-
west ('ernhietei reh,ereity (eon:prising Tsinghua, National Peking, and Nankai Uni-
versities), had a beneficial effect upon the culture of the province. The Chinese in Yunnan 
speak a readily intelligible 'Mandarin. 
Yunnan has not produeed many eminent men. Its most remarkable son, perhaps, was 
the Mohammedan eunuch Chi'ng Ito. who served under the enterprising Ming Emperor 
Tsu and equipped with fleets and men, made several expeditions into the South 
Seas. If such expedit ions had been continued, China would have emerged as a sea power and 
might have as oided the disasters resulting from the isolationist policy of the Ch'ing 
emperors.

The Yunnan diet suffers from the scarcity of salt and iodine. Many of its inhabitants, 
in consequence, are afflicted with goitre. 
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region 
Inner Mongolia is one of the two so-called autonomous regions created by the Com-
munist Government of China. It is bordered by lieilungkiang, Russia, Outer Mongolia, 
Suiyuan, Chahar, Jehol, Liatesi, and Kirin. The reference of the tin-in Inner Mongolia is 
less geographical than political, since the newly organized Autonomous Region excludes the 
old provinces south of Outer Mongolia, which are geographically part of Inner Mongolia. 
A better name perhaps would have been "West Manchuria." The region includes the fol-
lowing Manchurian areas: all of llsingan Province, most of Chahar and Liaopeh, and a large 
portion of Jehol (as these provinces were constituted under the Nationalist Government). 
Exact statistical information is lacking, but the total area is almost equal to that of the 
entire 'Northeast Administrative Region, which totals 343,600 square miles. The popula-
tion is by another rough estimate somewhat less than 2,300,000, A s of March 1952 there 
was no formal administrative organization in the region; instead administration of the 
region was directed from nearby Wanchuan (Ealgan), the capital of Chahar Province. 
The Ta-hsing-an Range, which begins in the south bet ween Chahar and _Mint, the 
chief mountain range in the region. It crosses the entire region up to the northern border. 
Its extension along the northern border into ileilungkiang Province is known as the 1-1i-hu-li 
or Ilsiao-hsing-an Range. The Yin Shan Fes farther south; it reaches out from Suiyuan 
Province and forms slopes and small basins within Inner Mongolia. Two major rivers in 
the Region constitute parts of the national as a ell as the provincial boundaries. The Argun 
River in the west forms part of the national boundary wit). Russia, while the Nonni River 
in the east forms part of the provincial boundary with Ileilinigkiang. The Ilailar River 
runs through the northcentrid area from the Soviet border to fleilungkiang Province, and 
is parallelled by an important rail line. The Liao River with its tributaries lies in the south-
east, and flows into Lia.osi Province, The northern half of the region has the most unfavor-
able climate in northeast China, being bitterly cold and arid much of the time. The tempera-
ture ranges from ?40?F' to 96?F, with extreme in the mountain ranges. Annual precipita-
tion amounts to about 11 inches annually. The southern half is similarly unfavorable, 
because of the cold winds from Siberia. The area projecting into the southeast, adjacent. 
to Liaosi Province, has the best climate but even it is subject to the extreme cold emanating 
from the north. 
Agriculture in the north is limited to the small quantities of corn, millet, wheat, and 
potatoes grown on the western slopes of the Ta-hsing-an Range. Grazing is more important: 
cattle, horses, and sheep are found in large numbers, tended mainly by Mongols. The 
southeast area produces soybeans, fur, wool, and timber, in addition to the aforementioned 
crops. The leading mineral resources are coal, salt, and gold. Coal production is centered 
at Cha-lai-no-erh, along the Ch'ang-ch'un rail line close to the Soviet border. The pro-
duct ion, based on large reserves, serves the railroad and helps supply Ileilungkiang Province. 
There are a few gold mines in the north, but in general gold deposits are undeveloped. A 
good salt supply is obtained from the various salt lakes in the ree:?n, particularly in the 
west. Timber is an important resource, the tirni?.1-1.,-,d. of the l'a_hing_5.F., 
the largest in all China. 
There are only three rail lines in Inner Mongolia. Tlw longest is the western section 
of the (Wang-411'1in, which is linked with the Soviet system in the northwest, at the border 
town of 1,u-pin (N1an-chou-10. It follows the course of the Hadar River, and enters lleilung-

its a focal point for roads leading to Russia arid Outer Mongolia M the north. The southern 
focal point, for roads leading .to Russia and outer Mongolia in the north. The southern 
portion also has a few roads leading to Outer Mongolia and adjacent Chinese provinces. 
Old trade routes also connect the region with Russia and Outer Mongolia. The Argun River 
is navigable by small craft, but its length diminishes its value as a route of transportation. 
Wu-lan-hao-Ce (Wang-yell-111nm) (460 5' N and 122? E) was originally selected as 
the capital of this autonomous region. leis located in the east central area, and is an impor-
tant communications center on the railway running from T'ao-an in Heilungkiang to Wen-
chlian in the west. I lai-la-erh (Hadar) (49? 13' N and 1190 44' E) was the former capital 
of Ilsingan Province. It is an important communications center on the western Ch'ang-
chlun rail line, and a trading center for cattle, sheep, and animal products. To-lun (42? 
10' N and 116? 25' F.;) is a communications and trading town in the southeast, near Jehol, 
which specializes in furs, wool, animals, rugs, carpets, and timber. The border town of 
Lu-pin (49? 36' N and 117' 27' E) is the terminus of the Ch'ang-ch'un line and its junction 
with the Russian rail aystem. It ale? serves, as a trading couter for Russia and Outer Mon-

Tibet Autonomous Region 
The so-called autonomous region of Tibet is a frontier region of far southwest China, 
bordered by Sikang, Tsinghai, Sinkiang, India, Nepal, and Bhutan. Its borders like those 
of Yunnan, have never been completely defined, but Chinese sources claim an area of 
-169,-100 square miles and a population of 1,500,000. The region is a high plateau with an 
average altitude of 4,500 meters for the plains area and 5,500 meters for the mountainous 
areas. The Himalaya Range forms the southern boundary with India and Nepal. Parallel 
to and north of this is the Trans-Ilimalaya Range. Other major ranges are the Karakorum, 
extending into eastern Tibet from Kashmir in India, and the Klunlun Range, across the 
northern boundary of the region. The headwaters of several major rivers, including those 
of the Indus, the Ganges, and the 13rahmaputra (or Tsan-po as it is called in Tibet), are 
found in this region. The most important is the Tsangpo, which flows across the southern 
part of the region into Sikang Province in the east before turning south into India. There 
are numerous lakes, most of which are salty; there are also extensive areas of salt and alkali 
surface crust. The Chang Tang (or Chang Thang) Plateau in the north covers a large area. 
The Tsangpo Valley in the south, through which the river flows, is the most densely popu-
lated area. 
The climate is distinctly continental, with sharn temperature changes due to radiation, 
isolation, aridity, and altitude. Temperatures range from ?40?F to 90?F, with intensely 
cold winds during winter. Precipitation is limited to the Tsangpo Valley, the Himalayas 
serving to block off most of the moisture-laden monsoon winds coming from the south. The 
Chang Tang Plateau is too cold and dry for vegetation. 
Barley, tea, wheat, and beans are cultivated in the southeast valley area, but the frosts 
there are severe. The northern area sustains a limited pastoral economy based on yak, 
sheep, wool, furs. and hides. Tibet is reported to have substantial deposits of gold, silver, 
copper, iron, petroleum, coal, and salt. but., except for gold and salt, which are produced in 
small amounts, these resources have yet to he exploited. Lhasa, though still dependent on 
11 
? 
primitive Meitii8 and old trade routes, is the hub of the transportation system. Two routes 
lead last to China, and a third goes west to India. A few additional routes cross the Ilima-
layas to India, the most important of thesebeing that which links Vat wig and Gyangtse in 
Tibet to Darjeeling, terminus of the Indian railroad system. 
Lhasa (29' 33' N and 910 1r F,) is the capitai and Holy City of the Tibet Autonomous 
Region. The religious, politieal, and vommtinicat ions center of the entire regime it has a 
population of about 60,000. The Potala, the palace of the politically powerful Dalai Lama, 
is located there, and is a magnificent architectural achievement. The traditional spiritual 
counterpart of the Dalai Lama is the Panchen Lama, who resides at Trashi-lhtimpo, Tibet's 
second largest city (population : 20,0tX)n Gyangtse (28? 57' N and 80? 36' E) is an important 
trading town south of the Tsangpo River near the southern border. It is connected with 
the bordertown of Vat ung (27? 26' N and 88? 53' El from which primitive trails link Tit 
to the Indian rail system at Darjeeling. Near Gyringtse nu the Tsangpo River is the trading 
town of Shigatse (Zhikatse) (29? 15' N and 88? 531 E). Another important center for trade 
with India is Gartok (31? 45' N and 80? 20' E), on the Main West Road on the upper Indus 
River in the west. 
The Tibetan Plateau is the most elevated extensive region on earth inhabited by man.

novels as The Lost 110riZOIL Barely does an Occidental traveler go there without writing 
an art:cle or book about it. With its inclement climate and rarefied atmosphere, Tibet., 
however, is hardly an ideal place for a retreat. And despite the accumulated wealth in the 
gold-topped lamaseries, the people for the most part live in poor and unsanitary conditions. 
Its height and inaccessibility, however, has thus far saved Tibet from becoming the Seetle 
of bloody strife, though it has been a center of political intrigue, what with British, Indian 
and Russian interests vying with each other and disputing China's claim to it. 
The political history of Tibet goes back some two thousand years. Tibetan warrior 
tribes raided the frontiers of the Chinese Han Empire from the first century p.c. By the 
seventh century A.D., Tibet had become a powerful military state under the kingship of 
Songsten Campo, with whose reign Tibetan civilization dawns. lie made repeated raids 
on Chinese territory. To blunt his conquering ambitions the great. T'ang Emperor, Li 
Shih-min, sent a kinswoman, the capable princess Wen-chkg, to become his bride. Aided 
by the king's Nepalese consort, like herself a Buddhist, Wen-chhig converted Songsten 
Gampo to Buddhism, and persuaded him to use his influence to spread its pacifying prin-
ciples among his warrior people. Buddhist scriptures %ere brought in from India, and a 
Tibetan written language was invented from an alphabet taken from the Sanskrit.. Thus 
began the peculiar Buddhist culture of Tibet. The warlike Mongols, who became so power-
ful under their great leaders Genghis Khan and ltiublai Khan, were also later infected with 
Lamaism, and lost mueh of their original aggressiveness. Since the Yuan dynasty, Tibet 
has been nominally a part of Chinese territory, though actual political and military inter-
ventions by Chinese in that region were rare. 
Tibet is still nominally ruled by the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, the topmost 
ecclesiarchs in Lamaism, usually distinguished as; respectively, the temporal and spiritual 
leaders of Tibet. As the head of the State, Dalai has greater political power. Formerly, 
when the Tibetans were completely under their sway, China's and Britain's diplomacy 
usually centered on securing the good will of the Lamas. During the thirties, while the 
British e?ere feasting the Dalai Lama in India, the Panchen Lama was enjoying the good 
life in Peking, Shanghai, and Nanking. When the present Dalai Lama escaped to India 
upon the imminent Communist conquest of Tibet, the Panchen Lama became the hostage

of the Chinese Communists, and this obliged the Dalai Lama to -return from India. The 
election of the Lama is based on belief in the transmigration of the soul of the dying Laina 
to the body of an infant. Hence most Lamas have been juniors under the power of ruling 
cliques. Under the treaty signed with the Chinese Communists in 1941 the Dalai Lama was 
guaranteed tenure of all his previous powers. In fact, however, the Communists have taken 
Tibet over completely, and. it has become virtually another Chinese province. Communist 
military development there has caused some nervousness in India. 
The combination of temperature extremes, inhospitable terrain, and serious deficiencies 
in both food and fuel are reflected ;.n a low population density (about five or six persons per 
square mile). Where the land can be cultivated, the sedentary Tibetans cluster in farm-
villages surrounded by community fields. Most Tibetans, however, are members of 
nomadic tribes that live in tents and move from grass to grass with their herds of sheep, 
goats, yaks, and horses. A man's wealth is measured by his livestock. The most important 
animal to the Tibetan is the yak: he not only uses it as a beast of burden, but eats its meat, 
drinks its milk, burns its dung for fuel, and makes ropes and cloth for his tent from its long 
hair. The hide is used to build a coracle to ferry goods and passengers across the large 
rivers. 
The staple diet in Tibet is boiled mutton or yak's meat and tsamba (parched barley. 
flour). The Tibetan starts his meal as follows: a chunk of Chinese brick tea is tossed into a 
kettle of boiling water. The bowl of scalding tea is flavored with a pinch of salt and a lump 
of yak butter. After a number of bowls of buttered tea are consumed, a handful of tsamba 
is placed in a bowl half-filled with tea and kneaded with a circular movement of the fingers. 
The dough-like preparation is then eaten. The Tibetan occasionally varies his meal with 
the meat of domestic animals and game. The habit of drinking buttered salted tea is also 
universal among the Mongols. 
Men and women wear substantially the same garment. For warmer temperatures this 
is usually made of palu, a coarse homespun of wool, in varied colors. For colder weather a 
sheepskin cloak is worn, with the wool on the inside. The women's hairdress is very elabo-
rate. In some parts, the hair is commonly done up in 108 braids, with the ends attached 
to a rectangle of heavy cloth extending to the heels. This is richly studded with ornaments 
of silver, coral, amber, and gold nuggets. 
The Tibetan is frank, fun-loving, and almost completely uninhibited. Sexual habits 
are free and women enjoy a high social position. Marriage is an economic rather than a 
romantic or religious institution. Polyandry is commonly practiced, the plural husbands 
usually being brotherr. Should the polyandrous family prosper, more wives may be added. 
Each wife and husband are then shared by every other wife and husband. . 
The woman, however, is inferior in matters concerning religion. At least half of the 
male population enter lanaaaeries in boyhood. The child is thereby assured a good educa-
tion, a high social position, and a permanent livelihood. Except for Lhasa, the Tibetan 
capital, and a relatively few trading posts, the lamaseries are the principal centers of settled 
activity for the entire Tibetan Plateau. Many have several thousand lamas in permanent 
residence and exercise temporal as well as spiritual power over large regions, from which 
taxes arc exacted in the form of gifts. Some of the bigger lamaseries are famous for their 
architecture and their lavish use of gold to embellish their rooftops and giant idols. 
When a Tibetan dies his corpse is taken to a clearing or hollow in the hills to be devoured 
by vultures. After the bones are picked clean, they are pounded to a pulp and buried. 
This custom sterns from the Tibetan's belief that this life is but a penance for misdeeds and 
shortcomings in earlier lives. The liberation of the imprisoned spirit must await the 
destruction of the body.

SUPPLEMENTAL 
Manchuria: Historical and Sociological 
What is known n the West as Manchuria is usually referred to by the Chinese as the 
Northeastern Provinces or simply Tung-pci (the Northeast). Although originally the home 
of the Manchu peoples, the population is almost entirely Chinese. In fact, almost nothing 
remains of the old Manchu culture, and those of NIanchu blood have adopted the langaage 
and culture of the Chinese. The Manchus arc decidedly a minority and are hardly differen-
tiated from the Chinese. 
Mar ,:huria used to consist of three provinces: Liaoning, Kirin, and Heilungkiang. 
Later the Manchukuo government remapped the area, making nineteen provincial units. 
After the war, the Nationalist Government divided Liaoning, Kirin, and Ileilungkiang into 
nine provinces. Today, in the Communist set-up, Manchuria consists of six provinces and 
a large Inner Mongolia. Autonomous Area. 
Nlanehuria was once known as ',wan tea i because it is separated from China Proper by 
the Great Wall. The latter, however, was not so much a cause as a symbol of the division 
between the Chinese and the peoples beyond the Wail. 
Historically, the original home of the Manchus was in the valleys of the Sungari and 
Mutan rivers. They were closely related to the -Turchens, who moved into the Liao Penin-
sula and actively harassed China during the Northern Sung dynasty. Finally the Jurchens 
took possession of North China and established the Chin (Gold) dynasty. This dynasty' 
was parallel to the Southern Sung dynasty and came to an end in 1234, when it was over-
come by the Mongols under Kublai Khan. 
Four hundred years later, a number of descendant tribes of the Jurchens were welded 
tc.get her into a powerful fighting force by Nurhachu (1559-1626), who took control of the 
whole of Manchuria and set up his capital at Mukden. The Mings were in difficulties at 
the time, and the Milig general Wu San-kuei asked the Manchus to help save the tottering 
Ming Empire from the bandits. They thus came inside the Great Wall; and Emperor Shun 
Chih, Nurhachu's grandson, established the Ch'ing dynasty on Chinese soil in Peking in 
1644. 
Realizing that they owed their success to their fighting ability, the Manchus at first 
rigidly safeguarded their soldiers against falling prey to the temptations of Chinese culture. 
They also deliberately discouraged Chinese immigration into Manchuria, in the hope that 
this region of their ancestors might remain a reservoir of strength from which stalwart 
fighting men could be recruited. But the first. Ch'ing emperors, especially Ch'ien Lung, were 
lovers of Chinese culture; and the Manchus in China were soon assimilated. They adopted 
the Chinese language and let their own script fall into desuetude. The bannermen (Manchu 
soldiers) stationed in China, exempted from physical labor by a pernicious pension system, 
soon degenerated; so that by the nineteenth century it was necessary to train Chinese 
soldiers under Chinese leadership ta put down the T'ai-pting Rebellion. In the Northeast, 
conditions were not much better; with the migration of numerous military and civil per-
sonnel into China, the remaining bannermen ceased to be stalwart fighters. With the 
opening of rail communication, the tide of Chinese immigration was overwhelming. By The 
end of the Ch'ing dynasty, therefore, the Chinese and Mongols in Manchuria far outnum-
bered the Manchus, who today account for only a small percentage of the total population. 
The modern history of Manchuria epitomizes Reieiian and Japanese ambition and 
treachery in dealings with China. The need of ice-free ports long ago drove the Czars into 
imperialist ventures in Manchuria. As early as 1689. China !igrlect away to Russia large 
tracts of territory north of the Amur River. When Britain, France, and Japan were exact.-

ing increasing concessions from China, Russia stepped in and in a spirit of feigned friendship 
obtained the right to build the Chinese Eastern railway in Manchuria and to use Dairen 
and Port Arthur. These RuaSian special privileges clashed-with Japanese imperialist ambi-
tion and immediately led to war. japan emerged from the contest as a world power and 
held the ascendancy in Marichnria for the next forty-five years. The thriving South Man-
churian Railway Company was the principal agent of Japanese economic exploitation of 
the area. 
After the founding of the Republic, the war lord Chang Tso-lin was able to compete 
with Japanese interests by building rival rail systems and developing rival ports in Man-
churia. Realizing the possibility that political unity in China might increase the direct 
power of China in Manchuria, Japan took control of Liaoning, Kirin, and Heilungkiang 
after the so-called Mukden incident on 18 September 1931. In spite of weak guerilla 
resistance and ineffective protest by the League of Nations, Japan founded the so-called 
State of Manchukuo and invited Henry P'u-yi, the last Emperor of the Ch'ing dynasty, 
to become titular head of the puppet state. The Japanese Kwantung Army was the virtual 
ruler of Manchukuo; in 1933, it annexed Jebel as well. 
The population of Manchukuo is mainly C-hinese Northern Chinese were moving 
into Manchuria as early as the turn of the century. As the sea route from Tsingt,ao in 
Shantung to the Liaotung Peninsula is a short one, immigrants from Shantung .came in 
large numbers, especially in the late twenties. Though most were seasonal workers, many 
preferred to stay on and take advantage of the agricultural and industrial opportunities, 
which were infinitely greater than in China proper. Even the establishment of Manchukuo 
did not Aeck the migration. The result is that the Manchurian has the husky physique 
and dialectal inflection of the Shantung man. The Mongols, the next largest group (though 
minor by comparison with the Chinese), occupied the four Hsingan Provinces, which have 
recently been reorganized and absorbed as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. 
Japan put billions of dollars into the industrialization of Manchuria ? a long-term 
investment which did not pay off because of the relatively short tenure of Japanese power 
there. The civil administration of Manchukuo left much to be desired. In spite of its 
pretense to the benevolent way of government known as Wang Tao ("The Way of the 
Sage-King"), the average Chinese chafed under its tyranny. The exploitation of monarchi-
cal symbol and sentiment did not fool the Chinese either. The Japanese discouraged higher 
education for the Chinese in Manchukuo, except for short-term vocational and technical 
training. All the key positions in government, industry, and commerce were filled by 
Japanese. 
Soviet Russia sent troops into Manchuria on 9 August 1945, at a time when Japanese 
defeat was imminent and certain. Six days later, Japan surrendered to the Allies. By this 
nominal participation in the Eastern front, Russia got all the privileges and concessions 
exacted by Stalin from Roosevelt and Churchill during the Yalta conference. Russia virtu-
ally reassumed the position in Manchu-ia that it had occupied in 1904, before the Russo-
Japanese War. This was a bitter anti-climax, in view of China's nine years of war with 
Japan, a primary aim of which had been the recovery of Manchuria. Russia not only kid-
napped the Manchukuo Emperor (his destiny is unknown) and took prisoner a large body 
of demoralized Japanese troops; it also stripped away all essential industrial equipment. 
Soviet troops stayed in Manchuria long enough to assist in its infiltration by Chinese 
Communists and systematically obstruct a speedy take-over by the Nationalist Govern-
ment. Furthermore China was obliged, under the Yalta Agreement, to sign the Sino-Soviet 
Treaty and agreements of August 1945, by which Russia obtained joint-ownership of the 
Chinese Ch'ang-ch'nn Railway System and the right to use and garrison Dairen and Port 
80 
.0.?11 
Arthur. Nationalist troops never regained control of Manchuria except in a few key Micas 
like Mukden, and were predoomed to defeat when actual war broke out between the Nation-
alists and Communists. The Nationalist troops under the able command of Tu Yu-ming 
put up a heroic defense in Mukden, but this did not stop the Russians from arming the 
Chinese Communists, who were soon to overrun the mainland of China. 
During the time of Japanese occupation, the popolation of Manchuria consisted of 
Chinese, Mongols, Japanese, Koreans, Manchus, and White Russians. Many Koreans 
were employed as agents of Japanese terrorism, not telly in Manchuria but in the big 
Chinese cities as well with the result that even today, after all the intensive Aid-Korea-
Anti-US propaganda, the Chinese still remember the Koreans as the "running-dogs" of 
Japanese imperialism. 
The White Russian colony first came into being with the building of the Chinese 
Eastern railway. After the Bolshevik Revolution a new flood of White Russians came into 
Manchuria_ Though a great number had moved to Shanghai, a substantial Russian popula-
tion stayed on in Harbin, which remains a picturesque Russian city. Pretty Russian girls 
graced the night life there as cabaret entertainers, taxi-drivers, and waitresses. With the 
Russians' heroic stand against the Germans during World War 11, however, the White 
in Siiziiighzti fiald lirbin suddenly developed a homesickness for their old country. 
Most of them were later easily persuaded to accept Soviet citizenship and return to Russia. 
The Russian population in Manchuria now consists of persons sent there in political, 
miii-
lary, and industrial capacities. 
Manchuria has the largest forests of all China and many mineral resources. Chinese 
traders used to go among the mountain forests to look for sables and for ginseng and other 
medicinal herbs. Most Manchurian cities have beautiful parks. The massive tombs of 
Nurhachu and Ch'ing T'ai Tsung are famous tourist spots in Mukden. 
As in North China, the people in Manchuria use kaoliang, millet, and wheat as staple 
foods. But the chief agricultural product is the soybean, comprising (3C) percent of the 
world's production. The soybean is the most versatile food in China and a special blessing 
to the poor because of its high protein content. It is the source of soybean curd, soybean 
milk, and the soybean sauce that is used in preparing most Chinese foods. 
MongOia: Historical and Sociological 
Unlike the Manchus, the Mongols were never really assimilated by the Chinese. They 
conquered China once during the thirteenth century but were soon driven back to their 
home beyond the Great Wall. About 75 percent of the Mongolian people used to be sub-
jects either of the feudal lords or princes of the "banners" (Manchu administrative units), 
or of monasteries that owned large tracts of land given to them by the banners. They are 
primarily a nomadic people; this explains their weakness in the modern age because, in 
spite of their traditional valor, they could not compete with the Chinese colonists who 
began to encroach on their land in the Ch'ing dynasty. Nor could they cope with the wiles 
of Russian imperialists. Reluctant to adopt the agricultural and industrial mode of exist-
ence, they developed a kind of nationalism which, largely ignored by the Chinese govern-
ments, found increasing sustenance in Russian propaganda and Russian offers or aid over 
the past fifty years. In 1911 Outer Mongolia broke away from the Manchu government 
and, after the establishment of the Chinese Republic, fell increasingly under Rusaian influ-
ence and political and military control. 
First the government of Outer Mongolia re.nained clerical and aristocratic in character, 
with the Living Riiddha of Urga nemina:ly ex-rcising supreme spiritual UM I temporal 
power. But with the success of the October Revolution in Russia, rind with increased

Russian influence, the Mongol Revolutionary Party led by Sukhe Bator soon became pre-
dominant. In 1931 all land was nationalized and the Lama church was disestablished. 
Soviet Russia recognized the Mongolian People's Republic as early as 1921. Chinese recog-
nition came only as the result of the Sino-Soviet treaty in 1945, which gave the Outer 
Mongolian people the right to a plebiscite concerning their independent status. The present 
Premier of Outer Mongolia, Choibolsan, is well indoctrinated in Communist theory. lie 
has done much to replace the lamaistic and nomadic social order with Soviet methods of 
collective farming and cattle-raising. 
Outer Mongolia is a huge and barren territory, very thinly populated and little pene-
trated with Chinese influence. The Mongols in Inner Mongolia inhabit a richer territory 
and come more often in contact with the Chinese. Strictly speaking, Inner Mongolia 
should denote the Mongol-inhabited parts of the provinces of Suiynan, Chahar, and Ningsia; 
but the western and southwestern territories of Manchuria, largely inhabited by Mongols, 
have come to be known as Eastern Inner Mongolia. The Mongols in Sinkiang, Tsinghai, 
and North Ningsia are Western Mongols. The provincial set-up of the Republican govern-
ment primarily represented an attempt to minimize Mongolian nationalism and to safe-
guard the peaceful coexistence of Mongols and Chinese, particularly in Inner Mongolia. 
At first the Mongol leaders NvcAromed Chinese settlers in their territory as a means of 
getting the cheaper foodstuffs that the Chinese farmers could produce. But as their land 
steadily shrank, they became alarmed, and clashes between Mongols and Chinese became 
frequent. The policy of the Ch'ing and Republican governments, partial as it was to the 
Chinese, only inflamed Pan-Mongolian sentiment. At first, the Inner Mongolian leaders, 
nobles and princes mostly', were suspicious of Soviet Russia, and had no inclination, to 
follow the Mongol People's Republic of Outer Mongolia into domination by Russia. The 
Japanese, meanwhile, had possession of Manchuria, and were sensitive to the pressure 
of Mongolian nationalism. Four Mongol provinces the Ilsingan provinces ? were 
established in Manchukuo by the Japanese to give special protection and the privileges of 
organization to the Eastern Mongolian population. Seeing this example, the Mongols in 
Inner Mongolia demanded autonomous government from the Chinese Nationalists. Their 
movement was led by Teh Wang or Prince Teh, who temporarily turned Japanese puppet 
as governor of a new Wrig Chiang --- "Mongol Frontier" -- Province during the Sino-
Japanese War. After the war he emerged as the staunch anti-Communist leader of a 
minority Mongolian group. After the \van the pro-Communist faction gained ascendancy 
in Inner Mongolian polities under the leadership of the Moscow-trained Mongol Ulanhu, 
and the fate of Prince Teh in Communist China is unknown. Later an Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region was set up, comprising Eastern Inner Mongolia and parts of Inner 
Mongolia. It is probable that the Mongols are now discarding feudal nomadism in favor 
of a Communist mode of existence. 
The strength of the Mongols was sapped by Lama Buddhism, which they adopted in 
the sixteenth century. The Manchus, after they had obtained possession of China, encour-
aged this religious practice among the Mongols, precisely to keep them tame and peaceful. 
Lamaism blunted the warlike spirit they had inherited from their forefathers, and kept a 
large percentage of the male population from practising any useful occupation. It also 
partially modified the nomadic social structure, as the lamaseries, which were not movable 
like the yurt tents, served as nuclei for permanent settlements. So not a few Mongols have 
taken up farming in addition to cattle-raising, though most of the arable land in Suiyuan 
and Chahar has been wrested from their hands by Chinese colonists. 
Depending on grasslands and oases in the desert for a living, the Mongols are excellent 
horsemen, inured to physical hardships and discomforts. They are trained in horse-back

riding from earliest childhood_ Much smaller than the Arabian or European breeds, the 
Mongol pony is extremely hardy and swift. On little food and water it can carry heavy 
loads at high speeds, and endure the rigors of the 1,-.'L',ongolian winters. 
The Mongols rarely wash themselves. Forever cloaked in their sheepskins, they ar?. 
extremely dirty and are indifferent to skin diseases, which are very prevalent among MM. \ 
Because of the dust storms from the Gobi, most Mongols have contracted trachoma, and the 
percentage of blind people is quite high. Freedom in sexual relationships makes for a high 
incidence of venereal diseases. 
The Mongols are a polite people. and most foreign tourists who have been entertqined 
in the yurts carry away a favorable impression of their hospitality. Their food consists of 
salted-and-buttered tea, animal meat, and tsamba, a kind of paste made of barley flour 
mixed with tea. Their diet is conspicuous for the hick of leafy vegetables and fruit. On 
occasions, the Mongols arc hard drinkers. 
The Mongol youths marry quite early, usually with ad of the matchmakers. The men 
are not particularly energetic; they traditionally scorn manual labor. The women do all 
the household chores. A rich Mongol often keeps two or three concubines; in such a 
hold, the first wife is the undisputed mistress. Like her Tibetan sister, the Mongol woman 
wears an daboratc hairdrc..-i-:;, and iz; loaded down with nnektaaea, teirsina7, pod

CH IN ESE HISTORY

Chinese Mythology concerning the Origins of their Society 
Like all other peoples, the Chinese possess a body of legends and myths concerning the 
origins of their society. These are of great. interest because they have had a profound influ-
ence upon political and social thinking in China. The Chinese tend to look back into the 
past for guidance in the solving of current problems, to regard the past as the only Golden 
Age, rather than to expect great things of the future. The heroes of their legendary tales 
masaaeer, thaught of as embodying the qualities of perfect rulers, and their supposed 
conduct is deemed relevant to the definition of all the virtues that are to be admired. Nor 
are these recent phenomena; they are traditional ways of looking at things. 
Aecording to Chinese mythology. after Heaven and Earth were separated and the world 
came into being, the universe was first ruled by a succession of supernatural emperors. One 
popular account holds that first there were the Twelve Emperors of Heaven, each of whom 
reigned eighteen thousand years. They were followed by the Eleven Emperors of the Earth, 
who also ruled for eighteen thousand years each. Finally there were the Nine Emperors of 
Mankind. Traditional Chinese historians were fairly unanimous in assuming that a period 
of rule by supernatural emperors actually occurred, but no effort appears to have been made 
to establish a uniform account of this period. Rather, different localities developed their 
own variants of the general theme, free rein being given to the imagination of storytellers. 
Following the Nine Emperors were the Three Sovereigns, and it is only with them that 
the traditional histories converge on an "orthodox"' account. The first two of the/se heroes, 
Fu 1 Isi and Shen Nung, were of supernatural origin, but they are depicted as having been 
eoncerned about the development of human civilization. By tradition Fu Hsi invented 
most of the early arts and crafts, and taught them to the Chinese. Shen Nang is said to 
have contributed to the development of agriculture, and to have taught the Chinese their 
methods of raising crops. 
The Third of the Three Sovereigns, lItiang Ti, was China's first human ruler, although 
he instructed his people out of a wisdom that was divine. All the subsequent rulers and 
princes of ancient China claimed descent from him, and based their right to rule on that 
claim. Huang Ii, so legend has it, was fallawed by four rulers who were instrumental in 
transforming the Chinese from a savage and barbaric people into the most civilized people 
in the world, Ail of these rulers were so very great that they did not attempt to establish 
family dynasties; each recognized, that is to say, that his sons were unworthy to serve as 
leaders of the Chinese people. Of the four rulers, Chuan Ilsin, K'u, Yao, and Shun, Con-
fucius regarded the latter two as the greatest. Confucianist writings make repeated refer-
ence to Yao and Shun as examples of perfect rulers, and orthodox Confucianists think of 
them as hay lag set the standards of governmental and ethical practices. Confucius himself 
stated that he was not originating ideas about government, but merely attempting to set 
(loan practices that Viso and Shun had established. Thus Yao and Shun were traditionally 
regarded as embodiments of the Confucianist ideals.

According to tradition, Shun chose as his sutseessor a man natmxi Yu. Ile, like the 
others, was a descendant of Huang Ti, and is rememberssd in Chinese tradition as the symbol 
of selfless public service, since he was called upon to devote thirteen years of ceaseless labor 
to combatting great floods that threatental the very existence of the Chinese people. During 
those years he refused even to visit his own home and family, although on three dist;net 
occasions he passed by the door of bis home and heard the cries of his 'children. 
Yu attempted to follow the example of his pretlecessors by claimitig, that his sons were 
not worthy to succeed him. The people, however, insisted that tribute be paid to his 
memory by having his son 'follow him as emperor. Thus, we Are told, the first of the tradi-
tional Chinese dynasties, the liana was founded. 
According to the traditional chronology, the Hsia was founded in 2205 we., and lasted 
until 1766 a.c. Although there probably was a 1laia dynasty, modern historical research 
has shown these dates to be completely untrustworthy. 
The Origins of Chinese Culture 
All the preceding is legend. Generally speaking, the actual origins of the Chinese 
people and their culture are mat ters of conjecture. Only within the last few decades has 
selentifie research focused open such quest ions, and the results. to date have been meager, 
enough work having been done to discredit most of the traditional acrounta but not enough 
to justify any significant number of firm statements about the origins of Chinese civilization. 
It seems probable that Chinese culture originated in the lower Hwang (Yellow) River 
Valley of North China in prehistoric times. that it sproad westward along the river, and 
was, in its early stages of development, largely independent of influcaecs (ruin other areas. 
What is known of the origins of ('h ii culture may be summarized iii it few paragraphs. 
In 1927 an important archeological discovery was made in a cave about thirty miles 
from Peking: the remains of a prototype of modern man now called Sitionthropus Prkinensis, 
or Peking Man. These remains are regarded as being about five hundred thousand years 
old. 
Archeological studies in the Ordos Desert have uncovered stone implements that have 
been placed in the p.aleolit hie (Old Stone) age, a Inch would make them about fifty thousand 
year old. ;`,1arc eatanaiee finds have been made of remains from several neolithic cultures 
that appear to be directly related to subsequent Chinese civilization. The most important 
two of these are the Yang Shao and the Lung Shan cultures. The Yang Shao culture 
appears to have spread southeast from liansu into what is modern llonan and Shantung. 
Its distinguishing mark, for present purposes, was its crude gray pottery, which was of the 
same shape as the later Chinese bronze vessels. These threeleaged vessels, the /i and the 
ting, may fairly be regarded as distinct products oi Chinese culture. Although some of the 
Yang Shao finds seem to resemble discoveries of remains from the same period in the Black 
Sea area, North China appears to have been the center from which the culture spread. 
The Lung Shan culture is believed to have originated in a hat is now Shantung, and 
to have spread to the north anti west. The Lung Shan culture also appears to have devel-
oped fairly advanced techniques for making and designing pottery, many of the designs 
being found in the bronze vea-els f later periods. This has led to the assumption that the 
two cultures were not only indigenous to the North China area, but were probably the direct 
predecessors of the subsequent Bronse Age culture of China. 
The Shang Dynasty 
Traditional Chinese history held that the first Chine-se dynasty, true 11sia, was followed 
by the Shang dynasty, which was said to ha V4' (lilted from 1766 to 1122 ac. During the

latter years of the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth century, historical 
research tended to cast doubt on the existence of the Shang as well as the Hsia. In 1928, 
however, an archaeological expedition working near An-yang in northern Honan located 
the ancient capital of the Shang or, as it is also called, the Yin dynasty. The importance 
of the An-yang find lies not merely in the recovery of tools, implements, foundations of 
houses, and the like, but :deo in the discovery of a large collection of bones and tortoise-
abella, the so-called oracle hones, which were used in divination ceremonies. They are 
especially valuable because the inscriptions carved on them are the oldest examples of the 
Chinese written language. They have shed interesting light on the derivation of many 
Chinese characters, and, what is more important, scholars have been able to decipher them, 
and thus to increase the available knowledge of Shang society. Among other things, 
the oracle bones mention the names of most of the kings formerly attributed to the 
Shang period, and thus verify the record set forth in the traditional histories. It is now 
known, then, that the Shang did exist, although the dates for the period do not coincide 
with the orthodox records. The Shang period was probably from around 1500 to 1050 B.C. 
The fact of having found convincing evidence that the Shang actually existed has 
disposed specialists on ancient China to assume that there probably was a Iisia period as 
well. There is still no direct. evidence to support this assumption, but enough circumstantial 
evidence to indicate that the Shang must have been preceded by some fairly advanced cul-
The Shang was so highly skilled in such arts as bronze casting and had developed so 
ingenious a written language that it seems safe to assume an earlier though less highly 
developed vulture preceding it. 
All the evidence indicates that the Shang people had a sedentary agrarian economy. 
The oracle bones:, to be sure, mention hunting and fishing, but there is reason to believe 
that these activities were indulged in more as a sport than as a basic part of the economy. 
It seems likely that the Chinese not only developed their agrarian way of life at a very 
early stage, but that they probably never passed through a pastoral period. 
The Shang society was feudalistic, the king and the aristocracy owning all the land. 
The masses of the people were serfs bound to the land, and during the early period it is 
doubtful that they were permitted even to have their own family units. The nobility, on 
the other hand, were extremely conscious of family ties, and appear to have engaged in a 
fo7-rn of ancestor worship. In addition to the nobles and the peasants, the Shang society 
had a0!1.4Sofertisens and e elefhdh.s priestherad The artisans and craftsman supplied the 
wants of the nohility, and produced the ceremonial implements required by the priests. 
Especially in the field of bronze-casting, the Shang artisans achieved a very high degree 
of technical and artistic proficiency, establishing standards that later periods never equaled. 
The Shang priesthood exercised great power. Neither the kings nor the nobility made 
any important deeisions without consulting it. Besides being closely associated with divine 
things, the priests had the advantage of being the only experts in readhig and writing. They 
Were responsible for the development of the Chinese written language, and it was they who 
Mitiated the tradition of holding in reverence the ability to manipulate the written word. 
This t radii am was to assume tremendous importance in subsequent Chinese history. 
Chou Dynasty, lain to 921 B.C. 
In the year 1050 tee., Chinese records state, the Shang was conquered by the house of 
Chou, and a new dynasty was established. The roots of the Chou were in present-day 
Shensi Province. Even before defeating the hang, it seems that they had already adopted 
many features of Shang culture. Haying ws , they retained the Sha rig's artisans and the 
Shang seript. But they were not mere imitators. It was they, for example, who introduced

the rigid patriarchal family system that was to lag-erne an essential and enduring, aspect of 
Chinese eolture. Also, they brought with them the "cult of Heaven," and the belief that 
their: g house had won its power as a grant from Heaven, and that their Emperor was, 
as he 'e.; (allied, the Son of Heaven. From this cult there developed the Chinese concept 
of the eamdate of Heaven, which held: first, that the Emperor ruled in the name of Heaven; 
second, that so long as he followed the will of }leaven the people and the government would 
prosper; hut, third, that if the Emperor failed in his function of mediating between Heaven 
and Man and lost the Mandate, the people had a right of revolution. 
'The introduction of the Chou family system rendered unnecessary the main functions 
of the Shang priesthood, since it required the head of the family to perform personally all 
the important religious rites. The main religious ceremonies, in other words, became secu-
larized, and there was no longer any need for a special priestly class. In time, the old 
priestly class Was transformed into a group of secular advisors to the Chou court and the 
nobility. They continued to be valued for their skill in reading and writing, which enabled 
them to perform many essential functions associated with ruling. They entirely ceased, 
however, to be a distinct religious elite. 
The Chou ii'lgtiorn was organized along feudalistic.' lines, the Chou lands, considerably 
larger than those of the Slang. Issing entrusted to noliles to "have" and to "hold." These 
nobles were a law unto themselves Wit hill their oan atee, hut were expected to give 
allegiance to the king and defend him against any external attack. The feudal lords, how-
ever, gradually gained in political power, until the Chou court finally lost its direct control 
over them. With tlw reduction of its 1)1)10 'mend power, the Chou court became inereeeingly 
religious institution, concerned inninly with perforaung, ceremonies relating to Heaven. 
The feudal estates became the arenn in which competing power groups nt niggled for 
ascendancy. 
In ('h'ang-an (now Sian), the capital of the (Imo kingdom (in what is now the 
province of Shensi), was captured by rebellious vassals, and the Chou emperors, though able

The most influential of all these philosopher-advisors was Confucius (K'ung Fu-tzil, . 
551 to TN lee.), whose ideas have influenced Chitieae thought far more than those of any 
other man. Confucius, like all the other thinkers, was profoundly disturbed by what he tradition of a centralized state w ,o

the only salvation for society was a return to n a older Golden Age, in which all the relation-

The other thing to remember about the first Ch'in Emperor is that he took vigorous 
steps to centralize and regularize all phases of government, and life in China. For example, 
the written language was formalized during his rule, largely as a means of improving 
administration, and a correct form was decreed for the writing of each character. Uniform 
standards of weights and measures were established and, of course, greatly facilitated the 
collecting of taxes for the central government. Nlilita.ry and adminierrative post roads were 
built and uniform widths of axle for all vehicles prescribed as a first step toward standardiz-
ing the widths of all highways. Finally, the walls built as defense works to the north of 
China were linked together to form the Great Wall, which stretched fifteen hund.ed miles 
along the frontiers that guarded Chios against the raids of the nomadic barbarians in 
;Mongolia a feat which only a centralized government could have accomplished. All 
these reforms, furthermore, were carried out with a ruthless determination that must be 
explained, in part, in terms of the Emperor's devotion to the Legalist philosophy. 
The Chinese tradition of the centralized state was not tsstabliahed without tremendous 
cost in human life and a large-scale uprooting of old attitudes and values. In order to 
carry out his policies, the First Emperor set up vhat may fairly be described as the first 
totalitarian state in history. The Ch'in's methods, to be sure, were a far cry from modern 
totalitarian techniques but their dominion was authoritarian and ruthless to a degree that 
had never before been seen or dreamed of in China. As might be expected, therefore, the 
Ch'in government met constant opposition not only from the common people, who were 
called upon to bear the real economic costs of the new policies, but also prom the educated 
Confucian elements in Chinese society. 
Ch'in Shih Ifuang-ti, in his attempt to )pe with these powerful opponents, adopted 
measures of the kind that is classified today under the general heading of "thought control." 
In 213 me., for example, all Confucian books were ordered burned, and while this edict was 
repealed in 191 toe., much irreparable damage had already been done, and many historic 
works of the earlier periods of Chinese culture had been lost. Many, however, survived, 
which suggests that the Ch'in state, insofar as it was totalitarian, was not completely 
efficient. 
So widespread was the opposition to Ch'in rule that immediately after the death of the 
founder of the dynasty its empire began to crumble untie- +he impact of a series of revolts. 
Ch'in Shih fluare-ti's successors were weak personalitnee and conflicts soon developed 
among the advisors at court that. tended to uadertaiiie the efficiency of the central adminis-
tration. The provinces, in consequence, gained greater autonomy, and became bases for 
new power groupings that were soon struggling with One another for mastery over the entire 
area of China. The central government that Ch'in had established collapsed, but the 
tradition in favor of such a government did not disappear with it. Once it was gone, the 
military and polit teal leaders consciously engaged in a struggle to establish a new centralized 
dynasty, and do not appear to have considered seriously the possibility of reverting to a 
system of localized principalities. 
The Han Dynasty (R06 B.C. to A.D. 220) 
The struggle for power following the Ch'in dynasty eventually resolved itself into a 
conflict between two men and their followers. One was Liu Pang (Liu Chi), a man of 
humble origin who had served in the Ch'in military organization, possessed great gifts for 
organization, and used them well in enlisting the political support of the various rebel 
leaders. The other was lisiang VU (Hsiang ('hi), who personified the typical qualities of 
feudal China. Ile was a dashing and heroic military leader, who deeply believed in the 
customs and practices of the earlier aristocracy. Liu Pang's political and organizational

? 
:Ain ultimately won out over the email but brilliant group that gat her-cd around Ilsiang Yt 
Hsiang YU had what it took to win the battles, hut did not know how to marshal the 
support needed for a long eampahasra. 
When Hu Pang, usually known by his reign title of Kno To, ascended the throne and 
so established the Ilan dynasty, he did taut at first .:u r rvn the policies itt;SO.L'iated with the 
Ch'in. Rather he granted fiefs, similar to those ef feudal days, to his immediate supporters, 
and these became, even in the ar-t few years of the dynasty, centers of power capable of 
challenging the central administeation which they did, increasingly, until 151 P.C., 
when there was a serious-Igo unsuceeseful revolt against the central government. 
Kao Tu, just before his death, decreed that tally members of the imperial family 
could hold fiefs. lle:wever, he left it to his successor, Wu Ti (1-10 to 87 tee.), one of the most 
brilliant of all China's emperors, to eliminate the last vestiges of formal feudalism. This he 
accomplislaai by a lia'rce prohibiting primogeniture (i.e., the passing on of an estate to the 
eldest SOTI alone); and ever since ;Ilea, it has been a Ledo principle of Chineae customary 
law that all male heirs have equal rights in their father's estate. 
The Ilan government, hailing that it needed administrators if it \\eta to rule suctessfully 
over its large domain, turned for them to the Confucianist literati, thus establishing the 
Chinese tradition according to which the fenctions of aienanmero should he performed by 
Confucianist scholars. The Ilan system if government did mit (-airy the development and 
refinement of bureaucrItCy nearly so far as they were ealned later, but the general pattern 
of administrative rule by qualified civil ,ervants moo, clearly established tit this time. The 
scholars, moreover, proved useful. Their skill in writing eminently qualified Ihvm for the 
reporting side of adminietration, and the emphasis they were trained to put on ceremony 
arid ritual gave to the Ilan government a great deal of dignity and prestige that the first 
Ilan ruler, perhaps iii part because he was a commoner, appears to have welcomed. 
Even before the Ilan government had completed the task of organizing the resources 
within its terrOories, it Mitiated a Sefie,-. Of rridiutry expeditions that were to be among the 
most glorious in Chinese history. The armies of Emperor Wu Ti penetrated the territory 
of present-day 7\ lanchuria, northern Korea, Kashgar, and Russian Turkestan. tither

lasting effect on China's neighhore, and the Chinese people are still called "men of Han" 
both in ('Ilina and in the non-Chinese border regions.* 
T'he expansion of the Ilan domains brouelit the Chinese into close contact \kith the 
noinadie tribe, on their north and northwest frontiers. These non-Chinese groups, "her-

troops in the outposts of the empire, and partly hy working mit a systematic policy toward 
the border peoples that was to become a basic feature of China's relations with Ow outside

T 
business to maintain enough effective military power at home to provide the troops needed 
for victory in any major clash. 
The Chinese regarded the northwest as particularly important, because the overland 
trade route extended through that area into Central Asia, where it finally joined up with the 
eastern trade routes of the Roman Empire. The Han records make it clear that the Chinese 
traveled this route extensively, and came to know Roman society and European geography 
much more thoroughly than the Romans knew Chinese society and geography. The early 
trade between Asia and Europe was conducted through, so to speak, third parties, the most 
important of whom were the Partehians and the Arabs. China exported to Rome large 
quantities of such prized items as silk, tea, spices, and works of art. The Europeans, since 
they had little of value to offer in exchange except a few curiosities, had to pay mainly in 
gold and silver. There appears to have been a drain of precious metals out of Europe into 
China during the Ilan period on such a scale as to affect both economies profoundly, Some 
authorities believe it may have accele tied the eventual fall of the Roman Empire. 
Another important consequence c. Chinese expansion under the Han was the traria-
p/anting of Buddhism from India into China. Travelers to India had brought back with 
them interesting accounts of this religicgl, and in due time individual Chinese made the 
long trip to India to learn more about it and to obtain copies of its holy books. While the 
Han state remained strong, Confucianism was to continue to serve as the basic ideology 
of its government and Buddhism was regarded rather as a curiosity than as a living religion. 
It was only during the period of political confusion after the fall of the Han dynasty, when 
the organized Confucianist scholars found ihemseives unable to offer effective opposition, 
that Buddhism began to catch on in China as a popular religion. 
In spite of its remarkable record of military and administrative accomplishment, the 
Han dynasty never fought itself free of serious problems. One persisting difficulty (of 
which, incidentally, Chinese imperial government was never able to rid itself even under 
later dynasties) was intrigue and favor-seeking at the Imperial Court. The causes of this 
evil were many and varied. Much of the intrigue revolved about the families from which 
the Emperor obtained wives and concubines for his harem. In post-feudal China an 
families were regarded as commoners, which meant that it was necessary to raise the status 
of any prosputive consort family; and as this practice continued the empresaez' families 
liecame so numerous and powerful that they were able to dominate even the Imperial 
family. Besides seeking favors for themselves, they made such use of their position as 
enabled them to grant favors to others, and thus became an important factor in the conduct 
of the government. 
Another important source of intrigue was the practice of employing eunuchs as servants 
to the women in the Imperial Court. The eunuchs' functions situated them, of course, in 
close proximity to the emperor, and they made the most of this strategic position by setting 
themselves up as advisors on affairs of state and by trafficking in audiences with the 
Emperor. The opportunities for intrigue by the eunuchs were multiplied by the Emperors' 
practice of maintaining an imperial harem, which increased the itemiser of strategically 
situated eunuchs ? to say nothing of the fact that the harem itself became a further source 
of petty rivalries that affected State policy. 
The I Ian were also obliged to face serious issues arising from within the government. 
The most vexing of these resulted from the tendency on the part of the bureaucracy to 
separate off into cliques and groupings that vied with one another for control of the adminis-
tration, and in doing so inevitably lessened the effeetiveness of the government. Another 
lay in the fact that the Confucianist bureaucracy early became the defenders of the landed 
interests, and helped the latter to evade taxation and to accumulate ever-larger land holdings.

During the years from A .D. 9 to 23, the Ilan throne was occupied by the usurper Wang 
Mang, -vho attempted, among other radical reforms, the reduction of large land holdings, 
the regulation of prices, wages, and rates of interest, and the imposition of a larger tax 
burden. Ile met violent oppositnin on the part oi the Confucianist Raiders, who saw in his 
proposals a threat to the position of the conaervative landed gentry class. They frustrated 
his reforms, and saw to it that he was driven from the throne. Wang !1latig's brief rule 
ended what is called the Earlier or Western Ilan period, during which the capital a as at 
Sian in Shensi. There ensued the later or Eastern Hall Period, when the capital was at 
Lo-yang, in the present province of H011arl. 
The final collapse of the Han dynasty, some two hundred years later, was the produet 
of a series of revolts by various governmeot ministers and military leaders, and of an attempt 
(the first in Chinese history) by a secret society, the Yellow Turban Society, to overthrow 
the ruling house. Suppressing these revolts' called for experidit ores that wrecked the gov-
ernments finances, and left it so weakened that one of the rebellious military leaders was 
finally able to capture the capital itself. 
The Three Kingdoms (2,20 to ?6,5) 
During the final years of the Ilan dynasty, tieveral military leaders were contending 
for power. each determined to capture the hist Ilan emperor and, by taking over the seals 
of state, to establiali a new dynasty. The last emperor was, in point of fact, several times 
the captive of one or another of these 111.1lit a ry leaders, none of whom, however, ever Nue-
ceeded in unifying the entire country. Their at rug,glem, reaulting in the disappearance of 
the Ilan empire, introduced a period of shout three hundred and sixty years during which 
there was no centralized government tnipabie of governing all of China. This period has 
been labeled the "Dark Ages" of Chintea? histre.v. Political] , it NV as indeed a time of great 
confusion, durine which alien groups were often in control of much of North China. It :erw 
the eatablishmee of numerous dynasties, none of which, howe?er, achieved the power of 
.such reeeg aeases as the nail and the later 'rang. Thew were, indeed, little more than 
malitary dictatorships, destined to last only so long as their founders could maintain their 
local military ascendancy. 
During the years 
ing the collapse of the II an regime, three kingdonui 
or dynasties were established in China. In the north, the Wei dominated the area of present-
day Shansi. Hunan, and Shantung. lam the modern province of Szechwan, the Shu Ilan, 
claiming' to have descended from the Ilan family, gained ascendancy. In the southeast 
there appeared the state of Wu, with ita capital near modern Nanking. These three states 
engaged constantly in military campaigns against one another, but to little Or no purpose 
as far as the subsequent development of ,   is concerned. It must be noticed, however, 
that later ages romanticized this periiid of Chillfit history as a golden age of chivalry and 
heroic struggle. The CA plOitS of its military leaders have played a prominent role in Chimase 
literature, e g. in the famous novel San-lino-C/A len-I. Half history and half legend, they 
were for centuries the main theme of professional story-tellers, min millions of (Iiinese are 
more or leas familiar with them to this day. The mien clever and dreshirig the period's 
heroes was Ts'ao Ts'ao, who is credited with the c''1 ed epigram: "I would :tither

Chin Dynasty (E65 to 419) ? 
The epic period of the Three Kingdoms ended when the head of one of the powerful 
families which provided advisors o the Wei emperor usurped. the latter's throne, and de-
clared himself the first emperor of a new dynasty, the Chin. Forming an alliance with the 
nomadic fishing Nu tribe, he waged war first against the Shu Han and then against the 
Wu, both of whom he had conquered by A.D. 280, thus reuniting China under a single ruler. 
The new dynasty almost immediate'y involved itself, however, in a war with various north-
ern barbarian groups who were eventually to conquer large areas of northern China. The 
most important of these tribes came into China from what is now Mongolia (plus certain 
Russian territ)ry), and were known as the Toba, Ilsien Pi, Tibetans, and the lisiung Nu. 
They established, with some assistance from Chinese leaders, a series of so-called dynasties, 
the most famous of which, the Toba Wei dynasty, controlled most of northern China from 
385 to 550. 
The Wei succeeded in driving the Chin into southern China, where they continued to 
maintain a court in Nanking. China was thus partitioned, with the North dominated by 
aliens and only the South still under Chinese control. After the Chin dynasty was over-
thrown in 119, a succession of four minor dynasties ruled the lands. 
The Spread of Buddhism 
The concepts of Buddhism were first introduced into China at the height of the Han 
dynasty. The new religion, which had long dominated India, awakened a certain amount 
of interest, but as indicated above it could not, while the Han government remained strong 
and the Confucianist scholars continued to monopolize the state bureaucracy, even begin 
to play in China the role it played in the neighboring sub-continent. The Confucianists 
recognized it, from the early moment when the appeal of its complex doctrines and its rich 
literature to the Chinese mind had become clear, as a threat to their leadership in Chinese 
society. 
In the conditions of political chaos following the disintegration of the Han, however, 
the Confucianist scholars lost the strategic positions that, had enabled them to put the power 
and prestige of the state to work in defense of their ideology and against inroads by other 
eeaterna of thonight China became a philosophical open market in which all schools of 
thought could compete, and Buddhism entered the lists with certain advantages. Its 
ttgwers to such troubling questions as those rehtting to death and ein were highly aophisti-
crop& Its complicated theology and massive scriptures appealed strongly to educated 
Chinese. Its mysticism was highly congenial to the superstitions of the masses. And in 
North China, particularly, the spread of Buddhism was facilitated by the fact. that the area 
was controlled by non-Chinese, with whom Confucianism did nut have the inside run it 
enjoyed in the rest of China, as also by the fact that the conquerors had driven out many 
of the landed Confucianist gentry. Here the Buddhist leaders were soon able to establish 
large monasteries, and to gain control, through them, of much of the area's land. The con-
querors, products of a nomadic society, had failed to buttress their power by obtaining 
immediate title to farm lands. The Buddhist monasteries took advantage of this state of 
affairs, and came to dominate the North's farm economy. 
The Confucianists, of course, finally reestablished their bureaucratic monopoly, and 
were able to see to it that Buddhism should never again make a hid for the kind of ascend-
ancy Confucianism enjoyed in China. Among; the masses of the people, to be awe, Bud-
dhism reree'ned an important religious force. but only in this sense, and perhaps a little 
through the wealth and influence of its monasteries, has it been a factor in Chinese politics 
and government.

Moreover, the rang period was undoubtedly one of the most productive and inspired 
in the history of Chinese art. and letters. T'ang poetry became a model for all subsequent 
Chinese efforts it verse, and Li Po and Tu Fu are by common consent the outstanding 
poets of all Chinese literature. In the field of painting the outstanding artist of the dynasty, 
possibly even of all Chinese history, was Wu Tao-hat:tan, who is also known by the names 
Wu Tao Tata and Wu Tao-yuan. 
It was, however, the political and social stability the T'ang brought to China that 
made poesible all these artistic achievements. In the field of government the T'ang pro-
vided a model not only for later Chinese dynasties, but also for (among other imitators) 
Japan. The administration of state affairs was conducted through an elaborate bureau-
cracy, staffed by candidates who had been successful in a carefully planned series of civil 
service examinations. China under the rang was an avowedly Confucianist society, ruled 
by an elite made up of men who had demonstrated their competence by mastering a vast 
corpus of classical learning and by achieving great skiff at manipulating written words. 
The test was perhaps a narrow one, but the bureaucracy was based on merit rather than on 
favor, and while so organized as to produce eentrall:ed rale for some purposes, it allowed a 
relatively high degree of autonomy to local officials for other purposes. The theory, to be 
sure, was that all the officials, even local ones, were in a single hierarchy directed from the 
center. Normally, however, it was unnereasary Ler the upper levels of the bureaucracy to 
concern themselves ?vith problems at the local level. Because one and the same ideology 
pervaded all sections of the bureaucracy, and all of them applied a single and common ethical 
standard, the official at the local level did not require detailed control. 
Although it was during the Han dynasty that the tradition of using Confucianist 
scholars as the backbone of government arid administration had first appeared, the T'ang 
perfected the institutional arrangements that made possible the privileged status they were 
to enjoy through the centuries. The idea originated under the Han; it came to fruition 
under the Tang. And it is to the efficiency of its administration that we must attribute 
the perpetuation of the rule of the T'ang House for nearly three hundred years, especially 
in view of what is known about the weakness of some of the individual emperors. 
By the end of the ninth century, however, the dynasty was beset by all the disintegrat-
ing forces that had brought. its predecessors low. Its court was torn by personal jealousies, 
corrupted by the back-stars intrigue of the harems and eunuchs, and weakened by inde-
pendent leaders who defied the central government from points of vantage in the provinces. 
The latter problem was especially urgent in the extreme north, where the commanders of 
the defenses against nomadic incursions had succeeded in building up large military organi-
zat ions, and had used the latter to usurp civil control in the territories under their command. 
In time, moreover, this urgent problem generated another. For as tension increased between 
the frontier commanders and the court, and between different frontier commanders, the 
nomads themselves began to he brought into the fracas as allies of whatever faction could 
win their support. This introduction of non-Chinese elements into the Chinese political 
and military scene was to have lasting consequences, one of which was that through most 
of the next thousand years all or part of China's territories was to be controlled by alien 
peoples. 
The 'rang court, in trying to cope with this treachery on the part of its military officers, 
increased the tax and conscription burden in the areas still directly under its control by 
leaps and bounds, :111(1 thus producad the :-auses for further revolts in the rest of its terri-
tories. And it was these revolts, aided and directed by secret societies and supported by 
the mass of the peasantry along with thsgrunt led office-seekers, that gave the coup de grAce 
to the T'ang dynasty.

The Fire Dynasties (907 to 960) 
The Chinese call the period following the collapse of the rang, the Wu Tat' or Five 
Dynasties. The term is not quite aceneate: while there was indeed a succession of five 
minor dynasties in North China between 907 and t.)(0, ten others came and went during the 
same period in South China. It was in other ?? Inds, a ne\N period of such widespread 
political confusion that no government was ruling the entire country. Even the five 
dynasties in the north were in power for such short periods that we need do no More than 
list their names: l.ater Liang (907 to 922!, I.ater T'ang (923 to 936), Later ('bin (937 to 946), 
Later Han 0:0-17 to 950a and Later Chou (951 to (159). 
The suspension of the buicaucratie state during this period furred the Confucianist-
scholar class into a new type of activity, !lamely, trade For a time, indeed, it appeared 
that the members of the scholar bureaucracy would completely abandon their traditional 
aloofness from economic activity, This did not luTpen. for once China again had R cen-
tralized government the Colifticianist scholars for the most part returned to the bureaucracy. 
But they did so without entirely severing their connection with economic activities. (hi 
the level of formal ideology, to be sure, they continued to hold that the scholar-eiyil-
servant could only lw corrupted by interesting himself iii trade and commerce. But from 
the time of the Five Dynasties it was cornmon knowledge that mernhers of the official class 
were in fact augmenting their personal wealth throligh commercial activities. Part of the 
price ('h;oa paid for the Five .1)\ luv-ties ?t as, therefore, a red depreciation of standards in 
its bureaucracy, which could no longer be relied upon not to subordinate the public interest 
to private profit. 
It remains to mention another important development of this period (the last days of 
the rang, and the Five Dynasties): the int naluct a in of wood-block printing, which made 
it possible to produce books at a much lower cost than formerly arid thus drastically reduned 
the cost of education. This led in time to a considerable increase in literacy, which 'WM to 
have far-reaching consequences in the field of entertainment literature :IN well as in education.

known as Neo-Confucianism, which differed from traditional Confucianism in at least two 
major respects: it incorporated a great many Buddhist and Taoist ideas, and it was built 
on an elaborate metaphysical foundation, so that it could not, like Confucianism, be 
described as merely a system of ethics. It retained intact, however, most Confucianist 
doctrine respecting the administration and government. Landscape painting, porcelain-
making, and printing all pushed ahead into new territory, and the greatest of the Sung poets 
rivaled those of the Tang period. Some experts, indeed, consider the works of Su Tung-p'0 
(Li Tung), Kuang, and Shao Yung, all of whom belong to this period, among the 
finest in all Chinese literature. 
Alien Rule 
For a long period after the fall of the Thing dynasty, all or part of China was dominated 
politically by non-f hineee elements. The Khitan tribes (the Liao dynasty) controlled 
northeast China from 937 to 1125. Elements from Tibet, known as the Usi lisla dynasty, 
governed northwestern China from 1038 to 1227. The Liao dynasty, to be sure, was finally 
forced out of the northeast; but the Sung accomplished this feat only by enlisting the aid 
of the Juchen tribes, which proceeded to occupy the former Liao territor;es themselves. 
The dynasty they created, the Chin, lasted from 1115 to 1234. 
The greatest of the alien victories over the Chinese, however, was that. of the Mongols, 
a hose Yuan dynasty, established in 12S0, controlled Chinese territory in its entirety until 
13f37. The :\longols, like all of the alien groups contending for power in China through this 
pei iod, were nomads, and the issue at stake between them and the Chinese was never merely 
that of who was to govern vertain territories. There was always the further issue as to how 
to reconcile two entirely different social tied economic systems. The Mongols early recog-
nized, however, that if they tried to impose their system upon all phases of Chinese life, 
e.g. to destroy the sedentary egrarian pattern of the economy, they would be attempting 
the impossible. They accordingly permitted the Chinese to retain most of the features of 
their native culture, and had, in the face of Chinese resistance, to content themselves with 
dominating only the topmost elites of the Chinese social structure, particularly the Con-
fucianist scholars. For, as it turned out, the central role of the literati and the bureaucracy 
in Chinese soc'ety made the hitter easy to control from outside if the outsider was wise 
enough to have the Confucianist scholars operate the government along traditional bureau-
cratic lines, and confine his own activity to the making of important. policy decisions. The 
Mongols did just that, thus making the most, for their own purposes, both of China's 
authoritarian tradition and of the fact that the masses were accustomed to being goverued 
by tit( Confucianist elite. As for the scholar class itself, it appears to have been reasonably 
satisfied with this arrangement and the career opportunities its members enjoyed under it. 
It showed, in any case, no inclination to rebel, and there were no other organized elements 
in Chinese society that could serve as centers of positive opposition to the regime. 
In a word: the outsiders, the Mongols and others as well, discovered that by preserving 
and inahs? . .. heg, China's traditional system of government and controlling only over-all 
policy at the top, they cetild tleminate China with relatively small forces and a minimum 
of difficulty. lit general, the alien rulers prohibited internoirriage between their own people 
and the Chinese, and attempted to preserve intact both sultures. They did, however, 
adopt sonic Chineee idene and practices, and in rare instances forced the Chinese, RS a token 
(if their euherdinatien to the cenquerors, to modify some of their customs. For example, 
the alien rulers were oldiged to !yam the Chinese written lane,uage in ordei to control the 
adioinistrative apparatus at their disposal, and in doing so were unavoidably influenced by 
Chinese forms of thought..

Yuan Dynasty (12?,90 to 1367) 
The most spectacularly successful of the alien dynasties, as indicated above, was the 
Mongol or Yuan dynasty. During the latter part of the Sung dynasty, some scattered 
tribes in the part of Mongolia that is today under Russian influence formed a union that 
was to develop, with the passing of time, one of the most remarkable armies of all history. 
Both the union and the army were the handiwork of the Mongol leader Temuchin, later to 
be known as Chinghis Khan (Jenghiz Khan). Chinghis, once his army was ready, turned 
his face to the south, where he conquered successively what was left of the lIsi Ileia and the 
Western Liao peoples. Afterwards he struck out into Central Asia on the eempaign that 
was to carry him, eventually, to Poland arid to the very gates of Vienna. In China itself, 
he followed up his early victories by conquering tirst the Chin and then the Southern Sung, 
thus making the Mongols rulers of all China. 
In 1259, power in the China area of the Moegol domains fell to a leader named Khubilai 
Khan, who was destined to complete the conqUi st and occupation of China. Like the earlier 
aliee rulers, he supported the interests of the Confucianist scholar class, and used its mem-
bers to restore the traditional Chinese pattern of centralized government. 
Under the Yuan, the centralized Chinese state came once again to dominate all the 
peripheral regions of Asia. This, together with the extension of the Mongol Empire into 
Eastern Europe, brought all the ancient trade Imo, wider Mongol control, which in turn 
greatly stimulated contacts between East and West. These were the days when Marco 
Polo made his famed trip to China, and went home to tell Europe of its splendor, its wonders, 
and its cultural achievements. 
The Mongol empire was, however, short-lived. Iihubilfti Klan himself spent much of 
its power on unsuccessful attempts at further conquest, the most disastrous being his two 
expeditions against Japan, each of Nrhich ended in failure when the Mongol invasion fleets 
were destroyed by a typhoon. After Khubilai's death in 1294, the Mongol Empire steadily 
declined, although the Ytian dynasty survived until 1367. The final years of Mongol rule 
in China were years of grave economic difficulties, partly resulting from the government's 
failure to maintain certain services that no agrarian economy can do without, and partly 
resulting from its attempts to cover excessive expenditures at court. by inflating the cur-
rency. At the end, its printed money was being a( opted only for tax payments, all other 
business being transacted either with bullion or with notes from private banks. 
Ming Dynas* (1368 to 1644) 
The Yban dynasty lived its last years on borrowed time, in the ense that a series of 
revolts occurred which, if they had been coordinated, would probably have destroyed 
Mongol power in China well before 367. The man who finally brought it low was Chu 
Yuan-chang, a peasant by origin, who was successively a Buddhist monk, leader of a bandit 
band, a soldier, and leader of olie of the armies rebelling against the Mongols. In the latter 
capacity, he early displayed a remarkable talent for organization. By 1364, four years 
before the downfall of the Yuan, he was in control of the central Yangtze region of China, 
and was styling, himself the Prince of Wu. In 1365, having driven the Yuan court from its 
capital near modern Peking, he established the Ming dynasty, and chose Nanking as its 
capital. 
Ming power reached its highest point in the reign of Yung Lo (1403 to 1424). Ile 
moved the capital to Peking, where many of his grandiose public alio stand. Among 
other things, he rebuilt the Yun Ile (Grand Canal) to facilitate e a.in shipments from the

patronage of literature helped to restore the prestige of the Confucianist scholars, for the 
projects he sponsored not only gave employmens to many of them, but also reawakened 
interest in the tradition of which they were the embodiment. 
The Ming military imeeerees exceeded those of any Chinese dynasty since the rang. 
Even so, they were ne. :copen the overland trade routes through the Northwest, and 
Chinese trade, in consequence, flourished during their reign in the area. of Southeast Asia. 
For the first time in its history, China now developed enough seapo- wer to enable it to send 
its ships as far West as the Arabian Sea. Court-sponsored expeditions explored the Indies, 
and crossed the Indian Ocean to Ceylon. Much Ming trade followed the pattern of the 
earlier overland trade, however, in at least, this respect: imports were regarded as tribute 
from overseas areas to the Chinese court, and exports as gifts from the Emperor to vassal 
peoples. 
Chinese Caner p1 of Suzerainty 
The idea that foreign trade was an exchange of "tribute" against "gifts" was a corollary 
of the Chinese concept of suzerainty. China, according to this concept, was the center of 
the world, and its Imperial Court held sway over all neighboring peoples. The latter, 
though (in the Chinese view) such lowly barbarians that they could not appreciate the 
splendors and superiority of Chinese culture, naturally turned to China for guidance and 
instruction. Thus, while other kingdoms indeed existed, their monarchs could claim legiti-
macy only if their rule was sanctioned by the Chinese emperor. (As early as the rang 
dynasty, the Japanese emperor was granted a seal from the Chinese court which alone, in 
Chinese view, gave him the right to govern the Japanese islands.) 
The Chinese did not conceive of suzerainty as a matter of exact legal relationships. 
They thought of it, rather, as involving relationships comparable to those within a family. 
The Chinese Emperor was father or at least elder brother to the lesser peoples, whose natural 
role was to accept the blessings of Chinese civilization and, at the same time, those of 
Chinese political and social ideas. On the other hand, the vassal countries were to pay 
homage to the Chinese Throne and, in general, defer to the wishes of the Chinese Emperor, 
though beyond this their internal affairs were not China's responsibility. In time of war. 
China would go to their aid, as it would expect them to rally to the defense of the Chinese 
Throne if this were needed. 
During the early period, when Asia was relatively isolated and China clearly its domi-
nant power, this concept was well-suited to the needs of the area. After the advent of 
Western sea power to China's coasts and the introduction of Western notions of interna-
tional law, it rendered unavoidable a series of conflicts between the Western powers and 
China. The West felt that China's claim to dominion over its neighbors made it responsible 
for their actions as well as its own; or, to put it the other way around, if China were not 
responsible for its neighbors' actions then it had no claim to dominion over them, and the 
West should have a free hand in dealing with them. The Chinese, in the Western view, 
claimed jurisdiction over the surrounding nations only when it was to their own benefit 
to do so, and disclaimed all responsibility for them when this was the more convenient course 
to follow. 
In the nineteenth century, accordingly, the Western powers repeatedly clashed with 
China over such areas as Korea, Atinarn, Indo-China, Chinese Turkestan, and the Liu Ch'iu 
or Ryukyu Islands-- all of them, as it happened, areas in which China, with its scant 
military power, was in no position to uphold its claims against a third party. It is, however, 
question-begging to infer from this that the Chinese claims were empty: before the advent 
of Western power China's position with respect to all the areas mentioned had been one of 
11 
great influence, and one whose maintenance had seldom required the exercise of military 
power or any other form of force or coercion. It is significant., in this connection, that 
Chinese governmental organization left the conduct of foreign affairs to the Ministry of 
Rites or Ceremonies, on the grounds that the most important aspect of foreign affairs was 
the performance of the correct. ceremonies of homage to the Emperor, by the representatives 
of foreign peoples. For both the Chinese and the border people these ceremonies formalized 
the acceptance by the non-Chinese of a dependent status in both cultural and political 
relationships. The non-Chinese, furthermore, regarded this dependent- status as both 
honorable and privileged, in general, that is to say, they had no quarrel with the Chinese 
concept of suzerainty. 
Ch'ing Dynasty (1644 to 1911) 
During the last years of the Ming dynasty the Imperial Court was confronted with the 
traditional problems of internal disorder, aggravated by continued mismanagement of 
affairs of state plus the new problem of defending the Not th against the rising power of the 
Manchu tribes. It gradually became evident that the Ming could not marshal sufficient 
power to defend themselves against either their internal and external enemies, especially 
since their efforts to defend theinselves led to higher taxation and merely increased the 
number of internal enemies. Toward the very end, which was hastened by a ser;es of 
famines, there were major revolts by organized bands of brigands. The most powerful 
of the rebels was Li Tzil-ch'eng, who captured Peking in 1642. The last Ming Emperor 
hanged himself in despair as the city fell. 
A Chinese general on the northeastern frontier, Wu San-kuei, promptly joined forces 
with the Manchus, and set out to destroy the armies of Li Tza-ch'6%. In this he was 
successful, but the Manchus had hardly advanced south of the Great Wall when they 
turned on Wu San-kuei and drove him into Yunnan Province. From there in subsequent 
years, he launched forays against the Ch'ing government. But he was finally reduced to 
impotence. 
The Manchus, even before entering China, had adopted many of the fundamental 
features of the Chinese system of government, and had established a dynasty called the 
Ch'ing. Having defeated the remaining Ming forces, they moved their government to Peking, 
and in 1644 they proclaimed the Ch'ing dynasty the legitimate government of all China. 
The Ch'ing, like the earlier alien dynasties, mobilized the Confucianist scholars behind their 
regime. In the initial years, to be sure, many of the scholars resisted the inducements offered 
by the Ch'ing, but most of them finally bowed to the necessity of cooperating with their 
Manchu rulers. 
The Manchus soon became as adept as the Mongols had been at turning the Chinese 
tradition to their own purposes. Two of the Ch'ing emperors, Wang Ilsi and Ch'ien Lung, 
are remembered among the greatest individual rulers ever to mount the ChineseThrone. 
Both achieved a mastery of Chinese classics and Chinese scholarship that placed them on a 
footing of scholarly equality with the leading Chinese Confucianists of their day. 
Under the Ch'ing dynasty as under previous alien dynasties Chinese institutions and 
customs, most particularly traditional patterns of government, remained virtually intact. 
In one important respect, however, the Ch'ing did not imitate the Mongol precedents: they 
saw to it that the key positions, both in government and society, were occupied by Manchus, 
and maintained an elaborate machinery of discriminations, ranging from the petty to the 
critical, as guarantees that these positions were not reoccupied by Chinese. The important 
political decisions, especially those in which the security of the Manchu Imperial House 
was involved, were thus made by Manchus.

During the reigns of K'ang Hsi (1661-1722) and Ch'ien Lung (1736-1796), the Ch'ing 
reclaimed for China all of the territories traditionally a.ssociat43 with the Chinese Empire, 
and established suzerainty over the remote regions of what at_e now Russian Turkestan, 
Eastern Siberia, Korea, Nepal, Burma, Annam, and the Malay'Peninsula. Chinese power 
became supreme throughout eastern Asia. The Ch'ing government also, in this great early 
period, administered China's internal affairs with notable efficiency. The death of Ch'ien 
Lung appears to have been the turning-point. The subsequent history of the Ch'ing regime 
reveals a rapid decline both in its power and in its grasp of China's problems. When the 
threat of Western seapower began to make itself felt, China found itself, in consequence, 
in an extremely weak position. 
The early Ch'ing period is also noted for its achievements in literature and art. It 
produced little that was original or creative in either field, but its criticism, both literary 
and artistic, was of a high order of excellence, and it performed well, from the standpoint 
of the Chinese tradition, such subordinate but important chores as collecting and cataloging 
the great, works of the past. This was the period, for example, when Chinese scholars first 
began to use rigorous methods in testing the authenticity of the ancient classical works. 
The Advera of the Weg 
As has been mentioned, Chinese relations with the West date back as ,far as the Han 
dynasty, in the sense that then, as in subsequent periods of great imperial power, the Chinese 
had lirnited vulturel and commercial contacts with Westerners. As has also been mentioned, 
the overland routes through the northwest were the well-nigh exclusive avenues for these 
contacts. Thus the latter could be maintained without any risk to China's political power 
to be set off against the considerable profit, in terms both of wealth and knowledge, derived 
from them. They were, in short, a matter of Chinese power pushing out toward Europe, 
rather than European power pushing out toward China. 
The sixteenth and r-ievente,enth centuries initiated a marked change in this regard: 
Western seapower began now to explore the Eastern world, and Western ships began to 
put in along the South China coast. The Chinese suddenly faced a situation in which the 
routes to and from the West were not largely under their own control. At first, neverthe-
less, they welcomed the new routes, on the assumption, apparently, that they meant merely 
expanded opportunities for mutually beneficial trade. As the number of Portuguese ships 
putting in to China increased, however, and brought in their wake Spanish, Dutch. and 
(by the end of the eighteenth century) British ships, the Chinese were obliged to reeognize 
that this was by no means a matter of more of a good thing being better than less of it. 
The ships, what with the development of Western armament in the course of these centuries, 
brought Western military power to the very doors of China; they could, for example, over-
whelm the local coastal defenses at any point along the China coast. Nor was it long before 
the Western traders who came by sea were taking advantage of this new, coercive element 
in the situation. The day came, in fact, when much of the "trade" conducted by the 
Portuguese was little more than open piracy; they were in the business of plundering towns 
along the Chinese coasts and reselling the loot where they could. 
Another disturbing factor in this relatively sudden advent of the West, from the Chinese 
point of view, was the active penetration of China by Christian missionaries. Initially, the 
latter were well received, e.g., to mention the most important, the Jesuit, Matteo Ricci, 
who came to the Portuguese-controlled town of Macao in 1582 and had made his way to 
Peking by 1601. He and his companions were not only well treated, but were looked on 
iaith favor at the Ming court. After the fall of the Ming, moreover, and despite their having 
lent assistance to the Ming in their resistance to the Manchu invasion, they won the confi-

dence of the Ch'ing. The turning-point, nevertheless, came during the early years of 
Ch'ing rule, when the Ch'ing found themselves with a considerable influx of members of 
other orders on their hands and, worse still, discovered that the representatives of the Church 
could not even get along with one another. The tendency of the different orders to carry 
their disputes to the dope in Rome for settlement appeared to the Chinese court as an inva-
sion of China's internal sovereignty. It finally 'began, therefore, to discourage all Christian 
missionary activity, and by 1721, Emperor K'ang Hsi had issued the famed edicts prohibit-
ing foreigners from engaging not only in missionary activity but in other activities as well 
The Chinese government, in short, gradually became aware of the dangers, from its 
point of view, of Western penetration of its territory, and set out to minimize these dangers 
by placing restrictions on Chinese-Western relations. Its position thus changed from one of 
notable tolerance toward foreigners and their doings to one of open intolerance, which 
expressed itself in strict regulations and controls. By the middle of the eighteenth century, 
China had constructed the equivalent of a Great Wall around its sea approaches by for-
bidding foreigners to enter the country or even establish contact with it at any point except 
Macao and Canton. 
On one side, at least, the new policy failed of its purpose and ultimately defeated it. 
For one thing, Canton was soon flourishing as a trading center. At first, to be sure, Western 
traders were up against the difficulty that while China had much that the West prized, the 
Chinese had great sales resistance to Western products. For a time, therefore, it was a 
matter, roughly speaking, of exchanging Western silver and gold for Chinese silk and tea. 
But this soon changed. The Western traders discovered that by buying opium in India 
and selling it in China, they could not only foot the bill for their purrhazes in China, hut 
actually run up a favorable balance that the Chinese had to meet in bullion. The end 
result was an actual intensification of Western-Chinese trade relations, i.e. the reveaie of 
what Chinese policy had intended, plus two further and entirely unexpected evils: a tre-
mendous drain on China's supply of silver, and a vast increase in the consumption of opium 
by Chinese. The Chinese government, rather more than less tardily than seems logical, 
in retrospect, responded to all this by putting further harriers in the way of Western-
Chinese trade. 
A further source of tension developed first in the Canton trade. The Chinese govern-
ment had, among other things, limited all trade with the West to a group of Chinese mer-
chants known as the Co-hongs. This, in the view of the Western merchants, denied them 
access to many potentially profitable customers, and to this complaint they soon added a 
further one about the Co-hongs themselves. Some of the latter went bankrupt, and the 
Western traders took the position that the Chinese government, since it had given them a 
monopoly of all commerce with the West, should itself assume the debts of the bankrupts. 
Other grievances, real or alleged, developed as time passed. The Western traders disliked 
the regulations restricting their movements within the city of Canton, as also the regula-
tions forbidding them to bring firearms or women into the city and, finally, those governing 
the construction work they might undertake there. Lastly, mention must be made of the 
mounting tension over the differences between Chinese and Western law, the foreigners' 
increasingly vocal contention that if they submitted to Chinese law they could not expect 
justice, and, most important of all, Britain's attempt, greatly resented by the Chinese, to 
regularize relations with China by prevailing on the latter to adopt Western diplomatic 
practices and Western notions about international law. The British felt, from their own 
point of view quite naturally, that the problems in and about Canton would disappear if 
the Imperial Court would extend "diplomatic recognition" to Britain, and decree that all 
controversies between Western traders (many of the leading ones were British) should be

resolved in accordance with recognized principles of international (i.e. Western). law. The 
Chinese, from their point of view quite naturally also, could make no sense either of the 
notion of recognizing Britain as en equal or of Western concepts of international law. China, 
in their view, was now as in the past the center of the civilized world; instead of making 
presumptuous and ill-mannered demands for an equality that had no basis in fact the 
British, the Chinese felt, should be demonstrating their deference to the Chinese Throne. 
The tension between the British and the Chinese finally culminated in the First Opium 
War (1840), which resulted in the decisive British victory formalized by the Treaty of 
Nanking of 1842. The Chinese were forced by this treaty to acquiesce in the British demands 
for diplomatic equality, to violin five additional trading ports, to cede Hong Kong to Britain, 
to abolish the special trading privileges of the Co-horees, to assume the Co-hong& debts, 
to pay an indemnity, and to promise that all future tariffs would be based upon published 
schedules and not left to arbitrary determination by local Chinese officials. 
The Treaty of Nanking opened a new period in the relations of China to the West, 
during which the central issue was to be the question of treaty rights and obligations. In 
1844 the American government signed a treaty with China that guaranteed to American 
citizens tandiinr with China all the rights enjoyed by British traders and established the 
so-called principle of extraterritoriality, according to which Americans in China would be 
bound by American not Chinese law. The European countries were soon signing treaties 
with China vouchsafing to their nationals also the benefits secured in the British treaties. 
Before long, moreover, all treaties were embodying a "most favored nation" clause, by 
which China guaranteed to the signatory, in advance, any benefits that it might see fit to 
grant to any other nation. No longer could China effectively use the power of granting 
concessions to "play off one barbarian against another." A favor extended to one was a 
favor extended automatically to all. 
It was not until 1858 and 1860, when Britain and France applied further military 
pressure on China, that the Chinese fully accept the eyenen of treaty relations whose 
main features have been noted in the preceding paragraphs, and which, with one further 
refinement, was to deprive China of certain of the prerogatives of a sovereign state through 
a period of several decades. having opened anecia.1 ports for foreign trade, China next 
foimd itself confronted with a demand for "concessions," i.e. special areas in leading Chinese 
cities where administration was to he in the hands of foreign states. This was, to be sure, 
merely a further detraction from Chinese legal power over foreign nationals within Chinese 
territory along the lines of the "principle" of extraterritoriality, but it was to have far-
reaching effects, partieularly as regards Chinese attitudes toward the West and toward 
Westerners. In the end, China even lost control over its own tariff schedules and its own 
Customs Service. And, needles to say, those who negotiated the treaties that underlay 
the complicated array of treaty arrangements did not, forget to write into them clauses 
protecting foreign religious and philanthropic organisations. 
It cannot lie denied that the treaties here in question conferred certain benefits on 
China: e.g., they served to stabilize the Ch'ing government. By the end of the nineteenth 
century, however, large numbers of Chinese were convinced, that, to say the least, these 
benefits were inadequate compensation for the dieadvantages and humiliation attached to 
western control over various aspects of the nation's life. China's mood became increasingly 
rebellious. After the Revolution of 1911, the Nationalists were to turn their more or less 
latent antagonism against the West, and to demand, as a basic feature of their program, 
complete elimination of what they termed the "unequal treaties." The Chinese were to 
contend that, on the very showing of Western international law itself, it was intolerable for 
their govenaneet, supposedly sovereign and thus entitled to diplomatic equality with all 
104 
.11000101affilliriamor. '-???????.?????? 
other governments, to remain permanently bound by a set of treaties dictated under coer-
cion and clearly calculated to place China in an inferior position in the society of nations. 
The West was to turn a deaf ear to this entire line of argument. The weakness of the Chi-
nese government and its indifference to Western principles of law and justice, the West 
was to insist, rendered maintenance of the treaties absolutely necessary as means of pre-
serving condition of reasonable safety for foreign nationals in China. 
Internal Developments During the Ch'ing Dynasty 
By the middle of the nineteenth century, i.e. the very time when the West was forcing 
its demands on China, the Ch'ing government had aleeady been seriously weakened by the 
forces of disintegration that had plagued earlier Chinese dynasties-- e.g., declining standards 
of honesty and performance within the bureaucracy, which foreigners and Chinese alike 
regarded as corrupt, a growing economic crisis, especially in agriculture, and a general 
accumulation of basic problems beyond the governments' power or capacity to solve. 
These problems were intensified and complicated by the far-reaching changes being 
initiated in China under Western influence. These were in part the result of the Westerners' 
having brought with them new and revolutionary ideas in runny fields, in part a matter of 
what the Chinese were beginning to learn about Western technology, and in part a matter 
of the Chinese themselves coming to feel that China should adopt or imitate many features 
of Western civiFzation. Issues had arisen that would affect China's development through 
many decades, and that would divide Chinese society as it had never been divided before. 
Roughly speaking, they added up to one major problem, namely, that, of how far China 
was to go in sloughing off its traditional practices and ideas. This problem was specially 
acute for the Chinese intellectuals. For, though it was obvious that the answer would be 
determined by a multitude of forces that lay beyond the control of any single group of 
Chinese, the intellectuals could not sidestep their obligation to decide individually what 
forces to support, and how vigorously to support them. 
Until the early years of the twentieth century, most leading Chinese thinkers believed 
a solution could be found that would enable China to incorporate merely the technological 
aspects of Western culture, while maintaining the values and attitudes toward life and 
human relations that tradition had handed down. In the laet years of the Ch'ing dynasty, 
the Chinese government, struck by the example of Japan (which was rapidly adopting the 
Western technology and the Western emphasis on industrialization, but at the same time 
redoubling its glorification of such basic Japanese institutions /LS the Emperor and the 
Japanese Weltanschauung), tried to develop similar plans for China. Japan, in other words, 
became an officially recognized model for the future evolution of China. Large numbers of 
Chinese students crossed over to Japan, many of them generously financed by the govern-
ment, to observe the Japanese experiment at first hand; and not a few of them, either while 
in Japan or after their return, joined organizations bent on bringing about great reforms in 
China. A considerable percentage returned to China convinced that there was little hope 
for change under the Manchu government, and joined the revolutionary groups that were 
later to play an important role in the Revolution of 1911. 
China's growing trade with the West, now conducted via the varlet's Treaty Ports, 
was another factor making for change in Chinese society. Foreign traders now did busineas 
in China through middle men, or CUM pradores, who shortly 1)eca me one of the wealthiest 
groups in China, although the traditional attitudes relegated them, as merchants, to a 
lowly rung of the social hierarchy. The latter fact in itself would presumably have mobilized 
them against the traditional order, and would have made titem inGfe susceptible than other 
Chinese to Western notions. Also, however, considerations of economic advantage dis-

posed them to support the interests of the foreign groups, and to become a &nit of bridge 
between China and the outside world. 
They became, in any ease, an important center of opposition to the mandarin or 
scholar-official group in Chinese eociety. Their opposition was, to be sure, unorganized, and 
only a few of them had, strictly speaking, strong political convictions or objectives. But 
they undoubtedly ontributed to the weakening of the old order. 
There were, of course, other economic consequences of the expanded foreign trade 
besides the rise of a new merchant class. The large coastal cities became- increasingly 
dependent upon rereign commerce, and, with the pleasing of time, the interior of China 
similarly dependent upon the port cities. China, meantime, was making slow progress in 
the field of industrialization, which in China as elsewhere was confined to the cities, where 
initial plants were built for the manufacture of light consumers' goods. The cities also 
became, in China as elsewhere, the well-nigh exclusive source of credit, both developments 
taking place on a scale large enough to create a new relationship between the cities and the 
agrarian countryside. Industrialization helped undermine the tiaditional self-sufficient 
economy of the peasants; the city-based, nationwide market for credit provided the institu-
tional base for a continued expansion of the debt-burden of Chinese agriculture, now as ever 
unprodurth-e and coneequently unremunerative. 
The Imperial Government had neither the power nor the capacity to deal effectively 
with these problems. According to the traditional view, however, government was respon-
sible for the well-being of the masses, who V4' wild one day hold the government accountable 
for what was happening to them. 
Rebellions Against the Ch'ing 
By the middle of the nineteenth century the Ch'ing government faced the two-fold 
problem, then, of mounting external pressures exerted by foreign powers and a rising tide 
of internal revolts. 
The most far-reaching of these rebellions was the T'ei-p'ing movement, which had its 
origins in the ht' ?n By 1854 it had gained control of much of Central China, 
and had established a capital at Nanking. Before it was suppressed in 1865, its armies had 
penetrated deep into North China and threatened to capture not only Tientsin but the 
Imperial capital at Peking as well. The central personality in the movement was a Chinese 
student named !lung ilsiu-ch'iian, who had been unsuccessful in the Imperial examinations. 
Ile may well have suffered fron mental delusions, though this is not certain. He did, 
however, exploit the dissatisfaction of the agrarian population of Kwangsi le, asserting that 
he had been selected by God himself to establish "His kingdom on earth." The ideological 
basis of the movement was thus a peculiar blending of peasant frustration, anti-Manchu 
sentiment, and (flung is known to have been influenced by a Christian missionary) warped 
and tangled snatches of Christian teachings. 
The defeat of the T'ai-p'ing armies was finally accomplished by peasant militia recruited 
for the purpose by such Chinese leaders as Tseng Kuo-fan and Li I lung-chang, who despite 
not being military men (both were bureaucrats), had received mandates from the Throne 
to suppress the rebels. (Tw) of the armies that took the field against the rebels were led 
by foreigners: the American Frederick 'I'. Ward and the Englishman ('harks "Chinese" 
Gordon.) The government's success in routing the rebels was, however, dearly won, and 
not merely brenuse raising the necessary armies had put a severe tax on its resources. For 
the rebellion had reduced the resoureea themselves. The Val-Wings had controlled most 
of the nal ion's important agrieulturai areae for several years, thus depriving the government 
106

? 
of huge tax revenues. And the last phase of the war had so devastated the richest part of 
China that the government could count on no revenues from it for many years to come. 
There were several other nineteenth century revolts against the Manchu regime. All 
of them, it should be noticed, developed in the peripheral area of the Empire, and testified 
to the gradual but nevertheless steady weakening of the central government.' 
Foreign Pressures on the Ch'ing Dynasty 
By the middle of the century there were many visible signs that the Manchu dynasty 
was rapidly losing its power to govern China. The Western powers, however, were slow 
to recognize its decline, and thus missed its implications as to the rational course for them 
to pursue. At the very time the rai-p`ing Rebellion was sweeping through Central China 
and seemed most invincible, for example, the British and French were dispatching armed 
forces to extract further concessions from the Manchu government, and to impress the 
obstinate Manchu court with the necessity of ratifying the Treaties of 1858 (under which 
formal diplomatic reletions were to be established at the Chinese capital). 
But the concessions that the Western Powers wrung from the Chinese through t.he 
application of seapower and military strength seem, in retrospect, less important, as far 
as the long-term effects on China were concerned, than the gradual imperialistic advance 
of Russian land power into Chinese territories during the same period. Until Western 
gunboats had exposed China's military weakness for all the world to see, the Chinese had 
been highly successful in withstanding pressure on their land frontiers. Thus, for example, 
the first treaty between a Chinese court and an important European power, that negotiated 
between China and Russia at Nerchinsk in 1689, clearly reflected the fact that Chinese 
power was equal to Russian. The Chinese not only made in it no concessions like those 
embodied in the later treaties with the sea-powers; they obliged the Russians to retract 
their initial demands, obtained the disputed Amur River boundary, and got the Russians 
to agree to the northern watershed of the Amur River as the boundary between Manchuria 
and Siberia. 
Even during the early years of the nineteenth century, when Russian explorers eats.b-
lished settlements and colonies along the Pacific coast of northeast Asia and moved south-
ward as far as the Amur River, the Peking government, despite numerous clashes between 
Cossack bands and Manchu troops, did not (and had no immediate reason to) view the 
growing power of Russia in Asia with serious concern. But as the conflicts developed 
between the Chinese and the British and French in the eighteen-forties and -fifties, the 
Russians began, unobtrusively at first, to make demands on the Ch'ing government?
always by stepping forward as "honest brokers" who, in return for such and such a con-
sideration, were prepared to help persuade the sea powers to reduce their demands. This 
sugar-coating made the concessions China granted to the Tsarist government seem less 
onerous and dangerous than those granted to the other Western Powers, but they were 
none the less costly for that. In 1858, for ceample, when the Western Powers were attempt-
ing to secure a revision of the treaties signed in the forties, the Russians succeeded in nego-
tiating the Treaty of Aig-un, which redefined the Russo-Chinese boundary to follow the 
Amur River as far as the Cssuri River and beyond that point left it undefined. 
Two years later, when the British and French expeditions moved on 'Tientsin and 
Peking to enforce the ratification of the treaties of 1858, the Russians were able to secure a 
further agreement from the Chinese court, under which all the territories to the east of the 
Ussuri became a part of the Russian Empire. Through these agreements cc all of them, 
to be sure, obtained without the direct application of force -- the Russians gained control 
of the present-day Maritime Provinces and the port of Vladivostok. In the end, the Rus-

and Russian influence was making itself felt both in Korea and in Manchuria. 
:Even while the European powers were forcing concessions from the Manchu 
govern-
ment and rebellions were sweeping over China, it was widely felt, that the weakness of China 
was only temporary, and that one day the "sleeping dragon" would awaken and show great 
strength. It. was only with the amazing triumphs of the Japanese over the Chinese in the 
war of 1894-5 that. the world realized that the Celestial Empire might collapse. 
The Sino-Japanese War of 1894-5, which arose over Sino-Japanese competition for 
influence in Korea, actually decided several different and much broader issues. The rapid 
victory of the Japanese clearly dereonatratc-d not only that the island empire had success-
fully incorporated many aepecta of Western culture and built up formidable military power, 
but also that China would have to abdicate its role as the leading Far Eastern Power. The 
world, including China, little realized that it was witnessing the first phase of what was to 
develop into a sustained expansion of Japanese imperialiem on the continent of Asia. 
By the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which terminated the conflict, China lost Taiwan and 
the Pescadores to Japan, and had to pay an indemnity for the cost of the war. A further 
Japanese demand, cession of the Liaotung territory in southern Manchuria, went by the 
board when Russia, supported by Germany and France, intervened to prevent its being 
pressed. This "Triple Intervention" was motivated, however, not so much by a concern 
to protect China as by a determination to check Japan, and prevent its pre-empting areas 
of the Chinese Empire where the Russians had a special interest. The intervention of the 
three powers made it clear that while the Ch'ing government was now incapable of defend-
ing itself, there was still hope for the maintenance of the integrity of Chinese territories 
insofar as the other interested powers balanced and neutralized one another. 
It was also clear, however, that China would henceforth be powerless to prevent further 
inroads of Japaneee and Russian influe e in the Chinese territory of Manchuria ? that 
the struggle for control of the area wouln oe fought out between Japan and Russia, without 
any third or fourth power to balance them. In 1896 Russia obtained from China the right 
to build the Chinese. Eastern Railroad across Manchuria, to connect the Trans-Siberian 
Railroad with Vladivostok. Two years later, when China was being forced to grant con-
cessions to certain European powers, Russia obtained from China a lease on the Liaotung 
territory, including Port Arthur and Dairen, thus acquiring the very territory it had been 
instrumental in denying to Japan. Over the next years, moreover, Russia's behavior left 
no doubt as to the seriousness of its expansionist intentions. The building of the South 
Manchuria Railroad, to connect Port Arthur to the Chinese Eastern Railroad, was only the 
most conspicuous example of the growth of Russian interests in that area. 
Meanwhile Japan, besides actively developing its stake ie Kneen, was expanding its 
economic activities in Manchuria; indeed the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5 was a result 
of the clash between Japanese and Russian interests in precisely sle...et area. Japan again 
surprised the world by defeating a far larger country than itself, and under the terms of the 
Treaty of Portsmouth, which terminated the war, Japan replaced Russia in the Liaotung 
territory, assumed control of the South Manchuria Railroad, and obtained the southern 
half of Sakhalin Island. From this time until 1917 Manchuria was to be roughly divided 
into a Japanese sphere of influence in the south and a Russian sphere in the north. After 
the Ruasian Revolution, however, Russian influence entered upon a long period of decline. 
There was a brief revival of Russian preNlyairp in the ninptppn twpntipaa, hut it was Isresk 
ght 
to an end by the Japanese occupation of Manchuria in 1931. Russia, nevertheless, was to 
win out once again: itipan's defeat in the Second World War eliminated it as a factor in 
Manchuria, and under the Yalta agreement the United States . . ??4* t.? ? ? ?

rights, agreed to restore Russia to the pt.miticsn Gf derninanee in Maecheris that it had 
enjoyed before 1905. 
Japan and Russia were not the only countries to recognize China's weakness after the 
defeat of 1895, and to put pressure on it for further concessions. In fact., each of the leading 
European powers sought to establish claims to one segment or another of the crumbling 
Empire, and by 1898 the Ch'ing government found itself obliged to grant major territorial 
concessions to several of them. Germany obtained the port of Tsingtao, and rights to 
build railroads in and develop the resources of the province of Shantung. (Russia, as we 
have seen, obtained Port Arthur and Dairen.) The British leased the port of Wei-hai-wei, 
and staked out claims to a sphere of influence in the Yangtze Valley. France exacted a 
concession for the harbor of Kwangehowan, and a promise from the Chinese government 
that it would not concede rights in the Southwest provinces without giving the French the 
refusal of them. The Japanese spoke for the province of Fukien if and when the Chinese 
Empire were to be divided among foreign powers. 
One result of this rapidly accelerating partition of Chinese territories was the announce-
ment by the United States government in 1900 of its "Open Door" policy for China. The 
Americans, with the active encouragement of Great Britain, sought to obtain promises 
from the interested powers that they would allow all other powers equal trading rights in 
their special "spheres of influence" in China. The other powers did not by any means 
unanimously accept the principle of the "Open Door" in the same spirit, or define it. in the 
same manner as the Americans. But the declaration did have the effect of at least momen-
tarily checking the partition of China among foreign posers. The desire of each power to 
prevent others from obtaining excessive advantage had now been reenforced by the declared 
policy of the United States to oppose any compromise of the equal trading rights in China. 
Ever since it enunciated the "Open Door" policy, the United States has followed a 
policy of seeking to preserve the independenee of the Chinese government and people. At 
times American policy has perhaps not actually forwarded this objective, but the record 
of the American government in defense of the independence of China should commend itself 
to the Chinese beyond that of any other power. 
The Revolution of 1911 
h:umerous elements within China followed the lead of the foreign powers in recognizing 
that the Manchu dynasty had fallen upon evil days. Most particularly, many Chinese 
were shocked by their defeat at the hands of Japan in 1893 into realizing that China would 
now have to strengthen its government and "Westernize" litany features of its society. The 
Japanese victory sent large numbers of Chinese students off to the enemy country in an 
effort to learn how the Japanese had been able, in such a short period of time, to raise their 
nation to the position of the strongest power in Asia. The Japanese victory over a non-
Asiatic nation, Russia, further streegthened this trend. Many who went to study in Japan 
and in other overseas areas returned home convinced that China would have to rid itself 
of the Manchu government, and began to organize for revolutionary purposes. 
The Imperial government set out, however tardily, to strengthen the Chinese nation 
and introduce some Western innovations. In 1898 for example, at the very moment when 
the West was pressing its most extreme demands upon the Ch'ing government, the imperial 
court, under the lead of a young emperor, began to issue a torrent of decrees whose objective 
was to "modernize" China and to lead, eventually, to a constitutional monarchy. The 
immediate effect of this "llundred Days of Reform," as the historians of China call it, was 
negligible, since the "reactionary" elements, under In diri,iliun of the Einpress DowaKer, 
Tz'il Hsi, soon regained control of the government and rescinded all the important decrees,

thus leaving the reform's sympathizers no alternative but to support the revolutionary 
groups abroad. But the Manchu leaders could at most postpone, not prevent, further 
conceasions to "modernization." 
By the time the Throne began to introduce programs looking to genuine change, how-
ever, the government was already too weak to carry out measures of the type called for. 
For one thing, opposition to the regime itself had become so endemic that no program it 
espoused could presaibly succeed. Worse still, the reform pregearas tended to weaken, not 
strengthen, the regime: China's first provincial assemblies, for example? when they were 
created as a first step toward China's first national assembly, promptly became centers of 
opposition to the Manchus. 
The opposition the Manchu government confronted at home, though powerful, was 
unorganized. But there was also an opposition abroad, which under the leadership of 
Sun Yat-.&n finally took shape as a genuine revolutionary party. First known as the 
Mtng Hui Outer called the Kuomintang or Nationalist Party), it was this party that 
tnntr the lead in demanding that the Manchu government be eliminated in favor of a republi-
can form of government. Sun Yat-sen did attempt to organize cells of the Party in China, and 
even directed several abortive attempts at. rebellion. But his main energies went to recruit-
ing followers and funds from the communities of Chinese living outside the country. 
It. with no coincidence, therefore, that when on Il October 1911, a bomb accidentally 
exploded in Flankow and ignited a revolution in China, the country's most persistent and 
famous advocate of revolutionary measures was abroad, thus in no position to influence 
directly, much less control, the subsequent course of events. Even the groups within China 
that had been planning to overthrow the regime were caught unprepared for the suddenness 
with which events moved their way, and had no choice but to come out in the open and seek 
to rally any and all individuEds and groups into a revolt against the Manchus. Concretely, 
the revolutionists found themselves receiving a great deal of assistance from elements that 
had previously been considered loyal to the government. The Imperial garrison at Flankow, 
for example, joined the rebels, and soon other garrisons in the Yangtze Valley were refusing 
to obey the order to march against the opponents of the Manchu government. Prominent 
among the latter, incidentally, were numerous leaders of finance and commerce who had 
been opposing the Throne's attempt to establish government-directed railroad and indus-
trial enterprises in Central China. 
By the time Sun Yat-sen was able to return to China, the success of the revolution was 
already assured. But it lied also become clear that Sun Yat-sen's followers were not to be 
its undisputed leaders. Nis, for that matter, was any other identifiable group. Rather the 
movement was to limp along without any coherent leadership, dissipating its energies on the 
negotiation of compromises among diverse groups whose only common ground was opposi-
tion to the Manchus. Different people, it became increasingly evident, had opposed the 
Manchus for different reasons, and then several purposes by no means added up to a definite 
program once the Emperor had abdicated. 
Among the more intelligent and thoughtful revolutionists, the best organized were the 
followers of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Even they lacked the unity and the power to carry through 
a definite program during the post-revolutionary period. They had accomplished their 
major objective, namely, to overthrow the Manchus and establish a republican form of 
government ; but they could not govern China. And the unavoidable result was that 
political power in China went, by default. into the hands of the eountry's military leaders. 
Even during the first days after the flankow incident, in point of fact, it became dear that 
the revolut ionarie:-; would have to rely to a considerable extent on military support if they 
were to force the :Manchus to abdicate and reunite China under a republican government. 
110 
? 
The support, of course, came at a price: concessions had to be made to the military leadersa. 
And concession followed concession until the military leaders had become the guiding power 
in the movement. 
Thus, when the time came to select the first president of the new republic, the members 
of the Kuomintang did not feel free to support the (for them) logical choice, Sun Yat-sen. 
Rather they found themselves obliged to help give the post to the strongest military leader 
in China, "Vitali Shih-k'ai. Chinese politics were to follow more or less this same pattern 
for the next two decades, with the military leaders dominating all forms of civilian politics, 
The Phantom Republic 
Yuan Shih-k'ai was president of the Chinese Republic from 1912 to 1916. He held the 
office, as his actions clearly showed, by virtue of his being the strongest military leader in 
the land, and before the end his personal power had achieved such proportions that he was 
planning to change his formal title from president to emperor of a new Chinese dynasty. 
The basic situation, meantime, was this: there was not enough support of republican institu-
tiene to permit the translation of the slogans of the revolution into living reality. The forces 
? wedded to the old order, on the other hand, were by no means powerful enough to ignore the 
demand for a more modernized system of rule. For a time, five years to be exact, Yuan 
Shih-k'ai's personal power barely sufficed to keep the issue from being drawn, and thus to 
hold together an inherently unstable situation. Then, shortly before his death (in June 1916) 
he himself drew it, or rather forced it, by taking steps to have himself declared emperor. 
For opposition to a strong central government and unwillingness to return to the old 
imperial pattern were at least deep-seated enough to make impossible what Yarin Shih-k'ai 
wanted to do. Revolts broke out at once in the peripheral areas, and by the time Yuan 
died they had spread throughout the southwestern provinces. 
With the passing from the scene of Yiian Shih-k'ai, China entered upon a period of 
straight warlord politics, during which the establishment of a strong centralized government 
was virtually out of the question. The various military leaders, each seeking to expand his 
personal power at the expense of the others, paid only formal allegiance to the Peking gov-
ernment. None was powerful enough by half to impose his will on the others. But no 
non-military leader was powerful enough to challenge the group of them as a whole, 
and demand an end to its monopoly of political authority. 
Now, as at earlier periods, China's ebvions weakness served as an open invitation to 
foreign powers with imperialist ambitions. The world balance of power, to be sure, operated 
to deny to any single country the complete control of China; but nothing at Peking stood 
in the way of such control, and even the balance of power did not suffice to prevent a single 
country, namely Japan, from emerging as a major and continuous threat to China's integrity. 
In 1915 that country had made its long-run intentions abundantly clear by presenting to 
the Chinese government the so-called "Twenty-one Demands," to some of which China had 
had no alternative but to agree. The entire list, had China been obliged to accept it, 
would have ridded up to complete mastery over China's political, economic, and social 
destiny, which world opinion, for the moment at least, had determined not to permit. In 
the end the Chinese government did accept some of the demands; but since even these .were 
14 rising title of anti Tapanese 
humiliating, their acceptance unavoidably prf.alticed r b l'1  
feeling. 
Both of China's major problems of the post-revolutionary period, ascendancy of the 
military at home and increasing imperialist pressure from abroad, were sharply accentuated 
by World War I and its sequelae. The Peking government, under pressure from the United 
States but after a good deal of hesitation and divided counsels, declared war on Germany ---

in the hope and expectation that it would he rewarded by Allied financial assistance., The 
mere fact of the country's being at war, of course, tended to strengthen the hand of the 
military leaders, and thus to weaken that of the democratic elements. (The Kuomintang 
faction in the government, under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen, recognizing this, soon de-
cided to break with Peking and try to set up a second government for China, to be located 
at Canton.) On the other hand, the Peking government promptly found itself in difficulties 
over the disposition of the German holdings and concessions in China, whose return to 
China it viewed as part of the reward it should receive for entering the war. Japan, how-
ever, had not only entered the war first but also had been instrumental in ousting the 
Germans from Tsingtao, and once the war was over entered its claim to the ex-German 
holdings. When, finally, news reached China that the Paris peace conference had recog-
nized the Japanese claim, the immediate result was an unprecedented mass protest against 
the government's evident powerlessness to defend Chinese interests. The Peking govern-
ment eventually succeeded in negotiating an agreement with Japan (in 1922), under which 
the Shantung conceasions would be returned to China upon payment to Japan of a sum to 
cover the costs incurred by Japan in "improving" the territories. The terms of the agree-
ment, plus the fact that China had to borrow the money from Japan itself to make the pay-
ment, further damaged the government in the eyes of the Chinese populace, and fanned the 
fires of mass indignation against japan. May fourth, the day of the Paris decision, has 
remained a day of "national humiliation" for China in both the Nationalist and the Com-
munist calendar. (In recent years, however, the Communists have emphasized the anni-
versary's importance as. a reminder of the treacherous deeds of the Western Powers and of 
the first popular movement against "imperialism.") 
The Washington Conference of 1921-2, held under the leadership of the United States 
with the avowed purpose, inter (ilia, of protecting China from further foreign encroachment, 
rounds oft this phase in Chinese foreign relations. Out of it came the bilateral agreement 
between China and Japan about the Shantung question, a Nine Power Treaty committing 
the signatories to respect the territorial and administrative integrity of China, and an 
agreement among the United States, Britain, and Japan on naval limitation and the con-
struction of military and naval bases in the Pacific. Under the terms of the naval agree-
ment, which was an Anglo-American attempt to convince japan that she had nothing to fear 
from foreign naval attack, the United States stood committed not to fortify or expand the 
naval stations west of Hawaii, and Great Britain not to fortify or expand its bases east of 
Singapore. The long-term result of these commitments was to render Japan relatively free 
to pursue aggressive policies against China ? with prior assurance that the British and 
American navies could not easily take any effective counteraction. 
The Rise of the Nationalists 
With the Peking government increasingly under the dereinetion of military leaders, 
and struggling to stave oft both moral and economic bankruptcy, the new government at 
Canton slowly built up a following. Sun Yat-sen performed a role much like that which he 
had performed before 1911: he collected funds and enlisted political support for a movement 
to eliminate a government that had clearly demonstrated its incapacity to rule China. The 
Canton government claimed to he the rightful heir of the 1911 Revolution and thus the 
only legal government of all China. Nevertheless, it was pretty much on a par with several 
other berm-autonomous governments in the provinces. 
Sun Yat-sen soon found himself involved in negotiations of a highly complex charach 
e.g., while discussing a possible arrangement with groups in Japan and with some of the 
leading northern war lords, he was also sounding out. the Soviet Union about possible help 
from it. 
112

- 
Sun's negotiations with the Japanese and the war lords did not prosper; those with the 
USSR did, though the fruits ? a promise of help with apparently WA much in the way of 
strings attached ? did not come until 20 January 1923. An agreement signed on that date 
by Sun and the Comintern representative in Asia, Joffe, gave the former control over any 
aid that might be forthcoming, and declared China not yet. "ripe" for communism. 
Soviet aid gave the Canton government new life, and made its party, the Kuomintang, 
a major if not the major factor in Chinese politics. Sun did not live to see his party obtain 
national power. But it. was from the st niggle for power among the leaders of the Kuomin-
tang ensuing upon his death that Chiang Kai-shek, who was to lead it to power, emerged 
as its leader, though not its undisputed leader. Chiang's position was from the very first 
constantly challenged by Chinese Communists, who had joined the Kuomintang as indi-
viduals in 1923; indeed, much of the present-day distrust and animosity between Chiang 
and the Communists date back to their first. days of uncertain collaboration. 
By 1927 the Nationalists felt they were adequately prepared for a long-planned military 
expedition in which they intended to conquer and reunite all of China. As of the moment 
when the Nationalist armies set out from Canton, Chiang and the Communists seemed 
determined to work together, and had they in fact done so the desired goal might well have 
been achieved. Actually, however, tension between the two elements was never less than 
extreme, and by the time the armies were in the Yangtze Valley a break between them had 
become inevitable. It soon occurred, and its immediate effect was to give China two capi-
tals: one, beyond the reach of Chiang's army, at Hankow, dominated by the Communists; 
another, Chiang's, at Nanking. Presumably one of the two, had they both survived for 
a while, would have destroyed the other. But the Ilankow government soon collapsed 
because of divided counsels and internecine struggles withM its own leadership. 
By 1928 Chiang was able to call Nanking the capital of a new Chinese national govern-
ment, under the direction of the Kuomintang. This did not mean, however, that China 
was at last reunited. The warlords Chang Tso-lin in Manchuria, Yen Hsi-ehan in Shansi, 
and Feng Yu-hsiang in Shensi, Ilonan, and Shantung, each with his own army, defied 
Chiang's authority to the North, and were under constant pressure from Japan not to join 
the new government. Even as late as 1930 and 1931 Chiang was busy suppressing revolts 
on the part of individual military leaders and warlords. And by that time a considerable 
part of his resources and energies were going into campaigns against the growing power base 
of the Chinese Communists in Kiangsi. 
The Nationalists and International Wars 
In September 1931, at a moment when the Nationalists were making real progress 
toward the reunification of China, the Japanese struck in Manchuria, occupied the three 
northeastern provinces, and proceeded to behave in such fashion as to leave no doubt of 
their intention to expand their conquests in China. From that date forward, therefore, 
Chiang's primary task was that of preparing the country for an imminent war with Japanese 
The ensuing years were, nevertheless, years of not inconsiderable achievement for the 
Kuomintang ? and for China. The early period of the Nanking government was charac-
terized throughout China by al unprecedented political awakening, as a result of which 
large numbers of people came to feel that at last China ceuld give itself a solid system of 
government, and make of that government an instrument for the long-postponed moderni-
zation of Chinese society. Education made great forward strides during the period, and a 
concerted effort was made to reduce illiteracy. The task of expanding China's industrial 
capacity received a certain amount of serious attention, both from the government and 
from private individuals and groups. In the field of international relations the Nanking

government launched and sustained a drive for renegotiation of all existing treaties between 
Mina and the other power that China deemed "unequal." (These treaties, however, were 
not to be abrogated until the Second World War, and at a moment when the Nationalists 
eeerned about to succumb to the Japanese. Thus the Kuomintang, though it could say at 
last that the diplomatic equality that it had promised had been achieved, never profited 
from this politically as it might otherwise have done.) 
By the end of 1936, in any ewe, China appeared to be on the point of achieving a degree 
of unity without precedent in modern times. Even the Communists indicated their readi-
ness to cooperate with Chiang in resisting Japan. And the need for unity was soon demon-
strated: on 7 July 1937, the Japanese struck at the Marco Polo Bridge (Lo Kou Chiao), on 
the outskirts of Peking, and China began to wage a "war of resistance" that was to last. 
until the defeat of Japan on 2 September 1945. 
After the entry of the United States into the Pacific War, all groups in China tended to 
assume that Japan would ultimately be defeated, and the real issue in Chinese polities soon 
became that of who was to have power in the postwar era. Tension between the Kuomin-
tang and the challenging Communist Party became, in consequence, more acute as victory 
seemed nearer. Upon the defeat of Japan, it broke out into an open civil war that even-
tually gave the Communists control of the mainland. 
History of the Chinese Communist Party 
Not until after the Russian Revolution did Marxist and Communist ideas begin to 
awaken interest in China. The Chinese intellectuals, preoccupied as they had been with the 
implications for China of liberal democracy and modern science, were taken completely by 
surprise when the Bolsheviks won out in Russia, consolidated their victory, and proclaimed 
to the world that they owed their success to a corpus of doctrine that could be found in any 
good Western library. Their surprise, however, quickly changed in some cases into curios-
ity, first about the doctrines themselves, then about such questions as whether they might 
be applicable to China, and whether China could, by embracing them, transform itself into 
a world power and escape from all the ills which had reduced it to impotence. 
The first Chinese to begin thinking seriously about the possibility of transplanting 
Communism to China were some professors and students in Peking. Ch'en Tu-hsiu, a 
professor at Peking University, not only organized the Marxist study group, China's first, 
that was to serve as the nucleus of the future Chinese Communist Party, but gathered 
around him a following of students that included two future leaders of the Party, Mac 
Tse-tung and Ch'u Ch'iu-pai. There is reason to believe, however, that the group began 
as an enterprise in intellectual inquiry, and might vell have remained that but for the 
arrive' in China of Gregory Voitinsky, the first. representative of the Comietern in China, 
who met Ch'en Tu-hsiu in June of 1920 and persuaded him that the time had come to leave 
behind idle discussien of Marxism and get busy organizing the cell groups that would be 
needed for the realization of Marxist objectives. By August Voitinsky had founded the 
Socialist Youth Corps, which in time recruited members from the leading universities in 
China. Further Communist groups were organized in the leading cities of China: Peking, 
Shanghai, liankow, and Canton. 
By July of 1921 it was decided that the time was ripe to summon a First Congress of 
the (hitherto non-existent) Chinese Communist Party. Its handful of delegates assembled 
in the French ('onceesion in Shanghai, but at

*a. 
No official report of this First Cciogrese of the Chinese Communist Party has ever 
been published, although the Communists are usually c_areful to maintain full records of 
this sort of thing. One possible explanation of this gap in official Communist literature 
is that an embarrassingly large number of the charter members of the Chinese Communist 
Party were later to leave it and become prominent in an enemy camp. T'ai Chi-Vo was 
to become spokesman of the Kuomintang's right wing. Chn Kung-po and Shao Li-tza 
were both to defect to the Kuomintang, the latter to serve one day as personal secretary 
to General Chiang. Ch'err Kung-po and Chou Fu-hai were to become puppet leaders for the 
Japanese during the Second World War. The current_ Chinese Communiut report on Party 
history contents itself with the statement that those attending this first Congress included 
Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-lai, Li Li-son (1.i Lang-tru), Li Ta-chao, and "others." 
Although Ch'en Tu-hsiu was not present at the Congress, the latter recognized him 
as Perty Chairman ? i poet he was to hold until 1927. Apparently the mood among those 
present was highly optimistic: now that it was formary organized, the Party would immedi-
ately take up its rightful place as a factor to be reckoned with in Chinese politics, and a 
Chinese Communist Revolution would ensue before many years. This was presumably due, 
since other reasons have not come to light, to Li Iii-san's remarkable success in organizing 
the workers at the Hanyeliping Iron Works in liankow, the largest foundry in China. 
Li Li-aen's message to them at the time, however, was (in the language of the US trade 
union movement) "economic," not "political." He spoke to them, that is to say, about the 
need for improving the working and living conditions of Chinese workers, and certainly 
found them highly responsive. But when, later, the message changed, and they were called 
upon to give of their time and energy for political purposes, especially that of establishing 
a proletarian dictatorship, they showed little inter-reit, and some were openly hostile. 
Nevertheless, the Chinese delegation to the Fourth Congress of the Comintern in 
Moscow in November 1922, with Ch'ai Tu-&u as chairman, had not yet abandoned its 
optimism about the chances of producing a proletarian revolution in China by merely 
organizing the workers and encouraging them to strike. The Russian leaders, especially 
Radek, chose to rely on other sources of information available to them, took the Chinese 
delegation sharply to task for their "unrealistic outlook," and ordered the Chinese Com-
munist Party to seek the cooperation of the intellectuals and the petty bourgeoisie in the 
"struggle against the European and Asiatic Imperialism." The Party was, of course, to 
keep on trying to organize workingmen; but no doubt was left in anyone's mind that its 
major mission was to assist the Soviet Union in its attempt to weaken the Western democra-
cies. Soon, indeed, the new representative of the Comintern in China, whose name was 
Maring, was going a step further and ordering the Chinese Communist Party to collaborate 
with any and all groups, regardless of class background, willing to oppose the "imperialists," 
and making it clear that-this form of words included even the Kuomintang. When some of 
the Chinese Communists took exception to these instructions on the allegedly Marxist 
grounds that a proletarian party must never permit itself to be drawn into cooperation with 
any bourgeois group, the Kremlin itself took the matter in hand. The Kuomintang, it 
declared, was a coalition of all classes in China, and in any case it was permissible -- in 
colonial and semi-colonial countries during the "stage of imperialism" ? for proletarian, 
national bourgeoisie, and petty bourgeoisie elements to act together against domination by 
foreign interests and/or foreign powers. 
By the end of 1922 the Chieese Communist Party was, accordingly, putting itself on 
record to the effect that cooperation was airirible on an "individual brei," i.e. with the 
Communiats joining the Kuomintang as individuals with a view to exploiting it as a "front

organization" Certainly Certainly the Party was attempting to use the Kuomintang for its own 
purposes well before the famous Sun-Joffe Declaration of 26 January 1923, which stated 
explicitly that the "conditions do not exist in China for the establishment of Communism 
and Socialism," and that the Russians would therefore help China to obtain "national unity 
and national independence." 
The resulting period of collaboration between the CP and the Kuomintang was to last 
from 1923 to 1927, although at no time did the two groups cease to regard each other with a 
good deal of suspicion. The Communists made little effort to conceal the fact that they 
were out to exploit the Kuomintang as a front, that what they were interested in was 
increasing their own power, and that their ultimate objective, which might on occasion be 
postponed but never abandoned, was a dear-cut assumption of national power by them-
selves. The Communists, moreover, though they clearly had much to gain from-exploiting 
the Kuomintang, were always restive in the presence of the grave problems that working 
within another organization unavoidably posed for them. They had not had time, before 
the period of collaboration began, to create the strong, well-disciplined, and obedient party 
cadres they knew they would need in the long run, and the decision to work through the 
Kuomintang made it extremely difficult to solidify the necessary core group and inculcate 
in them the all-important practice of strict adherence to the commands of the Party leader-
ship. Concretely, the fact that the leadership had sanctioned the dilution of Communism 
by ccoperating, with enemy bourgecizic groupc, tended tz; urider--'-e its authority over those 
of its members who were excessively eager to work with non-Marxist elements. 
The Communist leadership faced a further dilemma, namely, that of reconciling the 
Kremlin mandate to maintain its proletarian base and strengthen its organization with the 
furthcr mandate to cooperate with and support the Kuomintang. But for the sk:Ilful 
leadership and guidance of Ituasian advisers like Borodin, Galen, and Maring, all of whom 
were of course fully cognizant of the objectives of the Soviet Union, it seems probable that 
the Chinese Communist Party would never have emerged from the period of collaboration 
with even the semblance of a united organization. In any case, the Chinese leadership of 
the Party failed to escape from the horns of its dilemmas in a manner satisfactory to the 
Comintern. After the break with the Kuomintang in 1927, it was unhesitatingly purged. 
Lenin's death in January 1924, and the ensuing struggle for power in the USSR between 
Stalin and Trotsky, may be seen in retrospect as major events in the history of the Chinese 
Communist Party. This is true in two senses, which must 1.1e carefully distinguished: one, 
the struggle between the heirs apparent of Lenin was promptly reflected in a similar inter-
necine struggle within the Chinese Party; second, the Chinese Party promptly bteame a. 
major issue between Stalin and Trotsky. The Stalinist leadership insisted, as one would 
expect from the Toregoing paragraphs, that the "correct line" in China was that of coopera-
tion between the "proletariat" (the CCP) and the petty and national bourgeoisie of the 
Kuomintang with, of course, a view to "weakening" the position of the "imperialist" 
powers in Asia. They held that the Chinese Party should, in consequence, refrain from 
pushing the socialization issue in China, postpone the establishment of Soviets until China 
had been united by the armies of the Kuomintang, and urge no extreme demands until 
they rec eived new instructions-- lest such demands alienate the leadership of the Kuomin-
tang. The Chinese Communists, in short, should not seek to asume state power directly 
? It is fl matter of smie interest that at the present time Mao Tse-tung claims that he did not attend 
the Second 1'art7k Congres. although he was in Shanghai at the time. Mao offer f the rather disingenuous 
eNplamition thst he "forgot- the name of the place where it was to he held. "could not find any comrades.

Al that time. 
116 
until after the Kuomintang had rcanz.c,d its twin gott!s of uniting the country and opposing 
"imperialism." 
Trotsky and his followers took the opposite view, insisting that the Chinese Com-
munists must not become a tool of the Kuomintang, and that this danger could be avoided 
only by ordering the Chinese Party to adopt at once an all-out revolutionary program, includ-
ing the introduction of Soviets, redistribution of the land, and worker control of factories, 
The Stalinist line, the Trutekyites argue-d, could have no other long-term result than that 
of making the Kuomintang so strong that it could destroy the Communist Party, which, 
they addcd, it would certainly not hesitate to do. (The notion that the Communist Party 
could help bring the Kuomintang to power and then unhorse it when the time came to part. 
company with it, the Trot skyites denounced as idle dreaming.) The Troteskyites, in short, 
held that Stalin was seeking to destroy the revolution, and was defeating, not forwarding, 
the communization of China. 
Within the ranks of the Chinese Party, the Staliniats promptly gained the ascendancy, 
and proceeded to expel all members who sided with Trotsky's views. (The main support 
for the Trotsky ease, indeed, came from the left wing of the Kuomintang itself, which was 
by no means disinclined to adopt a radical program looking to an immediate solution of 
China's social and economic probiern. There was, however, never any question of the 
Kuomintang's heeding the counsels of these left-wing elements.) There ensued a period of 
relative peace and unity within the CCP, and between the CCP and the Kuo ------------
partly because almost everyone's attention, through the period when the Nationalists were 
establishing themselves at Canton and building the military forces with which to conquer 
the rest of China, was concentrated on preparations for the Northern Expedition. More-
over, Borodin's energetic campaign to reorganize the Kuomintang gave the Communists 
confidence that a revolutionary wave was about to sweep over China, and that differences 
over the form the revolution was to take might profitably be postponed until a later day. 
Within the Kuomintang itself, by contrast, this was a period of widespread disunity 
(which the Communists were able to turn to their own advantage). During the Canton 
period of collaboration, however, the friction within the Nationalist camp never turned on 
a clear-cut Kuomintang-versus-Communist issue, if for no other reason than because the 
three-way struggle for leadership between Wang Ching-wei, Chiang Kai-shek, and Hu 
Han-min, following the death of Dr, Sun Yat-sen, rendered any united opposition to the 
Communists out of the question. There was increasing suspicion among the Nationalists 
that the Communists would not accept Kuomintang discipline indefinitely, but. the suspicion 
never crystallized into an attempt to weaken the position of the Communists within the 
Canton government. Rather, the various factions in the Kuomintang were more than 
eager to win Communist support. Only one group, the Western !fills Clique, took the posi-
tion that the Communist policies had somehow replaced those of Dr. Sun Yat-?n, and it 
soon broke with the Kuomintang on that new issue, leaving an open field for those who did 
not share their concern, and the pattern emerged clearly when flu Ilan-min, presumably 
the most conservative of the triumvirate bidding for the mantle of Sun Yat-sen, went 
promptly to Nloscow after his fall from power at Canton in August 192.5. Once in Moscow, 
moreover, he put himself forward at the Sixth Plenum of the Executive Committee of the 
Communist International as the most. revolutionary of the leadera at Canton! 
Even when, on 20 March 1926,. Chiang Kai-shek moved to assume active leadership 
of the Kuomintang, and ousted elements on both lie right and left wine-. including Wang 
Ching-wei, the Chinese Communists took the turn of events in their tride despite the 
fact that some of the men he removed from their posts were Communists. liorodin encour-

ruptive elements on both right and kit within the Kuomintang, would give Chiang full 
control over the Nationalist military forces, strengthen his hand against the politicians in 
the Canton government, and clear the way for the Northern Expedition, which in his view 
could not fail to produce results favorable to the CCP. 
The Chinese Csemmunists, then, viewed the drive from Canton into the rest of China 
with approval. They saw in the process of expanding the territories of the Nationalists an 
opportunity for carrying their independent agitation to more and more people, and, mean-
time, for eluding close scrutiny of their activities by the Kuomintang. And as the National-
ist Armies marched north, the Communists were indeed active in the fields of propaganda 
and organization. In the, areas occupied by armies directly under Chiang's command, to 
be sure, they had little success with their independent operations, but the armies that 
moved directly up into Central China let them have a free hand ? with the result that 
when they reached the Yangtze River the Communist elements were already in a command-
ing position. Although still under orders from Moscow to continue to work through Chiang 
Kai-shek and under the name of the Kuomintang, they took prompt action, once the city 
of Hankow had been tanrupied, C  goiog so far, with Borodin's advice, eta to decree the 
removal of the capital of the Nationalist movement from Canton to Hankow, which Chiang 
shek, then at Nandi:mg, tssuld hardly fail to eonst roe as an attempt to undermine his 
influence in the Kuomintang. Chiang did not see fit to take any immediate action against 
the Hankow (or Wu-han) government. But the fundamental divisions within the ranks of 
the Northern Expedition were clearly about to lead to an open rupture between the Com-
munists and the Kuomintang. 
The Hankow government, though it continued to maintain the fiction that it repre-
sented the Kuomintang, was manifestly dominated by the latter's left wing, and was, again 
manifestly, far more radical in character than its predecessor at Canton. At the same time, 
the Communists were by no means certain what, within the general objective of cooperating 
with the Kuomintang while preparing to wrest power some day from the other groups in 
the Nationalist movement, was the correct policy for them to follow -- especially since 
many of the military commanders at lIankow would be unwilling to continue to support a 
government that every day looked more like the Commuoist ideal and 1.sis like that of 
Sun Yat-sen. The problem was complicated by the Trotskyite& insistence that the Hankow 
government itrooediately set about instituting a general strike among the workers and 
establishing Soviets in the countryside. he, that it launch a direct attack against theland-
owners and the directors of the factories. The Stalinist leadership, what, with Ch'en Tu-
haiu's determiess?   to maintain ostensibly cooperative relations with the Kuomintang, 
were obliged to answer that such a program would merely solidify all opposition (reaction-
ary) forces, and that so long as the military conquest of the country had not been accom-
plished, drazitie policies should be postponed. The most that could be got out of Moscow 
was permission to redistribute any land in the Wu-han area that did not belong to the 
family of a military leader or a soldier. The effect of this, as might have been predicted, 
was to have every landowner on the horizon claiming relationship to some member of the 
Nationalist Army. 
As it became dear that the liankow government did not enjoy the support or even the 
good wishes of Chiang Kai-shek, many of the leaders who doubted the wisdom of cooperat-
ing with the Communists began to withdraw their support from the new government. This 
tended to sharpen the conflict between the Communists and the left wing of the Kuomintang 
in Ilankow, so that when Chiang Kai-shek moved into Shanghai (March 1927) and began, 
while still ostensibly supporting the policy of collaboration, to strike back at the Com-
munists, the Ilankow government foomi itself facing a major crisis. 
118 
-am 
Over the next two months, in consequence, the stage was set for the now-unavoidable 
break between the two elements in the Kuomintang. On 1 June 1927, Stalin telegraphed 
new orders to the Chinese Communist Party in the name of the Executive Committee of 
the Communist International. It. was to change its policy in the direction of greater aggrts-
siveness, still, however, without making any final break with the Kuomintang. Concretely, 
Stalin instructed the Chinese Party to torm a separate army of 20,000 Communists and 
50,000 workers and peasants, establish a revolutionary court that would try "reactionary" 
officers, and secure the appointment of a "tell-known member of the Kuomintang" as 
chairman of the court -- so that the creation of the latter would not look like a Communist-
inspired move. Stalin, dearly, was thinking forward to the day when .the Communists 
would take over control of the Nationalist movement; nor was anyone left, in doubt about 
this for long, for due to an indiscretion oil the part of Roy, the Indian representative of the 
Comintern in Hankow. Stalin's telegram was made public. Not only the Kuomintang 
left-wingers but many members of the Conmiunist Party itself were so sharked at its con-
tents that they promptly broke with the Hankow government., on the grounds that the 
Communists in control of it were completely under the domination of Moscow. 
Soon afterward, the Hankow government fell --- a disaster far too big, from the Kremlin 
point of view, to leave the leadership of the CCP any hope of surviving. The Trotskyite" 
of course, were prompt to point out, presumably to Stalin's annoyanee, that they had 
always predicted that the Stalinist Chinese policies would lead to such a major disaster. 
The obvious scapegoat was Ch'en Tu-lisiu, who made a last desperate move to save himself 
by leading an armed insurrection in the city of Nanchang on 1 August 1927, the first in 
the Chinese Party's history. But it also failed, and the only remaining question was when, 
organizationally speaking, the heads would roll. 
Ch'en Tu-hsiu was duly removed from his past as Chairman of the CCP on 7 August, 
at an Emergency Conference of the Party's Central Committee. (Ch'u Ch'iu-pai was 
named his successor.) Chinese Communists to this day single him out as the greatest 
traitor in the Party's history, and as the prime example of the "errors" that comrades should 
seek to avoid. Ch'en ? so runs the indictment ? followed a course of "right opportun-
ism," and sought to sacrifice the Party to the goal of collaborating with the Kuomintang. 
Be was, moreover, a "liqUidat or"; i.e., he allegedly moved the Party along toward liquida-
tion by merging it with the Kuomintang. The record, in point of fact, clearly shows that 
('h'en faithfully carried out the orders the Party had received from the Kremlin, that he 
as an individual had grave misgivings as to the advisability of all-out cooperation a ith the 
Kuomintang, and that if he deviated at all it was in the opposite direction from that which 
his former comrades allege; i.e., he failed to cooperate in the loyal manner that the letter 
of the Comintern instructions called for. The Comintern needed a scapegoat for the Han-
kow fiasco. Thus Ch'en, as Chairman, had to go, and anything in the record that conflicted 
with what the Comintern needed to prove must be ignored. 
Ch'en had great popular prestige, which presumably accounts for the fact that he was 
not at that time purged from the Party, but was merely deprived of his posts of leadership; 
and when he was finally expelled, in the spring of 1929, it was over an entirely different 
matter. Chang Iisueh-liang. military and civil governor of Manchuria, was engaged in 
armed conflict with the Soviet Union over certain issues arising out of the joint control 
of the Chinese Eastern Railroad. The CCP received orders from Moscow to start a propa-
ganda campaign based on the slogan "Protect the Soviet. Union," which would have put. the 
Chinese Communists in the position (S. supporting a nation that as at war with Chinese 
forces. The other CCP leaders accepted the orders without opposition, but Cli'en Tu-hsiu

served the same purpose without offending the national sensibilities of the Chinese. Ch'en, 
not no much because he had refused as because he had failed to support the Soviet Union 
openly and fully against the national interest of China, was promptly read out Of the Party. 
Ch'u Ch'iu-pai replaced Ch'en as Chairmen of the Party at a moment of great uncer-
tainty as to what future Party policy ought to be. Mrsgeow, however, needed surceases, 
of whatever kind, with which to silence the Trotskyite opposition, and it was finally deter-
mined that the Chinese Communists were to adopt a "more revolutionary" line, including 
the establishment of Soviets and the carrying out of terroristic measures against land-
owners. The Trotakyites were quick to claim that Stalin was merely stealing the program 
they had always advocated, to which, of course, the Kremlin replied (via Pravda) that the 
"objective conditions" had only just become ripe for such a policy, and that if it had been 
advocated earlier it would have eeded in failure. Both were due for a surprise in the months 
and years ahead, for the revolutionary, policy was to be merely a further Kremlin failure 
in China. 
The new policy of armed activity in the countryside, known as the "Autumn Harvest," 
though unsueceseful, did bring to prominenee the Party's future leader, Mao Tse-tung. 
Mao had, up to this point, c+arineled his energies into organizing peasant groups in Hunan 
rather than into activities at Party headquarters; the latter, moreover, had not attached 
much impostanee to the peasant organization phase of its program, and had been content 
merely to give Mao instructions from time to time. After the Hankow debacle, however, 
the Party leaders took another look at the organizations Mao had developed, and saw in 
them renters for conducting armed raids throughout the province of Hunan. This was an 
important turning point. For while the ruthlessness of these armed bands WELS to increase 
popular opposition to the Communists, and thug defeat the leadership's purpose, it was the 
beginning of the Communist Party's policy of maintaining its cwn armed forces. . 
Mao Tse-tung was, therefore, identified from an early moment with the utilization of 
military power to obtain political objectives. Current Chinese Communist writings on the 
history of the Party tend to gloss over the period of the "Autumn Harvest," and to ignore 
the role Mao played in directing the armed bands that were to serve as the basis of the first 
army of the Communist Party. The two principal reasons for this appear to be (a) the 
desire not to associate the present leader of the Party with a policy that failed, and (b) the 
wish to strike from the ecord the fact. that Mao in point of fact overstepped Comintern 
orders and did things that were not sanctioned by the Central Committee of the Chinese 
Party. This he certainly did: the Comintern had directed the Chinese Communists merely 
to press forward with peasant agitation; Mao, on his own initiative, had decided to carry 
out a far more ambitious program. 
The Comintern's decision to apply more violent measures resulted in some important 
events in the Canton Commune. The same Emergency Conference of the Central Com-
mittee that removed ('h'en Tu-hsiu was instructed by Lominadze, the new representative 
of the Comintern, that the moment was ripe in China for an armed rebellion. Plans were 
accordingly laid for .an uprising in Canton, the purpose of which would be the immediate 
establishment of a Communist government to which the Kremlin could point in answering 
criticisms of its China policy. A group of trusted Western (but non-Russian) Communists, 
under the direction of Heinz Neumann and including Earl Browder, Gerhart Eisler, and 
John Pepper (alias Joseph PogAny) were dispatched to South China, to maximize the 
projects's chances of success. (The Chinese Communist lenders, though associated with the 
project, were not given trusted posts.) Whether despite or because of their intervention, 
the Commune, when it wasfinally established On 11 Deeember 1927, lasted only three days. 
Furthermore, it was established after a violent and bloody rebellion which so shocked and

antagonized the Kuornintame as to set esti. ide all hope of cooperation between the COMMU11---
ISt5 and other Chinese groups in the immediate future. Those who had questioned whether 
the Communists would employ extreme tactics in China now saw their error, and henceforth 
would take the position that working with men capable of such violent, behavior was 
impossible. 
The Chinese Communist Party promptly became, in the eyes of the Comintern, 
"responsible" for the failure of the Canton Commune. Ch'u Ch'iu-pai was forced out of 
the Party leadership, on the grounds that he had followed an "adventurist" policy and failed 
to read correctly the trend of events in China, lie had, it was alleged, committed the error 
of "putschism" ? by favoring armed uprisings when the "revolution was in a trough." 
The fact that he had been faithfully following a "line" from Moscow was conveniently 
overlooked, although it may have softened his punishment. Ile was not purged from the 
Party, and after three years in Moscow he was permitted to eturn to China in 1930 and 
lend a hand to the new leadership. It is interesting to note that his predecessor, Ch'tn 
Tu-hsiu, who did not go to Moscow after he fell into disfavor, is still regarded by the Chinese 
Communists as one of the arch enemies of the "revolution," while Ch'u Ch'iu-pai, who was 
also identified with a policy of failure but promptly reported to Moscow, has been regarded 
as a hero. 
Ch'u's successor as leader of the Chinese Communist Party was Li Li-san, himself 
just back from Moscow bearing instructions from the Comintern nearly identical to those 
under which Ch'u had been operating. Li, however, was to "organize the proletariat" 
before attempting "armed uprisings." lie had won a reputation in the Chinese Labor move-
ment for getting things done. Indeed, his rise to the chairmanship was itself an indication 
that the CCP was entering a phase in which the trade union and the strike would be its main 
weapons in the struggle for power. But the moment for this change of tactics does not 
appear to have been wisely chosen, for it soon becarm svident that Chinese workers were 
not attracted by Communist policies as such (i.e., as eon, rasted with ad hoc measures calcu-
lated to raise their living standards), and that they shied away from political strikes. Li, 
in any case, soon found that he was losing the labor groups to the Kuomintang, and little 
by little reinterpreted the Comintern's orders to "organize the proletariat" to mean that 
he roust knit the Chinese Communist Party itself into a tightly disciplined group. This 
called, as he saw it, for extending his personal leadership and direction into all phases of the 
Party's activities on the one hand, and integrating the various groups within the Party 
on the other. In these two enterprises he was fairly successful, in part at least because of 
the assistance of Chou F, n-lai, who had survived all the previous shifts in Party leadership 
and was to continee to do so in the years ahead. Chou became Li's hatchet-man for dealing 
with "deviations, sectarianism, and extreme democratic tendencies" in the Party. 
While Li Li-san was pouring new life and direction into Party activities in the urban 
areas of China, Mao Tse-tung, fully recovered from the "Autumn Harvest" fiasco, was 
rebuilding the Party's organization in the mountains of Kialigsi. His assistant for this 
purpose was Chu Teh, future commander in chief of the Red Army. Mao's goal, from an 
early moment, was to build a strong military organization that would be completely subordi-
nated to the Party's political commands In the winter of 192g he won P'Insg Tts-huai 
arid Ho Lung to that cause, and by January 1929 a new Red Army was winning victories 
and expanding the area under Communist control. Li Li-san viewed the activities of the 
Kiangsi leaders with approval, hut, convinced as he N1ILS that Issrk in the cities was far 
more important, gave them a relzttivsly free hand. Even the Comintern appears to have 
adopted a laissez-faire attitude toward what was happening in Kiangai.

? 
A clash nevertheless became iecrea.singly unavoidable as the new Red Army. grew in 
size and power, and finally occurred toward the end of 1929 --- in the form of an ideological 
dispute between Li Li-san and the Kiangsi leaders. The former insisted that only the 
"proletariat" could lead the Communist movement, so that .he and his headquarters had 
the last word about the movemerns or the Red Army. Mae agreed with the axiom, but 
disagreed about its application: only the "proletariat" could lead the Red Army, but this 
meant merely that its leadership must be in the hands of professional revolutionaries on the 
actual scene ? in short, the Kiangsi leaders. 
The dispute never assumed serious proportions. Early in 1930, the Comintern again 
summoned the Chinese Communists to armed revolt, and Li Li-sten had no alternative, 
since the workers clearly could not be counted on to conduct a major revolutionary cam-
paign, but to seek the help of the military leaders he had lasen opposing. The Red Army, 
it was decided, would strike at some of China's larger cities, and first of all at Changsha, 
which P'eng Tt-huai atteeked on 28 July 1930. Ile. held the city for three days, but was 
then driven out, and Li Li-sun's plans for Ilankow, Nanehang, and Nanking had to be 
abandoned. The events at Chengsha had clearly shown that the Red Army was not yet 
strong enough to be relied upon for engagements of this character. 
Li Li-sart had no alternative but to accept responsibility for the defeat at Changsha 
and to acquiesce in his removal from his post of leadership. The Comintern, indeed, was 
soon to "discover" that Li had been guilty of at vast assortment of errors, including "failure 
to appreciate the uneven development of the workers' and peasants' struggle," "adventur-
ism and putschism," and, finally, "placing too much reliance upon World Revolution to 
bring about victory in China." Li publicly recanted all these errors, confessed that he had 
followed a "semi-Trotskyist" line, and was next heard of in Moscow, where he was to 
remein until 1946 ? when he returned to Manchuria with the Soviet Armies after the 
Second World War, to be reinstated in the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party. 
The tall of Li Li-san did not, as might have been expected, result in immediately 
increased influence for Mao Tse-tung and the Kiangsi leaders. Mao was not directly 
involved in removing Li, this having been done by the Comintern itself. (This helps explain 
why it was easy for Mao to accept Li Li-ean back into the upper hierarchy of the Party in 
19-1(1.) And the Comintern chose to replace Li with Wang Ming (Ch'en Sha.o-y0) and to 
put the CCP under a group of young men (the Returned Students Clique) who had been 
studying in Moscow from t 926 to 1930, and were presumebly well trained in revolutionary 
tactics. These young leaders, the "28 Bolsheviks" as they were also called, early discovered 
that only full support from the Comintern, that is, from the new Comintern representative, 
Nlif, could keep them in control. Many of the older CCP leaders regarded them as too 
inexperienced to he trusted with responsibility for the Party's destiny. Li had left behind 
him an organization that still reflected his views, still looked upon him as the true Bolshevik 
agitator, and viewed the new leadership without enthusiasm. Finally, there were the 
groups that had hoped to replace I.i when he fell from power, and would presumably be 
ready to replace the 28 when they fell from grace. But the Kiangsi or "border region" 
leaders were not a part of this potentially formidable opposition, in part because of Mao's 
loyalty to the Comintern, in part, mostly perhaps, because the Comintern had ordered 
Party headquarters in Shanghai not to interfere with the activities of the "Soviets." The 
Kremlin, in other words, was not yet ready to take into its hands direct control of the actis ? 
ties of the Red Army, but it had accepted the policy of Mao as correct for the so-called 
border areas. (The term "border areas" refers to the Communists' practice of operating 
along the herders of two or more provinces so as to be constantly in position to move from 
one to the other and thus escape the jurisdiction of any provincial governor who might 
122 
? 
attempt to suppress them. Later, during the Japanese occupation, the Communists con-
tinued to establish "border areas" between the areas controlled by the Japanese army, the 
puppet, government, and the Nationalists.) 
The Wang Ming leadership soon established control over the CCP machinery in the 
urban areas. The opposition groups were read out of the Party, wed when they held a 
special opposition meeting some of their members were imprisoned and executed by the 
Kuomintang police. (It is impossible to determine whether the new Communist, leadership 
assisted the Kuomintang by informing the police of the meeting of the opposition leaders.) 
By the summer of 1930. nevertheless, events had begun to take a turn that would, in time, 
gradually reduce the power of the Wang Ming leadership, and bring Mao to the fore. For 
one thing, the Nationalists were by now consolidating their power and expanding their 
operations against the Communists. Secondly, the threat of invasion by Japan tended to 
make the Chinese people rally around the Kuomintang leadership as never before, and tended 
also to put the Communists, with their program looking to the ultimate overthrow of the 
government, in the position, as far as many people were concerned, of aiding and abetting 
a hated foreign enemy. Not until 1935, when the Kremlin put its imprimatur on a "united 
front" in China for all groups opposed to fascism and Japanese militarism, did the CCP 
begin to convince many people that they were -.iterested in saving China from conquest 
by the Japanese. And doubt of the Communists' good faith was especially widespread in 
the urban areas, where the Wang Ming leaders were attempting to develop strength. 
The leaders of the Kiangsi "Soviet." were, to be sure, up against these same difficultieet. 
Even so, especially after the failure of the Nationalists' "First Communist-Bandit Sup-
pression Campaign" in November 1930, the stature of the Red Army continued to grow, 
and it became increasingly clear that the political-military Communist leaders in Kiangsi 
had developed the most stable force the Communists possessed in China. The importance 
of the Kiangsi group grew from day to day with the prestige of the Red Army and with the 
decline in the fortunes of the urban Communists; no dramatic event ever occurred to mark 
its rise; but the time finally came atien the fact of its having risen could no longer be ignored, 
either in China or in Moscow. 
Mao Tse-tung's leadership in the "border areas" did not, meantime, go unchallenged. 
For one thing, he was constantly up against one of the great. problems of traditional Chinese 
politics, namely: how to keep men with growing armies under their command from claiming 
autonomy with respect to their nominal superiors in civilian government and administration. 
For another thing, he frequently had to leave other matters to one side and deal with those 
who took exception to his policies and methods.. Mao's formulae for coping with this two-
fold obstacle to his ambitions are the true measure of his capacity as a Communist leader. 
The first of the two problems he solved by becoming a recognized military leader himself, 
by closely identifying himself with Chu Teh, and, finally, by bringing Chu Teh into the top 
political leadership of the Soviet. Be thus established the principle that the leading political 
figures in the movement were to become (if they were not that already) experts in military 
matters, and that the movement's military leaders were to be regarded as eligible for high 
posts in the Party and in civil affairs. The Red Army would henceforth be intimately asso-
ciated with and integrated into the Party, and would not be regarded as a mere instrument 
for the Party to use in achieving power. 
Mao's solution to the second problem was lees ingenious and original, but not less 
effective: he made it his polies- not merely to defeat but to liquidate, rapidly and ruthlessly, 
an and all opposition to his leadership. The Fu T'ien incident provided him an early 
opportunity to establish the pattern, and to get ecross to his e011.-!aguNi the extent to which 
he meant business. It occurred near the end of 1930, and began when a group in Kiangsi

queNt-inneti ezrtain steps Mao had taken with a view to expanding the area of the Soviet. 
Mao promptly (7 December 1930) ordered seventy members of the Kiangsi Soviet arrested, 
whereupon Liu Ti-ts'ao, Commander of the XX Corps of Peng Te-huahis Third Army, 
went into rebellion, liberated the arrested men, and summoned a "People's Conference" 
which censured Mao's arbitrariness and demanded his removal from the leadership. Mao, 
spurred on no doubt by news that the rebels had killed more than 100 of his supporters, did 
not hesitate: the rest of the Army, firmly under his command, spilled the blood necessary 
for bringing the rebels to heel. And once this had been accomplished, he summarily exe-
cuted every last participant in the rebellion. 
After the Fu-Tien Revolt, the question was not whether Mao would come to dominate 
both the Red Army and the Party, but rather when he would claim a post and title appro-
priate to his actual power and influence. He did not become Secretary-General of the Party, 
as a matter of fact., until 1935. But the men who held that post from 1931 until 1935 had 
little of the authority it. was supposed to carry with it. Wang Ming remained as Secretary-
General until 1932, when he was replaced by Po Ku (Ch'in Pang-hsien); Po Ku held the 
post until 1934, when he was replaced by Lo Fu (Chang Wen-t'ien). But these changes in 
the leadership were effectuated, for the reason just mentioned, without anything even 
approaching a major crisis; given the limited scope of current Party (as opposed to Chinese 
Soviet) operations, nothing was at stake except the efficient management of a small Party 
office. (Wang Ming, upon abaialoning the post of Secretary-Genera!, had gone back to 
Moscow, to serve as Chinese representative on the Executive Committee of the Communist 
International. His removal had not., therefore, been accompanied by the usual purge.) 
In 1933, the Communists having found it impossible to continue effective operations 
in China's main cities, Party headquarters were moved out of Shanghai and all the leaders 
became identified with the Kiangsi group. Even before that date the center of Communist 
power had clearly shifted to the letter's mountain stronghold. The First All-China Con-
ference of Soviets had convened as early as 7 November 1931, when Jui-chin in Kiangsi was 
declared to be the capital of the Provincial Central Government of the Chinese Soviet 
Republic. All these moves reflected a basic change in Communist strategy, that is, a shift 
of emphasis away from revolt and infiltration throughout the country toward bids for con-
trol and actual administration of specific areas. The new strategy was to lead, unavoidably, 
to ever-increasing reliance upon military power, without which such control was obviously 
out of the question. In the long pull it was to have a further meaning: in 1948 the CCP 
would be the first Communist Party to achieve state power with prior experience in the 
administration and government of territories. 
The Chinese Communist Party had long before learned the lesson that a modern 
totalitarian movement must, if it. is to succeed, possess a well-disciplined and highly-organ-
ized party structure; it was now taking a leaf from the traditional political wisdom of China 
itself, and learning a lesson about the use of military force for political purposes. Powerful 
Chinese political leaders had always used private military organizations as a basis for their 
political power, and had developed what might be called a tactics for doing so. Once 
adapted to the purposes of the Communist movement, this tactics became a matter of 
(a) keeping the military force completely under the domination of politicals, and (b) keeping 
specific geographic territory under complete control. The conflict between the Communists 
and the other groups in China thus became merely a new chapter in the age-old struggle 
between rival armed forces, each maneuvering for the domination of territory, and lost 
much of the earlier overtones of ideological conflict and underground conspiracy. The Com-
munists, in short, became committed to a policy that required them to control bases of 
power that were as nearly as possible self-sufficient, and that were so situated as to make  
124

it difficult for the Nationalists to mount effective campaigns against them and yet, enable 
them to cause maximum embarrassment to the Nationalist government. 
One must not, however, inter from this change in Communist tactics in China in the 
early nineteen-thirties that the CCP had in any way relaxed its ties with world Communism. 
On the contrary: the Comintern welcomed and fully approved the change in tactics, partly, 
it seems, out of a recognition that the situation in China called for something of the kind, 
and partly because the USSR, already thinking in terms of a new world war in which it 
might be attacked by Japan, wished the Chinese Communists to adopt any policy that 
might contribute, in the long run, to the defense of the "Motherland cif Socialism." The 
new policy would clearly do that, and all the more surely if the Chinese Communists, while 
maximizing their military strength, were to force the Nationalist goeeeeneent to devote its 
main attention to preparing for a conflict with Japan. For the moment, therefore, the CCP 
must abandon all thought of indiscriminate revolts and conspiratorial anti-Nationalist 
measures, since these could only render the Nationalists less capable of assisting in the 
future defense of the USSR in a war against Japan. 
The Japanese occupation of Manchuria in September 1931, followed by the clash 
between Nationalist and Japanese forces at Shanghai m early 1932, was the signal for the 
aforementioned change in Kremlin planning on behalf of and/or in conjunction with the 
Chinese Communist Party. The Nationalists drew a different inference, however, from the 
Japanese threat. If war with Japan was inevitable, they reasoned, one of the first steps to 
take in preparing for it would be to eliminate the Communist armies and unify the entire 
country for the grand struggle. They reasoned further that the Communists, if left free 
to do so, would exploit every opportunity during the war with Japan to expand their own 
power. Unless they were destroyed before the fighting began, they would almost certainly 
emerge from the war more powerful and threatening than ever. The moral was obvious, 
so that simultaneously with the first Japanese moves against China the Nanking govern-
ment began to launch vigorous campaigns against the Red Army. The crucial campaign 
was that of 1934: it dislodged the Communists from their stronghold in Jui-chin and forced 
them to embark on what is now known as the "Long March" ? first int,o western China, 
then almost to the Tibetan border, and then northward to the province of Shensi, where 
they resettled, establishing their capital at Yenan (Fu-shih). - 
The "Long March" holds a very important place in the Chinese Communists' own 
version of their history. Whether or not a Communist leader took part in the Long March 
is an important determining factor with regard to his present place in the Party's upper 
hierarchy. One reason for this is that the Party was drastically reorganized in the course 
of the expedition, and along lines .hat greatly strengthened Mao Tse-tung's personal power 
and prestige. The Long March, in other words, figures in CCP mythology much as the 
Civil War figures in that of the Russian Communists. 
Those who took part in the Long March have good reason to feel that they are the 
surviving heroes of a major ordeal during which the very existence of the Party was often 
at stake. The Red Army, partly because of the casualties it sustained and partly because 
of defections by its less devoted members, ended its long trek with about one-third cf its 
original personnel. The Communists, we may note in passing, introduced into this cam-
paign a savagery that was without precedent in the history of Chinese civil wars. In the 
province of Kiaugsi, for example, where the heaviest fighting occurred, the population was 
nearly twenty-five million before, and about half that. after, the campaign. All along the 
route of the Long March, the Communists' terrorism created strong anti-Communist senti-
ment, which had by no means disappeared when the Reds returned after the Second World 
War.

..........1?060pormoOMPMANNOWRIZAWR 
Upon their arrival in Fu-shih in 1935, the Communists were ordered to seek the re-es-
tablishment of a "united front" with the Kuomintang against the Japanese. Once again 
they found themselves required to put aside their demands for a revolution, to emphasize 
nationalistic slogans, and to call for a patriotic war aesinst Japan. (The policy of the 
"united front" or "popular front" was at this time beine dopted by Communists all over 
the world, the Russians having decided that a general war was approaching in which they 
wcald need all the support that they could possibly get from non-Communist groups and 
governments.) In the event, their demand for a front was flatly rejected by the Kuomin-
tang leaders, but it soon showed itself to have greater popular appeal than earlier Commun-
ist policy had ever had. By the end of 1936, indeed, the new line had become so appealing 
that Chiang Kai-shek found it, worth his while to make a personal visit to Sian and urge 
the Manchurian troops under Chang FIstieh-liang to accelerate their efforts to eliminate 
the Red Army. (This was the now famous occasion when Chiang was kidnapped and 
threatened with execution. The Kremlin itself ordered the Chinese Communists to release 
the Generaliseimo, whom the Russians regarded as the only leader in China capable of 
uniting the country agsh?t Japan.) 
Out of the Sian Incident there emerged China's second United Front ? which, how-
ever, got under way in quite different circumstances from those that had obtained during 
the years 1022 to 1927. Instead of joining the Kuomintang as they had done before, and 
placing themselves in the hands of the Nationalist leadership, the Communists now retained 
their independent army. They did commit themselves, however, to obey any orders they 
might receive from the Nanking leaders, and to give up their practice of establishing inde-
pendent, governments. 
Simultaneously with their adoption of the "united front" policy, the Communist 
leaders set out to make their movement appear more palatable to liberal opinion throughout 
the world. In particular, they helped to create and disseminate the myth that they were 
"peasant reformers," conducting a democratic program of agrarian reform. At. the same 
time, however, they continued to insist that they were a completely correct and dedicated 
Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist Party. (After the war they openly referred to the period here 
in question as their "Agrarian Reform Phase.") At the very time when Mao was writing 
his book, New Democracy (to which some people wrongly attribute the notion that the CCP 
was sincerely interested in furthering a future coalition form of government for Chinar to 
include representatives of all classes), the Chinese Communists were busy strengthening 
their Party organization and establishing cell groups and cadres in areas where they had 
previously been prevented from doing so. The New Democracy was a basic part of a new 
Communist tactic, namely, that of seeking to establish "people's republics" that would at 
first appear to involve a coalition form of government but would prepare the way for com-
plete domination by the Communists-
During the war years, the Communists were careful not to weaken their organization, 
and to expand their power at every opportunity. They continued, for example, to establish 
local administrations (the "Border Regions"), which though nominally coalitions were 
invariably so set up that real power was in their own hands. Also, their practice of employ-
ing guerrilla tactics behind the Japanese !hies made it pos.sihk: for them to build up political 
influencein areas to ivhich they had been previously denied access, and thus get ready for 
the postwar period. 
When the war ended the Communists were, as the Kuomintang had feared, in a far 
stronger position than they had been at the beginning of the conflict; and during the post-
war period they pressed the advantages this gave them at every opportunity. Most particu-
larly, they resumed their fighting against the Nationalists, further disrupting the war-torn 
126 
*/???}.1.40.1, 
?????? ? ? 
? 
? 
Chinese economy by means of guerrilla operations, isolating the cities from the food-pro-
ducing countryside, and, as they gained greater power, moving gradually 'over to a war of 
position. By the end of 1945 the Red Army, vastly strengthened by the hsrge supplies of 
munitions that the Russians had captured from the Japanese, WaS in pasition to undertake 
major campaigns against Nationalist troops. 
The parallel Communist political tactic was that of attempting to translate their 
increased power into greater Communist participation in the Central Government. (This 
is the same tactic the Communists have employed in Eastern Europe, where they first used 
a coalition government as a device for seizing total power.) Among other things, they soon 
learned that they could wear the Nationalists down by involving them in interminable 
negotiations while the Red Army would go ahead with its military operations just es if no 
negotiations were going on. 
Immediately after the war the l?nited States also adopted the view that a coalition 
government was the best means of resolving the civil conflict in China. Not until the 
Marshall Mission did the US discover that the Chinese Communists were so confident of 
their power that they were unwilling to make any of tin'compromises that would be needed 
for a coalition. Negotiations finally broke down over the en? .... _ems: refusel to givp up 
their control of their army, which by then was the basic factor in their power, and over taeir 
insistence on controlling the strategic posts in the cabinet. 
The moment finally came when the Communists were ready to abandon all pretense 
of an intention to come to terms with the Nationalists, and to launch a major civil war with 
the clear objective of conquering the entire country. The moment chosen was that when 
the economy of China had been so disrupted and weakened by Communist oerrilia opera-
tions as to be facing total breakdown, and when the Nationalists, in their effort to protect 
the country's lines of communications against those same guersille operations, were over-
extended to the point of impotence. (It was also a moment when the Nationalists had 
spent much of their military power on a futile attempt, to reconquer Manchuria, which the 
Russians, in complete denial of their pledged word, had virtually handed over to the 
Communists.) 
By the summer of 1949 the Communists had achieved extensive victories on the main-
land, and were prepared to consolidate their conquests. On 1 October they formally pro-
claimed the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. Peking was 
selected as the capital, and the Communists set about altering the lave of Chinese society. 
The very memory of the Kuomintang, the Nanking government, and the October 11th 
Revolution was to be eradicated, and all phases of Chinese life were to be changed. The 
attitudes and values of traditional Chinese society were to be replaced by those of a society 
which, in all its pa. eculars, would follow the Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist pattern, and would 
take Soviet Russia as its immediate model and example.

CHAPTER 4 
.M1LITARY AFFAIRS IN COMMUNIST CHINA 
ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST ARMY 
The Chinese Communists state that the Chinese Communist Army was officially 
founded on 1 August 1927. This day, known as the People's Liberation Army Day, is now 
celebrated as a national holiday. The Chinese ideograms for the numbers "8" and "1," 
standing for the first day of the eighth month, thus appear in the upper left corner of the 
People's Liberation Army (31.1) flag and on the PLA insignia. The significance of 1 August. 
1927 is that it marks the outbreak of the Nanchang Rebellion, the first attempt by the 
Chinese Communist Party to seize power through armed violence. 
Nanchang Rebellion 
The Nanchang Rebellion occurred about a month after the fall of the lIankow gov-
ernment and the subsequent expulsion of the Communists from the Nuornintank by Gen-
eralissimo Chiang Kai-shek. At the time of the fall of the liankow government, the 
Executive Committee of the Communist International tthe (.7ornintai,) had ordered the 
Chinese Communist Party to organize an independent Communist. Army. The public 
announcement of this order was in large part responsible for the debacle of the Hankow 
government, since it alienated many of the non-Communists who had been active in sup-
porting the Hankow regime. When news of the fall of Hankow reached the Communist 
International, it promptly ordered the Chinese Communists to initiate armed uprisings. 
The result was that on 1 August 1927, some of the troops of the Kuomintang General 
Chang Fa-kuei, under the command of two of his officers, Ho Lung and Yeh T'ing, rebelled, 
taking Nanchang in a surprise attack. They had terrorized the captured city for only 
five days when the Kuomintang defeated them, and drove them Out into the countryside. 
Ho Lung moved his forces to the Hunan-Hupeh border area, where he maintained his 
command until after the Long March in 1935. Yell Ting moved his forces into Kwang-
tung province, where they were to take part in the Canton Rebellion of 11 to 13 December 
1927, the second attempt of the Chinese Communist Party, on orders from .t Communist 
International, to engage in armed revolt. It was to end as disastrously for the Communists 
as the Nanchang Incident. 
1917-1952 
By the end of 1927 the break between the Communists and the Kuomintang had 
clearly become definitive. The Communist elements that had reheled against the National-
ist armies mo..-ed into Kiangsi Province, and established a center at Ch'ing-kang-shan, near 
the Hunan border. In May 1928 Chu Teh, the present Commander in Chief of the Chinese 
Communist Forces (CCF), joined forces with Mao Tse-tung and began the task of organiz-
ing and developing the Chinese Commonist Army. In a sense, indeed, the story of Mao 
Tse-tung's rise to leadership in the Chinese Communist Party is simply the story of the 
rise to power of the Communist Army. Mao's power has always been closely assoeisted 
with Communist military power, since he ha.s always relied heavily upon military force to 
insure both his control of the Communist Party and the Party's control of China.

By taking advantage of the fact that Chiang Kai-shek was busy fighting the remaining 
northern war lords, the Communists a.,ere able to expand their base in Kiangsi and so 
enlarge their manpower reserves. Not until December 1930 was Chiang able to initiate 
his first expedition ? there were to be two others against the COmmunists in Kiangsi. 
His third expedition showed some promise of success, hut Chiang had to abandon it when, 
on 18 September 1031, the Japanese invaded Manchuria. 
1952-1937 
After the armistice with Japan in May 1932, the Kuomintang renewed its drive against 
the Communists in Kiangsi, first establishing a tight cordon around the Communist-con-
trolled areua and then slowly moving in to annihilate the Communist Forces. The Com-
munist leaders, recognizing their own plight, staked everything on a major effort to break 
the Kuomintang ring. This effort succeeded: on 29 October 1934, the Communists broke 
through the Lino encircling line of the Kuomintang Forces, and started their famous "Long 
March," which was to take them northwest into Shensi ProvInce. 
ait The Communists sustained heavy losses Juring the Long March, ending up with only 
about one-third the number of men they had had when they set out. Even so, their Army 
emerged from the experience a highly effective and skilled lighting force. It was during its 
six thousand mile Long March, for example, that it developed its tactics of rapid maneuver 
and its great skill at guerrilla operations. Once arrived in Shensi, moreover, the Com-
munists took as the first item on their agenda reorganization of their Army and systematic 
consolidation of their new area of control. Japan's continued pressure upon the Kuomin-
tang Forces in North China gave them just the breathing spell necessary for this operation, 
and by December 1036 the pressure had reached such a point that the Kuomintang could 
no longer afford to use its main forces against the Communists. Communist propaganda 
then turned the international situation to its advantage by insisting that all elements in 
China unite to fight the foreign foe "instead of fighting each other." The turning point 
here was the Sian Kidnapping Incident of 25 December 1936, in connection with which the 
Communists were able to extract from the Nanking government the concessions they needed 
in order to maintain their own military forces indefinitely. 
Sino-Japanese War 
A period of uneasy collaboration bet WCCA I the Chinese Communists and the Kuomin-
tang began, therefore, just before the Sinoalapanese War broke out on 7 July 1937. One 
aspect of this collaboration was the attempt to integrate the Communist. Army, formally 
at least, into the forces of the Central Government. The Communist units that had made 
the Long March were regrouped, and renamed the Eighth Route Army (Pa Lu Chun). The 
remainder of the Communist forces out over the country, especially those that had re-
mained in Central and South China, were regrouped and named the New Fourth Army. 
The Eighth Route Army, which was put under the command of Chu Teh (with I:Peng 
Te-huai as his deputy), consisted of three divisions under the command of Lin Piao, Ho 
Lung, and Liu Po-ch'eng respectively. In 1938 the Nationalists, in the attempt to bring 
it somewhat more under their control, named it the Eighteenth Group Army, and ordered 
it to garrison the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsin Herder Region. The result of this, however, was 
that the Eighth Route Army, as the Communists kept right on calling it, entered upon a 
period during which it rapidly expanded not only its military strength but also the territory 
it controlled. The Kuomintang eh7ments in North China, for example, cut off as they were 
from direct communication wilt Chungking, had to rely upon the Communists for guidance 
130 
? 
klettawar..ttas?traaga.ZW4?Metristatui?atrtsill?taaws????., 
and instruction, and in time came to be absolutely dependent upon them. (During the 
war the Communists acre able to dispatch elements of the Eighth Route Army all over 
North China, and to operate on all sides of the Japanese controlled cities.) 
At no time during the war against Japan din' the Communists commit their forces in 
any major engagement against the Japanese. They sy!..zematically avoided positional 
warfare, using enly guerrilla tactics and developing their mastery of the technique of tun bus-
cedes and surprise raids. The Nationalist Forces thus sustained the major brunt of the 
Japanese onslaught, and suffered the heavy losses. The Communist strategy throughout 
was that of "never a defeat,'" i.e., not exposing their forces in any engagement in which they 
'did not have either a clear superiority of numbers or the advantage of surprise plus the 
cpportunity to withdraw before the enemy could ceunterattaok. As the eair proceeded, 
therefore, the Communists both expanded their forces and accuimilated large quantities 
of arms and munitions for the post-war conflict (with the Kuomintang), the inevitability 
of whieh, following the certain defeat of Japan, they always took for granted. 
As the Sino-Japanese War progressed, relations between the *Kuomintang and the 
Communists became more and more strained. (During its first three years the Communists 
received riot only allotments of ammunition but a monetary subsidy from the Central 
Government. In view of their continued refusal to obey the commands of the Government 
however, this Resistance was gradually reduced and, finally, stopped altogether.) Actual 
armed clashes began to take place, as a matter of fart, even before the war ended. The 
most serious of these was the Neu Fourth Army Incident (January 1941), when the Central 
Government ordered the New Fourth to move north of the Yangtze and operate in the area 
between that river and the Yellow River. The Communists' refusal to obey the order 
resulted in a clash with Kuomintang troops, during which Communist commander Yeti 
T'ing was captured, Hsiang Ying, his deputy commander, wee killed, and some elements 
of his army were disarmed. After this incident ('h'en I (Ch'en 'Vi) assumed conunand of 
the New Fourth, which, having regrouped, continued its guerrilla operations in Central 
and South China ? in complete disregard of the orders of the Central Government. Certain 
New Fourth elements, to be sure, moved north of the Yangtze, as they had been ordered 
to do. But this also the Communists were able to make into an opportunity for expanding 
the total area under their influence. 
1945 ? 
The end of the Second World War found Chinese Communist Forces, some 606,000 
strong, conducting operations, mostly guerrilla, throughout North China and in certain 
areas of Central China. The Kuomintang Armies moved into the main cities of what had 
been Japanese-occupied China, and thus took command of the important eommunications 
centers. A major conflict between the Government forces and the Columuoiatts could nut, 
as soon became evident, be long postponed. 
The United States, through the Marshall Mission, now sought to mediate between the 
two groups. On 25 February 1946 the Executive Ileadquartcts established by the Marshall 
Mission was able to complete a military reorganization agreement, which provided for the 
reorganization and integration of the Chinese Communist Army and the Kuomintang 
Forces. The latter were to be reduced to 50 divisions and the former to 10, and there were 
not to be more than 14,Y00 troops in a division. Together they would constitute a tuitional 
defense force of 20 armies. 
The Communists, at the very moment of engaging in the negotiations mentioned, were 
vigorously reorganizing their total forces and regrouping their commands. During 1946, 
however, there were few direct claehee between the Communist and Nationalist forces, the

Second Field Army. The Second Field Army was formed out of the old Central China 
People's Liberation Army, and consists mainly of men from that region. Its initial cadres 
were skilled guerrillas ? members of the New Fourth Army who had epent the years of the 
Japanese War in Central China. (Not. only the Japanese but the Kuomintang as well had 
sought to force them out of this strategic area.) Many of its characteristics today reflect 
this early history. It is especially noted for its proven ability to engage in remarkable 
forced marches, i.e., for its extreme mobility on foot. And it has attempted to preserve 
in its present organization and training many procedures and practices appropriate to 
guerrilla outfits. (Its combat record during the Civil War shows that it has lost none of 
its traditional maneuverability.) 
The Second Field Army also reflects the qualities of its extremely colorful commander, 
Liu Po-ching, the "Ore Eyed Dragon." Liu, though indeed half blind, is reputed one of 
the beet field generals in the PLA, and is credited with a special flair for the tactics of mobile 
warfare. It was he who set the pattern of Communist tactics during the Civil War: no 
positional warfare, no defending captured cities. His Second Field Army was called "The 
wanderers of the Yangtze." 
It was the Second Field Army that was called upon to "liberate" Tibet. 
Third Field Army. The Third Field Army is rated the second beet of the Field Armies 
from the standpoint of combat efficiency. It was formed out of the East China People's 
Liberation Army, and during the Civil War its mission was to disrupt the Kuomintang 
communications between Central and North China. It operated primarily in Shantung 
Province, and to this day most (if its men are natives of this province. It took part in the 
fighting at Ilsii-chou, Nanking, and Shanghai, and continued to garrison these cities after 
the conquest of the mainland. It includes a large number of men who prior to their induc-
tion had been simple peasants. It was they about whom the war correspondents were 
writing when they reported that the Chinese Communist troops, upon "liberating" a 
modern city like Shanghai, contemplated its many wonders with incredulity and awe. 
Unlike the Second Field Army, the Third is noted for its ability to engage in fixed 
defensive warfare and to use siege tactics. It did some of the hardiest fighting of the entire 
Civil War, and made a good account of itself in the Central and South China campaigns. 
It has been chosen to prepare for the invasion of Taiwan, and unlike the other Field Armies 
has, in consequence, been trained to some extent in amphibious warfare. 
The tennrennder of t he Third Field Army, I, has no great reputation as a military 
commander, but is highly regarded for his skill in personal relations and his knack for sur-
rounding himself with loyal and competent subordinates. Aetual organization and military 
direction of the Third Field Army has been in the capable bands of Su Yu, Jao Shu-shih, 
and Chang Ting-ch'6ng. (Ch'en I has the distinction of having bought over to the Com-
munist side more Nationalist generals than any other high Communist commander.) 
As of when the Chinese entered the Korean War, elements of the Third Field Army 
had already been moved up into Manchuria. It was they who attacked the Chosin Reser-
voir area. 
Fourth Field .1riny, The Fourth Field Army was formed out of the Northeast People's 
I,iberation Army. It has a longer history of operating as a unit, than any of the other Field 
Armies, and is generally regarded as the most efficient fighting force China has at its dis-
posal. It is, for example, better trained and equipped than the other PLA Field Armies 
(the bulk of the I'S equipment captured from the Nationalists has ended up in its bands). 
Its original eeeires were the new Fourth Army elements that had moved into Manchuria 
after the defeat of ,Japan, and its men are said to be deeply conscious of the combat record 
they have inherited (along 'vith the designation, which continues to be used, "new Fourth

Army"). It won the earliest major Communist victories against the Nationalist Army, 
capturing Manchuria and roundly defeating the troops Chiang had dispatched to the North-
east. After that victory, the Fourth moved into North China, "liberated'' Peking, and then 
advanced all the way down into South China. Thus its last major campaign in the Civil

Most, of the Fourth Field Army's men are from Shantung, and either joined the New 
Fourth during the Japanese War or were recruited in Manchuria after the war. (A large 
percentage of the Chinese peasants in Ma aitria are immigrants from Shantung Province.) 
However, the Fourth ftlo ineludes Morigi from Inner Mongolia, along with both captured 
Nationalist troops and former Japanese poppet troops. (The Mongols are in cavalry units, 
which arc of doubtful utility.) 
The Fourth Field Army has from an early moment been the main Chinese force in the 
Korean war. Its Thirty-Eighth, Thirty-Ninth, Fortieth and Forty-n;eeoad Armies made 
the first contacts with the united Nations Forces in the western sector of Korea, and its 
Fiftieth and Sixtya`-;ixth Armies joined in the clash soon afterward. (The Fiftieth Army is 
the old Nationalist Sixtieth Army, with its original high-ranking officers, except that political 
officers have been added to it. This Army has been called upon to do much of the heaviest 
fighting for the Chinese Communist regime, and it is estimated that. less than 20 percent 
of its original number have survived. The Communists apparently set out, to begin with, 
to test its loyalty, and seem to have regarded it., all along, as expendable. It is by no means 
certain that the Fourth Field Army has preserved its traditional characteristics, what with 
its continued heavy losses in Korea and its absorption of large numbers of replacements. 
But the Communists continue to play it up in their propaganda as the old New Fourth, 
and to attribute to it all the qualities that once made it, by reputation at least, the elite of 
the PLA. 
The Commander in Chief of the Fourth Field Army, General I,in Piao, is generally 
considered the ablest strategist and theoretician the Communists have, especially because 
of his performance at the time when the Communists turned their backs on guerrilla opera-
tions and adopted position 11 warfare. 
In spite of its having moved all the way from Manchuria to Hainan Island during the 
Civil War, the Fourth Field Army does not have the Second Field Arrify's reputation for 
skill in maneuver. Lin Piao's operations have been, in general, highly orthodox by con-
temporary military standards, particularly as regards reliance upon railway communica-
tions and mechanized units. In this respect the Fourth Field Army represents the coming 
of age of the PLA, and will almost certainly set the pattern for its future development. 
Besides being far more meehanized than the other Field Armies, the Fourth has led the 
way as regards adoption of Soviet military practices. 
North China Army Group or the "Fifth Field Army." There is a certain amount of 
mystery about this organization, and why it, was not officially set up as the Fifth Field 
Army. As the "palace guard" of Peking, under the direct control of the G IIQ of the PLA, 
it has become a sort of national reserve; and there has apparently been no attempt made to 
raise it to a position of equality v n the other field armies. 
A probable reason why the old North China People's Libeaation Army did not become 
a field army is that it was given the task of garriaomming Peking, the future capital of Com-
munist China, and thus (a) had no subsequent opportunity to gain experience and reputa-
tion in the Civil War, (b) was unable to expand its strength by absorbing captured National-
ist arms and men. The end of the Civil War found it little stronger than it had been at the 
beginning of that conflict, and responsible for a geographic area that was small and com-
paratively weak in resources. Despite the centralization of the PLA, many traditional 
Chinese military practices have survived, including that which leaves each command 
largely on its own, i.e., depehdent on the manpower and resources in its area, for all its 
recruitment and procurement, The command fortunate enough to be located in a rich 
area thus enjoys a considerable advantage over other commands. 
140 
General Nieh Jung-elien is the commander of the North China Army Group. During 
the Sino-Japanese War, Nieh made himself a great reputation as a guerrilla commander. 
But, as noted, he had no opportunity during the Civil War to participate in a major cam-
paign, and is, therefore, still an unknown as far as orthodox warfare is concerned, 
Specialized Units 
The bulk of the C.sommunist Grkrund Forces are in one or another of the field armies. 
Thert., aro, however, certain specialized units, called guerrilla columns, that are to this day 
largely independent of the field armies. Guerrilla oper:&ons, as is well known, contributed 
greatly to the Communists' rise to power, and the regime, in part 1.,..haps for sentimental 
reasons, has clearly been reluctant to compromise the integrity of the guerrilla organiza-
tions. (During the Civil War the guerrilla org,anizations not only distinguished themselves 
in combat, but in fifth column and intelligence operations for the larger military aggrega-
tions.) It has, in any case, left them under the direct control of the GIN of the 1)1.A. They 
range in strength fori 4,000 to 15,000 men. have been thoroughly modernized, and train 
as independent units for the performance of specialized missions. What functions they 
might he assigned in a completely modernized PLA is a matter for conjecture, but their 
major task at present is to conduct operations against N a lit )11:11i,-t gi ic mlias on the main-
land, and to provide mobile support for the lots inlit ia. (They are likely to see further 
service in Southeast Asia, i.e., in support of the Communist forces in Indo-(.'hina and 
Burma.) 
The columin..; have been given area designations, not numerical ones. these 
indic ;e, 
in each case, the area in which the column operates amid thus that from which its men are 
recruited. The most important of these, eight in number, are: (1) Kwangtung-kwangsi 
(or Liang Kuang) Column, commanded by General Taane, Shelia. (2) Fukien-hWangtung 
Column (Nlin Ytieh Border Double Column), commanded by re..., Fang, who is also Vice-
Chairman of the Kw angtung Provincial Government. (3) Central Kwahgtung (or Yireli-

Division Organization 
The PIA employs the so-called "rule of three": three divisions to each army and three 
regiments to each division. Preseet estimates place the size of the average PlA division 
at 7,0(X) men, hut as more Soviet equipment is adopted the size of the division ',yin probably 
increase to approximately 10,000 to 11,000 men. 
The most striking feature of the divisions in the PIA is the power and functions of the 
political officers:. In each division there is a Political Commissar and a Deputy (....oitunissar 
who, rank wise, are at the level of the division commander. There is also a Political Section, 
which is charged with responsibility for such areas as pri,paganda, organization, internal 
security, "popular movement" gnaws, and political indoet mat i(in of troops. (The role 
and funetkins of the political officers will be discused in detail later.) 
In spite of the manpower needed fur the political sect a >n:!, and their internal security 
activities, the division slice (army-wale) in the P1 .A is extremely hiw: according to mane 
estimate, slightly over 11,000 men fur a a asathiiian division. Tina is partly (ilia to the fact 
that the PI.A makes extensive use of civilian labor for line-of-conormuicat ions and supply

work, and partly due to its practice of living off the local land for many of its requirements. 
Even so, this statistic is remarkable, and doubly so in view of the extent to which the Chinese

clearly, is that the combat troops themselves perform numerous functions that, in other

There are differences here from division to division, but the general practice is to have 
numerous men forward who share a weapon with somebody else and are expected to retrieve

People's Militia 
The Chinese Communists have sought to build up a reserve of military trained per-
sonnel in the form of a People's Militia. Initially the plan was to establish a citizen army 
and even, as was sometimes suggested before the end of the Sino-Japanese War, to have it 
replace the regular Army altogether. Even luring the Civil War period, however, the 
Militia never developed into a serious military organization, and while the regime has 
launched a program looking to its expansion on a considerable scale, there is now no talk 
of its ever replacing the regular Army or even of its engaging in major combat operations as 
distinct units. 
The major present function of the People's Militia is to provide manpower for the 
PLA. Its individual members who demonstrate abilities the PLA needs are soon recruited 
or drafted into the ranks- Sometimes, indeed, whole units of the Militia have been called 
up by the PLA its replacements. 
on paper t_he plans for the People's Militia state that all able-bodied men from 18 to 
35 years of ri4i shall be required to join the Militia. But there are very few if any areas of 
China in which this poliey has been carried out. 
The goo] ot noi versiti r,wmt,i,rAnp Un the Mintier does not appear to have been dictated 
by military considerations (e.g., that of maintaining a reserve of maximum size for the 
PI,A), but rather by the hope that get t ing everyone into the Militia would attenuate the 
regime's internal security problem. The Communist indoctrination program, for example, 
would by this means automatically reach the entire population of potential bearers of arms, 
and it. would be possible to punish ideological dissidents and subversive elements under 
military rather than civil few. In short, the People's Militit should not be thought of as a 
serious (actual or potential) military factor in eetimating Communist China's capabilities. 
It is a major policing and indoctrination organization, capable in a pinch of supplying 
manpower for the Army. This is borne out by the type of training the members of the 
Militia receive, which is wholly inadequate from the standpoint of modern warfare. 
Political Control in the PLA 
The organization of the PLA at all levels reflects a deep concern, on the part of Red 
China's leaders, about ideological indoctrination and internal security, both as distinct 
problems and as different as.peets of One and the same problem. Thus Political Officers or 
Commissars have been placed on all echelons of the PLA, and assured adequate authority 
by setting up an independent chain of command for their operations. 
The first and n ost conspicuous function of the Political Officer is that of maintaining 
the purity of the Communist line within the organization to which he is assigned. . Ile has 
the say, subjeet to correction only by his superiors, as to what the line is at any moment on 
any particular subject, and what are its implications and presuppositions. A second func-
tion is that of propagating the line among the troops, especially during training and rest 
periods, which is when the indoctrination program tends to he pushed. A third function, 
which comes into its own when the unit is actually fighting, is that of riding herd on troop 
morale, i.e.. checking and observing morale, and intervening to raise it when it is giving way 
before the hardships of combat. 
Because of the third of the three functions just mentioned, no Political Officer can 
ossiidv confine himself to problems within the immediat e domain of ideology. For example, 
political officers have been known to put preseere on the supply organizations, to insure the 
delivery of the materials they deem essential from the standpoint of morale. Here, inci-
dentally, is the point at which the Political Officers are most likely to interfere with the 
operations of the purely military eflicers. And it is a sale guess that as the Political Officers 
144 
? 
? 
' 
, 
learn more and more about the problems of morale they will be increasingly tempted to 
make their influence felt in the field of logistics, since it is here they must go ultimately for 
what it takes to stop gripes. 
To date the Political Officers in the PLA do not appear to have interfered much with 
the activities of the military commanders. Most particularly they seem to have used 
sparingly the power, which undoubtedly rests in theme o over-rule military decisions. 
There are several reasons for this. In the first place. most of the Political Officers, not to 
say all, have received e? ant military traiaing, and do not think of themselves yet as 
competent. to judge whether a given military decision is ?ell-advised. In the second place, 
the PLA eo?""thders are not merely professional military TIW11; they are also tried and 
tested Communists, so that the Political Office: who challenged a deriSiOn by one of them 
on political grounds would lw up against the fact that the presumption is in favor of their 
ah,,hite political loyalty and of their k nowledgcabilit y about what political loyalty 
implies in the military field. 
It should not be inferred from the absence or trouble up to the present time that the 
regime will always be able to avoid conflicts between these two important skilled groups. 
Soviet experience suggests that the confliets are unavoidable, and are likely to occur when 
the Political Offivers, having been a bOtl t for a long while, become sure of themselves; and, 
beeine learned a Ihing or ill:0 ai)(a)t 1111iitarV operations. begin to entertain erin'ems of 
their own on military questions whieh they are more and more i0111PtCd to express to or 
even impose on the commanders. This is the tillwe likely to happen because of the close 
relationship between morale and command behavior: it is they who are ultimately respon-
sible for morale, and the commanders alone who are in it positicni to do something about it. 
The temptation to overrule decisions they regard as likely to have it pernicious effect on 
monde will, when the going is rough, be very strong. 
The relationship between the Political Officers and the troops is somewhat inure com-
plicated. The tremendous power of the Political Commissars, and their constant pro-
fessional concern about what the troops are saying and thinking, automatically places them 
in a position where their charges art' SUIT to regard them as natural enemies - if for no 
other reason than because they can mete out violent punishment, not merely within the 
unit but to a man's family. Not many of the profe.s.sional soldiers in the PLA, moreover, 
are likely to get interested in the political materials with which the Political Officer is for-
ever trying to indoctrinate them. What they are likely to feel is that the Political Officer 
gets in the way of military routine and eiheiency. The fact that indoctrination inure or less 
monopolizes the tinie of the troops when they are in reserve is it further potential source of 
trouble. For these are the periods when, but fur the indoctrination, the troops would be 
free to amuse themselves or at least do what the, like; and, partieularly if the speeches and 
lectures are tiresome, they can be counted on to grow restive and blame the Commissar. 
This consideration, however, undoubtedly cuts both ways: sonic soldiers will find the 
political activities directed by the Commissars both interesting and relaxing, and will react 
to them in terms of lessened fear of the Political Officers' powers. 
It is extremely difficult to predict troop reaction to the induced nat ion act ivitics of t he 
Political Officer:3, particularly since as the civilian indtwtrination program gets inti. high 
gear reactions to it in the military field will become increasingly complex. (hie great 
strength the P(ditical Officers have, when it c.';rric:; to obtainin;r? support from or at least 
acceptance by the men lies in the fact that they are teaching a great number of the illiterates 
in the PLA to read arid w rite, which iorans, in China, that a very considerable percentage

On balance, it acems improbable that the favorable reactions to the Political Officers 
will outweigh the negative ones, especially in combat conditions, when it becomes the task 
of the pofitieal Officers to urge the men on to greater sacrifices. The Political Officers are 
more rather than less vulnerable on this point because they are with the Army but not part 
of it, because this means that the demands for greater sacrifices emanate, as far as the troops 
are concerned, from a non-military source. They are more vulnerable again because the 
demands, being politically motivated, will often not, make sense militarily, and the men, 
whose point of view in combat conditions can be counted on to be highly military, will 
regard them as unreasonable. 
The role of the Political Commissars affords numerous opportunities to enemy psy-
chological warfare against the PIA. For most effective results, however, direct attacks on 
them should be avoided in favor of all-out exploitation of the situation created in the PLA 
by their very existence. Psychological warfare campaigns can, for example, move in vigor-
ously on the troops' anxieties about, internal security agents. Any serious question it can 
raise as to the loyalty of elements or individuals in the iii?LA will automatically cause the 
Political Officers to behave in a manner that will threaten the security of the individual 
soldier and of the unit to Which he belongs. The Political Officers, moreover, are sure in any 
tight situation to make promises to the troops that cannot be kept, and those that arc not 
kept will be made-to-order themes for psychological warfare output. 
Two further points are ib order here: The Commisaars' activities automatically bring 
the political element in the war into an unusually close relationship with military operations. 
Psychological warfare will therefore be able (though against a 'Western army it would 
hardly dare) to stress the contrast between the expressed political aims of the Communists 
and the actual conditions in which the men find themselves. The fact, that the Political 
Officers will have reduced somewhat the political apathy of the Chinese soldier means, 
moreover, that the latter will be much easier to address and influence on the political leve/ 
than he would have been if the PLA had no such officers. 
Personnel of the PLA 
Much has been written about an alleged traditional antipathy on the part of the 
Chinese toward military life and war. The point may or may not be valid as far as the 
earlier periods of Chinese history are concerned, but even if it is it would be a mistake to 
assume that the present-day Chinese do not make good soldiers or that they instinctively 
dislike the military. The social status of the soldier in traditional Chinese society was, to be 
sure, relatively low, and the upper classes and the better educated still feel that military 
service should be left to the peasant and laboring classes. But. the Communists have been 
remarkably successful, propaganda-wise, in dramatizing the role of the soldier in the society' 
of the future. Similarly, the PLA has been able to inculcate in its troops a kind of pride and 
esprit de corps that was conspicuously lacking in earlier Chinese armies, and has offered the 
individual soldier rewards and social prestige that he could never have won as a civilian. 
The power of the military in civil administration and other activities that affect day-to-day 
living on the part of civilians has also tended to raise the social status of soldiers. Nor 
should it be forgotten, in this connection, that it was through their armies that the Commun-
ists were able to obtain powr in can-- The Communists know that their rule rests upon 
the military power that they command. 
This does not mean, however, that a majority of the men in the PLA are happy about 
being in the Army. At most it means that on the verbal and symbolic levels the Com-
munists have offered their soldiers not inconsiderable rewards, which have overcome many 
traditional Chinese attitudes toward the individual soldier. Even the soldiers who are 
146 
Mita 
' 
generally dissatisfied with. Army life, and continue to serve only because they have to, are 
pleased at the fact that the regime is attempting to raise the prestige of the military pro-
fession and that, meantime, soldiers are officially regarded as members of a superior class. 
Morale in the PLA appears to go up with military suceesses and down with military 
reverses. When the Communists achieved their great victories in the Civil War, general 
morale in the PLA was, according to the available evidence, extremely high. The men 
identified themselves with the "wave of the future," and believed that they were making 
the destiny of Chinese society. Nit in the presence of military setbacks this spirit has 
always crumpled fast, and it will probably crumple fast in any major war the PLA may 
fight in future as soon as things begin to go badly for it. 
Background of the PLA Soldier 
It seems probable that not less than 90 percent of the PLA manpower comes from 
peasant backgrounds. The percentage is considerably smaller if we fix at on officers 
only, but here also the pereent age is considerably higher than in most other modern Chinese 
armies. 
The life the Pie:Vs men knew before 111,1110 ion was a hard one which, with little in the 
way of comforts. offered a dreary round of meager food, inadcqinite elothing, ;AA hard toil. 
Most therefore find life in the PLA at least tolerable, and many no doubt feel that they 
have "never had it so rood." Thee never eNpt7.cted to be pampered either in or outside of 
the Army, and so long as it meets for them .'''rt an minimum standards, very low ones 
according to Western notions. they are likely to accept the strict discipline and hard work 
associated with their military service ?vithout much complaint.. 
Despite the statement above about peasant origins, the men of the PLA differ greatly 
among themselves as regards certain background characteristics. For one thing, they are 
drawn from all over China, thus from many quite distinct geographic arena. And there are 
sharp differences as regards length of service in the PLA and extent r identification with the 
Communist cause. 
Recent estimates of the composition of the PLA show the following military back-
ground of PLA troops: (a) 15 percent are veterans of 1Vorld War 11; (b) percent, veteran 
of the entire Civil War; (e) 30 percent, ex-Nationalist troops (also veterans of World War II); 
(di 30 percent have been inducted into service since about 19.18.? 
These figures tend to obseure the fact, an important one to keep in mind, that the PLA 
has numerous professional military met: in its ranks who have spent most of their adult life 
in one army or another. These professionals are the hard core of the PLA from the stand-
point of technieal skill. Even they, however, belong to distinct categ,ories, which would 
have to be taken carefully into account in connection with any attempt to predict their 
behavior. They include men who are: (a) professional Communists, former members of 
the Eighth Route Army, and loyal Party members; b) former Nationalists, who tend to 
be apolitical and wiii fully accept their present political masters so long as they can continue 
their military careers; (Cl former Nationalists who take a more or leas dim view of com-
rnuraL?;rn but see (and have) no realistic alternative to continued military service; (d) former 
Nationalists who are more or k'S:7, Nvilling to go along with the Communists politically; and, 
(e) professional soldiers, who have never had any strong political feelings and look to the 
army only for satisfaction of certain personal goals. Prolonged military service in one and

the same army may in the long nm give these professionals numerous common charac-
teristics and attitudes. But psychological warfare can safely assume that the qualities 
that differentiate them frem one another are more important and critical than those that 
they have in common. 
Conscription and Period of Service 
The PLA has no fixed periods of service, so that the individual who is inducted into it 
can look forward to no specific date at which he will be free to return to civilian life. One 
remains in the Army until one is physically no longer capable of performing one's duties. 
There is not even any organized system of release, and although Art iele 2.5 of the Common 
Program states that "revolutionary.' servicemen" shall receive public care at the time of 
retirement, it seems improbable that any of them take such promises seriously. It is 
known, moreover, that the Political Officers do not, in their indoctrination programs, stress 
this individualistic feature of the Communist program, which suggests that no one expects 
the relevant plan to materialize. 
Men who are no longer physically fit for military service are either permitted to go 
home or are drafted into the Labor Bat taliens, which although formally a part of the mili-
tary establishment are not under the same ministry as it. (These Labor Battalions are 
used on large government projects like conservation, river control, dam eonstruction, and 
railroad and highway building.) Life in these battalions is much more like that of the sol-
dier than that of the civilian. 
One of the principal reasons why the Communists have not introduced an organized 
system of discharging men from the PLA is undoubtedly that. they know the Chinese 
evonomv to be incapable of absorbing large numbers of veterans, and fear that the dis-
chitrgees, if unable to find satisfactory eivi"ss occupations, would put their military skills 
to use in banditry and subversive activity. The same fear has caused the Communists, 
all along, to recruit, most of the former Nationalist troops they have captured, despite their 
dubious loyalty to the Communist regime. 
The Communists still rely upon the traditional "rope and tie" system of recruiting 
new men, the essence of which is that "recruiting" officers descend upon peasants in the 
fields and impress them into the Army. They have, however, attempted to set up a kind of 
quota ;eye:etre under ;v1in?h each county or ks-ien is assigned a quota of young men, and which 
it proceeds to fill by any methods it sees fit to use. 
All members of the PLA, however recruited, are officially called "volunteers." The 
Communists carefully preserve the fiction that all members joined the PLA by an act of 
individual choice. 
The need for replacements in the Korean war has driven the PLA back on the "rope 
and tie" system, especially in the rural areas. Even the People's Militia had proved unable 
to supply the need for recruits. For the most part the quota system is fiction. 
Pay 
The pay PLA members receive is so low as to be almost negligible. Even the officers 
do not receive enough money either to accumulate any savings or to buy goods and services 
in the civilian market. The Army, however, provides all the basic essentials of life, and the 
;nen have little free time, thus scant opportunity to spend money. (The complaint that 
their pay was too low did not appear in the list of the complaints articulated by Chinese 
POWs in the interrogations in Korea.) 
The fact that the pay in the PLA is so low as to prevent the men from operating in the 
civilian economy means that the Chinese soldier suffers genuine social discrimination, and 
is set apart from all the other important. groups in rho v Civilians know that the 
148 
? 
50-Yr 2014/06/04: CIA-RDP81-01043R003900090002-4 
? 
4 
soldier is not able to pay for goods and service, and, despite the strictness of PLA dis-
cipline, there is a deep fear on their part that he will resort to violence and obtain what he 
wants by looting and confiscation. This is a real barrier to the Communist attempt to raise 
the et atus of the military class in the evea tif puhlic opieioti. it is improbable that many 
PLA men realize that it is their low pay that. complicates their relations with civilians, 
'1'hey merely accept the fact that soldiers are poorer than civilians. (Actual figura s on pay 
rates are meaningless since they do not, if given in terms of the exchange rate between the 
People's Currency and the I. dollar, indicate real purchasing power in the Chinese economy. 
The low pay for officers apparently causes more difficulties than the low pay for 
enlisted men. The officers, necessarily, move more often in civilian quarters, and are more 
Ii eiv to be frequently reminded of their relatively low prestige. Officers in the PLA are the 
paymasters of all the troops under their rommand, and some Communist repiirts indicate 
that PLA officers are following the traditional practice of padding the rolls with imaginary 
individuals and failing to report casualties so as to increase the sums of money at, their 
disposal. The Communists have sought to prevent their doing this by organizing Economy 
Committees, requiring that all payments and expenditures be posted, and riuthorizing the 
Political Commissars to report any such malpractices. 
Rations 
Rations in the PLA are far from generous. The POWs niterrogated in Korea speak 
frankly of this inadequacy, although, as noted, they are silent about their low wages. 
In more or less normal conditions as regards supplies, the PLA soldier is given about. 
enough food to satisfy basic hunger, but not enough to keep food from being the subject of 
constant thought and discussion throughout the ranks. The usual practice is to serve two 
meals a day, the second one at shout 1(41)0, i.e. well before the end of the work (lay. The 
meals are extremely simple: steamed wheat bread usually, or, in the South, rice with two 
vegetables and tea. The daily quota is approximately 31.2 ounces of grain ince in South 
China and millet in the North) and 10.0 ounces of vegetables. Merit is not served every 
day, arid when it is served the per-man quota for a day is about 1,.1 ounces. 
The regime has provided space for vegetable gardens in most of the main military 
bases, so that the troops can grow s(ime of their own foof I and help hold (loivn the expenses 
of the military establiehrnent. The gardens are planted and cared for either by the i
vidual soldier or hy a unit in which he "volunteers" to work: The expectation is that the 
gardens shall account for about one-quarter of the troops' food. 
The PLA has neither the organization nor the equipment it would need in order to 
provide suhstantial quantities of food in combat situations. The troops are normally 
expected to live entirely off the land, or rather each soldier is expected to, :inlet- no at tempt 
is made to maintain company messes, and field rations are practically unknown. men 
often go without food for extended periods of time even while actually fighting. 
There is a marked difference, both in quality and in quantity, in the food provided for 
officers and that provided for enlisted men %viten, mcses are maintained. The officers eat 
at a separate mess, and have their own cooks. This is one of the few conspicuous privileges 
of the officers in the PLA, and the troops, when in the past food has been in particularly 
short supply, have shown marked resentment about it.

of a man's comolianee with military regulations. Both the Political Commissars and the 
military commanders have the power to punish, and practically speaking there is little 
difference between the type of misbehavior with which they deal. 
The PLA maintains so-called Revolutionary 6oldier Committees, through which the 
enlisted men make certain decisions regarding breaches of discipline. But the powers of 
these committees are highly eircurnseribed, besides which they are made up of loyal Com-
munists who are only too ready to bark up the Political Officer or the military commander. 
The discipline in the PLA is strict in the extreme, severe punishments being imposed 
even for very minor infractions of the regulations. Punishment is determined with an eye 
not only to the book but also the need at the particular moment for an "example." Execu-
tions and physical beatings always take place, as one would expect from the foregoing 
statement, in the presence of the entire unit. 
The PLA has nevertheless eliminated much of the arbitrariness of the discipline main-
tained in the traditional Chinese armies. The officers at company level and below are 
mostly men who have risen from the ranks, and for the most part treat their men fairly. 
Cases of arbitrary cruelty on the part of an officer toward an enlisted man are very rare. 
Thus the soldiers accept the discipline, severe as it is, as one of the haidships of army life 
in general, and do not, apparently, react to it in terms of direct hostility toward their 
immediate superiors. 
Soldiers in the PLA have few privileges arni although the Communists are attempting 
to raise the prestige of the military as a whole, the individual soldier sees a great deal more 
of the stick than of the carrot. For example, it is almost impossible for a PIA alder to 
get permission to marry. There is no organized system of furloughs and passes; indeed, the 
individual soldier can count himself lucky if he can get home for a visit once every two years. 
The men accept the fact that once they are in the Army they have to give up close ties with 
home, and do not expect to see much of their families until after they leave the service. 
When a unit is stationed in a small village or in the countryside, its men are sometimes 
allowed to mix freely with the civilians, though the foregoing statement about passes still 
applies. But when it is stationed near a large city, its men are held in close check, and it is 
not uncommon for a PLA man to be in easy reach of a large city fer weeks on end and never 
once be allowed to go visit it on his own. 
The ',,.!ete ofeqeirs just described is to some extent, no doubt, tied up with the low 
pay scale, and the notion that the men will, penniless as they are, get into trouble if they 
mingle much with civ;lians. Also, the PLA has been on the march through so much of its 
history that furloughs and passes would have been out of the question. What is primarily 
involved, however, is a conviction on the part of the commanders that the men should 
regard military life as a full-time business, and that even during periods of routine garrison 
duty all their time, energies, and interest should go on their military activities. 
Training 
PLA training is mostly a matter of political indoctrination and hard physical labor, 
eepecisny extensive marching. Weapons and ammunition are in such short supply that 
giving the men much opportunity to fire weapons and improve iheir marksmanship is out 
of the question. (Troops have often been thrown into combat without ever having fired 
their weapons.) This does not mean, of course, that the PLA consists entirely of men who 
do not know how to take care of themselves on the field of battle; rather it has seen a great 
deal of combat in recent 'ears, and has, in consequence, a considerable incidence of well-
trained and experienced veterans. But the gap that divides veterans from green troops, 
because the latter do not. train with live ammunition, is wider than in any other modern 
army. 
150 
? 
? 
Two to three hours of each day's training are set aside for political indoctrination 
sessions. These are devoted to lectures by the political officers and to "self-eritieism." In 
the stAf-eriti;riarn In?.'?etitags the Lkien diuss vriou politic.a1 or aocia: questions, hear the 
Communist Line presented, and comment on it. 'rhe soldier who expresses disagreement 
with an official position is asked to relele his entire life history, and is shown, little by little, 
how his "reactionary background" makes it difficult for him to understand the position of 
the "people." Usually group pressure and the fact that a Political Officer is present are 
enough to prevent anyone from taking genuine issue with the Line. 
The military training offered is, by VS standards, poor. The veterans and 
NCOs instruct the recruits informally .n a.11 1 
. phases of military and combat activities and, 
although they are men skilled in combat they are not necessarily competent instructors, 
The instruction, moreover, given its informality, is unavoidably uneven. In some units the 
veterans take great pride in being instructors and in getting arross ?vhat they know; in 
others they tend to treat their knowledge as all ASSet that would he lost if it were shared 
with somebody. 
Tht, cr?minunists have had to rely upon the ex-Nationalist troops as instructors in the 
more modernized and technical fields, especially tanks, artillery, bazookas, and motor 
vehicles. This means, of course, 11,itig instructors whesse own training. was in American 
Army techniques. No data are available as to 
1,1 1? quality of the instruetion. 
The dominant feature of the training and of life in general in the PLA is, as 
noted previously, the hard physical labor that all must perform. The fact that little or 
nothing is mechanized makes it necessary to utilize the troops' o??ii physical strength in 
even the simplest operation. Besides finding then 1 
se.ves called upon to serve as pack-
animals for practically all of their equipment, the PLA soldiers are required to produce 
individually certain essential Nupplies. The gardening activities mentioned previously are 
only one .example, for the regime eports that in Sinkiang province alone as of 1950 the 
Army was operating 85 flour milk, 37 coal pits, 3 weaving 3 p'per mills, and 2 gold 
mine.. Even top-grade combat units are obliged, when on garrison duty, to du common 
labor on public works, e.g., river control projects and the conatruction of railroads, high-
ways, and dams. 
One of the major complaints of POWs in Korea is that "life in the PLA" is "too hard," 
a reference not to the discipline but to the daily output of aheer physical energy. The long 
training marches, night marches in particular, were mentnined by POW after POW as 
major ordeals. Undoubtedly it is these ordeals that have made the PLA one of the toughest 
fighting forces in Cinnese history., predictably able to withstand extraordinary hardships 
in any future war. 
Officer Training 
Most. of the inie officers of Ow PLA, having risen from the ranks, have had iittle or no 
formal military traming. During the lied Army's early years, at least up to the time when 
the PLA 's leaders set out to moderniw it , there were great advaiit ages in using officers of 
this type_ But that is no longer the ease. The PLA can mi longer afford to have the high 
incidence of illiteracy that is part of the price it pays for using officers up fr an the ranks; 
and it needs officers capable, as they are not likely to be if they come up from ranks, of 
developing the technical skills required in modern warfare. 
Since the end of the Civil War, therefore, the Communists have c,-AltidUlid.'d a consider-
able number (fait less than a dozen) of military academies. Until I t119 the chief Ionia ion 
of these academies was to provide junior officers for the held Armies, which aceordingiv

had them under its direct control. Today, all the academies are under the direction of the 
011Q of the PLA. (The central academy is located at Peking, and has an enrollment of 
about four thousand men.) 
The fact, that the academies are under OlIQ shows that they are thought of as the 
source of the etaff and general officers of the future, for all that the training lasts only for 
a year or two. 
The training emphasizes political indoctrination above all, thus indicating that the 
basic essential for future high officers in the PLA is, in the Communists' view, loyalty to 
the regime. 
Life in the military academies is no less austere than that in the PLA, and the discipline 
no less strict. The instruction in military science is, in general, of a highly elementary 
character. The tactics and strategy utilized by the PLA during the Civil War campaigns 
figure prominently in the curriculum. Some of the materials and principles the academies 
teach came originally (torn the US Army, but the current emphasis is upon introducing 
Russian practices. 
At the present. time there are no advanced training schools, although some of the more 
promising young officers are sent to RW7,-5ia for further study. Specialized skills have to be 
learned in the field. 
A survey of the fifty-two most prominent generals in the PLA, including seven ex-
Nationalists, shows that twenty-seven have apparently received no formal military educa-
tion, that seven have attended Soviet schools, that, two of the former Nationalists once 
studied in Japan, and that the remainder attended Chinese military academies.* Some of 
the latter, however, had notoriously low standards. (Among them are the academies estab-
lished by the provincial governments before the Revolution of 1911.) 
The lack of formal military training is not the only educational deficiency of the officer 
class of the Red Army. About one-half of the PLA's top leaders did not, for example, attend 
school beyond the first ten grades, and some of the older staff officers even at Field Army 
level are illiterate. Since the enlisted men have even less educational background, no other 
conclusion is possible then than that the PLA is, man for man, the %lost uneducated of the 
world's large Armies. 
The lack of officers with training and experience at staff level is one of the greatest 
weaknesses of the Communist Army. The present generals of the PLA learned their mili-
tary science in the school of experience, mostly with guerrilla warfare. Until the later 
stages of the Civil War, indeed, moat of them had never faced anything Eke the responsi-
bilities Of command in positional warfare. To some extent, to be sure, they have been able 
to apply to their new tasks the principles picked up in directing small-scale operations. For 
the most part., however, they have had to learn a new type of warfare as the PLA has become 
a National Army. They were greatly helped in this, at the when they needed help 
most urgently, by advisors from the USSR. These advisors have stayed on, and still 
deeply influence the tactical and strategic thinking of the top commanders. 
Health 
One of the PLA's biggest problems is that of providing adequate .aedical care for its 
men. (This, ot course, is an aspect of the much wider problem faced by China as a whole, 
namely, that of run..ng an economy and a military machine with a population which, 
because of ill health, cannot deliver the performance its numbers would suggest.) Up to 
the present time, its standards in this reepect have been a matter of applying a single general

Even this rule, however, could be made effective only if the PLA were far better supplied 
with docteee and medical equiya-nent than it is. Thus there is a high mortality rate in the 
PLA'e troika, oh, loealy the result, in large part, of requiring heavy physical exertions .frum

The PLA, like China as a whole, has only a fraction of the doctors it needs. In 19111 
there were only 13,417 registered doctors in all China, i.e., one doctor for approximately 
thirty-three thoueend people. The US Army Surgeon General's Office estimates that not 
much more than half of these doctors (8,000) are capable of meeting minimum I.'S military 
standards, and of them, of course, only a fraction are available to the Army. 
No figures are available as to the num')er of doctors in the N.A. It is imprk.ibahle that 
the ratio of doctors to men would exceed 1 to 3,000. At the end of World War II the 
Nationalist Army, far better c!quipped from the standpoint of mild am nu.7dicine, hal only 
1,922 qualified doctors, 18 dentists, 3S1 nurses, and ?13S technical personnel. Large numbers 
of Chinese doctors fled fr 
e hell the Cemmuniet a were coming to powem, which 
means that there are fewer qualified doctors out in the civilian populatnm whom the PI .A 
can conscript. 
The Communists have attempted to meet this problem by rapid training of additional 
personnel. But it is well known, qualified doctors cannot IA.. produced by speed-up 
techniques. 
According even to Communist statistica, there are more than one hundred million 
people in China who need medical care that they are not get ling. Perhaps the most dramat ic 
relevant statistic has to do with the nation's hospital resources: 2,0(X) hospitals with a total

recevering from a wound arc extremely skilder. I/rugs and medical supplies, for instance; 
are in short supply at all eehelons. 
The chief promise the PLA 15 mu ie to hold out to the man who thinks he might be 
wounded is that it will try, when the moment comes, to remove him from the inunednite

for transporting hospital cases. The mere presence of so many stretcher bearers is said, 
incidentally, to be quite mnerving to troops about to go into combat, since they are an 
eloquent reminder of the PLA'a, willingnesse to accept vast numbers of casualties in any 
combat operation. 
Psychological warfare should continually stress the theme that the Communists are 
incapable of taking care of their wounded, and that we are in a position to offer medical 
assistance to all who need it. 
Logistics 
Until the latter stages of the Civil War the Chinese Communists had little need to 
concern themselves about problems of logistics. The Red Army lived, during its guerrilla 
phase, entirely off the land, and depended for specifically military supplies on the Nationalist 
supply centers it raided from time to time. The fact that it commandeered its food tended 
to alienate the peasants, whose support was sorely needed in the guerrilla campaign, except 
as their feelings could be soothed with promises of the rewards they would receive when the 
Communists came to power. (The Communists paid for such goods and services as they 
took from the villagers in their own currency or in IOUs. This gave many of the peasants 
a reason for supporting the Communists far more persuasive than the Party's agrarian 
program. Only if the Communists came to power could they hope eventually to realize 
the value of the paper promises they ended up holding.) 
The Red Army developed great skill in extracting military equipment from the enemy. 
In this way, throughout the war years the Communists were able, without any regular 
system of supply of their own, to add continuously to their total stock of equipment, so 
that at the end of the war they had more supplies than at the beginning. After the war 
they obtained large quantities of former Japanese military equipment ? especially in 
Manchuria, where they were helped in this sense by the Russian Army. And during the 
Civil War they acquired a good deal of former US Army equipment from defeated National-
ist units. 
The need to depend upon the enemy for supplies dictated, to some extent, the strategy 
and tactics employed by the Communists, e.g., their refueal to engage in positional warfare, 
and their practice of first capturing a city, then milking it of supplies, and then giving up 
control of it. 
When the Communists decided to reorganize the PLA into a National Army, they were 
forced 'o adopt more conventional ways of handling their logistical problems. One great 
advantage they have had in this connection is their clear grasp of the fact that many Chinese 
armies of the past were less effective than they might have been precisely because their 
man-power exceeded their logistical capabilities. The Communiet regime had the courage 
to reduce the numbers of men in the first line units, thus bringing manpower more or less 
into balance with logistics and greatly increasing the effectiveness of at least the better 
Communist units. Since the men in these units were now assured certain minimum amounts 
of necessary materiel, morale improved as a result of the new arrangements. 
As has been mentioned, the Communists elso sought to make the PLA partially self-
support leg by having it undertake its own production activities. (After the Communists 
became responsible for the politeed controi of the country, it was impossible to have the 
troops live off the land as they had when they were actively fighting the Nationalists.) In 
other words, the Communist leaders have never felt it to be necessary for the central govern-
ment to assume the full financial responsibility for the military establishment, as central 
governments do in other countries. 'Al eking the PLA partially self-supporting means not 
only reduced outlays for the actual commodities required, but also reduced expenditures of 
154 
n.,...11.0????????ps..m. - 
energies (and money) on problems of pre/core:neat, and transportation. On the other hand, 
the idea appears to work well only for units that are given prolonged garrison duties. And 
even when it does work weli there are eonie results that must be entered on the other side 
of the ledger. Units that are in the habit of producing a large prop.Irlion of what is required 
to meet immediate needs are, for one thing, unprepared to deal with supply problems under 
conditions of actual combat. In the second place, a unit that is producing for its own use is 
a unit that can be transferred to another Area only at considerable snerifice in terms of 
current production. This is doubly important because the Communists have politieal 
reasons for not keeping a unit in one and the same place for too long a time (the line officers 
might establish pereonal connections with local lead-rs, and thus reduce the effectiveness 
of civilian political control from the center). 
The PLA is still attempting to rely as much as possible upon the troops' producing for 
their own needs. It, is now recognized, however, that this is a cumbersome method of 
handling problems of logistics, though probably a necessary one until the Communist. 
regime feels strong enough financially to support the military establishment via direct 
appropriations. 
One reason for the Communists' attempt to hold down some military expenditures is 
that they are greatly increasing others, i.e., those having to do with modernization and 
mechanization of the forces both of which will add to the PLA logistical problems. For 
there is a great difference between the logistical needs of a guerrilla army and those of a 
modern military force. 
The PLA's modernization program has, among other things, demonstrated anew one 
of China's basic weaknesses as a military power. The Chinese cannot produce the heavy 
equipment a modernized army ii (is, which means that arrangements must be made to 
import it and to provide for its transportation and maintenance within the country. Even 
so simple an item as a truck must be procured abroad, as must all the petroleum products 
essential to a modern army. As the PLA turns its back on foot-power and animal-
drawn vehicles it becomes increasingly necessary to construct a net work of highways and 
roads, since xvithout it the new motorized equipment will be useless. (Even North Korea 
has a more advanced system of highways than most of China.) 
The inadequacy of China's transportation system has obliged the PLA to establish 
supply depots all over the country and, given the difficulty of moving things from one to 
aeo.her, to guard carefully against getting too many supplies in a single place. The PLA 
may, indeed, find itself in a seriously weakened position if it moves to modern means of 
warfare before the economy ran give it efTective logistical support. There is a real danger 
that over-rapid mechanization will seriously reduce its effective fighting power. 
In the attempt to overcome its logistical problems the PLA has greatly expanded its 
staff at Peking, so that the Army, which formerly operated with very little in the way of a 
centralized staff, has now become heavily loaded with bureaucrats. The appearance in 
China of Russian advisors arid specialists has accentuated this trend. This is all the more 
consoicuous because expansion of at personnel can never solve the PLA hi real logistical 
problems, even if the expansion takes place in the latter'e name. These problems are tied 
up with In economic and social conditions in China, and will persist until China 
is more extensively industrialized and less dependent upon a predominantly agricultural 
economy. 
The PI,A's major strengths in the field of logistics are (al The tight police efintrol that

acceptance of his low standard of living. Because of this, the PLA does not require the large 
varieties or quantities of sepplies necessary in an American or European army. (c) The 
fact that its operations have thus far been confined to China or immediately contiguous 
areas. This has enabled it to live off the land and avoid dependence upon long supply lines, 
(d) The fact that it is still largely unmeehanized. This has kept any large logistical problem 
from arising in the sensitive area of liquid and solid fuels. The present rate of moderniza-
tion is not so rapid as to bring this problem to a head in the near future. (e) The fact that 
logistical problems ear) now he handled with the direct assistance of qualified Russian 
advisors. It can be expected that PLA staff planning will improve as a result of this 
assistance. 
But the logistical weaknesses of the PLA far outbalance its logistical strengths. The 
principal weaknesses are revealed by the following statements: (a) The PLA has not organ-
ized, or trained personnel for, the large service of supply that a modernized army would 
require. (b) The transportation facilities for rapid large-scale movements of goods do not 
exist over much of Cbinq The railroad system is highly inadequate, and there is no exten-
sive net of highways. The air force is incapable of air-lifting any appreciable tonnage. 
(c) The total personnel of the PLA is entirely out of propo -tion to its present services of 
supply. The commitrnen t o full-scale combat of more than a small part. of the total Army 
at any given time is out of the question if any attempt is to be made to supply the troops 
committed. (d) The medical services of the PLA are completely inadequate. This radi-
cally reduces the PLA's capacity to solve logistical problems by merely assigning more 
manpower to the operation in hand. (e) The PIA lacks senior officers with experience in 
logistics, and thus cannot provide the staff direction essential to rapid development of a 
sound logistical organization. (f) The PLA is obliged to import most of the equipment a 
mechanized army requires. China is incapable of producing, for example, the motorized 
equipment that is essential to a modern army. (g) The fact that troops from different 
geographic areas of China have very different eating habits would place a great strain on 
PLA logistics in any future war situation. (h) The Chinese economy does not afford people 
an opportunity to acquire the mechanical and other types of training required in modern 
logistical operations, and there is no existing skill group in the population capable of staffing 
them. (i) The great variety in types and calibers of weapons used by the PLA creates 
numerous problems of supply and maintenance. (j) The inadequate communications sys-
tem in both the Army and the nation makes it extremely difficult to direct, organize, and 
facilitate supply movements. 
Corn m unications 
The general backwardness of China as far as modern communications are concerned 
is reflected in the PLA'e. own communications system. Radio equipment is scarce and, 
although the Communists were able to capture stocks of field telephones from the National-
ists, wire is in such short supply that they cannot make efficient use of them. 
From the division level down, orders are usually transmitted orally, and there is a 
minimum of paper work. This eliminates paper-pushing and many of its wastes and abuses 
(e.g. the neett to make multiple copies of each order), and might be placed high on a list of 
the negative military virtues the PLA possesses. But it does not dispose of the fact that 
control and coordination is, in the very nature of the case, clumsy, slow, and inflexible. 
Most orders are transmitted by messengers, which normally means that an order that is 
unclear cannot be clarified in time to do any good, so that commanders have to go ahead 
and act, Without the knowledge of higher echelons, on their own initiative. Organizing and 
planning a major movement calling for the coordination of many different units becomes 
156 
???? ??? 
? 
time-consuming in the extreme. Effective control of such movements lap ..es as of when the 
initial orders are executed. In combat conditions, for example, decisions at division and 
below have to be made without communicating with army. 
During the days of guerrilla warfare batudkni commanders were given a great degree 
of freedom, and communications were not essential for effective operations. At present 
the communications problem is critical, since the Chinese have, for good or ill, adopted tic 
large-scale type of organizations that cannot dispense with coordination of a kind that calls 
for rapid and frequent exchanges of messages. This is all the more true because the PLA 
is trying to reproduce in its mass armies the traditions of rapid maneuver and tlexibility 
that characterized the old guerrilla columns, (liven the present communicatiens system, 
and the lack of army control at battalion, the ?vhole attempt is neceaserily (loomed to fail. 
The individual units may be- able to retain their aggressiveness, Inn the lack of coordination 
will, predictably, often have the effect of immobilizing whole armies. 
The PLA's signal equipment is as heterogeneous ae its infantry weapons, partly because 
it includes Japanese, American, Russian, and German items, and partly laasiuse the princi-
pal means of signaling employed is a series of devices such as whistles, bugles, gongs, and 
flags. When a PIA unit sounds its bugles before an attack, this is only partly to unnerve 
the enemy; it is [vainly a signal to the PLA troops themselves. Considerable confusion

In till categories the materiel of the PLA is inferior to that uf any of the world's major 
armies. however, inferences from this fact as to its comhat capabilities are dangerous. 
The Chinese soldier is remarkably adept at taking care of huneelf with whetever equipment 
he happens to have. 
Uniforms 
The men in the PI.A are issued summer and winter uniforms which are worn until it is 
Ito longer possible to patch them. No "spare" tutiforms are issued, and few PLA soldiers 
can afford to purchase even minor accessories. If one sees what ecems an odd aaeortIlleta of 
uniforms in a typical company it is in part because some of the troops are wearing garments 
captured from the enemy, in part because of the patches. 
The PLA has had a hard time providing shoe, for its men. The standard shoe is made 
of cloth and. what svith all the marching the troops are required to do, NVC:it'S out very 
quickly. China's shoe factories simply clitillOt provide enough shoes for an army the size 
of the PLA, and, this being the case, the Communists have called upon the women of China 
to "volunteer- to make shoe; at home and contribute them to the Army. Aside from a 
large quantity of fur-lined boots that once belonged to ite Japanese, the PLA has never 
had significant quantities of leather shoes for its men. Individual soldiers will be found 
wearing l field shoes taken from raptured Nationaliste, but the PI.A itself hes never issued 
footwear of that type. Even in the winter campaigns in Korea few Chinese withers wore 
leather boots.

One of the great weaknesses of the PLA lies in the fact that its weapons are not stand-
ardized. Through almost all its history, the Chinese Communist Army has had to depend 
primarily upon captured enemy stocks for its supplies of weapons and ammunition, which 
has meant that it has had to use ethsever types and calibers of waapons came its way. 
Even today, the PLA is largely dependent upon its captured stocks of Japanese, American, 
Nationalist., and assorted European arms, This is true even in the category of heavy 
weapons, which makes major headaches of bpth ammunition simply and maintenance. 
Spare parts are seldom available, and repairs are either out of the question or so highly 
improvised as greatly to reduce firepower. 
Communist China's capacity to produce munitions, heavy weapons in particular, is 
highly limited. However, more than 70 small arsenals have been set up within China, and 
these, together with the large arsenals developed and expanded by the Japanese in Man-
churia, now produce, according to some estimates, around 50 percent of what the PLA needs 
in the way of small-arms ammunition. They can alao supply most of the required quantities 
of hand grenades, mines, and mortar ammunition. 
The two large NIukden arsenals had been capable of producing fairly heavy munitions 
and ordnance pieces, but American bombing in the Second World War ? and Russian and 
Chinese Communist. looting immediately after the War ? greatly reduced their productive 
capacity in these categories. The Communists have now restored their pre-war levels of 
production. 
The only other major arsenal is in Yangku (Taiyuan), Shansi Province, where produc-
tion is confined to small arms and mortar ammunition. The other arsenals operating in 
Central China before the Communist take-over were either heavily damaged in the Civil 
War or dismantled by the Nationalists, and thus pose a problem not of "reconstruction" 
but of planning and execution of new construction projects. 
The Chinese still produce nothing in the categories of heavy artillery, field artillery, 
anti-tank artillery, anti-aircraft artillery, tanks, and armored combat vehicles. Present 
supplies of these items, and the ammunition to go with them, therefore came either (via 
capture) from enemy sources or from the USSR, and over at least the next ten years (failing 
a large war in which further equipment could be picked up from an enemy) the Soviet 
Union %ill continue to be China's sole source of supply for such equipment. Soviet advisors, 
as pointed out., have been assigned to the PLA for the purpose of hastening standardization 
of its ordnance, and are presumably in position to arrange for the procurement of necessary 
items from Russia. These items continue to be delivered to the Chinese at greatly reduced 
prices, but meeting the required payments is nevertheless a great strain on the Chinese 
economy, and will continue to be throughout the foreseeable future. The arms shipments, 
in other words, are not gifts or subsidies, since the Chinese are evidently billed for every 
item the Russians deliver. Most of it, up to the present time, has been of Russian manu-
facture, but an attempt is now being made to include in these transactions arms produced 
in Czechoslovakia and Eastern Germany. 
Unless shiprs,mts from Russia are forthcoming in unprecedented quantities, the Chinese 
will face a serious interim problem with regard to the standardization of weapons in any 
of the seven & categories the PLA uses on a large scale. Available est:mates of the amounts 
of equipment taken from the Nationalists and the Japanese are rough at best, but it is a 
safe assumption that this equipment will keep on being'used until present stocks of ammuni-
tion are depleted andeor the weapons become unserviceable. For at least the next ten 
years, then, the PLA will continue to make use of a wide variety of weapons, and the task 
of maintaining them and supplying ammunition for then-i will be one of its major staff 
problems.

The PLA, by comparison with other armies, is highly dependent on and skillful in the 
use of mortars, and this also is tied up with the ;awkwardness of the Chinese economy. 
Mortars: are easy io manufacture, And even during World War 11 the Communists produced 
mort ar ammunition in the aiaenals they were able to in the hills around Venan. Their 
present. supplies of such ammunition are, in consequence, reasonably adequate - sufficient, 
at least, to permit training and practice with live ammunition. 
The average PLA reglin.._?nt early in the post-November 1950 phase of the Korean war 
had the following ordnance: 
Rifles  614 50-mm Mortar.... .......... .30

There is reason to believe these regiments were the best-equipped the PLA had. If so, 
it seems a safe assumption that the Communists are :".=:(A 'mga short -run regimental dts--
tribution of ordnance at approximately the level indicated by these figures, which were 
obtained in interrogations of (.'hinese POWs (they represent a composite picture of the 
various r,?giments for which information was obtained). Some of the entries, for example 
the low figure for appear to be open to question. During the Civil Nkrar a Communist 
independent guerrilla battalion of 4-11 men had 3(X) rifles, winch suggests that in the better-
equipped present-day infantry regiment there should be more than 614.? 
Tactics and Strategy 
Formal training and instruction is: tactics and strategy are, even ioday, not highly 
developed in the P ,A, although some attempts have been made to produce training manuala, 
and translations have been made of both and Russian materials. 
The tactics and strategy the P LA actually employs are derived mainly from its experi-
ence in the guerrilla campaigns of World War II and in the Civil War, and thus relate to a 
type of warfare the Communists will not necessarily fight again and reflect a situation of 
availability of resources that no longer exists. 
The PLA has developed exceptional skill at executing strategic movements that. require 
mass mobility. This skill is all the more remarkable in view of the PLA.'s dependence on 
marching rather than mechanized transportation. During the Civil War the Communists 
proved that they could march 50 miles in twenty-four hours and be prepared at the end of it 
to engage immediately in battle. During the Civil War campaigns, this kind of mobility 
enabled the Communists to keep the initiative in their hands, and to select the time and 
place at which they would pin battle. They enniel strike fast and hard where the enemy 
least expected them to be, and complete their withdrawal before the slower-moving Nationtd-
iats could redeploy their forces. 
This strategy involved the adaptation to larger-scale combat of the basic ti...eliniques 
of guerrilla warfare, in which small groups move finickly to deliver blows at the enemy's 
vulnerable points and then disappear before the enemy can marshal his forces for a counter-
einent. e a battii- v.-a,r under 4y, hilv.e.ver, mohilit V proved repeatedly to he lea.t

still able to get their troops to perform remarkable feats of marching, and did so profitably 
where strategic maneuvers were concerned, they often found themselves sorely needing new 
tactics. 
Another powerful faetor that influences the strategy and tactics of the PLA is its 
unavoidable reliance upon riflemen for its main fire power. The PLA has built itself, for 
tactical purposes, around the rifle and the mortar, which is one of the reasons for its remark-
able mass mobility. But it means that it can increase its fire power only by building up 
manpower at or very near the point on which it wishes to put pressure. This greatly increases 
its own i vulnerability, once the additional fire power is built up, to enemy artillery and 
planes. 
In fact , depeodence for fire power upon the particular weapons mentioned is the central 
fact in determining the character of the principal tactical and strategic operations that the 
PLA regularly executes. ft has, for example, always made considerable use of the ambush, 
which not, only dominated its early guerrilla period but continued to be used frequently in 
the Civil War and even in Korea. Without themselves attempting to hold fixed positions, 
the Communists would permit the enemy to maneuver himself into a position where he 
could be trapped in an ambush, which the Communists weie able to set up because their 
weapons were highly portable and could be moved into relatively inaccessible positions ? 
by contrast with the enemy's fire-power, which depended upon more complex means of 
transportation. 
Other tactics that reflect reliance on man-carried weapons are the PLA's famous infil-
trations and night movements. In both of these tactics the Communist objective is to 
achieve surprise and move into a position in which the fighting will take place at close 
quarters. The enemy then cannot employ his heavier weapons to advantage, and the Com-
munists can engage 'urn, on equal terms or better, with platoon weapons. 
PLA's dependence on riflemen as the major source of fire power also aceo its for 
their "human wave" tactics. As a last resort the PLA commanders seek to increase their 
fire-power through great frontal assaults by large InftssCs of troops. They are prepared to 
accept the heavy !oases because only so can they hope to balance off the enemy's heavy 
weapons, the ultimate objective being to create a situation in which they will be able to 
engage him in close in-fighting. here, as in all their other favorite tactics, the Communists 
attempt. to avoid situations in which the enemy's superior fire-power will be decisive, and 
to force the battle into a phase in which only hand weapons count. 
The fact that the PLA is willing to accept tremendous casualties in order to exploit the 
tactical and strategic advantages of mass manpower does not mean that its commanders are 
reckless. In fact, extreme caution dominates much of their tactical thinking. Attacks are not 
attempted unless and until overwhelming numerical superiority has been assured, and pro-
tracted periods of regrouping and planning always separate the attacks. newsy losses are 
acceptable if victory is the quid pro quo (the more since manpower is the resource of which 
the PLA has most If, on the other hand, the issuesis doubtful, the Communist commanders 
tend to be hesitant and cautious. The PLA is an army of revolutionists, hut its tactics are 
decidedly not revolutionary. According to some available evidence, the Russians are urging 
the Chinese to adopt more daring tactics. But ghee": their long history of having to con-
serve and hoard limited stocks of military equipment, and the certainty that for the immedi-
ate future the shortages will persist, it is not surprising that the leaders of the PLA choose 
the more conservative course. Their feelings in the meter are all the stronger, no doubt, 
because of their experience in the Civil War, in whitA they were nearly always able to 
dotermine the pattern and pace of the conflict, and thus to wait foi advantageous situations 
to develop.

These characteristies of Chinese Communist strategy and tactics are clearly visible 
in the Ten Military Principles, which the P1 .A teaches to al! officers and NCOs. Although 
they were developed during the period of guerrilla conflict and came into general usage 
during the Civil War, they continue to be accepted lioet rine throughout ;he Pl A. 
(1) First strike at scattered and isolated enemies, and later strike at concentrated, 
powerful enemies. 
(2) First take the small and middle-sized towns and cities and 
and later take the big cities. 
(3) We take the annihilation of the enemy's fighting strength, and not the holding or 
taking of cit i's and pi.eces, as the major objective. 
(4) In every battle, concentrate absolutely superior forces (double, triple, quadruple
a;dr.t.t 
and sometimes even five or six times those of the enemy),ll encircle the enemy on  
and strive for 1;;'   Strike the o.emy in annihilating combat, striving always 
to concentrate enough forces to annihilate parts of his ;,..:,rees. Avoid battles of alt rition. 
(5) Fight no unprepared engagements. Fight no engagements in which there is no 
assurance of victory. 
(6) Pre-1110ft the 
continuous acthuo of lighting several vegagemeets in succession within a short perhal of 
time without respite. 
(7) Strive to destroy Inc enemy 
emphasis on the tactics of attacking positions and vresting away enemy strong points and 
cities. 
(8) With regard to the question of assaults on cities, resolutely wrest from the enemy 
all strong points and cities which are weakly defended. At favorable opportunities wrest 
all of those hostile points which are defended to a medium degree. Wait uetil conditions 
mature to wrest all enemy strong points which are powerfully defended. 
(9) Replenish ourselves by the capture of all the enemy's arms and most of his per-
sonnel. The source of the men and material of our army is mainly at the front.. 
(10) Be skilled at using the intervals between two campaigns for resting, regrouping, 
and training troops. The period of rest and regrouping should, in general, not be too lung. 
in so far as possible do not let the enemy have a breathing space. 
As can be seen, sonic of these principles are applicable only to civil war conditions. 
others describe actual PLA practice, while still others represent ideals that the PLA is still 
striving to realize. In general, they clearly indicate the type of concepts that dominate the 
tactical and strategic thinking of the PLA's leaders. The emphasis is upon being certain 
of all actions and being highly cautious at decisions, on attemptiug always to exploit 
the enemy's weaknesses, and on offensive operations with the numerical superiority clearly 
on your side. There is, moreover, a close identity between Chinese Communist concepts 
in the field and of military strategy and their concepts in the field of political strategy. 
For them military victories are meaningless unless they include political victories, and 
political activity is ultimately inseparable from military operations. Already in their 
guerrilla warfare phase the Communist military leader', divided their attention between 
political warfare and military operations, and songlo above all to coordinate the two. For 
their guerrilla warfare to be sueeessful, they recognized they had to have I la. general popula-
tion politically sympathetic, or at worst poli'itally apiithetic. They therefore ehannelled 
tremendous energies into political warfare &marches-, and N%ht.'11 per-suasion or promis;es of

always stressed the inability of the Nationalists to protect and defend the "people" and 
always got across the idea that the Communists could win local victories wherever and 
whenever they chose. Thus, though initially inferior in power to the Nationalists and hard 
pressed by them, they were able to maintain the initiative in all local conflicts. 
The Communists realized, however, that they would never be able to gain control of 
the entire country if they continued to practice only a hit-and-run type of warfare. Pin-
pricking the enemy could throw him off balance and harass him, but, it could never achieve 
the major victory that would give the Communists control of the country. Even as they 
continued the tactics of expanded guerrilla warfare, therefore, the Communists were 
organizing rnsm armies. Then, with the acquisition of heavy weapons from the Russians 
after 1945, they slowly shifted over to a more orthodox form of warfare. However, as 
noted, features of the old guerrilla taetiet and strategy still exist in the PLA. The most 
important of these is the concept of the "short attack," which appears to be one of the 
favorite military concepts in the PLA. The short attack consists of limited operations, 
directed at weak points in the enemy's position, in which the objective is not the occupation 
of territory but the destruction of specific enemy forces. Concentration may be either at a 
single point in the enemy's position or at several points. The objective is not to obtain 
either a break-through or envelopment but -rather to annihilate specific elements of the 
enemy. This may be followed by withdrawals for regrouping or by a series of new short 
attacks. 
It may he assumed that much of the strategic thinking of the Communists will be 
changed as the result of the modernization of the PLA and the immediate direction and 
teaching of its Soviet advisors. Soviet doctrine will, almost certainly, become the doetrine 
of the PLA. But this will take time, and in the short run it appears that the Soviet advisors 
are trying, above all, to add to the infantry power of the PLA the supporting power of 
artillery. The results are visible even in the Korean war, where the PLA has been notice-
ably stronger because of the coordination of artillery attacks with infantry assaults. Up 
to the present, however, the Russians have not succeeded in greatly modifying the PLA's 
weapons system, and it can be assumed that only in time will the Russians be in a position 
to provide the armor necessary to alter drastically the PLA's -abilities in this field.

the Southern Military Government under Sun Yat-sen from 1916 to 1918, and in 1924 
was commander of the Cadet Corps of the Whampoa Military Academy. Presumably it 
was at Whampoa that General Chang and Chou En-lai, then Director of Political Training 
at the Academy, established their rriendship, which has enabled Chang during the past 
several years to be a valuable negotiator in Kuomintang-Communist conversations. 
By 1926 Chang had joined the Northern Expedition as Chief of Staff of the 2nd 
Division of the Nationalist Army, but left China in 1927 for travels in the United States 
and Europe. Returning to China in 1929 he served for three years as Dean of the Central 
Military Academy. Throughout the 1930'. he held numerous army commands and in 
1937 was elected to membership in the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, a 
position he held until 1949. Chang was Chairman of the Ilunan Provincial Government 
in 1939 and 1940, and served in 1941 as aide to Gene:elite-in-10 Chiang Kai-shek. In the 
same year he became Director of the Political Board of the National Military Council and 
Secretary-General of the San Min Chu I Youth Corps. Chang was engaged in negotiations 
with the Communists from 1944 to 1946, the latter_ year as the Kuomintang member of 
General Marshall's three-men military committee. In late 1945 he was sent to Sinkiang 
Province to negotiate with native elements that had revolted in 1944, established an 
autonomous regime in the northwest section of the province, and were asking for complete 
independence. These negotiations, conducted with Soviet representatives as mediators 
in tTrumchi (Tihwa), culminated in an agreement (June 1946) giving the Ili group con-
siderable representation in the provincial government. Prior to the 6 June agreement, 
Chang had been appointed Director of the Generalissimo's Northwest Headquarters, a 
post he held until May 1949. He served from May 1946 until April 1947 as Chairman of 
the Sinkiang Provincial Government, and the improved relations between the Nationalist 
Government and the Ili group which existed in Sinkiang from 1946 to 1948 have been 
attributed to his efforts. 
In early 1948 Chang was one of those approached by the Russian Ambassador Roschin 
th n offer of mediation in the Chinese Civil War, arid after the fall of Mukden in 
October 194S he advocated a re-opening of negotiations with tile Communists. He was 
active from that time until April 1949 in maneuvers designed to end the Civil War. He 
was appointed Minister without Portfolio in both the Nationalist Sun Fo and Ho Ying-ch'in 
cabinets, and early in 1949 negotiated with the Russians regarding economic concessions 
in Sinkiang. He was appointed head of the Nationalist delegation for peace negotiations 
with the Communists in Peking in the spring of 1949, and following the breakdown of the 
conversations, remained in Peking, working with the Communist authorities. He reportedly 
was the person responsible for the peaceful turn-over to the Communists of the Sinkiang 
provincial authorities, and took an active part at the September-October plenary sessions 
or the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. 
Though occupying several important government posts, Chang has been characterized 
by a Russian lecturer in Moscow as an example of the type of individual whose usefulnesa 
to the regime will end when the Chinese Communists have sufficiently solidified their power.

University from 1927 to 1929, and has been a professor at National Tsingliun University 
since about 1929. He has been head of the Political Science Department of the s ?uth-
western Associated University. He was a member of the third and fourth sessions of the 
People's Political Council, but declined to attend the 191:3, 1911, and 1945 sessions, report-
edly because he thought them futile and partisan. In Kumning, Chang, a leader in liberal 
circles, was outspoken in his criticism of the Chungking regime. Noted for his integrity 
and fearlessness, he was reported in 1945 as a strong supporter of "Anglo-Saxon liberal 
ideas." 
Chang was one of the professors who took refuge in the Americaa Consulate in Kun-
ming at the time of the assaination of Wen I-to. Returning to Peking after the inpaneae 
surrender, Chang continoed his criticism of the Nationalist regime and was one of the 
leaders in the campaign against American aid to China. Since the Communist occupation 
of Peking he has been active in various Party-sponsored educational and political move-

In 1922 he studied at the Farmers' Training Center in Kwangtung. At that time, the 
Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party were cooperating with each other, and 
Chairman Mao Tse-tung, in addition to planning the revolution, was responsible for the 
training of cadres for agrarian revolution in the Farmers' Training Center. In his early 
days, therefore, Chang received the tearbings of Chairman Mao. After graduating from 
the Farmers' Training Center, he returned to his native community, and began to organize 
the farmers. In 1927, when Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the cause of revolution, General 
Chang Ting-ch'ihng began to organize an armed force of farmers in western Fukien. With

Central People's Government's delegation, United Nations and concurrently representa-

Chang Wen-Tien, who during the 1930s was more commonly known as Lo Fu, is con-
sidered one of the Communist Party's foremost Marxist theorists and is one of its most 
prolific authors. Ile was born in 1896 in Nan-hui, Kiangsu (a suburb of Shanghai), of a 
wealthy farmer family. He studied at the Wu-sung Middle School for three yearn, and 
then attended the Yellow River Conservancy School in Nanking. In 1919 he left sehool to 
participate in the May Fourth Movement and, going to Shanghai, became associated with 
the Chung Hurt Book Company and the Commercial Press. While an editor of the Com-
mercial Press, Chang became acquainted with Shen Yen-ping (Mao Tun) and his brother 
Shen Tae-min. According to his story, it was through Shen Tse-min (who later served as 
Chief of the Department of Propaganda of the Communist Party during Chsen Shao-yirs 
period of leadership) that Chang met Mao Tse-tung. Chang spent six months in Japan in 
1920 and later that same year came to San Francisco, where for a year-and-a-half he worked 
on a Chinese-language newspaper and attended the University of California. 
Returning to China in 1922, he taught in several schools in Szechwan and in 1925 
joined the Communist Party in Shanghai. Chang was in Moscow from 1926 to 1930, 
studying first at Chungshan University and later teaching at the Institute of Red Professors 
and Lenin University. While there, he became closely associated with h'en Shao-yii and 
Wang Chia-hsiang. The three men are said to have been proteges of Pavel Aleksandrovich 
Mif, vice-president of the university. They returned to China in 1930 with Mif, following 
the latter's appointment as Comintern Representative to the Far East. This greup was 
among those opposing the then Chinese Communist Party leadership under Li Li-san. In 
January 1931, when the Li leadership was, overthrown, Chang was elected a member of the 
Politburo and the Central Committee. For the next two years he served in the Shanghai 
Party headquarters, for a time as Chief of the Department of Organization, but in 1933, 
fled to the Iiiangsi Soviet where he became People's Commissar of Fropaganda. He made 
the Long March, and in January 1925 was elected Secretary of the Party Central Committee 
and concurrently a member of the Party Secretariat. He continued in these posts following 
establishment of Communist Headquarters in Yenan (Fu-shih). While Chang, with his 
associates ('h'en Shao-vi and Wang Chia-haiang. was among the most prominent Chinese 
Communist leaders in the 1930's, the three appeared to he in eclipse from 1942 to 1945.

Though the connection cannot now be established, this occurred either at the time of or 
following the so-called "ideological remoulding movement." Possibly Chang retained his 
party positions, but during these years his activities were not recorded in available sources. 
In April 1945 he was reelccted to the Party Central Committee and the Polit'ouro; in 
November of that same :year he went to Manchuria, where he served as Political Com-
miasioner of the lio-chiang Military District and secretari? of the llo-chning Provincial 
Committee of the Communist Party. 
Presumably Chang remained in Manchuria until early 1950. Ile was closely asso-
ciated with the Northeast People's Government and its predecessor, the Northeaet 
Aduiieia-
trative Council. On 20 January 1950 he was appointed head of the Central eople's 
Government delegation to the United Nations and representative on the Security Council 
pending future accreditation. This appointment marked the return of the last of this group 
of three Comintern-trained men to positions of prominence. In October 1.949, Ch'en 
Shao-yii became Chairman of the Law Commission, and Wang Chia-hsiang was appointed 
the Central People's Government's Ambassador to the USSR.

When the Northern Campaign reached the Yangtze River, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed

established at Jul-chin and he went to work there. 
After the outbreak of the anti-Japanese war, the Red fighters remaining south of the

Further illustrative of his prominence in the labor movement is Li's membership in the 
Pan-Pacific Trade Union Secretariat and his leadership of the trade union organizations in 
Hankow and Shanghai. 
The split between Kuomintang and Communists in 1927 brought a new Chinese Com-
munist leadership to power, one working closely with the Far Eastern Comintern agents 
Neumann and Lominadze. Though the Party was nominally under the direction of Ch'u 
Chlusoai, the Secretary-General, Li Li-saa was its strong man and policy architect. In 
December 1927 Li and Neumann planned the Canton insurrection, the earliest of the large 
scale insurrections planned to take over the industrial cities. Its forces were recruited from 
industrial workers backed by revolutionary peasant troops. The failure of this Comintern 
Policy culminated in the failure at Chaneeha, when Communist forces, acting upon the 
line promoted by Li and Others, took the city on 27 July 1930, only to surrender it on 
5 August. The insurrectionary policy of the Chinese Communists had already been repudi-
ated by the Comintern in meetings on 23 July 1930, though this criticism seems not to have 
been wholly acted upon at the Meeting of the Chinese Communist Party's Fourth Plenum 
in September 1930, when attacks upon Li's line were apparently soft-pedalled. Criticism 
came to its height, however, at the Meeting of the Party Central Political Bureau on 
25 November, at which time Li resigned from the Politburo. Shortly thereafter the Chinese 
Communist Politburo sent him to Moscow. lie left by boat, landing in Vladivostok. In 
Moscow in the spring of 1931 his ease came before the Oriental Department of the Comin-
tern, which heard the full confession of his mistakes. Manuilsky, one of those present, made 
strong criticism of Li, "who in his confessions gave up his ideas" too easily. He stated that 
merely confessing his mistakes was not enough; what was needed was careful study, for 
which he should "stay for a few months to work with the Comintern" and learn how to 
correct his errors. The period of study was to last fourteen years. 
NVhile in Russia, Li married a Rusa;eri He was elected in al:smile a member of the 
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at the Seventh National Party Con-
gress in April 1945. He accompanied Soviet troops into Manchuria the same year. Until 
February 1949, Li served in Manchuria as Political and Foreign Affairs Advisor to General 
Lin Piao. lie returned to prominence in the labor field when he was elected 1st Vice-
Chairman of the All-China Federation of Labor at the Sixth All-China Labor Congress, 
held in Harbin in 1948. lie continues to hold this position, in addition to that of Minister 
of Labor in the Central People's Government. Despite numerous reports, both past and 
present, of a rift between Li and Mao Tse-tung, there is no available evidence of curren. 
disagreement.

Formerly named Lung-ehih. Native of Hunan. About fifty-three years of age. Li 
Li-san left Hunan in 1919 and went to France as a "worker-student." In France, like the 
other worker-students, he had to study French and make up other studies in addition 
to his assigned work. 
It ecems that he began to study Communism when he was very young. He did so, 
however, on a purely theoretical level, since Chinese students in France at that time did 
not have the advantage of working with a Communist Party organization. 
A group of the worker-students in France in 1921 demonstrated against the French 
loan arranged by Nlinister Ch'te Lu, and demanded that the Franco-China University, 
founded by Li Shih-tmg and Wu be opened to the public, Secretary Wang of the 
Ministry Was beaten and woundei: the students and one-hundred-and-four students were
