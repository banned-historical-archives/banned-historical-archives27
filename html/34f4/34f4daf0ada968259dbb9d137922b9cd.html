 The USSR has stood firm in conference sessions on
 its position on Berlin and a German peace treaty.              Soviet
 delegates have expressed optimism that progress will be
 made in private negotiations.            A member of the Soviet
 delegation has suggested that the ministers in the next
 two weeks could work out arrangements on a cessation of
 nuclear tests, Berlin, and an all-German committee for
 final approval at a summit meeting.  Before departing for
 his state visit to Albania  Khrushchev expressed the hope

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 NEW SOVIET TRADE GAINS IN WESTERN EUROPE .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 1
 The USSR has scored two important economic gains in
 Western Europe.   It has secured its first formal trade
 agreement with Britain.  At the same time, the issue of
 credits in trade with the Soviet Union has been given new
 impetus, not only by London's reaffirmation that these
 are available to the USSR, but by new Soviet successes
 in obtaining them from Germany and probably the Nether-
 FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE "CULT OF KRRUSHCHEV. .  .  .  .  .  Page 2
 Public praise for Khrushchev has 'become increasingly
 lavish in recent weeks.  His stature as a theoretician,
 expert in many fields, and World War II military figure
 is being enhanced, with the result that an idealized image
 of him as charismatic leader of the Soviet people is being
 created.  This build-up, apparently having achieved a
 momentum of its own, probably cannot be stopped, short of
 clear and explicit instructions from Khrushchev himself.
 THIRD USSR WRITERS' CONGRESS ENDS   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page 3
 The Third USSR Writers' Congress, which closed in
 Moscow on 23 May, made clear the regime's renewed demand
 that Soviet writers confine themselves to arousing popular
 enthusiasm for Soviet achievements and inspiring hope for
 the Communist future.   In his speech to the congress,
 Khrushchev bluntly warned that Soviet writers may not
 arrogate to themselves the party's exclusive right to
 identify those aspects of Soviet society that need reform.
 In effect, criticism and the impetus to reform must come
 from above, not below.  The replacement; of A. Surkov by

 The 11th plenary session of the bloc Council for

 13 to 16 May, proposed the linking of electric power sys-

 The East German regime may be preparing a drive
 against the estimated 40,000 persons who live in East
 Berlin and work in the Western sector of the city.  The
 East German Government has charged that many of these
 "border crossers" are engaged in illegal currency manipu-
 lations and in smuggling of goods in both directions.  An
 all-out campaign at this. time would not be in the Commu-
 nists' interests, however, since it would tend to increase
 tensions and emphasize a determination to abrogate tha
 four-power status of the city by unilateral action

 of the total--was suitable only for remelting or local
 handicraft purposes.   If the large new plants now on the
 books are finished on schedule, China 'by 1967 will be
 able to produce some 45,000,000 tons of steel annually
 and will probably have risen from seventh to third place
 among the world's steelmakers.

 The Chinese Communists have recently stepped up their
 contacts with foreign Communist parties and reportedly are
 seeking Moscow's acknowledgment'.: of.' their "special role"
 in guiding Asian parties.            Peiping's increased contacts
 have been open and embellished with formal communiques, in
 contrast to a current tendency by Moscow to minimize or
 camouflage its influence over foreign parties.
 CEYLONESE PRIME MINISTER'S POLITICAL POSITION   .

 The withdrawal of two extreme leftist cabinet minis-
 ters and ten parliamentary representatives from Ceylon's
 ruling coalition has confronted Prime Minister Bandaranaike
 with the immediate tasks of reorganizing his government
 and regaining a safe majority before Parliament reconvenes
 about 30 June.  While he probably will be able to do this
 by winning the support of independent and Tamil represent-
 atives.,, his longer range problem of controlling a newly
 constituted coalition until the 1961 elections is likely
 to prove increasingly difficult.

 The Debrd government has bowed to French National
 Assembly pressure for a debate on Algeria, but it has
 postponed discussion until 4 June, three. days .after President
 de Gaulld's scheduled public summation of his year in
 power.  While Paris officials appear to have accepted the
 thesis of French Army commanders that a military victory
 in Algeria is in sight, there are continued rumors of an
 impending cease-fire.  The senatorial elections in Algeria
 on 31 May will complete the selection of local representa-
 tives with whom De Gaulle had indicated he could discuss
 the area's future status.
 FRENCH-TUNISIAN NEGOTIATIONS ON BIZERTE   .  .
 .  .  .  Page 13
 Tunisia appears ready to discuss with France a pro-
 visional agreement which would regularize the status of
 the French base at Bizerte.   Negotiations will be diffi-
 cult, however, and could be disrupted at any time by a
 new incident involving restive French Army forces sta-
 tioned at Bizerte or those operating along the Algerian-
 Tunisian border.   If this happened, Tunisian President
 Bourguiba would probably renew his demand for the com-
 plete evacuation of the base and appeal to the US and
 the UN for support.

 ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT UNDER HEAVY PRESSURES .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 16
 The Argentine Government will be under heavy pressures
 for the next few months.  A drop in reel wages is antici-
 pated, there is increased military discontent over labor
 agitation, and the Peronistas and Communists threaten to
 continue costly strikes and violence.   Through his ban on
 all Communist activities and his cabinet reorganization
 in mid-May, President Frondizi hopes to reduce these
 pressures and improve administration of the US-backed sta-
 bilization program.
 THE SITUATION IN PORTUGAL  .
 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 17
 Portuguese political tensions, which were marked by
 a plot against the Salazar regime in early March, have
 relaxed somewhat recently.  The government had made some
 personnel shifts and other moves to allay public criticism,
 and Premier Salazar is reported to be sounding out close
 associates on the naming of his eventual successor.  Fail-
 ure to resolve this problem fairly soon might revive fac-
 tionalism among the armed forces and encourage a bid for
 power by leading military contenders.

 principal part of his reform program, which he originally
 began in order to buy time for his regime, has not yet
 been put into effect, and the large number of unfulfilled
 promises made by the government have caused many people to
 become implacably hostile to the regime.   Soviet propaganda
 against the Shah is effective among the lower income groups
 and among the lower ranks of the armed forces.
 UN EXPERIENCE WITH OBSERVER AND PATROL FUNCTIONS .  .  .  .  .  Page  7   25X6
 Many United Nations members look on the idea of
 injecting the UN into the Berlin situation as a kind of
 fallback position for avoiding an East-West clash.  The
 UN has in the past ten years had extensive experience
 with observer and police duties--particularly in the
 Middle East--in disputes not directly involving one of
 the great powers.  The success of these efforts has de-
 rived from the UN's ability to expose infractions and
 prevent small clashes from spreading.  On the Berlin
 issue, Secretary General Hammarskjold believes the organ-
 ization should confine itself to helping implement an
 agreement the West may reach with the USSR.
 THE SOVIET CHEMICAL INDUSTRY .  .  ,  .  . .  ,  ,         .  ,  .  .  Page 10
 The urgency which the Soviet Union attaches to the
 rapid expansion of the chemical industry has again been
 demonstrated by the announcement that the status of the
 industry will be discussed at next month's plenum of the
 central committee.  Many problems, some already in evi-
 dence, must be overcome if the industry's goals for the
 next seven years--outlined a year ago in May at a central
 committee meeting--are to be achieved.  The investment
 plan for the chemical industry in 1958, for instance, fell
 short of fulfillment by a considerable margin.  The USSR

 MINORITY-LANGUAGE TRAINING IN THE USSR .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page 14
 The Soviet educational reorganization launched last
 fall is causing difficulties in important minority areas
 of the country.  The increased vocational training now
 required must be absorbed in a curriculum already over-
 taxed by the policy of teaching both Russian and the minor-
 ity language.  The education laws enacted by most of the
 individual republics under the reorganization are forcing
 the students to choose between the cultural heritaSe of
 their native tongue and the educational and career advan-
 tages of knowing Russian.  The public outcry against these
 changes is apparently as much a result of wounded national
 pride as opposition to the school reorganization itself.

 28 May 1959
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 Soviet moves at Geneva last
 week were aimed at placing the
 USSR in the strongest possible
 position as the foreign minis-
 ters conference enters the pri-
 vate negotiations stage.   In
 his statements at the sessions,
 Foreign Minister Gromyko gave
 no indication of any important
 changes in the Soviet position
 on Berlin and a German  peace
 treaty.   He continued to insist
 that a peace treaty is the prin-
 cipal problem before the con-
 ference.   At the same,time, how-
 ever, Soviet spokesmen hinted
 at Groymko's readiness to engage
 in serious private talks and
 singled out three issues--a nu-
 clear test?:cessation, Berlin,
 and an all-German committee--
 as offering the best prospects
 for agreement.
 Private Talks
 Khrushchev's line was
 elaborated by the counselor of
 the Soviet Embassy in Paris who
 told an American official in
 Geneva on 21 May that the min-
 isters during the next two weeks
 should be able to work out ar-
 rangements on a cessation of
 tests, on Berlin, and on an
 East-West German committee for
 firial approval at a summit meet-
 ing.  He said Gromyko had told
 him that, although the USSR
 would not take the. initiative,
 it would favor secret talks and
 suggested.that Britain or France
 might make such a proposal.
 Gromyko's caution and re-
 luctance probably reflected his
 belief that the side that as-
 sumes the initiative in propos-
 ing secret sessions will be
 placed at, an immediate disad-
 vantage by having to make the
 first suggestions for working
 out limited or interim solu-
 tions, especially on Berlin.
 The Soviet delegation's press
 spokesman claimed that British
 Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd
 had taken the initiative on 26
 May in arranging an agreement
 with Groymko to hold a secret,
 restricted session on 29 May.
 Hints from East German
 spokesmen may provide the first
 clue as to the line Gromyko will
 take in secret talks.   Accord-
 irig to press reports, the East
 Germans have passed word through
 their newsmen at Geneva that
 they would be willing to accept
 the status of Soviet agents in
 a new Berlin arrangement on con-
 dition that the West accept
 the principle of a free city
 status for West Berlin.   The
 East Germans, however, said
 they would not accept any formal
 written agreement on agent stat-
 us and suggested instead an in-
 formal "understanding" among
 the powers concerned.   The East
 Germans endorsed some role for
 the United Nations in Berlin,
 but insisted that such a settle-
 ment must include elimination
 of Western propaganda   and

 intelligence activities based
 in West Berlin.
 Nuclear Test Issue
 Moscow's effort to create
 an impression of progress on
 the nuclear test questions was
 reflected in Khrushchev's re-
 marks to visiting Western
 scientists on 20 May that he
 sees no obstacles to an early
 agreement.  He said that "we
 shall be very glad if by the
 end of the year, it would be
 possible to achieve agreement
 in Geneva" on this question.
 While Soviet representa-
 tives stressed favorable aspects
 for agreement in private talks
 at Geneva, the USSR made further
 moves to bring pressure on the
 Western position.   In his speech
 in Tirana on 26 May,Khrushchev
 reaffirmed the USSR's intention
 to sign a separate treaty with
 East Germany if the West refuses
 to conclude a treaty with both
 German states.   He predicted
 that the West German leaders,
 after a while, would realize
 the need for a treaty and "they
 too will sign it."
 On 23 May,Moscow delivered
 its second protest notes to Wash-
 ington and Bonn about equipping
 West German forces with nuclear
 weapons.  This was primarily de-
 signed to maintain pressure on
 the Western position by reiterat-
 ing previous charges that such
 "unilateral" Western actions
 threaten the prospect for suc-
 cess in East-West negotiations.
 KhrushcheV's visit to Al-
 bania.has served as the occasion
 for reiterating Soviet warnings
 against stationing missiles in
 Italy and Greece and proposals
 for a nuclear- and missile-free
 zone in the Balkans. His threat
 to station missiles in Albania,
 Bulgaria, or other satellites
 was carefully stated as an ac-
 tion which "perhaps" might be
 necessary if plans for Western
 missile bases are carried out.
 He implied that in any event
 the USSR could retaliate with
 long-range missiles.
 Ulbribht's proposal for a
 nonaggression treaty between
 East and West Germany, made at
 the fifth plenum of the East
 German party central committee
 on 22-23 May,   is  apparently
 intended as a   "constructive"
 initiative designed to increase
 East Germany's status at Geneva

 and put Bonn under pressure to
 negotiate directly with the Com-
 munist regime.                        East German For-
 eign Minister Bolz has brought
 up-  this proposal at Geneva, and
 the regime's propaganda media
 are already charging Bonn with
 "ill will" for failing to re-
 spond.
 West Germany
 In public statements review-
 ing the developments at Geneva,
 West German officials have adop-
 ted a stiffer attitude toward
 the West's making any substan-
 tial concessions for the purpose
 of justifying a summit conference.
 Foreign Minister Brentano oil 22
 May told press representatives
 that a "precondition" for a sum-
 mit meeting would be a Soviet
 confirmation of the present
 legal status of Berlin.  On 25
 May, Bonn's press chief, Von
 Eckardt, took a similar position,
 Both Brentano and Von Eckardt
 stressed the possibilities of
 a failure in negotiations as a
 result of "further inflexible
 Soviet rejection" of discussion
 on German reunification.
 Iraq
 In an apparent effort to
 counter Gromyko's repeated at-
 tacks on German militarism,
 Brentano indicated that Bonn
 might offer to conclude bilateral
 nonaggression pacts with Poland
 and Czechoslovakia.   He said
 that this offer would depend on
 the "right moment" during the
 negotiations, and on Soviet ac-
 ceptance of the basic features
 of the Western peace plan.   The
 question of establishing formal
 diplomatic relations was left
 open?
 West Berlin's Mayor Brandt
 recently stressed to American
 officials that the real problem
 facing the foreign ministers'
 meeting or a summit conference
 is the negotiation of a "viable
 access agreement."  Brandt feels
 that, such an agreement must cov-
 er Allied and West German ac-
 cess,   and  that  the  latter
 could be  negotiated   be-
 tween the two German   delega-
 tions under four-power auspices.
 the Communist press in Baghdad
 stated last week that the party
 "never" considered the question
 of legalization as "one of the
 more overriding and urgent is-
 sues."  It also emphasized that
 it would not make participation
 in the government a condition
 for supporting Qasim.   However,
 party leaders, have clearly in-
 dicated they have no intention
 of following the NDP's example.
 The principal Communist organ
 criticized that party's stand,
 and it Communist-inspired NDP
 splinter group has announced
 that it would not follow the
 official party directive,
 Prime Minister Qasim's con-
 test with the Communists over
 the legalization of party ac-
 tivity and party participation
 in the cabinet has not been re-
 solved, although the Communists
 have made a partial tactical re-
 treat and may well have suffered
 some loss of prestige.
 In response to Qasim's
 speeches rebuking those who
 called for a revival of politi-
 cal activity along party lines
 and to the announcement by the
 National Democratic party (NDP)
 of a "freeze" on its activities,

 Qasim replied in a press
 statement on 23 May, pointing
 out that "unintentional" party
 activity would "unintentionallyt"
 endanger the safety of the re-
 public.   This threat, though
 heavily veiled, is a stronger
 one than any he had previously
 aimed at the Communists and
 associated elements.   This sec-
 tion of his statement                  was not
 published in the Communist party
 paper, but Radio Baghdad  re-
 peated it.
 The Communists have com-
 plained about another commentary
 by Radio Baghdad which appears
 to have named the Communists as
 the offenders against the spirit
 of'Qasim's statements.  The Com-
 munists have reminded the public
 and Qasim of the services they
 have rendered the revolutionary
 government and of the danger {.,
 that the "imperialists" are
 seeking to undermine Qasim's
 support by their attacks on Com-
 munist activity.
 In the international field,
 the Qasim regime has made some
 further cautious gestures  in
 what seems to be the direction
 of more friendly relations with
 the West and a more genuinely
 neutral policy.  Another Qasim
 press statement last week, which
 contained some mildly favorable
 references to the Western powers,
 was broadcast verbatim by the
 government radio, a rare tI'eat-
 ment for interviews of this
 character.
 So far, however, these
 developments have spelled only
 a mild moderation in the polit-
 ical climate in Baghdad. Qasim
 still has  no organization of
 his own to produce mass support
 for him, and it seems unlikely
 that he will undertake any aggres-
 sive or dramatic moves against
 the Communists unless they com-
 mit gross tactical errors.  He
 still seems to be seeking their
 continued support, albeit on
 his own terms and in ways which
 tend to  put limits..~pn  their
 hitherto predominant influence.
 But the Communists are still
 the strongest single civilian
 political group in the country,
 and they remain well entrenched
 in the bureaucracy, labor unions,
 front organizations, and propa-
 ganda machinery.
 In his most recent inter-
 view with Ambassador Jernegan,
 who assured him of Western sup-
 port in maintaining Iraq's in-
 dependence, Qasim remained as
 noncommittal as ever with regard
 to any positive steps he might
 take to move away from either
 the local Communists  or  the
 support of the Soviet bloc.

 Lao Hak Zat (NLHZ) party.          The
 foreign minister on 25 May re-
 quested American financial and
 material support for an opera-
 tion to break the resistance of
 the Pathet unit.
 In view of the army's inept
 performance to date, there is
 the danger that an attack against
 the Pathet unit might serve only
 to disperse it.   In addition,
 drastic action against the NLHZ
 could precipitate its return to
 full-scale dissidence creating
 an internal security problem
 with which General Ouan says the
 Laotian Army would be unable to
 cope without an increase of
 6,000 troops.
 The British Foreign Office
 has expressed strong fears that
 drastic action against the NLHZ
 will undermine its ability to
 oppose the Communist bloc cam-
 paign to reconvene the Interna-
 tional Control Commission (ICC)
 for Laos.   It apparently believes
 that repression of the NLHZ
 would be construed by interna-
 SECRET
 tional opinion as violating the
 Geneva a.greement's prohibition
 of reprisals against former
 Pathet Lao members.
 The Communist powers have
 reacted by terming the situation
 dangerous for peace in Southeast
 Asia and by continuing to demand
 the immediate recall of the
 ICC to Laos.   North Vietnam's
 attacks on the Laotian Govern-
 ment's actions  have been harsh-
 er than either Peiping's or
 Moscow's, although no ultimatum
 has been issued to Vientiane.
 The Communists realize that any
 overt military action would
 undercut their goal of placing
 blame for any violation of the
 Geneva agreements on Laos.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 NEW SOVIET TRADE GAINS IN 'WESTERN EUROPE
 The USSR has scored two
 important economic successes in
 Western Europe.   After years
 of trading without an official
 agreement, Britain and the USSR
 last week concluded a formal
 five-year trade pact. Moreover,
 the British, during the nego-
 tiations with Moscow, reaffirmed
 that government-guaranteed
 medium-term credits--i.e ? ex-
 tending up to five years--are
 available to finance trade with
 the USSR, thus opening a new
 area of competition among West
 European exporters seeking a
 share of Moscow's much-publi-
 ciZd program to buy "billions"
 of dollars worth of Western
 industrial goods.
 The communique issued at
 the end of the British trade
 talks in Moscow calls for a
 ""substantial" increase in trade.
 "Traditional" British purchases
 of Soviet grain, timber  and
 wood products, nonferrous metals,
 and flax, as well as new pur-
 chases of Soviet autos and con-
 sumer goods, are to be increased
 by about $50,000,000 in the
 first year, according to the
 British,   The "traditional" pur-
 chases, particularly of timber
 and wood products, accounted for
 half of Britain's $165,000,000
 worth of imports from the USSR
 in 1958.   London presumably
 will only cautiously step up
 purchases of grain and nonfer-
 rous metals--commodities now
 largely supplied by Common-
 wealth countries.
 For its part Moscow "will
 place substantial orders" for
 equipment for the chemical and
 paper industries,  sugar refin-
 eries, and food-processing
 plants; equipment to produce
 synthetic tires; and additional
 consumer items.   Less than half
 the $145,000,000 in Soviet im-
 ports from the UK last year
 were British-produced commodities,
 the remainder being composed
 of Commonwealth raw materials
 and foodstuffs which the USSR
 is increasingly seeking to buy
 directly from the producing
 countries.
 In order to maintain and
 increase imports from the UK,
 Moscow will have to increase
 considerably the purchase of man-
 ufactured equipment. The extent
 of :British willingness to pro-
 vide government-guaranteed cred-
 its to exporters probably will
 largely govern any increase in
 orders for equipment now being
 bought under the proposed Soviet
 seven-year $15-20 billion chemi-
 cal-industry expansion.
 The British mission leader
 stated the objective of the pact
 and the auxiliary credit condi-
 tions is to get a "good share"
 of ;planned increases in Soviet
 trade, Soviet spokesmen point
 out that agreements reached with
 the British set an example "for
 those powers with whom-we have
 rather weak trade relations. We
 hope they will think it over
 and do something on these lines."
 The publicity accorded to
 credit features of the British
 program herald a new era in West
 European competition to seek a
 share in the proposed expansion
 of Soviet trade.   Almost simul-
 taneously with the issuance of
 the Soviet-British communique
 West Germany revealed that a
 government-owned shipyard had
 arranged credit for the delivery
 of $10,000,000 worth of ships
 to the USSR.   The time from the
 beginning of construction to
 final payment will exceed the
 usual five-year maximum for
 medium-term credits.   Negotia-
 tions are-..under way for financing

 FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE "CULT OF
 Public praise for Khru-
 shchev has become increasingly
 lavish in recent weeks.    His
 stature as a theoretician, ex-
 pert in many fields, and World
 War II military figure is 'steadi-
 ly being enhanced, and the crea-
 tion of an idealized image of
 him as charismatic leader of the
 Soviet people has been carried
 a few steps further.   This build-
 up, apparently having achieved
 a momentum of its own, probably
 cannot be stopped, short of
 clear and explicit instructions
 from Khrushchev.   The trend to-
 ward more fulsome and ingratiat-
 ing  praise will probably con
 tinue as Soviet officials in all
 fields vie for Khrushchev's
 favor or simply seek to protect
 themselves from a suspicion of
 disloyalty.
 Ukrainian and Moldavian
 leaders took advantage of Khru-
 shchev's presence in their re-
 publics recently to laud him
 with eulogies reminiscent of
 those given Stalin, and the So-
 viet secret police,  in a widely
 publicized letter to the party
 central committee, made certain
 that no suspicion of disloyalty
 should be aroused by any hesi-
 tancy on their part in adding
 to the new "cult of Khrushchev.-"
 The presentation of a Lenin
 Peace Prize to Khrushchev on 16
 May--an honor never before given
 a Soviet leader--was the occasion
 for further adulation, in which
 foreigners as well as Soviet
 There is as yet no clear
 evidence that Khrushchev has
 been particularly swayed by
 this flattery,, but neither has
 he given indication of any de-
 sire to limit it.   On the con-
 trarcy, he gave the development
 of an idealized leaderLimage a
 boost  in  his speech  on  22
 May to the Third  Writers' Con-
 gress by striking the pose of
 an intensely human, warm, and
 compassionate "father confessor."
 Referring to the futile attempts
 since Stalin's death of a num-
 ber of writers to throw off the
 bonds of party domination, he
 said:   "The struggle has ended
 and the 'angel of reconciliation,'
 as the phrase goes, is in the
 air....  If'the adversary sur-
 rendlers;..,and expresses his
 readiness to take up the correct
 position, do not thrust him a-
 side, but rather, stretch out
 your hand to him."
 The image thus created dif-
 fers! markedly from the picture
 of Stalin--the cold and austere
 eminence in the Kremlin--and may
 go a long way toward preventing
 the excesses attributed to the
 cult of Stalin.

 THIRD USSR WRITERS' CONGRESS ENDS
 he six-day proceedings
 of the Third USSR Writers'
 Congress, which closed in
 Moscow on 23 May, made clear
 the regime's renewed demand
 that Soviet writers confine
 themselves to arousing pop-
 ular enthusiasm for Soviet
 achievements and inspiring
 hopes for the Communist future.
 In his speech to the
 congress on 22 May, Khrushchev
 declared himself completely
 on the side of the "so-called
 embellishers"--those writers
 who in the eyes of their
 opponents concentrated on
 Soviet achievements and glossed
 over faults and failings.   He
 urged that there be no recrim-
 inations against writers who
 are trying to overcome their
 "serious mistakes," but that
 the mistakes themselves must
 not be forgotten.   He warned
 bluntly that Soviet writers
 may not arrogate to themselves
 the party's exclusive right
 to identify those aspects of
 Soviet society in need of
 reform.   "If anyone reveals
 and lays bare failings and
 faults it will be done by the
 party, by  its central commit-
 tee."  In effect criticism and
 the impetus to reform must come
 from above, not from below.
 TASS announced on 25 May
 that Konstantin Fedin had been
 elected first secretary of the
 USSR Writers' Union, replacing
 Alexey Surkov, who was elected
 one of the 26 secretaries of
 the union.   Fedin in the past
 has followed the regime's cul-
 tural policy line as faithfully
 as Surkov.   He was one of the
 editors who rejected Pasternak's
 Dr. Zhivago in 1956, and he
 reportedly attempted to persuade
 Pasternak to refuse the Nobel
 Prize when it was first announced
 last October.   Fedin is, however,
 more tactful than Surkov and on
 occasion has been criticized by
 regime supporters for "glossing
 over the mistakes" of other
 writers.  He will probably be
 better suited personally than
 Surkov to accept back into the
 fold those writers whose mis-
 takes the regime is ready to
 MORE BLOC ECONOMIC COOPERATION THROUGH CEMA
 The communique of the 11th
 plenary session of the bloc Coun-
 cil for Mutual Economic Assist-
 ance   (CEMA) 'held in Tirana
 from 13 to 16 May suggests that
 effective coordination of new
 industrial activity, such as ad-
 vanced chemical production, will
 be guided by bloc as well as
 national considerations.   At
 a meeting in Moscow of top bloc
 political leaders in May 1958,
 Khrushchev called for more eco-
 nomic cooperation among the
 satellites as a step toward the
 ultimate economic integration
 of the Soviet bloc.   Since then
 CEMA, after nine years of dor-
 mancy, has been markedly more
 active.
 At the ninth plenary ses-
 sion last June, CEMA organs were
 strengthened to encourage  great-
 er compliance with CEMA recom-
 mendations.   Moscow, revealing
 sensitivity to possible charges
 that it dominates an economic
 bloc, has explicitly denied that
 CEMA plays a supranational role,
 and CEMA has taken great pains
 to stress the independence and
 quality of its members.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 May 1959
 The tenth plenum, in Decem-
 ber 1958, set forth.the work
 program for 1959, concerned it-
 self with "practical" measures
 for furthering specialization,
 and approved construction of a
 pipeline system for.:delivery
 by 1965 of increased amounts of
 Soviet crude oil to East Euro-
 pean refineries.   At the most
 recent plenary session, members
 agreed to establish long-pro-
 posed facilities to connect
 their high-voltage electric-
 power transmission systems,
 permitting more intensive use
 of power capacities by exploit-
 ing time differences and varia-
 tions in power-consumption pat-
 terns.   The integrated system
 will permit areas not endowed
 with adequate low-grade fuel
 reserves to use power generated
 by proposed superplants in East
 Germany and Poland.   The sys-
 tem also will be an important
 aid to intensive  power  users
 such  as  the  chemical  in-
 dustry.
 EAST GERMANY MAY MOVE AGAINST
 The East German regime may
 be preparing a drive against
 persons who live in East Berlin
 and work in the Western sector,
 according to unconfirmed re-
 ports from Berlin.
 Such a drive against these
 "border crossers "would have
 one or more of the following
 purposes:   a)   to isolate West
 Berlin from East Berlin and
 East Germany;    b)>  to renew
 pressures on the West Berlin
 government to negotiate on this
 issue;   c)   to force skilled
 workers living in East Berlin
 to take jobs in East Berlin or
 East Germany in order to relieve
 The coordination of ambi-
 tiolus satellite economic plans
 through 1965 at the recent
 Tirana meeting was designed
 primarily to effect a more care-
 ful intrasatellite balancing
 of basic industrial resources
 and requirements. The conference
 also set the "general lines of
 specialization" for the growing
 production of equipment for
 chemical industries and additions
 to capacity in the steel indus-
 try?
 Bloc activity during the
 past year gives little evidence
 of any willingness by CEMA mem-
 bers to reduce or abandon present
 production in the interest of
 specialization. CEMA's role, how-
 ever, is being stressed with re-
 gard to new industrial construc-
 tiorn and technology. This may
 yield sizable gains in efficiency
 and productivity, minimize drains
 on Soviet resources, and enhance
 the USSR.

 rency at other than official
 rates.
 The Communists are not
 likely to undertake an all-out
 campaign at this time, however,
 since it would tend to increase
 tensions and emphasize a deter-
 mination to abrogate the four-
 power status of the city by
 unilateral action. Under Berlin's
 present status, all residents
 have a right to move freely to
 any part of the city.

 An estimated 40,000 res-
 idents of East Berlin or East
 Germany now work.in the Western
 sector, an increase of some
 6,000 since 1957, while during
 the same period the number of
 West Berlin residents working
 in East Berlin declined from
 approximately 16,060 to about
 13,900,  The  East  German
 Governnl+ nt l d s ' kNa 'god that
 many border crossers are en-
 gaged in illegal currency
 manipulation and in smuggling
 of goods in both directions,
 Upder present  arrangements
 the East-to-West border crossers
 receive 40 percent of  their
 wages in West marks and the
 remainder in'East marks at a
 6-to-1 rate.   The West-to-East
 crossers are permitted to ex-
 change90.percent of their wages
 into West marks at the official
 1-to-l rate.   Since the present
 free-market rate of exchange
 is about 3.5 East  marks  to
 1 West mark,   the border.:
 crossers  can  realize  a tidy
 bonus.
 In addition to the advan-
 tages of the currency situation
 and the opportunity to shop in
 both parts of the city, there
 are other reasons why many
 residents of East Berlin con-
 tinue to live there.   One of
 the most important is  the
 continued housing Shortage in
 bo h parts: of the. city, despite
 thb vaStl imouht"'of building in
 West Berlin.   If a person has
 a house, even in East Berlin,
 he will try to keep it.rather
 than move to 'West Berlin through
 refugee channels and go to the
 bottom of the long list of
 people waiting for housing.
 The East German regime
 undertook brief intensive
 campaigns in 1957 and in 1958
 to reduce the number of border
 cros secs   The major result of
 such campaigns was to induce the
 border crossers to. make a perma-
 nent: move to West Berlin or West
 Germany.  A new drive at this
 time probably would have a simi-
 lar result.
 SITUATION IN TIBET
 While Chinese-Communist
 military units are moving against
 guerrilla bands, Peiping is con-
 solidating its political control
 in Tibet.  A party directive
 issued in Lhasa on 22 May indi-
 cates that pressure is`increas-
 inf for Tibetan acceptance of
 "democratic reforms."  The di-
 rective instructs Chinese mili-
 tary and government personnel
 to "pave the way" for reform by
 leading and organizing the Ti-
 betans in preparatory work.
 Peiping's failure to mention
 land distribution suggests Tibet
 will pass quickly to more ad-
 vanced stages of socialization.
 On the surface, Peiping's
 indoctrination program appears
 to be having some effect.

 PROSPECTS FOR CHINA'S STEEL INDUSTRY
 Despite the rapid produc-
 tion increases scored by China's
 steel industry last year, the
 industry is still not in a po-
 sition to meet all the demands
 placed on it.   Premier Chou En-
 lai recently acknowledged that
 an insufficient output of steel
 was hampering the growth of the
 national economy and that an in-
 crease is the most important
 task on the industrial front.
 In its loud claims to have
 doubled steel production last
 year, Peiping has significantly
 failed to mention how much was
 made into finished steel.   It
 is  estimated that  only 7,-
 500,,000                                                                tons of crude  steel
 out of the  claimed output of
 11,100,000  tons was  converted
 to finished  steel of  accept-
 able industrial grade.                                                             This
 was  produced in  plants of the
 central government and in local-
 ly controlled medium-size plants.
 Most of the rest was produced
 in small, local installations

 moved from seventh place to
 third among the world's pro-
 ducers of steel.
 As regards 1959 outppt,it
 is estimated that of the 18,-
 000,000 tons of crude steel
 scheduled for production, some
 4,000,000 tons will have to be
 remelted or fabricated locally.
 If current plans are effected,
 China will be able to produce
 approximately 25,000,000 tons
 of acceptable steel annually by
 1962, the last year of the Second
 Five-Year Plan.   Even at this
 level, however, China's steel
 production will probably cone
 tinue to lag behind needs.
 PEIPING TRYING TO INCREASE INFLUENCE IN NONBLOC COMMUNIST PARTIES
 The Chinese Communists
 have recently indicated that
 they are determined to acquire
 a greater role in guiding the
 activities of nonbloc Communist
 parties.
 This effort is open, dis-
 played in formal communiques,
 and contrasts with a recent
 tendency by Moscow to camouflage
 its influence for foreign policy
 considerations.  The Chinese
 feel no need to remain circum-
 spect, as the Peiping regime
 is not recognized by most of
 the countries with whose Commu-
 nists it is working more close-
 ly.

 are likely to prove increasingly
 difficult.
 The prime minister post-
 poned until 30 June the parlia-
 mentary session scheduled for
 26 May to avoid an immediate no-
 confidence motion and to allow
 time for reorganizing the govern-
 ment, preparing the budget, and
 outlining other important pro-
 grams for submission to Parlia-
 ment.   The interval is likely
 to produce hard political bar-
 gaining among Bandaranaike, the
 remaining government members,
 and his potential new supporters.
 Having yielded only out of
 expediency to the moderate cabi-
 net majority's demand that the
 two leftist ministers be ousted
 or their powers curtailed,
 Bandaranaike probably will try
 to stand firm against any fur-
 ther effort by the moderates
 to dominate him or to modify
 the government's socialist pro-
 gram.
 Bandaranaike's success will
 depend both upon his ability
 to control the dissension which
 probably will reappear within
 his own party as soon as new
 cabinet appointments and contro-
 versial policy matters are raised
 and upon the extent to which
 opposition elements are willing
 to support him.   The latter re-
 portedly include five independ-
 ents  and eight members of the
 Federal party, which represents
 the island's Tamil-speaking mi-
 nority.   Both may seek conces-
 sions in exchange for their sup-
 port.
 Should the independents
 and Tamils prove difficult to
 satisfy, Bandaranaike might
 risk continuing temporarily with-
 out an absolute majority rather
 than further weaken his position
 by bargaining for their support.
 In doing so, he may count on the
 probability that, while many
 opposition members would vote
 against the government, there
 would probably be enough absten-
 tions to defeat a no-confidende
 motion.  Furthermore, the seven
 leftist members of Bandaranaike's
 own Sri Lanka Freedom party who
 recently withdrew their support
 have announced their intention
 to remain outside the opposition
 and support the government's

 rule forbidding a vote in policy
 debates.   A vote on Algerian
 policy would risk splitting the
 New Republic Union (UNR), the
 mainstay,  of his coalition, and
 might undermine Paris' recent
 successes in further isolating
 the "ultras" among the European
 settlers in Algeria.   Debrd will
 probably try to maintain unity
 by a mixture of mollification
 and implied threat.
 Paris now appears to have
 accepted the thesis of French
 Army commanders in Algeria that
 a military victory is in sight
 and that surrender is the only
 way to bring peace to North
 Africa.
 ncreasing number
 of rebel overtures suggesting
 negotiations on Algeria, coupled
 with rebel requests for foreign
 help,have probably increased
 Paris' belief that a victory is
 in the offing.
 De Gaulle's emphasis on
 widespread Moslem participation
 in Algerian political life im-
 plicitly  warns  the  rebels
 that  the  future  of  Algeria
 may   be resolved  without them.
 Despite rebel attempts to frus-
 trate Moslem voting, Moslems
 now sit in the French National
 Assembly. and control most of
 the local municipal councils
 in Algeria.   After 31 May, 34
 senators from Algeria and the
 Sahara  will  sit  in    the
 French    Senate.
 FRENCH-TUNISIAN NEGOTIATIONS ON BIZERTE
 Tunisia appears ready to
 discuss with France a provisional
 agreement which would regularize
 the status of the French military
 base at Bizerte.   Negotiations
 will be difficult, however, and
 could be disrupted at any time.
 If this happened, Tunisian Presi-
 dent Bourguiba might renew his
 demand for the complete evacua-
 tion of Bizerte and appeal to
 the US and the UN for support.
 Informal talks on the
 Bizerte question began last fall
 in accordance with the 17 June
 1958 agreement under which French
 forces were withdrawn from other
 bases in Tunisia.   These talks
 never matured into serious nego-
 tiations, however, and the Tuni-
 sians, whose relations with both
 the UAR and the Algerian rebels
 were especially tense at that
 time, soon allowed them to lapse
 entirely.
 Thereafter Tunis--until very
 recently--avoided direct talks
 on the problem, expressing a
 preference for the modus vivendi
 which has endured despite a
 steady series of minor incidents
 :involving Tunisian troops and
 the 16,000 French air, naval, and
 ground forces stationed in the
 Bizerte area.   This attitude,
 however, has not stopped Tunisian
 complaints that France was ignor-
 ing Bourguiba's mid-February
 statement offering France the
 use of Bizerte if it came to
 terms with the Algerian rebels
 by 17 June.

 effects of some $20,000,000 in
 NATO funds now available to
 France for improvements at Bi-
 zerte appear to have prompted
 Tunis' approach to Paris last
 week for a resumption of in-
 formal conversations on the
 base question.
 Bourguiba's tactic ap-
 parently will be to hold out
 the prospect of an interim ar-
 rangement for continued French
 operations of Bizerte as an ex-
 clusively air-naval base in re-
 turn for the settlement, on
 terms favorable to Tunis, of
 virtually all problems now con-
 fronting the two governments.
 In this connection, Tunisian
 Foreign Secretary Mokaddem told
 Ambassador Jones on 22 May that
 the economic and financial dis-
 cussions which began in Tunis
 last week would have an impor-
 tant bearing on his government's
 attitude toward Bizerte.   For
 its part, Paris appears anxious
 to conciliate Tunisia on as many
 outstanding issues as possible
 in order to retain an effective
 air-naval installation at  Bi-
 zerte.  However, the French seem
 determined to resist Tunis' de-
 sire to be recognized as solely
 responsible for Bizerte's de-
 fense.
 Early French-Tunisian agree-
 ment on a provincial arrangement
 for Bizerte also depends to a
 large extent on the behavior of
 French Army elements based at
 Bizerte, which have been pushing

 THE CUBAN AGRARIAN REFORM LAW
 Moderates in the Cuban

 of Prime Minister Fidel Castro's
 drastic and complicated new
 agrarian reform law.   The ver-

 the law and at present under
 the executive direction of a
 pro-Communist.
 The opposition of the mod-
 erates has probably caused the
 unusual delay in official pub-
 lication of the law.   The min-
 ister of agriculture, who as
 Castro's legal adviser authored
 the original and more restrained
 agrarian laws promulgated in
 rebel territory during the civil
 war, is reliably reported to
 be so opposed to the present
 version that he will resign.
 This version, announced
 from a special cabinet meeting
 in the Sierra Maestra on 17 May
 and published two days later in
 the Castro movement's semioffi-
 cial newspaper, limits the size
 of farms, and bases compensa-
 tion to present landholders on
 artificially low tax assessments
 accepted for many years.  It
 contains several potential loop-
 holes but Castro insists it will
 be strictly enforced, and Cuban
 lawyers believe there is virtu-
 ally no recourse from interpreta-
 tions or actions of the insti-
 tute in implementing the laws
 Although Castro is the
 institute's titular head and
 calls agrarian reform the basis
 of his entire revolutionary pro-
 gram, the numerous other demands
 on his time will probably keep
 him from giving it close atten-
 tion.   Effective control will
 thus reside in the executive
 director, Antonio Nunez Jimenez,
 an intellectual with a long
 record of Communist associations
 and widespread influence in the
 Cuban revolutionary government.
 Nunez and other pro-Commu-
 nists are believed to have
 drafted the present law in such
 a way as to give them carte
 blanche to extend their influence
 in agricultural areas--as has
 already happened with pro-Commu-
 nists in some of the labor un-
 ions, parts of the revolution-
 ary army, and possibly in public
 education.   Some resistance to
 Communist influence has appeared
 in labor, but the extensive eco-
 nomic power which will accrue to
 the agrarian institute would be
 harder to challenge.
 Well-planned and -admin-
 istered land reform,which would
 alleviate the overconcentration
 of :Landownership and help diver-
 sify agricultural production, is
 probably the key to Cuba's eco-
 nomic and social development.
 However, the lack of skilled
 and disinterested technological
 personnel to implement the re-
 forms and the apparent Commu-
 nist; influence in the institute
 seem likely to pervert the pur-   25X1
 pose of the reform and cause
 serious dislocations  in
 the  country's   economy
 ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT UNDER HEAVY PRESSURES
 The Argentine Government
 will be under heavy pressures
 for the next few months.   A
 drop in real wages is anticipat-
 ed, there is increased military
 discontent over labor   agi-
 tation, and the. Peronistas and
 Communists threaten to continue
 costly strikes and violence.
 Through his ban on all Commu-
 nist activities and his cabinet
 reorganization in mid-May, Pres-
 ident Frondizi hopes to reduce
 these pressures and improve ad-
 ministration of the US-backed
 stabilization program.

 28 May 1959
 continued to organize strikes
 and other protests frequently
 resulting in riots in downtown
 Buenos Aires.   This unrest has
 caused considerable damage, in-
 juries, and economic disruption.
 Many businesses have closed in
 fear of possible sabotage or
 damage to their premises, wheth-
 er or not their employees were
 striking.
 The several general strike
 efforts this year have been most
 effective in the industrial and
 construction unions, which are
 controlled by the "hard-line"
 Peronistas and Communists.   The
 rival "32-Group" unions, a
 slightly weaker combination,
 have denounced these strikes as
 political maneuvers directed by
 Moscow and Peron.
 The Peronista and Communist
 strike demands have emphasized
 political objectives, such as
 measures that would aid Pero-
 nista efforts to regain control
 of organized labor and demands
 for revision of nonlabor poli-
 cies, such as petroleum develop-
 ment.   Wage demands. and com-
 plaints against government con-
 trol over a dozen troublemaking
 Portuguese political ten-
 sions, which were marked by a
 plot against the Salazar regime
 in early March, have relaxed
 somewhat recently, and the gov-
 ernment is making some moves to
 allay criticism.   Premier Sala-
 zar seems to have fully recov-
 ered from his attack of pneu-
 monia in January, and on 28
 April, his seventieth birthday,
 he received congratulations from
 numerous supporters.   Neverthe-
 less, failure to choose his suc-
 cessor fairly soon might revive
 factionalism among the armed
 forces and encourage a bid for
 power by leading military con-
 tenders.
 unions have been intertwined to
 attract popular support.
 The government is concerned
 that rising living costs, already
 up 50 percent since 1 January,
 may strengthen strike pressure.
 It is also apprehensive that
 prolonged strike pressure may
 enlarge the scope of Peronista
 cooperation with the Communists,
 thus further undercutting Fron-
 dizi's conciliatory efforts to
 reintegrate former Peronistas
 peacefully into the national
 scene.
 The rocky course of these
 efforts was in part reflected
 in Frondizi's mid-May cabinet
 reorganization in which several
 former Peronistas or supporters
 of the conciliatory line were
 dropped.   The new appointees
 are considered somewhat more
 conservative and likely to im-
 prove administration of the sta-
 bilization program.   They will
 also be more acceptable to the
 military, who have recently ex-
 pressed displeasure with the
 continuing agitation and "unde-
 sirable" elements in government.
 THE SITUATION IN PORTUGAL
 The regime has taken some
 steps to satisfy its critics by
 shuffling personnel in munici-
 pal;, district, and central ad-
 ministrative offices, in commit-
 tees of the National Union par-
 ty, and in the armed forces.
 It has also publicized progress
 on public works and social wel-
 fare problems.   Former presi-
 dential candidate General Hum-
 berto Delgado and two others
 who had taken asylum in Latin
 American diplomatic missions in
 Lisbon since mid-January were
 permitted to depart to the coup-
 tries involved, but the govern-
 ment was somewhat flustered by
 these incidents, and it has

 Defense Minister Dotelho
 Moniz told the American naval
 attache on 30 April that Salazar
 has recently been sounding out
 his close official associates
 on a, successor, though without
 mentioning any date for his
 retirement.  Moniz, who hopes
 the premier may envisage a
 favored position for him, thought
 Salazar might soon make a public
 statement on his plans.   Pro-
 tracted delay might encourage ex -
 Defense    Minister Colonel
 Santos Costa to try to regain his
 former position as the regime's
 "strong man."  He reportedly has
 the support of the National Front,
 a recently formed group of mili-
 tary and civilian "regime purists"
 who oppose Moniz but are also
 critical of corruption in the
 present regime.
 SICILIAN ELECTIONS
 In Sicily, where dissident
 Christian Democrats have been
 participating in a Communist-
 supported coalition government,
 the regional elections on 7 June
 are likely to result in a gain
 of several assembly seats by the
 Communists and Nenni Socialists
 at the expense of the Christian
 Democrats. Right-Wing opponents
 of former Premier I`anfani, in
 their effort to gain control of
 the national Christian Democratic
 party machinery, have encouraged
 the dissident tendency in Sicily
 and may even be willing to see
 the rise of a second and com-
 peting Catholic party.
 The present Sicilian gov-
 ernment coalition of Nenni So-
 cialists, dissident Christian
 Democrats, Monarchists, and neo-
 Fascists came to power last
 October when 18 of the 37 Chris-
 tian Democratic deputies in the
 9O-member regional assembly re-
 jected the party-sponsored candi-
 date for president of the assem-
 bly in favor of Silvio Milazzo,
 a strong advocate of Sicilian
 autonomy.   This-move was report-

 mier Scelba as part of his
 maneuvering to undermine the power
 of then Premier Fanfani.   The

 the Communists, were quick to
 see in this a way to diminish
 the Christian Democratic par-
 ty's strength in Sicily and its
 prestige in the country as a
 whole.
 Since his expulsion from
 the Christian Democratic par-
 ty,Milazzo has formed his own
 Catholic party--the Christian
 Social Union--and has publicly
 rationalized his continuing
 dependence on Communist support
 as a means of realizing Sicilian
 aims.   Efforts by the central

 have had only limited success,
 and party leaders admit they
 expect to lose six seats to the

 who now have 28 seats.

 DOMESTIC PROBLEMS FACING THE IRANIAN REGIME
 The Shah of Iran's prob-
 lems in maintaining government
 stability are becoming increas-
 ingly complicated, but he be-
 lieves he has the internal situ-
 ation under control.   He has
 recently exhibited his confidence
 by leaving Iran for a month's
 visit to Europe and by imple-
 menting only slowly the reform
 program which he began shortly
 after the Iraqi revolution in
 order to buy time for his own
 regime.   However, the Soviet
 radio propaganda campaign against
 the Shah is
 deepening ant reg me
 tendencies and helping to create
 a "spirit of rebellion," es-
 pecially among the lower income
 groups and within the armed
 forces.
 Reform Program
 The Shah seems to be making
 no attempt to enforce the princi-
 pal measure of his reform pro-
 gram, the `.'Conflict of Interest
 Law," while the public is wait-
 ing expectantly for results.
 The American Embassy believes
 that, within another, two months
 public disillusionment may be ir-
 reversible.                                                       A virtual dictator,
 the Shah would bear the full blame
 for failure of the reform pro-
 gramm.
 Further promises probably
 would not reverse the trend of
 popular dissatisfaction, which
 could result in a move to oust
 the Shah.   Furthermore, the re-
 cent law requiring officials to
 explain the sources of their
 wealth is not being implemented.
 The Imperial Inspection Bureau,
 established to accept complaints
 on any subject and to take action
 to correct inequities, also is
 failing to act against privileged
 groups.
 On the brighter side, how-
 ever, there has been a gradual
 improvement in government adminis-
 tration:.                                                       the gendarmerie has
 been reorganized, and the national
 police and Ministry of Justice
 are being improved.   The govern-
 ment discharged 10,000 unneces-
 sary employees, a move which may
 contribute to greater efficiency.
 The Shah and his cabinet,
 while continuing to talk about
 land reform, have not yet made
 any firm proposals.   The Shah
 continues to distribute crown
 lands and state-owned lands to
 peasants in the hope that land-
 lords will follow his example
 without forcing him to use coer-
 cion.   The embassy reports that,
 paradoxically, the demand for
 land reform comes primarily from
 the urban intellectual class and
 from external propaganda rather
 than from the peasants, who, al-
 though dissatisfied with some
 local conditions, prefer that
 improvements take place within
 the existing system.   The Shah

 Political Parties
 One weapon the Shah may use
 on unscrupulous. ]and]oids ? -:is the
 People's (Mardom) party,which has
 land reform as its major program.
 The People's party, which was
 formed in 1957 by Assadollah
 Alam,a close fiend of the Shah,
 has been steadily expanding and
 has a number of supporters in
 the Iranian Parliament.  The
 party is also making some head-
 way with labor groups, and its
 agitation has resulted in minor
 violence in some localities.
 Many politicians believe that
 the Shah is grooming Alam for
 the premiership.   Alam has an-
 nounced that he is donating some
 of his own lands to the govern-
 ment for distribution and has
 recently given a series of lec-
 tures on land reform.
 The other principal legal
 political party in Iran is the
 artificially created "progovern-
 ment" Nationalist (Melliyun)
 party, formed by Prime Minister
 Eqbal in early 1958, after con-
 siderable prodding by the Shah.
 It is rumored that this party
 also intends to come out in favor
 of some land reform measures--
 probably at the Shah's orders.

 UN EXPERIENCE WITH OBSERVER AND PATROL FUNCTIONS
 Many neutral United Nations
 members look on the idea of in-
 jecting the UN into the Berlin
 situation as a kind of fallback
 position for avoiding an East-
 West clash.   Secretary General
 Hammarskjold takes the stand,
 however, that the organization
 should confine itself to help-

 has in the past ten years had
 extensive experience with ob-

 various parts of the world in
 disputes not directly involving
 one of the great powers.   The
 success of these efforts derives
 fronn an ability to expose in-
 fractions and to prevent small
 clashes from spreading.

 extremely cool to such proposals
 as those to set up a UN "peace

 of the UN Headquarters to Ber-
 lin.  Hammarskjold seems to
 favor the much more limited plan
 of providing unbiased personnel,
 with the force of international
 opinion behind them, to super-
 vise the execution of  agree-
 ments.
 UN experience with such
 machinery has been extensive,
 particularly in the Middle East.
 The UN Truce Supervision Organ-
 ization (UNTSO) and its Mixed
 Armistice Commissions (MAC) have
 operated along Israel's borders
 with the Arab states since 1948.
 A similar but smaller and tem-
 porary operation is the "UN
 presence" in Jordan, an out-
 growth of the 1958 UAR-Jordanian
 impasse.   The UN Observer Group
 in Lebanon (UNOGIL) was another
 task force set up by the UN to
 supervise a local incident and
 keep it localized.  Other than
 Korea,the most extensive UN
 police operation and the only
 one'that is armed is the 5,000-
 man UN Emergency Force which
 was assigned to patrol in Sinai
 and Gaza after ':the  British-
 French-Israeli invasion troops
 were withdrawn.
 UN and Israeli Borders
 UNTSO is a body of neutral
 military observers, originally
 set up by Sweden's late Count
 Folke Bernadotte--the first UN
 mediator in Palestine--to super-
 vise the truces which preceded
 the armistice agreements.   Four
 Mixed Armistice Commissions op-
 erate under the Truce Super-
 vision Organization in policing
 the uneasy armistice between
 Israel and its Arab neighbors.
 The UN organizations have been
 beset by many difficulties,
 The four separate armistice
 agreements between Israel and
 its Arab neighbors provided for
 supervision of their execution
 by four Mixed Arrmiatica- Commis--
 sionse  These commissions, with
 a UN chairman, are composed of
 three representatives of each
 party in the case of Egypt, and
 two, representatives of each par-
 ty in the case of Jordan, Syria,
 and Lebanon.  The chief of UNTSO
 is ex officio chairman of each
 of the four commissions, but
 appoints subordinates to head
 the commissions in some cases.
 The MACs decide questions
 connected with the execution and
 interpretation of the armistice
 terms; their decisions are, to
 thel extent possible, to be taken
 unanimously, otherwise by ma-
 jority vote.   The commissions
 also deal with claims of com-
 plaints by either party, taking
 action by means of their observa-
 tion and investigation machinery.
 UNTSO military observers,
 although responsible to the UN,
 area recruited by their respec-
 tive governments, usually on a
 voluntary basis.  Observers are
 generally taken from countries
 acceptable to both parties, al-
 though a precedent was set by
 initially taking observers from
 only those countries which had
 consular commissions in Jeru-
 salem in 1948--the United States,
 FraLnce, and Belgium, plus a few
 Swedish officers assigned to
 serve directly with Count Bern-
 adotte.
 While selection of these
 military observers is left to
 the military authorities of the
 countries concerned, observers
 are expected to have high quali-
 fications, both mental  and
 physical.   In addition, the
 observer is expected to be corn-    25X6
 pletely objective in his attitudes and  'judgments, maintain-
 ing complete neutrality with
 regard to political issues.
 The presence of UN person-
 nel near the several points of
 Arab-Israeli conflict probably
 has prevented some clashes from
 expanding in scope, although in

 other instances an incident may
 have been initiated with one of
 the antagonists counting on
 this very assurance that the
 trouble would remain local.
 Arab fedayeen raids and the Is-
 raeli Sinai campaign attack
 have shown that UNTSO and the
 MACs cannot prevent the out-
 break of large-scale warfare
 whenever this is the intention
 of either side.   UNTSO and the
 MACs are intended to provide
 only machinery for mitigating
 specific disputes, not to re-
 solve the whole Arab-Israeli
 problem.   It seems safe to as-
 sume that their removal of a
 drastic reduction of their func-
 tions:would increase the possi-
 bility that the recurrent bor-
 der strife would lead to large-
 scale warfare.
 The UN and Jordan
 The "UN presence" in Jor-
 dan, sometimes known as the
 Spinelli mission after the am-
 bassador in charge, was set up
 by the UN secretary general in
 accordance with a General  'As-
 sembly resolution of 27 Septem-
 ber 1958.  The mission was en-
 trusted'to buttress the pledge
 given by the Arab states to
 bring an end to subversive in-
 terference with one another.
 The main office was set up in
 Amman, with subordinate offices
 to be established in Beirut and
 Damascus.   The latter offices
 were never established, al-
 though official permission was
 received eventually from the
 governments concerned.
 The mission functioned
 primarily as a clearing house
 for complaints of subversive
 activity against Jordan by the
 United Arab Republic.   Earlier
 this month Hammarskjold and the
 Jordanian prime minister agreed
 that the mission has served its
 purpose and would begin to
 phase out gradually and be dis-
 solved by September of this year.
 Although the Spinelli mis-
 sion amounted to merely a show

 tension, which had been acute.
 The UN and Lebanon
 A Security Council resolu-
 tion of 11 June 1958 authorized
 the establishment of an observer
 group to prevent illegal infil-
 tration of personnel or arms in-
 to Lebanon for revolutionary
 purposes.  The UNOGIL group was
 in Lebanon by 19 June-- eight
 day's later.   Its peak strength
 was, 579 officers and men from
 selected UN members acceptable
 to the host country.   The pres-
 ence of the group in Lebanon
 facilitated the withdrawal of
 American forces.   Although it
 was not equipped to prevent fur-
 ther infiltration of Syrian arms
 into Lebanon, UNOGIL's largely-
 symbolic character probably
 aided in diminishing tension.
 The senior UNOGIL member stated
 at the close of this UN opera-
 tion in December 1958 that al-
 though UNOGIL's activity had
 not been spectacular, the group's
 work "was no less real and ef-
 fective."
 The most significant fact
 of this UN operation was the
 speed with which the UN was
 able to recruit and place in the
 field a competent and effective
 group of military observers.
 UN Emergency Force
 The 5,000-man UN Emergency
 Force--which was established to
 patrol the Gaza and Sinai areas
 after the withdrawal of the
 British-French-Israeli invasion
 troops--is the only armed force
 --outside Of Korea--the UN has
 employed; UN military observers
 are unarmed.

 THE SOVIET CHEMICAL INDUSTRY
 The urgency which the So-
 viet Union attaches to the rapid
 expansion of the chemical indus-
 try has again been demonstrated
 by the announcement that the in-
 dustry's status will be discussed
 at next month's plenum of the
 central committee.   Many prob-
 lems, some already in evidence,
 must be overcome if the indus-
 try's goals for the next seven
 years--outlined a year ago in
 May at a central committee meet-
 ing--are to be achieved?
 The investment plan for the
 chemical industry in 1958 fell
 short of fulfillment by a consid-
 erable margin, and fulfillment,
 of Seven-Year Plan goals is un-
 likely without substantial im-
 ports of equipment and tech-
 nology from the West.   The five-
 year trade agreement signed with
 Britain on 24 May includes chemi
 cal, synthetics, and tire plants.
 Under existing trade pacts
 with Western countries, Moscow
 had planned to import at least
 $100,000,000 worth of chemical
 plants and equipment, and its
 recent drive to secure credits
 in the West indicates that its
 requirements are greater than
 its ability to pay for them
 through present exports.   The
 plenum undoubtedly will attempt
 to deal with this situation.
 In an attempt to overcome
 present shortages of chemical
 products and to allow for antici-
 pated requirements in 1965, the
 Seven-Year Plan calls for al-
 most a threefold increase in the
 output of chemicals in 1965
 as compared with 1958.
 To accomplish this the plan
 provides for a fivefold  in-
 crease in investment in the chemi-
 cal industry during 1959-65 over

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 May 1959
 During the plan period,the
 production of plastics is sched-
 uled to increase to seven times
 the 1958 rate, chemical fibers
 to four times, and synthetic
 rubber to two and one half times.
 The production of polyethylene
 and polypropylene--versatile
 plastics with broad consumer,
 industrial, and military uses--
 is slated to increase 246 times
 in the seven-year period. Achieve
 ment of these goals, however,
 would still not result in produc-
 tion greater than that of the
 United States, although output
 of the major synthetic products
 might approach the 1956 or 1957
 rates of US production.
 as fuel-binders in solid propel-
 lants for missiles.   Khrushchev
 stated that it would have been
 impossible to launch the sput-
 niks and the first artificial
 planet  without both polymeric
 materials and synthetic fuels.
 Isoprene rubber, which
 has properties very similar to
 those of natural rubber, is
 scheduled to comprise almost
 25 percent of the total produc-
 tion of synthetic rubber in 1965.
 V. S. Fedorov, chairman of the
 newly formed State Committee for
 Chemistry; since mid-1958, stated
 that fulfillment of the plan
 will enable the USSR to eliminate
 imports of natural rubber by 1965.
 Soviet officials have emphasized,
 however, that considerable tech-
 nical difficulties must be over-
 come before commercial produc-
 tion of isoprene rubber can be
 attained.
 Mineral Fertilizers
 From the Soviet viewpoint
 the heavy emphasis on expansion
 of synthetics production is
 clearly justified.   More and
 better synthetic materials are
 required to improve the range
 and quality of products for
 consumers and industry. Further-
 more, synthetic materials have
 in recent years received in-
 creased attention from the mili-
 tary, who can use the heat-
 resistant, lightweight, and
 electrical properties of many
 synth, '?ics in the manufacture
 of high-speed aircraft, missiles,
 and radar.
 In addition, some types of
 rubber and plastics now are used
 Very high goals. have again
 been set for the mineral ferti-
 lizer industry.  Although produc-
 tion in recent years has increased
 at a rate far below that required
 to reach the original 1964 goal
 of as capacity of 28,000,000 to
 30,000,000 tons--a target an-
 nounced by Khrushchev in 1953--
 the goal under the new plan is
 35,000,000 tons in 1965, nearly
 three times 1958 production.
 Gosplan has indicated that sup-
 plementary funds will be required
 for this expansion.
 Agricultural requirements
 for mineral fertilizers in 1965
 will not be met, even if the
 plan is fulfilled.  Agriculture
 is scheduled to receive 31,000,-
 000 tons of fertilizers in 1965,
 but the minimum requirement at
 that time reportedly will be 45,-
 000,000 tons.   The allotment
 would, however, satisfy require-
 ments for what are termed the
 basic "technical" crops--cot-
 ton, sugar beets, flax, tobacco,
 tea, and citrus fruits--and per-
 mit a fivefold  increase in con-
 sumption of fertilizers for other

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 May 1959)
 Petrochemicals
 The Seven-Year Plan calls
 for vastly  expanded  use of
 petroleum and natural gas as
 raw materials for the chemical
 industry.   In contrast with the
 American chemical industry, which
 derives a large share of its
 basic chemical output from these
 sources, the Soviet chemical
 industry has produced only lim-
 ited quantities of a few chemi-
 cals--notably ethyl alcohol--
 from petrochemicals.   The Soviet
 chemical industry's planned 19--
 fold increase  in consumption of
 petroleum products and natural
 gas is a good indication of the
 magnitude of the new program.
 Among the basic and inter-
 mediate chemicals scheduled to
 be derived wholly or partially.
 from petrochemical sources are
 ethylene, propylene, acetylene,
 butadiene, phenol, ammonia,
 ethyl  alcohol,   and acetone.
 From these chemicals will be
 produced such items as plastics,
 synthetic rubber,   synthetic
 fibers, fertilizers,and deter-
 gents.
 The shift to production of
 chemicals from petroleum and
 natural gas should result in
 considerable savings to the
 economy.   Conversion to the use
 of petrochemical raw materials
 in the production of synthetic
 rubber and nitrogen fertilizers
 alone may save more than 5 bil-
 lion rubles (about $1 billion)
 in 1959-65.
 1.958 Plan Results
 Soviet chemical industry
 output reportedly increased 13
 percent in 1958--a growth rate
 about equal to that in 1956 and
 1957, but modest'.when compared
 to the annual rate of 16 to -17
 percent required to fulfill the
 Seven-Year Plan.   Overfuifill-
 ment of the plan was reported
 for the "basic types" of plas-
 tics and chemical fibers, but
 the terminology used suggests
 that the plan for total produc-
 tion of these items may have
 been underfulfilled.   The tar-
 et for mineral fertilizers,
 sulfuric acid, synthetic ammonia,
 caustic soda, soda ash, synthetic
 rubber, and automobile tires was
 reportedly fulfilled ahead of
 schedule.
 The 1958 plan for investment
 was underfulfilled by 15 percent,
 and only one third of the in-
 stallations scheduled were put
 in operation.   Apparently the
 greatest failures occurred in
 the construction of synthetic-
 rubber, fiber, and plastic plants.
 Development of the petro-
 chemical industry was slow in
 19513.  Although a number of pilot
 or experimental plants went into
 production, the introduction of
 petrochemical processes on a com-
 mercial scale apparently was
 lim:Lted.to the conversion of part
 of the Stalinogorsk Chemical
 Combine to the use of natural
 gas as a source of hydrogen for
 the manufacture of ammonia.
 Major Problems
 The failure to achieve the
 planned level of investment in
 1958 has jeopardized future pro-
 duction goals and indicates major
 problems in the industry. Moscow
 has stated that underfulfillment
 resulted principally from the
 following:   lack of technical
 skills or data, shortages of
 equipment and materials, and un-
 satisfactory work by contractors.
 The most difficult problem
 which the USSR must overcome to
 fulfill the Seven-Year Plan is
 the lack of technical skills and
 data.   In petrochemicals especial-
 ly, the Soviet Union is planning
 to overcome shortcomings by capi-
 talizing on Western achievements.
 The second major difficulty
 .is shortage of equipment.   The
 {USSR, has stated that equipment
 shortages delayed completion of
 petrochemical synthetic rubber
 facilities at Sumgait and Voro-
 nezh and that construction of
 polyethylene production facilities

 MINORITY-LANGUAGE TRAINING IN THE USSR
 The educational reorganiza-
 tion under way in the Soviet Un-
 ion has brought into sharp fo-
 cus the problem of language train-
 ing in those areas of the USSR
 where Russian is not the predom-
 inant spoken language.   One of
 the Soviet regime's proudest
 boasts'has been that it has pro-
 vided education for its national
 minorities in their own languages.
 Written languages have been
 worked out for previously il-
 literate nomadic tribes, and in
 some areas there are two parallel
 school systems, one in the local
 language and one in Russian.
 The immensity of this task,
 however, as well as Stalin's
 .periodic emphasis on Russifi-
 cation, resulted in a very ir-
 regular distribution of local-
 language schools, especially
 above the elementary level.
 in minority areas the lo-
 cal-language schools ordinarily
 "terminate" after seven years,
 but students can usually trans-
 fer to Russian schools in the
 same area.  This may exaggerate
 the limitation of facilities for
 education given in languages
 other than Russian, but it does
 underline the fact that in some
 areas at least, a knowledge of
 Russian is the only doorway to
 intermediate and higher educa-
 tion, as well as a prerequisite
 for career advancement after
 graduation.
 The problem has been fur-
 ther complicated by the stand-
 ardized Soviet school system.
 Children in non-Russian areas
 have been under pressure to be-
 come fluent in both the local
 language and Russian, but no
 more time is allotted for lan-
 guage instruction than in Russian-
 speaking areas, where only Rus-
 sian is required.
 All of these factors have
 inhibited the development of
 competence in the native lan-
 guage.
 F A recent article
 on the situation in the Ukraine     25X1
 in an educational journal com-
 mented that Ukrainian grammar
 is taught only in grades five
 through seven and that, as a
 result,, ,'many students taking
 written tests in the Ukrainian
 language were not thinking in
 Ukrainian; they constructed
 sentences according to rules
 of the Russian language and then
 translated them into Ukrainian...
 mixing in Russian words."'

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 May 1959
 Although less forthright
 in their criticism, almost all
 of the recent republic writers'
 congresses have expressed similar
 concern about language defici-
 encies among young writers who
 are unable to express themselves
 grammatically in their native
 tongues.
 Reorganization Proposals
 The educational reorgani-
 zation formally launched last
 :fall added the strain of "in-
 creased vocational training" to
 a curriculum already overburdened
 in the minority areas with the
 language problem.   Khrushchev's
 September memorandum proposed
 a general compulsory "seven- or
 eight-year"  elementary   school.
 His basic principle, often
 reiterated, was that all further
 education was to be accomplished
 :in combination with productive
 work in the national economy.
 Khrushchev also proposed
 three types of intermediate
 schools:   two of them vocational
 schools not designed to lead to
 further schooling,, and the third,
 combining academic and polytech-
 nic training, leading to higher
 education.   No one, however, has
 stated what percentage of stu-
 dents will attend the third-type
 schools.
 Khrushchev's memorandum
 did not mention the problem of
 language training in minority
 areas, but once. the subject of
 education had been raised, this
 problem was widely and heatedly
 discussed in those areas by
 educators, writers,  party offici-
 als,and parents. They argued
 that the proposed seven- or
 eight-year general school should
 be lengthened to nine or. even
 eleven years in non-Russian-
 speaking areas, on the grounds
 that the extra time was needed
 to teach pupils both the local
 :Language and Russian, and that
 both should be compulsory for
 all students.
 The November"Theses of the
 Party and Government on Educa-
 tion" suggested a compromise:
 parents could choose the language
 of :instruction, and the individual
 student could take the alternate
 language as an additional course,
 provided he felt he could carry
 the increased academic load.
 Parents would thus be confronted
 with the choice of sacrificing
 either the child's cultural
 heritage or his future career
 advantages.
 In late December, the na-
 tional education law was passed
 by the USSR Supreme Soviet es-
 tablishing the "basic principles",
 in the sphere of education.   In
 general, the law followed the
 lines laid down in Khrushchev's
 September memorandum, providing
 for an eight-year general com-
 pulsory school and "increased
 labor training."  Both the
 memorandum and the national
 law completely ignored the prob-
 lem of minority language train-
 ing.   The individual republics
 were left to deal with the sub-
 ject; within the limits established
 by the "basic principles".' in
 the national law.
 The Republic Laws
 Most republics followed the
 lead of the November "theses"
 requiring parents to choose the
 preferred language of instruc-
 tion.   The alternate language
 will be available as an additional
 subject if enough students request
 it.
 Latvian schools, which have
 long required Lettish, Russian,
 and at least one other. language,
 will apparently drop or skimp
 on some other academic subjects
 rather than force a choice of
 language.  The republic law made
 no reference to the language

 The Azerbaidzhani law gives
 parents the right to choose the
 language of instruction but did
 not specify whether the addi-
 tional language is to be com-
 pulsory.  The Azerbaidzhani pre-
 mier hinted in a speech on the
 law that both might be required
 courses.
 The heated public discusslcns
 and the regime's careful  han-
 ng of the problem suggest that
 the issue of language training
 is a sensitive one.   It is worth
 noting, however, that critics
 unanimously accepted the teach-
 ing of both the local language
 and Russian and no one criticized
 the fact that Russian is a pre-
 requisite for higher education
 and career advancement.   The
 furor over the minority-language
 problem seems to have involved
 opposition to the reorganization
 itself as well as nationalist
 pride.
 The critics' basic concern
 is the amount of education which
 will be available to the average
 student.   Uncertain that inter-
 mediate education will be avail-
 able, they are all the more de-
 termined to maintain the level of
 education offered by the elementary
 school, and they fear that the
 apparent gain in an added eighth
 year of compulsory schooling will
 be negated by the increased time
 sent in labor training-
