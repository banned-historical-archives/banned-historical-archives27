 THE PRESIDENT'S EXPORT COUNCIL
 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20230
 1511 K Street, NW
 Washington, DC 20005
 September 22, 1983
 The President
 The White House
 Washington, D.C.
 My dear Mr. President:
 Since my return from my lengthy trip to the Soviet Union, Europe, Middle
 East and Far East, I had the good fortune to see you and Mrs. Reagan
 at the tihite House twice already in the short period of t D weeks, however,
 there were always other people around and I was not able to give you a
 brief report on my mission.  As a private citizen, as well as Vice Chairman
 of the President's Export Council, I have already sent my report to
 Mr. Ed Meese, Jim Baker, Mike Deaver, Judge Clark, Secretary of State
 George Shultz and Cap Weinberger, but I do want to give you a brief
 report on my tour.
 I thought you might be interested to know during my visit to the P.R.C.,
 I was a special guest of Mr. Deng Xiaoping and stayed at the state
 guest house reserved for heads of state.  I spent over an hour talking
 to Deng Xiaoping privately without their officers attending.  I also had
 a private talk with their Foreign Minister Wu Xue-Qian who is now attending
 the U.N. conference in New York and later on after his visit to Canada
 will go to Washington for his official visit.  Mr. Deng Xiaoping talked to
 me on four issues:
 1.  Relationship between the United States and P.R.C.
 2.  Future of the P.R.C. and Taiwan
 3.  Sino-Soviet ongoing relationship and what is to be
 expected in the years to come
 4.  South and North Korea situation and Chinese view on
 Korean issue.
 I arrived Seoul, Korea the day after the Korean plane was shot down.  I
 visited Korea at the invitation of President Chun as a private citizen and
 as a friend. On September 2nd President Chun invited many of our Senators
 who were attending the U.S.-Korea Security Conference for dinner to which I
 was also a guest.  After dinner President Chun asked me to stay over and
 have a private talk with him.  I know you will be visiting Korea in
 November and are considering a visit to the P.R.C. in the near future.
 As a friend and confidante of many of the Asian leaders, and other
 people, I awn fortunate to have an in-depth knowledge of sane of the Asian
 countries, however, I remain low-key and low-profile.  If there should be

 any way I can be of help to you and your administration in dealing
 with the Far East and Southeast Asia, I will be at your service.
 With wannest regards to you and our First Lady, Nancy, I am
 Respectfully yours,
 Anna Chennault
 Vice Chairman

 In August this year, during the recess of the U.S. Congress, I
 travelled to Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East on a
 good-will and trade promotion as well as fact finding mission
 with Senator Orrin Hatch  (R-Utah)  and Senator Edward Zorinsky
 (D-Nebraska).   In my capacity     Vice Chairman of the President's
 Export Council, and Advisory Committee of A.I.D. and member of
 the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Service, and
 finally, as President of my own organization, TAC International,
 I had the opportunity to meet with not only leaders of the countries
 we visited but also leaders in the private sector which assisted
 this mission to gain updated information on the world problems
 we face today and also exchange U.S. views on various issues with
 our friends and allies, as well as with our adversaries.
 This will be a lengthy report - I will do it c>untry oy      ntry
 in order to present a more in-depth analysis of my observations.
 I also would like to point out since we were travelling as
 government representatives we received briefings by each
 United States   embassy we visited.   The letter from President
 Reagan addressed to me emphasizing the importance of trade among
 nations was extremely helpful to spread good-will.   Finally,
 serving a^ advisor to the Secretary of Defense's office and A.I.D.,
 also pro-,,_ded me with other dimensions of contact particular?- in
 some of the countries where we have been working very closely in
 defense and trade.
 Another point of interest which I c(-rider is important for the
 taxpayer to know is while many other Congressional groups were
 travelling around the world using government aircraft and having
 expenses paid by the taxpayer, we travelled by commercial air
 carriers and I paid for all my own travelling expense.   Meeting
 with our own U.S. Chamber of Commerce groups in various cities
 during many early breakfasts, they cheered and applauded when I
 told them we travelled in a small group and   lthou,h we served
 as official mission, no taypayer money was used to support our
 assignment.
 The following was our itinerary and schedule of appointments.
 While most of the appointments in Europe,  the Middle East,
 Moscow was handled by Senator Hatch's office,  the schedule for
 the People's Republic of China, South Korea and Taiwan was
 handled by my office through the highest level, directly with
 each country concerned and it was that portion of the trip
 this mission received the highest visibility and contact.
 Our trip began on Friday August 18,  1983 from Washington DC to
 London via New York by Pan American Airline.   We were met by
 the staff of the U.S. Embassy and was told almost every day
 they had U.S. VIPs coming through London and saris during the
 Congressional recess.   The party spent the night at the Airport

 Sheraton Hotel and the next morning, Friday, August 19th, we
 left London in the morning by British Airways for Moscow.
 British Airways used Boeing 707 on this flight - there
 were no first class seats - only economy.   Attendants on the
 flight made a casual remark to me "There are more people want
 to get out of Moscow than want t^ go in."
 MOSCOW
 We arrived Moscow in the afternoon of Friday, August 19th.
 At the airport we were met by the U.S. Embassy staff, Mr.  and
 Mrs. Mark Parris as well as the Commercial Director, Dr. Robert
 Krause.   The Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Arthur Hartman
 was in the United States at the time and DCM Warren Zimmermann
 was in charge.   We went directly from the airport to t:-.? -n'assy
 building where Warren and Tenny Zimmermann weia having a reception
 honoring the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Animal Exchange Program.   It was my
 understanding this exchange is part of a global program sponsored
 by the Smithsonian World called the Species Survival Plan, a
 newly coordinated effort by zoos worldwide to determine which
 species are most threatened, which should be helped, and how.
 Last summer the U.S. and U.S.S.R. each exchanged three
 Przewalski horses  (Mongolian wild horse), a species extinct
 in the wild and only surviving in captivity.   In the past,  the
 U.S. has received Siberian steppe polecats,  and Siberian crane
 eggs  (some of which became chicks enroute).  In return the
 U.S. has sent to the U.S.S.R. Musk ox(   and Trumpeter swans
 from Alaska, and Siberian cranes.   Thi. Fall the U.S. will send
 a male sea lion from southern California to the Moscow Zoo for
 breeding.
 Siberian tigers  (Amur)  are no longer caught in the wild.   Their
 captive population of a few hundred in the U.S.  is all derived
 from only 17 founder animals.   This means their gene'ic
 diversity or "gene pool" is severely limited a.,d outside
 bloodlines are necessary to prevent degenerative inbreeding.
 The three tigers in this exchange will go to the Bronx,  Indiana-
 polis and Omaha Zoos.   This animal exchange is made possible by
 the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Environmental Agreement,  signed in 1972, which
 provides for the continuing exchange of endangered species
 between the two countries to improve their captive breeding and
 ultimate survival.   I do not mean to go on at such length talking
 about the program, however,  it demonstrates U.S. effort to
 maintain a reasonable balanced relationship with the U.S.S.R.
 In Moscow we stayed at the Rossiya Hotel, probably one of the
 largest hotels in the world with almost 4,000 rooms, however,
 the management of the hotel was typical of a Communist country.
 Upon arrival at the hotel, each guest received their identification
 card and with the identification card,  the guest goes to the
 floor assigned to him and receives the room key for his assigned
 room.   When one leaves the hotel,  the key must be turned in and
 in exchange you receive a card for re-entry into the hotel.

 I broke their system by giving packages of cigarettes to the
 husky women minding the desk and the second day they all became
 very friendly and willing to serve tea and coffee to me.
 The Rossiya Hotel is located next to Red Square.   When the
 two Senators requested rooms facin" Red Square,  their
 requests were refused.   The reason was no foreign guests are
 allowed to stay in rooms facing Red Square.
 It was my first visit to the Soviet Union - also a first for
 both Senators Hatch and Zorinsky.   Both Senators requested
 meeting with Andropov but it was during the week-end and the
 government officials sent word back that President Yuri V.
 Andropov already met with a delegation of Democrat U.S.
 Senators including Russell Long of Louisiana and Claibor--A Pell
 of Rhode Island,  therefore,  they should meet with other       ^^rs.
 I did meet with officers of the U.S.S.R.  Trade -erartment, as
 well as Deputy Chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
 Chetverikov.   Mr. Chetverikov was stationed in Washington prior
 to his new assignment at the Foreign Ministry.   He is now in
 charge of U.S.A. affairs in the Foreign Ministry in Moscow.
 On Saturday, August 20th we received a briefing from DCM
 Warren Zimmeriann.   Both Senator Hatch and Senator Zorinsky
 attended the evening meeting at the synagogue in Moscow and met
 with Jewish leaders who gather in front of the synagogue
 every Saturday afternoon.   Senator Hatch,  as Vice Chairman of
 Foreign Policy of the Republican Senate  'teering Committee
 talked to Gen. Milshtein who is Director of the USA-Canadian
 Institute and also Gen. Nikolay Chervov, Chief of Soviet general
 staff, Department for Arms Control, while Senator Zorinsky and myself
 met with Boris Gordeyed, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade.   Senator
 Zorinsky is particularly interested in the question of grain sales
 to the Soviet Union and both parties showed some gratification
 that the grain sales agreement was signed prior  -o our departure
 from Washington, D.C.   Of course, I must point cut all this
 took place ten days prior to the Soviet downing of a South Korea
 airplane with 269 people on board.   Just for the information of
 the readers of this report,  I enclose a copy of Senator Pell's
 delegation list to the Soviet Union.   They were traveling by
 government aircraft provided by the U.S.  Government with 9
 Senators and their wives, all Democrats, and about 20 staff
 members.   They were also provided a private plane to travel
 around the Soviet Union.  (Enclosure A)
 Mr. Andropov made the statement to the group of U.S. Democratic
 Senators that the U.S.S.R.  assumes the commitment not to be
 the first to put into outer space any type of anti-satellite
 weapon,  i.e.,  imposes a unilateral moratorium on such launchings
 for the entire period during which the other states,  including
 the U.S.A. will refrain from stationing in outer space anti-
 satellite weapons of any type.   Senator Pell said "We must hope
 that this moratorium is not a ploy but a step towards serious

 Approved For Release 2008/01/15: CIA-RDP85M00364R002404760018-3
 negotiations on eliminating these destabilizing weapons." At
 the same time we read reports from the Washington Post that
 Moscow planned to build mobile intercontinental missiles to
 prevent its land base missile forces from becoming vulnerable
 to attack from more accurate U.S. missiles that are being
 developed.   There were also reports in The Herald Tribune
 stating that the U.S. and NATO allies  may have to develop a
 different kind of war plan for bases in Europe because the Soviet
 missiles are becoming so lethal.   The Soviet theater missile
 that NATO nations are concerned about are the SS-21 with a
 range of about 72 miles  (116 kilometers)  and the SS-22 and
 SS-23 with a range of about 300 miles.    U.S. aerospace
 executives long have said that the advances in short take off
 planes depends largely on how much money the Pentagon makes
 available.   After the Korean incident, hopefully our defense
 budget will receive more serious and reasonable considerat=-n.
 On the issue of trade, we talked about the White house instruct-
 ing departments and agencies affected by East-West trade to
 review the advantages and disadvantages of controls on oil
 t.quipment exports to the Soviet Union.
 Case in point concerned the Caterpillar Tractor Co. of Peoria,
 Illinois, which is the principal U.S. maker of pipe layers.
 It is locked it  a global marketing struggle with Komatsu Co.
 of Japan, which faces no export controls.   Caterpillar lost
 $264 million in the first half of this year and expects further
 losses in the second half.   Caterpillar says that the Russians
 have turned to Komatsu for thousands of p:' - layers since the
 controls were imposed by President Jimmy Carter in July 1978
 in response to the jailings of Anatoli B.  Scharansky and
 Alexander Ginsburg, two Soviet dissidents.
 Last January,  the Commerce Department approved licenses for
 200 pile layers, but the Soviet purchasers told Caterpillar
 that they would not buy the equipment until the li-ensinc
 requirement was eliminated, administration officiates said.
 The 200 pipe layers would have cost $90 million.
 Those opposed to relaxing controls argue that the U.S. position
 in COCOM could be undermined by a relaxation, which would make
 it appear that the United States cares more about commerce than
 strategic issues.   They also argue that the human rights
 situation has not improved. Furthermore,  they say, a relaxation
 would benefit one company, rather than treat all producers
 of oil and gas equipment equally.
 The writer of this report takes no position on this issue except
 to report some of the comments.

 On Sunday we took a tour of the Kremlin;  also visited the Lenin
 Stadium where they perform ballet on ice.   The two Senators
 and myself were also invited to visit the Embassy of the
 People's Republic of China in Moscow and had tea with the PRC
 Ambassador and staff at their very elaborate embassy which
 I was told had a staff of about 300.     asked the Chinese
 officials about Sino-Soviet relations and they told me it has
 slightly improved in recent months and high level negotiations
 will continue to be conducted.
 I consider the highlight of my visit to Moscow was the tour
 of the Zagorsk - about an hour and fifteen minutes drive from
 Moscow.   Zagorsk is a showplace for the U.S.S.R.  to show the
 foreign visitors that under Communism religious worship is
 still permitted. We toured many churches built during the er
 of the Russian Czars.   They were gorgeously preserved    Bein,
 a Sunday, every church was jam-packed with worshipp?rs as well
 as tourists.   As a Catholic,  I have been to many cathedrals
 around the world but was never as impressed as the mass I
 at-ended at the Cathedral of Zagorsk.
 After mass the priest invited our group to lunch at their
 religious institute.   Coffee,  sandwiches,  sweets and chocolate
 as well as local]- made brandy were served.   I gave the priest
 and head of the religious institute Parker pens and a very
 generous contribution to the cathedral.   The Pell delegation
 were also touring the same vicinity, however,  I was told they
 were not invited to lunch or tea by the mangy -ment.   Maybe
 there were too many of them in one group.
 On my visit to the Soviet Union,  I have one simple comment, on which
 I am sure the majority of taxpayers will agree with me.   Whether
 we are in the private sector or in the public domain,  in order
 to make a sound and realistic global policy, one should not and
 must not be utilized by any special interest group.   We mu:,-
 remember we are all Americans.   America can only negotiate
 from a position of strength not from a position of weakness.
 We must have a broader global policy which benefits the common
 interests of the United States.   Our friends as well as our
 enemies recognize the strength of our nation but also recognize the
 weakness of our division.   In the coming election of 1984,  I
 hope members of Congress as well as contenders for the Presidential
 race, and their advisors will put the national interest as our
 first priority.
 I enclose a report from the United States Commerce office of
 March 1983 of the 10 largest imports of the U.S.S.R.  and 10
 largest exports from the U.S.S.R.  (Enclosure B)

 From Moscow we took Air France Flight 721 for Paris.   We landed
 at Charles de Gaulle Airport at 5:40 p.m. Monday August 22nd.
 Since our stay in Paris was brief,  I asked for a meeting with
 our U.S. Commercial Attache in Paris, Mr. William Tatge.   In
 Paris we stayed at the Paris Hilton.   The same evening we had
 dinner with Mr.  and Mrs. Ervin Brown, a _ersonal friend of
 Senator Hatch and a promotor of the Program for Democracy.
 Tuesday, August 23rd our party left Paris by TWA Flight 806
 for Israel arriving Tel Aviv at 3:45 p.m.   The party used the
 King David Hotel in Jerusalem as our headquarters and conducted
 our meetings with various parties concerned in the hotel and
 away from the hotel.   Prior to our arrival in Israel, C del
 had requested a visit to Merkava Tank plant and the Israeli
 aircraft industry, also meetings with Begin and Shamir.   The
 requ sts were granted and we had good visits at the factories
 and with Begin and Shamir.   As for the other countries in the
 Middle East such as Beirut, Damascus, Cairo, Amman, Riyadh,
 Dhahran, Doha and Bahrain,  instead of giving my own observations,
 I simply quote requests from Hatch's office to Embassy "for
 Beirut,  Damascus,  Giro,  Amman,  Riyadh,  Dhahran,  Doha and
 Bahrain:  "Codel,  including Mrs. Chennault but not wives
 and Corkins is planning whirlwind tour to as many of these
 posts as possible during the period August 26-28.   Hope is to
 provide broad strategic purview for these two   anators, neither
 of whom have ever visited these countries before.       It is worth
 noting that both Senators were original opponents of AWACS
 but ended up voting in favor of the sale.   Posts visited will
 depend on Embassy recommendations and availability of heads
 of state and other senior host government officials including
 foreign ministers.   Codel would be willing to add two additional
 days to this portion of program if there is sufficient host
 country interest.   Embassies are requested to suggest programs.
 Ideally, Codel will fly via military air from Israel to Beirut
 on Friday,.August 26.   They will call on Marine commander,
 Lebanese officials, and have brief tour of city before departing
 for Cairo.   Overnight in Cairo, meet with country team and
 Egyptian officials and depart for Amman at approximately noon
 Saturday,   August 27 for country team briefing.   Calls on
 Jordanian officials and overnight.   On Sunday, August 28 they will
 depart for Riyadh for AWACS briefing and calls on Saudi officials,
 leaving Riyadh at noon for Dhahran where they will receive USMTM
 briefing, overflight of oil fields, Congen briefing on Eastern
 Province and possible visit to F-5 base.   They will then depart
 for Bahrain for briefing by country team, call on foreign
 minister,  and possible dinner with Admiral Gurney aboard the
 Coronado or Helicopter flight to Spruance-class destroyer on
 station.   Codel will depart Bahrain for Sharjah in time to meet
 flight to Beijing which departs at 1:40 a.m.   Wives and Corkins
 will not accompany above trip on military air but will take
 commercial flight from Amman to Sharjah via Doha.   "

 As a member of Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Service,
 (DACOWITS),  I was invited to breakfast with Col. Amira Dotan,
 who is the Chief of the Women's Corps of Israel, and her Deputy.
 We had a lengthy discussion on Israeli women in the service.
 We have some identical problems in the U.S.   We touched on many
 issues of defense and suggested improvemen-1 can be gradually pro-
 moted in order to help women in the military service.   We also
 discussed with Col. Dotan the possibility of her visiting the
 United States.   Col. Dotan joined the army at the age of 18.   Now
 at the age of 36 she has been in the service for 18 years.   She
 is an extremely charming and attractive woman, married with two
 young children.   It proves a woman can have two careers - as
 wife and mother at home and also serving her country with
 dedication.   Col. Dotan gave credit to her husband for his
 support and understanding stating that without that blessing
 she probably would not be where she is today.
 In Israel one senses the urgency of preventing continued confronta-
 tion but also the frustration and hopelessness of maintaining
 peace LZ any kind.   While we had the opportunity to tour Bethlehem,
 and many religious sites as tourists to the Holy Land, we were
 continuously being reminded that people who live in the Holy Land
 and vicinity have been brothers and sisters for many generations
 and yet they have bee: fighting long before Jesus Christ was born.
 Some interesting information regarding Jerusalem:
 "Jerusalem is situated in the Judean Hills about 40 miles from
 the Mediterranean,  at an altitude of 2,710 feet    The physical
 setting is dazzling.   On a clear day you can look to the east
 and see the Dead Sea  (1,300 feet below sea   level),  the Jordan
 Valley,  and the Mountain of Moab.   To the west, the outline of
 Tel Aviv is visible.   The Jerusalem consular district includes
 the City of Jerusalem and the west bank of the Jordan River,
 occuped by Israel during the 1967 War.   The area of this district
 is approximately 5500 square kilometers.   It is almost e-tirel'
 mountainous except for the valley of the Jordan River.
 The population of the Jerusalem consular district includes a
 variety of cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds.   The two
 largest of these groups are an Israeli population of about
 285,000 and a Palestinian Arab population of about 735,000.
 There are other groups of varying sizes,  including Armenians,
 Druze, Samaritans and Beduin.   Religion is an important element.
 Jerusalem has vast significance for Judaism, Christianity, and
 Islam alike.   The religious holidays are felt and observed as
 in no other city in the world.   The Israeli population follows
 Judaism in varying degrees of orthodoxy.   The Palestinian
 population is about 7.5% Muslim,  (predominantly Sunni), and
 about 7% Christian  (of many different sects but predominantly
 Greek Orthodox).
 The status of the Consulate General -- indeed the status of the
 city of Jerusalem itself -- is complex and frequently misunder-
 stood.   The following sketch provides a rough outline of U.S.

 policies and their origins, but readers should bear in mind that
 no explanation as brief as this can really do justice to the
 intricacies of the issues involved.
 Circumstances have made Congen Jerusalem an unusual post.   It
 is one of two independent consular posts in 'he American Foreign
 Service, the other being Hong Kong.   The Consul General has the
 status of Chief of Mission. And while the U.S. has had consular
 representation in Jerusalem for almost 140 years, personnel
 assigned here are not accredited either to the Government of
 Israel or the Government of Jordan, both of which claim sovereignty
 in the city.
 The unique status of the Consulate General is itself the result
 of the still unresolved status of Jerusalem in international law.
 Immediately after the termination in 1948 of the British ma-'date
 in Palestine, war broke out between the Arabs and Israeli..   At
 the conclusion of hostilities, Jerusalem was divided, with
 Arab forces in control of the walled city and suburbs to the
 north anL east, and Israeli forces in control of West Jerusalem.
 This regrettable division of the city was acknowledged "de facto"
 but never "de jure" by the U.S. government and most of the inter-
 national community.
 It was widely agreed that the ultimate status of this unique
 city should be resolved not by force of arms or unilateral action,
 but through peaceful negotiations among the parties concerned.
 Determined to avoid any step that might appear to   -ejudge the
 outcome of such negotiations,  the U.S. kept its Embassy in Tel
 Aviv  (where Israel initially established its government)  and left
 it to the Consulate General to represent American interests in
 Jerusalem -- on both sides of the ceasefire line.
 The "de facto" division of the city continued until the Six Day
 war in June 1967, when Israeli Defense Forces occupied the entirE
 city of Jerusalem and the West Bank of the Jordan River.   ohortly
 after the war,  the Israeli Parliament unilaterally enlarged the
 Jerusalem municipal boundaries to include some areas of the West
 Bank.   Fourteen years later,  in 1981,  Israel formally annexed
 the expanded city.   The U.S. Government does not recognize
 either the expansion or the annexation as legitimate.   At the
 same time, however,  the U.S. has consistently made clear its
 belief that Jerusalem should be a united city within which there
 would be no restrictions on the movement of persons or goods,
 with free access to holy sites by people of all faiths and
 nationalities."
 In general, people who live in the middle of the Mid-East conflict,
 whether in Israel, Jordan,  Saudi Arabia, or the U.A.E., do not
 have much hope for peace in the near future.   Of course we did
 not go to Lebanon.   There is a war going on.  I for one did not
 feel justified for our representatives to take care of Washington
 visitors while they have more important things to do.

 EGYPT
 We left Tel Aviv for Cairo on Sunday, August 28th.   My purpose
 for visiting Cairo was to talk to officials from the U.S.
 Commercial Office and also to meet some of the U.S. business
 leaders in Cairo.   The U.S. Commercial Attache, Ted Rosen, met
 me at the airport and made arrangements for me to lunch with
 U.S. business leaders at the home of the U.S. DCM Henry Precht
 and Mrs. Precht.   U. S.  companies in Egypt are active in
 investment, trade and development.   The A.I.D. and F.M.S.
 contractors are also very much involved in that area since the
 U.S.  is spending very substantial sums funding many projects
 in Egypt.   U.S. business leaders would like to see a closer
 working relationship between the A.I.D. representatives and
 U.S. firms.   I was impressed by the enthusiasm of our represent-
 atives in Egypt and promised to pay them another visit with a
 few representatives of the President's Export Council, hope-u ly
 sometime early in 1984.
 From Cairo we took Gulf Air to Sharjah, part of the United Arab
 Emirates.   On this flight, we saw the true practice of Moslem
 custom of discrimination against women.   The plane from Cairo
 to Sharjah, via Bahrain, was fully booked.   Many Arab women,
 young and old, came on board the plane.   Their faces were fully
 covered by black veils,  L.1d under the veils they had half-masks
 on their faces.
 Most of the passengers got off at Bahrain and a few of us on
 board the plane went on to Sharjah.   In Sharjah, we   ere met
 by the staff of the U.S. Embassy, also representatives of the
 PRC and Manager of CNAC,  since we were on our way to Beijing.
 PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
 Our party arrived Beijing,  the capital of the PRC on Monday,
 August 29th, at 1:40 p.m.   We were met by U.S. Ambassador and
 Mrs.  Arthur Hummel, President of the Chinese People's Institute
 for Foreign Affairs, Mr.  Hao Deqing, Secretary General of the
 same institute, Li Xie and many others.
 Since I was the principal guest of the PRC, both Senators and
 accompanying party were given the courtesy to stay at the
 government guest house Diaoyutai.   The villa  where we stayed
 at Diaoyutai has a fixed rate for all VIPs local currency of
 $6,000. per day.   That is the equivalent of US$3,000. per day,
 which includes transportation, breakfast,  lunch or dinner if so
 desired and service of men and women attendants at the villa.
 The other congressional delegations,  such as Senator Jackson's
 delegation stayed at the hotel in Beijing.   Both Senators Hatch
 and Zorinsky were only charged $75.00 per day for their stay
 and that included limousines, chauffeurs and cars for sight-
 seeing.   The villa Number 15 where we stayed, was to house
 King Hussein and his party during his state visit to the PRC
 (the day after we left China for Tokyo).

 I had private meetings with Deng Xiaoping, who now holds many
 titles, however, he prefers the title of Chairman.   I also
 had a private meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs,
 Mr. Wu Xue-Qian, both of them spent more than an hour with me
 alone.   We talked on many issues which I promised I would not put
 in writing nor make any statement.   Both of them asked me for
 another return visit alone to spend a little bit more time with
 various officials which I promised I would do.   The Minister
 of Trade and Economics, Mr. Chen Mu Hwa, had a dinner in my
 honor and mentioned the visit of our Secretary of Commerce,
 Malcolm Baldrige which he considered a successful visit.   I
 also had lunch with the Minister of Air and Space, Mr. Chien
 and breakfast with Mr. Chen Tao,  the Director of Civilian
 Air Administration who visited South Korea during the hijack
 of the CACA aircraft from China to South Korea.   He was the
 highest ranking officer to visit South Korea in recent years.

 Show description: The Chinese government made a formal request
 that a second China Comm exhibition be produced in 1984. This
 request came at the conclusion of the highly successful China
 Comm 82, where U.S.  ten million dollars in contrac's were
 negotiated for telecommunications, computers.  "
 Our party departed Beijing Thursday September 1, early in
 the morning for Tokyo.   Senators Hatch and Zorinsky met with
 our U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Mike Mansfield, while I spent
 time with members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for an
 early breakfast at the Okura Hotel in Tokyo.
 It was during our stay in Tokyo we learned of the sad incident
 with the South Korean Airline Jumbo Jet with 269 passengers
 aboard,  shot dwn by the Soviet fighter north of Japan on
 Thursday, September 1.   The world was shocked by this bloody
 criminal act.
 We left Tokyo for Seoul, Korea on Friday, September 2nd.   Prior
 to my departure from Washington for this around the wor    trip,
 President Chun Doo Hwan asked me to stay a day longer
 in order to have dinner with him and Mrs. Chun alone.   Since that
 was not possible, due to my tight schedule,  I was invited to
 dinner given by President Chun at the Blue House on September 2nd
 honoring the participants in the Seoul forum on Korea-U.S.
 Security Cooperation.   During dinner, President Chun talked
 about the brutality of the Soviet attack on an unarmed civilian
 airplane carrying 269 people.   After dinner President Chun
 asked me to stay over for a private talk which lasted about
 two hours.   A special report on our talk will be presented to
 President Reagan separately.
 In addition to my private meeting with President Chun,  I also
 had a private meeting with the new Chairman of the Korean
 Congress, Mr. Chae Mun-shik    in fact, he sent his aide to
 the airport to take me to his office upon my arrival in Seoul.
 I also had a brief meeting with Foreign Minister Lee Bum-suk,
 and promised that I will have another visit sometime next
 year; hopefully it will be a trade mission representing the
 President's Export Council.
 From Seoul,  Korea we took China Airlines  to Taipei,  Taiwan on
 Saturday, September 3rd in the early afternoon, arriving Taipei
 just in time to attend a dinner given by Prime Minister Y.S.  Sun

 of the Republic of China on Taiwan.   I had made arrangements
 for both Senator Hatch and Senator Zorinsky to meet with
 President Chiang Ching-kuo on Monday, September 5th, while
 I had to return to Washington on urgent matters Sunday,
 September 4th.
 CONCLUSION
 Although the schedule on this trip was tight and we were
 trying to cover a lot of territory in a short period of time,
 yet what we accomplished could not have been accomplished
 by sitting in the office.   It is gratifying to have this oppor-
 tunity to talk to so many leaders person to person.
 For those who read this report, I. welcome your comments and
 if you should have any questions, please contact my office.
