 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                      413'
 plan by the American people. We know
 to  our  mortification  the  final  ransom
 paid  for          the  prisoners  with chemicals
 and   drugs  dragooned  from   the  Ameri-
 can companies by U.S. officials of this ad-
 ministration. We know, to our bewilderment,
 the dispersal of   the refugees;  the orders
 prohibiting Cuban exiles from use of any
 of our shoreline for attacks on the Castro-
 ites and the persistent denial during 1962
 by the U.S. Government of the clear evi-
 dence that Cuba was being made a major
 Communist arsenal in this hemisphere.  We
 remember with soaring pride the sudden,
 dramatic, and courageous recognition of the
 direct threat to our country posed by a mis-
 sile armed 'Cuba; the unequivocal demand
 on Russia that all surface-to-surface mis-
 siles and long-range aircraft be removed
 from Cuba; that her territory be open to on-
 the-spot inspection by neutral teams or Red
 Cross inspectors.  We remember the initial
 success of this program with the announced
 withdrawal  of  missiles and  aircraft,  and
 with a sinking heart we recognized that the
 inspections were to be dropped as high U.S.
 officials stated that Mr. Khrushchev must
 not be pushed too far.  We have seen the
 building of Cuba as a front line, first-class
 arsenal and training camp for militant com-
 munism; and the arrogant contempt with
 which  they  supported  the  Panamanian
 riots and then contemptuously cut off our
 water supply at Guantahamo while we said
 and did nothing of substance,
 After 4 years of Democratic foreign policy,-
 Cuba has been transformed Into an island
 firmly in Communist control; with the sec-
 ond largest arsenal of military weapons in
 the   hemisphere;   with   around-the-clock
 Communist propaganda pouring into Cen-
 tral and South America; exporting arms and
 trained saboteurs   to  Central  and  South
 American countries; convicted by the Orga-
 nization of American States` as guilty of ex-
 porting aggression to other countries in this
 hemisphere; and a training camp for Com-
 munist provocateurs active from Venezuela
 to Ghana, to Gabon, to Zanzibar, to Burma.
 A record no citizen of this country, regard-
 less of party, can view with pride or satis-
 faction.  The vacillating, wavering incon-
 clusive policy of this administration with
 respect. to Cuba must be changed.
 The second plank of that 1960 campaign
 was devoted to the low prestige of the United.
 States in Europe and in other portions of
 the world and the need to regain leadership
 and direction of the free world struggle.
 This plank was repeated endlessly during the
 1960 campaign; and as purported evidence,
 statements were made that the NATO coun-
 tries had not accepted U.S. programs for
 strengthening the Alliance; that the Com-
 munists continued to advance in South Viet-
 nam; that the solution to German reunifi-
 cation had not been reached; and that U.S.
 sanction of U-2 flights over Russia had lost
 us respect in all countries.
 Shortly after inauguration in 1981, the
 President stated in a worldwide television
 news conference that we would come to the
 aid of Laos, a small but strategic country in
 southeast Asia under attack by the Com-
 munists.
 Shortly thereafter, we retracted this stated
 position, advocated a cease  fire,  actively
 solicited a coalition government, and forced
 this upon that defenseless country, with the
 Communists given the key posts of Ministry
 of Defense and Ministry of Interior.   These
 are the two governmental posts historically
 used by Communists to take over control of
 a country.  Thereafter, the Cuban Bay of
 Pigs fiasco occurred.   Then the President
 met with Mr. Khrushchev in Vienna and
 upon his return to this country stated that
 Mr. Khrushchev had made no new demands
 upon him.   A short 10 days later, Mr. Khru-
 shchev published a written memorandum
 of points and demands submitted at that
 conference.  In August 1981, in violation of
 all agreements and all decency, the Commu-
 nists constructed the Berlin wall.  A major
 city and the families in it were divided, and
 the flood of refugees from Communistic East
 Germany and East Berlin subsided to a slow
 trickle.  The only reaction from the United
 States was a verbal protest and a speech
 stating that we would support the remain-
 ing half of the city.  Nuclear test ban dis-
 cussions  had  been         continuing  and  the
 United States had preserved a moratorium
 on testing, when suddenly the Soviets under-
 took a new program of testing, unprece-
 dented in scope and in size of blasts.     The
 United States did nothing.  Communist at-
 tacks in South Vietnam increased substan-
 tially and civil disorders broke out.  Despite
 warnings, the United States took no action
 to discourage a coup against the Nhu gov-
 ernment and the apparent murder of Diem
 and his brother.  Since then, the first gov-
 ernment has been overthrown, a military
 dictator replaced it, and the process of de-
 fending against Communist attacks grows
 weaker.  The United States supported the
 unprepared  African  nations  against  our
 traditional allies, jeopardized the faith of
 our allies, and released in the United Nations
 and  on the world  scene  many  countries
 wholly unprepared for self-government,
 We supported Sukarno, the militant dic-
 tator of Indonesia, in seizing Dutch-held
 property in West New Guinea.    We casti-
 gated Portugal for holding Angola and said
 nothing about India's armed invasion and
 seizure of Goa from Portugal.   We refused
 to share nuclear competence with France as
 we have with Great Britain.  We reneged on
 our agreement to supply Great Britain with
 nuclear air-to-ground missiles, and have re-
 cently tried to placate the rapacious Su-
 karno, who is slavering over newly created
 Malaysia   Panama is now physically as well
 as verbally attacking U.S. military personnel,
 Venezuelan bandits have raided U.S. military
 quarters, stripped U.S. offices, despoiled the
 U.S. flag, and even kidnaped a U.S. colonel.
 Communists led by Cubans in Zanzibar, at-
 tacked the U.S. consulate, imprisoned con-
 sulate officials, ransacked the premises, and
 as punishment get recognized by our Demo-
 crat  regime.   A  prominent  German  has
 summed. up our foreign policy activity by
 the following:
 "American foreign policy seems to be hos-
 tile to her friends, friendly to the neutrals,
 and neutral to her enemies."
 As the National magazine has said:
 "America today is going from defeat to
 defeat in almost every corner of the world."
 For 4 years Democrat foreign policy has
 been based on the principles that commu-
 nism will evolve into something with which
 we can live if we do nothing to disturb its
 leaders; that Khrushchev is the most mod-
 erate of Communists and cannot be forced
 into a corner lest we get someone worse; and
 that communism thrives amongst the poor
 and uneducated and hence can be overcome
 by scattering Yankee dollars.  Each of these
 planks have been demonstrated failures of
 self-delusions.  After 4 years of these poli-
 cies the free world is in disarray, the NATO
 Alliance is shattered at the political level,
 the last strongholds of freedom in Asia are
 tottering, and communism is on the march
 in Africa and South America.
 Our prestige about which we were so
 concerned in 1960 is now non-existent and
 every pip-squeak nation in the world is
 taking turns first kicking us around and
 then demanding foreign aid.
 It would se pm that the worst must be
 over.  To the contrary, the worst was and
 is still to come.  The floodgates of cyni-
 cism were opened when the United States,
 long the leading exponent of trade and aid
 barriers with Communist countries, wholly
 -,lost it's direction.  The wheat sales to Rus-
 sia, negotiated, directed and demanded by
 the Democrat administration,' sales. which
 are subsidized by the American taxpayers
 and with Communist credit guaranteed by
 the American taxpayers, have loosened the
 floodgates and successfully undercut  any
 and all efforts to cut off trade with our
 enemies.  Against our protests, Great Brit-
 ain has sold 400 buses to Cuba with an-
 other 600 on order; four British airliners
 are being reconditioned for delivery and
 negotiations  are  almost complete  for  de-
 livery to Castro of $1.4 million heavy road
 building machinery.  France is negotiating
 for the sale to Castro of $10 million worth
 of trucks. Spain is completing plans for the
 sale of 100 fishing, boats and two freighters.
 Italy is negotiating for an increase in sales
 and  Prime  Minister Ishibashi,  a  leading
 Japanese advocate of trade with Red China,
 has not only -been given a basis for the
 renewed trade negotiations between these
 two countries, but publicly hailed the wheat
 deal as the "'big turning point" in trade
 with Communist countries.   But the most
 serious reaction was France's opening of
 trade relations and almost immediate recog-
 nition of Red China-Red China, the most
 aggressive of all Communist nations; the
 butcher of 18 million of its own citizens,
 as well as the raper of Tibet; Red China,
 the power behind the Korean war and re-
 sponsible for the deaths of so many Ameri-
 can and free world soldiers; Red China, the
 activating agent in the Communist takeover
 of southeast Asia; Red China, the attacker
 of India, Quemoy, Matsu, Formosa, and the
 despoiler of Outer Mongolia; Red China, still
 branded as an aggressor by the United Na-
 tions;  still  preaching war  and  terror  as
 national policies; still castigating the lead-
 er of the free world;  and still preaching
 universal communism spread by force, rev-
 olution and aggression.
 It seems apparent that after the last 4
 years, American prestige is not merely low, it
 has totally disappeared; that new policies
 musj be developed and new programs in-
 stituted if we are to regain even self-respect;
 and that future problems must be foreseen
 and plans developed now.  For 4 years those
 in charge of this administration have been
 chanting the defects in our system.  These
 defects are now predominant in the minds
 of many people who do not know our country
 and our heritage.
 For 4 years, recognition of the dangers
 faced by the free world have been studiously
 avoided.   For 4 years the steady downhill
 progress of freedom has been overlooked by
 use of oratory instead of organization; pal-
 liatives instead of plans; and forensics in-
 stead of foresight.  Action is needed now if
 we are to regain self-respect, stability in for-
 eign fields, opportunity to resist Communist
 encroachments, and success in future prob-
 lems.
 This fall we will be faced with a fight over
 admission of Red China to the United Na-
 tions.   French recognition will add  great
 weight to this annual exercise and there is
 a very great chance that Red China will be
 admitted unless the United States takes def-
 inite steps: now to offset this threat. Cer-
 tainly admission of Red China to the United
 Nations would constitute a cynical disregard
 of the ideal and purpose of the organization
 and would make membership an award for
 aggression. Just recently, I was informed by
 "authoritative sources" in the State Depart-
 ment that the United States will continue its
 objection to Red China's admission, but that
 no plans had been made as to our course of
 action if our objections should be unsuc-
 cessful,

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE                March 11
 A mere outline of the situation we now
 face after the last 4 years of bumbling.
 vacillating, inefficient foreign policies Indi-
 cates clearly  that a crossroad  is directly
 ahead.  Either we change direction or we
 continue stumbling and weaving down the
 dusty road to oblivion.
 Positive programs are needed and they are
 needed now. Many have been made and
 more will be made, but I would group the
 overall need for a change under the title
 "The Will To Live."
 1. Announce a new Western Hemisphere
 doctrine specifically excluding from govern-
 mental power in this hemisphere commu-
 nism or  Marxism,  whether  Imposed from
 without or infiltrated from within.
 2. Form as rapidly as possible an English-
 speaking military and political alliance with
 announced goals in opposition to Commu-
 nist aggressions In the world.
 3. Start negotiations to create a common
 market with Canada and announce policies
 designed to  encourage Latin and South
 American common markets.
 4. Create governmentally sponsored train-
 ing courses In this country for all U.S. per-
 sonnel desiring to go into governmental for-
 eign service, emphasizing in the process the
 history,  background  and  culture of  the
 United States and the tactics of the Com-
 munist conspiracy, as well as the language,
 culture, and credo of the country to which
 each may be assigned.  The principal in-
 stitution under this program should com-
 bine the concept of a Foreign Service Acad-
 emy and the need for a Freedom Academy.
 5. Eliminateall U.S, aid and trade to Com-
 munist governments and extend trade or
 aid to the people of those countries only
 where it is managed, distributed, and or-
 ganized under direct U.S. supervision,
 6. Announce our positive intent to retain
 Guantanamo Bay  and the Panama Canal
 and the will to use such force as may be
 necessary for such purpose.
 7. Institute a quarantine of Cuba as a
 health and military menace to the world.
 8. Actively encourage the millions of free-
 dom loving people in Europe, Asia, Africa,
 and the Americas to resist communism.
 9.  Recognize that  the  economy of  this
 country is the first and strongest bulwark
 against communism and Institute trade pro-
 grams and policies which will enhance that
 economy Instead of injuring domestic In-
 dustries.
 10. Stop apologizing for the very factors
 which have made this country the greatest
 Nation on earth and make It known that we
 intend to take such steps as may be necessary
 to give people existing under  Communist
 terror the hope of living under freedom's
 banner.

 FIELD]              that the Senate proceed to con-
 sider the bill (H.R. 7152) to enforce the
 constitutional right to vote, to confer
 jurisdiction upon the district courts of
 the United States to provide injunctive
 relief against discrimination in public

 Mr. HUMPHREY.  Mr. President, I
 have consulted with some of my col-
 leagues with reference to the address
 which is about to be delivered by the
 Senator from Connecticut [Mr. DODD].
 I ask unanimous consent, despite the rule
 of germaneness, that the Senator from
 Connecticut may be permitted to speak
 for not to exceed 45 minutes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection?  The Chair hears none, and
 I t is so ordered.

 from Minnesota for his assistance.
 The  PRESIDING   OFFICER.       The
 Senator from Connecticut Is recognized.
 SOUTH  VIETNAM:  LAST  C ANCE
 FOR FREEDOM IN ASIA
 Mr. DODD.  Mr. President, if the
 American people could see 9,000 miles
 toward the Orient with the eyes of his-
 tory, they could discern a dark, funnel-
 shaped cloud spinning on the far hori-
 zon and beginning to twist across south-
 east Asia. Like a natural tornado which
 leaves in its wake ravaged terrain, shat-
 tered buildings, and twisted wreckage, so
 this political and military tornado men-
 aces the continent of Asia with ravaged
 nations, shattered peoples, and twisted
 patterns of history.
 TODAY WE ART LOSING
 The struggle to preserve South Viet-
 nam, the key to the independence of
 southeast. Asia, is at a critical peril
 point.
 Two South Vietnamese governments
 have gone down in 4 months; a third is
 suffering repeated hammer blows at the
 hands of subversion and intrigue at
 home, and counsels of despair and sur-
 render from abroad.
 This unhappy nation, in the midst of
 a mortal combat for survival, has had
 to suffer the traumatic shock of a com-
 plete turnover in leadership all the way
 from the smallest village compounds up
 to the presidential palace.
 The Communist Vietcong guerrillas,
 following the toppling of the Diem re-
 gime last October, have scored a series
 of impressive military and psychological
 gains. They now control one-half of the
 Mekong Delta, the most crucial prize.
 France has made an ignominious bid
 to return to Asia as an influential force,
 first by recognizing Red China and then
 by counseling the free world to throw
 in the towel in South Vietnam, thus
 adding appeasement to a French legacy
 in Asia which historically has been char-
 acterized by exploitation in peace, capit-
 ulation in war. and abandonment of re-
 sponsibility at the surrender table.
 Some prominent American newspapers
 support France's plea for neutralization
 and distinguished U.S. Senators are sym-
 pathetic to this proposal and publicly
 question the continuation of military
 and economic assistance there.
 Even our Defense Department added
 to the flood of contradictory official
 statements and unofficial news leaks by
 announcing a substantial withdrawal of
 American forces from South Vietnam by
 1965, notwithstanding the worsening mil-
 nary situation there and despite the in-
 ternal disintegration for which we bear
 a measure of responsibility.
 The situation, therefore, is critically
 grave.  We must assume that at this
 moment, we are losing. Only a supreme
 effort by the South Vietnamese and an
 increased effort by the United States
 will turn back the Communist tide.
 INDIFFERENCE AND DEFEATISM
 Yet, forces are at work within the free
 world whose effect is to nap our will to
 win this crucial struggle.
 A significant number of Americans,
 highly placed in private and in Gov-
 ernment circles, look upon what is hap-
 pening in South Vietnam as something
 of marginal concern to us.
 For a long time they engaged in the
 now familiar luxury of becoming all
 lathered up over the mote in the eye of
 an embattled ally while remaining se-
 renely indifferent to the beam in the
 eye of its aggressor.
 They chose for their crusade, not the
 cause of turning back Communist ag-
 gression. but the cause of destroying the
 Diem  regime,  which,  whatever  its
 faults-and they were vastly exagger-
 ated-was energetically leading the anti-
 Communist war in South Vietnam.
 They had their way.  Diem was over-
 thrown and murdered; and the result
 was a complete catastrophe, a catastro-
 phe that can be measured in terms of
 political  chaos,  military  defeat,  and
 psychological defeatism. The heralded
 attempt to liberalize and democratize the
 South Vietnam Government resulted, as
 was easily and often predicted, in gun
 barrel rule by a succession of military
 juntas, lacking even a fascade of legiti-
 macy.
 And so the anti-Diem crusaders in this
 country  and  elsewhere,  apparently
 shamed by the sorry consequences of
 their effort, but unwilling to admit their
 error, have decided that the situation is
 hopeless and that the only reasonable
 alternative left is to pull out of Vietnam
 altogether, or to make a shabby deal to
 turn this area over to the Communists
 piecemeal, a process which they call
 "neutralization."
 So I take the floor of the Senate be-
 cause I feel it is the duty of everyone
 who believes that South Vietnam must
 be preserved to counter, each in his own
 way, the attitudes of indifference and
 defeatism which threaten to paralyze our
 national policy.
 First of all then, I say that we must
 preserve the independence and freedom
 of South Vietnam for exactly the same
 reason that we must preserve the inde-
 pendence and freedom of West Berlin-
 because the cause of freedom everywhere
 in the world, and the efficacy of the
 United States as the leader of that cause,
 is squarely on the line in the Mekong
 Delta.
 Let us not join the querulous, faint-
 hearted chorus of those who always ask
 the price of victory.
 Let us ask, "What is the price of de-
 feat?"
 And having soberly assessed the price
 of defeat, let us determine upon victory,
 and then we shall find the ways to
 achieve it.

 THE  MORTAL  STAKES
 What is the price of defeat?  -  -
 What. is primarily at stake is the
 capacity of the free world to deal with a
 particular method of aggression that is
 peculiarly suitable to the Communists.
 In Korea, whatever else we failed to
 accomplish, we did prove that we -could
 .effectively deal with open, traditional
 military aggression; and we have had no
 major confrontation of that type since
 Korea.
 The Communists are now testing us
 with a different method, guerrilla war-
 fare, with its accompanying complex of
 military, psychological, and propaganda
 tactics.  Through this method, they in-
 tend to subjugate Asia, and if we prove
 unable to overcome it in Vietnam, all
 Asia is within their grasp.
 Guerrilla warfare is made to order for
 the Communists because it enables them
 to turn their weaknesses into strengths,
 while it transforms into weaknesses the
 strengths of its victims.  -
 it puts a premium upon a small in-
 vestment of men and material, upon
 stealth, terror, upon limitless patience,
 upon the avoidance of head-on con-
 frontation with basically stronger foes.
 It does not require the armament, the
 logistics and the economic support nec-
 essary for other types of combat.  And,
 so long- as we submit to its rules, it effec-
 tively prevents the forces of freedom
 from making use of their massive su-
 periority in traditional military power,
 in air and sea might, and in economic
 strength.
 It takes 20 South Vietnamese soldiers
 to deal with 1 Vietcong guerrilla.  This
 is no reflection on the South Vietnam-
 ese; it is inherent in the type of warfare,
 as proved true in previous guerrilla con-
 flicts in the Philippines and in Malaya.
 And - so the North Vietnamese and
 their Red Chinese backers, stricken with
 poverty, hunger, economic collapse, and
 demoralization at home, through the
 relatively inexpensive device of field-
 ing 20,000 or 30,000 guerrilla soldiers,
 lightly equipped and able to live off the
 land, can successfully maintain a war of
 deadly attrition against a nation su-
 perior in every respect and backed by
 the wealth and power and training of
 the United States.
 They can tie down an army of 400,000
 South Vietnamese, half regular soldiers
 and half militia.  They can engage in
 this riskless warfare indefinitely with-
 out jeopardizing their own home base
 because, up to now, free nations have
 not treated guerrilla invasion as a kind
 of war which merits retaliation on the
 homeland of the aggressor.
 Guerrilla warfare enables the Com-
 munists, through prolonged terror to
 gradually destroy the will to resist of the
 peoples it invades.
 it has enabled them to assassinate
 1,000 local South Vietnamese officials
 each month for sustained periods of
 time.
 It has destroyed communications and
 transportation  in large areas of the
 country.
 It has forced a whole population to
 live in thousands of barbed wire en-
 tangled encampments, in constant fear.
 It places terrible pressures upon any
 government, and upon the very conduct
 of civilized life and thus, if unchecked,
 threatens with inevitable demoraliza-
 tion the whole fabric of the attacked
 society.
 If the United States cannot deal with
 this method of aggression in South Viet-
 nam, where we have invested so much
 in terms of aid and training, where we
 have developed and equipped an indi-
 genous army with great possibilities and
 where, therefore, our entire credibility
 is.at stake; if we cannot successfully as-
 sist the South Vietnamese to turn back a
 relatively puny enemy weakened by
 famine, discontent, and economic col-
 lapse, is there apy reason to hope that
 we can succeed in the other countries of
 Asia?
 On the contrary, if South Vietnam
 falls to guerrilla warfare as North Viet-
 nam did, it is inescapable that the pre-
 dictions of President Eisenhower and
 President Kennedy will be borne out and
 that the nations of Asia will fall to
 communism like a string of dominoes.
 There are those who scoff at what is
 called the domino theory.  I do not
 think it is anything to be scoffed at.
 This theory was one of the strong ideas
 behind the NATO Alliance.  We recog-
 nized that if one European country fell
 at a time, they would fall in just that
 fashion, like dominoes. I think it is even
 more true in Asia.
 If South Vietnam is yielded to the
 Communists, Laos and Cambodia, al-
 ready with one foot in the grave, are
 automatically doomed.     -
 Thailand, comparatively helpless, with
 its 1,000 miles of frontier adjoining Laos
 and Cambodia, will then be immediately
 imperiled.
 If 'Thailand goes down, nothing can
 save Malaya and Singapore.  When
 Malaya has been subjugated, Indonesia,
 with its huge Communist movement, will
 be a pushover.
 With communism thus solidly en-
 trenched in the Pacific all the way from
 the Arctic Circle to Indonesia, the de-
 fense of Australia and New Zealand, even
 with Anglo-American -naval assistance,
 would become hazardous and extremely
 difficult.
 Inevitably  the  Philippines,  South
 Korea, Japan, and Formosa will be swept
 into the maelstrom and the whole Pacific
 will indeed become a Red ocean.
 And this is only part of the cost of
 defeat in South Vietnam. The freedom
 of half the world is dependent upon al-
 liances which are based upon confidence
 in the capacity of the United States to
 stand up effectively to Communist ag-
 gression, What would be the posture of
 the United States if we permit ourselves
 to preside impotently over such catastro-
 phes?
 Three Presidents of the United States
 have committed us to the defense and
 assistance of South Vietnam.  If we do
 not have the will and the capacity to
 carry out that relatively modest commit-
 ment, why should anyone have confi-
 dence in us?  And why should we have
 confidence in ourselves?
 More than two decades ago, immedi-
 ately following the Japanese attack upon
 the United States and Great Britain,
 Winston Churchill said to the Congress
 of the United States:
 What kind of a people do they think we
 are?  Is it possible that they do not under-
 stand that we shall never, cease to persevere
 against them until they have been taught a
 lesson which they and the world shall never
 forget?
 The Congress rose in a mighty ovation
 to those words, representing the unani-
 mous determination of the American
 people.
 Surely we are today opposed by a
 threat in Asia which, if less spectacular,
 is equally grave.  And surely, once we
 understand this, our determination will
 be equal to whatever we are called upon
 to risk and endure.
 NEUTRALIZATION
 There are those who agree openly that
 the consequences of a Communist vic-
 tory in South Vietnam would be disas-
 trous, but maintain that the solution is
 "neutralization" of the contested area.
 Even in its most charitable interpreta-
 tion, neutralization is a philosophic mon-
 strosity.
 Heretofore, our concept of collective
 security has been that if an independent
 nation were attacked by- the Commu-
 nists, the concert of free nations would
 assist that nation to defend itself. Now
 it is contended that the nation which is
 attacked must be disarmed, must have
 some sort of coalition government im-
 posed upon it from without, and must
 have its future existence entrusted to
 some sort of international supervisory
 body, over which its enemies exercise a
 veto power. What is to be done with the
 aggressor state which attacked the non-
 aggressor nation has never been made
 clear.
 The only practical experience we have
 had with this strange concept is in Laos,
 where the Communists have used it as
 a cover under which they have contin-
 ued their piecemeal subjugation.  The
 protective devices that were supposed to
 maintain peace in this area have proven,
 as was-predicted, absolute nullities.
 However, there is another variety of
 neutralization with which we do have
 long practical experience.  When there
 is an internal struggle going on within
 a nation between the forces of commu-
 nism and liberty, the neutralization
 concept is applied in the form of a coali-
 tion government in which both Commu-
 nists and non-Communists divide the
 cabinet posts.  We have assisted or
 acquiesced in the establishment of many
 such  governments,  With  uniformly
 tragic results:  Through this Rumania,
 Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czechoslo-
 vakia, and Yugoslavia have been totally
 enslaved by the Communists.       -
 China was lost in part because during
 the- very period when the Nationalist
 Government could have taken firm con-
 trol of China it was immobilized and
 demoralized for a protracted period of
 time while we sought to impose upon
 mainland China a- neutralized coalition
 government made up of Communists
 and non-Communists.        -

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                Mar64 11
 Mr. HUMPHREY.  I wish to empha-
 size the point the Senator from Con-
 necticut has made in regard to so-called
 coalition governments, in which Com-
 munist        representatives  are  included,
 supposedly in an effort to ease them off,
 so to speak, from their campaign of sub-
 version and terror.       Certainly that does
 not work; the Senator from Connecticut
 is absolutely correct.  We have learned
 from the cruel facts of history that
 either the Communists or the Fascists
 will turn any cabinet in which they are a
 part to their own use, and ultimately to
 the destruction of democratic institu-
 tions.       That was the record of Hitler in
 Germany, and it has been the record of
 every so-called Socialist-Democrat re-
 gime which included Communist repre-
 sentatives, and including the experience
 in Czechoslovakia.  If Communists are
 placed in a cabinet, the Communists in-
 sist on having the posts at the head of
 the ministry of interior, the ministry of
 labor. or the ministry of transport.
 Mr. DODD.  Or the ministry of in-
 formation.
 Mr.  HUMPHREY.  Yes;  and  that
 means that if they hold those posts. they
 can control the secret police and the
 communications and the labor move-
 ment.         When the Communists obtain
 control, as a result of having control of
 those three posts, the record shows that
 they take over.
 Regardless of one's views on South
 Vietnam or on any other part of the
 world, it is a fact that there is no safety
 in a coalition government; it means slow
 death, and nothing else.
 I thank the Senator from Connecticut
 for emphasizing this point.
 Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator from
 Minnesota.  His words of approval give
 me great comfort and encouragement.
 It is difficult to discuss neutralization
 in the context of southeast Asia, because
 of the vagueness with which the proposi-
 tion is advanced; but let us try to do so,
 nonetheless.
 If neutralization of the currqnt con-
 flict means that both North Vietnam and
 South Vietnam should be disarmed and
 placed under some kind of international
 supervision which effectively removes
 both from the cold war, then it is futile
 and absurb even to discuss it.
 It is futile and absurb, because the
 Communists reject it utterly, openly,
 and contemptuously, both as an abstract
 concept and as a practical solution to
 any conflict in which they are involved.
 They have specifically and violently
 condemned it as a solution to the cur-
 rent conflict in Vietnam.
 True neutralization can thus be dis-
 missed; it has never been a possibility.
 Only false neutralization has any chance
 of being considered.
 Under  false  neutralization,  South
 Vietnam would be disarmed, given a half-
 Communist government probably, and
 placed under the so-called protection of
 some international body which has no
 substance, and exists only on paper.
 The victim of aggression, not the_ag-
 gressor, is to be neutralized; and this
 neutralization serves only to delay for a
 short time complete Communist enslave-
 ment.
 So let us be candid about neutraliza-
 tion.  If we use the term, let us define
 what we mean by it.
 If we mean that both the Communist
 aggressor and its victim are to neutral-
 ized-and even this would be an injustice
 on the face of 4t, since it treats equally
 the aggressor and the victim-let us
 immediately dismiss it until we receive
 some indication that the Communists
 have totally abandoned their philosophy
 and their tactics and are willing to enter-
 tain a suggestion so contrary to their
 doctrine and their history.
 The above situation would be similar
 to that of a quarrel between two men,
 in which one of them was entirely inno-
 cent and had not been doing any wrong;
 if, when he was attacked by a hoodlum,
 the police rushed up and said, "We are
 going to punish both of you"-obviously
 an injustice.
 And if we mean by neutralization that
 only the victim of aggression is to be
 neutralized, let us call this term what it
 is--a dishonest substitute for uncondi-
 tional surrender.
 Mr. SALTONSTALL.  Mr. President,
 will the Senator from Connecticut yield
 briefly to me?
 Mr. DODD.  I yield.
 Mr.  SALTONSTALL. I  appreciate
 very much the senator's comment. It
 is so important that I believe it should
 be repeated; and, with the permission of
 the Senator from Connecticut, I shall do
 so now:
 And if we mean by neutralization that
 only the victim of aggression is to be neu-
 tralized, let ps call this term what it is-a
 dishonest substitute for unconditional sur-
 render.
 That is what neutralization in South
 Vietnam would do at the present time,
 would it not?
 Mr. DODD.  It, most certainly would.
 I am happy that the distinguished Sen-
 ator from Massachusetts has risen to
 call our attention to that point.
 Mr. ERVIN.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield for a question?
 Mr. DODD.   I am happy to yield to
 the distinguished Senator from North
 Carolina.
 Mr. ERVIN.  Many years ago I read
 a statement to the effect that even the
 best of men cannot have peace unless
 their wicked neighbors are willing to
 permit them to do so. Is it not true that
 up to the present moment the neutraliza-
 tion of a country has resulted, in a
 sense, in denying that country the power
 to defend itself, making it subject to the
 will of its wicked neighbors?
 Mr. DODD.  In every case. There has
 been no exception. The most recent has
 been the case of Laos.  That has been
 the rule in so-called neutralization.
 Secretary Rusk recently made an ex-
 cellent  statement  on                                                        neutralization
 which put it in its proper perspective.
 I applaud, also, the repeated rejec-
 tions of neutralization by both Presi-
 dent Kennedy and President Johnson.
 The only ends served by treating neu-
 tralization as a possibility are to hearten
 our enemies and dismay and demoralize
 our friends.
 THE KEY TO VICTORY
 Over and over again we hear it said
 that the key to victory is the morale of
 the South Vietnamese people; their be-
 lief in their way of life; their willingness
 to stand up and fight for ii.
 This is a vast oversimplification.  Ob-
 viously, the morale of a people under
 attack is a very important element. But
 in this war, in which South Vietnam is.
 actually a battleground between the
 Communist world and the free world, the
 morale of the people should not be the
 key to victory or defeat.
 The real key is our capacity to respond
 effectively to the methoc: of guerrilla
 warfare, supplied and directed from the
 privileged sanctuary of North Vietnam.
 Were it not for this onesided methodof
 warfare which gives all the initiative to
 the enemy, which permits hardened
 guerrilla soldiers to terrorize an entire
 people for years on end, to turn a whole
 nation into a series of barbed wire en-
 campments-were it not for all this, the
 durability  of  the  South Vietnamese
 would not even be in question.
 Armies exist for the purpose of saving
 civilian populations from l: aving to fight.
 it is the failure to deal effectively with
 the military threat that makes the mor-
 ale and courage of the people a vital ele-
 ment in the war.
 Let us be frank. Let us ask ourselves
 how our own people would stand up in
 such a contest if they were subjected to
 ceaseless attack year in and year out,
 from which their own army seemed pow-
 erless to protect them.
 Does anyone suppose that under the
 same conditions the people of North Viet-
 nam would fight to protect their status?
 Of course not.  But that does not pre-
 vent their enslavers from successfully
 carrying  forward  aggression  against
 their neighbors.
 Our task is to change the nature of
 this conflict.
 if we continue to perirdt the war in
 South Vietnam to be, in considerable
 measure, a contest between professional
 guerrillas against helpless civilians, most
 certainly we are in grave danger of los-
 ing.  But what a monumental abdica-
 tion of responsibility it would be to at-
 tribute our defeat, if we suffer such, not
 to our own unwillingness to change the
 terms of battle, but to the morale of
 the people whom we are asking to live
 in constant danger by day and by night
 for a period that is apparently to have
 no end.
 Those who are entrusted with the re-
 sponsibility for the defense of South
 Vietnam can reverse this situation al-
 most overnight by carrying the struggle
 to its source: North Vietnam.
 The key to victory in South Vietnam
 is the effective carrying of the war into
 North Vietnam until the forces of Ho
 Chi Minh have sustainer; such terrible
 attrition that they cease their aggres-
 sion against the South.  How can it be
 done?

 push on in Vietnam-as I do-have as
 much information at our disposal and
 as much occasion for speaking up as
 those who believe we should pull out.
 One does not have to be an architect
 to know that a house is falling down,
 and one does not have to be a military
 expert or a foreign service officer to
 know that our military and political ef-
 fort in South Vietnam is going badly
 and that the course of our efforts must
 be changed if we are to succeed.
 Our first task is to stabilize the rapid-
 ly                deteriorating  political situation  in
 South Vietnam.   There are a number of
 ways in which we can help to bring this
 about and I shall cite only three:
 First, we must make clear our irrevo-
 cable determination to see this struggle
 through to victory, as long as the South
 Vietnamese carry their part of the bur-
 den.
 President Johnson's statement of Feb-
 ruary 21, and subsequent statements
 contained just such a commitment and
 have helped a great deal to stem the
 confusion and demoralization resulting
 from statements by other Americans.
 Secretary McNamara's clear assertions
 have had a good effect.
 On the radio this morning I heard a
 report of a speech by Secretary McNa-
 mara in which he told the people in Viet-
 nam that we would render whatever aid
 was necessary for as long as it was nec-
 essary. I say, good for him.
 There must be other statements by the
 President and by other top American
 leaders.
 There should be statements in the
 Congress, perhaps congressional resolu-
 tions.
 There should be pledges by leaders of
 both parties, until our posture with re-
 spect to South Vietnam is as clear as our
 posture concerning West Berlin.
 Second, we should help the present
 Government of south Vietnam, under
 General Khanh, to ride out its present
 difficulties.  We have no choice but to
 support this Government as it is, with
 its strengths and its weaknesses.
 In doing so, we must seek to help it
 overcome its shortcomings, through per-
 suasion and example, not only for the
 immediate purpose of strengthening its
 ,resistance to communism, but so that it
 may ultimately become a beacon of jus-
 tice and progress for all the peoples of
 southeast Asia.
 General Khanh is probably as good a
 man as can be found in the Vietnamese
 armed forces, and we may count our-
 selves fortunate that the second coup
 was not instigated by a man of less stat-
 ure.                    He has a reputation as a capable
 and aggressive commander and as a care-
 ful planner.
 According to all the reports I have
 heard, he is also a man of integrity and
 strong personal loyalty.  He has dis-
 played sound political instinct in re-
 taining the popular Gen. Duong Van
 Minh as Chief of State and in bringing
 certain prominent political leaders and
 intellectuals into his Cabinet; while his
 energetic visiting to villages and to sol-
 diers at the front suggests that Vietnam
 may at last have found the benevolent
 strong man it so sorely needs.  His ini-
 tial pronouncements, moreover, suggest
 that he recognizes the imperative need
 for constructive village programs if the
 people's loyalty is to be won and re-
 tained.
 Instead of standing on the sidelines,
 waiting to see how General Khanh will
 shape up, we must do everything in our
 power to help the government of General
 Khanh stabilize itself and to help the
 general himself develop the popular im-
 age that is essential to effective national
 government.
 We must make it unmistakably clear
 to the other officers in the Vietnamese
 Army that we are opposed to any more
 coups and that we shall support the Gov-
 ernment against any attempted coup.
 This is mandatory because another coup
 or two and even the Marines will be un-
 able to save South Vietnam.  Secretary
 McNamara has performed admirably in
 this regard during his visit.
 Third, we must use our influence and
 our aid to assist the new Vietnam Gov-
 ernment to build upon a beginning that
 has already been made in encouraging
 the development of village democracy;
 in improving agriculture, education, and
 public health; and in giving the Viet-
 namese people the feeling that they have
 something to fight for and something
 worth daily risking their lives for. The
 plan announced by General Khanh last
 Saturday,  if  properly  implemented
 through our aid, will mark a significant
 step forward.
 We must help turn the war against
 North Vietnam.
 We must explain to our own people, to
 our allies, and to the world the reasons
 which impel us to carry the fighting to
 the home base of the aggressor.
 One method of doing this would be
 the publication of a white paper on
 North Vietnamese and Red Chinese ag-
 gression in South Vietnam, setting forth
 in detail all the massive information
 that has been accumulated about guer-
 rilla infiltration and the smuggling of
 arms from the North, the evidence that
 the war is in fact directed from the
 North, and the evidence of Red Chinese
 involvement.
 We have the truth; and we have the
 means to disseminate the truth to all
 who are disposed to believe it.  Having
 made this attempt to solicit favorable
 world opinion, we must go forward and
 do what the facts of the situation re-
 quire of us.
 We now come to the critical point of
 our policy.  What should be the nature
 of our attempt to take the offensive in
 this war which has been forced upon
 South Vietnam from the North?
 It is, of course, for our military lead-
 ers to decide upon the tactics and for
 our diplomatic leaders to assess the pos-
 sible repercussions.
 But it is the direction of our efforts,
 not the details, that is my principal
 concern.
 As a minimum, I believe we must per-
 mit, train, and assist South Vietnamese
 guerrilla forces to begin hit-and-run
 raids along the coast of North Vietnam,
 directed against targets like marshaling
 yards, harbor facilities, refineries, fac-
 tories, bridges, dams, and so on. As ex-
 perience and confidence are gained, it
 should be our goal to assist the South
 Vietnamese to open up sustained guer-
 rilla operations in North Vietnam and
 give the Communists a full taste of their
 own medicine.
 Every day that this war continues, the
 Red regime in Hanoi should be hurt in
 a very material way.  And every day
 that we allow them to ravage South Viet-
 nam with complete impunity to their
 home base, we give them an advantage
 which they should not have and which
 could be decisive in the war.
 That is the minimum.
 The   maximum   operation   against
 North Vietnam would be to build up
 South Vietnamese air and sea forces so
 that  they could  launch  air strikes
 against industrial and military targets
 and conduct naval blockades against
 commerce.
 We have all read that this alternative
 is under serious consideration by the
 administration.  We know that action
 of this kind would be a very bold step
 and that there are many reasons why
 any administration would be reluctant
 to undertake it. But if it is necessary
 it should be done, and I believe that the
 Congress and the American people will
 support this action if .our best advice
 tells us that it is the quickest and most
 effective way to end the agony of South
 Vietnam and redeem our commitments
 in southeast Asia.
 Three years ago, upon my return from
 Laos and South Vietnam, I urged that we
 ,not continue a purely defensive war but
 that we enable the forces of freedom to
 go over to the offensive.  I stated the
 objectives of such an approach in words
 which I should like to repeat now:
 The best way for us to stop communist
 guerrilla action in Laos and in South Viet-
 nam is to send guerrillas in force into North
 Vietnam, to equip and supply those patriots
 already in the field;  to make every CoTn-
 munist official fear the just retribution of
 an outraged humanity; to make every Com-
 munist arsenal, government building, com-
 munications center and transportation fa-
 cility a target for  sabotage;  to provide a
 rallying point for the great masses of op-
 pressed people who hate communism because
 they have known it.
 Only when we give the Communists more
 trouble than they can handle at home, will
 they cease their aggression against the out-
 posts of freedom.
 I think these words are even more
 applicable today than they were when I
 first spoke them 3 years ago.
 Finally, I believe that we should make
 an effort to involve the other nations of
 the area in the task of keeping South
 Vietnam free.
 As late as April of 1961, the SEATO
 nations in the immediate area, the Phil-
 ippines, Thailand, Australia, New Zea-
 land, and Pakistan, all favored common
 action against the Communist menace in
 Laos. But the British and French were
 opposed to such action, and we ourselves
 set on the fence; and the result was that
 nothing was done.
 In the absence of American leadership,
 SEATO has inevitably become an orga-
 nization of questionable effectiveness.
 When I was in the Philippines in May of
 1961, Foreign Minister Serano made a

 statement to me which I shall never for-
 get.        "We are prepared to fight and die
 with you if necessary," he said, "but we
 cannot fight without American leader-
 ship."  Our failure to react to the chal-
 lenge in Laos is one of the chief reasons
 for Pakistan's loss of confidence and her
 consequent erratic behavior.
 Given American leadership and given
 the evidence of our determination to de-
 fend southeast Asia, it is not too much
 to hope that SEATO can be reactivated.
 Certainly it would be salutary and help-
 ful to have other Asians fighting along-
 side the South Vietnamese and Laotians,
 in defense of their common freedom.
 Conceivably, France might object to the
 reactivation of SEATO, now that De
 Gaulle  seems bent on the appeasement
 of Mao Tse-Tung. But if France should
 take this stand, then in my opinion she
 no longer belongs in SEATO. and we
 should ask for her withdrawal.
 THE CONTINUING CRISIS
 In South Vietnam, as at so many other
 pressure points around the globe, the
 American people are being tested as nev-
 er before, and as no other people have
 been tested.
 In the past our Nation, like other na-
 tions, has risen to direct challenges which
 brought us under open attack and which
 clearly imperiled our survival.
 In such conflicts our danger was ob-
 vious, our objective was clear, and our
 people could throw themselves into a
 total national effort with confidence that
 our sacrifices were only temporary and
 that total victory was attainable and
 foreseeable.
 Such have been the challenges of the
 past.  But the current crisis Is not a
 clear military challenge emanating from
 definite sources. combatable by tradi-
 tional means,  and  subject  to  total
 retaliation.
 We are challenged on every continent,
 in every country, by every means, but
 not directly, not overtly. It is always
 some other nation that is under direct
 attack, and the attack comes disguised
 in many forms, subversion, infiltration,
 revolution, espionage, propaganda, psy-
 chological warfare, economic warfare,
 guerrilla warfare, and on and on-war
 without form, war without limitation,
 war without end.
 It has fallen to us to lead the defense
 of freedom against this omnipresent but
 illusory onslaught.  And we have under-
 taken to do so, for our own sake, and for
 the larger cause of humanity.  That we
 have often failed in individual instances
 is to be grievously regretted; that we
 have tried, that we have attempted to
 mount a many dimensioned global de-
 fense equal to the challenge, is to our
 eternal credit.
 Our sons at this hour are stationed in
 military bases in the farthest and most
 remote corners of the earth.  Our aid
 missions and Peace Corps units and tech-
 nical assistance teams are functioning in
 fourscore nations and more.   Our in-
 formation programs seeking to combat
 falsehood  with  truth  are  operating
 around the globe.  In outer space, in the
 air, on the land, on the sea, and under
 the sea we have mounted a tireless de-
 fense against the ultimate enemy attack.
 a defense for ourselves and for all people.
 The struggle in South Vietnam Is a
 crucial part of this larger struggle; per-
 haps the most vital part at the moment
 because it is the most challenged at the
 moment.
 In the normal course of my duties as
 a Senator. I have had the privilege of
 visiting and talking with our American
 soldiers in South Vietnam just as I have
 had similarly rewarding experiences in
 meeting the young men who man our
 Polaris fleet, and those who go out into
 outer space in an attempt to insure our
 predominance  even  In  that  remote
 sphere.
 It is hl pondering the sacrifices and
 achievements of these men and in con-
 fronting  the                                                         challenges which  have
 caused them to undertake these tasks
 that we begin to grasp something of the
 meaning of being an American In this
 sixth decade of the twentieth century.
 In the early years of our Nation Ben-
 jamin Franklin and Thomas Paine had
 an exchange which prophetically out-
 lined the course of our history and ex-
 plained our present posture in the world
 today.  Franklin said, "Wherever free-
 dom is, that is my country."  Paine re-
 sponded, "Wherever freedom is not, that
 is my country."
 This seeming contradiction has been
 harmonized by the development of our
 history.  There is no free nation which
 has not had the active and continuing
 assistance of the United States in the
 effort to fulfill and defend Its liberty.
 There is no free nation under attack
 today whose survival is not dependent
 upon this American involvement. There
 is no enslaved nation whose hope for
 ultimate freedom does not rest with us.
 Americans of our day realize more
 completely even than did Franklin and
 Paine the indivisibility of freedom.  To
 preserve our own freedom we must see to
 it that the South Vietnamese preserve
 theirs.  That is why we are there. That
 is why we must continue there until vic-
 tory is assured.
 And that is why Americans of this
 decade, like their predecessors, are earn-
 ing a place in history which, In Lincoln's
 words, "the world will forever applaud
 and God will forever bless."
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to insert at this point in the RECORD
 a statement I prepared early in Febru-
 ary for the February 17 issue of the
 Washington Report of the American Se-
 curity Council.
 There being no objection, the state-
 ment was ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 [From Washington Report, Feb. 17, 19641
 FORMULA FOR VICTORY IN VIETNAM
 We are rapidly approaching the moment
 of truth in southeast Asia.  The events of
 the coming year will, In all probability, de-
 cide whether freedom has any future In this
 strategically vital area, or whether the few
 free flags that stilt wave there will all be
 replaced by the hammer and sickle.
 If we minimize the gravity of the situa-
 tion, if we continue to engage in half-meas-
 ures, if we permit the Communists to oper-
 ate from privileged sanctuaries, if we again
 permit ourselves to become involved in plots
 against our  allies, then scutheast Asia is
 doomed.
 I believe southeast Asia can be saved.  But
 it can be saved only if we are prepared to face
 up to the facts in all their gravity and ugli-
 ness and act with the utm)st resoluteness.
 There are those who say that the United
 States Is overextended, that. we cannot de-
 fend Asia as well as Europe, ghat we must re-
 duce our commitments in southeast Asia,
 even though this might result in a Commu-
 nist takeover.  I find this proposal as lacking
 In logic as it is In morality.
 For better or for worse.  our own fate is
 intertwined with that of southeast Asia.  In-
 deed, the Communist conquest of the area
 would produce so serious a shift in the world
 balance of power. that our very ability to
 survive would be called into question.  More-
 over, our prestige is so heavily committed
 In South Vietnam that if we accept defeat
 there, or if we accept defeat, on the install-
 ment plan under the name of neutraliza-
 tion, no nation could In the future place any
 confidence in America's commitment to its
 defense.
 The gravity of the situation in southeast
 Asia and the continuing downward spiral of
 our fortunes there simply do not jibe with
 the optimistic reassurances of the Depart-
 ment of State.
 In Laos, the hard-pressed royalists, now
 supported by the neutralist. forces of Gen.
 Kong Le. have been forced back from one
 position after another by a aeries of limited
 but  carefully calculated  offensive actions,
 initiated by the Pathet Lao forces of Prince
 Souphannavong.  The coalition government
 triumphantly put together by Mr. Harriman,
 for  all  practical purposes  does not exist.
 The Americans have withdrawn from Laos,
 the North Vietnamese have not.  The tripar-
 tite supervisory committee has been able to
 operate In the non-Communist portions of
 the country; but it has not been able to in-
 spect those areas under Communist control,
 sometimes because of the obstruction of the
 Polish member of the committee, more fre-
 quently simply because they have been de-
 nied access by the Pathet Lao.
 In Cambodia, Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
 himself an anti-Communist, has sadly ac-
 cepted the inevitability of Communist rule
 throughout Asia, and has severed relations
 with Britain and America and terminated
 their assistance programs.  He has been re-
 markably frank In stating that his only pur-
 pose In doing so is to buy it bit more time
 for himself and his people. There is mount-
 ing evidence that the Vietcong has been us-
 ing his territory for hit-and-run attacks on
 South Vietnam.
 In Vietnam, the war has been going dis-
 astrously for our side ever since the over-
 throw of the Diem government last Novem-
 ber 1.  The military junta which overthrew
 President  Diem  has,  In  tern,  been over-
 thrown, and no one can tell where the dam-
 age done  to the political stability of the
 country will end.
 Internationally, our position has been un-
 dermined by the decision of President De
 Gaulle to recognize Red China.  Perhaps the
 most single  serious  consequence    of  De
 Gaulle's  action  is that it may  induce a
 weakening of U.S. policy by emboldening
 these elements in the Department of State
 who have always believed that the way out
 of the southeast Asia crisis lies via coalition
 governments and neutralization and disen-
 gagement.  Already some of our pundits and
 editors are saying that If a brave and stanch
 anti-Communist like De Ga'alle accepts the
 inevitability of the recognition of Red China
 and the neutralization of southeast Asia, we
 might do well to heed his example.  Almost
 without exception, these pundits are opposed
 to all those things De Gaulle has stood for
 In Europe.   But they do not hesitate to

 invoke the authority of his name in pressing
 for appeasement in southeast Asia.
 We shall hear more such opinions and
 witnesses more such pressures over the. com-
 ing months.
 Against this otherwise bleak background,
 there is at least one faintly hopeful ray.
 The new government of General Khanh, al-
 though it has still not been able to repair
 the damage done to the apparatus of admin-
 istration and command by the overthrow of
 Diem, appears to be a definite improvement
 over the first junta.  General Khanh has a
 reputation as a resourceful and courageous
 commander; and as a careful planner; and it
 was impossible not to be impressed by the
 swiftness and smoothness with which he
 executed his coup.     All the news indicates
 that he has taken power firmly into his own
 hands and that he is shaping up as the wise
 and benevolent strong man his country so
 desperately needs.  General Khanh's reputa-
 tion forVersonal loyalty should be a definite
 asset, in his relations with his fellow officers
 and in his relations with us.
 He has shown his political astuteness in
 retaining the popular Gen. Duong Van Minh
 as head of state.   Although the generals
 guilty of plotting with the French have been
 imprisoned, there has been none of the
 wholesale dismissals and reshuffling of com-
 mands that characterized the military junta.
 And whereas the junta had been foolish
 enough to give all key posts to the so-called
 southerners,  General  Khanh,  himself  a
 northerner, has wisely distributed his posts
 between people coming from the north,
 south, and center.
 To add to all this, Khanh seems to have
 the political instinct and gregariousness of
 an American. presidential candidate, and an
 ability to move from one point to another
 on the fighting fronts that reminds one of
 the way Mayor La Guardia played the role
 of inspector-general in New York.  In short,
 everything about Khanh looks good.  In him
 Vietnam may well have found a man capable
 of unifying and leading its diverse peoples.
 Let us hope that we will give him our un-
 stinting support, that we will do our utmost
 to help him develop the national image es-
 sential to the task of leadership, that we
 will let it be known that we stand by this
 government, and that we will use all our
 influence to discourage any new plots or
 coups.  For the fact is that Vietnam cannot
 afford more coups..  Another two or three
 coups and even the American marines would
 not be able to save South Vietnam.
 The firming up of the Khanh government
 is the first task in any formula for saving
 southeast Asia.  In helping to firm it up, I
 hope we will not insist on a dilution of au-
 thority, in the name of democracy, because
 no civil war can be successfully prosecuted
 without a strong government.
 Second, it is essential that we let the world
 know in unequivocal terms that we will not
 abandon southeast Asia, that there will be
 no neutralization of Vietnam, and that we
 will have no part of a conference to neutral-
 ize Cambodia.
 Third, by way of preparing the ground for
 a political and military counteroffensive, the
 Government of South Vietnam should be en-
 couraged to bring out a white paper incor-
 porating all the massive evidence that the
 Vietcong guerrilla war is not of indigenous
 origin, but has beery planned, armed, orga-
 nized, and led. by the agents of Ho Chi Minh,
 Similary, the anti-Communist elements in
 the Laotian coalition shoul4l be encouraged
 to prepare a white paper detailing the re-
 peated violations of the cease-fire and of the
 terms of the Geneva Treaty by the Pathet
 Lao and the evidence of the continuing pres-
 ence of North Vietnamese forces in Laos.
 Fourth, having given these facts to world
 opinion, we should then unleash the South
 Vietnamese and put an end to the one-
 sided set of rules under which the war in
 South Vietnam has heretofore  been  con-
 ducted.  Up until now, the war' has been
 fought entirely on the territory of South
 Vietnam. The South Vietnamese Army has
 had  to spread its. forces thin to protect
 bridges and railways and powerplants and
 other installations against territory attacks.
 The North Vietnamese have operated under
 no such penalty.  Not a week goes by with-
 out the murder of several hundred South
 Vietnamese  village  leaders  and  local  of-
 ficials by the Vietcong.  But the political
 commissars in the North have been able to
 carry out their work of political control and
 repression in absolute safety.
 The situation in Vietnam,  indeed, pro-
 vides a classic example of our tacit accept-
 ante of the Communist ground rule that
 the cold war and hot wars, both, must always
 be fought on the territory of the free world
 and never on the territory of the Communist
 world.
 We must put an end to this imbalanced
 situation.  Ho Chi Minh must be made to
 pay a penalty for his aggression in the south.
 Sustained guerrilla warfare may be difficult
 to conduct in a country under the iron con-
 trol of the Communists.  But North Viet-
 naiv, because of its long coastline, is exceed-
 ingly vulnerable to hit-and-run raids from
 the sea.  The minute the South Vietnamese
 are given the green light to mount such
 raids,  the minute they start blowing  up
 bridges, and dams and generators and fac-
 tories in the north and ambushing patrols
 and political commissars,  it will have an
 immediate impact on the conduct of the war
 in the south.
 Fifth, He Chi Minh conducts his activities
 in the south under the ostensible auspices
 of a front for the liberation of South Viet-
 nam, which maintains representatives in 15
 countries.  There  are  capable  and  deter-
 mined men among the refugees and defec-
 tors from the north who would like nothing
 better than to be granted permission to set
 up a front for the liberation of North Viet-
 nam from the tyranny of communism.                                                                                  We
 must encourage, not inhibit, the creation
 of such a front, committed to a program of
 liberation and social reform and we must
 provide it with the necessary propaganda
 facilities..
 Sixth, it can be taken for granted that the
 Communists will again attack in Laos.  We
 must respond to the next attack by an-
 nouncing that we consider the Geneva agree-
 ment to be abrogated, by encouraging Gen-
 eral Phoumi and Gen. Kong Le to coun-
 terattack, and by giving them the necessary
 support.  We should make it our strategic
 objective to  assist  the  anti-Communist
 forces in securing at least the southern half
 of the country, including the Laotian pan-
 handle through which the He Chi Minh is
 infilterating men and supplies into South
 Vietnam.  No measure we could take would
 do more to take the pressure off South Viet-
 nam  or would have greater psychological
 impact throughout Southeast Asia than the
 liberation of Tchepone, the chief Communist
 base in the panhandle.
 Senator TriONuAS J. Donn,
 Guest Editor.
 Mr. SALTONSTALL.                   Mr. President,
 will the Senator yield?
 Mr. DODD. I yield.
 Mr. SALTONSTALL. I am grateful to
 the Senator for making so clear our re-
 sponsibilities in the cause of ' freedom.
 We have a -real cause today for which to
 work and to fight, in assisting the South
 Vietnamese in the Far East.
 Yesterday, we listened to a speech on
 the floor of the Senate by another dis-
 tinguished Senator, who took a contrary
 position to the one the Senator from
 Connecticut has taken today.
 Mr. DODD. Yes.
 Mr. SALTONSTALL. I personally be-
 lieve that we should help them in every
 way we can so long as we are advancing
 the cause of freedom by doing so.
 While the Senator feels at the present
 time that we have this cause, and that
 we should go forward with it, ultimately
 we must make decisions that may have to
 be changed because the situation changes
 and new factors of the different facts in-
 volved are introduced. Our role in South
 Vietnam is related, not only to our rela-
 tionships with the South Vietnamese
 but also with other countries in the Far
 East and in the world, where our pres-
 tige may be involved. Does the Senator
 feel that that is a correct interpretation
 of the remarks he has made?
 Mr. DODD. Exactly so
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time
 of the Senator from Connecticut has ex-
 pired.
 Mr. HUMPHREY.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that the Senator
 from Connecticut may proceed for an
 additional 15 minutes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator from Connecticut is recognized for
 15 additional minutes.
 Mr. DODD.  I believe we are faced
 with a situation in which we have no al-
 ternative.  My view Is that if we should
 back out, or give up in South Vietnam,
 all of Asia ultimately would be lost; and
 I do not believe that fateful day would
 be too far away.  That Is, of course, of
 the gravest importance.
 But besides that, I believe the rest of
 the world would lose confidence in us.
 Whether we like it or not, we are the
 leaders of the free world. I believe it is
 true, as I have tried to say that there is
 not a free country in the world that we
 have not helped.  There is not an en-
 slaved country in the world whose hope
 for freedom does not rest with us.  We
 have friends and we have allies who help
 us; nevertheless, it rests with us. If
 we pull out, if we take the advice of those
 whom I call "the fainthearted ones," I
 believe one disaster after another will
 attend us, and we shall face a time and
 an hour when we shall be alone. There
 will be no allies to help us and we. shall
 face the accumulated might of a foe
 the like of which has never been seen-on
 earth.
 I know it is much easier to say, "Let us
 get out."
 All of us are conscious of the sacrifices
 of American boys there.
 I have four sons, and all of them are
 of military age.  Two are in the Army
 Reserve. I do not want my boys in a war
 any more than I want the boys of others
 to be in a war. But I believe the surest
 way to be certain that my sons and the
 sons of others will not be involved in a
 war is to do what is required of us, and
 to do it now. If we do not, our sons will
 be in that war, and what will be worse,
 the chances of their surviving it will be
 greatly reduced.
 Mr. SALTONSTALL.  What we must
 do, if the Senator will permit me to com-
 ment, is to accomplish our objective of
 furthering the cause of freedom.  We
 must use methods which we believe will
 be most helpful In attaining that ob-

 jective. That is what we are doing today
 in many places.
 Mr. DODD.  The Senator is correct.
 Mr. SALTONSTALL.  So long as we
 maintain our prestige, so long as the op-
 portunity  of achieving our objective
 exists we should go forward.  Does the
 Senator from Connecticut believe that to
 be a fair statement?
 Mr. DODD. Yes; I believe the Senator
 from Massachusetts is absolutely cor-
 rect.
 Mr. SALTONSTALL.  I thank the
 Senator.
 Mr. DODD.
 his comment.
 Mr. ERVIN.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator from Connecticut yield for an
 observation?
 Mr. DODD.   I am glad to yield.
 Mr. ERVIN.  I commend the able and
 distinguished senior Senator from Con-
 necticut for making a most illuminating
 speech.  The speech should receive the
 consideration of the public, as well as the
 consideration of those who make our
 military and diplomatic policy in south-
 east Asia.
 I believe the Senator has expounded in
 most eloquent fashion what Kipling said
 in a beautiful poem he wrote at the be-
 ginning of the First World War, the sub-
 stance of which was that free men can
 keel) their freedom in this precarious
 world only by keeping their hearts in
 courage and in patience and by lifting
 up their hands in strength.
 The Senator's able address has been a
 fine exposition of the same thought.
 Mr. DODD.  I am very grateful to the
 Senator.
 Mr. SALTONSTALL.  Mr. President,
 will the Senator yield so that I may make
 an observation on what the Senator from
 North Carolina has said?
 Mr. DODD.  I yield.
 Mr. SALTONSTALL.  If we were to
 agree to neutralization in South Vietnam
 today, as the Senator from Connecticut
 has said, we would be agreeing to neutral-
 ization by only one side, with no com-
 mitment by the other side.  That would
 really lead to defeat.
 Mr. DODD.  I believe that is correct.
 Mr. JOHNSTON.  Mr. President, I
 commend the Senator from Connecticut
 for what he has brought before the Sen-
 ate today.  We must remain strong and
 do everything that we possibly can to
 help South Vietnam at this time.  If we
 do not remain firm, our allies will become
 weaker and weaker.  If that were to
 happen, of course, it would be harder
 and harder for us to remain there.  We
 must stay there under all the circum-
 stances at the present time.  If we do
 not, it will appear to the world that we
 are a very weak nation.
 Mr. DODD.  I believe the Senator has
 stated the reality of the situation.  I
 am grateful for his comments.
 Mr. HUMPHREY,  Mr. President, I
 commend the Senator for his forthright
 statement. This kind of debate is al-
 ways helpful.  Neutralization, as has
 been indicated, cannot be very helpful;
 it could be detrimental, unless it were
 applied to the entire peninsula. I shall
 not go not go into a detailed discussion
 of the Senator's address.  I claim no
 expert knowledge In this area.  How-
 ever, these debates are helpful, and I
 am sure the administration welcomes
 such discussions.  We must have a na-
 tional consensus on this subject if our
 policy is to succeed.
 Mr. DODD.  I agree with the Sen-
 ator. That Is one of the reasons for my
 remarks today.
 Mr. DAVITS,  Mr. President, I am
 pleased that the Senator from Connecti-
 cut has discussed our problems in Viet-
 nam on the basis that he has in the
 course of his distinguished speech to the
 Senate.
 I do not necessarily agree with every
 aspect of the matter, as he discussed it.
 However, the fundamental thrust of his
 remarks demonstrates two things:
 First, a need to expose the situation
 to the view of the American people. In
 that regard, the Senator from Alaska
 [Mr. GRUENING)-who has discussed this
 matter with the Senator from Connecti-
 cut and with me and with other Sen-
 ators-also Is rendering a service in pre-
 senting his point of view. Certainly the
 people should know the points on both
 sides; and, as Members of the Senate, it
 is our duty to make that analysis avail-
 able to the people.
 Second, although I do not necessarily
 agree with all the points the Senator
 from Connecticut has made in the course
 of his speech, certainly its fundamental
 thrust is that our people should under-
 stand that the great stake we have in
 South Vietnam-namely, to keep that
 country  from going  over to cominu-
 nism-ii fundamental.  The casualties
 which already have occurred there are
 tragic; but it is clear that our choice now
 is between those casualties and perhaps
 much greater casualties later on-in-
 eluding the possible casualty of the loss
 of freedom there.
 In that respect, Mr. President, the
 speech of the Senator from Connecticut
 is most valuable; and I am grateful to
 him.
 Mr. DODD.  I thank the distinguished
 senior Senator from New York.

 court coalition, is assurance that Vene-
 zuela                                                                                         will  continue  the  same  en-
 lightened progressive domestic policy and
 pro-Western foreign policy that char-
 acterized the Betancourt government.
 The  successful  peaceful transition
 from.one freely chosen government to
 another is a triumph fo:r the principles
 underlying the Alliance for Progress, a
 triumph for the Kennedy policy in Latin
 America.  And no one would have been
 more pleased today to witness  this
 triumph of Venezuelan democracy tharf
 our late President John F. Kennedy.
 The election which brought President
 Leoni to the Presidency showed that the
 people of a wealthy, rapidly developing
 country like Venezuela support the poli-
 tical parties whose objectives and pro-
 grams are virtually identical to the aims
 of the Alliance for Progiess.  But if the
 new Venezuelan Government is to have
 a chance to continue the work of the
 Alliance for Progress in Venezuela, it
 must have the firm support of its allies
 in this hemisphere.  It must have-and
 I believe it will have-the firm support
 of the United States under President
 Johnson, just as President Betancourt
 enjoyed the full suppo:'t of President
 Kennedy.  As a new government, it
 should merit special consideration from
 other republics in this hemisphere for
 protection against Communist subver-
 sion directed and financed from Cuba.
 The report issued last month by the
 OAS makes it indisputably clear that
 Cuba has smuggled arms to terrorists in
 Venezuela.  It has presented photo-
 graphic evidence of the plan and the
 plot to subvert the Bet=court govern-
 ment at the time of the election in De-
 cember 1963.
 I wish my position on this subject to
 be crystal clear.  Our national policy
 should be one of clear, unequivocal sup-
 port for taking the necessary steps to
 cut off arms shipments from Cuba to
 Venezuela.  We can no longer condone
 Cuba being an arsenal for terrorism,
 revolution, and chaos. It is about time,
 instead of merely worrying about gov-
 ernments of friendly countries being able
 to stay in power and resist violence, that
 we choke off the source of that violence.
 We have stated before that we will
 not permit the Castro regime to subvert
 the democratic governments of its neigh-
 bors through armed aggression, whether
 covert or open.  We have repeatedly
 stated this as our policy. Today we have
 a clear, carefully documented case of
 arms shipments into Venezuela.  The
 Venezuelan Government has presented
 convincing photographic evidence of the
 smuggled arms shipments. The OAS re-
 port has confirmed the accuracy of the
 Government's allegations.
 What is our response to the situation?
 I believe we should mean what we have
 been saying.  We should take all steps
 necessary to prevent further arms ship-
 ments from Cuba into Venezuela.  And
 I mean all steps-whate-rer steps are re-
 quired in terms of navr:l operations, or
 any form of activity to stop these arms
 from crossing over into the Caribbean
 areas and Latin America.
