 Chronology
 400-700             Territory of present-day European Russia is settled by East-
 ern Slavs.
 700-800             Prosperous mercantile state with Khazar hegemony over
 Slavs is established between lower Volga and Dnepr
 rivers.
 800-912             Vikings under Rurik use river routes, to penetrate Russia;
 Kiyev becomes center of their dominion.
 990                 Christianity is introduced by Vladimir the Saint.
 1237-1240           European Russia is conquered by the Mongol Golden Horde,
 beginning two centuries of Tatar rule.
 1380                Prince Dmitry of Muscovy inflicts first defeat on Tatars in
 Battle of Kulikovo Field, laying basis for rise of Muscovy
 in 15th century.
 1533-1584           Ivan the Terrible reigns, proclaiming self tsar of the "third
 Rome," Muscovy, and beginning settlement east of Urals.
 1637                Russian pioneers reach Pacific coast of Siberia.
 1689-1725           Peter the Great reigns, embarking on far-reaching reforms
 to "Westernize" Russia and founding Saint Petersburg
 (now Leningrad).
 1762-1796           Catherine the Great continues "Westernization" of Russia,
 partitions Poland to increase European Russian territory,
 inaugurates Russian drive for warm--water ports by ac-
 quiring Crimea.
 1801-1825           Alexander I reigns, withstanding Napoleonic invasion which
 reaches Moscow and in the wake of which the Russian
 army penetrates France.
 1825                Revolt of Decembrists, a small group of noblemen favoring
 social reform, fails.
 1825-1855           Nicholas I institutes reactionary regime based on autocracy
 and Russification, inaugurating systematic use of secret
 police against the people.
 1857-1861           Alexander Herzen's revolutionary thought in the weekly
 Kolokol (The Bell) is published abroad with profound
 impact on Russian intellectuals.
 1861                Serfs are emancipated and commune-type system of peasant
 social organization is established.
 1876                First Russian revolutionary party, called Land and Liberty
 (later People's Will), is formed by Populists.
 1881                Mounting revolutionary activity of Populists culminates in
 assassination of Alexander II.
 1881-1894           Alexander III initiates severe repressions of revolutionaries

 1. Introduction
 Over a span of some 50 years the Soviet Union has
 developed from a backward, largely agricultural society
 into a modern industrial and military power capable of
 challenging the leadership of the United States on a
 number of fronts. Successive Soviet regimes have placed
 emphasis on enabling Moscow not only to maintain its
 domination over east and much of central Europe but
 also to extend its military and political influence to
 areas as distant from the Soviet heartland as Africa, the
 Indian Ocean, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia.
 The impressive achievements of the last half-century,
 however, have been costly in terms of human suffering
 and lives lost-most notably during the purges and the
 periods of collectivization and forced industrialization.
 Moreover, to achieve and maintain its present position,
 economic policy and scientific research have favored
 heavy industry and those scientific fields having the
 most direct impact on military capability. The result has
 been a level of living that continues to lag behind those
 of most industrialized nations and an uneven economic
 development in which agriculture and light industry fall
 short of those in major Western countries.
 The extension of Soviet influence abroad has been
 adversely affected by a number of factors, chief among
 which are the strength and stability of the West as a
 whole, the bitter quarrel since 1960 with Communist
 China, and the growing self-assertion among Eastern
 European  Communist  nations.  Moscow,  once  the
 control center of the entire Communist movement, is
 confronted with the erosion of its authority within the
 Communist camp, which includes almost 90 national
 Communist parties claiming an aggregate membership
 of 50 million, supplemented by a network of affiliated
 auxiliary or "front" organizations of both national and
 international scope. The emergence of China as a
 second viable Communist power center has been an
 important factor in reducing Soviet influence and
 prestige in the Communist movement and has made it
 more difficult for the U.S.S.R. to contain the trend
 toward autonomy in Eastern Europe and toward
 independence of foreign Communist parties elsewhere.
 The ability of the U.S.S.R., however, to offer substantial
 military, technical, and economic aid gives it an
 advantage in the competition with Communist China
 and enables it to vigorously challenge Western interests.
 Moscow still considers the third world a principal
 arena in the contest both with the Chinese and the West
 and  has deemphasized the creation and use of
 indigenous Communist parties in this area-especially
 in  countries  ruled  by  a  one-party nationalist
 movement-thus masking the threat of a local
 Communist takeover and creating a more friendly
 atmosphere for extending Moscow's influence through
 state-to-state relations. The U.S.S.R. also encourages
 Communist parties in developed countries of the West
 to form alliances with social democratic parties and
 other groups on local domestic issues in order to gain
 greater popular support and to help draw attention
 away from their Communist ties with Moscow. To
 insure consistency with Soviet interests, Moscow seeks-
 with varying success-to align the policies of these
 countries and parties with the foreign and domestic
 policies of the U.S.S.R., and through these tactics to
 extend its influence throughout the world.
 Soviet national interests and the Marxist-Leninist
 ideology are basic, if not coequal, factors which
 determine the foreign policy of the U.S.S.R. This
 ideology, despite Soviet tactical shifts from belligerence
 to detente and from increased pressure to accommoda-
 tion, has always held that the Communist and capitalist
 systems  are  essentially irreconcilable and that
 communism     will  eventually  triumph,  although
 conceding that the struggle will continue for some time.
 A fundamental concept of Soviet ideology, advanced by
 Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950's, has been "peaceful
 coexistence," which the regime has used to rationalize
 its conduct of a policy of cooperation with the West
 while continuing the traditional aim of dividing,
 subverting, and weakening non-Communist nations by
 all means short of war. Development of the U.S. S. R.'s
 foreign policy on the basis of even limited collaboration
 with the ideological enemy tended, during Khru-
 shchev's rule, to increase significantly the antagonism
 between the U.S.S.R.  and the Chinese People's
 Republic, whose leaders insist on uncompromising
 hostility  toward the West.  The present  Soviet
 leadership,  in vying with the militant Chinese
 Communists for the support of other Communist
 parties, has tried to avoid the taint of charges of
 collaboration with "imperialists." As a result, while the
 regime continues to take advantage of the ideologically
 acceptable idea of "peaceful coexistence" whenever it
 serves national interests to do so, the definition of the
 term has been narrowed to allow for greater militancy in
 the U.S.S.R.'s policy toward the West.
 The Soviet Union controls, directly or indirectly, most
 of the resources of Eastern Europe and dominates
 important strategic areas-the Polish plain and most of
 the Danubian basin. The economies of the Eastern
 European Communist nations have remained closely
 linked to the economy of the U.S.S.R., and the Soviet
 Army's harsh suppression of the Hungarian revolt of

 1956 as well as the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia
 in 1968 serve as examples to would-be separatists.
 Romania, however, cautiously continues its efforts to
 pursue a more independent foreign policy and to lessen
 its economic dependence o'n the U.S.S.R. and the
 Warsaw Pact countries.
 The U.S.S.R. has expanded the Soviet system by
 imposing it on the Eastern European nations,
 principally through military occupation after World
 War II,  and by supporting regimes of similar
 orientation in the Communist-dominated areas of Asia
 as well as in Cuba. Although the Soviet system is
 ruthless and cumbersome, some leaders in former
 colonial areas believe that, to varying degrees, it
 provides a model for the planning and authority needed
 to catapult an underdeveloped nation into the 20th
 century. Soviet economic aid programs are underway in
 a number of less developed nations of the non-
 Communist world. In many countries in Asia and
 Africa, the U.S.S.R., through the extension of long-term
 credits and the provision of technical assistance, has
 established itself as a major participant in ambitious
 plans for economic development. Concomitantly, the
 U.S.S.R. has become a primary source of aid for
 modernizing and expanding the military establishments
 of Afghanistan, Algeria,  Syria, the United Arab
 Republic (U.A.R.), Iraq, Cuba, and India, and is
 maintaining its economic offensive among the newly
 independent peoples of Africa and the leftist "national
 revolutionary movements" of Latin America. Despite its
 interest in extending Soviet influence in the third world,
 the present regime has become more cautious in
 granting economic aid unless there is some certainty
 that the Soviet Union will also reap clear political or
 economic benefits. Domestic economic problems plus
 the failure in the past of grandiose, Soviet-funded
 projects to bring a rapid increase in Soviet political
 influence-as for example in Indonesia-probably
 account for Moscow's new circumspection with regard
 to foreign aid.
 An elaborate system of controls has been maintained
 to perpetuate within the state the dominant position of
 the Soviet Communist Party, to shape public opinion,
 and-to neutralize popular discontent. Some of the more
 brutal repressive measures which characterized Stalin's
 rule have been eliminated by his successors in their
 efforts to stimulate individual initiative and to
 encourage the people to identify themselves with the
 regime. The ameliorative efforts have not been entirely
 successful and disaffection and dissidence have
 increased among important elements of Soviet society,
 most notably among the intelligentsia. The Soviet
 leadership has reacted in its domestic policy by a
 reemphasis on "orthodoxy."
 Despite the immensity and topographic variety of the
 U.S.S.R., less than one-eighth of the country is arable
 and a great part lies too far north for any but Arctic type
 habitation. In many areas where the climate is good the
 soil is poor, and some of the most fertile land lies in
 regions of inadequate precipitation or where the
 growing season is short.  Likewise, many of the
 abundant and varied raw materials in the U.S.S.R. are
 unfavorably located and hard to exploit. Most of the
 great rivers run to frozen or land-locked seas, and some
 flow in part through regions unsuited to settlement. The
 U.S.S.R. covers a large part of Europe and Asia, and its
 population has ethnic, religious, and historical ties with
 both. It has more people than any Western nation, and
 a sizable number are skilled in modern industrial
 techniques.  Scientific achievements are high, but
 administrative and managerial skills are less well
 developed.
 The virtual abolition of private ownership of the
 means of production,  the direction of economic
 development through a comprehensive and detailed
 economic plan, and the collectivization of millions of
 peasant farmers have been the foundations of a new
 society which its leaders maintain is superior to societies
 based on private enterprise. The Soviet economic
 system, however, has fallen far short of meeting the
 growing needs of the country's people. Although there
 has been some improvement in recent years, per capita
 production of consumer goods is low compared with that
 of Western industrial countries, and the diet is
 qualitatively poor by Western standards. Despite
 spectacular space accomplishments and high industrial
 growth rates, the country has a backward agriculture,
 many antiquated factories, underdeveloped services,
 and, by Western standards, relatively poor living
 conditions. Nevertheless, the leaders of the U.S.S.R.
 have created an integrated state which has survived a
 number of severe crises and have developed an economy
 which has become a tremendous force with worldwide
 impact.
 The regime regards its military establishment as a
 major instrument for sustaining and augmenting its
 position in the struggle against the capitalist world and
 as  an outstanding example of the  success and
 invincibility of its social system. The number of men
 under arms was reduced between 1960 and 1964, but in
 the period since the ouster of Khrushchev the downward
 trend was halted, and there has been a slight increase in
 military manpower. Throughout this period, the Soviet
 leadership has had the basic aim of maintaining and
 improving balanced military forces able to resist a
 Western attack on short notice, as well as to insure
 ultimate victory, and the resources needed to implement
 this policy are given priority consideration. Since 1965
 the regime has significantly expanded its military forces
 along the Chinese border and views its military strength
 there as an integral element in "containing" China.
 The U.S.S.R. sees military power as serving two basic
 purposes: defense of the Soviet system and support for
 expansion of its influence, making one of the most
 important objectives of Soviet military policy the
 deterrence of the West while the government conducts
 its foreign policy and subversive activities by all means
 short of open commitment of Soviet forces. Military
 power is sometimes brought into play in direct support
 of Soviet political demands through the threat of force,

 Approved For Release 2008/09/08: CIA-RDP08SO1 350R0001 00090001-7
 through the respect for the Soviet state and its
 Communist system engendered by its growing power,
 and through the military aid and support rendered to
 allies, to neutral but friendly states, and to anti-Western
 movements.
 Military strategy is also influenced by economic,
 technological, and geographic factors. Soviet military
 requirements have been a primary motivation for
 sustained and strenuous effort to increase economic
 strength and for high priorities for technological
 developments. Economic and technological advances
 have, conversely, influenced military thinking. Recent
 economic and technological achievements have
 facilitated the development of a more diversified armed
 force in place of one that has historically emphasized
 ground forces. Ground forces continue to play a vital
 role in Soviet armed power, but increased capabilities
 for air and naval warfare permit a more flexible military
 strategy, as illustrated by the presence of a strong naval
 force in the Mediterranean for the first time.
 The public Soviet position has long been that the
 world balance of forces is shifting in favor of "world
 socialism." Undoubtedly the Soviet leaders now see the
 advance of Soviet military power-from progress
 toward nuclear parity with the United States to global
 expansion of the Soviet navy-as a key component of
 this process. A measure of greater Soviet assertiveness
 may well accompany this growth of power..At the same
 time, however, Soviet actions regarding the Vietnam
 war, during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, and in the
 Middle East crises of 1967 and 1970 provide solid
 evidence that the U.S.S.R. recognizes the grave dangers
 posed by a direct confrontation with the United States
 and will act to avoid such a confrontation.
 Consciousness of Soviet power has by no means
 diminished the awareness of the danger of a nuclear
 confrontation in the Soviet policymaking outlook,
 particularly in view of apprehension over the future
 development of mainland China. But the degree of
 caution Moscow displays will probably be tied
 importantly to the U.S. attitude and capabilities in any
 given situation. Unrequited concessions on major East-
 West issues are not to be expected from Moscow, even if
 urgent domestic requirements for economic and
 technological progress impose certain restraints upon
 Soviet foreign policy, especially in Europe. The Soviet
 response to the U.S. statement of willingness to move
 toward an "era of negotiation" remains to be seen; that
 response will probably emerge on a case-by-case basis
 with differing content in different regions.

 2. Geography
 A. General
 The U.S.S.R., the largest country in the world,
 extends across much of Europe and all of northern Asia
 (Summary Map, Figure 186). It is bordered mostly by
 the broad North European Plain in the west and by an
 almost continuous mountain bulwark in the south; the
 Pacific and Arctic Oceans are to the east and north. The
 western border of the U.S.S.R. is within 1,000 nautical
 miles of all the important manufacturing centers in
 Western Europe; the southern border is within 750
 nautical miles of the extensive oilfields of the Middle
 East; the easternmost extremity is within 750 nautical
 miles of the principal U.S. bases in Alaska. Moreover,
 within 4,000 nautical miles of the northern coast, across
 the Arctic Ocean, are the major industrial regions of
 North America-all within range of Soviet jet bombers
 and missiles. The country is unfavorably located in
 relation to the major sea lanes of the world, and only a
 few widely scattered ports are open throughout the year.
 One geographic factor overshadows all others in
 characterizing the Soviet Union: its enormous size. The
 U.S.S.R. is approximately 300,000 square miles larger in
 area than the combined land areas of the United States,
 Canada, and Greenland (Summary Map inset, Figure
 187). Its 8.6 million square miles occupy almost one-
 sixth of the land surface of the earth. This vast area
 spans 170? of longitude across the northern part of the
 Eurasian continent, from the Baltic Sea in the west to
 the Bering Strait in the east.  Continental North
 America, by comparison, spans only 111? of longitude.
 This great longitudinal extent of the U.S.S.R. landmass
 measures about 5,550 miles' by air from Kaliningrad to
 the Bering Strait via Moscow, Tomsk, and Yakutsk.
 Between the southernmost point (approximately 35?N.)
 of the continental U.S.S.R.  on the Afghanistan
 boundary and its northernmost point (77?N.) on the
 Taymyr peninsula is a spread in latitude comparable to
 that from  Chattanooga,  Tennessee,  to Thule,
 Greenland. Soviet Arctic insular possessions extend to
 82?N. (Franz Josef Land). About 80% of the U.S.S.R. is
 north of 50?N., the latitude of Winnipeg, Canada.
 About 244 million people, roughly one-sixth more
 than the population of the United States, live in this
 enormous expanse of land. Approximately three-fourths
 of this population is concentrated west of the Ural
 Mountains in the European U.S.S.R., where most of the
 great urban centers and the best developed transporta-
 'Distances are in statute miles unless nautical miles are specifically
 stated.
 tion networks are located. With the expa 5X1 of
 industry and agriculture, the population of the U.S.S.R.
 has been increasing in Siberia and in the Arctic.
 1. Topography
 The surface of the U.S.S.R. is dominated by interior
 plains and plateaus drained by great rivers, the largest
 of which flow south in the European U.S.S.R. and north
 in Siberia. The area is rimmed on the south and east by
 a succession of mountain systems. Plains, broken at
 wide intervals by hills and low mountains, predominate
 in the western half of the country. These plains comprise
 four major zones from north to south: tundra, forested
 swampy plains, cultivated plains, and grass- and scrub-
 covered plains and deserts.
 The first, along the shores of the Arctic Ocean, is a
 zone of desolate tundra (Figure 1), characterized by
 arctic vegetation and permanently frozen subsoil
 (permafrost). Along its southern margin, where the
 tundra supports some tree growth, it merges with a
 second zone, a broad belt of densely forested swampy
 plains (taiga) (Figure 2). These forested plains extend
 from near the Arctic Circle southward to about 55?N.
 Movement is extremely difficult through these immense
 forested swamps, which is an important reason for the
 sparsity of urban centers in the zone. Natural openings
 and clearings prevalent near the southern boundary of
 the forest zone are outliers of the third zone-well-
 drained cultivated plains (Figure 3) and widely
 scattered forests of mixed evergreen and deciduous
 trees. These plains extend westward beyond the borders
 of the U.S.S.R. along the Baltic and North Sea coasts to
 France and have been the obvious and traditional
 avenue for military movement during the last thousand
 years.  Most of the  Soviet population, the most
 productive industries and agricultural areas, and the
 best developed transportation net are concentrated in
 these plains. South of the cultivated plains is the fourth
 zone, grass- and scrub-covered plains and deserts
 (Figure 4), which occupies an area more than half as
 large as the United States. Most of this zone is east of
 the Caspian Sea and south of about 50?N. Centers of
 population in these plains and deserts are widely
 scattered and linked by a sparse network of railroads
 and mostly poor roads.
 A plateau area cut by deeply incised river valleys is
 between the Yenisey and the Lena rivers. The surface of
 the plateau, although higher than the swampy plains in
 the west, resembles them in the relatively uninterrupted
 expanses of dense, swampy coniferous forest. Movement

 in this area is severely restricted. Surface transportation
 routes north of the Trans-Siberian railroad are very
 sparse except for trails and inland waterways. This part
 of Siberia has one of the lowest population densities in
 the U.S.S.R. The largest concentration of people is
 around Irkutsk near Lake Baykal.
 The U.S.S.R., in general, has a continental climate.
 The predominant influences on the climate are the vast
 Eurasian landmass and the adjacent or nearby oceans
 and seas.  Winters (principally December through
 February) vary from cool in some Black Sea regions to
 extremely cold in much of Siberia, where an absolute
 minimum near -95?F. has been recorded. Summers
 (June through August) vary from cool on the Arctic coast
 to hot in the southern desert regions, where absolute
 maximums near 115?F. have occurred (Figure 5).
 Annual precipitation averages less than 20 inches over
 most of the U.S.S.R. and ranges locally from less than 5
 inches to more than 40 inches. Winter precipitation is
 mostly in the form of frequent light snows which cover
 most of the surface throughout this season. Occasional
 blizzards last for several days and disrupt most
 operations. Showers account for the greatest monthly
 amounts of' summer precipitation at most places.
 Thunderstorms occur predominantly in summer; they
 are most frequent in June and July, when they occur on
 6 to 12 days per month in the southern mountains and 4
 to 6 days per month elsewhere, except. in the Arctic
 regions where they are infrequent.
 Relative humidity varies from extremely high along
 the Arctic coast all year to low in the southern desert
 regions during the summer. Except along the Arctic
 coast diurnal and seasonal variations are significant,
 and most locations have high early morning values and
 lower afternoon values. Seasonal maximums of relative
 humidity normally occur in summer along the Pacific
 coast and at some locations near large lakes. By
 contrast, most interior locations have winter maximums.
 Cloudiness is generally at a maximum in summer and
 early autumn and at a minimum in winter and early
 spring over much of Siberia and the Arctic regions of the
 European U.S.S.R. The opposite is true over much of the
 remainder of the country. Greatest cloudiness, generally
 65% to 90% in summer and 45% to 65% in winter,
 occurs along the Arctic and Pacific coasts; least
 cloudiness, generally 40% to 60% in winter and 10% to
 40% in summer, occurs in the southern deserts and
 semidesert areas.
 In general, poorest visibilities occur during the colder
 months and best visibilities during the warmer months.
 However, along the Arctic and Pacific coasts, visibilities
 during summer may be poor because of fog. Chief
 restrictions during the colder months are falling and
 blowing snow, fog, ice fog in northern sections, and haze
 and smoke near cities and industrial areas. Summer
 restrictions are fog, heavy rain, and, in southern desert
 regions, duststorms.
 Surface winds over most of the U.S.S.R. normally are
 directed away from central Siberia in winter and toward
 southern Asia in summer. Winds are generally strongest
 in winter, when gales (wind speed equal to or greater
 than 28 knots) occur on 10 or more days per month on
 the Arctic coast and only 1 or 2 days per month in parts
 of the Caucasus.
 B. Military geographic regions
 The U.S.S.R.  contains such a wide range of
 environmental conditions that broad generalizations
 have been used in defining military geographic regions
 for the country. Significant factors used to distinguish
 the various military geographic regions are relief,
 drainage, vegetation, climate, and coastal influences.
 Differences in these factors in the Soviet Union are
 sufficiently marked to provide a basis for dividing the
 country into seven military geographic regions: the
 Central Plains, the Caucasus Mountains, the Caspian-
 Central Asian Lowlands, the Southern and Eastern
 Mountains, the Subarctic Swamp and Forest, the Arctic
 Barrens, and the Insular and Peninsular Far East
 (Figure  6).  The  most  important region,  both
 economically and strategically, and the most favorable
 for sustained large-scale military operations, is the
 Central Plains region.
 1. Central Plains
 This region, which contains most of the population,
 industry, and transportation network of the U.S.S.R.,
 extends from the western borders of the Soviet Union
 eastward for about 2,700 miles into Siberia. The region
 is composed mostly of sparsely forested plains which are
 dissected by major north- or south-flowing rivers. The
 plains are interrupted in their central section by the
 narrow, relatively low Ural Mountains. Relatively small
 mountainous areas are also located in the southwest on
 the border with Romania and near Sevastopol' on the
 Black Sea.
 Because of its physical characteristics and its
 industrial and cultural development, this region is the
 part of the Soviet Union most generally suited for large-
 scale conventional ground operations. Cross-country
 movement is difficult in parts of the west and northwest
 because of extensive marsh and forest areas, and in the
 relatively small mountainous areas where vehicles
 would be confined to existing lines of transportation.
 Movement in the remaining parts of the Central Plains
 is fair to good but is greatly influenced by several
 seasonal factors.
 Heavy rains and melting snow from as early as late
 February in the south and lasting until mid-May in the
 north cause the ground to become deep mud, making
 cross-country movement very difficult. Severe cold and
 snowfall from late October to mid-April impose great
 hardships on troops. Mean daily minimum tempera-
 tures of -50?F. and snow as deep as 3 feet have been
 recorded in this region. Although winter may force a
 marked slowdown in military operations,  it may

 FIGURE 6. Generalized military geographic regions and terrain
 facilitate movement in one important respect: rivers
 generally freeze to sufficient depth to support light
 vehicles and, in some places, tanks.
 Military operations would be facilitated by the best
 developed highway and railroad network in the Soviet
 Union. This road and rail system is supplemented by a
 system of navigable rivers and canals. Construction of
 new roads would encounter major problems throughout
 much of this region.
 Concealment and some cover would be available in
 the fairly extensive forested areas in the northern part of
 the region and on the forested slopes of mountainous
 areas. Elsewhere, natural cover and concealment for
 large numbers of mechanized forces are sparse, though
 small villages throughout the region could provide cover
 and concealment for small numbers of troops. Extremely
 dry periods during summer months make vegetation
 and  grasses  readily combustible.  The region is
 moderately well suited for bunker-type construction
 except in large, poorly drained areas in parts of the west
 and northwest and in western Siberia.
 The Central Plains region is well suited for airmobile
 and airborne operations during the months of June
 through September. Numerous sites are available for
 parachute,  helicopter,  and  assault-type  aircraft
 landings,  which would  require little or no site
 nF
 JAPAN
 preparation. Several reservoirs and large rivers would
 also be suitable for landing water-based aircraft.
 Construction of airfields would be relatively easy on the
 plains except in parts of the west and northwest, where
 sites are limited in size, number, and alignments by
 numerous marshes, swamps, and lakes. In many places,
 little grading would be required and runway lengths
 and alignments would be unrestricted. Construction
 material, except hard rock suitable for crushing, is
 generally available. Miry ground or extreme cold during
 much of the rest of the year would adversely affect the
 performance of men and equipment.
 The coast is mostly unsuitable for amphibious
 operations because of partly obstructed nearshore
 approaches, rugged coastal terrain, areas of marsh, and
 poor exits. Although there are numerous landing
 beaches along the coasts of the Baltic and Black Seas,
 the most suitable areas for large-scale landings are in
 the vicinity of Riga on the Baltic Sea and near Odessa,
 Yevpatoriya, and Feodosiya on the Black Sea. In winter,
 however, these beaches are generally obstructed by ice
 from late November through April in the Baltic Sea and
 early December to late March in the northern part of
 the Black Sea. In the Baltic Sea, offshore approaches are
 generally clear, but nearshore approaches are partially
 obstructed by rocks or shoals. Nearshore bottom slopes
 off the beaches range from flat to steep but are mostly
 Approved For Release 2008/09/08: CIA-RDP08SO1 350R0001 00090001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/09/08: CIA-RDP08SO1 350R0001 00090001-7
 flat. Bottom materials generally are sand and mud, with
 rocks and clay off several beach areas: Beaches range
 from 1,200 yards to 193/a miles (the majority are up to 4
 miles) in length, and beach material is sand which is
 firm when wet and soft when dry. Exit inland is mainly
 by tracks and trails to nearby surfaced or unsurfaced
 roads. In the Black Sea, offshore approaches are
 generally clear, but nearshore approaches are partly
 obstructed by shoals, rocks, and reefs except off the
 south coast of the Crimean Peninsula where they are
 clear. Nearshore bottom slopes off the beaches range
 from flat to steep, but the majority are gentle. Bottom
 materials generally are sand and mud, with gravel and
 shell off several beach areas. Beaches average about 1
 mile in length and are composed of sand and gravel
 which is firm when wet and soft when dry. Exits from
 beaches are by tracks and trails to nearby surfaced and
 unsurfaced roads. The most feasible landing areas are
 shown on the Summary Map, Figure 186.
 The Central Plains region is fair to poor for irregular
 force operations. The relatively flat nonforested plains
 would offer little to no cover or concealment, but the
 forested slopes of the Ural and Carpathian Mountains
 would provide cover and concealment for small groups.
 Bogs and swamps in the west and northwest make
 movement on foot difficult but do offer some cover and
 concealment for small groups. Conventional force
 operations would be very difficult in the bogs and
 swamps. The relatively well developed road network
 would aid the movement of conventional forces, to the
 detriment of irregular force operations. Sustenance
 would be available on the cultivated plains but scarce in
 mountain regions.
 This region is composed mostly of two northwest-
 southeast-trending mountain ranges which contain
 many peaks over 15,000 feet above sea level (Figure 7).
 These high, rugged,  partially forested,  sparsely
 populated mountains are drained by north- or south-
 oriented, deeply incised, rapidly flowing streams and
 are divided by relatively narrow, densely populated,
 cultivated valleys.  .
 The Caucasus Mountains region is, for the most part,
 unsuited for large-scale conventional ground opera-
 tions. Steep mountain slopes would preclude vehicular
 cross-country movement except in the valleys between.
 the two major mountain ranges. Operations could be
 conducted best by troops trained in mountain warfare.
 Cold weather during winter months would be an
 additional handicap to troops operating in the
 mountains; January mean daily minimum temperatures
 as low as 6?F. have been reported. Snow cover generally
 lasts from late October to early April.
 The principal roads in the region follow the coasts
 and extend east-west via the valleys which separate the
 two major ranges. Several roads, which can be easily
 blocked, traverse the mountains from north to south.
 Although construction materials are plentiful; the
 construction of new roads would be extremely difficult
 in most places because of steep slopes.
 Forests, most extensive in the west and on lower
 slopes, and surface irregularities would afford cover and
 concealment for troops operating in the mountains.
 However, in the valleys which separate the major
 ranges, natural cover and concealment are generally
 poor. Much of the region is well suited for the
 construction of tunnel-type installations, but access to
 sites is difficult. Most parts of the valleys are favorable
 for bunker-type installations.
 The region is not suited for airmobile and airborne
 operations. High, rugged relief would be an obstacle for
 low-level air approaches to most parachute drop and
 helicopter landing sites except in the valleys separating
 the two major mountain ranges. Steep slopes also
 preclude airfield construction in most of the area.
 However, there are some sites suitable for airfields in
 the valleys separating the two mountain ranges;
 approaches and runway orientations would be generally
 unrestricted.
 Rugged terrain along much of the Black Sea coast
 makes most of this region unsuitable for large-scale
 amphibious operations. There are, however, amphib-
 ious landing areas on the eastern part of the Black Sea
 coast. Approaches are clear, beaches long, and exits
 inland to coastal roads and railroads favorable.
 The Caucasus Mountains region is well suited for
 irregular force 'operations. Rugged, densely forested

 Approved For Release 2008/09/08: CIA-RDP08SO1 350R0001 00090001-7
 slopes offer cover and concealment for small groups.
 Developed transportation facilities are poor, and the
 existing roads can be easily blocked. The valleys are
 cultivated and more densely populated, and may afford
 some food, clothing, and shelter. Natural cover and fuel
 would be available in the mountains. In winter, low
 temperatures would hinder irregular force operations.
 3. Caspian-Central Asian Lowlands
 This lowland region is mostly east of the Caspian Sea
 and extends eastward for a maximum distance of about
 1,800 miles. The region consists of and and simiarid
 sparsely populated plains where only six major rivers, in
 an area covering over 1 million square miles, have
 sufficient supplies of water to sustain flow throughout
 the year.
 The Caspian-Central Asian Lowlands are unsuited
 for large-scale conventional ground operations in almost
 every aspect except cross-country movement. The
 greatest problem would be overcoming the almost
 complete absence of an adequate water supply
 throughout most of the region. Only in the southeast,
 adjacent to the Southern and Eastern Mountains region,
 is sufficient water available through the year. Ample
 supplies are also available from mid-March to mid-June
 in the extreme north. The paucity of roads and railroads
 for movement of men and materiel would add to the
 problems of military operations. Only five railroads
 cross the region from north to south, and paved roads
 are almost nonexistent. The insufficiency of both water
 and construction materials would make construction of
 transportation facilities difficult. Troops operating in
 the region would also be handicapped by the scarcity of
 natural  cover  and concealment.  Other natural
 conditions, however, favor the construction of bunker-
 type installations except in the areas of sand dunes in
 the south and in hilly areas in the northeast. In the hilly
 areas, natural conditions are moderately well suited for
 the construction of tunnel-type installations.
 Troops operating in the area would be subject to a
 wide variation in temperature between summer and
 winter. Mean daily maximum temperatures in July
 range from the low 80's to the upper 90's. In January,
 mean daily minimum temperatures range from slightly
 below zero to the lower 30's.
 Although the terrain of most of the Caspian-Central
 Asian  Lowlands favors airmobile  and airborne
 operations and contains numerous sites for landing of
 assault-type aircraft, troops dropped in the area would
 experience the same unfavorable conditions that would
 be encountered by large-scale ground operations.
 Construction of airfields throughout most of the area
 would be seriously handicapped by the lack of water,
 construction materials, and good natural foundations.
 The region is unsuited for large-scale amphibious
 operations because it has no approaches from the open
 sea.
 The Caspian-Central Asian Lowlands are poorly
 suited for irregular force operations. The flat,. semiarid,
 sparsely populated plains offer little to no cover or
 concealment, and the scarcity of water would be a
 constant problem. There are very few roads and
 railroads, but the good conditions for cross-country
 movement of conventional forces would be detrimental
 to operations of irregular forces. Natural cover, fuel, and
 sustenance would be scarce.
 This region, the largest in the U.S.S.R., extends for
 6,000 miles from the Caspian Sea in the southwest to the
 Bering Strait in the extreme northeast. This sparsely
 populated region consists, for the most part, of rugged
 mountains (Figure 8), which contain a variety of terrain
 features. The mountains along the Iran border in the
 west are arid and barren. Those along the Afghanistan
 border are sparsely forested and are drained by
 numerous rapidly flowing, deeply incised streams.
 These mountains contain the highest peaks in the
 U.S.S.R. and are the site of extensive glaciers and
 snowfields. Farther east, along the Mongolia border
 west of Lake Baykal, the mountains are more densely
 forested and peaks are lower. The region east of Lake
 Baykal is less rugged; mountain ranges there present
 varied patterns of shape, height, and direction and are
 more frequently separated by broad, nearly level valleys
 than are the ranges in the west.
 This region is mostly unsuited for large-scale
 conventional ground operations. Steep slopes preclude
 vehicular cross-country movement. East of Lake Baykal,
 the region is crossed by the vital Trans-Siberian
 railroad, which connects the Central Plains region to
 important population centers on the Pacific coast and
 along which most of the region's population is located;
 however, operations would be handicapped by the
 almost complete absence of a road and railroad
 network. Steep slopes in most of the region would make
 construction of transportation facilities very difficult.
 Good cover from small arms fire and concealment from
 observation is afforded by the forests; irregularities in
 relief may give good cover from flat-trajectory fire. Most
 of the region is moderately to well suited for the
 construction of tunnel-type installations. Many valleys
 and basins  are  poorly  suited for bunker-type
 installations because of poor drainage. In addition to
 rugged relief and the paucity of roads and railroads,
 troops operating in this area would be subject to
 extremely cold winter temperatures. Temperatures in
 the interior are among the coldest in the world. At
 Verkhoyansk a low of -94?F. has been recorded; in the
 mountains west of Lake Baykal a low of -59?F. has
 been recorded.
 The region is unsuited for airmobile and airborne
 operations. Steep slopes preclude parachute drops and
 landing of helicopter and assault-type aircraft in most
 localities. Marshy terrain is a hindrance in the larger

 FIGURE 8. Rugged, partially forested slopes in the Tien Shan Mountains
 valleys and basins. The surrounding high relief is an
 obstacle for low-level approaches to these valleys and
 basins. Steep slopes preclude airfield construction in
 most of the region, and, in many basins and valleys,
 airfield construction would be hindered by poor
 drainage.
 The rugged relief which extends along most of the
 Pacific coast is generally not suitable for amphibious
 operations. There are, however, suitable landing areas
 that afford access to Vladivostok and Nakhodka.
 Approaches are generally clear with the exception of
 rocks in the nearshore approach. The beaches are
 composed of sand and gravel and are firm. Exits inland
 are by tracks and unsurfaced roads to a nearby surfaced
 coastal road.
 The Southern and Eastern Mountains region is well
 suited for irregular force operations. The rugged,
 densely forested mountains in the south offer good cover
 and concealment. Mountains in the east are less rugged
 but also offer good possibilities for undetected
 movement and cover. This region is characterized by
 extremely cold temperatures and by an almost complete
 absence of a road and railroad network. Cultivated and
 natural foods are very scarce, and supplying irregular
 forces by sea or air would be difficult.
 5. Subarctic Swamp and Forest
 This sparsely populated region, which stretches
 eastward about 3,500 miles from the border of Finland
 to the mountains east of the Lena river, consists of
 heavily forested, poorly drained plains and highlands
 which are dissected by large, north-flowing rivers. That
 part of the region west of the Yenisey river consists
 almost entirely of plains except for a relatively small
 area of hills in the northwest and the Ural Mountains,
 which bisect the region in the vicinity of the 60th
 meridian. East of the Yenisey river the Central Siberian
 Plateau is hilly with a large flat to dissected plain near
 the Lena river. A large area of mountains is located just
 east of the Yenisey river.
 The Subarctic Swamp and Forest region is poorly
 suited for large-scale conventional ground operations.
 Though much of this region is relatively flat, movement
 of troops and vehicles is either highly restricted and
 channelized or is practically impossible because of
 flooded or soft ground, marshes, deep streams, and
 locally rugged terrain. From mid-October through
 April, frozen water features and ground may aid .
 movement provided snow cover is not greater than 11/2
 feet deep. Steep slopes are additional obstacles. to cross-
 country movement in the Ural Mountains and the hilly
 to mountainous Central Siberian Plateau.
 Another deterrent to military operations is the almost
 complete absence of a road and rail network. Three
 railroads cross this region from north to south, west of
 the Urals. These run from Murmansk, Arkhangel'sk,
 and Vorkuta southward into the Central Plains region.
 Construction of additional transportation facilities

 would require extensive clearing and drainage, and
 alignments would be restricted by steep slopes in the
 Ural Mountains and the Central Siberian Plateau.
 Good cover from small arms fire and concealment
 from observation is afforded by the dense forests; steep
 slopes and rugged terrain in the hilly and mountainous
 areas give good cover from flat-trajectory fire. The poor
 drainage makes much of this region unsuited for the
 construction of underground installations.
 The  severe subarctic climate compounds the
 handicaps imposed by the swampy, forested terrain.
 The extremely low temperatures would severely reduce
 the efficiency of troops. Yakutsk on the Lena river has a
 January mean daily minimum temperature of -53?F.
 West of the Yenisey river, temperatures, although less
 extreme, are near or below 0?F. for long periods.
 This region, for the most part, is unsuited for
 airmobile and airborne operations. Although air
 approaches are generally unrestricted, except from the
 east, the dense forests and extensive swamps would be
 extremely hazardous for troops dropped into the area.
 Construction of airfields would be difficult and would
 require extensive clearing and drainage.
 The region borders the White Sea for a short distance
 in the northwest, but conditions there do not favor
 large-scale amphibious operations. The shores are
 normally blocked by ice between mid-November and
 mid-May.              -
 The Subarctic Swamps and Forests region affords
 good to fair conditions for irregular force operations.
 Dense forests throughout this region afford good
 concealment and cover from small arms fire; the more
 rugged terrain in the Ural Mountains and the Central
 Siberian Plateau affords good concealment and very
 good cover from flat-trajectory fire for small groups.
 Sustenance, such as cultivated or natural foods, shelter,
 and clothing would be very scarce. The severe subarctic
 climate would be a hindrance to irregular force
 operations.
 This region, which lies mostly north of the Arctic
 Circle, extends approximately 3,500 miles along the
 coast of the Arctic Ocean from the borders of Finland
 and Norway in the west to the Kolyma river in the east.
 Most of the Soviet islands in the Arctic Ocean are
 included in the region. The mainland part of the region
 is a sparsely populated plain drained by large north-
 flowing rivers and is covered for the most part by tundra
 vegetation. However, the plains are interrupted in the
 west by the Ural Mountains and by scattered hilly and
 mountainous areas. Many of the islands in the Arctic
 Ocean are also hilly, and glaciers and snowfields cover
 about half their areas.
 This  region  is  poorly  suited for large-scale
 conventional ground operations.  Troops would be
 subjected to the climatic extremes characteristic of high
 latitudes. Conditions are especially severe during the
 long, extremely cold winters, which last from early
 October through March. Winter darkness and frequent
 storms  make  visibility extremely poor.  Winter
 temperatures  usually  remain  below 0?F.,   and
 temperatures as low as -75?F. have been recorded in
 the east. In summer, when mean daily minimum
 temperatures in July and August range mostly between
 40? and 60?F., the ground thaws and makes vehicular
 movement extremely difficult. Another handicap to
 ground operations is the almost complete absence of
 improved roads or railroads to facilitate the movement
 of troops and supplies. Although relief presents few
 problems to road or railroad construction, the presence'
 of permafrost in most of the region and the poor
 drainage during the summer make construction of these
 facilities very difficult. The low-growing vegetation
 affords no cover and little concealment. The presence of
 permafrost would be a handicap in the construction of
 bunker- and tunnel-type installations.
 Although the relief and vegetation of the region favor
 airmobile and airborne operations, such operations
 would encounter the same severe arctic climate factors
 that would adversely affect ground operations.
 Similarly, airfield construction would be hindered by
 the same problems encountered in railroad and road
 construction, principally permafrost and poor summer
 drainage.
 The region is not suited for amphibious operations.
 Except along the coast of the Kola Peninsula on the
 Barents Sea, which is generally ice-free throughout the
 year, shores are ice-free only from August through
 September or mid-October. There is, one landing area
 northeast of Murmansk suitable for large-scale
 amphibious operations. Offshore approaches are clear;
 nearshore approaches are partly obstructed by sandbars.
 The beach material is sand, which is firm when wet and
 soft when dry. Exits inland are cross-country or by trails
 to a minor port.
 The Arctic Barrens offer fair conditions for irregular
 force operations. The flat, sparsely vegetated plains
 offer little to no cover or concealment. Long, dark
 winters, deep snow, and extreme cold would present
 difficulties to irregular forces. Miry conditions in the
 summer months would practically preclude the
 movement of conventional forces on the ground. This
 barren land offers little or no sustenance, but the flat
 plains would allow supplies to be brought in by air.
 This region consists of the Kamchatka Peninsula,
 Sakhalin island, and the Kuril Islands. The Kamchatka
 Peninsula and Sakhalin each have two generally
 parallel forested mountain ranges drained by short,
 rapidly flowing, incised streams. These mountain
 ranges are separated by marshy or swampy plains.
 Approved For Release 2008/09/08: CIA-RDP08SO1 350R0001 00090001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/09/08: CIA-RDP08S01350R000100090001-7
 Marshy plains are also common along the coasts and on
 northern Sakhalin. Most of the Kuril Islands are
 mountainous.
 The rugged relief that comprises most of this region is
 unsuited for large-scale conventional ground opera-
 tions. Steep slopes preclude vehicular cross-country
 movement in most of the region. In the plains, marshes
 and swamps are the principal deterrents to vehicular
 movement. Military operations could be conducted best
 by troops trained in mountain warfare. The paucity of
 roads and railroads would add to the difficulties of
 troops operating in the region. Hard-surfaced roads are
 few and there are only two major railroad lines (3'6"
 gage)  in  Sakhalin.  Construction of additional
 transportation facilities would be extremely difficult on
 steep mountain slopes and on the poorly drained areas
 that cover most of the plains.  The forests and
 irregularities of relief afford cover and concealment in
 mountainous areas. Natural cover and concealment
 would be generally lacking on the plains. The region is
 well suited for the construction of tunnel-type
 installations in the mountains; most of the plains are
 unsuited for bunker-type installations because of poor
 drainage. An additional factor that would handicap
 ground operations is severe winter weather. Tempera-
 tures remain below freezing during the period late
 October through March, and minimums slightly below
 -50?F.  have been recorded on the Kamchatka
 Peninsula and Sakhalin. Minimums near -20?F. have
 been recorded in the Kuril Islands. Depth of snow cover
 ranges from 1 to 6 feet throughout the winter and is
 greatest in the southern parts of the Kamchatka
 Peninsula and on the higher parts of Sakhalin.
 The region is unsuited for airmobile and airborne
 operations. High relief precludes the landing of troops
 in most of the area and is an obstacle to low-level air
 approaches. The steep, rugged relief also precludes
 airfield construction in most of the area. Poor drainage
 presents major construction problems in the plains.
 The coastline of this region is unsuited for
 amphibious operations, and the numerous beaches do
 not afford access to selected internal routes or strategic
 areas.
 The Insular and Peninsular Far East region is well
 suited for irregular force operations. The densely
 forested, rugged mountains offer good cover and
 concealment for small groups. Natural cover and
 concealment are generally lacking in the plains. Snow,
 ranging from 1 to 6 feet in depth, and severe cold would
 be problems to irregular forces in winter. Natural
 sustenance would be scarce in this region, and it would
 be difficult to supply troops by sea or air.
 C. Strategic area
 Nine strategic areas (Moscow, Donets, Volga-Ural,
 Leningrad, Baku, Tashkent, Kuznetsk, Baykal and Far
 Eastern) are of primary importance to the military
 potential of the Soviet Union. These vary considerably
 in size and in the reasons for their importance. Four
 important areas are located west of 50?E. and are
 centered on the cities of Moscow, Leningrad, and Baku
 and on the industrial area of the Donets Basin. Moscow
 is the political, and military center of the Soviet Union
 as well as a major industrial and communication center.
 Leningrad is an industrial city and port, and Baku is
 one of the most important petroleum centers in the
 nation. The Donets Basin is the most important mining
 and industrial district of the country. Another important
 area is the roughly triangular-shaped petroleum-
 producing, mining, and industrial district which extends
 from the Volga river, in the vicinity of Kuybyshev and
 Kazan', eastward to include the central and southern
 Ural  Mountains.  In south-central  U.S.S.R.,  an
 important but relatively isolated industrial center is in
 the vicinity of Tashkent. East of the Ural Mountains
 and north of Tashkent are three widely separated areas
 of major strategic significance. 'Located on the Trans-
 Siberian railroad, they are the mining, manufacturing,
 and communication complexes of the Kuznetsk and
 Baykal strategic areas and the rail terminus and port of
 Vladivostok on the Sea of Japan in the Far Eastern
 strategic area.
 The Soviet Arctic also is of strategic importance.
 Because of its location in relation to transpolar air
 routes, the Soviet Arctic affords advanced sites for
 defensive installations such as early warning systems
 and interceptor bases, and for offensive bases for
 launching Soviet air power and missiles. The Soviet
 Arctic acquires additional importance because of the
 Northern Sea Route, which, despite severe physical
 limitations and the short navigation season (about 2
 months), has strategic importance as the shortest route
 between Atlantic and Pacific Soviet ports. During a war
 it would become an important consideration in Soviet
 efforts to maintain two-ocean naval mobility. The only
 major Soviet port north of the Black Sea that is entirely
 ice free and that has year-round access to the Atlantic is
 Murmansk.
 1. Moscow
 Situated on a nearly flat plain in the European
 U.S.S.R., the Moscow strategic area (Figure 9) is both
 the political and military capital of the country.
 Moscow (Figure 10) is the largest (population
 6,942,000 in 1970) and most important urban area in the
 Soviet Union. The city has the largest concentration of
 diversified industry in the country and is a major center
 for scientific and industrial research.  There are
 numerous industrial installations within the urban area
 which produce a wide range of products, including
 munitions, heavy and light machinery, electronic
 equipment, chemicals, guided missiles and components,
 airframes and jet engines, motor vehicles, and ball 25X1
 bearings. The city is the site of Moscow State University
 and the national headquarters of the Academy of
 Sciences and numerous scientific institutes. In addition,
 Moscow is the largest telecommunication center in the
 country, a hub of the gas pipeline system, and the focal

 point of the transportation systems. The river port areas
 are among the largest inland harbors in the country.
 The Moscow area is the principal domestic and
 international air communication center with many
 important civil and military airfields. It is also the
 central headquarters of the Soviet military forces, a
 center of advanced military training, and the site of
 extensive and varied storage facilities.
 2. Donets
 The most important mining and basic metallurgical
 district in the U.S.S.R., the Donets strategic area
 (Figure 11), contains extensive coal and iron-ore mines
 (Figure 12), numerous centers of heavy industry, well-
 developed electric power facilities, and a dense railroad
 network. This strategic area is about 400 miles south of
 Moscow, north of the Black Sea.
 The Donets strategic area is a major producer of pig
 iron (about 50% in 1965) and steel. Nowhere else in the
 Soviet Union is such an abundance of good coal, iron
 ore, limestone, and manganese found in such close
 proximity. The coal mines are concentrated in the
 eastern part of the area, about 200 miles east of the iron-
 ore deposits at Krivoy Rog. A major natural gas
 producing area is centered just south of Khar'kov, and
 important gas pipelines extend from the region. Rich
 manganese deposits are located near Nikopol'.
 Important industrial centers within the strategic area
 include Khar'kov, Donetsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Rostov,
 Zaporozh'ye, and Voroshilovgrad. Khar'kov (population
 1,223,000 in 1970) is a leading producer of heavy
 industrial machinery and equipment;  important
 products include aircraft, locomotives, tractors, tanks,
 turbines, heavy electrical equipment, machine tools,
 agricultural and mining machinery, radios, and ball
 bearings. Donetsk (population 879,000 in 1970) and the
 neighboring area is an important center of iron and
 steel production, coal mining, and chemical manufac-
 turing, particularly explosives and fertilizers. Dneprope-
 trovsk (population 863,000 in 1970) is one of the most
 important centers for the production of guided missiles,
 ingot steel and finished steel products, and heavy
 industrial equipment and machinery. Powerplants, an
 important coke-chemical plant, and a large rubber-tire
 factory are located in and near the city. Rostov
 (population 789,000 in 1970), a nationally important
 industrial center, is a leading producer of agricultural
 machinery.  It also produces diversified industrial
 machinery, helicopters, and chemicals. The city is also a
 primary telecommunications switching center in the
 national network. Zaporozh'ye (population 658,000 in
 1970) is one of the principal metalworking centers of the
 U.S.S.R.  It is a producer of aluminum and an
 outstanding producer of high-quality steel for missile
 tubing, jet-engine turbine blades, and armor plate. The
 city al?o contains an important aircraft-engine plant, a
 major electric transformer plant, and is the site of a
 large  hydroelectric powerplant.  Voroshilovgrad
 (population 382,000 in 1970) is the site of a large
 thermal powerplant and is the leading producer of
 locomotives in the country.
 A dense transportation network and a power-
 transmission grid serve the area. Most transportation is
 by rail; highways are used only for short hauls. The
 rivers near the eastern and western margins of the
 strategic area are of little importance for intra-area
 movement. Important transportation centers are Rostov
 and Khar'kov. Rostov, near the mouth of the Don river,
 is a transshipment point between railroads and the
 inland water route to the Volga river. Khar'kov is the
 main rail junction of lines leading from the Donets
 Basin directly to Moscow.
 3. Volga-Ural
 The Volga-Ural strategic area (Figure 13) is the most
 important petroleum-producing and refining area and
 the second most important mining and metallurgical
 district in the Soviet Union. The large reserves of
 metallic ore and crude petroleum have promoted the
 rapid industrial development of the area. This strategic
 area extends from east of the Ural Mountains to west of
 the Volga river, a distance of approximately 570 miles,
 and from Kuybyshev and Magnitogorsk northward
 about 500 miles to Berezniki.
 The chief assets of the Volga-Ural strategic area are
 its large supplies of petroleum and gas (Figure 14) and
 an abundance and great variety of mineral resources. In
 1968 approximately 70% of the country's total crude oil
 production came from this region. Numerous crude oil
 and refined product pipelines as well as refineries and
 petrochemical plants are in the area. Iron ore is the
 principal metallic resource, and the richest deposits are
 on the eastern slopes of the central and southern Urals.
 Nickel and titanium are also mined. The local supply of
 good-quality iron ore and alloy minerals, in addition to
 coal brought in from Karaganda, has made the Ural
 Mountains especially important in the production of
 high-grade steel.
 Nine cities in the strategic area each have a
 population exceeding 250,000. Kuybyshev (population
 1,047,000 in 1970), a major port on the Volga river, is
 the largest producer of refined petroleum products in
 the U.S.S.R. and ranks second as a producer of roller
 and ball bearings. The city is important as a center for
 telecommunications, the integrated aircraft industry,
 guided-missile production, the aerospace industry, and
 the  manufacture of machine tools,  armaments,
 electrical equipment, and motor vehicles. A major
 rocket-engine testing complex is in the northwest
 environs, and one of the country's largest hydroelectric
 powerplants is near the city. Sverdlovsk (population
 1,026,000 in 1970) is one of the leading industrial,
 transportation, and telecommunication centers in the
 U.S.S.R. The city is the second largest producer of
 refined copper and is a major producer of metallurgical
 and oilfield equipment,  heavy machinery, steel,
 armaments,  electrical equipment, and chemicals.
 Situated in a natural gateway through the Ural
 Mountains, the city is a focal point for rail and highway
 traffic between the European U.S.S.R. and Siberia.
 Chelyabinsk (population 874,000 in 1970) has industrial

 plants that specialize in metallurgy, machine building,
 and armaments. It also has a large iron and steel plant
 and is a major railroad center. Kazan' (population
 869,000 in 1970) is a nationally significant industrial
 center and transshipment point on the Volga river. It is
 the largest producer of polyethylene in the U.S.S.R. and
 is a major producer of airplanes, turbine engines, and
 phenol. One of the largest shipyards on the Volga is near
 the city. Perm' (population 850,000 in 1970) is a
 nationally significant producer of war materiel; one of
 the U. S. S. R.'s largest munitions plants and a large
 armaments plant are located there. Other important
 installations  produce  aircraft  engines,  refined
 petroleum products, chemicals, and heavy machinery. It
 is also a major inland port. Ufa (population. 773,000 in
 1970) is mainly an oil-refining center but also contains
 two aircraft engine plants. One of the engine plants is
 also engaged in the production of guided missile
 propulsion equipment. Izhevsk (population 422,000 in
 1970) is the largest producer of small arms and
 automatic weapons in the U.S.S.R. It also produces
 motor vehicles, machinery, and construction materials.

 Approved For Release 2008/09/08: CIA-RDP08SO1 350R0001 00090001-7
 Nizhniy Tagil (population 378,000 in 1970) contains a
 large steel mill, a railroad freight-car plant, and
 factories producing  tanks  and  artillery shells.
 Magnitogorsk (population 364,000 in 1970) is the site of
 the largest steel mill in the country and has numerous
 iron mines in the vicinity. Throughout the strategic
 area, smaller industrial towns are engaged principally
 in the manufacture of products connected with the iron,
 steel, and petroleum industries. A large chemical plant
 at Berezniki, which also contains a magnesium refinery,
 utilizes local potash deposits. This chemical plant and
 another at Krasnotur'insk (outside the area at 59?46'N.,
 60?12'E.) are producing heavy water for the atomic
 energy program. A plutonium production plant and a
 uranium isotope separation plant are at Kyshtym and
 Verkh-Neyvinskiy, respectively. Production of electric
 power in the strategic area utilizes coal, oil, and gas
 from  local fields  and  coal from  northeastern
 Kazakhstan.  Some powerplants also use gas from
 Central Asian and West Siberian gasfields. There are
 large hydroelectric stations on the Kama and Volga
 rivers.
 Most of the transportation lines that link the
 European U.S.S.R. with Siberia pass through the Volga-
 Ural strategic area. These lines consist mainly of
 railroads, which are also the most important means of
 transportation within the strategic area, and a few less
 important highways and navigable rivers.
 4. Leningrad
 The Leningrad strategic area (Figure 15) is an
 important transportation, industrial, and cultural center
 located at the head of the Gulf of Finland, a narrow arm
 of the Baltic Sea. The area can be approached from the
 west through the Gulf of Finland, but this relatively
 narrow water approach is guarded by numerous Soviet
 defensive installations.
 Leningrad is the second largest city in the U.S.S.R.
 (population 3,513,000 in 1970). It has the most extensive
 port facilities in the country and is the Baltic Sea
 terminus of an inland waterway system which links it
 with the White, Black, and Caspian Seas. Manufactur-
 ing in the city consists of the production of precision
 instruments, optical and electrical equipment, heavy
 industrial machinery, machine tools, and armaments.
 Leningrad is also a nationally important center of the
 chemical industry and produces basic chemicals,
 mineral fertilizers, plastics, synthetic rubber, and
 pharmaceuticals. The city is one of the two largest
 centers of scientific, technological, and educational
 facilities in the U.S.S.R. Leningrad is the foremost
 shipbuilding center of the country;  the shipyards
 produce many types of ships, including cargo vessels,
 submarines, tankers, destroyers, and minesweepers, and
 have built an atomic icebreaker. A civil airfield and
 many military airfields are dispersed around the city.
 About 15 miles west of Leningrad is the fortress of
 Kronshtadt, which is located on an island that serves as
 an operational base for the Soviet Baltic Fleet. The
 naval base has extensive storage facilities, including
 several ordnance depots. The island has the largest ship-
 repair facility and most extensive drydocking facilities
 in the country.
 5. Baku
 An important petroleum area, the Baku strategic area
 (Figure 16) is situated on the west coast of the Caspian
 Sea and has had a nationally significant role as a
 supplier of fuel for the Soviet economy. More recently
 the area has played a greater role in refining and
 processing crude oil from other regions.
 Baku (population 847,000 in 1970), the most
 important city in the strategic area, is one of the largest
 petroleum-refining centers and a leading producer of
 heavy oilfield equipment in the Soviet Union. One of
 the largest concentrations of refined petroleum products
 and crude oil storage facilities in the country is located
 in Baku and its environs. Offshore oilfields (Figure 17)
 supply over half of Azerbaijan crude oil production.
 Chemical plants, closely associated with the petroleum
 industry, produce sulfuric acid, oxygen, acetylene,
 synthetic rubber, caustic soda, iodine, and pharmaceu-
 tical products. The city is the main port and naval base
 on the Caspian Sea. The shipyards within the port
 provide the most complete shipbuilding and repair
 facilities on the Caspian Sea coast. The Baku strategic
 area is the terminus of a double-track Transcaucasia
 railroad line,  controls the railroad and highway
 connections to Iran, and is the eastern terminus of
 pipelines and a railroad that lead from Baku to the
 Black Sea port of Batumi. Four military airfields and a
 seaplane station are located in or near the city.
 6. Tashkent
 The Tashkent strategic area (Figure 18) is an
 important industrial, petroleum-producing, and mining
 area in south-central U.S.S.R. Only 70 miles from the
 Communist China border, this strategic area is isolated
 from other parts of the U.S.S.R. by deserts to the west
 and north. It is bounded on the east and south by the
 rugged Tien Shan. The industrial significance of this
 area has increased greatly since World War II.
 There are oilfields near Fergana, and oil and natural
 gas fields near Andizhan. Coal is mined near Angren.
 Other mineral deposits have been exploited, including
 sulfur,  zinc,  copper, tungsten, and molybdenum.
 Mercury and uranium ores are mined in the mountains
 south of Fergana.
 Tashkent (population 1,385,000 in 1970) is the largest
 city in the strategic area. The city contains a nuclear
 research center, an aircraft plant, an electron-tube
 plant, and a storage-battery plant. Tractors, excavators,
 paper, and cotton textiles are produced in the city.
 Chimkent (population 247,000 in 1970) is the largest
 lead smelting and refining center in the U.S.S.R. and
 one of the most important industrial and commercial
 centers of the Kazakh S.S.R. It produces machinery,
 construction materials, textiles, processed agricultural
 products, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals. It is also an
 important junction of national transportation lines and

 FIGURE 15. Leningrad strategic area
 is the site of a very important military airfield. It
 contains several colleges and administrative and
 cultural centers.
 Other significant industries in the strategic area
 include a metallurgical plant in Bekabad, construction
 machinery plants at Andizhan, a superphosphate plant
 at Kokand, and petroleum refineries at Fergana.
 The major railroad in the area connects Krasnovodsk,
 on the Caspian Sea, and Tashkent with the Kuznetsk
 strategic area.  The rail connection from central
 European U.S.S.R., extending through Kuybyshev, joins
 this line at Tashkent.
 7. Kuznetsk
 The Kuznetsk strategic area (Figure 19) is the most
 important mining and manufacturing district east of the
 Volga-Ural strategic area. Its industrial development is
 based primarily on the coal deposits around Kemerovo
 and Novokuznetsk. In addition to the Kuznetsk Basin,
 the strategic area includes the adjacent Novosibirsk-
 Barnaul manufacturing belt and the city of Tomsk. The
 most important industry in the strategic area is the
 manufacture of iron and steel, but nonferrous
 metallurgical industries such as zinc, tin, and aluminum
 are also significant. The iron mines near Tashtagol have
 increased the significance of this strategic area. Coke
 production, based on the coalfields centered around
 Prokop'yevsk, Anzhero-Sudzhensk, Leninsk-Kuznetskiy,
 and Kiselevsk, is the basis of gas, chemical, and
 fertilizer production in the area.
 There are six towns in the strategic area with
 populations exceeding 250,000. Novosibirsk (population
 1,161,000 in 1970) is one of the largest cities in the
 U.S.S.R. and the largest producer of refined uranium
 and  tin.  It  is  a  major machine-building and'
 metalworking center; factories also produce electronic
 and optical equipment. The city contains textile mills,
 extensive stockyards and slaughterhouses, and large
 flour mills. It is a major telecommunication center and
 the headquarters for the Siberian military district. The
 Trans-Siberian railroad crosses the north-flowing Ob'
 river at Novosibirsk. The city is also an important river
 port and the northern terminus of the railroad from the
 Tashkent strategic area. A large scientific center, one of
 the largest in the world, is located south of the city.
 Barnaul (population 439,000 in 1970), a port on the Ob'
 river, is one of the largest producers of diesel engines
 and high-pressure boilers in the U.S.S.R. The city also
 contains plants that manufacture railroad cars, small
 arms  ammunition,  and  textiles.  Novokuznetsk
 (population 499,000 in 1970) is a major producer of iron,
 steel, aluminum, and coke. Kemerovo (population
 385,000 in 1970) is an important center of the Soviet
 coke-chemical industry,  and a manufacturer of
 munitions, high explosives, chlorine, nitric acid, and

 Prokop'yevsk (population 275,000 in 1970) is a major
 coal center, producing about 40% of the annual coal
 yield in the Kuznetsk Basin. A large zinc smelter is
 located at Belovo.
 8. Baykal
 The Baykal strategic area (Figure 20), which extends
 along the Trans-Siberian railroad for about 625 miles,
 derives its importance from its few but significant
 transportation junctions and from-the Soviet industrial
 policy of locating plants along this route.
 Seven centers-Cheremkhovo, Usol'ye Sibirskoye,
 Angarsk, Irkutsk, Ulan-Ude, Petrovsk-Zabaykal'skiy,
 and Chita-are served directly by the Trans-Siberian
 railroad; Irkutsk, Ulan-Ude, Chita, and Angarsk are the
 most important. Irkutsk (population 451,000 in 1970) is
 a major railroad classification and repair center, a hub
 of domestic and international air routes, and the
 leading port on the Angara river. It is also an important
 industrial center, whose products include aircraft,
 metallurgical and mining equipment, and radio
 equipment. A large aluminum refinery is located near
 the city. Irkutsk is also the site of two major airfields,
 many barracks, and military supply depots. Ulan-Ude
 (population 254,000 in 1970) is a major transportation
 and industrial center. It is at a strategic junction of the
 Trans-Siberian railroad and an important railroad and
 highway extending to the U.S.S.R.-Mongolia border.
 The city is also the site of many barracks, storage
 facilities, a major locomotive and railroad-car repair
 plant, an aircraft-assembly plant, and several large
 plants producing consumer goods. Chita (population
 242,000 in 1970) is a large military center. The city

 contains extensive troop-billeting facilities and military
 supply depots, an air defense sector headquarters, and
 two military airfields. The city also contains a large
 railroad repair center and is the terminus of roads from
 the U.S.S.R.-Mongolia border. Angarsk (population
 204,000 in 1970) is the site of a uranium isotope
 separation plant, a large petroleum refinery, a plastics
 plant,  a nitrogenous fertilizer plant, and several
 important construction materials plants. Cheremkhovo
 is the site of a large battery plant.  Petrovsk-
 Zabaykal'skiy is the site of the largest steel plant in
 central Siberia..A chemical plant is located at Usol'ye-
 Sibirskoye.
 Effective exploitation of the coal mines between
 Cheremkhovo and Irkutsk is dependent on uninter-
 rupted operation of the Trans-Siberian railroad. This
 consideration is equally pertinent to the tungsten and
 molybdenum mines near Ulan-Ude, the uranium mines
 north of Petrovsk-Zabaykal'skiy, and the other rich
 mines, chiefly lead, zinc, and rare metal ores, near
 Chita. Several railroad tunnels near the southern end of
 Lake Baykal are critical bottlenecks.
 The Bratsk hydroelectric powerplant, located about
 225 miles north of the strategic area, is the second
 largest powerplant in the world and supplies much of
 the electric power used in the strategic area.
 9. Far Eastern
 The Far Eastern strategic area (Figure 21) fronts on
 the Sea of Japan, partly parallels the Communist China
 border, and extends about 600 miles from the coast near
 Vladivostok in the south to Komsomol'sk in the north.
 Vladivostok (population 442,000 in 1970) is the most
 important naval base, the largest ship-repair center,
 and the second largest commercial port in the eastern
 U.S.S.R. The excellently equipped port, which is kept
 open in winter by icebreakers, is the eastern terminus of
 the Trans-Siberian railroad. The city contains extensive
 storage facilities for refined petroleum products,
 munitions, and general stores, several naval training
 installations, and many billeting facilities. Air facilities
 include seaplane bases and many fighter bases. Major
 industries in the Vladivostok area are shipbuilding and
 repair, food canning, and numerous light industries,
 largely connected with fishing enterprises. In addition,
 there are industries producing electrical equipment and
 munitions.
 Nakhodka (population 105,000 in 1970) is the largest
 commercial port on the Pacific coast of the U.S.S.R. It
 has extensive wharfage, mechanized cargo-handling
 facilities, and a military port capacity of 36,000 long
 tons of general cargo per day. It is also a naval base for
 patrol craft.  The city contains extensive storage
 facilities for refined petroleum products, general stores,
 munitions, and torpedoes, and numerous billeting
 facilities. Major industries include shipbuilding and
 repair, fishing, fish processing, sawmills, and a tin can
 factory.
 Khabarovsk (population 437,000 in 1970) is a major
 transportation center on the Trans-Siberian railroad

 and the principal industrial, oil-distribution, telecom-
 munication, and commercial center in the Soviet Far
 East; the port facilities are the largest on the Amur
 river. Industries of national significance include the
 manufacture of diesel engines, agricultural machinery,
 and electric wire and cable. The city also produces
 machine tools, power machinery, heating equipment,
 and  refined  petroleum  products.  Komsomol'sk
 (population 218,000 in 1970) is one of the major urban
 areas in the Soviet Far East. Situated on the Amur river,
 it contains the largest shipyard in eastern Siberia. Other
 nationally significant installations include the second
 largest manufacturer of submarine batteries and the
 third largest producer of jet fighter planes. The city
 derives additional importance as a producer of foundry
 equipment and as the site of the only steel plant and one
 of the two petroleum refineries in eastern Siberia..
 Other important centers are scattered throughout the
 strategic area and include Ussuriysk, at the junction of
 the Trans-Siberian railroad and the line that extends

 D. Internal routes (C)
 The selected internal routes (Figure 22) are the
 easiest avenues of movement between strategic areas,
 from land and sea approaches to strategic areas, and
 between internal routes. Most of the roads considered
 are improved and are accompanied by railroads over
 most of their lengths. Roads and railroads are greatly
 influenced by seasonal conditions.
 Offroad dispersal and cross-country movement are
 also greatly influenced by seasonal factors such as snow
 during the winter months and flooding during spring
 thaw. Conditions vary from good to fair in the plains
 regions to poor in the mountain and hill regions which
 are heavily forested and extremely rugged in places.
 Detailed information on internal routes is given in
 Figure 23.
 E. Approaches
 The perimeter of the U.S.S.R. consists of about 12,600
 miles of land boundaries and approximately 29,000
