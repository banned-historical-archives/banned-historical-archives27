 WEDNESDAY, MAY 16, 1962
 U.S. SENATE,
 SUBCOMMITTEE To INVESTIGATE THE ADMINISTRATION
 OF THE INTERNAL SECURITY ACT AND OTHER INTERNAL
 SECURITY LAWS, OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,
 Washington, D.C.
 The subcommittee met= pursuant to call, at 11:05 a.m., in room 2300,
 New Senate Office Building, Senator Thomas J. Dodd, presiding.
 Present : Senators Dodd and John L. McClellan.
 Also present: J. G. Sourwine, chief counsel; Benjamin Mandel,
 director of r. esearch ; and Frank Schroeder chief investigator.
 Senator DODD. The hearing will come to or ?der.
 We are pleased that you could come here, Miss Knight.
 Mr. SonRwINE. May I respectfully suggest, Mr. Chairman, that
 both Miss Knight and Mr. Johnson be sworn and identified on the.
 record.
 Senator DODD. Raise your right hands, please. Do you each solemn-
 ly swear that the testimony you will give here will be the truth,,
 the whole truth, and nothing but. the truth, so help you God?
 TESTIMONY OF FRANCES G. KNIGHT, DIRECTOR, PASSPORT OFFICE,
 DEPARTMENT OF STATE; AND ROBERT D. JOHNSON, CHIEF
 COUNSEL, PASSPORT OFFICE
 Miss KNIGHT. I do.
 Mr. JOHNSON. I do.
 I am Robert D. Johnson, chief counsel for the Passport Office.
 Mr. SOURWINE. And you are Frances Knight?
 Miss KNIGHT. Yes, sir.  My name is Frances G. Knight. I am
 Director of the Passport Office of the Department of State. I have
 been Director of that Office since May 1, 1955.
 Mr. SOURWINE. Miss Knight, we are interested in the operations
 and problems of the Passport Office, with special reference to in-
 ternal security.
 You have, I believe  hrough the proper channels, been notified of
 the general area of le- committee's interest.  The members of the
 committee know you and have for years, and the committee wants
 your personal opinion and experience. If you care to make a general
 statement respecting these matters here at the beginning of the hear-
 ing, I think, with the permission of the Chair, it would be appro-
 priate.

 Senator DODD. Oh, yes, glad to hear anything you want to tell us,
 Miss Knight.
 Miss KNIGHT. Thank you: Mr. Chairman. I know generally what
 the committee is interested in, but I do not know exactly what you
 wish to discuss.          So I have prepared some notes dealing with the
 issuance of the passport. And~I have arranged these notes in a chron-
 ological order. I believe that the sequence of these actions will pro-
 vide a very useful background on the policies, the regulations, and
 other pertinent actions affecting the entire question of issuing pass-
 ports.  May I proceed I
 Senator DODD. Yes; of course.

 Senator DODD. Back on the record.
 Miss KNIGHT (continuing). I have worked for the Federal Govern-
 ment for 22 years in various positions involving administrative work
 and public relations.  I am not a lawyer and I am not on the policy-
 making level in the Department, therefore, I can answer questions and
 speak only from actual experience gained in operating and administer-
 in g the Passport Office.
 Mr. Johnson, the Chief Counsel of the Passport Office, who is here
 with me, is more familiar than I am with technical legal details. Be-
 tween the two of us, I hope we can give you the information you
 seek.
 The act of July 3, 1926 (see. 211a, title 22, United States Code),
 places authority to issue passports in the Secretary of State under
 such rules as the President may prescribe. The Executive Order No.
 7856, under which we are operating, was issued by President Roosevelt
 on March 31, 1938.  Virtually the entire order, consisting of 127
 paragraphs, is taken up with detailed, technical provisions relating
 to passport applications and supporting data such as the size and
 number of passport photographs to be submitted, how a married
 woman should sign her name and other minutiae, some of which are
 impractical and obsolete under present-day conditions.
 Following a special statutory court decision in the District of
 Columbia in July 1952, which held that apassport could not be re-
 voked without notice and a hearing, the Secretary of State issued
 partially revised regulations in August 1952, under which passports
 were denied to Communist Party members and supporters of the world
 Communist movement. A hearing procedure in the Passport Office
 with subsequent right to appeal to & 'Board of Passport Apppeals was
 also provided.  In June 1958, the Supreme Court, in the BriehI-Kent
 decision, held that there was no statutory base for these regulations.
 It is my opinion that the inconsistencies and arbitrariness of Pass-
 port Office procedures in denying passports in the past have had a con-
 siderable bearing on the confusion and dissension which clouded this
 issue in the last few years.
 The travel pattern, volume, and mode of transportation in the
 United States, as well as in the entire world, have changed consider-
 ably since 1926. The Passport Office has been shunted around in vari-
 ous areas of the Department of State. It was first called a bureau;
 then a division; then a permits office; then back to a division and since
 1952, it has been known as the Passport Office.

 STATE DEPARTMENT SECURITY                .231
 Over the years the Passport Office has grown in importance as a pub-
 lic service to American citizens, as a revenue-producing operation and
 a public relations asset, not only to the Department of State, but to the
 entire Federal Government. When I became Director in May 1955,
 the Passport Office was in dire need of help. With the sympathetic
 support of Congress, the Office was completely reorganized, modern-
 ized, and streamlined to cope with the tremendous workload thrust
 upon it by the jet age.
 In March and April of 1956, and again in June 1960, the Senate Gov-
 ernment Operations Committee published reports and hearings on the
 Passport Office, giving in considerable detail its past history, its func-
 tions, its administration, and operation. Some specific and, in my esti-
 mation, highly desirable recommendations for legislation were made.
 Unfortunately, no action was taken and the Passport Office continued
 with a bureau framework which was not geared to cope with or support
 a fast moving direct line operation.
 We have, however, fared reasonably well, because we have a very
 measurable product-applications received and passports issued.
 There is little argument with an office that issues 850,000 passports a
 year and processes applications within 3 days after receipt.  Our
 busiest day this year was Monday, May 7, when we received 8,023 appli-
 cations in the 1 day, and 2 days later the passports were in the mail.
 We bring into the U.S. Treasury a little over $61/2 million per year, at
 a cost to the Government of less than $21/2 million. There is little fault
 to find with an office that, in the past 7 years, has increased its employee
 productivity by 56.7 percent. Nevertheless, I believe additional im-
 provements can be made, but these are now more or less dependent on
 the administrative climate within the Department.
 The more important and serious problem facing us today is the lack
 of passport legislation, the lack of a revised Executive order, and the
 lack of rules and regulations under which we can operate honestly,
 efficiently, and expeditiously. In the 7 years that I have been Director
 of the Passport Office, I have reported to a series of six administrators.
 This has not been easy and the lack of continuity has taken its toll out
 of good management and progress.
 In the past 5 years I have tried to push through, by every means I
 know2 a revised Executive order and updated rules and regulations
 pertaining to passport issuance. Only once did this package reach the
 desk of an Under Secretary, but no action was taken until early this
 year. Before I discuss this action, I want to illustrate some of the more
 glaring omissions which put the Director of the Passport Office in the
 position of operating in violation, or pretty close to it, of the existing
 but obsolete regulations.
 For instance, there has never been a statutory deleation of author-
 ity to the Director of the Passport Office. 'While- the Director is
 charged with the issuance of passports, the operation of the national
 office, its field offices, the direction of passport and citizenship work
 overseas, the regulations state that the Secretary of State appoints
 passport agents. This has never been the case, but there is, in fact, no
 delegation of authority to the Director to perform any of these duties.
 R ere is no statutory definition of the U.S. passport. This omis-
 sion is serious when it is necessary for the Passport Office to pick up

 a passport from the bearer for a valid reason. The question has been
 posed as to whether the passport is an official Government document,
 or does it belong to the bearer once it is issued?
 Another discre ancy, in my opinion, is the fact that, by law, State
 courts charge a $2 fee for the execution of a passport application.
 Federal courts and the Passport Office and its agencies charge a $1
 execution fee. This has caused considerable public confusion. The;
 fee charged for the execution of a passport application should be uni-
 form, regardless of where the service is rendered.
 These and other matters could be cleared up by proper legislation.
 From practical experience, I would strongly recommend that criteria
 for pass ort refusal and limitation be spelled out by statute to pro
 vide the department. of State with a general frame of reference.
 Now I would like to document the Passport Office procedures on
 denials prior to 1952; between 1952 and 1956; subsequent to 1956, in-
 cluding the latest regulations which went into effect January 12, 1962.
 regulations without refer-
 It would be difficult to discuss the present
 ence to our practical experiences with the previous ones:
 DENIAL PROCEDURES PRIOR TO 1952
 Prior to 1952, with reliance on the absolute discretionary authority
 of the Secretary, the Passport Office, in denying a passport, merely
 informed the applicant that "it was not in the best interests of the
 United States" that he should have a passport. The applicant was
 not informed of the nature of the information upon which the action
 was based. There was no provision for appeal from the refusal.
 The free exercise of this discretion was first tested in the Bauer v.
 Acheson case (106 F. Supp. 445 (1951) ). Miss Bauer, a naturalized
 U.S. citizen, was employed as a journalist. in Europe from 1944 to
 June 1951. On June 4, 1951, her passport was revoked without notice
 or hearing. No reason for the action was given other than in the opin-
 ion of the Secretary "her activities are contrary to the best interests.
 of the United States."
 A three-judge statutory court sitting in the District of Columbia
 held that the right to travel abroad was protected by the fifth amend-
 ment to the Constitution and the cancellation of an outstanding pass-
 port., without a hearing, deprived the bearer of liberty without due
 process of law.
 The court also made this pertinent comment:
 This court is not willing to subscribe to the vtew that the Executive power
 Includes any absolute discretion which may encroach on the Individual's con-
 stitutional rights, or that the Congress has power to confer such absolute dis-
 cretion.  We hold that, like other curtailments of personal liberty for the public
 good, the regulation of passports must be administered, not arbitrarily or capri-
 ciously, but fairly, applying the law equally to all citizens without discrimina-
 tion, and with due process adapted to the exigencies of the situation.
 As a result of the Bauer decision, the Secretary of State on August
 28, 1952, prorhulgated regulations (sees. 51.135-51.143, title 22, CFR),
 which placed limitations upon the issuance of passports to persons.
 supporting the. world Communist movement. The regulations pro-

 vided that the individual should be informed of the nature of the
 information upon which the action was based; for an informal hear-
 ing in the Passport Office and the right of subsequent appeal to a
 Board of Passport Appeals. The regulations also provided that at
 .any stage of the passport proceedings, an applicant could be required
 to furnish an affidavit with respect to present and past membership
 in the Communist Party.
 In practice, however, the records show that an applicant was
 merely informed of the tentative denial of his application in the
 language of the regulations-"in your case it is alleged you are a
 Communist."
 The affidavit with respect to present and past Communist Party
 membership was used indiscriminately and on the basis of the flim-
 siest. information.
 The informal hearing merely consisted of an across-the-desk inter-
 view of the applicant by a Passport Office attorney. A memorandum
 outlining the gist of the conversation was prepared, often a number
 of days after the interview had taken place. The entire procedure
 was very casual.
 The final refusal action by the Passport Office likewise was couched
 in the language of the regulations with the one change, a notice of
 right of appeal to the Board of Passport Appeals. A circular con-
 taining the Board's rules was enclosed with the letter.
 In 1956, the Passport Office, taking advantage of its reorganization,
 and improved staffing, made some changes in the procedures affecting
 denials. An applicant was informed in detail of the nature of the
 .derogatory information consonant, of course, with security considera-
 tions. For example, he was informed- of the period of Communist
 Party membership, the particular branch (as distinguished from
 unit) of the party, his official capacity, the nature of his activities
 financial contributions, and the like. The applicant was also advised
 of his entitlement to an informal hearing and of representation by
 counsel.
 The informal hearing procedure was established along the follow-
 "ini lines :
 the Chief of the Passport Office Legal Division acted as a hearing
 officer. The attorney in charge of the security branch presented the
 case. The passport application, tentative refusal letter, correspond-
 ence between the applicant and the Passport Office, public source data,
 rand a resume of the classified information were all entered into the
 record.
 The applicant was afforded the opportunity to answer any of the
 allegations made against him, to present any relevant information
 and to testify in his own behalf.
 A verbatim transcript was prepared and a copy given to the appli-
 cant or his attorney.
 In the case of a final refusal, the applicant was informed in detail
 ,of the basis for the refusal. He was informed of his right to appeal
 to the Board of Passport Appeals. A circular setting forth the
 Board's rules was enclosed with the letter.

 On January 10, 1956, the Secretary amended the 1952 regulations
 with section 51.136 (title 22 CFR) which placed limitations on the
 issuance of passports to persons going abroad whose activities would
 violate the laws of the United States; be p judicial to the orderly
 conduct of foreign relations; or otherwise be prejudicial to the in
 terests of the United States.
 An applicant who came within the provisions of this regulation
 was also afforded the right to an informal hearing and appeal to the
 Board of Passport Appeals.
 Subsequent to the promulgation of the so-called Communist regu-
 lations in August 1952, passports were withdrawn and the individual
 was informed along the lines of the tentative refusal of a passport
 application.
 The withdrawal was affected either by the Immigration and Nat-
 uralization Service lifting the passport at the port of entry or by
 agents of the Departments Office of Security. The individual con-
 cerned was orally informed that the passport was withdrawn at the
 request of the Passport Office, but no basis for the action was given.
 No hearing or review procedure was provided for contesting the
 withdrawal action, unless specifically requested by the person in in-
 terest or his attorney.
 WITHDRAWAL OF A PASSPORT SUBSEQUENT TO JANUARY 1956
 By the 'middle of 1955, the Director of the Passport Office realized
 that radical changes would have to be made in the procedures relat
 ing to the denial or withdrawal of a passport. There was no ques-
 tion but that the old procedures were arbitrary and were leading up
 to legal difficulties.  The time was late, but nevertheless, in January
 1956, we instituted procedures which closely conformed to our tradi-
 tional concepts of due process.
 Therefore, subsequent to January 1956, the Office of Security was
 utilized to withdraw passports when necessary.  A letter was ad-
 dressed and hand delivered to the bearer of the passport, advising
 him of the tentative withrawal and requesting him to give his pass-
 port to the Department's representative. The basis for this action
 was outlined in the letter and at the same time he was advised of his
 right to an informal hearing before the action became final.
 Only in a few cases was the Immigration and Naturalization Serv-
 ice requested to pick up the passport at the port of entry.  In these
 instances, the same procedure of advice and notice was followed.
 It is interesting to note that after the institution of these procedures,
 not once were our actions seriously challenged in the courts on pro-
 cedural grounds.
 At the time of the Brieh,l-gent decision (July 16, 1958) we had ap-
 proximately 65 passport applications on hand which would have been
 processed under the so-called Communist regulations. These involved
 alleged Communist Party membership as well as various other acti-
 vities in support of the Communist movement. This does not mean,
 however, that all 65 applications would have been denied. In some

 STATE D
 cases, we were in the process of assembling additional data, and in
 others we would have asked the applicants for clarification of their
 activities.. No doubt some of these applicants would have given us
 satisfactory proof that they were no longer active in the promotion
 of communism. On the other hand, some would have reached the ten-
 tative refusal stage. The Supreme Court decision resulted in granting
 passports to all such applicants.
 I am very reluctant to give out figures, because it is so easy to slip
 into a numbers game. A qualifying word can change any figure, de-
 pending pretty much on what a witness is trying to prove. However,
 our records would indicate that from June 16, 1958, through Decem-
 ber 31, 1958, 158 applications would have been processed under the
 Communist regulations had they been in force. In 1959, 175 would
 have been so processed and in 1960, the estimated figure was 117.  In
 1961, 96 applications came within this category.
 This brings us to the Supreme Court decision of June 5, 1961, up-
 holding the constitutionality of the order by the Subversive Activities
 Control Board requiring the Communist Party of the United States
 to register under the provisions of the Internal Security Act of 1950.
 In the Passport Act, section 6 of the act is relevant. Subsection (a)
 of this section provides that when a Communist organization is regis-
 tered under the act or is the subject of a final order of the Subversive
 Activities Control Board requiring registration, it is unlawful for a
 member of such organization to apply for a passport or the renewal
 of a passport. It also makes it unlawful for such a person to use or
 attempt to use a passport already issued.
 Subsection (b) provides that when an organization is registered
 or required to register as a Communist-action organization under the
 act, it is unlawful for an officer of the Government to issue a passport
 to,any person when he knows or has reason to believe that such per-
 son is a member of such an organization.
 I would like to call your attention specifically to the language "has
 reason to believe" in subsection (b).  I believe this to be the crux of
 the entire section insofar as the Passport Office is concerned.
 I have with me a detailed chronology of Passport Office actions start-
 ing June 5, 1961, and carrying us through to January 12, 1962, when
 the Department's new regulations appeared in the Federal Register.
 Without dwelling on these individual actions, I believe it is worth
 noting that the Passport Office, once again had an opportunity on
 December 15, 1961, to submit to the Legal Adviser's Office, its pro-
 posed revisions of the Executive order and the Department's rules
 and regulations governing the issuance of passports. Once again we
 stressed the urgent need for revisions and in our accompanying memo-
 randum of that date we pointed out that we were submitting regula-
 tions which were not only clear, and concise but regulations which
 could be administered uniformly in all the important areas of pass-
 port and citizenship.
 On December 28, 1961, the Passport Office received from the Legal
 Adviser a draft revision of the Communist section of the regulations.
 We were told that a study of the comprehensive package we had sub-
 mitted would take too long and only the regulations relating to the
 Communist issue were of immediate importance.  The Legal Adviser's

 STATE DEPARTMENT SECURITY
 Office had rewritten the Communist part of the regulations, though
 many paragraphs were identical to those issued in 1952.
 The most important and significant changes, however, established
 'confrontation and the right to cross-examine witnesses, and barred
 the use of classified information to deny a passport.  We pointed out
 that these changes nullified any practical and workable control of
 travel by American Communists.  We were assured that the Legal
 Advisers Office was working closely with the Department of Justice on
 the wording of the proposed regulations.
 On January 4, 1962, a final draft of the regulations was submitted
 to the Passport Office for concurrence, which we refused.  The same
 -day I sent a memorandum to Mr. Michel Cieplinski Acting Adminis-
 trator of the Bureau of Security and Consular A$tairs, of which we
 .are a component office.  In this paper, I set forth my reasons for not
 concurring with the proposed regulations. Dir. Cieplinski supported
 the Passport Office position.  On January 6, 1962, the Passport Office
 was informed that the Department of State position in favor of con-
 frontation and cross-examination of witnesses in the Communist cases,
 was supported by the Department of Justice.  At the same time we
 were advised that the Department of Justice interpretation of the law
 was binding and that we were to deny a passport only on the basis of
 information that could be disclosed to the applicant.
 In view of the criminal sanctions involved, the deputy Under Sec-
 retary of State, has given sympathetic understanding to my position
 and has assumed the responsibility of ordering me to issue the pass-
 port when under the regulations the Department finds no other alter-
 native.
 I made it abundantly clear at that time that most, if not all of our
 information regarding Communist Party activities is furnished by
 the FBI.  In transmitting this information, the FBI specifically en-
 joins its distribution outside the Department of State.
 Any regulation which states that we cannot consider confidential
 information makes it virtually impossible to deny pas71
 ort facilities
 to members of the Communist Party, U.S.A., as provided y law. The
 only exceptions would be a handfuf of Communist Party functionaries
 on the national level who, because of their recognized positions and
 operations, are more or less impotent insofar as their subversive effect
 is concerned  These individuals are symbols or figureheads of the
 Communist Party and the glare of publicity over the years has dulled
 their influence to a great extent.
 The real danger, however, lies in the issuance of passports to the
 relatively unknown, undercover Communists engaged in espionage,
 sabotage, and sedition. These are the people who can and do inesti-
 mable damage to our country at home and abroad.
 On January 7, 1962, the Attorney General was quoted as saying-
 Communist espionage in this country is much more active now than it ever
 has been.
 Mr. J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, was quoted in the Con-
 gressional Record on March 19,1962, as warning that-
 The communist threat from without must not blind us to the communist
 threat from within.  The latter is reaching into the very heart of America
 through its espionage agents and a cunning, defiant, and lawless communist
 Party which is fanatically dedicated to the Marxist cause of world enslavement
 and destruction of the foundations of our Republic.

 These statements are alarming and frustrating when, in the prac-
 tical application of the law, a regulation is developed which in effect,
 forbids us to protect ourselves. We have been instructed that when
 we consider the application of a person whose file indicates Commu-
 nist membership, we must separate, in our minds, the confidential in-
 formation which cannot be used, from the public information which
 can be used, before recommending a denial.
 I, as the issuing officer, am supposed to tailor my "reason to believe
 that the applicant is a member of a Communist organization" to data
 which can be made public regardless of how much classified informa-
 tion is produced by the FBI or other agencies of Government to the
 effect that the individual is a dangerous Communist. If the proof
 cannot be used in open hearings, with the right to cross-examine wit-
 nesses, I have been instructed to disregard it. In other words, I am
 expected to read the file, dismiss the classified information and base
 my decision on what can be best described as generalized public infor-
 mation. I maintain that no one can do this in good conscience and
 this places me in a difficult position between the law and the Govern-
 ment's expert legal advisers who interpret the law. It is a fact that
 under the present regulations, the more treacherous and vicious and
 destructive the individual may be, the less likely it is that he will be
 denied a passport.
 It is not difficult to understand why information regarding the
 activities of the most dangerous Communist operators in the United
 States is classified and cannot be made public.  It certainly is not
 difficult to understand why the FBI will not produce its informant
 agents and counteragents to be questioned by alleged Communists.
 What is hard to understand is why we are not permitted by law to
 protect ourselves from these people..
 Some editorials, newspaper stories, and comments lauding the new
 passport regulations have been very discouraging because they reveal
 such abysmal ignorance of the true character of.the situation with
 which we are faced. The public has been led to believe that, at long
 last, there are regulations in effect which will prevent the.use of the
 U.S. passport for the benefit or promotion of world communism.
 There appears to be no realization that the few functionaries who may
 get caught in this very ineffective net are relatively unimportant
 They are, in effect, window dressing.
 I think there is a very clear choice and one which should not be too
 hard to make.  Either we make no attempt at protecting the national
 interest by means of the passport, reducing it to an identification
 document and consequently issuing passports to" anyone who can prove
 he is a citizen, or we develop effective legislation which, even though
 it may be challenged in the courts, will once and for all time resolve
 the question as to whether or not there actually exists the will and
 the right to employ every possible means to protect the United States
 of America from the inroads of communism. Only the Congress can
 make this decision.
 Mr. SOUlnvINE. Miss Knight, counsel has purposely avoided break-
 ing into your statement while you were making it. I think this state-
 ment raises a number of questions.  I believe that when the members
 of the committee have had an opportunity to read the record that is

 Mr. SOURWINE. I want to pay my compliments to Mr. Johnson
 who, on January 18, supplied the committee with reprint copies of
 this regulation.
 Now I want to ask Miss Knight-I show you a paper of two pages,
 .the caption being "Passports and Communism." I will ask you, are'
 you familiar with this?
 Miss KNIGHT: Yes, sir. I prepared this "Passports and Commu-

 December 1, 1961: Passport Office sent a memorandum to Mr. Abram Chayes
 recommending the withdrawal of passports issued to individuals on the national
 levels of the communist Party leadership; recommending the issuing of appro-
 priate letters to such individuals concerned, notifying them of the tentative
 withdrawal of their passports and affording them a hearing and right to appeal.
 December 7, 1961: Passport Office sent a memorandum to Mr. Abram Chayes
 recommending that the following statement be placed in all passport application
 forms, registration forms, agency notices, etc.:
 Section 6 of the internal Security Act of 1950 (50 U.B.C. 785) provides a
 severe penalty (fine and/or imprisonment) for a member of the Communist
 Party of the United States who applies for a passport or for the renewal of a
 passport or who uses or attempts to use a passport."
 December 7, 1961: Meeting in legal adviser's office.  Mr. Abram Chayes
 reviewed his conversations with the Department of Justice attorneys.  Mr.
 Chayes advised Miss Knight of the Secretary's interest in not withdrawing
 passports but in having the statute enforced by means of criminal prosecutions
 in due course.
 It. was agreed that the Passport Office prepare a letter for Mr. Chayes' sig-
 nature transmitting to Assistant Attorney General Yeagiey for use to enforce-
 ment of the act, a list of persons holding valid passports who, on the basis of
 Information supplied the Department by the FBI, appear to he within the purview
 of section 6 of the act.
 Mr. Chayes also advised that he would soon assign someone to check the
 passport regulations and was informed by Miss Knight that a complete revision
 of the Executive order and the Secretary's regulations on the issuance of pass-
 ports had been made by the Passport Office and had been held in abeyance
 for over a year pending some action either by the Department or legislative
 branch.  It was agreed that the revisions be checked and brought up to date
 by the Passport Office.  Mr. Chayes agreed to review the Passport Office presenta-
 tion as a matter of urgency.
 December 15, 1961: Mr. Chayes cleared the proposed warnings to be inserted
 In Passport Office forma and a printing order was processed immediately by
 the Passport OMce.  New placards, cards, signs, ? and forms were among the
 documents to have the warning inserted.
 December 15, 1961: Passport Office sent a memorandum to Mr. Abram Chayes
 transmitting an original and one copy of the draft of a new Executive order
 and rules and regulations by the Secretary which are to supersede Executive
 Order No. 7858 issued on April 2, 1938, and regulations Issuedpursuant thereto
 at intervals since April 2,1938.
 December 28, 1061: Meeting in the legal adviser's office with Mr. Meeker and
 Mr. Lowenfeld regarding the immediate issuance of revised regulations dealing
 with the denial of passports to Communists.
 It was decided that sections 51.135 through 51.170 of the regulations on issu-
 ance of passports be reviewed and revised prior to the completion of a compre-
 hensive study of passport regulations and the Executive order of 1938.
 Mr. SouRwINE. I want to ask one question about this.
 Senator DODD. You have identified it as a paper you prepared-a
 copy.
 Miss KwmnT. It is a copy of a paper I prepared, yes.
 Mr. Sounwnrn. I note that there were a number of conferences
 with regard to these new regulations, and I want to ask you just one
 foundation question now.  We can go into more detail when you
 come back.
 Did you, at any of these conferences, agree to or sign the proposed
 new regulations?
 Miss KNIGHT. No, sir; I did not.
 Mr. SouRwiwn. Did you at all times make your disagreement with
 thr proposed new regulations quite clear?
 Miss KNIGHT. I made my disagreement with the regulations quite
 clear.

 Mr. SOURWINE. I want to show you another document, possession
 of which by the committee may surprise you, Miss Knight.  This is a
 two-page paper.               Have you seen that?  I will characterize this, Mr.
 ,Chairman.  This is a draft of a proposed regulation with respect to
 -pass orts.
 Miss KNIGHT. I don't recognize this immediately, sir.  It looks as
 though it might be a part of a memorandum.
 Mr. SouawINE. Do you know who drafted it?
 Miss KNIGHT. No, sir.
 Mr. SOURwINE. And you do not recall its having been presented
 at any meetings ?
 Miss KNIGHT. I don't recall it; no, sir.
 Mr. SOURWINE. It might have been presented and you might not
 .recall it.
 Miss KNIGHT. That is right.
 Mr. SounwINE. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman. I had hoped that Miss
 -Knight might be able to identify this document.
 Let me try Mr. Johnson.
 Mr. Johnson, can you identify this document-the document of
 which this is a copyy ?
 Mr. JOHNSON. It appears to be--I have seen something similar to
 -this, very similar to this, to it. But I just can't say whether I have
 seen this particular document or not.
 Mr. SOURWINE. All right.  You don't know what it is, then.
 Mr. JOHNSON. No, sir.
 Senator DODD. Do you think you have seen the original?
 Miss KNIGHT. If it had a cover sheet on it-it seems to be a part
 of a document.  And I can't recognize it as such.
 Mr. SouRwnNE. All right. Maybe Mr. Chayes, when he appears,
 can identify it.
 Now, Miss Knight, I show you what purports to be a copy of a
 memorandum to Mr. Cieplinski from you, under date of January 4,
 1962.  I will ask you, is that a copy of such a memo-is it what it
 purports to be?  Did you write that memo?
 Miss KNIGHT. Yes, sir; this is my memo of January 4 to Mr. Michel
 Cieplinski.
 Mr. SoURWINE. This was your protest against the new passport
 regulations.
 Miss KNIGHT. Yes. And I make reference to this
 Mr. SOURWINE. I know you make reference to this in the statement
 .you have made already.
 What did Mr. Cieplinski do with this memorandum, if you know.
 Miss KNIGHT. I don't know what he did with the memorandum, but
 I did know that as a result of this memo, he supported the passport
 office position.
 Mr. SouiiwlNE. He supported your position.
 Miss KNIGHT. Yes, sir.
 Mr. SOURWINE. In opposition to the new regulations.
 Miss KNIGHT. Yes, sir.

 Miss KNIGHT. No, I don't.
 Mr. S, orRwiNE. Was Mr. Roger Jones advised of your position that
 if it was determined that a passport should be issued, or renewed for
 an individual whom you knew or had reason to believe was a member
 of the Communist Party, then in each and every case you wanted to
 get specific instructions directly from the Secretary of State.
 Miss KNIO1iT. Yes, sir.  Mr. Roger Jones was advised of that,
 because I told him at a meeting.
 Mr. SounwiiE. And what did he say. What was his position with
 egard to your position?
 my position, and he agreed that he would take the responsibility of
 ordering me to issue a passport in cases where the Department felt
 that it had to do so under the regulations.
 Mr. SouRwirE. Now, if you should be ordered in that manner to
 issue a passport in a case where the law makes it a crime to issue it,
 you would be kind of in trouble, wouldn't you?
 Miss KNIGHT. Yes, sir : I would be in trouble.
 Mr. SoURwI:4E. Have you made. up your mind what you would
 do in such a case?
 Miss KNIGHT. It has already been done, sir, in two cases.
 Mr. SOURWINE. What do you mean?
 Miss KNIGHT. Well, in my position on two passport cases, I have
 indicated that I had reason to believe that the individuals involved
 were members of the Communist Party.
 Mr. SouRwiNE. And you have thereafter been directly ordered to
 issue passports, notwithstanding?
 Miss KNIGHT. Yes, sir.
 Mr. SouRwlNE. And you have done so?
 MISS KNIGHT. Yes, sir.
 Mr. SouRwi.,rE. From whom did you get the orders?
 Miss KNIGHT. From Mr. Roger Jones.
 Mr. SOURWINE. By direction of the Secretary of State?
 Miss KNIGBT. Yes, yes, it was worded "by direction of the Secre-
 tary of State."
 Mr. Souliwi-nm. So you felt that satisfied your requirement that
 you have orders directed from the Secretary.

 Passport Denial to CommunistR.
 During and since the holidays, I have had time to read through all the papery
 which have passed back and forth between the Passport Office and the legal
 adviser's office, relating to the procedures on handling passport applications?
 from persons known or believed to be members of a Communist organization.

 STATE DEPARTMENT SECURITY                  a
 You will recall that during my absence from the office in November 1961, you
 with Mr. Hickey and Mr. Johnson of my staff discussed various facets of this
 matter with Mr. Chayes and other members of the legal adviser's office.
 . About 2 years ago, I started working with members of my legal staff on a
 comprehensive revision of the Executive Order No. 7856, dated March 31, 1938,
 as well as a revision of the Secretary's rules and regulations on the issuance
 of passports.  When this was completed toward the end of 1959, I tried to get
 it through the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs, but was unsuccessful.
 In November of 1960, I brought the revision of the Executive order and the
 Department's rules and regulations governing the issuance of passports up to
 date.  In my opinion, these versions were practical, workable, and protected
 the security of the United States.
 When Mr. Roger Jones came to the Department, I advised him of this revision
 and he suggested that it be held in abeyance until such time as the Department
 could get into a study of the entire passport question. The revisions have been
 in my office ever since.
 On December 7, 1961, during a conference I was having with Mr. Abram
 Chayes, he mentioned that he would get a member of his staff working on a
 revision of the passport rules and regulations.  I told him that the job had
 been done and was fully documented in my office.  As a result, the papers
 prepared by the Passport Office consisting of a new Executive order and revised
 regulations were turned over to Mr. Chayes on December 15, 1961.
 Since that time, it was suggested by the legal adviser and his staff that
 section 51.135 through section 51.170 of the regulations be issued separately and
 in advance of a larger and complete package consisting of the Executive order
 and the rest of the rules and regulations.  The reason being- that the larger
 package is more time consuming and there was an element of urgency in
 spelling out procedures for denial of passports to Communists.
 I have been advised that the proposed amended regulations received today
 (January 4, 1962) comprising section 51.135 through section 51.170 have been
 prepared in accordance with the interpretation of law by the Department of
 Justice.
 In view of these impending passport regulations and Department of Justice
 interpretations, I think I should make my position clear.  According to my
 understanding of the law and with special reference to section 785(b) of the
 Internal Security Act, It is unlawful for me or any other employee of the United
 States to issue a passport to or renew the passport of any 'individual if we
 know or have reason to believe he is a member of the Communist Party.
 The new regulations received today state in part that "the Passport Office
 shall not make use of confidential security information that is not made avail-
 able to the applicant" and that the applicant "be informed of the evidence upon
 which the Passport Office relied as a basis for the tentative denial ; to be in-
 formed of the source of such evidence; and to confront and cross-examine ad-
 verse witnesses."
 Most, if not all (99.9 percent), of our information regarding Communist Party
 activities is furnished by the FBI.  In transmitting the information, the FBI
 specifically enjoins its distribution outside of the Department of State.
 In effect, then, since we cannot rely on confidential information, these regu-
 lations, in my opinion, will make it virtually impossible to deny passport facili-
 ties to members of the Communist Party, U.S.A., as provided by law. The only
 exceptions would be a handful of Communist Party functionaries on the na-
 tional level who, because of their recognized positions and operations, are more
 or less impotent insofar as their subversive influence is concerned. These char-
 acters are symbols or figureheads of the Communist Party and the glare of
 publicity has dulled their influence to some extent.
 The real danger, however, lies in the issuance of passports to the relatively
 unknown, undercover Communists engaged in espionage, sabotage, and sedition.
 These are the people who can and do inestimable damage to our country at home
 and abroad.
 This statement is borne out by the testimony of Mr. J. Edgar Hoover, the
 findings of the Congress set out in the Subversive Activities Control Act, and by
 numerous hearings into Communist Party activities held by various congressional
 committees.
 I have been informed that the legal adviser's office is expecting a letter from
 the Department of Justice today defending their position and allegedly advis-
 ing that the Passport Office would not be held in violation of the law if a passport

 SCURrry
 Is issued or renewed for applicants coming within the purview of section 51.135
 of the Department's regulations, but against whom not sufficiently publicly
 known (unclassified) evidence could be used.
 I do notagree with this interpretation or procedure.  Therefore, I have in-
 structed my staff to document every step taken regarding these individuals when
 and as they become applicants. We will proceed according to the law. If it is
 determined by the Department of State and/or Justice that a passport shall be-
 issued to or renewed for an individual whom we know or have reason to believe
 is a member of the Communist Party then, in each and every such ease, I should
 properly receive specific instructions directly from the Secretary of State to do
 so, since my authority in the passport area is delegated to me by him. .
 Mr. SounwiNE. Miss Knight., after the Supreme Court decisions
 in the passport eases, do you recall that President Eisenhower called
 for congressional legislation to strengthen the hand of the Secretary-
 of State with regard to his passport authority ?
 Miss KNIGHT. Yes, sir.
 Mr. SounwINE. What was the Department's position at that time?
 Was it in favor of passport legislation authorizing denial of passports
 to Communists?
 Miss KNIGHT. Well, that is very hard to say, sir, because in the past
 5 years there has been a great deal of shifting of  setion, and
 Mr. SouRwiNE. You are aware that Mr. John Hanes came u  and
 testified on two different occasions, and testified that the Ie islation
 was urgently needed-he supported the President's position, didn't he?'
 Miss KNIGHT. That is correct.
 Mr. SouRWINE. Now, when did the Department's position change?
 Miss KNIGHT. I don't think I can pinpoint the date ofchange.
 Mr. SGUIIWINE. Were you aware that by early November of 1961, at
 least, the Department, or as a minimum, the office of legal counsel of'
 the Department had arrived at the conclusion that no action on pass-
 port legislation was needed or desirable?
 Miss KNIGHT. I have heard that.
 Mr. SouRwINE. You don't know.
 Miss KNIGHT. I have not been told that definitely.
 Mr. SounwiNE. Can you help the committee any further with regard'
 to this change in position, when it took place?
 Miss KNIGHT. Well, I believe the Department's position may have-
 developed from the Department of Justice interpretation of the Su-
 preme Court decisions and the law. I believe that there have been,
 knowledgeable persons in the Department who believed that under
 the present legislation they have the authority to deny passports to-
 Communists.
 Mr. SouRwINE. It wouldn't surprise you, I am sure, when I tell you
 I am confident that a majority at least of the Congress feels that you-
 not only have authority to deny them, but that you have a mandate to
 deny them.
 Miss Knight, according to the committee's information, passports
 outstanding January 1,1962, included 547 held by known members of
 the Communist Party, of which 30 were Communist Party function-
 aries. Of this total of 547 passports, 868 were valid as of the end of
 November 1961, and the remainder required renewal as of that date.
 Can you tell me if these figures as I have quoted them are correct
 accordin to your records?
 Miss KNIGHT. According to my records, those figures are correct-

 Senator DODD. Would it be helpful if we knew when these passports
 were issued originally, or initially?
 Miss KNIGHT. Yes, I believe I have that information prepared, per-
 haps not in exactly the form that you would wish to have it, but I have
 the figures, and they could be made available to the committee.
 Senator DODD. That would be satisfactory-if you could make them
 available.
 Miss KNIGHT. Yes, sir.
 Senator DODD. What I would like to know is when these passports
 were initially issued.
 Miss KNIGHT. Yes, sir.
 Senator DODD. As I understand counsel, he asked if they were re-
 newed.
 Mr. JoHNSoN. May I clarify that for the Chair. These would be
 passports issued subsequent to June 16, 1958, which was the date of
 the Briehl-Kent Supreme Court decision, holding that we had no.
 legislative authority for the Communist regulation.
 senator DODD. I see. Even so, I would like to get the figures.
 Miss KNIGHT. Yes, we have that.
 Mr. SounwiNE. Who categorized these 547 passport holders as.
 known members of the Communist Party? Was that on the basis of'
 the best information available to you ?
 Miss KNIGHT. That is on the basis of the information available to
 the Passport Office; yes, sir.
 Mr. SOURWINE. If the committee asks you for a list of these pass-
 port holders, and the dates on which they got their passports, do,
 you think the State Department would let you give it to us?
 Miss KNIGHT. I don't know, sir. You know, I am in trouble right
 now with having violated a regulation of the State Department by
 making available a document to this committee.
 Mr. SouRwlxE. To this committee?  What document?
 Miss KNIGHT. Well, the transcript of the hearing on the Flynn case..
 Mr. SOURWINE. We subpenaed that document.
 Miss KNIGHT. Yes, sir.  But unfortunately I didn't go through,
 channels. I understand that the Department's regulations are that
 the subpena has to be handled through the Legal Adviser's office. I
 have the regulation right here. May I read it-because I am in viola-
 tion of it, and I think I am in trouble.
 Mr. SotRwlNE. Go ahead.
 Miss KNIGHT. So I have some qualms about what the Department
 would make available to the committee.
 THE HANDLING OF SUBPENAS FOR DEPARTMENT RECORDS
 No office or employee is authorized to produce departmental or overseas post
 records or give testimony regarding information contained therein before a com
 mitee of Congress, a court of law, or a quasi-judicial tribunal, without the specif-
 ic authorization of the Secretary, the Deputy Under Secretary for Administra-
 tion, the Assistant Secretary for Administration, or the Assistant Secretary for'
 Congressional Relations.  In the event the records contain classified informa-
 tion, the security regulations contained in section 1964 shall also apply.
 Mr. SoURWINE. Mr. Chairman, I would only comment with regard:
 to that, that that purported regulation attempts to prohibit appear-
 ances before congressional committees and testimony before congres-
 sional committees by members of an executive department properly

 subpenaed. And I think it is absolutely void. There is no power by
 an administrative regulation to prohibit an employee from testifying
 before a congressional commitee.
 Senator Donn. Well, I quite agree. It seems so to me.  But that
 is a matter
 Mr. SouitwINE. Who told you you were in trouble about furnish-
 ing that material?
 Miss KNmir, r. The legal Adviser's office advised me today.
 Mr. SounwiNE. Well, Mr. Chayes is out of the city we are told.
 Who advised you?
 Miss KNIGHT. It was Mr. Lowenfeld, one of his assistants.
 Mr. SovmwINE. In person or by telephone?
 Miss KNIGHT. In person.
 Mr. SOURWINE. Could you tell us about this conversation? Did he
 come toyour office, or call you to his office?
 Miss KNIGHT.   Tell, he came to my office and part of the conversa-
 tion dealt with the fact that we had made available to the committee
 the testimony of the Flynn hearing. And I was told that I was in
 violation of this departmental regulation, and I should have known
 about it. But I just didn't.
 Mr. SouitwINE. When was the regulation issued?
 Miss KNIGHT. It was issued September 25, 1961.
 Mr. SouawINE. Didn't you explain to Mr. Lowenfold that this has
 been subpenaed as I might say, the committee has many times sub-
 penaed your office for information which we wanted.
 Miss KNrmIIT. Yes. But lie pointed out that the Department might
 have a reason for not honoring the subpena.
 Mr. SouswiNi.:. In other words, the legal counsel's office is going
 to decide what the committee can get under subpena?
 Miss KNIGHT. I don't know, sir.
 Mr. SoultwiNE. Well, this is what you understood to be his position?
 Miss KNIGHT. Yes.
 Mr. SouRWINE. Mr. Lowenfeld has been asked to come before the
 committee, Mr. Chairman. Perhaps we can ask him about this when
 he comes.
 Senator Donn. Yes, I think so.
 Mr. SouRwnNE. Miss Knight, you have supplied the committee with
 information which the committee requested in a formal way. I can't
 speak for the committee, but I will tell you, I will be very much sur-
 prised if the committee didn't support you very fully.

 U.S. SENATE MEMORANDUM,
 January 11, 1962.
 DEAR SENATOR : This summary of proposed new passport regulations was sup-
 plied just before noon today by Mr. Jack Leahy of the State Department, for
 the information of the subcommittee.  Mr. Leahy advises the regulations have
 been approved by the Secretary and that it is proposed to publish them in the
 Federal Register next Monday with the emergency clause which will make them
 immediately effective upon publication.
 JAY SODRWINE.
 Mr. SOURWINL Now, Mr. Chairman, I ask that there be placed in
 the record a memorandum to me from Mr. William Lowell, of the
 committee's staff, under date of February 1, 1962, in response to my
 oral request to him for information regarding the publication of exec-
 utive documents.
 Senator DODD. Very well. It may be admitted.
 (The material referred to gads as follows:)
 FEasuAaY 1,1962.
 JAY: You asked certain information regarding the publication of executive
 documents.
 Presidential papers have precedence.  If they are received before 12:30 p.m.,
 they will normally be published in the Federal Register of the following day.
 If they are received after 12:30, they will not appear until the second day
 unless the White House asks immediate treatment and the Presidential docu-
 ment can be squeezed into the time and space limitations of the printing job.
 Regarding departmental papers, there is a lag of 4 days. Thus a document
 received on Monday would be published on Thursday. Again there are excep-
 tions. If earlier publication is requested, the Register will try to meet it. On
 the other hand, if thereare charts, tables, or other illustrations, more time may
 be required-perhaps another 3 days. Such a situation can lead to negotiations
 which could result in a condensation of the document or to an overtime speedup
 schedule on the part of the printer.  The longer time, in comparison with
 Presidential papers, is caused by the fact that departmental documents often
 are much longer than those which originate in the White House.
 The Register is printed by the Government Printing Office and published
 (since its resumption) on a 5-day basis-Tuesday through Saturday.
 W.E.L.
 Mr. SotRWINE. I also ask that there be placed in the record a
 memorandum to me from Mr. Sam Scott, assistant counsel of the sub-
 committee, on the subject of the new regulation of the Department of
 State relative to the issuance of passports.
 Senator DODD. It may be admitted.
 (The material referred to reads as follows:)
 Memorandum to: Jay Sourwine.

 ports (27 F .R. 344).
 On February 5, 1962, Mr. Warren R. Reid, Director of the Publication Services
 Division, Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Service,
 General Services Administration, Washington, DC.; made available to me his
 file containing the "originals" of six State Department regulations recently
 published in the Federal Register.  Five of the six "originals" had transmittal
 letters attached.  The "original" marked No. 3 was the above-captioned regula-
 tion which did not have a letter of transmittal attached. When this was called
 to the attention of Mr. Reid, he remarked, "Strangely, this one has no trans-
 mittal letter attached, apparently it must have been hand delivered by special
 messenger." Then Mr. Reid advised that until 2 years ago his office required
 transmittal letters; however, since they didn't seem to serve any useful pur-
 pose, the requirement had been discontinued. But most departments and agen-
 cles still continued the practice.

 An examination of the "original" No. 62 450, photostat copy attached hereto,
 xevealed it was signed by Roger W. Jones, Deputy Under Secretary for Admin-
 istration, and dated January 11, 1962.  It was noted the signature of Mr. Jones
 was in blue ink and the date "Jan. 11, 1962" was in red ink in handwriting
 .appearing to be different from that of the signature.
 The time-date block stamp of the office of the Federal Register stamped at
 the bottom of the last page recorded the "original" as having been filed at
 12: 30 p.m., January 11, 1962.  An examination of the Federal Register reflected
 the instant regulations were published and issued January 12, 1962, 27 F.R.
 .344. It was noted the Federal Register set forth the time of filing of the regu-
 lation' as January 11, 1962, at 12: 30 a.m. (obviously a typographical error).
 Mr. Reid said it usually takes 2 or 3 days from date of signing in the agencies
 to clear the paper-flow route before the Office of the Federal Register receives a
 document of this nature, and then if it follows the normal course, about 72 hours
 elapsed from the time of receipt until publication. Noting the short interim be-
 tween receipt and publication in this particular case, Mr. Reid remarked, "I seem
 to recall that we received an advance copy of this 'Passport Regulation' so we
 could have the type set up in advance in order to publish it immediately in the
 Federal Register as soon as we received the signed 'original'." At this point Mr.
 Reid said he would like to call Mr. Lawshe, the Assistant Director, who was more
 familiar with the details and circumstances surrounding this particular transac-
 tion.
 Upon being called, Mr. Lawshe came to the office of Mr. Reid and confirmed that
 be had handled and was familiar with the details in this instance. Mr. Lawshe
 said he had received a call from the State Department, describing it as not a high-
 level call but by some clerk, saying this was not the normal procedure but an ad-
 vance copy was being sent over so that the type could be set up in advance in
 Corder to expedite the publication, that they would call and tell them when the
 "original" was signed, and that the "original" would be sent later. Mr. Lawshe
 said, however, no call was received, but the signed "original" was hand delivered
 by special messenger and received at the time and date as stamped in the docu-
 ment. Mr. Lawshe advised that inasmuch as the type had been set from the ad-
 vance copy it was ready and was published the following day, January 12 in the
 Federal Register (27 F.R. 344).
 Mr. SOURWINE. I ask that there may be inserted in the record a letter
 under date of January 5, addressed to Mr. Roger Jones, by Mr. J.
 Walter Yeagley, Assistant Attorney General, Internal Security Divi-
 sion, and I will state for the record this is a photostat of the letter, or a
 signed copy thereof, and this came to me in proper manner, being
 handed to me by an Assistant Attorney General, in Senator Eastland's
 office.
 Senator DoDD. Very well. It may be admitted.

 Mr. ROGER JONES,
 Deputy Under Secretary for Administration,
 Department of State, Washington, D.C.
 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
 Washington, January 5,1962.
 DEAR MR. JONES : Discussions between representatives of this Department and
 the Department of State with respect to implementing passport provisions of
 the Subversive Activities Control Act have raised the question as to whether
 or not officers and employees of the Department of State are obligated by the
 =act to deny a passport where the basis for their reason to believe that an appli-
 cant is a member of the Communist Party is, and must remain, confidential for
 security reasons.
 For the reasons expressed hereafter, the Department of Justice is of the
 opinion that the State Department in denying a passport should conduct a hear-
 ing based upon an open record, and that the statute does not contemplate the
 denial of passports on the basis of information which cannot, for security rea-
 sons, be disclosed.
 Section 6(b) of the act makes it unlawful for an officer or employee of the
 United States to issue or renew a passport if such officer or employee "has rea=
 .son to believe" that an applicant is a member of the Communist Party.  It is
 Approved For Release 2005/08/22 : CIA-RDP66B00403R000500120001-1
 Ap2ved For RelepC4$6r6B00403R000500120001-1
 our position that section 6(b) must be read to require the officer to deny a pass-
 port only where be acts on Information that Is capable of disclosure.  If the ap-
 plicant sought to contest the dental, he would, In our view, be entitled under the
 statute to be confronted with the precise Information against him and to be
 apprised of the source of such information.  A proceeding that may result in
 curtailment of the right to travel, and that does not afford an opportunity for
 such confrontation would raise serious questions as to whether the requirements
 of the due process clause were satisfied (See Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474,
 486-97 (1959) ).  In such circumstances we believe the Supreme Court would
 hold that the statute should not, without more explicit language, be read to
 authorize curtailment of travel upon the basis of secret information.  Compare
 id. at 506--08.
 This construction of section 6(b) Is supported by an examination of other
 provisions of the act.  Where an organization has registered pursuant to the
 act and has filed a membership list, the act affords to those on the list an op-
 portunity for a full hearing to determine whether In fact they are members (50
 U.S.C., see. 792 (c) and (d)).  The hearing procedures Include the right "to
 conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure
 of the facts," (50 U.S.C., sec. 792(d) ).  Where the organization required to
 register has not done so, and where Individual members have not been ordered
 to register, the hearing procedures provided by section 792 are not available, ab-
 sent the filing by the Attorney General with the Subversive Activities Control
 Board of a petition seeking an order requiring an individual member to register.
 Since in such cases the fact of membership will not have been determined at any
 stage through a hearing, Congress must have intended that before the disabilities
 of section 6 are Imposed on alleged members, membership be determined in a
 hearing to be provided by the agency imposing the disability.  To conclude other-
 wise would be to give Congress' apparent Intention to afford adequate procedural
 safeguards to those against whom the disabilities of the act were sought to be
 imposed an irregularity of application not easily explained.
 If we were to conclude that the Secretary of State is required to deny a pass-
 port on the basis of secret Information, we would open the door to anomalous
 intt?rpretation of the act.  For example, a person who was found at an open hear-
 Ing before the Subversive Activities Control Board not to be required to register
 might, nonetheless, be denied a passport by the Secretary of State on the basis
 of information not disclosed at that hearing.
 Consequently, as we interpret It. the statute only requires the Department of
 State to deny passports In cases In which It can, if subsequently called upon to
 do so, produce the evidence upon which the denial is based at a hearing chal-
 lenging the denial.  It does not follow that your Deparment must divulge infor-
 nmation where security interests require that It be kept secret.  Such an inter-
 pretation would require one to read the act as undermining the very security It
 was designed to promote.  Rather, where it is inconsistent with secdrity interests
 to divulge information as to membership, the passport should be issued and the
 information withheld.  In such cases, the Secretary of State can properly con-
 sider that he does not have the "knowledge or reason to believe", which the stat-
 ute makes a condition for the requirement that he deny a passport.
 With respect to the decision as to what evidence may properly be publicly dis-
 closed we would, of course, expect to be consulted before any information derived
 from this Department were made public, and would not expect such information
 to be disclosed without our concurrence.
 Sincerely,
 J. WALTER YEAGLEY,
 Assistant Attorney General,
 Internal Security Division.
 Mir. SounrviNE. We have another letter, signed by Mr. Yeagle, and
 addressed to Mr. Roger Jones, under date of January 5, 1962.' This
 is a somewhat longer letter. I ask that this also go in the record at
 this point.

 (The material referred.toxoAs as follows:)
 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,
 Washington, January 5, 1962.
 Mr. ROGER JONES,
 Deputy Under Secretary for Administration,
 Department of State, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. JONES : This is with reference to the letter of October 24, 1961, from
 Mr. Edward J. Hickey of your Department, requesting the views of this Division
 on procedures appropriate for the Department of State to initiate in consequence
 of the recently activated passport provisions of the Subversive Activities Control
 Act of 1950.
 The responsibilities of the Departments of State and Justice in the implementa-
 tion of section 6 of the act (50 U.S.C. 785), recently was the topic of discussion
 at conferences attended by representatives of this Department (including the
 -Solicitor General and the Assistant- Attorneys General in charge of the Office of
 Legal Counsel and the Internal Security-;Division) and representatives of the
 State Department (including the Legal Adviser to the Secretary).  At those
 meetings it was the view of the Department of Justice that since the provisions
 of section 6 are now effective, the Departments of Justice and State have a re-
 sponsibility to enforce the provisions.
 As Mr. Hickey points .out in his letter, the Supreme Court's recent affi;rmaniee-
 in the case of Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board (367
 U.S. 1), has resulted in bringing into operation the criminal sanctions applicable
 to section 6, which prohibit a member of a Communist organization (in this case,
 the Communist Party), which is required to be registered with the Attorney
 General, from applying for, seeking to renew, using, or attempting to use any
 passport issued under the authority of the United States.  It is also unlawful
 under this section fors any officer or employee of the United States to issue to,
 or renew the passport of, any individual knowing or having reason to believe
 that he is a member of such an organization.
 Under the terms of section 6, we think it clear that subsequent to October 20,
 1961 (the date on which the order requiring the party to register became
 "final"), any of the above activities, with one exception hereinafter discussed,
 by a member of the Communist Party having knowledge of the finality of the
 order, could afford the basis for a criminal prosecution for violation of section 6.
 The exception referred to above arises out of the following circumstances:
 Following the 1958 decision of the Supreme Court in Kent and Briehl v. Dulles
 (357 U.S. 116), holding that the Secretary of State had no statutory basis to
 deny passports to persons because of their alleged communistic beliefs and
 associations and their refusal to file affidavits concerning their membership in
 the Communist Party, the State Department, we are informed, issued passports
 to about 500 individuals whom it had reason to believe were members of the
 Communist Party.  Undoubtedly, some of the holders of these passports were
 lawfully traveling abroad as of October 20, 1961, when section 6 first became
 operative.  Since the obvious purpose of the statute is to prevent travel outside
 the Western Hemisphere by members of Communist organizations subsequent to
 the effective date of the statute, it is our opinion that the "use" of a validly
 issued passport.by a member of the Communist Party to reenter the United
 States after October 20 from a trip which was commenced prior to October 20
 is not prescribed by section 6.  To read the statute otherwise would be to require
 such an individual to choose between violating the statute by reentry or to
 forever exile himself from the country.  Obviously, such interpretation could
 not be reasonably placed on the statute. Any use of such passport subsequent
 to October 20, 1961, by a member of the Communist Party for the purpose of
 departing from the United States would violate the "use" provision of the
 statute.
 1. With respect to your request for our views as to what action should be
 taken with regard to an application for a pa sport or for the renewal of a
 passport submitted subsequent to October 20, 1961, the following are suggested
 for your consideration :
 (a) It is our tentative view that as a reasonable method of implementation
 of the statute each passport applicant should be requested to state, in response
 to questions placed on the passport application form required by the regulations
 (22 CFR 51.14), whether he is presently a member of the Communist Party
 or has been a member.

 STATE DEPARTMENT SECURITY
 (b) An affirmative answer to the question as to present party membership,
 is a sufficient basis for dental of the passport.
 It has been suggested that an affirmative answer would require the Depart-
 ment of Justice to then prosecute the applicant for "making application" for-
 a passport in violation of section 6(a) of the act, using as evidence of guilt
 the honest response made to the question posed by the Department of State.
 However, we cannot conclude that Congress intended to punish, under section'
 6(a) of the act, individuals who perform the harmless act of simply furnishing
 information which under section 6(b) of the act requires the Department of'
 State to deny them a passport. The purpose of section 6 is to prevent the party
 from carrying on its activities through travel of its members abroad.  Penal-
 izing honest responses to Inquiries designed to obtain Information enabling your
 department to effectuate section 6 would to some extent frustrate rather than,
 advance its purpose.  Thus, despite the literal language of section 6(a), we,
 can only interpret it to mean that it is unlawful for those Individuals who in:
 some way conceal the fact of membership. to apply for a passport. This inter-
 pretation makes section 6 more rational in Its, application and eliminates what
 would otherwise be an inexplicable Inconsistency with the approach taken by
 Congress in section 5 of the act, 50 U.S.C. 784, which only makes It unlawful-
 for one seeking, holding, or accepting office or employment under the United
 States, or employment in a defence facility to "conceal or fall to disclose the
 fact that he Is a member of [a Communist] organization * ? *."'  [Empbasis-
 supplied.]  Consequently, placing the question on the application will not In
 our view lead to the potentially bizarre consequences suggested.
 (c) The procedure of requiring responses to questions as to party member-
 ship raises the question of what is to be done In the event an applicant refuses
 to answer.
 He might refuse to answer on the ground that Congress may not constitution-
 ally require the Secretary of State to deny passports because of membership in,
 the Communist Party, or be may claim his privilege against self-incrimination.
 We suggest tentatively again that with respect to cases In the first category the-
 Department of State may properly decline to process the passport application on
 the ground that the applicant failed to furnish relevant Information. Compare-
 In re Anastaplo, 366 U.S. 38, 44-45 (1961) ; Bcaan v. Board of Education, 357
 U.S. 399 (1957) ; Cronan Y. FCC; 285 F. 2d 288 (D.C. Cir. 1960), cert. denied,
 366 U.S. 904 (1961).  Where, however, the Department of State is convinced
 that applicant's refusal to answer purely is a matter of principle and that ap-
 plicant Is not a member of the Communist Party we would appreciate It if the
 Department of State would, before deciding not to process the application, refer
 the case to the Department of Justice so that it may examine the case from a
 litigation standpoint. With respect to the second category refusal based upon.
 invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination, we believe a refusal to
 process the application Is also justified on the ground that the applicant failed
 to furnish relevant Information, despite any deterrent effect that such action-
 may have upon applicant's exercise of the privilege against self-incrimination.
 Compare Nelson v. County of Loa Angelca, 362 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1960).
 As a basis for the above action in appropriate cases, it is advisable that the
 Department of State Issue regulations to the effect that the failure to answer
 pertinent questions on the passport application may be sufficient basis for a re-
 fusal to process an application.  This would enable you to refuse to process an
 incomplete application in an appropriate situation, without requiring that you
 do so in all cases.
 We would appreciate having your views, as well as those of your Legal Adviser,
 on these suggestions.
 (d) If the answer to the question of present membership Is In the negative
 but the answer to the question as to past membership Is In the affirmative, the
 application form should require that additional details concerning the applicant's
 cessation of membership be furnished.  Here, too, refusal to furnish the re-
 quested information may Justify a refusal to process the application.
 (a) If the applicant denies membership In the Communist Party, and the State
 Department has reliable Information to establish the contrary, an administrative
 hearing on the question should be conducted.  Since what is involved is the
 question of curtailment of what the Supreme Court has held to be a constitu-
 tional right to travel, the Information and the source thereof upon which the
 Government Intends to rely in the proceeding should be made a part of the
 open record. 'Compare Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 496-997 (1959).  The

 questions raised by the situation in which the Department of State has "reason to
 believe" that an applicant is a member of the communist Party but cannot, for
 security reasons, disclose that information are dealt with in my supplementary
 letter of this date.
 With respect to unexpired passports presently held by member of the Com-
 munist Party issued prior to October 20, 1961, we believe you should institute
 withdrawal proceedings, having in mind the security considerations which are
 involved, as well as the question of availability of evidence which could be
 presented in an administrative proceeding.  However, we, believe that it may
 be desirable at this time to make requests for the return of passports now
 held by key members of the party, concerning whom there wilL be no difficulty
 in establishing membership in an open hearing.  In the event your Department
 decides to take action in this regard we will be glad to confer with you as to
 the procedures for carrying out such action.

 Mr. SouliwINE. Do you have them?  You have three of them.
 Mr. JOHNSON. Three of them; yes, sir.
 Mr. SOURWINE. I understand two of them Mr. Leahy was not
 going to be able to produce, because he said they originated at the
 Department of Justice.
 Mr. JOHNSON. That is right, sir.  Then one letter-we have it as
 December 14, 1961, and another December N, 1961-I believe the

 DEAR MR. YEAGLEY : The Federal Register of Saturday, October 21, 1,961, con-
 tains a notice by the Subversive Activities Control Board to the effect that the
 Board's order (docket No. 51-101) issued on April 20, 1953, requiring the Com-

 munist Party of the United States to register as a Communist-action organiza-
 tion under section 7 of the Internal Security Act of 1950 became final on Octo-
 ber 20, 1961.
 This action automatically triggers section 6 of the act which makes It unlaw-
 ful for a member of the Communist Party with knowledge or notice of the final
 order to apply for a passport, or the renewal of a passport, issued under the
 authority of the United States, or to use or attempt to use a passport. Likewise,
 section 8(b) makes it unlawful for any officer or employee of the United States
 to Issue or renew a passport for any individual, knowing or having reason to
 believe that he is a member of the party.
 The Supreme Court decision of June 16, 1958, In Sent-Briehl-v. Dulles (357
 U:B. 118 (1958)), held there was no legislative base for the regulations of the
 Secretary of State placing limitations upon the issuance of passports to persons
 supporting the world Communist movement (22 CFR 51.135). In its brief the
 Government contended, In part, that the travel control statute (8 U.S.C. 1185)
 was a delegation of authority to the Secretary to restrict the travel of citizens
 through passport denials on grounds related to the national security In times of
 war or national emergency. In its decision the Court noted, however, that sec-
 tion 0 of the Subversive Activities Control Act had not yet become effective.
 Since Briehl-Kent we estimate that we have issued passports to approximately
 roO persons, who according to information furnished by the Federal Bureau of
 Investigation are members of the Communist Party.  Many of these persons
 are known functionaries of the party.  Many have already renewed their pass-
 ports while others will have to renew theirs in order to preserve their validity.
 Passports issued prior to September 14. 1W59, have an overall period of validity
 of only 4 years-2 years of initial validity and an additional 2 years validity upon
 renewal.  Passports issued on and after September 14, 1959, are valid for an
 initial period of 3 years and are subject to an additional 2-year period upon
 renewal.
 Recent press reports show that Elisabeth Curley Flynn, national chairman of
 the party, and James E. Jackson, national committeeman and editor of the
 Worker are the party's delegates to the 22d Congress of the Communist Party
 of the Soviet Union presently in session In Moscow.
 Under section (b) of 8 u.S.C. 1195 as implemented by E 0. 3001 of January
 17, 1953 (18 F.R. 489) it is unlawful for a citizen to depart from or enter the
 United States for points abroad (except generally, North, Central, and South
 America) without a valid passport.  Section (a) (2) makes it unlawful for any
 person to transport or attempt to transport any person whose entry or depar-
 ture is forbidden under this section.
 The question arises as to what action we should take with respect to Flynn
 and Jackson upon their return to the United States, especially in view of the
 provisions of section 8(a) (2) which makes it unlawful to use or, attempt to use
 a passport.                      ?

 zorrer, 312 U.S. 342)                                                  decisions relate to the "use" of a passport.  In the
 Browder case the court held that the "use" of a passport to prove the bearer's
 citizenship on reentry into the United States was a "use" of the passport even
 though at the time passports was not customarily used by citizens (or legally
 required) for reentry.           While in the Warazower case the court held that the
 presentation of a passport to an immigrant Inspector on reentry Into the United
 States was a "use" of the passport.
 Should we authorize the immigration and Naturalization Service to withdraw
 the passports of Flynn and Jackson upon arrival at a port of entry into the
 United States? The passports themselves are of strong, evidentiary value.
 Should similar action be taken upon return to the United States of other Com-
 munist Party members who are now abroad?
 We would also appreciate your views as to what action we should take with
 respect to an application for a passport or for a renewal of a passport sub-
 mitted on or after October 20, 1981, the date the order requiring the party to
 register became final, by an Individual whom we have reason to believe, on the
 basis of FBI information, is a member of the Communist Party of the United
 States of America.

 DEPARTMENT OF STATE,

 Mr. J. WALTER YEAGLEY,    '
 Assistant Attorney General, Internal Security Division,
 U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. YEAGLEY : Your letter of October 20, 1961, to the Secretary concern-
 ing the applicability of certain provisions of the Subversive Activities Control
 Act of 1950 to members of the Communist Party has been forwarded to this
 Bureau for reply.
 The letter of October 24, 1961, from the Acting Director of the Passport Office
 of this Bureau posed a number of questions relating to the issuance, renewal and
 use of passports by Communist Party members. Your advice was also solicited
 regarding the withdrawal of the passports of Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, national
 chairman of the Communist Party and James Jackson, a member of the party's
 national committee and editor of the Worker, as well as of other members of
 the party who are now abroad.
 Additional information which you requested by telephone yesterday has been
 furnished to you.  I want to thank you for your generous offer of assistance.
 In turn, I want to assure you that we will cooperate fully with your office in
 every possible way.
 Sincerely yours,
 Acting Administrator, Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs.
 Mr. SOURWINE. Now, you have one other document for us?
 Mr. JOHNSON. That is all I have, sir.
 Mr. SOURWINE. You have given us two.
 Mr. JOHNSON. Yes, sir.  We got this over the telephone.  Ap-
 parently there was confusion, because I have two dates-October
 24, 1961, Acting Director, Passport Office, re withdrawal passports
 from Flynn and Jackson.   Then I have the same thing, December
 24, 1961, E. J. Hickey to Yeagley.  So I assumed they referred to
 the same letters.
 Mr. SouRwINE. I see. In other words, it is asked for two different
 ways-identified two different ways, but is the same letter-and that
 is the letter from Hickey, that is in the record now.
 Mr. JOHNSON. Yes, sir.
 Mr. SOURWINE. Mr. Chairman, I now offer for the record the text
 of a letter addressed by the vice chairman of this committee to the
 Attorney General, under date of January 9, 1962.

 5th                   STATE DEPARTMENT SECURITY
 HOn. ROBERT F. KENNEDY,
 Attorney General of the United States,
 Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR Ma. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Information has reached me that the Depart-
 ment of Justice, in a letter over the signature of Mr. Yeagley to Mr. Roger
 Jones, Deputy Under Secretary of State, has, as reported to me, tentatively
 taken a position which amounts In practical effect to abandonment of all efforts
 to use the Internal Security Act as an effective weapon against the Communist
 Party.
 As I understand It, this letter takes the position that passports cannot be
 withheld from applicants without full confrontation with the adverse evidence,
 Including the source or sources of information.  Although couched In words
 ostensibly designed to protect the security of FBI files and sources, this neverthe-
 less poses a threat to these very files and sources If the act should be construed
 to require (as I believe it clearly does) that passports be withheld from any
 person whom the issuing authority has knowledge or reason to believe is a
 member of the Communist Party, U.S.A.
 I am informed that the Yeagley letter does not take this position, but rather
 holds that the act must be construed to require the withholding of a passport
 only on the basis of evidence placed or which can be placed upon an open record,
 and that the State Department has accordingly been advised that where rea-
 son for believing that a passport applicant is a member of the Communist Party
 is confidential or cannot, for security reasons, be disclosed, the passport must
 be issued.
 According to my Information, the Yeagley letter thus amounts to administra-
 tive brainwashing, i.e., it purports to say that what a State Department official
 knows only from confidential records or records which may not be disclosed, may
 not enter Into his belief with respect to whether an Individual is a member of
 the Communist Party, U.S.A.
 The Yeagley letter goes further, I have been told, and Indicates that an in-
 dividual member of the Communist Party, U.S.A., way not be prosecuted for
 failing to register until be has been ordered to do so by the Subversive Activi-
 ties Control Board after a petition by the Attorney General and a full hearing
 before the Board.  As a practical matter, this would of course render the act
 of little value to proceeding against any substantial number of Communists,
 clue to the very large cost of a multiplicity of hearings before the Board, and
 the great amount of time-possibly 5 or 0 years-involved in prosecuting a case
 before the Board.
 In stating that the passport sanctions of the act under section G(b) cannot
 be applied without granting the passport applicant a hearing, the Yeagley letter,
 as reported to me, would appear to imply that no sanctions under the act can be
 enforced against a member of the Communist Party, U.S.A., without a bearing
 and confrontation.  If such an interpretation should prevail, It Is easy to see
 that the usefulness of the act would be almost completely destroyed as a weapon
 against the Communist conspiracy.
 These constructions of the act are substantially those advanced by Mr. John
 Abt in behalf of the Communist Party, though In some respects they seem to go
 even farther in the party's favor than even Mr. Abt has gone. It seems to me
 that for the Attorney General, as a spokesman for the administration, to give
 the act such a construction would be most dangerous from a political standpoint.
 In the eyes of the public, I believe it might appear that the Attorney General
 was backing away from stiff enforcement of the law. If the act is to be so con-
 strued, I'd far rather see this construction placed upon it by the courts than by
 a spokesman for the administration.
 The practical procedure, it would seem to me, would be to proceed with a test
 case in a U.S. district court, against a member of the Communist Party, U.S.A.,
 who has failed to register, with a view to getting a court determination on that
 point; and it policy of withholding passports from all those known or believed
 to be party members, whatever the basis of the information leading to such
 knowledge or belief, leaving the applicant in each case to his remedy in the courts,
 where be may seek an order to require the issuance of the passport. This would
 involve strong administration of the act by the executive branch, and If the con-
 struction advanced by the Yeagley letter should ultimately prevail over the de-
 termined efforts of the Department of Justice, it would nevertheless be clear

 STATE DEPARTM C
 that there is no softness toward communism on the part of the administration.
 I am gravely concerned about this matter, which is why I have written to you,
 and so bluntly. If the Yeagley letter does not represent the view of the Attorney
 General or the administration, and this can be made clear speedily, I think it may
 be that little harm will have been done. On the other hand, if the State Depart-
 ment should issue and promulgate regulations in accordance with this letter,
 even a subsequent change of policy at the direction of the Attorney General
 might not be enough to avoid very serious effects, adverse to the interests of both
 the United States and the Democratic Party.
 All best personal regards.
 Sincerely,                                                    THOMAS J. DODD,

 A LETTER TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT
 (By Holmes Alexander)
 WASHINGTON, D.C.
 To: Hon. Roger Jones, Deputy Under Secretary of State for Administration.
 Subject : The State Department's insecure security.
 DEAR MR. SECRETARY JONES: The security system of the 'State Department
 recently has been under public chastisement for security slackness, a down-
 grading of security efficiency, and hence an inevitable softness-on-communism.
 The American public will be even more disturbed, I believe, at the purloined
 letter which I am about to reveal. It was sent on January 5, 1962, by J. Walter
 Yeagley, Assistant Attorney General, Internal Security Division, Department of
 Justice. The contents of the letter reveal :
 1. An apparent unwillingness to carry out the will of Congress, which is, of
 course, the will of the people.-Secretary Yeagley is a low echelon official who
 can only be transmitting the administration line. He has worked out a serpentine
 argument by which the State Department can wiggle out of its duty to apply the
 passport provisions of the Internal Security Act.
 2. Legal sanctuary for subversives.-"* * * the Department of Justice,"
 writes Secretary Yeagley in a rough draft in my possession, "is of the opinion that
 the State Department, in denying a passport, should conduct a hearing based upon
 an open record * * *."  This means, in effect, that only known and hence rela-
 tively harmless subversives (but not unknown and relatively harmful ones) can
 be denied their country's seal of safe conduct, known as a passport.
 3. Must Congress be obeyed?-"* * * the (internal security) statute does not
 contemplate the denial of passports on the basis of information which cannot,
 for security reasons, be disclosed."  This is the language of Secretary Yeagley
 and the opinion of the Justice Department, which apparently is trying to thwart
 the will of Congress--and is searching for a suitable subterfuge.  In point of
 fact, the statute requires a State Department official to deny a passport when
 he "has reason to believe" that the applicant is a Communist.
 4. Does the law mean what it says?-Section 6(b) of the Internal Security
 Act plainly makes It "unlawful" to issue or ~enew the passport of a member of
 the Communist party.  How does the Jui9tice Department get around this?
 "It is our position that section 6(b) must be read to require the officer capable
 to disclose * * *" writes Justice to State. The officer of the State Department
 may have top secret information that the passport applicant is as Red as
 Khrushchev.  But the officer cannot act upon secret information which is not
 "capable of disclosure."
 5. Is there a right to travel?-There is permission to travel and privilege to
 travel.  The United purpose, among kindred t purposes, of protecting its citizens r and their property

 BTATI     YRTAgF\T SECURITY
 anywhere in the world-but there is no right to travel, as such.  Hence, there
 is no "right" to demand a passport. Yet justice says to State that the passport
 applicant who is denied a passport "would, in our view, be entitled under the
 statute to be apprised of the source of such information."  Unless the applicant
 is allowed the "confrontation" by the FBI or other officials who hold top secret
 information about Communist membership, the applicant Is being denied "due
 process of law"-according to Justice. But since the public safety is paramount,
 Justice advised State not to encourage such a confrontation. Keep the informa-
 tion secret, but give the Red a passport.
 6. Soft on subversives and slack on security.-"consequently, as we interpret
 It," says Justice to State, "the statute only requires the Department of State
 to deny passports in cases In which it can * * * produce the evidence * ^ *
 It does not follow that your Department must divulge information where secu-
 rity Interests require that It be kept secret ? * * Rather  ?  * * the passport
 should be issued and the information withheld.  In such cases, the Secretary
 of State can properly consider that he does not have the 'knowledge or reason
 to believe"' that a Communist applicant for a passport Is really a Communist.
 Well, it all appears to be very legal and pious-but from where I sit, It sounds
 as though the Kennedy administration was instructing Itself not to execute the
 Nation's laws on Internal security.  And unless our Nation develops a rage to
 win the cold war, we could lose it by just such nonsense as this.
 Mr. SouR.wINa. The date is interesting.

 did you see it in print?

 January 12, and was circulated at least 3 days earlier. So that this
 column was available in mimeograph form around Washington at
 least as early as the 9th.

 It plans to Invoke the new rules first against a number of top party ofFleials and

 The Justice Department has ruled that if the only available evidence is classi-
 fied, officials must choose between disclosing it to withhold the passport, or issu-
 ing the passport to keep the information secret.

 DUE PROCESS
 Justice William O. Douglas, speaking for the majority, held that the right to-
 travel is a "liberty" protected by due process of law and that Congress never spe-
 cifically authorized the Secretary of State to withhold the right.
 After this. decision, State Department passport officials said they had no further
 power to withhold passports from Communists. It is estimated that 400 or more
 party members now hold passports.
 1950 ACT TESTED
 When the Supreme Court decided the Kent-Briehl cases, another act of Con-
 gress denying passports to party members had not yet been tested in the courts.
 This was the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 requiring Communist
 organizations to register with the Federal Government.
 A section of the registration law makes it a crime for members of an organiza-
 tion under final registration orders to apply for, renew, or attempt to use a pass-
 port. Last June 5 the Supreme Court upheld the registration law, thereby bring-
 ing the passport provisions into effect for Communist Party members.
 Unlike the earlier invalidated regulations, the new ones do not apply to Com-
 munist sympathizers but only to members or organizations under a final registra-
 tion order, which so far means only the Comm.-nist Party Itself.

 RIGHT To QUESTION

 COMMUNISTS ACCUSERS
 To FO
 (By Anthony Lewis)
 WASHINGTON, January 11.-The State Department will announce tomorrow
 new regulations that bar passports to Communist Party members but allow any-
 one accused of party membership to confront and cross-examine his accusers.
 This is believed to be the first time that the Government has provided such an
 absolute right to confrontation in any internal security program.  The use of
 confidential information has been a characteristic of many security proceedings.
 Under the new regulations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation or other secu-
 rity agencies will still be able to insist on anonymity for a confidential informant.
 But in such a case, the State Department will have to issue a passport to the
 person accused by the informant.
 ATTORNEY GENERAL APPROVES
 The confrontation provision was worked out in extensive discussions among
 State and. Justice Department lawyers.  It has the approval of Attorney Gen-
 eral Robert F. Kennedy.
 Communist Party members have been free to obtain passports since 1958.
 The Supreme Court then held that State Department regulations barring pass-
 ports to persons affiliated with communism had not been authorized by Congress.
 The new move against party members results from the Supreme Court's up-
 holding last June of the Internal Security Act of 1950.
 The Court said that the Communist Party must register under the law as a
 "Communist-action" group.  The party has refused to do so and is being prose-
 cuted.

 NONE MAY APPLY
 The law of 19:10 provides that no member of a group directed to register,
 whether actually registered or not, may apply for or even use a passport.  The
 maximum penalty for violation is a line of $10,000, 5 years In jail, or both.
 To implement the Internal Security Act, the State Department will print a
 warning about the passport provision at the top of every passport application.
 It is also distributing signs to passport offices around the country warning that
 it is a crime for Communists to apply.
 Under the net, only present party membership is a reason for withholding a
 passport.   If any lrlssport official has reason to believe an applicant is a member,
 he will Lviitatircly deny the application.
 The applicant is then entitled to present any Information that he thinks shows
 he is not a Communist.  For example, he might produce a letter in which he pur-
 portedly resigned from the party some years ago,
 RPECTFIC GUARANTEES
 The regulations then provide these spedlflc guarantees to the applicant:
 Ile shalt be entitled to appear in person before a hearing officer in the Pass-
 port Office, to be represented by counsel, to present evidence, to be Informed of
 the evidence upon which the Passport Office relied as a basis for the tentative
 denial, to be informed of the source of such evidence, and to confront and cross-
 examine adverse witnesses.  Then, the regulations say: In making its decision,
 the Passport Office shallnot take Into consideration confidential security Infor-
 ination that Is not made available to the applicant.
 An appeal is provided to the Board of Passport Appeals, which the regula-
 tions say must be convinced by a preponderance of the evidence as would a trial
 court in a civil case.  The Board is barred from considering any confidential
 information not part of fhe record.
 Finally, the Secretary of State will consider the case, and he, too, Is prohibited
 from considering material not shows, to the applicant.
 In contrast, the regulations upset by the Supreme Court in ID 58 specifically
 provided for the department to consider "such confidential information as it
 may have in Its possession."
 One problem for the State and Justice Department lawyers was that the In-
 ternal Security Act made It a crime for any Government official to issue a
 passport "knowing or having reason to believe" that the applicant belonged to
 a proscribed organisation.
 This raised the possibility that a State Department official might be violating
 the law by issuing a passport to an applicant against whom there was confidential
 Informs lion that a security -agency refused to disclose.
 The difficulty was resolved by a Justice Department ruling that a passport
 official's "knowledge" about an applicant's party membership could only be
 from material made available to the applicant.  This position was made formal
 in a letter by the Assistant Attorney General for Internal Security, J. Walter
 Yeagley.

 [Department of State, press release No. 24, Jan. 12, 19.62]
 The Department of State announced today the promulgation of revised pass-
 port regulations dealing with denial of passports to members of Communist
 -organizations registered or required to be registered under the Subversive Acti-
 vities Control Act of 1950.  These regulations are designed to implement the
 act in light of the recent decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the Com-
 munist Party of the United States v. Subversive Activities Control Board.
 The regulations provide that a passport shall not be. issued to or renewed for
 any individual who the issuing officer knows or has reason to believe is a mem-
 ber of a Communist organization registered or required to be registered under
 the Subversive Activities Control Act.
 .These regulations provide further that any person to whom a passport or re-
 newal of a passport has been denied or whose passport has been revoked shall
 have the right to a hearing before the Passport Office, and shall have the right
 to appeal from an adverse decision of the Passport Office to the Board of Pass-
 port Appeals appointed by the Secretary of State.  In such hearings, the appli-
 cant shall be accorded the right to appear, to be represented by counsel, to pre-
 sent evidence, to be informed of the evidence against him and the source of such
 evidence, and to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.  The decision
 to deny a passport shall be based only on evidence which is made available to
 the applicant for the passport.
 The Department of State also announced today that It will move to revoke the
 outstanding passports of certain leading officers and members of the Communist
 Party of the United States. This action will be taken pursuant to the discretion-
 ary authority of the Secretary in the issuance of U.S. passports, and in conformity
 with the provisions in the Subversive Activities Control Act relating to passports
 for persons who are members of Communist organizations registered or required
 to be registered under the act. The Department is now conferring with the De-
 partment of Justice as to the procedures for carrying out such action.

 Mr. WxurE. As soon as Mr. Jones gets the signal that you are all through
 reading the handout, he wants to add a few points.
 I think they are all through, Roger.
 Mr. JONES. Gentlemen, and ladies, what I would like to do this morning is
 to have this completely on the record for this reason: that It is quite probable that
 several committees of Congress will interest themselves very much in these
 regulations; they may want to have conferences with departmental officers and
 officers of the Department of Justice ; they may want to talk with members
 of the press, and It would be a great favor to me if, Indeed, we do get into This
 position of having further discussions with the Congress, if whatever I say
 here today or whatever responses I give to your questions could be a matter
 of record In order that, if necessary, we can just produce it with the committees.
 This is a very difficult kind of an issue, as I am sure you know. There are
 two key sentences In this press release that I would like to call specifically to
 your attention. The first Is at the beginning of the second paragraph:
 "The regulations provide that a passport shall not be Issued to or renewed
 for any Individual who the Issuing officer knows or has reason to believe is a
 member of a Communist organization registered or required to be registered
 under the Subversive Activities Control Act."
 The next is the final sentence of the next paragraph :
 "The decision to deny a passport shall be based only on evidence which is
 made available to the applicant for the passport."
 Consequently, the whole issue is on those, and I have reason to believe is
 complicated by the nature bf the information available both to the department
 and to the applicant.
 Passport eases In the past, and certainly In the future, will sometimes depend
 upon security information which cannot be compromised by its release either
 to the applicant or to any other person.  Under those circumstances, In con-
 sultation with the Department of Justice, we have adopted this posture: that
 we will take no action except on the basis of information which can be made
 available to the applicant.
 This means, of course, that if there is a case In which you have evidence of
 a security nature which cannot be revealed that that evidence will not be used
 In making the decision with respect to the Issuance of the passport.
 This, I think, is going to attract a very considerable amount of public atten-
 tion.
 The Attorney General and the officers of the Department In consultation have
 agreed that this is the only way that we can proceed In order to prevent the
 compromise of security Information.
 I think at the moment it would probably be most useful If I now kept quiet and
 took your questions.
 I may have to refer to counsel here [indicating Mr. Cbayes].
 Question. I would like to have it explained where from comes the ruling that
 the applicant has the right of confrontation?
 Mr. JONES. Abe, do you want to take this one?
 Mr. CuArse. Well, I Will.  We examined the statute In the light of the cases
 in this general area, and in the light of other provisions of the statute as well
 as the Court's expressions on constitutional requirements for hearings in this
 kind of case.  And on the basis of a review of all these criteria, the Justice
 Department and we independently construe the statute as requiring a full con-
 frontation hearing.
 As you know, In the Kent and Brieht cases, (Rockwell Kent and Walter
 Rrichl) the Supreme Court held that the right to travel was a part of the
 liberty of which a citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law.
 If you look, for example, at the Greene case, there It was held that under
 those circumstances, where the petitioner was an employee who had been refused
 clearance in an industrial security and under the industrial security program,
 it was held that he there had been deprived of liberty, and that due process
 of law under the circumstances required-well, let me put it the other way
 around : the Court could not uphold the nonclearance without a full confronta-
 tion under those circumstances.
 Sn you hnbe to look at those cases which provide constitutional background :
 then you look at the act itself, and you we there that If a person-you recall
 the structure of the net.  The art proceeds by first requiring a finding that an
 organization must register: If the organization has to register it has to file a

 list of members.  If a person feels that he is wrongly on that list, or if the
 Court feels that a person has been wrongfully omitted from that list, the person is
 entitled to a full confrontation hearing before the Subversive Activities Control
 Board to determine whether or not he goes on the list.
 Now, then if you go over to section 6, the passport section, that relates to
 people who are members of organizations required to register, and it has been
 our judgment that comparing the registration provisions with the attendant
 requirement of full confrontation hearings against the constitutional background
 of the Kent and Briehl cases and the Greene case, and others, that the statute
 must be read to require a full confrontation hearing here, and that the Supreme
 Court-of course, It is always hard to predict what a court is going to do-but
 in our best judgment that is the way the Court would read it.
 Ned?                     I
 Question.  Well, Abe, on that point, in the decision last year on the 1959
 act did the Court specifically direct their attention to the passport provisions or
 did it only deal with the registration?
 Mr. CHAYES. Well, let me say that that was a long and complicated decision.
 There were several opinions.
 One of the arguments made was that since the passport provisions came into
 effect immediately upon registration the Court would have to deal with the
 passport provisions as well as the registration provisions.
 The Court specifically rejected that argument.  It has dealt only with the
 registration provisions and has specifically left open the question of the constitu-
 tionality of the passport provision per se; regardless of the kind of hearing that
 you get, yes.
 Question. This may very well be challenged?
 Mr. CHAYES. Oh, I have no doubt that the constitutionality of the section itself
 will be challenged in court. And-
 Question. Especially in view of the Court's 1958-
 Mr. CHAYES. That's correct. That is correct. And I think these regulations,
 if I may say so, will put us in a better posture to secure a favorable decision on
 the constitutionality of the whole program.
 Mr. JoNas. Incidentally, the regulations are in the Federal Register today,
 gentlemen.
 Question. In the administration of this-let's go to a passport office in New
 York-and a case comes up, where is the burden of proof?
 Mr. CFIAYES. Well, there are a series of stages at which this arises. Passport
 application is made to a passport officer-this is all laid down in the regula-
 tions-and if the passport officer believes that the section may be applicable
 he notifies the applicant of a tentative denial and of his rights to a hearing.
 The notification shall set forth clearly and precisely the specific reasons for the
 denial, and the procedures for review available to the applicant.  Then, the
 applicant comes into the passport office itself and has a hearing on the denial.
 That hearing is itself a full hearing.  And after the applicant has presented
 his case, the passport office shall review the record and advise the applicant
 of the decision.
 In making its decision, the passport office shall not take into consideration
 confidential security information.  So it then decides whether to confirm its
 tentative denial or not to, on the basis of a full confrontation hearing.
 At that point, if the applicant wishes he can appeal to the passport review
 ooard, and the passport review board, it says, "shall be convinced by a pre-
 ponderance of the evidence as would a trial court in a civil case."
 So the answer to your question about who the burden is on is that at the stage
 of the passport review board, where it is specifically stated, the burden to show
 by a preponderance of evidence is on those opposing the application.
 Question. But in the first stage it tends to be on the applicant?
 Mr. CIIAYES. Well, I don't think you can say that really, because you wouldn't
 make a denial unless you thought you could get it sustained.
 I ought to go back-excuse me-and add one further point to the set of points
 which we took into account in construing the statute to require a full confron-
 tation hearing.  You have to remember that this is basically a criminal statute.
 While it makes it a crime for the Department to issue a passport, the basic
 prohibition is a criminal prohibition.  It makes it a crime to apply for or to
 use the passport if you are a member of this kind of an organization.  So it
 is a crime.

 STATE DEPARTMENT SECURITY
 Now it is perfectly clear that In order to convict the fellow of crime in open
 court you are going to have to have a full confrontation bearing.  I just add
 that to the other points that I made in connection with the full confrontation.
 Question. Abe, could you or Roger try to make this a little less technical?
 In the past when Mr. Dulles was arguing his position on this thing he always
 would give you 430-some people and a half who would getaway with passports
 who shouldn't if they didn't have the regulations be wanted. Is there any way
 of looking back at passports for the last year or two and say what percentage
 you would have had to issue If the rules were dented?
 Mr. CIIAYES. Since the Kent and Briehi cases, we have issued practically all
 of them.
 Question. I mean with respect to application of this particular type.
 Mr. CIIAYES. We haven't made any investigation, because there has been since
 the Kent and Brtchl cases-tbese old regulations have been invalidated and we
 have been unable to deny any passports on this ground.
 Question. Could you say how many either?
 Mr. CIIAYES. I couldn't myself.
 Question. But, Abe, isn't It-let's put the question the other way then. Flow
 many passports out now are about to be called in?
 Mr. CIIAYEa (to Mr. Jones). Do you want to speak to that? I don't think we
 really know the number. We are going to start with high functionaries of the-
 I shouldn't say "high functionaries"-the functionaries of the national party
 organization, people who on the public record are-
 Question. Have you got any names?
 Mr. CIIAYES. No, I haven't got any names yet. We are conferring with the
 Justice Department on the procedures for implementing that right now. The
 Justice Department Is obviously very interested in this, because if any one of
 these fellows comes back with a lawsuit they are going to have to defend us,
 and they are going to have to defend the constitutionality of the act in it.
 So we want to make very sure that the procedures are such as will support
 the Government's ease In court if we have to go to court.
 Question. This revocation doesn't get you Into a bill of attainder situation,
 though.
 Mr. CuAYEs. I would not think so. But I wouldn't want to express my views
 on a constitutional question that will probably be Involved in the litigation on
 the validity of the section.
 Question. Well, Abe, Isn't the purpose of the set Itself substantively defeated
 by the provision that you will not use security information?
 Now suppose that In a particular case the only proof that you have is security
 information. Then Ifthe purpose of the act is to deny passports to Communists
 they are going to get them anyway.
 Mr.  JorF.M.. I think you have to kind of turn It around.  The basic purpose
 of the act is to enhance the security of the United States.  And it can be argued
 on whichever side of the coin you happen to be on, and I am quite sure will be,
 but It wouldn't make a great deal of sense to defeat the security of the United
 States by the compromise of security Information.
 Question. Since the authorization In the act says that you shall withhold
 the passport only from a person who is required to register under this act,
 aren't you jumping the gun?  Why don't you wait for the registration battle
 to be settled?
 Mr.  CIIAYES. Well, It doesn't say a person who-It doesn't say a person
 required to be registered ; it says-let me just read it here so I have got it.
 It is 786, and it says: "unlawful for any member of such organization."  So It
 was argued by some-well, I take that back.
 Question. Isn't the whole question on which organization should register?
 Mr. CHAYES. The organization question has been settled as to the Communist
 Party by the Court.
 Question. The presumption, therefore, Is you will act only against members
 of the Communist Party.
 Mr. CHAYES. That's the only one we are authorized to act against under the
 statute.
 Mr. LowExsELD. So far.
 Question. Can't we find out who the people are who have passports outstand-
 ing?  Certain leading officers and members of the Communist Party of the
 United States.

 Question. We can start with the two delegates, the American delegates to
 the Soviet Communist Party Congress, representatives of the American Com-
 munist Party on the record.  Are you going to revoke their passports?
 Mr. CHAYES. I have to say on these matters of the details of this program
 we are still consulting with the Department of Justice and I really would not
 want to go further into the problem.
 Mr. WHITE. I don't think, Abe, you could possibly go into this until action
 is taken.
 Mr. CHAYES. That's right.
 Question. Is there involved in this confrontation rights?
 Mr. CHAYES. I have got counsel here, too.  [Laughter.]
 Question. Where did you get your law degree?
 Mr. WHITE. That's all right.
 Question. Why was it announced that certain leading officers who have pass-
 ports outstanding are going to have them revoked?  The only ones who have
 got them are ones that have got them and might "fly the coop" and you fellows,
 is that right? And we can't have it for the paper?
 Mr. CHAYES. I would say, in the first place, that they can't "fly the coop"
 because if they do they would be committing a crime, because it is a crime to
 use those passports.
 Question.  Why don't you let them use the passports and then you can punish
 them for it? This makes it a crime to apply for a passport; do you have an
 opinion on the constitutionality of that?
 Mr. CHAYES. I don't think I would express myself on the constitutionality
 of that. The Government intends to enforce the law as written, and the court
 will express itself on the constitutionality.
 Question.  Doesn't it follow then that for a man a member of the party to get
 a test, he has to commit a crime?  Is that right?  How else would he get a test?
 Mr. CHAYES. Well, the withdrawal program may provide a test.  This with-
 drawal program that we have been talking about ; If any member of the party
 wishes to litigate the withdrawal.
 Question.  I am talking about a party member who doesn't have a passport
 now.
 Mr. CHAYES. If he doesn't have a passport now, he must, as you say-he must
 take the risk of committing a crime in order to test the act.  That is not a rare
 thing in constitutional law, you know.
 Question.  This same Communist, I take it, can travel in Canada, Central
 America, and South America where passports are not required, are they?
 Mr. CHAYES. There is nothing in the law that prohibits him from doing that.
 Question.  And what happens if he gets "down" there and wants to go to
 Europe, or "up" there?
 Mr. CHAYES. There is nothing in the law-well, wait a minute.
 Mr. LOWENFELD. He can only go south of the border if he does not intend to
 go from there to Europe.
 Mr. CHAYES. Well, if he goes, he violates the law.
 Mr. LowINFELD. He violates the law and the penalty is it is a crime to travel
 without a passport, except under the exceptions, which is to South America.
 Question.  Abe, is there anything in the present regulations which would make
 it possible for the Department, if it chose, to deny a passport, say, to Mr. Rocke-
 feller?
 Mr. CHAYES. That would make it "possible" or "impossible."
 Answer.    No, "possible."
 Mr. CHAYES. I don't think so ; no.
 Question.  What is the time element involved in this finding-is it current
 membership?
 Mr. CHAYES. The language of the statute in-let me read it again, because
 that's the language.  It is, yes, "shall be unlawful for any member of such organi-
 zation with knowledge or notice that such organization is registered, or that the
 order has become final, to make application for a passport."
 So the time as of which membership, as of which the man has to be a member
 in order to commit a crime is the time of application for use.
 Question. Is it possible then for a person to resign from the party and to
 apply ; and then get back into the party?
 Mr. CHAYES. Well, if you present-
 Mr. LOWENFELO. That would be a crime.

 STATE DEPARTMENT SECURITY
 Mr. CHAYES. You present a hypothetical state of facts.  Let me put It this
 way: If a person has bona fide and clearly quit the party, past membership
 would not make this a crime or not make it wrongful to apply for a use of
 passport.
 Now you start asking, "Well, what is bona fide?"
 Question. Yes.
 Mr. CnayES. I say this: We are just going to look at this on the facts of the
 cases as they come up.
 Question. Well, it seems as if he intends to go through subterfuge ; then the
 evidence you would have against him would be FBI evidence, which you couldn't
 disclose at a hearing.  So for practical purposes all the guy has to do is say,
 "I left the party, try to prove that I didn't, and give me my passport."
 Mr. CIIAYES, I don't think that is true, because the law really Is pretty clear on
 the fact that past membership Is a basis for an inference that it continues.  So the
 fellow's unsupported statement that he resigned would not necessarily out-
 -weigh the inference that was available from evidence of past membership.
 Question. He could give you a letter of resignation pretty quickly, couldn't he?
 Mr. CIIAYES. Well, all I have to say is that these are the kinds of issues that
 the board will have to be dealing with in every case.  It is up to the FBI or
 appropriate security agency to determine whether in its judgment it is more
 important to keep this-guy In the country or to keep the information confidential.
 Question. What Is the composition of the Review Board?
 Mr. CIIAYES. The Review Board is made up of officers of the Department ap-
 pointed by or designated by the Secretary.  It should not be less than three
 officers of the Department, and one of them will be chairman, and there is a
 counsel to the Board who presents the cases before it, and so on.
 Question. Does the applicant bear the cost of all this litigation himself?
 Mr. CnAyES. In our system of law anyone who wants to try a case has to
 pay for it.
 Question. Abe, are you taking a kind of precautionary step on this matter of
 the revocation of passports when you any, "This action will be taken pursuant
 to the discretionary authority of the Secretary * * *"?
 That's in case the other thing doesn't stand up?
 Mr. CHAYES. No.  The discretionary authority of the Secretary is authority
 to withdraw a passport in case he goes where he has authority not to issue it.
 So that the two are coterminous, in effect.  That's our position.  I think it is
 pretty clear that that is the case.
 Question. A background question: Does possession of a passport incur a per-
 son's right to return to the country?
 Mr. CIIAYES. I think a person has to be a citizen to get back into the country.
 If he is a citizen be can get back in.  One way of proving he is a citizen is to
 exhibit his passport.  But I would suppose if he had other satisfactory proof
 of citizenship he could get back in.
 Question. Mr. Jones, has this yet been discussed with any of the committees
 on the Hill?
 Mr. JONES. The committees on the Hill have been notified of the regulations.
 They are aware of the content of them, and of the problems which we see.  It
 has not been discussed in terms of what is going to happen next.
 Question. Can you say bow long ahead of the fact they were notified-the
 committees?
 Mr.  JONES. We started that process-when? Two days ago.  This week.
 I think It was on Wednesday.
 Question. Well, I think a contention up there is the way this regulation works
 out makes the law meaningless insofar as being able to bar a passport from a
 Communist.  I am wondering-
 Mr. JonES. I have no doubt that this contention will be made.
 Question. Do you feel that this is administratively effective?
 Air. JONES. Do I think we can administer this act?
 Question. That this will be effective in keeping passports. out of the hands
 of Communists?
 Mr. JonES. I don't know.  Because I don't think we know yet, I don't think
 anyone knows yet, the nature of the evidence that will be adducible in connection
 with individual cases.  You can only Infer.
 Mr. CHAYES. I would state further that at a minimum it will permit us to
 deny passports to more Communistsg than we have been able to do in the past
 year and a half, because we have been able to deny none on that ground in the
 past year and ahalf.

 Question. There is-this is not a legal question-a lot of fellows will wonder
 why you don't let these people leave the country and then take up the problem
 when they try to get back.  There is a well-known case, as you know, of a char-
 acter who was not disturbed until-apparently, he went to England, and then
 we wouldn't allow him back. Why isn't that standard practice?
 Mr. CIIAYES. Well, part of it is that we don't have any-I mean part of these
 problems are legislative ; others are
 Question. Philosophic?
 Mr. CHAYES. No.  Others have to do with really other agencies having security
 responsibilities.  We are only in this business because it happens that the Sec-
 retary of State has to issue passports.  And that is really the way we get into
 the act.
 THE PRESS. Thank you very much.
 (Whereupon, at 11:38 a.m., the press briefing was concluded.)
 Mr. SOURWINE. Now, the reason, Mr. Chairman, that I put this
 material in is because it appears extremely likely, at least, that the
 Associated Press story, which was carried in the morning papers of
 the 12th in New York, was in fact taken from this press release of the
 12th by the State Department. The press release wasn't given out to
 the press generally until nearly noon on the 12th, long after the
 Associated Press story had moved on the night wire and been printed
 in the morning papers of that day, which would appear to indicate
 that to certain correspondents at least this press release was given
 out or leaked out the day before. And the question arises in view of
 some of the statements at the press briefing whether the ]department
 did not in fact have knowledge of Mr. Holmes Alexander's column,
 and rush into print with this other version of the action. I think it
 is a matter for the committee to consider.
 I now offer, Mr. Chairman, the text of a news story appearing in
 the Washington Evening Star of January 13, entitled "Senators Hit
 Passport Rule as Too Soft."  This refers to the reaction of certain
 Senators to the new regulations. I think it probably should be stated,
 since one member of the committee is mentioned here, Senator Keat-
 ing, that in addition to the request of Senator Keating, which is
 mentioned in this news story, other Senators also have asked the
 committee to go into the matter of these regulations, including both
 the vice chairman and present presiding officer, and the chairman.
 Senator Donn. Very well.
 (The material referred to reads as follows:)
 [From the Washington Evening Star, Jan. 13, 1982]
 SENATORS HIT PASSPORT RULE AS Too SOrr
 (By the Associated Press)
 The new passport regulation covering persons accused of being Communists
 has drawn the fire of Congressmen who think the rule isn't tough enough.
 It is "a step backward in the control and supervision of the Communist ele-
 ments," said Senator Hickenlooper, Republican, of Iowa.
 Senator Lausche, Democrat, of Ohio, declared "The order does not deal ade-
 quately with the problem and legislative action is necessary."
 The new regulation was announced yesterday by the State Department.
 Under it, passports will be denied to known Communists but a person accused of
 being a Red would be permitted to examine the evidence against him at an appeal
 hearing.    .
 After a Supreme Court decision in 1958 Communist Party members were per-
 mitted to receive passports.

 STATE  DEPARTMENT SECURITY
 CONTROL ACT UPHELD
 But last year the Supreme Court upheld the 1950 Subversive Activities Con-
 trol Act which bars issuance of passports to Communists.
 The new passport procedure is based in part on that decision.
 The principal criticism of the new procedure is aimed at the right given to
 persons denied a passport to appeal at bearings where they can examine the
 evidence and confront their accusers.
 This, critics contend, will prevent use of confidential FBI material at the
 hearings and thus will allow all but self-declared Communists to get passports.
 The State Department's legal adviser, Abram Chayes, and Roger W. Jones,
 Deputy Under Secretary for Administration, explained the new procedure to
 newsmen yesterday.
 BASED ON DOUBT RULINGS
 Mr. Chayes said that on the basis of court decisions and on the Anti-Subversive
 Act Itself.  State and Justice Department legal advisers concluded that persons
 accused of being Communists must be permitted to examine the evidence used in
 the decision against them.
 Mr. Jones acknowledged this would rule out use of confidential information
 in turning down a Communist's application but said it was still better than the
 situation prevailing after the 1958 decision permitting Communists to receive
 passports.
 However, Senator Mundt, Republican of South Dakota, said the new regula-
 tion provides "nothing anywhere near the safeguards" intended by the Internal
 Security Act.  He said he was preparing a protest to the Justice and State
 Departments.
 Senator Keating, Republican, of New York, said the new procedure is an im-
 provement "on blanket issuance of passports to any known Communist or traitor
 who applies."  But at best, he added, it is a stopgap measure.  He said he
 would call for bearings on the situation by the Senate Internal Security Sub-
 committee.
 Mr. SouRwINE. I now offer, Mr. Chairman, the letter under date
 of January 16, addressed to the Secretary of State by the vice chair-
 man of this committee with regard to the new passport regulations.
 Senator DODD. Without objection.
 (The material referred to reads as follows:)
 Hon. Dssa Rues,                                  JANVARY 16, 1962.
 The Secretary of State, Department of State,
 Washington, D.O.
 DEAS Ms. SECRETARY: About noon on January 11 Mr. Leahy of the State De-
 partment delivered to the chief counsel of the Internal Security Subcommittee,
 for the information of the subcommittee, a one-page "Summary of Proposed
 Regulations for Issuance of Passports in Communist Cases." A copy of this
 summary was delivered to me within the hour.
 Counsel was told the Department proposed to publish these new regulations In
 the Federal Register on Monday, January 15, with the emergency clause which
 would make them immediately effective upon publication.  The regulations were
 in fact published in the Federal Register of January 12, ]962.
 For several reasons, which I shall set forth below, I plead with you to recon-
 sider and to withdraw these regulations.
 Here are my reasons for this plea :
 (1) As the Department's summary points out, the new regulations set up a
 procedure for "tentative denial" and grant an absolute right of hearing in case
 of any such "tentative denial" and then provide unequivocally that the applicant,
 at the hearing on the "tentative denial," shall be entitled "* * * to examine any
 adverse witnesses or evidence."  [Emphasis added.]  The effect of this would
 be to require a disclosure to any Communist who is a passport applicant of all
 the evidence in the possession of the Department which is adverse to him.  This
 would Involve simply devastating compromise of FBI files and sources.
 (2) The Internal Security Act makes it a criminal -offense to issue a passport
 to an individual whom the issuing officer knows or has reason to believe is a
 member of a Communist-action organization, required to be registered under the
 Approved For Release 2005/08/22 : CIA-RDP66B00403R000500120001-1

 STATE DEPARTMENT SECURITY                2W-
 Subversive Activities Control Act.  The SACB order requiring the Communist
 Party, U.S.A., to register under the act has become final.  But the new regula-
 tions require that decisions of the Passport Office on the issuance of passports
 shall be based only on evidence made available at the hearing, and that decisions
 of the Board of Passport Appeals shall be based only on the record made at the
 hearing, and that in acting upon the recommendation of the Board of Passport
 Appeals respecting action to be taken on a passport application, the Secretary of
 State shall not take into consideration any confidential security information not
 part of the record. This amounts to an attempt at administrative brainwashing.
 The Passport Office, passport officials, and even the Secretary himself, are told
 that they must forget what they know about an applicant if the knowledge Is
 based on confidential information not placed on the public record.
 (3) The proposed new regulations appear to place the Secretary of State in
 an absolutely impossible position.  On the one hand, he is forbidden by law to
 issue a passport to an applicant whom he knows or has reason to believe is a
 member of the Communist Party, U.S.A.  The Secretary is the sole judge of his
 own belief.  But by these regulations the Secretary appears to be telling himself
 that if he knows something adverse to an applicant but does not order it into the
 public record, be may forget it ; or, to state it another way, that if his duty to
 protect FBI files and sources requires him to keep information out of the public
 record, he must issue a passport to the applicant notwithstanding the fact that
 the confidential Information is sufficient .to convince him that the applicant is a
 member of the Communist Party, U.S.A.
 (4) At best, the new regulations appear to require that where evidence of
 Communist Party membership is confidential or, in order to protect FBI files and
 sources, cannot be put on the public record, passports must be issued to Com-
 munist applicants.  At worst, the new regulations appear to provide that pass-
 port applicants shall be given access to FBI files and apprised of FBI sources
 of information, but still cannot be denied passports unless all the adverse evi-
 dence Is placed on the public record.
 (5) By embracing fully the doctrine of the right of complete confrontation in
 passport.cases, the new regulations adopt the view most favorable to the Com-
 munist Party with respect to interpretation of the Subversive Activities Control
 Act.
 In testifying before the House Committee on Un-American Activities on June
 5, 1959, Mr. John W. Hanes, Jr., at that time Administrator, Bureau of Security
 and Consular Affairs, Department of State, declared :
 "I can say bluntly that any legislation concerning denial of passports to com-
 munist supporters would be meaningless and would not achieve any purpose if
 it prohibited the Government from utilizing confidential information.  Almost
 without exception, dangerous cases in the Communist area involve confidential
 information and investigative Sources.?. Indeed, the more recent and meaningful
 our information is, the more likely it is that it has come from current confidential
 investigative sources within the Communist movement."
 Now the Department has done by regulation just what Mr. Hanes declared
 would be meaningless and would not achieve any purpose if done by legislation.
 The Subversive Activities Control Act was directed against Communist or-
 ganizations.                                     I would hope, Mr. Secretary, that in the administration of such
 portions of this act as fall within your jurisdiction, you would consider it de-
 sirable to enforce the act as strongly as possible against the Communist Party,
 U.S.A., and members of that party.  If there is to be an interpretation of the
 act which gives passports to members of the Communist Party, I had far rather
 see this Interpretation applied by the courts than imposed by administrative
 order of the Secretary of State, speaking for a Democratic administration.
 Most respectfully, I suggest that you consider simple compliance with the
 law by refusing to Issue a passport to any applicant whom the issuing officer
 knows or has reason to believe is a member of the Communist Party, U.S.A.,
 leaving the applicant In each such-case to seek in the courts whatever remedy
 he thinks is available to him.
 The Secretary of State can never be criticized for obeying a court order; but
 1. must say frankly that I believe that criticism will be severe and nationwide if
 it becomes known the Department of State has promulgated an interpretation
 of the statute under which passports will be issued to Communists.
 Best personal regards and all good wishes.

 DEPARTMENT SECURITY
 Mr. SouRwiiig. I now offer the letter of Mr. Frederick G. Dutton
 in reply to the letter from Senator Dodd under date of January 16.
 Senator Donn. Without objection.
 (The material referred to reads as follows:)
 DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
 Washington, January 89,1962.
 Hon. THOMAS J. DODD,
 Vice Chairman, Internal Security Subcommittee,
 Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate.
 Dens SENATOR DODD: The Secretary has asked me to reply to your letter of
 January 16,1962, concerning the new passport regulations.
 First let me say that we regret any misunderstanding that may have been
 occasioned by publication of the regulations on January 12. As I believe Mr.
 Leahy of my office informed the chief counsel of the Internal Security Subcom-
 mittee, the intention was to put the regulations into effect with as much dis-
 patch as possible, since more than 8 weeks had passed since the entry into force
 of the order requiring the Communist Party of the United States to register under
 section 7 of the Subversive Activities Control Act. There was thus a period in
 which persons possibly coming under the act were applying for passports with
 no regulations in effect under which the Department could deny them passports.
 As a matter of courtesy to the interested committees of the Congress, we gave
 them advance notice and distributed a summary of the regulations. Because of
 the urgency of the matter, and because of the fact that the text of the regu-
 lations was not very long, it proved possible for the Federal Register to cut
 the normal time between submission and publication, and to publish the regu-
 lations on Friday, January 12, rather than on the following Monday.
 Coming now to the substantive points which you make with respect to the
 regulations, I shall take them up in order.  I am also taking the liberty of
 enclosing a copy of the letter of January 5, 1962, from Mr. J. Walter Yeagley
 to Mr. Roger .Jones, which sets forth the views of the Department of Justice
 with respect to some of the points you raise.
 1. 22 CFR 31.138 states that a person whose application for a passport has
 been tentatively denied shall be entitled "? * * to be informed of the evidence
 upon which the Passport Office relied as a basis for the tentative denial." The
 regulation does not say, nor is it contemplated, that the applicant is entitled
 to examine any adverse evidence or witnesses.  To give the applicant such a
 right would, as Mr. Yeagley has stated in his letter of January 5, be to under-
 mine the very security the act was designed to promote.  If there is not suf-
 ficient disciosable evidence to support denial of a passport, the consequence
 would be that the applicant will receive a passport. In no case will he, or any
 other unauthorized person, be granted access to FBI files or sources.
 2. In stating the requirement that the decision on a passport application may
 be made only on the open record, the regulations simply spell out the traditional
 requirement in Anglo-American jurisprudence that a person to be seriously in-
 jured by governmental action shall be entitled to face his accusers, and that the
 investigator or prosecutor shall not be the judge.  See Greene v. McElroy, 384
 496, 497 (1959). The Board of Passport Appeals will consist of senior Depart-
 ment officials outside the Passport Office who will have had no prior contact
 with the case and will thus, generally. have no knowledge about the applicant
 which they would have to forget.  Hearing officers in the Passport Office will also
 be chosen among persons who have had no previous acquaintance with the ap-
 plicant's ease. There will thus be no "administrative brainwashing" at any level.
 3. The inconsistency which you suggest is the result of the prohibition con-
 tained in section 6(b) of the act and the requirement of the new regulations for
 a decision only on evidence on the record is based upon a construction of the
 words "knowing or having reason to believe." In construing these words, the
 Department of Justice in the letter of January 5 previously referred to has stated
 that in cases in which security considerations dictate withholding of confidential
 security information from the record, "the Secretary of State can properly
 consider that he does not have the `knowledge or reason to believe,' which the
 statute makes a condition for the requirement that he deny a passport."
 4. As stated under 1 above, passport applicants will never be given access to
 FBI files and will be informed only of matters which the FBI or other originat-
 ing agency agrees .may be placed on the public record. This is in accordance
 with section 7(c) of Executive Order 10501 of November 9, 1963.

 STATE DEPARTMENT SECURITY                   GG
 It is true that there may be circumstances in which passports are issued to
 Communist applicants.  If they use the passports, they are, of course, liable to
 criminal prosecution under section 6(a) of the act.
 5. It is true that the Supreme Court has thus far reserved the question of
 whether the right of full confrontation is a constitutional requirement in pass-
 port cases.  It is our judgment, however, and that of the Department of Justice,
 that the restriction on the right to travel contained in section 6 of the Subversive
 Activities Control Act is most likely to be sustained when accompanied by hear-
 ing procedures which themselves are not subject to serious question on constitu-
 tional grounds.  We thus, believe that the regulations are not favorable to the
 Communist Party, but on the contrary, will serve to strengthen the part of the
 Subversive Activities Control Act within the jurisdiction of the Department of
 State.
 Moreover, as pointed out in the enclosed letter from Mr. Yeagley, a construc-
 tion of section 6 of the Subversive Activities Control Act that did not call for
 a confrontation hearing would require an interpretation whereby the sanction
 of the passport sections were applied on a different basis from. that applied to
 membership in an organization registered or required to be registered under
 section 7, it does not seem that a sound interpretation of the act should result in
 different kinds of hearings depending on whether the legal sanction to be im-
 posed is registration or denial of a passport.
 I do not believe that it is appropriate for us to comment on the remarks of
 the Administrator, Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs, in the previous
 administration.  We do believe, however, that as officials of the executive
 branch we are bound to construe and administer the law in accordance with
 the advice of our law officers.  This we have done in issuing the present regula-
 tions.
 The problems discussed above and in your letter of January 16 are, plainly,
 not capable of easy solution. We trust that you will understand that we have
 given them. serious consideration, and we appreciate your continuing interest
 in them.
 Respectfully,
 PEEDEaaox G. DurroN, Assistant Secretary.

 [Press release from oftlee of Senator Karl E. Mundt, Republican, of South Dakota, Wash-
 ington, D.C., for release Thursday morning, Jan. 18, 19621
 Following is a copy of a letter Senator Karl E. Mundt, Republican, of South
 Dakota, is sending Wednesday, January 17, to Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
 concerning the new passport regulations Issued by the Department of State.
 Senator Mundt's interest in these regulations stems from his work as a coauthor
 of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (the first 17 sections were Initially presented
 as the Mundt-Nixon bill) which Is to be implemented by these regulations.  A
 similar letter Is also being sent to Attorney General Robert Kennedy.  The let-
 ter follows :
 Hon. DEAN Russ,                                       JaxveaY 17,1962.
 Secretary of State,
 Department of State, Washington, D.O.
 DEAR Ms. SecaETARY : This letter concerns the regulations recently promul-
 gated by the Department of State, establishing the administrative procedures
 for the denial of U.S. passports to members of the Communist Party.
 I have carefully studied these regulations as they appeared in the Federal
 Register for January 12, 1962, and I am obliged to state that I view their final
 adoption with grave concern.  My concern centers on that portion of section
 51.138, which provides that an applicant, who contests a tentative denial of a
 passport, shall be fully informed as to the sources of adverse evidence and
 granted the right to confront and cross-examine all adverse witnesses.
 While I am fully aware of the infinite Importance attaching to the coordinate
 rights of confrontation and cross-examination in criminal proceedings, under our
 Anglo-American legal system, I am, nevertheless, dubious as to the feasibility of
 making a strict transference of these rights to administrative proceedings, espe-
 cially when national security is at Issue. I am certain that many occasions will
 arise when the FBI, the CIA, and other Intelligence agencies will understanda-
 bly be strongly opposed to disclosing the Identity of sensitively placed confiden-
 tial informants; and if the testimony of these Informants had determinative
 weight In the consideration of a passport application, the newly promulgated
 regulations will have the effect of compelling Issuance of a passport to an In-
 dividual, whom the Passport Office knows or has reason to believe Is a mem-
 ber of the Communist Party.  In matters involving our national security it Is
 my earnest conviction that the Federal Government should not be compelled
 into the position of having to choose between two alternative courses of action,
 when both are inimical to our Nation's best interests.
 This matter is further complicated by the fact that under the Internal Security
 Act of 1850 It is unlawful for any officer of the United States to Issue a passport
 to an individual, whom that officer knows or hasreason to believe is a member
 of an organization which is registered or under final orders to register in accord-
 ance with the registration requirements of that act.
 It would seem that the newly promulgated regulations will place in an Im-
 possible legal circumstance those officers In the Department of State, who are
 responsible for passport issuance. Recognizing that the intelligence and inves-
 tigative agencies will be unwilling to Identify valuable confidential Informants,
 will these State Department officers henceforth refuse to read confidential inves-
 tigative reports for fear'of gaining knowledge which might at some future date
 make it unlawful for them to approve the Issuance of a U.S. passport? If this
 will be the result (and I do not see how such a result can be avoided under the
 new regulation) should we not then turn the responsibilities for passport Issu-
 ance over to a room full of clerk-typists thus stripping away any and all pretense
 of a security system, which in fact will not exist?

 STATE DEPARTMENT SECURITY
 Had this strange and irreconcilable conflict between statute and regulation
 come about through inadvertence or honest mistake, my concern would be mini-
 mal.                                But since the regulations in question were specifically drafted to imple-
 ment the statutory commands of the internal Security Act of 1950, it must be
 assumed that this conflict is not the byproduct of haste or inadvertence but
 Instead is the calculated end product of forethought and premeditation.  As the
 coauthor of the first 17 sections of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (initially
 presented as the Mundt-Nixon bill) I view with grave concern the final adoption
 of these regulations, which render inoperable the passport security features of
 the act ; and I, therefore, urgently request that you provide me with a detailed
 explanation of the legal reasoning which prompted the Department of State to
 issue these regulations in their present form.
 Assuring you that your early attention in this matter will be deeply appre-
 ciated, and with warmest personal regards, I am,
 Cordially yours,                        KARL E. MUNDT, U.S. Senator.
 Mr. SouRWINE. I now offer, Mr. Chairman, a copy of the bill, S. 2095,
 of the 86th Congress, and I want to explain that this bill introduced
 is referred to another committee than the Judiciary, but since the
 Judiciary Committee itself is free at any time to make legislative
 recommendations, eitherto the Senate or any of its sister committees
 it seems to counsel proper that we might have in our record a text of
 the bill which represented an effort nearly 3 years ago to solve the
 problem of passport control from the security standpoint.
 Senator DoDD. Very well. Without objection.

 Mr. SOLTIAVINE. Similarly, an effort this year-I offer for the rec-
 ord the bill II.R. 9754, introduced by Congressman Francis Walter,
 ,January 18, 19G2, and his press release issued in connection therewith.
 Senator Donn. Very -vell. W ,'itltout objection.
 (Tito material referred to reads as follows:)
 STATEMENT BY CONGRESSMAN FRANCIS El. WALTER, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE COMMITTEE
 oN UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES, JANUARY 18, 1962
 I Introduced today a bill spelling out a review procedure under which the De-
 partment of State may consider appeals from rulings under which passports are
 denied to Communists and members of Communist organizations pursuant to
 section 6 of the Internal Security Act of 19u4. Since the Supreme Court of the
 United States rendered Its decision in the Communist Party case on June 5, 1961,
 that law is In effect.
 The urgent need for this legislation Is stressed by the fact that the Depart-
 ment of State, without consultation with appropriate committees of the Con-
 gress, has seen fit to issue, on January 12, 1962, regulations nullifying the law
 and facing the Government of the United States with the problem of either per-
 mitting the Communists and their attorneys to rifle freely the confidential files
 of the FBI, the CIA, and other investigative agencies, or to obtain passports not-
 withstanding the prohibition now in effect.  The Committee on Un-American
 Activities recommends In this instance that the Congress shall lay down a pro-
 cedure, which the Department of State has neglected to do, Implementing the
 statutes as written by Congress and now in force.
 My bill specifically requires the applicant seeking a passport to submit a writ-
 ten application under oath with respect to his membership In such Communist
 organizations as specified in section 6, subsection (a) of the Internal Se-
 curity Act. This in fact amount$ to nothing more than a restatement of existing
 law in force under the act of June 15, 1917 (22, U.S.C. 213), but which the
 Department of State has deliberately ignored, and In effect annulled, In Its reg-
 ulations recently promulgated.
 Under this bill, an applicant who is refused a passport for reasons other than
 that he failed to submit the sworn statement above referred to, will be able to
 file a motion for review and be heard by a special review officer, who Is pro-
 hibited from having participated in investigative functions or in any proceed-
 ings connected with the original refusal of a passport to the person requesting
 review. The applicant will be entitled to submit evidence pertinent to the mat-
 ter and appear at hearings, accompanied by counsel if he so desires, and receive
 such additional information or explanation as may be necessary for the prepa-
 ration of his case before the special review officer.  Moreover, all review pro-
 ceedings will he conducted in such manner as to protect from disclosure all in-
 formation affecting the national security, safety, and public interest, or tending
 to compromise investigative sources and methods.
 A special review officer who conducts the bearing will not be entitled to make
 the decision as to the issuance or refusal of a passport. Instead the bill imposes
 upon him the duty promptly to submit his recommendation to the Secretary of
 State, whose decision will be final.

 limitation, or restriction of a passport.  All testimony shall be given under oath
 or affirmation.  The special review officer may administer oaths, present and
 receive evidence, interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the applicant or
 witness.

 of this subsection shall be in accordance with such regulations, not inconsistent
 with this section, as the Secretary of State shall prescribe, which regulations

 and of the time at which the proceedings will be held ;

 represented (at no expense to the Government) by counsel;

 finally upon such request and advise the applicant of his decision ;

 offer other evidence.  If any witness whom the applicant wishes to call is
 unable to appear personally, the special review officer may, in his discretion,

 PA88PORT FOR REDS?
 Believe it or not, but Elizabeth Gurley Flynh, who was long an open and
 avowed member of the Communist Party, may get a U.S. passport, after all.
 Last year, the Supreme Court ruled these vital safe-conduct passes could be
 denied to Iced party members. This decision was bailed by many concerned with
 the Nation's security.
 The decree meant, for example, that Washington could stop known Communist
 couriers from going abroad to transmit information-or pick up funds to finance
 espionage In this country.
 It also meant Communist Party bigwigs could no longer smear their country
 overseas, by taking part In anti-American propaganda circuses staged here by
 the Soviet Union.
 But where the Supreme Court giveth, the State Department taketh away.
 Last January, the Department unveiled a new set of rules that must be fol-
 lowed before it will deny an American Communist a passport.
 First, the burden of proof of party membership is on Washington. The FBI
 or other agencies involved must produce witnesses who can Identify the passport
 applicant as a party member. He and his lawyer must also have the right to
 cross-examine these witnesses.  Washington must produce any evidence that
 shows party membership for his examination.
 This is mandatory, no matter how confidential the material or its source. If
 It is classified information which cannot be disclosed to unauthorized persons,
 the evidence can't be used.
 Worst still, even airtight proof of past Communist Party membership isn't
 enough.  The applicant can say he has resigned from the party.  It is up to
 Washington to prove otherwise.
 When these rules were made public, the American Civil Liberties Union
 shouted with joy. This is the first time in history, the ACLU pointed out, that
 the right "to confront and cross-examine" has been made a part of the "Gov-
 ernment's loyalty-security programs."
 It said It would urge other Government agencies to follow the State Depart-
 ment's example.
 Mrs. Flynn has applied for a passport to go abroad.  Last week, a bearing
 was held to show cause for denying It. But the redtape which the State Depart-
 ment has wound about such passport cases immediately brought the proceedings
 to a halt.

 A major witness failed to appear.  Why?  Perhaps out of fear of the abuse
 the Communist Party and its friends might heap on him.  Perhaps out of fear
 of bodily harm from one of the many plug-uglies and hired assassins on the
 party's payroll.                                                     +

 civil liberties, and one more black day for the United States.

 SHOWDOWN or FLYNN PASSPORT Bm BALKED
 (Associated Press)
 The State Department's attempts to deny a U.S. passport to Elizabeth Gurley
 Flynn ran into trouble yesterday when a major witness failed to show up.
 As a result, the Department got a continuance until May 3 in the first-of-its-
 kind hearing on Mrs. Flynn, listed by the Department of Justice as chairman of
 the Communist Party of the U.S.A.
 Officials said the State Department had been severely hampered by lack of
 legal power to subpena and pay expenses of witnesses in the newly created
 passport-revocation procedures.
 The Flynn hearing, which started yesterday, is the first under a new and
 controversial regulation issued by the State Department after the Supreme
 Court upheld the passport provisions of the Subversive Activities Control Act.
 The act makes it unlawful for a Communist Party member to apply for a pass-
 port, or for renewal of a passport, or to use a passport.
 Mr. SOURWINE. I also offer a copy of the Department of State press
 release, No. 264, of April 23, 1962, regarding hearings in the passport
 revocation case of Elizabeth Gurley Flynn.
 Senator DODD. Very well.
 (The material referred to reads as follows:)
 [Department of State press release No. 264, Apr. 23, 1962]
 The Department of State will begin hearings tomorrow in the passport revo-
 cation case of Mrs. Elizabeth Gurley Flynn.  Mrs. Flynn's passport was revoked
 by authority of the Secretary of State on January 22, 1962, on the ground that
 there was reason to believe she was a member of the Communist Party of the
 United States, an organization required to register with the Attorney General
 under the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950.
 The case is the first one to arise since the passport provisions of the Subversive
 Activities Control Act went into effect.  The provisions became effective follow-
 ing the entry of judgment by the Supreme Court in the case of Subversive Activi-
 ties Control Board v. Communist Party of the United States.
 Under the provisions of section 6 of the Subversive Activities Control Act, it
 Is now unlawful for a member of the Communist Party of the United States to
 apply for a passport or for the renewal of a passport or to use a passport.
 The hearing will take place before a hearing officer, and will be held in the
 hearing room of the Passport Office.  The hearing officer will be Mr. Max Kane,
 a hearing examiner for the Federal Power Commission, who has been assigned
 to this case by arrangement with the Civil Service Commission.
 For the protection of persons suspected of Communist Party membership, the
 regulations require that hearings be private.  The Passport Office and the ap-
 plicant will be represented by counsel, and a transcript will be made of the
 proceedings.
 The recommended decision of the hearing officer will be based only on evi-
 dence presented at the hearing, and will not be based on any confidential infor-
 mation.
 The hearing officer will prepare findings of fact and will make a recommended
 decision to the Director of the Passport Office.  In the event of an adverse de-
 cision, the applicant will have the right to appeal to the Board of Passport Ap-
 peals, which has been appointed by the Secretary of State.

 DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
 Washington, May 18,1962.
 Mr. JUIiEN G. SOURWINE,
 Chief Counsel, Senate Internal Security Subcommittee,
 New Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. SOURWINE : I am enclosing herewith a paper presenting a chronologi-
 cal listing of the actions taken by the Passport Office following the Supreme
 Court decision of June 5, 1961, upholding the constitutionality of section 7 of
 the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950.
 I had an incomplete list of these actions with me at the hearings held on
 Wednesday and you will remember that you requested it, and I believe it was
 made part of the record.  Then you noticed that this earlier list only covered
 the actions taken to the end of December 1961, and Mr. Johnson provided a
 paper which was more or less informal, listing subsequent actions.  When I
 returned to the office I compared these papers with my files, and I feel that there
 are a few references to conversations and opinions expressed in some intra-
 office conferences within the Department which could be omitted without destroy-
 ing the value of the chronological listing.  Also, I believe the paper Mr. Johnson
 referred to and which was made part of the record is more valuable when trans-
 lated into the chronological listing and added to it in the same style.
 This is only a suggestion, but I do believe the enclosed document is better
 prepared and can be better understood than the two incomplete documents
 which are now in the record.  For the sake of posterity, is there any chance
 of substituting this better and more complete documentation for the other two?
 With best wishes.
 Sincerely,                                       FRANCES G. KNIGHT,

 (50 U.S.C. 785) does not contemplate the denial of passports on the basis of
 information which cannot, for security reasons, be disclosed.
 The Department of Justice also indicated that if the applicant sought to
 contest the denial he would, in their view, be entitled under the statute to be
 confronted with the precise information against him and to be apprised of the
 source of such information.  Mr. Yeagley further indicated in such cases where

 it is inconsistent with security interest to divulge information as to member-
 ship, the Secretary of State can properly consider that he does not have the
 "knowledge or reason to believe" which the statute makes a condition for the
 requirement that he deny a passport.
 January 5, 1962: Letter from J. Walter Yeagley, Assistant Attorney General,
 to Mr. Jones expressing the views of the Department of Justice with respect
 to procedures to be followed by the Department of State in administering
 section G of the Internal Security Act of 1950.

 Legal Adviser, concerning the proposed passport regulations.  Present were
 Mr. Meeker and Mr. Lowenfeld of L, Mr. Bryan of SCA, and Miss Knight and
 Mr. Johnson of PPT.  Present during part of the meeting was Mr. Roger W.
 Jones, Deputy Under Secretary.  Meeting was held to reconcile "difference"
 of views between L, PPT, and SCA over the regulations, In particular, with
 respect to the denial of passports and the use of classified Information.
 January 9, 1902: Memo to PPT from Mr. Lowenteld of L transmitting the
 letter drafted by L to be sent to passport holders whose passports are to be
 revoked.  Memo Indicates Secretary had approved letter.
 January 10, 1962; Mr. Lowenfeld advised by phone that revocation letter
 (referred to above) bad been cleared with Department of Justice.
 January 12, 1962: Press Release No. 24 of January 12, 1962, announcing the
 promulgation of the revised section 1.61.135 -51.170 of the passport regulations.

 standing passports of certain leading members of the Communist Party, U.S.A.
 January 12, 1962: Revised sections 51.135-51.170 of the passport regulations
 were published In the Federal Register of January 12,1962 (vol. 27, No. 8).
 Mr. Souitw1NE. Now, the two newspaper stories I have just put in
 the record, from the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, and the Washington
 Post, indicate that a major witness failed to appear at the Elizabeth
 Gurley Flynn hearing. That is true, is it not ?
 Miss KNIGHT. I understand it is true; yes, sir. I have not seen
 the transcript, nor have I read it.
 Mr. Sou wiNE. Mr. Johnson, is it true that a major witness failed
 to appear at the Elizabeth Gurley Flynn hearing?
 Mr. JOHNSON. Yes, sir.
 Mr. SOURwINE. Who was the witness who failed to appear?
 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. ThomasTraecy.
 Mr. SOURw1NE. Where does he live?
 Mr. JOHNSON. He lives up in Long Island, N.F.
 Mr. SomiwINE. What does he do 9
 Mr. JoliNsoN, He works for the Pennsylvania Railroad -I believe
 in the pullman shop.
 Mr. SoURWINE. And why didn't he appear?
 Mr. JOHNSON. Before we go into-I have been under strict instruc-
 tions not to discuss the Flynn hearing.  However, this seems to be
 actually not involved in the Flynn hearing itself. I mean it is part
 of the hearing, I suppose. I am just debating within myself whether
 I should go ahead and tell you about the Flynn case-since the deci-
 sion has not been made by the Passport Office-we have not received
 the recommendations by the hearing examiner. And we are ordered
 to file briefs, And we still have 20 days to do that. I am wondering
 if I go into the Flynn case, whether I may prejudice the Government s
 case. We have gone to considerable expense and time and effort,
 and I certainly would not like to prejudice the case in any way,
 especially at this time.  I would certainly be glad to go into it
 all the facets of the case later.
 Senator Donn. When you say prejudices the Government's case, I
 don't know quite what you mean.

 Senator DODD. I understand. But who told you not to discuss it?
 Miss KNIGHT. Well, this was a result
 Mr. SOURWINE. Pardon me, Miss Knight.  Let Mr. Johnson say
 who told him not to discuss it.
 Mr. JOHNSON. Let me say, as it was put to me by Mr. Roger Jones,
 it would be very inappropriate for me to discuss the case.
 Senator DODD. Is this
 Mr. SOURWINE: When was this done?
 Mr. JOHNSON. This morning, sir.
 Mr. SOURWINE. By telephone?
 Mr. JOHNSON. Yes, sir.
 Senator DODD. Is this a sort of claim of executive privilege?
 What is it?
 Mr. JOHNSON. I don't believe so. I think Mr. Jones' view was that
 I shouldn't discuss the case while the case was still in a pending status
 in the Passport Office.
 Senator MCCLELLAN. Mr. Chairman-you speak of a case. What
 do you mean by case?
 Mr. JOHNSON. Senator, we had the hearing revoking the passpoh
 of Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. We had witnesses appear to testify.  The
 hearings have been concluded.
 Senator MCCLELLAN. Before the Passport Office ?
 Mr. JOHNSON. Yes, sir.
 Senator MCCLELLAN. You had hearings on revocation of her pass-
 port.
 Mr. JOHNSON. Yes, sir.
 Senator MCCLELLAN. And that hearing has not been decided-I
 mean you still
 Mr. JOHNSON. The hearings are concluded, but no decision has been
 made.  The hearing examiner has not yet made his report.  So ac-
 tually no decision has been made in the Flynn case.
 Mr. SOURWINE. Let me, ask a question, with the Chair's permission.
 You mentioned a hearing examiner. Does the State Department
 have any hearing examiners?
 Mr. JOHNSON. No, sir.
 Senator MCCLELLAN. I didn't understand that.
 Mr. SOURWINE. I asked if the State Department had any hearing
 examiners.
 Senator MCCLELLAN. What hearing examiners-from what source?
 Mr. JOHNSON. I understand this hearing examiner was obtained
 through the Legal Adviser's office, from the Civil Service Commission.
 Mr. SouRwINE. Why doesn't  -
 Senator MCCLELLAN. I am trying to follow this. You had a hear-
 ing examiner from where?
 Mr. JOHNSON. He was. obtained by the Legal Adviser's Office,
 through the Civil Service Commission.
 Senator MCCLELLAN. They assigned him?
 Mr. JOHNSON. Yes, sir.
 Senator MCCLELLAN. The Civil Service Commission.
 Mr. JOHNSON. Yes, sir.
 Senator MCCLELLAN. To hold the hearing on this revocation of
 the passport.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Yes, sir.
 Mr. SOURWINE. Isn't it true, Mr. Johnson that the reason' the
 State Department has no hearing examiners is because there is no law
 authorizing the State Department to have any or to hold any hearings?
 Mr. JOHNSON. Well, we do have the regulations
 Mr. SOURWINE. Talking about law.
 Mr. JOHNSON. That is right.
 Mr. SOURWINE. Now, would you give this committee your profes-
 sional opinion as to whether the issuance by the Secretary of State of a
 regulation providing for a hearing automatically authorizes his De-
 partment to hold hearings, where Congress has not given any such
 authorization?
 Mr. JOHNSON. Well, we certainly should have legislation.
 Mr. SOURWINE. Of course, you should.
 Senator MCCLELLAN. Is Roger Jones your superior?
 Mr. JOHNSON. Yes, sir; he is the Deputy Under Secretary for
 Administration.
 Mr. SOURWINE. Mr. Chairman, the reason I am inquiring about
 the failure of this witness to show up-the fact is, as I understand
 it, three witnesses failed to show up.
 This man Traecy, and two newspaper reporters; isn't that right?
 Mr. JOHNSON. That is right.
 Mr. SOURWINE. One newspaper reporter from the New York Times
 and one from the Associated Press. The State Department has by
 regulation set up this hearing procedure, which is not authorized by
 law, and has by regulation purported to grant passport applicants
 a right to be confronted at this hearing procedure with all the wit-
 nesses against them.  The State Department then set up its first
 hearing, with Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and they asked two newspaper
 reporters, who had been present when Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, in
 public, performed as a functionary of the Communist Party, to come
 down and testify to what they had seen. And it is counsel's infor-
 mation
 Senator MCCLELLAN. They didn't appear?
 Mr. SOURWINE. They did not appear. It is counsel's information
 that the New York Times decided it did not want its reporter to
 appear, and that the Associated Press decided they were not going
 to embarrass the Times by having their man there.  So that both
 reporters were instructed by their respective employers not to come.
 The State Department has no subpena powers and couldn't make
 them come. And this simply points up the fact that the State De-
 partment has by regulation granted to passport applicants a right
 which the State Department is not in a position to give them. And
 the net result is that under the regulations, since they cannot be
 given the right by regulation that is made a prerequisite to, with-
 drawal or refusal of the passport, automatically every applicant is
 going to get his passport. The next step will be, dust as sure as shoot-
 ing; the State Department will be up here asking the Congress to
 give it authority to hold hearings, and to give it subpena powers, so
 that it can go ahead with this.
 Senator MCCLELLAN. Let me ask this.
 You, Miss Knight, and Mr. Johnson-you are just carrying out
 your superior's orders in this regard.

 Senator MCCLELLAN. I was just trying to get it in its proper per-

 Mr. SOURWINE. I think the story is clear on the record now, except
 for one thing.  I have here the transcript of the proceedings in the
 Elizabeth Gurley Flynn case.  They were furnished by Miss Knight
 in response to the committee's subpena, a procedure in every way the
 same as in many former instances when we have sought information
 by subpena from her office. I believe that this should be made a part
 of this record.  This hearing record, if read by Senators; will be
 extremely instructive. It is a small sample of exactly what they are
 going to go up against every time they try to deny a Communist a
 passport.  It is a minuscule portrayal of the kind of obfuscation that
 a Communist attorney will throw in the way.  Every Senator ought
 to read it. I offer it for the record.
 Senator MCCLELLAN. I don't know what it contains. Is there any
 reason why it shouldn't be received?.

 U.S. SENATE,
 SUBCOMMITTEE To INVESTIGATE THE

 STATEMENT OF ROGER W. JONES, DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY
 FOR ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF STATE; ACCOMPANIED
 BY ABRAM CHAYES, LEGAL ADVISER; AND ANDREAS LOWEN-
 FELD, OFFICE OF LEGAL ADVISER, DEPARTMENT OF STATE
 Mr. SoURWINE. Mr. Chairman, at the start I -should like to offer
 for the record a letter by Senator Dodd addressed to Mr. Jones, and
 a copy of Mr. Jones' reply, this letter having to do with the possibility
 of any reprisals against Frances G. Knight, who was a witness here,
 and Mr. Jones' assurance that there would be nothing like that. I
 think that should be in the record.
 Senator HRUSKA. Very well, it may be accepted and will be part
 of the record at this point.
 (The documents referred to follow:)
 Hon. ROGER W. JONES,
 Deputy Under Secretary for Administration,
 Department of State, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. JONES : It has come to my attention as vice chairman of the Internal
 Security Subcommittee that Miss Frances Knight, Director of the Passport
 Office, may be in trouble because of her compliance with a subpena duces tecum
 issued by this committee.
 I do not wish to inject myself into the internal affairs of the State Depart-
 ment, but this situation appears to involve the rights and powers of the com-
 mittee, as well as the question of reprisals against a witness before the com-
 mittee. It does not seem to me 'improper to ask, therefore, and I dd ask, that
 the committee be advised of any charges brought or any disciplinary action

 29 \pproved For KWMs  Ab3M9M ?      DP66B00403R000500120001-1
 taken against Miss Knight or any other official or employee of the Department
 as a result of compliance with a subpena of this committee or appearance and
 testimony before this committee. `
 Best personal regards.
 Sincerely,
 THOMAS J. DODD,
 Vice Chairman, Internal Security Subcommittee.
 Hon. THOMAS J. DODD,        -
 Vice Chairman, Internal Security Subcommittee,
 U.S. Senate.
 DEAR SENATOR DODD : Thank you for your frank letter of May 16 concerning
 a response of the Director and Counsel of the Passport Office to a subpena issued
 by the subcommittee on May 11 "for production of a transcript of the proposed
 hearing in the Elizabeth Gurley Flynn case." I assure you of the Department's
 desire at all times to cooperate with the subcommittees of the Congress, both
 willingly and voluntarily.  I believe that the testimony by Miss Knight and Mr.
 Johnson demonstrated that desire. I regret, however, the Impression left with
 the subcommittee by Miss Knight that she may be in trouble because of her
 compliance with the subpena.
 As the officer of the Department with general supervisory responsibilities for
 the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs I was concerned about this par-
 ticular incident for three reasons.
 First, neither Miss Knight nor Mr. Johnson, upon accepting service of the
 subpena, complied with provisions in the Department's regulations which have
 been in force for many years and which were made a matter of record at the
 time of Miss Knight's appearance before the subcommittee. I am sure you will
 agree that it is essential for the Secretary of State or one of his principal depu-
 ties to be promptly advised when subordinate departmental personnel accept
 service of a subpena and to give authorization for compliance.  I do not con-
 sider that my action in calling attention to the failure to comply with regula-
 tions was a disciplinary action.  I do not contemplate bringing charges against
 either Miss Knight or Mr. Johnson.
 Second, the Department has taken more than ordinary care to conduct itself
 with complete legal propriety and proper procedure in the administration of
 passport regulations.  In this case (revocation of the passport of Elizabeth
 Gurley Flynn) the issue of proper procedure and the avoidance of any action
 which might he considered prejudicial seem to us of the utmost importance
 because of the relationship of the laws and the proceeding to the security of
 the United States.
 Third, the record demanded under the subpena was a part of a proceeding
 which has not been concluded.  In my judgment an incomplete proceeding, and
 transcripts relating thereto, should not be introduced into the records of a con-
 gressional committee prior to the completion of the proceeding unless the need
 is so great as to permit no other course of action. I was gratified, therefore, to
 learn that the subcommittee had ruled that the materials supplied in response
 to the subpena would be held and not Introduced into the record at this time.
 I believe that the subcommittee'R action will provide some very essential safe-
 guards against any claim of prejudice which might otherwise be made by the
 attorneys for Elizabeth Gurley Flynn.
 With best personal wishes,
 Sincerely yours,
 Room W. Jonas.
 Mr. SoURwIxE. Will you tell us, Mr. Jones, with whom was your
 letter to Senator Dodd cleared before it was sent?
 Mr. JoxES. The Office of the Legal Adviser.
 Mr. Sovitwn . Do you mean Mr. Chayes or Mr. Lowenfeld?
 Mr. JONES. To tell you the truth, I am not sure. I sent it down-
 stairs and asked it be cleared. Mr. Chayes was actually out of town
 then, or he was not, in at the time-I think that is correct.

 Mr. LOWENFELD. Yes.
 Mr. JONES. But it was cleared by that office.
 Mr. SOURWINE. Mr. Chairman, in view of the fact these gentlemen
 are both here together, is there any objection to asking questions of
 first one and then the other?
 Senator HRUSKA. On this point?
 Mr. SOURWINE. Yes.
 Mr. HRUSKA. None at all. I think it should be cleared up so that
 we get the full intent of the correspondence.
 Mr. SOURWINE. Does clearance of the letter, Mr. Lowenfeld, indi-
 cate that you concurred?
 Mr. LOWENFELD. I saw the letter and had it formally cleared. Yes,
 I concurred in that, sure.
 Mr. SouRWINE. Mr. Jones, do you agree with the testimony of Miss
 Knight, that any regulation which states that we could not consider
 confidential information makes it virtually impossible to deny pass-
 port facilities to members of the Communist Party U.S.A.?
 Mr. JONES. Would you repeat that? I have not seen the testimony.
 Mr. SouRWINE. This is testimony from page 17 of her testimony,
 that any regulation, and she was referring, of course, to passports,
 any regulation that states we cannot consider confidential information
 makes it virtually impossible to deny passport facilities to members
 of the Communist Party U.S.A.
 Mr. JONES. I don't think I could agree with that entirely, sir, no.
 Mr. SOURWINE. Mr. Lowenfeld, do you agree with that testimony
 by Miss Knight?
 Mr. LOWENFELD. No sir, I don't.
 Mr. SouxwINE. I would like to offer for the record, Mr. Chairman,
 a latter which has been received from Miss Knight.  The substance
 of the letter is to offer a substitute chronology for the chronology which
 we more or less received from her since she was up here as a witness.
 I don't know what the ruling of this committee will be regarding the
 substitution of the one for the other, but I suggest that this letter and
 the accompanying chronology be put in the executive records, and if
 the committee decides to substitute they can do that later.
 Senator HRUSKA. It will be received on that understanding and
 on that basis.
 (The document referred to is printed as an appendix to this testi-
 mony, beginning at p. v.)
 Mr. SOURWINE. This chronology, Mr. Chairman, refers under date
 of January 5 to a memorandum of that date from Mr. Cieplinski,
 Acting Administrator, to Mr. Roger Jones, proposing a revision of
 the draft passport regulations, and .1 wonder if we might request that
 a, copy of that memorandum be furnished for our records.
 Mr. JONES. From Cieplinski to me, January 5?
 Mr. SouxwINE. Yes, sir, proposing a revision of the Legal Division's
 draft of the new passport regulations and requesting that approval
 be withheld pending a reconciliation of differences of opinion.
 Mr. JONES. I would be glad to examine that, sir, and to notify you
 promptly.

 From : 8CA-Michel Cleplinski, Acting Administrator.
 Subject : Proposed regulations on the Issuance of passports
 Attached are the Legal Adviser's proposed amendments on regulations cover-
 ing the Issuance of passports (22 CFR Sec. 51.135-169) (Tab A). This draft
 was transmitted to SCA by the Legal Adviser's Office on January 4, as a final
 draft to be submitted for approval by the Secretary today and referred for im-
 mediate publication In the Code of Federal Regulations. We have reviewed this
 draft In careful detail and feel that as drafted it would be virtually Impossible
 to administer and misleading in that it would not result in the denial of pass-
 ports to any Communists except the most notorious.  In other words, the
 Legal Adviser's draft Is unacceptable to SCA and the Passport Office.  For in-
 stance, under section 51.138 (a) Procedure for Review of Tentative Denial, there
 is provided (as underlined In red) that the applicant will be informed of the
 evidence, etc.  In part (b) of this section, It Is stipulated that the Passport
 Office shall not make use of confidential security information.   Further, In
 section 15.142, the Board is precluded from using confidential information in
 making its determinations. Again, in section 51,10 under Hearings, the appli-
 cant must be informed of all evidence before the Board.  Simply stated, the
 Board will not consider or receive any confidential information which consti-
 tutes the major portion of Information in Communist cases.
 The Passport Ofl9ce, on December 15, 1981, had sent to the Legal Adviser's
 Office Its ,version with comments on proposed rules and regulations governing
 the issuance of passports.  It is believed that the regulations as proposed by
 PPT, particularly subpart (e), copy attached, Tab B, (the numbering system
 does not coincide with that prepared in the Legal Adviser's Office) Is more
 meaningful and realistic so far as concerns the proper administration of pass-
 port control in the Communist area.
 I strongly urge that the rules and regulations as proposed by the Legal Ad-
 viser's Office be revised In certain Important aspects and cover those important
 aspect provided in the version submitted by the Passport Office.
 It would be appreciated If your office would withhold approval of the Legal
 Adviser's proposal until these positions can be reconciled.
 Attachments :
 Tab A-Proposed amendments by the Legal Advi er's Office.
 Tab B-Proposed regulations by the Passport Office.
 Mr. SounwINE. All right.  I have another item which perhaps
 ought to be in our record, Mr. Chairman. These are the new passport
 application forms.  The fact that there were to be new forms was
 mentioned earlier in this record. and we asked for a copy.

 on behalf of the I)enart-nent of State

 Senator Gain:. Are you now saying that lie was making statements
 about this, i)ut that he was not informed on the subject f
 All., 1)ILI,~Jti. I am st-ltlug that ht: was not informed as to the facts
 of this intelligence operation any more. than the people. who made
 the press statements for NAS.1 were informed of (Iii' facts of it.
 Senator (xolcE. I)o you call that. responsible anti coordinated per-
 formancc ?
 Mr.         We are. getting at. this stage, :senator, into another
 question, the key question of intelligence.  When You have something
 as import a lit and secret a this, it. is important 14) limit the knowledge
 to the minimum number of people and this was strictly limited
 throughout the Government and we did limit it in tin State Depart-
 uient.
 tWFe (lid not think it was proper to inform our press people. There
 was a special procedure for people who were informed of this, and
 the prey people were not. so informed.
 Senator (Moat'.. Mr. Secretary, I ;till not cluest.ioning you about the
 initial cover statement issue you had in Turkey.  I ?un asking you
 about an official falsehood on May G, after you say the Departuient
 knew of the. flight pattern, assumed the Kahane wasc[own, a whole. day
 after you received information that tlie. pilot was probably alive and
 in the afternoon of .litt day after even I had been informed.  I ask
 you again if you think this is an example of the coordination which
 von earlier t4-1d its the I)cttartinent had.
 11r. I iI.IAIy. Senator. I will answer that.  I think it. took a major
 effort which was re.tcbecl the following day that we were going to
 abaandou our cover story and tell the trot II. 'T'hat decision could not
 be readied rapidly and quickly.  It, was reached after long sessions
 with the Secretary on Saturday and until that was reached, we saw
 no reason to inform our press officer of anything but the cover story
 which is what we were standing by up until that time.
 IIASI,  FUT.  Mit.  M-ltl'I'E S  STATEMENT
 The Cii. ncm.v.%. Senator, may I interrupt-?  I didn't understand
 why fir. ..Mi(o wasn't required to clear his statement at this time
 with yon.
 Mr. I)n.r,o :. I am glad to answer that.  Ali. W' bite sees the press
 every day, and ho does not know in advance necessarily the detailed
 quest ions that. It(, may be. asked.
 If a question comes that he thinks lie does not know the answer to,
 he does clear it wit It us.
 Now, the. clay befou r, when eve put out our statement, it was given to
 him and lie followed exactly what lie had been told.  I Ie, did not make
 any statement, that was quite as categoric as this statement lie made
 the following day.
 vin              Why didn't ho stand on the one that had been
 cleared?

 Mr. DILLON. This was just an answer to a question.  Why he did it,.
 lie thought he was telling the truth.  I think he acted perfectly all
 right.  He did not think that this was a new question. He thought
 he was following the cover story, which he was.  So he made this
 statement.  It wasn't a statement; it was in answer to a question.  I
 want to emphasize that.
 The CHAIRMAN. It was a very categorical statement that went far
 beyond the other statement.  That is what begins to complicate your
 situation, doesn't it?
 Mr. DILLON. Possibly to some extent, yes.
 The CiIIAIRMAN. The Senator from Ohio.
 IMPORTANCE OF INTELLIGENCE GATHERING ACTIVITIES
 Senator LAu5CIIE. First of all, I want to pursue this question.
 Shall we abandon or modify our efforts of gathering intelligence,
 covering the military activities of potential aggressors?
 First, I ask Mr. Herter this question.  At any time during the ap-
 pearance of Mr. Dulles, the Central Intelligence Agency Director,.
 before this committee, do you know of him at any time being chal-
 lenged or asked about how he acquired intelligence?
 Secretary IIERTER. That I cannot answer at firsthand. My impres-
 sion is that there was it very small group in the Senate with whom he
 conferred.  He has got this responsibility under the law, which was.
 written by the Congress.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. You have answered my question.  Have you ever
 heard of any member of this committee or any member of the Con-
 gress asking the Central Intelligence Agency to discontinue acquiring
 intelligence or to modify its methods?
 Secretary IIr:RTER. No, I do not.
 May I qualify that to this extent?  I think that Senator Mansfield.
 had introduced a measure which would provide for a different method
 of coordinating with the Congress.    That is the only thing I do
 know of.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. Would it be right to assume that at this very
 moment there is great probability that there are Soviet intelligence
 agents operating in our country?
 Secretary IIERTER. I would assume so.
 Senator LIUSCIIE. Do you know of any member of our Defense De-
 partment in a responsible position, or any person in any government
 who is responsible for security, taking the position that intelligence
 of a potential enemy's conduct is not essential for the proper develop-
 ment of a nation's own defense?
 Secretary IIERTER. I do not.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. Do I understand that you subscribe to the state-
 ment made by the President that for the protection of the security
 of our country it is essential that intelligence of potential enemies'
 conduct be acquired?
 Secretary IIERTER. I do.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. Now than, this question : Do you feel that it
 would be wise for our Government in the face of the discussions about
 peace and disarmament and banning of nuclear tests to discontinue
 our intelligence activities?

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 Secretai  FIERIER. I do not.
 Senator L.tuscnu. Would it be a danger to our country if at this
 moment while we are discussing disarmament and banning of nuclear
 tests we scuttle the Central Intelligence Agency
 Secretary HERTER. I certainly would not advocate anything of the
 kind.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. What is it historically concerning men in a re-
 sponsible position for the protection of a country, beginning from the
 earliest days of recorded battles about the use of scouts and intelli-
 gence agents, so as to properly guide a country in what it ought to do?
 Secretary FIERIER. It is a custom, sir, that has grown up, I imagine,
 ever since warfare began.
 KIIRIISIICIIEI''S DECISION NOT TO rARTICIr.tTE IN SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 Senator LAIISCIIE. Now then, the second question: Is it your con-
 sidered opinion that when Iihrushchev came to Paris lie had already
 decided not to participate in the summit conference?
 Secretary HERTr:R. That is our best judgment.
 Senator LACSCIIE. And that Judgment is formulated not upon
 what he has said but what lie has done; is that correct?
 Secretary HERTER. It is a combination of both.  But it is mostly
 in what he has said, and the assumption is that lie had received his
 orders before he went to Paris.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. Is it a fact that beginning in December 1959
 and going down into April, he has made statements indicating that
 the probability was that there would never be a conference?
 Secretary IYERTER. Not the probability that there would never be
 a conference but. that if a conference were held it would not turn out
 to his satisfaction.
 IKIIRIISIICIIEC'S MEETINGS WITII DE G ULLE AND MACMILLAN
 Senator LAuSCIIE. Ile was scheduled to arrive in Paris on Sunday,
 May 15; is that correct.?
 Secretary IIERTER. That is correct.
 Senator LAuscIIE. But instead of coming there on Sunday, May
 15, he came there on Saturday, May 14.
 Secretary IIERTER. That is right.
 Senator LAUscuE.And on ,unday morning he, with Malinovsky,
 at the early hour of 11 o'clock already had made an appointment to
 see de Gaulle..
 Secretary FIERIER. That is correct.
 Senator LAusc1. And at that meeting, this vigorous statement
 about what they expected of Eisenhower if Khrushchev were to at-
 tend the conference was read.
 Secretary IIFRTER. Yes; that was not only read but a copy of it was
 given to General de Gaulle.
 Senator LAIISCUE. Why do you think that he came there before his
 scheduled visit of Sunday and made it Saturday?
 Secretary FIERIER. Whey he came to Paris at all is the real question.
 That is a question that general de Gaulle asked him at the time of
 the one meeting when the four were present and to which the answer
 was completely unsatisfactory.

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT  ONF
 Senator LAUSCHE. So that at 11 o'clock in the morning he met with
 de Gaulle and laid down these four demands upon Eisenhower.
 Secretary HERTER. That is right.
 Senator LAUSCHE. Then at the hour of 1:30 in the afternoon he went
 to Macmillan and to Macmillan repeated those demands, that unless
 they were met he would not attend the conference.
 Secretary HERTER. That is right.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. Did anything happen between his arrival on
 Saturday, his action at 11 o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and 4:30
 on Sunday, that would have caused him to change his mind from
 what he was thinking when he left Moscow?
 Secretary IIERTER. Not a thing.
 PREMIER KHRUSHCH.EV'S DEMANDS
 Senator LAUSCHE. Now then, Mr. Secretary, getting down to these
 demands that he made; that is, he demanded that Eisenhower de-
 nounce the overflights; is that correct; and two, that he apologize to
 the Soviet Union.
 Secretary HER=,R. Yes.
 Senator LAUSCHE. And three, that he punish those directly respon-
 sible.
 Secretary HERTER. Yes.
 Senator LAUSCHE. And four, that Eisenhower promise not to repeat
 these flights.
 Secretary HERTER. Yes, may I add there, sir, that the demand for
 the apology was added; it was not in the original document. It was
 one that was added by him while he was in Paris as a fourth condition.
 Senator LAuscUE. Can we assume that Khrushchev honestly ex-
 pected that these demands that he made upon Eisenhower would be
 complied with?
 Secretary HERTER. He could not have possibly.
 Senator LAUSCHE. That is additional proof confirming the assump-
 tion that when he left Moscow he never intended to participate in the
 conference.
 Secretary HERTER. You are quite right, sir.
 Senator LAuscHE. Why couldn't he have issued this statement while
 he was in Moscow, and why did he go to Paris instead of making the
 statement in Moscow?
 Secretary HERTER. There it is a matter of speculation but I think
 that the desire to dramatize himself, the fact that there would be 3,000
 correspondents in Paris, that he would have a larger audience in that
 place, led him to take this particular route.
 Senator LAUSCHE. Was anything said anywhere about his train of
 misdeeds, of the Communist Reds', beginning from the very day that
 they were established as a country, in breaking treaties, in mass mur-
 dering of people, including our American boys

 done, I would like answer, to those questions prepared aura put into the
 record. One, broken treaties. Twyo, lxla-tieipat ion-not. of Red Russia

 when tlhe liberty fighters rose to pro cure liberty for themselves.
 Secretary IIExaf:ta. Senator, I saw those questions as they are iii-
 corporate(f in lire Congressional Record and we will be prepared to
 answer them.
 (The questions and answers referred to above appear in appendix 2.)
 Senator Lati~sc-iir:, T want. to say I ant. not prejeared to put a halo
 of honesty and holiness on Khrushchey and one of scorn and disgrace
 upon my country, not in this hearing or any other place. That. is all
 I have to say.
 T9te Cti.~ttali.~\. Mr. Secretary, the time is a quarter to 1.  1 think
 it would be a proper t line to adjourn until 2:30.

 The, Cli.ant~r.ati. All right, (lie. Senator from 'Wisconsin is recog-

 law of self-preservation.  You have heard that said, have you not

 is it not?
 Secretary M.-Irma. Yes, sir,
 Senator WILr:v. But there are difheretll rules that apply. too. are
 there not?  In wartime then it. generally means the penalty is death.
 In peaceful times like we have now, the penalty dellenals entirely

 all the countries oil earl ii and is still doing it?  That is correct, is
 it not?

 human nature is the law of self-preservation, then the best means
 that we can use to preserve the freedom of America, the CIA has
 been using when it has been using the overflight, the U-2 means; is
 that right?
 Secretary HERTER. Yes, sir.
 Senator Wn EY. Thank you.
 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.  We will
 return here at 2 :30.

 Secretary has very kindly agreed to go on today and, if the ques-
 tioning is not completed, to come back in the morning.                                     We will
 determine that at the end of today's session.
 I hope we can make progress.

 at 2 :30 p.m. of the same day.)
 Present : Senators Fulbright, Ilumphrey, Mansfield, Gore, Lausche,
 Wiley, Hickenlooper, Aiken., Carlson and Williams.
 The CIIAII ALAN. The committee will come to order.
 Mr. Secretary, there are one or two statements in your own state-
 ment I would like to have developed a bit for clarification.
 On page 12, at the bottom of the page of the mimeographed state-
 ment you say as follows :
 Proponents within the Communist bloc of an aggressive course must not be
 encouraged by signs of weakness on our part.  Proponents of a peaceful course
 should be encouraged by our readiness to get on with outstanding international
 business in a sober and rational manner.
 In which of these groups do you include Mr. Khrushchev?
 STATEMENT OF HON. CHRISTIAN A. HERTER, SECRETARY OF
 STATE-Resumed
 Secretary IIElrnui. That I think would be very difficult to answer
 categorically.
 There have been a good many estimates inade as to whether or not
 he really means some of the things that he has said with regard to
 peaceful coexistence, with regard to disarmament and other matters.
 There is another group that feels that this is a front for the same
 power line that Stalin used to take.
 I don't think it is possible yet to answer that categoricall y.
 I think that events are likely to show which of those groups he
 belongs to.
 The CHAIRMAN. Who did you have in mind when you wrote that?
 Maybe you can't categorically for all time designate him, but what
 has been your view and the view of the Department as to which group
 he belongs in?  I think that is rather important as to how we treat
 him.  Is it in our interest to discourage him?  If he were a member

 AMrovec~fg4geMW_? p  8           P?  9  000500120001-1
 of the aggressive course group, I suppose it. would be.  If he. is a
 member of the group who are proponents of the peaceful course, then
 it would be to our advantage to encourage or be cooperative within
 limits.  I wondered why you put that in there if von didn't have
 some idea of who does belong to these groups or how they are
 constituted.
 Secretary IlERTER. iat I was trying to describe here was in effect
 a middle course.  Insofar as Mr. Ishrushchev is concerned. I think
 those who have dealt with him directly were convinced that he was
 genuinely in favor of a dis:u?niament program. that he genuinely
 wanted, for the sake of developing the economy of Russia, a reduction
 both in expense from a monetary point of view and from a human
 point of view, of the great burden of armaments.
 Certainly there I would ut him in the second category.  His more
 recent behavior, however, has shaken my belief that this is entirely
 genuine, and, as I say, I think that only the events of the next few
 months and possibly even of the next few years can give a final
 answer to what you have asked.
 The CrrararAN. Can you identify any other members or any people
 you had in mind in citing these groups?'
 Secretary HERTER. 16.  I would rather have those who are real
 Russian experts do that. kind of identification, those. who are familiar
 with the individuals, more familiar than I am.
 There is no question but what there are still
 The CHAIRMAN. Would you care to have Mr. Bohlen comment on
 this question?
 Secretary IIEnmR. I would be very glad to have him, if you wish
 to.
 The CHAnmrAN. It would be very good to have him comment.  He
 is recognized, is he not, as one of our best Russian experts?
 Would you care to comment on this, :dir. Bohlen?
 Mr. BOIILEN. Mr. Chairman, my experience has been that it is not
 always possible to identify a trend in the Soviet Union with individ-
 uals.  As the Secretary said earlier we literally know nothing of what
 goes on in the hierarchy.  My impression of the statement the Secre-
 tary made is that it is possible to detect trends.  You cannot identify
 people with them.  My experience with the Soviet officials is that they
 follow whatever the agreed line is, whether it is hard or whether it is
 soft., with great consistency, and they just do not reveal sufficiently to
 any foreigner whattheir inner thoughts are to identify one individual
 with one trend or another.  But I think the indications are that both
 trends exist.
 The CHAIRMAN.  Well , don't you think we know more about Mr.
 Khrushchev than any other Soviet leader?  More of us have seen him.
 He has been around more than any other.   Don't, you have any view
 as to which of these groups Mr. Khrushchev would'be identified with?
 Mr. Boii  x. Well, any acquaintanceship with Mr. K hrushchev was
 when I was in there as Ambassador when he was not quite as promi-

 Approved F  ,    aW     0$f kiiCiAt$UR6680&40=0005001 ~t001-1
 nent as he is now. I would merely say that he, along with all of them
 are excellent actors [deleted] and are able to maintain whatever the
 common line is in their dealings with foreigners.  I think also there
 is a question of time.  I think, as the events of Paris showed, that
 there have been certain shifts of emphasis inside the Soviet Union
 which were manifested in part by what they did in Paris.
 Therefore, it is conceivable that Mr. Khrushchev could have been
 entirely serious in the line he was pursuing prior to Paris, and be
 equally serious in pursuing one diametrically opposite to it.
 The CHAIRMAN. If I may interpolate, do you mean that prior to
 the U-2 incident Mr. Khrushchev may have been identified with the
 second group; that is, proponents of a peaceful course?
 Mr. BOIILEN. I would not segregate out the U-2 incident alone,
 Mr. Chairman.  I think, as outlined in the Secretary's statement,
 there seemed to us to be three elements involved in this matter, and
 I think it is difficult to assess the value of each.  But, certainly, I
 would say his doubt as to the success from his point of view of the
 summit conference, that some of the views voiced by the Chinese
 Communists had probably supporters within the Soviet hierarchy,
 and the U-2 incident together brought about this change.
 I have no difficulty
 IDENTIFICATION WITH TRENDS IN TIIE SOVIET UNION
 The CHAIRMAN. I didn't wish to make you review all that was
 said there.  I was merely trying to find the inner meaning of this
 particular statement.              I thought that I could elicit some clarifica-
 tion since many of us don't know about these proponents of these
 courses or about any of these groups of people.
 Mr. BoIILEN. The answer, Mr. Chairman, is that I think we don't
 know. That you cannot tell whether X, Y, or Z in the Soviet hierar-
 chy, what particular line he advocates, because he never reveals any
 difference, even a shade of difference publicly, with what is the
 agreed line. It is quite impossible, I believe, for anybody to tell who
 within the leading group stands for one trend or the other.  You
 can only detect from external evidence that there appear to be cer-
 tain divergent trends and the individuals may not remain the same.
 WAS THERE A DECISION NOT TO SUSPEND FLIGHTS AS SUMMIT MEETING
 APPROACHED?
 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.  One other statement, Mr.
 Secretary, on page 5, point 2:
 The decision not to suspend this program of flights, as the summit meeting
 approached, was a sound decision.
 Can you tell us who made that decision, and when, and of the
 circumstances?
 Secretary HERTER. That is a decision that I think has been carried
 over the whole 4-year period. Here, sir, we get into certain technical
 aspects of when these flights would properly be conducted and could
 not be conducted, but I think the technical reasons had better be kept
 in executive session.
 The finding of a good time for a flight of this kind in relation to
 current events is almost impossible if you had known in advance that
 it is going to fail.

 The real issue was how urgent. was the information and is there
 anv one time (drat, is more favorable than another? Front a technical
 point, of view the (line was more favorable at that (late than another.
 From it diplomatic point of view, it scented to me that with the
 President scheduled to go to ixussia later, (hero would have been the
 same difficult%,; when Iiltrushchev was here there was the same difli-
 cu1tY, in efi't ct one would run into one time after another where
 dipl~nnat ically it would have been a bad brie.
 The Cu.ne..r.tx. I don't think I iuake myself clear.  I understood
 front your Inrrious statement and others that the program was agreed
 upon, and it. was running along without being suspended.  But this
 statement seems to leave the implication that a specific decision was
 taken not. to suspend ihetu in view of the conference approaching.
 Was such a decision taken?
 Secretary Ilta,rrat. That I can't. tell you.  I was not it party to that.
 The Cip:tnttr:i.x. Well, this says:
 The decision not to suspend this program of flights, its the summit meeting
 approached, was it sound decision.
 Was t here any decision taker not to suspend it ?
 Secretary IIr~rriF.tt. I know that when the (natter came before inc.

 The CIm. iiutt. x. Is it fair to say (lien that no specific decision not
 to suspend them was taken?  It. was allowed to go along without any
 decision being taken to suspend them.
 Sec,retar,y IIi:rrrr:rt. I think that is correct.
 The Crt.urnMAx. Therefore, the other way around is that rto posit ire

 Secretary Ili,.icri it. That is right.
 The  CllAT Ut1.  :. That st-a(c'ment, I think) needs clarification.  I

 decision was taken not to suspend their in view of tite simtmit, Isn't
 that a legitimate interpretation of that sentence?
 Secretary IlFatrr:a. I think (hat is correct.  May I read What the
 President said on that subject.? IIe: said :
 As to the tinning, the question was really whether t.) halt the program and thus
 forego the gathering of important information that was essential and that was
 likely to be unavailable ni a later date.
 The program went forward.

 The CHAIRMAN. So that there was not as far as you know?
 Secretary HERTER. As far as I know, there was not.
 PRESS SECRETARY IIAGERTY'S KNOWLEDGE
 The CHAIRMAN. I refer to this matter that Mr. Lincoln White did
 not know that Powers might be alive, the last question before we
 recessed.  Did Mr. Hagerty know whether or not he was at that
 point ?
 Secretary IIERTER. That I will have to ask Mr. Dillon to answer.
 I have no direct information.
 Mr. DILLON. I have no way of knowing whether Mr. Hagerty knew
 or not. In the ordinary course of business, a telegram such as the one
 which informed us of this rumor-it's only a rumor that we had
 received through other diplomats in Moscow-such a telegram would
 have been transmitted for information to the White House staff.
 Whether Mr. Hagerty knew about it or not, I don't know.
 QUESTION OP SOUNDING OUT PREMIER KIIRUSIICIIEV'S  F EELINGS
 The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary, was any effort made on the part of
 our Ambassadors or anyone from the Department, after the incident,
 to pursue Mr. Khrushchev's feelings?
 Was anyone instructed to approach him and express any regret or
 in any way to reconcile him to forgive or overlook this incident?
 'Secretary IIERTER. No, I don't know of any such thing.
 The CHAIRMAN. No approach was made?
 Secretary IIERTER. No.
 IMPLICATION THAT FLIGHTS WOULD CONTINUE
 The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary, what were the considerations which
 led to the decision, not only to assume responsibility for the flight, but
 to imply that the flights would continue in the future?
 Secretary HERTER. I have to take responsibility for the statement
 that was interpreted and if I may, I would like to read you exactly
 what was said on that score.
 This is a statement that was interpreted that we were going to con-
 tinue the flights :
 The Government of the United States would be derelict to its responsibility
 not only to the American people but to free peoples everywhere if it did not, in
 the absence of Soviet cooperation, take such measures as are possible unilaterally
 to lessen and to overcome this danger of surprise attack.  In fact the United
 States has not and does not shirk this responsibility.
 That is the statement that was interpreted that we were going to
 continue the flights, and it seems to me it was a pretty far-fetched
 interpretation.
 The CHAIRMAN. Then do you mean in that statement you did not
 intend to convey the view or the possibility that the flights would be
 continued; is that correct?
 Secretary IIERTER. No; what I was saying there was just what I
 have testified to today ; that from the point of view of our own in-
 terests and that of the whole free world, it is essential for us to do

 whatever we properly can in order to acquire information to avoid
 surprise attack or to be prepared for it.
 The C:' IIAm rA.N. But in view of that statement, do you think that
 Mr. Khrushchev could accept it and continue the conference?
 Secretary IiERTER. Yes; I certainly do, if he had wanted to.
 The CuAIRx?:irrER. I do.
 Senator WIL.EY. I didn't get the import of the questions when I
 came in that apparently referred to some different. groups.  What is
 the name of tie young man who defected the other day?        I guess
 that is what you call it. He testified on
 Senator L:~lsciiE. Meet the Press,
 Senator Wn.EY. Meet the Press.  It. is a long, Russian name.  I put
 what lie said into the record today.  But one of the important things
 he brought out, and I would like to get the former Ambassador's at-
 tention on this, was that there is a group of young people growing up
 in Russia who have different ideas, and he was about to go into detail
 on it when time ran out.  But anion   other things, he is the one who
 said-and this is important-he said some months ago that Khru-

 shchev and the powers in being would not permit the President to
 come to Russia, that they would find some excuse.
 Now, that is all in what he said over the radio here a couple of
 weeks ago.  That confirms, I presume your own idea that when
 Khrushchev came to Paris, he had already decided that he was
 going to throw the bombshell, and he would refuse to invite the
 President, and so forth; is that right?
 Secretary HERTER. That is right."
 Senator WILEY. So this is something that didn't result from the
 downing of the plane.
 I want to ask you a question.  Have you any definite information
 as to whether or not this young Powers is alive?
 Secretary HERTER. No, sir. We have no information other than
 that which the Russians have furnished to us.
 Senator WILEY. If that plane had been shot down, do you think the
 instruments that he had with him would have remained intact?
 Secretary HERTER. There, sir, I am not skilled enough in the tech-
 nique of shooting down planes. But I should think it is very doubtful
 if he was hit by a rocket whether either he or the plane would have.
 come down intact.
 Senator WILEY. Is there any thought that perhaps they have the
 plane?  They claim they have the instruments and they have shown
 something which wasn't the plane.  Do you think they have that,
 intact?
 Secretary IIERTER. They have shown a later photograph of a plane
 which those who built the plane feel is the plane itself. They have
 also shown pieces of the plane in Gorky Park in Moscow when they
 invited all the diplomats to come and look at it, and I think our people
 feel that that is a genuine part of the plane.
 INTERNAL CONDITIONS IN RUSSIA
 Senator WILEY. I want to ask the former Ambassador if it is true
 that the youth in Russia, the now class of youth, is growing up like'
 this fellow said. Someone said if he had been privileged to carry on
 his answer he would have said they are not satisfied with their standard
 of living, that they are not satisfied with the little opportunity they
 have to express themselves in the political life of Russia.  Do you
 know whether that would be true or not?
 Mr. BOIILEN. I think it is a fair assumption, Senator.  Of course,
 as you know, the possibilities for contacts in there during the period.
 I was there were considerably less than they are now.  The country
 is still totally controlled by the mechanism of the Communist Party
 of the Soviet Union. They control all modes of expression by press,
 meetings, or anything else, so it is very difficult to get any overt signs
 of the feelings of the youth or any other section of the population.
 But there are certain indications that the youth are looking forward'
 a.t some time in the future to considerably different circumstances.
 They hope for better material conditions and also undoubtedly hope
 for a period when they will have more freedom of expression and
 more ability to participate in the political life of their country.

 But this is very hard to document because people do not talk openly
 and freely in the Soviet Union.
 Senator WILEY. Well, you know that ferment. generally is all over
 this world. You know that the President of Turkey has been kicked
 out.. You saw that today, and you know what is happening elsewhere..
 Is there any reason why that yeast or ferment. should not. be operating
 in Russia among the youngsters?
 Mr. Butii,EN. There is no reason why it should not be and it. is a
 logical assumption it, is.  But. I should also say that the controls in a
 -society like ti c Soviet Union are ver  tight. Indeed and I have seen
 no sign that those controls are breaking down or weakening to the
 point. where the party is not in com fete control of the situation.
 They are able to stifle'? if you will, or hold in check this ferment due
 to the nature of their system.
 Senator W ILEY. Out of the 200 million Russians, how many of them
 do you think belong to the Communist Party?
 Mr.         I think the latest figure is sonie?where in the neighbor-

 Se.naicx' 1f. NSFlrt.n.:tlr. Secretary, it hit,; been reported that- at. the
 house liearings, you said there were indications that. even before
 11Ia.s t> t?he. Russians planned to scuttle the confe rence.
 Now, it seems to me if we are gointo estimate the. importance of
 the U-2 incident. in the collapse of the-summit, we need to fix the date
 when these indications in any significant fashion began to appear. I
 would appreciate, then, in the interest of saving time, yes or no answers
 to certain questions which I am about to ask unless there is a need of
 an elaboration.
 The first question: Are You aware whether any member of the
 Cabinet. or the. President had any reason to believe before. May 15
 when I irushchev made his demands for an apology and so forth,
 that lie would come to Paris and leave as he did .
 Secretary IIE:RTF.R. No.
 Senator MIANSFrE .n. Were there any indic rtions that Khrushchev
 planned to scuttle the conference before the U--2 plane was shot down
 on May 1 ?

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT
 Secretary HERTER. That I can't qualify with a yes or no answer,
 Senator.
 Senator MANSFIELD. You can go into detail there.
 Secretary IIERTER. I would say this, that Mr. Dillon's speech was
 almost a requirement as an answer to the allegations that had been
 made by Mr. Khrushchev against Adenauer and the Germans and
 his continued repetition which I have given the chronology of, of the
 fact that they were going to take this unilateral position sooner or
 later without its being an absolute ultimatum on the subject of Berlin,
 Germany.
 Senator MANSFIELD. In other words, Mr. Secretary, speeches which
 you and Mr. Dillon made were a counteraction to the gradual harden-
 ing of Mr. Khrushchev's speeches in the period preceding that?
 Secretary IIE,RT ,R. Entirely.
 QUESTION OF STATE DEPARTMENT KNOWLEDGE OF U-2 FLIGHT
 Senator MANSFIELD. Did Secretary Dillon propose that a U-2
 flight be undertaken prior to the summit conference?
 Mr. DILLLON. No.
 Senator MANSFIELD. Mr. Dillon, as acting Secretary, were you
 aware beforehand of the scheduling of the U-2 flight over the Soviet
 Union an May 1 ?
 Mr. DILLON. No, I was not aware of it.
 I was aware that there was a program of flights that might take
 place at some time when the weather was right but I think I was
 informed of that maybe a month or two before this actual time, and
 I had nothing to do with it afterward because I didn't in the ordinary
 course of my duties.
 Senator MANSFIELD. Your knowledge was,  in effect, general
 knowledge?
 Mr. DILLON. Yes.
 Senator MANSFIELD. Mr. IIerter happening to be out of the country
 at the time was, I assume, unaware of any specific flight but pe+r
 haps had general knowledge that these flights were being undertaken:
 and had been over a period of years.
 Secretary IIFsRTER. I didn't know there was a flight underway. The
 first knowledge I received was when I was in Ankara.  All I heard
 was this same report that a plane was down.
 PRESIDENT'S ASSUMPTION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR FLIGHT
 Senator MANSFIELD. Now, both of you have had general knowledge
 of this : Would it be a fair assumption to say, despite the fact that
 the President undertook, in a certain sense, personal responsibility for
 this particular flight, that he, too, likewise, had only general knowl-
 edge but that because of his position as the Chief of State, he would
 be held responsible under any circumstances because of his position
 of responsibility?
 Secretary IIERTER. That is correct.
 Might I just qualify one thin; ?  When you say he was familiar
 with this particular flight and his timing, so far as I kn w all of us
 were familiar with alternate possibilities of flights but not this par-
 ticular flight as such.

 and the President.
 Secretary IIEinnu. That is correct.
 STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR FLIGHTS
 Senator MANSFIELD. From what legislation or Executive orders, or
 both, was the authority for these flights of deep penetration derived?
 Secretary IIERZ-En. Well, presuma fly from the fact that I have here
 before me-I am told that this applied to two specific acts. The one
 that I am particularly familiar with, that I had a moment ago, is the
 one creating the Central Intelligence Agency.  The other is the Na-
 tional Security Act..
 Senator MANsmEr.D. Would it be possible to have copies for the
 record at this point?
 Secretar MIEirirEn. Yes.

 graph Twill lie gl ad to do so.
 Senator MANSFrrr.D. No, I would just like to have the pertinent
 parts incorporated in t lie executive record.
 Secretary-111,MT :n. Right.
 Senator MANSFIELD. Nov the question, to repeat, is by what au-
 thority have these flights now been suspended
 .
 Secretary IIFitTER. By direction of the. President.
 Senator MANSFIELD. 'By a Presidential directive.  Could we have a
 copy of that for the record ?
 Secretary Hrr-.TER. Yes; I assume so.  I don't know whether it was
 given in writing or whether it was done by word of mouth.
 Senator 4hixsFrEi.n. Well, will you look into it and see what you
 can do to comply with the. rerluest?
 Secretary IIERTER. Yes.
 (It was later reported by the Department of State that the directive
 was oral.)
 Senator MANSFIELD.  Will this order suspending the flights auto-
 matically remain in force after President Eisenhower leaves office
 and until it is superseded by another order of some future President?
 Secretary IlEirri:it. It- could be. The. President's responsibility as
 Commander in Chief which gives him the right to give an order of
 this kind would, of course, expire. with him.  It. would only be
 through some treaty obligation that there would be a binding commit-
 ment on the part of the United States to carry beyond his term.
 Senator if tslllr,n. Do I understand you correctly, then, to state
 that this order would automatically die wvitlt the leaving of office by
 President. Eisenhower, and to become effective again would have to be
 once again initiated by the. next President?
 Secretary HERER. ~I believe another President would be free to do
 as he sees fit.
 EFFECT OF I'-2 INCIDENT ON KIIRUSIICTIEV'S POSITION IN arss "

 suggested the possibility that Khrushchev's position at home may have
 become seriously undermined?

 Secretary IIEIrTEII. Yes.
 Senator MANSFIELD. Do you believe that the U-2 may have been a
 contributing factor to this undermining?
 Secretary IIE UEE.. It may have been.  May I elaborate on that?
 It may have been in the sense that it must have been a great shock
 to both the military and to the civilian leaders in Russia to find that
 they had been as open as they were for such a long period of time.
 Senator MANSFIELD. And to him as well.
 Secretary IIEItr1u. To him as well.
 Senator MANSFIELD. If Khrushchev should be forced out of power,
 is it the thinking of the Russian experts in the Department that his
 successor is likely to be .a man more amenable to friendly and peaceful
 dealings with the West?
 Secretary  HERTEIR. That, sir, I cannot answer categorically.  I
 think that that. is a pure matter of guesswork.
 Senator MANSFIELD. All right.
 What, in the view of our Russian experts, is the most probable
 coalition of influential forces in the Soviet Union and in world com-
 munism that could bring about Khrushchev's downfall?
 Secretary HERTER. There, sir, I am afraid of my own knowledge I
 could not answer that.  If you would like Mr. Bohlen to answer that,
 he is as good an authority as we have on the subject.
 Senator MANSFIELD. If you will, Mr. Bohlen.  But before you do,
 I would like to throw out indications that perhaps the military, the
 Chinese Communists and forces of that kind, might be considered.
 Mr. BOIILEN. Senator, I honestly in all sincerity think it is not
 possible to answer that question.  I think in dealing with the Soviet
 Union in view of the general secrecy prevailing in the Communist
 bloc it is only after the event that you can hope to trace them back
 and see what particular influences have seemed to have brought about
 given decisions.  There is literally no way in which a foreigner can
 ascertain what the varying degrees of influence of all factors which
 go into the making of any particular event.  If I might I will give
 you one illustration of secrecy. I was not there but in June 1957 for
 10 days the Presidium of the Central Committee and the Central
 Committee itself met in a violent inner row which resulted in the
 -expulsion from both of those bodies of Molotov, Kaganovich, Malen-
 kov, and several others.
 This went on for 10 days in Moscow and no foreigner in the capital
 and mighty few Russians knew anything about it.
 We had trained observers there.  There was an extremely alert
 U.S. press corps and not one of them got any inkling of this major
 development.  This I merely cite to show the degree of secrecy and
 if you are trying to get 'these things you are in truth looking into a
 crystal ball and a very cloudy one at that.
 Senator MANSFIELD. What you have said, Mr. Bohlen, is a reinforce-
 ment of thoughts you have previously stated in response to questions
 propounded to you by the Senator from Wisconsin.
 Mr. BOHLEN. That's right, sir.

 Senator MANSFIELD. And, once again that secrecy is so great there
 that it is impossible for a westerner to find out what goes on in many
 instances until after the fact is accomplished.
 Senator MANSFIELD. Is it the view of the experts in the Department,
 the Russian experts, that Khruslicllev, even if he remains in power,
 will now take a harder line, a reversion to cold war type tactics in
 dealing with the Western nations?
 Mr. BoiiLE.-4. The indications at present are, and I ani speaking at
 present, that this will not necessarily be so.
 I think we can expect a propaganda campaign.  The indication
 from his own statements and from such information as we have re-
 ceived from Moscow, is that there seems to be no determined policy to
 return to the depths of the cold war at this time.
 Senator !NfANsFIEW. Would you say that if that reversion does takb
 place, taking the opposite tack from what you have just said, and is
 pushed by the Kremlin or Khrushchev or his successor, that it will
 make more difficult the maintenance of peace?
 Mr. BOIILE\.  It would if it returns to a line. that we would call
 the lowest phase of the cold war, it most certainly would, Senator.
 However, there are degrees in this thing of return to the cold war sit-
 uation which are impossible to assess and which might not materially
 increase the danger of war.  But if it went all out., sealed off the
 Soviet Union and the Communist bloc from contact. with the outside
 world, attempted to exert pressures wherever they thought they could
 do so I think undoubtedly a much more dangerous world situation
 would be created.
 Senator M.x sFIEI.n. Mr. Chairman, I have other questions but I
 don't want to take too much time.
 The CHAIRMAN. Senator Hickenlooper?
 Senator ITICKE\ LnnrER. I don't have any questions at this time.

 Did anyone ask as to whether or not you had any personal knowledge
 of the U-2 flight.?
 Secretary IIERTFit. Of the program ?
 Senator IIu?Mrlisi-. No, of the particular flight.
 Secretary ITF.RTFR. It was included, I said it was included-I am
 sure it was included in a group of flights that I had been asked
 whether I had any objections to them.
 Senator ITi'irrirnFV. If you wanted to, could you have effectively
 vetoed such a Policy?
 Secretary IIERTER. No; I could only have given my advice to the
 President.

 Senator Hua~PIIREY. Would the Vice President be aware of these
 decisions?
 Secretary HERTER. I think that as a member of the National Secu
 city Council, he was aware of the program in the larger sense. I doubt
 if he was familiar with any of the individual flights as such, but he
 may have been.
 Senator HuMPnREY. The reason I asked that question was that the
 Vice President intimated on a television program, I believe the day
 before -the President's announcement in Paris, that the flights should
 continue.  The next day the President announced that he had already
 canceled them.
 The Vice President said they would continue, and the next day the
 President announced that they had been suspended.
 What I am asking is, would the Vice President, as a member of the
 Security Council, have any opportunity of knowing the decision that
 had been made by the President?
 Secretary IIERTER. There, the days followed so quickly one on an-
 other that I just couldn't answer that, whether that opportunity would
 have been offered or not.
 Senator HuMPIIREY. What I am trying to get at is the policy-
 making machinery.
 We have a subcommittee, as you know, that is studying the policy-
 making machinery of the Government, the Jackson subcommittee.
 I am a member of that subcommittee.  We had recently before the
 subcommittee Mr. Kennan.  We have had many of the prominent
 officials of Government and former officials of Government.
 The program of the reconnaisance flights was an established pro-
 gram, and apparently was agreed upon by the 'Security Council; is
 that correct?
 Secretary HERTER. The Security 'Council was aware of it, yes.
 Senator HuMPIREY. The Vice President is a member of the Secur-
 ity Council?
 Secretary IIERTER. Yes.
 Senator HuMPHiREY. If the Vice President states on P. television
 program that he understood that the flights would continue, yet the
 President announced the next day in Paris that as of the previous
 Thursday they had already been suspended, do you think there was
 any lack of communication between the responsibile officials of this
 Government?
 Secretary HERTER. There, sir, I am trying to think of the dates.
 The Thursday on which the President gave that order was the day
 that I went to Paris. I went to Paris that night.
 The President followed 2 nights later and whether or not in that
 2-day interval anything had been distributed with regard to that,
 order, I just don't know.

 Secretary IIERrru. I think as a method of carrying out negotiations
 it leas taken a hard knock.
 Senator IIuMPiiREr. Have you any idea as to how we are going to
 proceed in the months ahead?  I heard the President's address. It
 was a mood address. He gave a good accounting. He talked about the
 necessity of maintaining-I believe the word wasbusinesslike relation-
 ships-or at least normal relationships insofar as we can with the
 Soviet Union,
 Is there any projected plan as to how we will proceed with our
 contacts with the Soviet Union V
 For example, we have the Geneva Conference still in session on
 the nuclear testing.  I suppose the Disarmament Conference is still
 a reality.
 Is there to be any adjustment. in these conferences, any changes?
 Are they to proceed according to the past?
 Secretors ITERTER. Yes, the President, I think, made that very clear
 in his statement.
 Senator IT  rriinrv. Are there any plans for any type of a high
 level Foreign Ministers' conference or conference of sub-Cabinet
 officers?,
 Secretary IIERn'rR. As of now, there is not. I may add this with
 regard to the summit, that the four nations that were involved in the
 summit were the four nations who, as a result of the decisions and
 agreements reached after the war, were the four nations that have
 the responsibility for Berlin and for the final settlement of the whole
 German question, and that is the reason for those four, essentially,
 getting together.
 It is possible that again they will have to get together. Whether
 normal diplomatic changes would make progress or Foreign 'Ministers'
 meetings in advance would make a program so that it would Ile worth-
 while for them to come together, I just can't tell you. That is always a
 possibility. But almost any other subject, there are many other nations
 that are involved beside those four, and it is a great question in my
 mind whether or not that method of coming together for the resolution
 of problems world he fruitful in the future..
 Senator TTi-nirirmv. To other words, what you are indicating is that
 a summit conference merely ought to be the ratification, essentially the
 ratification, of decisions that have been tentatively arrived at, at the
 normal diplomatic levels.
 Secretary TTirzri:n. In my opinion, that is the most desirable thing.
 Senator TTr-T+rrTTRrr. T agree. ITo;v do von explain. or is there any
 explanation for what appears to be a contradictory hit of evidence of
 Gromyko's blustering up at the United Nations on the Soviet resolu-
 tion and, yet, of the apparent conciliatory behavior of the Soviets
 in recent days with respect to the quick release of our plane and flyers
 who strayed into East Germany and the recent broadening of Soviet-
 American exchange projects?
 Secretary TTE:RTr.R. There again, you have got one of those contradic-
 tions. As I was saying earlier, the fact that the attitude of the people
 in Moscow and even the officials with whom our Embassy officials have
 to deal, have been entirely normal since this incident.

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE        71
 It is very hard to reconcile with the very harsh words that both
 Khrushchev and Gromyko have uttered.
 SOVIET OBJECTIVES
 Senator HUMPIIREY. Do you lay any credence to the doctrine, or
 at least an observation that has been made, that while the Soviet
 tactics may change for awhile, that insofar as their general overall
 strategy is concerned, it will remain pretty much the same as it has?
 Secretary IIERTIm. Certainly as far as their objectives are con-
 cerned.  I think it was quite clear from some of this documentation
 that will be put into the record, that is the speeches that were made
 by Mr. Khrushchev, that he had laid greater and greater emphasise
 on the eventual triumph of communism over the world, and that he
 put particular emphasis on that in recent months before the summit..
 PREDICTIONS OF SOVIET ACTIONS
 Senator HUMrHIREY. I have a letter from a gentleman who is a pro-
 fessor emeritus of a university, up at Bennington College, who has
 had an uncanny record in my years of acquaintanceship with him in
 understanding what goes on in the Soviet Union.  His name is Dr,
 Bernard Tauer.                      He is a former Social Democrat of some 35 years
 ago from Austria, a professor of political economy, now retired.  He
 monitors Soviet broadcasts, studies Soviet literature, particularly
 photographs and what-have-you.  Just to give you a little back-
 ground, he predicted to me some 3 weeks, I guess it was, before it
 happened, the removal of Beria.  I have a letter here from him right
 before me, and it is a letter telling how Mr. Khrushchev was going
 to scuttle the summit conference, written on April 25, this letter is.
 And I also have a letter from him here in which he says :
 The Soviet leader will now do everything possible to prove that Eisenhower
 is a warmonger and an imperalis.t aggressor and not a man of peace, in action
 not merely in words.  We must, therefore, prepare ourselves for all kinds of
 provocations all around the world.
 His thesis is that Khrushchev had been selling the Soviet people
 upon the idea that President Eisenhower was a man of peace and
 a man with whom he could deal.  I don't mean deal, in the sense of
 the crudeness of that word, but one with whom. he could conduct
 reasonably good negotiations, and that when the President accepted
 the responsibility for the flights and didn't accept the opportunity,
 at least what some people say was an opportunity of removing himself
 from that responsibility, that Mr. Khrushchev took this as a very
 personal matter, since he had staked his reputation in the Kremlin
 and in the councils of the Communist Party upon the fact that he
 could work with Eisenhower.  Then Mr. Khrushchev felt that Eisen-
 hower had not only upset the diplomatic applecart, but, more im.por-
 tantl.y, from a subjective point of view-Khrushchev's-put Khru-
 shchev in a very difficult position with the Communist Chinese, with
 the rightwing Stalinists in the Soviet Union, so that Khrushchev is
 now making a personal crusade out of attacking the President.
 What is your view of this?  I am going to give you. this letter.  I
 have a whole series of these, and this is a very remarkable man., may
 I say.

 72        EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMI'IIT CONFERENCE
 For exam ple, I have a letter from him 2 weeks before the recent
 shakeup in the Soviet.T'ilion which Was not t(X fundamental, but indi-
 cating some of the ch;inges that were going t o be made, by a very care-
 ful analysis of broadcasts and meetings~ and literature.  I had this
 man down to see the late Senator Walter George, some of you may
 recall, and he was very helpful at one time. What is  our view of Mr.
 Khruslichev's reactions lately to the President, the' personal venom
 that lie seems to exhibit ?
 Secretary Hvicr a. I am particularly interested in two things, Sen-
 ator, in the letter that, you have just read; one, the fact that it was
 written before the TT-2 incident.
 Senator HU]rPiIRr:v. Yes.
 Secretary 14,wrmt. In which this authority cites the fact. that Mr.
 Khrushchev was going to scuttle the conference.
 Senator Iir rriiar:v. I think that substantiates essentially what you
 were saying this morning, your own observations on this.
 Secretary Iirirrr:a. Yes.  The second has to do with the fact that
 the President didn't accept the way out which     Khrushchev ap-
 peared to offer him. My own feeling with regard to that second mat-
 ter is that it. was very much of a trap. That what Air. I hruslichev
 thought might happen is that the President would disclaim personal
 responsibility and that then qtr. Klirushc.hev would say. "The situa-
 tion is even more dangerous than I thought, because this means that
 that same little frantic group in the Pentagon"-and that is the phrase
 that he used in his press conference- "is running the Government of
 the United States without the President knowing about it, and that
 makes our situation even worse" and he would have inveighed in
 exactly the same terms and asked the President for exactly the same
 apologies and punishments which he asked for later.
 I think that, the. element of personal pique certainly played a part in
 the whole show.

 Speaking of the reaction of the rest of the world. have you made
 any analysis of the reaction of the other countries of the world rela-
 tive. to the collapse of the summit meeting?
 Secretary HE-Fn. Yes, I think we have.  It isn't, of course, com-
 plete.  This will mean a study from K. great many nations and bring
 this altogether in one place.
 I think that, perhaps, the best indication has been the attitude

 But, by and large, we have heard no sympathy from the point of
 view of what you might call the uncommitted nations or the free
 nations of the world for the attitude that Mr. Khrushchev took.
 Senator AIKCEN. Are you satisfied we have not lost prestige
 throughout the world as a result, or lost more than Russia has?
 Secretary IIERTER. May I say, sir, that in my opinion our alli-
 ances are firmer than they have ever been.
 Senator AIIKEN. What was the significance of the shakeup in the
 Russian Government prior to the U-2 incident, I believe last April,
 was it not, when Mr. Kozlov was promoted; and coupled with that
 question, why don't we hear anything about Mr. Mikoyan any more?
 Has he been isolated or just gotten out of the news, or what has hap-
 pened with him?
 Secretary HERTER. Mr. Bohlen, who is our expert, is also the cen-
 sor of the document, so I am afraid he has gone out of the room at
 the moment.
 With regard to the disappearance of Mr. Mikoyan, we have been
 told this is just a normal vacation he has taken down to the Black
 Sea.  It is true in years gone by he had taken rather extended vaca-
 tions there,. and whether this is true or, not we can't say.
 'With respect to the shakeup, I think the only significance that it
 had were that two of the strongest members of the central committee
 were sent to other responsibilities and this may have been a personal
 strengthening of Mr. Khrushchev's power within the committee
 itself.  But rt was not considered very highly significant.
 Senator Arri.EN. That is, Mr. Kozlov's promotion is not significant?
 Secretary IIMiTEZ;. I don't think so. I didn't know that he as,such
 had been promoted.
 [Deleted.]  .
 A long time ago, I think when Mr. Averill Harriman was visiting
 in Russia he reported that Mr. Kozlov had been pointed out to him by
 Mr. Khrushchev as his successor, saying that he and Mikoyan were
 too old to carry on and that Kozlov was the No. 2 man.  But there
 was no telling whether he was saying that seriously or whether he was
 being flattering about it because Mr. Kozlov was there at the time.
 Senator ArnEN. I thought he made the best impression of any of
 our Russian visitors last summer. At least when he came before this
 committee, I thought he did.
 I have no further questions.
 The CIIAMMAN. The Senator from Oregon.
 Senator Mortsi. Mr. Secretary, I think it would be helpful for this

 and the part that NASA played in connection with the U-2 flight.
 I don't think the record is very clear as to what are the functions of
 NASA, and what jurisdiction, if any, the State Department has over
 NASA and what the relationship between NASA and the National
 Security Council is, and the State Department.

 Secretary Ilnitrrtt. NASA, as you know, is an agency devoted en-
 tirely to the peaceful development, of satellites and outer space ve-
 hicles of one kind or another.
 Its operations have now been separated out from what were called
 purely military operations, although it. is always inevitable in the
 development of boosters that. there should be in interrelationship
 between the two, because the utilittery vehicle and the peaceful vehicle
 have got the same problems of propulsion to get- up into the air. The
 witnesses of NASA, of routse, will be before the committee.
 [Deleted.]  Most of the F-`_''s are used by NASA in connection
 with purer' scientific work, meteorological work.  Actually, the
 Japanese 6overriment. found them tremendously valuable in tracing
 the course of tornadoes last year, and I think that. NASA put out at
 least three publications on their findings from the TT-2 weather
 observations.
 [Deleted.]
 With respect to the actual development of events in relation to
 NASA, I am sorry to say that I rant give you firsthand information.
 Perhaps .Mr. Dillon can supplement, that as it occurred while I
 was overseas and when !sir. Dillon was in charic~TP.
 Mr. Drr.r.ox. All I can say is as far as I Know the State Depait-
 ment didn't have any climct relationships with NASA on this matter,
 and the relationships that there were, were handled by the Central
 I)ttelligence Agency [deleted], so either Mr, Dulles or the NASA
 witnesses themselves will be able to inform you on that.
 Senator Motmst:. Why would NASA make a statement in regard to
 this plane if it was under file jurisdiction of CIA?
 Mr. DiLIoN. Du the cover story it was in the open, the plane, was
 under the jurisdiction of NASA.  Actually for this operation it was
 under the jurisdiction of CIA. [Deleted.]'
 Senator %["itst_ Therefore, NASA, in your opinion  was acting

 Mr. Drr,r.ow. I think so: yes.

 or had authority from CIA to issue it.
 Secretary Ilsirrt:t.. I think so.

 ment, CIA, Pentagon Building, and now NASA, and that there may
 be a need for a centralization in the State Department of the authority
 to authorize any statement by any of these agencies in regard to a
 situation such as this, because of some possible reason to believe that
 if this had. been centralized more, we would not have been having
 different statements coming from different agencies.
 Mr. DILLON. We were not aware, actually, of the fact that NASA
 was going to make as formal a statement as this, and it was somewhat
 of a surprise.
 The CIiAIRIIAN. I could not hear that answer.
 Mr. DILLON..I say we were not aware of the fact that NASA was
 going to make such a, formal statement as this, and I am not sure
 that the Central Intelligence Agency was either.
 All the relationships-as I said in my original statement, there, was
 coordination, there was a decision that the statements were going to
 be made by the State Department.
 That decision was taken and made known to the other agencies
 concerned, which were the Department of Defense, and the Central
 Intelligence Agency then on the morning of May 5.
 The Central Intelligence Agency had the relationships with NASA
 and undertook to pass that on. We' had no relationships with NASA.
 They didn't know we were in this thing, and somehow this statement
 was put out by NASA somewhat more complete than we expected
 but it was along the lines of the material that they had been furnished.
 VICE PRESIDENT'S KNOWLEDGE OF FLIGHTS
 Senator Mousu Turning to a question that Senator Humphrey
 asked-and may I assure you that I am quite nonpolitical in raising
 that-I am only seeking to find out who had knowledge of what in
 regard to the matter. I refer to the May 27 issue of the Washington
 Post, in an article by Mr. Chalmers Roberts in the course of which
 he said :
 Nowhere in the 37/2-hour television program did Nixon refer to any Presidential
 direction in the U-2 crisis, other than his approval of the flights some years
 earlier.   Nor was there any reference to his own part in the affair.  Nixon, of.
 course, sits in the National Security Council.  Nixon did say that he was
 "privy" to the U-2 reconnaissance policy "and. I do endorse it,"  He also said
 that "I knew about this flight."
 Now, my interpretation, Mr. Secretary, of your testimony is that
 neither you nor the President knew this specific flight was going to be
 taken at the time that it was. taken, but, that you. did know that. there
 was a general program for such flights and that this flight could be,
 considered as a part of that program.
 Now I ask you, do you have any reason to believe that Nixon knew
 anything that you and the President did. not know and that maybe it
 is just an unfortunate use of language when lie says "I knew about this
 flight," and that he probably means that he knew about the general
 program of reconnaissance?
 Secretary IIERT.ER. I would assume i t was about the general pro-
 gram rather than about the particular flight.

 NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL'S KNOWLEDGE OF FLIGHTS
 Senator Morse. But as far as Tou know, the National Security
 Council did not, brief its members in regard to any particular flights
 without also notifying the President in regard to specific flights.
 Secretary IIEirrmt. No, I think the National Security Council was
 only aware of the general program.
 Senator Molise. Are you a member of the -National Security
 Council?
 Secretary IILRrrn;R. Yes, I am.
 Senator Molise.. One final question at this round, Mr. Secretary : As
 you know I, along with everyone else, I think, who has the interest of
 peace at lae rt, am very much concerned about long continuation of
 this nuclear armament race.
 Do you think that. the United States and the Western Powers on the
 one hand and Russia on the other can continue this nuclear armament
 race with its constant increase and acceleration for another 10 years
 and not create the great probability of wear?
 Secretary IIERTER. I don't know about the great probability of war,
 Senator, but I would say certainly increase the chances of war.
 Senator :IMoRsti;. I know we are of one mind but I want the record to
 show this particular one mind: Do you agree with me that our genera-
 tion simply has the responsibility in history to find some honorable
 wa to end this nuclear armament race?
 Secretary IIER?rFR. I agree with you completely on that.
 Senator MoRSF. Do you think that we ought to do everything that
 we can to try to gret the United Nations to exercise greater jurisdic-
 tional authority in connection with this whole matter of armament
 race than we have been able to get it to do so far?
 Secretary II:RTF.R. Senator, some time ago I made a speech in con-
 nection with disarmament- in which I stated my views as to the great,
 necessity in the following years to finding some answer to this, and
 at the same time finding an answer within the framework of the
 United Nations of an authority which could maintain the peace with
 law, and I still feel that just as strongly as I did at the time I made
 that. speech.
 Senator MORSE. Mr. Chairman, my time is up and I want to make
 a request for data if I may.
 The CIIAIRMIAN. Certainly.
 Senator MoRSE. This morning we talked about the cases that we had
 offered to take to the World Court.
 Senator WILFY. A little louder, Senator.
 Senator MoRSE. This morning you talked about the cases that we
 were willing to take to the World Court.. I wonder if the State De-
 partment can compile for the, committee the record in regard to the
 World Court's operation, both on the cases it has handled and the
 cases that we have offered to have it handle that have been rejected
 by Russia or any other power.

 STATEMENT BY TIIE DEPARTMENT OF STATE: INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE--
 CONTENTIOUS  CASES  PROPOSED  BY TIIE  UNITED  STATES  AGAINST                                              SOVIET-BLOO
 COUNTRIES
 1. The United States has proposed to the Soviet Union the adjudication of four
 separate cases concerning aerial incidents.  In each of these cases, the United
 States has filed with the Registry of the International Court of Justice an
 application instituting proceedings.  These were the following cases : (a) Treat-
 ment in Hungary of aircraft and crew of United States of America (United
 States v. U.S.S.R.) ; (b) aerial incident of October 7, 1952 (United States v.
 U.S.S.R.) ; (c) aerial incident of September 4, 1954 (United States v. U.S.S.R.) ;
 and (d) aerial incident of November 7, 1954 (United States v. U.S.S.R.). Each
 of these four cases has been dismissed by the Court for lack of jurisdiction.
 The Court lacked jurisdiction because the Soviet Union has never accepted the
 compulsory jurisdiction of the Court under article 36(2)  of its statute nor
 agreed to jurisdiction specially in any case.
 2. The United States also instituted proceedings before the International Court
 of Justice in eases against Hungary and Czechoslovakia.   These were :  (e)
 Treatment in Hungary of aircraft and crew of United States of America (United
 States v. Hungarian People's Republic); and (f) aerial incident of March 10,
 1953 (United States v. Czechoslovakia).  Each of these cases was also dis-
 missed by the Court for lack of jurisdiction.                                              Again, the reason was that neither
 Hungary nor Czechoslovakia has ever accepted the jurisdiction of the Court in
 any way.
 3. The United States also instituted proceedings before the International Court
 of Justice in a case against Bulgaria, the aerial incident of July 27, 1955 (United
 States v. Bulgaria).  This case differed from those above in that Bulgaria had
 accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the former Permanent Court of Inter-
 national Justice in 1921, and it was the contention of the United States that
 Bu'garia was subject to the compulsory jurisdiction of the present International
 Court of Justice by virtue of article 30(5) of this Court's statute.  Bulgaria
 challenged the jurisdiction of the Court on several grounds, including a decision
 of the Court in another ease arising out of the same aerial incident that Bulgaria
 is not subject tothe jurisdiction of the Court, and a reciprocal invocation of the
 United States domestic jurisdiction reservation.  The United States has moved
 to discontinue the case.
 The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Kansas.
 DEVALUATION OF SOVIET CURRENCY
 Senator CARLSON. Mr. Secretary, recently one of our Nation's finan-
 cial writers, writing on the conditions in Russia, wrote that Mr.
 Khrushchev was proposing a devaluation of the currency as of Janu-
 ary 1, and he stated that no nation tampers with its currency unless
 it is in financial difficulty.
 What do we know about the financial and economic condition of
 Russia that would lead us to believe or know that he is planning on
 devaluating the currency?
 Secretary IIERTER. This I hadn't heard at all.  I hadn't seen that
 particular statement and I have seen nowhere in any report any indi-
 cations that they were planning to devalue their currency.
 There is no question but that their foreign exchange rate, their
 official rate, doesn't correspond with reality. They have two rates,
 one an official rate and one a tourist rate.  They are very far apart.
 One is 4 rubles to the dollar and one is 10 rubles to the dollar.  But
 from the point of view of their internal financial situation, I have
 heard no reports they were planning to devalue the ruble.

 78        EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SU,%"fIT CONFERENCE
 Senator CARLSos. We have had evidence that there is social unrest
 among the people,, that, they are thinking that they are entitled to.
 better living condtt ions, better homes and housing.
 Do we have any evidence of that ?
 Secretary IIFJI-I-ER. Yes; I think (here is. But this is a matter that
 Mr. Bohlen test i tied t.o a few moments ago.
 Senator C.1Itr so t. Tlhat there is?
 Secretary IIr_Inrrit. There is evidence of that. As Mr. Bohlen said,.
 it is impossible to get. documentary evidence, as such, because of the
 secrecy and the discipline in their society, but I think that every
 visitor to Russia who has had a chance to talk with the workmen or
 the students at the university and so on, has come back with that
 feeling.
 After all, Mr. Khrushcliev lies made a good many statements about
 the necessity of increasing the standard of living of their people.
 In their incentives that they offer from the point of view of their
 workers, better living conditions in these housing projects is one of
 the principal inicentives tlhat they have been offering in the past,
 giving people priority if their particular sections of a plant do par-
 ticularly well from the point of view of production, they will be
 advanced to better living quarters.
 I think that the urge for better living quarters and at better stand-
 ard of living, more consumer goods, is it very real one.
 Senator CAI(Lsox. Does the State Department have any evidence of
 a labor shortage in Russia based on a statement that was recently
 made that Mr, Mhrushclhev reduced his military strength because it
 was necessary to get sonic of the people back into the labor market?
 Secretary lIm:Irrr:R. Yes.  Very recently there has been a study that
 I think will be made available to you, made on the whole question of
 the labor problem in Russia.
 (The study referred to appears on p. 283 in appendix 2.)
 It is an extremely interesting one from the point, of view of the
 present situation and the relationship of women at work compared
 with men and the very large excess number of women over men that
 exists in Russia. today.
 ertainly every reason to believe that. If r. Khruslichev`s

 connection with the new land that was planted, an area that has not
 been too successful and this was something on which he had banked
 very heavily to increase the food supply of Russia and I think he had

 ISSUANCE OP PRESIDENT'S ORDER SUSPENDING U-2 FLIGHTS
 Senator GoRE. Returning, Mr. Secretary, to the examination of
 -whether there was a breakdown in coordination and administrative
 procedure, I would like to inquire when you personally first learned of
 the President's order that the U-2 flights would be discontinued?
 Secretary IIERTER.At the time that he gave it.
 Senator GoRE. When did he give it?
 'Secretary IIERTER. My recollection is that it was immediately after
 meeting at the White House on Thursday morning at about noon.
 Senator GORE. Did he give the order to you?
 Secretary IIERTER. No, he did not give the order to me.  I think it.
 was through General Goodpaster, but I am not quite certain.

 Senator GoRE. He was not present?
 Secretary HenTen:. Ile was not present.
 Senator GORE. Was this at a meeting of the Security Council?
 Secretary HERTER. No, I don't think it was the Security Council.
 I think it was at the meeting immediately after the Security Council
 at which there were three of us present.  Allen Dulles was not present
 and I have forgotten-I think Gates was present-after a Cabinet
 meeting it was.
 Senator GonE. I don't understand.
 Secretary HERTER. After the Cabinet meeting.
 Senator Gone; After the Cabinet meeting?
 Secretary IIERTER. Right.
 Senator GoRE. That settles that.  You heard the order issued and
 I will have no further question as to where it was issued and to whom.
 If you heard it issued to Secretary Gates, that settles one question
 definitely and finally.
 But you do not know whether the Vice President was informed
 about it?

 QUESTION OF PRESS SECRETARY HAGERTY'S KNOWLEDGE OF SUSPENSION OF
 FLIGHTS
 Senator GORE. On this question of coordination or lack thereof, in
 addition to NASA and the State Department, to which Senator Morse
 referred, there is the State Department, CIA, NASA, Mr. Hagerty,
 and officials within the Department and perhaps others.
 Did Air. Hagerty operate in this field strictly as press secretary or
 did he undertake some Executive function ?
 Secretary IlERTEil. I know of no Executive function that he
 assumed,
 ISSUANCE OF STATE DEPARTMENT AND NASA STATEMENTS OF MAY 6
 Senator GORE. Mr. Dillon, on May 5 Mr. Hagerty, I understand,
 told a press conference that the State. Department and NASA would
 issue statements. Were you aware of this
 Air. DILLON. I have very recently learned that he indicated that
 NASA would issue a statement as such.
 It was decided that the State Department would issue a statement.
 I hadn't been aware that he had said we were. But it had been de-
 cided and lie knew it had been decided that we were going to do it.
 Senator GORE. You say you very recently learned this,  How
 recently?
 Mr. }1ILLOx. I think a day ago or 2 days ago that someone from the
 press said that he had told the press when they were there that
 NASA would issue a statement, so that they could get their infor-
 mation from NASA.
 Senator GORE. Did Mr. Hagerty suggest to you that the State De-
 partment issue a statement.?
 Mr. DILI,ON. No, it was decided when we first heard of this, this
 news, as I said earlier this morning, at this National Security Council
 meeting or right after it flint. was held outside of Washington, that
 the State Department would handle the publicity on this, and that
 we would mace any statement that would publicity
 made, and it was known
 at that dine that we would make a statement.
 Now Air. Ilagerty was not at the Security Council meeting, but
 he was at that area out there where this exercise was taking place
 and so he was aware of the fact that the State Department would
 be making a statement at noon that day at our regular press con-
 ference time.
 Actually, the statement. was delayed 45 minutes. It was made at
 12:45 when our regular daily press conference took place.
 Senator GORE, Was it decided there that NASA would make a
 statement also?
 Mr. DiLLON. It was not to my knowledge, no.  It was not decided
 there that NASA would make a statement.
 Senator GORE. Who made that decision?
 Mr. Duu'N. I think that you have to ask NASA. I don't know
 who made any such decision,
 The fact. is, as I have said earlier, I thought that NASA would
 answer questions.
 I didn't know they were going to make a statement until I saw it.

 Senator GORE. You don't know whether -NASA or whether Mr.
 Hagerty made that decision?
 Mr. DILLON. I have no idea, no. I would assume NASA made it
 because we did know that NASA would have to answer questions
 because this was a NASA plane that was lost and the reporters were
 going to find out how high the plane flew, what kind of a plane it
 was, anything they knew about it, and we had given them-the Intel-
 ligence Agency had given them good answers on how to answer such
 questions.
 Senator GoRE. You say you assume this. You did not know it?
 Mr. DILLON. I knew they had given them that material.  I knew
 that as a fact, but we did not know that they were going to use that
 and put in into the form of a statement as it actually came out.
 Senator Goiu . But Mr. Hagerty did know that a statement by
 .NASA would be made?
 Mr. DILLON. I don't know that what he said meant that he knew
 they were going to make a formal statement or whether he was just
 using that as a phrase, indicating that they would answer questions.
 He may have thought they were going to make a statement.  I just
 don't know that.  He may have called them up and asked them.  I
 don't know.
 Senator GORE. Did, in fact, both the State Department and NASA
 make statements subject to Mr. Hagerty's notice to the press that they
 would do so?
 Mr. DILLON. The State Department made its statement and NASA
 made one about three quarters of an hour later, yes.

 Secretary HERTER. None.
 Senator LAUSCHE. Based upon his statements and upon the knowl-
 edge which he claims the Soviet possess, what day was it that he
 understood the first American plane flew over the Soviet?
 Secretary HERTER. I can't identify that.  My recollection is that
 when he was in Paris he made the statement that he knew about these
 overflights at the time that he was at Camp David and that he thought
 there was something fishy about President Eisenhower at that time.
 Senator LAUSCiIE. Well, then at Camp David he did state that at
 that time he knew that our planes were flying over the Soviet.

 Senator LAuSCinE. Well, if lie knew at Camp David that our recon-

 it, can you give any reason for his remaining silent on the subject?
 Secretary IItarrEit. Ile was asked that question in a press confer-
 ence in Paris.
 I Haven't got here the exact words of response but I think we could
 dig them out for you, and tell you just what he said in answer to that
 himself, but as I recollect, lie said lie felt that this was an inappro-
 priate moment to bring it up but that he did think there was some-
 thing fishy about the President at that time.
 Senator L.~vsciu-. Then at Camp David, when he knew that our
 planes were flying over his land, he was discussing what was to be
 the summit conference; is that correct?
 Secretory IiExrEn. What he hoped would be the summit conference.
 Senator   AUsciiE. And if we take him at his word, at that time he
 hoped to have a summit conference although he knew then that we
 were supposedly committing a flagrant transgression against his
 rights.
 Secretary IIER-rui. That is correct, from his own later testimony.
 Senator LerscuE. Can you reconcile those two positions as both
 being true, one. that he honestly intended to attend a summit confer-
 ence and, two, that ho knew our planes were flying over his land?
 Secretary IIawrEtt. N o5 it would be very difficult to reconcile the two.
 It is very difficult particularly to reconcile the tremendous issue that
 he made of it later when he knew about it all the time, according to
 his own statement.
 Senator AXE . Will the Senator yield?  You will find on page 16
 of the Background Documents Khrushchev's statement that Twining,
 the then Chief of Staff, sent a plane over Russia which gent over
 Kiev the day after he left Russia. It is the third paragraph on page
 16.  (See appendix 1, V. 1191.)

 he had, was supposed to have had while lie was at Camp David.
 Secretary IIFaTEit. That is my recollection. I would want to check
 on that. I. is possible that he may have said something at the Presi-
 dium meeting before he left 'Moscow. MIy expert here tells me he did
 not., and that was my recollection that he had never mentioned it until
 'he got to Paris.

 INFORMATION GATIILRING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN
 THE U.S.S.R.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. Now then, last January 18, Allen Dulles ap-
 peared before our committee, and at that time he merely scratched on
 the surface what I thought was a very vital question : the compara-
 tive ease with which the Soviet gets information in the United States
 and the impregnable wall that bars us from getting news in the Soviet.
 I ask you the question, Mr. Herter, to give your understanding of
 the facility with which we get information out of the Soviet, and that.
 which they get out of the United States.
 Secretary HERTER. Senator, as you know, we have what we call an,
 open society.  We are very proud of it in which we have complete
 freedom of the press, in which, except for matters of highest security,.
 very freely talked about, and a great deal is published.
 Our technical magazines publish a great deal from the point of view
 of vital military information. Our installations in this country, while
 no direct overflights are permitted, can be photographed with com-
 parative ease from an angle of one side.
 Generally speaking we have had no restrictions at all on travel
 in the United States except for a few very small circumscribed areas,
 like the Atomic Energy Agency plants, and we have had restrictions
 on Soviet citizens traveling in this country which have been taken
 entirely as a retaliatory measure because of the limitations put on the
 travel of Americans in Russia.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. Right.
 Secretary HERTER. The Soviet society, as you know, is a closed
 society, where one moves and goes only where they tell you you can
 go or when they tell you you can go.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. This morning in answer to a question, assuming
 that a Soviet plane was over the United States and what we would
 do about it, you said that there is no need of them sending planes for
 reconnaissance purposes because they can get the information without
 going through that effort.
 Secretary IIEETER. That is quite so.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. That is, they can go to Cape Canaveral and
 pretty simply see what is going on there.
 Secretary HERTER. Well, sir, there are newspaper men down at Cape
 Canaveral all the time and a good many visitors..
 Senator LAUSCIIE. Now the fact is that :
 The Soviets still consider that secrecy and the security of everything relating
 to their military operations is one of their great assets, and they have no
 intention whatever of changing that. Moreover they have no intention of letting:
 us into areas of m,iltary importance.
 Those are the words of Dulles.
 That is, there is a difference between the Soviet getting information
 here and our getting it in the Soviet.
 Secretary,  IIERTER. Oh, a very great difference,.  It is the whole,
 difference between an open and a closed society.

 the world in interest inimical to those of the United States.

 In his speech of '.flay 5, Afr. ITlirushchev referred to the U.S. over-
 flight- of July 2, 1956, April 9, 1960, and May 1, 1960.  He said that
 the April 9 flight caused concern within the Soviet Government and
 resulted in admonishments to the Soviet military not to let it happen
 again.

 KHRUSHCIIEV'S INTERPRETATION REGARDING CONTINUANCE
 OF OVERFLIGHTS
 The CHAIRMAN. This, again, raises this point that puzzles me very
 much.  The evidence is quite clear that Mr. Khrushchev, if he didn't
 know positively, certainly suspected that it was our planes that were
 .going across his territory, didn't he?
 Secretary HERTER. That is what I assume.
 The CHAIRMAN. And it comes back to this point that he hadn't
 raised such a terrible fuss about it until this one, that is, the May 1
 flight, which was shot down.  And, you said you couldn't reconcile
 the difference in his attitude toward the prior flights to the attitude
 toward the May 1 flight.  But doesn't the reconciliation, if it is ex-
 plainable at all-I am just asking you if there is one-does it not lie in
 the fact that our Government did take the position regarding the May
 1 flight and this program, that this is a deliberate program which we,
 the President, takes responsibility for, and which we intend to
 continue?
 Secretary IIERTER. Not which we intend to continue.  That has
 never been said.
 The CHAIRMAN. He interpreted it as such.  Mr. Khrushchev in his
 statement, which I have a copy of here-this is his language.  He
 says-this is a quote from part of our Background Documents (see
 p. 204, appendix 1) which says:
 At his press conference, Herter made an outrageous statement.  Far from
 feeling guilty and ashamed of aggressive actions, he justifies them and says
 that this will continue in the future.  Only countries which are in a state of
 war can act in this way. * * * Ilerter's statement has made us doubt the cor-
 rectness of our earlier conclusions that the President, the American Government,
 did not know about the flights.  Herter's statement says that this intelligence
 plan was endorsed by the Government.
 At least that is the way he interpreted it, and, as we said before
 Senator LAUSCIIE. Who is "he"?  Who interpreted it?
 The CHAIRMAN. This is a quote from Mr. Khrushchev's statement.
 He is interpreting what Mr. Herter said as speaking for the Govern-
 ment.  But is this not at least a possible reconciliation of the differ-
 ence in attitude between the prior flights and the May 1 flight?
 Secretary IIERTER. It might be if one wanted to interpret the words
 that I spoke that way.  There was no need of his interpreting those
 words that way.  Certainly from what I said, that is a very far=
 fetched interpretation. I think he was interpreting it for his own
 purposes that way.  I think that the one reconcilable feature between
 those two things is that in one case he had specific evidence and in the
 other case he did not.
 The CHAIRMAN. Then it is your position that neither your state-
 ment nor the President's press conference can legitimately be inter-
 preted as an endorsement and justification of the flights and a policy
 of pursuing them in the future?
 Secretary HERTER. Certainly not the policies oaf pursuing them in
 the future.  The President's statement that was made in Paris said
 it was perfectly clear from what I had said and from what he had said
 that there was nothing that allowed that inference.
 The CHAIRMAN. Did you in your. background news conference in
 Paris on Sunday, May 15, repeat the same statement that you had
 made prior thereto in Washington?
 Approved For Release 2005/08/22 : CIA-RDP66B00403R000500120001-1
 Secretary IIEItrnr.. I Was asked at that background press conference
 whether or not I had made a statement that we would continue doing
 this.  I repeated the very words that I had used in my statement.  I
 said I stood on those.  'Chat did not imply that we would continue.
 The CIi.llit_lt:1x. Prior to that second statement. Mr. Khi-iislichev
 had so interpreted it.  Were you aware that he had so interpreted it
 in his statement to the Presidium?
 Secretary IlEirrEn. I think I may have been, but if one took cog-
 nizance of every interpretation of Ili,; of everything that Happens in
 this country one would be spending all one's time trying to correct
 his statements.
 The CIi.uit_it.tx. You believe that it is an unreasonable and far-
 fetched interpretation of your statement or the President's in his press
 conference that these would be continued; is that correct?
 Secretary IIERTER. Yes, I do.
 The Cu:uinar. x. Is it or is it not a fact that the press in this country
 interpreted it in that same fashion ?
 Secretary IIEIcrER. I am told that sonic did and some did not..
 The CILLiRbt:lx. It might have been wise for us to clarify at. that
 time so that we interpreted it properly; don't you think?
 Secretary IIERTER. That, as I think I have indicated earlier, re-
 ferred to the cessation of the flights and not resuming the. flights.
 The President had reserved to state in Paris in coif'unction Willi the
 fact that lie was goinI to offer at. the United 'Nations his plan for
 aerial supervision of all nations that would be willing to submit to it.
 The  CHAIRMAN.  I)o you believe that any Bead of state, of any
 iinportant nation at least, could proceed Willi negotiations at a con-
 ference under the situation, at least as lie interpreted it, that is, that
 we intended to continue such flights?
 Secretary IL=.RTEIR.After all, Mr. fihrushcliev arrived in Paris and
 made an arrival statement there the Saturday before the conference
 saying that he expected to proceed and have fruitful results.
 The CHAIRIt1,tx. For the record, in order flint it is clear what is
 involved here, I would like to read one sentence, the one that is
 referred to by Mr. Khrushchev, which I think you clarified.  I quote
 from the statement- that was made by the Department of State on
 May 7 (see p.197, appendix 1) :
 The necessity for such activities as measures for legitimate national defense
 is enhanced by the excessive secrecy praettceel by the Soviet Union in contrast
 to the free world.
 I think that is the statement that led to the interpretation, don't
 you?
 Secretary IIEa,?rER. I .1111 sorry, sir, I have got before me now the
 statement of May 7.  1171iicli were those wvords?
 The Cn unM.~x. It appears on page 13 of the background docu-
 ments prepared by the staff, the first. Iiaragraph at the top of page 12.
 Secretary IIERrEit. That does not in any way intimate that they
 would go on.
 The Ct MMAN. You do not believe that that could reasonably be
 interpreted as meaning that they will continue?
 Secretary HERTER. RO.

 KIIRUSHCIIEV'S SPEECH AT BAKU
 Senator WILE, Y. Mr. Secretary, I have listened to this examination,
 and as you brought out, Mr. Chairman, I think that what we had
 better do is get down to what I think is the basic issue, not what
 was said or particularly done, but let's see what Khrushchev did.
 On April 28, in what has been called the speech at Baku, an exam-
 ination of that speech shows clearly that the Soviet Government had
 come to the conclusion that it would get nowhere at the summit
 conference.  Now, listen to this :
 Overnight all the Government-controlled radio stations-
 and get the date, May 25-
 all the controlled radio stations and newspapers in the Soviet Union began
 to prepare the people for a summit failure, and flatly blamed the West.  The
 :same bitter tones which Khrushchev used in Paris is to be noted in what he
 .said at Baku.
 And Baku was days before.
 In a violent attack in Baku on Secretary Herter and Under Secretary Dillon,
 on. that same day, the Soviet Premier intimated that he planned to use military
 .power to enforce the prospective seizure in the West.
 I quote Khrushchev:
 If, therefore, the Western Powers should not wish to sign a peace treaty
 with the German Democratic Republic, that would not preserve for them the
 rights on whose preservation they insist.  They would then obviously lose the
 -right of access to West Berlin by land, water, or air.
 In another portion of his speech, the Soviet Premier practically
 admitted that he had no hope of reaching any agreement at the sum-
 mit conference.
 He said :
 The nearer May 16, the day of the meeting of the heads of Government, ap-
 proaches, the more one-sided becomes the approach of certain statesmen of
 the Western Powers to the problems the participants of the conference will
 have to face.
 Then he goes ahead and gives examples attacking Herter and
 Dillon.
 KIIRUSIICHEV'S DECISION TO SCUTTLE CONFERENCE
 Now. I want to quote this. This morning I called your attention to
 this young Russian that stepped out from the intelligence department
 ,of the Russian Government, who was heard on the radio.  He said,
 and I quote :
 The Soviet Communist regime is in no way interested in allowing so popular
 .a man as the American President to, come to the Soviet Union. They are
 .definitely afraid of the impact such a visit can make on the people.
 Now if the issue is what caused Khrushchev to shoot his wad, so
 to speak, I think it is very clear that when he found out, one, that he
 couldn't make an impression upon his associates who were to be at
 the conference; two, that Mao Tse-tung and the Chinese were un-
 happy and Mao Tse-tung laced him up and down about this confer-
 -ence, as the record shows, when he found out that they didn't want it,
 three, that he was having trouble with his own gang in Russia; and,
 four, that the youth of Russia were simply getting all fed up-he

 decided before he went to Paris that he was going to let the balloon
 go u
 It wasn't the question of U    That may have given him the os-
 tensible opportunity to blow his top, but, as a matter of fact, he was
 all ready to go days before.
 Now if that is the fact, and I think it is sustained by the people
 who weigh the evidence then there is no need of our inquiring into
 what some folks feel. ~hey may be a little remiss hither and yon in
 our own public service.   hey were laboring under deep pressure.
 When you put yourself in the President's boots and go over there
 and see what he took, you have to say, "God bless him. He held his
 temper and ho handled himself so that he made all America and all
 the world proud," and the result was as suggested, as the record now
 shows. Look at the U.N., look at Britain, what they say about it.
 And the answer, I think is that we should just about stop our in-
 vestigation and not try to ball up further the issue.
 The CII AIRMAN. For the record I will say that the President, yes-
 terday morning, heartily endorsed this inquiry.
 Senator WILEY. That What?
 The CIIAIIi LAN. The President himself said in my presence that
 he heartily endorsed this inquiry, and if the Senator wishes to take
 issue with the President, why I su ggest lie talk to him about it.
 Senator Wu.EY. Oh, no.  1 hearldhini say that. Tani not disputing
 his saying it.  I am just simply slaying that where do we go from here
 ~
 now?
 Are we going further, are we going to try to ball up the agency
 that gets the information, that has done sucri a tremendous job, that
 for 31/2 years has given us information.
 [Deleted.]
 The CHAIRMAN. I think the Senator misunderstands the purpose of
 this meeting. It is not. to ball up anything.  It. is to try to clarify a
 situation for the benefit. of the committee-
 ommittee and the Senate and the
 country.  And I know of no one who has the slightest purpose of ball-
 ing up anything.
 Has the Senator completed his questions?
 SenatorWILEY. Yes I am sorry that I used that expression. What
 I meant was "confuse,l' and if there is going to be further evidence,
 would you mind telling me who the next witness is?
 The CHAIRMAN. There will be no other witnesses this afternoon.
 Senator WILEY. Well, do you expect to call some later on?
 The CHAIRMAN. Yes, Mr. Dulles is coming on Tuesday.
 Senator Mansfield-is the Senator through?
 Senator WILEY. No, that is the point I am making. I want to state
 in all sincerity, gentlemen, it is your responsibility if you want to call
 this man who has created this agency under the mandate of the Con-
 gress, that we have appropriated money for, and have not tied his
 hands and he is the one who brought about this; let us be frank.
 (Discussion off the record.)
 The CHAIR fAN. The. Senator is misinformed if he thinks that type
 of testimony is going to go in the public record.  There was no inten-
 tion at any time of putting this in the public record.

 Senator WILEY. Did you hear yesterday when the 'distinguished
 Senator from Ohio very plainly and bluntly talked about the leaks.
 I belong to a committee where I have seen them go right from the
 committee room right out in front of the fellows who have the mech-
 anisms for giving the news.  This is the first time I have blown my
 top, but I am simply telling you in the interests of my country, I think
 you should not call in this other agency.  I think that these gentlemen
 have told what the public knows now, but to bring in this other
 agency, I think would be a mistake.
 The CHAIRMAN. Does the Senator say that he knows Senators who
 have gone out of executive sessions before the microphone and re-
 peated what has been said here?
 Senator WILEY. I am not putting my finger on any Senators. If
 you want to know what is going on what have they got the television
 out there for and you are quoted every day as appearing before it.
 Let's be frank.  This is not the only committee where they spill the
 beans. But I am talking about the Central Intelligence Agency,
 gentlemen.  I happen to know something about it, and I know what
 it means, and people over in the I-louse know what it means, and I
 sincerely hope that you will not bring Dulles before you.  That is all
 I have to say.
 The CHAIRMAN. Senator Mansfield.
 JURISDICTION OVER THE AIRSPACE AND THE IIIGGII SEAS
 Senator MANSFIELD. Mr. Secretary, in an attempt to clarify some
 of the confusion which exists in some of our minds I would like, to ask
 some questions :
 What is your present official interpretation of international law as.
 regards the extension of national sovereignty skyward?
 Secretary HERTER. I don't think we have any.
 Senator MANSFIELD. We have no international law in that field as
 yet?
 Secretary IIERTER. That I know of.  There is no definition as to
 what is considered the atmosphere above the air.  There is no ac-
 cepted interpretation or verbiage when they are talking about the
 atmosphere.
 Senator MANSFIELD. Would you think it advisable to have an inter-
 national conference or conferences to decide the question of sover-
 eignty in the air over a country and also the possibility of regulating
 the seas in a more orderly fashion?
 Secretary HERTER. Well, as you know, we have tried for over a
 year to get the United Nations to get the outer space committee
 organized and underway.
 enator MANSFIELD. At our suggestion?
 Secretary HERTER. At our urging.  We have been urging that this
 be done. We have been pressing it. We have not been able to make
 any headway because the Russians refused to go along.  There have
 been further discussions of this proposal but we have been unable to
 agree on who should carry it out.  I think we are making progress
 but it is still one of those things where there is a constant dispute as
 to what should be done.
 Not only that but we had hoped to get it adjusted in time so that
 this year there could be a great international scientific congress be-

 cause you're dealing with new matters that the scientists are expert
 in that the layman is not, and the Soviets were unable even to allow
 the calling of that congress.
 Senator MANSFIELD. No. In other words, as yet there is no clari-
 fication of this particular matter.
 Getting back to my statement concerning regulation of the seas,
 we, of course, operate under the doctrine of freedom of the seas.
 But what I have in mind is the fact that it is my understanding that
 the. Soviet Trnion Can launch missiles anywhere A. wants to up within,
 say, three miles of our coastline if it, is in our vicinity, and we have
 the sn'?' rirrht under international law to fire missiles up to 3 miles,
 say of Vladivostok. Is that correct1
 Secretary I lFirrr:ta. Yes, and it depends again on what one takes as
 the territorial waters.  Three miles have been the generally accepted
 territorial limit.  The Soviet Government has claimed 12 miles and,
 ac von know, the recent Geneva Conference failed in reaching agree-
 ment among the nations as to what should constitute the territorial
 NN? .?r of c1i,1erent nations.
 Some nations have gone much farther than that, particularly
 with regard to fishing rigghts.
 Senator M,txsrn.I.n. 'flat's right, but what I have in mind is that
 times have changed considerably, even in our generation.
 Mr. Chairman, may we have order in the committee'
 The CIt:viHMAN. Ti is diflicult to have order.
 Senatori~-:Rrrr;I,D. The fact is that we have these satellites going
 skyward hundreds of miles and we have these missiles going thousands
 of miles into the ocean.  It was because of these new factors that I
 offered the suggestion that it might be well to have international con-
 ferences to take heed of changed conditions in this modern day.
 ? Te. have also advocated, as you are aware, peaceful uses of outer
 space, and we have made no headway.

 you said you were away at the time and (lid not know of this particular
 flight.
 Secretary Tlrmri'ru. T lcuew of the program.  I made that. clear in
 which the flight was included but not that particular flight.
 Senator GORE. I was specifying this particular flight.  Did T cor-
 rectly understand both of you?
 lfr. Dut.t.ox. Yes. Senator.  I had heard about G weeks earlier that.
 a series of flights would be undertaken and I had not heard anything
 since that lime but it was not in my regular order of business.
 Senator GORE. Would you repeat what you said? I did not under-
 stand it.

 of this flirlit, I Ray. that there was a program of particular flights

 Senator GORE. It could have been but you did not know of this
 particular one.
 Mr. DILLON. No; I did not know any more than that of this par-
 ticular flight.
 QUESTION OF DECISION NOT TO HALT PROGRAM OF U-2 FLIGIITS
 Senator GORE. The President, in his statement to the American
 people, the other night, said this :
 As to the timing, the question was really whether to halt the program and
 thus forego the gathering of important information that was essential and
 that was likely to be unavailable at a later date.  The decision was that the
 program should not be halted.
 Now, as I understand your reply to the chairman of the committee,
 you did not participate in the making of a decision to halt or not to
 halt this particular flight.
 Secretary IIERTER. I had approved of it.
 Senator. GoRE. On this particular program.
 Secretary HERTER. And approved of it as a part of the program.
 The question of the halting of it was not in issue at that time although
 I knew that the summit conference was coming.
 Senator GORE,. Well, my specific question is this: Did you partici-
 pate in a conference or were you aware of a decision; did you make
 a decision? What is the full extent of your knowledge of a decision
 that the flight would not be discontinued?
 Secretary HERTER. I know of no conference at which that matter
 was discussed.
 Senator GORE. Then would it have properly been
 Secretary HERTER. The only matter that came before me was the
 approval of this program.
 Senator GORE. How long ago did you approve the program?
 Secretary IIERTER. I can't tell you exactly, but it was some time
 prior to the time I went abroad.
 Senator GORE. Is it a matter of weeks?
 Secretary IIERTER. A matter of weeks.
 Senator GORE. Would such a decision have been properly within the
 province of the State Department?
 Secretary HERTER. No.  The State Department would not have a
 final decision in the matter.  The State Department would have an
 advisory position in the matter, and the CIA did consult with us
 about it.
 [Deleted,]
 Senator GORE. I understood the purpose of this hearing was to de-
 velop the facts insofar as we were capable of doing so, and to the extent
 that security would permit, to make available the facts to the Ameri-
 can people.
 Do I correctly understand the purpose of the hearing?
 The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Tennessee understands it as I
 understand it in spite of the opinion of the Senator from Wisconsin?

 The CuAIRm-AN. I certainly am concerned about what the Soviet has
 done.
 Senator LAUSCIIF. It hasn't been manifested here today.
 (Procedural discussion.)
 The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Tennessee has the floor.
 Senator '"'u.EV. May I just say one thing?
 The CHAIRMAN. Does the Senator yield to the Senator from Wis-
 consin ?
 Senator Wu.Er. I realize when I lut the ceiling before that I was
 probably not as coherent as I should be. I want to say to you with the
 conviction of a man who has lived long, that. the business of a com-
 mittee like ours is to develop facts for legislation, facts that are
 necessary to bring out curative legislation, or if you please, if you
 want to investigate an individual, that is another thing. We had the
 McCarthy hearings.  We know what that did, but here is another
 angle.
 It is not the business of this committee to expose to the people of
 this country a mechanism that is so important to r          l ife
 preserve the    and
 integrity of this country, and I mean the CIA, I know what it means.
 I happen to know something about what it has done [deleted] and to
 me, at least, and as I say, as a young man of past 710 summers, please
 remember that when you go into this thing, as you are going into it,
 you are going to expose a mechanism that is as vital to the if of this
 country its anything you can think of.
 It is that mechanism that made possible this series of three and a
 half years of exploratory missions over the Soviet Union [deleted].
 If that is what you are going into, just count your words.
 Senator GORE. Mr. Chairman?
 The CIIAIR.IM.t_\'. The Senator from Tennessee.
 Senator Goiu.. Dealing with the CIA is not a new experience for me.
 I happen to have handled in the House of Representatives the ap-
 propriation hill for the Atomic Energy Commission for 5 years before
 I was elected to the U.S. Senate.
 I was party to the appropriation for the, atomic energy program
 when the atomic bomb was being built in my State. No one ever heard
 those secrets from my lips. Every year for the past. 14 1 have listened
 to the testimony of the CIA from one to two or three or more times.
 I don't think that it is necessary that we violate the. security of this
 country in order to hear Mr. Allen Dulles' testimony.
 The CIIATRM. N. Will the Senator yield?  Mr. Dulles said to this
 committee when he was asked if he would appear, that lie would be
 very pleased to appear. He thought it. would serve a useful purpose.
 He had no objection.
 Senator Goiw. I am aware that I am pursuing very important
 questions that reflect upon the effectiveness of our country and the
 prestige. of our country. That is all the more reason why they should
 be pursued.
 I thought, this was the purpose of the hearing, to develop (lie facts,
 and insofar as they could be revealed to the public, to do so.

 QUESTION OP DECISION NOT TO HALT PROGRAM OF U-2. FLIGHTS
 Senator Gorm. To return to the question, insofar as either of you
 know, or any official of the Department, no actual decision to proceed
 with the flight or not to proceed with the flight was made.
 If such a decision was made, it was beyond your knowledge.    Is
 that a correct statement?
 Secretary IIERTER. Yes; I think that I ought to say this.  When the
 matter came before me, I had an opportunity of disapproving it and
 did not do so.  Not it, but the program.
 Senator GORE. But this particular flight did not come before you?
 Secretary HERTER. It came as one of a group.
 [Deleted.]
 Senator GORE. When did you first learn of the plane's misfortune?
 Secretary IIERTER. I received word in Ankara, Turkey, that a plane
 was down.  That is all.
 Senator GORE. From whom did you receive it?
 Secretary IIERTER. It was handed to me from a slip of paper that
 Mr. Livingston Merchant had.  Ile was sitting behind me at a NATO
 meeting and he handed me a slip of paper, "word has come that
 [deleted] a plane is missing."
 I don't think he said in Russia.  I didn't know which one of the
 flights it was.
 Senator GORE. It is your presumption that this was a communica-
 tion within the Department?
 Secretary IIERTER. Oh, yes.  I assume it was either in the Depart-
 ment or from CIA sources with whom we are constantly in touch
 overseas.
 Senator GoRr. I believe my time is up.  I will return to this.
 [Deleted.]
 The CHAIRMAN. You had one question of Mr. Bohlen.  Ile was
 called back at your request.
 Senator GoiiE. Yes. If I may digress a moment, I have been told
 several times, Mr. Bohlen, that in your press briefing at Paris, I
 believe on this 16th, you expressed the view that except' for the U-2
 plane, there would have been a, summit conference.
 Will you relate to us what you said at this briefing in this regard?
 Mr. BOHLEN. I don't recall, Senator, honestly that I made that
 statement-
 Senator WILEY. A little louder, please.
 Mr. BOHLEN. I don't recall that I made that statement. The press
 briefing that I held on the 16th was an open press conference on the
 record, and I do not recall any statement of that kind because my
 view then as now is that the U-2 was one of the factors that may have

 Senator Gctni;. YOU (lid not hot+i all off-die-record background
 briefin a?
 Mr. I3nflr,.N. I held a background later in which I outlined at. that
 conference the three factors that I believed and still do entered into
 the formulation of the Soviet position.
 Senator Goin.. Was a trainsc ipt. made of that background briefing?
 Mr. BoilLEN. I would have to check on that, sir.  I think there
 probably was.
 Senator Goon. Would you supply it to the committee if there was?
 Mr. Botli.F:N. If t here: i one, I would have no views on it.
 Secretary IIEIrri:R. I would have no objection.
 (The transcript referred to was subsequently furnished for the con-
 fidential use of the committ.ee.)
 Mr. Bor-a.r:ti. If them' is a transcript of it, but I recall the cireuni-
 stance5 very well in this, in that. three factors that I mentioned earlier,
 the Soviet pessimism as regards the outcome of the summit from their
 point of view; the pcr.;.ible opposition or questioning of its conduct
 and the V-2 matters were the three factors that appeared to ore to
 have entered into Soviet decision to torpedo thec uliferenco.
 I miF,ht add, Senator, for clarification on this, we have used the
 words ' scuttle the conference" quite often.
 There are various ways of scuttling it conference.  You can scuttle
 a conference before it 'begins or you can sabotage it from within
 [deleted].
 [Subsequently, Mr. Bohlen made available to the Committee the
 following statement of views he held in Paris at the time the Sum-
 mit Conference came to an end :]
 I would like to just briefly note-this is a personal opinion-that there
 were three elements in this situation :
 One, I think, was the situation in Moscow, whereby there were some people
 who were a little bit concerned about the manner in whichKhrushchev was
 conducting the foreign relations of the Soviet Union, for reasons already
 touched oil.
 The second was that I believe that he came to think-or the Soviet Gov-
 ernment came to think-that the prospects for any agreement at the sum-
 mit, on Berlin particularly, which is one that he had committed himself so
 deeply to. were very dim indeed. Before the plane incident:, they were visibly
 preparing the usual tactic of placing the onus in advance upon the Western
 Powers for any expected failure.  But had there twen no plane incident, I
 believe the conference would have run its full course.  There would have
 been discussions.  There would have been the normal, if you want to call it
 that, the normal type conference with the Russians, of which we have had
 many in the last 15 years, but without results.                                                   -
 The plane incident, the whole development connecting with that, moved
 things into a totally new dimension.  And I think that the evidence is con-
 clusive, that he came here to Paris with the idea of either torpedoing the
 conference or conceivably-because you cannot read their full minds-the
 hope that somehow or other that the pressure from our Allies would force the
 United States to capitulate.  I think he makes this very plain.  And this is
 where he made his major miscalculation.  Our Allies stood with us solidly--
 wonderfully well.
 Of course, it. is easier to say that now than it was before.
 Mr. Ditvni:X. I was told that these statements had been cleared by
 Mr. Din-DE". The CIA people with whom we were dealing, sir.

 DUTIES OF `11B. CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
 Senator LAUSCIIE. Mr. Herter, I have in my hand the National
 Security Act of 1947, and I have read from page 5 that part of the
 material which deals with the duties of the Central Intelligence
 Agency.
 Are the duties enumerated in this section complete?
 Secretary IIERTER. Yes; I think those are enumerated in that
 section.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. This section didn't place any directions on how
 intelligence is to be obtained.
 Secretary IIERTER.  No.

 PRESIDENT'S ASSUMPTION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR U-2 FLIGHT
 Senator LAUSCIIE. Based upon the questions that have been asked
 here today, one set implied that the President should not have told
 the truth.                     The next set implied that one of the inen lied.  And the
 third set implied that there was an inability to coordinate the views.
 Now, my question is-off the record.
 The CHAIRMAN. Take it off the record.
 We will make a special dispensatioii, whatever the Senator wishes.
 Does he wish it on or off ?
 Senator LAUSCIIE. Let it be on.  Has anyone given any thought
 about the peculiar position that the President of the United States
 is placed in in connection with the paradoxical situation that he is
 supposed to be a man of truth, and moral character, and yet requested
 to lie about these matters, if they are within his knowledge?
 Secretary HERTER. I am not sure whether that is a rhetorical ques-
 tion or whether you are asking me that question.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. Well, take it both ways.  [Laughter.]
 Senator GoRE. Rhetorical or oratorical.  [Laughter.]
 Senator LAUSCIIE. Well, let's assume that you were the President,
 Mr. Herter, and you were faced with the dilemma of telling a lie
 about what happened or telling the truth.  In either event you are
 hooked. What course would you follow?
 Secretary IIERTER, I can answer that one so far as I myself am
 concerned.
 The CHAIRMAN. He followed both.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. I don't know. I am beginning to wonder if what
 the Central Intelligence Agency is doing ought not to be a matter
 left with them and without the knowledge of the President.
 I have no other questions.
 The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary, I just want to make a coinment.
 The Senator from Ohio has put his finger on the very point that
 perhaps I didn't make clear to him earlier in my inquiry. This is, in
 my opinion, a central important question about this whole matter,
 the wisdom of the policy of involving the President in this kind of
 business, that is, espionage, which traditionally involves lying and
 cheating and, murdering and violating the sovereignty of countries
 with which a country is not at war and all of this. And what the Sen-
 ator has said is-perhaps I didn't make it clear-is exactly the point
 that I was seeking to raise an.d. to elucidate in the first line of questions
 that I asked.  And I agree with him this presents a very difficult

 dilemma and the question is the wisdom of departing from the tra-
 ditional ihistorical practice of not involving the head of the state in
 any espionage responsibilities that he is above and apart from. We
 follow that in the Congress, as you have just stated. [Deleted.]  We
 treat it differently, and I was suggesting and raising the question of
 whether it is wise to depart from the traditional practice that all
 important states throughout history, without exception in accordance
 with the Secretary's testimony, have followed. That is the very point.
 I don't think the Senator understood what my point was.
 Senator LAIISCIIE. I knew if I were President
 Senator WILET. You would tellthe truth.
 Senator LAUSCUE. I would tell the truth.
 Senator WILEY. So did he.
 The CHAIRMAN. Ile did and this is the answer.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. And could you expect him to do anything else?
 Senator WILEY. That is right.
 Senator LAUSCUE. And the only way you could enable him to per-
 form his duty to his country was not by having him know what was
 done and if he didn't know the question would be pursued why
 didn't he know.
 Senator WILEY. Ile taught the world a lesson in 1960, new diplo-
 macy, by telling the truth, and I think that it will echo down through
 the years.
 Senator LAUSCHE. So I don't know which group to follow.
 The CHATTI-MAN. It is echoing down the years already. This is the
 principal echo that has arisen from this whole matter.
 Senator LAIISCIIE. The tragedy is that this is made the principal
 echo but all of the misdeeds of the Soviet are looked upon as incon-
 sequential.

 statement. He draws conclusions that are not justified by the record

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE
 Secretary HERTER. Well, as I say, this had not been cleared with us.
 The CHAIRMAN: He is an employee -
 Secretary HERTER. I think it is very possible that a prepared state-
 ment had been cleared, but not an answer to a question. There is no
 way of clearing that, until one knows what question is asked.
 The CHAIRMAN. What I asked this for is because later on it seems
 to me one of the important things that might come out of this commit-
 tee hearing is a tightening of the policy which gives the Department
 of State and the Secretary of State a much closer control over public
 statements by other agencies.  It strikes me that we would get in
 much less trouble if all these people would clear with you or with
 whoever is Secretary of State of the Department, we will say.  Don't
 you think that would minimize the chances of inconsistent state-
 ments being made by members of the Government?
 Secretary HERTER.. Yes, that is so. But I think that anything that
 he may have said in a prepared statement on that TV program at that
 time had been cleared.  Insofar as answers to questions are con-
 cerned, there is no way of clearing them without knowing the ques-
 tions and in that way he was on his own.
 The CHAIRMAN. It is his responsibility, then, when he goes beyond
 anything that had been cleared?
 Secretary HERTER. Yes.
 Senator MANSFIELD. Mr. Chairman, on page 35 of the Background
 Documents on the summit conference, about 7 or 8 lines up from the
 bottom of the page, Mr. Allen, in response to a question from Miss
 Dodd, states the following :
 There are a lot of different definitions of "spying" and I don't want to try to
 quibble, but I do think I ought to point this out and that more people ought to
 recall it : When he went down he told exactly what his mission was and exactly
 what he was expected to do, and he was under instruction to do that.
 Now, the answer to the question, I just thought ought to be in the
 record, because there was some confusion about this statement in view
 of information which had been given to a group previously in the
 Capitol.  Again, I want to say, Mr. Chairman, that I am through
 with my questions of Mr. Herter, but I want to express my thanks
 to Secretary Herter, to Secretary Dillon and to Ambassador Bohlen
 for their candor and frankness today and to assure them that I, for
 one, appreciate what they had to say,_ and I think they have made a
 real contribution to clearing up a confused situation which confronted
 the committee as a whole.
 Secretary IIERTER. We are very grateful for that, Senator.
 Senator Wir EY. Of course, on this side of the aisle, I have praised
 your statement in the beginning and I will praise your conduct in
 the conclusion. You all did very well.

 The CHAIRMAN. Senator Gore.
 Senator GoRE. I do not wish to unduly tire the Secretary, but I am
 perfectly willing to come back after dinner or to come back tomorrow.
 I do have many more questions.
 The CHAIRMAN. Well, it is my understanding the Secretary-he
 looks very well to me-would prefer to go on tonight.  He does not
 wish to run over to next week.
 Secretary HERTER. I prefer to go on, Mr. Chairman.

 I wish to resume Iny- inquiry with respect to this particular flight.

 flights, that this would be it decision for Mr. Dulles to make.
 Secretary Iir:RTui. No, I never said that at all.
 Senator GORE. I beg your pardon?
 Secretary I1i:Rrr?:ir. I never said that at all. I said he was the opera-
 tional man who had to plan things, and then submit them for approval.
 Senator Gone:. WW'ell, what would be the proper agency to consider
 whether these flights should or should not be discont inuecl ?
 Secretary IHERTER. If the question of discontinuance had come up,
 if that was a decision to be made, we would have been asked advice on
 it.  We were not asked for advice on it.  I e gave approval to carry
 on with the routine planning that had been done from the point of
 view of flight.

 Secretary IIERTrai. That approval, as I say, is advice.
 Senator Gor.E. Was advice?
 Secretary IIEi1TEIr. Is advice. The President himself took the re-

 Senator GORE. Did your approval involve continuation of the flight
 through and during the period of the summit conference?
 Secretary IIERTER. -Not, specifically as such,  The approval con-
 stituted going ahead when conditions were appropriate for carrying
 them out.
 Senator Goi:E. Did you give no consideration to discontinuance at a
 time prior to the summit meeting or during the summit conference?
 Secretary IIEin'Eii. Senator, I answered that quest ion before when I
 said that there is no good time for a failure, that if the summit con-
 ference had debarred carrying out these flights the President's visit to
 Russia may have been the next thing that might have debarred them.
 It ma f lave   been debarred when Khrusllchev was at Camp David;
 it may have been debarred when Mr. Khrushchev was visiting in
 France.
 There may have been any number of diplomatic reasons why they
 shouldn't be conducted at a given period of time.
 In my opinion, the value of the information and the necessity of
 carrying out these flights under given conditions warranted t)ieir
 going ahead,
 Senator GORE. I am trying to be specific in my questions, and I am
 tryin  to elicit from you whether at the time you gave your approval
 for the general program some weeks prior to this particular flight,
 you gave specific consideration to the question of continuance or dis-
 continuance during or near the time of the summit conference.

 much on my mind as it was on everybody's mind, at that time.

 Senator GoRE. Another statement which the President made, I
 would like to read :
 Of course we had no indication or thought that basic Soviet policies had
 turned about.  But when there is even the slightest chance of strengthening
 peace, there could be no higher obligation than to pursue it.
 Now, on page 4 of your statement here today I would like to read.
 This is on page 4, beginning "Summit prospects dimmed."
 Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the second, third,
 fourth, and fifth paragraphs on page 4 be reprinted at this point in
 the record.
 The CHAIRMAN. Without objection it is so ordered.
 (The paragraphs referred to follow:)
 In the first weeks after the Khrushehev American visit there was a general
 improvement of atmosphere and people began talking, partly in hope, partly in
 some confusion, about "detente,"  There were comparatively conciliatory
 speeches on each side ; there was progress in the test-ban talks at Geneva ; a
 new Soviet-United States cultural agreement was signed November 21, and
 on December 1 the United States, the U.S.S.R., and other powers signed the
 Antarctic treaty.
 But clouds began to gather even then.  One of the earliest signs was the
 strong Soviet protest on November 11 against West German plans to build a
 broadcasting station in West Berlin.  Another was the Khrushchev speech on
 November 14 which was harder in tone, boasted again of Soviet missile prowess,
 and began a concentrated attack on Adenauer and the German Federal Republic
 which later increased and seemed to be a central feature of Soviet presummit
 tactics.     The reason for this attack is still a matter for speculation.  Perhaps
 they thought it would undermine the Western position on Berlin by helping to
 divide the Western Allies.  It had no such effect of course, but naturally
 rallied us to speak out in defense of our German ally.
 Khrushchev as early as December 1 also began repeating his threats to sign
 a separate peace treaty with East Germany.  He repeated these threats in his
 speech to the Supreme Soviet on January 14 and in his remarks during his visit
 to Indonesia and other countries in January.  On February 4, the Warsaw
 Pact powers issued the first formal blocwide commitment to sign a separate GDR
 peace treaty.  Thus Khrushchev's threatening Baku speech of April 25, though
 it was the most sweeping since February 19951), was only a harsher version of
 what he had been saying for months before.  I shall make full documentation
 on his speeches available to the committee.
 Not until April did we reply at length to this mounting crescendo of Soviet
 statements. We did so in order to keep the record straight-notably in the
 speeches of April 4 and 20, which Khrushchev attacked for starting arguments
 that he in fact had begun.

 Senator GoaE. You will sec from this statement., Mr. Secretary,
 that you contradict the President's statement, do you not?
 The President says :
 We had no indication or thought that basic Soviet policies had turned about.
 From what I have just read, you list one, two, three, four occasions
 where the Soviet policy had, in fact., changed.
 Do you wish to comment.?
 Secretary IIEJITER. Yes, I would be very glad to comment.
 I don't think that there is any essential disagreement in the two
 points of view.
 I am talking primarily in my statement in regard to Berlin and
 Germany.
 The President was talking about a series of things in which lie spoke
 of disarmament, mutual inspection, atomic control, and then lie added
 Germany and Berlin.
 As I testified earlier in the day, I think we all had hopes that there
 might be a  cissibility of making some progress, even though not in
 the German-Berlin situation but in the disarmament field, and as a
 corollary possibly in the nuclear testing field where it was not a sum-
 mit problem, but it would have been a three-power problem that could
 have been discussed in Paris.
 For instance, so long as there was any hope of making any progress,
 the President was willing to go.
 Senator GoRE. I didn't question the President being willing to go
 so long as there was any hope of progress.
 What I was asking you to comment on was what appears to me to
 be a contrast between the President's statement that there is no indi-
 cation that basic Soviet policies had turned about., and where you give
 almost a full page indicating that they had turned about. but you
 have finished your comment on that.
 Secretary IIERTsR. Yes, there was some talk here about basic policy
 and tactics in connection with the summit. I don't think the President
 felt events such as I cited necessarily mean that Soviet basic policy
 had changed.
 I think as he said after Camp David, he hoped that there was a
 mutuality of interest, particularly in the disarmament field, which
 would allow the great powers getting together in order to make prog-
 ress in disarmament.
 That had always been the area in which he hoped, because of the
 mutuality of interest, that we might make progress.
 I don't think that there is anything fundamentally opposed in these
 two statements.
 EXTENT OF FRE3rlFR HIr   SiICHF.v-S POWER
 Senator GORE. Now, I want to ask a few questions which relate to
 the first of the three questions on which I wish to examine your opin-
 ion; that is, whether the diplomatic failure in Paris represented a
 failure in policy.
 You recall that I submitted certain questions to you here on March
 22. At that time I asked you :

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO TH
 about the subjects to be considered at a summit conference before agreeing to
 have one, or do you think this is the proper way to keep the store?
 Secretary HERTER. It is a gamble. I don't know.
 Senator GoRE. You are gambling with high stakes, and it seems to me in a
 reckless manner.  I am disturbed to have the Secretary of State make the
 statements that you have made today about the summit conference ; that there
 is no plan, no purpose, no understanding as to what will be discussed and what
 we hope to attain there.
 Secretary HERTER. Mr. Senator, I view this as essentially a matter of ex-
 ploration.  We have the situation where an individual, Mr. Krushchev, is the
 man who makes the decisions so far as we know, for the Russians.
 Later on, I asked you :
 Is there any reason why the Russian dictator could not delegate the same
 power to his Foreign Minister as President Eisenhower should or does delegate
 to you?
 Senator HERTER. None.
 Senator GonE. Then isn't that a fallacious argument?
 Secretary HERTER. Not necessarily, because you are dealing with an indi-
 vidual personality who many believe wants to be the negotiator.
 Now, I read those things because one of the principal, if not the
 principal, justifications for going to the summit and for the exchange
 of visits was that Mr. Khrushchev and he alone spoke for the Russian
 people, but today you tell us on page 7:
 I might digress here to observe that it had been our experience at previous
 conferences with the Soviets, at least since the death of Stalin, that the Soviet
 representative, no matter how highly placed he might be, was bound by the
 collective decisions on basic policy matters made prior to his departure from
 Moscow.  Any substantive changes in those positions apparently required refer-
 ence back to Moscow before they could be undertaken.
 And then on page 8, you say :
 This meeting completely confirmed our conclusion of the night before that
 Mr. Khrushchev was operating within the fixed limits of a policy set before his
 departure from Moscow.
 Secretary HER=R. There appears to be an inconsistency in those
 two statements.
 When I was testifying here before, the visits of Mr. Khrushchev in
 which sometimes ho had an important person with him and sometimes
 he did not-
 Senator GORE. In which what, sir?
 Secretary IIERTER. Sometimes in which he had an important person
 with him and sometimes he did not, indicated that his situation at
 home was such that he had a great deal more leeway than had pre-
 viously been the case.
 When he went to Paris, and I think this has been brought out, he
 had with him Gromyko and Malinovsky, General Malinovsky,
 Marshal Malinovsky, who never left him for one moment at any time.
 This was a departure from previous occasions. This is why we said
 they had gone back to their standard policy of taking directions from
 home.
 Prior to that time I had believed he had greater leeway than was
 clearly indicated here in Paris.
 Senator Goin. So the assumption proved to be erroneous.
 Secretary HEETER. It is.

 In answer to a question from Senator Iitunplirey, I repeated the

 the more usual processes and pi'tx-edures of diplomacy.

 So that whet bier or not in the future the discussions to reach agree-

 ask you to say that summitry apart. from diplomacy failed.  I am
 content with your statement, in that regard.  fain sorry that I think
 it did fail.
 Secretary Hmm.:n. I would differ with you, sir, on the question of
 personal dipomac}? as against sumniitry.  I think that visits are, on
 the whole, useful th ings.
 I wouldn't say that that was something that should be discarded
 completely.  I think it. is particularly true that visits of ministers
 of foreign affairs, and visits of Beads of state from time to time can
 accomplish a great deal of good.  But I believe very strongly that
 insofar as Beads of state are concerned that is not the place to begin
 negotiations.  It is the place perhaps where there should be the
 culmination of negotiations.
 Senator Gozu. I will agree with you in that, statement.  The ex-
 change of visits offers opl)ortuniticvs.  But the formalization of it head

 agreements can be reached, is, in my view, a dangerous process, and
 a policy upon which we should never have embarked.
 Of course, it is easier to say that now than it was before.
 Hindsight, of course, we learned a long time ago, is better than
 foresight.
 The CHAIRMAN. Would the Senator yield for a moment?  I have
 one. or two questions and then he may come back to it.
 Senator Goim. Good.
 The CHAIRMAN. These I think have been covered but for clarifica-
 tion, I might ask them again.  Was there ever a, time when the Presi-
 dent authorized each flight in this program; that's never been the
 practice..
 Secretary IIERTEit. It has never come up to, the President.
 The CHAIRMAN. Nor of the National Security Council.
 Secretary IIERTER. No.
 The CHAIRMAN. It has always been under a. blanket authority
 understood?,
 Secretary IInnTEit. That is my impression.
 The CHAIRMAN. Is this blanket authorization under review, either
 constant or periodic review?
 Secretary HERTER. In my experience the CIA has planned a num-
 berof alternate flights at a time. [Deleted.]
 The CHAIRMAN. When the Department brought Mr. Bohlen back
 from Manila, and he was well-known as an expert on Soviet behavior,
 and this was, I thought, in anticipation of these summit meetings
 which had been discussed a long time, did he or any other of our
 Russian experts advise you or the President to wait and see what Mr.
 Khrushchev knew about the U-2 flight before making the NASA
 statement ?
 Mr. DILLON. The people in the Department who were familiar with
 Soviet policy took part in discussions with the CIA which led to the
 coordination and the agreement on the guidelines which were given
 to NASA, and those included the people who were familiar with all
 aspects of our policy.
 However, as we said before, we did not know that there was going
 to be a full statement by NASA.
 The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Bohlen was not consulted about the NASA
 statement.
 Mr. DILLON. Nobody in the State Department was consulted about
 the statement as a statement.
 The CHAIRMAN. Nobody.
 What puzzles me about this is why was there such compulsion, if
 there was, to make such an immediate reaction?  I have wondered
 why there was any necessity for immediately reacting to the first
 Khrushchev statement.
 It would seem to me much more normal to wait a while and see
 what developed.
 Was there anything that was compelling you to answer almost
 immediately?

 104     EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 Mr. DILI.oN. Yes, I would say so.  It was such an unusual and re-
 markable statement when Mr. Khrushchev said that American plane
 had been shot down over the Soviet Union, that we were not in the
 position to not make any comment whatsoever.
 As a result we had to make some comment, and we made the very
 bland statement which was put out on the 5th.
 The CIIAIR3rAN. I didn't mean that.  You misunderstood me.  I
 accept the necessity for the cover story, the statement.
 Mr. DILLON. Yes.
 The CiL IR34AN. It is the second one that went into such detail, It
 would seem to me that it would be commonsense not to follow up too
 quickly in the matter of timing.  What was the reason for that?
 Mr. DILU)-;. The State Department's second statement was innocu-
 ous too.  It didn't o into any detail, any more detail than the original
 cover story did. There. was great-if any detail, that was the state-
 ment that was put out by NASA.
 The CHAIRMAN. Is it not true that the NASA statement itself is
 what put you in a position of having to make a further statement?
 Is that true?
 Mr. DIL.T.oN.. The further statement, I think, was the next state-
 ment in this series, was the one that was put. out on Saturday which
 was made only at the time when we knew that the Soviets probably
 had the pilot., which was new information, and then the Soviets had
 already said they had hint, and had said where he was shot down,
 and the probability was that they had certain parts of the airplane
 because the picture which they had first put out turned out to be a
 fraudulent picture.
 BACKGROUND OF DErART]IENT OF STATE'S STATEMENT OF MAY 7
 The CIiATRlr:1N. Perhaps I don't understand the timing of it.
 It seems to me, if I do understand it, that you could have stood
 upon the cover story for some time before the necessity of any further
 statement, await ing developments.
 Mr. Dlm.oN. You mean, your question is why we made the state-
 ment on Saturday, May i, which was the first time we departed from
 the cover story.
 The CHATRSiAN. Yes, sir.
 Secretary IlFimi. That, as I think I have testified before, was a
 decision that was made in the light of the very full revelation of
 Mr. Iihr~ushchev in giving out, both as to the pilot's testimony, and
 as to the )arts and equipment, that had been recovered.  That was
 when we had to make the decision were we going to keep on lying
 about tli is or were we going to tell the truth?
 The CIIAIw1 N. II by there wasn't a third alternative is what I
 am tryingg to get at?
 Why (lidn t you just. he quiet and say nothing?  You don't have
 just the alternatives of either continuing to lie or to tell the truth?
 You could have said nothing.  I was just curious.  Was it ever
 considered that you didn't have to react ?                     being

 EVENTS INCID N             MljW,
 The press was hounding everybody, "What do you say now after
 what Mr. Khrushchev had said," it was a very difficult time in our
 .society, our form of society to have said nothing.
 The CHAIRMAN. I believe that was the statement in which you
 said "it has been established that insofar as the authorities are con-
 cerned, there was no authorization for any such flights."  Is that
 correct?
 Secretary HERTER. That is right.
 The CHAIRMAN. Which was not a truthful statement at that point,
 was it?
 Secretary HURTER. No, this was still partly cover.
 The CHAIRMAN. Still partly cover?
 Secretary HERTER. Still partly cover.  It was not until Monday,
 after the briefing had taken place before the congressional leadership
 here on the hill that the full statement was made.
 The CHAIRMAN. It was after that statement that the full statement
 was made?
 Secretary HERTER. That is correct.
 BACKGROUND OF DEPARTMENT OF STATE STATEMENT OF MAY 9
 The CHAIRMAN. That full statement, if I understood it-I think
 you have testified-was only after complete and thorough consulta-
 tion with everyone concerned, and had the unanimous support of
 .State and the President; is that correct?
 Secretary HERTER. It is, yes.
 The CHAIRMAN. Senator Gore, go ahead.
 Senator GORE. Well, when you made the final statement that the
 President did approve, he was responsible-I am not undertaking to
 quote you exactly-you also made it plain that he did not approve
 specific flights?
 Secretary HERTER. Yes.

 BLOW TO UNITED STATES MORAL POSITION
 Senator GORE. I will wait until Mr. Dulles' testimony.
 Now, I wish to make my own feelings explicit.  I have not intended
 to suggest, nor do I believe the chairman or anyone else has intended
 to suggest, that the President or any other official of the U.S. Govern-
 ment tells a falsehood.  I don't know of any requirement in Anglo-
 Saxon jurisprudence or any other jurisprudence stemming from
 Roman law that a citizen is required to incriminate himself.  I know
 of no requirement that a nation is required to incriminate or denigrate
 or defame itself.  I do not claim any sense of morals or sensitivity to
 moral standards greater than the average American, but I want the
 record to show that I was humiliated with official falsification, and I
 think millions of Americans were humiliated.  I can agree with you
 that our alliance stood firm.  I am happy that it did, but I think we
 would be deluding ourselves if we did not realize that this unfortunate
 incident has dealt a severe blow to the moral position of the United
 States.  I think we should begin to mend it.  The way to mend it is
 to ferret out our errors and our mistakes, correct them, and thereby
 demonstrate to the world our will and our capacity to survive this
 kind of blow-and I hope be stronger thereafter.

 WAS PRESrMMIT               SUGGESTED
 The CIi,IIRMM.lx. Mr. Secretary, there was one point that I over-
 looked.  1 had heard that Chairman Khrusllchev had directly or in-
 directly made some inquiry about the possibility of sleeting Mr.
 Eisenhower before the summit meeting.                     Do you know whether or
 not. that is so?
 Secretary' IIEI{TEu. No.  I know of no such effort.
 The C11. uiMAN. No effort ?
 Secretary IIER'rER. Actually. Mr. Kltrushchev, when he cause to
 Paris, or just before lie came to Paris, sent a note to the British and to
 the French, I think, largely on a procedural platter: no such note to
 us.  When the President arrived in Paris, there was just as much Op-
 port unit4? for Nil-. liht?ushchev to seek a meeting with liiui as with the
 others; and no such effort was made from any l ussiari source.

 'T'hin Cii. IRMIAx. Mr. tiecretary, have you drawn any inferences
 from this whole event relative to the military preparedness of the
 Soviet Union?
 Secretary IIERTEiI. Of course, my judgment would not be as good
 as that of experts.  And here, again, I wouldn't want to give my
 judgment as a considered judgment from the point of view of the
 record.  Thep is no quest ion but what. the Russians are very active iii
 certain directions, and that the intelligence that has been gained with
 regard to that activity has been of very great value to us.  And I
 think that is as far as f should go.

 EVENT
 when one is faced with certain events at a given time. I think obvi-
 ously we should be giving serious consideration to the very best
 method of the handling of anything of this kind that might happen in
 the future; and I think from that point of view, as the President said,
 we welcome this inquiry. We welcome a full disclosure as far as we
 could from. the point of view of responsibilities and coordination.  I
 thank you for your patience here today.
 The CHAIRMAN. I want to thank you for your patience and your
 frankness and candor.  I think you and your associates-Secretary
 Dillon and Mr. Bohlen-have been most cooperative in this whole
 hearing. I like to think that out of this one-as you know, rather pest
 project of mine-is that the State Department itself be given greater
 prestige and authority in controlling and coordinating all matters
 relating to our foreign relations-as I have tried in the case, for ex-
 ample, with the recent instance of control of the black market in
 Turkey.  I think your Department, the Department of State, ought
 to have more authority than we have in the past accorded it.  I am
 sure that some of our troubles do not relate to any fault on your part,
 but to the sort of institutional practices that have grown up-and
 people assuming authority to make statements without consulting you
 and the Department.. I feel at this stage of the proceedings that this
 may be one of the good things that will come out of these hearings ;
 that the prestige and authority of the State Department will be
 enhanced.
 Secretary IILRa-Eit. Thank you.

 Senator GoRr. Could I join you in commending the Secretary and
 his assistants for their candor and their patience and their diligence
 here today.
 Secretary 13ERTER. Thank you.
 Senator WILrY. May I also join you the third time by saying, in
 my humble opinion the evidence and the statement you made and
 the statement that Dillon made and the President's speech show con-
 clusively that the breakup of the summit conference was due to K.hru-
 shchev and no other cause.
 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.

 STUDY OF AIR TURBULENCE BY 17-2'S
 Mr. DRYDEN. There is an extensive program on air turbulence
 -which was begun by the National Advisory Committee for Aero-
 .nautics (NACA).                                                         It is a part of-as far as NASA is concerned, it
 it a part of the aeronautical activities transferred to NASA in ac-
 cordance with the National Aeronautics and Space Act.
 In this program, which began in 1956, there have been 200 weather
 flights of U-2 aircraft with NASA and air weather service instru-
 mentation covering flights extended over about 264,000 miles. Ninety
 percent of this flight time was above an altitude of 40,000 feet, and 40
 percent of it, or about 100,000 miles, was above 50,000 feet; and these

 flights have been Conducted in the Western Ignited States, Western
 Europe,'I'urkey, and Japan.
 I may recall to your m inds that the function of XAC.1 was that,
 of an aeronautical research agency to support the Government's pr?o-
 grani in the development of civil aircraft and military aircraft.
 RESE;ARCII  INFO1hMATION  PRODUCED
 We produced only research information used in the design of air-
 planes.
 One important part of this research information which certainly
 is brought. to your mind by some of the recent accidents to aircraft
 is that of loads on the aircraft due to atinosplieric. disturbances or
 gusts.  There are two types of problems: one illustrated by the ex-
 perience of the airplane which recently got caught in thunderstorm
 activity is that of the. maximum load which the airplane may reach
 which may tear the wings from the body.
 The of her and more insidious type of loading is the repeated load
 due to gustiness or rough air that many of you have often encoun-
 tered in flying. Thew repeated loads produce a type of brittle failure
 which we call fatigue failure.  This has, as you may recall, been
 encountered in one or two types of airplanes and remedied at con-
 siderable cost.
 Now, it has been the function of NACA to carry on a program to
 furnish the designer information on the magnitude of atniosplieric
 gusts encountered by airplanes, the frequency of occurrence of loads
 of different niagiuitmules. We have been enraged in the general type,
 of activity since 1933 and have data on all of the civil transports from
 that date.
 ARRANGEMENTS T o OBTAIN INFORMATIO-N ON AIR TURBULENCE
 That, of course, gives you a record of experience with the perform-
 ance capabilities of present airplanes, but it was our responsibility
 to try to get this information for air Manes y?et to be built. This meant
 that in practice we were always see ng the highest, and fastest air-
 planes to get information of this kind from, so as to be in advance
 of the development. of t lie commercial aircraft.
 To do this we made arrangements to get information from military
 ai  lanes.
 For example, at the close of World War II we installed our instru-
 ments in the BAG airplane used then by SAC; and during their
 training operations these instruments continued to record gusts and
 the data were sent to us for analysis.
 Now the pattern of operation with the commercial airlines and with
 the military has been the same throughout.. We meet with the owners
 and operators of the airplanes-whether an airline or the military
 service--come to an agreement with them that our instruments can
 be installed on their airplanes.
 In the early stages we send our instrument technicians to visit and
 supervise the installation of the instruments. We train employees of
 the airlines or the GI's in military
 The Cn~1n rAN. Dr. Dryden, does any of this have any relevance
 to the inquiry which this committee is concerned with?

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SU    I
 Mr. DRYDEN. It does. We will come to this immediately. We train
 our technicians to change the film and send the information to NASA
 for analysis. We have no detailed knowledge of the flight plans until
 after the fact; and, as a matter of record, we obtain information
 needed to analyze the data.            Observations extend throughout the
 world.  At the present time we have instruments on Pan American
 and TWA jets which, of course, go around the world. We have co-
 operated with foreign governments and airlines by lending instru-
 mentation.
 Now the U-2 operation is in the same general pattern of operation.
 This project, was organized in 1956 when [deleted] the capabilities of
 this new airplane were brought to our attention. It was able to fly at
 altitudes very considerably higher than any existing airplane.
 The program has been carried on entirely openly. There have been
 three reports issued, unclassified; there have been press releases on
 these operations from time to time.
 The program was unclassified except that the data which revealed
 the airplane could go higher than 55,000 feet were classified. They
 will now be declassified since the potentialities of the airplane have
 become known.
 [Deleted.]
 NEED FOR DATA AT IIIGIIER ALTITUDES
 I inust take you back to the atmosphere at the time.  These were
 the days when the airlines had had DC-6's and DC-7's, and Constel-
 lations.                                         At that time we knew the 707, the DC-8, and the Electra
 were under design.  We were told that the first of these airplanes
 would be developed early in 1959. All of our previous data with air-
 planes had been at altitudes generally not too much above 20,000 feet
 where these airplanes operated. The new airplanes would operate at
 35,000 to 40,000 feet, and the military services were interested in
 supersonic airplanes which traveled at much higher altitudes, so that
 there was at this time a great pressure on us to find methods of obtain-
 ing data, and the presence of the capabilities of the U-2 airplane
 seemed to us to give the answer.  Some of our advisory committees
 at the time were bringing to our attention the great need for this
 information.  I will simply read one extract, if I can find it quickly
 for you, and this committee called our attention to the fact that we
 did not have suitable airplanes available.
 There are three basic regions within which data are available, below 25,000
 feet, up to 30,000 feet with military vehicles, up to 55,000 where meager data
 are available from balloons and rockets and inference from meteor trails.  Exist-
 ing research vehicles are reaching to higher altitudes-
 and so on..
 It is recommended that emphasis be placed on obtaining quantitative infor-
 mation on air turbulence at the highest altitudes reasonably obtainable with
 existing research vehicles.

 Now this program was carried on from 1956 through the present
 time. NASA was established in October, October 1, 1958, and this was
 one of the programs carried over into NASA.

 I might recall to you that NACA was not extensively involved in
 aeronautical activities, that NASA, at present is engaged in inter-
 national space activities. So far we have not Lad any adverse reac-
 tions on the part of people with whom we are cooperating abroad in

 I think this gives the general background and I would be glad to
 respond to questions or to continue with the NASA chronology of the
 week of May 1, as you desire, Mr. Chairman.
 The CIZAIRMAN. Perhaps we ought to proceed with questions-
 [Deleted.]
 LINE OF RESPONSIBILITY FROM NASA TO THE PRESIDENT
 Do you report directly to the President? What is your relation-
 ship to the rest of the Government?
 Mr. DRYDEN. At that time the NAC A was managed by a committee
 of 17 persons appointed by the President who did report directly to
 him.
 I was the chief executive officer reporting to the committee at the
 time this project was started.
 The CIHAIRMAN. In 1956?
 Mr. DRYDEN. 1956.
 The CHAIRMAN. At that time the agency was known as the NACA?
 Mr. DRYDEN. That is correct.
 The CHAIRMAN. When did it change its name to NASA?
 Mr. DRYDEN. On October 1, 1958 it not only changed its name but
 was collected with other parts of the Government into a completely
 new agency, the NASA.
 The CIHAIRMAN. Does it report to the President?
 Mr. DRYDEN. It, reports directly to the President, sir.
 The CILtIRxAN. There is a committee of 17 you say?
 Mr. DRYDENi. There is not a committee in NASA. There is an Ad-
 ministrator and Depute Administrator appointed by the President
 with the advice and consent of the Senate.
 The CHAIRMAN. Is there anyone on the staff of the White House
 who is given the duty of receiving your reports?
 Mr. DRYDEN. Doctor Glennan reports and talks very frequently
 with the President himself. Ile does keep the Science Adviser fully
 informed of our activities in space.
 The CIHAIRMMAN. Who is the Science Adviser?
 Mr. DRYDEN. I)r. Kistiakowsky.
 The CHAIRMAN. So if anyone has the direct responsibility within
 theI''hite House, the office of the Presidency, it is Dr.
 Mr. DRYDs ;. Kistiakowsky.  He is the President's adviser on
 science and technology. He has no line responsibility. He is an ad-
 viser to the President.
 REPORT OF t'-2'S LOSS
 The CHAIRMAN. The first that you knew of this was the loss of the
 U-2plane on May 1 ?
 Mr. DRYDEN. May 1 it. was reported to the Administrator and my-
 self that a U-2 had been lost, without further detail.

 ANTICIPATION OF INQUIRIES ABOUT LOSS
 The CHAIRMAN. Did CIA consult with you as to the precise lan-
 guag'e of the release of May 5 ?
 Mr. DRYDEN. What was
 The CHAIRMAN. Who drew up that language?
 Mr. DRYDEN. It was discussed in consultation. The questions the
 press asked were : who is the pilot, where was the airplane going, what
 information do you have about it?
 So that between CIA and ourselves, a list of these questions which
 we had received was recorded, and the general nature of the answers
 to these questions decided upon. Now, let me tell you about the so-
 called release of the statement. On the morning of Thursday, May
 5 was Khrushchev's announcement that the plane was shot down.
 ~omewhere between 11 and 12 o'clock, I believe, the President directed
 an inquiry and public report on the missing plane, and as reported
 in the Herald Tribune-I do not have any other stenographic record-
 in quotes, it says :
 At the White House, Mr. Hagerty announced at the direction of the President
 a complete inquiry is being made.  The results of these inquiries, the facts as
 developed will be made public by the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
 tration and the Department of State.
 BACKGROUND OF THE MAY 5 NASA RELEASE
 The reporters who had listened to Mr. Hagerty, many of them,.
 came immediately to our public information office to obtain further
 information. We ourselves thought it was better to take the agreed-
 upon answers to the questions, to write them into a statement, and
 give it to them all at once, rather than engage in a general free= for-all
 on this subject. I would like to emphasize that the text of that state-
 ment as issued was not cleared with CIA or anyone else, although
 the information in it, the answers to the questions that are contained
 within it, were cleared with CIA, and I am told by them with State.
 The CHAIRMAN. You discussed all of the substantive facts and state-
 ments in that with representatives of the CIA?
 Mr. DRYDEN. This is correct.  It was not intended to give out a
 statement. We were confronted with a large group of reporters who
 wanted the facts.  We could either engage in a general free-for-all
 discussion-we thought it preferable to take these facts, put them in
 a piece of paper and give it to all of them at once.
 The CHAIRMAN. After consulting with CIA, you prepared this state
 ment, and they knew what the statement was?
 Mr. DRYDEN. I tried to say before that the statement itself or the-
 facts that were collected in a statement was not cleared with anyone.
 The CHAIRMAN. With anyone?
 Mr. DRYDEN. With anyone but ourselves.  The substance of it had
 been cleared. The fact that it was written down in a statement on a
 piece of paper was not cleared with anyone. .
 The CHAIRMAN. Before you issued this to the press, did you have
 anyone from the Department of State look at it and approve it?

 1          EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUM IIT CONFERENCE
 Mr. DRYDEN. We had no contact with the Department of State.
 Our direct contacts were solely with the CIA.
 The CIILIRMAN. Has no one ever advised you that the Department
 of State should be consulted when statements affecting our foreign
 policy are made?
 Mr. DRYDEN. I was told that these statements had been cleared by
 CIA with State. I did not independently check that fact.
 The CIi,116.rAN. Who told you that?
 Mr. DRYDEN. The CIA people with whom we were dealing, sir.
 The CHAIRMAN. What was the reason for saying in your statement
 that these planes were being used in Japaan and Turkey and California.
 Why were you so specific about Japan and California?
 Air. DRYDEN.  We were asked by thv press, "flow many TJ-2 planes
 does NASA have in its weather program?  Where are they operat-
 ing?"  Now, much of this had been published in these documents to
 which I referred which had been publicly released. To take a specific
 one, one released just a few months ago in June 1959, this has
 been released generally, you will find in this that these operations
 The CHAIRMAN.  I don't wish you to read that memorandum.  I
 only want to know your thinking.  You issued this without checking
 it with the State Department.  Why did you state that they were
 operating out of Turkey?
 Mr. DRYDEN. This publ ished report
 The CHAIRMAN. You had already published it?
 Mr. DRYDEN (continuing). Had said, "These flights were made from
 bases at Watertown Strip, Nevada."
 The CHAIRMAN. I know, but those were weather flights.
 [Deleted.]
 dir. DItYDE.. We had mentioned Adana, Turkey, and Atsugi, Japan,
 in this free and open publication.
 The CHAIRMAN. Senator Mansfield!
 Senator 'ANSFIELD. Dr. Dryden, have all our U -2's been recalled
 since the President's order of Thursday, a week ago, that there would
 be no further overflights of the Soviet Vnion ?
 Mr. DRYDEN. Not to my knowledge, sir.  I believe at the present
 time the airplanes are grounded. But I think this is a question again
 that the operating people will have to answer.
 Senator  1iANSru ' u . Do you recall the incident which occurred in
 Japan some months ago when a LT-2, I assume, landed at Atsugi and
 GIs landed from a helicopter and ordered the Japanese civilians in
 the area to leave?
 Mr. Ducar:,. I renu'niber the newspaper accounts of it.  I have no
 personal knowledge of the incident.

 We made arrangements to put instruments in U-2 airplanes. There
 comes back to us flight plans of weather flights, and our instrumenta-
 tion and the data from those instruments, and I do not have in ad-
 vance knowledge even of the weather flight operations
 Senator MANSFIELD. I am referring to a story which appeared in
 Time magazine 2 or 3 weeks ago. I was seeking collaboration of that
 story. But you have no personal knowledge whether it was true or
 false?
 Mr. DRYDEN. I have no personal knowledge of it, sir.
 Senator MANSFIELD. Your responsibility in these U-2 flights is
 primarily observation and calculation concerning weather conditions?
 Mr. DRYDEN. That is correct, and in those flights made with U-2's
 with our instruments, for our purposes.
 Senator MANSFIELD. What is Dr. Glennan's position?  You are
 the Administrator of NASA.
 Mr. DRYDEN. I am the Deputy Administrator.  I appear because
 I was here in 1956 through this program, from the beginning.
 Senator MANSFIELD. Dr. Glennan is the Administrator?
 Mr. DRYDEN. He is the Administrator.
 Senator MANSFIELD. And Dr. Glennan supposedly reports directly
 to the President?
 Mr. DRYDEN. To the President, yes, sir.
 Senator MANSFIELD. Does he or does he not report directly to Dr.
 Kistiakowsky ?
 Mr. DRYDEN. The President on the average sees him two or three
 times a month.
 Senator MANSFIELD. Where does Dr. Kistiakowsky
 Mr. DRYDEN. He is a member of the White House staff.
 Senator MANSFIELD. I know that he is the President's scientific
 adviser.
 Mr. DRYDEN. He is not in the line of command.
 Senator MANSFIELD. The chain of command is directly from Dr.
 Glennan to the President?
 Mr. DRYDEN. Yes, Sir.
 Senator MANSFIELD. That is all.
 The CIrAIRMAN. Senator Wiley?
 Senator WILES. What was the date of that cover statement?
 Mr. DRYDEN. The Turkish story was put out by the local commander
 in Istanbul an Tuesday, May 3. The statement which we issued re-
 cording the agreed-upon answers to questions was on Thursday, May
 5. If I might just continue this, on Friday, May 6, a NASA U-2 air-
 plane was flown at Edwards Air Force Base, exhibited to the press,
 they saw the instruments that were used.  They took movies of the
 airplane.  On Saturday, May 7, Mr.. Khrushchev reported that he,
 had the pilot. At 6 p.m. State issued a statement admitting the recon-
 naissance flight.
 At 6:30 NASA directed all further inquiries to the State Depart-
 ment.

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 Senator WII EY. Let's get back to my question. What was the date
 of the cover statement that the chairman has been talking about?
 Mr. DRYDEN. The 5th, as I understand it, sir.
 [Deleted.]
 Senator WILEY.N NASA is primarily engaged in seeking weather
 information.
 Mr. DRYDEN. We have no intelligence activities either in the de-
 velopment of devices, methods, instruments or operations.
 Senator WILEY. My understanding is that this cover statement was
 the result of previous interrogation by the press.
 Mr. DRYDEN. That is correct.
 Senator  YWILEY. M, hen you issued it., you did not consult with Cen-
 tral Intelligence?
 Mr. DRYDEx. Not on the statement itself but all of the questions
 had been taken up with them. We had no source of information. We
 asked how shall we reply to the name of the pilot, to the flight plan
 of the airplane, and the answers as given us are incorporated in the
 statement, although the exact text was not read back to CIA.
 Senator WILEY. You referred to some publicity that was issued, I
 think you said, in 1959.
 Mr. DIRYDEN. Well, the first press release on our U-2 project was
 released on May 7,1956.
 Senator WILEY. You Held up a blue docket referring to 1959.
 Mr. DRYDEN. Yes, this is some of the results.
 Senator WILEY. Has that been made public?
 Mr. DRYDEN. Yes.
 Senator WILEY. Oil what pages is the part you referred to, because
 I want it in the record.  I want to try to get this story simple and
 clear.
 Mr. DRYDEN. On page 3 of this NASA memorandum which car-
 ries a number, 4-17-59?, the flights were inade from bases at Water-
 town Trip, Nev., Lakenheath, England, Wiesbaden, Germany, Adana,
 Turkey and at Atsugi, Japan.  Two additional flights were made
 from a base in Alaska and these data have, been combined with those
 from Japan in the statistical treatment.
 Senator Wii.EY. Yes.  You agree that that has been public in-
 formation now for some time?
 Mr. DRYDEN. Yes.
 Senator WILEY. Since 1959?
 Mr. DRYDEN. And even earlier, I think in 1957-57, one of them
 -deals with the western part of the United States only, and I believe
 that 1959 is the one which gives the list., yes, sir.

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFEREN
 REASON FOR NASA STATEMENT
 Senator. GORE. In response to a question by me, Secretary Dillon
 testified as follows :
 No, it was decided when we first heard of this, this news, as I said earlier this
 morning, at this National Security Council meeting or right after it that was
 held outside of Washington, that the State Department would handle the pub-
 licity on this, and that we would make any statement that would be made, and
 it was known at that time that we would make a statement.
 That leads me to wonder why NASA was making a statement at
 ,all.
 Mr. DRYDEN. This information, this decision of which you speak
 was not transmitted to us.  I would like to remind you that this is
 all within a few hours.     The information we had was a statement
 made at the White House which I read to you that the reporters were
 referred to NASA and the State Department for the facts and this was
 the extent of my knowledge when the statement was issued.
 NASA UNAWARE OF DECISION TO LET STATE DEPARTMENT
 IIANDLE PUBLICITY
 Senator GORE. Then you did not know that a high level decision
 had been made that the State Department would make whatever
 statement was made with respect to this.
 Mr. DRYDEN. That is correct. Within the 3 hours or so of this inter-
 val, this was not passed to us, and I would again say that so far as
 we were concerned the cover story was in effect as the result of the
 collaboration with CIA for the period -from May 1 to May 7, and we
 did nothing, we said nothing contrary to the agreed on facts relating
 to the cover story.
 Senator GORE. When did you first learn of this high level decision
 that the State Department would make whatever statement was made
 and would handle the publicity on this matter?
 Mr. DRYDEN. I think that after the statement was issued, there were
 ,some calls as to-I do not know how to place the time.  The only
 thing I have been able to find in our records is an instruction to our
 people as of Saturday to refer all inquiries to the State Department.
 I believe that before that time, there had been some discussions of
 why the statement had been issued by us, and I have explained the
 -reasons for that.
 Senator GORE. I will get to that in a moment. When did you first
 know that the decision had been made, to which Mr. Dillon referred,
 that the State Department would make statements and would handle
 the publicity on this matter?  You say you were not informed that
 the decision had been made at the time you made your statement.
 Mr. DRYDEN. It was subsequent to the day of May 5, May 6, or
 May 7. I have a record of May 7. After the State Department's
 ,statement at 6 p.m., that. NASA would refer all inquiries to the State
 Department, I believe we were informed, probably on Friday the 6th,
 but I have no specific record.
 Senator GORE. Who informed you?
 Mr. DRYDEN. I think it was a telephone call. I just do not have
 :a specific recollection whether it came as a telephone call or a contact
 with Dr. Glennan at lunch at the White House. I just do not recall,
 sir.

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CO2KFERE;4CE
 We can perhaps clear that up for the record after consultation, sir.
 Senator GoEE. I think it would be well if you can do so.
 (The following information was subsequently furnished:)
 STATEMENT BY Da. DityrES ox Wiias :NASA WAS NOTIFIED OF DECISION TO HAVE
 DsI'ARTMENT OF STATE HANDLE PUBLICITY ON U-2
 The telephone logs of Dr. Glennan and myself show no calls to or from the
 State Delhartwrnt on May & or 7, but It is my best recollection that we did learn
 of the decision on May &.
 You have referred several times to questions and answers, or the
 answers to questions as the case may he, supplied to you by CIA. Do
 you have a copy of that question and answer series?
 Mr. DRYDEN. We may have some rough notation. What we did
 was record the types of questions that the press was asking us.  We
 then took these types of questions to the CIA and discussed them with
 them as to the answers.
 [Deleted.]
 Senator GORE. Was there not a typewritten copy ?
 Mr. Dare Ex. To the best of my knowledge, no.
 Senator Gom.E. But you do have some notes.
 Mr. IlitrlJEx. The statement itself enables you to reconstruct the
 questions. They are generally who was the picot, what was the flight
 plan, where was the airplane supposed to go, what was the route, how
 many airplanes does NASA operate on weather missions, from what
 bases have these airplanes been ope rat ing ? I think you can reconstruct
 the questions fror.i the statement itself.  I am not sure whether we
 can find the note, that someone may have written down to refresh his
 memory in discussing it.
 Senator Gem:. Who instructed your Agency to make a statement?
 Mr. Dnyio:l. We were instructed to answer questions.
 Senator GoinE. By whom?
 Mr. DityDEN. By the CIA, who said that this had been coordinated
 with the State Department,
 Senator Goiir. And the CIA gave you instructions to respond to
 question,;?
 Mr. DRYDEx. We asked for information. The operation was not
 ours. We had no knowledge of the operation itself. We said, "How
 shall we reply to these questions?  l ou realize the fact that we did
 not know very iuuch about where this airplane was, whether the
 Russians have lime airplane, whether they have the pilot.  What do
 you want us to say in this interim period?  Can we find out more
 about it ?"
 Senator GORE. You felt the burden of saying something, did you?
 Mr. Ihuynns. We felt the burden of answering questions because
 for 4 wears the existence of this NASA weather flight program had
 been known.

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE
 WHEN WERE COUNTERMANDING INSTRUCTIONS RECEIVED?
 Senator GORE. And, meanwhile, no one informed you that the
 decision had been made at the highest levels. of Government that the
 State Department would handle this?
 Mr. DRYDEN. The discussions I referred to, the visits of the press,
 were made within an hour or two of the making of that decision at a
 place outside of Washington, and it was not communicated to us
 within that 2-hour period.
 Senator GORE. You have told us it wasn't communicated to you at
 all.
 Mr. DRYDEN. Until the following day.
 Senator GORE. Until after you had made a statement?
 Mr. DRYDEN. A statement.  To get the chronology again, this meet-
 ing to which you refer, at which the decision was made, was on the
 morning of May 5, somewhere between 11 and 12 o'clock.  A decision
 was made and Mr. Hagerty informed the press at the direction of
 the President that the facts would be obtained through NASA and
 State.  The reporters came immediately over to our public informa-
 tion section wanting to know some of these facts.
 Senator GORE. Do you know whether either Mr. Hagerty or Presi-
 dent Eisenhower had been informed of this decision reached outside
 Washington?
 Mr. DRYDEN. I think the President was outside Washington at the
 time.
 Senator GORE. It seems to me that I recall the President participated
 in this conference.
 Mr. DRYDEN. I just do not know the details of that.  I think it was
 given in the testimony of the Secretary of State.
 Senator GORE. Wasn't that a meeting of the National Security
 Council?
 Mr. DRYDEN. I do not know that, to my knowledge.     The statement
 was made that Mr. Eisenhower was at secret Civil Defense IIead-
 quarters.
 Senator GORE. Will you repeat that ?
 Mr. DRYDEN. I say the statement says that President Eisenhower
 was at his secret Civil Defense Headquarters.
 REFERENCE TO MR. DILLON'S TESTIMONY REGARDING NASA 'S ROLE
 Senator GORE. I will read from Mr. Dillon's statement :
 Now, Mr. Hagerty was not at the Security Council meeting, but he was at
 that area out there where this exercise was taking place and so he was aware
 of the fact that the State Department would be making a statement at noon
 that day at our regular press conference time.  Actually, the statement was
 delayed 45 minutes.  It was made at 12:45 when our regular daily press con-
 ference took place.
 Senator Goan. Was it decided there that NASA would make a statement also?
 Mr. DILLON. It was not, to my knowledge, no.  It was not decided there
 that NASA would make a statement.
 Senator GonE. Who made that decision?
 Mr. DILON. I think that you have to ask NASA.  I don't know who made any
 such decision.
 So you say you decided upon instructions of CIA?
 Mr. DRYDEN. No.

 Senator GoitE. Just how do you state it?
 Mr. DitrDEx. I stated that we had received word of the White
 House announcement that the facts will be made public by NASA
 and the Department of State.  Now, this means I suppose that within
 this 2- or 3-hour period this information was not transmitted to us-
 I do not know the reasons.
 Senator Gorm. Do you know if air. Hagerty called you or 3Ir.
 Bonney or anyone in the Department suggesting that a statement ba
 made?

 NASA ACTION BASED ON I7tEVIOL   UNDERSTANDING WITh  CIA.
 Senator IIIcKExworrtt. Dr. Dryden, when the newsmen came to.
 the Information Department of N .SA, did the Information Depart-
 ment act on its own?
 Mr. Din-DEN. No, they did not.  They acted in consultation.
 Senator I IICKENLOOPER. 11"ith you?
 Air. DitYDEN. With me; yes, sir.
 Senator IIICIiENLOOPE . Was it in connection with that consulta-
 tion, based upon the information which you then had about Mr. IIag-
 erty's statement, that you authorized the issuance of the statement by
 the Information Service of NASA?
 Mr. DRYDEN. It was called a memorandum to the press.  I did not
 attribute sufficient importance to the distinction between answering
 questions of reporters and giving them the same information on a
 piece of papPer.
 Senator IIICKE::LOOFFdt. After you had made the statement., or your
 Information Department issued this statement, was this statement
 sent to the CIA or the State Department?
 Mr. DitYDEN. it. was sent-I do not know exactly what time.
 Senator Iiict ENLoorEn. And was the statement which was issued
 by your Information Department-perhaps you have answered this-
 question-cleared with CIA in its context or with the State Depart-
 ment prior to the issuance by your Information Service?
 Mr. DRYDEX. I have answered that. The statement, as written,.
 was not cleared.
 The information in the statement had been previously cleared by
 CIA, with State.
 Senator IIleitrxl.oorrn. So that the statement was based, then,.
 upon the understandings which had previously been had?
 Mr. Dnr23:N. This is correct.
 Senator IIICI,;ENI.oornn. With CIA?
 Mr. DltYDEN. This is correct.
 Senator IIICKENLOOrEIt.And with the State Department?
 Afr. Din-nEN. Nothing---no substantive information was added to it.
 Senator ITIc .exLOorER. Just to get this cleared up a little bit, after
 you learned of the statement of Mr. Ilaterty-w{hich I believe was
 the source of your determination to make the 3fay 5 statement-after
 you had learned of that statement of Mr. Hagerty that NASA and
 the State Department could give information on this matter, did you

 get in touch with the White Mouse, Mr. Hagerty, or any authorita-
 tive person there, or with the State Department?
 -Mr. DRYDEN. I did not.  I say I perhaps erroneously did not see
 the difference between answering questions of a large number of
 reporters and putting the same thing down on a piece of paper.  It
 is the same information.
 Senator IIIcKENLOorrru.. I believe that is all., Mr. Chairman.

 statement.
 Mr. DRYDEN. The committee has it already.
 Senator IIICKENLOOPER. I understand it is in the background docu-

 The CHAIRMAN. It is in the background documents.
 (See appendix 1, p. 180.)
 NO WRITTEN MEMORANDUM Or QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Senator GORE. Also, I believe you were going to supply to the chair-
 man the question and answer series.
 Mr. DRYDEN. I was going to see if there is around, a penciled
 memorandum of the questions. lam not sure that there is.
 Senator GoRE. If there is?
 Mr. DRYDEN. If there is, I will supply it to the chairman.
 (The following information was subsequently furnished :)
 No memorandum of questions and answers was made ; the discussion was
 entirely oral.
 NASA'S LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF U-2 FLIGHT
 The CHAIRMAN. Senator Lausche, the NASA statement is found on
 page 4 of the background documents.

 Senator LAUSCHE. At the time you issued your statement you did
 not have knowledge of what the Soviet knew about it and what actu-

 Mr. DRYDEN. We did not.
 Senator LAUSCHE. Did you have knowledge of the instructions that
 were given to the pilot?
 Mr. DRYDEN. No, sir. No knowledge about the operations.
 Senator LAUSCHE. And that is-
 Mr. DRYDEN. We heard Khrushchev's press announcement, of
 course, that morning.
 Senator LAUSCHE. I think that is all that I have with this witness.

 From time to time, the  irector of the CIS, after obtaining the
 concurrence of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of ?t.ate,
 recommended a. series of programs to the- President.
 More specifically, I reviewed program proposals embracing sev-
 eral priority missions, one or more of which it was proposed to
 execute in the near future. Re, onsihilit.y for the operational con-
 duct. of the program rested with the CIA.
 We obviously were interested in the results of these flights as we
 are in all of our Nation's intelligence collection results.
 For example, from these flights we hot information on airfields,
 aircraft, missiles, missile testing and training, special weapons stor-
 age, submarine production, atomic production and aircraft deploy-
 ments, and things like these.
 These were all types of vital information, These results were con-
 sidered in formulating our military prograns.  We obviously were
 the prime customer, and ours is the major interest..
 Secondly, on a separate subject :
 One incident, and one over which I assume. frill responsibility, is
 the calling of a test of the readiness of our military communications
 from Paris. In vies of the fact that guy action in this mutter has
 been subject to some speculation, I would like to give you the facts.
 First of all, our military forces are always on some degree of alert..
 So it is merely a matter of moving this degree or condition of alert
 up or down the scale. On Sunday night, May 1:i, we were already
 aware of the sense of the statetnent which Mr. Kit rusheliev was going
 to make the following morning.  The conditions which lie had set
 for his participation in the conference made. it. apparent even at the
 time that he deliberately intended to wreck the conference.
 This communications alert was not an act. that was either offensive
 or defensive in character.  It was a sound precautionary measure.
 It did not recall Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine personnel from
 leave. There was no movement. of forces involved. However, I want
 to emphasize that it did make certain that, if subsequent developments
 made necessary a higher state of readiness, such action could be taken
 promptly and 'convincingly.
 Under the circumstances it seemed most prudent. to me to increase
 the awareness of our unified commanders. M'foreover, since the com-
 mand and individuals concerned in the decision process, including
 the President, the Secretary of State, and myself, were overseas, it
 was important to check out our military communications.  At about
 midnight, Paris time, Sunday night, I requested that a quiet increase
 in command readiness, particularly with respect to communications,
 be instituted without public notice, if possible.

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE       125
 One phase of our testing is to call no-notice exercises of our com-
 mand communications.  While some commands went further in exe-
 cuting the instructions issued by the JCS as a result of my message
 than I had anticipated, I consider the order proper and absolutely
 essential.  In similar circumstances I would take exactly the same
 action.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
 Mr. Secretary, did you or any of your aides participate in any con-
 ference prior to May 1 regarding the U-2 flights?
 Secretary GATES. Yes, Mr. d airman.  I was some weeks before
 May 1 briefed on the preliminary results of the April 9 flight.  At
 that time, I was informed of a program of possible flights, one of
 which would be selected to be flown, and I gave my approval of that
 program.
 The CHAIRMAN. Was anything said at that time about a moratorium
 in view of the summit conference ?
 Secretary GATES. No, sir.
 The CHAIRMAN. Who participated in that conference?
 Secretary GATES. That conference was in my aflice in the Pentagon,
 and was between myself and a man from CIA.
 The CHAIRMAN. Was anyone in the State Department present?
 Secretary GATES. No, sir.
 The CHAIRMAN. Do you know whether the State Department was
 advised specifically of the plans for the May 1 flight?
 Secretary GATES. I don't know from my own knowledge, but I am
 perfectly certain that the Secretary of State was advised of the pro-
 gram as I was.
 The CHAIRMAN.  You didn't advise him nor was he represented at
 that meeting?
 Secretary GATES. No, sir.
 The CHAIRMAN. And no one raised the question of whether or not
 there should be a suspension?
 Secretary GATES. No, sir.  In this conversation, it was a private
 conversation between the CIA representative and myself, and I was
 asked for my advice or approval of the program and I gave it.
 The CHAIRMAN. I understand that, but I merely meant that the
 question of whether or not there should be a suspension in view of the
 upcoming summit was not raised; is that correct?
 Secretary GATES. Not raised between the two of us, no, sir.
 The CHAIRMAN. Was it raised at any time?
 Secretary GATES. I didn't have any other discussions about the
 flight with anyone, Senator Fulbright.
 The CHAIRMAN. Then so far as you know, it was not raised?
 Secretary GATES. Yes, Sir.
 QUESTION OF ANY PRIOR SUSPENSION OF FLIGHTS
 The CHAIRMAN. To your knowledge, were any flights prior thereto
 ever suspended because of political meetings, that is, other than
 weather or military considerations?
 Secretary GATES. I have no knowledge of any suspension of any
 flights for those purposes.

 The Cu.AmarAN. There was no suspension to your knowledge when
 the Camp David meeting took place?

 The CIIAIR?rAN. Nor was there any suspension, so far as you know,
 during the period in which Klurtishelev visited the United States?
 Secretary GATES. I don't know of any suspension.  I don't know
 precisely whether during that. period we flew any flights, Mr. Chair-

 affirmatively.
 SIGNIFICANCE TO DEFENSE DEPARTMENT OF SUSPENSION- OF FLIGHTS
 The CII_Ai1 r.x  . Were the results of these flights important to the
 Defelrse. Department?
 Secretary GaTrs. The results were very important to the Defense
 Department.
 The CIIAIRNIAN. Very useful to you?
 Secretary GATES. "1 es, sir.
 The CHAIRMAN. Do you regard it as an important loss that the
 flights have now been suspended ?
 Secretary GGATFS. I think that., through becoming compromised, we
 have lost, an important. source of intelligence.  It has been a very
 successful program over the past.
 The CIIAii1r. x. Then it is it, great loss from your point of view not
 to have available any f urther flights: is that 'o erect
 Secretary GATFR. I think if we had been able to continue them with-

 would have been most, useful.

 I believe he told the truth.

 INITIAL. STATEMENT BY AIR FORCE IN TUIMEY
 The CIIAraMAN. How did it happen the Air Force made the initial

 about a plane being missing.
 The CIIAra MAN. Well does that indicate that you had arrived ahead
 of time in concert with the CIA upon proper procedure to be followed
 in case of a mishap?
 Secretary GATES. I was not familiar with the details of how a cover
 story would be executed.  I was aware of the fact that a cover story
 existed, and I imagine that when the details of it were put into

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 Senator GORE. Was the cover story discussed there?
 Secretary GATES. No [deleted], Senator.
 There was a meeting of the small group after the NSC meeting
 Senator GORE. Did you participate?
 Secretary GATES. Where we discussed the Khrushchev statement. I
 participated with the President.  It was not at the NSC meeting.
 Senator GORE. At this conference in which Mr. Khrushchev's speech
 was discussed, was the cover story discussed?
 STATE DEPARTMENT TO HANDLE RELEASES ON SUBJECT
 Secretary GATES. Well, I think it was discussed in a general manner
 but not in detail.  It was decided at that meeting that the responsi-
 bility for all releases pertaining to this matter would be handled by
 the Department of State.
 Senator GORE. Was there any discussion at this meeting of the
 advisability of telling the truth?
 Secretary GATES. I think I made a statement in that meeting, some-
 thing to the effect that the prestige of the Presidency should not be
 involved in an international lie particularly when it would not stand
 up with respect to the facts.  But that was the extent of the discussion.
 There was no decision.
 STATE DEPARTMENT'S COVER STORY
 Senator GORE. After this observation on your part, the State
 Department did issue a statement that was not true; is that the case?
 Secretary GATES. I think
 Senator GORE. Well, the record shows
 Secretary GATES. I think they issued a statement, that is right.  I
 think they issued a part of the cover story statement after that meet-
 ing; yes, sir.
 Senator GORE. So there was no decision-although the question of
 involvement of the Presidency in what you call an international lie
 was discussed, and you expressed your view that it would be an unwise
 thing to involve the President in the cover story or in an interna-
 tional an official falsehood?
 Secretary GATES. If it turned out that Mr. Khrushchev had all the
 facts, which we subsequently found out that he had; yes.
 Senator GORE. How did you think his involvement or his association
 with this incident in its ramifications could be avoided by an assump-
 tion of responsibility by the President for the program?
 Secretary GATES. I believe the President did assume responsibility,
 and I believe he should have assumed responsibility.
 Senator GORE. Let me see if I understand you correctly.  I cer-
 tainly do not wish to make any implication at all.  I do not wish to
 impute to you any meaning which you did not intend.  Did I correctly
 understand you to say that this question was discussed at a small
 meeting following the NSC meeting on the 5th at which you partici-
 pated as did the President?
 Secretary GATES. That is correct, sir.

 Gray, and 0eneral Goodpaster.
 Senator Goii>f. At. this meeting, you expressed the view that it would
 be unwise for the. President to be involved in an international lie,
 I believe you described it..
 Secretary GAT.-s. That. is right.  This depended on what Mr. Khru-
 shchev knew, when he knew it and if he knew everything that he
 claimed to kiuiw.  It turned out hater lie did.  I believe that the
 President should take the responsibility for the, truth, for telling the
 truth.  That is nay opinion.  T (lid not know specifically at that time
 the extent of Mr. Ishruslwhev s knowledge.
 Senator Goiu.. You lnave aniended your
 Secretary GATES, I didn't mean to be evasive, Senator.
 Senator Gumci:. I understand, but you have now amended, and I
 would like to clarify, if I may.  I know you are not trying to be
 evasive and I assure you that. I anm only seeking to develop the facts
 as they existed.  The Government. has full leeway, so far as I am
 concerned, to exercise censorship for security.
 Now, when you expressed (lie view that the Presidency should not
 be involved in an international lie, did you fat. that tinie, on the 5th,
 suggest the. President should assume reslionsibilit y, or was this on the
 7th or the, 9th that you expressed that- additional view?
 Secretary GATES. It was on the----I had no more meetings on the
 subject until the 9th, Senator. That meeting was with the Secretary
 of State..
 Senator GORE. Did you express the view on the 5th that the Presi-
 dent. should assume responsibility or did you express that view on
 the 9th?
 Secretary GATES. I expressed the view on the 5th that if air. Nhru-
 shchev had the complete information and the pilot, that the President
 should assert the true story.
 I expressed it again on the 9th when we knew that he had the plane
 and tale pilot. [Deleted.]
 Senator GoiRE. You were informed that Mr. Mirushchev had made
 the public speech with respect to the plane, that it was shot down or
 that it cane dowii in the vicinity of Sverdlovsk?

 knew some information on the 5th, but we knew a great deal more a
 day later.  He didn't report time full story until the 7th.
 Senator GORE. I understand.  I am only trying to develop the back-

 was reached at that meeting was that all the statements pertaining to
 the incident would be handled by the Department of State.
 Senator GORE. What information was the State Department to give?
 Was it specifically understood at the meeting that the cover story
 would be continued?
 Secretary GATES. Yes; I think it was assumed that the cover story
 would be continued at that time.
 Senator GORE. And the cover story was untrue?
 Secretary GATES. Yes, sir.  It turned out to be untrue.  I mean,
 yes, because it was untrue. We didn't have the full facts that we
 had 2 days later.

 Senator WILEY. Mr. Secretary, I have listened to this interroga-

 starting in when you first became acquainted with the facts, who was
 there, what was said, and then go on.
 For instance, we have heard so many statements about something
 not being true.  Now this release on May 5 was the cover story,
 wasn't it?
 Secretary GATES. Yes, sir.
 Senator WILEY. When did you first get acquainted with the situa-
 tion ?  Start in the beginning and give it consecutively so that it
 will be clear.
 Secretary GATES. I first got involved in the situation when the
 airplane did not return to base.  I knew an airplane was down, pre-
 sumably because it hadn't come back and it had taken off.  That
 was on May 1.
 I had no other relationship with it until the morning of Thursday,
 which was May 5 when we had a [deleted] meeting of the NSC at
 a remote location under a civil defense exercise.
 On that morning, there was the preliminary statements of Mr.
 Khrushchev that we had been flying over his territory, and so forth.
 After the NSC meeting, there was a small meeting at which I have
 listed the members present, in which we discussed this matter.
 Senator WILEY. Who was there?
 Secretary GATES. Mr. Dillon of the State Department, Mr. Allen
 Dulles, Mr. Gordon Gray, General Goodpaster, and myself and the
 President.  We discussed this whole matter.  We made the decision
 there that the matter would be handled by the Department of State,
 and we adjourned.
 I had no further participation or discussion concerning the incident
 until the following Monday morning.

 Senator 'WZLEY. On May 9, if you will turn to page 5, you have
 the Department of State's release.
 Senator WILEr. Was there one issued on May 9 ?
 Secretary GATES. Yes, sir.
 Senator WILEY. At any of these meeting, was the President there?
 Secretary GATES. The only meeting the President attended was the
 meeting of Mary 5th after the NSC meeting
 Senator '4 ILEr. f didn't understand.  Was he there on the 5th ?
 Secretary GATES. Yes, sir; after the NSC meeting.  That is the only
 meeting at which he was present.
 Senator Wu.EY. When it was decided to have the alert, was that the
 judgment of all that it was in the interest of the national defense?
 Secretary GATES. It was my judgment and I was responsible.
 Senator Wn.EY. You had in mind, did you, what the condition of
 this country was at the time of Pearl Harbor, how we were asleep?
 Secretary_ GATES. I certainly did.
 Senator  n.Ey. During negotiations.
 Secretary GATES. I did, indeed.
 Senator Wir_.r:v. Is it your judgment from the facts that when
 Khrushchev went to Paris that he had already made up his mind to
 call off the summit, meeting,?
 Secretary GATES. Yes; it is my judgment, Senator.
 MEETING ON NAY 5
 Senator WILEY. Something was said by Yourself in the cross-exami-
 nation to the effect that you claimed they should tell the truth. When
 was that, on the 5th?
 Secretary GATES. I said on the 5th, if it proved that Mr. Khrushchev
 had the pilot, had the equipment, had the full and complete story, it
 later turned out that he had, that I believed we should tell the truth
 at that time.

 Senator MANSFIELD. Mr. Secretary, since you have become Secre-
 tary of Defense, you have made it a point to sit in on the meetings
 of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and if an agreement could not be reached
 you make the final decision.
 Secretary GATES. Yes, sir.
 Senator MANSFIELD. In that period you have also brought about re-
 forms and increased the efficiency of the centralized purchasing
 system.
 Secretary GATES, Yes, sir.
 Senator MANSFIELD. In that period you have also brought about a
 centralization of the communications system.
 Secretary GATES. Yes, sir.
 Senator MANSFIELD. For all those you are to be most highly com-
 mended because I think they were reforms long overdue and it was
 about time they were put into effect.
 REASONS FOR ALERT
 Now, at the time you issued your alert of the communications system
 in Paris did you have any information that Soviet forces were massing
 or mobilizing?
 Secretary GATES. No, sir.
 Senator MANSFIELD. Did any one person or any group ask you to
 order the alert?
 Secretary GATES. No, sir.
 Senator MANSFIELD. You did that entirely on your own respon-
 sibility?
 Secretary GATES. That is correct, Senator.
 Senator MANSFIELD. Did the alert order which you issued put the
 forces of this country at a war readiness level?
 Secretary GATES. No, sir.
 Senator MANSFIELD. There was no call back of Reserves or cancel-
 lation of leave to any extent.
 Secretary GATES. No, Sir.  There were in one or two instances some
 people who interpreted the JCS order as meaning that they would
 have a couple of more aircraft on alert, and in that case, they, on their
 own, recalled, I believe some pilots who were home or off duty to have
 approximately two more airplanes on an alert status.  But this was
 done on their own, testing their own alert procedures under the broad
 order that was issued by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 It was not the intention of this order to move forces in any way.
 Senator MANSFIELD. Now, that JCS order was in response to your
 order?
 Secretary GATES. That is right, Senator.
 Senator MANSFIELD. Is there any connection between this communi-
 cations alert and the recent centralization of the communications
 system?
 Secretary GATES. No, sir, because that will not be in effect in its
 entirety for approximately 9 months.
 RESPONSIBILITY OF TIIE PRESIDENT
 Senator MANSFIELD. Now, during the course of your responses to
 Senator Gore, you mentioned the following words, "The prestige of
 the Presidency should not be involved."

 Isn't it true that in ahuost, any undertaking, in a general way the
 prestige of the Presidency is always involved under our constitutional
 system of government.?
 Secretary GATES. Certainly.
 Senator MANSFIELD. What I am getting at there is this: That
 whether or not. he had any specific knowledge of this particular flight
 or of this particular order, which you issued, that nevertheless under
 our system ho is generally responsible for actions undertaken by the

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE      135
 Secretary GATES. I don't know of any flights over East Germany
 recently, but, of course, they have some 20 divisions in East Germany.
 Senator IIICKENLOOPER. I don't know whether this comes within
 your time or not, but I have heard in one way or another in times
 past that they have repeatedly had large air forces in the air over
 East Germany.
 Secretary GATES. They have large air forces stationed in East Ger-
 many.
 Senator IIICKENLOOPER. I mean in the air.
 Secretary GATES. They have had maneuvers, yes, sir.
 Senator IIICRENLOOPFR. They have had maneuvers toward the West
 German border which come very close to the West German border
 on occasion ?
 Secretary GATES. They have had them regularly; yes, sir.
 Senator IIICKENL oorER. Sometimes these are rather massive maneu-
 vers in the air?
 Secretary GATES. I believe that is correct; yes, sir.
 Senator IIICIKENLOOPER. Well, now, recently we have heard a great
 deal of discussion and argument about keeping all of our strategic
 Air Force planes or a great many of them in the air all the time.
 There have been some that have advocated that and criticized us for
 not keeping our airplanes in the air more than we have.
 Secretary GATES. I am very familiar with this argument, with the
 Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee.
 Senator HICKENLOOrER. I presume you do not see anything un-
 warranted about this air alert which you ordered, but I will ask you
 the question anyway. Do you see any reason for criticism because of
 a demonstration by your Department of a worldwide air alert of our
 forces?
 Secretary GATES. I stated when I got off the airplfne and was
 asked the question by the press on my return, I said it was incredible
 to me that anybody would question it.
 Senator HIclcENLOOPDR. Well, I agree with that statement, but
 there seems to be some criticism nevertheless.
 ADVISABILITY OF OVERFLIGHT BEFORE SUMMIT CONFERENCE A POLITICAL

 Now, on the question of whether or not, that is from your view-
 point, in your Department, the particular U-2 flight should have been
 cancelled on the 30th of April, or the 1st of May, or whenever it
 occurred, isn't that a political question and not a military question?
 Secretary GATES. Yes.
 Senator HICKENLOOrER. That is in view of the so-called summit
 conference?
 Secretary GATES. Yes.
 Senator HIcKKENLoorIR. That becomes exclusively a political ques-
 tion as to whether or not it was advisable at that time from the stand-

 Senator IlrcKENLoorEit.. ~1nd I take it that from the standpoint
 of primary responsibility you have nothing to say about whether it
 would be cancelled or not as a political gesture in view of a political
 conference?
 Secretary GATES. Well, I, of course, knew of the date of the sum-
 mit meeting, and if I had had a strong conviction about it I would
 have said it even though I didn't have the responsibility for the
 decision.  I was in an advisory capacity, but I believed that there
 was really no good time to stop the collection of important informa-
 tion.                        There is always some international conference or something.
 Senator IIrcJisNworEa. What I am trying to get at is whether you
 have any primary responsibility for making political decisions, or is
 your responsibility military decisions?
 Secretary GATES. No, my responsibility is with the Department of
 Defense.
 Senator IIICrcE`I.oorEa. Now, these C-2 flights have been extreme-
 ly valuable in the securing of intelligence, have they not?
 Secretary GATES. They have indeed, Senator.
 Senator IIICxENi ooiErn. They have also been very valuable in secur-
 u                        weather information, have they not?
 Secretary GATES. Yes, sir.  [Deleted.]
 Senator IIICREM oorEn. Do you believe that., in view of the general
 tensions that exist and the rather jingoist. statemments, let's say, that
 have been emanating from the Kremlin from time to time, it was a
 beneficial thing to have this air alert as not only a show of strength
 but as an assurance to our friends and allies over the world that we
 had a readiness capability?
 Secretary' GATES. 1 {10.  It was not an air alert, Senator.
 Senator  IwKFIXI,00PER. Sir?
 Secretary GATES. It was not an air alert.  I think you miss-tech-
 nically, you said air alert.  It was a command readiness and com-
 munications alert.  I agree, however, with what you said that it was
 a good thing to do.
 Senator  IIohsN1 nII'r:r.. I shall adopt your description for my
 question, then, on that point.
 But anyway, it was a show of ability on our part in connection
 with our alertness, general alertness and our ability to put a defensive
 force into the air in a short ti nme?
 Secretary GATES. Yes, and we could go from there to further meas-
 ures if we needed to. but this was primarily a measure of checking
 command and checking rommunicatrons, particularly, as I said in
 my statement, in view of the fact that the persons involved in im-
 portant polio decisions were. out of the country.
 Senator IlIOKENLOOPEIt. Would you agree that it either does have,
 or should have, a certain degree of comforting effect upon not only
 our own country but upon our allies that we do have these capabilities?

 Secretary GATES. I would hope it would, Senator.  It seems to
 me this is our responsibility, to be ready and alert under these
 circumstances at all times, and we always are.
 This was merely a matter of degree. It was a little increase in the
 degree of alertness.  We are in an alert condition at all times.
 As of midnight last night we are having another communications
 exercise, starting at 11 o'clock last night, and it is going for several
 days.
 Senator HICKENLOOPEiR. This fact that we may be always alert some-
 times is not fully appreciated except on occasional demonstrations of
 that.
 Secretary GATES. That is right, and the Joint Chiefs, as a result of
 this experience and critique of it have recommended to me that we
 have these alerts on a no-notice basis more frequently.
 Senator HICKENLOOPER. Thank you.  My time is up.
 The CHAIRMAN. The Senator's time is up.

 QUESTION OF ADVANCE PLANNING FOR ACTION IN EVENT U-2 PLANE
 DOWNED
 Senator LONG. Did you advise or consult as to whether we were to
 admit that we authorized these flights if and when the Soviets did
 succeed in bringing one of our planes down?
 Secretary GATES. If we should continue them or not?
 Senator LONG. No, no.  What I meant is this : As a matter' of fore-
 handedness-I see a naval officer sitting behind you-they taught
 me the definition of that word as a midshipman-I am sure that you
 anticipated that sooner or later they were going to bring one of our
 planes down.
 Secretary GATES. We, knew it was a dangerous occupation; yes,
 Senator.
 Senator LONG. You could anticipate that sooner or later one of
 these planes was going to fall into enemy hands?
 Secretary GATES. Yes, sir.
 Senator LONG. There was a distinct possibility at any moment,
 and had you advised and consulted as to how this matter should be
 handled if and when such an event materialized?
 Secretary GATES. No; I had not, Senator.  I was only aware of
 the fact that a cover story existed, but I had no part in it.
 Senator LONG. And you had not been advised as to what the position
 of this country was going to be in the event that that happened?
 Secretary GATES. No, Sir, this was not my responsibility.
 Senator LONG. Senator Young passed up two questions he would
 like for me to ask.  I will just ask them on my time since I have no

 yourself, but on your own responsibility.
 Senator Loxc. If it were essential or important that the U-2 flights
 be made for years, right up to and including May 1, is the defense of
 the United States adversely effected by an asolute discontinuance on
 May 13?
 Secretary GATES. We have lost, through compromise, an important
 source of information. [Deleted.]
 Senator LONG. In other words, we do badly need the same informa-
 tion that we were gathering with the U   fights?
 Secretary GATES. We need a continuity of this information, I think,
 Senator.
 Senator Lose. Then if that be the case, in your judgmlent was it
 essential or advisable that the flight of May I should not have been
 canceled?
 Secretary GATES. III my judgment, it was proper to fly the flight
 of May 1.
 Senator LoNo. Thank you. I have no further questions.
 The CIIAinltax, Is that all ?
 The Senator from Verniont?
 Senator Aiiu-; ;. Mr. Secretary, at the trine you ordered the com-

 time the Communists might be considering or planningsurprise action
 in any part of the world?
 Secretary GATrs. No, sir, I felt that the situation was one that was
 at best, not very constructive. We knew the sense of Mr. Khrushchev's
 remarks, but f did not anticipate a surprise attack.
 I didn't order that kind of an alert.
 Senator Ail{E:J:. In other words, it -seemed like a good thing to do
 at the time?

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE  SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 missile to that base.  What is your judgment as to the seriousness of
 that threat?
 Do you think it is a bluff or do you think that he means it?
 Secretary GATES. Well, Senator, this is awfully hard to know.  IIe
 must know that if he did such a thing that we have allied commit-
 ments.                                          If it was an allied country, for example, he would be starting
 a very maj or problem for himself.
 Senator MORSE. That is the point I want to raise.
 Secretary GATES. And this would only be done with the assumption
 that he would take the consequences of an act that would probably
 start it general war.  [Deleted.]
 Senator MORSE. Doesn't it seem to imply, Mr. Secretary, that if he
 is not bluffing, that they thereby mean to start a general war over
 espionage activity on the part of the United States or any other for-
 eign power that sends a spy plane over their territory?
 Doesn't that seem to be--
 Secretary GATES. If I understand your question, Senator, I think
 he must take the responsibility for starting a general war or very
 likely starting a general war if he hits one of our Allied bases for any
 reason.
 Senator MORSE. Could it possibly imply that the Russians are of the
 opinion that our power of both defense and aggression is such that
 they are willing to take it on?  To put my question a different
 it now.  I think they absolutely know they will commit suicide the
 moment they try it because I think they are fully informed in every
 way possible about, practically, the exact defense posture of the
 United States.
 Senator MORSE. If that is true, and I think it is true, that they ought
 to know that if they get involved in a nuclear war there can't be any
 victory for them, and I doubt if there could for us, but apparently
 this type of military mind in Russia possessed by their air marshal is
 ready to start a nuclear war.  Wouldn't that be a fair deduction from
 this threat unless it is a, bluff ?
 Secretary GATES. Senator Morse, I think it is a part of a stepped-
 up, cold war aggressive, propaganda campaign.  That is what I think
 it really is, because I don't believe that Mr. Khrushchev wants to
 start a war which he knows will be the end of his country.
 Senator MORSE. I am inclined to think that is probably true of
 Khrushchev.  But the reason I am asking this line of questions is
 to find out from you if the leaders in our country have reason to
 believe that Khrushchev is being pushed in Russia by a preventive
 war group that entertains the point of view that sooner or later they
 are going to have to fight the United States, and that they think
 probably now is a better time to do it than later.
 Do we have any intelligence information that would justify our
 believing that a military group in Russia is now taking over and
 pushing Khru.shchev to the side?
 Secretary GATES. We do not have.  We can at this time only
 speculate.  It might be possible that the military group has come
 into more power in Russia or that Mr. Khrushchev may have had
 some of his power diluted.  This is, however, just speculation, and

 it is, I suppose, rather dangerous to speculate, but we do not have any
 hard facts on the subject.
 INFLUENCE OF, AND D.I  GER IN, SOVIET MILITARY IIIERARCIIY
 Senator MfoizsE. I understand they have some 250,000 military
 officers army and naval and air.  Could it be possible that within
 the military in Russia. they see the possibility of reaching an agree-
 ment on total disarmament which means that they would be moved
 out of the very favored posit ion in Russian society they now occupy,
 and that we need to be on the alert to the possibility that a great
 inilitar  change is taking place in Russia in the form of a military
 hierarchy taking over control from the Communist leadership?
 Secretary GATES. Well, 1 couldn't agree with you more, sir, that
 we should certainly be on the alert to this possibility and continuously
 so.  I agree that, we must consider this as one of the possibilities.
 Senator Moitss. What. concerns me is that as far as their leadership
 is concerned and as far as I have any reason to believe, based upon
 the briefings we have had from our own American leaders, we are
 dealing with a group of very amoral leaders in Russia.  And when
 you get amoral leaders among the military establisluncnti, such as they
 have, I think we have cause for concern as to whether or not even in
 desperation they might not be willing to start a war. And if this is
 more than propaganda, if this is more than bluff, if this is more than
 what. you suggest might be the case of a new step-up in the cold war
 to try to frighten our allies, then we have to take a long look, it seems
 to ne, as to our responsibility to history in respect to following an
 espionage course that might cause these amoral men in desperation
 to start a war because there is always the hope on our part that we
 may be able to contain them until we can negotiate through the
 United Nations a workable and enforceable total disarmament
 program.
 I have raised this question because I don't think that in terms of
 history we can completely ignore our responsibility in dealing with a
 group of desperadoes such as I think the'
 he Russian military people are,
 and so it raises the question how far we can justify going morally, in
 connection with an espionage system such as the U-t system, when we
 know we are, dealing with a group of amoral military leaders in Russia
 who might. start a nuclear war because of their complete. lack of appre-
 ciation for the value of human life.
 It puts us in a difficult position, it seems to me.  We have our own
 security to protect, we have our duty to gather information, but the
 nature of the "beast" with whom we are dealing-in quotation marks
 I put the word, of course. -nevertheless puts upon us some responsi-
 bility, it seems to nie, to not go too far in our own espionage program
 if by going a certain distance might indirectly put us in a position
 where history might record that. we knew we were dealing with that
 kind of a gang and knowing it we nevertheless followed an espionage
 course of action that they considered so violated their sovereign rights
 that they were willing glen Co take that last step into a nuclear war.

 Secretary GATES. Well, the Senator can speculate more intelligently,
 I am sure, than I can on military people.
 Senator MoRSE. Not at all.
 Secretary GATES. But basically military people are conservative,
 worldwide, and basically they are well informed on military matters,
 and therefore, the military in the Soviet Union should know better
 than the political leaders that they will be lost, and slaughtered and
 devastated in a nuclear war.
 On the other question, it seems tome again as a lay person that our
 survival is at stake.  If he threatens us, I have repeatedly testified in
 Congress, that I didn't think he intended to make any significant
 concessions at any meeting, that wehave not prepared our defense pro-
 gram on that basis, that we had to keep it under continuous review, at
 all times, and with a completely closed country, and our survival
 threatened, if he builds up a capability for a surprise attack, it seems
 to me absolutely vital that we obtain all the information we can from
 every source.
 Senator MORSE. Thank you very much.

 Senator CAPEIIART. I have no questions except I will say I think
 you did the right thing by ordering the alert.

 Senator LAUSCIIE. In what capacity?
 Secretary GATES. I was Under Secretary of the Navy, then Secre-

 Senator LAUSCHE. Based upon your knowledge, when did the Soviet
 hierarchy first know of the fact that there were foreign planes flying
 over the Soviet?
 Secretary GATES. I don't think we can confirm, Senator.  We just
 have to take Mr. Khrushchev's statements at face value.
 I think that it is debatable how much he knew.  I assume be knew
 that there were planes flying.  He said he knew.  He says lie had
 known since he was here in the United States.    But I don't think we
 can definitely confirm this.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. Testimony has been given by some witness

 Secretary GATES. I think we had a responsibility to take every
 means we could.
 Senator LAUSCUE. That is not my question.  My question is, If you
 slid not have the knowledge acquired through the U-2's, could you

 Senator LAUSCIIE. If you didn't have that information, do you feel
 that the security of our country in all probability would have been

 .strength?

 is a very important one.  I think it would have been affecting our

 tor.  I have an opinion, yes, sir, that he had very definitely, because
 the moment he arrived in Paris he presented these conditions to Mr.
 -de Gaulle along with a copy already in French.
 Senator I.AUSCUE. That is-the fact is that he was supposed to go
 to Paris on May 15 ; Sunday?
 Secretary GATES.  Yes; he came on Saturday night, I believe.

 he decided to come there in advance?
 Secretary GATES. That is right.
 Senator t uscin . On Saturday I
 Secretary GATES. That is right.
 Senator Larrcxr;. And early in the morning at 11 o'clock on Sun-
 day, he asked for a conference?
 ecret,i.ry GATES. Attended by de Gaulle.
 Senator tArscljr. Attended by Malinovsky,himself, and de Gaulle?
 Secretary GATES. That is correct.
 Senator'.AUScIIE. At that meeting, he set forth these unacceptable
 demands?
 Secretary G.vrEs. That is right, sir.
 Senator LAUScIIE. Then in the afternoon at 4:30 he asked for a
 conference with Macmillan ?
 Secretary GATES. That incorrect.
 Senator LArsCHE. And he again set forth those four demands?
 Secretary GATES. That is correct.
 Senator t2AUSCIIE. This is merely asking for your opinion.
 Do you believe that in self-respect and maintenance of the Presi-
 dent's position he could conform to the demands made in that ultima-
 tum $
 Secretary GATES. I certainly do not. I certainly believe he could
 not, I guess, would be a better answer.
 Senator LArscilE. I am of the opinion that when Khrushchev left
 Moscow he knew there was not. to be a summit conference.  He pre-
 pared his paper.  He had his mode of operation completely outlined.
 Secretary GATES. I share that point of view, Senator.
 SHOULD U-2 FLIGHTS HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED BEFORF. SUMMIT CONFERENCE?
 Senator LAuSCInE. Now, you have stated that you did not feel that
 we could, in the face of these discussions about a summit conference,
 suspend our activities with respect to the security of the country;
 is that right ?
 Secretary GATES. That is right, sir.
 Senator LArscIIE. If there was to be a temporary suspension of
 these LT-1 flights, when should they have begun? This is speculation.
 I am just trying to search it out. The discussions for a summit confer-
 ence preceded by far the. September visit in the United States, and
 then from September to May 16 practically 9 months elapsed.  Should
 we, last September, have discontinued our LT-2 flights?
 Secretary G.%TEs. Not in my judgment. Senator. I think it would
 have been most incorrect to have suspended them.
 Senator L.%usciIE. Do you believe the Soviet, because of the ar-
 ranged summit conference. discontinued its activities?
 Secretary GATES. I am sure they didn't, although I don't know, but
 I am perfectly sure they didn't.

 QUESTION OF ALTERNATIVES TO MAY 9 STATEMENT OF STATE DEPARTMENT
 The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary, referring just a moment to a pre-
 vious question, on the May the 9th meeting in which the issuance of
 the statement by the Department was considered, were there any alter-
 native statements proposed and considered to the one which was
 issued?
 Secretary GATES. Not in principle, Senator Fulbright.
 The CHAIRMAN. Not in principle?
 Secretary GATES. But there were, of course, various language ver-
 sions considered.
 The CHAIRMAN. Did anyone at that meeting raise the point that
 for the President, the Chief of State, to assume personal responsi-
 bility would be a departure from the historical practice of this
 country?
 Secretary GATES. I think this was understood, Senator, and I be-
 lieve that we felt the circumstances were different from anything
 that had prevailed heretofore.
 The CHAIRMAN. But the point was raised and discussed?
 Secretary GATES. I can't accurately say that it was raised and dis-
 cussed but it was certainly in my mind and I believe it was obvious
 to all of us that it was a departure from precedent.
 The CHAIRMAN. It was a departure from precedent in this coun-
 try.  Do you know of any other country that has followed this
 policy?
 Secretary GATES. No ; I do not.
 The CHAIRMAN. Was anyone concerned that this might have far-
 reaching implications for the future of our intelligence operations?'
 Secretary GATES. Well, we knew that it already had marked the
 end of this particular method of collection of intelligence because of
 its being compromised [deleted].
 The CHAIRMAN. Did I understand you to say that to your knowledge
 there was no time in the last few years, in which you are familiar
 with our activity, that U-2 flights were suspended for political reasons.
 Secretary GATES. Not to my knowledge, Senator; that is correct.
 The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary, were you ever consulted with regard
 to the wisdom of holding a summit conference?
 Secretary GATES. No; I was not, Senator.
 POSSIBILITY OF AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA ON DISARMAMENT AND NUCLEAR
 TESTING
 The CHAIRMAN. Do you personally believe there is any reasonable
 hope for any agreement with the Russians with regard to disarma-
 ment?
 Secretary GATES. I think it is extremely doubtful., Mr. Chairman. I
 think that the Soviets are playing off-and-on-again tactics; some-
 times cool, sometimes cold, sometimes hot.

 I believe that their proposal for disarmament or total disarma-
 inent is completely unrealistic. I find it rather difficult to believe they
 will ever agree to the amt rols and inspections that we will of necessity
 insist upon to make progress on disarmament.
 The CHAIRMAN. Do you believe the same with regard to nuclear
 test bans?
 Secretary GATES. I am not so definite on that, Mr. Chairman, from
 a personal point of view. We seem to have made more progress in the
 negotiations on tests than we have in the other field.  But I again
 worry about. the possibility of having valid control and inspection
 systems for either of these efforts.
 The C ii, iinr, x. I understood you to say, I believe, in answer to a
 question by Senator Morse that you did not believe any significant
 concessions could be expected from the Soviets at the summit Ineeting.
 Secretary G.Arr s. That. is right.  This has been consistent with my
 testimony before the conttnittevs of Congress all of this year.
 The CHAIRMAN. Is it now probable that as a. result of the revelation
 of the efficiency of the IT--2 photography, tote Russians will now change
 the location of many of their strategic bases ?
 Secretary (1vris. This is quite an undertaking.  You don't do the
 construction that is involved in strategic bases easily or quickly, and
 they don't know precisely how much information we have about. them,
 and I would think that they would perhaps take different, means of
 building new bases or of dispersing bases or something of that
 character.  But. I don't believe that it is very practical to assume that
 they would shift major installations because of the character required
 to handle t11e. strategic \A-teapo-a,.
 The Cimiwn.1N. What I meant is, do you feel that. the. information
 you now have may become rapidly obsolete because of their knowing
 you know about. them they will change them, so that you will have a
 great deal of difficulty in keeping up with their location?
 Secretary Gxrrs. We gill have to augment other methods toward
 obtaining this information.

 The CIIAIRI4IAN. May I ask the staff, did you release it?

 and, unless they took any portion of it out, it went to the public.
 The CHAIRMAN. I just was, wondering.
 Secretary GATES. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman, I considered it your
 prerogative. I have no objection one way or the other.
 The CHAIRMAN. It usually follows the same procedure. You make
 the statement and then it goes through the record if the censors wish it.
 Was this statement cleared with the State Department before you
 made it?
 Secretary GATES. Yes, Sir.
 Senator LAUSCHE. Mr. Chairman, may I suggest that we find out
 whether a copy got in the hands of the newspapermen other than
 through normal sources here.
 Mr. MARCY. No, sir, that did not happen, not through the commit-
 tee.  Everything goes through the regular process, through the cen-
 sors, and so on.

 TIMING OF KTIRUSIICIIEV'S DECISION TO WRECK SUMMIT
 The CHAIRMAN. You stated very positively that you believed the
 Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mr. Khrushchev, before he
 came to Paris, had already made up his mind to wreck the summit.
 Can you tell us how and why you arrived at that opinion?
 Secretary GATES. Well, I felt, and again speaking personally, I
 felt that the fact that he arrived on Saturday night and asked for
 these appointments with President de Gaulle and Prime Minister
 Macmillan, and he arrived with a position paper translated in French
 in the case of do Gaulle and given orally by translation in English
 to Macmillan, a position paper that he used almost verbatim as the
 first part of his text the following morning, was pretty good indica,
 tion that he had a preconceived plan at the summit meeting and was
 planning to, in my judgment again, and used the fact that there were
 3,000 newspapermen in Paris and he had a platform to issue all of
 these statements from. Then I believe there were indications in other
 speeches that he made prior to the summit that he was going to adopt
 later on.
 The CHAIRMAN. What in your opinion caused him to arrive at this
 conclusion to wreck the conference ?

 Secretary GATES. Why, I believe that he found that he had been
 unsuccessful in creating any disunity among the allies. That he was
 not going to get any substantive concessions himself, according to his
 terms, on Berlin and other critical issues that he might consider im-
 portant, and that. he wasn't ggoing to get a blanket disarmament check
 without controls, and so forth. And I believe he felt that he was not
 going to make any progress at the summit.
 rPPECT Or TILE U-2 INCIDENT ON Klli.USuc.UEV'S SiThLt[IT ACTIONS
 The CHAIRMAN. Do you believe the U-2 incident contributed to
 that belief?
 Secretary GATES. I, frankly in my judgment it did not, Senator
 Fulbright. I believe it gave him, it contributed to his public case, but
 I don't think it contributed to his position.
 The CILLm LtN. You don't think that was a significant element in
 causing him to arrive at this conclusion?
 Secretary GATES. I really do not; no, Sir. I believe it was a factor
 in his, an important factor in helping him make his case, but I don't
 think it had anything to do with his policy decision.
 The CHAIRMAN. Why do you think he would be better off and what
 reasoning leads you to this conclusion?  Why is he better off having
 followed the course he did, than having gone to the conference and
 having it result in no concessions?
 Secretary GATES. Only lie can answer that, Senator.
 The CHAIRMAN. Why do you think he left in his initial statement
 what is called an "outs' for the President, by saying he thought the
 President didn't know about this?
 Secretary GATES. I don't know what his intentions were, whether
 that was an out or whether that was just a statement that he believed.
 I regally don't know.
 The CHAIr%r. N. If it was an out, it would be inconsistent with his
 determination to wreck the conference, would it not?
 Secretary GATES. Sir?
 The CHAIRMAN. If it was an out as it has been alleged, it would
 be inconsistent with his determination to wreck the conference. He
 wouldn't want to give the President an out, would be?
 Secretary GATES. I never personally considered it was an out. I
 just thought he was using this is part of his speech-I don't consider
 it was an`c out.
 The C1LuurAN. Well, he did say that he thought the President
 didn't know about it, didn't lie, in his initial statement?

 forth and so on.  Now, he was acquainted with that fact from his
 conversations, was he not?

 Secretaryy GATES. I believe he was, sir.
 Senator WILEY. And, in other words, he knew that if he went to the
 ,conference and couldn't get his way, which would be very apparent,
 that wouldn't sit so well with the, people of Russia?
 Secretary GATES. I think that is a good speculation.
 Senator WILEY. So, it seems to be the consensus of those people who,
 claim to know, including yourself, that the U-2 incident would give
 him something to hang on his previous determination and that he
 utilized.  Do you agree to that ?
 Secretary GATES. Yes, I think he used the U-2 as a tool rather than
 as a matter of principle.  I think he decided that there was no
 progress for him at the summit.
 SOVIET KNOWLEDGE OF OVERFLIGHTS
 Senator WILEY. Well, there is just this one other question.  I think
 you have answered it, but see if I can't got it out into the open and get
 it so there won't be any question : Is it your opinion that he had known
 of the U-2 incidents for a long time-I mean the U-2 flights?
 Secretary GATES. I think I believed -him when. he said that he knew
 we were overflying the Soviet Union.  I don't believe he knew their
 capabilities.  But I think he knew that unidentified aircraft were over
 his territory.
 Senator WILEY. That is all, Mr. Chairman.
 The CHAIRMAN. Senator Morse?
 RELATIONSHIP OF U-2 FLIGHTS TO SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 Senator MORSE. Mr. Secretary, I want to pursue a bit further the
 line of questioning that I was conducting when my time was up
 because I think you have got to deal also, with the problem of where we
 go from here, in view of Russian attitudes at the present time.
 We have the air marshal's statement now which has not been coun-
 termanded as far as we know by Khrushchev, that if an American U-2
 plane flies from any base, goes over Russia, they will fire a missile
 against that base.
 Your testimony, I think, justifies my concluding that if they fire at
 that base, that under our commitments under NATO, our obligations
 to defend our allies, we will meet that force, and that that may very
 well start general war.
 As I understand also your testimony, you share my doubt as to
 whether or not the air marshal is bluffing, whether or not this is
 propaganda in the cold war or whether or not this is an announcement
 of a definite decision as to what they are going to do.
 So we have to discuss this hypothetically from this point on.  Let's
 :assume that he means exactly what he said, and because of my fear of
 the type of military mind they have in Russia as contrasted with our
 own, namely, the difference between amoral military leaders and moral
 military leaders, I ain very fearful that the group in control of the
 Russian military at the present time means exactly what it says.
 They will fire a missile at any base from which an American U-2
 plane flies.  Doesn't that put squarely up to us then the question as
 to whether or not we can justify being a party indirectly to the start-

 ing of general war by flying any I'-' planes from any foreign base,
 in view of that announcement by the Russian air marshal?
 Secretary GATES. We have announced t.lutt- the  -2 flights will not
 be resumed.  The. President. has announced this. This is, of course,
 known to them and that was announced prior to this Defense Min-
 ister's statement. that you refer to.
 Senator'4foatsE. That is what I want to clarify for this record be-
 cause most resriertfully, I don't think it is clear in the. record that
 this commit try has made to date.
 The President, a nnou iced at- Paris that. they were suspending tlteni.
 Secretary GaTES. lie made, the. statement, senator, that he couldn't
 commit the next President, but. as far as he was concerned, during his
 administration, the flights were stop )ed.
 Senator Morsi-. Then do you wish to express the viewpoint that at
 the present tinge the ITnited States does not intend to continue any
 U-2 flights over Russia ?
 Secretary G.1Tl:s. I think we. made a commitment not to.
 Senator :dolts}:. There has been a considerable amount of discus-
 sion in these hearings and outside of theme hearings that in view of
 that situation that. confronts us, it is intended to continue LT-2 flights;
 that the President's statement was a statement made in connection
 with the summit conference situation.
 In other words, tha summit. conference situation having blown up,
 it does not follow that. that statement. of the. President now continues
 in effect.
 It is your testimony that. it. is your understanding it does continue
 in effect?
 ti 1TURE OF PRi;SinEXT'S COMMITMENT NOT TO CONTINUE FLTOIITS
 Secretary GATES. I am not a lawyer, Senator, but I think you could
 take the legal  hint of view that the President, had no commitment
 because. of the blowup of the summit. conference, but from a national
 point, of view, prestige and the standpoint of the honorable point of
 view, I think the United States has made a commitment. regardless
 of the technicality of the timing of the decision, so in my judgment
 we have made a. commitment, not to fly U-2 during the administration
 of this President.
 SenatorMoitsr.. I don't care to get. into any argument over seman-
 tics, but. only judging from what I read about the interpretation of
 the President.'s speech to the Nation, there are many news comments
 interpreting the Pre,idrnt's speech to the Nation as a speech that does
 not commit this Nation to a discontinuance of I'-?' flights, now that
 the summit. conference, has blown up.
 I think it. is very important that we make clear our position.  I am
 not. passing judgment now on what our position should be.

 not the President's speech to the Nation the other night means that
 we may continue U-2 flights.
 In view of the statement of the air marshal of Russia as to what
 they are going to do if they do continue, my question is this.: Should
 not our Government restate its position in regard to the continuation
 of U-2 flights and give the world assurance at the present time that
 we do not intend to continue U-2 flights and thus risk the possibility
 that the Russians may send a missile to the air base from which any
 U-2 flight might leave?
 Secretary GATES. Senator, I have in my hand the President's state-
 ment in Paris in which he said :
 In point of fact, these flights were suspended after the recent incident, and are
 not to be resumed.  Accordingly, this cannot be the issue.
 That is a categorical statement that they are not to be resumed,
 This is what I understand our position is.
 Senator MORSE. The President didn't say that in his speech to the
 Nation the other night.  There isn't anything in the President's
 speech to the Nation the other night that categorically and unequivo-
 cally assures to the world that we are discontinuing, as a matter of
 -espionage policy, the flying of any U-2 planes over any foreign
 territory.
 All I seek to do at this point in the record, and please let me assure
 you of this, is to raise this point so that our Government can remove
 any suspicion or fear in other parts of the world in view of the
 Russian air marshal's statement, that the world doesn't have to be
 concerned about a nuclear war being started by us by sending a U-2
 plane from any foreign base over Russia.
 I think the world is entitled to that assurance at this moment in
 order to produce the relaxation that I think is necessary for the con-
 tinuation, through the Unii:ed Nations I hope, of a good faith, this
 .attempt to reach some understanding with Russia.
 Secretary GATES. It may well need clarification, Senator.  I didn't
 think it did.. I thought it was perfectly clear to me that we had made
 a commitment so long as the President is in office, not to fly the U-2
 airplane, and everyone understood it.  If they don't, perhaps it should
 be reexamined.  However, you are now faced with making another
 statement in face of a threat, and I don't know whether this is a wise
 move or not.
 Senator MORSE. I think it is a wise move if we honestly believe
 that this is more than a threat, that this is an announcement of mili-
 tary policy that they intend to deliver on.
 I don't intend to argue the point.  I think the judgment of the
 world will be against us if, in view of what you call this threat, we
 should continue IT-2 flights, because I think we have to share joint
 responsibility with Russia then for starting a nuclear war, because
 I seriously question whether world opinion will ever be with us on
 this kind of espionage conduct.
 I think that world opinion is against our sending a U-2 flight over
 any foreign territory, because I think most people, in other parts of
 the world consider it. a form of constructive aggression.

 12       EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE  SUM IIT CONFERENCE
 That is all, dir. Chairman.
 The CHAIRMAN. Senator Ilickenlooper, do you have any further
 questions? I think you are next.
 Senator IliCKr.NLoorr:R. Mr. Secretary, with reference to the dis-
 cussion which you have just had with Senator :Morse-I think per-
 haps I only have a comment because my comment will go to a mat-
 ter of personal opinion-as I understand the line of questioning that
 has been going on here, and as I think it probably will be interpreted,
 the United States is required to take the burden for all the ills of the
 world and take the responsibilities for all the. mistakes in the world;
 that we must do everythnng, including complete, submission to the
 demands and the threats of the Kremlin; and that the opinion of the
 world is apt to be slanted against its unless we do this at this time.
 I have heard front so many sources over the country that we have
 to do this or that or the other thing as a gestnre that we are not
 war-minded or that. we are not warmongers, or that we really have
 some interest in our fellow man.
 Now, if the record of the United States over the last. good many
 years of humanitarian activities, of fantastic expenditures of billions
 of dollars for peace, of fostering~, all kinds of conferences, of making
 all kinds of offers to meet all kinds of reasonable propositions for
 peace, based only upon reasonable agreements for their assurance of
 being carried out-if that. isn`t an assurance to the world, I personally
 think that to humble ourselves further by yielding to this threat of
 this military mail in Russia would certainI  not atld to our prestige
 in the least, and it probably would be of little use in the eyes of the
 world, at least to those that we would expect to stand by us in an
 emergency.
 I can't.'follow that line of reasoning, especially in view of the past
 record of the United States.
 We started out at the end of World War II with the sole and
 exclusive possession of the atomic bomb, the ability to blow any na-
 tion off the map and anybody else if we wanted to if we were war-
 minded. Nobody else had it.  We offered to give it up to an inter-
 national agency to get out of the atomic business, to turn over all
 fissionable materials to an international agency: all we asked was that
 reasonable inspection, reasonable assurance, would be given that
 the international agency would have control and that no nation would
 cheat on this obligation.
 Never in the history of the world, as far as I know, has a nation,
 possessing the exclusive ability and the exclusive power to destroy
 any other nation in the world, have they ever given that up or offered
 to give it up voluntarily.
 Wo go from that step by step with vast amounts of money. with all
 kinds of humanitarian offers, with all kinds of peaceful offers, with
 all kinds of peaceful efforts in the world and 1 just want to make
 my position clear: we. have stated we are not going to overfly Russia,
 at least- so far as President. Eisenhower's administration is concerned,
 with U-2's--that: has been stopped.  If we did continue it sometime.
 in the future in the interests of the security of this country, I think

 lated risks that may be involved in order to secure essential informa-
 tion and in order to secure and maintain our proper defensive posture..
 I feel that very deeply and I am not questioning you about it.
 You don't have to agree or disagree.  I merely wanted to make
 that statement in view of the fact that I don't agree that we have
 continually to humble ourselves in the eyes of the world, because I
 think it can do nothing but destroy the confidence, in many cases, that
 other Nations have in us if we continue to bow to the threats that
 emanate periodically from the Kremlin, and we have had just as bad
 threats in the past as this one. As I pointed out in my previous ques-
 tions, where they said they have rockets pointed at our bases, they
 have rockets on the pads pointed at other countries in Europe;
 they know how many rockets they are going to put on Paris and
 that they are going to bury us one way or another, and so on, and I
 think there comes a time when even the world has to turn and stand
 fast. That is all I have to say.
 The CIAIRMAN. Is that all?
 Senator HIcKENLOOFER. Yes.
 The CHAIRMAN. Senator Gore?
 [Deleted.]
 The Senator's time is up.
 The Senator from Ohio, any questions?
 Senator LAusdun. No further questions.
 The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary, I don't want to labor this too long,
 but I am interested in your reasoning. I didn't get to finish that ques-
 tion.                                   Let me go back.  Do you think when Chairman Khrushchev
 was in the United States last September that at that time he had an
 intention to have a summit conference?
 Secretary GATES. I would only be speculating, Mr. Chairman.  I
 think he did.
 The CHAIRMAN. I want to know what happened between then and
 May 15, in your opinion, that caused him to take the firm decision
 which you stated a moment ago you believe he had.
 Secretary GATES. I really don't know the value of my opinion, Mr.
 Chairman, but my opinion is that he has tried for many years to
 divide our allies from us. He has tried to divide the NATO member-
 ship in particular. He has resented the bases that surround his coun-
 try, and he has had, I think, as a No. 1 objective the division of our
 security and collective alliances. I think he found during this inter-
 vening period that he couldn't make a dent in the solidarity and
 unity of these relationships, that he couldn't get anybody to change
 their position on Berlin. He found the British and the French and
 the United States stalwartly together on that subject, and that he
 found the NATO alliance in good shape and strong, and that he was
 going to run into a position where he would make no progress, and
 as someone else has remarked, I believe, during this testimony, he
 would probably lose some face at home if he couldn't make any
 progress.

 The Ctf:lia.NfAx. What inference from Soviet military preparedness
 can properly be drawn from the U-2 incident?
 Secretary G.vms. This, pieced together and repeated and associated
 with other sources of intelligence builds up, unfolds a story that defi-
 nitely disclosed a military posture.
 It builds up a story that gives you a judgment on a capability for
 a surprise attack.  It gives you a 1udgnnent.on important installations.
 It gives you some judgment. on production.  It gives you some judg-
 ment on logistic backup and actual military sites, so that I would say
 it gave you a, very definite look-see at their military posture.
 The Ct1ATRM.lN. Is it possible for you to rive us a judgment.? Was
 this preparation and strength very impressive? Was it greater than
 you had expected ?
 Secretary G.vn;s. Coming into two recent jobs I have had, which is
 the first time I was ever involved in this, I would say that it impressed
 me, Senator.
 The CIIAHtii.l1. In other words, the result of your overflights and

 said when I started to testify in .Tanuaiy, I repeatedly stated we didn't
 expect to have any significant or suhstantive concessions. We believed
 there was a tactic on the part of the Soviet Union. We didn't know
 how long it. would last and we are not basing our military programs on
 this premise and I also said that we should keep then under continuous
 review and as late as April we went back with a major revision in our
 military programs to the appropriations Committees.

 POSSIBLE INTERPRETATIONS OP THE ALERT
 The CHAIRMAN. One inference I wish you would comment on that
 might have been drawn from the ordering of the test on May 15 is, I
 believe : Would it be fair to draw the inference that you had any
 doubt about the readiness of our Armed Forces.
 Secretary GATES. No, sir, but it is a very good move and we should
 do it more frequently to have a no-notice alert communications and
 command readiness test, and we hope to do this, I say we started one
 again -last night which has been long planned, it is going to be about a
 7- or 8-day exercise.                                  -
 The CHAIRMAN. It has been long planned.
 Was the one on the 15th long planned?
 Secretary GATES. No, sir.
 The CHAIRMAN. When did you first think of doing that?
 Secretary GATES. There was another one planned for about that
 period of time, as a matter of fact, I made the decision to do this
 myself. -
 The CHAIRMAN. After you arrived in Paris?
 Secretary GATES. Yes, sir.
 The CHAIRMAN. Do you think that that might have been construed
 as a provocative act under the circumstances that then existed in
 Paris?
 Secretary GATES. No, sir, it was made after midnight on Sunday
 night.  It was not intended nor was it worded as a provocative mes-
 sage. The first word in it was "Quiet," and the last words in it were
 "minimum need to know."
 It was not meant as provocative.  It was not meant as either an
 offensive or defensive alert.
 In fact it was not issued as such. If we were going to go on that
 kind of an alert we would have had a higher degree of readiness, than
 the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued.
 The CHAIRMAN. I didn't mean you intended it as such. Don't you
 think reasonable people might have regarded it as a- provocative act?
 Secretary GATES. I think reasonable people would have regarded
 it as a prudent act.
 The CHAIRMAN. But not as % provocative act?
 -
 Secretary GATES. That is right.
 The CHAIRMAN. My time is up. Wo have a member here who has
 just come in.  Would you care to ask any questions, Senator

 I don't think so, sir.

 Going back to my hypothetical, assuming that we should fly a spy
 plane out of some foreign base and assuming that the Russian air mar-
 shal makes good on his threat and strikes that airbase with Russian
 missiles and starts a general war, do you think we could win it?
 Secretary GATES. Yes, sir.
 Senator MoRSE. You think we could destroy Russia and have enough
 of the United States left so that we could remain a power?
 Secretary GATES. Yes, sir; because in this case he would, by initiat-
 ing this attack, give considerable warning to our retaliatory forces
 and with that warning, we would move in..
 Senator MORSE. Your view then is that the United States could win
 ?         a nuclear war?
 Secretary GATES. If it is started under those circumstances.
 [Deleted.]
 Senator MORSE. Do you think that the Russian military are aware
 of the fact that we could win a nuclear war if they started that war
 by simply sending a missile to one air base from which a spy plane
 might fly?
 Secretary GATES. I think they are well aware of it.
 Senator MORSE. Do you think then that if he kept his threat of
 sending a missile to a foreign air base from which a spy plane might
 be flown, he probably, would go much further than that and send mis-
 siles elsewhere and if he knows it is going to lead to a general war,
 start a complete general war?
 Secretary GATES. I think he would have to.
 Senator MORSE. In your opinion, could we win that war?
 Secretary GATES. Well, we could do what we call in the military,
 prevail in general war, but there would be great damage to the United
 States.
 Senator MoRsE. There would be terrific mutual destruction in a
 general war?
 Secretary GATES. Yes ; terrific damage.
 Senator MoRSE. Therefore
 Secretary GATES. But everything depends, Senator, on a lot of fac-
 tors.  If you vary any part of the equation you vary the answer.  In
 other words, time of warning, reliability of missiles ability to fire a
 salvo of missiles worldwide against deployed and U.. forces at home
 and abroad.  These factors and the accuracies of these weapons-any
 one piece of this equation varies the answer.
 INTERPRETATION OF PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ON SUSPENSION OF U-2

 Ilickenlooper's observation, do you think that we would he showing a

 would be surrendering to threats if we removed any doubt in the
 world at the present moment by notifying the world that we have no,
 intention of usin o? military aircraft espionage tactics henceforth either

 I        EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SU   1IT CONFERENCE
 Secretary G.LTES. Well, I wouldn't know quite. how to answer your
 question, Senator, because maybe some of us that live so close to these
 things have. a ditTerent nmlerstanding than tile public. has.  It is so
 clear in my mind that the President has made a commitment not to
 ily these airplanes during his administration that I believe that the
 question becomes by(,othet ical, and I believe if it is clear to other
 people as it is to Inc ttiai this is so, then it would be. I believe, stepping
 up to a threat.  But if it is not clear, and I am incorrect in this, then
 I think we ought to take. a. look at it..
 Senator Moi sr:. I ain so anxious to see to it that we make it crystal
 ,clear because I ant very much concerned about world reaction to our
 present position.  I think we are living in the nionieiit now where we
 ,can stop an adverse world reaction, and 1 (-]link we are living in a
 moment where there is great danger that a substantial segment of
 world opinion is going to go against its, tuiless. we are willing to crake
 crystal clear that we are not going to, through any agency of our
 Government, resort. to aircraft espionage, because we are dewing here
 when we are dealing with espionage, as you so very well, I think.
 described it yourself, with a form of activity that is a pretty ugly
 business.
 Secretary G.1Tns. Ye,-, sir.
 Senator AIeorts}:. And we all know that it isn't based on principles
 of truth.  In espionage, you do what is necessary to protect your
 country, including deception and engaging in iin.moral arts.  [De-
 leted.]
 ,\-ow, T don't think we humble ourselves.  To the contrary, I think
 we put their on the defensive. in world opinion if we say to (lie world:
 Listen, Ave want the Russians to understand That they are going to have to
 assume full responsibility for any starting of a war.  We have said and we re-
 peat to the world that we have no intention of using aircraft in espionage work
 over foreign territory.
 You think it is lierfe,-Hy clear.  I have just colic from across the
 country and I can give you assurance that it isn't, in tiny judgment
 clear in American public opinion today, and you have really got a
 segment. of public opinion in this country that wants that assurance
 from the. President, because they take note of (lie, fact that in his
 speech the other night he wasn't even as definite as he was at Paris
 in regard to this matter.
 Secretary G.tTr?.s. Senator, under the American tradition. I would
 say that the President says lie isn't. going to overfly Russia during
 his administration, any circumvention of that statement would not be
 in character with either the President or our country. To me, it is
 completely clear, but I respect your judgment.
 Senator hfoltsr. I may be completely wrong. My only point is that
 we can afford, it seems to me., as a Nation that. does seek peace, to re-
 assure the world as many times as that when assurance might help the
 cause of peace, and in doing so I don't think we humble ourselves.
 To the contrary, I think we put Russia on the defensive.  It will help
 us in my judgment to win the so-called battle of propaganda. for
 peace and strengthen its in getting these issues into the nited Nations.

 Of course I would say this.  I think the President is to be commended
 for making clear in Paris that he is suspending U-2 flights-that is
 What lie said; U-2 flights.
 I think he is to be commended for that, and I hope that, those who
 seek to replace him will give the world assurance immediately that
 when any one of them is elected President that will be their policy,
 too, because if all this is a moratorium for a few months, it is not
 going to strengthen America's position in world opinion.  They want
 to know whether or not this is going to be the policy of the United
 States, because, in my judgment, if you continue espionage work by
 way of aircraft, you are going to lose the world opinion in southeast
 Asia, Latin America, and Africa, the opinion of which America has
 got to win in the decades ahead to survive, because if that part of
 the world goes against us, it is only a matter of a few decades before
 we will cease, in my judgment, being a Nation.
 You have got to win to the cause of freedom those hundreds of
 millions of people, and you are not going to do it in my judgment if
 you let Khrushchev get by with a propaganda drive now that we are
 the ones that are committing a form of aggression by carrying out an
 espionage program.  We don't like to face up to it but in my judgment
 that is going to be the verdict of those people.

 SECRETARY GATES' PARTICIPATION IN ISSUANCE OP STATEMENTS

 was a unanimous decision.  Did I correctly understand you?
 -
 Secretary GATES. The statement that was issued was a unanimous
 paper. I think I am answering you yes.
 Senator GoRE. I wanted to give you an opportunity to affirm that,
 and you so do now.
 You did not participate, I believe you told me, or you told the com-
 mittee, in any conference between the 5th and the 9th.
 Secretary GATES. That is correct.
 Senator GORE. So you did not participate in a conference or in a
 communication between the Department of State, the President at
 Gettysburg, or otherwise, with anyone regarding the issuance of the
 statement which was issued on the 7th by Mr. Herter?
 Secretary GATES. No, I did not.

 by him a. conciliatory attitude fora period of about a month or two?
 Are you able to answer that?
 Secretary G:vrr.s. My impression is about the same as yours, Sen-
 ator, that there was sort of a tone of conciliation in the air.
 Senator LAUSCIIF. We have had before this committee the Ant-
 arctic Treaty that has been recommended.
 Secretary GATES. Yes, sir.
 Senator L:IrsCIiF. That was signed by the Soviet and by the United
 States.
 Secretar+y GATES. Yes, sir.
 Senator L_IusCIiF.  Agin that, I think, was last December 1.  And
 there was progress made fora period on the matter of banning nuclear
 tests.
 Secretary Gxrrs. Yes; t here was progress made.
 Senator LAtSCIIE. In fact, their was more progress made during
 that period than there had been at any other time on that subject.
 Secretary G.vrn . T think that would be fair to say, that it looked
 more hopeful.
 Senator L.AUSCIIE. Oin November 1.1 in a.speechKhrushchev brutally
 attacked Adenauer and the. German Republic.
 Secretary G 1TFSS. I a?enaemiaer the speech.
 Senator LArsciIE. You remember that speech?
 Secretary GATES. Yes, sir.
 Senator LAUSCnE. And there was some speculation in the minds of
 the people in our Government as to what his purpose was in making
 that attack when ostensibly there was to be a conference. to reach sonic
 agreement on West Germany and Berlin.
 Now then, on December 1, he began repeating his threats that he
 would sign a. separate peace treaty with East Germany.  Is it not a
 fact that his attack upon Adenauer and upon the German Republic
 and his purpose to sign a separate peace treaty, was confirmation of
 the immovable position he took before he met at Camp David about
 West Berlin and East Germany?
 Secretary G.vTrs. Yes: I think it, was.  T think his posit ion was well
 advertised, and we felt- iii the Department of Defense that we were
 living under a threat of a separate peace treaty at tlutt time.
 Senator L.~rSCrrF. Then lie has the Baku speech of April ?5 in which
 he gave a harsher version of what he, had been saying for months
 about East Berlin, West Berlin, and the German Republic. That is
 in April, pretty close to May 1B, and then we have those circumstances
 in which you point- out tliat lie. had a translated paper originally
 written in Russian into French translation so that he gave it to--
 Secretary G.iTEs. De Gaulle.
 Senator i~  sciiF. De Gaulle.  How did he present his paper to
 Macmillan?
 Secretary G-vrvs. My understanding, Senator, was that lie didn't.
 leave a paper with Macmillan.  He talked from the same paper and
 it was translated through an interpreter to Macmillan verbally.  This
 is my understanding.
 Senator T,AURCHE Isn't it also n, fact that during all of this time and

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 KIIRUSIICIIEV'S SUMMIT CONFERENCE AIMS
 Senator LAUSCIIE. In your opinion, What was the primary thing that
 he was aiming for in the conference?  I am speaking of Khrushchev.
 Secretary IxATES. You mean when he agreed to go to a summit
 conference?
 Senator LAUSCIJE.And down to the end.
 Secretary GATES. I testified that I think he thought he would have
 his way and make some peace treaty in Berlin with some kind of give
 on the part of our allies and our allies refused to give.
 REASONS FOR REVOKING INVITATION TO rRESIDENT EISENIIOWER
 Senator LAUSCHE. All right.  Now then, have you given any
 thought to why he revoked the invitation to the President to come to
 the Soviet land?
 Secretary GATES. Well, again we speculate but in my opinion the
 last thing he wanted was for the President to travel around his coun-
 try and be acclaimed and received by the population of Russia.
 Senator LAUscIiE. Do you think that he had flashes in his mind
 about the acclaim that Nixon got in Poland, and in other places?
 Secretary GATES. Ile probably did.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. And do you think that he kind of thought that
 there would be demonstrations for the President of the United States
 by the Russian people unparalleled anywhere?
 Secretary GATES. I believe there would have been.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. That is my honest conviction, that he did not dare
 have the President meet the Ukrainian people and the normal Russian
 people, excluding the Communists, in that trip to the Soviet and that
 is why the invitation was revoked.
 Senator WILEY. Will the Senator yield?
 Senator LAUSCIIE. I yield.
 POSSIBLE INFLUENCE OF THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS ON KIIRUSIICIIEV'S
 THINKING
 Senator WILEY. I think there are some other facts there that fit
 into the picture that you have very dramatically given us.
 Do you remember after he came to America he went back and he
 canvassed individually the various heads of the various states, and
 then he made a trip out east and he met Mao Tse-tung?
 . It was after that that he made that Baku speech.  He made several
 other speeches, and if you remember, the papers were pretty well filled
 with the thoughts that the Chinese Communists were telling him, and
 that at the time that he did go to Paris, that conditions were such that
 the evidence indicated the Chinese were in Russia.  Now all this
 bolsters the conclusion that the Secretary has made, that it wasn't the
 U-2 incident.  That was just something that he got hold of as an
 ostensible reason.
 The other was that he couldn't get his way and that, I understand, is
 your position.
 Senator LAUSCIIE. I have nothing more to ask you.  Thank you
 very much, Mr. Gates.

 SSenator Gone,. If the Senator would yield, I would like to observe
 that I was in the Far East at the time President Eisenhower made his
 visit to India and other countries, and there was a tremendous favor-

 I think it, is a great loss to us that the President has been denied
 the opportunity to visit in the Soviet Union. It would have, in my
 view, been a. great contribution.  Ile is unquestionably a great exem
 plary influence for America, and I agree with you, Senator Lausche
 and Senator Wiley, that, the denial of the opportunity of this visit is
 a great loss to us.

 it.  Everyone can draw his own conclusions there.

 PRESIDENT EISENHOWER'S DIGNITY AND CIIARACTy.r, AT PARIS MEETING
 Secretary GATES. I want to make a comment. I sort of feel like mak-
 ing, Mr. Chairman.                              T think you know about this because you were
 there.  I think everyone should be terribly proud of the dignity and
 character of the President in this Paris meeting.
 I happened to be sitting next to him and it was a most remarkable
 performance of strength of character and dignity of any man I have
 ever seen.
 Senator GoRE. You might. be interested to know that I immediately
 took the floor and expressed such views, and I do not believe you will
 find any member of this committee has criticized the President's con-
 duct while in Paris.
 Secretary GATES. I am sure of that. The purpose of my remarks
 was not intended to do anything but just. make a statement.  I know
 he has had remarkable support of not only the Congress and this coun-
 try, but of all of our allies too, the NATO meeting that followed the
 Paris meeting was a remarkable meeting.
 The CHAIRMAN. Is that all, gentlemen?
 Senator Wii,Er. I want. to express what you usually do, the appre-
 ciation of the committee for the fine work- of the Secretary here this
 morning.
 Senator LArscIIE. I did want to go into this speech of Senator Dodd
 where he points out how Communists took charge in the organizing
 of the meeting in New York of the Committee for a Sane Nuclear
 Policy.  But- 7 am not going to go into it.
 The CIIAIRZTA?. Mr. Secretary, I -,t ant to thank you for your very
 frank and candid responses and for the patience that you have shown
 in bearing with the, committee in asking these questions.  I think you
 have made a very useful record for the benefit of the committee, and
 I think we understand what has gone on much better than we did be-
 fore you came, tip here., and I hope, that the record, as censored by the
 proper authorities, will not in any way embarrass you.

 CHALMERS ROBERTS' CHRONOLOGY OP EVENTS
 Senator GORE. Now I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the
 record a chronology of events which I found exceedingly well done by
 Mr. Chalmers Roberts.
 The CHAIRMAN. Without objection it is so ordered.

 [From the Washington Post, May 27, 1960]
 CIIBONOLOGY or TI-2 INCIDENT TRACED IN TANGLED WEB OF SUMMIT DISPUTE
 WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE?
 (By Chalmers M. Roberts)
 Who was responsible for the incredible assortment of conflicting statements
 and contradictory assertions when the Eisenhower administration was con-
 fronted with the U-2 spy plane crisis?
 This is the most immediate question in the tangled web of the U-2 affair
 and the subsequent collapse of the Summit Conference in Paris.  What follows
 is a detailed examination of the facts about the Administration's handling of
 the U-2 case.
 It should be noted beforehand, however, that there are other important parts
 to the whole story : The apparent public hardening of American policy toward
 the Soviet Union prior to the TJ-2 affair; Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev's
 reaction to that hardening; Khrushchev's reactions to the American accounts of
 th  U-2 case ; and the internal Soviet pressures an Khrushchev, before and
 after the spy plane was downed, because of his year-old policy of trying to do
 business with President Eisenhower.
 Whether or not Khrushchev would have scuttled the Summit, had there been
 no U-2 incident, is not now clear; there are divided opinions in the Adminis-
 tration on that.  A good many diplomats do tend to agree with what President
 Eisenhower  said to  the congressional leaders yesterday-that Khrushchev
 may have scuttled the conference because he was under "pressure by the
 Stalinists," those in Moscow suspicious of any dealing with the West, "and the
 Chinese" Communists who have openly disagreed with Khrushchev's policies.
 But that question is only indirectly related to the handling of the U-2 affair
 by the Eisenhower Administration.
 The chief figures in the U-2 drama in Washington were president Eisenhower,
 ?             Secretary of State Christian A. Herter, Under Secretary C. Douglas Dillon, Cen-
 tral Intelligence Agency Chief Allen W. Dulles and White House Press Secretary
 James C. Hagerty.
 It is evident from the record that much of the confusion sprang from the
 fact that no one acted in supreme authority in directing the Administration's
 actions.
 Here is the chronological record as far as it is known today :
 May J.-The U-2 flight of pilot Francis G. Powers took place on this date
 because of a clear weather forecast.  That forecast also indicated that such
 good weather probably would not be repeated for some weeks; that is, until
 after the Summit Conference, then 2 weeks off.  CIA officials say the equip-
 ment carried by Powers, including the tiny poison needle, is standard equipment
 carried by all Strategic Air Command crews.  It is designed to help a crewman
 escape if downed in enemy territory. Powers never was ordered to use the
 needle to avoid capture ; it was for use to avoid torture, if captured, according
 to CIA officials.  The pistol was not for murdering Russians but for shooting
 small game, it is contended.

 Second flight
 The day of Powers' flight, there was a second U-2 flight from Turkey.  This
 was a meteorological flight outside the Soviet Union, the kind of flight the Na-
 tional Aeronautics and Space Administration unwittingly thought all U-2's were
 making.  NASA was, of course, the "cover" for the clandestine flights over the
 Soviet Union.
 These penetrations of Soviet air space had been going on for four years with
 results highly gratifying to American intelligence officials.  There had been a
 great many of these flights and the Powers mission was not the first designed to
 cross the Soviet Union.  Others had succeeded when he failed.
 So detailed were the protographs brought buck by the U- 2s that at one time
 the State Department's Policy Planning Stair considered a proposal to show them
 to Khrushchev.  The idea was to use them in an effort to break down his resist-
 ance to inspection and control for various disarmament schemes.
 The proposal was rejected, however, partially on the grounds that Khrushchev
 already knew of the flights and that such a move might lead him to make such a
 public row that they would have to be discontinued.
 Cutoff planned
 CIA officials contend that there was to he a cutoff of U-2 flights before the
 Summit, that the question was how much time constituted a margin of safety.
 Nevertheless, the Powers mission was permitted to take place two weeks before
 the Summit.  In his speech on Wednesday the President implied he fully ap-
 proved of that.
 Mr. Eisenhower said that, as to complaints over the timing of the flights so
 close to the Summit, "there is notime when vigilance can be relaxed."  By im-
 plication, he meant there was no reason to cancel the flight because of the Im-
 pending conference with the Russians.
 However, this has not always been the President's policy.  In September, 1916.
 In the midst of the Suez crisps negotiations with the Russians as well as the
 Egyptians--the President did order a halt to the U-2 flights. Then he apparently
 wanted to avoid an incident which would make negotiation more difficult.
 There is no evidence, however, that the President was aware beforehand of
 this particular flight or that either the State Department or the CIA thought his
 specillc approval necessary.  Ile had delegated authority for the flights, once hav-
 ing approved the entire U- 2 scheme following Soviet rejection of his "open skies"
 plan at the 1955 Geneva Summit conference.
 May 1--y: During this period the CIA and the State Department knew that
 Powers was missing; they hoped he had crashed and that pilot and plane had
 left no tell-tale evidence.   The Initial confusion over the missing plane, as to
 whether it was rowers or the legitimate meteorological flight in Turkey the same
 day, was soon cleared up.     There is no evidew'e that the Administration laid
 out any plan of how to handle the possible disclosures later made by Khrushchev.
 May have been misled
 The Administration may have been misled into thinking Khrushchev would
 remain silent because of Soviet action over the t' lx-t?tctii visit to the United States
 of the boss of the Soviet. Air Force, Air Marshal K. A. Vershinin.
 On May 2 t1w Soviets asked for a 45-hour LH,stpooensent. of the announcement
 ' the visit.  But on May 4 they agreed to a joint United States-Soviet anuounce-
 ment and it was made that tiny.  The visit was canceled on May 13 after Khru-
 sla'hev's l'-2 disclosure.
 On May 3 it was announced from Istanbul, Turku  that a single-engine Air
 Force plane was missing near Lake Van, not far frosn [ht- Soviet border.  It was
 described as a high altitude research plane belonging to NASA.
 The report said the plane was one of two which had taken off from the United
 States base at Incrilik near Adana. Turkey, on a weather reconnaissance mission.
 The other plane returned safely but the pilot of the missing craft was said to
 have reported his oxygen equipment was out of order.
 Standard story
 This was the standard sort of "cover" story for the missing U-2, issued in the
 hopes that it would suffice.  It. was not known here whether rowers' U-2 went
 down or why.  To this date, in fact, there is only Khrushchev's word that it was
 downed near Sverdlovsk, deep Inside the Soviet Union.
 May S.-Khrushchev announced to the Supreme Soviet in Moscow the bare de-
 tails of the U-2 flight, deliberately (he said later) withholding information

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE  SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 which would have let Washington know that Powers was alive and that much
 of his equipment had been captured intact. Ile set a trap into which the Eisen-
 hower Administration fell.
 In his Wednesday speech, Mr. Eisenhower contended that the "covering state-
 ment," as he called it, was imperative "to protect the pilot, his mission, and our
 intelligence processes at a time when the true facts were still undetermined."
 On May 5 Secretary Herter was in Athens, en route home from a NATO for-
 eign ministers conference in Turkey.  In charge of the State Department was
 Under Secretary Dillon.
 Dillon's responsibility
 Under the President's delegation of authority, it was Dillon's responsibility
 for what next occurred until Herter's return late on May 6.  It was on May 5
 and 6 that the administration allowed itself to be entangled in a series of lies
 about the U-2.
 When newsmen went to Press Secretary Hagerty for comment on Khrushchev's
 speech, Hagerty was careful to say only that the President did not know of the
 news story about the speech.
 News of the speech arrived here just after the President had left by helicopter
 for a National Security Council meeting at a secret hideout, part of a civil de-
 fense exercise.  There is no evidence on whether the President at that meeting
 discussed what to do about the Khrushchev disclosure.  The subsequent record
 indicates that he left it to Dillon and the State Department.
 State Department spokesman Lincoln White, who received his instructions
 personally from Dillon, said that "it may be" that the plane Khrushchev referred
 to was the missing so-called NASA aircraft.  It was also announced that the
 President had ordered an immediate inquiry into Khrushchev's accusation.
 Trouble compounded
 This semi-lie was aggravated by NASA's press chief, Walter T. Bonney.  Un-
 aware that NASA was being used as a "cover" for the spy flights, Bonney said
 at a press conference that the plane was on a wholly peaceful mission.  He gave
 details of the plane's Adana take-off, its route within Turkey and the pilot's
 alleged report of his oxygen trouble.  The Administration's story thus was that
 a peaceful flight outside Soviet borders might have by accident transgressed the
 Soviet-Turkish border.
 There is no evidence that the President or Dillon, or anyone else in authority
 in the Administration, took charge of the whole affair and told NASA to say
 nothing.  There have been subsequent hints from the White House, however,
 that some such order went out to NASA but was overlooked or disregarded. The
 record here is not clear.
 May 6.-In Moscow it was claimed the U-2 was shot down by a rocket on
 Khrushchev's personal order, but other details still were withheld.  However,
 Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko termed the American explanation
 "nonsense."
 "Full facts" asked
 The State Department said it was asking the "full facts" in Moscow.  White,
 still acting tinder Dillon's orders, declared that "there was absolutely no-n-o-
 deliberate attempt to violate the Soviet airspace."  The lie thus was: compounded.
 Around dinner time Herter arrived home from Greece to take charge of the
 State Department.
 The strongest evidence that the handling of the U-2 affair was left by the
 President to the State Department-first to Dillon, then to Herter-comes from
 Vice President Richard M. Nixon.  On a May 15 television show Nixon gave this
 explanation, putting part of the blame for the fumbling on the insistent demand
 of newsmen for the facts :
 "Now, let's look at the problem with which our people in the State Department
 were confronted when this information developed.  They (lid not know at the
 outset what the Soviet Union knew.  They did not know that the pilot had been
 recovered and that they had obtained information from him or otherwise which
 made it imperative we acknowledge that these flights had taken place,
 Alternative question
 "Now, some would say then, `well, why then didn't we keep our mouths shut
 and say nothing and wait until we found out what they knew?'
 "And here again we have the problem of the open society.  We have newsmen
 in Washington.  The newsmen descended upon the State Department and other

 'officials In great numbers.  They bad it right to.  And they asked for the in-
 formation.  What about this?  And, so under the ciro?tunztances, It was felt that
 the best, thing to do was to engage in pfTtet?t In what usually is engaged in where
 so-exiled espionage activities are undertaken, evasive actions-evasive actions,
 so as to protect the pilot in the event that he had been captured and also evasive
 actions so as to give the Soviet Union, Mr. Khrushchev, for example, an oppor-
 tunity to accept the consequences of this flight without admitting its he has had
 to admit that It had been conducted for espionage purposes."
 Later in the same iirogrant Nixon added that "they hall to nuke a snap de-
 ci,;inn at (he moment and It, proved that---it fumed out that that decision was
 wrong and in these kinds of activities, we, of course, want to try to avoid mis-
 takes if we can."
 Refurt'accs /nis,fiif/
 Nowhere in tbelhree-and-at hatdf-hour television program did Nixon refer to any
 presidential direction in the I'-2 crisis, other than his approval of the flights
 sonic years earlier.  Nor was their any reft?rence to his own part in tite affair.
 Nixon, of course, sits In the National Security Council.
 Nixon did say that lie was "privy.. to the d'-2 reconnaissance policy "and I do
 endorse it."  He also said that "I knew about ibis flight * * ..?
 On Friday afteritxtlt,'lay fl, the Pri?sidcut went to his Gettysburg, I'll., farm
 for a weekend of rest and golf.  He did not. return to Wasitingitin until Sunday,
 31ay S but he was in telephone routninndet!lina with Herter during the weekend.

 Herter.

 pilot. was alive and talking and that much of his equipment had been captured
 intaet.  Khrushchev showed the Supreme Soviet photos taken from the I'   of
 Soviet military Installations ant( he detailed the plane's equiputent.
 Genuine in-formation
 American officials, who received the speech in the morning, Washington time,
 knew Khr,ashehev was using; inroruoation that was genuine and that some of it
 could have come only front rowers himself.
 Khrushchev quoted Hagerty as saying That "the President. in his opinion,
 knew nothing about the ine?hlent involving the American plane.  I fully admit
 (earn Khrushche?v) that thi? President did not know that it plane was sent be-
 yond the Soviet frontier and did not return."
 The Khrusbr'hev six'ech resulted in a series of all-day conferences, in which the
 chief figures were Herter, Iiilimi. Allen Bolles and it number of lesser State
 Departiiuyit officials, including Ilcrter's adviser on Soviet affairs, Charles E.
 Bohlen.
 nut of this came a unanimous decision to tell the truth -but not all the truth.
 The dinner-hour State Department statentettt said that the flight referred to by
 Khrushchev "was probably undertaken by an unarmed civilian 1'-?1 plane ? * "?
 Flight justified
 The flight was justified nn the grounds of the iiced "to obtain information now
 concealed behind the Iron Curtain" to lessen the dangers of a surprise attack
 on the' free world in general and the United States In particular.
 On the critical issue of who was responsible for the flight, however, the state-
 merit lied.  It said that "as it result of the inquiry ordered by the President it
 has lien established that insofar as the authorities in Washington are con-
 cerned there  was no authorization for any such slight as described by Mr.
 Mr. Khrushchev."
 lit iniking this stateutent. chiefly the decision of Secretary Herter. those in-
 volved were guided by a number of considerations.  They felt that Khrushchev
 hail the evidence and therefore an admission was essential despite the earlier
 lies.  hut they were trapped In a dilemma on the issue of responsibility.  They
 rlea'tded It was best to avoid admitting any responsibility by President Eisen-
 hower even at the cost of accepting the resultant impression that Washington's
 control was so lax that American pilots around the world could go ofd'. on their
 own on a mission that might provoke a war.
 Dulles trilling

 as head of CIA, was prepared to take full responsibility for the flight, that if the

 Administration wanted to pin the blame on him to avoid blaming the President,
 he would agree.  But this idea was not accepted as being practical in view of
 Khrushchev's disclosures.
 Herter read the draft statement on the phone to the President in Gettysburg.
 He approved it without changing a word.
 In part, at least, Herter's decision to tell the lie that no one in Washington
 authorized the flight also was based in the slim hope that somehow Khrushchev
 would accept it. The Secretary and his aides had noted Khrushchev's acceptance
 of what he had taken as Hagerty's disclaimer of any Eisenhower responsibility.
 May 8-While the world assessed the seemingly incredible American admission
 that the U-2 had indeed been on an espionage flight, President Eisenhower re-
 turned to Washington and met with Herter at the White House.
 Notes to Britain, France
 The same day Khrushchev sent notes to Britain and France about the forth-
 coming summit conference.  In them he complained about the U-2 but gave no
 indication it would be used to wreck the conference as was to be the case.
 By now Hagerty was alarmed at the implications of the admission statement,
 implications that the President did not know what was going on.  He was
 insistent to Herter that this should somehow be eliminated.  It is not clear
 whether the President said the same thing to Herter directly but if he did there
 would seem to have been no, reason for Hagerty to do so.
 May 9-After another State Department conference, Herter put out a state-
 ment in his name saying that "penetration" by the U-2s of the Soviet Union had
 been going on for four years, that this had been done by presidential orders
 "since the beginning of his Administration" in order to. gather intelligence.  But
 Herter added that "specific missions of these unarmed civilian aircraft have not
 been subject to presidential authorization."  This, at last, appeared to be the
 truth.
 Unaware of implication
 This was the statement which left the implication that such U-2 flights would
 be continued over the Soviet Union.  But there is reason to believe that none of
 those involved at State Department was conscious of any such implication when
 they drafted the statement.  They took the view, shared by the CIA, that the
 U-2 setup now was "a blown agent" to be discarded, that other intelligence
 gathering methods would continue, however.
 Nonetheless the implication was there and neither State nor the White House
 did anything to correct it until the President himself told Khrushchev in Paris
 a full week later that "these flights were suspended after the recent incident
 and are not to be resumed."
 The President said Wednesday he wanted no public announcement until he
 met Khrushchev in Paris.  American officials also claimed the flight suspension
 was ordered the previous Thursday, May 12, which is at cross-purposes with the
 claim that no implication of further flights was contained in Herter's, May 9
 statement.
 Nixon unaware
 Indeed, Nixon in his May 15 television appearance seemed unaware that the
 ffights.had been cancelled.  He then said :
 "The first responsibility of the President of the United States * * * is, to
 protect the security of this country and of free peoples everywhere from the
 devastation that would result. from a surprise attack.  Now, that is why these
 flights were made in the first place.  That is why an indication has been made
 that such activities may have to continue in the future * * *"
 Herter and Dulles appeared on May 9 before a specially arranged closed-door
 Congressional leadership meeting.  To at least some of those present Herter
 left the clear implication that the flights would continue.
 May 10.-The Soviet news agency, Tass, described Ierter's statement as "a
 frank attempt to legalize and justify violation of the state frontiers of other
 nations for espionage purposes." A Soviet note to. the. United States avoided
 blaming President Eisenhower personally but, in referring to the May 7 state-
 ment by State, said it did "not correspond to reality."  It charged that the U-2
 flights "are carried on with the sanction of the Government of the United States
 of America."

 Welcome doubted
 May 11.-At an exhibition in Moscow of the U-2 wreckage and equipment,
 Khrushchev said Herter's May 9 statement made hint doubt "Our earlier conclu-
 sion" that the President himself did not know of the flights.  He said he doubted
 the President would be welcome in Russia during his scheduled dune visit there.
 When asked whether the U-2 incident would conic up at the Summit Confer-
 ence, Khrushchev replied: "It Is already the subject of worldwide discussion.
 Therefore I believe there is no need to put it on the discussion schedule at the
 Summit Conference."
 The same day at his press conference here President Eisenhower took full
 responsibility for the U-2 flights, said nothing to counter the implication that
 they would continue, remarked that "no one wants another Pearl Harbor."
 May 12-1.4.-During this period Khrushchev went to Paris a day early, arriv-
 Ing on Saturday, May 14.  Herter arrived on May 13 but there was no United
 States-Soviet contact.  On the 13th the Soviet Union sent protest notes to Nor-
 way, Pakistan and Turkey warning against further use of their territory for
 such missions as those of the U-2 which Khrushchev had claimed took off from
 Pakistan with the expectation of landing in Norway.
 On the 12th the United States sent a note to MMoseow which said the United
 States had "fully stated its position" about the U-2 incident in the May 9 Herter
 statement.
 By now President Eisenhower's responsibility for the U-2 flights, if not for the
 specific Powers mission, had been firmly established on the public record.
 May 15.-The President arrived in Paris just before Khrushchev's call on
 French President de Gaulle.  The President considered two possible moves in
 this final day before the Summit Conference was to open : To ask fora bilateral
 meeting with Khrushchev and to announce publicly that no more flights would
 be made.
 But the President decided against either step.  He did so chiefly on the basis
 of de Gaulle's report of the hard stand taken by Khrushchev in their talk that
 morning.  Ills aides told him they deduced from Klsrnshchev's words with de
 Gaulle that the Soviet leader had come to Paris bound by a prior Moscow deci-
 sion by the ruling Presidimn, that he therefore could not be swayed by either
 suggested Eisenhower move.
 Allen statement
 On this same day In Washington George V. Allen, chief of the U. S. Informa-
 tion Agency, said on a television show that Herter "has not said that we are
 going to continue to fly" IT-2 missions, that "he hasn't said one way or another."
 This statement surprised State I)epartment officials who now say Allen was talk-
 ing entirely on his own, that. he had consulted nobody In advance.
 May 1G.-At the only Paris confrontation between President Eisenhower and
 Khrushchev, the Soviet leader said the United States had "torpedoed" the con-
 ference.  He demanded that the President apologize for the flights, call off
 further flights and punish those responsible for Powers' mission.  These were
 the same demands of which lie had informed de Gaulle the day before.  He
 charged the President with making "treachery" the basis of his policy toward
 the Soviet Union.
 To this the President responded by terming Khru?hchev's demands an "ulti-
 matum" which "would never be acceptable to the United States."'                                       He also told
 Khrushchev that 11-2 flights had been suspended and would not be resumed.
 The two men parted In anger.  The Summit had collapsed before It had begun.

 [Prom the Congressional Record, May 25, 1960, pp. 10234-10237]
 TILE COMMUNIST INFILTRATION IN THE NUCLEAR TEST BAN MOVEMENT
 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in his statement of January 22, J. Edgar Hoover
 warned that Nikita Khrushchev's visit to this country had resulted in the
 reinvigoration of the American Communist movement and that the FBI was
 receiving increasing evidence of stepped-up Communist activities at many points.
 Among other things, Mr. Hoover warned that non-Communist organizations
 dedicated to causes that command popular support could expect Communist
 efforts to infiltrate their ranks.
 Evidence that has come into the hands of the Subcommittee on Internal
 Security indicates that the Communist Party has made the nuclear test ban
 movement the chief target of its infiltration operations.  I think it important
 that this evidence be placed before Congress and before the public so that we
 may have a better understanding of the methods by which the Communists
 operate and of the goals they seek to achieve.  I should like to detail to you
 some of the evidence of this infiltration,. and to suggest the outline of a self-
 defense program for all organizations whose purposes make them particularly
 vulnerable to Communist infiltration.
 I do not accept the thesis that if one happens to hold a position that enjoys
 the support of the Communist Party on any issue, one is, ipso facto, either a
 pro-Communist or a fellow traveler.  The Communists are opposed to the poll
 tax : does that make all people who oppose the poll tax Communists?  The
 Communists support the Forand bill.  Does that make the many millions of
 Americans who have endorsed the bill Communist sympathizers?  Obviously not.
 But on a foreign policy issue of overriding importance like the test ban, if a
 legitimate organization adheres to a policy which coincides with Communist
 policy, then it must be prepared to expect a concerted effort at infiltration by the
 Communist termites.  The more urgent the issue, the more respectable the
 organization, the more illustrious the names on its letterhead, the greater the
 temptation from the Communist standpoint.
 The Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy is headed by a group of nationally
 prominent citizens about whose integrity and good faith there is no question.
 Among them are people like Norman Cousins, of the Saturday Review, Mr.
 Clarence Pickett of the American Friends Service Committee, Mr. Norman
 Thomas, and so forth.  They advocate a point of view which some of us consider
 unrealistic or utopian, but it is, nevertheless, a significant point of view on an
 issue of life and death importance.  For the personal motivations of most of
 those associated with the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy I have the most
 sincere respect. The point of view they represent deserves a hearing-indeed,
 it must be heard.
 Last Thursday evening, May 19, the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy held
 a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City.  Many eminent persons
 attended this rally.  The speakers included Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, Mr. Alfred
 Landon, Mr. Walter Reuther, Gov. G. Mennen Williams, of Michigan, and Dr.
 Harold Taylor, former President of Sarah Lawrence College.  At this meeting,
 the speakers urged that another summit meeting be convened for the purpose
 of attempting to arrive at an agreement banning nuclear tests.
 Because I esteem the sincerity of the original founders of the Committee for
 a Sane Nuclear Policy and the sincerity of the speakers I have named, it was
 for me an unpleasant duty to have to notify them that the unpublicized chief
 organizer of the Madison Square Garden rally, Henry Ahroms, was a veteran
 member of the Communist Party ; that there was also evidence of serious
 Communist infiltration at chapter level throughout the Committee for a Sane
 Nuclear Policy ; that the Communist Party and its front organizations had done
 their utmost to promote the meeting ; that the Communists provided much of
 the organizing machinery for the meeting because they planned to use it as
 a pressure instrument in support of Soviet nuclear diplomacy.
 This information was confirmed by the Subcommittee on Internal Security
 only several days before the Madison Square Garden meeting was scheduled to
 take place.  Because I wished to be fair to all the decent and prominent people
 who were associated with the meeting as sponsors or as speakers, I had some
 doubt about the advisability of rushing into print with my information only

 48 hours in advance of the rally.  Instead, I decided to comunicate the informa-
 tion, or at least certain essential portions of it, to Mr. Norman Cousins, the
 chairman of the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy.  Mr. Cousins came to
 Washington to see me and we had a long and frank discussion about the problem.
 The directors of the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, it turned out, had
 some inkling of the existence of a Communist infiltration and were extremely
 unhappy about it.  When the Communist affiliation;; of the chief organizer of
 the Madison Square Garden meeting were brought to Mr. Cousins' attention,
 lie immediately suspended the organizer in question.  This was 2 days before
 the meeting.  it is my understaudiiaa that the national committee of the organ-
 ization intends to take some further measures against Communist infiltrators.
 If I have any criticism to make. it is that the directors of the organization
 have moved so slowly to confront the problem and that the measures they
 have taken have been inadequate.  I was, for example, surprised to discover
 that one of the officers of the committee, Mr. Norman Thomas, had, as early as
 last January, expressed serious suspicion about tide individual who later became
 organizer of the Madison Square Garden meeting-but that no action had been
 taken on Mr. Thomas' warning.
 To me it is appalling that the Communists should be able to infiltrate and
 manipulate a movement. founded on sincere humanitarian and pacifist niotiva-
 tions, and headed by so many reputable citizens.  Perhaps this is a situation in
 whieli remedial legislation is indicated, a situation in which private citizens
 must have the assistance of Government to cope effectively with a movement that
 operates by stealth and by secrecy.
 In accordance with the subconunittee's mandate from the Senate, it was
 clear that our duty required that we do everything in our power to get at the
 facts.  In presenting the information Ave have gleaned to the Senate. it is my
 hope that I will lie aisle to do so In a manner chit will avoid injury to the
 innocent and will point the way to a constructive course of action by Govern-
 ment and private organlzations.
 The test ban has for several years now been the chief objective of the Com-
 munist propaganda apparatus.  Of this there is ample documentary evidence.
 In his speech before the mmlaress of the Soviet Communist Party on January
 27, Nikita Khrushchev, in his most militant rhetoric, called for a permanent
 ban on nuclear tests.
 The main political resolution adopted by the 17th congress of the Communist
 Party of the U.S.A.. in February 1tlt'?t) said :
 "The demand that the administration end nuclear testing and ban the II-bomb
 has found a widening response in community meetings, peace talks, petitions,
 and sermons from the pulpit."
 On February 1c, 1960, seven Communists foreign language newspapers took
 a full-page advertisement In the New York Times an-] called on the President-
 "1. To proclaim the achievement of total, universal, and controlled disarma-
 ment as the goal of National U.S. policy.
 "2. To restore the moratorium on the, testing of unclear weapons and to do
 everything In your power to insure early agreement on the banning of all nuclear
 tests.
 "3. To oppose the sharing of nuclear warheads w=th NATO allies."
 The Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy has not solicited the praise of the
 Communist movement, and most of its leaders, I am certain, would be much
 happier if they received no plaudits from Communist Sources.  The fact, never-
 theless, remains that the committee In recent years has been the recipient of
 consistent and generous praise from the Communist press.      The Communist
 organ, New World Review, for April of this year. for example, carried these
 paragraphs under the caption "Peace Groups In the United States":
 "No amount of conspiratorial silence can wipe out the forces for disarma-
 ment and peace, but it can leave them Isolated from each other and ignorant
 of the efforts their fellows are making.
 "It is our purpose to bring to our readers' attention the main groups In our

 Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, and Clarence Pickett, executive secre-
 tary emeritus of the American Friends Service Committee, and with the sponsor-
 ship and support of many noted Americans, SANE provides an elastic organiza-
 tion and comprehensive program through which. ordinary people can be effective.
 "Local committees of SANE exist in many cities, towns, counties, and small
 communities throughout the United States.  Their membership policy is flexible
 and they generally welcome additions to their forces, whether for one particular
 campaign or on a long-term basis."
 Mr. President, to anyone who is familiar with the language of communism,
 the paragraphs I have just quoted constitute a clear directive to members of the
 Communist Party to enter into the ranks of the Committee for a Sane Nuclear
 Policy.  These paragraphs, I might point out, were not the haphazard product of
 a novice or intellectual dilettante.  They were written by the editor of the
 magazine, Jessica Smith, a hardened oldtime Communist.
 As for the Madison  Square Garden meeting, the Communist organ, the
 Worker, in a series of its own advertisements, called upon all the Communists
 faithful to turn out in strength.  The masthead of the Worker for May 15
 carried a banner headline "For Sanity in Foreign Policy-All Out to Madison
 Square Garden, Thursday, 7:45 p.m."
 Given this background, it was only natural to anticipate that the Communists
 would attempt to find their way into the organizing mechanism of the meeting.
 The name of the Communist Party member who served as chief organizer
 of the Madison Square Garden meeting is Henry II. Abrams.  As I have pointed
 out, Mr. Norman Cousins suspended Mr. Abrams several days before the meeting,
 when I brought the matter to his attention.  Until the date of his suspension,
 however, Mr. Abrams devoted virtually full time to the organization of the
 meeting for many weeks.  He did so, moreover, without remuneration.
 On March 16, 1960, Mr. Abrams attended a meeting of the executive committee
 of the Greater New York committee of the National Committee for a Sane
 Nuclear Policy.  Let me read just two sentences from the minutes of that meet-
 ing, which clearly illustrates the central role this Communist agent has played :
 "Dr. Lear reported that Gov. G. Mennen Williams has accepted our invitation
 to speak at Madison Square Garden.  Henry Abrams then gave the rest of the
 Madison Square Garden report."
 Henry Abrams' residence at 11 Riverside Drive, New York City, and his tele-
 phone number of Trafalgar 4-7769, is the address and telephone number used
 by the headquarters of the Upper Manhattan Sane Nuclear Policy Committee.
 Abrams has served as an accountant for both the Upper Manhattan Committee
 and the Greater New York Committee of the National Committee for a Sane
 Nuclear Policy.  From these facts it emerges that his association with the
 Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy was a long and fairly prominent one.
 Now let us look at Henry Abrams' Communist record.
 In 1939, he resided at 972 East 14th Street, Brooklyn, N.Y.  In that year he
 signed a Communist Party nominating petition from that address which ap-
 peared on page 4091 of the election records.
 He was a member of the 11th Assembly District Club of the Communist Party
 which met at 2744 Broadway, New York City.  On Tuesday, February 1.5, 1944,
 it was announced at a meeting of this Communist club that Henry Abrams
 would give a class for Communists on the preparation of income tax forms.
 Henry Abrams was a member of the Young Communist League and later of
 the upper West Side section of the Communist Party of New York City.  Ile has
 been a consistent financial contributor to the Communist Party, U.S.A.
 As recently as September 28, 1958, the official Communist Party newspaper, the
 Worker, printed a letter from Henry Abrams endorsing the candidacy of Ben-
 jamin Davis for State senator in the 21st senatorial district of New York City.
 Benjamin Davis is national secretary of the Communist Party, and is, in fact, one
 of the most notorious of native Communists, a fact which is well known to most
 Americans.  Ile was one of the leading members of the party convicted in the
 famous Foley Square Smith Act trials of a dozen years ago.  He spent several
 years in jail for advocating the overthrow of the U.S. Government by force
 and violence.
 Mr. Abrams has served as an accountant for the American Communist Party,
 for the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, and for the late Congressman
 Vito Marcantonio.
 Abrams has carried out Communist policies in many ostensibly non-Commu-
 nist organizations which have, in fact, served as fronts for the Communist

 Party.  Among the organizations promoted by the Communists in which he
 has played an active role are the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, the
 American Committee for the Protection of the Foreigui Born, the Ilfroshima Com-
 memorative Committee, the National Committee of the American Forum for
 Socialist Education, the American Labor Party, the United Independent Socialist
 Conference Committet_.
 I state all these things its facts, Mr. President.  On Friday, May 13, Henry
 Abrams was given the opportunity to deny them in a hearing of the Senate
 Subcommittee on Internal Security.  He invoked the :lfth amendment in reply to
 all questions regarding his years` long record of service to the Communist con-
 spiracy.
 The obvious and declared purpose of the Madisi ti Square Garden meeting
 was to Influence American policy on the nuclear test ban.  It is one thing when
 American citizens come together, in accordance with their rights, for the pur-
 pose of urging a specific policy on their Government.  It is an altogether differ-
 cut thing when such a meeting is infiltrated by the Communists and when the
 chief organizing role falls into the hands of a member of the Communist Party,
 which, its we all know, is a quisling instrument of Soviet policy.  Such a sit-
 uation has an Important bearing on American security, because it Is axio-
 matic that all actions of the Communist Party are planned to subserve the ends
 of Soviet diplomacy.
 Let me say here, parenthetically. that this is by no means the only occasion of
 Communist machinations In the field of nuclear policy.  At a previous hearing,
 we established that Avrahm G. lfezerik, a man with a long Communist rec-
 ord, actually managed a so-called American Nobel Anniversary Forum and ])in-
 ner, held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City on January 11, 1953,
 which concentrated on the theme of an American ban on nuclear testing.  It was
 brought. out in this hearing that this gathering whsle managed by a Commu-
 nist, was financed by a prominent Amerlcan capitalist, who was unaware of
 Mezerik's Communist record.
 With all this interest In the subject, the Internal Security Subcommittee
 summoned fir. Abrams to appear and testify.  Through his attorney, Leonard
 Bonilla, of New York, Mr. Abranis pleaded illness, and asked to be excused front
 coming to Washington to testify.  We then arranged to hear him in New York
 City.  He showed up with it doctor's certificate that he was suffering from heart
 disease, and moved a further continuance on the ground that his condition
 was so serious that being questioned might cause him serious harm.  Since the
 committee was aware that fir. Abrams had continued right up to that day to
 carry a heavy load as the man In active charge of arrangements for the May 19
 meeting at Madison Square Garden, we were not impressed by these claims.
 We had a New York City Public Health Service doctor present, and asked
 Mr. Abrams if lie would consent to be examined then and there.  Ile refused,
 so we denied the request for a continuance and went ahead with the hearing,
 which was in executive session.
 As I have indicated the hearing had been called in the hope that we could
 learn from Mr. Abrams the full story of Communist infiltration of and partici-
 pation In this movement for it nuclear test ban, as a basis for determining what,
 if any, legislation may be indicated In this area.
 The subcommittee has received evidence, much of it still of a classified na-
 ture, that Henry Abrams is not a lone Infiltrator, that there exists in fact a
 serious Communist Infiltration in the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy.
 What, specifically, are the Communists attempting to achieve by their in-
 filtration of the test ban movement, including their recent all-out support of
 the Madison Square Garden meeting?  The answer to this is, I believe, obvious.
 The Communist purpose in supporting the test ban agitation and in going all
 out to make the .Madison Square Garden meeting a success is to exert pressure on
 the administration to make still further concessions to the Soviet viewpoint in
 order to arrive at a test bail agreement; to create a climate of public opinion
 which will make it Impossible for the administration to resume small under-
 ground tests, even though there may be every reason to believe that the Kremlin
 is conducting such tests; to enervate the free world s- that it becomes incapable
 of responding with appropriate measures to challenges at Berlin and at other
 points.
 In the test ban negotiations that are now going on there are major differ-
 ences between the Soviet position and our own.  These differences hinge around
 the question of inspection.  In my own opinion, we have already conceded too

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 much, especially by agreeing in principle to a further voluntary moratorium on
 undetectable underground tests.  But for those tests that are subject to detec-
 tion, we still take the stand that here should be an inspection system based on
 an adequate number of fixed stations, with at least 20 or 30 onsite inspections
 per annum.  The Kremlin wants a minimum of inspection.  It wants as few
 stations as possible, and its spokesmen have indicated that they would not be
 willing to accept more than a few onsite inspections per annum.
 The Kremlin apparently attached major importance to the Madison Square
 Garden meeting as a pressure operation in support of its nuclear objectives.
 This, I believe, is conclusively demonstrated by the generous and sympathetic
 coverage of the meeting in the Soviet press.  I think this is interesting.  Ac-
 cording to an AP dispatch of May 21st, Pravda headlined its account of the
 meeting with the words "We Want To Live in Friendship With the Soviet
 Union," while the Izvestia headline read "Rebuff to Advocates of War."
 I believe that the heads of the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy have a
 serious contribution to make to the great debate on national policy.  But they
 can only make this contribution effectively if they purge their ranks ruthlessly
 of Communist infiltration and if they clearly demarcate their own position from
 that of the Communists, first, by stressing the need for adequate inspection, sec-
 ond, by reiterating at every opportunity their opposition to the tyranny of
 communism
 On the basis of the evidence that has come to me, I do not believe that the
 Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy has taken the necessary measures to cre-
 ate a climate that is inhospitable to Communist infiltration.  At the Madison
 Square Garden rally, for example, there was much direct and inferential criti-
 cism of American policy, but, according to the press accounts and reports from
 private sources-persons who were present at the meeting-there was almost no
 criticism of Khrushchev or of his arrogant, insulting, gutter-level behavior in
 Paris.  On the contrary, the speakers called for an immediate effort to renew
 the summit conference.
 Let me digress briefly for a comment on this last proposal, which has, un-
 fortunately, not been confined to the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy.
 Perhaps I am old-fashioned, but to me it seems that after the President of the
 United States has had to endure a barrage of the crudest insults ever leveled
 at ia head of state, a petition to Khrushchev for another summit meeting would
 constitute a total abandonment of national dignity.  The only conceivable politi-
 cal consequences of so craven an action would be to encourage Khrushchev to
 further arrogance and further demands.
 As I have said, I have found no serious evidence that the Madison Square
 Garden meeting was organized and conducted in a. manner which would have
 discouraged Communist participation.  It was not surprising, therefore, that
 the Communists and their sympathizers turned out in force.  Although no
 Gallup poll or breakdown was possible, I am convinced from reports that the
 Communists were responsible for a very substantial percentage of the overflow
 turnout.  A number of well-known Communists, including Alexander Trachten-
 berg, a top party member, were observed in the audience. Outside the meeting,
 the Communists brazenly distributed literature in their own name.
 If decent organizations like the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy wish to
 protect themselves against the danger of Communist infiltration, I cannot em-
 phasize too strongly the need for an organizational climate that is openly
 inhospitable to Communists.  This is a situation where a tepid declaration of
 devotion to democracy simply will not suffice, while a neutral silence is an open
 invitation to disaster.
 I can think of other things that can and should be done by the directors of
 the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy and of other non-Communist organi-
 zations which must contend with the problem. of Communist infiltration.  At
 top level, control is relatively easy.  One can more or less assume that the
 people who are elected to a board of directors or to a national committee have
 enjoyed public visibility over a period of years so that their records are known.
 At the local level, not even the FBI with all of its resources could offer a 100
 percent guarantee against infiltration.  However, I think it is possible for
 organizations to exercise a good deal of control by carefully examining the
 personal records and bona fides, first, of all those who volunteer to help estab-
 lish local organizations; second, of those who are elected to office in local
 organizations; third, of all those assigned to organizing activities.

 If any effort had been made to do these things, the Madison Square Garden
 situation might have been avoided.  But for 2:; yearn, Henry Abrams has been
 a Communist.  Without looking up his record, the Committee for a Sane Nuclear
 Policy allowed him to become the chief organizer of the rally in New York City.
 That was not taking the necessary precautionary measures.
 I think it is not too much t"i ask that all such eoainittees, which are headed
 by good people and made tip of thousands of good people, ought to give considera-
 tion to the question whether Communists like Abran.s are taking a part in the
 running of their meetings.  Many of these committees have been doing good
 work.  But it is little wonder that they become infiltrated by Communists if
 they do not take Ibe pains and the time to ascertain who some of their people
 are, before they allow them to become officers or chief organizers of mass rallies.
 I believe it Is not too much to ask our fellow citizens who are organizing
 committees for tile. purpose of exerting influence on Congress --as they have
 every right to do--to make a preliminary, cursory clus?k of the persons who are
 working in their organizations, especially before they hold such meetings.
 This would not be an easy task.  But there is much that can be clone.  It will
 not always be possible to obtain accurate personal Information, because many
 Communists operate underground as secret party members.  But in the case of
 a man like Abrams, who has a public record of membership, the facts should
 be available without too much effort.
 Perhaps this is a situation in which private organizations can in some way be
 assisted by Government.  This is a problem that the Subcommittee on Internal
 Security Is at present exploring.
 Mr. President, in closing my remarks, I wish to pay my personal tribute to
 Mr. Norman Cousins, the chairman of the Committee for it sane Nuclear Policy,
 for the manner in which he has reacted to the revelations of the subcommittee.
 fir. Cousins has been a neighbor and a friend of mina for ninny years.  I have
 the highest regard for him.  That is why I called him up and told him what I
 knew about Abrams.  He was good enough to come to Washington to sec me.
 I said, "I don't want to release this material 24 hours before your meeting.
 You have your plans all made.  But many innocent 14'ople will be present, and
 a number of them will be prominent people.  Why lu ven't you checked on peo-
 ple like Abrams?  Norman Thomas sold in January that he was doubtful about
 the man's ba"kground.  Here it is the middle of May. on the eve of your meet-
 ing, and you have not yet done anything."
 lir. Cousins was upset about the matter.  Ile immediately suspended Abrams.
 Not only did he do this. but he told me he was glad we had informed him about
 Abrams.  He offered to open the hooks of his orgnniz ition to the subcommittee
 and to cooperate In every way to rid his organization of Communists.
 I assure Mr. Cousins and other persons connected with his committee that the
 Subcommittee on Internal Security is ready to cooperate with them to help to
 prevent a repetition of the Madison Square Garden situation.
 I think it is not too much to say that the subcommittee is desirous and willing
 to help any other organiratlon to avoid infiltration by subterranean elements
 who are not there for any good purpose, and who are certainly not interested,
 as are the good people who make up the bulk of their membership, in the welfare
 of the United States.
 I yield the floor.
 (Whereupon, tit 1:10 p.m., the committee adjourned.)

 BACKGROUND DOCUMENTS      EVENTS
 INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 1. PREMIER KHRUSHCHEV'S REMARKS ON U.S. PLANE
 [From the New York Times, May 6, 19601
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) -Following, in translation, are excerpts
 from the section of Premier Khrushchev's address today referring to
 the shooting down of a United States plane Sunday, as broadcast from
 .Moscow:
 On instructions of the Soviet Government, I am duty bound to
 report to you on aggressive acts directed in the last few weeks by the
 United States of America against the Soviet Union.
 What form did these aggressive acts take?  The United States
 sent its planes, which violated our state frontier and intruded into
 the airspace of the Soviet Union.
 Its last but one aggressive act was perpetrated by the United States
 of America on April 9,1960.
 A United States plane intruded into the airspace of our country
 from the Afghanistan side.  Of course, no man. in his right senses
 can think and assume that this violation was done by Afghanistan,
 a country which is friendly with us.
 We are convinced that this plane belonged to the United States of
 America and obviously was based somewhere on the territory of
 Turkey, Iran or Pakistan, which are linked with the U.S.A. by obli-
 gations under the aggressive CENTO bloc.
 [Mr. Khrushchev said the Soviet Government decided against mak-
 ing aprotest but ordered military commanders to act if another plane
 intruded.]
 American military men apparently liked this impunity as it hap-
 pened on April 9, and they decided to repeat the aggressive act.
 INCIDENT ON MAY DAY
 Selected for this was the most festive day for our people and the
 workers of the world-the day of May the First-the international
 holiday of fraternal solidarity of the working class.
 That day, early in the morning, at 0536 hours, Moscow time, an
 American plane flew over our frontier and continued its flight into the
 interior of the Soviet land.  A report on this aggressive act was im-
 mediately given to the Government by the Minister of Defense.

 The Government had stated this: Since he realizes what he, comes
 withgit ho wills attempt fre hinto
 provocations. Tl etefor'e, if lie  ets away
 the plane mu t
 be shot down.
 This task was fulfilled and the plane was shot down.
 According to first information, it has transpired that the plane
 belongs to the United States of America although it bears no identifi-
 cation signs.
 Now an expert commission is studying data that fell in our hands.
 It has been established that this plane that crossed the state frontier
 of the Soviet Union was coming either from Turkey, Iran or Pakistan.
 After the study of all materials that are now at our disposal, the
 Soviet Government will lodge with the United States of America a
 strong protest and will warn it that if similar aggressive acts against
 our country continue, we reserve the right to respond to them with
 measures we shall find necessary in order to insure the safety of our
 country.
 We shall also give the most serious warning to those countries that
 put their territories at the disposal of the United States of America
 for aggressive acts directed against our country.
 The following conclusion comes to mind: Aggressive imperialist
 forces in the United States in recent times have been taking the most
 active measures to undermine the summit or at least to hinder any
 agreement that might be reached.
 4" Wire SENT THIS AIkCJL }"r?"
 The question then arises: Who sent this aircraft across the Soviet
 frontier? Was it the man who is Commander in Chief of the American
 armed forces who, as everyone knows, is the President? Or was this
 aggressive act carried out by Pentagon militarists?  If such actions
 -are taken by American military men on their own account, it must
 be of especial concern to world opinion.
 Perhaps it was a result of the friendship that is now forming be-
 tween the United States and Franco that the American militarists
 decided to act independently, as did the Spanish military junta, which
 rose up against the legal Spanish Government.
 Thus, in the so-called free world, military dictators not seldom set.
 up their regimes using the methods of Frum'o.  But the peoples are
 beginning to understand where true freedom is and where there is
 tyranny.
 Take, for instance, the events in South Korea.  The head of the
 puppet Syagman Rhee regime, the best friend of the United States
 and the father of his country as someone or other called him in Anier-
 ice, has now been overthrown by the people and is now a political
 corpse. And it was not the Communists who were behind these events;
 even American pohiticial leaders have had to admit.
 The sufferings of the Korean people led theca to rise up against the
 bestial yoke, and the peoples understand Clint it was not only a question
 of Syngmaan Rhee himself who was to blame but all those who sup-
 ported him and hung hini round the necks of the South Koreans.
 It is no coincidence that the free world sees so many popular demon-
 strations demanding freedom.

 EVENTS IN
 Comrade Deputies, the impression is being formed that the aggres-
 sive actions newly undertaken by the United States against the Soviet
 Union are a foretaste of the summit meeting.
 Are they taken in order to exert pressure on us and to attempt to
 frighten us with their military superiority in order to undermine our
 determination to work for easing tension, to eliminate the cold war
 and to put an end to the arms race
 All these missions are sent in order to prevent any agreement on
 vexing questions, for we cannot say that this aircraft was a harbinger
 of peace, that it was on a goodwill mission.  No, it was a real bandit
 flight with aggressive intentions.
 We can say to those gentlemen who sent the aircraft that if they
 think they can bend our knees and our backs by means of such pres-
 sure, this will have no effect on us.  The Soviet Union has every means
 to give a rebuff to those who want to exert pressure in order to achieve
 a solution convenient to aggressors.
 In the name of the Soviet Government let me express thanks to the
 men of the military units who carried out with honor the task laid on
 them in defending the frontiers of our motherland.
 Comrades, the Soviet people and Government have always expressed
 their peaceful intentions and friendly feelings toward the United
 States, but in answer to this we have black ingratitude.
 "PEELINGS OF INDIGNATION"
 It is understood that this has aroused feelings of indignation against
 the activities of the American military men.  But we must control this
 feeling and must be ruled not by our emotions, but by reason.
 Government leaders interested in preserving peace must soberly con-
 sider the consequences of such actions and think what they might
 lead to.
 Hitler's aircraft before the war used to intrude into our airspace.
 The Soviet Government would protest, but Hitler refused to pay at-
 tention and then attacked us.  And where did that all end?
 How do we assess the incursion of American aircraft-as a precursor
 of war or a foreshadow of attack, of the repetition of what Hitler
 did?   The Soviet Government thinks that all the same there is no
 reason to draw such conclusions.
 There is another relationship of power in the world, and in this the
 people's will to peace plays a great part and this is why we do not con-
 clude that this is a prewar trial of strength or a reconnaissance made
 to try our nerves, preserve the atmosphere of the cold war so that the
 imperialists can continue to bind their people with taxation, to carry
 on the arms race, and to keep their people in a state of fear of war and
 to continue to impose their will.
 The Soviet Union has no aggressive intentions, we do not want the
 cold war, we want disarmament and our proposals made to the United
 Nations on this subject remain in force still.  Once a ain, we repeat
 that disarmament is the right way to preserve peace and in such condi-
 tions no country would be able unilaterally to arm and attack another.
 The Soviet Government once again calls on the Government of the
 United States to end the cold war.  All states must act peaceably so
 that calm, peace and happiness can prevail.

 4. NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRA-
 TION NEWS RELEASE, MAY 5, 1960
 [NASA Release No. C0-193]
 Memo to the Press :
 One of NASA's U-2 research airplanes, in use since 1956 in a
 continuing program to study gust-meteorological conditions found
 at high altitude, has been missing since about 9 o'clock Sunday morn-
 ing (local time), when its pilot reported he was having oxygen diffi-
 culties over the Lake Van, Turkey, area.
 The airplane had taken off from Incirlik Air Base, Turkey.  The
 flight plan called for the first check point to be at 37 degrees, 25
 minutes, North : 41 degrees, 23 minutes, East, and for a left turn to be
 made to the Lake Van beacon, thence to the Trabazon beacon, thence
 to Antalya, and return to Adana. The flight scheduled was estimated
 at 3 hours, 45 minutes, for a total of 1,400 nautical miles. Takeoff
 was at 8 a.m local time.
 (The above-given times are the equivalent of 3 a.m. Sunday, and
 2 a.m., eastern daylight time.)
 About 1 hour after takeoff, the pilot reported difficulties with his
 oxygen equipment.  Using emergency radio frequency, he reported he
 was heading for the Lake Van %eacon to get his bearings, and that
 he would return to Adana.
 As indicated above, his flight plan called for him to make a left turn
 at the Lake Van beacon.  His last report indicated he was attempting
 to receive that beacon. It is believed he probably was on a north-
 easterly course, but there was no further word.
 An aerial search was begun soon after receipt of the last communi-
 cation. The Lake Van area is mountainous and very rugged.  No
 evidence has been sighted of the aircraft having crashed.
 If the pilot continued to suffer lack of oxygen, the path of the air-
 plane from the last reported position would he impossible to de-
 termine.  If the airplane was on automatic pilot, it is likely it would
 have continued along its northeasterly course.
 The pilot, as are all pilots used on NASA's program of upper at-
 mosphere research with the U-2 airplane, is a civilian employed by
 the Lockheed Aircraft Corp., builders of the airplane.
 When the research program was begun in 1956 by the National
 Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (predecessor to NASA), the
 Federal agency did not have a sufficient number of pilots to operate
 the program, and so a contract was made with Lockheed to provide
 the pilots.
 Overseas logistic support for NASA's continuin  use of the U-2 is
 provided by Air Weather Service units of the USAF.
 NASA has procured a total of 10 U-2 airplanes.  The airplane
 was originally built as a private venture by I.ocklieed to serve as a
 "flying test bed."  It is powered by a single Pratt & Whitney J-57
 turbojet. engine, and can maintain flight for as long as 4 hours at
 altitudes of up to 55,000 feet..
 Since inception of the research program in 1956, the U-2 flying
 weather laboratories have operated from bases in California, New
 York, Alaska, England, Germany, Turkey, Pakistan, Japan, Okinawa,
 and the Philippines.

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFEREN
 The U-2 airplanes are presently being used in California (Ed-
 wards AFB, one), Japan (Atsugi, three) and Turkey (Adana, four).
 The instrumentation carried by the U-2 permits obtaining more
 precise information about clear air turbulence, convective clouds,
 wind shear, the jet stream, and such widespread weather patterns as
 typhoons.  The airplane also has been used by NASA to obtain
 information about cosmic rays, and the concentration of certain ele-
 ments in the atmosphere, including ozone and water vapor.
 Instrumentation carried includes : Angular velocity recorder, to
 measure the airpla.ne's rate of pitch ; modified VGII recorder, to
 measure and record head-on gust components in flight; flight recorder
 Model BB, continuous recorder of indicated airspeed, pressure alti-
 tude and normal acceleration ; airspeed and altitude transducer to
 measure pressure altitude and indicated airspeed; temperature and
 humidity measuring set AN/AMQ 7, to measure indicated free air
 temperature and indicated relative humidity; and vortex thermometer
 system, to measure true free-air temperature within one-half degree
 centigrade at high speeds.

 [No. 249]
 The following is the text of a note delivered today by the American
 Embassy at Moscow to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign A ff airs :
 The Embassy of the United States of America by instruction of its
 Government has the honor to state the following :
 The United States Government has noted the statement of the Chair-
 man of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Re-
 publics, N. S. Khrushchev, in his speech before the Supreme Soviet
 on May 5 that a foreign aircraft crossed the border of the Soviet Union
 on May 1 and that on orders of the Soviet Government, this aircraft
 was shot down. In this same statement it was said that investigation
 showed that it was a United States plane.
 As already announced on May 3, a United States National Aeronau-
 tical Space Agency unarmed weather research plane based at Adana,
 Turkey, and piloted by a civilian American has been missing since May
 1. The name of the American civilian pilot is Francis Gary Powers,
 born on August 17,     at Jenkins, Kentucky.
 In the light of the above the United States Government requests the
 Soviet Government to provide it with full facts of the Soviet investi-
 gation of this incident and to inform it of the fate of the pilot.

 E, T   INCIDENT TO TILE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 Soviet people.                     Numerous inquiries and appeals are being received
 by the session and the Soviet Government. In view of this permit me
 to dwell on this question once again and to furnish certain new data.
 After nl~ report. to the Supreme, Soviet, in which I dwelt on this
 fact, the United States Department of State claimed in an official
 press statement that the point in question was a violation of the Soviet
 State Frontier by an American aircraft of (lie "Lockheed U-2" type,
 which allegedly was studying weather conditions in the upper layers
 of the atmosphere in thearea of the Turkish-Soviet frontier.
 This piano had allegedly strayed off its course because the pilot had
 oxygen trouble.  The State Department asserts that the pilot lost
 consciousness and, steered by its automatic pilot, the plane flew into
 Soviet territory. According to the Department of State, the pilot
 only had time to report back about the failure of his oxygen equip-
 ment to the Turkish airdrome in Adana, whence it flew, an airdrome
 which allegedly does not belong to the military but to the National
 Aeronautics and Space Research Administration.
 Soon after that, the National Aeronautics and Space Research
 Administration issued a, statement with it view to confirming the State
 Department's version.
 "MANY SILLY TIHINGS'
 Comrades. I must tell you a secret. Mien I was making my report
 I deliberately did not say'
 ay that. the pilot, was alive and in good health
 and that we have got. parts of the plane. We did so deliberately be-
 cause had we told everything at once, the Americans would have
 invented another version.
 And nowt just look how many silly things they have said-Van
 Lake, scientific research and so on and so forth. Now that they know
 that the pilot, is alive they will have to invert something else and they
 will do it.
 [Mr. Khrushchev read from the United States statement issued
 after his first announcement ; it was printed in the New York Times
 last Friday.]
 These are the official versions put into circulation by American
 officials to mislead the public opinion of their country and the world.
 I must declare, comrade Deputies, that these versions are completely
 untrue and calculated for gullible people.
 The authors of these versions supposed that if the plane was shot
 down, the pilot most probably perished too.  So there will be nobody
 to ask how everything actually happened, there will be no way to
 check what sort of plane it was and what instruments it carried.
 ((ALIVE AND IN GOOD ]II:ALTII"
 First of all, I wish to announce that the pilot of the shot-down
 American plane is alive and in good health.  Ile is now in Moscow.
 Brought here also are the remains of this plane and its special instru-
 mentation, discovered during the investigation.
 The name of this pilot is Francis Gary Powers.  Ile is 30 years old.
 Ile says he is a first, lieutenant of the United States Air Force, where
 he served till 1956, that is, to (lie day when he went over to file Central
 Intelligence Agency.

 EVENTS INCIDENT To
 Francis Powers reported, incidentally, that while serving with the
 American Air Force he used to get $700 a month, but when he went
 over to the intelligence service and started carrying out spying as-
 signments to glean secret information, he began getting $2,500 a
 month. That is how capital buys lives, buys people.  The flier testi-
 fied that he had no dizziness, nor had his oxygen apparatus failed.
 He was flying along the assigned course, accurately executing his
 chief's orders, switching on and off the equipment over the pre-
 selected targets for gleaning intelligence on the Soviet Union's mili-
 tary and industrial establishments, and flew on until the very mo-
 ment his piratical flight into this country's interior was cut short.
 I want to tell something about the results of the examination
 of the plane that has been shot down and its equipment, as well as of
 the questioning of the pilot.  The inquiry still continues, but the pic-
 ture is fairly clear already.
 PLANE TYPE CONFIRMED
 To start with, this was, indeed, a high-altitude, low-speed "Lock-
 heed U-2."  They banked on its high altitude and believed that this
 piano cannot be brought down by any fighter or antiaircraft artil-
 lery.  That is why they thought it could fly over Soviet territory with
 immunity. In fact, the plane flew at a great altitude and it was hit
 by the rocket at an altitude of 20,000 meters [65,000 feet].  And if
 they fly higher, we will also hit them !  The, plane was in no way
 equipped for "upper atmosphere research" or for taking "air sam-
 ples," as official. American. spokesmen assert.
 Not at all.  This was a real military reconnaissance aircraft fitted
 with various instruments for collecting intelligence and, among other
 things, for aerial photography.
 The competent commission of experts, which examined the wrecked
 plane, has established from the documentary evidence that this Amer-
 ican plane is a specially prepared reconnaissance aircraft.  The task
 of the plane was to cross the entire territory of the Sovi Union from
 coun-
 try's Pamirs to the Kola Peninsula to got
 try's military and industrial establishments by means of aerial photog-
 raphy. Besides aerial cameras the plane carried other reconnaissance
 equipment for spotting radar networks, identifying the location and
 frequencies of operating radio stations and other special radio en-
 gineering equipment.
 }             Not only do we have the equipment of that plane, but we also have
 the developed film showing a number of areas of our territory. Here
 are some of these photos.  Here are photos of these airfields.  Here
 are two white lines. They are lines of our fighters. Here is another
 airfield and also planes on it. All these films we developed ourselves.
 CAMERA IS PRAISED
 Here are photos of petrol stores. It must be said that the camera
 is not a bad one and the photo is very accurate.
 But I must say that our cameras take better pictures, are more
 accurate, so that we gained little in this respect.
 These photos here show industrial enterprises.

 CONFERENCE
 There is also a tape recording of the signals of a number of our
 ground radar stations. These are ileontestible evidence of the spying
 done by the American plane shot. down in the vicinity of Sverdlovsk.
 That is what "`air samples" American reconnaissance took, and it took
 them not over Van Lake in Turkey but quite elsewhere.
 The only thing that, is true is that this plane was stationed at the
 American-Turkish air base at Incirlik east of Adana. As Powers, the
 flier, testified, he was serving with the 10-10 unit, which, for the sake
 of disguise, is under control of the National Aeronautics and Space
 Administration, but in reality, conducts high-altitude military recon-
 naissance.
 In his depositions, Powers mentioned the names of several officers
 he had served with at the American military base in Turkey. Ac-
 cording to Powers' testimony, the commander of the American 10-10
 unit is Col. William Shelton and his deputy is Lieut. Col. Carol Funk.
 Before his flight, Powers had long trained himself for flying into
 the depth of this country and, as he said himself, he had flown along
 the Soviet frontier many tines in order t  study the radar system
 of the Soviet Union.
 ``PO6vI:ns, TILE SCOUT"
 On April 27, Powen,, the scout, flew over from the Turkish city
 of Adana to the Peshawar airfield in Pakistan on orders from his
 superiors. And it was, therefore, from Pakistan's territory, that is.
 front the Peshawar airfield-and not from the Turkish airfield outside
 Adana, as stated in the United States State. Department's version-
 that Powers took off on May 1 with instruction to fly along the course
 indicated on his ma  over the Aral Sea, Sverdlovsk and other points
 and reach Archangel and Murmansk, before landing at the Bude air-
 field in Norway.
 Now we can say where he was flying to. I must admit that we knew
 it already when I was reporting this fact. We did not say anything
 at that time in order to see what the Americans would invent.  Now
 that they have made their invention, we report how everything actually
 happened.
 This is what Powers said when questioned about the task of his flight
 over Soviet territory.
 "I was to take off from the Peshawar airfield in Pakistan, cross the
 national frontier of the U.S.S.R. and fly across Soviet territory to
 Norway.  I was to fly over certain points of the U.S.S.R., of which I
 remember Murmansk and Archangel.  During my flight over Soviet
 territory I was to switch on and off the equipment over certain points
 indicated on the map.  I believe my flight over Soviet territory was
 meant for collecting information on Soviet guided missiles and radar
 stations."
 I want to ask the gentlemen from the State Department: Is it such
 "air samples over Lake Van" that the spy flier Powers was to take?
 IRAQI REVOLT RECALLED
 I say nothing of the fact that by flying along this course, the Ameri-
 can scout, plane grossly violated the national sovereignty of Afghan-

 Approved Fo1q6            50011 (001-1
 i stan by having flown across that country's territory without permis-
 sion.  But there is, perhaps, nothing extraordinary in this for the
 morals of American militarists. Such actions of theirs have long been
 known.
 Suffice it to recall the flight of American military aircraft over the
 territory of Austria, when the aggression was being prepared against
 Iraq, where a revolution had just taken place.  The Austrian Govern-
 ment protested against the treacherous violation of Austria's sover-
 eignty by American military aircraft and against that blatant act of
 disrespect for her neutrality sealed by the signatures of the United
 States, among others.
 If one believes the version that the pilot lost consciousness owing to
 oxygen trouble and that the aircraft was subsequently controlled by
 the automatic pilot, one must also believe that the aircraft controlled
 by an automatic pilot flew from Turkey to Pakistan, touched down at
 Peshewar Airport, stayed there three days, took off early in the
 morning of May 1, flew over the territory of Afghanistan, crossed the
 Soviet frontier, flew more than 2,000 kilometers over our territory for
 a total of some four hours.
 All the time of the flight over our territory the aircraft was under
 observation and was brought down as soon as the order was received.
 When our anti-aircraft rocket battery intercepted and brought down
 the plane, the pilot, it must be believed, soon regained his conscious-
 ness because he bailed out by parachute; you just note he was not
 ejected by the automatic device but left through the upper canopy
 designed for emplaning.  The question arises why did he do this if
 there are devices for rapid ejection?
 He did this possibly because there was an explosive charge in the
 aircraft which was to have blown up the plane as soon as the pilot was
 ejected. The pilot knew this and possibly was afraid that he would be
 killed in the explosion. Clever enough !
 But the installation of the infernal machine was not the only pre-
 caution taken.  To cover up the tracks of the crime the pilot was told
 that he must not fall alive in the hands of the Soviet authorities. For
 this reason he was supplied with a special pin.  He was to have pricked
 himself with this poisoned pin, resulting in instantaneous death.
 What a barbarism ! Here is this instrument-the latest achievement
 of American technology for the killing of their own people (a photo-
 graph is produced).
 But everything alive wants to live and when the plane was brought
 down the pilot bailed out by parachute. And when he landed he did
 not follow the advice of those who sent him on his anti-Soviet preda-
 tory assignment but remained alive.
 It is alleged that the flight was made for scientific purposes to in-
 vestigate the upper layers of the atmosphere. The question arises why
 the pilot then had to be armed with a noiseless pistol. He was given
 it for some emergency, not to take air samples but to blow people's
 brains out. All this we shall present to the public as material evidence.
 This is what, so to say, such Christians are like.

 Ile was given this pistol after making low bows as they do in
 churches. end yet they call us godless atheists. Yet. we have never
 committed such crimes against humanity and never will. If the pilot
 was given a pistol to defend himself against wild beasts in case of a
 forced landing, the question arises, why a pistol with a silencer? This
 also shows what so-called scientific purposes were pursued by the
 plane.
 The pilot who was supposed to explore the atmosphere was given
 7,500 rubles in Soviet currency. `Ilse question arises, when and
 where was he to have spent them and for what purposes, for he did
 not fly to exchange old rubles for new ?
 GOLD FR.LNCS, (;OLD RINGS
 The pilot was also given French gold francs.  I have seen these gold
 francs with my own eyes.  And you can see theme here in the photo-
 graph.  They are covered with cello Shane on both sides of the coins.
 one in a cultured, Anierican way.  But what did the pilot need these
 francs for?  Ile also had %Vest Oernian, Italian, and other currency.
 Besides his own watch he was also given for his trip another two gold
 watches and seven gold rings for ladies.  Why was all this necessary
 in the upper layers of the atmosphere?    Or, maybe, the pilot was to
 have, flown still higher to Mars and was going to lead astray Martian
 ladies?
 You see how thoroughly Ai eric-an pilots are equipped before setting
 oil' on a flight, to take samples of air in the upper layers of the atmos-
 phere.  Thus, no concocted version can save the reputation of those
 who bear the responsibility for this perfidious act,
 Thus, no concocted version can save the reputation of those who bear

 Paris, not long before the visit to the Soviet Union of the President of
 the United States.  I believe that this is a bad preparation for.serious
 talks on easing international tension.

 and there are some people who accuse us, Khrushcliev, of wanting to
 undermine the summit meeting because otherwise he would not have
 presented this fact at the session of the Supreme Soviet but raised it
 through some other channels but. what slid you expect., gentlemen?
 You are accustomed to make mischief and some people regard this as
 all but a good thing and keep silent..  No, we are not such kind of
 people: if you made mischief bear the responsibility for this openly.
 They live according to the law; if one is rich one will not be im ris-
 oned.  This is true for the capitalist because lie, always can buy him-
 self off. But there is another country, the country of socialism, where
 law protects the state, protects society, protects everyone living in Ibis
 state,

 What could be the reason for such a reckless step?  This was evi-
 dently done because someone in the United States was obsessed by the
 idea of intelligence.  The United States proposal on the "open sky" is
 well known.  We rejected this proposal and the American military
 then decided to "open" the Soviet sky by themselves.
 But there are rules of international laws, there are national frontiers
 and no one has the right to disregard these laws and to cross the
 frontiers of other countries.
 From the lofty rostrum of the Supreme Soviet we warn once, again
 those countries that make their territory available for the take-off gentlemen!
 planes with anti-Soviet, intentions-do not play with fire, e t
 The governments of the three countries-Turkey, Pakistan and
 Norway-must be clearly aware that they were accomplices of this
 flight because they permitted the use of their airfields against the
 Soviet Union.
 7. STATEMENT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
 MAY 7, 1960
 [Prom The New York Times, May 8, 19601
 WASHINGTON, May 7.   Following is the statement on the U--
 plane incident issued by the State Department today after clearance
 by President Eisenhower:
 The Department has received the text of Mr. Khrushchev's further
 remarks about the unarmed plane which is reported to have been shot
 down in the Soviet Union. As previously announced, it was known
 that a U-2 plane was missing.  As a result of the inquiry ordered by
 the President, it has been established that insofar as the authorities
 are concerned, there was no authorization for any such flights as de-
 scribed by Mr. Khrushchev.
 Nevertheless, it appears that in endeavoring to obtain information,
 now concealed behind the Iron Curtain a flight over Soviet territory
 was probably undertaken by an unarmed civilian U-2 plane.
 It is certainly no secret that, given the state of the world today,
 intelligence collection activities are practiced by all countries and
 postwar history certainly reveals that the Soviet Union has not been
 lagging behind in the field.  The necessity for such activities as
 measures for legitimate national defense is enhanced by the excessive
 secrecy practiced by the Soviet Union in contrast to the free world.
 One of the things creating tension in the world today is apprehen-
 sion over surprise attack with weapons of mass destruction.  To re-
 duce mutual suspicion and to get a measure of protection against
 surprise attack, the United States in 1955 offered its "open skies"
 proposal-a proposal which was rejected out of hand by the Soviet
 Union.  It is in relation to the danger of surprise attack that planes
 of the type of the unarmed civilian U-2 aircraft have made flights
 along the frontiers of the free world for the past four years.

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO TILE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 8. TEXT OF PREMIER KHRUSHCHEV'S SPEECH WARN-
 ING NATIONS WITH BASES USED BY U.S. PLANES
 [From the New York Times, May 10, 1960]
 Following is the text of remarks by Premier Khrushchev at a re-
 ce, tion in the Czechoslovak L,'rnzba.3sy in Moscow yesterday, as pro-
 vided in English in New York by Vass, the official press agency:
 Dear Comrade Dvorak, Ambassador of friendly, fraternal Czecho-
 Slovakia !
 Dear friends, comrades, gentlemen !
 11'e are very pleased to attend the reception held on the occasion of
 the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of the Czechoslovak Repub-
 lic, the celebration of Victory Day, which indeed is a holiday for all the
 peoples.  The Soviet people, at. one with all other peoples, sincerely
 want that there should be no more war, that this war should be the last,
 that it should be reniembered by the peoples and should go down in
 history as the last war.
 We are doing our utmost to achieve this indeed. That is precisely
 why the Soviet Union submitted at the United Nations its proposals
 for general and complete disarmament.. We not only insist on the
 necessity of reducing armed forces but already now, without waiting
 for such decisions by the W 'estern countries, we unilaterally cut the
 armed forces of the Soviet Union by one-third.
 When we have reduced our armed forces to 2,400,000, some time will
 pass, and we shall think it over and evidently we shall further reduce
 our Arm'.  Comrade Zhadov [Gen. Aleksandr A. Zhadov, deputy
 commander of Soviet ground forces] over there scratched the back of
 his head-another reduction.
 No, this will not be done now, Comrade General, but later.
 We shall do this if the situation favors such measures. Of course,
 we shall not cut our armed forces to such a level which would prej-
 udice the security of the Soviet Union. You should bear in mind that
 we do not reduce our armed forces for fuaancial reasons. No, the
 financial situation of our state is splendid and, if need be, could not
 only forbear from reducing the army and navy, but increase them. I
 repeat, if this were necessary we could do this without tense efforts.
 But as good masters we say: Why have bigger armed forces than we
 need?
 CONTROLS NOT FESRED
 If our partners agree we are willing to accept total disarmament
 and we shall effect it honestly. We are not afraid of control. If you
 please, gentlemen, then you could fly over our territory, check, take
 pictures, do what you please.
 Such an issue as now could not arise then. The Department of
 State explains the incident with the downed reconnaissance plane
 more or less as follows: One cannot, the' say, admit, nor can one
 deny. It turns out, as in the well-known Joke, that here is a maiden
 who is also not a maiden for she has a chid' The marriage was not
 registered, therefore one can regard her as a maiden in a way. But
 she gave birth, to a child. Can one regard her as a maiden or not?
 This does not happen in real life.  We tell file Americans: Your
 plane flew over our country on an intelligence mission. We tracked its

 flight and it flew to the Sverdlovsk area, where it was brought down.
 That is how you got into a mess and you are in a mess. Pluck up
 your courage and say : Yes, there was such a disgraceful fact. And
 this is a big disgrace for America since everyone sees now how dis-
 graced in the eyes of the world are those who committeed such a
 shocking act of aggression. The whole world wants peace, a relaxa-
 tion of international tension while certain quarters in the United
 States stage such a provocation..
 What were the purposes of this flight? A provocation! This is
 bad, very bad indeed !
 TIMING FOR SUMMIT SEEN
 I have already said, comrades, and now I repeat, that this was done
 deliberately and deliberately timed for the summit meeting in Paris.
 It is said that it was the work of the military.  Only the military?
 What kind of state is this if the military do what the Government op-
 poses?  How can the Government tolerate this?  If anyone of our
 military allowed himself to do such a thing, we would pull him up im-
 mediately.  The Government and the country are strong when the en-
 tire machinery functions smoothly, when everything is subordinated to
 the Government.  Therein lies real strength.  Understand me rightly :
 When everyone pulls in a different direction what kind of state is this
 and what confidence can one have in the policy of such a state?
 There can be no confidence in the policy of such a state ! The state-
 ment that the aggressive flight was made without the will and instruc-
 tions of the Government, that nothing was known of it in the State
 Department, does not give credit to the Department of State of the
 United States.  And what about Allen Dulles?
 For he knew about all this and he also is a member of the United
 States Government ! For this is Allen Du] l.es' aviation ! It turns out
 that the State Department's reply is, as the saying has it, too thin.
 It is possible, I do not know this for certain, but I do not preclude
 the possibility that the Government of the United States of America.
 knew of this flight.  But I, so to speak, confide it to you I
 In diplomatic language it would be better to say ; It knew, but it
 stopped its ears and closed its eyes and now depicts the matter as if the
 devil led astray some official.  However, let it be, with this Govern-
 ment and with its way of issuing statements on all this.
 One thing is alarming in this statement.  It is vague.  More, this
 statement blames us for not allowing to fly over or travel across our
 country those who want to study our defenses, to discover secrets,
 And that is why they, that means the American Government, had been
 impelled to send planes on intelligence missions.  This is a very dan-
 gerous explanation.  It is dangerous because it does not denounce but
 tries to justify such a flight and seems to say that such flights are pos-
 sible in the future, too, because the Soviet Union does not think to
 reveal its secrets to countries that pursue unfriendly policy toward us.
 Using this as the only justification, some gentlemen intend to gain.
 the right in the eyes of public opinion to fly over our territory in th
 future, too, gleaning important military secrets.

 I repeat once again this is very dangerous, let alone that it is wrong
 rinciplc and not in keeping with the spirit of international peace-
 Wrelations.                                      If someone intends to fly over our territory, recon-
 noitering objectives and gleaning state secrets, we shall bring down
 such planes, dust bring diem down !
 Afore, if such flights are repeated, we shall take appropriate counter-
 measures.
 OTHER COUNTRIES WARNED
 I should say thus : Those countries that have bases on their territories
 should note most carefully the followin : If they allow others to fly
 from their bases to our territory we shall hit at those bases.  Because
 we assess such actions as provocations against our country !
 We tell the Governments of those countries, if you leased your ter-
 ritory to others and are not the masters of your land, of your country,
 hence, we shall have to understand it in our way.  Those who lease
 your territory, operate against us from your territory.  Their lands
 are far from us while your land is near.  That is why as a warning
 to remote targets, we shall find the range to the near ones. Let them
 draw the appropriate conclusions.
 I should not like to heat up passions because even in wartime people
 long for peace, await an end to the war and dream of peace.  There
 is no war now.  Our strength is being tested.  Therefore, let us not
 draw conclusions aggravating relations between countries, such con-
 clusions as would Hamper us in the future, I should like to say, even
 in building good relations with the United States of America. Today
 I declare once again that we want to live not only in peace but also in
 friendship with the American people.  The American people want no
 war.  I am sure of this.
 On the eve of the Paris meeting the a gressive circles wanted to
 bring strong pressure to bear upon us. We say: Let us conclude a
 peace treaty with Germany. Some of our former wartime allies are
 against this.
 WEST BERLIN STAND DECRIED
 But why I Plainly speakin , why need the United States of Amer-
 ica, France and the L nited Kingdom West Berlin 9  They need it
 as a dog needs a fifth leg. West Berlin does not give them anything.
 By the way, no one encroaches on West Berlin. It is said, freedom
 is at stake, but who encroaches on freedom?
 Let the West Berliners continue to live as they do now and let them
 have the regime they like.  The Soviet Government has long since
 declared that to select a regime is a matter for each people and that
 everyone should live as he prefers to. If the Western powers do not
 want to sign a German peace treaty we shall have to sign a peace
 treaty with the German Democratic Republic.
 The point is that even after we conclude such a treaty with the
 German Democratic Republic they would like to exercise those rights
 which flow from Germany's surrender, to exercise them in defiance
 of the peace treaty we would have signed. But if we sign a peace treaty
 with the German Democratic Republic, the terms of war will be ended
 and, hence, the terms of surrender will also be ended.  They will
 cease to operate. If after the signing of a peace treaty some one would

 like to force his way into West Berlin which we would like to see
 a free city, our force will resist this force.
 Aware of this, some leaders in the United States of America decided
 to teach Khrushchev a lesson. Since it is said that force will resist
 force, we shall teach a lesson to the Soviet Union, we shall fly over
 your territory and we already flew over it and returned home.
 EARLIER FLYOVER NOTED
 This happened, for instance, on April 9. I have already spoken of
 this. Even now this flight is denied in the United States. In this
 case the ethics is : If the thief is not caught, he. is no thief. But this
 time we caught the thief and now the whole world knows of it.
 The reconnaissance plane should have been brought down on April
 9, too. But our military, to put it mildly, let a chance slip by. And
 we, as one says, took them to task for it. On May 1 the reconnaissance
 plane was shot down. The military splendidly coped with the task
 when the opponent grew bold. For the American military thought
 like this : If the April 9 flight passed off with impunity, hat means
 they cannot hit it at such an altitude, and the aggressive military
 wanted to demonstrate their strength once again fifteen days before
 the summit meeting.
 Well,. Khrushchev, what are you boasting of?  We fly over your
 country and you can do nothing about it. They expected to fly over
 over Soviet territory this time, too, to fly over Sverdlovsk and to show
 that we can do nothing about it. Indeed, an unpleasant situation 1
 And now when he hit the air pirate with a rocket, as the saying has
 it, it is time to dismount from the horse I
 S. M. Budenny : One must slash down to the saddle, and everything
 will ggo to pieces.
 Niki.ta Khrushchev : I believe that this cavalry rule is quite appro-
 priate!
 Attempts are still made to frighten us because in the West bombers
 are flying on round-the-clock vigil * * *.
 I should like to tell those people : Listen, gentlemen, we also have
 bombers, but they are not on vigil, in our country rockets are on vigil 1
 It is common knowledme that V bombers, as a rule, fly at an altitude
 ranging from 12,000 to 17,000 meters, they cannot rise higher because
 designers still cannot overcome technical difficulties. The plane which
 committed the diversion on May 1 flew at an altitude of 20,000 meters.
 They say it was an unarmed V plane. It was because it was unarmed
 that it could fly at such an altitude. They expected that such a plane
 will be invulnerable for a long time to go.  They even expected that
 this will be almost for all time.
 I shall say further, when Twining, the then Chief of Staff of the
 United States Air Force, arrived here we welcomed him as guest and
 entertained him.  He left. our country by air and next day sent a
 plane flying at great altitude to our country. This plane flew as far as
 Kiev. The question arose: Should we protest?  I proposed that no
 protest should be lodged. Only an animal might act like Twining
 which, eating at one place, might do its unpleasant business there.

 From such behavior we drew the conclusion : To improve rockets, to
 improve fighters.  Our fighters can fly as high as 28,000 meters. But
 the difficulties of a fighter are that though it can rise high, it is not
 so easy and simple to find the target in the air; a plane in the air is
 like a needle in the ocean.
 But the rocket finds its targets itself. This is the advantage of the
 rocket and we use of it. W eiave both fighters and rockets. That is
 why I say: If there are still politicians who would like to rely on
 bombers, they are doomed to failure. With the up-to-date military
 techniques bombers will be shot down even before they approach the
 target. We also have good aviation. I flew to America in a TU-114.
 This plane is a modification of a bomber with a flying range of 17,000
 kilometers. I mentioned this to the President of the United States.
 However, the ceiling of the bomber is within the sphere of operation
 of fighters. It is now not so difficult to bring down a bomber.
 The Americans can do this, but we can do it even better.
 That is why one should abandon this exchange of threats. It would
 be better to speak of peace and friendship, how mutually advantageous
 it is to trade, how good relations can be established between peoples
 how cultural contacts and tourist travel can be developed.  This would
 be a far more useful and lofty job and all the peoples of the world
 would welcome this. This is precisely what our stand is, comrades!
 The peoples demand tranquillity, they are against wars and military
 conflicts.  Let us try and meet these just demands of the people.
 SOVIET GO.tLS CITED
 When we were preparing the recent session of the Supreme Soviet
 we did not envisage the discussion of any military questions. We
 drafted a law on the abolition of taxes paid by factory and office
 workers and a law on the completion of the transition to a, seven and
 six-Hour working day.            We prepared for discussion at the session
 the question of Increasing by 25,000,000,000 to 30,000,000,000 rubles
 expenditures for the expansion of industry manufacturing consumer
 goods so as to emerge to first place in Europe during this seven-year-
 lan period and to catch up with the United States five years later.
 What lofty aims from the attainment of which not a single people, not
 a single individual in the world, would suffer!
 And here, as one says, to "cheer us up " they timed such an ag-
 gressive act for the great proletarian May bay holiday ! But the ag-
 gressors themselves did not expect that they would indeed cheer
 us up. When Marshal Malinovsl y mounted the mausoleum on May
 Day to make his speech, I could already congratulate him on the shoot-
 ing down of the plane.  Ile replied that ho had learned this just be-
 fore motoring to Red Square.  This was good news before the min-
 ister's speech at the May Day parade.
 Comrades, today we are celebrating the day of victory in the war
 in which we lost more people and wealth than any other country.
 We mourn over the dead but at the same time we celebrate and rejoice
 in our victory.
 We rejoice because our people not only rehabilitated the devastated
 economy but far surpassed the pro-war level of development.  This

 victory is also being celebrated in countries that were our allies
 in the last war.  The Ambassadors of those countries are also here.
 We have just clinked glasses with the American Ambassador, Mr.

 I respect the Ambassador of the United States and I am convinced
 that he had nothing to do with this incursion, that he could not have
 anything to do even if he wished to.
 I am convinced of the ethical qualities of this man.  Since I know
 him I think that he is not capable of such a thing.   Evidently lie
 feels this incident as a big annoyance for his country and for himself
 as the representative of the United States in the Soviet Union. This
 must be taken into consideration.
 Comrades ! I propose a toast to the victory, to the nations and peo-
 ples who fought against Nazi Germany and with us won a great
 victory !
 I propose a toast to friendly Czechoslovakia, to the remarkable
 people of Czechoslovakia, to the hosts of this house, the Ambassador
 of the Czechoslovak Republic, Comrade Dvorak, and his wife, to all
 who represent the fraternal Czechoslovak Republic in the Soviet
 Union !
 I raise my glass to the end of wars, to the end of provocations, to
 peace and friendship between the peoples.
 9. STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE
 MAY 9, 1960
 [Department of State press release No. 254]
 On May 7 the Department of State spokesman made a statement
 with respect to the alleged shooting down of an unarmed American
 civilian aircraft of the U-2 type over the Soviet Union.  The follow.
 ing supplements and clarifies this statement as respects the position
 of the United States Government.
 Ever since Marshal Stalin shifted the policy of the Soviet Union
 from wartime cooperation to postwar conflict in 1946 and particularly
 since the Berlin blockade, the forceful takeover of Czechoslovakia
 and the Communist aggressions in Korea and Vietnam the world has
 lived in a state of apprehension with respect to Soviet intentions.  The
 Soviet leaders have almost complete access to the, open societies of
 the free world and supplement this with vast espionage networks.
 However, they keep their own society tightly closed and rigorously
 controlled.  With the development of modern weapons carrying tre-
 mendously destructive nuclear warheads, the threat of, urprise attack
 and aggression presents a constant danger.  This menace is enhanced
 by the threats of mass destruction frequently voiced by the Soviet
 leadership.
 For many years the United States in company with its allies has
 sought to lessen or even to eliminate this threat from the life of man so
 that he can go about his peaceful business without fear.  Many pro-
 posals to this end have been put up to the Soviet Union.                                      The Presi-

 dent's "open skies" proposal of 1955 was followed in 1957 by the
 offer of an exchange of ground observers between agreed military
 installations in the U.S., the U.S.S.R. and other nations that might
 wish to participate. For several years we have been seeking the
 mutual abolition of the restrictions on travel imposed by the Soviet
 Union and those which the United States felt obliged to institute on
 a reciprocal basis.  More recently at the Geneva disarmament con-
 ference the United States has proposed far-reaching new measures of
 controlled disarmament..  It is possible that the Soviet leaders have
 a different version and that, however unjustifiedly, they fear attack
 from the West.  But this is hard to reconcile with their continual
 rejection of our repeated proposals for effective measures against
 surprise attack and for effective inspection of disarmament measures.
 I will say frankly that it is unacceptable that the Soviet political
 system should be given an opportunity to make secret preparations to
 face the free world with the choice of abject surrender or nuclear
 destruction. The Government of the United States would be derelict
 to its responsibility not only to the American people but to free peoples
 everywhere if it chid not, in the absence of Soviet cooperation, take
 such measures as are possible unilaterally to lessen and to overcome this
 danger of surprise attack.  In fact the United States has not and
 does not shirk this responsibility.
 In accordance with the National Security Act of 1947, the President
 has put into effect since the beginning of his Administration directives
 to gather by every possible means the information required to protect
 the United States and the Free World against surprise attack and to
 enable them to make effective preparations for their defense. Under
 these directives programs have been developed and put into operation
 which have included extensive aerial surveilance by unarmed civilian
 aircraft, normally of a peripheral character but on occasion by pene-
 tration. Specific missions of these unarmed civilian aircraft have not
 been subject to Presidential authorization. The fact that such sur-
 veillance was taking place has apparently not been a secret to the
 Soviet leadership and the question indeed arises as to why at this
 particular juncture they should seek to exploit the present incident
 as a propaganda battle in the cold war.
 This government had sincerely hoped and continues to hope that in
 the coming meeting of the Heads of Government in Paris Chairman
 Ihrushchev would be prepared to cooperate in agrteeing to effective
 measures which would remove this fear of sudden mass destruction
 from the minds of peoples everywhere.  Far from being damaging to
 the forthcoming meeting in Paris, this incident should serve to under-
 line the importance to the world of an earnest attempt there to achieve
 agreed and effective safeguards against surprise attack and aggression.
 At my request and with the authority of the President, the Director
 of the Central Intel] igence Agency, the Honorable Allen W. Dulles, is
 today briefing Memgers of the Congress fully along the foregoing
 lines.

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT
 10. TEXT OF SOVIET UNION NOTE TO THE UNITED
 STATES GOVERNMENT, MAY 10, 1960
 [From the New York Times, May 11, 1960]
 Moscow, May 10 (AP)-Following is the text of a Soviet note to-
 day to the United States on the downing of an American plane, as
 translated by the United States Embassy.
 The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics con-
 siders it necessary to state the following to the Government of the
 United States of America :
 On May 1 of this year at 5 hours 36 minutes (5:36 A.M.), Moscow
 time, a military aircraft violated the boundaries of the U.S.S.R. and
 intruded across the borders of the Soviet Union for a distance of
 more than 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles).  The Government of the
 U.S.S.R. naturally could not leave unpunished such a flagrant viola-
 tion of the Soviet state boundaries. When the intentions of the violat-
 ing aircraft became apparent, it was shot down by Soviet rocket
 troops in the area of Sverdlovsk.
 Upon examination by experts of all data at the disposal of the
 Soviet side, it was incontrovertibly established that the intruder air-
 craft belonged to the United States of America, was permanently
 based in Turkey and was sent through Pakistan into the Soviet Union
 with hostile purposes.
 SOVIET CITES EVIDENCE
 As the Chairman of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers, N. S.
 Khrushchev, made public on May 7 at the final session of the U.S.S.R.
 Supreme Soviet, data from the investigation leave no doubt with
 respect to the purposes of the flight of the American aircraft which
 violated the U.S.S.R.'s border on May 1. This aircraft was especially
 equipped for a reconnaissance and diversionary flight over the ter-
 ritory of the Soviet Union.  It had on board apparatus for aerial
 photography, for detecting the Soviet radar network and other spe-
 cial radio-technical equipment which formed part of the U.S.S.R.
 anti-aircraft defenses. At the disposal of the Soviet expert commis-
 sion, which carried out the investigation, there is undisputable proof
 of the espionage reconnaissance mission of the American aircraft;
 films of Soviet defense and industrial establishments, a tape recording
 of the signals of Soviet radar stations and other data.
 The pilot [Francis G.] Powers, about whose fate the Embassy of
 the U.S.A. inquired in its note of May 6, is alive and, as indicated in
 the afore-mentioned speech of the Chairman of the U.S.S.R. Council
 of Ministers, N. S. Khrushchev, will be brought to account under the
 laws of the Soviet state. The pilot has indicated that he did every-
 thing in full accordance with the assignment given him.  On the
 flight map taken from him there was clearly and accurately marked
 the entire route he was assigned after take-off from Adana [Turkey] ;

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 PILOT}S UNIT IDENTIFIED
 The pilot has also stated that he served in sub-unit No. 10-10.
 which under cover of the 'National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
 tration is engaged in high-altitude military reconnaissance.
 This and othier information revealed in the speeches of the head
 of the Soviet Government completely refuted the-United States State
 Dopartnient "s concocted and hurriedly fabricated version, released
 May 5 in an official announcement for the press, to the effect that the
 aircraft was allegedly carryin g__ out. meteorological observations in
 the upper strata of the atmosphere along the Turkish-Soviet border.
 After the complete absurdity of the afore mentioned version had
 been shown and it had been incontrovertibly proved that the Ameri-
 can aircraft intruded across the borders of the Soviet Union for ag-
 gressive reconnaissance purposes, a new announcement was made by
 the United States State Department oil May 8 [Moscow time] which
 contained the forced admission that the- aircraft was sent into the
 Soviet Union for military reconnaissance purposes and, by that very
 fact, it was admitted that the flight was pursuing aggressive pur-
 poses.
 In this way after three days the State Department already had
 denied the version which obviously had been intended to mislead
 world public opinion as well as the public opinion of America itself.
 "OPEN SKIES`} ISSUE NOTED
 The State Department considered it appropriate to refer in this
 announcement to the "open skies" proposal made by the Government
 of the U. S. A. in 19.5E and to the refusal of the Soviet Government
 to accept this proposal. Yet, the Soviet Government,, like the govern-
 ments of many other states, refused to accept this proposal which
 was intended to throw open the doors of other nations to American
 reconnaissance. The activities of American aviation only confirm the
 correctness of the evaluation given to this proposal at the time by the
 Soviet Government..
 Does all this mean that, with the refusal of a number of states to
 accept this proposal for "open skies" the U. S. A. is attempting arbi-
 trarily to take upon itself the right to "open" a foreign sky?
 It is enough to put the question this way, for the complete ground-
 lessness of t le afore-mentioned reference to the U. S. A. "open sky"
 proposal to become clear.
 It follows from the aforementioned May 8 announcement from the
 United States State Department that hostile acts by American avia-
 tion, which have taken place numerous times in relation to the Soviet
 Union, are not simply it result of the activity of the military com-
 mands of the U. S. A. in various areas but are an expression of a
 calculated U. S. A. policy.  What the Scriet Government has re-
 peatedly declared in its representations to the Government of the
 U. S. A. in connection with the violations of the U. S. S. B. national
 boundaries by American airplanes has been confirmed, namely, that
 these violations are premeditated.

 EVENTS INCIAWF-
 U. S. POLICY DISCUSSED
 All this testifies that the Government of the U. S. A., instead of
 taking measures to stop such action by American aviation, the danger
 of which has more than once been pointed out by the Soviet Govern-
 ment, officially announces such actions as its national policy.
 Thus, the 0overnment of the, U.S.A., in the first place testifies to
 dovernment
 the fact that its answers to representations of the Soviet
 t
 s ue,and that l all v olt ons by alAmeri o n
 to were avoid   ?ubstance of tl form, behind
 aircraft arcrcraft of national boundaries of the U.S.S.R. represented actions
 conforming to U.S.A. policy.
 In the second place, and this is the main point, by sanctioning such
 ?          actions of American aviation, the Government of the U.S.A. aggTa;
 vies the situation even more.
 One must ask, how is it possible to reconcile this with declarations
 tStriving for prove
 the    of leading oviet Government, U.S.A. s also
 thU. .A like the S
 ment of relations between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A., for a relaxa-
 tion of international tension, and the strengthening of trust between
 states.
 Military intelligence activities by one nation by means of intrusion
 of its aircraft into the area of another country can hardly be called
 a method for improving relations and strengthening trust.
 It is self-evident that the Soviet Government is compelled under
 such circumstances to give strict instructions to its armed forces to
 take all necessary measures against the violation of Soviet boundaries
 by foreign aviation.
 VIEWS SAID TO DIFFER
 The Government of the U.S.S.R. regretfully states that , while it
 undertakes everything possible for the normalization and improve-
 ment of the international situation, the Government of the U.S.A.
 follows a different path.
 It is impossible to exclude the thought that, apparently, the two
 governments view differently the necessity of improving relations be-
 tween our countries and for the creation of favorable ground for the
 forthcoming summit meeting.
 The Soviet Government, as well as all the Soviet peoples, considers
 that personal meeting and discussions of the President of the U.S.A.

 and other U.S.S.R. during his visit in the U.S.A. Council
 ginning                                           Minis-
 tors of f the  .S.R. during
 ginning in the cause of normalizing Soviet-American relations and
 therefore an improvement of the entire international situation as well.
 however, the latest actions of the American authorities apparently
 seek to return the state of American-Soviet relations to the worst time
 of the "cold war" and to poison the international situation before the
 summit meeting.
 The Government of the U.S.S.R. cannot avoid pointing out, that
 the State Department's statement which is unprecedented in its cyni-
 cism, not only justifies provocative flights of the armed forces of the
 U.S.X. but also acknowledges that such actions are a "normal phe-
 nomenon" and this in fact states that in future the United States

 NT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 intends to continue provocative invasions into the confines of the air
 space of the Soviet Union for the purpose of intelligence.
 U.B. CONTRADICTION SEEN
 Thus the Government of the U.S.S.R. concludes that the announce-
 ment that the flight was carried out without the knowledge and per-
 mission of the Governnment of the U.S.A. does not correspond to
 reality because in the very same announcement the necessity for
 carrying on intelligence activities against the Soviet Union is justi-
 fied. This means that espionage activities of American aircraft are
 carried on with the sanction of the Government of the U.S.A.
 The Government of the Soviet I'nion makes an emphatic protest
 to the Government of the U.S.A. in connection with the aggressive
 acts of American aviation and warns that, if similar provocations
 are re eated, it will be obliged to take retaliatory measures, the re-
 sponsibility for the consequences of which will rest on the Government
 of the state committing aggression against other countries.
 TheSoviet Government would sincerely like to hope that the Gov-
 ernment of the U.S.A. recognized in the final analysis that the inter-
 ests of preserving and strengthening peace among people, including
 the interest of the American people itself, whose starving far eace
 was well demonstrated during the visit of the head of the Soviet
 Government, N, S. Khrushchev, to the U.S.A., will be served by the
 cessation of the aforementioned dangerous provocative activities
 against the U.S.S.R., by cessation of the "cold war," and by research
 through joint efforts with the Soviet Union and other interested
 states for a solution of unsettled international problems on a mutually
 acceptable basis, which is awaited by all people.
 11. TRANSCRIPT OF PRESIDENT EISENHOWER'S NEWS
 CONFERENCE, MAY 11, 1964 [EXCERPTS]
 [From the tiew York Times, May 12, 10GO]
 Washington, May 11 (UPI)-Following is the transcript of Presi-
 dent Eisenhower's news conference today:
 PRESIDENT EISENnowER. Good morning.  Please sit dov-n.
 I have made some notes from which f want to talk to you about
 this U-2 incident.
 A full statement, about this matter has been made by the State Do-
 partnient and there have been several statesmanlike remarks by lead-
 ers of both parties.
 For my part, I supplement what the Secretary of State has had
 to say, with the following four main points. After that I shall have
 nothing further to say-for the simple reason I can think of nothing
 to add that might be useful at this time.
 The first point is this: The need for intelligence-gathering activities.
 No one wants another Pearl Harbor. This means that we must have
 knowledge of military forces and preparations around the world, es-
 pecially those capable of massive surprise attack.

 Approved For Release 2005/08/22 : CIA%ggP8P00500001-1
 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SU
 Secrecy in the Soviet Union makes this essential. In most of the
 world no large-scale attack could be prepared in secret, but in the
 Soviet Union there is a fetish of secrecy and concealment. This is a
 major cause of international tension and uneasiness today. Our de-
 terrent must never be placed in jeopardy. The safety of the whole
 free world demands this.
 As the Secretary of State pointed out in his recent statement, ever
 since the beginning.of my Administration I have issued directives to
 gather, in every feasible way, the information required to protect the
 United' States and the free world against surprise attack and to enable
 them to make effective preparations for defense.
 My second point : The nature of intelligence-gathering activities.
 "BELOW THE SURFACE"
 These have a special and secret character. They are, so to speak,
 "below the surface" activities. They are secret because they must cir-
 cumvent measures designed by other countries to protect secrecy of
 military preparations.
 They are divorced from the regular visible agencies of movernment
 which stay clear of operational involvement in specific detailed
 activities.                                              gather
 These elements operate under broad directives to seek and mo g.
 intelligence short of the use of force-with operations supervised by
 responsible officials within this area of secret activities.
 We do not use our Army, Navy or Air Force for this purpose, first
 to avoid any possibility of the use of force in connection with these
 activities, and second, because our military forces, for obvious reasons,
 cannot be given latitude under broad directives, but must be kept under
 strict control in every detail.
 These activities have their own rules and methods of concealment
 which seek to mislead and obscure-just as-in the Soviet allegations
 there are many discrepancies. For example, there is some reason to
 believe that the plane in question was not shot down at high altitude.
 The normal agencies of our Government are unaware of these specific
 activities or of the special efforts to conceal them.
 Third point : How should we view all of this activity?
 DISTASTEFUL BUT VITAL
 It is a distasteful but vital necessity.
 We prefer and work for a different kind of world-and a different
 way of obtaining the information essential to confidence and effective
 deterrents. Open societies, in the day of present weapons, are the only
 answer.
 This was the reason for my "open skies" proposal in 1955, which
 I was ready instantly to put into effect-to permit aerial observation
 over the United States and the Soviet Union which would assure that
 no surprise attack was being prepared against anyone. I sliall bring
 up the "open skies" proposal again at Paris-since it is a means of
 ending concealment and suspicion.
 My final point is that we must not be distracted from the real issues
 of the day by what is an incident or a symptom of the world situation
 today.

 200       EVENTS LNCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 This incident has been given great propaganda exploitation. The
 emphasis given to a flight of an unarmed nonmilitary plane can on]
 reflect a fetish of secrecy.                                     y
 The real issues are the ones we will be working on at the summit-
 disarmarnent, search for solutions affecting Germany and Berlin and
 the whole range of East-West relations, including the reduction of
 secrecy and suspicion.
 Frankly, I am hopeful that we may make progress on these great
 issues. This is what we mean when we Speak of "working for peace."
 And as I remind you, I will have nothing further to say about this
 matter.
 1. Rosuirr J. DONOVAN of The New York Herald Tribune.  Mr.
 President, since our last visit, or conference, Prime Minister Khru-
 shchev has made some pretty vigorous statements about your plans
 for bringing Mr. \ixoii to the summit in case you had to come home.
 Do his comments in any way change your intention?
 A. No, indeed. And, I should clarify somethin , there seems to be
 some misunderstanding; because a friend from Congress, a friend
 indeed of the other party, told me the other day that he had never
 heard of the latter part of my press conference on this point where I
 said if my-if my absence from the conference had to be more than
 two or three days, I would be right back there, and I believe I re-
 marked, I am not sure, that the jet plane made this kind of a trip
 possible.
 Now, as far as Mr. Khrushchev's statement this, I can just say this:
 He has never asked me my opinion of some of his people.  [Laughter.]
 2. CuAiu.Es H. Mona of Time magazine. Mr. President, in case, Mr.
 President, that the Soviet Union should reject your proposal for sur-
 prise attack conference, or open skies arrangements, do you think that
 the development of satellites like Samos and Midas will possibly in
 the next few years erase our worries on the score of surveillance and
 also are you doing anything now to speed up those scientific projects?
 A. Well I know of nothing-no, I keep in touch with my Scientific
 Advisory committee and operators, and I know of nothing we could
 do to speed these up.  The are research items and as such no one can
 predict exactly what would be their degree of efficiency.  So I couldn't
 make a real prediction of what is going-how useful they are going
 to be.
 Q. Sir, do you think that their development will ease our worries
 on the question of secrecy?
 A. Well, I say, I just can't predict what the final results will be.
 Now. we do know this, right now. I believe, it's either Tiros that is
 sndmg back constantly pictures on the cloud cover all around the
 earth, and that is admittedly a rather rough example of what might
 be done in photography.  But this is being done constantly, and I
 don't know ow many thousands of photographs have been taken, and
 they send them back on command.
 3. LAURENCE Ii. Buav of The Chicago Tribune. Mr. President, last
 week you used the word "if" in connection with your trip to Russia.
 Have you changed any plans about that, or think you mi ht?
 A. No, not at all.  I have no idea, but you can never tell from one
 day to the other what is happening in this world, it seems, so I just

 5. EDWARD T. FOLLIARD of the Washington Post and Times Herald.
 Mr. President, do you think the outlook for the summit conference
 has changed, or has been changed in the last week or so?
 A. Not decisively at all, no.
 *       *       *       *
 11. MERRIMAN SMITH of United Press International. Mr. President,
 quite aside from your comment about the U-2 plane episode, sir, I
 wonder if you could give us your reaction to a rather denunciatory
 speech made this morning, right ahead of the summit meeting, by the
 Russian Foreign Minister.  Mr. Gromyko attributes to this country
 deeds and efforts which he said amount to dangerous ways of bal-
 ancing on the brink of war.                                 He says that the United States has de-
 liberately engaged in provocative acts in conjunction with some of our
 Allies.
 Now, with statements like this, do you still maintain a hopeful
 attitude toward the summit?
 A. Well, I'd say yes.  I have some hope, because these things have
 been said for many years, ever since World War II, and there is no
 real change in this matter.
 Now, if we-I wonder how many of you people have read the full
 text of the Abel trial, the record of the trial of Mr. Abel [Rudolph
 Abel, convicted Soviet spy.] Well, I think he was sentenced to thirty
 years.  Now, this business of saying that you're, doing things that are
 provocative, why, they had better look at their own record.  And I'll
 tell you this : the United States and none of its Allies that I know of
 has engaged in nothing that would be considered honestly as provoca-
 tive.                                    We are looking to our own security and our defense and we
 have no idea of promoting any kind of conflict or war.  This is just,
 it's absolutely ridiculous and they know it is.
 12. HENRY N. TAYLOR of the Scripps-Howard Newspapers. Mr.
 President, sir, would it be trespassing on your request about the U-2
 to ask if you could tell us something about any possible Soviet recon-
 naissance flights over the Western part of the world, and our response
 to them, if any?
 A. Well, I could just say this: as far as I know, there has never
 been any over the United States.
 15. CHARLES W. ROBERTS of Newsweek. Sir, in connection with the
 Abel trial which you mentioned-the Soviet Government in that case
 made no effort to defend Colonel Abel.  I wonder if an American
 citizen were arrested by a foreign government and brought to trial
 as a spy, what the policy of this Government would be so far as his
 defense was concerned?
 A. Well, we would certainly offer the good offices of our embassy,
 and see whether there was anything we could do.  Of course, we
 would have to do it, it would be an internal matter there and we
 would have to do it with the permission of the other country.  So
 far as I-I think that if there is anything wrong diplomatically with

 my answer, you had better ask the State Department, but I think that
 would be the result.
 *
 17. M u viN L. ARRoWSMITU of the Associated Press. Mr. President.,
 you have said many times that you wouldn't go to the summit under'
 any threats or ultimatums. Yesterday, as you know, the Soviets in
 their note threatened retaliation against us if we continued to fly these
 planes over their territory.  Do you regard that kind of threat as
 within the category you were speaking of? A. No. I think that you
 have to set that aside in a special category. I don't believe it's the
 kind of thing that you call an ultimatum at all.
 18. EDWARD P. MOIWAN of American Broadcasting Co. Mr. Presi-
 dent, a point of clarification, Mr. President: Do we infer correctly that
 your prepared statement this morning is the final, complete and ulti-
 mate answer to your critics, friendly and hostile, on the subject?
 A. I said that at this time I could see nothing useful more that I
 could say, so that's where I stand at this moment.
 20. JOHN SCALI of the Associated Press. Mr. President, you said
 in your initial statement that the Soviet account of the downing of
 this plane contained many discrepancies, and that there was reason
 to doubt that the plane was downed at a high altitude, as Afr. Khru-
 shchev claims.
 Can you tell us, sir, wlhetlier the Administration at some future time
 intends to expose these discrepancies, and can you at this time without
 violating what you have said, give us any more details about how we
 believe t1iis plane actually came down in the Soviet Union?
 A. Well, .1 don't think I am-you raise a question that is really an
 auxiliary to the main issue, and so I don't mind saying this: That,
 take the pictures themselves, we know that they were not, or we believe
 we know that they are not pictures of the plane that was downed,
 and there are other things in their statements.
 Now, I don't know what's going to happen in the future, but these
 things you can be sure will be carefully looked into.  And, as again
 I say, I do not foreclose any kind of statement that in the future may
 be necessary.  I am saying that now I can see nothing more useful:
 to say.
 23. RAYMOND P. BRAT DT of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  In view
 of your emphasis on the---you might go back to the summit if you had
 to come back here, have you any idea how long the Paris meeting will
 go on, how lone do you think it will take you to get to some agreement t
 A. Well, I c(ron't know.  But I just want to point this out : I hear
 that some, and I don't know whether this is all of the others or not,
 but they do not like the simultaneous translations.  Now, let us assume
 you have called an hour's conference, and one of you, for example,
 wants to make a, let's say, a ten-minute eg osition. When you take
 seriatum translations, here is already a half hour of an hour's con-
 ference gone, and you have had only ten minutes.
 Now, these are very slow and laborious things, and consequently
 the possibility of prophesying how long this thing is going to be is
 really remote. Now, for my part, I am perfectly ready to work as

 many hours as an individual human can to get this thing along the
 line, but I am prepared to go to this thing as long as there is any
 usefulness whatsoever promised, and even if I am called back, and I
 know I have one date for one twenty-four hours, I am still ready and
 prepared to go back. And that is what I have been trying to insist,
 that I am not making my own convenience and my own duties here the
 decisive thing as to how long this conference will last.
 24. LILLIAN LEVY of the National Jewish Post and Opinion.-Mr.
 President, are any changes in the present borders of West Germany
 part of the German question to be discussed at the summit?  I ask
 this, sir, because this issue has been raised by a responsible West Ger-
 man leader and member of Adenauer's Cabinet who recently suggested
 that Germans be allowed to return to Sudetenland.
 A. I didn't get the very first clause of your question.
 Q. Well, what I asked-were boundaries going to be part of the
 German question to be raised?
 A. Well, at this time we wouldn't raise it.  As a matter of fact,
 they've been living with these boundaries for a long time, and I would
 see at this moment no possibility of changing them except in methods
 that would be unacceptable, so, it might be raised by someone but
 I have no plan to do it.
 Mr. AitmiowsMITII. Thank you, Mr. President.
 12. ACCOUNT OF PREMIER KHRUSHCHEV'S INFORMAL
 NEWS CONFERENCE, MAY 11, 1960
 [From the New York Times, May 13, 1960]
 London, May 12 (Reuters).-Followin is an account, issued today
 by Tass, Soviet press agency, of the in f ormal news conference held
 yesterday in Moscow by Premier Khrushchev, incorporating a tran-
 script of the questions and his replies:
 Following the press conference given by Foreign Minister Andrei
 Gromyko, Soviet and foreign correspondents were invited to examine
 the exhibition of the fragments of the downed American plane.
 During their visit to the exhibition, the correspondents met Nikita
 Khrushchev, who, having examined the wreckage of the plane and
 talked to experts, was preparing to leave.  The correspondents sur-
 rounded Nikita Khrushchev and a conversation ensued.
 The correspondents expressed satisfaction with having been given
 an opportunity of examining the fragments of the plane and the
 equipment and special apparatuses it carried.
 I see that you are satisfied with the press conference, Nikita Khru-
 shchev said.  You must have got the answers to all your questions.
 I have already said that we intend to take to the Security Council the
 question of the aggressive intrusion of an American plane within the
 confines of our country.
 If the Security Council-on which, apparently, pressure will be
 exerted by the United States-does not take the right decision, we
 shall raise the matter in the United Nations General Assembly.
 Such aggressive actions by the United States of America are highly
 dangerous things.

 A oved .     "&2QP 1$8 2 : SC~IAA-RDP6o6BERE03R000500120001-1
 This danger is enhanced by the fact that in his statement of May
 9, the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, not only sought to
 justify this act of aggression, but said also that the U.S.   vcrnment
 mtencIed to continue such flights.
 "OPEN  TII1{EAT TO  PEACE"
 This is an open threat. to peace.  We will shoot down such planes,
 and we will strike at the bases from which these planes will be sent to
 our country.  You understand that if such aggressive actions con-
 tinue, this might lead to war.
 Question. K fay I ask you a question? one of the correspondents
 asked Nikita Khrushchev.
 Mr. IKIRusircnEV. Even two if you like.
 Q. You have probably noticed a placard among the fragments of
 the plane urging assistance to the pilot.  What do you think its
 authors meant.?
 A, We assisted the pilot when he flew into our territory and gave
 him due welcome.  If there are other such invited guests, we shall
 receive them just as hospitably as this one. We shall try him, try
 him severely as a s y.
 Q. How could all this affect the summit meeting?
 A. Let those who sent this spy plane think over this question.
 Though they should have thought about the consequences beforehand.
 After all, an aggression has been committed against our country.
 And we shall continue annihilating all the aggressors who dare raise
 a hand against us.  You see how accurately our rocketeers shot down
 the plane without setting it on fire'.  The pilot is alive, the instru-
 mentation intact, in other words the material evidence is here for
 everyone to see.  These are very skillful actions of our rocketeers.
 We are very grateful to them for this.
 Q. Will this plane incident influence Soviet public opinion when
 Mr. Eisenhower comes to Moscow?
 A. I would not like to be in Mr. Eisenhower's place. I would not
 like to be asked the questions which might be put to him when be comes
 to the Soviet Union. I can only say : The Soviet people and our public
 are very polite, so there will be no excesses, but questions will be asked
 of course.
 I would put it this way : one person, namely, NIr. Herter, has helped
 the President particularly in this respect.
 At his press conferenceHerter made an outrageous statement!  Far
 from feeling guilty and ashamed of aggressive actions, he justifies
 them and says that this will continue in the future. Only countries
 which are in a state of war can act in this way.
 We are not in a state of war with America. These aggressive actions
 and Herter's statement are impudence, sheer impudence!
 Herter's statement has made us doubt the correctness of our earlier
 conclusions that the President, the American Government, did not
 know about the flights. Herter's statement says that this intelligence

 There was a time-I remember it from my young
 criminals and other suspicious elements roamed the world. These peo-
 ple resorted to a followinm trick :
 A bandit with a small boy would hide under a bridge and wait for
 someone to cross it. Then the bandit would send the boy to the passer-
 by and the boy would say : Hello, Mister, give me back my watch.
 The natural answer would be: "What's that? Now run along!" Then
 the boy would insist : But look, Mister, this watch is mine. Why don't
 you give me back my watch? Then the armed bandit would appear, as
 do yttracted ou bully the, bonoise of the im back his watch and pass passer-by:
 Why                                               over
 Why   y      Y     Y? Give h
 your coat, too !
 The United States wants to live according to this law. But we are
 not defenseless passers-by. Our country is a strong and mighty state
 which can try its strength with it. If the United States has not experi-
 enced yet a real war on its territory, has not experienced air raids,
 and if it wishes to unleash a war, we shall be compelled to fire rockets
 which will explode on the aggressor's territory in the very first
 minutes of war.
 I say this because I have read Herter's statement saying : "We are
 compelled to fly ; it is the fault of the Soviet Union itself, because it
 does not give us access to its secrets, which we simply must know.
 This is why, if you please, we undertake such flights.  After all, the
 President has said that the skies should be open-this is why we fly
 and shall go on flying, shall go on opening the skies."
 How can an official representative of a state speak in this way about
 another nation !
 We do not live according to the laws of the United States.  We have
 our own laws and this is why we shall make everyone on our territory
 respect these laws-and the violators will be thrashed !
 I liked the article in the British newspaper Daily Worker, whose
 meaning was as follows : If we accept the philosophy which some
 people in the United States want to instill in the public, it will be, some-
 thing like this-it is not the burglar that is guilty, but the owner of
 the house he broke into, because he locked it, thereby compelling the
 burglar to break in.
 But this is a philosophy of thieves anal. bandits !
 I think that if world; public opinion correctly realizes all the gravity
 of the situation and approaches this aggressive act of the United States
 policy with due responsibility, if everyone unanimously condemns this
 act; and if the United States Government no longer uses such methods
 with regard to other states, this will be a good refreshing, so to say
 ozonizing, tendency in international relations.
 Reading American press reports these days, I see that excepting a
 few gangsters of the pen who are whitewashing this action, the abso-
 Inte majority of people writing in the American press, including those

 who are notorious for their past unobjectiveness, are indignant about
 this incident, regard it as perfidy with regard to the Soviet Union.
 It is a good sign.  If you, newsmen, inform the public correctly, this
 incident, as very other incident, will finally be digested. After all,
 gentlemen, we must live in peace, and not only in peace but also in
 friendship.
 "INCORRIGIar. , OI'TIUIBT"
 ~. Can one remain optimistic about the United States policy?
 A. I hold myself to be an incorrigible optimist.  I regard the
 provocative flight of the American intelligence plane over our country
 not as a preparation for war, but as probing. They have now probed
 us and we boxed the nose of the "probers."
 Sonic United States officials are makingg a big noise now.  Let them!
 The Soviet Union is not Guatemala.  Tlrey cannot send troops hero.
 We Ilave means to cool down bandits, should they wish to use their
 brazen rnetlrods against us.  If they behave in this way, they will
 get thiscalmative.
 Q. Mr. Khrushchev, has your estimate of President Eisenhower,
 which you gave upon your return from the United States, changed?
 A. Well, the statement issued by the United States Department
 of State in connection with the intelligence plane naturally alters
 my belief that the United States President had nothing to do with
 this affair.  I did not know that such an intelligence plan existed in
 the United States and that it included a program of reconnoitering
 flights over the Soviet territory.
 It follows from the statement of the Department of State, which
 was approved by the President, that flights of American intelligence
 PPlanes over our country are not a whim of some irresponsible officer,
 but realization of a plan, prepared by Allen Dulles leader of the
 Central Intelligence Agency, a department within tine jurisdiction
 of the united Atates President.
 Air. Herter admitted that the United States President had issued
 directives to collect various intelligence information by all possible
 means.  On the basis of these directives, programs have been worked
 out and implemented, which, as Herter said, included large-scale
 observations from the air with the aid of aircraft and by means of
 penetrations.
 I want you to pay attention to this-by means of penetrations
 that is by paeans of reconnoitering, spying flights over the territory
 of it state with whom normal relations exist.
 And this plan was approved by the President.  An unheard of
 action. And after all this I am expected to say: "What nice people,
 you are." That would mean lacking in self-respect.
 I would say that Mr. Herter has removed all wrappers.  Ile has
 removed all tlae paint with which, as it were, they camouflaged, made
 up and applied cosmetical treatment to the policy of the imperialists
 of the United States.
 Now, through his statement, he has revealed the bestial, fear-inspir-
 ing face of imperialism.
 So what ? It turns out that this face inspires no fear any longer.
 Such actions of the U.S.A. militarists are not inspired by the heroism
 of these masterminds, but by cowardice,

 Danger comes not from one who has command of one's nerves and
 counts on one's powers and possibilities, but from a coward who fears
 everything.
 I often read something like this: "Khrushchev claims that capi-
 talisin will die. Isn't this the reason why reconnaissance flights over
 the Soviet Union are made?" But it was not I who said it.  It is
 Marx who explained this a hundred years ago. If Messrs. Capitalists
 consider that Marx is wrong, then this should console them, then
 there is nothing to lose one's head over or show the white feather?
 Q. Did the Turkish, Pakistani and Norwegian authorities know
 about the provocative flight of the American plane?
 A. It is difficult for me to speak in the name of these countries,
 but I do grant that they did not know-the Americans are not ac-
 countable to them.  I do not think that even the Prime Ministers
 of the countries on whose territory American military bases are situ-
 ated are let inside those bases.
 The fault of such nations as Turkey or Pakistan is that they have
 joined aggressive blocs. The peoples saying on this score is "one sells
 one's soul to the devil ; before one has done so, one can be one's own
 master, but after it is the devil that is the master." That is how mat-
 ters are at present with Turkey, Pakistan and Norway.
 I warn you, Messrs. Foreign Journalists, don't sell your souls to
 the devil, keep them to yourselves. You would do better by applying
 your energies to promoting the progress of society. The Communist
 ideas shape the most progressive and the most correct trend in the
 development of society.
 The best of Americans, such as John Reed, the author of "Ten Days
 That Shook the World," grasped the great meaning of these ideas.
 John Reed was a very clever man. Yet he was not born Communist,
 but came to accept it during the October Revolution, and he died
 Communist.
 Some of you scribble stories against communism out of lack of wis-
 dom and understanding. May God forgive you for this.
 When I read the bourgeois journalists' stories slandering Soviet
 realities and communism I get angry sometimes, but, on second
 thought, I say to myself : Not all the journalists are John Reeds. In-
 deed, they are ordinary men, hired by such publishers as Hearst, who,
 like spiders, seize a man and enmesh him in their web.
 And if such a journalist fails to supply slanders against commu-
 nism, what then, will Hearst, or any other publishing concern, need
 for him? Hearst will not keep such a correspondent for a single day.
 HEARST ARTICLE CRITICIZED
 I talked with Hearst twice. During our second conversation I told
 him : "How is it that you told me one thing and wrote another?" And
 he replied : "Did I sum up the interview wrongly ?
 I must do him justice : He summed up the essence of the talk more
 or less accurately, but his commentary to it misrepresented the whole
 meaning of it.
 I told him this, but he replied : But I am a capitalist, it is my own
 commentary that I give. Indeed, he is a capitalist, but most of you are
 not capitalists, nor will you ever be. So why have you got to serve
 capitalism?

 TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 My conviction is that all the roads lead to communism.  Where else
 can they lead to?
 This is just what the American imperialists fear. This is why they
 they get nervous, and fling themselves into reckless adventures. This shows
 are not sure of their own system,
 The State Department of the United States says that all countries
 engage in spying. But the Soviet Union never sent its planes into the
 United States or any other countries for reconnaissance purposes, nor
 does it do so. If there have been any individual instances of our planes
 inadvertently violating the airspace of other countries--this has hap-
 pened on our frontier with Turkey and Iran-we have apologized to
 those countries and punished those responsible for such violations.
 We want to warn those who may try to send their spies into this
 country to think carefully of the consequences.
 Q. Do you still want President Eisenhower to cone to the Soviet
 Union?
 A. What shall I say ? Take my. dace and say it for me.
 You see for yourselves what difficulties are cropping up.  I ani
 frank with you. You know my attitude to the President of the United
 States. I have often spoken about. it. But my hopes have been some-
 what disappointed. I am a man and have human feelings. I am re-
 sponsible for the direction of the Soviet Government.
 You must understand that we Russians, we Soviet people, always
 go the whole hog: When we play, we play, and when we fight, we
 fight. So how can I now call on our people to turn out and welcome
 the dea~r~ gguest that is coming to us.  The people will say: Are you
 nuts? What kind of a clear guest is lie who allows a plane to fly to us
 to spy ? The American militarists who sent the aircraft on a spying
 mission over this country have put inc, as one responsible for the ar-
 rangements for the United States President's arrival in the U.S.S.R.,
 in a very difficult position.
 Frankly speaking, I think the United States President understands
 this himself.
 Supposing, before my visit to the United States, we had sent such
 a plane over there and they had shot. it. down. one can imagine the
 kind of welcome I would have got. from Americans. They would have
 met me according to my desserts.  I think everybody understands
 that.
 One can guarantee, however, that during the President's visit there
 will be no excesses.  Out- people are courteous; they let off steam in
 words, and will leave it to the Government to act. They will not
 indulge in any insulting actions.
 I think that. American journalists and tourists feel now the con-
 straint, and discipline of Soviet people.
 I have not heard of a single case of one of our people insulting an
 American. This is commendable. This speaks of the strong spirit of
 our people.
 Q. Will the flight of this plane come up at the summit?
 A. It already is the subject of discussion all over the world. That
 is why I do not regard it at present as necessary to put this matter on
 the agenda of the summit conference.
 We are allowing for the fact that I alone will represent the Socialist
 countries at the conference while the Western powers will have three

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE          T
 representatives there.  But I do not think that two of these three
 approve of this aggressive, dangerous act of American brass hats.
 Apparently you would like to know when I intend to fly to Paris.
 I intend to arrive in Paris, on May 14, a day or even two before the
 conference starts in order to get acclimatized a little.  I like Paris, it s
 a nice city.  Well, and if others do not come-I mention this because
 some are threatening that the conference may not take place-then it
 will be clear that it is not our fault that the conference did not take
 place. So we shall go to Paris?  And if the conference does not take
 place?  Well, we have lived without it for many years and will live
 for another hundred.
 It is not our country alone that is interested in the conference. All
 the world is interested in it. The peoples of all the world want inter-
 national tensions to relax, want a normalization of international rela-
 tions.                                   I believe our partners in the negotiations are as interested
 in the conference as the Soviet Union. Therefore the conference will
 depend upon our partners.
 We are ready.  I intend to emplane for Paris on Saturday, May 14.
 Some diplomats take offense and say that Khrushchev,'if you please,
 is indulging in too harsh expressions. I should like to have heard their
 reactions had a similar aggressive invasion been committed against
 their country.
 What do you expect of me, after all, that I should take off my hat
 and welcome this invasion? No, we shall meet gangsters the way they
 deserve. And this was a gangster, bandit raid.
 Have you seen here the "air sampling instruments?"  How can
 the authors of the fib look into our eyes after it was exposed? True,
 we know the kind of eyes imperialists have.  As the saying goes :
 "Spit in their eyes and they would keep saying : God's dew."
 Now you see that I did not tell the whole story deliberately at the
 Supreme Soviet session because we knew whom we were dealing with.
 We did not say at first that the pilot was alive, that the instruments
 were intact, that the plane did not explode.
 They believed that the pilot committed suicide, and now that he is
 alive the American press seriously reprimands the pilot for a breach
 of his instructions, for failure to commit suicide and surrendering
 instead.
 Some in the United States say that the pilot must be brought to
 trial for breaking the instructions and failing to destroy himself.
 Well, this is bestial talk. This is the ideology of imperialism.  You,
 gentlemen, American journalists, you read newspapers, don't you?
 This is a horrible thing.
 NOTE RECEIVED FROM U.S.
 Q. Did not the American Charge d'Affaires ask for an interview
 with Powers?
 A. The Americans have sent us a note on this question and asked
 to be allowed to have an interview with him.  But they themselves
 understand that this is too much. The pilot is now under investigation,
 he is a spy, isn't he?  So how can one speak about an interview with
 him? He must answer before our Soviet court.
 Q. Does this mean that neither the Ambassador nor the Charge
 d'Affaires will be allowed to see Powers?

 II4CIDENr To THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 A. I did not say that..  Maybe they will, maybe they will not.  We
 shall see later. Y cannot reply to this question now because the in-
 vestigation is in progress.
 Q. WW' ill you regard as aggressive actions flights of aircraft. of West-
 ern powers to Berlin after t1ie signing of a peace treaty with Eastern
 Germany ?
 A. We have already made a statement in this connection. I re-
 peat:After the signing~, of a peace treaty with the German Democratic
 Republic, the status determined by the terms flowing from the mili-
 tary surrender for this territory will change.
 Since that moment the occupation of 31'st Berlin will be over, all
 access to Berlin which was based upon the surrender of Germany will
 cease from that moment..  Then file German Democratic Republic
 will exercise full control of its territory and will also control access to
 West Berlin, which is situated on its territory.
 If the German Democratic Republic comes to terms with the coun-
 tries concerned and will allow them to use the airspace, the waterways,
 the rail and highways, this will no longer be our business.  That will
 be the business of the German Democratic Republic.           That's her
 sovereign right.
 Some say that the Vestern powers will force their way into West
 Berlin.
 I want to make it clear.  If anyone tries to force his way, our mili-
 tary units stationed in the G. D. R. to safeguard peace will counter the
 force of violators of peaca with their own force, and let some hotheads
 in the West ponder what would come of that for them.
 DELAY IN VISIT SrGOESTED
 Q. Considering this aircraft incident and your attitude toward
 President Eisenhower, wouldn't you prefer Eisenhower's visit to be
 put off ?
 A. We shall exchange views with the President on this question
 when we meet in Paris.  We still want to find ways to improve re-
 lations with America, we want to have normal relations with the
 United States.  And we believe that with time Soviet-American re-
 lations must grow into friendly relations between the peoples of our
 countries.
 That would be normal and that is what. all normal people are striv-
 ing and will continue to strive for.
 Any more questions?  In conclusion I have this to say, we deal
 Harshly with those who invade the borders of our homeland, who vio-
 late our sovereignty.  But we want to live in peace and friendship
 with all nations.  I hope you will understand our attitude when we
 angrily condemn such aggressive actions.  But we take a sober view of
 things and realize that even the sharpest polemics are better than war.
 This is why we shall do everything to have this strain relieved, shall
 do everything to normalize the international situation and to restore
 good relations with the United States if, of course, the United States
 also contributes to this.
 I should ask you to take this into account and not to write any-
 thing that. could increase tension still further.  What do you need it
 for?  After all, you will be in for trouble if a war breaks out. A war
 does not bring happiness to anyone.

 TO FRANCE HAILED
 Q. What would you like to wish the French people in connection
 with your trip to Paris?
 A. The French people have given me a good welcome, just as the
 American people, but, of course, I do not want to set one people off
 against the other. However, my visit to France was undertaken later
 and the impressions are therefore fresher.
 I am very much pleased not only with the welcome given to me by the
 French people but also with the talks I had with President de Gaulle.
 As to the people, well, all the peoples want peace. Wars are started by
 the governments, while the people's lot is to spill their blood.  This is
 why they all want peace.
 The French people also want peace. We fought against militarist
 Germany together with France.  If war breaks out, and it can be
 unleashed by West Germany, Frenchmen will remember that they had
 a good ally in the past-the Soviet Union.  This ally may come in
 handy again. But it is best we prevent war and be allies in the strug-
 gle for peace.
 I think it is time to end this impromptu press conference.
 Let me thank you, dear comrades and gentlemen, let me wish you
 success.
 Unfold the truth, the noble cause of peace, and you will earn the
 respect of your people.
 13. TEXT OF UNITED STATES NOTE TO THE SOVIET

 There follows the text of the note delivered on May 12, 1960, to the
 Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, in reply to
 the Soviet note of May 10,     :
 The Embassy of the United States of America refers to the Soviet
 Government's note of May 10 concerning the shooting down of an
 American unarmed civilian aircraft on May 1, and under instruction
 from its Government, has the honor to state the following.
 The United States Government, in the statement issued by the
 Department of State on May 9, has fully stated its position with
 respect to this incident.
 In its note the Soviet Government has stated that the collection of
 intelligence about the Soviet Union by American aircraft is a "cal-
 culated policy" of the United States.  The United States Govern-
 ment does not deny that it has pursued such a policy for purely de-
 fensive purposes.  What it emphatically does deny is that this policy
 has any aggressive intent, or that the unarmed U-2 flight of May 1
 was undertaken in an effort to prejudice the success of the forthcoming

 meetin  of the Heads of Government. in Paris or to "return the
 state of American-Soviet relations to the worst times of the cold war."
 Indeed, it is the Soviet Government's treatment of this case which, if
 anything, may raise questions about its intentions in respect to these
 matters.
 For its part., the United States Government will participate in the
 Paris meeting on May 16 prepared to cooperate to the fullest extent
 in seeking agreements designed to reduce tensions, including ef-
 fective safeguards against surprise attack which would make unneces-
 sary issues of this kind.

 ENCE," WITH GEORGE V. ALLEN, DIRECTOR, UNITED
 STATES INFORMATION AGENCY, MAY 15, 1960
 The ANiwuNCER. Here comes the future. From WW'ashington, D.C.,
 we present the Peabody Award-sw?inning College News Conference,
 where the leaders of tomorrow meet the leaders of today.
 Here today to meet our panel of university reporters is the IIon-
 orable George V. Allen, Director of the United States Information
 Agency. Now here is our founder and moderator, Ruth Ha
 Miss IIAoY. Good afternoon and welcome to aother weekly edi-
 tion of College News Conference.
 Mr. Allen, it is a great pleasure as always to have you back in
 our campus newsroom.
 Mr. ALLEN. Thank you.
 Miss Haar. I would like you to meet the students who are going
 to interview you at this I itne.- From George Washington Law School,
 Chuck Manati, who is the president of the National Federation of
 Young Democrats.  From Trinity College, Martha Dodd, who is the
 daughter of the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Senator
 Dodd. From Ilosvard University, Timothy Jenkins, the president of
 the Student Council. From the university of Maryland, Sybil Rap
 l oport:, the secretary of the student body.  From Tufts University,
 David Jackson, who is a Sears, Roebuck Scholar who comes to us
 under the National Merit Scholarship program.  Ile enjoys one of
 the fine scholarships given by many corporations in this country to
 enable many of our talented young people to continue with their
 education.
 Now, students, as you know Mr. Allen is a very distinguished diplo-
 mat and it is a good thing for us that he is because he is in a very
 hot seat today.  This is the day before the beginning of the summit
 conference and Russia ~*oes into this international poker game with a
 full house of cards.  Tlto advantage that they have gained from the
 downing of the U-2 plane a.nd our subsequent admission that the plane
 was on a spying mission, and then the launching of a four-and-a half-
 ton space satellite, today, five times larger than anything we have
 put into the air and more than three times larger than any of their
 previous launchings, rartrying a dummy-not a man-and inciden-
 tally, this feat was predicted on this very program two weeks ago by
 Senator IIenr ? .Jackson who anticipated that on the eve of the sum-
 mit there would be another great space achievement by the Russians.

 And so you see, Mr. Allen, as our Number One public relations offi-
 cer and his agency who have the job of interpreting us to the rest of
 the world, find that on the eve of the summit they have indeed-
 they find us in a very precarious and a very delicate position with the
 Russians having scored these two coups. However, he has had a great
 deal of experience in handling all sorts of matters. He has been our
 Ambassador to Iran, to India and Nepal, to Yugoslavia and to Greece.
 hand e
 H has for Near eEasterntAftai s. Ia of   that ohewill e able to Affairs
 this one.
 Who has the first question for him?
 Mr. JENKINS. Mr. Allen, given that your agency has the unique
 responsibility of interpreting our foreign policy in its most favorable
 light abroad, I wonder how you intend to vindicate the U.S. position
 on this spy incident?
 Mr. ALLEN. Let me say right off, that the responsibility of my
 agency is to try to represent the United States as honestly and as
 fairly as we can. Your implication that we try to put as favorable
 an aspect on the United States carries more of the connotation that
 we are merely trying to present the good side and hide the bad side.
 That is not the philosophy of the U.S. Information Agency. I must
 emphasize and say in all genuineness that we try to present the United
 States as honestly and as fairly as we can.
 Insofar as the recent events are concerned, we have played them
 right straight down the middle just as straight as we know how to
 play them.
 Miss RArroroRT. Well, Mr. Allen, what have the reactions been
 abroad?  How has our explanation been accepted by the foreign
 peoples?
 Mr. ALLEN. You refer to the U-2 incident, of course?
 Miss R ArroroRT. Yes.
 Mr. ALLEN. Reactions abroad-again I am going to be just as
 honest and frank as I possibly can-have mainly centered around
 three things: One of them is somewhat favorable; two of them are
 somewhat unfavorable.  The rather favorable side has been a very
 considerable amount of comment abroad, of understanding of the
 necessity of the United States and the free world in general., to try
 its best to find out what is going on behind the Iron Curtain.
 There is a very general concern about getting more information
 and an understanding of efforts on the part of the United States to
 try to do it. Furthermore in that same line there has been a rather
 considerable amount of appreciation for the fact that the United
 States was capable of carrying out activities of this kind.
 The two unfavorable aspects : First, the confusion, shall I say,
 of the announcements that came out of Washington on the subject
 and not only the original announcement saying that the plane was
 on a weather mission, but subsequent announcements which need some
 clarification here today, I think, concerning our right to carry out
 activities of this kind which have caused dismay in various foreign
 circles.
 But the other unfavorable aspect is the wide concern on the part of

 hoping, very much that the summit will find some measure of success,
 and this has caused dismay.
 Mr. MANATr. Mr. Allen, who is the person in authority who au-
 thorized the original statement that this was a weather plane?
 Mr.  A  I.LN. That was a spontaneous reply, as a matter of fact,
 It was already prepared, according to circumstances which were fore-
 seen and it was just almost a, I think, a pushbutton reply. As far
 as the actual reply made, it was made by the spokesman for the
 State Department, Mr. Lincoln White.  I spoke to Lincoln White
 yesterday and he said he gave out exactly the honest information he
 had in his hand front his reports from the field.
 Mr. MINATF. Don't you believe, sir, this will prove very unfortunate
 to involve NASA in something like this when our complete intentions
 were to divorce it from the military area and to bring the civilian areas
 into space much more?
 Mr. ALLEN, That is an unfortunate aspect of it, yes.
 Miss ILeor. May I clarify one point that I think has people con-
 fused. The officials of NAA who  ave out this information were
 acting in good faith, were they not? They were under the impression
 that this was a weather plane, that this was a weather mission, this
 reconnaisance mission ? Or were they in on the deception?
 Mr. ALLEN. That is getting into more details with regard to inside
 operations than I think I ought to try to comment on in all frankness.
 At the same time I will say this, that I know that the spokesman of the
 State Department who gave out the information was acting in entirely
 good faith when he said that it was a weather plane.
 Now your immediate question is, Doesn't this embarrass us by
 getting NASA involved in military operations? It does, I think. On
 the other hand let me remind you that the United States has been in the
 forefront from the beginning on the whole question of space, of trying
 our level best in every international conference that we have had, in
 the United Nations and in our talks with the Russians, and so forth, to
 make outer space an international operat.ioin, with cooperation-we
 have hone very far in offering to have internal space supervised-outer
 space supervised by multilateral operation.  We are perfectly ready
 to go in with the Russians and anybody else in an international opera-
 tion on space, just as we have been ready to go in with the Russians on
 an open-skies proposal for over-flights by airplanes. We have been
 pressing for this kind of agreement since--well, since the United
 Nations started.
 Miss Dow). .11r. Allen. as a propaganda specialist, what do you think
 Mr. Iihrushehev will do with the pilot of the plane?
 Mr. ALLEN. That is hard to predict. I have seen some suggestion
 that lie may present him at the summit meeting as a sort of a gesture.
 I don't know. I would doubt that.  Judgnig by the background, I
 would guess that lie would probably hold hire as a card close to his
 chest fora while.
 Miss Pone. '4~Tell, if he does put him up for trial, how far do you
 think the United States should back the pilot?
 Mr. ALLEN. We should do everything possible to see that lie gets a
 fair and honest trial. That means, of course, through diplomatic pro-
 cedures. I want to emphasize this: A lot has been said about the fact
 that this man was a spy and caught spying and so forth. There are a

 lot of different definitions of "spying" and I don't want to try to
 quibble, but I do think I ought to point this out and that more people
 ought to recall it : When he went down he told exactly what his mis-
 sion was and exactly what he was expected to do, and he was under
 instruction to do that.  He wasn't wearing a false mustache and a
 cloak and dagger and that sort of business that you usually think of
 as a spy pretending that he is somebody that he isn't. He gave an
 honest rport of what his mission is and I think that ought to be re-
 called by everybody concerned.
 Mr. JACKSON. Premier Khrushchev last week sent formal protests
 to the countries that based the U-2's in Europe and in Asia. Presi-
 dent Eisenhower also stated that in event of Russian intervention
 we would go to the aid of our allies. Already Norway has lodged
 a formal protest with the United States for using Norwegian bases
 for these flights. How can our allies give much credence to such a
 pronouncement from the President when they see our continual back-
 ing off in the Israeli-Egypt dispute over the use of the Suez Canal
 when we stated that we would go to Israel's aid to get free use of
 the Suez Canal and we have continually backed oft on that?
 Mr. ALLEN. We never said we would use Marines or the Navy or the
 Army to help Israel get through the Suez Canal. We have every
 time the question has come up in the United Nations or anywhere
 else, we have expressed our views very forcibly and very strongly
 that the Suez Canal ought to be open to the peaceful shipping of all
 nations.
 Mr. JACKSON. But don't we have a moral commitment to Israel to
 make sure that it is?
 Mr. ALLEN. When you say "make sure" does that mean go to war?
 That is the usual point of what you are talking about.  When you
 are saying : "You can't believe in us because we say that we have a
 moral commitment to see that Israel gets through the Suez Canal,"
 we have never said that we would go to war to assure that Israel would
 get through the Suez Canal.
 Miss RAPPOPORT. I would like to get back to the unfavorable re-
 action of which you spoke before about the U.S. right.
 The United States has maintained that this s ying was sort of a
 necessary evil.  Yet Mr. Allen, as a member per aps of the younger
 generation I would like to know your opinion of the example of
 morality that is being set by the United States Government in justi-
 fying this breaking of international law.
 Mr. ALLEN. The international law being the encouragement of an
 airplane over the Soviet territory or the spying?
 Miss RAPPOPORT. Espionage.
 Mr. ALLEN. The espionage part of it.
 Are you suggesting for reasons of morality that the United States
 ought to get completely out of any espionage business?
 Miss RAPPOPORT. I would like to know your opinion on the morality
 of it.
 Mr. ALLEN. That is a very fair question. I wish very much, Sybil,
 that we could. Nothing would please me better. If we had a world
 which would permit that. I think, as a matter of fact, that we have
 gone a far way towards an open society in proposals which we have
 made, such as those which President Eisenhower made in 1955 in

 which he not only offered to the Soviet Union but urged the Soviet
 Union to get rid 'of this closed society, this suspicion and these Iron
 Curtains that are goin * to prevent people from finding out  L  th
 planes fly opening. 7hie United States has been in the for.froetnt ine
 urging that kind of a result.
 Miss Riuroror.T. If you say therefore because of this tightness of
 the iron curtain there is a need for these reconnaissance flights in or-
 der to penetrate it, then why did the Government admit it, thus jeop-
 ardizing future security of the United States?
 Mr. ALLEN. That is a very important question and I have been very
 much interested and I may say quizzical about a great many com-
 ments that I have seen on that very subject.  Damning the United
 States for having admitted that the plane was flying over Soviet ter-
 ritory for the purpose of obtaining information about the Soviet
 Union. I must say right here that  think that that was one of the
 most important things that has been done in this whole field oft rying
 to build an open society.  The frank admission on the part of the
 United States that we did it.
 Now a lot of people will say : "You didn't do it until your hand was
 forced," and all that kind of matter, but I must emphasize that I think
 this admission-yes, we were trying to get information to guard this
 nation against surprise attack. We have gone through Pearl Harbor,
 we have submitted to surprise attack and where there is a great area
 of the world where there is no other means of finding out what is
 going on, the United States has said : "Yes-, we are going to try-we
 have a right. to try to get information as best we can.
 Let me say just one more thing-I know you want to ask questions;
 I don't want to take too much time on my own, but there has been a
 great misunderstanding that I would like to correct, today: Mr. Her-
 ter, the SIle has said that there is an obligation and a ecretary of State, has not said that we are going to continue
 th ep part of the government of the United States and of the free world
 to try to obtain information to guard against surprise attack. But he
 has not said that we are going to continue to fly. Ile hasn't said one
 way or another.
 Mr. JEN EI ti s. Mr. Allen, you seem to express confidence in the vir-
 tue of our admission, on moral grounds, but now the consideration
 of this admission in terms of jeopardizing the position of our allies.
 Given that the Russian statement is that there is a possibility of mis-
 silo retaliation, do you recognize that this is a thing which might com-
 promise the virtue of our open admission ?
 Mr. ALLEN. Timothy, I didn't justify our admission on moral
 grounds, no. I said that in my opinion, this is one step towards the
 general concept of an open society-open skies.  I am not saying
 whether it is moral or immoral. I am just saying that in my opinion
 is a step in that general direction.
 Mr..JENKI13. But considering the practicality of our allies being
 very much involved in our making such an admission, namely that
 the planes took off probably from their territories, doesn't this seri-
 ously jeopardize their position, in juxtaposition to the Soviet Union?
 Dir. ALLEN. Yes, that is one of the very difficult problems of this
 whole situation of the U-2, is this situation of our allies. There again
 I am quite frank to say here that it is perfectly obvious-I am not

 telling any secrets when I say that our allies are naturally going to
 be much more concerned from now on. It is quite natural that they
 would be, about the actions taken from airbases in their territory.
 On the other hand, in keeping with the same idea of trying to
 develop open skies, I believe that we will have the support of the
 general free world in the direction, in the trend in which the United
 States is trying to go.
 Miss HAGY. Mr. Allen, you have used the term "open societies"
 now, twice.  I wonder if you would perhaps elaborate on this.  We
 have heard about President Eisenhower's open skies plan which he
 presented before the United Nations and which presumably he is
 taking to the summit conference in a revised form.  Could you tell
 us something about how the open society differs from open skies?
 Mr. ALLEN. Well, the open society is a new and enlarged phrase
 but it grows out of the idea that we are going to get away from the
 seclusion and secrecy of every military action and allow-when we
 offer opportunity for Soviet planes to fly over the United States, take
 photographs, see anything they want to, that is open skies.  All we
 ask is that we be able to do the same.
 If you can take that step, then perhaps you might get towards
 the idea of societies being open.  That is laboratories, combined tests
 for atomic explosions, things of that sort.  We are trying to build.
 We want to encourage the Russians to come in with us, to investigate
 the explosion of atomic energy underground, in tests to see how the
 seismographic implements can detect it. All those sorts of things.
 Mr. MANATT. Mr. Allen, in preparation for the summit meeting
 we have had in a few short weeks the announcement that Vice Presi-
 dent Nixon may go to the summit, we have had the announcement
 of the reconvening of underground nuclear testing and also the U-2
 plane incident.
 I am wondering, do any members of our government in reference to
 the people in preparing for the summit consult with you in relation
 to, for example, the nuclear testing statement, and what effect this
 will have on the rest of the world and what effect it will have on the
 summit meeting?
 Mr. ALLEN. I must say that I was not consulted with regard to the
 nuclear testing statement, but I want to emphasize here again that
 oftentimes these statements are-the impression in the public mind is
 what they see in a headline. We haven't said we are going to start
 resuming nuclear weapons testing at all.  We have offered to the
 Russians an opportunity to participate with us in examining how
 nuclear testing, nuclear explosions underground, can be detected
 through improved seismographic instrumentation.
 Now that is quite a different thing from the general idea that we
 have suddenly said we are going to start resuming
 Miss HAGY. That is perfectly true, Mr. Allen. It took a whole week
 for the true picture of this resumption of tests to become clear.
 Now isn't it a part of the obligation to make sure that the original
 statements are presented with such accuracy that there is not a chance
 of this harm being done to us in a propaganda and public opinion
 way? Shouldn't they consult with you in the method of presentation
 so that it doesn't take a whole week for a refutation to penetrate?

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUET CONFERENCE
 Mr. ALLEN. I think perhaps I will have to agree with you although
 I must say no amount of consulting with me will determine how
 American newspapers are going to write their headlines.
 Mr. JACKSON. I would like to get back to the "open society" for a
 moment. Don't you agree that before any meaningful open society
 may be attained there must be a government by law and not of force
 implemented by men?
 Mr. T.LEN. In each nation, do you mean, or in the world?
 Mr. JACKSON. In the world.
 Air. ALLEN. In the world.
 Yes. That opens up a very much larger question.  We have to
 achieve a government of laws in the world, a rule of law in the world;
 yes, very definitely.
 Mr. JACKSON. Then don't you think that we are slightly hypocritical
 in our outlook towards international law? We will take the decisions
 of the World Court when they are favorable to us or we will accept
 their decisions. If we don't accept their decisions, we won't abide by
 them. We will break international law when it can be justified for our
 mutual security.
 Dir. ALLEN, You have it almost. right, What our position is under
 the Connally Amendment, we will not accept the jurisdiction of the
 World Court if we consider that it is a part of our internal matters
 and therefore we kee the decision as to whether we will allow a case
 to go to the World Court or not. I couldn't agree with you more. I
 think that we ought to build up the international court in every way
 we possibly can. That is the smallest little step we can take. Wic
 ought, in my opinion-I don't have any hesitation in stating it right
 here as strongly as I can-that the first and smallest step is to accept
 the jurisdiction of the international court.
 Air. JENxINS. Don't we in effect, then, by positing such a rule of
 expediency undercut the real significance of any such meeting" at the
 summit, where four men are going to sit down in the center of  urope
 and decide the world's problems with absolute criteria by which they
 shall operate in making their decisions? We have no common accept-
 ance on a Iegal theory,, which should be operative between nations.
 at the And      last summit conference it was the policy of the USIA to
 present this as a very favorable meeting which had accomplished
 many significant gains.
 Now when we view this in the light of the summit conference coming
 on, haven't we actually by the mere admission that this is not the real
 means for arriving at settlements, undercut the significance of such
 a meeting?
 Dir. ALLEN. I am not quite certain, Timothy-let me try to say
 what I think you mean.
 Air. JENKINS. Or will there be any attempt of USIA to bring out
 of this meeting things which are significant?  Would those things
 which are significant really be pertinent to the solutions of peace
 for our society ?
 Mr. ALLEN. Well, I think the summit meeting has possibilities of
 finding things that would add towards the peace of the world; yes.
 Miss HAOY. Are you optimistic about it?
 Air. ALLEN. Unfortunately-I wish I were. I think it is possible
 that the summit meeting-t am just guessing, now, but it seems to

 chance of accomplishment in    field of
 me it has the most
 new instructions to the disarmame t negotiators. I wish Ithecould be

 Your point, I think, Timothy, is why do we have summit meetings
 if we agree that a rule of law in the world is what is needed. The
 rule of law in the world is what we are heading towards, but we
 have to take an awful lot of steps in between time in every direction
 possible in order to achieve that rules of law.

 executive,initiative and positive programs make the best propaganda

 the summit with him other than the warmed-over version of the open
 skies announcement of five years ago?,
 Mr. ALLEN. President Eisenhower will announce that tomorrow at
 the meeting. It certainly wouldn't be proper for me to tell you today
 what he is going to say tomorrow.
 Miss RAPPOPORT. I would like to ask something about this morning's
 news story about the satellite being launched yesterday by the Soviets.
 You recently said that we had caught up with the propaganda gains
 of the Russians in space.  Doesn't this now put them out once more
 ahead of us in propaganda, and how does your agency counteract this?
 Mr. ALLEN. Putting earth satellites up is always going to be a kind
 of a seesaw thing. The Russians have a big jump today in putting up
 a four-ton satellite. It is by far the largest that has ever been put up
 and it is an important step towards evenually putting a man in space.
 I am the first to recognize that.  Although I will remind you, and
 our listeners, that until this morning the only earth satellites going
 around the earth were American. There were five of them. The only
 ones today that are sending back information from outer space are
 American.  Five of them are still radioing back. The amount of in-
 formation we have given to the world on space, on the dimensions of
 space and what goes on out there has been, I'd say, almost ten to one
 American against Russian.
 Miss IIAOY. Nevertheless, if they succeed in putting a man into space
 before we do-and it looks now as though they might with this trial
 test that they have just launched this morning Will that not give them
 a great propaganda advantage?
 Mr. ALLEN. Yes, it will. It will certainly give them a great propa-
 ganda advantage, but I wouldn't-as a propagandist I wouldn't pro-
 pose that we put up a man there until we are pretty sure that we can
 get him back-absolutely sure.
 Mr. JENTKINS. Mr. Allen, it is a conceded fact that we are now fourth
 with respect to overseas broadcasting.
 Mr. ALLEN. In factor of time on the air, yes.
 Mr. JENKINS. Yes.  It is also a surprising fact that many of the
 major auto manufacturers invest more in public relations than we do
 as a whole country.  I wonder then what you have to say about the
 probabilities of an increase in the budget out of this year's Congress?
 Mr. ALLEN. We are asking for a small increase this year.  I hope
 and believe we will get it.

 15. TEXT OF PREMIER KIIRUSHCHEV'S STATEMENT AT
 PARIS SUMMIT CONFERENCE, MAY 16,1960
 [From the New York limes, may 17, 136,0]
 Paris, May 16 (Rcutcrs)-Follouring are the text, in unofficial
 translation, of a statement made by PremierKhrushchev of today's
 session of the summit conference and made public by the Soviet
 Union.
 President de Gaulle.
 Prime Minister Macmillan.
 President Eisenhower.
 Permit me to address you with the following statement:
 A provocative act is known to have been committed recently with
 regard to the Soviet Union by the American Air Force.  It consisted
 in the fact that on May 1 a United States military reconnaissance air-
 craft invaded the Soviet Union while executing a specific espionage
 mission to obtain information on military and industrial installations
 on the territory of the It;S.S.R.  After the aggressive purpose of its
 flight became known, the aircraft was shot down by units of the Soviet
 rocket troops.  Unfortunately, this was not the only case of aggressive
 and espionage actions by the United States Air Force against the
 Soviet Union.
 Naturally the Soviet. Government was compelled to give appro-
 priate qualification to these acts and show up their treacherous nature,
 which is incompatible with the elementary requirements of the main-
 tenance of normal relations between states in time of peace, not to
 speak of its being in gross contradiction to the task of lessening inter-
 national tension and creating the necessary conditions for the fruitful
 work of the summit conference.  This was done both in my speeches at
 the session of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. and in a special note
 of protest sent to the United States Government.
 At first the United States State Department launched the ridiculous
 version tciat the American  lane had violated the borders of the
 U.S.S.R. by accident and had no espionage or sabotage assignments.
 When irrefutable farts clearly proved the falsity of this version, the
 United States State Department on May 7, and then the Secretary of
 State on Map 9, stated on behalf of the United States Government that
 American aircraft made incursions into the Soviet Union with mili-

 tary espionage aims in accordance with a program endorsed by the
 United States Government and by the President personally.
 Two days later, President Eisenhower himself confirmed that exe-
 cution of flights of American aircraft over the territory of the Soviet
 Union had been and remained the calculated policy of the United
 States.  The same was declared by the United States Government in
 a note to the Soviet Government on May 12.  Thereby the United
 States Government is crudely flouting the universally accepted stand-
 ards of international law and the lofty principles of the United Nations
 Charter, under which stands the signature of the United States of
 America also.
 INDIGNATION WAS VOICED
 The Soviet Government and the entire people of the Soviet Union
 met these declarations of leading statesmen of the U.S.A. with indig-
 nation, as did every honest man and woman in the world who displays
 concern for the destinies of peace.
 Now, at a time when the leaders of the Governments of the four
 powers are arriving in Paris to take part in the conference, the ques-
 tion arises of how is it possible productively to negotiate and examine
 the questions confronting the conference when the United States Gov-
 ernment and the President himself have not only failed to condemn
 this provocative act-the intrusion of the American military aircraft
 into the Soviet Union-but, on the contrary, have declared that, such
 actions will continue to be state policy of the U.S.A. with regard to
 the Soviet Union.
 How can agreement be sought on the various issues that require
 a settlement with the purpose of easing tension and removing sus-
 picion and mistrust among states when the Government of one of the
 great powers declares bluntly that its policy is intrusion into the
 territory of another great power with espionage and sabotage pur-
 poses and, consequently, the heightening of tension in relations among
 states?
 It is clear that the declaration of such a policy, which can be pur-
 sued only when states are in a state of war, dooms the summit confer-
 ence to complete failure in advance.
 We, naturally, take note of the declaration by the United States
 Government of such a policy and state that in the event of a. repeated
 intrusion by American aircraft into the Soviet Union we shall. shoot
 these planes down.
 The Soviet Government reserves the right in all such cases to take
 the appropriate retaliatory measures against those who violate the
 state sovereignty of the U.S.S.R. and engage in such espionage and
 sabotage regarding the Soviet Union. The U.S.S.R. Government re-
 iterates that, with regard to those states that, by making their territory
 available for American military bases, become accomplices in aggres-
 sive actions against the U.S.S.R., the appropriate measures will also
 be taken, not excluding a blow against these bases.
 In this connection it is impossible to ignore the statement by Presi-
 dent Eisenhower to the effect that under the threat of a peace treaty
 with the German Democratic Republic he could not take part in the
 summit conference, though what he called a threat was merely a decla-
 ration by the Soviet Government of its firm resolve to do away with

 the vestiges of war in Europe and conclude a peace, and thus to bring
 the situation-particularly in West Berlin-in line with the require-
 ments of life and the interests of insuring the peace and security of
 the European nations.
 How then can the Soviet Government take part in negotiations
 under conditions of an actual threat emanating from the United
 States Government, which declared that it would continue to violate
 the U.S.S.R. borders and that American aircraft had flown and
 would continue to fly over the Soviet Union's territory? The United
 States Government has thereby declared its intention to continue
 unheard of and unprecedented actions directed against the sovereignty
 of the Soviet state, which constitutes a sacred and immutable prin-
 ciple in international relations.
 (COVERT AND HONEST POLICY"
 From all this it follows that for the success of the conference it is
 necessary that the Governments of all the powers represented at it
 pursue an overt and honest policy and solemnly declare that they will
 not undertake any actions against one another which amount to viola-
 tion of the state sovereignty of the powers.
 This means that if the United States Government is really ready to
 cooperate with the Governments of the other powers in the interests
 of maintaining peace and strengthening confidence between states it
 must, firstly, condemn the inadmissible provocative actions of the
 United States Air Force with regard to the Soviet Union and, sec-
 ondly, refrain from continuing such actions and such a policy against
 the U.S.S.R. in the future.
 It goes without saying that in this case the United States Govern-
 ment cannot fail to call to strict account those who are directly guilty
 of the deliberate violation by American aircraft of the state borders
 of the U.S.S.R.
 Until this is done by the United States Government, the Soviet
 Government sees no possibility for productive negotiations with the
 United States Government at the summit conference.  It cannot be
 among the participants in negotiations where one of them has made
 treachery the basis of his policy with regard to the Soviet Union.
 If, under the obtaining conditions, the Soviet Government were to
 participate in negotiations clearly doomed to failure, it would thereby
 become a part to the deception of the nations, which it has no intention
 of becoming.
 It stands to reason that if the United States Government were to
 declare that in the future the United States will not violate the
 state borders of the U.S.S.R. with its aircraft, that it deplores the
 provocative actions undertaken in the past and will punish those
 directly guilty of such actions, which would assure the Soviet Union
 equal conditions with other powers, I, as head of the Soviet Govern-
 ment, would be ready to participate in the conference and exert all
 efforts to contribute to its success.
 As a result of the provocative flights of American military aircraft
 and, above all, as a result of such provocative flights being declared
 national policy of the United States of America for the future regard
 to the Socialist countries, new conditions have appeared in interna-
 tional relationships.

 Naturally, under such conditions, we cannot work at the conference;
 we cannot because we see the positions from which it is intended to
 talk with us : under the threat of aggressive reconnaissance flights.
 Espionage flights are known to be undertaken with reconnaissance
 purposes with the object of starting a war.  We, therefore, reject the
 conditions the United States of America is creating for us. We can-
 not participate in any negotiations and in the solution of even those
 questions which have already matured; we cannot because we see
 that the United States has no desire to reach a settlement.
 "DECEPTION" IS RULED OUT
 It is considered to be a leader in the Western countries. Therefore,
 the conference would at present be a useless waste of time and a decep-
 tion of the public opinion of all countries.  I repeat, we cannot under
 the obtaining situation take part in the negotiations.
 We want to participate in the talks only on an equal footing, with
 equal opportunities for both one and the other side.
 We consider it necessary for the peoples of all the countries of the
 world to understand us correctly.  The Soviet Union is not renouncing
 efforts to achieve agreement.  And we are sure that reasonable agree-
 ments are possible, but, evidently, not at this but at another time.
 For this, however, it is necessary first of all that the United States
 admits that the provocative policy it has declared by a policy of "un-
 restricted" flights over our country is to be condemned and that it
 rejects it and admits that it has committed aggression and admits that
 it regrets it.
 The Soviet Government is deeply convinced that if not this Govern-
 ment of the United States then another, if not another then the next
 one would understand that there is no other way out but peaceful
 coexistence of two systems, capitalist and Socialist.  Either peaceful
 coexistence or war, which will result in a disaster for those who are
 pursuing aggressive policy.
 PEACEFUL LINKS STRESSED
 Therefore, we think that some time should be allowed to elapse
 so that the questions that have arisen should settle and so that those
 responsible for the determining of the policies of a country would
 analyze what kind of responsibility they placed upon themselves,
 having declared an aggressive course in their relations with the Soviet
 Union and other Socialist countries.  Therefore, we would think that
 there is no better way out than to postpone the conference of the heads
 of government for approximately six to eight months.
 The Soviet Union on its part, will not lessen its effort to reach an
 agreement.  I think that public opinion will correctly understand our
 position, will understand that we were deprived of the possibility to
 participate in these negotiations.
 However, we firmly believe in the necessity of peaceful coexistence
 because to lose faith in peaceful coexistence would mean to doom man-
 kind to war, would mean to agree with the inevitability of wars, and
 under the circumstances it is known what disasters would be brought
 by a war to all nations on our planet.

 I wish to address the people of the United States of America. I was
 in the U.S.A. and met there with various sections of the American
 people and I am deeply convinced that all the strata of the American
 people do 'lot want war.  An exception constitutes but a small frantic
 group in the Pentagon and, supporting it, militarist quarters that
 benefit from the armaments race, gaining huge profits, which disre-
 gard the interests of the American people and in general the interests
 of the peoples of all countries, and which pursue an adventurous
 policy.
 We express gratitude to President de Gaulle for the hospitality and
 rendering us the possibility to meet in Paris, the capital of France.
 We also appreciate the efforts of the Government of Great Britain and
 Prime Alin ister Macmillan personally.
 We regret that this meeting has been for pedoed by the reactionary
 circles of the United States of America by provocative flights of
 American military planes over the Soviet Union.
 We regret that. this meeting has not. brought about the results
 ex ected by all nations of the world.
 Let. the disgrace and responsibility for this rest with those who have
 proclaimed a bandit policy toward the Soviet Union.
 ISSUE OF EISEti1IVIwEL VISIT
 As is known, President Eisenhower and I have agreed to exchange
 visits.  Lest September, I made such visit to the U.S.A.  We were
 greatly -ratified by that visit, the meetings and talks we had in the
 United Mates, and for all this we expressed our appreciation.
 The ]'resident of the U.S.A. was to make a return visit to our coun-
 try.  Our agreement was that he would come to us on June 10.  And
 we were being prepared to accord a good welcome to the high guest.
 Unfortunately, as a result of provocative and aggressive actions
 aganst the U.S.S.R., there have been created now such conditions
 awein we have been deprived of a possibility to receive the President
 with the proper cordiality with which the soviet people receive wel-
 come guests.                              At present, we cannot express such cordiality to the
 President of the U.S.A. since, as the result of provocative flights of
 American military planes with reconnaissance purposes, there are
 created conditions clearly unfavorable for this visit.
 The Soviet people cannot and do not want to be sly. That is why
 we believe that at present the visit of the President of the U.S.A. to
 the Soviet Union should be postponed and agreement should be
 reached as to the time of the visit when the conditions for the visit
 would mature.  Then the Soviet people will be able to express proper
 cordiality and hospitality toward the high truest representing the
 great power with which we sincerely want to live in peace and friend-
 ship.
 I believe that both President Eisenhower and the American people
 will understand me correctly.
 The Soviet Government states that on its part it will continue to do
 its utmost to facilitate the relaxation of international tension, to facili-
 tate the solution of problems that still divide us today. In that we
 shall be guided by the interests of strengthening the great cause of
 peace on the basis of peaceful coexistence of states with different social
 systems.

 16. TEXT OF EISENHOWER MEETING ON MAY 6v1G
 THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE                        960
 [Department of State press release No. 271, May 17, 1960]
 Following is the text of the statement by President Eisenhower,
 following the May 16 meeting of the Four Heads of Government:
 Having been informed yesterday by General de Gaulle and Prime
 Minister Macmillan of the position which Mr. Khrushchev has taken
 in regard to this Conference during his calls yesterday morning on
 them, I gave most careful thought as to how this matter should best be
 handled.  Having in mind the great importance of this Conference
 and the hopes that the peoples of all the world have reposed in this
 meeting, I concluded that in the circumstances it was best to see if at
 today's private meeting any possibility existed through the exercise
 of reason and restraint to dispose of this matter of the overflights,
 which would have permitted the Conference to go forward.
 I was under no illusion as to the probability of success of any such
 approach but I felt that in view of the great responsibility resting on
 me as President of the United States, this effort should be made.
 In this I received the strongest support of my colleagues, President
 de Gaulle and Prime Minister Macmillan. Accordingly, at this morn-
 ing's private session, despite the violence and inaccuracy of Mr. Khru-
 shchev's statements, I replied to him on the following terms :
 I had previously been informed of the sense of the statement just
 read by Premier Khrushchev.
 In my statement of May 11 and in the statement of Secretary Her-
 ter of May 9 the position of the United States was made clear with
 respect to the distasteful necessity of espionage activities in a world
 where nations distrust each other's intentions. We pointed out that
 these activities had no aggressive intent but rather were to assure the
 safety of the United States and the free world against surprise attack
 by a power which boasts of its ability to devastate the United States
 and other countries by missiles armed with atomic warheads. As is
 well known, not only the United States but most other countries are
 constantly the targets of elaborate and persistent espionage of the
 Soviet Union.
 There is in the Soviet statement an evident misapprehension on one
 key point.  It alleges that the United States has, through official
 statements, threatened continued overflights. The importance of this
 alleged threat was emphasized and repeated by Mr. Khrushchev. The
 United States has made no such threat.  Neither I nor my Govern-
 ment has intended any. The actual statements go no further than to
 say that the United States will not shirk its responsibility to saf e-
 guard against surprise attack.
 In point of fact, these flights were suspended after the recent in-
 cident and are not to be resumed.                                  Accordingly, this cannot be the
 issue.
 I have come to Paris to seek agreements with the Soviet Union
 which would eliminate the necessity for all forms of espionage, in-
 cluding overflights.  I see no reason to use this incident to disrupt
 the conference.

 NFERENCE
 Should it prove impossible, because of the Soviet attitude, to come
 to grips here in Paris with this problem and the other vital issues
 threatening world peace, I am planning in the near future to submit
 to the United Nations a proposal for the creation of a United Na-
 tions aerial surveillance to detect preparations for attack.  This
 plan I had intended to place before this conference. This surveillance
 system would operate in the territories of all nations prepared to ac-
 cept such inspection. For its part, the United States is prepared not
 only to accept United Nations aerial surveillance, but to do every-
 thing in its power to contribute to the rapid organization and suc-
 cessful operation of such international surveillance.
 We of the United States are here to consider in good faith the
 important problems before this Conference. We are prepared either
 to carry this point . no further, or to undertake bilateral conversations
 between the United States and the U.S.S.R. while the main Confer-
 ence proceeds.
 My words were seconded and supported by my Western colleagues,
 who also urged Mr. Khrushchev to pursue the path of reason and
 commonsense, and to forget propaganda.  Such an attitude would
 have permitted the Conference to proceed. Mr. Khrushchev was left
 in no doubt by me that, his ultimatum would never be acceptable to
 the United States.
 Mr. Khrushchev brushed aside all arguments of reason, and not
 only insisted upon this ultimatum, but also insisted that he was going
 to publish his statement in full at the time of his own choosin   It
 was thus made apparent that he was determined to wreck the Paris
 Conference.
 In fact, the only conclusion that can be drawn from his behavior
 this morning was that he came all the way from Moscow to Paris
 with the sole intention of sabotaging this meeting on which so much
 of the hopes of the world have rested.
 In spite of this serious and adverse development, I have no inten-
 tion w hatsoever to diminish my continuing efforts to promote progress
 toward a peace with justice. This applies to the remainder of my
 stay in Paris as well as thereafter.
 17. TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS BRIEFING WITH JAMES C.
 HAGERTY, ANDREW H. BERDING, AND CHARLES E.
 BOHLEN, PARIS, MAY 16, 1960
 [The White House press release]
 Mr. IIAGERTY. I will try to speak as loud as I can, Can the people
 in the back of the room hear me? I have a statement from President
 Eisenhower, which I shall read.  The statement is presently being
 stenciled and will be distributed as soon as it is mechanically possible,
 by my office.
 .Air. I3erding and I are here. Also with us is Ambassador Bohlen,
 who was present at the meeting this morning and who will be
 available for questions and a report on the meeting, after I finish read-
 ing the statement.

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO    r
 I will read it through, not at dictation speed, but I will read it
 through so that you can get the sense of it, and by the time I am
 finished reading, the stencil should be available outside.
 This is a statement by President Eisenhower.  (Mr. Hagerty then
 read the statement down to the words, "on the following terms. )7)
 What I will now read is what the President read at the meeting
 [see document No. 14] (and Mr. Hagerty continued reading down to
 "the main conference proceeds"). This is the end of the statement
 the President read this morning, but his full statement continues.
 (Mr. Hagerty read through the final paragraphs.)
 That is the conclusion of the President's statement.  (Most of the
 questions that follow, due to very poor hearing in the room, were re-
 peated by Mr. Hagerty for the benefit of those present, but are as
 accurately as possible the actual words of the questioner.)
 Q. How long will the President stay in Paris, Mr. Hagerty ?
 Mr. HAGERTY. I think that that would depend on what would
 happen tomorrow.
 Q. Mr. Hagerty, did Mr. Khrushchev reply to Mr. Eisenhower's
 statement?
 Mr. BOHLEN. Mr. Khrushchev made a partial reply to the Presi-
 dent's statement, by reiterating the three points of his ultimatum. He
 indicated that the statement of the President that flights would not be
 resumed; he inquired whether this meant for the duration of the Con-
 ference, and the President said, "No."  It was indefinite. He then
 repeated, however, that unless the United States would publicly
 renounce its past act and punish those which he said were immediately
 responsible for it, the Soviet Union still could not attend this Con-
 ference.
 Q. Well, Jim, is the Conference over?
 Mr. HAGERTY. I think that I could say-wait a minute-I think it
 was left wide open when the meeting broke up.  If I may have a
 suggestion which I think would save our time and yours, it would be
 that if you have any questions on the statement as such, if we could
 get this out of the way now and then ask Ambassador Bohlen to give
 you a rundown on the meeting, and during the rundown I am sure
 quite  a few of these questions that you are asking me would be
 answered. Would that be agreeable?
 Q. Did the President have anything to say about the attack that
 Mr. Khrushchev had been making on Pakistan and other countries
 where United States bases are, located?
 Mr. Bom EN. At the meeting this morning, he did not touch on
 that part of Khrushchev's statement. He did not go into the details
 of Khrushchev's statement other than those contained in his own state-
 ment.
 However, in answer to the question, I think prior to this Conference,
 that the United States had made it plain that it would fulfill its obli-
 gations to any of its allies in the event of any attack or threatened
 attack.
 Q. Did the British and French delegations take a stand on the
 American position?
 Mr. HAGERTY. Did the-you mean the statement that I just read?
 Q. And your statement of position

 AppZed Fcr,MaWQ,5N0~q?I0uR~D~P66B00E0R0E0500120001-1
 Mr. IIAGERTY. I think Yes, but I would prefer to have that come
 from the British and French spokesmen, who are now giving their
 special briefings.
 Q. Did Khrushchev make clear that he won't attend any bilateral
 meetings such as the, President mentioned, that he won't be back to-
 morrow morn ing at. Elysee Palace?
 Mr. BOHLEN. I think the first answer to that question is an impor-
 tant one. At today's meeting, Mr. Khrushchev said he did not consider
 this a meeting of the Paris conference, this was a preliminary meeting
 to determine, in their eyes, whether the Conference could take place or
 not.  He said the same thing in regard to any possible meeting to-
 morrow or in the nest days.
 Mr. HAGERTY. Again, if I can make a suggestion, I think it would
 be helpful if you would let Ambassador Bohlen, who was at the meet-
 ing as a Member of our Delegation, just run down through it. All
 right.
 Q. The Russians are saying that they will have a press conference
 after the President replies. Now, what you just said here and what
 you said at the closed meeting earlier, may we consider this the Presi-
 dent's final reply to Russia?
 Mr. IIAOERTY. How can you consider anything as final? The answer
 would be "No" to yyour direct question.  Now do you mean if I am
 gtigDon't to have another press conference today? Who can tell?
 you think t rat Mr. Khrushchev wants to prevent a meet-
 ing of President Eisenhower and the Soviet people because he is afraid
 that the Russian people. would welcome the President?
 Mr. II1aERTr. Yes, I would agree with that, but that was not the
 point.  Mr, Bohlen might want to answer that question directly on
 what happened on the invitation.
 Mr. BOHLEN. In further elaboration of his statement canceling the
 invitation, Khrushchev said that the circumstances had changed as a
 result of this matter of the plane, that it would be hypocrisy for the
 President to come to the Soviet Union, the Soviet people were not
 hypocrites and that they would not be able to understand how you
 could invite the representative of a state whose planes had flown over
 the Soviet territory and one of which had been shot down by Soviet
 rockets.
 He even said that he didn't know what he would say to his little
 grandson, if his grandson asked him that question.
 In regard to your answer, this is your question, of course Khru-
 shchev did not go into that angle of the thing, but I think it's a
 reasonable supposition.
 Q. Thank you very much.
 Mr. IInoERTY. And as far as the invitation or withdrawal of the
 invitation was concerned, in Mr. Khrushchev's statement this morn-
 ing, the President did not answer it, but the fact that Mr. Khrushchev
 withdrew it I think-the fact that Mr. Khrushchev withdrew it, pre-
 vented the President from refusing to accept. [Laughter].
 Q. Will you repeat that., please?
 Mr. IIAOERTY. I said the fact that Mr. Khrushchev withdrew the
 invitation prevented
 Mr. BonLEN. (to Mr. Hagerty) : No objection of the President.

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE      229
 Mr. I-IAG}ERTY. There was no objection on the President's part and
 it just meant that he did not have to refuse to accept the invitation.
 Mr. BOHLEN. The President did not refer at all to that part of
 Mr. Khrushchev's statement, dealing with the cancellation of the
 invitation.
 Mr. HAGERTY. I would still like to have Mr. Bohlen, who is present
 [laughter]
 Mr. BOHLEN. I will try and hit, gentlemen, the highlights of this
 meeting, since it went on for quite a while, as you know. 1 nd I think
 the first point I have already made, that Mr. Khrushchev made it per-
 fectly plain that he did not regard this as his attendance at the Con-
 ference, this was a preliminary meeting to see whether or not, as he
 put it, conditions could be established which would permit them to
 stay. He read his statement which lasted at least a half hour, and
 more with the translations-close on to an hour with the translation-
 was followed by the President's statement.
 Mr. Macmillan, and while I think Mr. Hagerty is right, that he
 would wish to brief it, but I think this was important because both
 General de Gaulle and Macmillan urged Khrushchev to adopt an
 attitude which would make this Conference possible. Mr. Macmillan
 pointed out that their reference to any threat had been completely
 removed by the present statement that these flights had been sus-
 pended and would not be resumed.  Mr. Macmillan also made the
 point that all espionage is in effect violation of sovereignty, and that
 unfortunately espionage was an unpleasant fact of life, but that he
 did not see how you could make too much distinction between one
 form of espionage and another since the great majority of any form
 of espionage constitutes a violation of national sovereignty.
 General de Gaulle, as I say, was trying to counsel moderation on
 Mr. Khrushchev. He proposed there should be at least a day's recess
 while there might be an opportunity to see what could be done. He,
 urged upon Mr. Khrushchev not to make any final decision.
 In reply to Mr. Khrushchev's question, as I had already said, the
 President made it clear that this suspension of flights was not just
 for the duration of the Conference. Mr. Khrushchev ignored this and
 put out his statement, as you all know, publicly, which contains no
 reference to the fact that the President had made this important
 statement.
 General do Gaulle pointed out that incidents like this of the plane
 were in effect the result of the tensions that this Conference had been
 called upon to deal with. He thought that its very happening, which
 was in the past, had highlighted the importance of addressing them-
 selves to the subject on which they had come to Paris for. He pointed
 out that as a matter of commonsense, the time was not far distant when
 the satellites in orbit would open the skies over all countries, and even
 mentioned that there was a Soviet satellite launched yesterday, which
 was crossing France eighteen times a day.
 None of this seemed to shake Mr. Khrushchev in his fundamental
 position, and he announced that he intended to publish this state-
 ment at a time of his own choice, and that he could not do otherwise.
 He made one interesting reference-interesting to me-when he said
 that this was a matter that involved deeply the internal politics of'

 230     EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 the Soviet Union, a matter which he said was of great importance to
 them. Ile stressed the fact that, as he termed it, the United States
 policy had been made public on this, ignoring the President's state-
 ment about the suspension of the plane flights, and that consequently
 a public statement would have to be issued by the United States
 and this statement included not only the question of suspension o
 the flight-, but also a denunciation of what had already happened
 and an expression of regret that this had occurred. The President's
 statement makes plain this was not acceptable to the United States.
 And also the third point was the punishment of those directly re-
 sponsible, as stated in his own statement this morning.
 The matter was left in some obscurity. Up to the time of Khru-
 shchev's announcement of his determination to publish this thing and
 publish it in full, there had been some consideration along the lines
 of General de Gaulle's statement of providing-suggestion as Presid-
 ing Officer that they should take a recess should see what might be
 done through bilateral or other forms of discussion, that he would
 stay in contact with the delegations and then later on would determine
 whether to call a session of the Conference.
 It was again at this point that Iihrushchev pointed out that he did
 not consider this the Conference, that these were preliminary meetings
 and not the Conference itself.  After he insisted upon publishing
 this, both Mr. Macmillan and General de Gaulle I think questioned
 what was going to happen, whether or not a meeting would take place
 tomorrow, or when, and I would say the matter was left in complete
 abeyance.
 Both General de Gaulle and Macmillan pointed out that if this
 statement was made public, it would be the taking of a -decision of
 the type which General de Gaulle had urged should not be taken,
 except after mature and due consideration during the recess.
 Q. What is your view? Are you ready for questions?
 Mr.IlAOERTY. Yes.
 Q. Can you tell us why
 Q. What. is your view of the significance of Mr. Khruslichev s
 comments about the internal politics of the Soviet Union?
 Mr. BoIILI:N. It struck me only that I never, at any previous con-
 ferences, heard any reference of this kind made.  I 'think anybody
 can draw their own conclusions from it.. I don't propose to speculate
 on what might. be in Mr. Khrushchev's mind, but only say this is
 the first time I have heard a reference in exactly those terms made
 in any conference with the Soviets.
 Mr. Khruslichev provided a few liighliglets which I might mention
 to you, one of which during discussion he raised both his liands-
 on the subject of innocence in regard to espionage and the friendly
 feelings towards all countries-he raised his arms above his head
 and said: "As God is my witness, my hands are clean and my soul is
 pure." [Laughter.]
 Q. Mr. Ambassador, is there going to be a Summit Conference?
 Mr. BoIrt.EN. Well, it depends on whom you are talking to. As
 far as Mr. Khrushcliev is concerned there hasn't been any. I think-
 and I don't want to speak for our Western colleagues, but we would
 consider this was a meeting of the Summit this morning. As to what
 happens in the future, I just don't know.

 Q. Mr. Bohlen, is it your feeling that Mr. Khrushchev intends to
 call off the nuclear discussion, the test ban, and the disarmament
 discussions, as well as the Summit Meeting?
 Mr. Bori.LEw. I don't think we can answer that yet. There have
 been two conferences going on at Geneva, the ten-nation disarma-
 ment conference and the nuclear testing thing which has been going
 on for over a year and a half.  We have not yet heard whether the
 Soviets are going to pull out of those yet.
 Q. Can you tell us anything about any further meetings the Presi-
 dent will have this afternoon or this evening?
 Mr. HAGERTY. Well, first, of course, when he returned to the Ameri-
 can residence, after the conclusion of the Summit Meeting, he had
 a meeting with all of the members of the American Delegation.
 And he and they, with Ambassador Bohlen and Mr. Berding and
 myself, were working-and he was working-on this statement that
 I have just read to you.  There is a meeting, and I think it started
 at four or shortly thereafter, of the Western Foreign Ministers at
 the Quai D'Orsay, which is probably presently in progress, and that
 is all the meetings I know of at the present time.
 The President is at the residence, and intends to stay there, but
 I do not know of any meetings scheduled for him other than those
 with his own people at this time.
 Q. Jim, did Mr. Khrushchev make any other references to political
 conditions in the United States beyond the remark in his prepared
 statement, which we have?
 Mr. HAGrRTY. Well, I will ask Mr. Bohlen to answer that.  He
 was at the meeting.
 Mr. Boi[LzN. I don't think he did.  I just haven't seen-I heard
 him make it, but I can't quite recall whether the reference to his visit
 to the United States is included in his published statement or not
 Mr. HAGERTY. Yes it is-Yes.
 Mr. BoTTLEN. He did-it was, yes-about how much he enjoyed it.
 Then he didn't add anything about the United States except what is
 in his statement.
 Q. Mr. Bohlen, did we offer to make the statement public that the
 flights would not be resumed during this period of discussion, when it
 still wasn't clear whether he was going to publish his own statement?
 Mr. BOHLEN. This statement actually did not come up, but I would
 say it is a fair inference that the statement at the Conference could
 have been made public.  But I would like to emphasize in this, in
 commenting on it, Mr. Khrushchev said that they had heard this with
 some satisfaction. However, they noted that there was no denuncia-
 tion of the past act, no expression of regret, and no indication of will-
 ingness to punish, as he put it, those immediately responsible for
 these overflights.
 Q. Mr. Bohlen, did Mr. Khrushchev in any way indicate what is
 going to happen to Captain Powers?

 Q. Was there any reference, Mr. Ambassador, to the German prob-
 lem and the possibility of a German peace treaty now ?
 Mr. BoiILEN. No, the only one is the one contained in his statement.

 Was he fiery angry or was he nonconunittal, or what was the atmos-

 Mr. BOHLEN.. I think he certainly wasn't noncominital, if you read
 his statement,  [Laughter.]

 articularly in his manner of expression or excited. But I would
 say Ea was under some feeling of tension.  Ile seemed to pay a great
 deal of attention to Mr. Groniyko on one side and to Marshal llali-
 novsky on the other.  The atmosphere of the meeting was very-cer-
 tainly wasn't cordial. It was not excited. but it was cold and busi-
 nesslike.
 Q. How did President Eisenhower take to Khrushchev's statement,
 Mr. Ambassador?
 Mr. Born i;x. I think the President's statement in response gives
 you the answer to that.
 Q. I mean, physically ?
 Mr. BOHLEN. Oli, there were no signs.  The President has been
 around a great deal and he didn't show any signs one way or other
 on his face when he heard this.
 Q. Will the President go to the Palais de Chaillot tomorrow at
 11 o'clock?
 Mr. I [AGM nTY, The Palais de Chaillot?
 Q. To the President's Palace?
 Mr. IIAGEiiry. I think the only thing I can say on that is what we
 have said two or three times, we will have to wait and see.
 Q. Jim, will the President still go to Portugal as scheduled?
 Mr. IIncE8rrY. Gee- you know, we haven't talked about that at all
 today. [Laughter.] I just don't know, Sinitty.
 Q. Mr. Anibassador, has the recent expulsion of the two Soviet
 spies from Switzerland been mentioned?
 Mr. BOHLEN. No, the only reference to espionage was the one in
 the President's statement, and the one I mentioned in Mr. Macmil-

 Mr. IIAGEPTY. I think his statement pointed out that there had been
 misunderstanding on this and that both on May 11 and on May 9 I
 believe the date is, referred to in the statement, these statements we
 thought were made clear, but there had been misapprehension on one
 key point.
 Q. Then the right to such flights is maintained?
 Q. Can I ask a question?  Was it not previously denied in Wash-
 ington that the President had ordered a cessation of overflights, as
 reported by Mr. Reston in the New York Times?
 Mr. IIAOEirrY. The story that you are referring to, I made the
 remarks, the story as written was not correct.

 Mr. ILwnwrY. The right to make flights is maintained?  I don't
 know what you mean by the right to make flights?

 Mr. IIAGERTY (indicating). That's my answer.

 were made?

 Mr. BOLiLEN. Yes. Khrushchev spoke first. De Gaulle opened up
 as host and said that yesterday he had received the information con-
 cerning the Soviet position from one of the participants, Mr. Khru-
 shchev, and he had made this known to his other two colleagues, and
 he wondered if anyone had anything to say.
 Mr. Khrushchev jumped in and said, "I have something to say,"
 and said it.
 Q. Was there any informal exchange between the two men-between
 Eisenhower and Khrushchev ?
 Mr. BoHLEN. No, there was not.
 Q. Did they shake hands when they came in?
 Mr. BOHLEN. No, they did not. When the President came in, Khru-
 shchev was already seated at the table, and the President just took his
 place at the tame.
 Q. How did the scene end up, Mr. Ambassador?  Did they say
 goodby to each other informally, or did they just walk out without
 speaking?
 Mr. BOULEN. They just walked out.
 Q. Has the machinery been set up, or is it being set up now to
 arrange a bilateral meeting, between Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Eisen-
 hower, and if so, who is operating that machinery?
 Mr. HAGERTY. No, I don't know of any at the present time. The
 statement that has been made by the President at the meeting-let
 me see where it is-on the last page: "We are prepared either to
 carry this point no further, or to undertake bilateral conversations
 between the United States and the U.S.S.R. while the main confer-
 ence proceeds." The President made the offer. We have heard noth-
 ing from the Soviets.
 Q. May I ask
 Q. Did Mr. Khrushchev propose to adjourn the Conference for 6
 to 8 months with some kind of pledge at this time not to change the
 situation in Berlin?
 Mr. BoULEN. There was no such pledge.
 Mr. IIAGERTY. The question was did Mr. Khrushchev make any
 pledge, was it?
 Q. No, is the Ambassador considering a proposal of some kind of

 Mr. HAGERTY. Is the Ambassador considering-what proposal, sir?

 Mr. IIAGEWrY. Will not change his position-I am sorry-on
 Berlin?
 Mr. BOZILEA-, I don't think it's possible to draw any inference from
 that statement. lie made no reference to Berlin at all, except tlie one
 in his published statement.  Therefore, I don't think that you can
 read into this one way or other, it`s merely what he said, let's have an-
 other-the conference, maybe in 6 to 8 months. IIe did say-you asked
 if there was any reference to the internal thing-1 think this is in his
 statement when there would be a new American government.
 Q. Ambassador Bohlen, did eit her Khruslichev or de Gaulle or .Mac-
 millan comment in any -,vay on the President's suggestion on United
 Nations surveillance?
 Mr. BOIILEN. The only one who did was Khrushchev, who said that
 the Soviet Union is sovereign over its own airspace and no one-and
 he repeated no one-will be permitted to infringe on it.  If you ever
 got, lie said, complete disarmament when there were no arms whatso-
 ever, then you could have open skies, open earth, and open water.
 But until that happens, no one--and he repeated no one-would be
 permitted to fly over the Soviet Union.
 Q. Mr. Hagerty
 Q. Jim
 Q. Jim, can you tell us why it was, or give us the background, the
 fact that these flights were suspended and were not to be resunied-
 why that was not announced, in view of the misunderstanding you
 mentioned ?
 Mr. II.tn rcra. WW'ell, 1 thought that it was, by some of our people in
 our Government, in some conversations that they have been having,
 but that's the only answer I can give.
 Q. Mr. Ambassador, is it correct that prior to Mr. Tihrushchev's
 clean hands and pure soul statement, there had been no detailing of
 any kind as to Soviet espionage in the West or the United States?
 Mr. BoiinEN. There was no detailing of it. but the President's state-
 ment, which has just been read by Mr. IIagerty, said: "As is well
 known, not only the United States but most, other countries are con-
 stantly the targets of elaborate and persistent espionage of (lie Soviet
 Union."
 Q. Mr. Hagerty, do you know whether-if the United States dele-
 gation is prepared to counterattack arrainst (lie Soviet Union on a
 propaganda basis on the matter, or rater try to calm down the situ-
 ation?
 Mr. ILAGERTY. We11, in the first place, I think that propaganda
 speaks for itself, and I refer you to the President's statement as far
 as propaganda is concerned here--at this meeting. I think what we
 tried to do is--on the second part of your qui,stion, I think that this is
 also handled in the statement, where the President says that "In spite
 of this serious and adverse development, I have no intention whatso-
 ever to diminish my continuing efforts to promote progress toward a
 peace with justice. This applies to the remainder of my stay in Paris
 as well as thereafter."
 I think those words speak clearly in answer to your statement.

 18. COMMUNIQUE, MAY 17, 1960
 [White House press release]
 The President of the United States, the President of the French
 Republic and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom take note
 of the fact that because of the attitude adopted by the Chairman of
 the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union it has not been possible
 to begin, at the Summit Conference, the examination of the problems
 which it had been agreed would be discussed between the four Chiefs
 of State or Government.
 They regret that these discussions, so important for world peace,
 could not take place.  For their part, they remain unshaken in their
 conviction that all outstanding international questions should be
 settled not by the use or threat of force but by peaceful means through
 negotiation.  They themselves remain ready to take part in such
 negotiations at any suitable time in the future.
 19. TRANSCRIPT OF PREMIER KHRUSHCHEV'S NEWS
 CONFERENCE, PARIS, MAY 18, 1960
 [From the New York Times, May 19,1960]
 Paris, May 18 (Reuters).-Following is the o7lcial English trans-
 lation of the text of Premier Khrushchev's prepared statement at his
 news conference here today:
 Ladies and Gentlemen.
 You obviously know the statement which I made on May 16 to Presi-
 dent de Gaulle of France, Prime Minister Macmillan of Great Britain
 and President Eisenhower of the United States.
 The circumstances under which the Soviet Government deemed it
 necessary to make this statement are generally known.  I have in view

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 the aggressive flights of American warplanes over the Soviet Union,
 undertaken on the eve of the summit conference, and the public decla-
 ration of the United States Government that such flights are its official
 policy.
 Now attempts are being made to lay the blame on us for the alleged
 refusal of the Soviet Union to take part in the meeting and for making
 some sort of ultimatums to the United States.
 But we have declared and we declare that we are ready to take part
 in the conference if the United States Government makes up publicly
 for the insult inflicted upon our country by its a   essive actions.
 However, we are still not sure that the es pionage fligghts, which are
 undertaken by the United States, will not be repeated
 Just recall the behavior of the United States leader, after they were
 caught redhanded.  I shall refer to documents, and documents alone.
 On May 5, when all the world learned that an American warplane
 was brought down over Soviet territory the Department of State
 declared that it was an aircraft which few over Turkey to collect
 meteorological information.  It. was claimed also that the pilot radioed
 back that he had trouble with his oxygen equipment. Asa result of
 this, the pilot allegedly lost consciousness and the plane, steered for
 quite a time by its automatic pilot, could have accidentally intruded
 into the Soviet airspace.
 It was reported that a search was carried on for this plane in
 Turkish territory around Lake Van, where the terrain is very moun-
 tainous.
 When we announced that the American plane had been shot down
 in the area of Sverdlovsk and that the captured pilot had owned up to
 being a spy, the United States Secretary of State Herter said on
 May 9 that it was indeed a spy plane.
 More, he said that such flights were being made on the President's
 instruction and in accordance with a program which provided for
 extensive aerial surveillance, including "by penetration" of the Soviet
 airspace.  It was a brazen statement on the part of Mr. Herter.
 On May 11, President Eisenhower himself confirmed Herter's state-
 ment.
 On May 12, the United States Embassy in Moscow, in its note to the
 Soviet Government, again said that aggressive espionage flights were a
 calculated policy of the United States.
 And now, in Paris, the President of the United States issues a state-
 ment to the effect that the United States has "suspended" its flight--
 and will not resume them.
 Some people ask, referring to this statement: What else does the
 Soviet union need?  It would seem that the threat of flights by
 American military planes over the Soviet Union is thus removed.
 "SERVITORS OF I3fFERIAI.ISM
 Such a statement may have satisfied the servitors of imperialism.
 The imperialists have grown accustomed to behaving like Russian
 merchants did of old : they painted the lackeys' lips with mustard, and
 the latter said, "thank you" and bowed low.

 EVENTS INCIDEN
 We will not tolerate insults, we have our pride and our dignity.  We
 represent a mighty Socialist state.
 But then Eisenhower said at the preliminary meeting on May 16
 that what he had meant by his statement about the suspension of
 overflights by American military planes was that they would not be
 resumed for the remainder of his tenure as President.
 He said he did not know, naturally, what decision the next Presi-
 dent would take.  Thus, what the President of the United States
 promises is not renunciation of aggressive policy, but merely a tem-
 porary "suspension" of flights till January, 1961.
 It is not for a long period that Mr. President promises us to dis-
 continue the provocative policy of espionage flights.  But interna-
 tional relations cannot be built on the term. of office of this or that
 'official, for what would then be the worth of any international
 agreement.
 If we followed the American President's logic, it would be impos-
 sible to negotiate on, say, disarmament.  An agreement may, con-
 ceivably, be signed today, but lose force tomorrow and be thrown
 into the wastepaper basket because the person who signed it would
 leave his post.
 To hear President Eisenhower, it would seem that the question
 of whether American military planes will or will not overfly the
 U.S.S.R. depends on him and him alone.
 Just think, what presumption !  He now says they will not overfly.
 What magnanimity !
 Of course, it is for President Eisenhower to decide whether to send
 or not to send his planes.  But it is another question whether they
 will be able to overfly our territory. This is decided by us, and very
 definitely for that matter-we shall shoot these planes down, we shall
 administer shattering blows at the bases whence they come and at
 those who have set up these bases and actually dispose of them.
 The point in question, therefore, is not some sort of "favor" to
 the Soviet Union on the part of President Eisenhower.  We do not
 ask "favors" of the United States Government, but honest condem-
 nation of the bandit flights of American intelligence planes.
 However, President Eisenhower did not utter a single word of
 condemnation with regard to the provocative policy against the Soviet
 Union, on the strength of which the spy flights were undertaken.
 Can such a statement by the President satisfy anyone but the
 aggressor himself ?
 Eisenhower's statement that he has suspended these provocative
 flights for the term he remains in the White House is not a confes-
 sion, not even a semi-confession, but an attempt to dodge confession
 and consequently responsibility for his aggressive actions.  But sub-
 terfuges and even semi-confessions of political leaders have never
 helped them to avoid historical responsibility.  Even the children
 are told : If you do something bad-own up and say you "won't do
 it again." In government affairs, it is even more important to make
 complete confessions and draw all the necessary conclusions.

 countries, would not understand us if we contented ourselves with the

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 American President's dodges and the "favor" he "graciously" did us
 by stopping flights over the Soviet Union till January, 1961.
 Nor could we fail to be surprised by Eisenhower's statement., which
 looked like a threat that he planned to submit to the United Nations
 a new "open skies" plan.
 After the Pentagon had realized that the Soviet skies were closed
 to American spy planes, the people there apparently decided to send
 planes with the sumo aims but under the United Nations flag.  It is
 to be hoped that the United Nations is not an American state, not
 a branch of the Pentagon, and will decline this humiliating role.
 Some of you say in~your dispatches that flights by American air
 pirates over the Soviet Union are only a "small incident."  You repre-
 sent here the press of various states, and I would like to ask you
 what would you think of your government if it treated with indiffer-
 ence, with unconcern, the overflights of your cities by military planes
 of countries of which you yourselves sometimes write as potential
 opponents?
 Would you respect such a government?  Would your families and
 you yourselves feel safe listening to the drone of an alien military
 plane over your heads?
 But the Soviet people have as much right to think in this way, the
 more so since the peoples of our country have vivid memories of two
 murderous wars imposed on us from without, two wars which took
 a toll of tens of millions of lives.
 It is indicative that the governments of the countries that have
 rashly lent their territories for the preparation and carrying out of
 aggressive spy flights over Soviet territory, are now compelled to
 righit themselves in this or other measure before public opinion and
 disavow the actions of the American military.  They, a parently,
 have begun to realize--and we are sure that this will soon be realized
 by everybody who opened their land for the establishment of Ameri-
 can war bases-that such things are not to be trifled with.
 The Soviet Government. regrets that it. was impossible to hold the
 conference now, but, as I have already said, it could not act otherwise.
 We have done everything to prepare well the heads-of-government
 meeting, but some hotheads in the United States of America have
 torpedoed it even before it could be opened.
 I rep. eat, gentlemen. the Soviet Union is firmly for peaceful coexist-
 ence, for talks, for the reaching of reasonable, mutually acceptable
 agreements.
 We shall work in this direction, confident that our peace-lovin
 policy meets with the sympathy and understanding of all nations, an
 we should like to believe that the Western leaders will also strive
 toward this end, that within six or eight months we shall again meet
 with our partners in a new, more favorable atmosphere, if they show
 interest and agreement. to have this meeting, if they create the neces-
 sary political atmosphere for it, for the discussion and settlement of
 urgent international problems-that is, if they do not undertake prov-
 ocations against the Socialist states.

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFEREN
 WE CANNOT BE BENT
 This can happen even sooner, but only if everybody realizes that
 no one will be able to intimidate the Soviet Union, the Socialist states,
 by any provocative actions whatsoever !  We cannot be bent !
 Negotiations and agreements with us are possible only on the basis
 of equality, without threats or blackmail.
 I should like to thank the President of France, General de Gaulle
 for enabling the heads of government to meet in Paris, for the ef-
 forts he made so that the summit should take place, so that our meet-
 ings should be held as agreed upon and conform to the aims for which
 we have come here.
 Today I paid a farewell call on the President of France. We ex-
 changed our views, and I am happy to say that a common striving
 was revealed to continue to exert efforts for the development and
 strengthening of our relations in every way.  I welcome this and I
 express my satisfaction that the President 'and I agree on this most
 important question.
 I should also like to express my gratitude to the Prime Minister of
 Great Britain, Mr. Macmillan, for his understanding and the efforts
 he made so that the summit meeting takes place.
 And yet, I cannot fail to express some regret as well.  If the
 President of France and the Prime Minister of Neat Britain assumed
 the position of the objective appraisal of facts instead of yielding to
 their Allied ties, if they displayed more will, the leaders of the United
 States might perhaps have been obliged to condemn their aggressive
 actions, and conditions would thereby have been created enabling the
 summit conference to take place and yield the beneficent results
 hopefully awaited by all the peoples of the world.
 I thank you for your attention, gentlemen, and I am now ready to
 reply to your questions.
 PARIS, May 18 (Reuters)-Following is the transcript of Premier
 Khrushchev's news conference here today, held after he made his pre-
 pared statement, with the Premier's remarks and those of non-English-
 speaking correspondents in unofficial translation:
 Ladies and gentlemen, I want to ask your pardon but I want to
 address myself to that little group in the hall that is booing.
 I have already been informed that Chancellor Adenauer has sent
 some of his riffraff that escaped the beating at Stalin~Tad and it is
 they that are indulging in this booing, they that we did not at that
 time send three meters underground.
 Look to it, if you were not beaten at Stalingrad and in the Ukraine,
 we will give you such a boo that you will lose any desire to come into
 the hail and boo again.
 Ladies and gentlemen, I want to draw your attention to the fact
 that they are reacting to my words without even listening to the trans-
 lation.
 They understand.  These are the plunderers who came to the Soviet
 Union to plunder and pillage and they carried away their hands-
 they carried themselves away from the Soviet Union. They escaped
 a beating.

 240     EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 The most important thing here is that you are all wise people, and
 you must certainly understand who is standing before you.  I repre-
 sent the great Soviet people, a people that has won victor ? in the
 Great October Revolution under the leadership. of the great Lenin, a
 people that is now successfully building a Communist society, that is
 confidently marching forward'to communism.
 And you, this little group, represent those people of whom the
 Germans themselves will in time be ashamed.  Ipam speaking of this
 German riffraff and not of the great German people.
 Their booing heartens me, heartens and gratifies me because in the
 words of a great representative of the German people, August Bebel,
 "If your enemies are attacking you, then know it. Bebel, you are on
 the right track."
 And if you boo me then this adds confidence to me and I understand
 that. I, too, am on the right. track.
 I shall not conceal my pleasure.  I like coming to grips with the
 enemies of the working class and it is gratifying for me to hear
 frenzy of these lackeys of imperialism.  Nothing they attempt to do
 will gaint.hem any good.  The Soviet Union, firm as a rock, is march-
 ing forward to build communism and will continue to march forward
 till the complete triumph of communism in the Soviet Union.
 Now thank you for your attention, Ladies and Gentlemen, I shall
 do my best to answer to the full any questions that you may have to
 ask me.
 DAILY SSETCII, London. Can Chairman Khrushchev say if the
 Soviet Union will continue the talks on disarmament and on the
 suspension of nuclear testsl
 A. We shall continue our negotiations in Geneva.  The American
 imperialists have received some clarification of late. They received
 an eye opener in Sverdlovsk.  And if they understand that, then there
 is a possibility to reach agreement on the discontinuance of tests.
 But if Eisenhower threatens that he will continue testing, then we, too,
 will follow suit until the whole world learns who are the true guilty
 parties and who is resisting agreement. We at any time are ready to
 sign such an agreement.
 The disarmament negotiations are another matter altogether. We
 are almost convinced that our partners in these disarmament negotia-
 tions do not want disarmament but want simply control over arma-
 ments, which is in other words the collection of espionage information.
 We will not agree to this.  We are for true disarmament, for true
 control measures, so that no one should threaten any one else.
 What is going on now at Geneva is merely procrastination.  But if
 this procrastination goes on, we will be compelled to approach the
 United Nations and to say that our partners do not want to reach
 agreement and that we are asking the United Nations General Assem-
 bly to consider the matter.

 great leader of a great state and knowing that truth is on your side
 it would be better to have the summit conference now than in six or
 eight months' time, considering the state of tension?
 A. Yes, we are in favor of holding a summit conference.  That is
 why we came to Paris.  But the United States must admit its aggres-
 sive intrusion, must condemn its act, give assurances that such acts
 would not be repeated and must punish the guilty party.  Then, if
 it had done so, we would be satisfied and we would have taken part
 in the summit conference, to seek correct solutions for the questions
 confronting it.  But the United States refused to do this.
 How then are we to negotiate with an aggressor, with a state that
 has committed aggression, and on the contrary is saying that these
 flights are United States policy ?
 Ladies and Gentlemen, we all have mothers.  You all do, too, other-
 wise you couldn't have come into this world.
 I remember during my youth I was born in a very poor family and
 it was only very rarely that my mother could buy us some cream. But
 sometimes when she did our cat would creep up and eat some of the
 cream, would steal some of the cream.  Then my mother usually took
 the cat by the scruff of the neck and gave it a good shaking and in
 the end would poke its nose into the cream to make it understand
 that such stealing was not allowed.
 Wouldn't it be better, Ladies and Gentlemen, to take the American
 aggressors by the scruff of the neck also and give them a little shaking
 and make them understand they must not commit such acts of aggres-
 sion against the Soviet Union?
 DIE WELT Hamburg.-Do you still consider that international is-
 sues should ~e resolved by peaceful means?
 A. Yes, I reaffirm that our policy has always been to solve disputed
 issues not by means of war but by peaceful negotiations. That is the
 policy we have always adhered to and continue to adhere to now.
 Q. Do you still adhere to your former proposal regarding the trans-
 formation of West Berlin into a free city
 A. Yes, I still adhere to this policy and we see no other reasonable
 way out. West Berlin is situated in the center of the German Demo-
 cratic Republic, which is a Socialist republic, whereas the system in
 West Berlin is a capitalist one.
 These two systems are antagonistic and this is always fraught with
 a conflict. Why should we have such a situation? Wouldn't it be bet-
 ter to take a better decision, that is to insure West Berlin a free city
 status, withdraw all foreign troops and make it possible for the in-
 habitants of West Berlin to choose the social system under which they
 want to live, the one which satisfies them the most, and, of course, on
 the condition that they are assured freedom of external ties with
 the world.
 This recent conflict with the United States aircraft convinces us
 all the more that these questions must be solved as we are approaching
 the mnatter with ever greater resolve and urgency. By the way, tomor-
 row I am flying to Berlin. We will talk with our comrades, Ulbricht
 and Grotewohl, and in general with our friends in the German Dem-
 ocratic Republic.

 44        EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 DER TAG, Berlin.-Do you intend to conclude a separate peace treaty
 in Berlin?  (There were additional shouts of "and when?")
 A. Yes we do intend to sign not a separate peace, but a peace treaty
 with the German Democratic republic and thus to put. an end finally
 to World War IL In that case, the Western powers will be deprived
 of their occupation rights, the right to maintain their troops in West
 Berlin. When? That is our business. When we consider the time
 to be right, we will take our fountain pens from our pockets-the
 necessary drafts have already been prepared and the drafts will be-
 we will sit down and sign the peace treaty and announce it to the world.
 I would like to add we are simply intending to do what the United
 States did with regard to Japan.
 We fought in the war together with the United States against. Japan.
 But the United States signed a peace. treaty with Japan.  But we
 didn't.  We are. exerting all efforts to prove the necessity to sign a
 peace treaty together, but. we have now almost reached the limits of
 our patience and of our effort to have a peace treaty signed together
 and when we do reach the Iimit we will sign such a treaty by ourselves
 just as, I repeat, the United States did with regard to fapan.
 NATIONAL BROADCASTING Co.-Why, since you knew about these
 flights, did you not tell President Eisenhower about them and ask
 him to stop them when you visited the United States?
 A. I will answer that question with pleasure. When we were talking
 in Camp David with President Eisenhower I almost opened my mouth
 to make that statement.
 I was on the oint of making it because the atmosphere there was
 so convivial wit i President Eisenhower telling me to call him "My
 friend" in English and using the same words with regard to myself
 in Russian. And then, thought I, why not raise the matter with this
 friend of mine.
 But when I became apprehensive and I thought there was something
 fishy about this friend of mine and I didn't }broach the subject and
 it turned out that I was right, because when we caught them red-
 handed they say they are not thieves, it's just their thief-like policy.
 That is all.
 This recalls to my mind what we used to do in the Donbas when I was
 the young boy.  ''henever we. caught a cat in the pigeon's loft, we
 would catch the cat by its tail and bang its head against the wall and
 that was the only way it Could be taught some sense.
 COLUD1BTA BRo.%ne.%sTING SYs'rEa1.-Since, because by desire or not
 you have become a factor in the American political campaign, would
 you care to say which President you would prefer to deal with?
 A. I thank you for that question. It is a good question, although
 rather a difficult one to reply to. Nevertheless, I will try to reply.
 When I was in the United States, I talked with very, many Ameri-
 cans, ordinary people, with people who are wealthy, with representa-
 tives of the capitalist world, the statesmen, the farmers. And I re-

 tamed very good and, I may even say, pleasant memories of my con-
 versations with most of these peoples.
 People everywhere are just like people and they all want peace.
 Perhaps they understand it in their own way, but that should certainly
 not be the ground for any conflict.  Perhaps they don't agree with
 my understanding and I don't agree with their belief that the capital-
 ism system is better. But that certainly should not be the object of
 any conflict and, all the more so, of a war.
 I am sure that the majority of Americans regret the act perpetrated
 by the American Air Force.
 It is true there are some Americans who have been kidded into,
 indignation against the acts of the Soviet Union but to this I can
 but reply, how would they themselves feel if we were to fly our aircraft
 over their country.
 But they would certainly come to the conclusion that such flights
 are absolutely inadmissible, that this can only end in aggression, can
 only bring about a war.
 Regarding the question of who, in my opinion, will become the
 United States President, there certainly was a person to my liking, a.
 person with whom I am sure we could have reached agreement.
 He was a great American, his name was Roosevelt and he was a
 worthy representative of the capitalist society, but we cooperated
 with him very well indeed during World War II.  When he died
 his policy died with him.
 But we are convinced that persons will come to power in the United
 States who will pronounce themselves in favor of reaching mutually
 acceptable agreements.
 We have nothing to quarrel about with the American people.  They
 are in favor of capitalism, that is their business and even then it is.
 not all the American people who are in favor of capitalism because
 many of them are simply under the oppression of the capitalistic
 system.
 But let them come, why doesn't everyone come to the Soviet Union
 and see for themselves what kind of a life we are now leading.
 Let even those who have been booing here come.  We'll give them.
 visas, too, and perhaps even they will see the light if they come.
 Our country is now second in the world in its industrial produc-
 tion, in science and in culture.  If I don't perhaps modestly say that.
 we are first in the world, we certainly do occupy a worthy place in!
 human society.
 But I do not want to interfere in the American political scene..
 We should maintain an attitude of patience and not try to forecast
 who will come to the fore in the United States elections.  The Ameri-
 can people will themselves elect their worthy representative as Presi-
 dent elect someone who would not understand the necessity of reach-
 ing agreement we can wait we have waited and we wait and, if the next
 President doesn't understand that, we can wait some more.  We don't
 need to hurry, we have long ago chosen the correct path.   We have long
 ago determined the correct line of our development and we are con-
 vinced that our choice was made correctly and we are marching con-
 fidently ahead to the building of a Communist society.
 You, perhaps, in time will also understand that this is the only true
 road and perhaps you, too, will join this road but even then you will

 not even be parallel with us, you will be lagging behind and trailing in
 our wake.  But we don't hold that against you, we'll help you to catch
 up and share our experience with you.
 COMBAT, Paris. Mr. Chairman, you agreed to come to France,
 despite the facts of the U-2 incident and knowing of the categoric po-
 sition taken by America.  Were you convinced that France night pos-
 sibly take up a position of appeasement?  Why in this case have rela-
 tions not relaxed despite the intentions and the actions of General de
 Gaulle?  Do you think, nonetheless, that these actions have served the
 cause of peace?
 A. Naturally we knew of the lane incident, in fact, I reported on
 it in my speech at the Supreme Soviet.  'WhN then did we come here?
 Because we thought that perhaps the United States might be stricken
 by some honesty and apologize for its actions.
 All the more so that in the recent past the United States apologized
 to Cuba when an American plane was shot down over that country.
 Then why shouldn't they apologize to the Soviet Union?  Well, that
 is what we thought, evidently we were mistaken.  It was evidently one
 thing to apologize to Cuba and another thing to apologize to a Socialist
 country.
 Well, that is their business.  It's simply a matter of upbringing,
 a matter of manners and honor.  Regarding the position taken by
 General de Gaulle.  Yes, he did do all he could but nothing came of his
 efforts.
 Why?  Well, I can only refer the correspondent who asked that
 question to General de Gaulle because it was the general who talked
 the matter over with President Eisenhower and so he knows his reac-
 tion.  I don't.
 As to the results, well, my opinion is that even after a war when the
 enemy has been routed the people once again live in peace and friend-
 ship.
 We had no war. What happened was only that someone tried to
 poke his nose into our affairs and we punched that nose so that now
 he certainly knows where the border is.  If he comes again, he will
 receive another blow as will the bases from which he takes off and
 where he intends to land.
 Actually, all this should be digested and the world should once again
 revert to peace and even more than that. to friendship.  I am convinced
 that that is the opinion entertained by President do Gaulle.  But he,
 President do Gaulle, found himself in a very awkward situation. That
 is my opinion, I don't know, he may not agree with me. On the one
 hand, there was nothing he could do but cor_demn the action because
 he is a man of lofty moral principles and there can be no two opinions
 on this matter. This was a thief-like sally.
 But on the other hand, the obstacle to this was that the thief turned
 out to be France's ally and not simply an ally but a leader in Western
 quarters.
 But, I don't want to go into the details of this matter.  It concerns
 the relationships between the allies. But speaking honestly, if it were
 an ally of ours that. bad acted in this way, we would say that that was a
 bad way to act and that the necessary apologies should be tendered.
 Well, there you are, those are the moral principles of communism.
 I cannot answer for the moral principles of a capitalist society. I am
 a representative of a Socialist society.

 I would like to add to that, if I understand the question to have
 meant how relations between the Soviet Union and France would
 develop after this, then my opinion is that all this will have no impact
 on the good relations that exist between France and the Soviet Union
 and from the talk I had today with General do Gaulle I gained this
 same impression also, because I feel President de Gaulle also wants to
 continue a policy of improving relations with the Soviet Union.
 We are certainly in favor of such a policy also, because we hold
 Franco in very high esteem as we do President do Gaulle, we esteem
 the French nation, the French culture, so we certainly hope that our
 relations with France, far from deteriorating, will improve.
 BERLIN RADIO. It follows from American press reports that the
 American delegate Gates, has from here declared an emergency alarm
 to the American forces.  How do you evaluate that act?
 A.-I have heard nothing of that report yet, but I certainly have no
 reason to disbelieve what the correspondent said.
 If this is really so it can be qualified as nothing short of a provoca-
 tion designed to trick the Americans and impose more taxes on them.
 Perhaps also it can be explained by ordinary cowardice. Sometimes a
 coward is even more dangerous than a provocation-monger.
 A provocation-monger is trying to provoke war while a coward can
 unleash war out of pure cowardice. I don't know this Gates. It's not
 for me to judge him. Let the Americans themselves see what sort of
 a person he is.
 The person I can vouch for is Marshal Malinovsky, here, a hero of
 World Wars I and II, a man who fought valiantly against the German
 militarists and against Japan during the war, a person who has been
 often decorated for his outstanding services. There is a true son of
 a Socialist motherland. And, as he says, he has not been calling any
 alert nor does he intend to.
 SOVIET POWER CITED
 But if this action was designed to somehow prevail upon us, then
 some other country should be chosen as the target for such acts, be-
 cause we certainly have every possibility of acting with regard to such
 provocations in the same way as we used to act with regard to that
 thieving cat which used to creep into the pigeons' loft.  We can cer-
 tainly teach it a lesson.
 [A few minutes were lost here due to a power failure.]
 I presume that the United States will attempt to raise the taxes in
 the country over this incident to try to increase their orders for military
 equipment-first to take more money from the pockets of the taxpayers
 and thus to gain greater profits out of armaments production.
 Our policy is a completely different one.  We have adopted, we have
 taken, the decision to abolish all. taxation of the population by 1965.
 By that time no one in the Soviet Union will pay any taxes at all.
 This year, we are completing the conversion of all the workers of
 the Soviet Union to a seven-hour working day.  By 1964, we will have
 a six-hour working day for all the workers and employees of the Soviet
 Union and by that time the coal miner will have but a five-hour work-
 ing day.
 That is our policy, and no provocation will make us turn aside or
 make us swerve from that correct time that we have chosen.  That is

 the true, the convinced, policy of the Soviet Union, a Socialist policy,
 the policy of our Communist party.
 NEvEES DEUTscuLAND, East Berlin.-Mr. Chairman, what in your
 opinion is the reason for the change in the posit ion of President Eisen-
 hower since your talks in Camp David? Can you explain the reasons
 for the, difference in the position of the United States in Camp David
 and now in Paris?
 A. I believe the best reply to that question was contained in the
 preceding one, the one referring to the alarm, to the emergency alarm-
 in the alarm of American troops.
 This shows that in the United States the most reactionary forces
 in the Pentagon are coming to the fore, and it is they who sent their
 planes on a sortie into the Soviet Union, naturally with the knowledge
 of the United States President.  And this explains this piratical policy
 pursued by the United States.
 JORNAL DO BR.%sir. Three questions.  Mr. Chairman :Do you intend
 to no to pay a visit. to the Latin American countries in the near future I
 ;jecond, liow do you, what. is your appraisal of the Latin-American
 countries in the the present world situation? and third, can the Latin-
 American countries participate in the solution of outstanding world
 problems ?
 A. The reply to the first question is easy regarding any possible in-
 tention that I might have of visiting Brazil.  Nobody has invited me
 to come.
 LATIN VISITS POSSIBLE
 But I am not losing hope of being invited to visit the countries
 of Latin America.  If I am. I shall gladly avail myself of that
 invitation.
 As for Latin America, we are happy to Bear the pulse of Latin
 America's struggle for independence against American Imperialism.
 The welcome accorded to Nixon in Latin American countries was cer-
 tainly an omen, a signal.  And I can but welcome the events in Cuba,
 where the people proudly and courageously rose up under the banner
 for the struggle for their independence.  I am convinced that the
 other Latin American countries will also rise up in the struggle for
 and ap-
 their independence. We will sympathize with their struary _'
 plaud their successes in this fight.
 I am convinced that the peoples of Latin America are accumulating
 their forces and that they will play an ever growing role in inter-
 national relations.  Unfortunately there still exist in Latin America
 today countries whose governments are taking money from their Tut but are. serving the interests of the American imperialists.  But
 the Latin American people are awakening, and we welcome this
 process and sympathize with it.
 It is only when the Latin American peoples have their own govern-
 ments, governments that will express the will of these peoples, that
 these nations will be able to truly raise their independent voices in the
 international arena, including tie United Nations. and this will cer-
 tainly be to the benefit of all the countries of the world, to the benefit
 of the cause of peace.

 "You better end your conference, or else we will end it without you."
 I want to thank the Government of France, President de Gaulle,
 the entire French people and the citizens of Paris.  And not only
 Paris.        For yesterday, for example, we paid a visit to a village out-

 when he was in the army.
 I want to end by saying that the Soviet Union will continue to ad-

 systems, that we will continue to pursue a policy of peace aimed at
 solving all questions at issue by negotiations.  But at the same time,
 we will firmly stand, we will firmly defend, our sovereignty.  This
 policy will, I am sure, be understood by all the nations, for this is the
 only correct policy, a policy of defending one's sovereignty without
 threats to any one.  Good-by.  I want to wish you all the best.
 But at the same time, I want to voice the hope that you will work
 for peace, that your pen will serve the cause of peace and friendship
 among the nations.  Thank you.
 20. COMMUNIQUE OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC COUNCIL,
 PARIS, MAY 19, 19,60
 [Department of State press release No. 274]
 The Permanent Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
 met in Paris on May 19, 1960, and heard statements from the Foreign
 Ministers of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States on
 the events which prevented the holding of the summit conference.
 In the communique published at the end of its meeting in Istanbul,
 the North Atlantic Council welcomed the prospects of negotiations
 with the Soviet Union and expressed the hope that the negotiations
 would lead to an improvement in international relations.
 It regrets that Mr. Khrushchev's position has made negotiations
 in Paris impossible.
 Reaffirming complete solidarity of the countries of the Alliance, it
 fully approves the statement of the three Heads of State or Govern-
 ment that "all outstanding international questions should be settled
 not by the use or threat of force but by peaceful means through nego-
 tiations" and "remains ready to take part in such negotiations at any
 suitable time in the future".
 21. REMARKS OF PRESIDENT EISENHOWER ON HIS

 [White House Press Release]
 My good friends and fellow citizens :
 After a trip of this kind you can well understand what it means
 to me to have this kind of a welcome. I am deeply appreciative of
 the trouble that each of you took to come out to this spot.  It truly
 means a lot to me.
 As we planned for the Summit, the hopes of the world were not
 too high. The experience of the past years had denied us any right

 to believe that great advances toward the purpose we seek-peace
 with 'ustice--could be achieved in any great measure. Yet, it seems
 that time identity of interest between ourselves and the Soviets in cer-
 tain features was so obvious that logically we should have made some
 progress.
 Certainly the subjects on which we wanted to talk were those that
 seemed so important to them-for example, disarmament; the widen-
 ing of contacts so that we would have open societies, or slightly more
 open societies dealing with each other; then the matter of Berlin and
 a divided Germany; and finally, as between Russia, the U.K. and our-
 selves some agreement on a plan for control of nuclear testing.
 Therefore, it was a mystery, and remains a mystery, as to why at
 this  articular moment the Soviets chose so to distort and overplay
 the 0-2 incident that they obviously wanted no talks of any kind,
 and, in fact, made it impossible to begin them. I am not going to
 speculate today as to the future, but it is quite clear that since they
 wanted no talks whatsoever at this time that we can be watchful for
 more irritations, possibly other incidents that can be more than annoy-
 ing, sometimes creating real problems.
 For example, just today a half hour before I landed, it was reported
 to me that there is a C--47 missing in Western Germany. This is an
 unarmed, slow plane-no possibility of being used for military pur-
 poses-and, in fact., I believe it had nine passengers aboard. There
 was some bad weather and its route took it near the Eastern German
 border. We do not know at this moment that any deliberate act de-
 layed it, but at least it is overdue.  And so, in the atmosphere in
 which we now have to think and Iive we cannot. be sure that t e worst
 has not happened.
 Now, I may want to talk soon to the nation about these matters, and
 for that part of it, I now stop. But I do want to tell all of you people
 about three or four encouraging features that I encountered. First of
 all, was the assurance of the support of the home folks-from friends,
 and from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, from the political leaders of both
 parties, from newspaper comments and editorial comment of every
 kind-I was assured of the essential solidarity of the United States,
 and the sincerity of our peaceful purposes.
 Secondly, was the conduct of my two principal colleagues of the
 West. Mr. Macmillan and General do Gaulle were superb.  They
 spoke with one voice with our Delegation in support of those things
 which we thought. right and decent and logical.
 Thirdly, was an action on the part of the NATO Council yester-
 day when Secretary Herter reported to them while I was in Portugal.
 The NATO Resolution unanimously supported the three Western
 powers in what we were trying to do.
 And finally, the Portuguese reception.  In a way I think they
 wanted to provide the United States and the West-and even me per-
 sonally-with something of an antidote for some of the disappoint-
 ments we have felt.. Government and citizens alike tried to outdo
 themselves in the warmth and cordiality of their reception, and on
 top of that, in their assurances from every side-newspapers, the offi-
 cials, common people coming in who were serving us in the Palace-
 everywhere they said-the West in effect is right., and we want you
 to know it.. And they used every possible way to do it. And for that
 day in Portugal yesterday I am grateful.

 Finally, since most of you will understand that by our time here it

 of you : Thank you very much indeed.
 22. ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT EISENHOWER, MAY 25, 1960
 [White House press release]
 (As actually delivered)
 My Fellow Americans :
 Tonight I want to talk with you about the remarkable events last
 week in Paris, and their meaning to our future.
 First, I am deeply grateful to the many thousands of you, and to
 representatives in Congress, who sent me messages of encouragement
 and support while I was in Paris, and later upon my return to
 Washington.  Your messages clearly revealed your abiding loyalty
 to America's great purpose-that of pursuing, from a position of
 spiritual, moral, and material strength-a lasting peace with justice.
 You recall, of course why I went to Paris ten days ago.
 Last summer and fall I had many conversations with world leaders;
 some of these were with Chairman Khrushchev, here in America.
 Over those months a small improvement in relations between the
 Soviet Union and the West seemed discernible. A possibility devel-
 oped that the Soviet leaders might at last be ready for serious talks
 about our most persistent problems-those of disarmament, mutual
 inspection, atomic control, and Germany, including Berlin.
 To explore that possibility, our own and the British and French
 leaders met together, and later we agreed, with the Soviet leaders, to
 gather in Paris on May 16.
 Of course we had no indication or thought that basic Soviet policies
 had turned about.  But when there is even the slightest chance of
 strengthening peace, there can be no higher obligation than to pursue
 it.
 Nor had our own policies changed. We did hope to make some
 progress in a Summit meeting, unpromising though previous experi-
 ences had been. But as we made preparations for this meeting, we
 did not drop our guard nor relax our vigilance.
 Our safety, and that of the free world, demand, of course, effective
 systems for gathering information about the military capabilities of
 other powerful nations, especially those that make a fetish of secrecy.
 This involves many techniques and methods. In these times of vast
 military machines and nuclear-tipped missiles, the ferreting out of
 this information is indispensable to free world security.
 This has long been one of my most serious preoccupations.  It is
 part of my grave responsibility, within the overall problem of pro-
 tecting the American people, to guard ourselves and our allies against
 surprise attack.
 During the period leading up to World War II we learned from
 bitter experience the imperative necessity of a continuous gathering
 of intelligence information, the maintenance of military communica-
 tions and contact, and alertness of command.

 250       EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 An additional word seems appropriate about this matter of com-
 munications and command. While the Secretary of Defense and I
 were in Paris, we were, of course, away from our normal command
 posts.  Ile recommended that under the circumstances we test the
 continuing readiness of our military communications.  I personally
 approved. Such tests are valuable and will be frequently repeated in
 the future.
 Moreover, as President., charged by the, Constitution with the con-
 duct of America's foreign relations, and as Commander in Chief,
 charged with the direction of the operations and activities of our
 Armed Forces and their supporting services, I take full responsibility
 for approving all the various programs undertaken by our govern-
 ment to secure and evaluate military intelligence.
 It was in the prosecution of one of these intelligence programs that
 the widely publicized U-2 incident occurred.
 Aerial photography has been one of many methods we have used
 to keep ourselves and the free world abreast of major Soviet military
 developpments. The, usefulness of this work has been well established
 through four years of effort.  The Soviets were well aware of it.
 Chairman Khrushchev has stated that he became aware of these
 flights several years ago.  Only last week, in his Paris press confer-
 ence, Chairman Khrushchev confirmed that he knew of these flights
 when he visited the United States last September.
 Incidentally, this raises the natural c uestion : ~W'hy all the furor
 concerning one particular flight? Ile did not, when in American last
 September charge that these flights were any threat to Soviet safety.
 Ile did not then see any reason to refuse to confer with American
 representatives.
 This he did only about. the flight that unfortunately failed, on May
 1, 1,o.! nside Russia.
 Now, two questions have been raised about this Particular flight;
 first, as to its timing, considering the imminence of tlhe Summit meet-
 ing; second, our initial statements when we learned the flight had
 failed.
 As to the timing, the question was really whether to halt the pro-
 gram and thus forego the gathering of important information that
 was essential and that was likely to be unavailable at a later date.
 The decision was that the program should not be Halted.
 The plain truth is this: when a nation needs intelligence activity,
 there is no time when vigilance can be relaxed.  Incidentally, from
 Pearl Harbor we learned that even negotiation itself can be used to
 conceal preparations for a surprise attack.
 Next, as to our government's initial statement about the flight,
 this was issued to protect the pilot, his mission, and our intelligence
 processes, at a time when the true facts were still undetermined.
 Our first information about the failure of this mission did not
 disclose whether the. pilot was still alive, was trying to escape, was
 avoiding interrogation, or whether both plane and pilot had been
 destroyed.  Protection of our intelligence system and the pilot, and
 concealment of the plane's mission, seemed im erative.  It must be
 remembered that over a long period, these flights had given us in-
 formation of the greatest importance to the Nation's security.  In
 fact, their success has been nothing short of remarkable.

 For these reasons, what is known in intelligence circles as a "cover-
 ing statement" was issued. It was issued on assumptions that.were
 later proved incorrect. Consequently, when later the status of the
 pilot was definitely established, and there was no further possibility
 of avoiding exposure of the project, the factual details were set forth.
 I then made two facts clear to the public : first, our program of
 aerial reconnaissance had been undertaken with my approval; second,
 this government is compelled to keep abreast, by one means or an-
 other, of military activities of the Soviets, just as their government
 has for years engaged in espionage activities in our country and
 throughout the world.  Our necessity to proceed with such activities
 was also asserted by our Secretary of State who however, had been
 careful-as was I-not to say that these particular flights would be
 continued.
 In fact, before leaving Washington, I had directed that these U-2
 flights be stopped. Clearly their usefulness was impaired. Moreover,
 continuing this particular activity in these new circumstances could
 not but complicate the relations of certain of our allies with the
 Soviets.  And, of course,. new techniques, other than aircraft, are
 constantly being developed.
 Now I wanted no public announcement of this decision until I
 could personally disclose it at the Summit meeting in conjunction
 with certain proposals I had prepared for the conference.
 At my first Paris meeting with Mr. Khrushchev, and .before his
 tirade was made public, I informed him of this discontinuance and
 the character of the constructive proposals I planned to make. These
 contemplated the establishment of . a system of aerial surveillance
 operated by the United Nations.
 The day before the first scheduled meeting, Mr. Khrushchev had
 advised President de Gaulle and Prime Minister Macmillan that he
 would make certain demands upon the United States as a precondition
 for beginning a Summit conference. .
 Although. the United States was the only power against which he
 expressed his displeasure, he did. not communicate this information
 tome. I was, of course, informed by our allies.
 At the four power meeting on Monday morning, he demanded of
 the United States four things: First, condemnation of U-2 flights
 as a method of espionage; second, assurance that they would not be
 continued; third, a public apology on behalf of the United States;
 and, fourth, punishment of all those who had any responsibility
 respecting this particular mission.
 I replied by advising the Soviet leader that I had, during the
 previous week, stopped these flights and that they would not be
 resumed.  I offered also to, discuss the matter with him in, personal
 meetings, while the regular business of the Summit might proceed.
 Obviously, I would not respond to his extreme demands. He knew,
 of course, by holding to those demands the Soviet Union was scuttling
 the?Snmmit Conference.
 In torpedoing the conference, Mr. Khrushchev claimed that he "acted
 as the result of his own high moral indignation over alleged American
 acts of aggression.  As I said earlier, he had known of these flights
 for a long time.  It is. apparent that the Soviets had. decided even
 before the Soviet delegation left Moscow that my trip to the Soviet

 T
 Union should be canceled and that nothing constructive from their
 viewpoint would come out of the Summit Conference.
 .In evaluating the results, however, I think we must not write the
 record all in red ink. There are several things to be written in the
 black. Perhaps the Soviet action has turned the clock back in some
 measure, but it should be noted that Mr. Khrushchev did not go
 beyond invective--a time-worn Soviet device to achieve an immediate
 objective. In this case, the wrecking of the Conference.
 On our side, at Paris, we demonstrated once again America's
 willingness, and that of her allies, always too to the extra mile in
 behalf of peace.  Once again, Soviet intransigence reminded us all
 of the unpredictability
 work                of despotic rule, and the need for those who
 for freedom to stand together in determination and in strength.
 The conduct of our allies was magnificent.  My colleagues and
 fr iends-President de Gaulle and Prime Minister Macmillan-stood
 sturdily with the American delegation in spite of persistent Soviet
 attempts to split the Western group~ss, The NATO meeting after the
 Paris Conference showed unprecedented unity and support for the
 alliance and for the position taken at the Summit meeting. I salute
 our allies for us all.

 Arid now, most importantly, what about the future?
 All of us know that, whether started deliberately or accidentally,
 global war would leave civilization in a shambles.                      This is as true
 of the Soviet system as of all others. In a nuclear war there can be
 no victors--only losers.  Even despots understand this. Mr. Klrru-
 shchev stated last week that he well realizes that general nuclear
 war would bring catastrophe for both sides.  Recognition of this
 mutual destructive capability is the basic reality of our present rela-
 tions. Most assuredly, however, this does not mean that we shall ever
 give up trying to build a more sane and hopeful reality-a better
 foundation for our common relations.
 To do this, here are the policies we must follow and to these I am
 confident the great majority of our people, regardless of party, give
 their support:
 First. We must keep up our strength, and hold it steady for the
 long pull-a strength not neglected in complacency nor overbuilt in
 hysteria. So doing, we can make it clear to everyone that there can
 be no gain in the use of pressure tactics or aggression against us
 and our Allies.
 Second. We must continue businesslike dealings with the Soviet
 leaders on outstanding issues, and improve the contacts between our
 own and Soviet peoples, making clear that the path of reason and
 commonsense is still open if the Soviets will but use it,
 Third. To improve world conditions in which human freedom can
 flourish, we must continue to move ahead with positive programs at
 home and abroad, in collaboration with free nations everywhere. In
 doing-so, we shall continue to give our strong support to the United
 Nations and the great principles for which it stands.
 Now as to the First of these purposes--our defenses are sound. They
 are tailored to the situation confronting us.                      -
 ?Theic ade uacy has been my primary concern for these past I
 years-indeed throughout my adult life.

 In no respect have the composition and size of our forces been
 based on or affected by any Soviet blandishment. Nor will they be.
 We will continue to carry forward the great improvements already
 planned in these forces. They will be kept ready-and under con-
 stant review.
 Any changes made necessary by technological advances or world
 events will be recommended at once.
 This strength-by far the most potent on earth-is, I emphasize,
 for deterrent, defensive and retaliatory purposes only, without threat
 or aggressive intent toward anyone.
 Concerning the second part of our policy-relations with the
 Soviets-we and all the world realize, despite our recent disappoint-
 ment, that progress toward the goal of mutual understanding, easing
 the causes of tensions, and reduction of armaments is as necessary
 as ever.
 We shall continue these peaceful efforts, including participation in
 the existing negotiations with the Soviet Union. In these negotiations
 we have made some progress. We are prepared to preserve and build
 on it. The Allied Paris communique and my own statement on re-
 turning to the United States should have made this abundantly clear
 to the Soviet Government.
 We conduct these negotiations not on the basis of surface harmony
 nor are we deterred by any bad deportment we meet. Rather we
 approach them as a careful search for common interests between the
 Western allies and the Soviet Union on specific problems.
 I have in mind, particularly, the nuclear test and disarmament
 negotiations. We shall not back away, on account of recent events,
 from the efforts or commitments that we have undertaken.
 Nor shall we relax our search for new means of reducing the risk
 of war by miscalculation, and of achieving verifiable arms control.

 A major American goal is a world of open societies.
 Here in our country anyone can buy maps and aerial photographs
 showing our cities, our dams, our plants, our highways-indeed, our
 whole industrial and economic complex. We know that Soviet at-
 taches regularly collect this information. Last fall Chairman Khru-
 shchev's train passed no more than a few hundred feet from an opera-
 tional ICBM, in plain view from his window.  Our thousands of
 books and scientific journals, our magazines, newspapers and official
 publications, our radio and television, all openly describe to all the
 world every aspect of our society.
 This is as it should be. We are proud of our freedom.
 Soviet distrust, however, does still remain. To allay these misgiv-
 ings I offered five years ago to open our skies to Soviet reconnaissance
 aircraft on a reciprocal basis. The Soviets refused. That offer is still
 open. At an appropriate time America will submit such a program
 to the United Nations, together with the recommendation that the
 United Nations itself conduct this reconnaissance. Should the United
 N;h ons accept this proposal, I am prepared to propose that America
 duly part of the aircraft and equipment required.

 You may not perhaps be able to see them on your television screens,
 but thee, :white lines in the parking strips around the field are clearly
 discernible from 13 miles up. Those lines are just 6 inches wide.
 Obviously most of the details necessary for a military evaluation of
 the airfield and its aircraft are clearly distinguishable.
 I show you t=his Photagraph as an example of what could be accom-
 plished through United Nations aerial surveillance.
 Indeed, if the United Nations should undertake this policy, this
 program, and the great nations of the world should accept it, I am
 convinced that not only can all humanity be assured that they are safe
 from any surprise attack from any quarter, but indeed the greatest
 tensions of all, the fear of war, would be removed from the world. I
 sincerely hope that the United Nations may adopt such a program.
 As far as we in America are concerned, our programs for increased
 contacts between all peoples will continue. Despite the suddenly ex-
 pressed hostility of the men in the Kremlin, I remain convinced that
 the basic longings of the Soviet people are much like our own. I be-
 lieve that Soviet citizens have a sincere friendship for the people of
 America. I deeply believe that above all else they want a lasting peace
 and a chance for a more abundant life in place of more and more in-
 struments of war.
 Finally turning to the third part of America's policy-the strength-
 ening of ttreedom-we must do far more than concern ourselves with
 military defense against, and our relations with, the Communist bloc.
 Beyond this, we must advance constructive programs throughout the
 world for the betterment of peoples in the newly developing nations.
 The zigs and zaa of the Kremlin cannot be allowed to disturb our
 worldwide  rograms and >urposes. In the period ahead, these pro-
 grams coup well be the decisive factor in our persistent search for
 peace in freedom.
 To the peoples in the newly developing nations urgently needed
 help will surely come. If it. does not come from us and our friends,
 these peoples will be driven to seek it from the enemies of freedom.
 Moreover, those joined with us in defense partnerships look to us for
 proof of our steadfastness. We must not relax our common security
 efforts.
 As to this, there is something specific all of us can do, and right now.
 It is imperative that crippling cuts not be made in the appropriations
 recommended for Mutual Security, whether economic or military.
 We must support this program with all of our wisdom and all of our
 strength. We are proud to call this a nation of the people. With the
 peop a knowing the importance of this program, and making their
 voices heard in its behalf throughout the land, there can be no doubt
 of its continued success.
 Fellow Americans, long ago I pledged to you that I would journey
 anywhere in the world to promote the cause of peace.  I remain
 pledged to pursue a peace of dignity, of friendship, of honor, of
 justice.

 APPENDIX 2
 1. QUESTIONS RAISED BY SENATOR LAUSCIIE AND ANSWERS PREPARED
 BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE
 Question One : To what extent has the Soviet Union been spying
 in the United States, West Germany, and other nations?
 In recent years there has been continued evidence of the exten-
 sive nature of Soviet espionage in the United States, West
 Germany and other nations.  The manner in which the Soviet
 espionage system functions abroad has been clearly set forth in
 the findings of the Royal Commissions in Canada and Australia
 which were set up as a result of the Guzenko and Petrov defec-
 tions.  These commissions established that there was not one but
 at least three parallel Soviet intelligence networks operating in
 Soviet missions abroad : military, state security and party.  To
 these may also be added naval and commercial intelligence net-
 works.  The activities of eleven Soviet officials expelled from the
 United States since 1953 are described in the attached document,
 which was presented to the United Nations by Ambassador
 Henry Cabot Lodge on May 24,1960.
 So far as the espionage activities of non-official Soviet person-
 nel in the United States are concerned, the case of Colonel Ru-
 dolph Ivanovich Abel provides a good example of this type of
 activity. Colonel Abel was convicted by a federal jury in New
 York on October 25, 1957 for conspiring to steal United States
 defense secrets for the Soviet Union.  Abel, a veteran of the
 Soviet intelligence service, had entered the United States in 1948
 under false documents as a United States citizen Andrew Kay-
 otis.  While here he also used the name Emil Goldfus for which
 he had false documents and also documents for a mythical Martin
 Collins.  During his years in the United States and before his
 exposure Abel used a photographer's studio on Fulton Street in
 Brooklyn as a front from which he operated.
 Methods used by Abel and an accomplice, Reino Hayhanen,
 =              were ingenious.  In order to contact his superiors, Hayhanen
 would place chalk marks at various predesignated points.  To
 minimize personal contacts and subsequent danger of compromise
 by surveillances, a system of widely separated "dead drops" and
 "banks" was established throughout the metropolitan area of
 New York.  Abel was also a specialist in artifacts.  In his
 "photographic studio" at the time of his arrest were found both
 the tools and the devices he fashioned for passing messages:
 hollowed-out coins, bolts, jewelry, magnetic containers, and other
 objects in which could be inserted film containing code or plain
 text messages and other material for transmittal.
 American citizens recruited by Soviet espionage agents include
 Julius Rosenberg, Ethel Rosenberg, David Greenglass, Abraham

 T TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 Brotlunan, Miriam Moskowitz, _Morton Sobell, Harry Gold, Kurt
 Ponder, Otto Verber, Jack Soble, Myra Soble, Jacob Albam, and
 others.
 So far as Soviet espionage in West. Germany is concerned, a
 spokesman of the Federal German Republic issued it statement, on
 May 13, 1060, briefly describing the scale on which the Soviet
 Union and other Communist countries practice espionage within
 the territory of the Federal Republic and West, Berlin.  The bul-
 letin of the German Federal Government of May 17, 1960, de-
 scribes this announcement as follows:
 "The spokesman announced that between August 30, 1951, and
 December 31, 1959) more than 18,000 agents of the Soviet. Bloc
 were apprehended in the Federal Republic and Wrest Berlin.  Of
 these, 1,700 were given prison sentences; about 16,500 were ac-
 Suitted because of duress, genuine repentance, or voluntary and
 timely confession.  All these agents confessed to having had
 orders to carry out espionage in the Federal Republic or in West
 Berlin.
 "Exact information was given about the authority from which
 these agents received their orders.  Of the agents apprehended
 in 1959, fully 2,315 admitted hiving worked for the espionage
 service of the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, 264 named the
 Soviet Union as the country from which they had received their
 orders and 462 admitted having received orders front other East-
 Bloc countries. * * * The corresponding figures for 1958 are:
 Soviet zone, 366; Soviet union. 204; of her Communist countries,
 236.
 "In the first quarter of 1960 alone, 588 self-confessed agents of
 the Communist bloc have been apprehended.
 "The extent of Communist espionage activities in the Federal
 Republic and West Berlin alone, and the increase in these activi-
 ties of late, is evident from these figures.  To this must, be added
 that these agents, according to their own confessions, had in each
 case fulfilled more than one es )ion age mission.  The '?64 agents
 of the Soviet Union apprehended in 19.59 had carried out a total
 of 790 single missions; the 2,325 Soviet zone agents of the same
 year had completed it total of 8,234 missions.
 "According to painstaking analysis by the German authorities,
 the Communist countries maintain about 16,000 agents on the soil
 of the Federal Republic and West Berlin, in spite of an annual
 loss of 2,400 to 2,800 such agents.  These figures include agents
 who have carried out only preparatory missions and agents who
 have been hired but not put into service."
 Soviet esj)ionage operatives have also been very active in other
 nations.  '1 he recent testimony of Aleksander Y. Kaznacheev be-
 fore the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on I)eceruber
 14, 1959, provides extensive evidence concerning Soviet espionage
 activities in Asia. Similarly, the testimony of Peter S. Deryabin
 before the House Committee on I'n-American Activities released
 March 17, 1959, provides evidence of Soviet espionage activities
 in Austria.  The testimony of Yuri A. P-astvorov also before the
 Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on February 8, 1956,
 April 12, 1956, October 24, 1956 and October 30, 1956, provide

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE  SUMM IWR1
 evidence of Soviet espionage activities in Japan.  Other cases
 could be given; but it is abundantly clear from the instances al-
 ready cited that Soviet directed espionage activities are worldwide
 and extremely extensive in scope.
 Question Two : How many times it has breached its commitments
 to other nations in the, world-especially the captive nations?
 With regard to the number of times the Soviet Government has
 breached its commitments to other countries, the Department of
 State is not aware of the existence of any statistical compilation.
 A mere count of Soviet violations, whereby, for example, a vio-
 lation leading directly to the subjugation and absorption of an
 entire country by the U.S.S.R. would be given the same numeri-
 cal weight as Soviet infringement of a trade agreement appears,
 in the Department's view, to lack real meaning.  Of course, the
 Department has closely followed over the years the question of
 Soviet treaty violations, which has additionally been the subject
 of close congressional scrutiny as in the Senate Judiciary Com-
 mittee's 1956 Staff Study "Soviet Political Agreements and Re-
 sults" and in the 1950 report of the House Foreign Affairs Com-
 mittee "Background Information on the Soviet Union in
 International Relations."
 "Soviet Treaty Violations," Number 233 (August 10, 1959) in
 the series "Soviet Affairs Notes," describes the principal Soviet
 violations.  Violations occurring before and after the beginning
 of World War II are listed separately and appear under country-
 by-country breakdowns within each of these two main categories.
 A copy of "Soviet Treaty Violations" is enclosed.
 Question Three : Is there a difference between spying by foot on
 land on the one hand, and by plane in the air on the other?
 Considered in the light of the' end purpose of espionage activi-
 ties, which may be summarized as the acquisition of information
 which the state, against which the activities are directed, wishes
 to conceal from the knowledge of one or more foreign powers,
 there would appear to be no fundamental distinction between the
 various means which might be employed in securing such
 information.
 Question Four: Is it in the interest of our country that we abandon
 the general and traditional methods of acquiring intelligence?
 As indicated by the President in his report to the American
 people on May 25, 1960, the security of the United States and of
 the free world "demand, of course, effective systems for gather-
 ing information about the military capabilities of other powerful
 nations, especially those that make a fetish of secrecy.  This in-
 volves many techniques and methods.  In these times of vast
 military machines and nuclear-tipped missiles, the ferreting out
 of this information is indispensable to free world security.  This
 has long been one of my most serious preoccupations.  It is part
 of my grave responsibility, to guard ourselves and our allies
 against surprise attack."
 In the same speech the President reiterated his "open skies"
 offer as a means of guarding against surprise attack.   The Presi-
 dent indicated that the United States would at an appropriate
 time submit a program to the United Nations with a recommen-

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 dation that the United Nations itself conduct aerial reconnais-
 sance.                                         The program outlined by the President offers the best
 hope for guarding the peoples of the world against surprise
 attack.  Unfortunately, the Soviet Government rejected the
 President's earlier "open skies" proposal.  It remains to be seen
 whether the Soviets will reject his more recent suggestion.
 Question Five: If we do so, what are the probabilities of the Soviet
 Union following a similar course?
 In the Department's o inion, even if the United States were to
 abandon the general and traditional methods of acquiring intel-
 ligence, there is little likelihood that the Soviet Union would
 follow a similar course.
 Question Six: WW`h  did the Communists break their treaty with
 the Poles in World WIar 11 and stab the Poles in the back while the
 latter were fighting the Nazis?
 The  olotov-Ribbentrop agreements of August. 23, 1939, pro-
 viding a ten year non-aggression guarantee, furnished a basis for
 coordinated German Auld .Soviet aggression in Eastern Europe.
 Poland was an early victim, falling under Nazi attack only eight
 days after the agreements were signed.  On September 16, 1939
 the U.S.S.R. sent a note to the Polish Government stating that
 the Polish State was insolvent and that the Polish Government.
 had "virtually ceased to operate."  The note claimed that this
 situation might "create it menace to the U.S.S.R."  Using this
 pretext., the U.S.S.R. occupied major parts of Poland on Sep-
 tember 177, 1939. Less than two months later, Molotov boasted :
 "* .* * one swift blow to Poland, first by the German and then by
 the Red Army, and nothing was left of this ugly offspring of the
 Versailles Treaty * * *.11
 Question Seven :   hat are the details concerning the brutal mas-
 sacre of Polish soldiers by the Communists in the hat.yn forests?
 A Select Committee of the House of Representatives made an
 exhaustive study of the Kat yn Forest massacre in 1952, The re-
 ports of this Committee, The Select Committee To Conduct an
 Investigation and Study of the Facts, Evidence, and Circum-
 stances of the Katyn Forest Massacre, contain more detail on this
 subject than is available elsewhere in the Department's files. The
 facts developed by the Committee were brought to the attention
 of the United Nations by the U.S. Delegation, and were given
 wide circulation abroad through the facilities of the United States
 Information Service.
 Question Eight.: Why, in World War II, did the Reds, while ad-
 vancing westward and nearing Poland, induce the Polish people of
 Warsaw to heroically rebel a nrinst the Nazi occupiers and then aban-
 don them to slatghter by the Nazis?
 In various wartime agreements, the allied nations pledged
 themselves to conduct the war against the enemy unrelentinely,
 and to cooperate after the war in plans for recovery.  The
 U.S.S.R., however, had its own plans for postwar Communist
 expansion in Eastern Europe, as evidenced by subsequent devel-
 opments there.  This political motive was an important factor
 influencing Soviet military inaction during the Warsaw uprising.

 Question Nine : Why did the Soviet break its pledged word that
 the people of the satellite nations, under free and open elections, would
 be permitted to choose the type of government they wanted?
 Soviet refusal to grant self-determination to the peoples of the
 satellite nations of Eastern Europe stems from the Soviet cam-
 paign during and after World War II to gain and maintain
 Communist control over these nations.  The United States does
 not regard Soviet domination over the nations of Eastern Europe
 as an acceptable permanent condition of affairs. Regimes in these
 countries have been forcibly imposed and maintained, as in the
 case of Hungary, by repeated Soviet political and military inter-
 vention. The peoples of these countries are denied basic freedoms
 and real national independence.
 Satisfactory solution of the Eastern European problem must
 be based, in keeping with the solemn pledges by the United
 States Soviet, and other Allied Governments during and after
 World War II, upon the right of the Eastern European peoples
 freely (a) to choose the governments and institutions under
 which they will live and (b) to enjoy full national independence
 free from all foreign interference in their internal affairs.
 Question Ten : Why did the Soviet aid and induce the Red Chinese
 to use their military power against South Korea, resulting in death
 and injury to thousands of American boys?
 The Soviet Union supported Communist China in the Korean
 War in order to secure the Soviet satellite government of North
 Korea for the Communist Bloc and, if possible, to expand Com-
 munist power to South Korea and in Asia without instigating
 a world war which would have resulted from the Soviet Union's
 co-belligerency with North Korea.
 Question Eleven : Why did the Soviet encourage the Red Chinese
 in the bombardment and killing of innocent people at the Quemoy
 and Matsu Islands?
 The Soviet Union has consistently supported the, claims of
 Communist China .to Quemoy and Matsu.  During the offshore
 islands crisis, in mid-1954, however, the Soviet leaders spoke of
 "popular" but not Soviet "government" support of the Chinese
 Communists "liberation aspirations" toward the offshore islands.
 At that time they did not threaten to evoke the 1950 Sino-Soviet
 "Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance".  In the
 1958 offshore island crisis Khrushchev did issue the warning that
 "an attack on the People's Republic of China, which is a great
 friend, ally, and neighbor of our country, is an attack on the So-
 viet Union" and that if Communist China fell victim to an atomic
 attack the aggressor would get a rebuff by the same means. The
 Chinese Communists, who have consistently followed aggressive
 policies, probably needed no encouragement to initiate the bom-
 bardment of Quemoy, but it is likely that, prior to the 1958 attack,
 the Red Chinese received some expression of support from the
 Soviet Union.
 Question Twelve : What is the explanation for the mass and merci-
 less murder of the freedom fighters of Hungary, Poland, and East
 Germany, who were fighting for liberation in those respective
 countries?

 The Communist regime in Hungary was forcibly imposed by
 the Soviet Union upon the Huai arnan people at the end of World
 War II.  Since that time, the Hungarian regime has been and
 remains, in all essential matters, Soviet-dominated. Because of
 its origin and nature, it is dependent in the final analysis upon
 Soviet power for its continued ability to exist and to rule. The
 Hungarian uprising was so general and sweeping that it unseated
 this Soviet-dominated regime, attracted large numbers of the
 Hungarian armed forces to either active or passive support of
 the revolutionary movement, and placed temporary control of
 the country in the hands of the Freedom Fighters and of a new
 coalition government headed by Imre - agg y, which supported the
 aims of the revolution.  Confronted by these interna develop-
 ments which clearly pointed to the realization by the Hungarian
 people of their aspiration to live in freedom and independence,
 and fearing the disintegrative effect which a successful Hungarian
 revolt would have on the Soviet Bloc structure, the Soviet T pion
 intervened ruthlessly with massive armed force to crush the re-
 volt and reimpose a Soviet-dominated regime upon the Hun-
 garian people.  Following the Soviet intervention, the new
 Hungariaregime, regime, supported b ? the continued presence of So-
 viet troops within I-Iungary, unfe.rtook a campaign of systematic
 and harsh reprisals against. the leaders and participants in the
 revolt aimed at the suppression of all remaining overt dissent and
 opposition, the re-establishment. and consolidation of its power
 and authority, and the discouragement of any future attempts at
 rebellion.
 In East Germany in 1953 and in Poland in 1956 unrest, occurred
 as a result of popular dissastisfaction with the situation in those
 countries. In contrast to the 1956 events in Hungary, however,
 these disturbances were short-lived and resulted in relatively
 little bloodshed.

 4.    Nikolay Ivanovich Kurochkin
 Kurochkin entered the United States 4 April 1956 as a Third Secretary of the
 Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C.   In the fall of 1956 a professional writer
 contacted the Soviet Embassy seeking statistics as to hosiery production in the
 Soviet Union.    He met Kurochkin, who supplied the desired statistical data and,
 after a series of meetings, informed the writer that if he would obtain military
 information - including training and field manuals of the United States Army - to
 be incorporated in articles Kurochkin was writing for Russian military journals,
 he would share with him his proceeds from the articles.  The writer obtained
 unclassified training and field manuals of the United States Army which he turned
 over to Kurochkin, but did not deliver the classified manuals which Kurochkin had
 requested.  He was paid approximately $450.  On 6 June 1958, Kurochkin was declared
 persona non grata for engaging in activities incompatible with his diplomatic
 status.  He departed from the United States on 11 June 1958-
 5-                                                       Vasiliy Mikhailovich Molev
 From August 1944 through January 1957, Molev served several tours of duty in
 the United States, occupying positions of chauffeur and property custodian to the
 Soviet Consulate General in New York and property custodian at the Soviet Embassy,
 Washington, D.C.   Boris Morros, an admitted Soviet agent co-operating with the FBI,
 was instructed by his Soviet superiors to appear in the vicinity of 58 West
 58th Street, New York City, at 3 p.m. on the first Tuesday of each month for
 contact by his Soviet principal.   If the contact was not made, Morros was
 instructed by the Soviets to return the following Wednesday and Thursday.   On
 Wednesday, 7 January 1953, Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
 observed Molev in the vicinity of 58 West 58th Street, New York City.   Morros was
 later instructed by his Soviet principal to meet his Soviet contact on Tuesday,
 3 March 1953, on the corner of Central Park South and Avenue of the Americas, New
 York City.  On 3 March 1953, Molev was observed by Special Agents of the Federal
 Bureau of Investigation meeting with Morros at Central Park South and Avenue of the
 Americas.   On this occasion Morros passed to Molev a report previously obtained
 from Jack Soble, Morros' immediate superior, who was-subsequently convicted of
 espionage.  On 25 January 1957, Jack Soble, Myra Soble, and Jacob Albam were

 arrested on charges of espionage and conspiracy.  Simultaneously, Molev was
 declared persona non grata because of his implication in the conspiracy.  He
 departed the United States 28 January 1957-
 6.                                   Aleksandr Petrovich Kovalev
 Kovalev arrived in the United States 8 October 1950as a Second Secretary of
 the Soviet Delegation to the United Nations.  In the course of his stay in the
 United States Kovalev arranged to receive undeveloped microfilms of materials of
 intelligence significance at a drop area in New York City.  The recruited agent
 was told to park his car in a designated area in Nev York City at a designated
 time and to place a package wrapped in red paper therein so that it could be seer
 through the rear window in the event material was to be passed.  An additional
 signal by way of marking a telephone directory in a New York restaurant was
 perfected to indicate to the agent that the material delivered to the dead drop
 was picked up.  Material of intelligence significance was left by the recruited
 agent in the New York dead drop area and it was retrieved by Kovalev.  The agent
 was given $500 to purchase an electronic device for delivery to the Soviets an
 additional $500 in payment for delivery of a microfilm reproduction of portions cf
 a manual dealing with an automatic steering device for ships.  Kovalev was declared
 persona non grata by the Department of State for his actions in this case on
 3 February 1954 and he departed the United States 10 February 1954.
 7.   Colonel IYleksim Grigorievich Martynov
 Martynov entered the United States on 3 November 1954  as a member of the
 Soviet representation to the United Nations Military Staff Co?ittee.  In
 August 1954, a Soviet national met a United Stater Army officer in Germany.  The
 Soviet national, aware of the officer's plan to retire from the Army, asked him to
 be of assistance in obtaining Military Manuals from the Army Command and General
 Staff School at Leavenworth, Kansas when the Soviet national came to the United
 States.  Meetings in New York City were arranged and a code phrase was established
 for recognition purposes.
 On 15 November 1954, a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
 made up to resemble the Army officer, was contacted at the agreed time and place

 in New York City by Martynov.  Prearranged signals were exchanged and they talked
 for approximately thirty minutes.  Martynov indicated he was a friend of the
 Soviet National who contacted the officer in Germany and he asked for the proposed
 assistance, paying him $250.  A subsequent meeting was scheduled for
 15 January 1955?   On that date, Martynov kept the appointment and the FBI agents
 accosted him.  Martynov identified himself and claimed diplomatic immunity.  on
 21 February 1955, the Department of State expelled Martynov for the above activity
 and he departed the United States 26 February 1955.
 8.   Viktor Ivanovich Petrov
 Petrov arrived in the United States 17 February 1953 as a transistor employed
 at the United Nations Secretariat, New York City.   Petrov responded to an
 advertisement placed in a New York newspaper by an aviation draftsman for part-
 time work.  The draftsman was an employee of one of our largest aircraft factories.
 At the outset, Petrov gave the draftsman insignificant drafting work, later asking
 him to send for various brochures on aviation.   Petrov requested the draftsman to
 obtain information concerning United States Military Aircraft.  The information
 sought was classified, it concerned the status-of United States aircraft
 development.   On 20 August 1956, information concerning Petrov's activities was
 brought to the attention of the Secretary-General of the United Nations as a
 result of which Petrov's employment at the United Nations was terminated.  Petrov
 departed the United States on 23 August 1956.
 Gladkov entered the United States 15 December 1953 as Naval Advisor to the
 Soviet Representation in the Military Staff Committee of the United Nations.
 Gladkov met a sales engineer for a New York City Marine Engineering firm at a
 cocktail party.  He cultivated the sales engineer and held a number of clandestine
 meetings with him.  Through the engineer, Gladkov attempted to obtain information
 relating to United States developments and progress in the field of marine engine
 design and operation and informed the American citizen that he, Gladkov, had
 access to fund of money for the purchase of sensitive and classified information
 on new developments in the field of design and operation of power plants on

 a large sum of money for, publications dealing with fleet training.  During his
 meetings with the sales engineer which continued on a regular basis Gladkov
 furnished the engineer $1,550.  on 22 June 1956, the Department of State expelled
 Gladkov for engaging in activities which were incompatible with his status as a
 member of the Soviet Delegation to the United Nations.  He departed 12 July 1956.
 10.  Lieutenant Colonel Leonid Yegorovich Pivnev
 Pivnev entered the United States on 17 March 1950 as Assistant Soviet Air
 Attache.   Pivnev endeavoured to utilize a Washington businessman's address as a
 mail drop.  He explained to the businessman that he would have mail delivered to
 him at the businessman's address, which mail was to be addressed to a fictitious
 person and which, upon receipt, was to be delivered by the businessman to him.
 On 24 March 1954, he inquired at a Virginia aerial photographic concern as
 to the possibility of purchasing aerial maps of Chicago, Illinois.  He instructed
 the firm to seek such maps and agreed to pay approximately $8,000 for them.  On
 that date he purchased thirty-three aerial photographs of Washington, D.C. and
 vicinity.  Pivnev, in contacting this firm, identified himself as one "George".
 On 3 May 1954, he contacted a Washington, D.C. photographer, introducing himself
 as a Mr. George Tinney, a representative of a private firm desirous of purchasing
 aerial photographs of the New York City area at a sca..e of 1:20,000 to
 1:40,000 feet.  Photographs of this type were not commercially available.  On
 13 May 1954, he agreed to pay the photographer $700 to obtain the photographs.
 He advanced on that date the sum of $400 as partial payment.  On 20 May 1954,
 when meeting with the photographer for the purpose of obtaining the photographs,
 he was accosted by special agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on which
 occasion he identified himself.  On 29 May 1954, the Department of State declared
 Pivnev persona non grata and he departed 6 June 1954.

 Kirilyuk arrived in the United States 11 September 1958 as a political
 affairs officer employed by the Department of Trusteeship and Information for
 Non-Self-Governing Territories, United Nations Secretariat.   In April 1959, an
 American citizen contacted a Soviet official in Mexico City concerning the
 possibility of obtaining a Soviet university scholarship.  The Soviet official
 obtained complete background information from the American, including the facts
 concerning his previous assignment in cryptographic machines and systems while
 serving in the United States Army.   Following his return to the United States,
 the American was contacted by Kirilyuk, who identified himself as one "George".
 During the period from June through September 1959, Kirilyuk met with the American
 in a clandestine manner on five occasions.   On these occasions he requested data
 concerning cryptographic machines and instructed the American to seek employment
 with a vital United States Government agency.  Information concerning Kirilyuk's
 activities was brought to the attention of the Secretary-General of the
 United Nations whereupon Kirilyuk's employment at the United Nations was
 terminated.  Kirilyuk and his family left the United States on 10 January 1960.

 CONFERENCE
 1. -RiTRODUCTION
 The Soviet
 and oya   observed thefeIn International obligattiowhich~it has assumed. The
 scrupulous observance by the Soviet Union of the treaties and agreements which
 Its representatives have signed is recognized even by those who are unfavorably
 disposed toward It.
 --S. Krylov, Professor of International Law, Moscow State University,
 (Izvestiya, may 26, 1957.)
 Few nations can match the UWR In vociferous protestations of loyalty to international
 obligations. However, such declarations -which are typical of Soviet
 scholars alike - diverge widely from actual Soviet practice. In the yearrs siicee t  Hoek
 Revolution the Soviet Government, while consistently accusing others of bad faith in inter-
 national dealings, has not hesitated to violate its own treaty obligations when such action
 appeared to be in its interest.
 Like most totalitarian states, the Soviet Union recognizes the respect in which legal
 principles are held by the vast majority of countries of the world. Soviet textbooks in
 international law profess the standard principle of 21   q  t
 observed), though                                                  (treaties must be
 stressing at the same time that cap talist sta s violate treaties as a
 normal rule. The latter claim in turn paves the way for any necessary justification of
 treaty violations by the Soviet Union, since the Soviet Government habitually accuses the
 other party of violation as an excuse for Its own nonobservance of a given convention. A
 1951 text in International law, for example, describes the "nullification" by the Soviet
 Government of its 1932 nonaggression pact with Finland as "Unquestionably correct and
 fully justified, " since this act was "the result of systematic and provocatory breaches of
 the obligations of the stated pact by the Finnish aide. "i The facts of the case were quite
 the reverse.
 While Soviet writers tend to be circumspect In discussing treaty obligations their
 approach to international law in general may be somewhat more revealing of the soviet
 attitude. International law, as seen by Soviet theorists, is essentially an Instrument of
 policy, and Its institutions and practices are employed to the extent that they are useful.
 The matter is put succinctly in one Soviet textbook by Professor Kozhevnikov: p1

 Although the Soviet Union does not specifically extend this principle to the observance
 of treaties, in practice the mental transition is not a difficult one. The peace treaty of
 Brest Litovsk, the first treaty concluded by the Soviet regime, was signed In order to
 gain whatever protection it might afford, but without any intention on the Soviet side of
 abiding by the treaty's provisions.  "Yes, of course we are violating the treaty, " de-
 clared Lenin in March 1918,  we have already violated it 30 or 40 times." 1
 Later Soviet leaders have hesitated to speak so bluntly, but the history of the last
 40 years provides numerous examples of deliberate treaty violations by the Soviet regime.
 A cursory examination of the public conventions entered into by the Soviet Union during
 this period reveals well over 50 violations. The USSR has disregarded treaty provisions
 inconvenient to itself, has unilaterally denounced conventions to which it was a party,
 has threatened abrogation as a means of intimidation, and has on several occasions
 attacked fellow signatories to treaties of friendship and non-aggression. The cases in
 this study are some of the more outstanding instances of these practices.
 II. PREWAR AGREEMENTS
 Treaties of the Soviet Union are based on principles of equality,
 sovereignty and mutual benefits of states, while treaties of bourgeois
 countries are based on the principle of the strong over the weak.
 --V.I. Lisovskil, Mezhdunarodnoe Pravo [International LaW/,
 Kiev University Press, 1956, p. 228.
 Violation of the Ke iogg-Briand Pact 1929
 The Soviet Union adhered to the Kellogg-Briand Pact in September 1928 upon
 invitation of the original signatory powers, thereby renouncing war as an instrument of
 national policy. Adherence to the pact, however, failed to deter the USSR from employ-
 ing force against its eastern neighbor, China, in the following year.
 Notwithstanding its self-proclaimed policy of "anti-imperialism, " the Soviet
 Union had retained ownership and control of the Chinese Eastern Railroad, inherited
 from the Tsarist regime. Chinese resentment at this survival of Russian domination
 in Manchuria, coupled with irritation at subversive activities directed from Soviet
 diplomatic establishments in China, resulted, in 1929, in confiscation of the railroad
 by the Chinese and the arrest of a number of Soviet employees. The Soviet Government
 rebuffed attempts to settle the dispute by diplomatic means, preferring to employ its
 clearly superior military power to force a return to the statusguo ante. In October
 and November 1929 Soviet troops, supported by aircraft and gunboats, invaded
 Manchuria and secured the capitulation of the Chinese after the latter had lost some
 6,000 men in a brief and futile resistance. Efforts by the United States and other
 Western powers to invoke the Kellogg-Briand Pact and to encourage a settlement
 by peaceful means were brusquely rejected by the Soviet Government.
 The Litvinov Acrreements
 In 1933 the United States recognized the Government of the USSR following
 negotiations and an exchange of letters between Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov and
 President Roosevelt in regard to various outstanding differences between the two
 countries. In his letter of November 16, 1933, Litvinov stated:
 Approved For Release 2005/08/22 : CIA-RDP66B00403R000500120001-1
 prov  EFWSR    IR- 09 lgE2.~'CAII RDDP66B00 C03R000500120001-1
 it will be the fixed policy of the Government of the Union of Soviet
 Socialist Republics...not to permit the formation or residence on its
 territory of any organization or group -- and to prevent the activity on
 Its territory of any group or organization -- which has as an aim the
 overthrow or the preparation for the overthrow of, or the bringing about
 by force of a change in  the political or social order of the whole or
 any part of the United Sitates, its territories or possessions.
 The Foreign Minister's avowal produced no effect whatever upon the activities of
 the Third International, or Comintern, which continued to carry out its role as the
 organizer and directing center of the world communist movement from its Moscow head-
 5uarters. The purpose of the Comintern clearly defined in Its statutes and theses, was
 the struggle by all available means, tncfuding armed forces, for the overthrow of the
 international bourgeoisie and the creation of an international Soviet Republic."
 Although the Comintern was formally dissolved in 1943, Soviet-inspired communist
 activity In the United States continued unabated. Evidence of systematic violation of the
 Litvinov agreements after 1945 was brought to light by convictions under the US Alien
 Registration Act of 1940, which made it a criminal offense "to organize or help to organize
 any society, group or assembly of persons who teach, advocate or encourage the over-
 throw or destruction of any Government in the United States by force or violence." The
 trial and conviction in 1949 In a US Federal Court in New York of 11 communist leaders
 revealed that the American Communist Party, acting upon orders of the Soviet Union
 Issued by Dmitri Manullsky, Comintern leader and in 1949 Foreign Minister of the
 Ukrainian SSR, had returned to a policy of violent revolution.
 The Litvinov agreements also contained the following provision, as stated by
 Litvinov in another letter to President Roosevelt on November 16, 1933:
 .the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,
 while reserving to itself the right of refusing visas to Americans de-
 siring to enter the Union of Soviet Socialist Republicson personal
 grounds, does not intend to base such refusals on the fact of such
 persons having ecclesiastical status.
 In March 1955 the Soviet Government expelled the Reverend Georges Bissonette,
 the most recent in a succession of clergymen of the Assumptloalst Order who had resided
 in Moscow and ministered to the spiritual needs of American nationals of the Roman
 Catholic faith in Moscow. The Soviet Government refused entry to the Reverend Louis
 Dion as successor to Father Bissonette on the grounds that the Litvinov-Roosevelt
 agreement provided for reciprocity in the admission of clergymen to the respective
 countries. Although the 1933 agreement contained no provision to this effect -- of
 which the Soviet Union's failure to make any such claims in the intervening years was
 itself tacit admission -- the Soviet Government continued to bar Father Dion for nearly
 four years. He was finally admitted in January 1959, after repeated representations by
 the United States to the Soviet Government.
 Invasion of Poland . 1939
 On July 25, 1932, the Soviet Union and Poland signed a treaty of non-aggression.
 The treaty was extended by the protocol of May 5  1934  and was reaffirmed by the
 statements of November 28, 1938. Article 1 of tie 199 non-aggression pact stated:
 The two Contracting Parties, recording the fact that they have
 renounced war as an instrument of national policy in their mutual
 relations, reciprocally undertake t6refrain from any aggressive
 action against or Invading the territory of the other Party, separately

 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE     27t
 In September 1939, less than 12 months after having reaffirmed this treaty, the
 Soviet Union invaded Poland. The territory of the Polish state was divided with Nazi
 Germane. The Soviet Government coolly explained its act of aggression in these words:
 "The Polish State and its government have virtually ceased to exist. Treaties con-
 cluded between the USSR and Poland have thereby lost their validity. "
 Foreign Minister Molotov, speaking to an extraordinary session of the USSR
 Supreme Soviet on October 31, 1939, gloated over the easy conquest of Poland.  "The
 ruling circles of Poland he said, "were very proud of the 'durability' of their govern-
 ment and the 'might' of their army. Nevertheless, it turned out that a quick blow
 against Poland, first by the German Army and then by the Red Army, sufficed to leave
 nothing remaining of the ugly offspring of the Versailles Treaty. "
 The Attack on Finland
 By the Treaty of Peace between the Soviet Union and Finland, concluded in October
 1920, the Soviet Government recognized the independence and sovereignty of Finland,
 and both parties agreed "to maintain for the future an attitude of peace and goodwill
 towards one another." On January 21, 1932, the Soviet Union and Finland signed a
 treaty of nonaggression, which, on April 7, 1934, was renewed for 10 years. Finland,
 seemingly, could also take comfort from the fact that the Soviet Union, by adherence
 to the Kellogg-Briand Pact, had renounced war as an instrument of national policy
 and had joined the League of Nations in September 1934. Article 12 of the League
 Covenant required that disputes be submitted to the League for arbitration and enquiry,
 and that neither party should resort to war until three months after the award of the
 arbiters or the report of the Council.
 In October 1939 the Soviet Government, summoning a Finnish representative
 to Moscow, presented to Finland a series of demands, including cession of territory
 and disarming of zones along the Finnish-Soviet border. The Finns were disinclined
 to accede to the Soviet "proposals, " and negotiations reached a deadlock. On November
 28, 1939, the Soviet Union announced the abrogation of its nonaggression pact with
 Finland after a "frontier incident" and rejected a Finnish proposal for a commission
 of enquiry. On November 29, the Soviet Union attacked Finland without a declaration
 of war. Thirty Red Army divisions crossed the frontier, towing in their wake a
 "Finnish People's Government, " headed by former Comintern secretary Otto Kuusinen.
 The puppet regime, which established itself at Terijoki near the Soviet border, was
 recognized by the USSR on December 7. as the legitimate government of Finland. On
 December 4 Molotov, responding to a communication from the League of Nations, stated:
 The Soviet Union is not at war with Finland and does not threaten
 the Finnish people. The Soviet Union maintains peaceful relations with
 the Democratic Republic of Finland.
 Under the terms exacted from Finland by the Treaty of Peace of March 12, 1940,
 the Soviet Union annexed the Karelian Isthmus and other Finnish territory. By the later
 peace treaty of February 10, 1947, the Soviet Union secured additional Finnish territory
 as a prize for its re-invasion of Finland in 1941.
 The Fate of the Baltic States
 Like Finland, the three Baltic republics. had been officially assured of Soviet
 friendship and peaceful intentions. As stated in the nearly identical language of the 1920
 peace treaties:
 Russia unreservedly recognizes the independence and autonomy
 of the State of Estonia [Latvia, Lithuania], and renounces voluntarily
 and forever all rights of sovereignty formerly held by Russia...

 72       EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 These professions of good faith were reinforced by treaties of nonaggression and
 peaceful settlement signed by the Soviet Union with each of the three countries. The
 text of the treaty with Estonia stated:
 Article 1. Both High Contracting Parties mutually guarantee the
 inviolability of the frontiers existing between them... and undertake
 to refrain from any act of aression or any violent measures directed
 against the Integrity and invggiolability of the territory or against the
 political independence of the Other Contracting Party, whether such
 act of aggression or such violent measures are undertaken separately
 or together with other powers, with or without a declaration of war...
 This treaty, virtually Identical to those signed with Latvia and Lithuania, was by
 1939 a doubtful indicator of true Soviet intentions toward these countries. A secret
 protocol to the Nazi-Soviet Pact, signed August 23; 1939. placed Estonia and Latvia
 within the Soviet sphere of Interest. A second treaty, with secret protocols, on
 September 28 transferred Lithuania to the Soviet sphere in exchange for additional
 Polish territory for Germany.
 On September 29  1939, the Soviet Union compelled Estonia to sign a pact of mutual
 assistance. Latvia ana Lithuania signed similar treaties on October 5 and 10, respective-
 ly. The USSR received leases on military bases and port installations and the right to
 maintain armed forces on the territories of the states concerned.
 Its immediate object achieved, the Soviet Union once again gave guarantees to
 its small neighbors. Clause V of the Estonian and Latvian treaties stated:
 The entry into force of this pact shall in no way infringe upon the
 sovereign rights of the Contracting Parties, particularly their economic
 system and social structure.
 Clause VII of the Lithuanian treaty stated in more specific terms:
 Entry Into force of this pact shall not affect to any extent the
 sovereign rights of the Contracting Parties, in particular their state
 organization, economic and social systems, military measures and,
 in general, the principle of noninterference in internal affairs.
 Further assurances were provided by Foreign Minister Molotov in a speech to the
 USSR Supreme Soviet on October 31, 1939:
 We stand for the scrupulous and punctilious observance of the
 pacts on the basis of complete reciprocity and we declare that all
 the nonsensical talk about the Sovietization of tits Baltic countries
 is only to the interest of our common enemies.?
 On June 15 and 16, 1940, Estonia Latvia and Lithuania were occupied by Soviet
 troops. On July 21 the three states, following the forced resignation of their governments,
 were incorporated into the USSR.

 Soviet Treaty Violations in Iran
 Soviet obligations toward Iran were governed by wartime agreements as well as
 by the Soviet-Iranian Treaty of Friendship, still in force, concluded on February 26, 1921.
 Included in the Treaty of Friendship was a mutual undertaking by each party "to abstain
 from any Intervention in the internal affairs of the other." The stationing of British
 and Soviet forces in Iran during the Second World War was regulated by the Tripartite
 Treaty of Alliance concluded by the two powers with Iran on January 29, 1942. Article
 V of this treaty stated:
 The forces of the Allied Powers shall be withdrawn from Iranian
 territory not later than six months after all hostilities between the
 Allied Powers and Germany and her associates have been suspended
 by the conclusion of an armistice or armistices or on the conclusion
 of a peace treaty between them, whichever date is the earlier...
 In Article IV of the same treaty, Britain and the Soviet Union agreed "to disturb as
 little as possible the administration and the security forces of Iran the economic life
 of the country, and the application of Iranian laws and regulations. i'
 On December 1, 1943, during the Tehran Conference, the Big Three issued a
 communique stating: "The Governments of the United States, the USSR, and the United
 Kingdom are at one with the Government of Iran In their desire for the maintenance of
 the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Iran." Later, in a letter of
 September 20, 1945, Foreign Minister Molotov reaffirmed Soviet obligations under the
 Tripartite Treaty:
 As regards the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran,
 the Soviet Government, as you are aware, takes the view that this
 withdrawal of troops should be effected within the period laid down
 in the Anglo-Soviet-Iranian Treaty.
 Notwithstanding these various commitments, the Soviet Union began to promote
 rebellion in the northern area of Iran occupied by Soviet troops.  Disturbances broke out
 in the fall of 1945 in the Soviet-controlled Iranian province of Azerbaijan. Rebels,
 equipped with Soviet arms and led by the Iranian Communist Pishevari, were aided by
 Soviet agents who crossed into Iran. On December 12, 1945, the rebels proclaimed the
 Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan. Red Army troops provided full protection and pre-
 vented Iranian troops from reaching the scene. Shortly afterwards rebels in the neighboring
 Kurdish province, carrying Soviet arms and wearing Soviet uniforms, proclaimed an
 independent Kurdish republic. In Azerbaijan, Pishevari broadcast his thanks to the Red
 Army for its assistance. Although the Iranian Government appealed to the United Nations,
 the rebels remained in control and Soviet troops failed to leave by the agreed date of March
 2, 1946.

 In April 1945 Iranian Premier 4avam, who had gone to Moscow to attempt a

 to the
 establishment of a joint Soviet -Iranian oil company (Russia holding 61 percent of the
 stock) for exploitation of oil In northern Iran. On May 9, 1948, Red Army forces were
 withdrawn from Iran, more than two months after the deadline. Subsequently the
 Iranian Premier under strong pressure at home, dismit;sed the Communists from
 the cabinet. In November 1946 the Iranian Government sent troops into the northern
 provinces and the rebel regimes in Azerbaijan collapsed on December 15, 1948. On
 October 2L, 1947, the Iranian Majlls refused to ratify the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement. I

 The Soviet Union concluded an essentially similar treaty of alliance and mutual aid with
 France on December 10, 1944.
 The Soviet Union unilaterally abrogated both these treaties in early 1955. The
 action was one aspect of a Soviet campaign to prevent the ratification of the Paris agree-
 ments, which terminated the occupation of Western Germany and brought the newly
 formed Federal Republic into NATO. Soviet notes to France and Britain in December
 1954 contained warnings that their respe,;tive alliances would be annulled if the Paris
 agreements were ratified. On May 7, 1955, having failed to prevent ratification, the
 Soviet Union officially annulled its wartime alliances.
 The Countries of East rn Eurore
 In February 1945 the heads of government of the United States, the United Kingdom,
 and the Soviet Union, meeting at Yalta, Issued a Declaration on Liberated Europe in which
 they agreed to assist the liberated peoples to set up "democratic Institutions of their own
 choice,  in furtherance of the principles of the Atlantic Charter. Specifically, the three
 governments agreed to assist the liberated people
 to form interim governmental authorities broadly representative of
 all democratic elements in the population and pledge I to the earliest
 possible establishment through free elections of governments responsive
 to the will of the people.. .
 These provisions were rendered meaningless by Soviet policies in those territories
 liberated by the Red Army. Ignoring the Yalta commitments, the Soviet Union, in a now
 familiar pattern, installed communist-dominated regimes in Hungary, Bulgaria, and
 Rumania. In Rumania acting through Its own authorities and through the Rumanian
 communist Party, the USSR deliberately prevented the exercise of democratic rights by
 the people. In February 1945 Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky arrived in Bucharest to
 dictate the dismissal of the Radescu Government and the Imposition of the communist-
 dominated Groza regime. Direct interference by Soviet authorities -- including the use
 of troops -- In the elections of November 1948 was only one of the many further Instances
 of Soviet violation of the declaration.

 Similar Soviet actions occurred in Hungary and Bulgaria. In Hungary, for example,
 General Sviridov, Deputy Chairman of the Allied Control Commission, unilaterally dis-
 solved Catholic youth organizations in June 1946 and in the following year forced the
 resignation of Prime Minister Ferenc Nagy. Contrary to commitments made at Potsdam
 on August 2, 1945 that directives of the Allied Control Commissions would be issued by
 the Soviet Chairmen "after agreement on these directives with the English and American
 representatives,"1 Soviet representatives on the Commissions in Rumania; Hungary,
 and Bulgaria consistently issued unilateral instructions in the name of the Commission
 and thwarted the activities of the British and American representatives even to the point
 of restricting their freedom of movement.
 In regard to Poland, the Big Three at Yalta agreed as follows:
 The Provisional Government which is now. functioning in Poland should
 therefore be reorganized on a broader democratic basis with the inclusion
 of democratic leaders from Poland itself and from Poles abroad....
 This Polish Provisional Government of National Unity shall be pledged
 to the holding of free and unfettered elections as soon as possible on the
 basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot. In these elections all
 democratic and anti-Nazi parties shall have the right to take part and to
 put forward candidates.
 That the Soviet Union had little intention of observing this agreement became evident
 almost immediately, when, on April 21. 1945, it concluded a formal treaty of alliance
 with the so-called "Lublin Government, "2 Which had been organized in the Soviet Union
 and moved into Poland behind Soviet troops.
 Nevertheless, at Potsdam the Soviet Union once again voiced its adherence to the
 principles of democracy. The Potsdam Protocol stated:
 The three powers note that the Polish Provisional Government, in
 accordance with the decisions of the Crimea Conference, has agreed
 to the holding of free and unfettered elections as soon as possible on
 the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot In which all democratic
 and anti-Nazi parties shall have the right to take part and to put forward
 candidates.
 The Polish Provisional Government was nominally a coalition, but in fact its key
 positions were occupied by Communists, who had established themselves in the period
 of "liberation" by the Red Army.  Electiops were postponed until January 1947 in order
 to terrorize and eliminate the opposition.  Representations by the United States and
 United Kingdom to the Polish Provisional Government calling attention to the obligations
 of Yalta and Potsdam were rejected. The Soviet Union refused to join the two Western
 powers in their approach on this matter to the Polish Government.

 Germany
 In Germany the USSR has distorted and violated numerous provisions of wartime
 and postwar agreements with the Western powers. The subject is too complex for
 detailed discussion here, but two major sets of agreements may be noted: the agree-
 ments reached at Potsdam and embodied in the-Potsdam Protocol, and the agreements
 on the occupation and control of Germany
 1. The Potsdam Protocol of Au g= 1  1945
 The Protocol contained a statement of common Allied objectives
 looking towar   a  velopment of democracy in postwar Germany. Among the political
 principles agreed upon were the following:
 The judicial system will be reorganized in accordance with
 the principles of democracy, of justice under law, and of equal rights
 for all citizens...
 ...local self-government shall be restored throughout Germany
 on democratic prir.clples...
 all democratic political parties with rights of assembly and
 of public discussion shall be allowed and encouraged throughout Germany...
 ..Subject to the necessity for maintaining military security,
 freedom of speech, press and religion shall be permitted, and re-
 ligious institutions shall be respected. Subject likewise to the
 maintenance of military security, the formation of free trade unions
 shall be permitted.
 The Soviet Union, in its administration of East Germany, has violated these
 principles both in spirit and in letter. In 1948 the Soviet authorities forced the merger
 of the Socialist Party of Germany with the Communist Party of Germany, forming the
 SED or Socialist Unity Party, with the aim of 'capturing" the Socialist voters of Berlin
 and the East Zone. Although they did not succeed in taking control of the SPD of Berlin,
 they were able to veto the election of the SPD leader Ernst Reuter as Governing Mayor
 of Berlin in June 1947. In the Eastern Zone of Germany the so-called German
 Democratic Republic was set up in October 1949 by Soviet order, without prior dis-
 cussion or free elections. The regime's first elections, held in the following year,
 were of the single-list variety carried on under the "bloc-party" system and the National
 Front, a communist cover organization.
 Individual liberties, though ostentatiously displayed in the East German Consti-
 tution, have never been protected. Soviet military forces cooperated with the East
 German regime in putting down the uprisings and strikes which occurred in June 1953.
 The free flow of information and free expression essential to democratic life has not
 been permitted in the East Zone, and Western radio transmissions have been extensively
 jammed.
 Fc,       Policies. The Potsdam Protocol provided both for reparations from
 Germany an  o measures of essential economic reconstruction. It was understood and
 agreed at Potsdam that successful implementation of these measures required coopera-
 tion and "common policies" in regard to basic economic functions. The Protocol
 stated specifically.
 ..During the period of occupation Germany shall be treated as
 a single economic unit.
 Almost from the beginning the Soviet authorities obstructed efforts to Implement
 this principle. In their own zone they pursued a unilateral economic policy and raised

 barriers to the flow of trade across zonal borders. Western suggestions, such as that
 to place manufactures from East Germany in a common pool in order to cover the cost
 of essential imports, were defeated by Soviet delaying tactics. Depending traditionally
 upon food from Eastern Germany, the area under United States control was able to
 survive by means of extensive American subsidy.
 An essential aspect of the over-all economic problem was the question of
 reparations. The Potsdam Protocol stated:
 .In addition to the reparations to be taken by the USSR from Its
 own zone of occupation, the USSR shall receive additionally from the
 Western Zones:
 (a) 15 percent of such usable and complete industrial capital equipment...
 as Is unnecessary for the German peace economy and should be removed
 from the Western Zones of Germany, in exchange for an equivalent value
 of food, coal, potash, zinc, timber, clay products, petroleum products,
 and such other commodities as may be agreed upon.
 (b) 10 percent of such industrial capital equipment as is unnecessary for
 the German peace economy and should be removed from the Western
 Zones, to be transferred to the Soviet Government on reparations
 account without payment or exchange of any kind in return.
 Also,
 .Payment of reparations should leave enough resources to
 enable the German people to subsist without external assistance.
 In working out the economic balance of Germany the necessary means
 must be provided to pay for imports approved by the Control
 Council in Germany. The proceeds of exports from current pro-
 duction and stocks shall be available in the first place for payment
 for such imports. [,This was not to apply to equipment and products,
 noted above, received as additional reparations by the USSR from
 the Western zones.
 No effort was made by the Soviet Union to abide by these provisions. In their
 own zone Soviet authorities not only refused to account for reparations exacted but also
 removed large quantities from current production, thus preventing the use of these
 commodities for payment for necessary imports. Moreover, the Soviet Union failed
 to make deliveries of food, coal, potash, zinc, timber and other raw materials from
 its own zone in exchange for shipments of industrial equipment from the Western zones.
 By contrast, the United States, between March 31 and August 1, 1946, had made ship-
 ments from Its zone to the USSR of 11, 100 tons of reparation equipment. After con-
 tinued Soviet failure to meet these obligations, the United States suspended reparations
 deliveries until such time as the USSR would be willing to implement fully the provisions
 of the Protocol.
 Demilitarization. The Potsdam Protocol provided for the "complete dis-
 armament and demilitarization" of Germany. Provisions to this end Included the following:
 All German land, naval and air forces-and all other military
 and quasi-military organizations, together with all clubs and
 associations which serve to keep alive the military traditions in
 Germany, shall be completely and finally abolished in such manner
 as permanently to prevent the revival or reorganization of German
 militarism and Nazism.
 In 1948 Soviet authorities began building up a sizeable "police force" in the Soviet
 Zone. In May 1950 the United States protested this process of remilitarization, pointing
 out that some 40,000 to 50,000 members of the so-called "Police Alert Units," equipped

 with Soviet weapons, were receiving infantry, armored and artillery training. At the
 end of 1953 the Soviet Zone's "police force numbered 100,000 men (for a population
 of 17 millloi, with an additional 140 200 military personnel, including 3 mechanized
 divisions and air units. By June 1959 East German military and paramilitary forces
 totalled more than 700,000 mn.1
 E                  The conference at Potsdam also considered the question
 of the future German -   ish boundary, and included the following statement in the
 Protocol.
 The three Heads of Government reaffirm their opinion that the
 final delimitation of the Western frontier of Poland should await the
 peace settlement.
 On July 6, 1950, an agreement was signed between the Soviet-controlled regimes
 of Poland and East Germany fixing the Oder-Netsse as the fefinitive frontier between
 Poland and Germany.
 2. Occupation andControl of Germany
 and the United Kingdom On September 12, 1944, representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States
 was amended subsequently signed include Protocol     The Protocol In its final form established
 the four zones of occupation and the special joint occupation for the Berlin area, Para
 graph 5 of the Protocol provides:
 An Inter -Allied Governing authority (Komendatura) consisting
 of four Commandants, appointed by their respective Commanders-in-Chief,
 will be established to direct jointly the administration of the "Greater
 Berlin" Area.
 The Soviet Union was also signatory to the Agreement of May 1, 1945, which stated:
 Supreme authority in Germany will be exercised on instructions from
 their respective governments, by the Commanders-in-Chief of the armed
 forces of the United States of America, the United Kngdom and the Union
 of Soviet Socialist Republics, Lang/ the Provisional Government of the
 French Republic each in his own zone of occupation, and also jointly, In
 matters affecting Germany as a whole, in their capacity as members of
 the supreme organ of control constituted under the present Agreement.
 With regard to Berlin, the Agreement stated:

 four Commandants, one fromeach Power, appointed by their respective
 Commanders-in-Chief, will be established to direct jointly the adminis-

 serve in rotation, In the position of Chief Commandant, as head of the
 Inter-Allied Authority.
 Almost from the beginning the Soviet representatives on the Allied Control Council

 controls authorized by the Allied Komendatura. On March 20, 1948, the Soviet repre-
 sentatives walked out of the Allied Control Council and on April 1 imposed rail and
 road restrictions on Allied traffic to Berlin. On June 16, 1948, the Soviet represen-
 tatives left the Komendatura and 10 days later imposed a total blockade of Berlin. On
 July 1, 1948, the chief Soviet representative in the Komendatura announced that the
 four power administration of Berlin was terminated. On November 30, 1948, the
 German Communists set up their own city. government in the Soviet sector of Berlin,
 thus completing the division of Berlin into East and West zones.
 On May 4, 1949, after the Western powers had demonstrated their determination
 to retain their legal rights in Berlin by supplying the city by air, the Governments of
 the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France reached an agree-
 ment at New York, which was confirmed subsequently at the Council of Foreign Ministers
 at Paris. Among other provisions, the New York agreement stated:
 All the restrictions imposed since March 1, 1948, by the Govern-
 ment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on communications,
 transportation, and trade between Berlin and the Western zones of
 Germany and between the Eastern zone and the Western zones will be
 removed on May 12, 1949.
 In addition, the agreement reached at Paris specified:
 ... in order to improve and supplement this and other arrangements
 and agreements as regards the movement of persons and goods and
 communications between the Eastern zone and the Western zones and
 between the zones and Berlin and also in regard to transit, the
 occupation authorities, each in his own zone, will have an obligation
 to take the measures necessary to insure the normal functioning and
 utilization of rail, water, and road transport for such movement of
 persons and goods and such communications by post, telephone, and
 telegraph.
 On July 23, 1955, the heads of government of the United States, the USSR, France,
 and the United Kingdom issued the following statement at Geneva:
 The Heads of Government, recognizing their common responsi-
 bility for the settlement of the German question and the reunification
 of Germany, have agreed that the settlement of the German question
 and the reunification of Germany by free elections shall be carried
 out in conformity with the national interests of the German people
 and in the interests of European security.
 That the Soviet Union had no intention of carrying out this promise was made clear
 less than four months later at the meeting of Foreign Ministers in Geneva. On November
 8, 1955, Molotov stated:
 . such a mechanical merger of the two parts of Germany be means
 of so -called "free elections".. could lead to the violation of the vital
 interests of the working masses of the German Democratic Republic,
 to which one cannot agree.
 Since that time, the Soviet Union has consistently rejected all attempts to solve
 the German problem except on its own terms, and in recent months has sought to impose
 its "solution" on the Western powers, by unilateral action in total disregard of its treaty
 commitments. On November 27, 1958, the Soviet Government notified the Government
 of the United States that it regarded the agreements on Germany of September 12, 1944
 and May 1, 1945 as "null and void," and announced its intention of turning over. its
 functions within Berlin and in regard to access to the city to the so-called German
 Democratic Republic. The Western powers have refused to accept any such unilateral
 action on the part of the USSR.

 Agreements On Prisoners of War
 The terms for the surrender of Japan were defined in the Proclamation of July
 26, 1945, issued by the United States, Britain, and China. The Soviet Union, in declar-
 ing war upon Japan on August 8, 1945 announced that it had joined in the Allied
 Proclamation of July 28. Point 9 of the Proclamation stated
 The Japanese military forces, after being completely disarmed,
 shall be permitted to return to their homes with the opportunity to
 lead peaceful and productive lives.
 In May 1949, following a Japanese statement that $78,929 Japanese prisoners
 were still being hel, the official Soviet news agency admitted that 95,000 Japanese
 prisoners were still in the Soviet Union. In 1957 the Japanese stated that 8,069 Japanese
 citizens continued to be detained in the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia, 2,829 in North
 Korea, and 1, 392 in Sakhalin and the Kurile Islands.
 The release of German prisoners of war was discussed in 1947 at the Council
 of Foreign Ministers, which reached agreement that
 German prisoners of war located in the territory of the Allied
 Powers and in all other territories will be returned to Germany on
 December 31, 1948.
 The Soviet Union reaffirmed this obligation in submitting Its plan for repatriation
 on June 30, 1947.
 On January 3,1949, the United States protested to the Soviet Union for its failure
 to furnish information on its repatriation of war prisoners. The United States note stated:
 .on the basis of the Soviet Government's statement at the Council
 of Foreign Ministers in Moscow that 890, 532 war prisoners were still
 held by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics at that time, only some
 447,387 are officially known to have been repatriated to Germany.
 In its note of January 24, 1949 to the United States, the Soviet Government
 promised that "...repatriation of war prisoners will be completed during 1949."
 In 1957 the United Nations Ad Hoc Commission on Prisoners of War received a
 memorandum from the Federal Republic of Germany which stated:
 In the course of German-Soviet negotiations in Moscow in September
 1955, the Soviet Government declared itself willing to release 9, 826
 prisoners of war. However, the assurance was also given that any
 additional persons would be released who might be traced in the Soviet
 Union on the basis of relevant German lists, provided such persons
 had German nationality..
 According to the memorandum, only 1,772 prisoners had been returned since
 September 1958. The Soviet Government bad refused to repatirate more than 100,000
 German war and civilian prisoners who had been forced to settle in the USSR following
 the elimination of certain forced labor camps on the giounds that they had acquired
 Soviet nationality. The Soviet Union had supplied no Information on the whereabouts of
 87,353 prisoners of war and 16,480 German civilians known to have been in Soviet
 captivity at one time or another; 75 German scientists, whose work contracts had ex-
 pired long previously, were being detained at Sukhmi.
 The Ad Hoc Commission on repatriation of war prisoners reported in September
 1957 that the Soviet Government had not even replied to a request to discuss the matter
 at Geneva.

 The Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, concluded on August 14, 1945, between
 the Soviet Union and the Republic of China contained, among others, the following pro-
 visions.
 Article V.  The High Contracting Parties, having regard to the
 interests and security and economic development of each of them,
 agree to work together in close and friendly collaboration after
 the coming of peace and to act according to the principles of
 mutual respect for their sovereignty and territorial Integrity
 and of non-intervention in the internal affairs of the other Con-
 tracting Party.
 Article VI. The High Contracting Parties agree to afford one
 another all possible economic assistance in the postwar period
 in order to facilitate and expedite the rehabilitation of both
 countries and to make their contribution to the prosperity of the
 world.
 Article VIII. The Treaty... shall remain in force for a term of
 thirty years.
 In the exchange of notes accompanying the treaty, Foreign Minister Molotov stated:
 ....The Government of the USSR agrees to render to China moral
 support and aid in military supplies and other material resources,
 such support and aid to be entirely given to the National Govern-
 ment as the Central Government of China.
 The Soviet Union began to disregard these provisions almost immediately.
 (1) In its occupation of Manchuria, commencing in 1945, the Soviet. authorities
 removed from Manchuria assets valued at $858,000,000 in the form of mining equipment,
 rolling stock, steel mills, electric power generators, and other equipment.
 (2) The Soviet Government made available to the Chinese Communists extensive
 stocks of Japanese arms and other equipment to be employed against the National Government.
 The Unification of Korea
 At the Conference of Foreign Ministers in Moscow in December 1945, the Soviet
 Union, together with the United States and the United Kingdom, agreed to the establishment
 of a free and independent Korea. The Report of the Conference, dated December 27, 1945,
 stated that,  with a view to the re-establishment of Korea as an Independent state, " there
 should be established a "provisional democratic Korean government." Further:
 In order to assist the formation of a provisional government and
 with a view to the preliminary elaboration of the appropriate measures,
 there shall be established a Joint Commission consisting of represen-
 tatives of the United States command In southern Korea and the Soviet
 command in northern Korea. In preparing their proposals the
 Commission shall consult with the Korean democratic parties and
 social organization...
 It shall be the task of the Joint Commission, with the participation
 of the provisional Korean democratic government and of the Korean
 democratic organization, to work out measures also for helping and
 assisting (trusteeship) the political, economic and social progress of
 the Korean people, the development of democratic self-government
 and the establishment of the national Independence of Korea.

 The Soviet Union from the start thwarted the implementation of this agreement.
 Its representative on the Joint Commission refused to recognize as "democratic" any
 parties and organizations not under Soviet control. R prevented UN-sponsored elections
 in northern Korea, and established there Its own regime, the so-called Democratic
 People's Republic of Korea which-claimed jurisdiction over the entire country. On June
 25, 1950, this regime, armed and encouraged by the Soviet Union, attacked the Republic
 of Korea.
 Soviet Pledges In Hunaarv
 On October 30  1958t~th~~e~~ 'Government of the USSR made a public declaration,
 printed the following lay In YI~yyY4, which stated:
 Having in mind that the further presence of Soviet ?mlitary units in
 Hungary could serve as an excuse for further aggravation of the situation,
 the Soviet Government has given its military command instructions to
 withdraw the Soviet military units from the city of Budapest as soon as
 this is considered necessary by the Hungarian Government.
 At the same time the Soviet Government is prepared to enter into
 the appropriate negotiations with the Government of the Hungarian
 People's Republic and other members of the Warsaw Treaty on the
 question of the presence of Soviet troops on the territory of Hungary.
 The Soviet Union not only broke the pledge, but deliberately used It as a cover In
 order to crush the revolt in Hungary.
 (1) On October 31, 1956, the Soviet Army began strengthening its forces in
 Hungary.
 (2) On November 3, 1956, under pretext of negotiating the withdrawal of Soviet
 troops, Soviet authorities arrested the Hungarian representatives, led by Colonel Pal
 Maleter, who had been sent to carry on the negotiations.
 (3) On November 4, 1956, Hungarian Premier Imre Nagy broadcast the following
 statement:
 In the early hours of this morning the Soviet troops launched an
 attack against our capital city with the obvious Intention of aerthrow-
 ing the lawful, democratic, Hungarian Government. Our troops are
 fighting. The government is in its place. I inform the people of the
 country and world opinion of this.
 (4) On June 16, 1958, the Hungarian Communist regime of Janos Kadar, who had
 personally pledged the safety of Imre Nagy after the suppression of the revolt, announced
 the execution of Nagy and of his associates, Pal Maleter, Jozsef Sztlagyl, and Miklos Gimes.
 Credit Agreement with Yugoslavia
 On January 12, 1958, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia concluded an agreement under
 which Yugoslavia was to receive Soviet credits for economic construction and expansion.
 By the agreement of August 3 1958, Yugoslavia recieved a tether credit of $175 million,
 to be provided jointly by the USSR and Its East German satellite, for construction of an
 aluminum combine.
 In the spring of 1958 the Soviet Union, which had become Increasingly disgruntled
 with Yugoslavia's ideological Independence, endeavored to employ Its credit agreement
 as a political weapon.  Pravda on May 9, 1958, noting that  ideological differences" lead
 to differences on political sues " threatened in a thinly veiled fashion that economic assis-
 tance might be terminated if the 1lugoslav ideological line were not changed. On May 27,
 1958, Foreign Minister Gromyko handed to the Yugoslav Ambassador a note announcing the
 unilateral suspension for "five years" of Soviet and East German deliveries under the 1958
 credit agreements.

 SOVIET MANPOWER'
 1960 - 70
 This report shows the changes in the population and labor force of
 the USSR that are expected to take place between 1960 and 1970.  For
 purposes of comparison, data also are presented for earlier years.
 The USSR has already taken steps to cope with the two most impor-
 tant manpower problems that will be encountered during the 1960's --
 the small increments to the population of working age during 1960-65 and
 the effective use of the huge labor force living on farms.  By reducing
 the armed forces and by controlling the rate of school enrollment among
 youths during 1956-60, the USSR has succeeded in providing enough ad-
 ditional labor to overfulfill its manpower and production plans in spite
 of a continuous decline in the increments to the population of working
 age resulting from the low birth rates of World War II.  The number of
 persons on farms is expected to be almost as large in 1970 as in 1960.
 By promoting industrial and construction activities in rural areas, the
 USSR has attempted to employ surplus agricultural workers on the farms,
 thus keeping rural-to-urban migration at a minimum and avoiding the
 necessity for providing more housing and public utilities in the already
 overcrowded cities.
 The estimates for the 1950's are based on statistics that have ap-
 peared in official Soviet publications. The outlook for the 1960's is based
 on the following assumptions:
 1.    That birthrates (by age of mother)will remain
 at present levels but that death rates will de-
 cline slowly,
 2.    That the goals announced for the Seven Year
 Plan (1959-65) relating to manpower and ed-
 ucation will be achieved and that the trends
 established in the first half of the decade will
 continue until 1970,
 3.    That the planned reduction in the armed forces
 by 1. 2 million during 1960-61 will take place,
 4.    That no major war or other cataclysmic event
 will occur.

 In addition to the enormous military and civilian losses attributable

 Soviet leaders as the groups reached elementary school, high school,
 and working age. These small groups will be marrying and having chil-
 dren during the 1960's. As they replace the larger, prewar groups, the
 rate of growth of the population will temporarily decline.
 For the decade of the 1960's as a whole, the population will increase
 atanaverage annual rate of 1. 5 percent -- a little more slowly than dur-
 ing the 1950's.
 THE CIVILIAN LABOR FORCE WILL GROW BY ABOUT
 17 MILLION, OR 16 PERCENT, DURING THE 1960's
 The civilian labor force of the USSR will increase by about 17 mil-
 lion during the 1960's, only 1 million more than the increase during the
 1950's.  Growth will be slower in the first half of the decade than in the
 second because the age groups starting to work during 1960-65 will be
 the unusually small groups born during the war and the early postwar
 period.  The increase will be enough, however, to permit the achieve-
 ment of the manpower goals set by the Seven Year Plan (1959-65).

 The total number of persons reaching the normal working age of 15
 inthe USSR will more thandouble betwcenl960and 1970 -- from 2. 3 mil-
 lion to 4. 7 million.  This increase follows a rapid decline during the
 1950's, particularly in the latter half of the decade.  These fluctuations
 result from the sharp decline in the birth rate during 1940-45 and its
 subsequent rise.
 The decline in the number of 15-year-olds would have resulted in a
 much slower growth in the labor force than actually occurred if the USSR
 had not taken steps to increase the labor supply.  By controlling school
 enrollment and by reducing the armed forces, however, the USSR has
 been able to keep its civilian labor force growing at a fairly even pace.

 The decrease in day school enrollment resulted both from a decline
 in the number of persons of high school age and from a decline in the
 proportion enrolled. More young people thus became available for work.
 This downward trend in school enrollment is expected to be reversed in
 the early 1960's, when the number of 15-year-olds begins to rise and
 when the current reorganization of education is completed.
 Between 1955 and 1960 the armed forces decreased by more than
 2 million persons, and the Soviet government has announced plans to cut
 the armed forces by an additional 1. 2 million during 1960-61 -- years
 when the additions to the population of working age will be the lowest
 (fewer than 1 million each year).

 WOMEN FAR OUTNUMBER MEN IN THE POPULATION

 one of the highest percentages in the world.                                       In the age group 25 to 59,
 there are 139 women for each 100 men. The heavy preponderance of
 women in these ages is a consequence of the disproportionate losses of
 men during World War II andalso during the collectivization drive of the
 1930's. By 1970, women will constitute 53 percent of the population.
 The age structure of the population will not change greatly during
 the 1960's. About the same proportion will be in the working ages 15 to
 69 in 1970 as now, but women will be a smaller part of the total.

 Women now makeup more than half of the civilian labor force of the
 USSR, but their predominance is gradually diminishing.  By 1970 the
 labor force will be about equally divided between men and women.
 Nearly two-thirds of the number of Soviet women 14 years of age
 and over currently participate in the labor force.  Women probably will
 continue ?toparticipate at this high rate during the 1960's. The percent-
 age could rise even higher, for Soviet leaders have established as an ul-
 timate goal the almost universal participation of women in employment
 outside the home. Soviet plans call for more kindergartens, nurseries,
 boarding schools,  and public dining facilities to make it possible for
 more women to work.

 NEARLY HALF OF THE CIVILIAN LABOR FORCE IS
 EMPLOYED IN AGRICULTURE
 More than 50 million people in the USSR -- nearly half of the total
 labor force -- are engaged in agriculture.  This figure represents the
 numtberof persons 14 years old andoverwho live on collective and state
 farms and who participate in normal farm activities at some time dur-
 ing the year.  It also includes unpaid family workers who live on those
 farms and who work exclusively on private plots -- still an important
 source of agricultural production in the USSR.
 A little more than one-fourth of the labor force is employed in in-
 dustry and construction, and somewhat less than one-fourth is employed
 in the service sector. Slightly more than half of all workers in the ser-
 vices are employed in education, health, and trade, and about one-fourth
 are employed in transportation and communications.
 Agricultural employment is expected to resume its historic downward
 trend during the 1960's after a temporary interruption during the mid-
 1950's, when Khrushchev's "new lands" program added several million

 people to Soviet farms.  In 1970, agricultural employment will still be
 high, constituting 40 percent of the civilian labor force.
 Employment in the services, which increased by 32 percent in the
 1950's, will increase by 40 percent during the 1960's. By 1970, 28 per-
 cent of the labor force will be working in service activities compared
 with 21 percent in 1950.  Nevertheless, more people will still be em-
 ployed in the nonagricultural productive industries (manufacturing, min-
 ing, and construction) than in the services.

 THE RURAL POPULATION WILL CONTINUE TO
 DECLINE AS A PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL
 The rural population of the USSR is expected to drop from 51 per-
 cent of the total in 1960 to 43 percent in 1970.  Early in the decade the
 urban population for the first time will exceed the rural population.
 Post-Stalin agricultural policies reduced the rate of rural-to-urban
 migration, resulting in the same rural population in 1950 and 1960. The
 'rural population is expected to drop slowly to about 105 million by 1970.
 Although Soviet agriculture probably will achieve sizable gains in
 productivity during the 1960's, the integration of surplus unskilled farm
 labor into the urban labor force will present difficult problems.  Khru-
 shchev has talked about urbanizing the countryside by developing "farm-
 cities" at existing farm sites, thus avoiding the necessity for providing
 additional housing and public utilities in already crowded urban areas.
 These farm-cities would provide training for jobs in industry and ser-
 vices for farm workers who become surplus through mechanization..
 Some such scheme maybe necessary to cope with the anomaly of a huge
 farm labor force and a huge rural population in a country undergoing
 rapid industrialization.

 Some idea of the educational level of the Soviet labor force may be
 obtained from the data on educational attainment of the entire adult pop-
 ulation given in the 1959 census.                                                                        In 1959, only 2. 6 percent -of the pop-
 ulation 15 years old and over had graduated from college, and 60.5 per-
 cent had not even completed elementary school (7 years). Considerable
 educational progress was achievedby the USSR during the decade of the
 1950's, after the 7-year elementary school was made compulsory in
 1949.  Even greater progress probably will be made during the 1960's,.
 when an 8-year elementary education is scheduled to become compul-
 sory.

 THE PACE OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS WILL BE
 STEPPED UP SHARPLY DURING THE 1960's-EVENING
 SCHOOL ATTENDANCE IN HIGH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES
 WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE
 High school and college enrollment in the USSR will rise rapidly
 during the 1960's.  The USSR is currently reorganizing its school Sys-
 tem to place more emphasis on vocational education in high schools and
 on evening enrollment in both high schools and colleges.  The 7-year
 elementary schools are to become 8-year schools, and attendance will
 be compulsory.  The projected rise in day school enrollment during the
 early 1960's will resultfrom the increased attendance in theeighth grade
 of the reorganized elementary schools as well as from the larger pro-
 portion of persons of high school age in the population. During the 1960's,
 3. 5 million to 4 million persons will be graduating from college com-
 pared with Z. 5 million during the 1950's.
 High school education is to be made "universally available" but not
 compulsory.  The USSR also is tightening the controls over school en-
 rollment to provide a more effective means of manipulating school en-
 rollment in accordance with the need for labor.  State authorities will
 decide whether graduates from the eighth grade are to go to work, to
 high school, or to a trade school. Those who go directly to work will be

 GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT AND PRODUCTIVITY
 WILL CONTINUE TO RISE RAPIDLY
 The continued rise in the level of education and skill of the Soviet
 labor force, along with progress in technology, should permit produc-
 tivity to rise rapidly.  Gross national product (GNP) is expected to in-
 crease about 6 percent annually during the 1960's, a little more slowly
 than during the 1950's. GNP per capita and GNP per worker (which is
 a rough measure of productivity) will each increase about 4. 5 percent
 annually.
 The high rate of increase in GNP should permit consumption per
 capita to increase substantially.  By 1970 the standard of living of the
 average Soviet worker probably will be about 40 percent higher than the
 present level.

 FRANCIS GARY POWERS
 U.S. SENATE,
 COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES,
 Washington, D.C.
 The committee met, pursuant to call, at 2 p.m., in room 318, Old
 Senate Office Building.
 Present: Senators Russell (chairman), presiding; Byrd of Virginia,
 Stennis, Symington, Jackson, Ervin, Thurmond, Byrd of West Vir-
 ginia, Saltonstall, Smith of Maine, Case of South. Dakota, Bush, Beall,
 and Goldwater.
 Also present: William H. Darden, T. Edward Braswell, Jr., Gordon
 A. Nease, professional staff; Harry L. Wingate, Jr., chief clerk; and
 Herbert S. Atkinson, assistant chief clerk.
 Chairman RUSSELL. I have been requested by Senator Cannon, a
 member of this committee, who is always most diligent in attending
 the sessions, to announce that, due to his attendance at the War
 College at Maxwell Field on national security matters, he will be
 unable to be here this afternoon.
 That will be all for these cameras.
 I will ask the officers to see that that rule is enforced and that no
 further pictures are taken.
 If you need any additional policemen for that purpose, we will
 summon them.
 The Armed Services Committee, through the Central Intelligence
 Agency, has extended to Mr.-Francis Gary Powers an invitation to
 appear here in open session this afternoon.
 Before we hear from Mr. Powers, the Chair would like to make a
 very short statement concerning the circumstances of this hearing.
 The Chair believes it can be fairly stated that this committee and
 its subcommittees have attempted to deal with subjects involving the
 Central Intelligence Agency and, indeed, all matters affecting the
 national security, in an unspectacular manner.
 Accordingly, to some, it may appear that this hearing in the caucus
 room, under these circumstances, is somewhat uncharacteristic of the
 proceedings of this committee.
 In this instance, however, the correction of some erroneous im-
 pressions and an opportunity for Mr. Powers to reveal as much of his
 experience as is consistent with security requirements make it appar-
 ent that a hearing of this type at this time is not only in the national
 interest, but is in the interest of fair play for Mr. Powers.
 And if this committee needs any defense, the Chair will state that
 in scheduling this hearing, this committee has not been motivated
 by any spirit of self-aggrandizement.

 Mr. Powers, after having been subjected to a public trial in Moscow,
 you should feel no trepidation whatever in appearing before a group
 of your fellow citizens and elected representatives.
 I hope that you feel just as much at case as you possibly can.
 I understand from Senator Byrd that you are a Virginia boy.
 What part of Virginia are you from?
 STATEMENT OF FRANCIS GARY POWERS, ACCOMPANIED BY
 LAWRENCE HOUSTON, GENERAL COUNSEL, CENTRAL INTELLI-
 GENCE AGENCY
 Mr. POWERS. I spent most of my life in the southwest part of
 Virginia, around Pound and Grundy, Vu.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Were you educated in Vir iota.?
 Mr. POWERS. Through grammar school and high school in Virginia
 and college in Tennessee.
 Chairman RUSSELL.  What did you do after you left college?
 Mr. PowERS. I worked for one summer as a lifeguard at the
 swimming pool near my home in Virginia, joined the Air Force in
 October of that year,
 Chairman RUSSELL, When were you first employed by the CIA?
 Mr. PowEns. In May of 1956.
 Chairman RUSSELL.  You were an experienced pilot at the time you
 were employed by the CIA; were you not?
 Mr. POWERS.   'es, sir.  I don't remember the exact number of
 hours, but. I have had well over a thousand hours of flying time.
 Chairman RUSSELL. How much experience did you have with the
 U-2?
 Mr. POWERS. A little better than 500 hours flyin time.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Now, Mr. Powers, we would like to have you
 go ahead and tell us in your own words of your mission on the 1st of
 May 1960.
 It you could pull up the microphone a little closer I think some of
 the members of the committee perhaps will hear you a little better.
 Mr. PowERS. I was awakened on te morning of May 1, sometime
 between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning.  I knew before that I might
 have to fly the next day but I wasn't certain at the time.
 I had breakfast.  The doctor looked me over.  I was feeling fine.
 The navigator gave me a briefing either before or during the time that
 I was  rebreat.hing for this flight.  Ile showed me the maps, the
 route that I would take, the turning points, the different headings,
 and where the equipment was to be turned off and on.  Later I
 talked to the weather forecaster who gave me the probable weather
 conditions along the route, the weather at destination, how high to
 expect condensation trails.
 Then, after that, I talked to the detachment commander who told
 me what I was to do in case of an emergency, in case of engine trouble,
 or a forced landing over enemy territory.  This was both before I put
 on my pressure suit and while I was prebreathing the o_x gen.
 Somewhere, I suppose about 5:30 in the morning, I finished dressing
 and was taken to the aircraft.  I climbed into the aircraft and waited-
 I had to wait for signal before starting the engine and before taking
 off.  The signal came a little late.  I don't remember exactly how
 late, but it was later than scheduled.

 I took off, climbed on course.  I remember that the condensation
 trails were a little higher than I had been told they would be, but not
 much.  I climbed above this layer and reached my altitude and con-
 tinued on course.  The weather was cloudy underneath.  I couldn't
 see the ground for over an hour, and I drifted right off course. There
 course                                               I got over the
 was    but never did get exactly back o ecour eobefored
 clouds again.
 It was in this area that I saw two condensation
 to be paralleling my
 aircraft, so I knew at this time-they appeared
 course.  The first one headed in exactly the opposite direction as
 myself, and a few minutes later, I assume it was the same aircraft
 passed me going on the same heading that I was going on.  He made
 no maneuvers that I could tell and I never did see the aircraft itself,
 just the condensation trail.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Did you estimate his altitude?at the time.
 Mr. POWERS. He was well below me.  I felt fairly good I was well above the condensation trail layer and I don't think he
 ever saw me if he was looking forme.  I got back over the clouds there,
 made a correction for the wind, but I still drifted to the right of course.
 I would say approximately 200 miles south of Sverdlovsk the clouds
 ended, and I corrected back to course and was on course the rest of
 the :flight.  Just about the time that the clouds ended, I began having
 a little autopilot trouble.  It wasn't very bad at the time so I just
 disengaged the autopilot, a few minutes later reengaged it and it
 worked for about 10 minutes and I had the same trouble again.
 I went through this procedure two or three times and finally de-
 cided not to use it any more, and I'd say the last 15, 20, or 30 minutes
 was flown by hand without the autopilot.
 Weather in this area was perfectly clear, visability was excellent.
 I saw no other condensation trails from other aircraft.      30 on
 very close to course all the way.  I got to, I would say,
 40 miles of Sverdlovsk probably as well as I can remember southeast
 of the city, made a turn to the left of approximately 00", rolled out
 on course, lined up on my next flight line.  I was to go over the
 southern edge of the city-the southwestern edge of the city.
 I can remember seeing an airfield there that was not on my map.
 After making this turn, I had to record the time that I reached this
 particular point, the engine instrument readings, the exhaust gas
 temperature, the altitude, several things, I don't remember exactly
 what they all were, and I was doing this at the time that I heard and
 felt this explosion.
 It was approximately a minute after I had rolled out of this turn.
 I can't be sure of the times there.  It is hard to recall just exactly
 what sensation I had at this time.   I can remember feeling, hearing,
 and just sensing an explosion, but there was no-just a slight accelera-
 tion            was all that I felt in the aircraft        immedi-
 ately looked up from the instruments and everywherelI looked was
 orange.
 I don't know whether the whole sky was orange, or just the reflection
 of an orange light in the canopy, but I had never seen anything like
 this before, and I am sure there was an explosion.  I feel that the
 explodion was external to the aircraft and behind me, but I really
 don't know.  I have never been in an aircraft in which the engine

 exploded or which has had an explosion on board, so I don't know
 exactly what that would feel like, but I am sure You could feel that
 through the controls or through the seat       way, and so I ant
 almost positive it ~t- :ts external to         some way
 the aircraft.
 For a short Lillie there--I don't know
 how long-th11C had no mean-
 111g at this particular time -I thought evervtbing was all right.  The
 right wing started to drop, whirls is normal in an aircraft, it wanders
 around it little, and I turned the wheel, brought the right wing back to
 level position, and either after it reached the level position or just
 before it reached that, the nose started dropping
 I could probably demonstrate this better with the model here. It
 was going along like this. The right wing dropped slightly, not very
 much.  I used the controls.  The wing carne back upp level and just,
 before or after it got level, the nose started going do-tin, and very
 slowly. So I applied back pressure to the control column and felt no
 resistance to the movement of the control column. and this kept going
 faster and faster.  So I immediately assumed at the time that the
 tail section of fit(, aircraft lied come off, because it-it very violent
 maneuver happened in here.  I think I reached a position about like
 this and I feel sure flint. bout wings came ofl'.
 This was where the very violent maneuver took place.
 Chairman RussFLI.. You were not where you could see the wings
 to determine whether? they had eerie off.
 Mr. Pownns. I didn't have much tinic to look, and I was being
 thrown around in the cockpit very much at this time.  It had come
 down in this position.  I had pulled the control column all the way
 back into my lap, and it did no good.  As it, came down, it kept going
 faster and it. got like this and I feel that the wings came off (lien, but
 I really don't know.  And a very violent maneuver during this time,
 and it ended up in n- spin about- this position.  I know the nose was
 high, and I know it was turning very fast around, it seemed like
 around something heavy like in the fuselage.  I don't knocc hots much
 of tire. aircraft was left- at the time.  But all I could see by looking
 out of the cockpit wits sky.  The g. forces were very strong'  I have
 no way of estimating hots" much.
 I know that. when I tried to get in the ejection position, it took
 both hands on my legs to pull nty- feet back into the stirrups of the
 ejection seat.
 It was spinning very violently.  I was thrown forward and up,
 and I was hanging onto the seat belt, not sitting in the seat.
 My first reaction was to reach for the destruct switches, and I
 reached up.  I don't know whether I touched them or not, but I
 thought that I had bet ter see if I can get out of here before using this.
 I knew that there was a 70-second time delay between the time of
 the actuation of the switches and the time that the explosion would
 occur.
 So, after deciding fliint-I had better check and see if I could get
 out before actuating the switches, I tried to get- into position in the
 ejection seat- so that I could use it.  In this particular aircraft there
 isn't much clearance between the pilot's knees and the top of the
 windshield, the rail, steel rail across the top of Elie windshield, and I
 was being thrown forward, and if I had used the ejection seat at that
 time, I would have probably lost both legs just above Lite knees.

 I don't know how long I tried getting back in position, but at the
 time I could think of no other way to get out, just the ejection seat.
 My mind was fixed on that one idea.
 I kept glancing at the altimeter as the aircraft was falling and it
 was going around very fast.  I remembered somewhere during this
 time above the altitude of 34,000 feet that a friend of mine who had
 had an accident in an aircraft was having trouble getting out of the
 aircraft, and I remembered him. telling me of his experience.
 He said that he told himself that he just had to stop and think, and
 this entered my mind at the time, so I just stopped struggling and tried
 to think, and this was the first time that I realized that maybe I
 could just open the canopy, loosen the seat belt, and climb out.
 And, along in here, I saw 34,000 feet on the altimeter, and it was
 still moving very fast.
 I immediately reached up, opened the canopy.  One side came loose
 first-I think it was the right side.  The other handle loosened the
 left side and it floated off-I believe it was to the left.  I really don't
 know, but it just disappeared.
 I had pulled my emergency belt out, however-I think that was one
 of the first things I did after this real violent maneuver-so that when
 I separated from the aircraft, I would have an oxygen supply while
 descending, but I had forgotten to unfasten my oxygen hoses--the
 can on my left.
 I opened the seat belt, and I was immediately thrown forward and
 halfway out of the aircraft.
 I can probably demonstrate this better than I can tell.  The top of
 the canopy was, say, the top of this table, and I was hanging out over
 the front of the aircraft about like this [indicating], and I think the
 only thing that was keeping me in the aircraft was the oxygen hose.
 If that had not have been fastened, I would probably have gone out
 right away, I don't know.
 Well, then, I tried to got back into the aircraft so that I could
 actuate these destructor switches.  I couldn't-the g. forces were too
 great and I could not pull myself back over the top of the windshield.
 I tried to reach around underneath the windshield.  I knew where
 the switches were.  And I couldn't get my hand back underneath.
 Also, somewhere about this time my faceplate of my flying suit
 frosted up completely.  That is when it got into the cold air, and all I
 could see was just the eyes on the faceplate about an inch or so in
 front of my face.  I knew that I was well below 34,000 feet.
 I had no idea of what my altitude was.  I couldn't get back in the
 airplane.  I didn't know whether I could get those oxygen. hoses
 loose or not.  I couldn't actuate the destruct switches.
 So then I decided just to try to get out. I gave several lunges and
 something snapped and I was floating free.  It was almost immediately
 that the parachute opened, and this surprised me because I hadn't
 pulled the ripcord.
 The parachute was equipped with an automatic opening device,
 but it has to be actuated by pulling another cord, and apparently that
 cord got hung on something in the airplane and pulled, because it was
 well less than a minute, I am sure, after leaving the aircraft that the
 chute opened.
 A short while after that-I don't remember how long-I got to
 thinking that this chute was set to open at 15,000 feet or lower; that
 Approved For Release 2005/08/22 : CIA-RDP66B00403R000500120001-1
 App( ved For Release 2       2AlgAp-  E  B00403R000500120001-1
 the maxinium altitude it, would open would be 15,000 feet; so I knew
 that I could take my faceplate off, and not be in danger from the thin
 air.
 So I removed the faceplate, just left it hanging on the hoses that
 were connected to the suit, and started looking around, and I was still
 very Icigh----I estimate above 10,000 feet, but I have no idea of the
 exact altitude.
 There were a lot, of thoughts running through my mind at this time.
 It is impossible to recall them all, but I remembered I had a map in
 my pocket.  I took this reap out, looked at it, tore it into small pieces,
 and scattered it in the air.
 I also thought of the coin with the poison pin in it.  This had been
 given to me just prior to the flight, and it was my option whether to
 take this or not, and I chose to take it.  I got to thinking that when I
 got on the ground if I were captured they would surely find this coin
 but maybe with just the pin Iving loose in the pocket it would be
 overlooked, so I opened up the coin, got the pin out, and just dropped
 it in my= pocket.
 I had several other things in my pockets, but they were more or less
 necessary to survival if I could evade capture, so I decided not to get
 rid of those things.  I don't remember exactly what they were.  It
 was ust. some of the. things that I couldn't get into my survival pack
 itself .  I couldn't. tell where I was going to land.  There were a lot of
 wooded areas there, and there was one fairly large one that I would
 drift toward and then drift back away front.  1 was trying to guide
 the parachute over to this wooded area, but 1 had no success in that.
 The winds were variable as I was coming down in the parachute.
 and first I would go toward the Woods, later away from therm.
 When I got down fairly close to the ground, there was a car I could
 see on a dirt road.  I didn't know what he was doing, but lie wasn't
 going too fast and he seemed to be just kee. Wing up with me, and the
 closer I got the closer lie would get to me.  11e came to a little village
 there, turned left out to the outskirts, of the village and stopped, and
 I guess I was maybe 200 feet in the air at this time, and I think it
 was two men got out of the car.
 I was descending what. appeared to be very rapidly at the time, and
 I landed in an open field about 25 feet from a tractor with one driver
 on the tractor and one man standing beside the tractor.
 When I hit the ground I fell down.  When I looked up, one of the
 risen, I don't know which it was, was out grabbing a-hold of the para-
 chute to Ley to collapse it.  I remember releasing a strap on one side
 so that the' air would spill out of the chute.  A couple of these men
 helped me to my feet.  I don't remember whether they tried to say
 anything to me at the time or not.  I think they did, and I just shook
 my- head.  They helped me remove my parachute harness and the
 helmet of the flying suit. They took away the pistol and a knife
 that I had on nmy parachute..   After I got my helmet off and could
 look around, there was a large crowd of people there, a lot of children,
 so apparently there was a school in this area.  I don't know how many
 grownups but 1 would say there were at least 50 people.  This is
 just a guess.
 These men tried to talk to me and I would just shake my head and
 indicate that I couldn't understand theta.       One of them pointed at
 me and held up two fingers, and I got the impression that he was

 Approved For Release :ROAW9N2&ft-PL    p i6B00403R0005001Z0001-1
 asking if there were two of us, and I told him "No,  just shook my
 head "No," and pointed to myself and held up one finger telling him
 that I was alone.  And then he pointed up in the air and I looked up
 and saw what I think was a parachute, but I knew that I had no
 other parachute on board the aircraft.
 I knew that it was no one that I knew, so I wasn't very interested
 at the time.  They didn't pay too much attention to this.  They just.
 talked among themselves, one on each side of me caught my arm and
 led me to this car that f had seen earlier.  They put me in the car
 in the front seat next to the driver and with a man on my right and
 there were three, I believe, in the back seat.  They had loaded up
 the parachute, and I think my survival pack, in the trunk of the car.
 They started driving through the village and -I indicated to them
 that I would like to have something to drink, so he stopped in front
 of a house there in this small village.  One of the men went inside,
 brought out a glass of water which I drank and they gave the glass
 to some of the people standing around and we left this village.  It
 was on a very bad dirt road, a lot of ruts, a very rough ride.  The
 car was small, and T estimate that it took about 30 minutes to got
 to this next village which was a larger place.
 There was a paved street running through this second village.
 They stopped on the side of the street that we approached the
 village from, got me out of the car, and there was what I took to be
 a policeman there.
 They talked to him and he went through my pockets, not very
 thoroughly, led me across the street into some sort of an office, and
 I estimate that I stayed there about 2 hours. There were both civilian
 and military there.  I don't know whether the military was there
 when I arrived or not but I know they were there during the time and
 before I left. One of the military men tried to speak to me in German,
 and I told him I didn't understand him.  There was no one there
 that could speak English, so they didn't ask mne any questions at the
 time.
 People kept bringing in small pieces of wreckage from the aircraft.
 I saw several pieces of metal, some with English written on it, there
 was a small roll of film.  They had my parachute there, the survival
 pack. Oh, they searched me here at this building also. They stripped
 me down to my underwear, went through my pockets, felt along the
 seams, but they didn't find. the needle at this time.
 They called in a doctor.  She was a young woman, I would say
 about 30 years old.  I had some scratches on my right leg which she
 painted and bandaged.  They tried to talk to me several times, but
 I couldn't understand them and they couldn't understand me, and
 I estimate it was around 2 hours, maybe a little more, but I have no
 way of knowing how long I was there.  They loaded inc up.in a mili-
 tary vehicle, a, little larger than our jeep.  There was an officer on my
 left, myself in the middle, and an enlisted man on my right in the
 back seat.  The enlisted man had a carbine of some, kind.
 In the front seat there was a military driver and a civilian.  They
 took inc into a fairly large city which I assumed.was Sverdlovsk.
 It was in the downtown area, into a fairly large office building, I
 would say about three stories high, and they took me to the. second
 floor:

 this place.  I tried to invent. a story there that I didn't know where

 in my survival pack or on my person with maps of the Soviet Union,
 Russian rubles, and several other items that indicated the nature of
 the mission.  It was then that I decided to follow the instructions
 that I had received earlier and tell them that 1 was a member of the
 CIA and the nature of the mission.
 It was quite obvious that they knew it anyway.  I think I stayed
 there approximately 30 minutes.  They made a lot of telephone calls.
 There was a man there who spoke English also and asked me several
 questions, and that is how I found out lay story wouldn't hold up.
 They seemed to be in a. hurry.   They made several telephone calls,
 talked a lot among themselves, and they gave me back my underwear
 and the outer flying suit but kept the pressure suit.  They also gave
 me something similar to our poncho with two slits on each side made
 out of canvas.  The slits were for the anus to go through.  They
 put this on me.
 One man got out a pair of handcuffs.  They talked among them-
 selves and he put them bark in his pocket and they never did put
 them on me.  We went back outside.
 They loaded me in a fairly large car, limousine type, drove to an
 airfield, and when we got there, we stopped at. the gate on one side of
 the terminal building, I suppose it was, and we waited there maybe 5
 nmintltes, and there was a jet passenger aircraft in front of this build-
 in .  Someone opened the gate.  11 c drove to the front entrance of
 this aircraft.  They made me run up the steps and led me into the
 front compartment. which contained 10 seats,  There were four men
 with nie.  I remember at least one was in uniform and one was a
 civilian, but I don't remember what the other two were wearing.
 They asked inc no questions on this flight.
 I am getting ahead of myself.  It seemed to me that the aircraft
 was waiting there for us because as soon as we got in they moved the
 loading ramp away and started up initnediately, and through the
 curtains to the back, when the stewardess walked through, I could
 see that there were other passengers in the back, so I suppose it was a
 regular   the flight. they asked no questions,  Some of the--a
 couple of the men played chess.  They ate, offered me food but I
 couldn't cat, and it was during this time that 1 made up my mind
 exactly what course I would follow during the forthcoming weeks.
 I knew that if these people released the news that I was there ---1
 didn't know that they would at the time, but I knew that if they did -
 that there would be~a lot of stuff in the papers in the States, and I
 also knew that they probably subscribed to every paper we have, and
 I wanted to make my story as close to what I thought would be re-
 leased in the papers as possible,
 I think the flight. took about 3 hours.
 We arrived at the airport in Moscow.  They had me. sit there for
 about 5 minutes, brought me out, ran me down the steps to a waiting
 car, and we immediately left.  The car had curtains inside that they
 kept pulled.
 You could see outside through the curtains, but I don't suppose
 anyone could see inside.

 They took me downtown to the building that I stayed in until
 September 9.
 There was another search performed immediately upon my arrival
 at this building.  They took all my clothing and gave me other cloth-
 ing there.  There was an interrogation, I would say, within 30 min-
 utes after my arrival there, and there were quite a few high-ranking
 people, many of them in uniforms, many of them in civilian clothes.
 I don't remember exactly the questions they asked during this
 time, but I think it was mostly concerned with establishing that I was
 a member of the CIA, or worked for the CIA, and the purpose of the
 flight.
 I don't know how long this lasted.  I do know that Rudenko, who
 was the prosecutor during the trial, was more or less in charge of this
 interrogation session.
 He offered me it Chesterfield cigarette.  They asked me, I think
 at this time, what I knew about Moscow; what I knew about Russia;
 and I told them I knew very little about it.
 They asked me if I would like to see Moscow, and I said :"Yes."
 And they said, "Well, that might be arranged."  Then I don't know
 whether I said anything or not, but, after this session was over, they
 took me to the prison section of this building. There I received a
 physical examination, not a very thorough one.
 There was a lot of time spent just locked up in a room with nothing
 but a bench built against the wall and just waiting. The doctor came
 into this room and examined me there.  I waited again..
 They took me to it doctor's office, and it was either a different
 doctor or it nurse, I don't know which, gave me a shot.  This was
 after dark; I don't know. what time it was.
 They immediately took me to a cell and put me in it, brought in
 some food which I couldn't eat, and I lay down and tried to sleep.
 The next morning there was an interrogation, and, for some reason
 or the other, this was left out of the books that they had compiled of
 the investigation.
 I don't know why this one was left out, but it was.
 Chairman RUSSELL. How do you know it was left out?
 Mr. PowERS. They told me that according to the Russian law, I
 could review the evidence in the case before the trial.
 Going through this. evidence a. week or so prior to the trial, I saw
 that one was missing, and I told this to my Soviet-appointed defense
 counsel, and he just shrugged his shoulders.  That morning they
 said that in the afternoon we would take a tour of Moscow, and I
 was all for this because I know as long as I was riding around in a
 car they would not be asking questions, and I would have been
 willing to take a trip every day.
 The real. interrogation started on the morning of the 3d, and it
 varied, the sessions varied in length, but there were times as much
 as 10 to 12 hours in a single day, several times at,night, but, as the
 time went on, they got shorter and a longer period between the
 interrogations.
 It was somewhere in the latter part of May that I had a very bad
 cold, could hardly talk, that they gave me the first day off that I
 did not have an interrogation. .
 I don't remember the exact date, but it was after the 20th of May.
 Through June the sessions became shorter and sometimes they
 would skip the whole weekend, Saturday and Sunday.

 I suppose you probably have a lot of questions on this that I have
 gone over.  Any time You want.
 Chairman RUSSELL. I do have a number.
 I was interested that you said a number of times that you had no
 way of knowing the time.     I think the first time you said your
 parachute was coming down.  Did you not have a' timepiece of
 some kind with you?
 Mr. POWErts. No.
 I had the clocks in the airplane itself.  I had no wristwatch.  I
 think there was one in my pocket, but 1 had forgotten about it, and
 it probably was not wound, anyway.
 From that, time I do not remember seeing a clock or anything that
 I could tell the tune by.
 Chairman RUSSELL. It is rather unusual for any American not to
 have a wristwatch or some kind of timepiece with hint after passing
 14 or 15 years of age.
 I was somewhat surprised that You didn't have a wristwatch or
 some watch with which you could tell the time.
 Mr. POWERS. Well, it is very hard to wear a wristwatch over this
 pressure suit.  It can he done, but I usually went. by the watches we
 had in the aircraft, itself.
 Chairman RrSSELL. About what tines of day was it when this
 unexplained explosion struck your pplane?
 Mr. PowEns. I don't remember the exact time, but I do remember it
 was close to the hour, I think just before the bow-, but which hour I
 don't know.  It was in the morning.  I was using Greenwich time.
 I have no idea what the local time was.  It could be very easy to find
 out by going back over the flight plan and following the route because
 I was very close to schedule,
 Chairman RussFLL. Unfortunately the Russians have all that;
 haven't, they?
 Mr. POWERS. They have all that I had with nie.
 Chairman RUSSELL. If you were compelled to make an estimate of
 the time that elapsed after you lost control of your plane until the
 time that you were on the ground, what would you estimate that
 time to be?
 Mr. POWERS. I have thought about this a lot and I really don't
 know.  I don't know bow fast the aircraft was falling.  I know it was
 going pretty fast, but time didn't seem to mean anything.   A second
 could Have been a minute or a minute could have been a second.  IL
 seems like   -
 Chairman RUSSELL. I am including the time that you were in your
 parachute coming down.  Would you estimate 1 minute, 2 minutes,
 3 minutes, 4 minutes?
 Mr. POWERS. It was more than that.  The parachute itself, I
 would say, was better than 10 minutes, but I really don't know.  I am
 just guessing this.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Better than 10 minutes in the parachute'?
 Mr. POWERS. Yes.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Do you think it, would have been longer or
 shorter than that after you lost control before the parachute opened?
 Mr. I owERs. I would say much shorter.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Much shorter,.  Now, these men that were
 it, that automobile that were pursuing you or following you on this
 dirt road, were they civilians or in military uniform?

 FRANCIS. GARY POWERS
 Mr. PowERS. They all had civilian clothing.
 Chairman RUSSELL. When was the first time you saw anyone in
 uniform?
 Mr. POWERS. At the second village where these men took me.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Apparently they thought you were a Russian
 when they first came up to you?
 Mr. POWERS. Probably so.  I really don't know.  It didn't take
 them long to take my pistol away, and the knife.
 Chairman RUSSELL. They had spoken to you prior to that .time;
 hadn't they?
 Mr. POWERS. Yes, but I just shook my head, didn't say a word,
 so I don't know what they thought.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Did you ever have a jetplane flame out on
 you, Mr. Powers, while you were piloting?
 Mr. POWERS. Yes, I have.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Does it make any unusual noise or give any
 unusual impetus to the plane?
 Mr. PowERS. Different aircraft react differently.  In this particu-
 lar airplane I had had -flameouts before.  Sometimes there is a
 chugging of the engine, but you know what that is.  There was no
 kind of an explosion accompayning that, and nothing that would give
 an orange light.
 Chairman RUSSELL. The orange light was something that was
 really unusual?
 Mr. POWERS. Yes, and it was apparently persistent.     It wasn't
 a flash, but all the time that I was looking out it was there, but I don't
 remember ever seeing it again.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Has there ever been any other occasion when
 you were in an airplane and. were the target of a ground-to-air missile
 or explosive or shell of any kind?
 Mr. POWERS. Not that I know of.
 Chairman RUSSELL. You have never seen  any ground-to-air
 missile explode?
 Mr. POWERS. No, I haven't.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Is that right?
 Mr. POWERS. I have seen photographs or moving pictures of
 some of our missiles shooting an aircraft down, but the ones I have
 seen, the missile hits the aircraft.
 Well, I am sure that nothing hit this aircraft.  If something did
 hit it, I am sure I would have felt it.
 Chairman RUSSELL. You did say that the plane had an impetus
 forward when it was hit?
 Mr. POWERS. Yes, sir.
 Chairman RUSSELL. When this explosion occurred evidently it oc-
 curred behind the plane?
 Mr. POWERS. That was my thinking  There was definitely a
 slight acceleration-not much, but a push.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Could you see the plane to which, you re-
 ferred or did you only see the markings of the jet plane in the atmos-
 phere?
 Mr. POWERS. This was at least an hour earlier, and I only saw the
 condensation trails themselves.  I tried to see the aircraft and.
 couldn't.  They were quite a way below and I estimated 20 miles to
 the right, but it is hard to estimate distances in the air.

 Chairman RUSSELL. That is not much range for  a jet airplane
 though, is it., 20 miles?  The main difference was the
 Mr. PowEits. The altitude.
 Chairman RUSSELL. The altitude, not the distance fronw it?
 Mr. POWERS. Yas.
 Chairman RUSSELL.  Did you see any other airplanes on that -nis-
 sion?
 Mr. POWERS.  I saw no other condensation trails or airplanes.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Have  ou ever had reason to believe that air-
 planes on any other mission' were undertaking to reach you or to
 find you"
 Mr. POWERS. Pardon?
 Chairman RUSSELL. Have you ever had any occasion to believe
 on this or any Mission that an airplane was attempting to attack the
 plan(, which you were piloting'
 Mr. Powwrats. No.  Ott this mission I can't be sure that these two
 planes that I did see or the condensation trails that I did see, I can't
 be sure that they were looking for ttte, but it Seemed odd that they
 would first. parallel my course exactly in the opposite direction and
 then a few minutes later parallel alt- course in the same direction I
 was heading.  I assume that they were looking for inc but they made
 no turns to trv to intercept or anything.
 Chairman I .ussm.L.  You said several times that you drifted to the
 right of Course?
 Mr. PoweEas. Yes.
 Chairman RUSSELL. To the right of course.  Not being it pilot,
 why is that- wvlnit, is that of course, is that the prevailing wind pushing
 to the right?
 Mr. 1POWEas. We usually have is forecast wind for different alti-
 tudes, and the flight plan is drawn up to take into consideration the
 strength of the wind, and apparently the wind information we had
 was it little wrong and the wind was stronger than the navigator
 thought. it, would be, and he had computed the course fora slower
 wind.
 Chairman RUSSELL.  You are not it navigator yourself, Mr. Powers?
 Mr. POWERS. Yes, it pilot- has to be a navigator, but I sin not it
 rated navigator.  I never was a rated navigator in the Air Force.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Had you ever itiade it parachute descent be-
 fore?
 Mr. Puwl;ltS. No, sir.
 Chairman RUSSELL. YOU Sac they didn't find this needle until
 about the third time they examined you, I believe.  Where was the
 needle hidden'
 Mr. PowwERS.  I had just dropped it loose in the pocket.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Loose in your pocket?
 Mr. PowvElcs. Yes.
 ('ha-irman RUSSELL. I Wish you Would clear up the matter of the
 needle, %Ir. Powers.
 Were you under any obligation to destroy yourself if you were
 captured:'
 Mr. PowERs. Oh, no.  I don't remember exactly who gave me, the
 needle that morning, but they told tile, "You can take it if you want
 to."  They said, "If something does happen you may be tortured.

 Maybe you could conceal this on your person in. some way, and if you
 see that you cannot withstand the torture, you might want to use it."
 And that is the reason f took the needle.  But I could have left it.
 I wasn't told to take it.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Do you have the instructions that you re-
 ceived that morning and that you usually received there before you-
 -Mr. POWERS. Do T have them.?
 Chairman RUSSELL. Yes, sir; the instructions as to your course of
 conduct in the event you fell into the hands of any enemy, potential
 enemy.
 Mr. POWERS. Well, it is hard to remember this long exactly what
 they were.
 Chairman RUSSELL. I think they are there.  You can read them.
 I think they ought to go into this record.
 Mr. POWERS. Listed here are three paragraphs:
 (a) If evasion is not feasible and capture appears imminent, pilots should
 surrender without resistance and adopt a cooperative attitude toward their
 captors.
 (b) At all times while in the custody of their captors, pilots will conduct them-
 selves with dignity and maintain a respectful attitude toward their superiors.
 (c) Pilots will be instructed that they are perfectly free to tell the full truth
 about their mission with the exception of certain specifications of the aircraft.
 They will be advised to represent themselves as civilians, to admit previous Air
 Force affiliation, to admit current CIA employment, and to make no attempt
 .to deny the nature of their mission.
 That is all.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Those instructions had been given you before
 you took off on this flight?
 Mr. POWERS. Yes.
 Chairman RUSSELL. You were thoroughly familiar with them?
 Mr. POWERS. Yes.
 Chairman RUSSELL. They were a part of your agreement with the
 CIA?
 Mr. POWERS. Yes.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Mr. Powers, were you close enough to this
 other parachute to tell whether it was occupied by a man or whether
 it just had some object in it?
 Mr. PowERS. No.  It was very high.  I don't know how high.
 I couldn't see what it was.
 I thought at the time that-well, where were a lot of thoughts run-
 fling through my mind, and I thought at the time that maybe this ex-
 plosion was caused by a rocket, and, if so, maybe this parachute was
 used to recover, say, the first stage or something.
 Actually, I have no idea what was in the parachute, but I am sure
 it was a parachute, very similar to mine.  It was a different color.
 I think it had red and white markings.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Were these people concerned about it?  Was
 there any possibility that this was a Russian in that parachute and
 that they had shot down one of their own planes in their efforts to reach
 you at your high altitude?
 Mr. POWERS.  I really don't know..
 The people just asked me if there were two of us, two Americans.
 I mean he just pointed at myself and asked if there were two, and I
 told him by sign language that there was only one, and we got in the
 car and left.

 You cannot read Russian, can you, Mr. Powers?
 Mr. POWERS.. No.
 They translated the interrogations into English for me to read and
 to correct.
 Chairman RUSSELL. And there was no evidence of that day at all
 in this record"?
 Mr. POWERS. There was definitely an interrogation on that morn-
 ing, and it was definitely not in theibooks they gave me to review.
 Cha.irmtan RUSSELL. That is what I mean: `here was nothing in
 the book that transpired that day?
 Mr. PoivLrts. Right.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Did they threaten you at any time when
 they were examining you?
 \Ir.  PoWEitS. There were no definite threats, but they didn't let
 me forget that this crime was punishable by death.  Anytime they
 would mention that it. was 7 to 15 years and death, and they wouldn't
 let me forget that.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Did you ever manifest any reluctance in
 answering the questions that they asked you or did you answer them
 immediately?
 Mr. PowEits. I refused to answer several of their questions.  I
 showed reluctance on many.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Pardon?
 Ir. PowERs. I showed reluctance on many, some that I couldn't
 see how they could be of any interest to them at all, but I was just
 reluctant in answering all questions.
 Chairman RUSSELL. That was not exactly in conformity with your
 instructions there to cooperate with your captors; was it?
 Mr. POWERS. Well, you shouldn't go overboard with this coopera-
 tion, I don't think.
 Chairman RUSSELL. You were quoted in the preys as having stated
 at your trial that you had made a terrible mistake in flying over Russia
 anti apologized to the Russian people and would never do it again
 Was that a misquotation or did you make that statement at your trial.
 ?
 Mr. Powuits. No, that wasn't a misquotation.  I made this
 statement, on the advice of my defense counsel, and also because it
 was easy to say I was sorry because what I meant by saying that and
 what I wanted them to think I meant was quite different.  My main
 sorrow was that the mission failed, and I was sorry that I was there,
 and it was causing a lot of adverse publicity to the States. But, of
 course, some of these things I couldn't say in that statement.

 Chairman RUSSELL. Was the room in which you were confined a
 cell, a jail cell, or was it just an ordinary office room?
 Mr. PowERS. No, it was part of a prison.           It had a solid door
 with a peephole in it, one window with opaque glass, and bars on
 the outside of the glass itself.  The only way I could see out was
 through a small crack at the top, and I could see part of the wall of
 the wing of the building opposite this cell, but it was definitely a
 prison.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Was it kept reasonably clean?
 Mr. POWERS. Yes, it was kept clean.
 Chairman RUSSELL. How was your food that you had there at
 the prison?
 Mr. POWERS. The food was better at the first place in Moscow
 there than it was at Vladimir at the prison there.  I couldn't eat for
 a long time, and apparently they got quite worried about it and kept
 asking me if they could get me any special foods or anything, and I
 told them "No."
 Later on I did start eating, but I never had. much of an appetite
 the whole time I was there.  There seemed to be plenty of the food
 but it is quite different from what we have here.  It consisted pre-
 dominantly of potatoes and cabbage.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Borsch and different kinds of soups?
 Mr. PowERS. Yes, at the prison in Vladimir the best part of the
 meal at lunch was a bowl of soup.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Did you ever have a roommate or did you
 occupy that cell by yourself?
 Mr. POWERS. From May 1 to September 9 I was in solitary con-
 finement.  When I moved to the other prison I had a roommate.
 Chairman RUSSELL. What had lie been charged with?
 Mr. POWERS. He was-they called it an article 58, which I think
 means crimes against the state, and he said treason.  He spoke Eng-
 lish.  He spoke four languages.  He was a Latvian.                                         He spoke Lat-
 vian, German, English, and Russian.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Do you have any reason to believe he was
 planted there to spy on you or do you think lie was a bona fide prisoner?
 Mr. PowERS. This was always in the back of my mind, but I do not
 think he was a plant.  He had a lot of stuff that he had accumulated
 over the few years that he had been there, notes that lie had taken
 while he was studying Russian written on scraps of newspaper and a
 lot of other things.  It took him a long time to accumulate what he
 had.  I feel sure that he wasn't a plant.
 Chairman RUSSELL. How long had he been in prison?
 Mr. POWERS. He was there, I think, in April of this year will be
 7 years.  This is what he told me.  His sentence was 15 years.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Did they not periodically examine your posses-
 sions? You say he had accumulated this file of material about Russian.
 They didn't go through your belongings to see whether you had any-
 thing you shouldn't have?
 Mr. POWERS. Not while we were there, anyway. Not while we were
 in the cell.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Not in any instance?
 Mr. POWERS. There were several inspection teams who came around
 the prison.  They would just come in and ask through an interpreter
 if there were any questions, any complaints, stuff like this, but they
 didn't bother us very much at all.

 what lie has given out in unclassified information, and I have listened
 to the chairman.
 My question would be this: Did I understand you correctly that
 when you were coming down in the parachute you thew away your
 instructions and threw away the snap"
 Mr. PoWEns. No, I had no written instructious with me, but I did
 have it map, and I tore that up in very small pieces and scattered it
 out in the air its I was coining down.
 Senator SALTONSTAtd,.  SO that your instructions Were in your head,
 so to speak?
 Mr. POWERS. Yes.
 Senator SALTONSTALL.   Now, did you have ai briefcase or something
 else in which these other things, your special food, and these other
 things, were that they looked through afterward'
 Mr. POwElty.  Yes.  I had what we call it seat pack.  In this seat
 pack was a collapsible rubberlifertaft, some food, some water, matches,
 several other items necessary to, soy, live off [lie land or survival in an
 unpopulated area.
 Senator SAUrONSTALL.  I it other words, nothing except survival kit''
 Mr. POWERS. Yes.    There were also some cloth maps for escape
 and evasion.

 Senator STENNIS. Mr. Chairman, I think you. have covered this
 matter fully.  I want to ask one question.
 Mr. Powers, I understand you had an attorney appointed for your
 trail.
 Mr. PowERs. Yes, that is right.
 Senator STENNIS. Did he work with you and freely advise you and
 counsel with you, give you advice?
 Mr. POWERS. Yes.  We had several meetings before the trial.
 But I didn't get to see him until, I would say, about 2 weeks before
 the trial.
 Senator STENNIS. Be rendered you a valuable service, did he?
 Mr. PowERS. Well, I really don't know.  I never did trust him
 any more than the rest of them.
 Senator STENNIS. I mean by that that lie gave you information
 and talked to you and you think you were better off at the trial than
 you would have been without his aid.  What about that?
 Mr. PowERs. I really don't know.
 Senator STENNIS. You have understood, I suppose, that at the
 time this occurred there was some publicity here, not a great deal, but
 some that was not altogether favorable to you.
 Did you know about that?
 Mr. PowERS. I have heard about this since I
 Senator STENNIS. That is just a prelude for my saying this-that it
 is with satisfaction to me that I learn that you have been fully exon-
 erated by the men who most know how to judge what you did, what
 the facts were, by your superiors and those who employed you.  Not
 only that, but they found that you have discharged all of your obliga-
 tions to your country, and it is with satisfaction to us here and I think
 to the American people to learn that, to know it is true.
 I know it makes you feel mighty good.
 Me. PowERs. There was one thing that I always remembered
 while I was there and that was that I am an American.
 Senator STE, NNIS. You are an American.
 Mr. PowERS. Right.
 Senator STENNIS. And proud of it?
 Mr. PowERs. Right.
 Senator STENNIS. That is fine.  [Applause.]  You felt that the
 American flag would finally find you and follow through and do what
 was good for you?
 Mr. POWERS. Yes, I did.

 Mr. POWERS. Yes, I did.  They took me out somewhere around
 the middle of May to a building in a park in Moscow.  The plane
 was on display there.
 Senator CASE of. South Dakota. Was there any evidence visible
 or evident to you that the plane had been tampered with or changed
 in any way after it had been brought there?
 Mr. PowERS. Well, there was quite a bit of damage.  Some parts
 were missing completely.  There were a few things that I was very

 interested in looking at myself.  I was particularly interested in the
 tail section, because I though it might be possible that [lie tail of the
 aircraft came off and this caused the incident., but on looking at that
 there- were no scorch marks. 'I'll(, paint was still intact.  So I could
 only asswne that While the engine was running the tit 11 was on the
 aircraft.  But as far as anytliiiig else, there was no way that I could
 tell whether it head been tampered with or not.  There was at lot of
 damage to every thing I saw.
 Senator CASE of Soutli Dakota. Was the tail on the plane when you
 saw it?
 Mr. PowEits. No.  It was sittin in one place by itself.
 .Senator CASE of South Dakota, You have referred to the incident
 as tin explosion.  Was there anything visibly noticeable about time
 plane that helped to form that opinion Ihaat it was an explosion, or
 was that limnp ly the filet that at time bane you felt t-he incident you
 were impelled forward?
 Mr. PowERs. Well, I beard and felt something, and it sounded like
 it very dull explosion, like something "whoomp," not at real sharp
 sound, but dull.  Then the light after this.  Looking at the aircraft
 I noticed on one of the wings (halt there were holes on one side of the
 wings, but I don't know whether this wits caused by at fragmentation
 or maybe when it hit (be ground.
 Senator CASE of Soutli Dakota. Ilow long were you in the Air
 Force.?
 Mr. PowwEas. A little more [barn 5 years.
 Senator CASE of South Dakota. During tint time did you receive
 any indoctrination, so to speak, with regard to communism?
 Mfr. Powi'ERS. This was really at long time ago.  I have seen sonic
 films while I was in the Air Force.  I think I had attended if lecture
 where a list of Communist organizations was pointed out.  There
 might have been others, but I can't remember.
 Senator CASE of South Dakota. Was your service in the Air Force
 during wartime?
 \Ir. PoivEnas. No.  Well, I entered the .fir Force during the Korean
 war, but never did get to Korea.
 Senator CASE of South Dakota. With respect. to this particular
 flight, did you have anything to do with the selection of the date for
 the flight?
 Mr. PotiwEits. No.
 Senator CASE of South Dakota. Do you know whether or not the
 timing of the flight was primarily a matter of the selection of weather
 and favorable atmospheric conditions or anything else?
 Mr. PowEits. I would assume that it depended primarily on
 weather.  I really don't know.
 Senator CASE of South Dakota. You really don't know, but that
 was your assumption?
 Mr.
 PowEits. Yes.
 Senator CASE of South Dakota. There was nothing in your experi-
 ence that would indicate anytliiiiF other than that it was a timely

 Mr. POWERS. We discussed quite a few things there.  He seemed to
 be more interested in the West than I was in Russia. and we primarily
 talked about that.

 Senator CASE of South Dakota. Latvian.
 Are you still in the employ of the Central Intelligence Agency?
 Mr. POWERS. Yes, I am.

 yourself from the Air Force, Mr. Powers?
 Mr. POWERS. First lieutenant.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Senator Symington.
 Senator SYMINGTON. Mr. Powers, what do you think hit you, or
 nearly hit you?
 Mr. POWERS. I really don't know.  I just know that there was an
 explosion, but how it got there-I feel sure that it was external to the
 aircraft, but how it got there or what it was, I have no idea.
 Senator SYMINGTON. Has anybody given you an opinion as to what
 that orange glow was?
 Mr. POWERS. Well, they stressed many, many times that they got
 me on the very first shot of a rocket, but they stressed it so much that
 I tend to disbelieve it.
 Senator SYMINGTON. Is there any possibility that you were hit
 twice, once at a higher altitude, say, a near miss, and again at a lower
 altitude?
 Mr. POWERS. No:
 There was only one explosion that I know of, and they would have
 had to have been excellent shots to hit that thing as it fell.
 Senator SYMINGTON. In the Red Star it said that-
 Major Varanoff ran out and saw in the rays of the day's sun fragments of the
 foreign plane falling down and not far from it the pilot himself.
 That could not be true if you were hit at anything like 67,000 or
 68,000 feet; could it?  You would be behind the pieces of the plane;
 would you not?
 Mr. POWERS.  Well, while I was descending in the parachute, I saw
 one piece of the plane fall.  It was a flat piece.  It may have been a
 wing or it may have been something smaller.        But it was falling like
 a leaf falls, flipping and turning, and fairly slow, but it passed me.
 I have no idea of how far away it was.
 Senator SYMINGTON. Could it have been another plane that had
 been hit?
 Mr. POWERS. No, I assumed at the time that it was part of my
 aircraft.  If it was a wing, it was a long distance off. If it was a
 smaller piece, it was closer.  That is all I can say about it.
 Senator SYMINGTON. You did your best to destroy the plane, but,
 because of the g.'s on you at the time, you were just unable to reach
 the controls; is that correct?
 Mr. POWERS. Yes, that is right.
 Senator SYMINGTON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to join you and
 other members of the committee in commending Mr. Powers for the
 way he handled himself in this unfortunate episode.  I have no
 further questions.

 with the highest traditions of service to one's country, and I con-

 not, Mr. Powers?

 your plane, carne down near where you landed?
 Mr. Powxus. No.
 At one time (luring the investigation they showed me some kind
 of a anal) that had indicated on it where different, parts of the aircraft
 fell, but I didn't recognize any of the landmarks that, I could see on
 this map.
 Senator JACKSON. And while you were in this particular village and
 litter in Sverdlovsk, did they indicate at that time. that they had
 located the phine?
 Mr. Po-,vl s. Well, people kept bringing in small pieces, pieces
 that could be carried, but, as far its indicating to me that they had
 located the. main parts of it, no.
 Senator JACKSON.  Did they indicate later that Mr. Khrushcbev
 had personally ordered the shooting down of your aircraft by a rocket'.'
 Mr. PowERs. I don't think so.  I don't remember that his naive
 entered into it.
 Senator JACKSON. 1 asked that because the story was carried, I
 believe, in the American press, based on, of course, a story out of
 Moscow from one of the official Soviet nee=s agencies.
 But they did not indicate that to y-ou?

 I didn't understand very much of what went on, on this.  But there
 was no direct attempt for someone to come in and talk to me about
 any of this.
 Senator JACKSON. Did they indicate that you might be let out
 earlier than your sentence provided for?
 Mr. POWERS. No.
 Sometime-I think right after the trial-someone mentioned that
 there might be such things as exchanges, and I said, "Is that right?"
 And he said, "Yes, but we don't have any Soviet spies in the
 United States."
 But that is the only indication I had.
 Senator JACKSON. When did you first get an idea that they had
 changed their mind about that?
 Mr. POWERS. The first I knew about it was about 7:30 at night on
 the 7th of February.
 Senator JACKSON. This year?
 Mr. POWERS. This year, yes.
 I didn't know what was going on, but I knew that something was
 going on.  Some men came in with an interpreter and asked me if I
 would like to accompany them to Moscow tomorrow, and added,
 "Without any guards," so I immediately assumed something was
 going on.  I didn't know what.
 We got to Moscow, spent the night there, and they told me that
 night that we would go to Berlin the next morning.  I still didn't
 know what was happening.
 Senator JACKSON. At least you were moving west, though?
 Mr. POWERS. Yes, and I was very glad to take this trip.  Actually,
 they never did tell me that Colonel Abel was involved in this.
 I am sure they knew that I would find out the minute I stepped
 across the line, but, up until that time, it was just the goodness of
 their h.carts and not anything else.
 Senator JACKSON. Just a voluntary act on their part?
 Mr. POWERS. Yes.
 Senator JACKSON. They did not indicate that anyone else was
 being exchanged?
 Mr. POWERS. No.
 Senator JACKSON. Mr. Chairman, I want to conclude by saying
 that I associate myself with the remarks previously made here.  I
 think it is quite clear from what we have heard this morning and now
 that Mr. Powers has lived up to his contract.

 Senator BEALL. Mr. Chairman, I have no questions.  I do want to
 associate myself with you and the balance of the committee in com-

 has been very frank with us and. I congratulate him.

 Mr. PoWEIts. I don't remember the exact date that they told me
 when the trial would take place, but when they did tell me I was
 very curious to know why the first day of the trial fell on my birthday,
 and I asked them about this.  They said that it was just a coincidence.
 Somewhere around the lst of August, I met the. Soviet-appointed
 defense counsel for the first time.  I had three or four sessions with
 him, not very long ones.
 Ile made a lot, of suggestions of things I should do.  Actually it
 didn't seem that he did too much work or didn't seem to be extremely
 interested in the case, or this was my impression.
 I guess most everyone here knows about the trial.
 [ think that has been fairly highly publicized.  It was a very tense
 time. for me.
 The only good part about the whole thing was the last day, when
 I was allowed to see my relatives for the first time.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Do you feel that you were treated harshly by
 the Russians, Mr. Powers?
 Mr. PowmRs. No, I was treated much better than I expected to be
 treated.
 Chairman RUSSELL. Ilow about the sentence that was imposed
 on you at the conclusion, after you pled guilty?
 Mr. POWERS. 1 expected much worse.
 Chairman RUSSELL. You expected it more severe sentence than you
 received?
 Mr. POWERS. Up until the time of the prosecutor's speech where he
 only asked for 15 years, I expected death, but after he had asked for
 that I thought it would be 15 years or just a little under, maybe 12
 to 15 years.
 Chairman RUSSELL. 1 believe they don't have a jury in Russia.
 Mr. PowLns. No.  it was three judges and that is it.

 Chan-1111111 RUSSELL. Did the prosecutor make any argument to

 stances you did, Mr. Powers.  At the time I was there I found Moscow
 to be exactly different.  I got a good bed and very poor food, and out
 in the country the bed was terrible but the food was edible, so my
 experience was exactly the reverse of yours.  I don't think I would
 try to visit your way, though.

 (The following is an unclassified summary of the results of the in-
 terrogation by the Central Intelligence Agency of Francis Gary
 Powers since his release by the Soviet Union:)
 STATEMENT CONCERNING FRANCIS GARY POWERS
 Since his return from imprisonment by Soviet Russia, Francis Gary Powers
 has undergone a most intensive debriefing by CIA and other intelligence specialists,
 aeronautical technicians, and other experts concerned with various aspects of his
 mission and subsequent capture by the Soviets.  This was followed by a complete
 review by a board of inquiry presided over by Judge E. Barrett Prettyman to
 determine if Powers complied with the terms of his employment and his obliga-
 tions as an American.  The board has submitted its report to the Director of
 Central Intelligence.
 Certain basic points should be kept in mind in connection with this case.  The
 pilots involved in the U-2 program were selected on the basis of aviation pro-
 ficiency, physical stamina, emotional stability, and, of course, personal security.
 They were not selected or trained as espionage agents, and the whole nature of the
 mission was far removed from the traditional espionage scene.  Their job was to
 fly the plane, and it was so demanding an assignment that on completion of a
 mission physical fatigue was a hazard on landing.
 The pilots' contracts provided that they perform such services as might be
 required and follow such instructions and briefings in connection therewith as were
 given to them by their superiors.  The guidance was as follows:
 "(a) If evasion is not feasible and capture appears imminent, pilots should
 surrender without resistance and adopt a cooperative attitude toward their
 captors.
 `(b) At all times while in the custody of their captors, pilots will conduct
 themselves with dignity and maintain a respectful attitude toward their superiors.
 (c) Pilots will be instructed that they are perfectly free to toll the full truth
 about their mission with the exception of certain specifications of the aircraft.
 They will be advised to represent themselves as civilians, to admit previous Air
 Force affiliation, to admit current CIA employment, and to make no attempt to
 deThey the nature of their mission."
 were instructed, therefore, to be cooperative with their captors within
 limitations, to use their own judgment of what they should attempt to withhold,
 and not to subject themselves to strenuous hostile interrogation.  It has been
 established that Mr. Powers had been briefed in accordance with this policy and
 so understood his guidance.  In regard to the poison needle which was prominently
 mentioned at the trial in Moscow, it should be emphasized that this was intended
 for use primarily if the pilot were subjected to torture or other circumstances
 which in his discretion warranted the taking of his own life.   There were no
 instructions that he should commit suicide and no expectation that he would do
 so except in those situations just described, and I emphasize that even taking the
 needle with him in the plane was not mandatory; it was his option.
 Mr. Powers' performance on prior missions has been reviewed, and it is clear
 that he was one of the outstanding pilots in the whole U-2 program.  He was
 proficient both as a flyer and as a navigator and showed himself calm in emergency
 situations.  His security background has been exhaustively reviewed, and any
 circumstances which might conceivably have led to pressure from or defection to

 the Russians have also been exhaustively reviewed, and no evidence has been
 found to support any theory that failure of his flight might be laid to Soviet
 espionage activities. The same is true of the possibilities of sabotage.
 Accordingly, Mr. Powers was assigned to the mission that eventually occurred
 on May 1, 1960, and accepted the assignment willingly.  It was a particularly
 grueling assignment across the heart of Soviet Russia and ending on the north-
 west coast of -Norway.  It was necessary to maintain extreme altitude at heights
 at which no other plane but the U-2 had steadily flown. So far as can be ascer-
 tained Mr. Powers followed the scheduled flight plan, making a prescribed turn
 to the northwest when nearing the city of Sverdlovsk where he was directly on
 course.  According to his statement, he had settled on his new course and had
 Sverdlovsk in sight, perhaps 20 or 30 miles away, when he felt and heard some-
 thing he describes as a push or feeling of acceleration on the plane accompanied
 by a dull noise unlike the sharp sound of a high explosive.  This caused Win to
 look up from his instruments, and he saw surrounding him, or perhaps reflected
 in his canopy, he is not sure, an orange or reddish glare which seemed to persist.
 He felt this phenomenon to be external to the plane but says he cannot be sure.
 For a moment the plane continued to fly normally, then it dipped to the right
 but he found he was able to control this dip and level the plane with his normal
 controls.  Shortly thereafter, however, the plane began to nose forward, and
 Mr. Powers states that as he drew back on the stick he felt no control as if the
 control lines had been severed.  The plane nosed sharply over and went into
 violent maneuver, at which point he believes the wings came off.  The hull of
 the plane then turned completely over and he found himself in an inverted spin
 with the nose high revolving around the center of the fuselage so that all he could
 see through the canopy looking ahead was the sky revolving around the nose of
 the plane.  This motion exerted g. forces on him which threw him forward and
 up in the cockpit.  At this point he states he could have reached the destruct
 switches which would have set off an explosive charge in the bottom of the plane.
 However, he realized that this charge would go off in 70 seconds and he did not
 vet know if he could leave the plane.  He stated that he tried to draw himself
 back into the seat to see if he could activate the ejection mechanism, but the g.
 forces prevented him from recovering his position.  Being forward and out of the
 seat, even if he could have used the ejection mechanism, which was below and
 behind him, it would have seriously injured him if activated.  He recalled that
 it was possible to open the canopy manually, and shortly thereafter he was able
 to do so and the canopy disappeared.  His last recollection of the altimeter was
 that he was at about 34,000 feet and descending rapidly. To see if he could get
 out of the cockpit, he released his seat belt and was immediately thrown forward
 out over the cowling of the cockpit to a position where lie was held only by his
 oxygen tube. lie tried to pull himself back in the cockpit to the destruct switches
 which take four separate manipulations to set and found himself unable to do so
 because of the g. forces, the inflation of his pressure suit, and the fogging up of
 his face mask which totally obscured his view.  By pushing he tore loose the
 oxygen tube and fell free, whereupon his parachute opened almost immediately,
 indicating that he was probably at 15,000 feet or below at this time since the
 automatic mechanism was set for this height. In connection with Powers' efforts
 to operate the destruct switches, it should be noted that the basic weight limita-
 tions kept the explosive charge to 2% pounds and the purpose of the destruct
 inechanisni was to render inoperable the precision camera and other equipment,
 not to destroy them and the film.  After he landed he was taken by commercial
 plane to Moscow the same day.
 In the processing into the prison he was given a hypodermic injection which
 may well have been a general immunization, and there is no evidence of the use
 of truth serums or other drugs.  From then until the time of the trial, about 100
 days, he was kept in solitary confinement and subjected to constant interrogation,
 sometimes as long as 10 or 12 hours a day, but on the average considerably less
 than this.  lie had no access to anyone but his Itussian guards and interrogators
 despite repeated requests for contact with the U.S. Embassy or his family and
 friends.  He states that the interrogation was not intense in the sense of physical
 violence or severe hostile methods, and that in some respects he was able to resist
 answering specific questions.  As an example, his interrogators were interested
 in the names of people participating in the project, and he states that he tried to,
 anticipate what names would become known and gave those, such as the names
 of his commanding officer and certain other personnel at his home base in Adana,
 Turkey, who would probably be known in any case to the Russians.  However,

 FRANCIS GARY POWERS                     25
 they accepted this position.  It is his stated belief, therefore, that the information
 he gave was that which in all probability would be known in any case to his
 captors.
 At his trial he had only the advice of his Russian defense counsel to go by,
 and he advised that unless Powers pleaded guilty to what the Russians considered
 a clear violation of domestic law and expressed penitence, matters would go hard
 for him, including a possible death sentence. These actions were consistent with
 his instructions from CIA.  After the trial and sentencing, Mr. Powers states
 that there was only intermittent interrogation of little importance and that on
 the whole he was well treated, adequately fed, and given medical attention when
 required.
 All the facts concerning Mr. Powers' mission, the descent of his plane, his
 capture, and his subsequent actions have been subjected to intensive study.  In
 the first place, Powers was interrogated for many days consecutively by a debrief-
 ing team of experienced interrogators, one of whose duties was to evaluate Powers'
 credibility.  They expressed the unanimous view that Powers was truthful in his
 account.  Secondly, an intensive inquiry was made by Government officials into
 the background, life history, education, conduct, and character of Powers. This
 team included doctors, specialists in psychiatry and psychology, personnel officers,
 his former colleagues in the Air Force and on the U-2 project. All these persons
 were of the view that Powers is inherently and by practice a truthful man.
 Thirdly, Powers appeared before a board of inquiry and testified at length, both
 directly and under cross-examination.  The board agreed that in his appearance
 he appeared to be truthful, frank, straightforward, and without any indicated
 attempt to evade questions or color what he was saying. In the board's judgment
 he reflected an attitude of complete candor.  In the fourth place, when during
 his examination before the board a question was raised as to the accuracy of one
 of his statements, he volunteered with some vehemence that, although he disliked
 the process of the polygraph, he would like to undergo a polygraph test.  That
 test was subsequently duly administered by an expert and in it he was examined
 on all of the factual phases which the board considered critical in this inquiry.
 The report by the polygraph operator is that he displayed no indications of devia-
 tion from the truth in the course of that examination. In the fifth place, a study
 of the photograph of the debris of the plane and other information concerning
 the plane revealed in the opinion of experts making the study no condition which
 suggested an inconsistency with Powers' account of what had transpired.  The
 board noted the testimony of Russian witnesses at the trial in Moscow which
 dealt with the descent and capture of Powers and with technical features of the
 plane and the incident.
 The testimony was consistent with the account given by Powers.  Powers was
 able to identify a spot near a small village where he thought he had landed.
 This location checked with prior testimony given by Powers as to physical
 features, directions, and distances and also corresponded with earlier independent
 information not known to Powers that certain of the persons who captured him
 lived in this same small village.  Some information from confidential sources was
 available.  Some of it corroborated Powers and some of it was inconsistent in
 parts with Powers' story, but that which was inconsistent was in part contra-
 dictory with itself and subject to various interpretations.  Some of this infor-
 mation was the basis for considerable speculation shortly after the May 1 episode
 and subsequent stories in the press that Powers' plane had descended gradually
 from its extreme altitude and had been shot down by a Russian fighter at medium
 altitude.  On careful analysis, it appears that the information on which these
 stories were based was erroneous or was susceptible of varying interpretations.
 The board came to the conclusion that it could not accept a doubtful interpreta-
 tion in this regard which was inconsistent with all the other known facts and
 consequently rejected these newspaper stories as not founded in fact.
 On all the information available, therefore, it is the conclusion of the board
 of inquiry which reviewed Mr. Powers' case and of the Director of Central
 Intelligence, who has carefully studied the board's report and has discussed it
 with the board, that Mr. Powers lived up to the terms of his employment and
 instructions in connection with his mission and in his obligations as an American
 under the circumstances in which he found himself.  It should be noted that
 competent aerodynamicists and aeronautical engineers have carefully studied
 Powers' description of his experience and have concluded on the basis of scientific
 analysis that a U-2 plane damaged as he described would perform in its descent
 in about the manner he stated.  Accordingly, the amount due Mr. Powers under
 the terms of his contract will be paid to him.
