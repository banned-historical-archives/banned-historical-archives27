 September 1972
 TERRORISM AND THE FEDAYEEN
 Since mid-1970, elements of the fedayeen or Palestine guer-
 rilla movement have metamorphosed commandos dedicated to the over-
 throw of Israel into                               Marxist-Maoist-type terrorists.  They are
 making a desperate attempt to survive in a disunited, uncoordinated,
 and crumbling movement.  While once market places from Morocco to
 Saudi Arabia were plastered with posters proudly depicting the deeds
 of the fed.ayeen commandos, today the ruthless and violent actions
 by their terrorists evoke mainly fear.  None but the most radical
 press or public is tempted to look upon the fedayeen terrorists
 or their followers as romantic folk-heroes or to view their violence
 as acts of patriotism.
 The Origins
 Palestinian guerrillas ffedayeen), organized in the early
 1.950's to harass newly created Israel, seek to become a rallying
 point for Palestinian irredentism.  Their fortunes and following
 were low until the 1967 six-day Arab-Israeli war.  The fedayeen
 by their bold, but ultimately self-defeative, anti-Israeli exploits
 rekindled a spark of Arab self-respect and served to restore a
 sense of Arab honor.  A range of competing guerrilla organizations
 emerged - each seeking to become the reflection of Palestinian will
 to fight.  Eleven fedayeen organizations have survived, most of them
 members of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) founded in
 1964 to coordinate fedayeen and Palestinian efforts.  They may be
 categorized as follows:
 a.  Instruments of Political Parties:  Al Saiqa, founded
 and directe   y t e Syrian let-wing  aath Party; the Iraqi-
 controlled Arab Liberation Front; Al Ansar, the instrument of
 established Arab Communist parties.
 b.  Fatah:  Fatah poses as a basically "conservative"
 guerrilla organization devoid of political bias but in fact
 supports extreme guerrilla tactics through its front, the
 Black September Group.
 c.  Ideologically Oriented Groups:  These include the
 Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) with a
 number of offshoots.  Political extremists and revolution-
 aries, they consider the overthrow of conservative Arab regimes
 (Jordan and Saudi Arabia) as prerequisites for the liberation
 of Palestine.  Their hostility to the U.S. and most Western
 countries is intense.

 Terror Tactics and Foreign Connections
 The status of Palestinian fedayeen organizations is directly
 related to the level of tension in the Arab-Israel dispute:  a
 decrease in tension leads to a decline in the prestige of and
 support for the fedayeen.  The fedayeen organizations whose impact
 on Middle East affairs has been on the decline since their setback
 by the Jordanian Army during the 10-day conflict of September 1970,
 are seeking to rally their flagging fortunes.  Their increasing
 links with other national revolutionary/terrorist groups and their
 continuing terrorist acts on an international level are intended
 to (a) compensate for their eroding influence, (b) move the resis-
 tance movement out of its doldrums and (c) keep the Arab-Israeli
 issue alive.
 The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP),
 believed to have the widest range of international links, is com-
 peting with other fedayeen groups and expanding its revolutionary
 activities at the international level.  The only philosophical
 basis required to establish international connections is a common
 conviction in terrorism and violent revolution as the means to
 destroy the established order.  The common bond among revolution-
 ary groups, therefore, can be reinforced with relative ease.
 In addition, the material gain from international revolutionary
 action is not overlooked by fedayeen leaders, many of whom exploit
 the Palestinian cause to bolster their personal prestige and fortunes.
 The Kamikaze attack on Israel's Lydda Airport last May by
 PFLP-trained members of the Japanese Red Army Faction, highlights
 the existing and growing international connections among revolution-
 ary terrorist organizations.  Even before the Lydda Airport
 massacre, the Japanese Red Army Faction had been dealing with the
 fedayeen for at least two years.  Other terrorist organizations,
 the Turkish Peoples' Liberation Army and the Eritrean Liberation
 Front in Ethiopia have also been in contact with Palestinian
 guerrilla organizations as have radical organizations of Western
 Europe and the Western Hemisphere.  The Soviet Union and China
 are also involved.  For both material and ideological reasons,
 and out of an increasing sense of desperation, the fedayeen are
 continually attempting to expand their contacts with foreign
 radical groups.
 The Red Army Faction (Sekigun-ha), a direct offshoot of
 Zengakuren, the extreme leftist Japanese student organization, is
 an underground organization that began its activities on the
 political and military levels in 1965.  Violent revolution, in its
 view, is the "fundamental way of liberating people from exploitation
 and class domination domestically, and a means to combat imperialism
 on the international level."  Links between the Red Army Faction
 and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) became

 evident in late 1970 with the arrest in Japan of PFLP members
 publicizing terror via a film on Palestinian guerrilla operations.
 During their stay in Japan PFLP members also made arrangements
 to train Red Army Faction members at PFLP bases in Lebanon.  In
 addition, plans were made to exchange officials for instruction
 in. kidnapping and hijacking techniques and in producing sabotage
 devices.  Beirut weekly Al Usbu Al Arabi reported last fall that
 when a PFLP leader visited Japan, The Red Army Faction "welcomed
 him by blowing up five police stations in Tokyo."
 Turkish Peoples' Liberation Arm .  Although the Turkish
 Peoples' Liberation Army was not   own as such until early 1972,
 militant leftist Turkish students were reportedly trained by the
 fedayeen as early as 1969.  Training in such terrorist tactics
 as kidnapping, hijacking, guerrilla warfare, and preparation in
 the use of sabotage devices are provided by the fedayeen organi-
 zations under cover of Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and
 Syria.  It is reliably -reported that urban guerrillas, in
 addition to being trained by PFLP and its breakaway faction
 Peoples' Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PDFLP),
 are equipped with arms smuggled from these and other fedayeen
 guerrilla organizations.
 Eritrean Liberation Front.  The Eritrean Liberation Front,
 founded 1n 1959, began effective anti-Ethiopian terrorist acts
 in 1964.  Following the June 1967 war, fedayeen organizations
 began to provide the Eritrean Liberation Front financial support,
 arms and passports for its attacks against the Ethiopian established
 order.  Training in guerrilla warfare as well as facilities for
 radio broadcasting are made available to the Front by the fedayeen.
 West Europeans.  In an attempt to gain the support of West
 European students, fedayeen organizations have recruited and
 provided travel to a Jordanian training camp for as many as 150
 students.  The project was administered through a London-based
 organization, "Friends of Palestine."  Pro-fedayeen and anti-
 Israeli associations in France are usually headed by radical
 university professors or journalists.  In England, student
 "revolutionaries" have joined Arab students in a group called
 the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. 'In the Netherlands, Dutch
 Communists have established a Netherlands-Palestine Committee;
 'that sponsors lectures and pro-Palestinian demonstrations.
 Austrian left-wing students have formed the Action Committee for
 the Support of the Palestinian Resistance, to conduct anti-Israeli
 campaigns.  The Irish Republican Army (IRA) claims links with the
 fedayeen; some fedayeen members allege to have attended IRA
 conferences in Northern Ireland.  Further, the IRA has reportedly
 been promised arms in exchange for fedayeen-directed terrorist
 operations in Europe.  The Baader-Meinhof group, a band of West
 German anarchists whose actions date back to 1963, declare them-
 selves as members of the Japanese-based Red Army Faction.

 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194AO00200120001-1
 Reportedly, Baader-Meinhof members received guerrilla warfare
 training in the Middle East from Palestinian guerrillas during the
 summer of 1970.
 Western Hemisphere.  Before September 1970, members of the
 Sandinist National Li eration Front, a Communist dominated Nicaraguan
 terrorist organization, received guerrilla warfare training at a
 fedayeen training site in Jordan.  Upon completion of their training
 and their return to Nicaragua, the Sandinists received Soviet and
 Chinese weapons which were later-confiscated by Nicaraguan security
 officials.  In January 1972, a planned attempt by five Nicaraguan-
 based Arabs to recruit Nicaraguans for fedayeen training in guerrilla
 warfare also was aborted by Nicaraguan government officials.
 The Fedayeen, the Soviet Union and China
 The Soviets, in a quandary over the fedayeen, support the
 anti-Israeli "national liberation" movement but are sensitive to the
 potential damage to their image for being openly associated with
 fedayeen terror tactics.  The Soviets therefore channel material
 support to the fedayeen through indirect and clandestine means and
 in the process gain some degree of control over the fedayeen
 guerrilla organizations.  Fedayeen chieftain Yasser Arafat's mid-
 July 1972 visit to Moscow to solicit increased material support
 and at the same time strengthen his weakened leadership position
 in both Fatah and the Palestinian Liberation Organization, attests
 to the cordial relations between the Soviets and the fedayeen.
 As recently as May 1972, the World Marxist Review Quotes Pravda's
 endorsement of the Palestinian guerrillas as follows:  "The Soviet
 public sides firmly with the Palestine Resistance Movement, which
 is a component of the Arab Peoples' National Liberation Movement."
 By supporting the fedayeen, the Soviets align themselves with
 a militant, anti-Israeli "national liberation" movement that is
 popular in the Arab world.  At this stage of development, Soviet
 dealings with the fedayeen indicate Moscow's confidence in providing
 indirect and clandestine support to the fedayeen short of causing
 flash point tensions in the Middle East.  In part, the Soviets'
 assistance  to the fedayeen guerrillas is conditioned by the open
 support given them by China.  Peking backs the fedayeen in public
 statements with vigor; material support, however, is provided with
 somewhat dampened enthusiasm.  To date, China has provided guer-
 rilla warfare training to several hundred fedayeen activists and
 has made available to them unspecified amounts of military equip-
 ment.                 An article in the 20 July 1972 issue of Soviet Analyst
 entitled "The Soviet Involvement in Violence" by Brian Crozier,
 focuses on the dilemma the fedayeen poses for its communist
 supporters:

 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000200120001-1
 "To the extent that the (Palestine) guerrillas are
 anti-Israeli, the Russians are inclined to support them;
 on the other hand, the groups have proved, on the whole,
 to be a greater menace to the Arab governments than to
 Israel itself, and to support them outright might be
 counter-productive in terms of Soviet relations with
 friendly countries, such as Egypt or Iraq.  Moreover, the
 Palestinians have a record of unsuccess, with which the
 Russ,ans?do-not wish to be associated; and the wildest
 among them -- Dr. George Habbash's PFLP are not only
 boastful where the Russians would prefer discretion,
 but indulge in spectacular acts of violence with which,
 again, the Russians would prefer not be linked. . .
 "There has certainly been some Soviet aid to the
 PFLP, however, and to the more moderate Al Fatah, if
 only to be able to claim, if challenged, that th
 e
 Palestine liberation movement has not been left unaided.
 (Chinese aid to the PFLP is certainly greater than
 Russian.)"
 Uncertainties occasioned by Egypt's recent ouster of the
 Soviet Military Mission and the pledged merger of Egypt and
 Libya render the fedayeen increasingly vulnerable to manipulation
 not only by Moscow and Peking but by the self-serving leaders of
 the fedayeen guerrillas.
 Outlaws Among Their Own People
 Founded in 1956 and headed by Yasir Arafat, a Jerusalem-born
 Palestinian, Fatah gained control of the Palestine Liberation
 Organization (PLO) in 1969.  Fatah, larger and more heavily,
 financed than all other fedayeen groups combined, claims to be
 without political bias and seeks the friendship of all Arab
 governments; it is supported by, such disparate tegimes as Saudi
 Arabia and Libya.  Even though heavily financed, Fatah uses such
 terror tactics as hijacking and sabotage through its terrorist
 the "Black September Group," as an additional source of
 income.  The "Black September Group" ?abes Fatah to credibly
 disclaim its alliance with assassinations, hijacking and other
 forms of terrorism.,
 While Fatah presents itself as an organization of strugglers
 who battle in the front lines for their "occupied homeland" it is
 in fact involved in money-making schemes that are far removed
 from its original national revolutionary mission.  Fatah's image
 as a moderate organization unencumbered by ideology is studiously
 promoted by its propaganda to permit Fatah to gain broad-based
 political acceptance,  Sympathy for the Palestinian cause is
 translated into direct contributions from Arab states of varying
 political persuasion.  In addition, a moderate image permits the

 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000200120001-1
 establishment of offices for fund raising throughout the world.
 Because of its dominant role in that organization, a Palestine
 Liberation Organization (PLO) office is often merely a cover for
 a Fatah office.  Nevertheless, despite this ostensibly Ymoderate
 image," the "Black September" terrorist organization remains
 directly associated with and under the control of Fatah.
 Publicly, Fatah denounces terrorists acts conducted outside
 the Middle East but in practice engages in hijacking, sabotage
 and political assassination as a source of income which to date
 has grossed more than $100 million.  These funds are transferred
 to European bank accounts and later invested in business ventures
 that promise a good return.  Some of the ventures involve legiti-
 mate investment in European stocks; others include the establish-
 ment of "action cells" of which several exist in West Germany
 and France.  These "action cells" provide arms and explosives and
 serve as bases for recruiting and training terrorists.  A favored
 fund raising technique is for Fatah representatives to accept
 "contracts" for such specialized assignments as:  elimination of
 political opponents, kidnapping an exile, exploding a refinery,
 smuggling and hijacking.
 Such acts are carried out by the "Black September Group"
 whose operations are said to be planned and implemented by the
 heads of the Fatah intelligence unit.  In addition to claiming
 responsibility for the tragedy at the Munich Olympics on 5 Septem-
 ber, the group has also claimed credit for the following actions
 since November 1971:  the assassination of Jordanian Prime Minister
 Wasfi Tal in Cairo on 28 November 1971; an assassination attempt
 against the Jordanian Ambassador to London Zayd Al Rifa on 15
 December 1971; the sabotage of the Struever Electronics factory
 in Hamburg on 5 February 1972; the murder of five Palestinians
 in Bruehl, Germany, on 6 February 1972; and the hijacking of a
 Sabena jet en route to Tel Aviv on 8 May 1972.
 As reported in the New York Times, 4 August 1972, a 21-year-
 old Arab woman accused of taking par  in the hijacking of a
 Belgian airliner in May said that she had made several unsuccess-
 ful attempts to free herself from the grip of the Fatah
 guerrilla organization.  She testified that she was warned by
 the fedayeen:  "If you escape, we would kill you."
 The Palestinian News Agency, 5 August 1972, reported that
 Palestinian guerril as o  t e   lack September" terrorist
 organization blew up tanks at the Trieste oil--storage facility
 "in accordance with the Black September organization's policy
 of dealing blows to the enemies of the Palestinian revolution."
 Istanbul's leading daily newspaper, Cumhuriyet, reported
 on 14 June that guerrilla groups are involved in tthe drug traffic;
 that Fatah has penetrated Turkish smuggling rings, established

 courier routes from Turkey to Lebanon and is expanding its contacts
 with overseas narcotic rings to finance its (Fatah's) guerrilla
 operations.  Fatah involvement in narcotics is so flagrant that
 some of the half-kilo nylon bags of hashish pushed in Europe are
 labelled with pictures of an Arab guerrilla armed with the
 Kaleshnikov submachine gun (standard Soviet infantry rifle).
 It is ironic that Palestinians, used as pawns by Arab and
 other politicians for more than 50 years, are currently being used
 by the very fedayeen orginially organized to battle for their
 "occupied homeland."  About 1.4 million Palestinians registered
 as refugees with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA)
 survive on funds from UNRWA while Fatah, the largest and best
 financed exponent of the Palestinian cause, exploits Palestinian
 suffering to build an underworld empire that makes its own laws
 and seeks self-perpetuation as its prime objective.

 nations on Israel's borders still harbor-
 ing the  anti-Israeli  commandos.  Last
 year, in a virtual civil war, Jordan liqui-
 dated the guerrilla presence. Egypt has
 never permitted operations by the Pal-

 however, raised the possibility of a wider
 conflict being set off in the Middle East.
 After Israeli air raids on guerrilla
 bases in Syria, planes of the Syrian Air
 Force attacked Israeli towns
 -the first such air strikes
 since the Mideast war of
 1967.
 But the immediate impact
 of the Israeli action was this:
 The Palestinian guerrillas are
 deep in trouble in the two
 regions where they are still
 pernlillyd to operate.
 In Lvha ou, tho question
 wvas [thickly raised: Can the
 omitrw  afford to continue
 arhnring Palestinian com-
 andos?
 Signs are multiplying that
 he Government has decided
 t cannot.
 The  Israeli  assault  has
 nought ]ionic to the Leba-
 wr:,rl will no longer tolerate
 presence of commandos
 its borders, and will
 ?:?'d Lebanon directly respon-
 ible for any operations
 car-ed out from within Lebanon. The out-
 I ok for Lebanon is that more Lebanese
 ire likely to he killed, that Israel even-
 rally could occupy the southern part of
 he country.
 The problem is whether the Lebanese
 an find any way to rid themselves of
 he   commandos-or  neutralize  them-
 without sparking a bloody conflict with-
 in Lebanon itself. The conflict might
 even lead to civil war.
 Bitter, frustrated. The 5,000 Pales-
 tinian commandos who have been holed
 up in the mountainous area of southeast-
 ern Lebanon are only the tip of the ice-
 berg of the Palestinian presence in this
 country. Altogether, there are 350,000
 Palestinians in Lebanon-more than 15
 per cent of the entire population.
 Of these,  85,000 live  in  refugee
 camps. Large numbers of them own
 weapons. Practically all of them are
 bitter, frustrated people who are capa-
 ble of irrational violence.
 Few observers doubt that, in a show-
 down, the Lebanese armed forces would
 be victorious over the commandos. But
 the result might destroy the very struc-
 ture of the Lebanese regime, which is
 built an if drliratv balance of a half-
 Mn?dr.m, half-Christian population.
 There is little doubt, however, that
 the Lebanese will try to contain the
 commandos, one way or another.   os
 Lebanese regard the Palestinians as
 strangers in their country. Says one Bei-
 rut businessman:
 "If we could just get rid of those
 Palestinians, we would have no problems
 with Israel."
 Letting rid of them, on the other
 hand erntlrl lie a messy business.
 Many of the refugee camps are in the
 outskirts of the capital city of Beirut.
 Sonic observers fear that an aroused Pal.
 estinian population would be capable of
 isolating  Beirut,  at  least  temporarily,
 from its power, light and water supplies.
 There is also a tiny but tough minority
 of left-wing Lebanese who might give
 aid to the Palestinians in their attempts
 to resist any crackdown on the com-
 mandos. This is what could lead to Leba-
 nese fighting Lebanese.
 In the face of this, the Lebanese Cov-
 crnmen                                                                                  is moving cautiously h. i0, H"
 forts to contain  the  commandos.  Its
 opening action was to send the Leba-
 nese Army into the guerrilla-held border
 territory, the first such occupation in
 two wears.
 Reaction in Syria. The Syrians also
 find the coniniando presence atwktward,
 and for years have hobbled them with
 restrictions.
 But as the noose tightened around the
 guerrillas in Lebanon, there was a resur-
 gence of commando activity on the Syrian
 border with Israel. And the Israeli reac-
 tion to that was air strikes at the  guer-
 rilla encampments-which called forth
 retaliation by the Syrian Air Force.
 What seemed to stand out in all this
 was the new sense of determination in
 Israel's campaign. against the commandos.
 The Palestine guerrillas, many observ-
 ers believe, could now be in their final
 death struggle.

 ?.9'hey obeyed their orders.
 They were fantastic people."
 In an apartment on one of
 Beirut's main thoroughfares,
 Balsam Zayix, spokesman for
 the Popular Front for the Lib-
 eration of Palestine (PFLP),
 heaped delighted praise on
 the three Japanese terrorists
 Who ball  turned  Tel  Aviv
 airport into a bloodbath Tues-
 day night.
 "They were trained by us
 here in  the  Arab  world,"
 Zayix said. The mission of the
 Japanese trio. he said, was "to
 raise  the  temperature" of
 Arab-Israeli hostility. "I fore-
 -tee that coming through Is-
 raeli reprisals-perhaps suc-
 t:, fttl tsraeli reprisals-and
 the Arab reaction to them,"
 he said.
 "Our operation could mark
 a turning point."
 While  the  PFLP  waited
 with anticipation for ' repri-
 sals, officials in Lebanon and
 other Arab nations wailed
 with   apprehension. Special
 security cautions were taken
 at Beirut airport.
 And in Tokyo, the Jap-
 anese government and press
 reacted with shock and dis-
 gust.  We can't believe it,"
 most officials said.
 The government expressed
 its regret to Israel that Jap-
 anese  nationals  were  in-
 volved in the attack. And
 Israeli Premier Golda 111cir
 told  a  special  session of
 Parlianwnt that she did not
 regard the three gunmen as
 representatives   of  t h e i r
 country... The friendly rela-
 tions between Israel and Ja-
 pan will remain unhamper-
 ed " she said.
 As well as Tokyo police
 could determine initially, the
 three terrorists were nmem-
 bers  of the  United  Red
 ,%rmy. an extremist, revolu-
 taonary organization.
 Together with a n o t h e r
 Japanese radical group, the
 United Red Army has been
 linked with the murders of
 it police and defense offi-
 cials since September, 19117.
 Earlier this year, 12 meni-
 Iitrs of the United Red Army
 Were  discovered  slain  fly
 their eontratles in an intra-
 faetiun purge.
 in    March,  1970,  several
 "soldiers" of the group hi-
 jacked a Japanese Airlines
 plane to North Korea. Later,
 other "soldiers" went to Bei-
 rutto slake contact with the
 PFLP.
 Last October, police re-
 ported. an Arab member of
 the PFLP, identified as Ru-
 vashi Ghanen, went to Japan
 and met with members of
 the United Tied Army. The
 two groups issued jointly a
 hooklet entitled "Arab Guer-
 rill is and the World lied
 Army,"
 Israel's  National  Police
 Agency said there were four
 known Japanese "ultra rad-
 icals"                                            in  Israel.  One  of
 them,  Mrs.  Fusako     Shi-
 genobu, 25, is believed to be
 the official representative of
 the United Red Army to the
 PFLP.
 The PleLP dismissed any
 suggestions that the Pales-
 tinians, could not carry oft
 the  bloody  airport  attack
 themselves and so had to
 turn to a Japanese suicide
 squad. "Let them say what
 they like," retorted Zayix.
 "Arabs from the occupied
 territories  participated  in
 this operation, too. Besides,
 the three    Japanese_ were
 members of the' PFLP . .

 were not planning to kill

 The man who apparently

 as Ken  Torio,  23. His ac-
 complice                                                                              who  was  found
 dead is identified as Jori

 DInisuke, Nanba, 23, was cap-
 tured. Japanese police said
 there was doubt that the
 names were real and that
 their  passports  were  for-
 geries.
 'layix's allusion to Irish
 members of the PFLP cur-
 roborated                                                                              a recent state-

 raid by the three Japanese
 was a direct response to Is-

 a guerrilla attempt to free

 jacking a Belgian jetliner
 three weeks ago.
 The guerrillas were infur-

 the  Israelis  have paraded
 their  "invincibility"  since
 then,  Zayix  said.
 Asked if the 11111,11 had
 any moral misgivings about
 the Japanese assault, Zayix
 replied:
 "None at all."
 He. said that the three ter-

 Tel Aviv, but on those dis

 "We were sure that 90 to
 95 per cent of the people in
 the airport at the time the
 operation was due to take
 place would be Israelis or
 people of direct loyalty to
 Israel," he said.
 "Our purpose was to kill
 as many people as possible
 at the airport, Israelis, of

 was there.

 BONN,  June  1 -The  state

 FOREIGN ELEMENTS IN PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE
 The Kamikazi attack on Israel's Lydda Airport last Week, and the subsequent
 declaration by the Popular Front for the Liberation Af_Palestine (PFLP) claiming res-
 ponsibility for that attack, have raised a big question mark over the presence of fo-
 reign elements in the Palestinian resistance  movement. Many journalists and news-
 paper correspondents were making strenuous efforts to find out how many and ho)v
 influential these foreign elements were. To their disappointment, they could find little
 or nothing at all to satisfy their curiosity.
 After the Lydda Airport incident, in which 26 were killed and more than 80 wound-
 ed, wild speculations spread throughout the international press about the presence of
 Japanese suicide squads in the Palestinian resistance movement. Some press reports
 put the figure at 400 men and women who had allegedly joined the PFLP in Lebanon.
 It later became clear that the entire Japanese community in Lebanon was less than
 400.
 The PFLP, approached by a number of foreign journalists, would not reveal any
 information for obvious security and strategic reasons. However, on several occasions
 in the past, the Palestiinian resistance movement did publish pictures of non-Palestin-
 ian men and women wh6 were'said to be helping the movement in various ways: In the
 first place,the movement madenodenial of the fact that Arab nationals from various Ar-
 ab countries have joined the movement as fighters, medical officers, social workers

 foreigners even though there have been reports about its cooperation with extremist
 groups in foreign countries such as the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Turkish
 Liberation Army, the Black Panthers in the United States, the Topamaros in Chile
 and the United Red Army in Japan.
 Although the PFLP has never confirmed officially that it had any links with these
 organizations, it is part of PFLP strategy to establish and deepen relations with the
 world revolutionary and anti-imperialist forces wherever they may be. The organization
 believes that "revolutionary violence at this stage is the only way to maintain the exist-
 ence of the Palestinian commando action and, consequently, the Palestine case."
 As PFLP leader Dr. George Habash declared in last March's congress of the
 organization, revolutionary violene means more than planting an explosive on a road, or
 blowing up a bridge or shelling an Israeli settlement 300 times without causing any
 real harm to it. Habash strongly emphasized the role of revolutionary violence at this
 stage for the strategic interests of the Palestinian revolution.
 The congress last March clearly defined the principles of revolutionary violence:
 1- Avoiding large-scale military confrontations; 2- adopting the policy of hit-and-run
 whereby-surprise and swift strikes are made after which the organization's men would
 go into complete hiding; 3- choosing enemy targets which, when destroyed, would get
 the widest popular support among.the masses and, at the same time, would evoke no
 conflicting arguments about the legitimacy or the soundness of such operations; 4-
 adopting the most adequate security measures to protect the revolution and its men,
 cadres and leaderships against sabotage, repression and intelligence aimed at dest-
 roying the revolution; 5- raising the political, psychological and fighting qualifica-
 tions of the fighters; 6- making a profound and comprehensive acquaintence with all
 the principles and tactics of guerrilla warfare and learning from the experiences of
 other sh:,utrt; ling peoples.
 The PFLP is perhaps the only Palestinian commando organization with the widest
 international connections. Being an extremist Marxist organization it is believed to
 have set up links and ties with similar organizations in various other countries.
 The leader of PFLP, Dr. George Habash, has paid more than one visit to Far
 Eastern communist countries such as China and North Korea, and was last week re-
 ported to have started a visit to the Soviet Union (ostensibly for medical treatment).
 Since the 1967 .war in the Middle East, reports have been circulating all around saying
 that Communist Chinese arms and experts were being supplied to the PFLP as well
 as to its associate guerrilla group fighting the regime in the Sultanate of Oman'. The
 number of such experts has never been ascertained. But it is almost a confirmed fact
 that some Palestinian guerrillas, including PFLP men, have had military training in
 China and North Vietnam.
 As an atmosphere of fear, tension and anticipation prevailed in the Middle East
 and several world capitals last week, following the Lydda Airport incident, there
 were some speculations which said that the PFLP was studying plans to pay back the
 "debt"to the Japanese Red Army. How this was to be done was not in any, way clear.
 But, the speculations said, the PFLP, might carry out some suicidal action against
 the Japanese authorities on two counts; 1- If they continue harassing the families and
 relatives of Japanese nationals in the employ of the Palestinian commando movement;
 2- if they go ahead to pay compensation to Israel for the human and material losses
 inflicted as a result of ,the Kamikazi attack on Tel Aviv Airport last week, or even if
 they supplied the Tsra,elis with information considered to be deterimental to the Pa-
 lestinian resistance movement.
 First Contact. According to a report in Beirut's wide-circulation weekly AL
 USBU AL ARABI this week, the first contact between the PFLP and the Japanese Un-

 The ground on which this contact was made, according to the report, was purely
 ideological. It was obvious to both sides, said the report, that the "essence" of their
 struggle against the forces of imperialism, reaction and exploitation was-the same.
 The two sides also agreedion a definition of "the genuine forces of the international
 rev- olution."
 These forces included; "the socialist camp, the labor forces and toiling masses
 in the capitalist countries,' and the national. liberation movements."
 .Last autumn, the weekly said, a PFLP leader visited Japan and the Red Army
 "welcomed him by blowing up five police stations in Tokyo." The weekly defined the
 Red Army as being "an underground extremist organization that commenced its activi-
 ties on the political and military levels in 1965." It believes in the armed struggle
 as "the fundamental way of liberating peoples from exploitation and class domination
 domestically, and a means to combat imperialism on the international level."
 AL USBU reported that Dr, Habash had called on the Red Army to participate
 "practically" in the Palestinian struggle in order to materialize the strong relation-
 ship between the two sides. It added that a number of Red Army members have since
 joined the PFLP and received training in PFLP camps in the Jordanian Ghnr fva1lovl
 The Red Army has also helped the Palestinian resistance movement, through its
 relations with the PFLP, to establish some presence in Japan, mainly in the field of
 information. A few months ago, according to AL USBU, adocumentary film was shown
 in Japan and some Arab countries projecting cooperation between the PFLP and the Red
 Army. Within the framework of this cooperation, said the weekly, several Japanese
 nationals lived with the Palestinian refugees in the camps and helped in medical and
 social work.
 The weekly quoted a PFLP spokesman as saying after the Lydda Airport incident
 that the operation there was "the beginning of a new phase in military operations ag-
 ainst the Israeli enemy. The purpose of these operations is to get the resistance move-
 ment rout of its present stagnation. We did not start this operation in order to' stop af-
 ter completing it. On the contrary, we will continue the struggle in accordance with
 a new plan dictated by the requirements of the situation."
 In fact, security men in various countries were busy last week trying' to foil an-
 other Kamikazi operation which was allegedly being planned by a Japanese who had
 been involved in the Lydda Airport operation, in which two Japanese were killed and
 a third captured by Israeli authorities.
 Security precautions were increased on the Israeli embassy in-Tokyo and on Jap-
 anese officials after reports circulated 'saying that the fourth man was planning to
 carry out another Kamikazi operation. Kazo Okamoto, who was captured by the Israelis,
 had reportedly told his interrogators that more commando operations would be launched
 until the 10th of June. Japanese authorities declared last week that they were checking
 their files of some seven million persons to find fingerprints that match those of the
 lone Japanese. surviver, Okamoto (24).
 In the meantime, the authorities said they were trying to learn the identity of the
 mysterious woman who is believed to be the fourth person involved in the Lydda opera-
 tion. She was to have- acted aI :s liaison for the Arab commandos and to have contacted
 the three Japanese activistsdn Rome where she allegedly gave them their passports
 and weapons before they flew' to Tel Aviv.
 Three Women. At least three Japanese women were reported to be with the PFLP.
 They are Fusako Shigenobu (26), Mariko Nakanu (29) and Dr. Takako Nobuhara (31).
 They are said to be in Lebanon.

 Press reports said Dr. Nobuhara became acquainted with Miss Shigenobu, the one-

 a front-page story claiming that a German "terrorist extremist", wanted, and later
 arrested, by the West German authorities had been in Lebanon early this year when
 he held contacts with Palestinian commandos (specific organization not identified) and
 offered them his services' in carrying 'out terrorist operations against Israel and Is-

 The man was identified as 29-year-old Andreas Baadar, allegedly the head of a

 leading Lebanese authorities. He held several meetings with Palestinian commando
 leaders, but no agreement was reached. AL NAHAR said that some of his offers were
 "very attractive", but the commando leaders found loopholes in them. They also feared
 the consequences of letting Baadar into their plans and operations.
 The German authorities, according to the paper, had put up an award of 420,000
 Lebanese pounds for the arrest of Baadar, who had carried out a series of terrorist
 operations in Germany since 1968, and was, therefore, considered as "an extremely
 dangerous outlaw."
 After what has been described as the "biggest jean-hunt in Germany since the
 Second World War, " Baadar was arrested and is now awaiting his trial. His colleague

 TTig ECONOMIST JULY 8,  t972
 Palestine
 Bond Street gang?
 Britain's part in co-sponsoring  last
 week's Security Council resolution-
 which " condemned " the recent Israeli
 raids into Lebanon, while only " deplor-
 ing " the guerrilla attacks that led to
 them-has detonated an Israeli reac-
 tion.      The  Israeli  government  was
 angered by the resolution, particularly
 by the clause which called for it, albeit
 in convoluted phrasing, to return the
 Syrian officers captured during the pre-
 vious week. Hence, one must. assume,
 Israel's decision to embarrass the British
 Government by challenging Britain's
 supposed decision to allow the guer-
 rillas' Palestine Liberation Organisation
 to set up an office in London--although
 the Israelis had already been informed
 that under British law and tradition
 neither decision nor permission was
 involved.
 The Government has indeed been
 embarrassed, with members of parlia-
 ment on both sides protesting at the
 thought of a terrorist nest in the centre
 of London. In Parliament on Monday
 Mr Joseph Godber, Minister of State
 at the Foreign Office, reiterated what
 Sir Alec Douglas-Home had replied to
 Mr Abba Eban last week : there are
 no  means  of  preventing  anyone
 establishing such an office so long as
 it operates within the framework of
 British law. This means that a FLU
 office, like the other offices in Britain
 which are or have been attached to a
 wide variety of political movements,
 can provide information or lobby any-
 is amm"R
 but cannot operate as a guerrilla base
 for planning terrorism or training
 terrorists.
 The  dCt3.,rtinn  ran  he a fine one
 and  there  is  no  doubt  that  the
 activities  of  a PLO  office,  when
 established, will be closely scrutinised.
 So too, as Mr Godber assured Mr
 Callaghan, the shadow Home Secre-
 tary, will its personnel. The most likely
 head of the new office will be Mr
 Said Hammami, a PLO representative
 who has been in London for about a
 year attached to the Arab League
 information office. With his own office
 and stall', Mr llaniniami's job will be
 extended but will remain, he insists,
 for information only. .
 A PLO office has existed more or
 less quietly in New York since 1965.
 The quiet was broken last year when
 the office was raided, and its chief
 beaten up, by militant Jews. There is
 also an office in Geneva but in most
 European capitals information about
 the Palestinians and their cause is
 disseminated, if at all, by the Arab
 League and its PLO representatives.
 It may be these who were meant by
 the resolution passed last week by the
 political committee of the Council of
 Europe, which called on the council's
 17 members (who include Switzerland
 and  Britain)  to  close  w ra
 their PLO offices.
 Israel's desire to prevent the propa-
 gation of more efficient information
 about the Palestine guerrilla rnove-
 ment(as pi-ec.,.,t crantyr 2nd rvrn ernre
 confused than the movement itself) is
 understandable,  although  it  comes
 rather curiously from Mr Menahem
 Regin,  the  leader  of   the  Jewish
 guerrilla  organisation which  fought
 both Arabs and Britons in the last years
 of the British mandate. The past being
 the past, Mr Begin was correctly given
 a visa for his recent visit to London.
 The Palestine guerrillas being very
 much part of the present, it is question-
 able whether their leader, Mr Yasser
 Arafat, should receive similar hospi-
 tality if, as rumoured, he applies for
 a visa to open the London office. As
 chairman of the PLO's executive com-
 mittee, Mr Arafat is, in theory at least,
 ultimately responsible for all acts of
 violence by the guerrilla groups which
 belong to the organisation.
 But it is improbable that Mr Arafat
 will make the attempt. The informa-
 tion office can do its work as well, and
 in fact a good deal better, without the
 hullabaloo of a controversial opening.
 And Palestinians in London, pointing
 o the rock-bottom state of the for-
 to'
 tunes of the guerrilla movement, say
 starkly that Mr Arafat has, or should
 have, a great many more important
 things to do than ceremonial openings.

 last weekend's sabotage at the Trieste p11,
 pipeline terminal in Italy has reactivated the
 debate about uses of Arab oil as a political
 weapon against the United States and Israel.
 Palestinian guerrillas of the "Black Sep-
 tember" group claimed the burning inferno
 of African and Mideast crude oil bound for
 Italy, Austria, and West Germany as part of
 its "revolutionary policy" of attacking the
 interests of Israel's frieHd? and allies.
 There was visible concern among Arab as
 well as Western governments and oil circles.
 The highly professional sabotage of the
 Trieste terminal of the 300-mile-long Trans-
 alpine pipeline hit one of West Europe's main
 oiI-supply arteries, completed'just before the
 Arab-Israeli war of 1067.
 The pipeline was owned by a group of some
 of the largest firms that are customers for
 Arab oil, including Esso, Shell, Mobil 011,
 Relief for Rotterdam
 The pipeline was built to relieve the heavy
 load on t.hc other main West European tanker

 Oil sources here say most of the crude-oil
 supplies pumped through the pipe come from

 Nigeria, Algeria, and Libya, with which
 Egypt Aug. 2 announced its intention to form
 a total union by September, 1973. Some of the
 crude oil also came from the Persian Gulf

 Such sabotage acts, Egyptian officials say,

 King Faisal was quoted as saying there is

 Participation urged
 The Saudi Government urged Western oil
 firms to fulfill Arab demands for participa-
 tion (part ownership),by producer-govern-
 ments to the companies.
 It said a positive response in the participa.
 tion talks, being conducted on behalf of the
 Persian Gulf-area members of OPEC (the
 Organization of Petroleum Exporting Coung
 tries) was desirable if the companies wished
 "not to forfeit their key position in the oil
 industry as a consequence of their position at
 the production stage."
 Oil experts interpreted this as a hint of,
 possible government take-overs of produc?.
 tion operations, as have already occurred in
 Iraq, Algeria, and Libya, If the participation
 talks finally break down.
 Iran, one of the world's and OPEC's biggest
 producers, has, however, indicated it would
 not follow the Arab policy. It has been
 negotiating new accords with the Western oil
 consortium without regard to the participa-
 tion issue.

 There are signs that the Israeli intelligence service is-getting worried about the score-
 card of the most recent 'of the Palestine guerrilla movements -'the Black September
 organisation, which has claimed responsibility for the Triest oil terminal sabotage of
 4 August.
 The first significant exploit of the Black September terrorists was the assassination of
 the Jordanian prime minister, Wasfi Tal, in Cairo in*November, 1971. The following
 month they ,attempted to assassinate the Jordanian ambassador' to London. On
 February the group says it blew up a natural gas plant,in Ravenstein, Holland; and
 on the same day shot and killed five Jordanians in Bruehl, near Cologne. On 8 February,
 again according to its own claims, the,13lack September movcmcnt detonated explosions
 at business premises near Hamburg, and on 22 February it sabotaged oil pipelines.
 All these targets allegedly had had some links'with the Israelis. In May the organisa-
 tion unsuccessfully attempted to hijack 'a Sabena airliner at Lydda airport; of the four
 hijackers, two were killed by the Israelis.
 Previously believed to be operating without central direction, the Black September
 organisation is. now reliably reported to be under the control of Fatah, the principal
 Palestinian guerrilla movement. All Black September, information is 'printed. and
 distributed by the Fatah office in Beirut, and access to the movement can be obtained
 only through Fatah channels.
 The. question of the role of. the guerrilla movements is known to have been on the
 agenda of tiic recent talks in Benghazi, between Presidents Sadat of Egypt and Q,addafi
 of Libya-Egypt has been financing Fatah in recent years to a greater degree than is
 popularly supposed; and for some time Egyptian direction of its activities has been
 substantial. From now on there will be Libyan money to back the Cairo control.
 This means that the threat from the Black September movement will increase; it will
 probably - though this is arguable - be under more effective central control, and wil l
 undoubtedly have an increased, supply of funds.
 At the moment, the other guerrilla movements, the Popular Front for the Liberation
 of Palestine (PFLP), the Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine
 (PDFLP) and,the Popular Revolutionary Front'for the Liberation of Palestine (PRFLP)
 are keeping their heads down. It is now virtually certain that the assassination of Ghhaassaiss
 Kanafani, the spokesman for the "PFLP, on 8 July in Beirut, was the "Work of-Israeli
 intelligence agents - in retaliation for the Lydda airport massacre of 30 May. Since
 then the leaders of these three Palestinian movements have gone underground, until
 the Israeli threat of direct reprisal has eased. Saiqa, the Syrian-based guerrilla move-
 ment, has now virtually lost its quasi-official Syrian protection, which is in 'keeping
 with the relatively moderate new policy *of President Assad. The 'probability is that
 Saiqa will soon come under more direct Fatah control.
 But it is not only the Israelis who are watching these developments, or probable
 developments, with anxious interest. King Hussein of Jordan' and King Faisal of
 Saudi Arabia are disturbed by the increased control that Egypt and Libya exert over
 the most radical and fanatical of the guerrilla movements.

 Nihilism-Turkish Style
 By C. L. SULZBERGER
 ISTANBUL, Turkey-Turkey's urban
 guerrillas seem to have philosophical
 tits , with nineteenth-century Russian
 nihilism. Their goal is purely destruc
 tive--to bring down the lumbering
 Turkish social structure.
 The principal laboratory where they
 learn violent techniques is the Middle'
 East. Terrorists from the three extrem-
 ist branches-Turkish People's Libera-
 tion Army (T.P.L.A.), Turkish People's
 Liberation Front (T.P.L.F.), and Turkish
 People's Liberation Party (T.P.L.P.)-
 have known connections with two far-
 out -Arab guerrilla groups based In
 Lebanon and Syria.
 These are the People's Front for the
 Liberation of Palestine (P.F.L.P.), a-
 small but disciplined outfit which has
 specialized in hijacking international
 airlihers, and its breakaway faction,'
 the 'People's Democratic Front for the
 Liberation  of Palestine  (P.D.F.L.P.),
 which claims to be more Maoist than
 Mao.
 if all this sounds like some weird
 word game, one should not forget that
 the anagrams are written In blood, and,
 although the Turkish guerrillas prob-
 ably number less than a hundred ac-
 tivists with only three or four hundred
 active sympathizers and a few thou-
 sand passive supporters, they managed
 to throw a deep scare into this country.
 The reasons are manifold. To start
 with, the Turks are tough and Turkish
 nihilists have done some unusually
 nasty things: kidnapping American sol-.
 diers, British and Canadian radar tech-
 niQians; murdering an Israeli consul
 general; burning one of Istanbul's most
 splendid edifices; sinking two ships,
 and so forth.

 The apparent  ea, ps ar as can
 -Tftmmdd, is to bling dawn the Gavefft-
 ment, prompt an open military take-
 ovdr and thereby cause a public reac-
 .tion sympathetic to the guerrillas. All
 that is an opium-dreamer's Turkish de-
 light and opium farming Is now banned.
 ?Ih the late nineteen-sixties revolu
 Nnlia    literature was allowed to an-
 pear for the first time and discontented
 students found it possible to study-in'
 Turkish-such textbooks n violence as
 Carlos Marighella's treatise on the ur
 ban guerrilla. Leftist university schol-
 ars both here and In the large Turkish
 colony of workers in West Germany
 literally accepted the technical possi-
 bilities thus offered and also, inci-
 dentally, were encouraged by Bizim
 Radyo, a Turkish language broadcast-
 ing station in East Germany.
 A nucleus of professional terrorists
 was trained here and In Lebanon and
 Syria, and equipped with arms smug-
 gled from the Palestine guerrillas all
 across the Bulgarian border. Last month
 fourteen Turkish revolutionaries were
 caught on the Syrian frontier. When
 ,i
 they were expelled from that country
 Ankara was tactfully notified.
 There has been an effort to link the
 tiny urban guerrilla movement with the
 large and restless Kurdish minority in
 southern and eastern Turkey and com-
 mittees of so-called Maoist or New Left
 'Turkish agitators have also been es-..
 tablished in West German cities.  '
 Nevertheless, although Turkish stu
 dents and many professors have been:
 actively discontented for years, and al-'
 though there is growing frustration at'

 the support of junior military officers
 (mainly reserve and mostly in the air
 force) was smashed.
 The present unrest originated with a
 leftist body established among students'
 less than a decade ago and called
 devgene, or -revolutionary youth."
 Prior to last year's Intervention by the
 armed forces and establishment of mar-
 tial law, a reign of terror had begun to!
 creep through Turkish- cities. Some
 prosperous men even sent their families
 abroad.
 But public confidence now seems to
 have been restored and -the security
 forces believe the small but vigorous
 terrorist organizations have been de-
 capitated. Moreover, police analysis'
 has disclosed that the urban guerrillas'
 here have less extensive connections
 abroad than had sometimes been ru
 mored; that, for example, there is no
 reason to link them with the Uruguayan
 Tupamaros or the I.R.A.
 The explosions that have been rock-
 Ing Turkey seem to have been limited
 but the factors within the Turkish social
 structure that ignited these explosions
 have yet to be improved. The country
 has by no means advanced enough
 economically, educationally, or politi
 ,tally in the half-century since Ataturk's
 revolution assumed full control.
 In addition to'a generation gap so
 immense that it preventsr even the sem-
 blance of a dialogue between old and
 young, there is still, a cultural gap
 which prevents even the pretense of
 consensus on any major national issue.
 Until this is bridged, nihilism of one or
 .another sort will remain endemic.

 Attack at Olympics
 Guerrillas, in Cairo, Take
 Responsibility for Attack
 CAIRO, Sept. 5 (Reuters)
 An Arab guerrilla organization
 called Black September claimed
 responsibility  today  for  the
 attack on Israeli athletes' quar-
 ters at the Olympic Village in
 Munich.'
 The group, in a statement
 handed to foreign journalists,
 demanded the release of Arab
 guerrillas held by Israel and
 threatened to "liquidate" the
 Israelis held hostage in Munich
 if West Germans tried to storm
 their position in the Olympic
 quarters.
 The organization's statement,
 on four mimeographed pages
 headed "Communique of the
 Operation in Munich," was dis.
 tributed to news agency offices.
 The statement said that "our
 revolutionary forces" were "tak-
 ing over, right now, the Israeli
 house at the Olympic Village in
 Munich." It said, "All members
 of the Israeli delegation in the
 house are under armed arrest."
 List of Demands
 About six words were cut
 out of the paper at the begin-
 Ing of the next sentence, which
 read. "We demand of the Israeli
 military authorities In occupied
 Palestine  to  comply  strictly
 with the following "
 .
 A list of demands was then
 given, calling for the release of
 Arab guerrillas held in Israel.
 The statement also warned
 against what it called "tricky
 maneuvers or delaying tactics
 of any sort." If the Israeli au
 thorities used any, they "will
 pay then for their arrogance
 and their disregard for human
 rights and lives, as well," the
 statement added.
 The second part of the state-
 ment termed Israel "an Ameri-
 scan client state" and said she
 posed a permanent threat to
 the people of the Middle East.
 Method of Release Specified
 CAIRO,  Sept.  5  (Agence

 rilla organization said that the

 NEOCOLONIALISM ARRIVES IN LATIN AMERICA
 "Cuba will always be true to the revolutionary movement.  We
 put loyalty to the Soviet Union above everything else."*
 With these words, enunciated in Moscow on 4 July of this year,
 Fidel Castro Ruz became the first Latin American leader to pledge
 allegiance to a_European power since Bolivar and San Martin cast off
 Old World rule.  Ironically, Castro owes his rise to power to
 the strong spirit of independence of his fellow countrymep.. But,.
 after 1:3 years of revolution increasingly patterned on the Soviet
 model, Castro had so thoroughly shattered Cuba's economy, its
 political viability and the morale of the people that he saw as
 his only recourse to turn over to Moscow complete responsibility
 for Cuba's political and economic future.
 The final, formal act in the Sovietization of Cuba came at the
 26th session of Comecon, an economic grouping of primarily East
 European states that make up the Soviet dominated Warsaw Pact
 Bloc, held in Moscow from 10 to 12 July.  At this meeting, Cuba,
 which had been content to attend past sessions as an observer,
 ostensibly "requested" and, by Soviet diktat, was "unanimously"
 granted full membership in the group.
 As a member of Comecon, Cuba has "voluntarily" placed itself
 in the "Socialist Commonwealth", subject to the Brezhnev Doctrine
 which limits the sovereignty of states and provides the ideological
 rationale for Kremlin interference in the internal political
 affairs of member states.  Soviet media coverage of the event noted
 that Cuba was the "first country in Latin America to take part in
 socialist integration,"  A Pravda editorial said proudly that
 "states of three continents are now members of Comecon."
 Comecon, also known as the Council for Mutual Economic Assis-
 tance (CMEA), is made up of Bulgaria, East Germany, Czechoslovakia,
 Romania, Poland, Hungary and Mongolia, which lies on the Asian
 border of the USSR, as well as the Soviet Union and now, Cuba.
 Yugoslavia attends Comecon meetings as an observer; however, since
 Tito managed to free Yugoslavia from the manacles of "Soviet state
 capitalism" in 1948, he has been careful to keep the extent of his

 economic dealings with Comecon well below the level considered
 dangerous to Yugoslavia's autonomy.
 The reduction of Cuba to the status of a Soviet colony began
 in earnest in early 1968, when Castro, faced with the realities of
 mounting economic and morale problems caused by his erratic and
 irresponsible leadership, agreed to terms for massive Soviet
 economic and technical support in exchange for his open espousal
 of Moscow's ideological supremacy and an increase in his support
 for Kremlin foreign policies.  As a result, Castro, once considered
 an independent revolutionary and for several years a major pro-
 ponent of "separate - national - roads to socialism," shocked the
 more liberal elements of the socialist world by endorsing the
 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968.
 Four years of carefully doled Soviet aid only managed to keep
 the Cuban economy on a bare subsistence level while it drove Castro
 into deeper economic dependence on Moscow and increased his political
 bondage to the Kremlin.  By early this year the total Cuban debt
 to the USSR had risen to over 4 billion dollars and according to
 unofficial but reliable estimates this figure of indebtedness
 has been increasing at the rate of nearly 2 million dollars per day.
 When it became clear that the key sugar harvest for this year
 would barely top 4 million tons, making it one of the poorest
 harvests in recent Cuban history and disastrously below the 10
 million tons which Castro had staked "the honor of the revolution"
 on attaining by 1970, both Havana and Moscow became alarmed.  The
 Soviet solution, which Castro could resist only by admitting his
 failure to the Cuban people and giving up his position of power,
 called for placing the Cuban economy completely in the hands of
 Soviet planners and managers for the foreseeable future.  Bringing
 Cuba into Comecon would not only provide a thin ideological face-
 saving veneer for Castro when the full extent of Moscow's role in
 Cuba became evident, but it would also provide the basis for the
 Kremlin's having its East European "partners" share in the ever-
 rising costs of maintaining Cuba while the Soviets continued to
 reap all of the political benefits.
 To lay the groundwork for Cuba's entry into Comecon, Castro
 made an extensive "good-will" tour of the six East Europe Comecon
 member states and the Soviet Union itself.  The eight-week journey,
 lasting from 17 May until 6 July, marked the first time Castro had
 visited this area since 1964.  Included in the tour were as many
 public appearances and meetings with national leaders as could be
 squeezed into the schedule.  Short speeches, press conferences,
 interviews and communiques were everyday occurrences.  The themes
 highlighted by Castro throughout were unrestrained praise for
 Soviet policies and a call for greater solidarity of the socialist
 community under Moscow's 'magnanimous" leadership.

 The trip came at a time when Soviet pressures for greater
 integration and consolidation of its hold over Eastern Europe
 were intensifying while nationalist-minded East European leaders
 were seeking a variety of unobtrusive means for loosening
 Moscow's reins.  Such timing led many in East Europe, where
 experience has taught the people to be wary of the Kremlin, to
 conclude that the trip was conceived and directed in its entirety
 by Moscow.  Castro, nevertheless, played the role of the innocent
 and grateful Third World beneficiary of Soviet munificence, much
 to the chagrin and dismay of his hosts, especially in Romania,
 Hungary and Poland.
 In Czechoslovakia, where trials of the patriots and
 intellectuals involved in the "Prague Spring" were in progress,
 Castro "proudly" accepted an award for "the position taken by the
 Cuban Communist Party in connection with the international assist-
 ance of the Warsaw Pact countries in 1968."  Quite appropriately
 the award was presented by the Soviet-installed leader of Czecho-
 slovakia, Gustav Husak, who remarked, "Your position was a great
 help then and still is today."  In accepting the award Castro
 responded, "The position we took on the events in Czechoslovakia
 in 1968-69 is perfectly normal, because we are allergic to any
 manifestation of liberalism or deviationism._.
 Shortly after his return to Cuba, and just two weeks after
 Cuba's entry into Comecon, Castro delivered his traditional
 speech to the Cuban people on the anniversary of the 26th of July
 movement.  He assured them that the trip was a great success and
 that Cuba would only benefit from its new status in Comecon.  He
 obviously assumed that the Cuban people knew little about the
 realities of Comecon and the true status of the subjugated East
 European states that make up this body.  Ironically, he used much
 of his speech to lecture other Latin American countries and their
 leaders on the meaning of "true sovereignty," "real freedom,11 I 'in-
 dependence" and "national self-respect."  In marked contrast, these
 are the very subjects he feared to mention in the dozens of public
 utterances he made throughout Eastern Europe, where they are as
 cherished by the peoples of these captive nations as they are by
 the free Latin Americans.
 The Cuban people should be aware of what East Europeans really
 feel about Comecon.  While the press in Albania failed to mention
 Cuba's admission to Comecon, it did report the following on 17
 July:
 "CAA (Comecon) held its 26th session in Moscow last
 week.  While the Soviet leaders continue to publicize
 its benefits and prospects for the future to member
 states, such propaganda cannot obscure the bitter
 reality concealed behind the activity of this bloc,
 As time goes on it becomes ever clearer that CMEA

 and its many organs are only instruments used by
 Moscow to plunder the other members of this neo-
 colonialist-type entity in the most highly organized
 manner possible."
 What is the significance for the other Latin American countries
 of Cuba's new status as a full-fledged vassal of Soviet neo-
 colonialism?                          How can the other Latins deal with Castro's pledge
 to "put loyalty to the Soviet Union above everything else?"
 Cuban policies in Latin America, which, since 1968, had been
 gradually changing to conform with Soviet policies in this area,
 would now be planned, coordinated and financed in Moscow.  Many
 observers have noted a superficial easing of Cuban policies since
 1968; a shift from outright Cuban support for the most radical and
 violent left-wing revolutionary movements to what appears to be
 a more moderate stance involving open Cuban support of responsible
 revolutionary leaders.  Such a view can be not only misleading but
 extremely dangerous for Latin America in the future, for Havana
 will now be manipulated in the much more subtle and sophisticated
 ways characteristic of its Soviet master.  It must also be
 remembered that ,a goodly portion of Cuba's 4 billion dollar debt
 to the USSR represent's indirect Soviet funding of Latin American
 revolutionary movements.
 Old, experienced communists such as Yugoslavia's Tito and
 China's Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai, learned long ago that the wily
 Kremlin politicians, much like their Tsarist imperialist pre-
 decessors, are more interested in extending their own power, and
 the power of the Russian Empire, than they are in altruistically
 supporting revolutions designed to improve the lot of the masses.
 Soviet Latin American policy has been characterized for a number
 of years by what appears on the surface to be a good deal of
 flexibility and moderation.  In reality, however, it has been
 marked by a cynical duality which combines diplomatic niceties
 and carefully doled foreign aid and open displays of friendship
 along with clandestine intrigue and subversion calculated in the
 long run to extend Soviet political influence throughout the area.

 Soviet hegemony over east^rn Europe.
 That is why even  those. Comecon
 integration projects under discussion in
 Moscow last week which can be justi-
 fir-l in terms of economic rationality
 have a sinister ring for the more inde-
 pendent-.minded east Europeans.
 The- main news from last week's
 meeting of this supposedly economic
 organisation was political. The entry
 of Cuba as a full member is dictated no
 doubt by Russia's desire to keep a
 closer watch on Dr Castro. There is also
 die near-entry into membership of
 Jugoslavia, which has recently found
 itself obliged-mainly through its lack
 of success in western markets-to enter
 into closer co-operation with Come-
 con. Politics, not economics, is still
 king in eastern Europe.          .
 Hanging over all Comecon members
 is the growing political problem of
 how to react to the' enlargement of
 the common market. Rumania has
 approached Brussels in the hope of
 being included in Europe's generalised
 preference scheme. Jugoslavia has a
 trade agreement ivith the common
 market,  which  is  currently  being
 re.-negotiated.  Poland  and  Ijungai
 would like to get larger quotas for their
 textile exports to the community but
 obviously cannot until Comecon has
 sorted out the recognition problem. But
 in a year when the Ten are jointly
 preparing their approach to the Euro-
 pean security conference, and when the
 Brussels commission is expected to take
 over the future common commercial
 policy of the Ten towards eaftern
 Europe, there is an increasing fear that
 Russia will use the issue of rec gni..
 tion of the EEC to bludgeon its Come-
 con partners further into line.

 THE VIETNAM WAR:  SWEDEN'S PROXY TARGET
 Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme used the occasion of the
 Socialist International Congress in Vienna (26-29 June) to return
 to one of his favorite themes:      American intervention in Vietnam.
 At a time when many of his fellow European socialists have acknow-
 ledged the fact of the massive North Vietnamese invasion of the
 South, Mr. Palme has persisted in characterizing the American
 presence as a continuation of French colonialism and asked the
 Socialist International Congress to take a stand against American
 "intervention."  The Prime Minister's moral indignation was boundless:
 "We are socialists; we are on the side of the poor, the downtrodden."
 The Palme government's latest propaganda offensive against
 the United States began on 17 May when Education Minister Carlsson
 joined a march on the U.S. Embassy sponsored by the Swedish Vietnam
 Committee.  Speaking to the demonstrators, Carlsson condemned the
 American role in Vietnam as "only one" instance of U.S. efforts
 to dominate other countries.  On 23 May Foreign Minister Wickman
 told the Swedish parliament that the North Vietnamese invasion of
 the South, was simply another example of cooperation between liberation
 movements, whereas U.S. intervention was directed against all the
 Vietnamese people.  And in mid-June Swedish Ambassador to North
 Vietnam Oeberg claimed that U.S. bombing of the North had severely
 damaged dikes and dams and could cause massive flooding during the
 rainy season.
 Since most Swedes are pre-occupied, at the moment, with more
 parochial. problems, such as unemployment, inflation and higher
 taxes, the government's sudden re-obsession with the fate of a
 Southeast Asian nation is difficult to understand.  Could it possibly
 relate to something more than the "humanitarian concern," Mr.
 Palme is so fond of emphasizing?
 In the 1970 elections, Palme's Social Democratic party lost
 its absolute majority in parliament, when many of its left-wing
 supporters turned to the communists.  The government is currently
 experiencing a severe mid-term slump-  Sweden has been slow to
 recover from last year's economic recession:  consumer prices rose
 approximately seven percent between May 1971 and May 1972;
 unemployment remains high.  Last winter Swedish housewives demon-
 strated against the soaring price of food and the government is
 worried that there may be new demonstrations.
 Unable as yet to resolve his domestic problems, and faced with
 new elections in 1973, Palme has turned with obvious relief to the

 Vietnam issue which is popular with the young and disaffected
 elements of his electorate.  His use of the Socialist International
 forum to placate the Swedish left was noted by other participants
 in the meeting.  Responding to the Swedish Prime Minister's remarks,
 German Chancellor Willy Brandt noted "anti-Americanism is often
 an excuse for our own failings."' The congress, for its part, did
 not condemn the U.S. role in Southeast Asia.  Palme subsequently
 admitted that the Swedish Social Democratic position on Vietnam
 is not always appreciated.
 TERRORISM AND THE SOVIET UNION
 In a series of two articles, The Soviet Involvement in
 Violence, appearing in the July 19   issues o the  ortnig tly
 owlet   alyst, Brian Crozier, Director of the London-based
 Institute  or the Study of Conflict, examines the extent of Soviet
 sponsorship of terrorism and guerrilla warfare on one hand while,
 on the other, it assiduously cultivates an image of detente and
 peaceful co-existence -- which image also provides cover for the
 continuing subversive activities of the KGB and GRU.  The documented
 evidence of Soviet-supplied materiel,`furids and train.ing'to
 revolutionaries in Western Europe, the Arab world and Near East,
 Africa and Latin America at the same time as the Soviets exhibit
 a popular front, constitutional non-revolutionary image, can serve
 as a take-off for careful examination of Soviet motivation.
 Attached are reprints of the articles from the Soviet Analyst.
 To facilitate exploitation of these articles in Latin America , an
 unofficial Spanish translation of them is also attached (for
 selected areas only).
 DISILLUSIONED WITH SOVIET OIL TECHNICIANS
 The Nigerian press reflects disillusionment with the recent
 Moscow/Lagos agreement which calls for Soviet technicians to
 assist in Nigerian oil production.  An article in the 19 July
 issue of Renaissance, an official daily newspaper of the Nigerian
 government, questions the wisdom of seeking Soviet oil technology
 experts when in fact the Soviets have no major oil discoveries to
 their credit despite more than 15 years of drilling in such countries
 as Egypt, Iran, Syria, Morocco and India.  "In oil technology as
 is generally known, the West is far ahead of the East.  It is not
 a question of ideology.  That-is why questions are bound to-be,asked
 whether the government in making its leap eastward, got the best
 possible advice."  The article also cites Jidda's Al Madina, which
 quotes Egypt's former Deputy Premier and oil minister     ud
 Younes as noting that "the reputation of the Soviet Union in matters

 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000200120001-1
 of oil technology is not very good."  Reference is also made to the
 World Oil Congress held in Moscow in June 1971 as a "dazzling show...
 (that)-may convince gullible unsophisticates that topflight
 Soviet oil technology, of which the Russians have a certain amount,
 is available for export under aid projects.  But the facts and
 past experience show that the USSR needs all its best help for
 itself, not for foreign countries.,"
 Arab countries are not the only ones being short-changed by
 Soviet technology.  In February 1971, India abandoned its off-shore
 explorations in the Gulf of Cambay because of inadequate Soviet
 equipment.  "India's heavy reliance on Soviet equipment and
 technical assistance for the past 15 years has slowed exploration
 for crude oil the country needs..,.  Soviet exploration techniques
 are at least ten years behind Western industry."  "Iussia's Drilling
 Hit by Equipment Problems," an article that appeared in the author-.
 itative monthly magazine World Petroleum, is also referred to:
 "Spare parts were lacking aria Te_ 1gn was recognized by the Soviets
 themselves to be obsolete, backward and inefficient."
 The concluding theme of the Renaissance article is that the
 Soviets' limited experience in computer technology will hamper
 progress in a rapidly modernizing oil industry.  As far back as
 1963 Western exploitation had benefited from digital seismic
 technology which by 1966 was being used in Libya.  It wasn't
 until 1969 that the first computerized digital seismic unit was
 available to the USSR.  The required accuracy for locating Libyan
 petroleum reserves, currently being attempted by Soviet technicians
 in Tripoli, "will inevitably be impaired by a shortfall in computer
 technique.  It is the same story in Iraq as in Egypt and elsewhere
 of ineffective Soviet oil 'help' often extended for political motives."
 Another setback in the Soviets' drive to expand their influence
 in Africa is reported in the 20 July 1972 edition of the oil trade
 journal Platts Oilgram.  In mid-July, the Libyan government denied
 entrance to a .large delegation of Soviet oil experts on "technical
 grounds."  The article indicates that the Libyan government may
 be reconsidering the agreements signed by Premier Jallud in Moscow
 in early 1972 for Soviet assistance in oil production.  The
 Libyans, as the Nigerians, are probably aware of limited Soviet
 expertise in petroleum technology,  It is noteworthy that Iraq,
 Moscow's most loyal friend in the Middle East, turned to France
 to market, oil and continues to seek European help in oil pro-
 duction,  Some sources indicate that Libya's refusal to accept
 Soviet technicians is partially based on an Egyptian report that
 intelligence officers were among the "technicians."  Through
 this often used guise, the Kremlin hoped to offset recent Libyan
 demands for the reduction of personnel at the Soviet Embassy in
 'Tripoli,

 IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED
 Moscow is busy corralling its front organizations for a
 series of youth meetings where European security will be the
 major topic.
 The Soviets seem undaunted by the spectacular failure of the
 Assembly for Peace and Security in Europe (ARPO) which met in
 Brussels in early June,  That conference was the first of a
 series of international non-governmental gatherings aimed at
 keeping up pressures on West European governments to accept the
 Soviet precepts of European Security.  Despite the meager results
 of ARPO, the Soviets are still touting these youth gatherings,
 claiming ARPO gave youth in particular an opportunity to participate
 in peace deliberations.  The first such gathering is the European
 Youth Security Conference in Helsinki (August 26-30), supported by
 the World Federation of Democratic Youth.
 Moscow claims that more than 100 youth festivals, conferences
 and meetings will take place this year, some of which are in
 preparation for the Tenth World Youth Festival, scheduled for late
 July 1973 in East Berlin.  The Festival's Preparatory Meeting will
 be in East Berlin in October; Moscow has already announced that
 its traveling saleswoman-astronaut, Valentina Nikolayevna-
 Tereshkova, will be among the Soviet members in attendance.  A
 "World Meeting of Working Youth" will fallow in Moscow in November;
 its theme will be "youth condemns imperialism."
 It is doubtful that these meetings will achieve the desired
 propaganda impact but it is obvious that the Soviets are willing
 to take the gamble and are expending considerable time and
 money in cultivating youth groups from abroad.
 On 7 August the Soviet government newspaper I_~zvestiy voiced
 loud complaint over a new Chinese atlas, accusing Peking of re-
 heating the Sino-Soviet border controversy.  The new Chinese book
 called The Peace Atlas claims more than 900,000 square miles of
 Soviet-influenced territory for China which Moscow says is an
 "absurd demand."  Izvestiya described the new Chinese atlas as
 aimed at "fanning hostility between the Soviet and Chinese peoples,
 educating the population of China in the spirit of hatred for
 other peoples... particularly neighboring peoples-in the spirit
 of revising the borders of China with adjacent countries."  Izvestiya
 goes on to say that China, with which the Soviet Union shares a
 4,300 mile border, claims in its new atlas Mongolia, most of the
 Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan, and parts of the Republics of

 JAPAN OBJECTS TO SOVIET TERRITORIAL CLAIMS
 Soviet pique over "Mao's Geography" ties in well with the
 matter of Japan's Northern Territories which the Soviet Union
 usurped during the closing days of World War II...the main
 difference in the cases being that the Pacific islands under dis-
 pute are by tradition Japanese, while the Soviet territories claimed
 by Mao's atlas are not by tradition Chinese.
 Japanese Foreign Minister Ohira and the Soviet ambassador to
 Japan, Oleg Troyanovsky, are about to begin preliminary discussions
 designed to lead eventually to the conclusion of a Soviet-Japanese
 peace treaty.  Soviet refusal to comply with Japanese insistence
 on the return of the Northern Territories continues to be the
 major irritant in existing Japanese-Soviet tensions.  Most recently,
 this was attested to by Japan's strongly negative reaction to the
 latest hints (surfaced via Victor Louis) that the USSR "might be
 willing to rent or lease" to Japan the islands under dispute.
 The islands lie just off the northernmost Japanese island of
 Hokkaido and just south of the Kuril Island Chain, which was handed
 over to the Soviets under terms of the Yalta Agreement and has
 since been incorporated into the RSFSR.  The disputed islands,
 referred to as the Northern Territories are the islands of
 Shikotan, Etorofu, Kunashiri and the Habomai archipelago.  Shikotan
 and the Habomais are the islands to which Japan has the best claim
 as they are neither geographically nor geologically part of the
 Kuril Chain but like the Kurils have been under Japanese dominion
 since 1798.  Japan claims Etorofu and Kunashiri as the northern
 extension of Hokkaido; the Soviets claim them as the southernmost
 part of the Kurils and thus as covered under the Yalta Agreement.
 However, they too have been continuously under Japanese dominion
 since 1798 and have been traditional Japanese fishing grounds for
 centuries.
 Precedent for disputing the fallacy of the Soviet definition
 of the Northern Territories as part of the Kuril Chain dates
 back to the Nineteenth Century.  A treaty of amity of 1855
 established the Russo-Japanese border on a line running between
 Etorofu Island (Japanese) and Urrupu Island (Russian) thus recog-
 nizing the legality of a Japanese presence in the Northern
 Territories.  The Kuril-Sakhalin exchange of 1875 defined the Kuril
 Island Chain as starting at its southern tip with Urrupu and as
 not including the Northern Territories,.  No leader of Imperial
 Russia or the Soviet Union ever questioned this definition before.

 Obviously more important to the Soviet Union than historic
 precedent is what the USSR sees as the strategic value of the
 Northern Territories.  Together with the Soviet Union's ownership
 of the Kuril Chain, the Soviet presence in the Northern Territories
 practically guarantees the USSR control over access to the Sea of
 Okhotsk and plays a major role in Soviet antisubmarine activities.
 These activities are centered at the large military base that the
 Soviets have built on the northernmost island in the Northern
 Territories, Etorofu.  Maintaining this toehold may take on even
 added significance in Moscow's eyes as relations between Japan
 and China warm up.
 When it was pointed out to the Soviets last spring that the
 reversion of Okinawa from the U.S. to Japan should set a precedent
 for the reversion of the Northern Territories, another fallacious
 Soviet argument was heard as Ambassador Troyanovsky told the
 Japanese press:  "Keeping aside any historical or legal comment,
 I would like to call just one matter to everyone's attention.  One
 million Japanese live on Okinawa; but for 25 years only Russians
 have been living on the southern Kurils" (meaning the Northern
 Territories).  Undeniably so, but only because the Soviet occupying
 forces evicted some 16,000 Japanese from the Northern Territories
 while the Americans allowed the residents of Okinawa to stay in
 place.
 Fallacious arguments and precedents aside, as the preliminary
 peace discussions open this month, the determining factor may well
 be one of economics.  The Soviet Union, eager for Japanese aid
 in developing its resources in Siberia and the far eastern provinces,
 will undoubtedly use the Northern Territories issue to try to get
 liberal terms on potential future Japanese investments.  Prime
 Minister Tanaka, however, has already declared Tokyo's intention
 to take an all-or-nothing position on the return of the islands.
 In fact, the Japanese government will be willing to wait several
 years if need be in order to conclude a treaty on its own terms.

 The Soviet involvement in, oIIice
 by Brian Crozier Director, Institute for the Study of `Conflict, London
 'The proposition that the. Soviet Union is still
 involved  in  the sponsorship of revolutionary
 violence tends, nowadays, to be greeted with in-
 credulity. The new image of Russia, carefully
 cultivated over the past decade or more, is that
 of a super-Power impelled by traditional imperial
 drives, capable, it is true, of unfortunate lapses
 such as the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968,
 but not, after all, guilty of major outrages like
 Vietnam.. Of course, not all people accept this
 now image of reassuring normality, but many
 leader  writers,  television  commentators  and
 _politicians do accept it, as they accept other
 popular fallacies such as the notion that the Cold
 War Is  over, the "normality" of Communist
 parties (for example the Italian) or the reality of
 the detente now being offered by Mr. Brezhnev.
 The fact is, however, that the Russians'are in-
 volved in sponsoring terrorism or guerrilla war in
 many countries and in varying degrees. Where
 and to what degree it is the purpose of this article
 The lot of the analyst was enviably simpler in
 Stalin's day, and especially during the last eight
 years of his life from the end of the Second
 World War when Moscow was the unchallenged
 centre of authority of the world Communist move-
 ment. During those years? the capacity of the
 Russians to stir up trouble in distant places (for
 instance in South-East Asia) was so patent, the
 hostility of the Western Communist parties and
 their commitment to revolutionary violence so
 evident, that the Western Powers sank their
 differences and formed a defensive alliance in
 the interests of survival.
 I am not here concerned in any detail with the
 causes of the altered image of the Soviet Union
 and of the great majority of the Communist parties
 that are still, broadly speaking, aligned with
 Moscow.' The roots of change are well known:
 Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin and recog-
 nition that in some circumstances it might now be
 possible for the "people" to attain power by con-
 stitutional, even parliamentary, means; Togliatti's
 polycentrism; the Sino-Soviet split.
 was erratic; and, during his last two years in
 power (after the humiliating confrontation with
 President Kennedy in the Carribean), L-icertain
 and oven timid.' There were signs of a declining
 involvement in undo-China, and in the promotion
 of revolution in parts of Africa. Some curious
 heresies were perpetrated. such as the confer-
 ment of the title of "Hero of the Soviet Union"
 en                         IVdJJUr   and Stnibt;iia,  and  the
 forging  of             "fraternal   (inks" with  the   ruling
 political organisations of the United Arab Re-
 public and Algeria.
 With Khrushchev out of the way, the Brezhnev.
 Kosygin team moved swiftly to restore the mom-
 entum of Russia's drive throughout the world.
 As Professor  Erickson  pointed  out  (SOVIET
 ANALYST, Vol. 1, No. 4), a vast expansion of
 the Soviet nuculear armament programme was
 initiated. But the complementary activities should
 not be  overlooked. In  December  1964,   the
 Russians invited the National Front for the Liber-
 ation of South Vietnam to set up a permanent
 office in Moscow. The curious thing was that
 Khrushchev had not seen fit to do so, as the
 NFLSV already had offices in Peking, Algiers,
 Jakarta, Prague, East Berlin and Havana. Soviet
 help to Left-wing Congolese rebels was resumed.
 In February 1965, Kosygin led a high-powered
 delegation to Hanoi and initiated a massive
 military aid programme to North Vietnam; the
 consequence today being. that about 90 per cent
 of the heavy and modern war material being used
 by the North Vietnamese in its invasion of the
 South is of Soviet origin.
 The Soviet Union's expansionist drive through-
 out the world is indeed in full flood, and Russian
 involvement in support of revolutionary violence
 must be seen in this context, as an important
 element but by no means the only one or even
 the most important. Illusory comfort has been
 derived by Western wishful-thinkers from the
 dissensions within the International Communist
 Movement, the Chinese challenge to Soviet auth-
 ority, the obstinate adventurism of Fidel Castro,
 and above all from Brezhnev's readiness to meet
 Herr Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik half way with
 treaties and arrangements, his offer of a detente
 In Europe and a European Security Treaty and
 More directly relevant is the change in Soviet        his decision to spell out the rules of super-Power
 tactics and techniques since the removal  of             co-existence with President Nixon.

 lutionary violence, then Soviet sponsorship wi It
 as it has always been-to incorporate as many
 countries of the world as possible into the Soviet
 system. Indeed, the Nixon-Brezhnev agreements
 provide the perfect umbrella for the espionage and
 subversive activities of the KGB, and its military
 counterpart the GRU; throughout the world. For
 .'peaceful co-existence" (as both the Chinese and
 the Russians agreed under the World Communist
 Declaration of 1960) means "the intensification"
 of the international class struggle, and the Soviet
 support for "national liberation" movements has
 been reaffirmed on many cccasions. This Soviet
 commitment needs, however, to be critically ex-
 amined. At one level, it is a propaganda commit-
 ment: the Russians wish it to be known that they
 are committed to "national liberation", because
 their revolutionary credentials are under challenge
 from Peking and from the proliferating groups,
 either new or revived, which together constitute
 the New Left. And since a verbal commitment may
 be insufficent, they do provide arms, money and
 training to numerous revolutionary groups. But
 this does not necessarily imply a naive belief in
 the chances of ultimate success of terrorists and
 guerrillas   specially in the rural insurrections
 ideologically favoured by Peking. Still, however,
 they cannot afford to be "out of it": if the
 Chinese, or the Cubans assist violent revolution-
 aries, then the Russians must also do so, at least
 in selected cases. This is the phenomenon I call
 "competitive subversion".
 The  Soviet  commitment  to  revolutionary
 violence should be seen in the context of Soviet
 strategy and of developments over the past four
 years. It has become clearer than ever that an
 important objective in this strategy is the est-
 ablishment of client-States far from the borders of
 the USSR. The first was Cuba, which fell into
 Russia's lap almost by accident. Next came
 Egypt, as a deferred consequence of the ,"Czech"
 arms deal of 1955, and of the Soviet decision to
 build the High Dam at Aswan after John Foster
 Dulles had declined to finance it. Latterly, the
 process has been accelerated, with the conclusion
 of treaties with Egypt and India last year, Soviet
 support for India in its war with Pakistan, with
 the consequent extension of Soviet influence to
 Bangladesh; the new treaty with Iraq (signed in
 April this year); and the powerful Soviet military
 assistance to North Vietnam, which is consistent
 with a Soviet policy objective of encouraging the
 emergence of a greater Vietnam (with Laos and
 Cambodia,  together with  South Vietnam, all
 under North Vietnamese control) as yet another
 client-State, this time on the southern border of
 China. A possible further candidate for client-
 State status is President Atllende's Chile, in which
 the well-organised local Communist Party, adopt-
 ing Moscow's favoured "constitutional road" to
 I  h... dchieve 1 ufiice 1n d'(:vaii-iull yovern-
 be forthcoming-either secretly, or semi-overtly.
 The other objectives include: the "Finlandisation"
 of Western Europe, prior to its incorporation into
 the Soviet system; the isolation of the United
 States; control over Middle East oil and the denial
 of economic resources in that area and in Africa
 to the Chinese. European and North American
 acceptance of a detente on Soviet terms is an
 important element in this total picture, together
 with the achievement of rough nuclear parity with
 the United States and the rapid expansion of
 Soviet naval power in the Mediterranean and
 latterly in the Indian Ocean. Detente gives am-
 munition to those American politicians who wish
 the United States to withdraw its forces from
 Europe. In the meantime, Soviet efforts to weaken
 capitalism,  to  undermine  the  confidence  of
 Western governments, and to destroy the stability
 of non-communist Slates-1-on-,a selective basis
 continues unremittingly.
 The Soviet attitude towards the non-communist
 extremist groups of the Left in many countries is
 conditioned by their ability, as assessed in
 Moscow, to further Russian objectives.  For
 several years, Moscow treated the New Left with
 contempt or derision. But the events of 1968 are
 now seen to have provoked an agonized recon-
 sideration in Moscow. That spring, President
 election; Prague enjoyed its brief moment of
 euphoric freedom from Soviet control; and in
 Paris, the riotous students came within an inch of
 removing General de Gaulle from power. All three
 of these events were triumphs, however short-
 lived, for the New Left. The Russian policy-
 planners took note and drew the consequences.
 Ideally, they favour the constitutional road to
 power through united front or popular front
 tactics, as happened in Chile in 1970, and as may
 well happen one day in Italy or France. This does
 not rule out clandestine support for the more
 violent revolutionaries. This new and more soph-
 isticated approach is a case of "heads we win,
 tails you lose". Revolutionary violence has in fact
 been denounced by the Communist parties of
 Italy, France, Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay and
 Chile. Such parties pose as the champions of
 order, and as candidates for government. But to
 the extent that terrorism and guerrilla tactics
 weaken the State and present Communist parties
 with their "constitutional" opportunity, they are
 worth supporting.

 Russian activities in this field. :I am not here con-

 penetrate Maoist and Trotskyist extremist groups
 in France, Belgium and Italy. It would-be sur-
 rising if they were not making a similar effort
 n the United Kingdom, but with what success is
 of publicly known. The most striking sign of
 Soviet involvement in violence was the seizure of
 #30,000 consignment of Czech arms at Schiphol
 irport, Amsterdam, last October. Two points,

 repared   to help non-Marxist terrorists while
 aintaining normal diplomatic relations with the
 ost country and preaching the "constitutional"

 Arab world and Near East
 The Palestine terrorists and guerrillas face the
 Russians with a dilemma. To the extent that the
 guerrillas are anti-Israeli, the Russians are in-
 clined to support them; on the other hand, the
 groups have proved, on the whole, to be a greater
 menace to the Arab governments than to Israel
 itself, and to support them outright might be
 counter-productive in terms of Soviet relations
 with friendly countries, such as Egypt or Iraq
 Moreover, the Palestinians have a record of un-
 success, with which the Russians do not with to
 be associated: and the wildest among them- Dr
 George Habbash's Popular Front for the Liberation
 of Palestine (PFLP)-are not only boastful where
 the Russians would prefer discretion, but indulge
 in spectacular acts of violence with which, again,
 the Russians would prefer not to be linked. Thus
 in September, 1970, after the PFLP had hijacked
 and destroyed four international air-liners, two
 Soviet lawyers condemned the incident in an
 article in Literaturnaya Gazeta.
 There has certainly been some Soviet aid to the
 PFLP, however, and to the more moderate Al
 Fatah, if only to be able to claim, if challenged,
 that the Palestine liperation movement has not
 been left unaided. (Chinese aid to the PFLP is
 certainly greater than Russian.)  Here, as else-
 where, the Russians have shown some distaste
 for giving aid to groups which they do not control
 and which, moreover, seem determined to go
 their own way. They have tried to meet this situ-
 ation  by fostering the creation                                                                        (in  February,

 In Oman, where Chinese-backed guerrillas of
 the Popular Front for the Liberation of ..the Oc-
 cupied Arabian Gulf (PFLOAG) have been fight-
 ing the Sultan's forces in the Dhofar area with
 some success, the Russians seem to have de-
 cided to complete with Peking. A PFLOAG dele-
 gation visited Moscow  and  East Berlin  last
 autumn and returned with claims  (which the
 Russians have not denied) that Soviet assistance
 would soon be doubled-a claim reminiscent of
 the percentage increases from an unknown base
 during  Stalin's  five-year plans. Encouragingly,
 however, a Soviet camera team has shot a film of
 the Dhofar rebellion entitled "Hot Winds of Free-
 dom", which has won a prize.
 In the non-Arab Middle East, too, there is
 Soviet involvement in revolutionary violence both
 directly and through intermediaries. East Ger-
 many is host to the banned Iranian Communist
 Party (as the Shah himself complained a year
 ago) and serves as a contact point for meetings
 between Soviet agents and the leaders of the
 violent Dev Genc (Revolutionary Youth) organi-
 sation and its Turkish People's Liberation Army
 (TPLP). The TPLP has received arms from Bul-
 garia, perhaps the most assiduous of Russia's
 satellites ir. the provision of aid to terrorists.
 Latin America
 More is known about Soviet involvement in
 Latin America than elsewhere, largely because of
 the disclosures of high-ranking Cuban Intelligence
 defectors An unwilling and unpredictable satel-
 lite, Fidel Castro thvartFJ Soviet efforts to take
 over the Cubar. Communist Party from within b/
 gaoling the pro-Soviet Anibal Escalante early in
 1968 and purging the Party of its Moscow-lean-
 ing "micro-faction". The Russians turned to dir-
 ect pressure, including the threat to cut off all
 economic aid unless Castro stopped criticising
 the Soviet Union and launching plans for guerrilla
 actions in many countries without consulting
 Moscow. Shortly  after  the  expulsion  of  the
 "micro-faction", Castro was compelled to sign a
 secret agreement binding himself to support the
 Soviet line.
 So much was known through the revelations of
 Orlando Castro Hidalgo, a top defector who has
 since told his own story. A more recent high-
 ranking defector, whose name has not yet been
 revealed, has been adding fascinating touches to
 the picture. At issue is Soviet control dyer Fidel
 Castro's revolutionary adventures. The Russians
 were not amused when "Che" Guevara's attempt
 to sir revolution in Bolivia ended in fiasco and his
 own death in 1967. They were determined not to
 find themselves footing the bill for more dis-
 astrous Cuban enterprises.
 Africa
 Sino-Soviet competition is at its fiercest in east
 and southern Africa. An earlier phase of almost
 indiscriminate Soviet subversion ended with the
 overthrow, in February, 1966, of the Nkrurnah
 regime in Ghana, to which Moscow was deeply
 committed. Nowadays, Soviet assistance tends
 to go mainly to movements ."struggling" against
 regimes that can be labelled "neo-colonialist",
 "imperialist", "feudal" or "racist". In contrast to
 Soviet practice in most other areas, the Russians
 give much publicity to their aid to such move-
 ments as the Zimbabwe African People's Union
 (ZAPU), which is based in Zambia with aim of
 "liberating" Rhodesia; the Front for the Libera-
 tion of Mozambique (FRELIMO ); and the South-
 West African People's Organisation (SWAPO).
 The many claims of assistance appearing in the
 Soviet press are, however, couched in general
 terms, avoiding details.
 It is known that at any given moment, several
 hundred Africans-mainl' from Rhodesia, South
 and South-West Afrrcn and the Portuguese terri-
 tories-are undergoing training in terrorist tactics
 i^ Soviet camns, the largest being at Simferopol
 After prolonged pressure, the KGB's men in
 Havana forced Fidel's brother, Raul Castro, in
 1970, to get rid of all anti-Soviet personnel in 'the
 Cuban Directorate General of Intelligence ( DGI ),
 including its chief, Pineiro Losada. As Minister of
 the Revolutionary Armed Forces, Major Castro
 has theoretical control (subject, now, to Soviet
 approval) over the DGI. The purge of the DGI
 was not, however, the end of the story. Under
 Fidel Castro's protection, Pineiro Losada and the
 anti-Soviet staff dismissed from the DGI, set up a
 new organisation, the Directorate of National
 LiLaration (DLN).
 An unprecedented situation has resulted. The
 Russians are prepared to finance DGI operations
 thjt have their approval: these include training in
 Chile for units of the National Liberation Army of
 Bolivia, and also for guerrillas of the Chilean
 Movement of  the  Revolutionary  Left (M I R) .
 These training activities take place in Chile be-
 cause President Allende agreed last year to allow
 the Cubans to use their embassy in Santiago as
 their main centre for revolutionary operations in
 South America. (Spy for Fidel: E. A. Seemann
 Publishing, Miami, 1970).

 Fidel* Castro s DLN, however, has plans for
 operations in many countries for which there is
 neither  Soviet approval nor money. A Soviet
 near- streang!ehold on the Cuban economy is exer-
 cised through the joint Cuban-Soviet Economic
 Commission and the Moscow Narodny Bank in
 Havana. To finance non-approved revolutionary
 ventures, therc.fore, Fidel Castro has had to take
 what  he  can  from  Cuban-controlled  internal
 revenues and foreign trade--inadeaua,.e sources
 for an ambitious man. Now, according to the de-
 fector. he has turned to an unexpected source for
 financial and military  id: North Korea, which has
 emerged over the past eighteen months as a
 major new subversive centre.
 Under a trianrlular deal, Chile recognised North
 Korea, which opened an embassy in Santiago; a
 North Korean guerrilla training mission, stationed
 in Cuba since '1970, was thus enabled to transfer
 to Chile and set up new training camps.
 The Chilean involved in these arrangements
 was the extreme left-wing secretary-general of
 Allende's own Socialist party, Senator Carlos
 Altamirano, who flew to Pyongyang a year ago
 from Moscow in Kim 11 Sung's luxurious Presi-
 dential aircraft. On 30 June, 1971, on his return
 to Santiago, Altamirano briefed a plenum ul the
 Socialist party on his visit, having returned with a
 North Korean offer to train the Chilean Socialist
 pars-military forces, not to be confused with the
 larger forces of the MIR, with which they are in
 rivalry.
 The present situation is thus incredibly con-
 fused, and Allende's recent cabinet crisis,  in
 which he dismissed the non-party left-wing extre-
 mist,  Pedro  Vuskovic,  as' Minister  of  the
 Economy, has merely added to the confusion.
 Once again, the Russians are seen to be playing a
 dual  role: on the  one hand, supporting the
 cautious  but disciplined Moscow-line Chilean
 Communist Party (a member of the ruling Popu-
 lar Unity coalition) which supports the govern-
 ment's "constitutional" take-over of the econ-
 omy and denounces the MIR and its land seizures

 MOSCOW, Aug. 7--The So-
 viet Government newspaper Iz-
 vestia today issued a lengthy,
 tiara-bitting attack on a new
 Chinese atlas, accusing Peking
 of making "absurd demands"
 on Moscow by laying claim to
 600,000 square r*   gr(ki ilftl

 proval of Fidel Castro and his autonomous Direc-
 torate of Liberation.
 The only sufferers in this free-for-all are the
 Chileans. For there is a fundamental difference
 between the North Korean and the Cuban ap-
 proach to revolutionary violcncc.. The Cubans and
 other Latin Americans hitherto have supported a
 gradual policy of bombings, bank robberies and
 assassinations, avoiding a direct confrontation
 with local security forces, but sapping the will of
 governments.  The  North  Koreans,  howevc.r,
 preach more aggressive tartir:s: immediate and
 large-scale acts of sabotage (the blowing up of
 railway lines, bridges, telecommunications instal-
 lations and military barracks) to force the armed
 forces  into premature. action.  Harassment by
 fast-moving guerrillas, and ultimately the decima-
 tion of the military, are supposed to ensue. Both
 the MIR and the left-wing Socialists are com-
 mitted to creating an "irreversible" revolutionary
 State.  But the Socialists, with  North Korean
 backing, want to go further still by cordoning off
 the southern third of Chile and setting up a
 "Revolutionary  Republic  of  South  Chile", re-
 gardless of what happens to Allende's Com-
 munist backed experiment in the cities. Chile is
 where competitive subversion has gone mad.
 And thus, over a greater part of the world's
 surface we note a Soviet involvement-of vary-
 ing overtness-in the preparation or encourage-
 rnent of violent action against a whole range of
 authorities. We should not, perhaps, be misled by
 the comparative immunity of those areas which
 are for the time being exempt from these atten-
 tions. For that is clearly a matter of tactics, rather
 than principle, and there seems little reason to
 regard it as permanent.

 The Chinese leadership has tried by all means to foment dissension in the relations
 of the socialist community countries and to undermine the results of their joint
 efforts in the international arena.  In reality the Chinese leadership's antagonism
 to the foreign policy of the socialist countries underscores its collusion with the
 imperialist reactionary forces.  This is because it has taken a stand.which is
 incompatible with the objective of strengthening peace and security--stands which
 are the concern of all peoples, including the Chinese people. /
 MYSL I POLITY$A Article
 Moscow in Mandarin to China 1600 GMT 9 Aug 72 B
 (Text]  Recently, MYSL I POLITYKA, a Polish monthly magazine, published a lengthy
 article on the Chinese leaders' changes in policy toward the Soviet Union and other
 socialist countries from 1949 to the present.  The article discussed the two historical
 periods of the PRC:  the period in'whieh the Chinese leadership pursued a policy of
 promoting friendly relations and cooperation with socia;ist countries; and the period
 in which the Chinese leadership followed An anti-Soviet road and tried to create
 splits in the socialist community..
 The entire section on Mongolia reconfirms the correctness of the assessment made by
 Comrade Yu. Tsedenbal at the international conference of communist and workers parties
 in 1969:  "The Mongolian People's Republic, as one of'-the countries which borders on
 China, bears the direct brunt of the action of the Mao Tse'tung antisocialist political
 group and is`subjected to its hostile attacks in the most varied directions..., The
 anti-Mongolian policy and actions of the Mao Tse-tung group are based on its great-
 power, chauvinist claims to our country inherited from the Chinese militarists and the
 Chiang Kai-shekists.   ;t'is well known that in an interview with a groin of Japanese
 socialists.  Mao.Tse-tung made one of his regular statements about his intention to
 annex Mongolia to China no later than 1964."
 Pursuing the current Peking doctrines, the authors of the "Atlas" do not want to
 acknowledge the existence of the socialist system.   It is true that they mention
 that in Asia after World War II China, Korea, and Vietnam achieved victories in the
 popular revolution and the anti-aimperialist struggle and followed a socialist path,
 while in Europe the majority of.edntral and southeastern European states broke'away
 from the capitalist system and embarked upon the socialist path.  However, it transpires
 from the subsequent 1;ext.that only China in Asia and Albania in Europe are the "great
 beacons of socialism?"
 The compilers of the "Atlas" have somehow forgotten to mention the emergence and
 development: of the first socialist state in Latin America--Cuba.
 Peking's current aspiration to oounterpose some countries to others and to engender
 mutual distrust in them by any means is also expressed in the "Atlas."  Misinformation
 and various provocative versions abort the socialist countries, their history, the
 nature of foreign economic contacts and so forth are stealthily fed to its readers.
 In the "Europe" section the publisheris of the "Atlas" also attack the nature of mutual.
 relations between the CEMA countries.  For a long time there has-been no reaction from
 Peking to the important measures of the socialist CEMA states to further strengthen
 and improve their cooperation.  The "Atlas" has apparently tried to compensate for the
 period of "restraint."  In this publication Chinese propaganda attempts to denigrate
 CEMA activity to the maximum possible extent.
 Socialist economic integration, the coordination of national economic plans, and
 production cooperation and specialization among the fraternal countries are clearly
 not to the Peking leadership's liking.  In their attempts to discredit the socialist
 countries$ cooperation the compiler              la"  s

 Not a single document of the Soy7.1'rtt state or the statements made by Lenin puts the
 treaties on the border with China in the category of "unequal" or subject to review.
 V.I. Lenin never at any time cast doubt on the border between the USSR and China.
 This question was clear to the Chinese revolutionaries who,,relying on Soviet aid
 and support, waged a struggle for the national and social liberation of-the Chinese
 people.  It is not out of place to mention that both the leaders of the Chinese
 Communist Party and.sebsequently the PRC Government frequently stressed that after
 the October Revolution the Soviet state built its relations with China on the basis of
 equality and respect for the sovereign rights of the Chinese people.  Mao Tse-tung
 noted in 1945 at the Seventh CCP Congress that "the Soviet Union was the first to
 renounce the unequal treaties and to conclude new, equal treaties with China."  Mao
 Tse-tung also spoke about this,in Moscow on 16 December 1949.  In accordance with the
 14 February 1950 treaty on friendship,_alliance and mutual aid between the USSR and
 the PRC, both sides pledged lto'build their relationships proceeding' from the principles
 of "mutual respect for state sovereignty and territorial integrity."
 Everything would seem clear.  ',..Why then have the Chinese powers used the publication
 of the "World Atlas" to make a new attempt to cast doubt on the historically formed
 and legally established border between the USSR and the PRC and claim territory in
 which Soviet people live and which-is a part of the USSR?  It is perhaps to manufacture
 a "territorial problem" which would complicate relations between neighbors for many
 years to come?
 The PRC is in fact that only big state whose leadership i&tisiiig territorial
 disputes with Its neighbors in the north, south, east and west.  However, those who
 make absurd demands from the USSR and cast doubt on the Soviet Union's possession
 [prinalezhnoat] of certain sectors of territory should bear in mind the Soviet
 people's attitude to these claims.
 In their aspiration to impose Maoist political concepts on the reader, the authors
 of the "Atlas" frequently prove to be out of tune with geography itself.  They have
 declared the Soviet Union to be only a "European country."  But, as always happens
 in these cases, the authors of the "Atlas" have difficulty in making both fiends meet.
 .Having called the Soviet Union only a "European power," they start to list the
 countries it borders on, and it turns out that of the 12 countries with which the
 USSR has land borders, six are Asian states, while with one of them along--China---
 the length of the border is nearly'7,500 kilometers.  Once again, it is clearly_-mot
 fortuitous that the "Atlas" does not mention that two-thirds of USSR territory is
 in Asia.  The USSR's position as a European-Asian bountry certainly does not suit the
 Peking politicians and geographers!  Indeed, the denial of this truth conceals
 intentions which are far from geographical.
 Taking all this into account, it can be said that it is not an "atlas of peace"
 but an "atlas of enmity" which has been published in Peking.   [pun on the Russian
 word "mir" which means either "world or "peace"] The people who issue such publica-
 tions pursue the aim of fanning enmity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples and
 educating the Chinese population in a spirit of hatred for other peoples, particularly
 neighbors and in a spirit of the revision of Chipa's borders with contiguous
 countries.  It is a dangerous trend fraught with serious.oonsequenoes.
