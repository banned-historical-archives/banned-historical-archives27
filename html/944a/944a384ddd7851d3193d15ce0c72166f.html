 ETHIOPIA-SOMALIA:  Situation Report
 //The Somalis continued over the weekend
 to press their claim that Ethiopia's Soviet- and Cuban-supported
 counteroffensive had begun.  We believe, however,  that the Ethio-
 pians are probably conducting limited tactical operations in an
 effort to take advantage of the recent Somali setbacks around
 Harar. F_                                                                 I 25X1
 I             IThe Somali Minister of Information told the press
 on Saturday that a two-pronged Ethiopian counteroffensive had
 begun late last week. The Somali Foreign Minister called in
 Western ambassadors the same day to deliver a similar message,
 claiming that the offensive was being carried out by Soviets
 and Cubans and that no Ethiopian troops were involved.
 //According to the US Ambassador, however, So-
 mali President Siad told the Egyptian Ambassador earlier that
 the situation was not "desperate." Moreover, an Egyptian mili-
 tary attache in Mogadiscio who has been a frequent reporter
 on Somali military matters indicated to US Embassy officials
 on Saturday that the Somalis still seemed able to handle the
 situation. He said Somali morale remained good.//
 //There is little doubt that the Somalis are be-
 coming increasingly concerned about an impending Ethiopian of-
 fensive, particularly in the wake of their recent setbacks
 around Harar. We have good evidence, however, that the Ethio-
 pians are holding to their schedule for the offensive, which
 does not call for sustained operations to begin for at least
 a few more weeks.//
 The Somalis are probably feeling pressure from
 Ethiopian ground and air attacks. These attacks are aimed at
 maintaining the initiative the Ethiopians seized after driving

 the Somalis back from Harar late last month,

 n a speech to the National Assembly on Thursday,
 Portuguese Prime Minister Soares outlined his new government's
 program and indicated that the ideals of the Socialist Party
 would have to take a back seat to economic recovery for now.
 The new program closely follows the agreement between the So-
 cialists and Center Democrats that gives Soares majority support
 in the legislature. It subordinates almost every sector of na-
 tional life to the need for economic recovery.
 Soares said he was concerned that the austerity meas-
 ures he plans to adopt could cause social unrest but warned that
 further crises might endanger democracy.  He said he will reopen
 talks with the opposition parties and other groups in the country
 to seek their support,  but even as he spoke thousands of railroad
 workers and teachers were on strike.
 Economic stabilization and resumption of negotiations
 with the International Monetary Fund for crucial loans are the
 main priorities of the 312-page program.  The strategy proposed
 for achieving stabilization is to reduce the balance-of-payments
 deficit by curbing consumption and imports while stimulating in-
 vestment and exports.
 Cuts in consumption and imports are expected to be
 achieved by limiting wage increases, by allowing prices to re-
 flect costs, and by exercising fiscal and monetary restraint.
 Stimulating investment and promoting exports is to be accomplished
 through greater public capital spending and through measures aimed
 at improving the financial position of enterprises, particularly
 labor legislation to increase productivity and contain labor
 costs.
 The economic objectives of the program appear to be
 generally in line with recommendations put forward by the IMF
 before talks with Portugal. were suspended in December. Negotiators
 from the Fund will probably be invited to return to Portugal soon
 after a vote approving the government program.  Such a vote is ex-
 pected by the middle of this month.  In the meantime,  a technical-
 level group from Portugal may bring the Fund up to date on Portu-
 guese economic developments.
 I             IThe program  could bring about an economic slowdown ac-
 companied by still higher unemployment and a slump in production
 of goods and services. Consumers will be pinched by higher prices

 and increased taxes. Most segments of the public will probably
 take a wait-and-see attitude initially, but the Communist Party,
 which controls 80 percent of organized labor, will probably try
 to fan discontent to advance its political position.
 Soares had hardly finished his presentation before a
 number of labor organizations demonstrated their disapproval of
 the government and its program.  Some 27,000 railroad workers and
 20,000 school teachers went on strike on Thursday to highlight
 grievances dating back to the first Soares government, which
 fell on 8 December. While not directly related to the new belt-
 tightening measures, the strikes reflect labor's contempt for the
 socialist-conservative regime and fears that labor's interests
 are threatened. Further labor disturbances are expected.
 Soares'  speech did little to inspire confidence among
 leftists.  "Only the advocates of Utopia," he said,  "could be-
 lieve that, given the present balance of forces in Portuguese
 society and the international situation,  it would be possible
 here and now to advance toward democratic socialism." He also
 said that the agrarian reform law--which has long roused the
 Communists' ire by threatening some of their holdings acquired
 in the early days of the 1974 revolution--will be pushed more
 effectively than in the past.
 The Prime Minister sought to discourage strikes, a
 major weapon in the Communist arsenal. While acknowledging
 that workers had a right to defend their legitimate interests,
 Soares implied that strikes were more often mounted to test the
 strength of the political institutions.  Such strikes, he said,
 would antagonize the country's extreme right and perhaps prompt
 a coup.
 Soares appeared less concerned about the Social Demo-
 crats, his major opposition on the right. The Social Democrats
 decided at a party congress last week to adopt a position of
 selective, rather than systematic, opposition.  They probably
 will not oppose the government on many of its policies but will
 resist any kowtowing to the left or extensive foreign interven-
 tion in the Portuguese economy.
 D
 Soares strongly defended his alliance of convenience
 with the Center Democrats, saying that they were the only party

 Approved For Rel
 of the former opposition willing to submerge narrow party in-
 terests for the country's welfare.  Both Soares and Center Demo-
 cratic leader Freitas do Amaral say their pact will last until
 regularly scheduled elections are held in 1980. Prospects look
 good for the short term, but if Soares is unable to secure some
 support from the Communists and the labor groups they control,
 SUDAN: Concerns About Chad
 The situation in northern Chad,  where Libyan-backed
 rebels have made significant gains over the past few days, is
 probably being watched carefully by  the Sudanese,  whc have had
 their own troubles in the past with Libyan-supported dissidents.
 President Numayri will become particularly concerned if the
 fighting spreads to the Chad-Sudan border area, an area of
 chronic Sudanese dissidence.
 Numayri fears that Libya's support for the Chadian
 rebels is inspired by the Soviets and part of a broader plan
 to undermine Western-oriented governments in the region.  The
 Sudanese believe the Soviets want to overthrow Numayri to
 strike a blow at Egypt.
 The Sudanese are already in something of a bind on
 policy toward the Horn of Africa.  Saudi Arabia, which provides
 Sudan with substantial economic support, is urging Numayri to
 back the Somalis against Ethiopia. Numayri believes the Ethi-
 opians will eventually win in the Horn, does not want to be
 associated with a losing cause, and wants to avoid creating
 another enemy that is backed by the Soviets.                               25X1

 THAILAND-CAMBODIA: Diplomatic Visit
 Thai Foreign Minister Uppadit returned to
 Bangkok on Thursday after four days of talks with Cambodian
 Foreign Minister leng Sary in Phnom Penh. Labeling the talks
 a success,  Uppadit announced that the two governments had
 agreed to exchange ambassadors soon and to resume trade and
 economic relations.
 I                    The Thai are anxious to hold further talks
 aimed at easing tensions along the 800-kilometer Thai-Cambodian
 border. Cambodian forces apparently attacked a Thai village
 nnly five days before Uppadit. left for Phnom Penh.
 The Foreign Ministers' talks essentially returned
 Thai-Cambodian relations to the point they had reached in Oc-
 tober 1975, when both sides signed a communique agreeing to ex-
 change ambassadors. This exchange was never carried out, but
 Cambodia's border war with Vietnam may now encourage Phnom Penh
 to be more cooperative. During the talks the Cambodians also

 Foreign Ministry proposed a three-point plan to resolve
 current border conflict with Cambodia. The plan calls for
 two sides to:
 End hostilities immediately and withdraw their mili-
 tary forces five kilometers from the border,
 Meet at Hanoi, Phnom Penh,  or a point on the border
 to discuss and conclude a treaty banning aggression
 and subversion.
 -- Agree on an appropriate form of international, guarantee
 and supervision.
 The Vietnamese clearly are eager to halt tre f  ht'
 and to begin talks that would end Cambodian border incursions. IIg
 Hanoi probably made the proposal publicly in order to put pres-
 sure on Phnom Penh to respond, and to place the onus on the
 Cambodians for any failure to reach a peaceful settlement. The
 Vietnamese no doubt realize that Cambodia is unwilling to with-
 draw its military forces from Cambodian territory near the
 border and that it is even less willing to allow the UN or an-
 other international body to police a cease-fire line.
 The Cambodians are likely to reject the proposal and
 enounce it as a propaganda ploy, but their reaction could pro-
 vide some indication of whether they have any interest in reach-
 ing a peaceful resolution of the issue. A response that suggests
 alternate conditions for negotiations, for example, would be a
 hopeful sign. Phnom Penh, of course, could also signal a will-
 ingness to ease tensions by redu    g its provocations along the
 border.  F__                         I

 CHINA-EGYPT:  Support for Sadat
 Peking has officiaZZy endorsed Egyptian President

 a statement by Premier Hua Kuo-feng broadcast on Saturday by
 the official Chinese news agency.

 The statement was made in conjunction with a meeting between

 Hua and special Egyptian envoy Tuhami, who delivered a personal
 letter from Sadat. The Egyptian press reported last week that
 the letter would serve to bring the Chinese up to date on the
 latest Middle East developments.
 China's willingness to go on record in support of
 Sadat reflects its privately expressed apprehensions that the
 continued stalemate or a breakdown in the Egyptian-Israeli
 talks could seriously erode Sadat's support at home. Two years
 ago, similar Chinese concerns over the effect that the USSR's
 halt in military aid to Egypt might have had on Sadat's posi-
 tion--coupled with the desire to score propaganda points at
 Soviet expense--resulted in much-publicized but largely sym-
 bolic Chinese shipments of military aid to Cairo.
 Hua's endorsement of Sadat is likely to be a "one-
 shot" affair; Peking has diplomatic relations and political
 equities to protect with many of the hard-line Arab governments.
 In quoting Hua at a banquet for Tuhami, Vice Premier :Li Hsien-
 nien omitted Hua's specific statement of support for Sadat's
 peace initiative while repeating the Premier's urgings for Arab
 unity.
