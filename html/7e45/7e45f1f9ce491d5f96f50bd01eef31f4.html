 PROPAGANDA ON THE KOREAN! WAR ANNIVERSARY
 Pyongyang media marked the 20th anniversary of the o??.tbreak of
 the Korean War with accounts of the usual Pyongyang mass rally,
 press articles, an4 publicity for foreign observance of a
 "month of solidarity" with North Korea, beginning with the
 25 June anniversary of the war and lasting until the 27 July
 anniversary of the signing of the armistice.  Since this
 year's anniversary was a decennial, Kim Il-song played a
 part in the festivities and attended the Pyongyang rally, as
 he had done on the 10th anniversary.  First Vice Premier
 Kim I1, who addressed the rally this year, was normally
 the ranking official in the past when the speakers were
 lower-level functionaries representing trade unions,
 agricultural, youth, and women's organizations.*
 The higher-level observance this year also included a lengthy
 DPRK Government memorandum outlining basic policies instead
 of the customary annual joint statement by public organizations.
 This year's commemoration in Pyongydng was also unique in that
 special foreign delegations attended for the first time--from
 the PRC, headed by PLA Chief if Staff Huang Yung-sheng, and
 from the DRV, South Vietnam's PRG, and the Laotian NLHX, as
 well as Cwnbodia's Prince Sihanouk who was in North Korea for
 a state visit.
 Peking, which had ignored the anniversary for the past three
 years, marked it this time with voluminous and effusive
 propaganda, including a joint editorial in PEOPLE'S DAILY,
 RED FLAG, and LIBERATION ARMY DAILY--fanfare iii keeping with
 the recent warming of Sino-Korean relations that was high-
 lighted by Chou En-lai's 5-7 April visit to Pyongyang.  This
 year, for the first time, Peking linked its commemoration
 of the Korean War anniversary to its observance of the
 27 June anniversary of the U.S. "occupation" of Taiwan,
 apparently as part of its current propaganda focus on
 a united Asian struggle against "U.S. imperialism."**
 Kim Il was the ranking leader at the Pyongyang rally in
 1966, 1968, and 1969; Vice Premier Kim Kwang-hyop was the top
 leader present in 1967.
 **  During the two-week period 22 June to 5 July, Peking devoted
 39 percent of its total broadcast propaganda output to the
 combined celebration of the Korean War and Taiwan anniversaries.
 During a comparable two-week period in 1960, Peking's attention
 to the 10th anniversaries of both events totaled only 13 percent.

 10 JULY 1970
 Further testimony to the importance Pyongyang and Peking both
 attached to this year's anniversary was the dispatch of DPRK
 Foreign Minister Pak Song-chol to Peking, where he was received
 by Mao Tse-tung and Lin Piao and addressed a Peking rally
 along with PRC Vice Premier Li I-Isien-nien.
 Pyongyang, while reciprocating Peking's avowals of friendship,
 was careful in its treatment of the Soviets.  North K,)rean media
 duly reported veiled anti-Soviet polemical remarks made by
 PRC spokesmen on the anniversary, but DPRK speakers avoided
 such remarks on their own authority and made a point of
 balancing their thanks for Chinese aid with expressions of
 gratitude for Soviet aid.
 The Soviets, in contrast to the Chinese, gave the decennial
 the same treatment they have accorded the routine annual
 anniversaries, with a Moscow city rally addressed by the
 chairman of the USSR-DPRK Friendship Society.
 PYONGYANG RESTATES BASIC POSITIONS
 The broad propaganda themes on the anniversary this year as
 usual are those generally pressed in Pyongyang propaganda:
 that the United States and the ROK "puppets" are conducting
 "provocations" and "war preparations" against the DPRK, but
 that they should not forget the "lessons" of the "defeat"
 in the Korean War; that only the U.S. "imperialists" and ROK
 "puppets" stand in the way of unification; and that the
 United Nations has no right to interfere in the unification
 question.  The propaganda once again reaffirms North Korea's
 dedication to the notion of "peaceful" unification, while
 at the same time praising the "active anti-U.S., national
 salvation struggle" of the South Korean people.,
 U.S. "WAR PROVOCATIONS"
 The DPRK Government memorandum, like one on the 15th anniver-
 sary of the -war in 1965, reviewed the history of U.S. "aggression"
 against Korea, now carrying it back.as far as the 19th
 century.  It brought the bill of particulars up to date and,
 in addition to recalling the Pueblo incident of January 1968
 and the downing of the U.S. EC-121 "spy plane" in April 1969,
 cited the 5 June 1970 sinking of an "armed spy ship"
 allegedly sent into North Korean coastal waters by the U.S.
 "imperialist aggressors."

 10 JULY 1970
 In standard fashion, the memorandum charged that intensification
 of U.S. aggressive maneuvers has  "led the situation in Korea
 to extreme tension in which a war may break out again at any
 moment."  A number of the speakers, including Kim 11 at the
 Pyongyang rally and Pak Song-chol at the rally in Peking,
 likened the current situation to that of June 1950 when the
 United States "triggered" the Korean War.  This theme has been
 recurrent since its introduction in November 1966, following
 President Johnson's trip to South Korea and the step-up of
 incidents at the demarcation line, and has been a staple of
 Korean War anniversary propaganda since then.
 "PEACEFUL" UNIFICATION
 While accusing the United States of war preparations, the
 government memorandum also repeated a formulation on peaceful
 unification which appeared in the joint statement by public
 organizations on last year's anniversary.*  It recalled that
 the DPRK has "proclaimed more than once that it has no
 intention of marching to the South nor will it s&tle the
 question of Korean unification by force of arms."  The
 statement last year simply asserted, without elaboration, the'
 Kim Il-song had said this "long ago."
 The stress on "peaceful" unification which marked the 1969
 anniversary contrasted with the propaganda on the anniversaries
 in the two previous years.  The comment in 1967 was relatively
 militant, in the pattern that developed after the Korean
 Workers' Pc;:ty conference of October 1966 at which the need
 to build up DPRK defenses was emphasized.  The rally speaker
 and some commentators declared on the 1967 anniversary that
 the Korean People's Army (KPA) was ready to "annihilate the
 aggressors and achieve unification of the country any time
 it is ordered by the party and the leader."  On the 1968
 anniversary Pyongyang stressed the militant formulations which
 had come into use following the Pueblo incident and also
 praised the South Korean "armed guerrilla stru(;gle" -a theme
 that had become prominent beginning in July 1967 when the
 dispatch of DPRK agents to the South was intensified.
 *  The only Chinese reference to the DPRK Government statement in
 Peking's anniversary propaganda is an expression of "firm support"
 for it by Chou En-lai at a banquet given by the DPRK Ambassador
 on the 28th.  Chinese speakers as usual omitted the term "peaceful"
 when expressing support for the Korean people's "just struggle"
 for the unification of their homeland.

 10 JULY 1970
 The 1970 government memorandum reviewed Pyongyang's frequently
 repeated proposals for ach:'_eving "peaceful" unification,
 including conclusion of a "peace treaty" between North and
 South Korea and the reduction of their respective armies to
 100,000, free North-South general elections, and establishment
 of a transitional North-South confederation.  These proposals
 are normally recapped by Pyongyang in such official statements
 as the annual public organizations' statement on the Korean
 War anniversary and government statements on the annual UNGA
 discussion of the "Korean question."  Kim Il-song repeated
 the proposals most recently in a letter to Byungcholl Koh,
 president of the United Front for Korean Democracy in New York,
 which was carried by KCNA on 3 June.  Kim had sent a similar
 letter to Yongjun Kim, president of the Korean Affairs
 Institute in Washington, D.C., in January 1967.  Kim's letters
 and the government memoranda on the UNGA discussions reviewed
 various proposals put forward in the 1950's and early 1960's.
 The current memorandum also repeated the North Korean proposal
 that "an international conference of countries concerned
 be convened, if necessary, to peacefully settle the Korean
 question."  This proposal appeared in the public organizations'
 statement on the anniversary last year.  First broached in
 the mid-1950's, the proposal was resurfaced on 21 July 1966
 in a DPRK Government memorandum on the UN General Assembly
 discussion of Korea.  It was also included in the memoranda
 issued in connection with the UNGA debate in 1967 and 1969,
 alth;ugh not in 1968.  The omission in 1968 was probably
 traceable to North Korea's propaganda militancy following the
 Pueblo incident and the stress on the South Korean "armed
 guerrilla struggle" after July 1967.
 SOUTH KOREAN STRUGGLE, "REVOLUTIONARY PARTY"
 The government memorandum praised the South Korean people's
 "active anti-U.S., national salvation struggle," which it
 said is "gaining in  scope" and "taking various forms,
 including armed struggle."  The usual "appeal to the South
 Korean people," adopted at the Pyongyang rally and carried
 by KCNA oii the 29th, called upon the people of South Korea
 to oust the "'U.S. imperialist aggressors" and overthrow the
 Pak Chong-hui "clique," reminding them that they have the
 "powerful revolutionary base" and the "militant support and
 eizcouragement" of the northern half of the country.

 10 JULY 1970
 Much of the anniversary comment briefly mentioned the "vanguard"
 South Korean Revolutionary Party for Reunification, the
 establishment of which was announced by Pyongyang on 20 June.*
 The fact that it is a "Marxist-Leninist" party, however, is
 noted exp''_icitly only in a NODUNG SINMUN anniversary article
 by a KPA general.  There was no indication that representatives
 of the party pal-bicipated in the anniversary ceremonies in
 Pyongyang.  But a domestic service announcer on 26 June read
 a speech "on behalf" of an unnamed representative of the party,
 and belatedly--on 1 July--KCNA carried a "written" speech by
 a southern party representative.
 Although there were references to "armed struggle" in this year's
 anniversary materials, there was nothing to match the militancy
 of 1968.  The armed struggle theme had taken on propaganda
 prominence in July 1967 and was reflected in the war
 anniversary propaganda the following June.  There were
 references to the buildup of the "revolutionary base" in the
 Nort,L to "assist" the South Korean struggle, and the propaganda
 spoke of. "liberation" of the South Korean people by the North
 Korean army if the U.S. "imperialists" attacked.  On the 1969
 anniversary, when the stress was on "peaceful" unification,
 propaganda referred to the South Korean "revolutionary
 struggle" but not to an "armed guerrilla struggle."  This
 phrase, however, has appeared in propaganda occasionally over
 the past year.
 PEKING LAUDS FRIENDSHIP, COf41ON INTERESTS WITH DPRK
 Sino-Korean friendship was warmly praised by both sides in
 anniversary propaganda, but Peking ,:as particularly effusive.
 PLA Chief of Staff Huang Yung-sheng, speaking at the
 Pyongyang rally, typified the comment when he described
 the two countries as closely related like "lips and teeth"
 and the two peoples as "comrades-in-arms and brothers
 standing on the same revolutionary front."  He added that
 they have :'ought "shoulder to shoulder in the protracted
 struggle" against Japanese and U.S. imperialism and that
 their friendship is "cemented in blood."  Nevertheless,
 Peking failed to recall that it has a treaty of friendship,

 cooperation, and mutual assistance with the DPRK.  Chinese media
 gave token publicity to the 11 July anniversary of the treaty
 signing last year, although it totally ignored the Korean War
 anniversary. *
 DPRK Foreign Minister Pak Song-chol was s,rarmly welcomed in
 Peking, where he was received by Mao Tse-tung and Lin Piao
 and addressed a Peking rally; he also visited Shanghai, and
 deputy head of the DPRK delegation Kim Chung-nin went to
 Shenyang, both being feted by revolutionary committee chairmen
 at rallies and banquets.   (Many of China's provinces also held
 local rallies.)  A lower-ranking Korean group had gone to
 Peking for the 15th anniversary, but there was no such
 delegation for the 10th, when the Peking rally was addressed
 by the DPRK ambassador.
 PYONGYANG, PEKING PRAISE ASIAN SOLIDARITY
 Both Pyongyang and Peking praised the "anti-imperialist united
 front of the revolutionary Asian people"--a theme that has
 become increasingly prominent in their propaganda since the
 overthrow of Sihanouk, and especially since Mao's 20 May
 statement on the Cambodian and other revolutions.  Most of
 the anniversary speakers cited various brief passages from
 the Mao statement regarding the need for unity of peoples
 of the world against "U.S. aggression," the ability of
 small countries to defeat big ones, and "revolution" as
 the main trend today.  Most of the Korean speakers quoted
 from Kim I1-song's speech at a 15 June banquet for the
 visiting Prince Sihanouk in which he called for a "united
 front" of "the peoples of various Asian countries making
 revolution, including Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, China, and
 Korea."
 *  Peking also totally ignored the anniversary of the war in
 1968 and gave it only cursory acknowledgment in brief NCNA
 reports in 1967.  Peking last observed the anniversary normally
 in 1966--before Sino-Korean relations began to deteriorate
 seriously--with a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial and a Peking rally
 addressed by a PRC Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee official.

 The Asian solidarity theme was served by the presence in
 Pyongyang of the delegations from the Indochinese countries
 as well as from the PRC.  There is no known precedent for
 such delegations  at the anniversary observance.  The
 groups were led by Tran Huu Duc, Minister attached to the
 Premier's Office of the DRV; Nguyen Van Hieu, "special
 erivcy" of the NFLSV and PRG (the med,a do not mention that
 he was formerly PRG ambassador to Cambodia); and Sanan
 Soutthichak, NLHX Central Committee member.  Cambodia was
 r-cpresented by Prince Sihanouk, already in the DPRK for a
 state visit.  They all addressed the Pyongyang rally, were
 received by Kim Il-song and entertained at a DPRK Cabinet
 banquet, and in return jointly hosted a banquet for Kim
 Il-song.
 In various speeches in Pyongyang the Indochinese delegates
 thanked North Korea, the PRC,"and other socialist countries"
 for their assistance and backing.  The only direct mention
 of the USSR appeared in the speech by the NLHX delegate at
 the Pyongyang rally.  En route to Pyongyang, the Indochinese
 delegations stopped in Peking on the 23d, traveling from
 there the next day in the same plane with the PliC group.
 All four delegations left Pyongymig together on the 28th
 and were entertained at a banquet in Peking by the DPRK
 Ambassador that evenipg; they left for home on the 29th.
 PRC USES OCCASION TO CRITICIZE USSR; DPRK CIRCUMSPECT
 Some of Peking's anniversary comment included remarks
 implicitly critical of the Soviet Union.  Peking's joint
 editorial, entitled "People of Asia, Unite and Drive the
 U.S. Aggressors Out of Asia!," included the assertion
 that "there are certain persons who are collaborating with
 U.S. imperialism in evil doings, fraternizing with the
 Japanese reactionaries, and even maintaining dirty relations
 with Lon Nol and his like."  This charge was reported by
 Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien at the Peking rally and by the
 chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Liaoning
 Province at the Shenyang rally for the deputy head of the
 DPRK delegation.

 10 JULY 1970
 Other Chinese spokesmen, including Chou En-lai at the banquet
 in honor of Pak Song-chol, leveled veiled criticism at the
 USSR.  Chou remarked that the attitude one takes toward the
 U.S. and Japanese reactionaries--whether one "condemns and
 fights them" or "encourages and connives with them"--is the
 principal criterion of a "true" or "sham" revolutionary.
 He associated the Koreans with this view, adding that "as
 the Korean comrades say, it is a question of basic stand."
 l similar comment was made by the chairman of the Shanghai
 Municipal Revolutionary Committee at the Shanghai rally for
 Pak Song-chol.  Huang Yung-sheng, at the Pyongyang rally,
 made a remark in the same vein but omitted the reference
 to the Koreans sharing this sentiment.   The formulation,
 including the reference to the Korean view, had previously
 been used by (Chou En-lai on 5 April when he was in Pyongyang,
 evidently conveying resentment at that time over Soviet
 dealings with Japan.  Shortly before Chou's visit, the
 North Koreans had in fact called upon the socialist
 countries to maintain "an invariable stand of principle"
 regarding Japan in a lengthy 30 March NODONG SINMUN
 article recounting the evils of Japanese militarism.
 Pyongyang duly reported the Chinese speakers' polemical
 remarks but avoided anti-Soviet statements on its own
 authority.  The DPRK thanked the Chinese for sending
 volunteers who assisted the Koreans "with blood" during
 the war, but added that the people of the Soviet Union
 and other socialist countries also gave the Koreans
 support and assistance" during the war.  The USSR was
 mentioned by name in this context in the DPRK Government
 statement, by Kim Il at the Pyongyang rally, and by Pak
 Song-chol at the Peking rally.  Peking's NCNA duly reported
 these references in carrying the texts of the Korean items.
 MOSCOW GIVES ANNIVERSARY ROUTINE TREAT1ENT
 Moscow gave no special attention to the 20th anniversary of
 the Korean War, treating it--like the 15th and the 10th--
 much as it treats the routine annual ones.  The Moscow city
 rally was addressed by the chairman of the USSR-DPRK
 Friendship Society; the speakers on the 15th and .10th

 anniversaries had been officials of the Soviet Afro-Asian
 Solidarity Committee.  The meeting was also addressed this
 year by the visiting deputy chairman of the counterpart
 Korean friendship society.  Other features of the Moscow
 observance included the customary routine-level press and
 radio commentaries, a message from the AUCCTU to its
 North Korean counterpart, and a report that the DPRK
 Ambassador had a "meeting" with various Soviet representa-
 tives.  TASS briefly reported the rally held in Pyongyang
 on the anniversary, but did not mention the presence of
 foreign delegations.
 Moscow's propaganda routinely denounced U.S. "war prepara-
 tions" and "provocations" in Korea and expressed support
 for the North Korean demand that U.S. troops withdraw
 from South Korea and for its program for "peaceful"
 unification.  Unlike Peking, Moscow repeatedly expressed
 support for the DPRK Government memoran'1um and the
 program for unification outlined in it.
 Emphasizing Soviet-Korean friendship, Moscow routinely
 recalled that the Soviets gave the Koreans aid during
 the. war and in the "construction of socialism" since then.
 Pointing to the "successful development" of relations
 between the two countries' armies, a 25 June RED STAR
 article recalled that a Soviet military delegation led
 by Chief of General Staff Zakharov had visited the DPRK
 in April and that a DPRK military delegation led by Chief of
 the General Staff 0 Chin-u had attended the celebrations
 in the Soviet Union of the 9 May 25th anniversary of
 VE-Day.
 The chairman of the USSR-DPR;C Friendship Society commented
 in a radio talk on 25 June that the "fraternal alliance"
 of the two countries had been further cemented by the
 Soviet-DPRK treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual
 assistance.  On at least the last two Korean War
 anniversaries, Moscow had mentioned the treaty in
 similar fashion in press comment.  The anniversary
 of the signing of the treaty, 6 July, has been observed
 annually by Moscow, and the treaty has been cited in
 other Soviet propaganda from time to time over the years.

 RECOLLECTION OF UNITED ACTION BY DPRK, USSR, PRC
 An attack on the Chinese appeared over Moscow's Radio Peace
 and Progress in a 27 June commentary on the anniversary in
 Mandarin.  The broadcast, recalled for Chinese listeners that
 the "united action of the Korean, Soviet, and Chinese peoples"
 had been "very effective" against the U.S. "aggression" in
 Korea and declared that if the Chinese leaders were now to
 stop their "splittist activities" and respond "to the call
 of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries concerning
 the formation of a united front" against imperialism and
 reaction, the struggles of the Koreans and other peoples for
 independence and freedom would be.more effective.
