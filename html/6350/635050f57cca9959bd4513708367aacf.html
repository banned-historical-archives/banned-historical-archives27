 For 18 months, the top of China's power structure-an inner circle of
 seven-has presented a virtually unchangi:-lig public face. This outward sta-
 bility has persisted despite violent social upheaval, bloody factional fighting,
 several reversals of national policy, and the political destruction of half a
 dozen men in the second echelon of the leadership. The official voices of the
 regime have consciously portrayed the seven as a unified team. They have
 appeared on the same platforms, mouthed many of the same propaganda
 cliches, and have been careful in public to take consonant actions ever since
 January 1967.
 Appearances, nevertheless, are misleading. The current inner circle is
 not the loyal phalanx of Mao's lieutenants that was projected to the outside
 world in the regime's first 16 years. The members of today's power center
 are a disparate group, not natural or congenial allies.
 Given the severe internal strains that have developed in China, it does
 not appear probable that the top leadership will be able to maintain its
 facade of unity. A new purge may be near, and this time it might reach into
 the inner circle.

 Divisive Elements
 The present group of leaders
 developed during the purge of
 party stalwarts--Liu Shao-chi,
 Teng Hsiao-ping, Peng Chen, and
 Tao Chu--which shook the previous
 politburo standing committee to
 its foundations in 1966.   Besides
 Mao,  the inner circle now in-
 cludes Defense Minister Lin Piao,
 the durable Premier Chou En-lai,
 party theoretician Chen Po-ta,
 secret police specialist Kang
 Sheng, economic planner Li Fu-chun,
 and Mao's wife, Chiang Ching.
 Chou and Lin, the only sur-
 vivors of the pre-1966 standing
 committee besides Mao, had for
 years been part of Mao's inner
 councils, which had changed but
 little from 1945 to 1965.   Li Fu-
 chun was promoted to the standing
 committee from the rank of full
 member of the politburo at the
 11th plenum in 1966.   Chen Po-ta
 and Kang Sheng had been only al-
 ternate politburo members before
 then.   Chiang Ching was brought
 out of almost total obscurity to
 take a prominent position at her
 husband's side.
 It has frequently been diffi-
 cult to judge where each of these
 individual leaders has stood and
 to discover the degree to which
 each has concurred or dissented
 with regard to the main thrusts
 CURRENT LEADERSHIP ELITE IN CHINA
 The first seven form the inner circle, which has not varied since January 1967. The next seven
 assumed their present status after the last purge in March 1968, and Wen was added in August 1968.
 These additional officials appear with the inner circle at all important public functions and
 presumably also carry considerable influence in the inner councils.

 of the Cultural Revolution.   It is
 apparent from an abundance of indi-
 rect evidence, however, that a
 fundamental division exists at the
 ultimate center of power.   This
 seven-headed team is, in fact, a
 volatile combination of individ-
 uals--with conflicting personal
 ambitions and differing policy
 stands--which can be expected to
 disintegrate if the strains of the
 Cultural Revolution become suffi-
 ciently powerful.
 Although the official propa-
 ganda media have been fairly
 opaque regarding divergent atti-
 tudes among the protagonists,
 the less-restrained Red Guard
 press has reprinted speeches and
 pronouncements that tend to d-f--
 ferentiate the individuals and
 their basic orientations.   In
 some cases, animosities have shown
 through.
 Much more revealing of the
 antagonisms at the center, how-
 ever, have been the key policy
 shifts and the related fortunes
 of different sets of individuals
 in the second echelon of the hi-
 erarchy,   Although not in the same
 profusion as during the 1966
 purges, the Cultural Revolution
 has continued to spew lesser of-
 ficials into political oblivion.
 These new victims have been
 closely identified with one or
 another faction in the hierarchy,
 and their respective fortunes have
 reflected the inner tensions and
 provide a measure of the shifting
 political influence of these fac-
 tions.
 The ups and downs of the con-
 tending forces in the Cultural Rev-
 Page  3
 olution over the last 18 months
 throw some light on the semicon-
 cealed struggle at the center.
 Although most of the action on
 stage necessarily revolves around
 secondary figures, it tends to
 show what the principals were up
 to behind the scenes.
 To Western observers, there
 have been four clearly demarcated
 phases in the Cultural Revolution
 since the Red Guard convulsions of
 1966 dismantled the party appara-
 tus:                                                                    (1) the radical attack on
 the bureaucratic establishment
 in the government and army, March
 to August 1967;  (2)  the moderate
 ascendancy, August 1967 to March
 .1968;  (3) the radical resurgence,
 March to June 1968; and (4)  the
 turn to the right, July 1968 to
 the present.   Each of these was
 ushered in by a shift in the
 propaganda line, and each but the
 most recent involved political
 attacks on a particular group of
 secondary officials.
 The Radical Attack, March-
 August 1967
 During the first of these
 periods, the radicals in the
 leadership mounted a major cam-
 petign against officials in au-
 thority, primarily in government
 and the military, who were ob-
 structing or stalling the momen-
 tum of the Cultural Revolution
 out of a basic interest in eco-
 nomic stability, the status quo,
 and their own political survival.
 Ultimately, this radical campaign
 aborted, but only after it had
 caused enormous damage to the
 country's economic, social, and
 political fabric, and had caused

 He has not uttered a sentence in public for years,
 but brief, delphic "instructions" are issued periodically in his name
 which are often used to their own advantage by opposing
 political forces. Alone of all important leaders, Mao, despite his
 declining abilities, has retained his charisma and has remained
 immune from direct public criticism throughout the Cultural
 Revolution.
 Vice Chairman Lin Piao, who has led China's army since
 1959, was catapulted into the role of crown prince to Mao when
 the previous heir-designate Liu Shao-chi was toppled in disgrace
 in 1966. Propelled to the seat of authority by his command of the
 major instrument of political power in China, Lin may have lost
 the allegiance of many old-line military commanders by espousing
 the disruptive extremes of Mao's Cultural Revolution. The political
 disgrace in March 1968 of his protege--acting chief of staff Yang--
 cannot fail to have tarnished his own image, and there were
 some tentative indications during the summer that his position
 might be weakening.
 Premier Chou En-lai has been the chief proponent of social
 order, stability, national security, and a productive economy,
 striving desperately at times to hold together a large enough
 coalition of vested pressure groups to challenge or modify the
 more extreme drives of the Cultural Revolution. This role has
 come naturally for the man who has been responsible for so many
 years for administering China's vast governmental bureaucracy.
 Chou's instinct for self-preservation and political compromise,
 however, has kept him silent at critical points during the Cultural
 Revolution.

 Kang Shang, the sinister, xenophobic former chief of the
 secret police, has been "adviser" to the Cultural Revolution group
 from its inception. This title and his extreme public and private
 statements paint Kang as one of. the prime movers behind the
 destructive radical impulses of the Cultural Revolution.
 The shadowy Chen Po-ta, longtime ghostwriter, propagandist,
 and ideologue for Mao, has been chief of the Cultural Revolution
 Group since its formation in the fall of 1966. Deriving his
 political stature solely from close association with Mao, Chen
 has generally been found on the radical side of controversies at
 the center.
 The sixth member of the Politburo Standing Committee,
 Li Fu-chun, has played only a limited role in the Cultural
 Revolution. He has appeared to be mainly symbolic of the
 bureacratic administrators whose pragmatic views have been given
 voice by Chou En-lai.
 Last but not least, Mao's wife Chiang Ching, though not
 a formal member of the Politburo Standing Committee (and not
 even a central committee member), has exercised the influence of
 that rank as a leader of the CRG and the most vocal spokesman
 for the militants.

 Mao to doubt the reliability of
 the army.
 The overt evidence of this
 campaign is found largely in the
 posters and demonstrations of
 militant Red Guards, who in Jan-
 uary 1967 turned their ire on
 two groups of leaders, mostly at
 the secondary level, both asso-
 ciated with the moderate end of
 the spectrum.   One of these groups
 consisted of the minister of
 petroleum and five vice premiers
 more or less consistently identi-
 fied with the pragmatic policies
 championed by Chou En-lai:   Li
 Fu-chun, Foreign Minister Chen
 Yi, Finance Minister Li Hsien-
 nien, agricultural specialist
 Tan Chen-lin, and national po-
 lice chief Hsieh Fu-chih.                   The
 second group was primarily mili-
 tary:  Hsu Hsiang-chien and Yeh
 Chien-ying--both old army heroes
 and members of the Military Af-
 fairs Committee--and the head of
 the state's scientific and tech-
 nical program, Nieh Jung-chen,
 who also is a member of the Mili-
 tary Affairs Committee and a vice
 premier.   Fragmentary evidence
 suggests
 that these attacks were orches-
 trated and at least partially
 supervised by the radical leaders
 in the inner circle  Chiang Ching,
 Kang Sheng, and Chen Po-ta.
 Chou responded to both ini-
 tiatives with a strong public
 defense of the men involved,
 probably risking his own politi-
 cal standing to some degree in
 the process.   As a result, Li
 Fu-chun and Hsieh Fu-chih escaped
 from the ordeal unscathed, and
 attacks on the others abated.
 In May, they began again, those
 against Foreign Minister Chen Yi
 and agricultural specialist Tan
 Chen-lin becoming particularly vir-
 ulent.   This thrust by the Red Guards
 ended abruptly early in Septem-
 ber 1967.   Chou was apparently
 not in a strong enough position
 in the spring and early summer to
 be as forthright in their defense,
 and the Red Guards' targets grad-
 ually became less active in pub-
 lic, appearing mostly for cere-
 monial occasions.   Some were re-
 moved or suspended from their
 posts.  Tan Chen-lin fell in dis-
 grace during the summer.   This
 appeared to be a major blow to
 Chou, who was clearly on the de-
 fensive at this time.
 Propaganda of last fall and
 winter blamed the attacks of early
 1967 against government and army
 officials on "ultraleftist" ex-
 tremists--the May 16 Corps.   Spe-
 cifically, these leftists, led by
 members of the powerful Cultural
 Revolution Group, were accused of
 pressing a long-range plan to strike
 at Premier Chou's subordinates and
 allies and, ultimately, to bring'
 down Chou himself.
 Later on, at the time of
 the disgrace of acting chief of
 staff Yang Cheng-wu in March 1968,
 propagandists in league with the
 Cultural Revolution Group identi-
 fied the period of February-Mardh
 1967 as the "third wave" _of the
 Cultural Revolution.  They in-
 dicted Tan Chen-lin--the only
 target of the period they were
 able to bring down--as the master-
 .mind behind the so-called "Febru-
 ary adverse current of reversing
 current decision," i.e., a pur
 !ported attempt to get earlier
 Ipurge victims reinstated.   Tan,

 however, was the politburo's only
 total casualty from the period,
 and the leftist treatment of his
 political demise suggests that
 the radicals considered the abor-
 tive campaign a major piece of un-
 finished business.
 The Turn to Moderation,
 September 1967
 The most distinct switch in
 regime policies and in the for-
 tunes of secondary officials of
 the Cultural Revolution occurred
 during the moderate ascendancy
 last fall.   Directives against
 revolutionary violence and in
 support of orderly economic ac-
 tivity--which had been publicly
 promoted for many months to no
 avail by Chou En-lai and members
 of his entourage such as national
 police chief Hsieh Fu-chih--were
 suddenly reiterated and enforced.

 PEKING'S OFFICIAL VERSION OF THE PHASES OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION
 In speeches on 24 and 27 March 1968, Lin Pis,o, Chen Po-ta, and others defined the "five
 waves"* of the Cultural Revolution and their key purgees, as listed below. These "waves" differ
 from the phases identified by US observers, but the list shows that Chinese spokesmen understand
 the political nature of these phases in terms not greatly different from ours. (Information in italics

 Li, Kuan Feng, and Mu Hsin--were
 disgraced in early September. All
 were certified radicals, and all
 were closely associated with Chen
 Po-ta, Kang Sheng, and Chiang
 Ching.
 Charges against the out-
 lawed anti-Chou group of extreme
 leftists, the May 16 Corps, be-
 came increasingly detailed and
 explicit over the next six months,
 naming all three as kingpins in
 the attempt to eradicate Chou's
 government bureaucrats and hint-
 ing darkly that a more important
 protector lurked untouched some-
 where in the hierarchy.  When a
 fourth Cultural Revolution Group
 member, Chi Pen-yu, was purged
 in January, he was immediately
 charged with the same crimes.
 At this time, when the radi-
 cal faction was suffering its
 first important casualties of
 the Cultural Revolution, the mod-
 erate targets of the preceding
 half-year were gradually being
 reinstated.   This process culmi-
 nated in the apparently full re-
 habilitation of Foreign Minister
 Chen Yi in November 1967 and the
 elevation of the relatively un-
 important Petroleum Minister Yu
 Chiu-li to the second rank of
 leaders in public appearances--
 no doubt as a symbol of the
 changed balance of forces among
 the top leaders of the regime.
 The removal of the four
 young radicals has since been of-
 ficially termed the "fourth wave"
 in the Cultural Revolution.  This
 period appears to have been one
 when the radical members of the
 inner circle were under some re-
 straint and Chou En-tai, his
 subordinates, and allied military
 leaders were in the ascendancy.
 Like other periods of retreat,
 this one was given Mao's full
 official endorsement, and was
 said to be part of his "great
 strategic plan" for rebuilding
 the party.  This retreat was short-
 lived, however, indicating that
 Mao viewed it with suspicion.
 Radical Resurgence,
 March 1968
 The "fifth wave" was pre-
 cipitated by behind-the-scenes
 struggles in Peking at some point
 between 8 and 24 March, when it
 was announced that acting Chief
 of Staff Yang Cheng-wu, the air
 force political commissar, and
 the Peking garrison commander
 had been removed,
 Although the ouster of Yang
 and associates must have been
 one of the major turning points
 in the Cultural Revolution, at

 which the fortunes of the main
 players took a sharp turn--this
 much is acknowledged by radical
 spokesmen--it is unclear who the
 culprits were working for and
 against.   All were Lin Piao ap-
 pointees, but Lin was seemingly
 unhurt by their sudden fall from
 grace.   Immediately after their
 political demise, however, lead-
 ing members of Chou's State Coun-
 cil again came under brief poster
 attack and remained out of sight
 for several weeks.
 Nevertheless, the two men
 brought in to replace the fallen
 military leaders, Huang Yung-sheng
 and Wen Yu-cheng, have even better
 credentials as "conservatives" than
 their predecessors.   Chou En-lai
 had backed Huang, then commander
 of the Canton Military Region,
 where Wen was his subordinate,
 against charges in 1967 by radi-
 cal Red Guards there that he was
 guilty of suppressing them.
 It would appear, therefore,
 that while the Cultural Revolu-
 tion took a sudden lurch to the
 left again in March, the result-
 ing situation was a stalemate be-
 tween the two main leadership
 factions.   Propaganda became
 notably more leftist and inflam-
 matory, and Red Guard violence
 in the provinces picked up once
 again.   Some of the lines of
 moderate policy were blocked,
 while others were sidetracked.
 At the same time, however, re-
 newed attacks on moderate fig-
 ures--except for those on Nieh
 Jung-chen, the head of the state's
 scientific and technical program--
 quickly died out without follow-
 through, and such moderate drives
 as the formation of provincial
 .revolutionary committees headed
 by old-line military and party
 :Figures moved ahead at a good pace   25X1
 through the end of May.

 In major ideological pro-
 nouncements, "workers" were au-
 thorized to take the lead in
 "everything."   In communist ter-
 minology, "working class" is a
 euphemism for whoever is exer-
 cising authority, and in this
 case meant the "conservative"
 provincial leadership that had
 fitfully been formed in late 1967
 and 1968, evidently with the
 backing of the more moderate ele-
 ments of the central leadership.
 Apparently, these pronouncements
 thus tolled the death knell for
 the Red Guard movement, an im-
 portant power base for leaders of
 the Cultural Revolution Group in
 Peking.  Another conservative mil-
 itary figure, the new deputy chief
 of staff and Peking garrison com-
 mander Wen Yu-cheng, began appear-
 ing with the elite list of 15 lead-
 ers on 11 August.
 In the face of this con-
 certed swing back to law and or-
 der, the inner circle continued
 to appear together as if nothing
 had changed.   After two years of
 the turmoil, however, there can
 be little doubt that this super-
 ficial unity masks a ferocious
 fight for dominance.   Strains of
 -that fight have nearly split the
 inner circle asunder at least
 twice in the past year, and many
 key lieutenants of both factions
 have fallen in the fray.   There
 can be no security at the pin-
 nacle of power in China today,
 save perhaps for Mao himself.   A
 new, ruthless purge would seem to
 be near and this time it might
 reach into the inner circle.
