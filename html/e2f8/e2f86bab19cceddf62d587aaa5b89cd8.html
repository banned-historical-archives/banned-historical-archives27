 China's Experiment With
 Democracy: The First
 Step on a Long March?~
 Key Judgments       As part of its efforts to reform social, political, and economic life in China,
 the Chinese Government has undertaken a major experiment in local
 democracy over the past two years. This experiment  which involves direct
 elections of county-level representatives  has the long-term goal of estab-
 lishing meaningful legislative institutions. It is intended to achieve several
 related objectives:
 ? Enhance the popularity of a political system that is seen to have lost the
 confidence of many.
 ? Strengthen government institutions.
 ? Develop a more balanced relationship between the Communist Party and
 government bodies at various levels.
 ? Curb abuses of power by party and government officials by providing a
 suitable vehicle for mass criticism and suggestions.
 The ultimate goal is the development of a more stable political system.
 The elections have progressed slowly and are only now being completed.
 They have been beset by the inevitable administrative difficulties in
 carrying out the first nationwide elections in almost 20 years, by antire-
 gime dissidence, and by the obstruction of local officials attempting to
 maintain their own positions.
 Universities and colleges throughout the country have reacted to the
 elections with vigorous political campaigning, which has occasionally
 resulted in the election of dissident anti-Marxist students. although an
 irritant to the top party leadership, the reported 60 or so such student
 delegates do not pose a significant problem for the regime even at the local
 level. Thus, party leaders are unlikely to remove them from their positions;
 pressure and manipulation will be used in preference to formal sanctions.
 Obstruction of the election process by local officials appears to have been
 widespread and suggests the depth of opposition likely to be encountered in
 efforts to make China's legislatures--known as people's congresses --
 something more than the rubberstamp organizations they have been in the
 past.
 The completion of election work this year will provide the starting point for
 further measures to enhance the political significance of the elected
 legislative bodies. The impulse for further democratic reform still exists
 among the Chinese leadership, which reportedly has discussed substantial
 restructuring of the National People's Congress and the possibility of

 holding direct elections for the premiership. The people's congresses arc
 now being urged to exercise their newly granted rights to review and
 criticize government budgets and programs.
 Despite current leadership interest, the long-term prospects for democratic
 reform are highly uncertain. Opposition by local officials is likely to
 increase in proportion to the impact of those reforms on their functions and
 status. Further, the Chinese leadership itself is uncertain about how to
 provide the proper balance between democracy and party control. In these
 circumstances, the moves to implant an element of democracy in Chinese
 political life may become subordinated over the longer term to other
 elements of the ambitious reform program.

 Secret
 C'hina's Experiment With
 Democracy: The First
 Step on a Long March?
 The Dilemma of Party Control
 The high degree of control by the Chinese Communist
 Party over political, social, and economic life in China
 has presented the party leadership with a continuing
 dilemma since 1949: how to maintain a sufficient
 degree of control without engendering inefficiency,
 bureaucratization, and popular disaffection. Decen-
 tralization of economic decisionmaking, relaxation of
 controls over intellectual life, the renewed emphasis
 on academic excellence in the educational system, and
 other reforms introduced in recent years under the
 tutelage of Deng Xiaoping have helped define a more
 balanced role for the party
 In the government, this problem is being attacked
 with a series of reforms intended to enhance the status
 of government-  as opposed to party         institutions.
 Under the rubric of "socialist democracy," these
 reforms have the long-term goal of establishing na-
 tional and local legislatures that play an effective role
 in government--with general guidance provided by
 the Communist Party. Direct elections to county-level
 legislatures are the first step in this reform.
 The motivations of the Chinese leadership in imple-
 menting democratic reforms are several. One strong
 motivation is the memory of the Cultural Revolution.
 The Gang of Four was able to rise to prominence in
 part because of the lack of multiple power centers on
 the Chinese political scene. Backed by Mao Zedong's
 authority, .Bang Qing, Mao's wife, and her colleagues
 were subject to few institutional constraints. By devel-
 oping and strengthening a variety of political institu-
 tions, the Chinese leaders hope to prevent another
 Cultural Revolution-a period that they regard as
 synonymous with political instability.
 A second important motivation derives from the lead-
 ership's pessimistic assessment of popular attitudes
 toward the Communist Party. The party's prestige in
 the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution and the
 ravages of the Gang of Four is low. Because popular
 expectations about economic growth are unlikely to be
 met in the next year or two of retrenchment, they are
 particularly sensitive to the need to develop the
 popular support that is necessary for long-term eco-
 nomic success.    25X1
 The Chinese Communist Party is also attempting to
 revive some of the revolutionary traditions developed
 in Yenan during the late 1930s and early 1940x.
 These traditions emphasize the need for the party to
 heed the advice of the people-including criticism of
 specific individuals and policies. The problem has
 been to find ways to solicit popular participation in
 controlling abuses by officials without surrendering
 the party's central political role. China's legisla-
 tures-known as people's congresses  are intended to
 serve as ombudsmen for citizen grievances. One func-
 tion of direct elections, even though they are conduct-
 ed only at the local level, is to provide an external
 check on officials performance
 In conjunction with other Dengist reforms, the infu-
 sion of a measure of democracy into Chinese political
 life is intended to enhance government authority. The
 vision behind these reforms is the creation of a more
 balanced political process in which sectors of Chinese
 society other than the Communist Party also play a
 role. By allowing a greater degree of popular initiative
 and granting more autonomy to government institu-
 tions, the Chinese leadership hopes to create a more
 stable political system in the future.
 The Electoral Laws
 [n July 1979 the National People's Congress (N PC)
 adopted several amendments to the Chinese constitu-
 tion that were intended to strengthen "socialist de-
 mocracy" in China. These amendments mandated
 that:
 ? Standing committees be established as permanent
 representatives of people's congresses at the county
 level and above.
 ? Revolutionary committees-  a Cultural Revolution
 creation-be replaced by people's governments.
 ? Deputies to the county-level people's congresses be
 elected directly by the voters   Zj)(~

 Approved For Release 2008/08/07 :CIA-RDP03T02547R000100080001-3
 Legislative bodies at higher levels  the national and
 provincial people's congresses  continue to be chosen
 by the lower people's congresses. The intent of these
 amendments is to introduce a limited degree of
 popular participation into the political process while
 at the same time strengthening the role of government
 institutions. The people's congresses, in particular,
 were given an expanded role that included appoint-
 ment of government officials and review of govern-
 ment programs and budgets
 The laws and procedures for electing representatives
 for county-level people's congresses allow for a degree
 of popular initiative without sacrificing local-level
 party control. Any individual can become a candidate
 if he is nominated by another person and seconded by
 three others. Local organizations, including the Com-
 munist Party, have the right to forward nominees.
 Since this nomination process can produce a large
 number of candidates, the law provides that the list of
 candidates be winnowed down to a final list through a
 process of repeated consultations and deliberations
 with local organizations or through primary elections.
 The exact nature of these consultations is not pre-
 scribed, but they result in quotas to ensure that
 women and significant ethnic minorities are repre-
 sented and that the proper mix of occupational and
 political groups is obtained. Primary elections seem to
 have been infrequently used  principally at colleges
 and universities  perhaps because of the reluctance
 of local officials to surrender control of the nomina-
 tion process
 In a departure from past practice, the election rules
 stipulate that the final list of candidates should exceed
 the number of positions available by 50 to 100
 percent. This has been hailed in the Chinese media as
 a great advance in "socialist democracy" as the voters
 have a real choice. Inasmuch as many candidates
 compete within a voting unit for several seats, there is
 the possibility of genuine competition between candi-
 dates for voter support. But the limited publicity
 allowed candidates seems to have made it difficult for
 voters to make meaningful choices among the differ-
 ent candidates
 The laws stipulate that voting is by secret ballot. In
 their efforts to maximize voter participation, however,
 election officials provide substantial opportunity for

 voters to submit absentee or proxy votes. Election
 officials have also been known to bring the ballot
 boxes to individual homes. Where this occurs, the
 integrity of the secret ballot is obviously suspect.
 Election Progress and Problems
 Implementation of election work has proceeded in
 several distinct stages. In the first stage-the second
 half of 1979 and the firs: half of 1980 -elections were
 held in selected test areas throughout the country
 (figure 1). Very few elections were held during 1979,
 but 17 percent of the counties and county-level dis-
 tricts within China had conducted elections by Junc
 1980. The experience gained was then applied in the
 second stage that constituted the major push to
 complete election work. During this period, from July
 1980 to approximately March 1981, an estimated 6(,
 percent of the county-level units conducted elections.
 The final stage, which is continuing, is devoted to
 finishing up election work by the end of 1981.
 25X1 '
 The lengthy period for completion of election work
 was necessitated in part by the sheer magnitude of the
 task. Election committees had to be urganized in each   25X1
 locality, voters registered, and lengthy lists of candi-
 dates reduced in order for elections to occur. Since
 elections had not been held in China in almost two
 decades, each of these tasks required a substantial

 Approved For Release 2008/08/07 :CIA-RDP03T02547R000100080001-3
 propaganda effort to explain the election process and
 its significance. The lengthy period for conducting
 experimental election work indicates that the Chinese
 leadership had a realistic appreciation of the size of
 25X1        the task.
 The substantial lag in completing elections was also
 increased by several unforeseen occurrences. Severe
 weather conditions seem to have had significant ef-
 fects in certain areas. Flooding in Hubei apparently
 delayed the beginning of election work there, and the
 severe drought in Hebei seems to have been responsi-
 ble for the limited progress of election work in that
 province. Elections in the autonomous regions     prin-
 cipally Xizang-were delayed considerably by
 changes in minority nationality policy that were intro-
 duced in 1980. Elections were stopped for a while to
 allow for greater minority representation in the elec-
 tion process.
 But the more than two years required to complete the
 elections cannot be explained solely in terms of ad-
 ministrative difficulties. Progress in election work has
 also been hampered by political challenges of two very
 different sorts. Elections at China's colleges and
 universities have often been freewheeling affairs in
 which dissident students have attacked the Commu-
 nist Party's control  either on campus or national
 issues. And local officials throughout China have
 manipulated the election process through a variety of
 measures         including juggling candidate lists, gerry-
 mandering electoral district boundaries, and falsifying
 25X1        election results.
 The student dissidence stimulated in part by the
 electoral campaigns has been highly visible and clear-
 ly an affront to the Chinese leadership. Dissident
 activities in response to the elections were reported at
 colleges and universities in at least six of China's 29
 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions;
 student elections were postponed in at least one other.
 Events such as the election boycott at Hunan Normal
 College in the fall of 1980 have attracted high-level
 attention. Dissidence at Beijing University reportedly
 provoked Hu Qiaomu, a member of the party secre-
 tariat, to proclaim that it was "stupid to have a
 25X1      dictatorship and not use it.'
 Yet the reported 60 or so dissident county-level
 representatives do not pose a serious challenge to the
 regime. They constitute only a small proportion of the
 county-level people's congress members, with little
 opportunity to influence policy at even the local Icvcl.
 The high-level attention given to this problem stems
 primarily from the perception that the current elec-
 toral reform is creating demands among intellectuals
 for Western-style democracy. The Chinese media
 have gone to considerable lengths in recent months to
 persuade intellectuals and others that China is not
 about to abandon party rule in favor of competitive
 democracy.        25X1
 Despite the evident irritation of the party's top-level
 leaders, their practical response has been limited.
 Local officials are apparently encouraged to limit the
 number of successful dissident candidates by postpon-
 ing elections until more favorable times, making
 special efforts to recruit particularly well-qualified
 candidates to run against the dissidents, and mobiliz-
 ing the party's propaganda resources. Dissident candi-
 dates are also criticized for anti-Marxist statements.
 Nonetheless, more heavyhanded measures that
 threaten the integrity of the election process do not
 seem to be encouraged, and it is unlikely that success-
 ful dissident candidates will be deprived of their
 positions.
 Opposition to direct elections by local officials seems
 to have been a more widespread and serious problem.
 Violations of electoral laws by local officials have
 been reported in at least nine of China's 29 provinces,
 municipalities, and autonomous regions. From avail-
 able evidence, it is difficult to know how severe these
 violations have been. Yet in some provinces-for
 example, Guangdong and Yunnan-the violations
 were serious enough to delay the progress of the
 elections.    25X1
 These violations indicate the high degree of opposition
 by local officials to efforts to introduce even a limited
 measure of electoral democracy. This opposition
 seems particularly surprising in light of statistics on
 election outcomes in selected areas of China that
 suggest that, outside of the universities, the elections
 were well-controlled affairs (table 1). Voter turnout

 was generally reported to be in the 95-percent range,
 about 9 percent higher than in the 1950s. Moreover,
 there seem to have been few surprises in the election
 results. About two-thirds of the winning candidates
 were Communist Party members. Ethnic minorities,
 peasants, and workers seem to be well represented,
 although the proportion of women does not reFlect the
 population. On occasion, officials have been defeated
 in these elections, but that appears to have been the
 exception rather than the rule.
 The combination of predictable administrative delays,
 unforeseen circumstances, and political conflict meant
 that progress in election work in different areas of the
 country was very uneven (figure 2). In general, the
 earliest regions to complete elections were the munici-
 palities directly under national control  Beijing,
 Shanghai, and Tianjin-and the more industrialized
 areas of the northeast (for example, Jilin, Heilong-
 jiang). Progress in election work generally was slower
 in the provinces and autonomous regions of the interi-
 or. This pattern suggests that differences in levels of
 social and economic development  as well as political
 factors-were important determinants of election
 Whither Democratic Reform?
 The completion of direct county-level elections this
 year will provide the starting point for further meas-
 ures to enhance the political significance of the
 elected legislative bodies. Currently the local and
 provincial people's congresses are being encouraged to
 play a more active role. People's congresses at the
 provincial, municipality, and autonomous region
 levels are gingerly attempting to exercise their nom-
 inal right to appoint government officials, review
 government budgets, and approve economic plans.   25X1
 The impulse for further democratic reform still exists
 among China's top leaders. They are reported to be
 weighing a proposal by Zhang Youyu, Vice President
 of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, to insti-
 tute anational bicameral legislature-with an upper
 house of provincial representatives and a lower house

 The efforts to enhance the role and status of China's
 legislative and other government institutions seem less
 likely than economic or party reforms to fall prey to
 factional disputes within the Chinese leadership. At
 one time or another over the past two years, Chinese
 leaders of generally differing views on reform-in-
 cluding Deng Xiaoping, Zhao 7_iyang, Ye Jianying,
 Hua Guofeng, and Peng Zhen  have endorsed the
 need for a more democratic political life.
 Nonetheless, the prospects for future democratic re-
 form are highly uncertain. Although local and provin-
 cial people's congresses are becoming more active, the
 role that they play is severely limited. They meet
 infrequently-generally only once ayear-for periods
 of about a week. The number of delegates is too large
 to permit effective legislative review even if there
 were more time. At the provincial level, the number of
 people's congress representatives ranges from about
 500 to more than 1,000-with little permanent staff
 support. The standing committees of the people's
 congresses are generally composed of officials with
 other high-level assignments, making it unlikely that
 their legislative work is given top priority. Thus, basic
 reforms in the current system of people's congresses
 are necessary if these bodies are to be more than
 rubberstamp organizations.
 The widespread violations of election laws during the
 current round of elections mean that steps to enhance
 the political authority of the legislatures will face
 strong opposition at the local level. The reforms to
 date have been politically innocuous in terms of the
 threat to party control, and they have been endorsed
 by the central party leadership, but they still have
 aroused significant resistance at the local level.
 participation without engendering the excesses that
 they attribute to Western-style democratic  ractices
 or endangering Communist Party control. 25X1
 Despite top leadership interests in democratic reform,
 the question of reform priorities is likely to be impor-
 tant over the longer term. Given the ambitious set of
 reforms that the Chinese leadership has embarked
 upon, it is unlikely that all of the reforms can be
 pushed over the next few years. Democratic reform
 may be slighted in favor of more pressing reforms in
 the economic arena.
 Chinese leaders and their supporting intellectual es-
 tablishment are uncertain about the appropriate di-
 rection for future reform. The "socialist democracy"
 reforms along with other liberalization measures--
 sueh as the loosening of restrictions in the arts-have
 created expectations of the future installation of
 "bourgeois democracy" that the regime is now trying
 to dampen. The problem-as they see it-is to chart a
 uniquely Chinese path to "socialist democracy." The
 goal is to create a set of institutions that allow popular

 mittee was still monitoring the progress of election
 work in May.
 The problems apparently were political rather than
 administrative. Students at the University of Science
 and Technology reportedly founded a dissident jour-
 nal in January 1981 that was critical of Communist
 Party interference in local elections. The third session
 of the fifth Anhui provincial people's congress urged
 greater leadership over direct county-level elections
 and more inspection work-an indication that manip-
 25X1      ulation of the election process by local officials was a
 significant problem.
 Belling Municipality
 Election work in Beijing progressed smoothly, with
 the exception of dissident campaigning at the local
 universities. Two of Beijing's 19 county-level units
 had carried out election work by early August 1980;
 the last of the elections was held on 15 January 1981.
 Election campaigns in Beijing were for the most part
 unexciting. Candidates campaigned on the basis of
 their contributions to China's modernization, local-
 level grievances on such issues as housing and infla-
 tion, and the need for greater controls of abuses by
 high-level officials. At Beijing, Qinghua, and Chinese
 People's Universities, however, student candidates
 raised fundamental questions about the Chinese po-
 litical system  -for example, the relative priority of
 democracy versus economic development and th;, role
 A report on election work was given to the standing
 committee of the Fujian people's congress in March
 1981. By that time, direct elections had been held
 throughout the province, and all the county-level units
 but one had elected standing committees and people's
 governments.        25X1
 Gansu Province
 Election work in Gansu lagged somewhat behind
 national norms in the beginning. As of July 1980
 election work had been carried out on an experimental
 basis in an estimated I 1 percent of the county-level
 units in Gansu. The detailed rules and regulations on
 election work were not reviewed by the standing
 committee of the provincial people's congress until
 late September. At this point, intensive election work
 must have been carried out because it was reported in
 March that election work had been conducted in
 approximately 74 percent of the province's counties
 and districts. Despite this progress, Chen Zihua iden-
 tified Gansu as one of the provinces in which election
 work had lagged.                 25)(1
 Guangdong Province
 Although Guangdong was not singled out in Chen
 Zihua's NPC report as one of the provinces in which
 there were significant problems, election work was
 plagued by difficulties. As early as May 1980 special
 committees inspecting election work were calling at-
 tention to the fact that in "some places" there was
 inadequate preparation as well as violations of the
 election laws.          25X1

 By the end of 1979 elections had been carried out in
 three of Guangdung's county-level units. Efforts to
 make substantial prugress in the first half of 1980
 were Icss than successful, and by September election
 work was reported to have been launched in only 64
 percent of the counties.
 Guangxi Autonomous Region
 Experimental election work was carried out in Nan-
 ning municipality in May 1980. By February 1981
 election work seems to have been completed, with
 most of the county-level units having held people's
 election work in early July. County-level elections in
 the province were completed in October, well in
 advance of the planned yearend completion date.~~ 25X1
 Henan Province
 Henan was identified in Chen Iihua's report to the   25X1
 county-level elections in that month. There is no
 indication of the reasons for the lack of prugress

 Hubei Province
 Flooding probably slowed the early progress of elec-
 tion work in Hubei. In late September 1980 the
 provincial people's congress standing committee heard
 reports on election work. At that time election work
 had been launched in one-third of the county-level
 units, below the national rate. Election work in Hubei
 after September must have been substantial, as it was

 congresses with no reported problems.
 Guizhou Province
 In a meeting in July 1980 the Guizhou provincial
 people's congress heard a report from the election
 committee. Since that time, no further reports on
 election work have been issued.
 Hebei Province
 Planning for election work was significantly delayed
 probably because of the severe drought that affected
 Hebei. A planning conference on election work was
 not held until late September 1980. Hebei was identi-
 fied in the report made in March 1981 to the NPC as
 one of the provinces where significant election work
 remained. As of May elections had been completed in
 only an estimated 31 percent of the county-level units.
 At that time inadequacies in election work and elec-
 tion violations were reported.
 Heilongjiang Province
 Heilongjiang was a "model" province in the imple-
 mentation of election work. By the end of May 1980
 election work had been completed in the 17 desig-
 nated pilot units, with no reported election violations.
 The standing committee of the provincial people's
 congress approved trial rules and regulations for
 No elections, however, had been held at Hubei's
 institutes of higher education as of January 1981.
 This situation presumably reflected concern by pro-
 vincial officials about potential student dissidence.
 Hunan Province
 The standing committee of the Hunan people's con-
 gress heard an election report in early August 1980
 and directed that the elections should be completed
 during the second half of the year. Election activity
 was apparently heavy during the fall and winter. The
 provincial election commission was dissolved by the
 standing committee of the provincial people's congress
 in early April 1981 as the elections were largely
 completed.
 Elections at Hunan Normal College in Changsha,
 however, were the focus of intense controversy in
 October 1980. A dissident, non-Marxist student can-
 didate was removed from the electoral list, provoking
 student demonstrations and a boycott of the election.
 The authorities allowed the situation to settle down
 and held new elections in March 1981.

 Jiangsu Province
 Serious problems in election work were announced at
 a conference in late September 1980. Insufficient
 attention to election work and violations of election
 laws meant that elections had been completed in only
 13 percent of the counties and districts. Despite the
 fact that by the end of January 1981 elections had
 been conducted in 69 percent of the county-level
 units, Jiangsu was identified in Chen 7ihua's assess-
 ment for the NPC as a province in which significant
 work remained. By May election work had been
 conducted in all the county-level units, but was not
 expected to be fully completed until after July. The
 standing committee of the provincial people's congress
 was still reviewing election work in late June.~~
 Local officials stated that finding young technocrats
 to run in the elections had been difficult and that

 Nei Monggol Autonomous Region
 Nei Monggol was one of several autonomous regions
 that were identified in March 1981 as lagging in the
 implementation of election work. In the fall of 1980
 various election violations were reported. Thcsc viola-
 tions by local officials included failure to give ade-
 quate publicity to elections, failure to ensure that
 there were more candidates than seats, and willful
 disregard of election results. By January 1981 an
 estimated 80 percent of the county-level units had
 Jiangxi Province
 Jiangxi apparently did not make a major effort in
 election work until January 1981. "There is no evi-
 dence of significant progress but Jiangxi was not
 singled out in Chcn Lihua's report to the NPC as a
 deficient province.
 As elsewhere in China, student election campaigns
 provoked controversy. At Jiangxi Normal College, a
 student who expressed a preference for democracy
 over socialism and attacked Chinese intervention in
 Vietnam was one of the final candidates for acounty-
 level seat.
 Jilin Province
 The provincial electoral committee was formed in
 June 1980. Violations of electoral laws were reported
 in September for "some units." These violations in-
 cluded limiting the number of candidates for seats to
 a number fewer than specified by law and insufficient
 consultations with the masses on the selection of the
 final candidates. These violations were presumably
 rectified, as county-level elections were completed by
 the end of May 1981
 Liaoning Province
 The detailed rules and regulations on electoral work
 were approved by the standing committee of the
 provincial people's congress in July 1980. Although
 electoral law violations were reported in at least one
 county, elections had been carried out in 90 percent of
 the county-level units by the end of August.
 Ningxia Autonomous Region
 Election work got off to a slow start in Ningxia. Pilot
 elections were not begun until September 1980. nl-
 though the report made in March 1981 to the NPC
 did not single out the region as one in which signifi-
 cant work remained, the regional standing committee
 was still monitoring election progress in early May.
 25X1
 Qinghai Province
 No public reports on progress in election work were
 made in 1980. This presumably reflected a lack of
 progress in elections, as the standing committee of th~25X1
 provincial people's congress was still monitoring elec-
 tion progress in late May 1981.
 Shaanxi Province
 Elections were being held in Shaanxi in the fall of
 1980 with some election violations occurring. Em-
 bassy reporting indicated that less than 5 percent of
 the counties had completed their elections at that
 time. Election work must have continued at a slow
 pace, since the provincial standing committee heard a
 report on election work in June 1981.
 Shandong Province
 Election work in Shandong began early, with the
 standing committee of the provincial people's congress
 approving electoral rules and regulations in May 1980
 on the basis of previous testing in 21 county-level
 units. One-fourth of the counties and districts had

 completed their election work by October, and the
 rest were projected to be completed by the end of the
 year. According to statistics compiled in May 1981,
 direct elections had been completed in all but one of
 Shandong's county-level units.
 Shanghai Municipality
 Shanghai Municipality seems to have been one of the
 first areas of the country to complete its elections.
 Except for a few byelections, county and district
 elections were completed by the end of June. Fudan
 University in Shanghai was reportedly the focus of
 considerable dissident activity, with students cam-
 paigning on anti-Marxist platforms.
 Shanxi Province
 Chen Zihua in his report to the NPC identified
 Shanxi as one of the provinces in which election work
 had lagged. By March 1981 elections had been com-
 pleted in only 39 percent of the county-level units
 Students at Sichuan University were reported to have
 boycotted the election on campus because of party
 interference. As of March-April 1981, the provincial
 people's congress and the standing committee were
 still hearing reports on the conduct of the elections
 Tianjin Municipality
 Like the Beijing and Shanghai Municipalities, elec-
 tion work in Tianjin progressed very rapidly. Elections
 were completed by May 1980, making Tianjin the
 first area in the country to complete elections. ~   ~~
 Xigjiang Autonomous Region
 Preparations for election work were under way in
 April 1980, but implementation was halted in June.
 Only experimental election work in three county-level
 units had been carried out by December. The regional
 standing committee was still reviewing the progress of
 elections in April 1981, and a concern for preventing
 election law violations was expressed at that lime. Not
 until late June did the regional standing committee
 discuss and approve regulations fur the conduct of
 elections.
