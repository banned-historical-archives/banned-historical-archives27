 my education.  I'd rather work for civil  judged in a material sense.  He became the
 rights.  It's  more  exciting  and  it  means first Negro farmer to defy threats and offer
 more."                                    a campsite to the marchers.  His courage was
 Putting two and two together, one can
 easily see the backbone of a new revolution
 in Alabama     which    could  rout  Governor
 Wallace and many segregationists as soon as
 the next elections are held if the franchise is
 given the Negro.  There Is no turning back
 now and Alabama Negroes are ready to sacri-
 fice lives, property, and individual futures for
 the common cause.
 This Is a heartening development consider-
 ing the long years of apathy and compla-
 cency.  But it is a process fraught with dan-
 ger; whites in Alabama must decide the tools
 or weapons for the shaping of the future.
 If there is cooperation and teamwork, the
 change will be peaceful; if there is continued
 violence and hatred. there will be counter-
 attacks and a bloody confrontation.
 On the first day, the hypocrisy of the Ala-
 bama system was clear to every marcher:
 a hypocrisy fortified by Senators and Repre-
 sentatives  in  Washington  erupting  with
 charges of "communism" at every assault on
 their dynasty. Each day saw Alabama's Gov-
 ernor urging constituents to protect white
 supremacy and further divide the races, the
 State's police trying to weed out militants by
 excessive 'head rappings, its posses roving
 streets and roads at night to harass civil
 rights workers.  Here in a great Southern
 State of the world's greatest democracy, it
 took a vast army-helicopters in the air,
 mine demolition teams scouting ahead for
 dynamite, GI's posted 50 feet apart the full
 route, truckloads of troops at every intersec-
 tion, a 200-man Army force following the
 pilgrims, hundreds of FBI agents and Justice
 Department aids, thousands of the federal-
 ized Alabama National Guard, and the Pres-
 ident, himself to guarantee We travel for
 the nonviolent demonstration a mere span of.
 60 miles.
 In a nation that propagandizes democracy
 throughout the world, with soldiers snaking
 along the front in Vietnam, and shortwave
 radios dotting the globe, it was incongruous
 for many of the outside visitors to believe
 that the state of affairs had drifted to such
 brutality and bestiality in Alabama.  Such
 a revelation  plus  the  hardship  of travel
 brought anguish and pain to newcomer civil
 righters, causing a white minister to suffer
 a mental collapse.
 For the hazardous journey, it took a de-
 termined spirit and a sound body and mind
 to become an effective cog in the pilgrimage
 to the cradle of the Confederacy.  Only a
 small number of the 10,000 who joyously left
 Selma on "that great getting-up morning"
 had any ambitions of walking the 54 miles
 to Montgomery-except by auto after the
 first 8-mile stretch.  For one thing, the court
 order limited the number to 300 on the two-
 lane section of the highway.
 The first day's army was a motley col-
 lection-a California couple wheeling a baby,
 ladies in high-heeled shoes, barefoot college
 -students,  VIP's  from  across  the  country,
 maids and porters, clerics with sleeping bags
 and youngsters.   The atmosphere was mov-
 ing,  emotional-a ragged army                      tramping
 through a wasteland.
 By the time the line reached a railroad
 6 miles from Selma, where 1,000 were sup-
 posed to be entrained back, the passengers
 refused to drop out.  They wanted to reach
 the first camp, the farm of David Hall, a
 Negro father of eight who had survived the
 heartache of deciding whether to welcome
 the marchers and be harassed or turn them
 down.  His farm was less than prosperous
 and his livestock consisted of a small herd
 of cows, a few hundred chickens and four
 guinea hens.  His four-room house added
 little to the value of the 80 acres.  But
 Farmer  Hall's contribution  couldn't  be
 a selling point to other Negro farmers along
 the route.
 This spirit of militancy among Alabama
 Negroes was a key factor throughout the
 march.  The courage and drive inspired the
 whites  in  moments  of  greatest  despair.
 Recognizing   this  peculiar  circumstance,
 SCLC strategists devised a campaign plan
 which  focused attention on the Alabama
 natives as "the chosen few" of the march-
 the  ones who would walk the entire dis-
 tance-while                                                                                many  of  the  out-of-staters
 were  assigned to  housekeeping  chores  to
 keep the people's army on its feet as the pil-
 grimage snaked through one of the most
 barbaric sections of Alabama.
 Devotion of the whites to task of keeping
 army marching was exceptional.   California
 priests and ministers set up and dismantled
 the camp tents.  Whites manned the com-
 munication system, the security operations,
 the mess tents, the latrine trucks and even
 cleaned up the sites.  A Canadian professor,
 Sam  Farr,  helped clean  a  latrine  truck.
 Pittsburgh r'?stor Richard Bigeler passed out
 coffee in the breakfast line. Purnell Roberts
 (Adam of TV's Bonanza family) picked up
 litter around the tents.
 Against a backdrop of terror-inclement
 weather and dropouts from fatigue, the
 teamwork of whites and Negroes forged a
 unity that defied comparison in the bigoted
 State.   A subfreezing temperature  at the
 first stop disillusioned some and slowed down
 preparation of supper and nocturnal vespers.
 But with marchers shivering and hesitating
 to roll out sleeping bags, big Jim Orange,
 the song leader, hopped onto a truck and
 launched a singing session.  "Freedom" he
 shouted and hundreds huddling around fires
 to keep warm soon turned the campsite Into
 a singing, swaying mass of humanity.
 Obviously, survival under the adverse con-
 ditions (which forced accompanying GI's to
 gripe  about  hardships)  brought on  soul
 searching.   "Was this worth it?" many a
 marcher, Negro and white, asked himself. "I
 froze and you can quote me," boomed Rev.
 Richard Leonard, pastor of New York City's
 Community Church, the largest Unitarian
 congregation in the country, "But I found
 myself.  Suffering intensifies determination."
 Negro    TV  actor  William  Marshall,  who
 turned down contracts to participate, told
 reporters, "This is my State and the State
 of my friends.  We must bring it in line
 with the 20th century."  He admitted that
 he didn't sleep a wink on the first night, but
 as a security marshal, he tended to his job
 day after day.
 Shivering in the cold in a transient mili-
 tarized  ghetto  was one type of suffering.
 The intense Alabama sun was so broiling at
 times that medics had to apply sunburn
 lotion to faces-making some marchers look
 like zombies.  Driving rain frequently soaked
 freedom lovers to the skin and turned fields
 into oceans of mud so unfirm that tents
 could not be erected and there was no dry
 standing room.     The constant drain on food
 and water found some going hungry and
 thirsty for hours without relief.   At one
 time, the water rankled with kerosene from a
 tank car that had been used for other pur-
 poses and some of the people developed stom-
 ach disorders.  Suffering for the cause was
 the theme, the life, as feet blistered, legs
 and backs ached and faces burned with too
 heavy a dose of the sunshine of freedom.
 Because this type of existence was not the
 life of many of the middle class visitors, the
 survival etched a memory which could not
 easily be forgotten.  To endure meant com-
 mitment and involvement in a lifelong civil
 rights struggle.  At a camp breakfast, SCLC
 aid Andy Young summed up the predica-
 ment in explaining why the oatmeal was
 served without cream.  Said Young: "Folks
 down here make less than $2,000 a year and
 don't know what cream tastes like."
 Of the chosen few selected to tramp the
 entire distance,  five gleamed with almost
 heroic   brilliance.  Prosperous   Baltimore,
 Md., Physician Thomas C. Jones "woke up one
 morning" and decided he had a stake in the
 march.   Leaving five patients at a hospital
 in care of a colleague, he flew to Alabama
 and worked around the clock for a full week.
 Riding ambulances, walking, answering sick
 calls in camp at night, he became "The Doc"
 for  hundreds.  Why did  you  participate?
 "It was the toughest assignment I've ever
 handled." Dr. Jones replied, "But, golly, it was
 the most inspiring, too. More of us have to
 get involved."  Easygoing Judge King, a 20-
 year-old Marion, Ala., civil righter, walked
 a good bit with Mrs. Leah Washburn, a white
 Atlanta mother. They chatted, sang, and he
 carried her coat for spells. "I got new ideas
 about white people," he described the period.
 "Some are real nice. Now I feel like a man."
 Declaring that he traveled to Alabama and
 walked the entire distance, rather than be
 a "4-hour marcher," New York State race
 relations expert George Fowler hiked, ate
 the camp food, and bunked down in a sleep-
 ing bag alongside Alexander Aldridge, Gov.
 Nelson  Rockefeller's  cousin  and  aid  and
 former White House staffer Harris Wofford.
 Said Fowler: "This is an amazing experience.
 I'm convinced the movement should touch
 tine northern big cities and bring the pride
 to its people that this march has brought to
 these fine deprived people in Alabama.  It
 is  remarkable  and  I  have  grown, too."
 Arrested seven times in Selma for demonstrat-
 ing, 17-year-old Joe Boone was typical of
 Alabama's new breed.  Serving as a marshal
 for the highway trek, Boone went right to
 work when he arrived at campsite, heading
 a cleaning detail.  His enthusiasm and ex-
 ecutive ability were noted by pilgrims who
 could visualize the  great waste of  Negro
 talent. "My mother and father never thought
 this day would come," stated Boone, "but it's
 here and I want to do my part."    Perhaps
 the most apologetic pilgrim was 82-year-old
 Rager Lee, the grandfather of slain civil
 righter Jimmie Lee Jackson.  He walked only
 a few miles on the first day and had to quit
 with tears in his eyes.  He came back off and
 on to put in a few miles as a show of his
 interest.  "Just got to tramp some more,"
 he kept repeating.
 From the swamps of hate and despair, the
 pilgrims trudged nearer Montgomery.  The
 goal was in sight.  Cars stopped and pas-
 sengers ran across the strip of grass to join
 their freedom brothers.  Buses and trucks
 unloaded more.  Hundreds joined the line
 stretching it from 100 yards long to three
 miles of moving and singing pilgrims.  No
 longer was there the studied wave of Ne-
 groes-a flick of the hand or the nod of a
 head to avoid suspicions of whites.
 At the crossing into Montgomery, shouts,
 cheers and singing came from some 500 well-
 wishers who waited for hours at the city lim-
 its.  There were tears, big and bouncy, run-
 ning down cheeks.                                                                                                                                   There was arm waving,
 Including some whites.     Teachers and stu-
 dents rushed from buildings to urge on the
 marchers  and  some   even  embraced      and
 kissed    Dr.  King.  Cooks  ran  out    from
 pantries, leaving     patrons  with  standing
 orders.   In   windows  of  motels,  chamber-
 maids                                                                                                                                    waved  and  cried    with joy. While
 whites silently watched, the Negroes jumped
 for joy.  At intersections and along the way,
 crowds stood and joined in the singing.
 It was the day of freedom.      The weary had
 come home.
 From 50 States came supporters-all de-
 termined to make the last assault onto the
 American  fiagless  Alabama  State  capital.

 Pouring in by train, bus and plane, the
 backers continued to come.  At first, reports
 counted 10,000, then more and more. The
 city was packed tightly-in hotels, homes,
 and churches.
 Tomorrow would be better.
 Led by Drs. King and Bunche, and fea-
 turing the army of the new republic, the
 300 "chosen few" with red capes as a badge
 of honor, the last-lap march passed the Jef-
 ferson Davis Hotel where 9, huge Confederate
 flag stretched across the front, the Old Slave
 Square where many of their forefathers had
 been sold on the auction block, and up to
 the  State  Capitol.  The  front lines  had
 reached the Capitol and marchers were still
 leaving the City of St. Jude, stretching their
 might and power three miles across the city.
 The pilgrimage was the largest in city his-
 tory-50,000-and its interracial force was
 awesome to the tiny band of State lawmakers
 who gasped at the show of power.  More
 American flags were carried in the hands of
 the pilgrims than flew in Montgomery, and
 perhaps,  throughout Alabama.  "We Shall
 Overcome," the marchers, Negro and white,
 sang loud and clear in a beautiful blend of
 democracy.  During the historic program,
 two Negro maids listened from a window of
 the guarded State capitol and waved during
 the tremendous singing of the freedom an-
 them, causing some to marvel at the new
 courage of the Alabama Negro-no matter
 his age or job.  The new will to gain freedom
 spread throughout Montgomery, throughout
 Alabama, and had spread on to other South-
 ern States and even to the North,  Inspired
 by deaths of two civil rights figures, and
 harassed throughout by the fear of death,
 the Selma-to-Montgomery pilgrimage con-
 cluded also with two deaths, those of Detroit
 housewife Viola Lfuzzo and Jim Crow.

 THE UNIVERSITY or TOKYO,
 Tokyo, Japan, April 30, 1965.
 Hon. WAYNE L. MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C., U.S.A.
 Sin: I was a Fulbright exchange graduate
 student for the year 1955-56, and a Rocke-
 feller fellow during 1956-57.  I visited the
 United States again last year as an Eisen-
 hower fellow.  While in America, I was al-
 ways greatly impressed with the courage and
 independence you showed in criticizing a
 wrong policy of the administration and in
 advancing an imaginative and sound alterna-
 tive.
 I am writing this letter in a serious hope
 that the voice of the Japanese people con-
 cerning the war in Vietnam will be heard by
 influential  political leaders in the United
 States.
 If you allow me to speak with candor, I
 must tell you that the United States is ap-
 pearing in the eyes of the Japanese public
 as an increasingly violent, horrible, and per-
 haps deranged nation as far as its policy in
 Vietnam  is  concerned.  Furthermore,  the
 brutalities  directed  against  civil rights
 marchers were reported almost every day with
 pictures of what we had been told to con-
 sider as utterly "un-American"; i.e., uncivi-
 lized  and                                                                           undemocratic, scenes.  What is
 happening in the mind of the common citi-
 zen here is something far beyond a political
 disagreement to the U.S. policy toward Viet-
 nam.                                                                   It is ?a deep moral indignation against
 the stand taken by the U.S. Government and,
 indeed, the moral prestige of the United
 States seems to have reached by far the low-
 est point In the whole postwar history of
 United States-Japanese relations.
 The Japanese are gravely concerned with
 the situation in Vietnam not only because
 we have profound sympathy with the people
 of South Vietnam, whose earnest desire for
 peace and survival is disregarded by the
 United States which is allegedly fighting for
 their freedom, but also because escalation of
 war will almost inevitably involve Japan in
 a conflict in Korea and over the American
 bases in Okinawa and on the main island.
 The general consensus among the Japa-
 nese, even including the political leaders in
 the Conservative Party, business leaders, and
 many intellectuals, who have been com-
 mitted to Japan's alliance with the United
 States, is that the Vietcong are more na-
 tionalist  than  Communist,  the  domino
 theory is untenable and irrelevant, and a
 settlement should be worked out, not by war
 or the bombing of North Vietnam or the use
 of poisonous gases and napalm bombs, but by
 diplomatic negotiations.
 There is a recent opinion poll taken toward
 the middle of March by the Mainichi, one of
 the three largest national papers with a cir-
 culation of approximately 4 million. As high
 as 100 percent of the sample knew that a
 war is being waged between the South Viet-
 namese Government  and  the U.S. Armed
 Forces, on the one hand, and the "Vietcong,"
 on the other.
 One of the questionnaires reads: "What do
 you think is the first step to be taken for
 the termination of war In Vietnam?"
 Percent
 Withdrawal of U.S. troops--------------- 40
 Opening of international negotiations---- 46
 Cease-fire by "Vietcong"----------------    4
 Increasing bombing of North Vietnam----     0
 Don't know and others---------------- 10
 Although I am aware that, strictly scien-
 tifically speaking, there are some minor ques-
 tionable points in the techniques used in
 this poll, I do feel that this survey represents
 a fair picture of the general reactions of the
 Japanese people.  Please note that this poll
 had been taken before the use of gas by the
 U.S. troops was reported.
 The hope created by President Johnson's
 address on April 7, has been completely can-
 celed out by the massive bombardment on
 the following days.  In retrospect, his speech
 even contributed in strengthening the indig-
 nation of the Japanese public against Ameri-
 can policy because many of us found our-
 selves "cheated" by the hopeful illusion pro-
 duced by the President's address.
 In view of the critical situation in Vietnam
 which is threatening peace in Asia and the
 security of Japan, 93 intellectual leaders liv-
 ing in the Tokyo area addressed an appeal to
 the Japanese Government, by way of handing
 it over to Prime Minister Sato on April 20.
 It called for a prompt and effective action
 by the Japanese Government toward peace-
 ful settlement of the Vietnamese problem.
 It urged the Japanese Government (1)  to
 clarify its position that if war should escalate
 into a larger scale involving additional coun-
 tries Japan would disapprove American bases
 in Japan being used for combat operations,
 (2) to appeal to the U.S. Government for an
 immediate suspension of air attacks on North
 Vietnam, and (3)  to appeal to the United
 States and other countries concerned to open
 diplomatic negotiations, at once, to which the
 "Vietcong" should be a party, and to effect
 an immediatecease-fire.
 The full text of the statement, despite its
 being of considerable length, has been pub-
 lished by two of the largest national papers,
 the Asahi with a circulation of approximately
 5 million and the Mainichi mentioned above.
 This was an extraordinary treatment by the
 press of an appeal issued by an ad hoc group
 of intellectuals.
 It may also be noted that this appeal was
 an unusual action by nonleftiat, liberal intel-
 lectual leaders here said that many of the
 signatories hold influential positions not only
 among academic circles but as advisers to the
 Government-a fact that would in part ex-
 plain the willingness on the part of the Prime
 Minister to meet the five representatives.
 Enclosed, I am sending you (1) a copy of
 the English translation of the appeal, (2) a
 clipping of the front page of the Mainichi
 Daily News, English edition of the Japanese
 Mainichi, that carries a report on the state-
 ment, and (3) an editorial of the Asahi Eve-
 ning News, again English edition of the Asahi
 in Japanese, that gives full support to the
 appeal.  You will also find (4) a news report
 of the Japan Times, which is known for its
 pro-American orientation, on the remarks of
 Mr. Matsumoto on the Vietnamese war.  He
 was former Ambassador to Great Britain and
 has just been to southeast Asia as special
 envoy of Prime Minister Sato. You might also
 be Interested in information on (5)  the
 agreement between Mr. Lodge and Premier
 Sato that Japan can never become a direct
 operational base 'for  the  American forces
 fighting in Vietnam.   Mr. Matsumoto's re-
 marks as well as this agreement indicate heai-
 tation and reluctance on the part of the Jap-
 anese Government to become involved in the-
 war in Vietnam in collaboration with the
 United States.
 I am sending you these reports in the hope
 that they will draw your attenion and prove
 to be of interest to you.  I should be deeply
 grteful  if  you  take  into  your  consid-
 eration                                                                                                                                              the view of     the  Japanese public
 stated herein.

 APPEAL TO THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT ON THE
 WAR IN Vn4TNAM

 about by the war in Vietnam are being ag-

 gravated day by day. Not only is this war
 causing unsurpassable misery to the people of
 Vietnam, but it is also constituting a great
 menace to peace in Asia and to the security
 of Japan.  It is no wonder that there is rap-
 idly growing among the Japanese people con-
 cern and apprelension as to the implica-
 tions of the war.  We deeply regret that the
 Japanese Government has not taken any
 positive action by way of fulfilling its re-
 sponsibilties to guarantee the security of Ja-
 pan.and to restore peace in Asia.
 Therefore, we strongly urge our Govern-
 ment to make a prompt decision according
 to the three proposals we present below, and
 to declare its intention to the Japanese
 people and to other nations.
 1. If the United States should persist in
 her present policy, there is an imminent
 danger of armed conflicts ensuing between
 the United States and the People's Republic
 of China, regardless of the calculated design
 of the Government of the United States.
 Furthermore, there is a natural fear for the
 tension being heightened at the 38th parallel
 in Korea, between South Korea, who has sent
 troops to South Vietnam, on the one hand,
 and North Korea, who has pledged military
 support to the National Liberation Front
 (Vietcong), on the other.  It is past any
 dispute that our involvement in these armed
 conflicts resulting from the military opera-
 tions of the United States will be absolutely
 incompatible with the security of Japan.
 It is true that Japan is bound by the
 security treaty to collaborate with the United
 States.  Nevertheless, article I of this treaty
 holds that, in accordance with the provision
 of the United Nations Charter, international
 disputes shall be settled by peaceful means,
 and the parties to the treaty. shall refrain
 from "the threat or use of force against the
 territorial integrity or political independence
 of any state."  We believe that the present
 use of force by the United States in Vietnam
 is in violation of these provisions.  It is evi-
 dently in line with the general rule of inter-
 national law that in such a case Japan is
 not necessarily bound by the above-men-
 tioned duty of collaboration.  This point is
 clearly illustrated by the position of the
 United States who, at the time of the Suez
 crisis, opposed the military actions under-
 taken by Britain and France, in spite of the
 fact that the United States was in alliance
 with these two nations.
 Accordingly, we appeal to the Japanese
 Government to manifest its position imme-
 diately to its own people and to other na-
 tions that if the war in Vietnam should es-
 calate into a war on a larger scale involving
 additional countries, Japan would refuse to
 let the U.S. bases in Japan be used for the
 purpose of military combat operations.  A
 declaration of the Japanese Government in
 making this stand will in itself be an im-
 portant impetus toward preventing the war
 in Vietnam from escalating into armed con-
 flicts between the United States and China
 or the Soviet Union. .
 2. The direct cause of such expansion of
 the war in Vietnam is the air attacks by the
 United States on North Vietnam.  For this
 reason, the first thing that should take place
 to prevent this danger is the cessation of the
 bombardment on North Vietnam by  the
 United States and the South Vietnamese
 forces.
 Moreover, the air attacks on the north are
 in themselves operations beyond the limits
 of self-defense, even if further escalation of
 the war might somehow be avoided.  Such
 an abuse of the right of self-defense is con-
 trary to the provisions of the United Nations
 Charter and article I of the Japan-United
 States Security Treaty.  It may be noted
 that the Government of the United States
 no longer endeavors to justify its actions by
 invoking such concepts as retaliation or
 collective self-defense, as it did at the be-
 ginning of the air attacks on the north.
 Though there may be a certain degree of                 LIST OF SIGNATORIES
 aid given by North Vietnam to the National
 Liberation Front, even the figures given by
 the U.S. Government in the "White Paper on
 Vietnam" show clearly that the military as-
 sistance from the north is very modest in
 terms of military force.  Looking back on
 the whole process of the war in Vietnam, we
 are persuaded to believe that the aid from
 the north has been more of a counterbal-
 ance to the enormous amount of military
 aid offered by the United States to the South
 Vietnamese Government, which has taken
 measures to suppress any groups opposing
 its policies, and has forfeited the support of
 the people.  This means that the United
 States is not entitled to justify the air at-
 tacks on the north, by citing the help ex-
 tended by North Vietnam to the National
 Liberation Front.
 For these two reasons, we urge the Japa-
 nese Government to appeal to the United
 States for immediate suspension of the air
 attacks on the north.
 3. At present, in South Vietnam,a grue-
 some war is going on, side by side with the
 air attacks on the north.  We cannot re-
 frain from expressing our profound indigna-
 tion against the recent use by the U.S.
 forces of napalm bombs, poisonous gases
 and other atrocious weapons, and especial-
 ly ly against the bringing in of tactical nu-
 clear weapons into South Vietnam.
 If the United States should continue to
 fight  the  National Liberation Front with
 such,means of warfare, which would make
 the war in Vietnam literally a war of an-
 nihilation, the greater part of South Viet-
 nam will inevitably be reduced to a scorched
 land of complete devastation.  The people
 of South' Vietnam are exhausted by the war
 that has lasted more than 20 years.  There
 is no doubt about their not desiring con-
 tinuation of such a war.  The United States,
 however, is pursuing war efforts and destruc-
 tion, against the will of the Vietnamese peo-
 ple who are longing for peace.  The fact that
 Japan belongs to Asia makes it all the more
 impossible for us to remain inactive in the
 face of the suffering of the people in South
 Vietnam.
 In view of what has been stated above, the
 war in South Vietnam conducted by the
 United States cannot escape from being
 called an unexcusable disregard of human
 dignity and the right of national self-de-
 termination.  In order that South Vietnam
 should emerge out of its present condition
 of misery and despair, diplomatic negotia-
 tions should be opened without delay to
 terminate the war.  In this respect, we wel-
 come President Johnson's statement, made
 in response to the proposal by the 17 non-
 alined nations, to the effect that the United
 States  "remains  ready  for  unconditional
 discussions."  This kind of diplomatic dis-
 cussions, however, must be accompanied by
 an unconditional cease-fire, so that there can
 be no room for continued military opera-
 tions with the aim of gaining a favorable
 position for negotiation.
 The essential conditions for a solution to
 the war in Vietnam will be firstly to base
 the whole argument on the recognition that
 this war is fundamentally a civil war, and
 should be treated as such; the National Lib-
 eration Front should be recognized as a party
 to the negotiation; the U.S. troops should
 eventually be withdrawn; and there should
 be corresponding suspension of the aid from
 North Vietnam.
 We fervently hope that the Japanese Gov-
 ernment, in full realization of the points

 [From the Asahi Evening News, Apr. 22,
 1965]
 APPEAL ON VIETNAM CRISIS
 We are in complete agreement with the
 aims of an appeal submitted on Tuesday to
 the Japanese Government by 93 scholars and
 men of letters.  This is because we believe the
 most important problem now Is how to pre-
 vent the danger of the Vietnam situation
 from escalating.
 First, we wish to take note of the fact that
 it took the form of an appeal to the Japanese
 Government.    We think that this is the
 proper line to take in any such movement.
 The reason is that if, instead, such a move-
 ment takes the form of direct statements or
 actions aimed at the United States or the
 Communist side, there is danger of it being
 led in an unexpected direction by a sudden
 outburst of feelings.
 Utmost care must be exercised so that such
 a movement does not move toward fostering
 bad feelings against a certain country or
 race.  One of the saddest results of the Sino-
 Soviet polemics is in its fanning of racial an-
 tagonism.  The Vietnam war may further in-
 crease this danger.
 If Hanoi is bombed, what a big shock will
 be felt by our people.  There is a possibility
 of a recurrence of the disturbance that broke
 out in 196Q over the problem of the Japan-
 United States Security Treaty.
 In  considering  the    possibility  of  such
 danger,  it  will become of increasing im-
 portance in the future for such movements
 in our country to take the proper Bourse
 and be directed to the Government or the
 Diet. And If we can trust the Government
 and the.Diet to properly understand the cur-
 rent. feeling of the people and act accord-
 ingly, the movement will of itself maintain
 order.
 AMERICAN VIEW
 In criticizing the appeal, it is pointed out
 that the U.S. Government and the majority
 of the American people consider that North
 Vietnam is invading the South and that the
 prerequisite to negotiations is to stop it.
 Aside from whether this American view is
 wrong or not, it is also pointed out that the
 Americans believe so.
 It is reasonable.  But even if there had
 been a little aid to the south from the north,
 as a real problem, as a result of the bombing
 of the north, the aid from the north to the
 south can be imagined to have been cut,
 while the aid that the United States has ex-
 tended to the South Vietnam Government is
 far greater than the aid from the north to
 the Vietcong.  In view of this, an appeal to
 the United States and South Vietnam to
 first stop bombing the north cannot be said
 to be unreasonable so as to cease the vicious
 cycle in which one retaliatory action leads
 to another.
 In particular, we wish much thought to be
 given to how much the friends of the United
 States were hopelessly disillusioned by the
 series of bombings of the north, which were
 launched immediately after President John-
 son gave his Baltimore speech, which was
 so rich in suggestions.
 At the same time, we must strongly ask
 the Vietcong and the Communists not to
 make the withdrawal of American troops
 the prerequisite for negotiations for peace.
 Such a demand for withdrawal Is eventually
 right, and the United States itself is not
 against it, but it must be said to be too
 costly a demand that ignores commonsense.
 We imagine that the most difficult problem
 remaining would concern the treatment of
 the Vietcong.  Negotiating with "rebels" or
 their participation In talks may be hard to
 bear.  But historically, this has been so for
 all movements of colonies  for  liberation.
 American independence started with the re-
 volt against the mother country, Britain. ]
 May 7, 1965
 has been so in the independence of Ireland
 and India.   French President  Charles de
 Gaulle was wise in deciding to negotiate with
 the Front de Ia Liberation Nationale (FLN)
 in Algeria.
 In considering the problem thus, the basis
 for a judgment lies in lust how much ter-
 ritory and how many people the Vietcong
 presently has under its control.   On this
 score, the Vietcong, whether one likes it or
 not, must be    recognized  as  a belligerent
 organization.
 REASONABLE
 After  all, Japan cannot take the stand
 that it does not matter if South Vietnam
 is communized.  Therefore, opinion is strong
 that it should aid the United States and
 South Vietnam.  This is reasonable in a way.
 But actually, is not the problem of how
 to meet communism more important?
 It is  not wise to oppose  ideology with
 armed force.  The U.S. Government is prob-
 ably fully aware of this reasoning.  But the
 tragedy of South Vietnam may be said to
 have been in not discovering a democratic
 reformer for a leader.
 It may be logically contended that the
 United States can do nothing but strengthen
 its  military actions at the  present stage.
 But it is also a fact that as the military
 operations are strengthened, the originally
 non-Communist democratic people as well
 as the nationalists will be rapidly pushed
 toward  communism.   Experience  has  fre-
 quently shown that if people who are not
 Red are branded as such and continually
 called so, they will really become Red.
 Not only the United States but the Soviet
 Union and China, the big powers, tend to be
 short in understanding the nationalism of
 the small countries.  Even among Commu-
 nist countries, which stand on the princi-
 ple of internationalism, the nationalism of
 the small countries is strong.
 Even if the fears of the United States
 against the expansionism of China are jus-
 tified, is not the United States itself break-
 ing  down  the  strongest  barrier  against
 China's expansion by its bombing of North
 Vietnam?
 PREDICAMENT
 If the United States-Vietnam policy fails,
 Japan will be placed in a terrible predica-
 ment.  Therefore, we wish the United States
 to consider the advantages and disadvan-
 tages, not from a small military and political
 standpoint, but from a broader standpoint.
 To be sure, the argument may be made
 for a continuation of the bombing of the
 -north, and if China comes out, to take it as
 a chance to hit and destroy its nuclear power
 in the bud.  But victory on the ground can-
 not be gained by destruction from the air
 alone.  Japan has proved by its experience
 in China that even if points and lines are
 secured, the war will not end and the tide
 of popular feelings cannot be won over.
 The important thing now is to end the
 escalation of the war.  Consideration for
 world opinion can be discerned in the joint
 statement by the Soviet Union and North
 Vietnam.  President  Johnson's  Baltimore
 speech reveals that it was motivated by a
 peace appeal by nonalined nations.
 The present situation can move toward an
 expansion of the war, or it can be the right
 moment for listening to the peace appeal. It
 is at a most delicate stage when moves can
 be made either for peace or war.
 The present, therefore, is no time for the
 Japanese Government and ruling party to
 stand idly by watching developments in the
 belief that there is little possibility of an.
 armed clash between the United States, the
 Soviet Union, and China.  The reason is that
 there are many Japanese who take a serious
 view of the situation.  Since there are so
 many such people, the way to allay their

 LODGE AGREES JAPAN  WILL  NOT  BE  TURNED
 INTO  VIETNAM  WAR  BASE-L.B.J.'S  ENVOY
 SEES PREMIER; REQUESTS JAPAN AID EFFORT
 Special  U.S.  presidential envoy  Henry
 Cabot Lodge and Prime Minister Eisaku Sato
 Saturday agreed that Japan can never be-
 come it direct operational base for the U.S.
 forces fighting in Vietnam.
 Their meeting at the Prime Minister's offi-
 cial residence at Nagata-cho Saturday began
 at 4 p.m. and lasted more than 2 hours.
 Lodge arrived at 1:59 p.m. Saturday.
 Sato told Lodge that Japan is increasingly
 concerned over expansion of the Vietnam war
 and also conveyed Japan's desire that the
 United States make more efforts to find a
 peaceful settlement of the Vietnam conflict.
 Lodge, former ambassador to South Viet-
 nam, said the United States is fighting to
 secure the freedom and  liberty in South
 Vietnam and also expressed a hope that
 Japan understands the difficulties now facing
 the United States to obtain these objectives
 in Vietnam.
 Lodge also urged that Japan undertake an
 active role in the development of southeast
 Asia under the program recently suggested
 in President Lyndon B. Johnson's Baltimore
 speech.
 Lodge, who is on a tour of Oceania and Far
 Eastern countries as Johnson's special envoy,
 arrived at Tokyo International Airport by a
 special plane Saturday afternoon for a 3-day
 stay in Tokyo.
 Soon after his arrival, Lodge visited the
 Prime Minister at his official residence, ac-
 companied by U.S. Ambassador Edwin O.
 Reischauer.
 The meeting was also attended by Foreign
 Minister Etsusaburo Shiina and Chief Cabi-
 net Secretary Tomisaburo Hashimoto.
 After the meeting, Hashimoto said Lodge
 did not have a special proposal to make but
 exchanged views with the Prime Minister on
 the Vietnam Issue.
 Hashimoto, however, refrained from dis-
 closing whether or not Sato presented to
 Lodge a concrete Japanese plan for peaceful
 settlement of the Vietnam question.
 Hashimoto said that Sato told Lodge that
 the United States should not involve Japan
 in the Vietnam war by turning its bases here
 into direct operational points for its military
 operations in Vietnam.  Lodge reportedly an-
 swered that he agreed with Sato's view on this
 matter.
 According to Hashimoto, Lodge, going into
 details over Johnson's plan for southeast
 Asia's economic development, added that the
 United States does not yet have a concrete
 plan for such a program.  He said, however,
 that the United States expects Japan can co-
 operate actively in the program because of
 its geographical proximity, experience, and
 know-how in the Asian development.

 And the United States, by associating itself
 with France's effort, took its first long step
 toward making the Vietnamese cynical about
 American protestations of support for na-
 tional self determination.  Thus ended the
 first U.S. attempt to build up a competing
 government in Vietnam.
 This failure left two important political
 legacies:  First, the Vietminh had gained
 overriding control of Vietnamese national-
 ism; and second, most of rural Vietnam,
 south  as  well as  north, had  become  ac-
 customed                                                                               to  being  administered  by  the
 Vietminh and had reason to be loyal to it.
 In the eyes of the Vietnamese peasant, the
 Vietminh had rid the country of colonial rule
 and had enacted beneficial social reform,
 especially in  the  agrarian  sphere. These
 legacies have powerfully affected the political
 scene in post-Geneva Vietnam and still limit
 the possibilities for attaining American ob-
 jectives there.
 Yet despite these inherent disadvantages,
 soon after the Geneva Conference the United
 States for the second time attempted to es-
 tablish an anti-Communist Vietnamese gov-
 ernment, this time no longer in association
 with France.   Although the circumstances
 might have seemed to doom this American
 effort from the outset-no matter how en-
 lightened its execution-there was one cru-
 cially important, though temporary and in a
 sense artificial, advantage which the United
 States enjoyed.  This derived from the un-
 equivocal provision in the Geneva accords
 that elections would be held in July 1956,
 under international supervision, to unify the
 country under one government .7  In antici-
 pation of these elections (and also because of
 its preoccupation with the economic rehabili-
 tation of the North), the Vietminh initially
 honored a central provision of the accords
 and abstained from militant tactics in tb';e
 South.  The American-sponsored Ngo Dinh
 Diem government thereby. won a reprieve
 lasting several years in which to could have

 that greater military power must be brought
 to bear before we can attain a suitable posi-
 tion for negotiations.  The French ignored
 then, and the United States is ignoring now,
 basic political factors that limit what can be
 achieved by military power. With us as with
 the French, the lack of popular support for a
 regime  artificially  fostered  by  Western
 backers and out of line with the mainstream
 of Vietnamese nationalism has precluded any
 politically effective application of military
 power.
 EARLY ATTEMPTS TO BUILD A GOVERNMENT
 American efforts to build up an anti-Com-
 munist government in Vietnam began at
 least 5 years before the 1954 Geneva Confer-
 ence on Indochina and were initially under-
 taken in cooperation with, and in support of
 the French .8  Abandoning Roosevelt's post-
 war objective of denying Vietnam to France
 and making it a United Nations trusteeship,4
 the Truman administration backed France in
 her efforts to reimpose military control .5  In
 adopting this policy, Truman's advisers were
 hoping that either concurrently or following
 the reestablishment of such control, France
 would grant a substantial measure of inde-
 pendence to a non-Communist Vietnamese
 Government. But that hope rested on a fun-
 damental error in assessing Vietnamese po-
 litical forces and was shattered, politically 0
 quite as dramatically as subsequently it was
 militarily with the debacle of Dienbienphu.
 During its early efforts to build up a Viet-
 namese Government, Washington failed to
 appreciate the extent to which Ho Chi Minh
 and the Vietminh were regarded as the sym-
 bol of Vietnamese nationalism-for most
 non-Communists as well as Communists.
 2 See Anthony Eden, "Full Circle" (Boston,
 1960), p. 100, and Navarre, op. cit.
 8 By 1954 American aid to the French war
 effort in Indochina was considerably greater
 than the amount France herself was spend-
 ing on these operations.  In September 1953
 the French Prime Minister announced that
 the additional aid then being granted by the
 United States would defray 70 percent of
 France's expenditure on the war.  Finally in
 1954 "the American Government undertook
 to underwrite the entire cost of the war,
 allocating $1,175 million for that purpose"
 (Donald Lancaster, "The Emancipation of
 French Indochina" [Oxford, 19611, p. 417).
 `Roosevelt indicated that he had this in
 mind at the 1945 Yalta Conference; see Al-
 lan B. Cole, ed., "Conflict in Indochina and
 International Repercussions: A Documentary
 History, 1945-55"  (Ithaca, N.Y.,  1956), pp.
 47-48.

 French to grant real independence to the
 states of Indochina, but our urging was polite
 and restrained.  Any real pressure, it was felt,
 Would so antagonize the French as to have
 adverse effects upon American plans to make
 France a keystone in the defense of Europe.
 Even after 1950, American efforts to exert
 pressure on France in the Far East were in-
 hibited by what the United States deemed to
 be her more important European objectives-
 first the commitment to NATO, and later the
 attempt to establish a European Defense
 Community, which was ultimately defeated
 by France herself.
 0 Even if France had yielded to our request
 that she  grant real  independence to  the
 puppet government she promoted under Em-
 peror Bao Dai, it was most unlikely that a
 majority  of the  Vietnamese would    have
 chosen him over Ho Chi Minh.  As Eden de,
 scribed Bao Dai, he was "neither a popular
 nor an Inspiring figure.  He preferred the
 casino to the council chamber and the antics.
 of his corrupt and transient ministers in
 Saigon did not appeal to moderate nation-
 alist opinion" (Eden, op. cit., p. 89).
 THE GENEVA ACCORDS
 To understand why the Vietminh granted
 this reprieve, and indeed to appreciate both
 the course of subsequent developments and
 the possibilities open today, it is essential to
 understand certain features of the Geneva
 accords which have frequently been over-
 looked.  Moscow and Peiping each for its
 own special reasons,8 pressured the Vietminh
 into signing an armistice with Prance and
 negotiating a political settlement which, it
 s See article 7 of the "Final Declaration of
 the Geneva Conference," in "Further Docu-
 ments Relating to the Discussion of Indo-
 china at the Geneva Conference, June 16-
 July  21,  1954,"  hereafter  referred  to  as
 Geneva Accords (London [Her Majesty's Sta-
 tionery Office, Cmd. 9239], 1954), p. 10._ Sig-
 nificantly, article 7 stipulates that the elec-
 tions were to be antecedent to and a neces-
 sary condition for the "fundamental free-
 doms,  guaranteed  by  democratic  institu-
 tions" and that the elections were to be held
 "in order to insure * * * that all the neces-
 sary conditions obtain for free expression of
 the national will." This particular portion
 of the accords has frequently been quoted
 out of context, with the key phrases in re-
 verse order, in order to justify the refusal to
 hold elections on the grounds that the nec-
 8 The Soviet Union probably put pressure
 on the Vietminh in order to induce France
 to stay out of the projected European De-

 336-337, and Daniel Lerner and Raymond
 Aron,  editor,  "France Defeats EDC"  (New
 York, 1957), pp. 16-17.  China, on the other
 hand, had determined to embark on Its

 was generally agreed, gave the Vietminh con-
 trol over far less territory than its military
 position warranted .0  Nevertheless, had they
 been carried through in their entirety ac-
 cords could have served the Vietminh's in-
 terests.
 The basis of the accords was a military
 truce between  the     Vietminh  and  France.
 This was designed to end the 9-year-old war
 and open the way for an internationally sup-
 ported political agreement which would pro-
 vide for the peaceful resolution of outstand-
 ing problems.                                                                                                                                The political accords agreed
 to at Geneva 10 established the conditions for

 toral plane.  The Vietminh, yielding to So-

 arms and agreed to the temporary partition
 of  the  country, 12  pending  reunification
 through  nationwide   elections."  It   dis-
 9 The Vietminh agreed not only to give up
 control of rich areas in the delta south of
 Saigon but also to evacuate major centers
 of support north of the 13th parallel.    As
 French Premier Mendes-France stated before
 the National Assembly: "So far as the de-
 marcation line is concerned, the enemy was
 asking for the 13th parallel; and today we
 have  the  17th.  Now  between  the  13th
 and  17th parallel Tourane [now Danang]
 and Hue are located, and there are three
 provinces which have always shown allegi-
 ance to the Vietminh and which the Viet-
 minh is now going to evacuate so that they
 may pass under our control" (Journal Offi-
 ciel de la Republique Francaise, Debats Par-
 lementaires, Assemblee Nationale, Seance du
 vendredi 23  juillet  1954  [Paris,  1954],  p.
 3580).
 10 The  political accords at Geneva     were
 subscribed to by verbal assent by Cambodia,
 China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
 (Vietminh), France, Laos, the U.S.S.R., and
 the United  Kingdom.  The  United States
 and the State of Vietnam (French-sponsored
 Bao Dal regime) were not parties to the ac-
 cords, but the United States made its own
 unilateral declaration (see [17] below).
 11 As the New York Times correspondent,
 Tillman  Durdin,   cabled   from   Geneva:
 "Vietminh leaders are not entirely happy
 about the peace settlement in Vietnam.   A
 number of members of the Vietminh delega-
 tion have declared openly that pressure from
 Chinese  Communist  Premier Chou En=1ai
 and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav M.
 Molotov forced their regime to accept less
 than  it rightfully  should  have  obtained
 here."  These Vietminh officials contended,
 according to Durdin, that the military situ-
 ation in Vietnam would have given the Viet-
 minh almost full control within a year, and
 that Cambodia and Laos could have taken
 over eventually.  They saw the settlement as
 a sort of appeasement; "in interests of Soviet
 and Chinese Communist international rela-
 tions," they feel "their revolution has been
 slowed down, if not halted, right on the verge
 of complete success" (New York Times, July
 25,  1954).  See  also  Jean  Lacouture  and
 Philippe  Devillers,  "La fin d'une  guerre:
 Indochine 1954" (Paris, 1960), pp. 282-285.
 12 The Vietminh, as well as China and the
 Soviet Union, also recognized the potential
 danger in further fighting, should it lead to
 a massive American Intervention.     With the
 promise of elections before- them, however,
 the Communists had little reason to chal-
 lenge the United States further and thereby
 determine the credibility of vague warnings
 about massive retaliation.,
 1s The official Vietminh newspaper, Nhan-
 Dan, reflected the confident expectation of
 the North Vietnamese that elections would
 be held when, just after the conclusion of
 the Conference, it reported: "The final de-
 claration  of  the  Geneva  Conference  has
 stipulated the withdrawal of foreign troops

 State Department's white paper of Feb. 27,
 1965, this is the view of most independent
 and informed observers.
 20 Under Vietminh control the peasants
 were often given land and not required to
 pay taxes on it; but when the Diem govern-
 ment's land reform was put into action the
 peasants had to buy this land from the land-
 lords and pay taxes.                The Vietcong success-
 fully presented this to the peasants as an
 oppressive measure.   See J. L. Finkle and
 Tran Van Dinh, "Provincial Government in
 Vietnam: A Study of Vinh Long Province"
 (Michigan State University Advisory Group,
 Saigon, 1961).  Moreover, the South Vietna-
 mese peasants often ridiculed Diem's rural
 programs because of their non-Vietnamese
 origins.  The Vietcong's  denunciations  of
 the My-Diem government-that is, the Amer-
 ican-Diem   Government-thus                        frequently
 echoed popularly expressed sentiments.  See
 Scigliano, op. cit. pp. 158 and 206.  The Sai-
 gon administration also made the mistake of
 frequently assigning upper level local ad-
 ministrators with regional backgrounds dif-
 ferent from the rural populations under their
 authority.
 80 Despite its statements to the contrary,
 the Diem regime failed to develop a policy
 which took account of the tribal peoples'
 grievances.  The government ignored a re-
 port prepared by the Michigan State Uni-
 versity Advisory Group which urged real and
 "sorely needed" reforms in the relationship
 between the tribal peoples and the Saigon
 authorities (final report covering activities
 of the Michigan. State University Vietnam
 Advisory Group, for the period May 20, 1955-
 June 30, 1962 [Saigon, 19621).  Mounting
 tension between the government in Saigon
 and the tribal peoples eventually led to the
 limited rebellion of September 1964 in which
 the tribal people in the Ban Me Thuot area
 killed a large number of lowland Vietnamese
 and made demands for greater autonomy.  A
 description of these events and some dis-
 cussion of the background of tribal discon-
 tent is contained in the New York Times for
 the period Sept. 21-28, 1964.
 81 This program received considerable pub-
 licity throughout 1962 and much of 1963. Al-
 most all official U.S. comment during this
 period praised the achievements of the pro-
 gram.         It is now widely admitted, however,
 that the program was a failure and that
 exaggerated claims were made for its suc-
 cess by both South Vietnamese and Ameri-
 cans.  The program sought, in theory, to re-
 settle peasants in protected hamlets, where
 they would be able to benefit from improved
 social services.   Little attention was paid,
 however,  to  the   basic  sociological factors
 which were    involved in such a program.
 The South Vietnamese peasants in the delta
 region are not accustomed to living in com-
 pact settlements. They resented being moved
 from their fields, the tombs of their ancestors
 and the village dinh, the spiritual center of
 the village.  The hamlets into which they
 were moved were inadequately protected,
 leaving the peasants a prey to the insurgents,
 while the promised social improvements did
 not eventuate.  On the failure of the stra-
 tegic hamlet program, see in particular: the
 New  York  Times  of  Oct.  23,  Dec.  13,
 and  Dec.  23,  1963, and   Jan. 10    and

 cessful.   The  consequence  was  an  ever-
 greater alienation of the population.                                                                         More-
 over, in the 18 months since the assassination
 of Diem the situation has continued to de-
 teriorate, and the shifting combinations of
 army officers controlling the government have
 remained just as isolated from the Viet-
 namese people."
 When the United States in February 1965
 began its air strikes against the north, Sai-
 gon's authority in the countryside was at a
 low point at the same time that the Viet-
 cong was mounting a major military offen-
 sive to split the country.  Against a confident,
 powerful adversary, the South Vietnamese
 forces seemed inept and undisciplined on the
 battlefield, and additional areas fell under
 Vietcong  control.   Between  mid-December
 1964 and mid-March 1965, more than 120,000
 refugees fled to Saigon and other coastal
 areas from central highland areas recently
 taken over by the Vietcong .w
 Not only was the country's political lead-
 ership seriously weakened because of inter-
 nal schism, but also the army itself, now
 seriously divided, was so absorbed in the
 struggle for power that it had lost much of
 its combat potential.  Key units were alerted
 as often for transfer to Saigon, to support
 or oppose one or another of the military poli-
 ticians, as for assignment to fight the Viet-
 cong.  In late 1964, dissension in the ranks
 of the army began to accompany an in-
 creased  civilian disenchantment with  the
 Saigon Government.  By January 1965, the
 army was  experiencing  grave difficulty in
 conscripting recruits, an average of 30 per-
 cent of whom were reportedly deserting with-
 in weeks of their enlistment 34
 The rapidly deteriorating military posi-
 tion of the Saigon administration coincided
 with a decrease in its political cohesion and
 a perceptible growth in war weariness and
 in the demand for a peaceful settlement.  In
 Saigon itself, as well as in such Buddhist
 strongholds as Hue, students and monks
 advocated an end to the fighting and called
 for negotiations with Hanoi35  Popular back-
 ing for such a course became so great that
 the Government could no longer silence the
 dissidence simply by jailing all of those who
 voiced these views.   Preoccupied with the
 Vietcong offensive begun in December in the
 central region of South Vietnam, and fear-
 ing a military disaster, the United States
 further committed its forces to a protracted
 and costly effort.  Yet this move must have
 seemed to many of the Vietnamese to con-
 demn them to a struggle for which there was
 no end in sight.    Together with the existing
 war weariness of the populace, it raised the
 possibility that the leader of a future coup
 might respond to widespread sentiment to
 end the war by undertaking bilateral nego-
 tiations with Hanoi.  There was no evidence,
 however, that American policy allowed for
 such a possibility.
 THE OTHER SOUTHERN REGIME
 The increasing areas south of the 17th
 parallel from which Saigon has been ousted
 32 This is made abundantly clear in the
 New York Times reporting during this period.
 Also, a U.S. official report released on April 1,
 1964, stated that only 34 percent of Viet-
 nam s villages were government controlled;
 24 percent were "neutral," and 42 percent
 were outright Vietcong.  In January 1964,
 The Observer (American Army newspaper in
 Saigon) wrote that "some four to five million
 people support the NLF in varying degrees."
 Both of these sources are cited in Bernard
 Fall, The Two Vietnams (New York, 1963),
 p. 396.
 "New York Times, Mar. 16, r965.
 24 New York Times, Jan.  19,  1965.   The
 London Times of Mar. 6, 1965, reported that

 have not become administrative vacuums.
 Into most of them.has moved a fully func-
 tioning Vietcong .administration " The Viet-
 cong now controls more of South Vietnam
 than Saigon does, and at night, when Sai-
 gon's military patrols return to their bases,
 the area which the Vietcong administers ex-
 pands still further 3'
 The  Vietcong  cadres  are  not  isolated
 strangers in an unfamiliar land. Most, re-
 cruits and hard core alike, are southerners
 with deep local roots, familiar with the area
 and living in what they rightly regard as their
 homeland.  At least up to the end of 1964,
 nearly all those Vietcong who had infiltrated
 from the north were southerners"  As well
 as cadre and troops, the Vietcong relies upon
 administrators who are native to the areas in
 which they work"  Indeed, the Vietcong has
 consistently been far more sensitive than
 Saigon to the strong regional sentiment char-
 acteristic of politics throughout Vietnam.
 Undoubtedly it was in part in order to
 come to terms with this regional feeling
 in the south that the National Liberation
 Front  of  South  Vietnam-the  NLF-was
 established in December 1960.  Whatever the
 extent of its loyalty to Hanoi, the Vietcong
 has depended on southern support and has
 felt obliged to give the liberation front a
 distinctly southern slant=even to the point
 of using a different flag from the government
 in the north.  The front calls on all anti-
 Saigon Vietnamese for backing; while clearly
 20 According to Peter Grose, writing in the
 New  York      Times  Magazine  of  Jan.  24,
 1965, the Vietcong has developed "a stable
 and  orderly   political  machine across  the
 country, their cadres paralleling the Saigon
 administrative structure at every level. Only
 a final political shift at the top is awaited
 before the entire Communist-led apparatus
 surfaces and exercises its control in the open.
 Under Vietcong provincial commissars and.
 their central committees come district com-
 missars, then the village or township cadres
 and finally the hamlet committees.  Where
 Vietcong control is firm, the administration
 functions   with   scarcely   an interrup-
 tion. * * *                                                                                                                               By conservative estimate, 8,000
 to  10,000  political  administrators govern
 areas of South Vietnam controlled by the
 Vietcong."
 37 It appears that     the Vietcong's taxing
 authority, in one form or another, extends
 over about three-quarters of South Vietnam.
 Citing a U.S. Operations Mission report of
 June 14, 1963, Bernard Fall notes that as
 early as then, in all but three of South Viet-
 nam's forty-four provinces, the Vietcong was
 collecting taxes (Current History, Feb. 1965,
 p.  98).   On  Jan.  24,  1965,  in  the  New
 York Times Magazine,      Peter Grose   noted
 that "as much as 50 million piasters (about
 $700,000)  could have been collected by the
 Vietcong last year in a wealthy province such
 as Long An.       Saigon received 17 million
 piasters from Long An last year."
 2 According to the New York Times of
 Jan. 27,   1965, "before 1964 all infiltrators
 were trained in the north but were South
 Vietnamese in origin and were assigned to
 their native localities."  Assistant Secretary
 of State William P. Bundy stated a few days
 earlier (New York Times, Jan. 24, 1965) that
 "'significant numbers' of trained North Viet-
 namese soldiers had for the first time been
 infiltrating into South Vietnam."  The State
 Department's white paper of Feb. 27 declares
 that "as many as 75 percent of the more than
 4,400 Vietcong who are known to have en-
 tered the south in the first 8 months of
 1964 were natives of North Vietnam."  If
 correct, this figure (3,300) would be a small
 fraction of the total number of Vietcong.

 May 7, 1965             CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 no acceptable exits, Mao Tse-tung's govern-
 ment waits for the United States either to
 back down without a settlement or unilater-
 ally to overextend its military commitments
 in North Vietnam.  The pattern of American
 policy since February has thus far coincided
 with Chinese expectations, and has led to a
 situation In Vietnam which conforms more
 to Chinese than to American and Vietnamese
 interests.
 Chinese goals in Vietnam are less under-
 stood than those of Hanoi or the Soviet
 Union. Although Peiping does not Intend to
 occupy or absorb into China the lands of
 -southeast Asia, it does consider all of eastern
 Asia to be within China's exclusive political-
 economic sphere of influence.                      The Maoist
 leadership  believes  that  the  presence  of
 strong American military power now denies
 it this influence.   Mao's politburo seeks to
 avoid-and without unequivocal Soviet as-
 sistance could not contemplate -a full-scale
 military  confrontation    with  the   United
 States48  Rather, it plans to erode Ameri-
 can power in Asia through political means
 while simultaneously working toward the
 conditions under which it could regain So-
 viet support on its own terms.                 In the long
 run, it is through their influence over na-
 tional revolutionary parties and the major
 elements of the shaken Communist move-
 ment that Peiping's leaders hope to enhance
 China's global position.49
 Since February, Peiping's aim of discredit-
 ing American power in Asia has seemed
 closer to realization than ever. In particular,
 China's rulers have been able to capitalize
 on America's violent reaction to the crisis in
 South Vietnam. Throughout most of Asia
 they have assiduously spread the belief that
 in Vietnam the Americans are acting with
 brutal and unjustified violence against hap-
 less Asians.  Following the bombing raids,
 Peiping has ridiculed U.S. protestations of its
 peaceful aims in Asia, heaping scorn on So-
 viet Russia's advocacy of peaceful coexist-
 ence, and has gained further justification for
 its refusal to sign the nuclear test ban treaty
 and end its own nuclear program.  For as
 long as the raids continue without a military
 response from North Vietnam and without
 any sign of actual Chinese military Interven-
 tion, Peiping can expect that tli5e strains on
 the Soviet-American detente and the NATO
 alliance will intensify, while the American
 position in Asia will be undermined.  The
 State Department's white paper did little to
 counter  the Chinese  accusation  that the
 Johnson administration had acted irration-
 ally in order to conceal the iadequacies and
 failures of its program in South Vietnam.
 The Chinese have thus gained political ad-
 vantage from Hanoi's adversity.
 In contrast to their view at the time of
 the 1954 Geneva Conference, the Chinese now
 see how both their local and global objec-
 tives can be served by an intensified struggle
 against the United States in Vietnam.  The
 struggle for Vietnam could reduce Viet-
 namese "independence" in the Sino-Soviet
 dispute, insure North Vietnam's long-term
 dependence on China, and at the same time
 strengthen China's influence among not only
 other Communist regimes and parties, but
 also among non-Communist unalined na-
 tions in Asia and Africa; moreover, it could
 bring the security interests of China and the

 nese have not overlooked the possibility that
 further escalation might lead to an attack
 on China.  They have few illusions concern-
 ing the amount of damage that the United
 States could inflict on'their cities and ap-
 parently hope to confine the arena of actual
 fighting to Vietnam.  See Jen-min jihpao

 tensification of the war in Vietnam also pro-

 to eradicating the "revisionist" and even pro-

 U.B. GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
 These considerations underscore the argu-
 ment  that America's policies in Vietnam
 should conform to its global priorities.  It
 has long been recognized that we should not
 pursue measures likely to undermine our
 peaceful relationships with the Soviet Union,
 and our tacit agreement with Moscow on the
 containment of Chinese power.  Yet, the es-
 calation of violence begun last February has
 set in train reactions outside of Vietnam
 which run strictly contrary to our previously
 accepted global priorities.  This is the price
 we pay for our policy in Vietnam.
 V.S. NEGOTIATING S'rME14GTIIS
 If the United States desires .a peaceful set-
 tlement with Hanoi, various factors contrib-
 ute to a strong U.S. negotiating position.
 This position cannot be strengthened by fur-
 ther escalation of military pressure.  On the
 contrary, such action can only destroy or
 weaken this position and lose for the United
 States the opportunity of dealing primarily
 with Hanoi on essentially Vietnamese terms,
 rather than with Peiping on essentially Chi-
 nese terms.
 1. Common American and Soviet objectives
 in southeast Asia: The Soviet Union and the
 United States have as their fundamental aim
 in  southeast  Asia  the  restraint  of  Chi-
 nese influence in the area"  The new Soviet
 leaders have thus far resisted Chinese pres-
 sures toward greater militancy, and have con-
 tinued to place a high priority on Khru-
 shchev's international policies of peaceful
 coexistence and amicable relations with the
 United States.  Moscow apparently wishes to
 avoid risky commitments in southeast Asia,
 but does not want to lay itself open to Chi-
 nese propaganda by appearing to abandon
 any revolutionary movement.  Although the
 Soviet Union would have to be circumspect
 In approaching negotiations on Vietnam be-
 cause of the capital which China could draw
 from any apparent alinement between the
 Soviet Union and the United States, tacit So-
 viet opposition to China during.the negotia-
 tions would be of particular importance in
 encouraging Hanoi to take an independent
 stance.
 2. Hanoi's desire to remain independent
 of Peiping: Hanoi hopes to arrive at a settle-
 ment which will insure that all of Vietnam
 remains fully independent of China.  While
 the Government of North Vietnam seeks na-
 tional reunification, it does not want to see
 this achieved at the cost of dependence on
 China; moreover, Hanoi undoubtedly realizes
 that it would seriously damage its appeal to
 southerners if it even appeared to become
 dependent upon China.
 3. North  Vietnam's  economic  position:
 North Vietnam now relies much more on
 China than upon the Soviet Union for food,
 her most critical deficiency.  As noted above,
 if she were given an opportunity to trade
 with South Vietnam and secure a significant
 part of its rice exports for her industrial
 centers, she could both reduce her depend-

 and the Second Generation in Communist
 China," the China Quarterly, 21 (January-
 March 1965), pp. 126-147.
 s' Moscow, of course, would favor the ex-
 tension of Communist Influence in southeast
 Asia at our expense, although it would si-
 multaneously hope to prevent the extension
 of Chinese influence there.  It has faced a
 policy dilemma, therefore, because it has not
 been easy to separate pro-Chinese and pro-
 Communist tendencies in Asia.
 ence upon China and abandon her own ex-
 pensive and highly uneconomic efforts to
 grow food in marginally productive areas.
 Moreover, an end to the trade blockade of
 North Vietnam would benefit the country
 by enabling it to obtain items necessary for
 its further industrialization.  Given the con-
 tinuing increase of its population upon an
 unchanging base of arable land, such indus-
 trialization is a prerequisite for the eco-
 nomic development-and ultimately the eco-
 nomic  viability-of  the  North.   Further-
 more, the United States could stand ready
 to dispatch Public Law 480 rice, thereby per-
 mitting an immediate relief of Hanoi's de-
 pendence  upon Peiping,      and  to   include
 North Vietnam in plans for the economic de-
 velopment of southeast Asia.52
 4. War weariness: This factor is not only
 operative in the South, but also affects the
 North.  One should not underestimate the
 intense desire for an end of fighting and for
 family reunions, 2 which were important fac-
 tors even before the bombing began.
 5. The recognized threat to the use of
 greater military force: The North naturally
 wishes to  avoid  additional  damage  from
 U.S. air raids.  However, as the raids con-
 tinue, the North Vietnamese may be pushed
 ever closer to the conclusion that what re-
 mains to be protected in the North is no
 longer sufficient to outweigh the advantages
 accruing from striking southward.  Further,
 as long as the threat remains unrealized,
 we leave Hanoi in a tenable position from
 which to negotiate.
 If the United States is to derive maximum
 advantage from these negotiating strengths,
 it must give due weight to the political real-
 ities of the Vietnamese situation and recog-
 nize that these set limits for all parties.
 Even if the United States could win a deci-
 sive military victory in Vietnam, and even if
 this could be achieved without permanently
 antagonizing most of the Vietnamese people,
 these   political   realities   would   endure.
 Washington would still have to face most
 of the same problems which, since 1954, have
 obstructed the achievement of its objectives.
 Persistent questions remain to be answered
 by Washington.      Is the United States pre-
 pared to acknowledge the fact that most peo-
 ple in Vietnam-North and South-desire an
 end of the war and the reunification of their
 country?  If we accept these as legitimate
 aims, what would be our position if Hanoi
 agreed to a cease-fire and the withdrawal of
 infiltrators on the condition that the United
 States and Saigon would honor the provision
 of the Geneva accords calling for national
 elections-particularly if it also agreed that
 such elections should take place under U.S.
 auspices? 54  If a military truce were achieved,
 would the U.N. recognize that any political
 solution in the South enforceable by Hanoi
 must provide for some sort of grouping of
 regional authority    and   administration,
 whereby  substantial  areas would  remain
 under National Liberation Front control?
 52 This  possibility  was  foreshadowed in
 President Johnson's statement on Mar. 25,
 1965.  The United States could also agree to
 extend the projected Mekong River develop-
 ment plan to North Vietnam (see the article
 by Gilbert F. White in the December 1964
 Bulletin).  On Apr. 7, President Johnson ex-
 pressed his hope that following a peaceful
 settlement "North Vietnam will take its place
 in the common effort" for regional economic
 development (New York Times, Apr. 8, 1965).
 GI For  an  indication of  the  number  of
 divided families,  it  was reported that in
 Quangngai Province about 40 percent of the
 residents have relatives in North Vietnam or
 among the Vietcong (New York 'Times, Apr.
 13, 1964)..
 c. This would be in accordance with the
 United States own unilateral declaration at
 Geneva (see footnote 17 above).

 THE U.S. POSITION IN MID-APRIL
 What have been the consequences of the
 policy that the United States has been fol-
 lowing in Vietnam?            After more than 2
 months, the bombing raids above the 17th
 parallel have not resulted in any significant
 decrease in Vietcong activity in the south.
 Hanoi has consistently demanded that the
 United States abide by the Geneva accords,
 and at times has seemed to indicate its in-
 terest in negotiations.,  The National Lib-
 eration Front, on the other hand, has ex-
 pressed firm opposition to the Idea of nego-
 tiations, a position prominently supported
 by China "
 The United States, for its part, has ex-
 tended its bombing of the north, as well as
 the south, and his accelerated the rate of
 introduction of its combat forces into the
 south.  On April 7-, President Johnson, while
 Indicating that the United States was pre-
 pared                   for  "unconditional   discussions,"
 evinced no willingness to depart from previ-
 ous administration statements which had
 called for a reestablishment of the pre-1958
 status quo.  He made no proposal which
 could be expected to provide a realistic basis
 for negotiations.  In fact, the terms offered
 Hanoi call upon it to compel capitulation of
 the Vietcong.
 PROSPECTS FOR ESCALATION
 If the United States continues to increase
 its military punishment of North Vietnam,
 Hanoi 18 likely to send elements of its 300,000-
 man army south.  The decision to do this
 will presumably be made at the point when
 the United States has Inflicted so much dam-
 age on the North Vietnamese that they will
 01 Vo Nguyen Gfap, Hanoi's Minister of .
 National Defense, has given what may be re-
 garded as the initial bargaining position of
 the Hanoi government.  He stated that the
 United States must correctly implement the
 Geneva agreements and cease its acts of
 provocation against North Vietnam; also the
 United States must allow the Vietnamese
 people to settle the matter of reunification
 (Radio Hanoi, Mar. 10, 1965).  This consti-
 tuted an elaboration of,an earlier statement
 by the North Vietnamese Premier, Pham
 Van Dong, to A. N. Kosygin of the Soviet
 Union on Feb. 6, 1965 (Radio Hanoi, Feb. 8.
 1965).
 Throughout the period since the first
 bombings in February, Hanoi has requested
 "the two cochairmen and the governments
 of the participating countries of the 1954
 Geneva Conference on Indochina, the Social-
 ist countries, and all peaceloving countries in
 the world to take timely and effective actions
 aimed at staying the hands of the U.S. Im-
 perialist aggressors and warmongers, insur-
 ing strict implementation of the 1954 Geneva
 accords on Vietnam [and] defending peace
 In Indochina and southeast Asia" (Radio
 Hanoi, Feb. 8, 1965).
 62 On Feb.  14, for example, the Presi-
 dium of the Central Committee of the NLF
 "called on the entire army and people of
 South Vietnam to fight the enemy continu-
 ously and on all battlefields, fight more pow-
 erfully, wipe out more enemy forces, destroy
 many more strategic hamlets, urgently arm
 the entire people, endeavor to build and con-
 solidate the fighting hamlets and villagers,
 [and] urgently build and develop the armed
 forces" (Liberation Radio [Vietcong], as re-
 broadcast by Radio Hanoi, Feb. 15, 1965).
 While Hanoi continued to hark back to the
 Geneva accords and to demand action against
 the United States by the International Con-
 trol  Commission,  China  denounced  those
 bodies and echoed the Vietcong's hard line.
 Jen-min jih-pao on  Feb.  19 declared:
 "The Johnson administration. Is neither will-
 ing to accept defeat nor courageous enough
 to face the consequences of an extended war.
 * * * The aim of the Johnson administration
 is quite clear-to get at the conference table
 what it could not get on the battlefield."
 have little to lose by a retaliatory attack and
 little to save through compromise or negoti-
 ation.  Although we cannot predict with cer-
 tainty what kind of a military operation
 North Vietnam would attempt,  it seems
 likely that in view of America's vastly su-
 perior air and sea power, Hanoi would deploy
 its forces in ways whereby it would be least
 affected by that power.  It might, therefore,
 send its troops into South Vietnam as small,
 highly  mobile,   guerrilla   units0  These
 troops could enter the south all along the
 extensive, jungle-covered western Vietnamese
 border 64   The United States would still face
 an essentially guerrilla war, but on a vastly
 expanded scale.  The accepted and well-pub-
 licized formula that it takes 10 regular troops
 to counter each guerrilla would still apply;
 thus  for  each   100,000  men  the  Viet-
 namese introduced we would have to commit
 1 million.  The American public has hardly
 been prepared for such a high cost in Ameri-
 can lives and material as would be entailed
 in an effort of this magnitude.  Nor is It
 realistic to expect that, without some indi-
 cation that this effort would yield results
 commensurate with such sacrifice, the Ameri-
 can public could be brought to support it.
 During this phase of the fighting, China's
 armies could be expected to remain out of
 the conflict 65  though  Peiping would pre-
 sumably continue to supply heavy equip-
 ment, a few technicians, and possibly some
 volunteers.  But China  is  not  likely  to
 provide us with such clear invitation to at-
 tack her as would be given by her massive
 intervention in Vietnam.  By remaining be-
 hind her frontiers and restricting herself
 to providing     primarily moral support to
 Hanoi, China could gain tremendous politi-
 cal and psychological advantages from con-
 tinued U.S. attacks on the Vietnamese (al-
 though she would no doubt be uneasy about
 the possibility of American escalation spil-
 ling across her frontiers).
 Despite the care the Peiping leadership
 has taken in Vietnam to do nothing which
 might invite an American attack on the
 Chinese mainland, the United States may
 still choose to enlarge its theater of opera-
 tions to include China."'  A decision to do
 this would probably derive in part from the
 belief discussed above that Peiping contols
 Hanoi.  In addition, however, there is a not

 the fighting tactics, striking the enemy where
 and when he was least prepared and by
 methods  which  are  most  unexpected  to
 them."
 64 Given the possibility , of encountering
 massive American firepower, it could not, of
 course, be expected  that  North Vietnam
 would launch a massive frontal assault across
 the 17th parallel.
 03 Mao Tse-tung told Edgar Snow, before
 the February air strikes, that "China's armies
 would not go beyond her borders to fight.
 * * * Only  if, the United States attacked
 China would the Chinese fight."  Mao added
 that "The Vietnamese could cope with their
 [own] situation" (the New Republic  [Feb.
 27]  1965, p. 22).  Subsequently China has
 modified its position; see (67) below.
 66 An official Chinese Government state-
 ment of Mar. 12, 1965, commented on remarks
 in the U.T. press that China would not be
 allowed to remain a sanctuary, as it did in
 the Korean war.  It added: "In plain lan-
 guage, this means it [the United States]
 would bomb China" (Radio Peiping, Mar. 13,
 1965).

 insignificant group in America that feels that
 a war with China is inevitable and should be
 waged soon,  before  China  grows stronger
 and attains a real nuclear capacity.
 But once we attack China-even without
 nuclear weapons-the whole context of the
 American effort in Vietnam would be drasti-
 cally altered.                                                                                                               China would retaliate, and she
 has explicitly said that she would not con-
 fine herself to the areas of conflict In which
 the United States is presently engaged.  On
 February 9, 1965, for example, the Chinese
 Government declared:  "We warn U.S. Im-
 perialism: You are overreaching yourselves
 in trying to extend the war with your small
 forces in Indochina, southeast Asia, and the
 Far East.  To be frank, we are waiting for
 you In battle array." 6v   The Chinese have
 repeated this threat to engage our "small
 forces" on a vast front in "Indochina, south-
 east Asia, and the Far East," and have care-
 fully elaborated the "dire consequences" that
 would befall the U.S. forces involved 08
 There are at least 10 million people in
 China who are ethnically akin to the Thai,
 Lao, and Vietnamese.  We could expect that
 China would use these people-mss regular
 army troops or volunteers-in a greatly ex-
 panded guerrilla war in the jungles of south-
 east Asia.  Such a war would not require
 massive Chinese logistical support and would
 minimize the vulnerability of Chinese forces
 to American air and sea attack.  It would
 also present the United States with vastly
 greater difficulties than those it now faces in
 South Vietnam.  The possibility that China
 would use these minority peoples has been
 suggested by the intensive militia campaigns
 conducted with particular fervor in 1964 in
 Yunnan, Kwangsi, and Kwangtung-all Prov-
 inces which border southeast Asian states.
 The Chinese believe that the United States
 could not win this type of war and that
 thereby the credibility of American power
 would  be  destroyed  in  southeast  Asia.60
 As the Chinese probably envisage it, the war
 64 See Jen-min jih-pao, Feb. 9, 1965. Sim-
 ilar warnings were given during the subse-
 quent 8 weeks  On Mar. 25, China and Rus-
 sia both threatened to aid the Vietcong if
 the NLF so requested (Jen-min jih-pao, Mar.
 25, 1965).  These threats were made in re-
 sponse to a statement issued by Liberation
 Radio (Vietcong) on Mar. 23, that: "If the
 U.S. imperialists  continue to send  their
 troops and the troops of their satellites into
 South Vietnam or to expand the war to the
 North and Laos, the NLFSV will call on the
 world peoples to send troops."
 Peiping's threat to retaliate in Vietnam
 has been more direct and unambiguous than
 the one it made prior to entering the Korean
 war in 1950. Allen S. Whiting has observed,
 however, that "the problem of communicat-
 ing a threat Is formidable, and in the con-
 text of the Korean war It was especially dif-
 ficult"' (Whiting, "China Crosses the Yalu"
 [New York, 1960], p. 109).
 In the present crisis, Peiping has moved
 with great caution, as it did in 1950; but it
 has also attempted to strengthen the credi-
 bility of its threat to aid Vietnam by recalling
 its intervention in Korea.   For example,
 radio Peiping, Feb. 13, 1965, warned: "Your
 hope lies in making people afraid of you.
 But  you  [Americans]  will  become  ut-
 terly helpless when the people resisting ag-
 gression, instead of being afraid of you, dare
 to fight, defy difficulties, and advance wave
 upon wave.  You have been taught a lesson
 on this score in the Korean war.  Do you
 want to have the lesson repeated in Indo-
 china?"
 68 This was part of a thinly veiled Chinese
 effort to threaten the Philippines, Thailand,
 and the entire Indochinese peninsula.  See
 iri particular the broadcast of radio Peiping
 on Feb. 4, 1965, on the Thai patriotic front,
 and the Jen-min j1h-pao article of Jan. 27,
 1965, on the Philippines.

 DEAR MR. MORSE:  I Wish to take this op-
 portunity to express my appreciation for
 your fearless stand in denouncing U.S. par-
 ticipation in the Vietnam war.
 I have written letters favoring U.S. with-
 drawal to President Johnson and to Senators
 CARLSON and PEARSON, of Kansas.  I regret
 to state that none of these appear interested
 in ending the bloodshed.
 It appears that the militarists of our
 country are in control of the Government.  I
 feel this is a very dangerous situation and
 could likely end in disaster.  Someone has
 stated that the United States has the power
 to destroy the world but not to conquer it.
 I do hope you continue to have the cour-
 age to speak out fearlessly against those who
 entertain the idea that world problems can
 be solved by military might, destruction and
 bloodshed.

 DEAR SIR: Just as an old fashioned Amer-
 ican, I want to commend you for having
 nerve enough to come out in the open and
 tell the public what you, think about South
 Vietnam.
 As I understand'it the Congress alone has
 the power to declare war.  This has not been
 done by the Congress, yet we are in a war
 in South Vietnam by Executive action.  We
 have also gone into Santo Domingo with
 more troops than are necessary.
 I think the sooner we abandon the Ides,
 that we have a right to dictate to other na-
 tions the kind of government they ought to
 have, it will be better for us.
 But aside from this the man on the street,
 on the farm and everywhere knows that if
 the present trend of Government spending
 and Government interference with the affairs
 of other nations continue, that it will be
 just a matter of time when we will close our
 own present form of government and go
 socialistic or communistic.
 So far as I am concerned personally, since
 I am 79 years old, it dons not mean so much
 to me, but it means a lot to my children and
 grandchildren.
 Again. I want to commend you.

 DEAR    . PRESmRNT: When I voted for you
 in 1964,'I did so because I believed you were
 mincerely for peace, and Senator Goldwater
 had made it abundantly clear that he was
 not.  At the same time, many of us hoped
 that your election would serve notice on the
 followers  of Senator  Goldwater  that  the
 great majority, of the American people was
 fed up with McCarthyism and the blight
 it cast over our Nation for so many years.
 I have read your most recent statements
 on Vietnam and the situation in the Domini-
 can Republic with some care and have con-
 eluded that your decision to accelerate the
 War in Vietnam is worthy of Senator Gold-
 water.. Further, mixing into the affairs of the
 Dominicans  ,to stop a Communist con-
 spiracy" sounds just like McCarthyism, even
 bo playing the despicable numbers game-
 but on an international scale.  How, then,
 does your position differ from Senator Gold-
 water's or the late Senator McCarthy's?

 DEAR SIR: Keep up your speeches against
 the war in Vietnam.  I feel that you are
 speaking not only for the people of Oregon,
 but for the people of California and the
 whole United States. We must not have an-
 other Korea, or even worse, a World War III
 because of the inability of the U.S. Gov-
 ernment to admit to its past mistakes and
 change course.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:                                         It is amazing that
 the popularity and poll conscious President
 has paid no heed to the most important and
 most-accurate poll, the election of November
 3, 1964.

 DEAR SENATOR: Thank you for your excel-
 lent speech at Union College on May 4, 1965.
 Please continue your sane policy on Near
 Eastern affairs and do what you can to pur-
 suade others to join before it is too late.
 Mrs. NED FREUND,

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR: I congratulate you on Your
 strong stand in your Senate address of last
 Monday blasting our Vietnam policy-and
 calling for the- resignations of McNamara and
 Rusk.
 Our Government seems to have forgotten
 the word "Sovereignty."  Each nation should
 have sovereignty-to decide what kind of
 government they want, even if that be com-
 munism.  If we have made perpetual way
 against communism we have a long, bloody,
 and losing fight ahead of us.
 Communism is not a cause.  It is a result
 of poverty,  inequality,  oppression,  ignor-
 ance.  The more people waste in war, the
 more poverty and hence cause for commun-
 ism.
 If we really want to get rid of communism,
 we should find a road to peace-then slowly
 but surely build a more prosperous world.
 This is the one and only safeguard against
 communism.
 I have a feeling that most of the have-not
 nations will go through a stage of commun-
 ism until they find some measure of pros-
 perity, then they will turn slowly to a free
 enterprise system-s Russia is now doing.
 We are doing the same thing in Santo
 Domingo-trying to dominate their Govern-
 ment.  The radio just stated that President
 Johnson was asking for $700 million for mili-

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  I have such great
 admiration for you that I can't express it.
 I am truly dismayed by our Government's
 criminal policy in foreign affairs.
 Is there anything ordinary people can do?
 I've  written  to  President  Johnson  very
 strongly stating my beliefs-and to HUBERT
 HUMPHREY-and       the  California Senators.
 I've sent Western Union's POM's by the
 dozen.  All this seems to be futile.
 Most    Americans  do  not    support  this
 trumped-up war in Vietnam-and lots of us
 are ashamed of the United States.       And yet,
 like it or not, the war continues and grows.
 Is there anything that could be done to
 help to get us out of Vietnam where we have
 no business to be?
 I wish we could have a man like you for
 President-I'm sure this also is too much to
 hope for,
 If I can do any good, any way, let me .
 know.
 Respectfully,
 Mrd. EVE BYRON WYATT.
 STAMFORD, CONN.,
 May 6,1965.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: God bless you.   May
 you function as a Senator until you are 110.
 I only wish I had the privilege of voting
 for you.
 As a liberal Democrat I have always been
 proud that as a whole our party has cared
 for the common man.  What is happening
 to our Government?   Where  Is the Senate
 and the House?  Our President is operating
 the country like a one-man show in the area
 of foreign relations-it is not quite wartime
 yet.  Sometimes I worry that the Republic-
 ans will espouse the cause of peace but they
 are probably too stupid.
 . If I were a woman I would cry nights about
 our foreign policy.  As you know the in-
 spiration for the freedom of the Latin Amer-
 ican countries came from the examples set
 by us and France.    Why is it that over the
 whole course of history we have never sided
 with the common man down there?  All the
 most rotten dictators (no matter how much
 he has abridged individual rights under law)
 down there has to say is "We hate Commies"
 or "Commies are behind the plot" and we load
 him up with money, guns, and anything else.
 Historically the percentage of Commies in
 Latin America is nil.  But at the rate our
 Government is going we will breed them
 down there faster than fleas.
 Our history in South Vietnam is just as
 bad, but this letter is long enough.
 Let's get out of Latin America and South
 Vietnam now.
 You and the few that side with you in Con-
 gress have a lonely fight.  I am sure you and
 your small group are being pressured to
 conform with the sick honey being spread
 around by administration aides to justify our
 unjustifiable foreign policy.
 Don't weaken!  Don't give up the fight!
 3on't let anybody muzzle you!
 Republican newspaper, the Arizona Repub-
 lie.   Therefore,  little,  if  any,  coverage is
 given the minority opinions in Congress on
 such disasters as Vietnam and our present
 incredible national policy in Latin America.
 From brief news broadcasts on the net-
 works, I gather you are once again one of
 the few with courage and wisdom enough to
 question the administration's actions.
 We can't vote for you, of course, but I want
 to let you know we are grateful for your be-
 ing in the U.S. Senate.  Please do what you
 can  to  tell  your colleagues  our  present
 recklessness will do more to further inter-
 national communism than almost anything
 we could do.
 Sincerely,

 DEAR       SENATOR  MORSE:  Please  know  that
 there are many who are anti-Communists
 and who  nonetheless       applaud  your  great
 courage  in  criticizing  the  astonishingly
 brutal foreign policy of our President.

 DOWNEY, CALIF.,
 May 5, 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Attached is a copy
 of a letter to the Secretary of State propos-
 ing a course of conduct by the United States
 in South Vietnam.  I do not purport to be
 any sort of an expert on the problems there.
 But it seems to me that we are hopelessly
 engaged there in what could easily become,
 at the least, a major disaster, and, at the
 worst, a world holocaust.
 The proposal would have the effect, I would
 hope, of stabilizing the South Vietnam mili-
 tary, political, economic, and social situa-
 tion.                                                                    If it did not achieve this, it would
 allow the United States to withdraw under
 honorai 1e circumstances.
 A letter similar to this is going to several,
 of your colleagues.   Your consideration is
 appreciated.
 Very truly yours,
 PAUL COOKSEY,
 Attorney at Law.
 DOWNEY, CALIF.,
 May 5, 1965.
 Hon. DEAN RUSK,
 Secretary of State, State Department,
 Washington, D.C.
 MY DEAR MR. SECRETARY: The purpose Of
 this letter is to propose a course of action
 with respect to South Vietnam that would
 have the following objectives:
 1. Limit the duration of American military
 participation and assistance.
 2. Disengage American prestige now com-
 mitted in South Vietnam.
 3. Forestall the entry of China and Russia
 into the conflict.
 4. Promote economic, social and political
 reforms in South Vietnam.
 5. Promote a viable, stable political gov-
 The proposal is that the United States an-
 nounce that it will continue all military
 assistance to South Vietnam for 1 more year
 ending July 1, 1966, but will discontinue all
 military assistance after that date as quickly
 as it can be withdrawn.
 The  1-year commitment  is  conditional,
 however, as follows:
 (a) That there will be no land invasion
 north of the 17th parallel.
 (b) That certain economic reforms, prin-
 oipally dealing with the ownership and dis-
 tribution of land, be initiated  in South
 Vietnam.
 9545
 (c) That political equality be established.
 (d) That a stable political government be
 formed  and  further  military  coups   be
 abandoned.
 If these conditions are  met, then  the
 United States would further commit itself
 to a program of substantial economic assist-
 ance to South Vietnam in order to help its
 economic development  and    maintain  its
 political stability.
 Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your con-
 sideration of this proposal.
 Very truly yours,
 PAUL COOKSEY,
 Attorney at Law.

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: We urge you to re-
 fuse the unneeded extra defense appropria-
 tion President Johnson is demanding as a
 proof of congressional loyalty.
 We are appalled at America's nakedly ag-
 gressive  policies  in  Vietnam  and  in  the
 Dominican Republic. We utterly reject the
 cynical excuses of the   administration.
 Liberty is not defended by supporting op-
 pressive  governments;  communism     is not
 defeated by brutally crushing    a rebellion
 sparked by genuine grievances.   And self-
 determination either means exactly that or
 nothing at .all.
 At home Mr. Johnson has been ruthlessly
 gutting the democratic process.  Honest re-
 porters, concerned citizens, and a few coura-
 geous and outspoken Senators such as your-
 self have all been made to seem disloyal.
 When will the witch hunt begin?
 Thank you for your magnificent stand in
 the face of enormous executive pressure.
 Sincerely,
 Mr. and Mrs. RAYMOND D. GILBERT.

 America's prestige, good name, and sover-
 eignty which we once possessed but unfor-
 tunately lost by now, by our foolish behavior.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I would like to thank
 you for your forthright and courageous po-
 sition for calling publicly for a moratorium
 on the bombing of North Vietnam and for
 greater efforts towards negotiations.  It seems
 clear that this is the overwhelming senti-
 ment of all Americans, and it is to express
 this view that the original of the enclosed

 Johnson by a, large number of extremely
 active members of the Democratic party in
 Boulder County, Colo.  We are sending this
 to you to indicate the kind of support your
 stand has obtained; you will notice, for ex-
 ample, that there are many precinct com-
 mittee men and women, as well as three
 members of the Colorado Democratic State
 central committee, among the signatories.

 APRIL 21, 1965.
 President LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: As active Democratic
 precinct captains, block workers, and inde-
 pendent Republicans who worked enthusi-
 astically for you during many long hours
 of the 1964 campaign, we would like,to ex-
 press our deep concern regarding your Viet-
 nam policy, which seems to us not only to
 be morally wrong, but, politically, to be sheer
 suicide for the Democratic Party.
 Boulder County, Colo., is normally a Re-
 publican county,  and  yet a  clear victory
 went to you in November.  It is our strong
 belief, based on hundreds of conversations
 while ringing doorbells and doing precinct
 work, that the many independents and Re-
 publicans who voted for you did so because
 of the fear of Barry Goldwater as a trigger-
 happy candidate who intended to defoliate
 the jungles, bomb the villages, and generally
 extend the war In Vietnam and even beyond.
 The statement of one elderly Republican
 widow, who lives alone in a modest frame-
 house, is typical of the thoughts of most
 Americans at the time of the election.  When
 approached by the Democratic block worker,
 she said: "I am a lifelong Republican, but I
 will never vote for Goldwater, and I don't see
 how any American mother could.   I have
 grown children and small grandchildren, and
 I don't want us to get into another war.
 Goldwater, would get us in, but President
 Johnson will keep us out."
 Mr. President, the sentiment of the mil-
 lions of Americans who gave you the vast
 majority  of  votes  in  November  has  not
 changed.  The war In Vietnam Is the most
 unpopular war In American history, for the
 American people know that it is wrong. It is
 even more unpopular than the Korean war,
 and it was the promise to settle that one
 which elected Dwight Eisenhower In 1952.
 It becomes increasingly hard for us to look
 squarely at our friends and neighbors whom
 we had told in November: "The Democrats
 are not the war party."  It will be impossible,
 ever again, to conviizce the electorate of this
 fact, if the bombings and the acceleration of
 the war are not stopped immediately, and
 if some basis for negotiations is not found.
 We are convinced that your astute and
 wise thinking can bypass conventional di-
 plomacy, as represented by the many men
 in the  State Department who  have  been
 committed for too long to a Dulles' policy,
 and that you personally can find an imagina-
 tive and honorable way to peace in Vietnam.

 DEAR WAYNE:  We, the people, are back of
 you 100 percent;  we listen to your every
 word.
 We know,we did vote for L.B.J., but we are
 sorry, for our President is a warmonger, and
 is not a man to be trusted; in fact he should
 be recalled, as well as a, few others I could
 mention.
 Please do not let the warmongers scare
 you but stick to your guns and give them
 hell, Truman style.
 I know that for today a vote against L.B.J.
 was would win by a big majority by the
 common man of the United States.
 President Johnson is setting a bad example
 to the American people by his breaking his
 promises, when he was running for election,
 and he knows it.

 You have helped me keep my self-respect.

 and I'm behind you 100 percent.  We are
 wrong there and we are, if possible, wronger
 in the Dominican Republic.  I can't under-
 stand how a nation can condemn Soviet ac=
 tion in Hungary then turn right around and
 repeat that very action they condemn.  It
 is becoming pretty hard to hold my head up
 and proudly say "I'm an American" today.

 way was always right.
 be expressed and respected by the admin-
 istration in administration decisions.  The
 most  enlightened  opinion  in American
 classes and categories is In the academic
 community. Who does Mr Rusk think he is
 besides a guardian of the corporate Inter-
 ests of America, and beyond the reach of the
 people's influence?
 We spend vast sums on higher education
 and then permit a corporate-minded man
 like Mr. Rusk to discredit the product.  The
 books being written by the so-called intel-
 lectuals of the State Department at the
 public's expense, are largely propaganda.
 The Senate is the branch of Government
 invested with the responsibility to declare
 war,  We are in war which the Senate has
 not declared and only a handful of Sena-
 tors have the understanding or guts to pro-
 test.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Let me again thank
 you  warmly  for  your  courageous  stand
 against the war In Vietnam. The conditions
 that the President lays down before he will
 negotiate demand that the opponents submit
 to him in advance.  They will not do it.
 Therefore he is tying himself to a scorched
 earth policy and will gain the enmity of all
 Asia.  Africa will ally themselves with Asia.
 And already the European nations are ob-
 jecting.                     If we brush aside world opinion,
 we had better stop wasting our money on
 propaganda,
 It is all such folly.  Thank you for being
 not a follower but a leader.
 Yours sincerely,
 RICHARD B. GREGG.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: It is certainly true
 that we live in a most complex world and it
 becomes Increasingly difficult to  chart a
 course In, it.  As we attempt to chart our
 course the direction of our foreign policy
 becomes of dire Importance.
 One of our continued vexing problems Is
 that of Vietnam.  Your stand has been most
 courageous and perceptive.  My wife and I
 and many of our friends support you whole
 heartedly.
 The recent action of our country in the
 sending of troops to the Dominican Republic
 gives us great concern.  The action of our
 country bears an uneasy semblance to the
 action of Russia in deciding on the type of
 government of the satellite countries.  A
 fear of communism canot cause us to violate
 the national sovereignty of other countries.
 Law and order and mutual respect can never
 )e "second" to national interest.
 Perhaps it is to the best interests of our
 ration and of the world if Congress would
 efuse to give the additional money to the
 tiiltary budget.
 As you exercise your influence in the lead-
 ship of our country we pray God to con-
 nue to illumine and direct you.
 Sincerely,

 DEAR SENATOR: You do not stand alone iii
 your brave stand against the Vietnam ware
 which only continues because many people
 including the President, and his two war-
 hawks-McNamara,  and Rusk-think  that
 America is the only Nation that does right.
 We college students know better. A1-
 though I may be speaking with ideals rather
 than realities In my mind, I think the time
 has come when America should allow every
 country-right or wrong, pro-American or
 anti-American-to decide for itself whirl}
 type of government it wishes to live with,

 I am sure that if there were a couple of

 Unfortunately few have the moral strength
 nowadays, the ability, willingness to consider
 our actions with a humanitarian point of
 view.

 Yes, we go to church, at least many of us
 do, under a mantle of humble Christianity,
 but a closer look will reveal ugliness to the
 bottom of our souls, and hands dripping with
 blood.
 Our President before the election gave us
 plenty of peaceful promises, and now look
 what he is doing.  I wonder if Goldwater
 would have been any worse.
 If there is a law for gangsters, why not
 applying in this case?  This concerns not
 only our country, but the entire world.
 Have we become the boss? The police of
 the globe?  This is the best way to get the

 We, participants in the St. Louis Rally for
 Peace in Vietnam, on April 21, 1968
 Do urge the U.S. Government to end the
 bombing of North Vietnam, and to agree to
 an immediate cease-fire by all forces;
 Do urge the President of the United States
 to extend his agreement to enter into discus-

 sented;
 Do urge- the Congress of the United States,
 and each Senator and Representative in-
 dividually, to consider seriously their con-

 and to consider these in the light of the
 enormous destructiveness of modern nuclear
 weapons.
 We do, further-

 States for his offer of major economic aid to
 such multilateral projects as that of develop-
 ing the Mekong Basin;
 Congratulate those Senators who have had

 FRN and MORSE;
 Congratulate the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
 whose columnists and editors have presented

 urgency to express by telegrams and letters
 to the President of the United States and to
 Members of Congress their support for these
 resolutions;
 Recommend that individuals make every
 effort to keep themselves informed about
 events in southeast Asia;

 MY DEAR SENATOR: Like most people I am
 deeply confused and concerned regarding
 Vietnam, and like some, I have a few nag-
 ging thoughts as to the validity of our entry
 into South Vietnam.
 In a recent correspondence with Dr. Linus

 I would appreciate it very much if you
 would do so.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  Just a note to ex-
 press my heartfelt thanks to you for your
 courageous stand against President Johnson's
 policy In Vietnam,  Every fiber in my being
 tells me that this policy is wrong-dead-
 wrong, and that.somehow it must be re-
 directed before it Is too late.
 McCarthyism as, applied to domestic af-
 fairs can at best destroy a country; as applied
 to world affairs, can destroy the whole world.
 It can destroy for keeps: Shakespeare, Bee-
 thoven, Jesus, Jefferson, Confucius, Emerson,
 and on and on.  Eotnehow our country, must
 get out of this stupid ideological rut it is in
 and come up with some real answers to the
 terrible problems facing mankind.
 I am 38 years old, and for just about as
 long as I can remember taking any note of
 public affairs,  the  personage  of  WAYNE
 MORSE has been on the scene.     There are, I

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Since the McCarthy

 principles of individualism professed but ab-

 this independence been vital than than in
 the Vietnamese war.  As John Kenneth Gail-
 braith hinted in the New York Times, the ad-
 ministration clings to its stupid, hopeless
 bombing policies not to save this Nation, but
 to save the reputations of blundering bu-
 reaucrats who, rather than admit they were
 wrong, are not magnifying their errors in the
 vain hope that more of a bad thing will some-
 how  prove  good.  From  Adlat  Stevenson
 through moral mediocrities like- Dean Rusk,
 the administration's yes men are pretending
 not to notice the odor.  Thank you for de-

 If Congress refuses to finance it it will die
 a natural death, and that will be that. Why
 should we lay all our boys on the alter to
 be butchered by war, when we do not own
 a foot of ground in Vietnam?
 For whom is this war being fought? Cer-
 tainly no common man stands to gain any-
 thing but death over there.  Stop this war
 and put a new law on the books that no war
 can be declared or. fought unless the people
 of the United States represented by the Con-
 gress in Washington give their consent, and
 unless the people are willing to finance it.
 Cut our income taxes so the Government
 don't have so much money to throw away
 on moon flights and war 'on the whole world,
 and lets give the elderly people a decent
 home and a chance to give their property to
 their children, as the Bible plainly teaches.
 Let's raise our voices against "murder in-

 Duponts and we are the fools who suffer

 COLLEGE AT BROCKPORT,
 Brockport, N.Y., April 26, 1965.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Congratulations on
 your continuing fight to maintain free dis-
 cussion of our foreign policy in the Senate.
 Our war in Vietnam is immoral and unin-
 telligent.  Might it not be called the policy
 of Henry Cabot Lodge, the jingoist son of a
 jingoist father?
 May I humbly suggest, however, that in
 your continuing debate you accent more the
 unintelligence of our policy than its im-
 morality; how we have wedded ourselves to
 an image in the Far East of a 20th century
 Metternich, defending the plutocratic in-
 heritors of the ancient regime against all re-
 spectable movements toward national self-
 realization.  In a sense have we not been
 imitating  British  19th  century  policy  in
 India, cementing our power by making deals
 with the maharajahs and nabobs?  Isn't it
 true that the patriots of Vietnam who lib-
 erated their country from the French went
 north, leaving the south to the rich and
 titled natives of Saigon, who had prospered
 under the French?
 Why do we do this and why do we con-
 tinue to do this, not only in Vietnam but
 around the world?  This fundamental ques-
 tion must be faced; it is the background
 question and Vietnam is only an incident.
 Another fundamental element in our diffi-
 culties is that we are caught in a dilemma
 between two foreign policies: (1) coexistence
 with communism and (2)  containment of
 ummunism.  One way out of this dilemma
 s to, return to the policy that preceded our
 ntry into World War II, that is, a policy
 gainst imperialism, against Japanese uni-
 Lteral conquest of the Far East and German
 nd Italian ditto of Europe.
 Where the Communists are Imperialistic
 e must check them.  On the `other hand,
 here spontaneous national uprisings em-
 oy Communist weapons and advice, we
 Ive no clear call to intervene. Shouldn't
 3 ask why these national uprisings do not
 rn to us for assistance?  I suggest the an-
 'er is that we have been willing to do bust-
 ness with the reactionary regimes which the
 rebels wish to supplant.  Our policy has been
 cynical in this respect and even worse it has
 been lazy and naive.      We haven't had the
 energy to mount an effort to export our brand
 of progress to the rising suppressed classes
 of the world.  (Peace Corps is an exception.)
 Not having an ideology to export or a pro
 gram, we have inevitably resorted to force-
 money, then fleets and air forces, now the
 marines.     Tomorrow what?
 The big thing that keeps American public
 opinion uneasily but still effectively behind
 the Johnson policy is very simple to identify.
 It is the fear that if we retreat from Vietnam
 all of southeast Asia will go Communist,
 perhaps even India. In my mind no counter
 argument will go very far unless we recog-
 nize this fear.  It is a pervasive fear and
 not a totally unreasonable one.  How do
 we quiet this fear?  I suggest that the way
 to quiet the fear is to face it.  Admit it.  Let
 us suppose that our disengagement from
 Vietnam is followed shortly by the emer-
 gence of Communist allied governments in
 South Vietnam, in Cambodia; and that the
 Malaysian will to resist Indonesia is weak-
 ened.  Also let us suppose India feels driven
 into the Chinese orbit.
 We must honestly face the consequences
 of this assumedly real possibility.  What are
 these consequences?  I suggest that they are
 no real threat to our security for these rea-
 sons: (1) The nations of southeast Asia are
 economically and militarily weak.  (2) They
 will remain so for decades to come.   (3) By
 turning to China they will merely aggravate
 their weakness by frustration.   China is too
 poor to be of any real help.  After the hys-
 teria  of  nationalism  and                                                                  anticolonialism
 has spent itself, and the wine of independ-
 ence has been drunk to the dregs, isn't it
 highly probable that quietly, one by one,
 these countries will seek our aid and to some
 extent at least come back into our orbit?
 Some will say that my reasoning is that
 of a neolsolationist.  I disagree.  I think
 rather it is that of a sober, intelligent, and
 moral internationalist.   I envision as the
 goal toward which this troubled but very
 dynamic and creative century is moving is
 a "planetary federation of states." This goal
 cannot be reached by imposition; that was
 the old way of the Pax Romanum.  Indeed,
 all efforts on the part of particular great
 powers to impose a planetary order must be
 resisted, including our own.  Rather, the
 planetary peace must be voluntarily arrived
 at, by the free will and the increasing coop=
 eration of all the member states of  this
 planet.   This can  only come if the sup
 pressed states achieve freedom, self-deter-
 mination, and the direction of their affairs
 by themselves.  We want no puppet states
 in the United Nations, or in any greater
 unifying organization that will succeed it.
 I despise negativity, but I must confess
 that I fear I smell war in the air.  Just al';
 the events of the late thirties-Ethiopia and
 Spain and all that-were preceded by the
 weakening of the League of Nations, so the
 current affair in Vietnam is accompanied by
 a great and ominous silence in the United
 Nations; 1914-39-exactly 25 years; 1939-64-
 exactly 25 years.  The militarists have been
 rehearsing their war too long.   They seek
 to perform;  they seek catharsis in action.
 Perhaps one telling weapon against John-'
 son is to accuse him of gross irresponsibil-
 ity, of launching on an aggressive policy
 without first equipping the country with
 bomb shelters.  That ought to get that politi-
 cian where it hurts.  In any case, I am sure
 that it will do no good in this fight to be
 merely morally indignant.   We must be
 calm, deadly logical, insultingly intelligent.
 We must also-demonstrate.
 This letter has, I am afraid, turned- into
 a lecture.  In closing, I want to stress my
 uniqualifled approval of your position, and
 express my encouragement and support.  I
 9549
 am a professor in a college community of
 over 2,000 students and teachers.  I think
 one can take hope from the situation here.
 Although the milieu is mentally very middle
 class and most of the students and faculty,
 I am afraid also, are from small towns in
 western New York, only the few hotheads are
 as yet beginning to vibrate to the escalated
 verbiage of the Johnson mouthpieces like
 Long.  Most are puzzled and perplexed, and
 confess woeful ignorance of just what it is
 all about. In short, I do not yet believe
 we have gone over the dam.

 My DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I wish to con-
 tribute to the long list of letters that I
 know you have received commending you
 for your courageous and intelligent stand
 on the Vietnam affair.
 The administration's "policy" if such it
 may be called is not enlightened from the
 point of view of the American people and
 certainly not enlightened or fair to the peo-
 ple  of  Vietnam.  You  are  exactly  right.
 The strife in that war-torn country is a
 civil war and since when has it become
 wrong for a people to strive to right their
 wrongs. Certainly we did it. The docu-
 ment Which marked the beginning of our
 national existence is the Declaration of In-
 dependence.      The right of revolution is set
 for in it. I have been very attentive to it and
 that position of the Declaration is never
 quoted any more.  It is, however, the history
 of things that when a people has reached
 the seat of the high and the mighty that
 they become indifferent or even oppose the
 efforts of others to improve their lot.
 I agree with you that Johnson should
 dismiss Rusk and McNamara..  They are all
 mixed up in their own mental aberations.
 Thanks a lot for your courageous stand.
 With great respect, I am,
 Sincerely yours,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I am appalled at the
 position this Government has taken in both
 Santo Domingo and Vietnam in the use of
 arms and the spreading,of war and its atro-
 cities.
 The use of American troops for interven-
 ing in the affairs of a foreign government is
 both contrary to the United Nations Charter,
 which we have pledged to uphold, and our
 beliefs in democracy.
 I urge you to use your good efforts and
 office to stop this policy.
 I regret to state that at present I am
 ashamed to be an American citizen.

 DEAR PRESIDENT JOHNSON:  I was shocked
 to see that you sent our marines to the
 Dominican Republic.
 In Vietnam, it seems as though our policy
 is up a blind alley, and your escalation of
 the war may very well be heading us, all
 toward  a  nuclear. holocaust.   When the
 Buddhist monks died in flames.   They were
 martyrizing themselves to stop the spread of
 the war; if we and our children go up in

 depreciatory labels.  I am shocked that a
 man of RUSSELL LONG'S obvious intelligence
 should stoop to such rhetorical stupidities.
 One wonders if, by Longian logic it does
 not follow that, since Bogalusa and the KKK
 are prominent phenomena in the headlines
 these days related to Louisiana, and since
 Senator LONG is also associated with Louisi-
 ana, that he is a Bogalusa member of the
 KKK.  (The principle of the Longian logic
 I am relying on is: every part of everything
 that makes the  newspapers  is fully  and
 accurately represented in the headlines about
 the same.)
 You and I will not invariably agree on
 other important matters, but we certainly
 agree perfectly on this one, find I am very
 grateful that I and many who think like
 me have such an able and clear-thinking
 spokesman on Capitol Hill.  Next year, when
 I move to Missouri, I will still be a strong
 backer Of your stand (and a strong opponent
 of Senator LONG) despite the fact that my
 vote will not count for or against either of
 you.  My vote in 1988 may very well count
 against  the  bunch  Johnson,  McNamara,
 Rusk, Bundy and company, however.

 DEAR SIR: I'm writing in support of your
 courageous stand in opposition to the Gov-
 ernment's policy in Vietnam. Being a Demo-
 crat of long standing, I cannot help but feel
 concern over our actions which are promoted
 by our President and his Cabinet. Mr. John-
 son speaks so nice about his dreams, but I
 and many, many people are beginning to
 have nightmares.  We have two sons.  Each
 one at 18 years went to separate wars at the
 end of high school. We were then hoping it
 would not have to happen again.  But it
 seems dreams are just that.  Should we
 dream our way through Vietnam?  I'm sure
 we will wake up having lost not only Asia
 but a good deal of the rest of the friends we
 now have.
 Sincerely yours,
 PORTLAND, OREG.,

 DEAR MR. MORSE: When you came to Port-
 land to debate on Vietnam, I was there to see
 you. I want you to know that I support you
 100 percent on every view you' hold on Viet-
 nam.             i was so engrossed with your speech
 : sent a registered to President Johnson
 expressing my views fully.  Why can't there
 ie some harsh action taken quickly to stop
 his war?  I will keep protesting the admin-
 stration's policy on Vietnam as long as we
 ave a "warmonger President in the White
 House."  Well, I must close
 the good work.
 Sincerely yours,
 now.  Keep up
 EUGENE, OREG.,
 April 26, 1965.
 DEAR  SENATOR  MORSE:  I was greatly in
 agreement with your speech at the University
 of Oregon.  I hope your views that we should
 cease fire in Vietnam will reach as many as
 possible.
 I should like to protest the war in Vietnam
 on the following grounds:
 1. Brutality:  The war seems to be carried
 out against the people.  I feel morally re-
 sponsible for this cruelty and should like to
 end it.  There seems to be a parallel between
 the United States in 1965 and Germany in
 1939.
 2. Effectiveness: We cannot justify our ac-
 tions on this ground.  The majority of the
 people there hate America.  With some jus-
 tification.  The strategies of Mao seem to
 be more effective, and yet we refuse to learn
 from him.
 3. Opinions of others: The majority of the
 world does not share our perspective in In-
 dochina.  To be seen as an aggressor by
 a large part of the world is surely of some im-
 portance.  We are continually losing face.
 4. Coexistence:  We  must face  the fact
 that we must share this planet with others
 who are different in religion, government, and
 belief.  This elementary fact must be ac-
 cepted by those who would turn to aggres-
 sion.                                                                             Warhare Is no longer a solution to
 these differences.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:                              I want to tell you
 how impressed and gratified I was with your
 part in the debate with PROxHIRE on Viet-
 nam.  You succeeded in converting to your
 point of view everyone in our party, includ-
 ing some who had voted for Goldwater in the
 last election.  It's a tribute to your powers
 of persuasion as well as to the justness of
 your cause.  It's a pity and a disgrace that
 the Oregonian can't do the public the favor
 of adequately reporting your statements.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: This letter is to let

 an immediate ceasefire in Vietnam.  I also
 appreciate your part in the protest held at
 the University of Oregon last Friday night
 and hope that your optimism about the de-
 gree to which the President will heed the
 growing concern and protest of our policy
 and action in Vietnam will prove justified.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have felt for some-
 time that we were straying from one of the
 basic premises of our country-namely, that
 the people, if given the facts, are capable of
 reaching sound  conclusions.  The  lack of
 distribution of such facts and the misrepre-
 sentation of information given us, as seems
 so common in Washington these days, is
 greatly  disturbing.  If  our governmental
 leaders  have  assumed this premise to be
 partially or totally false then we are living
 in something other than a free country.
 It was gratifying to hear you during your
 recent appearance in Portland for many rea-
 sons, the above included.  I, in general, sup-
 port your views on the Vietnam situation
 and appreciate your honesty in discussing
 the various aspects involved.  A valid con-
 clusion cannot possibly be drawn from in-
 correct information.  I find It easier to ac-
 cept your statements than those of our pres-
 ent administration.

 country-after so much mish-mosh on radio
 and TV.  It was a real relief to my soul to
 hear plaintalk, blunt talk and hard talk
 about our U.S. policy in Vietnam.
 Such fairy tales are presented in our pa-

 all night vigil and its many fine participants
 won't get Eugene on the move.

 , April 25? 1965.
 told, are now urging all members to write
 to the President in his support.
 A local newspaper column, conducted by
 George Todt In the Los Angeles Herald-Ex-
 aminer, today comes out for support of the
 President,  I am enclosing the article for
 your reference.  It was clipped from page
 C-3, issue of April 27.  Tedt has consistently
 supported   all  Birch   candidates  and. has
 praised the patriotism of Birch members.
 He favors Joe Shell (a defeated Republican
 candidate) on all issues.  He opposes Sena-
 tor  KUCHEL.                                                                                   He attacked Rockefeller day
 after day for his leftwing radicalism.   He
 hopes to elect Ronald Reagan as U.S. Senator
 in place of Senator KUCHEL.  I cite this since
 you may have not way of placing Todt.     I
 am sending a copy to Senator KucHEL who
 knows Todt's work and can read the column
 for himself.
 While it would be. an oversimplification to
 say that what the Birch Society wants is
 automatically wrong, there is enough truth
 in such an idea to give some of us courage
 to speak up In the Vietnam situation.
 As you well know, Americans are very un-
 popular around the world.  It hurts to have
 one's foreign host explain to other guests
 that although you are an American, you are
 not typical-that you are in fact reasonable.
 This is what our present policies (supposedly
 based on the Truman doctrine) have done
 for us.
 I believe with Walter Lippmann that we
 can oppose any popular uprising anywhere
 on the grounds that we do so for the con-
 tainment of communism-whether such is
 the case or not-and end up being right.
 For, as he says, wherever we move in force
 we shall attract Communist opposition.
 Even more unpopular than Americans in
 Asia are,the Chinese.  This is nothing new.
 Any half-educated person knows that the
 Chinese have been hated for generations. No
 Vietnam government would dare (up until
 now) to Invite the Chinese In.  Our conduct
 in Vietnam promises, however, to change all
 this.
 Secretary Rusk in attempting to strengthen
 his position spoke of the Ethiopian war and
 the Japanese war in Manchuria-apparently
 for the purpose of getting across the idea
 that we should have intervened.  However, it
 did not come out that way in our press.
 Instead it reminded persons of my age of the
 aggression and made us think of our own
 position in such terms.   I  cannot, as an
 American put on paper what I truly mean.
 It is too humiliating.
 The Rusk position that to end the war
 would invite the loss ofall Asia to the Com-
 munists is of course wrong.                                                                                    The opposite is
 true.   Our warlike posture will throw one
 country after another into the hands of those
 who oppose us.  If we would take to helping
 countries throw out their crooked leaders and
 with neutral help offer guidance (not a carrot
 in one hand and a stick in the other), we
 could be heroes and not villians.
 I beseech you to keep up your good work
 and I pray that you will find the health and
 energy to do so.
 Yours very truly,
 Fashion Square.  This is a live wire group
 headed by attractive Mrs. Lee Gregory.
 In the process of my talk before the GOP
 ladies, I made it clear that in my opinion
 President Lyndon B. Johnson (a Democrat)
 is eminently correct regarding his present
 policy of carrying the war home to North
 Vietnam, via aerial bombing.
 There is no absolute guarantee of success
 in any conceivable form of action in this
 area.   But the bombing raids  ordered by
 L.B.J. are proving costly to the instigators of
 aggression in the north.  'What will they do?
 That much remains to be seen-but we
 are no longer a "paper tiger."
 A LAUGHINGSTOCK
 If we back down now, as many perhaps-
 well-intentioned   appeasers  and  pacifists
 would have us do, we would become quickly
 the  laughtingstock  of  Asia.   And  likely
 ultimately, the whole world, too, Why give
 away our marbles?
 Another interesting question might be as
 to why all. these weird marches and student
 sitdowns are directed monotonously at our
 Government, instead of the offensive Reds?
 They are to blame for the present trouble.
 Aren't they?
 Why are such voices of protest aimed only
 at the Government of the one nation which
 bears the brunt of championing the cause
 of the free world against the ominous threat
 of  Communist  global  slavery?   Why  us?
 Hmm?
 NOT ORGANIZED
 I believe that what has happened in the
 American Republic today is simply a case of
 excessive                               leftwing organization and not
 enough organization of those   people who
 believe thoroughly in our libertarian cause.
 The overwhelming percentage of our citi-
 zenry, including students, is in the later
 camp, although they have largely been out-
 shouted by organized militant minorities ex-
 ploited by leaders out in left field.  Apathy
 can be extremely dangerous.
 What we must do soon in our country is
 organize countermovements against those
 launched  by  questionable  or Red-tinged
 sources.  It will take time and hard work.
 But the decent and truly moderate people
 must be heard from, too.
 As an example, what could be done on a
 down-to-earth scale to counteract the harm-
 ful influence of 15,000 "beat the draft" stu-
 dent types that besieged the White House re-
 cently in a vain and disgraceful effort to
 cause L.B.J. to withdraw from Vietnam?
 The Republican ladies I mentioned earlier
 in the column took an exemplary action after
 I finished talking to them in Sherman Oaks.
 They unanimously, passed a resolution to
 send President Johnson a telegram, with all
 their names attached as Republicans, letting
 him know they were 100 percent behind him
 in his Vietnamese policy and to keep up his
 courageous fight.
 Let me suggest that m,~ readers take pen
 in hand now and complete the same kind of
 action to L.B.J. White House, Washington,
 D.C.
 Let us encourage him for doing what is
 difficult-but right-in Vietnam,

 DEAR  SENATOR:                 I  am a Republican who
 voted for Rockefeller in our primary and
 then cast my vote for President Johnson, al-

 might rather say I voted against Goldwater
 (not as a man but as a puppet of the radical
 right).
 I want you to know that I support your
 position in our war against Vietnam.  I also
 believe it Is illegal, unmoral, and reflects
 godlessness. Igo a bit further.  I fear it re-
 fleets military thinking based on training
 which has exulted Prussian (or Nazi or what-
 soever) military tactics.
 I am not a letter writer but today I feel
 impelled to give you a bit of disheartening

 In the recent call for an international con-

 why the proposed conference did not meet.
 The; evidence shows that only recently any

 been received by the NLF of South Vietnam.
 These are the people we are fighting and
 should be represented in any conference.

 thing you say.               The attached letter could just
 as well have been written by myself.  I too,
 voted for L.B.J. but am I ever sorry. What
 is left for the voter?  We are asked to do
 our duty and vote but a deal such as this is
 no encouragement.
 Now It's the Dominican Republic.      Who
 next?  Are we supposed to force our politics
 down the throats of people all over the
 world?
 Perhaps if you receive many letters like
 mine it may do some good but I doubt
 it.

 DEAR  SENATOR       MORSE:  I  wholeheartedly
 support your admirable effort to clarify the
 facts and reveal the dangers of our present
 policy concerning Vietnam.     It seems appar-
 ent that the American public has been mis-
 informed and even purposely deceived by
 most of the mass media.  Certainly both the
 State and Defense Departments must shoul-
 der much of the blame for this.  The inevi-
 table consequences of this practice of self-
 delusion can lead only to the slow erosion
 of our vitality as a free nation. It is regret-
 ful that only a few other Senators have had
 the courage to speak out against such an un-
 justifiable misuse of power.
 The current involvement of the United
 States in Santo Domingo is also appalling
 and entirely inconsistent with the ideals for
 which this country stands.  I hope you will
 point out that U.S. Intervention in the in-
 ternal affairs of any Latin American country
 beyond protecting the lives of our citizens
 in time of danger 1s both contrary to inter-
 national law and Pan American relations.
 Sincerely yours,

 I admire the man greatly, supporting many
 of his policies, but not the one on Vietnam.
 At least, he has sent no troops in.  Let us

 for confession to you.  For one, I have never
 seen any future in fighting ideas with a stick,
 feel that after the war we wilted before an
 anti-Communist barrage, and that this has
 made enemies for us among distant peoples

 that.
 It seems to go back to the time when we

 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT      I know that I ani only
 one voice among millions, but I hope that I
 am  one of millions to express to you the
 following views:
 The human race has nevgr before possessed
 the power to completely destroy itself and
 its environment.  Therefore, the waging of
 even a limited war is no longer a feasible
 answer to present to those whose ideas, and
 Ideals may conflict with ours.  Our only path
 has to be negotiation.  Our only hope is the
 belief in the reasonableness of all men,.
 I urge you to put an end to the Vietnam
 conflict by withdrawing now, before the whole
 thing escalates into adisaster where nothing
 will matter anymore.    This is the only sane
 solution to the problem, and i am moved all
 the more strongly to write because i am ex-
 tremely disappointed in the lack of clear
 voice from the Canadian _-0overnment..
 I know that Senators MORSE,  GRUENING,
 and"CHURCH are urging you to do the same
 as this letter and I am also writing them to
 encourage them to continue their attempt
 to influel7.ce you in this matter.
 In closing,I would like to emphasize that
 this is the first time that, I have ever been

 your advisers realize.

 DEAR SENATOR Moasr: I send you once again
 my congratulations for your continuing stand

 Also, I wish to register my protest for U.S.
 actions in the Dominican Republic.  Such ill-
 advised unilateral action reveals the lack of
 maturity in foreign policy that has plagued
 our country and the world for so many years.
 I urge you to do all in your power to rein-
 state the U.S. Senate as"an active partner in
 the formulation of U.S. foreign policy.  I am
 unhappy, as I am sure you are, with the cur-
 rent arrangement wherein the Senate is pre-
 sented a fait accompli and then has the un-
 comfortable task of supporting an unfortu-
 nate position merely because a crisis situation
 seems to offer no alternatives.  This unsatis-
 factory arrangement  could                                                                                 not continue
 without passive Senate approval.

 I commend this area to your attention.

 MR. PRESIDENT:     THE WAR CONTINUES
 Though we approve your excellent pro-
 posal of a billion dollars for the develop-

 are made 'meaningless  by each  raid  that
 sends our jets with tons of bombs and
 napalm  spilling  over    North  and    South
 Vietnam.
 You have said, "It is a war of unparalleled
 brutality *  *  * small and helpless villages
 are ravaged by sneak attacks, large raids
 are conducted on towns and terror strikes
 in the hearts of cities." .
 You have said you will negotiate uncon-
 ditionally with any government.
 You have said, "The guns and bombs, the
 rockets and warships are all symbols of hu-
 man failure.
 human folly."
 May 7, 1965
 Why continue the bombing,
 napalm,   the indiscriminate
 women and children?
 the use of
 killing   of
 Why  exclude  the  National     Liberation
 Front which is fighting the "governments"
 we support in South Vietnam and which
 is the de facto gove nment of more than
 one-half of South Vietnam's territory and
 people?
 We agree, it is tragic folly.
 Why continue a war and a policy which
 sinks us in ever deeper and tends to create
 an atmosphere which precludes negotiations?
 When so many experts (among them U
 Thant, Hans Morgenthau, Walter Lippmarm)
 have pointed out that the military approach
 produces results exactly opposite to those we
 wish, why continue and intensify the war?
 Secretary General U Thant, speaking of
 insurgency  in  Burma  in  1948,  recently
 stated:
 "The Burmese Government dealt with this
 internal problem by its own means, without
 asking for any outside military assistance
 * * *  [and] there has not been a single In-
 stance of outside help to the Burmese Com-
 munists * * * In  the  last  17 years * It *
 Burma has over 1,000 miles of land frontier
 with mainland China. If only the Burmese
 Government had decided at some stage to
 seek outside military assistance to suppress
 the Internal insurrections and revolts, then
 I am sure that Burma would have experi-
 enced one of the two alternatives: either the
 country would be divided into two parts or
 the whole country would have become Com-
 munist long ago * *  *. Not one American
 life has been lost in Burma.  Not one Amer-
 ican dollar has been spent in the form of
 military assistance * * *. We must ask the
 great question: Why?"
 Are you committing our young men to
 murderous attrition in a ground war which
 may last a generation?  Are you going to
 make the fatal mistake of bombing China?
 The Religious Society of Friends have tra-
 ditionally rejected war for any reason.  A
 modern expression of this position is found
 in the United Nations Charter which says,
 "All members shall refrain in their interna-
 tional relations from the threat or use of
 force against the territorial integrity or po-
 litical independence of any state, or in any
 other manner inconsistent with the purposes
 of the United Nations."
 And yet the war still goes on.  You can
 stop it.
 We respectfully recommend:
 1. An immediate end, to the bombing.
 2. No more U.S. troops be sent to South
 Vietnam.
 3. The United States  call for  a 4-week
 truce and an invitation to all concerned to
 bring  about negotiations  for  a peaceful
 settlement.
 4. Negotiations which include:
 (a)    Provisions for peaceful settlement of
 future differences in Asia by establishing
 working  relationships which  include  the
 the United States, all Asian nations and the
 U.N.
 (b) A phased withdrawal of United State
 and  all other  outside  forces from  Sout:
 Vietnam with full recognition and willing?
 ness to accept the results of free election
 5. The immediate implementation of yoi
 proposal for a billion-dollar U.S. grant fS
 economic aid to southeast Asia under U.
 auspices.
 6. No withdrawal of aid, even if the voti:
 should go against us.
 We can win with aid and peace what
 cannot win by war.

 DEAR MR. VICE PRESIDENT: An old warrior,
 Senator WAYNE MORSE, spoke very true words
 when he criticized the Secretaries of Defense
 and State and demanded their Ouster.
 I agree with that old warrior because I
 have  become  alarmed  at  the  dangerous
 growth of the power of the military in the
 United States.
 I agree too because, as the old warrior
 pointed out,  McNamara  is   consistently
 wrong.  As far as Secretary Husk is con-

 tual and has abdicated to the Secretary of
 Defense anyway.
 I call for the ouster of Secretaries Mc-
 Namara and Rusk.  I call for the appoint-
 ment of J. W. FULBRIGHT as Secretary of State
 and Clark Kerr as Secretary of Defense.
 I call for the removal of General Taylor
 from his position as Ambassador  (a mis-

 DEAR Sin: The eyes of the people of 99 na-

 Many must be the pressures brought to

 you somehow feel the desire of thousands of
 humble people around the world-although
 of less courage and eloquence-to be by your
 side to give you added strength to uphold
 those principles, which you have so ably
 fought for.
 May your voice and those of your courage-

 persuasive enough to turn President Johnson

 of many young Americans who have been
 shipped off to Vietnam to fight in a war of
 which they understand little, and to be called
 upon to commit acts of barbarism with the

 fabricated.
 Robbie Burns' poem "Man Was Made to
 Mourn" comes to mind:
 "And man, whose heaven-erected face
 The smiles of love adorn-
 Man's inhumanity to man
 Makes countless thousands mourn I"
 The respect and gratitude'of many thou-

 must go.  This trio of tragic efficiency ex-

 And last but not least, I should point out,

 DEAR  SIR: Even without the facts sup-

 being followed is one of mistake compounded
 by tragedy.  How long can we afford to

 I urge you, as a courageous Senator, who
 has demonstrated in the past the courage to
 dissent from prevailing political opinion,

 DEAR  PRESIDENT  JOHNSON:  A  little  more
 than a week ago I wrote to you and said, in
 part, "I protest in the strongest way possible
 the escalation of the war in Vietnam. I ad-

 ties.  The weapons of war being used by our
 troops and airmen are inhuman.  Phospho-
 rus and napalm and dart-scattering bombs
 are bringing down upon us hatred and con-
 tempt.  They are not winning the war; they
 are losing us the world."  I continued, ask-
 ing for an immediate cease-fire and actual,
 active opening of negotiations, a difficult task
 but one we cannot put off.

 sentiments the  deleted sentences  contain.
 "Most of my friends and acquaintances feel
 as I do.  You are losing the trust and sup-
 port of the one group that is essential to your
 continuance as an effective President, the
 liberals, the presidentmakers in many a past

 vote for you again unless you show that the
 Christianity you profess is a reality to you.
 The Vietnam war is canceling every wonder-
 ful accomplishment of your remarkable and
 productive term as President of the United
 States."
 Since that earlier letter you have invaded
 the Dominican Republic in order to crush
 the successful and democratic revolution in
 progress there.  Juan Bosch is not and never
 was a Communist.  Most of his revolution-
 aries are not and never were Communists.
 You are using this civil strife, in my opin-

 military and economically  powerful  reac-

 democratically elected government the Dom-

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE : This is to express to
 you my gratitude and admiration for the
 honest and courageous position you have
 taken on the recent turn of events in the
 Vietnam war.  It has been practically your
 voice alone out of all those emerging from
 Washington which has left me with the feel-
 ing that there is anybody at all left in the
 Government with any decency, honor, or
 commonsense.
 I want to assure you of my warm and ad-
 miring support, and to express my confident
 hope that you will continue to act as the
 voice of good sense until the administration
 regains theirs.
 Sincerely yours,

 DEAR SENATOR: Your address on the floor
 of the Senate last week was very Impressive.
 We are deeply concerned about ' Johnson's
 present policy on Vietnam.     Your thinking
 as expressed on TV last week with refer-
 ence to southeast Asia makes sense.  Your
 party crucified Goldwater with the 'appella-
 tion of "trigger happy." And as he stated 4n
 Paris a few days ago: "Now you're a states-
 man when you do that." Add to our south-
 east Asia headaches we are fighting in the
 Dominican Republic.  Why must we try to
 keep peace in every country in the world?
 We are afraid your party is leading us down
 the road to destruction.

 It's ideological, not a vital U.S. interest.
 Playing footsie with Goldwaterites is no way

 loyalty to the Democratic Party of 30 years.

 the Democratic lawyers committee.  I gave
 you and other Democratic candidates my
 time because I believed what you were saying
 in your campaign speeches about the role
 of the United States in world affairs.  I be-
 lieved you when you condemned your op-
 ponent for his willingness to go to war, and
 commit American troops to fight for what
 were at best dubious causes.  Now it is he
 who is gloating, and :i and many like me who
 are disillusioned and apprehensive.  Perhaps,
 Mr. President, instead of Insulting the mem-
 ory of your late and beloved predecessor by
 oblique references to his rocking chair, you
 would do well to sit in a rocking chair awhile
 yourself and ponder where you are leading
 this great Nation of ours. Ponder, Mr. Presi-
 dent, just what has happened in the last 6
 months.   The  great  "detente"  has  been
 shattered and the cold war rages hotter than
 in the darkest days of Dulles and Vishinsky.
 Our military leaders in Hawaii blithely talk
 of  using nuclear  weapons   against North
 Vietnam and China.   "Lazy Dog" bombs and
 napalm obliterate the lives of those we claim
 to be saving in the name of "freedom."  In
 Latin America, the hopes and aspirations of
 a continent which were aroused by the Al-
 liance for Progress have been dashed by our
 brutal suppression of the Bosch rebellion.
 Students are dying In the streets down there,
 students like myself, whose only crime was
 to take arms in the defense of democracy.
 Why  are we killing them, Mr. President?
 Must people die because  someone in the
 State Department or CIA says if Bosch re-
 turns to power he'll be soft on leftist ele-
 ments in the country?                                                                                                                                                  A little reflection
 would have told you that nothing would
 help Castro more than our sending In the
 Marines.  Will we send the Marines into
 Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, and Argentina
 in the name of freedom, too?
 So I would ask you to sit in your rocking
 chair with your hands crossed awhile and
 ponder.   Because  the  students  in  the
 Dominican Republic and the peasants in
 Vietnam don't have the votes to return you
 to  office, they're  as much human beings
 and their aspirations as noble as those poor
 farmers in the Pedernales Valley you're so

 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:  I have been deeply
 concerned for some time over the way in
 which you have been conducting the foreign
 affairs of my country. I believe the course
 you are pursuing in Vietnam is completely
 unjustifiable either from the standpoint of
 international morality, which the United
 States as the richest and most powerful na=
 tion in the world Is obligated to uphold, or
 from the standpoint of sheer "Machtpolitik".
 You have, in the brief span of 6 months
 since you no longer had to worry about
 popular support for your policies, completely
 undone all the good will and respect for this
 country which your far more worthy pre-
 decessor had  diligently  cultivated.   You
 have completely abandoned the noble idea
 that my country must work to further
 freedom and social Justice around the world,
 and substituted a policy of gunboat di-
 plomacy add  military    missile-rattling. I
 am ashamed of you, Mr. President, and you
 can not write me off as simply another of
 those "beatnik-pacifists." I am a graduate
 of Yale University and presently a student at
 the University of Pennsylvania Law School.

 that sounds well enoughfor simple-minded

 DEAR SENATOR: It is with a grateful heart
 that I thank you for lifting a voice against
 the duplicity and evil that stems from the
 White House and State Department these
 days.  Vietnam is but one disgrace against
 all of us who live in this land, because of
 their machinations.
 Now we are faced with the disgrace of
 the Dominican Republic.  And the President
 uses the same disguise used by the Kluxers,
 George Wallace, the Birchers, et al.:  "The
 Communsts are taking over."  Shades of Joe
 McCarthy.
 I'm not dumb and know there are Com-
 munists there, of course, and I know there
 are Communsts and Fascists right here in
 this holy land of ours.  But I didn't think
 the President would stoop to the gutter to
 brainwash us with this idiocy.
 So we went down to protect our nationals.
 Then came the denoument: we're digging in
 deep for munitions; not to be used against
 the criminals who have caused increased suf-
 fering  to  the  poor  after  Trujillo  was
 dumped,  but against the poor themselves
 who are seeking to cast off their very heavy
 and painful yoke.
 Thank you, Senator. Most of us fear that
 some cruel actions might again be taken
 against us for not approving of the evils from
 Washington.

 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:  You have appealed
 for the people to follow you in the Vietnam
 situation.
 I am writing to say that I am not following
 you.  And of course I join millions whom
 you do not seem to recognize.
 The constant deceit of the people, first con-
 cerning the very reasons for the situation,
 then regarding the number and functions of
 men whom you sent in, then concerning your
 methods-poison gas, brutality, etc.-has but
 increased with your new and recent stepup.
 It was all too apparent to the discerning,
 however, that you were preparing a good seg-
 ment of the press for mass deceit.  Then
 came a picture campaign, in which two or
 three Americans were pictured being brought
 home as casualties, with never a word about
 the  hundreds  of  other  casualties. Then
 came the white paper.  Probably an occa-
 sional proposition in it could be believed.
 Then came private correspondence.   I wrote
 you, but the State Department stepped in
 and answered the letter, with a little white
 paper, which was no more successful than the
 big one.  I understand this method is being
 widely used.
 So I make one more appeal to my President,
 that you embrace the opportunities which
 are still open-for deeds, not just words-to.
 arrive at understandings, and pull out.

 DEAR  SENATOR  MORSE:  I  understand the
 President is asking the Congress for a "vote
 of confidence" on his Vietnam and Domini-

 to vote against his request for $700 million.
 I support your position.  As you are well
 aware, this is unpopular, at the moment, but
 it is the right position.
 It seems to me we have violated interna-
 tional law and the whole tradition of the
 past in our Dominican intervention.  It is
 interesting that Bolivia and Uruguay have
 opposed our intervention.
 Our  position  in  Vietnam  is  somewhat
 similar except that here we originally went
 in on an advice and training basis. Now,
 since an election in which Mr. Johnson posed
 is the opposite of a trigger-happy candidate,

 It seems to me we have embarked on a

 residential winner, waged a completely dis-
 onest campaign.  Barry Goldwater may be

 MAY 1, 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: May I applaud you
 for your vigorous and courageous speech at-
 tacking U.S. policy in Vietnam and denounc-
 ing Secretary Rusk and Secretary McNamara
 and the President for their efforts in esca-
 lating the war there?  American policy in
 Vietnam is indeed godless and immoral, as
 you point out, for it is causing untold suf-
 fering in that unhappy country and grave
 anxiety everywhere else in the world.  This
 reckless fanning of the flames of war will.
 at best lose America the friendship of Japan,
 and at the worst spark a world conflagration
 that will incinerate us all.
 The day after your speech appeared on
 page 1 of the Arabi Evening News, an ex-
 cellent English language newspaper in Japan,
 there appeared in this same paper the cen-
 sored testimony of Undersecretary of State
 George Ball and Douglas MacArthur II before
 the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (a
 clipping which I am enclosing) in which they
 claimed that the reason why Japanese news-
 papers are so critical of U.S. policies in Viet-
 nam is that there is a large number of Com-
 munists on their editorial staffs.
 What is amazing about the statements of
 Ball and MacArthur, and even the subse-
 quent  interrogations  by  Chairman  FUL-
 BRIGHT, is the ignorance they reveal of the
 state of mind of the Japanese, and these
 persons total inability to comprehend how
 anybody, least of all the Japanese, could be
 critical of American policy in Vietnam.
 The Asahi Shimbun  (the Japanese lan-
 guage paper) and the Mainichi, the two pa-
 pers accused of Communist Infiltration, vig-
 orously dented  the                                                                    charges  of  Ball  and
 MacArthur, as you will see from the clippings
 which I am enclosing, and responsible Jap-
 anese with whom I have spoken likewise
 agree that the editorial  policies of these
 newspapers are free from Communist influ-
 ence.  Indeed, the extensive coverage of the
 Vietnam war in Japan includes magazines,
 TV, and radio, as well as the daily newspa-
 pers.  These media are on the whole critical
 of U.S. policy in Vietnam, and in this, I think
 it is fair to say, they reflect the feelings of
 the average thoughtful Japanese.
 As an American Buddhist priest who has
 been living in Japan for almost 15 years, I
 can honestly say that in all that period this
 is the first time I have been able to discern
 strong anti-American Government feelings
 among the Japanese.  But they have good
 reason to oppose present American policy in
 Vietnam.  They   themselves   have   been
 bombed, so they know the suffering and
 destruction  it causes. But  they are also
 fearful that if either China or Russia or both
 enter the war, as is very likely if the war con-
 tinues to escalate, they will be targets for
 attack by these powers.
 Dear Senator MORSE, I pray that you be
 granted the strength to continue to oppose,
 with all your forensic skill, the madness of
 our Government's policies in Vietnam, not
 only for the sake of the decency and self-
 respect of the United States, but for the sake
 of  the  suffering Vietnamese  and  peoples
 everywhere who are worried and anxious lest
 Vietnam erupt into the third world war.

 ASAHI SHIMBUN DENIES INFILTRATION BY

 I have little confidence, although one can           The Asahi Shimbun issued a statement
 ways hope, that this Congress will become            today denying charges made in the U.S. Sen-
 lything more than a subservient agent of                               ate Foreign Relations Committee that the
 95.59
 newspaper is infiltrated and influenced in its
 editorial policies by Communists.
 A censored transcript of the testimony of
 Undersecretary of State  George  Ball and
 Douglas MacArthur II, Assistant Secretary
 of  State  for  Congressional  Relations, in
 closed-door hearings in the committee April
 7 was made public in Washhington Wednes-
 day.
 Mr. Ball was quoted as saying that the
 Mainichi Shimbun has on its staff. "quite a
 number of Communists * * * and has taken
 a critical attitude" toward U.S. policy in
 Vietnam.
 Mr. MacArthur, former American ambas-
 sador to Japan, was reported to have said,
 "They both are infiltrated.  Asahi had over
 200 members of the Community Party on the
 editorial staff."
 The Asahi Shimbun issued a denial in the
 form of a statement by managing editor
 Isami  Suzukawa,  which said   the  charges
 were utterly untrue.
 "It is extremely regrettable that high of-
 ficials of the U.S. State Department gave
 testimony in the Senate implying that there
 are Communists on the editorial staff of the
 Asahi Shimbun and that the editorial policy
 of the Asahi Shimbun is influenced by these
 Communists.  This testimony is absolutely
 contrary to the truth," Mr. Suzukawa's state-
 ment read.
 "The Asahi Shimbun is published on the
 basis of its traditional policy of impartiality
 and nonpartisanship.  It maintains its own
 viewpoint of fair reporting and editorializing
 and is not influenced by Communists or any
 other outside pressures.
 "The Asahi Shimbun reflects public opin-
 ion and has always criticized and will con-
 tinue to criticize, when necessary, the poli-
 cies, not only of the United States, but of
 other countries as well.
 "However, these criticisms have always been
 made from a spirit of friendship and there
 are no ulterior motives.  We especially hope
 that the American Government and people
 will listen frankly to our friendly criticism,"
 the statement concluded.

 BALL, MACARTHUR SAY PRESS HERE
 "INFILTRATED"
 WASHINGTON, April 28.-Two high-ranking
 State Department officials have told Congress
 one reason Japanese newspapers are so criti-
 cal of V.S. policies is that there is a large
 number  of  Communists                               on  the  editorial
 staffs.
 Under Secretary of State George Ball and
 Douglas MacArthur II, Assistant Secretary of
 State for Congressional Relations, testified
 on the subject recently in closed-door hear-
 ings of the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee.  A censored transcript of their testi-
 mony was made public today.
 Committee Chairman  J.  WILLIAM  FUL-
 BRIGHT asked why the newspapers of Japan
 were so critical of the United States despite
 ,the fact that Japan is "supposed to be our
 strongest ally in that area."
 He quoted a story in the Tokyo Mainichi
 about an  interview with a special envoy,
 Shunichi Matsumoto, who had been sent by
 Premier Sato to survey the situation in Viet-
 nam.
 Mr. Ball replied: "That Mainichi, which is
 the largest newspaper in Japan-in fact I
 think it  is the largest newspaper in  the
 world-has on its staff quite a number of
 Communists and has taken a critical atti-
 tude."
 Mr.  FULBRIGHT remarked that Asahi had
 also been critical, and Mr. MacArthur said:
 "They both are infiltrated.  Asahi had over
 200 members of the Communist Party on the
 editorial staff."
 Mr. FULBRIGHT remarked that Mr. Matsu-
 moto is not a Communist, and Mr. MacAr-
 thur agreed that he was not.                                                                                                                            "He is a former

 said.
 ?What has happened here is not an ex-
 pression of the view of the Japanese Govern-
 ment," Mr. Ball said.  -This is an expression
 of a man who went on a f-detfinding mission
 and has come back."
 He added that it was "not clear" whether
 the mission was an official one.

 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:   During this month
 a number of us have engaged in fasting,

 our share, unwilling though it is, in the
 brutal, barbarous, illegal, and immoral war
 in Vietnam; and (2) as a deep expression of
 our concern that negotiation and economic
 and social aid may take the place of military

 This Is why many folks today axe question-

 we were when we believed we were fighting
 to end all wars.

 Senator STUART SYMINGTON,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR SYMINGTON: I want to reg-
 ister a strong protest against the $700 million
 war-appropriation measure, and the steam-
 roller tactics by which it is proposed to rush
 it through Congress.  In the name of heaven,
 let Congress stop and consider the signifi-
 cance of what it is being asked to do.  The
 President  admits the money itself is not
 needed and announces that he wants the
 measure passed as evidence of popular sup-
 port    his policy In Vietnam and
 Dominican Republic.  Then why the haste?
 Why not take time to debate his policy?
 The fact is that millions of Americans think
 that Johnson is pursuing a terribly wrong
 and dangerous course of action.  If the Presi-
 dent wants Congress to endorse his policy,
 he should not use this devious device but
 should ask for a vote directed to the policy
 itself.  Moreover, before Congressgives such
 an endorsement it should be extremely care-
 ful to define precisely what policy it is ap-
 proving.  As I understand him, Johnson has
 stated that he wants to tell the world that
 we are determined to pursue his new policy
 no matter what the cost and no matter what
 the risk. I, for one, would give him no such
 blank check.  The new policy appears to be
 pose, after killing off a lot of the American
 soldiers and others.
 I cannot understand why President John-
 son didn't acept the offer Secretary General
 U Thant to let the U.N. mediate the trouble
 and build up southeast Asia with the Mekong
 project.  Though I really do believe it was
 the military-industrial combine insisted that
 their stockpile of weapons should be used so
 they could say they needed more.   '
 Our WSCS had a study "The United States
 and  the  New  Nations" by Vera Micheles
 Dean, and in that book she stated that 30
 percent of the money for foreign aid stayed in
 this country.  And a pamphlet came at the
 same time telling how much the AID orga-
 nization was going to do for needy nations,
 and. it made the same statement that 80 per-
 cent of the money would stay in this coun-
 try-implying that because of that more
 people in our country were in favor of the
 foreign aid program.  At the same time this
 clipping was sent to me which I intended
 to send you.  For I have heard you advocat-
 ing less aid for the military and more for the
 people.
 Several years ago I wrote you a very explo-
 sive letter to which you replied kindly that if
 you had a chance to get acquainted with me
 you could make me change my opinion.  So
 I must tell you that ]: admire your courage
 in standing for the right things on so many
 issues.  Of course, one of the main ones is
 on the liquor question.  If you visited Jack
 Travis' cattle when you were in Oregon, you
 were right across the road from my house.
 I wonder how long it will take President
 Johnson to bankrupt this country.

 DEAR MR. MORSE: After seeing you on to-
 days newscast; I am thankful that we still
 have a few statesmen in Congress who are
 ready to stand up to be counted.  When the
 executive branch of our Government dele-
 gates the enormous powers to Cabinet head
 men like Wirtz, McNamara, and Katzenbach;
 who are immune to constructive criticism
 but are willing to gamble with our citizens'
 lives; we at home wonder why we have a
 Congress.
 Mr. McNamara estimated that the tab for
 our interference in South Vietnam, will cost
 us about $11/. billion in the 1985 fiscal year.
 Just how did Congress face up to accept
 this decision of the Pentagon?  We are in
 war.  Yet, who declared this war; without
 the sole decision of you, the representatives
 of the people?
 On February 11, 1963, I had written your
 colleague Senator MARGARET  GFIASE  SMITH.

 whatever extent deemed appropriate by the
 Defense Department, wherever  there is a
 revolutionary     outbreak  which  the  Presi-
 dent's inner circle of advisers-presumably
 including the Secretary of State--concludes
 is or might be "Communist dominated."
 To what ridiculous and suicidal end will
 this new policy lead us?       Suppose China
 decides to intervene in Vietnam?  Will the
 President then approve the use of nuclear
 weapons?   He may well do so, relying on
 Congress overwhelming approval of an ap-
 propriation measure.  Suppose the Soviet
 Union then is impelled to resort to its nu-
 clear arsenal.  Who will accept the awful
 responsibility for pushing the red button?
 The President of the United States-or Con-
 gress?
 I urge you and the other Members of the
 Congress at the very least to somehow limit
 the appropriation measure so that its passage
 would seem inevitable  and not  fairly be
 treated as a blanket endorsement of the
 President's policy as it has developed to date,
 or certainly not as a blanket endorsement
 of what other steps in the process of escala-

 DEAR SIR: -I am sending a copy of my recent

 The  1954 Vietnam agreements have not

 President  Eisenhower's  words   (August

 which I would add material reasons, provide

 Prime Minister of Canada,
 House of Commons,
 Ottawa.
 DEAR MR. PEARSON: It was indeed hearten-
 ing to know that you had received the World
 Peace Award of Temple University in Phila-
 delphia, and that in accepting it you spoke
 for the majority of Canadian people in your
 proposals to President Johnson regarding
 Vietnam.
 In my view it is a case of the old quotation:
 "For what is a man profited if he shall gain
 the whole world and lose his own soul?" and
 that the very existence of the whole world
 as we know it is risked at the present time for
 political reasons,  it is true that through
 very . efficient mass communications  media
 we are made aware that something in the na-
 ture of a world revolution is taking place
 today, but it is also true that the United Na-
 tions Charter, in article 2, No. 7, states that
 there shall be no intervention in matters
 which . are essentially within the domestic
 jurisdiction of any state-and surely this
 holds good as a moral precept for any mem-
 ber state.
 That the United States Intervention in
 South Vietnam was  or is) on behalf of the
 Vietnamese people is sheer sham, for we all
 know that those governing that small coun-
 try         at the  time     were  not  democratically
 elected, nor even popular with the masses
 of the people (as is also the case with the
 three subsequent coups).
 We have to accept that change is synony-
 mous with life itself, and we have seen great
 changes even in a life time, as for instance
 In our powerful neighbor, the U.S.S.R., and
 we surely have no moral right or excuse to
 try to Impose our will by killing, upon other
 experimenting nations. We have only to put
 ourselves in their place to sense the result-
 ing outrage for any such action.
 I would like to thank you for having the
 Under Secretary of State reply to my last
 letter to you, of February 13, and for sending
 me your addresses to the Ottawa Canadian
 71ub and the United Church Board of Evan-
 ;elism.         I trust you will use your influence

 President LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: This is to inform you
 of my profound distress over our military
 Intervention in the Vietnamese civil  war.
 The white paper which purports to justify
 thi
 s intervention has been described as "a
 dismal failure" by an eminent historian and
 poltical scientist, Prof. H. G. Morgenthau, of
 the University of Chicago.  On the contrary,
 this document tends rather to support the
 earlier official view of the civil nature of the
 military struggle wracking the Vietnamese
 people.
 We have thus violated the Geneva Pact of
 1954 in support of a dubious South Vietnam
 Government which not only failed to carry
 out the election mandate of the pact bit in-
 stituted the reign of repression which pro-
 voked the present rebellion.  I,  therefore,
 take my stand with Senators MORSE, GRUEN-
 ING,  CHURCH,  MCGOVERN,  FULBRIGHT,    and
 others in their sharp dissent with our pres-
 ent harsh military venture in Vietnam.   I
 am appalled by the bombing, burning, chem-
 ical, and other weapons with which our mili-
 tary have been experimenting in that un-
 happy land.  I plead, nay, demand an end
 to such barbarities for so they are no matter
 who unleashes them.  I ask that you convene
 forthwith an assembly of the Geneva Pact
 powers to fashion a viable, representative
 Vietnamese state. Once a cease-fire is estab-
 lished, it should be maintained by a U.N.
 military force and American troops with-
 drawn.
 Mr. President, you must lead, not follow on
 the way to the conference table if we are to
 regain our role as the leader of the demo-
 cratic way.
 Sincerely yours,
 ALBERTA,  CANADA,

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 The Senate,
 Washington D,.C., U.S.A.
 SIR: About a month ago, when events in
 the Vietnamese war began to be escalated
 to a new high pitch, I wrote a letter to Prime
 Minister Pearson, the substance of which is
 given In the enclosed duplicated letter. (This
 letter is a copy of the one I sent to Canadian
 newspapers and others to try to get support
 for the idea contained in it.)   I felt that
 some practical method had to be worked out
 to replace the vacuum left when the United
 Nations Assembly was paralyzed last session.
 This method would need to bypass both the
 positions of the Soviet Union, France, and
 the other nonpaying nations, and that of the
 United States, so that neither side would
 "lose face" or pride, and paralyze the new
 During the last 2 weeks or so, the names of
 Santo Domingo,  India  and Pakistan,  and
 Southern Rhodesia have been added to the
 list of those nations where war, or threatened
 war is going on. The world is increasingly
 full of nations whose boundaries are guarded
 by military forces under cease-fire agree-
 ments, some with peace-keeping forces un-
 der the United Nations to try to prevent open
 war.  Some nations, such as Indonesia, are on
 the edge of open war.  The widespread sale
 or gift of modern military weapons by the
 older industrial powers to the new nations
 for the purpose of security, has not produced
 security, but is producing the opposite.  War
 Is no longer formally declared against a na-
 tion, but is suddenly used to gain some ad-
 vantage when a nation can supposedly get
 away with it.  Very few peace treaties have
 been made since 1945 to end these local wars;
 instead, these wars end only in cease-fire
 agreements (or in no agreements) which can
 be broken at any time to continue the wars.
 The whole situation is fast growing In un-
 stable equilibrium, or in no equilibrium.
 The longer these "brush-fire" wars are al-
 lowed to simmer away, according to my ob-
 servation, the more difficult will be the ef-
 forts required to settle them, and the more
 likely they will involve other nations.  The
 fear of atomic weapons seems to have little
 effect on preventing war.  It may even en-
 courage the smaller nations to use the war
 method, since they can probably get away
 with no intervention from the atomic na-
 tions, on the assumption that they dare not
 use their atomic weapons.   Even the civil
 war, which began locally (perhaps ?), end
 up by being in fact wars between the atomic
 nations.
 The one organization that should be avail-
 able at such a time as this is the United Na-
 tions.                                                                                                                        But it is paralyze.i by the promise
 of the United States to challenge the default-
 ing nations on their right to vote in the As-
 sembly.  This paralysis has lasted  a whole
 session, creating an enormous power vacuum.
 The longer the United Nations stays para-
 lyzed, the greater this power vacuum will be-
 come.                                                                                                                        The more chance the People's Repub-
 lic of China will have to woo the nations
 of Africa and southeast Asia from the pres-
 ent defunct United Nations into the counter
 "united nations" it has recently proposed.
 Communist China should have been taken
 into the United Nations in 1960-61, during
 the time of the food shortage, when the
 country had lost much of Its aggressiveness.
 It would be much better to fight by words in
 the United Nations than by bullets, or bombs..
 This does not ignore the intransigeance of
 the days of Vishinsky.  Delegates could be
 trained for that as Dr. Martin Luther King's
 followers have been trained to meet the sav-
 age onslaughts of the police in Alabama by
 nonviolent methods.
 Until the United Nations is restored as
 the power center of the world, based essen-
 tially on moral power, the huge and growing
 forces of disintegration will continue to grab
 control, with the growing threat of escalating
 war into world war III, with the  use of
 atomic weapons to destroy mankind. I trust
 this letter will be of some real use to you in
 trying to stop this escalation.

 GENTLEMEN:  I have just heard the news
 that President Johnson has asked Congress
 for an immediate appropriation of $700 mil-
 lion, to show American determination to re-
 main in Vietnam and the Dominican Re-
 public.  He went on to indicate that the Gov-
 ernment of the United States is determined
 cost of work, struggle and blood, President
 Johnson's new foreign policy must be vig-
 orously and successfully opposed.
 To prevent the ramming through of this
 appropriation before the people have had
 time, to realize what is happening and to
 express their opposition, we ask that you
 and your colleagues who have done such
 noble work on Vietnam lead an extensive
 and intensive debate on the appropriation
 and the policy behind it.  If it is necessary
 to prevent this measure from being rammed
 through, I would even suggest a filibuster.
 Though I dislike filibusters, it would be justi-
 fied in this case to prevent an unpopular and
 disastrous course from being forced on our
 country.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Although not your

 will do everything you can to avoid in the
 Senate the haste with which the House had
 apparently given the President the money he

 no Pearl Harbor here.  You owe it to the

 to put down any revolution anywhere which
 it does not like.  Thus our country has come
 full circle-from being the first successful
 anticolonial  revolution  and  champion  of
 the self-determination of people, to being-
 if Johnson has his way-the main suppressor
 of revolution, and the right of self-determi-
 nation of people.
 It seems clear to us that President John-
 son, by word and deed, has announced a new
 foreign policy for the United States-pre-
 cisely the Goldwater policy which he pre-
 tended to oppose during the recent presiden-
 tial campaign.  He has announced a policy
 of putting down any revolution which he does
 not like, justifying this by labeling It "Com-
 munist," thus in effect saying that only the
 United States has the right to determine the
 legitimacy of any revolution.  We thereby
 become judge, jury, prosecutor, policeman,
 and jailer for the world.  This tears up the
 Atlantic Charter, which recognizes the right
 of people to self-determination, and substi-
 tutes a right of U.S. determination for all
 countries of the world-a policy akin to Hit-
 ler's in concept and similar in result, flies in
 the face of the United Nations Charter, which
 does not recognize the right of any nation
 to interfer- in the internal affairs of another
 country, and tramples on international law.
 Such a policy can have only disastrous con-
 sequences, at the very best bringing about
 universal hatred of our ccuntry, killing, and
 maiming of untold persons, both American
 and foreign, the vast destruction of property
 (which we would presumably rebuild, accord-
 ing to Johnson's southeast Asia plan), great-
 ly increased arms expenditures, all of this
 resulting in leading the United States down-
 ward toward becoming a second-rate power
 by squandering our natural resources and
 what remains of our good name.  At worst,
 this policy could lead to the total disaster
 of thermonuclear war.
 You have been providing splendid, leader-
 ship in opposition to the administration's
 policy in Vietnam.  Now that the underlying
 logic of the U.S. position there has been made
 the basis of American policy everywhere, we
 look to you to take the lead in opposing this
 appropriation_ and in exposing the logic of
 President Johnson's position.
 The President, undoubtedly realizing the
 strong opposition of a major segment of the
 American people to this policy, has adopted
 the tactic of presenting us with an accom-
 plished fact, then giving his "explanation"
 as to why, which he clearlythinks no one
 has the right to question.  (This reminds
 me of McCarthy.)   He then demands blind
 acceptance--indeed,   automatic   support-
 from Congress and the American people.                              If
 we are to preserve world peace and the good
 name of our country, if we are, to build a
 great society at home and maintain the free-
 dom our forefathers brought forth at great

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I thank God for your
 "voice crying in the wilderness" opposing
 the senseless foreign policy of our Govern-
 ment in Vietnam and now in the Dominican
 Republic.   I am with you 100 percent in
 crusading for peace-not for war.
 Several weeks ago a Canadian newspaper-
 man raised the following questions about
 Vietnam:
 1. Where do we stand on the U.S. bomb-
 ing of North Vietnam in violation of the
 1954 truce accord?
 2. How much of a civil war is going on in
 South Vietnam?
 3. If the Chinese and North Vietnamese
 are guilty, why not an all-out U.N. action?
 Similar questions can now be raised about
 our intervention in the Dominican.
 During  the  election  campaign,  Senator
 Goldwater was caricatured as being    "trig-
 ger  happy."                                                                                                                                              Many of us are raising the
 question, "Who is trigger happy now?"

 spared the horrors of another Korea.

 and said if a change is not made 'a couple of
 months from now there will be hundreds
 of thousands fighting and dying in Asia.'
 "The Senator singled out the two Cabinet
 members for the brunt of his criticism.  He
 said he was shocked by Rusk's speech Sat-
 urday night in which he said the Secretary
 of State called administration critics mod-

 my country is backing military junta in

 about going against U.N. and OAS.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I think every earnest
 citizen in the United States owes you a vote
 of confidence and support in your dedicated
 efforts to sustain the integrity of this coun-
 try in matters of fiscal solvency and from
 present  foreign  military  intervention  in
 southeast Asia.
 The suggestion often made that by some
 divine ordinance this country must under-
 take the responsibility to engage continually
 in global fighting and military intervention
 in foreign countries rests upon emotional,
 irresponsible propaganda, and appeal that is
 befogging  the  American  public  with  the
 thought that "An aggressive war is wicked,
 but a defensive war is righteous."
 To suggest that a man is an isolationist
 because he opposes this type of global mili-
 tary intervention is both irresponsible, un-
 principled, and vicious.
 I am sure there is a great bloc of the
 American people who are In back of you 100

 May I congratulate you upon your em-
 phatid`and gainful efforts.
 Very sincerely yours,

 April 25, 1965.
 President LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR PRESIDENT JOHNSON: I am a professor
 at the Unj,versity of Oregon, one of the or-
 ganizers  of the all-night protest session
 against the war in Vietnam held here last
 Friday. I think you should know some
 things about this protest movement that do
 not show in newspaper reports or in official
 statements.  In the first place, the students
 who took part here were among the most
 able that we have.  A disproportionate num-
 ber are graduate students, highly selected
 for intelligence and intellectual achievement,
 and many of the undergraduates are of equal
 ability.  They are persons whose contribu-
 tions are essential to the continued progress
 of our society.  In contrast, the supporters
 of the present Vietnam policy who showed
 up at Friday night's meeting gave no evi-
 dence of such intellectual quality either in
 the somewhat naive questions they asked or
 in the boisterous heckling in which they in-
 dulged at times.  Only a few of them were
 enough interested to stay through the after-
 midnight discussions and express their views.
 The second factor to which your attention
 may not have been drawn is the character of
 these all-night sessions.  They are not sim-
 ply protests, but a very concentrated form
 of education.  By the time the participators
 have spent 12 hours listening to speeches,
 asking and answering questions, and exam-
 ining  prepared  discussion  materials,  they
 know a great deal about such things as the
 Geneva 1964 agreements, the history of our
 involvement in southeast Asia, and other
 relevant matters.  The plan announced last
 week by the State Department to step up
 their public information activities is not
 likely to have much influence on this group.
 They know why we are in Vietnam, they are
 convinced that our presence their has no
 legal or ethical justification, and they will be
 impressed only by policies that are directed
 toward extricating us rather than involving
 us more deeply.  Statements like the one in
 this morning's paper that the United States
 is "retaining the option of using small nu-
 clear weapons" solidify the opposition in
 that they serve to confirm our worst fears-
 ,lamely, that forces in the administration are
 trying to provoke a preventive war with
 Ihina.
 The third point I wish, to make is that the
 ,pposition to present policy is extremely in-
 ense and serious. It grows out of a profound
 sorai conviction similar in quality to that
 xpressed in the civil rights movement.  If
 Hon. WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.:
 You are to be commended for your efforts
 in trying to bring peace to southeast Asia,
 Maybe there are those who are trying to solve.
 the difficult problem of population explosion;
 but perpetual war is a poor solution.

 CALIFORNIA   DEMOCRATIC   COUNCIL   LEADERS
 VOTE To QUIT VIETNAM WAR
 Directors    of  the  California Democratic
 Council, at Its closing session of its 2-day
 conference Sunday at the newly opened Holi-
 day Inn, passed a resolution reaffirming a
 stand in favor of a negotiated peace In Viet-
 nam.  The resolution also commended the
 view of Senator WILLIAM J. FULBRIGHT and
 Senator  GEORGE  AIKEN which called for A.
 cease-fire in Vietnam in order to enhance
 the possibility  of  discussions  for  settle-
 ment.
 The board turned down a more radical
 resolution on Vietnam which called for street
 demonstrations and political action.
 The California Democratic Council con-
 vention in Sacramento in March also passed
 a resolution concerning the settlement of
 the conflict in Vietnam in which it urged
 the President of the United States to stop the
 widening of the war by ordering a halt to
 further bombing of North Vietnam.  It also
 asked that the United States seek a cease-
 fire through the United Nations or an inter-
 national body preliminary to negotiating a
 diplomatic   settlement,   with  guarantees
 9563
 against foreign intervention for an inter-
 nationally supported  economic  and                                                        social
 program of reconstruction and development.
 The board also passed a civil rights reso-
 lution in support of "the people fighting
 for their recognition of basic rights and hu-
 man dignity In Alabama."
 In  another resolution  the board voiced
 support of the AFL-CIO farm labor orga-
 nization.
 The board also went on record as "oppos-
 ing                                                                                                                             nondisloyalty  oaths for  candidates."
 The California Assembly recently passed a
 measure requiring a loyalty oath of candi-
 dates and the bill is now before the State
 senate, it was reported.
 In the discussion on this resolution, the
 directors said they did not object to loyal-
 ty oaths but did object to one that called
 for declarations from a caniiidate or oth-
 ers  "that they had never been connected
 with an organization or movement deemed
 disloyal."
 Another resolution called for the restora-
 tion of the proposed 10-percent cut in sala-
 ries of State college teachers; and another
 calling  for  the  legislature  to reduce  the
 vote required for the passage of a school
 bond measure in a school district from a
 present  two-thirds  majority  to  one  of   a
 simple majority.
 Another resolution called for an investi-
 gation into the decline of the fishing Industry
 in the State and to check into water pollu-
 tion problems.
 Simon Casady, of El Cajon, near San Diego,
 a retired publisher and newspaperman, told
 a reporter of the Bakersfield Californian, that
 "any division within the Democratic Party
 seems to have healed over."  Casady report-
 edly had recently attended a meeting in Sac-
 ramento in a conference with Gov. Edmund
 G. Brown and Assembly Speaker Jesse D.
 Unruh.
 "At present, everything is sweetness and
 light and that will be the story until after
 the election," said Casady.
 "The party will  be unified  and of one
 mind in recognizing the job for the next 2
 years is to keep control and hold tight against
 the extreme rightists from taking over the
 State."
 Tom Carvey, immediate, past president of
 the CDC, in a short speech on Saturday saw
 the role of the CDC "as the conscience of the
 Democratic  Party"  and  "its  strength  will
 lie in its idealism and practical purposes
 in politics."
 Garvey was presented with a large brass-
 banded gavel as a memento for his longtime
 service as State leader.
 Horace D. Massey, of Bakersfield, region III
 vice president, who arranged for the board
 meeting invited the directors to look over the
 facilities of the civic auditorium late Satur-
 day as a preparation for the 1966 convention.
 The convention which will bring an esti-
 mated 8,000 CDC members to Bakersfield,
 February 18, 19, and 20, 1966, will be one at
 which all endorsements for State offices will
 be made preliminary to the June primary
 election.
 The directors voted Sunday also to hold
 the 1967 convention in Fresno bypassing a
 bid of San Diego for the convention.  Long
 Beach had also bid for the 1967 meeting.
 Bakersfield Attorney Gabriel Solomon was
 named as State legal counsel for the CDC.
 Solomon  just  returned  from   Sacramento
 where he also was appointed vice chairman
 for Northern California Negroes for Political
 Action.
 Solomon was also named by George Simp-
 son, of Tulare, 18th Congressional District
 director, for CDC, to the post 18th Congres-
 sional District chairman for CDC.

 President Johnson to take the lead in calling:
 for peace in southeast Asia.  The petition
 reached the White House during a 8-day in-
 tensive deliberation on Vietnam policy.
 The petitioners fear that the present policy
 of  escalation will  cause the U.S.S.R.  to
 abandon its policy of peaceful coexistence
 and (to)  reassume its nuclear shield over
 China.   Other points in the petition to the
 President stressed:
 Current U.S. policy is forcing Hanoi (North
 Vietnam)    to depend increasingly on Com-
 munist China;
 The Vietcong In the south benefit from the
 cruelty, impotence, and  selfishness of the
 so-called governments In South Vietnam that
 have alienated the peasantry;
 There are both doves and hawks in policy
 circles in Hanoi, Peiping, and Moscow.  Argu-
 ments of their doves are weakened by fear
 of America's implacable hostility.
 The petitioners  conclude  that a strong
 gesture from President Johnson for a peace-
 ful resolution in. Vietnam could establish that
 ours is the just cause and thereby win for
 us the allegiance of the poor countries of
 the world.

 from  the  Vietnamese  peasantry,  and  be-
 cause the latter have been alienated from
 the government by cruelty, impotence, and

 inevitable   withdrawal  from  eastern Asia
 would occur in a context of defeat and ha-
 tred, just as was                                                                                     the case with  imperial
 Japan.
 5. We firmly believe that there is an alter-
 native decision for peace which is more than
 just a negative decision against war. There
 are "doves" and "hawks" in Hanoi, Peiping,
 and Moscow. just as in our own country.
 There are men in Hanoi who fear Chinese
 domination as a consequence of war.   There
 are,men in Peiping who'fear loss of China's
 painful recovery in the wake of its great
 economic crisis 4 years ago.  There are men
 in, Moscow who would go a long way to pre-
 vent a recurrence of the disaster that be-
 fell Russia in the last war.                                                                                   What weakens
 the argument of these men is the fear of
 America's Implacable hostility against them.
 We  believe  that  an- open   declaration  of
 America's determination for peace in east-
 ern Asia would increase the chances of a
 favorable response from the other sides and
 from  third  parties.   We  respectfully call
 upon you to express this determination by

 THE CRISIS IN VIETNAM
 (Remarks of Senator WAYNE MORSE,  Joint
 University Forum Chicago, Ill., January 15,
 1965)
 The title of my remarks would indicate
 that I came here to talk about our problems
 in Vietnam.  But events of recent hours
 make it evident that the problems in Viet-
 nam are really those of the entire peninsula
 of Indochina, now divided into North and
 South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.
 Refusal of the Administration to explain
 what our planes are doing in Laos means
 that the American people are getting a for-
 eign policy of concealment in that part of
 the world.  They are entitled to know what
 is being done in their name in Laos and
 Vietnam.  They are entitled to know whether
 the  United States  is  escalating  the  war
 in Asia, and if so to what extent and for
 what purpose.  They are entitled to know
 whether this violation by us of the Laotian
 agreement of 1962 means we have junked
 that agreement as the basis of our policy in
 Laos and what is being substituted for it.
 If they do not demand and receive such
 an explanation, they could wake up some
 morning and find that their Great Society
 has dissolved in an Asian war.
 That is how seriously I view our situation
 in Asia.  What little we in Congress are told
 about the activities of our Armed Forces in
 Asia is told in confidence.  But it is you the
 people, who fight, and you the people who
 pay  the  bill.  Today,  neither  you  nor  I
 know what the Administration is doing in
 Asia, to what it has committed us, what its
 objectives are, and how much it is risking
 to achieve them.
 On one point there, is much agreement
 among members of Congress and Adminis-
 tration  officials-that  getting  involved  in
 Indochina after the French got out was a
 great mistake.  Yet they are now under-
 taking to compound that error by increasing
 our involvement and commitment. Where
 it will end and how much it will cost the
 American nation they have not discussed
 with the people nor with the Congress.
 That is why I say we have a foreign policy
 of concealment in southeast Asia.
 But I would like to go back to the end of
 World War II and examine the history of
 American relations with southeast Asia to see
 just how our policy led us to the present
 perilous situation.
 To the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:
 1. We, the undersigned, professional schol-
 ars in the field of Asian studies attending a
 conference concurrent with your White House
 deliberations on Vietnam policy, respectfully
 call upon you to use the awesome power and
 responsibility that rest in your hands to de-
 cide whether our country will br the world
 leader for peace and progress, or for War and
 destruction.  Politics is the work of individ-
 ual men , `not the production of the forces of
 history.  In every crisis, ` a great leader of
 men, by his decision alone, determines the
 fate of the world.  Whatever the outcome of
 that decision, he bears full responsbiliity
 for it.
 2. When a decision involves war or peace,
 the moral leader only opts for war because
 he believes that an ultimate greater good
 will be attained, or because he sincerely be-
 lieves that his country's enemies are uncle-
 -viatingly determined to have war.  We, as
 students of Asian affairs, firmly believe that
 neither of these is the case.  We believe that
 all three great powers: the United States, the
 Soviet Union, and Communist China, in one
 way or another, use both the sword and the
 olive branch to protect and to extend their
 interests.  It is not the force of history but
 single events produced by individual deci-
 sions which determine which shall be used.
 We have, taken a dangerous step forward
 through our policy of increasing escalation of
 the war, one 'which puts us on a direct col-
 lision course with China.  This could be the
 ultimate tragedy in Sino-American relations.
 War with China would not win the predomi-
 nantly guerrilla war in South Vietnam.  It

 gested that specific dates for their self-gov-
 ernment be set as objectives of American
 policy.
 We know from Cordell Hull's memoirs that
 President Roosevelt heartily endorsed that
 policy.  He believed that French dominion
 over Indochina should not be restored.  At
 the Cairo and Teheran Conferences he urged
 that it be placed under an international trus-
 teeship as a final step toward independence.
 Cordell Hull records that only Prime ? Min-
 ister Churchill disagreed, and he quotes
 Roosevelt as saying:
 "The only reason [the British] seem to op-
 pose it is that they fear the effect it would
 have on their possessions and those of the
 Dutch.  They have never liked the idea of a
 trusteeship because it is, in some instances,
 aimed at future independence.
 "Each case must, of course, stand on its
 own feet, but the case of Indochina is per-
 fectly clear.  France has milked it for 100
 years.  The people of Indochina are entitled
 to something better than that."
 Today we are paying the price for our
 failure to carry out that policy.  Within 10
 years of the end of the war, the British, the
 Dutch, and the French largely recognized,
 after years of war and the expenditure of
 billions of dollars, that colonialism is a thing
 of the past.  It is the United States that
 has failed to recognize what Mr. Roosevelt
 knew to be true: the era of white rule in
 Asia is finished, whether it takes the form
 of economic exploration through direct rule
 or the form of manipulating governments to
 protect what we regard to be our interest-
 the postwar American form of colonialism.
 Roosevelt's  policy died  with  him.  Our
 primary Interest became one of bowing to
 French wishes in all international matters
 to guarantee her support and participation
 in NATO, and we began financing the French
 effort to recapture Indochina.  We put over
 $1 %4  billion into that futile struggle.  And
 when the French finally gave up, we took
 It over ourselves.
 WANTED: A WESTERN FOOTHOLD
 All in all, it has cost American taxpayers
 $6r/y  billion, exclusive of the cost of our
 own forces, to try to keep a Western foothold
 in southeast Asia.  Some writers are working
 hard to convince the American people that all
 we are doing is maintaining a historic Amer-
 lean policy.               Journalistic spokesmen for the
 Defense Department are vehement in  de-
 claiming that to lose our foothold in Viet-
 nam is to lose all we fought for in the Pa-
 cific in World War II.
 Nothing is further from the truth. Never
 in our history have we had any kind of foot-
 hold on the mainland of Asia.  Before World
 War II, the most we ever had was the Philip-
 pines, which we voluntarily relinquished in
 1935 and formally freed in 1945.  Since 1945,
 we have maintained base rights in the Philip-
 pines, as in Japan; and we have kept a base
 in Okinawa, won by conquest.      Our present
 foothold in South Korea is a legacy of World
 War II, not its objective.
 What these Defense Department spokes-
 men really have in mind are not the strictly
 American footholds and bases in that part
 of  the  world but the  whole  network  of
 French, Dutch, and British possessions that
 in World War II were freely used by Ameri-
 cans in the prosecution of the war against
 Japan.   The possibility that these staging
 areas should no longer be available for use
 at our pleasure vis-a-vis China is for many
 of them so unthinkable that they believe it
 is worth a war to retain at least one of
 them.
 When France finally gave up the struggle
 In Indochina, the United States refused to
 >ign the Geneva Accord of 1954, which ended
 the war.  And we prevailed upon a new gov-
 =ment we had chosen to back in South
 rietnam not to sign it either.  We began
 o send military aid early in 1955, and we,
 long with South and North Vietnam, were
 Sion to be in violation of the treaty.
 The sad truth is that the threats by lead-
 ing American officials to make war on Chin&
 and the present war crisis, are the logical
 end of the dismal road in Indochina thair
 John Foster  Dulles set us upon  in  1954,
 After failing in his efforts to keep the French
 fighting on in Indochina, despite American
 aid to their war effort and the promise of
 direct U.S. military action, Dulles refused to
 put the signature of the United States on
 the Geneva agreement of 1954 which marked
 the end of French rule there.  South Viet-
 nam also declined to sign.  The most the
 United States said about the   1954 agree-
 ment was that we would recognize it as in-
 ternational 14%w and regard violations with
 grave concern and as seriously threatening
 international peace and security.
 Among the provisions of the 1954 accords
 was article 16:  With effect from the date of
 entry into force of the present agreement,
 the introduction into Vietnam of any troop
 reinforcements and additional military per-
 sonnel is prohibited."
 An exception was made for rotation of
 personnel, meaning French, already there.
 Article 17 provided: "(a) With effect from
 the date of entry into force of the present
 agreement, the introduction into Vietnam,
 of any reinforcements in the form of all
 types of arms, munitions, and other war ma-
 terial, such as combat aircraft, naval craft;
 pieces of ordnance, jet engines, and jet weap-
 ons and armored vehicles is prohibited."
 Again, an exception was made for replace=
 ment on the basis of piece for piece of the
 same type and with similar characteristics.
 Article 18: "With effect from the date of
 entry into force of the present agreement,;
 the establishment of new military bases is
 prohibited through Vietnam territory."
 For 10 years we have claimed that North
 Vietnam was violating the accord by sending'
 in help to the rebels against the South Viet-
 namese Government.  But our solution was
 not to go to the parties who signed the
 agreement and who were responsible for its
 enforcement.  Nor did we go to the United
 Nations, the sole international body with
 jurisdiction over threats to the peace.
 Instead we multiplied our own violations
 by joining in the fighting.  Each time we
 increase the number of American boys sent
 to that country to advise the local troops we
 violate  the  Geneva    Agreement  of  1954.
 Every jetplane, every helicopter, every naval
 vessel we furnish South Vietnam or man
 with American  servicemen is a     violation,
 and so is every military base and airstrip
 we have constructed there.
 Yet we  hypocritically  proclaim   to  our-
 selves and the world that we are there only
 to enforce the Geneva agreement.
 Part of the 1954 agreement established an
 International Control Commission of Poland,
 India, and Canada to investigate complaints
 of violations.  As early as its report covering'
 1956, this Commission found both North and
 South Vietnam had violated the accords of
 1954,  the  latter  in  conjunction  with  the
 U.S. military aid activities.
 Immediately upon the signing of the 1954
 agreement, the United States began to sup-
 port the new government of South Vietnam
 in a big way.   In the letter President Eisen-
 hower wrote President Diem, a letter still
 serving as the basis for our policy in 1964,
 aid was pledged to Diem, and in turn, "the
 Government of the United States expects
 that this aid will be met by performance on
 the part of the Government of Vietnam in
 undertaking needed reforms."
 NO FREEDOM OR DEMOCRACY IN SOUTH
 VIETNAM
 In  1965,  President  Johnson  refers  to
 that letter as the basis for our aid, but
 the part about reforms has long since been
 forgotten.
 In the decade following 1954, the United
 9565
 States for all practical purposes made a pro-
 tectorate out of South Vietnam.   Its new
 government immediately became financially
 dependent upon us; as rebellion against it
 grew, our level of aid was stepped up. By
 1961, we had to.send 15,000 American troops
 as "advisers" to the local  military forces.
 Today, the figure is 23,000.
 When the Diem government diverted itself
 from fighting rebels to fighting Buddhists, a
 coup  by military  proteges of  the  United
 States overthrew it.  Within a few weeks,
 another coup replaced the Minh junta with
 what American advisers considered a more
 efficient military junta under General Khanh.
 In turn, the Khanh government has been
 succeeded by a series of coalitions, the cur-
 rent one being headed by Tran Van Huong.
 At no time have the people of this un-
 fortunate country had a government of their
 own choosing.  In fact, the Khanh junta
 justified its coup with the excuse that some
 Minh officers were pro-French, and might
 seek some way of neutralizing the country.
 Just how these various creations of the U.S.
 Government differ from  the  old  Bao Dai
 government  which  served as  the  French
 puppet, I have never been able to see. Yet
 American leaders talk piously of defending
 freedom in South Vietnam.
 We say that one of our objectives is the
 enforcement of the 1954 agreement. But it
 has never been explained why we have any
 business enforcing by force of arms an agree-
 ment to which neither we nor our client
 country is a signatory.
 Nor is it explained why enforcement can
 only take the form of massive violations by
 ourselves of articles 16, 17, and 18 of that
 agreement.
 SIMILAR  PROVISIONS  GOVERN  LOAS
 In the case of Laos, we did sign the Geneva
 accord of 1962, along with 13 other nations,
 which sought to  neutralize that country.
 Hence, we claim that the violations we have
 committed ourselves were undertaken only
 after North Vietnam violated the accord first.
 Our violations have taken the form first, of
 sending armed planes flown  by American
 pilots over Laos for reconnaissance purposes
 and more recently to carry out armed attacks
 within the country.
 The 1962 agreement permits military equip-
 ment to be brought into the country at the
 request of the Laotian Government.   But
 article 4 of the Loatian accord reads: "The
 introduction of foreign regular and irregular
 troops, foreign paramilitary formations and
 foreign military personnel into Laos is pro-
 hibited."
 Today, we know the United States has
 violated article 4 by sending our military
 personnel into Laos.  That they fly over the
 country and bomb it from the air rather than
 from the ground does not alter the  case.
 Our air raids in Laos are every bit as much
 a violation of the agreement as the viola-
 tions we believe North Vietnam has com-
 mitted.
 That is  why I said at the outset that
 neither you nor I know whether this coun-
 try considers itself bound by that agreement;
 nor do we know what policy in Laos may have
 replaced it,
 One of the speculations in Washington?
 and speculation is the most we have to go on
 about our policy in Asia-is to the effect that
 the raids were undertaken to convince North
 Vietnam and ultimately China that we would
 not be pushed out of southeast Asia and were
 prepared to expand the war if North Vietnam
 did not stop her alleged encouragement of
 rebels in South Vietnam.
 If this is in fact the purpose of the raids,
 which have been. going on since last June,
 what have they accomplished?
 Has anyone heard North Vietnam ask to
 negotiate?  Has  anyone heard  of a  Viet-
 cong  surrender?  To  the  contrary.                                                                                                                               The
 Vietcong raids have become more daring and
 more successful in the last 6 months than

 "After 16 years of ruinous civil war surely
 commonsense would dictate to Washington
 that a political, not a military solution, is the
 answer."
 Although India is the one country of Asia
 most threatened by China, even India has no
 desire to see a war break out, because in con-
 ditions of war between the United States and
 anyone in Asia, nuclear weapons would be
 used sooner or later.  Moreover, like Aus-
 tralia, India knows that in war, nations lose
 control of events.  Nations are controlled
 by wars, and not the other way around.
 Prime Minister Shastri of India has just
 recently renewed his request that the United
 States seek a negotiated and not a military
 solution.  And Prime Minister Sato of Japan
 has closed his talks with President Johnson
 without committing his country to an en-
 dorsement or condemnation of anyone in
 southeast  Asia.  That  is  the  most  sym-
 pathetic view of our position among any of
 the leading nations of Asia.
 How much further do we want to dig our-
 selves into this pit, started by the Eisenhower
 administration and deepened by the Ken-
 nedy administration?
 FUTURE OF UNITED STATES IN ASIA UP TO
 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
 That question is going to have to be an-
 swered by President Johnson alone.  It is too
 bad that all these chickens have all come
 home to roost on his doorstep; but there
 they are.
 The resolution passed last August by Con-
 gress gave the President a blank check to
 use force in Asia.  As a legal statement it
 means little; but it was sought and given as
 a political backstop.  On two other occasions,
 similar resolutions authorizing a President to
 use armed force in given areas led right
 straight to war.   One was with Mexico in
 1846 and a second was with Spain in 1898.
 Those resolutions, like the current one, were
 supposed to prevent war by warning an ad-
 versary of our Intentions.  But both had to
 be followed by declarations of war.
 The question now is whether President
 Johnson can bring himself to do the only
 thing that can be done in Asia to escape an
 expanded war: to bring other Interested par-
 ties into a multilateral political agreement
 for southeast Asia.
 This could take the form of a United Na-
 tions jurisdiction along the lines proposed so
 wisely by President Roosevelt; or it could
 take the form of seeking a SEATO action
 that would police South Vietnam while a
 political solution is developed; or it could
 take the form of a new 14-nation conference
 among the same nations that arranged the
 1954 Geneva accord. '
 The further we go In expanding the war-
 the more agreements we violate and the more
 people we kill in the name of peace-the
 more military opposition we harden against
 us in North Vietnam and China-the more
 we alienate ourselves from the now-Com-
 munist nations In that part of the world-
 the more impossible any peaceful solution
 becomes.
 In the last 10 years, we have learned that
 we are not masters of events in Vietnam,
 despite our billions of dollars and our thou-
 sands of troops on the scene.  It has not
 been shown that any stepped-up investment.
 of blood or money will make us masters.
 It still is not too late for President John-
 son to lead the American people out of this
 morass.  Whether he leads us out or further
 in, will be the first great test of his admin-
 .stration.
 IDEA FOR SEA-GRANT COLLEGES
 Mr. PELL.  Mr. President, this Nation
 is convinced that going to the moon is
 a worthwhile objective and the Federal
 Government is spending billions of dol-
 lars for this purpose. As it should have
 been, this decision was reached after
 considerable public and private study
 and debate. Now, I think it is time that
 national recognition be given to a rela-
 tively unexplored frontier right here on
 earth which holds countless riches and
 the key to solving many of the problems
 posed by a mushrooming population.  I
 speak of the oceans, which many scien-
 tists claim we know relatively less about
 than the surface of the moon.  In view
 of the recent camera probes of the moon's
 surface, these scientists may be right.
 Yet, the oceans cover two-thirds of
 the globe's surface.  In a world where
 at least 500 million humans suffer from
 extreme critical deficiencies of animal
 proteins, the seas contain untapped sup-
 plies of fish, shellfish, and crustaceans.
 The oceans also contain most of the
 earth's minerals. Many of the nations-
 faced with searing droughts-are washed
 by these same mineral-saturated waters.
 In connection with problems of the
 scope of the oceans and our mastery of
 them on an international basis, I well
 recall how much we have yet to learn
 from my experience as an American dele-
 gate to the initial meeting of the Inter-
 governmental Maritime Consultative Or-
 ganization-IMCO-in London in 1959.
 The seas also present some unique
 problems to us as a nation.  Marine
 pollution in terms of chemicals, sewage,
 water temperatures, and-in some case-
 radioactive materials is a growing threat
 to the fishing, shellfishing, and recrea-
 tion industries.  As the- population ex-
 pands and new industrial complexes rise,
 these problems will become more press-
 ing.
 Meanwhile, our fishing fleets face the
 prospect of being forced from the high
 seas because of economic pressures and
 unnecessary technological lags. Once the
 second largest fishing nation in the world
 we now stand fifth after Peru, Japan,
 Red China, and Russia.
 Other leading nations of the world are
 becoming increasingly conscious of the
 oceans and their potentials of research
 and development in food supply, mineral
 resources, and military application.
 President Johnson, in his idea for the
 Great Society, I am sure, thinks in terms
 of the contribution to be made in the
 years ahead by the mighty seas.  Presi-
 dent Kennedy stated in a message to
 Congress:
 Knowledge of the oceans is more than a
 matter of curiosity.  Our very survival may
 hinge upon it.
 These are some of the problems and
 challenges, but what are we doing about
 them?  As a nation, are we doing
 enough?  What should we be doing that
 we are not?  Specifically what benefits
 can be realized from greater efforts in the
 marine sciences?  I would like to try
 and answer some of these questions to-
 day, not only because of Rhode Island's
 long heritage as a marine-oriented State,
 but also because of the benefits that the
 Nation and the world can realize.
 Fortunately, the economic potential of
 developing our marine resources has been
 documented very carefully by a distin-
 guished committee of the National Acad-
 emy                                                                                         of  Sciences-National  Research
 Council.                    This group reported that with-
 in the next 10 to 15 years oceanographic
 research could bring benefits-either in
 annual savings or new annual produc-
 tion-worth $5.7 billion. The areas where
 these benefits could be realized are in
 fisheries, the development of ocean-floor
 mineral deposits, improved long-range
 weather  forecasting,  improved  near-
 shore sewage disposal methods, expan-
 sion of near-shore recreational oppor-
 tunities, and lower shipping costs to the
 United States.  These benefits are in
 addition to those that would accrue to
 our national defense effort.  This factor
 should not be overlooked, since past ex-
 perience has shown that ocean conditions
 and processes influence all phases of na-
 val activities.
 There is also every indication that
 given the proper assistance and the right
 atmosphere,  many  private  companies
 will step up their marine research and
 development activities, creating signifi-
 cant new industries and jobs.
 Keeping what I have said in mind, it
 is apparent that steps toward tapping
 these vast ocean resources depend-at
 least initially-on Federal and State sup-
 port of research in the marine sciences.
 The Federal Government has partially
 recognized its responsibilities in this re-
 spect with sharply increased budgets for
 oceanographic research.  In fiscal 1958,
 the first time the Government surveyed
 its spending in this field, it was deter-
 mined that $23 million was being spent.
 In 1963, the total had climbed to $124
 million.  The projections for 1972 are
 that the Federal oceanographic effort
 may have a $350 million budget or more.
 The Federal plans are fine as far as
 they go, but I believe there are some big
 gaps in our thinking.  Let me explain.
 Some interesting parallels have been
 drawn between the state of agriculture
 in our country and the slow decline in
 the fishing industry.
 I am particularly conscious of the role
 that fish and ocean products can have in
 fulfilling human protein requirements
 from my role as Coast Guard officer in
 charge of the restoration of the Sicilian
 fishing industry at the end of World War
 II, when our objective was to feed the
 hungry Sicilian people as quickly as pos-
 sible.
 In 1820 one American farmer was pro-
 ducing enough food, fiber, and related
 products for himself and four other peo-
 ple.  Today, this farmer's descendants
 produce enough food to feed himself and
 31 others, including 5 persons in for-
 eign countries.
 On the other hand, fishermen-par-
 ticularly in this country-are hunters in
 an environment they don't understand
 too well.  Seventy-two percent of the
 American fishing fleet was from 11 to 50
 years old in 1962, according to statistics

 gathered by the Bureau of Commercial
 Fisheries.  This agency,, reported that
 the average medium-sized trawler asY.--
 ing North Atlantic watgrs was built., in
 1941.  Small trawlers are even older--
 the average vessel having been built in
 1938.
 Meanwhile, we are faced by increased
 foreign competition. J4, April 1964? the
 Bureau of Commercial F%sheries reported
 that for the first time imports provided
 over half the U.S, supply of fishery
 products.  Nevertheless,, the fishing ItL-
 dustry employs-either directly or indi-
 rectly-over 500,000 people and fisher-
 men received, according to the latest
 available statistics, over $370 million for
 their catch.  It can be conservatively
 estimated that you should multiply, the
 latter figure by three or four to get the
 true value of the catch to the American
 economy.  In this case, we are talking
 about an industry worth in excess of $1
 billion which Is slowly being eroded away
 by foreign competition and lagging tech-
 nological progress.
 The answer, I believe, is something
 that has been called sea-grant colleges,
 similar in concept to the land-grant col-
 leges which have done samuch for Amer-
 ican agriculture.  Within the sea-grant
 universities could ;he colleges of aquacul-
 ture, marine aquacultural experiment
 stations, fishery extension services, and
 seagoing fishing port agents.
 At first glance, this whole idea may be
 a .bit startling, but it has been advanced
 by,       and knowing marine scientists.
 I think the Congress should do its part
 in advancing the idea, and I intend to
 explore this concept further.  It is' evi-
 dent that this idea is already evolving
 and taking form because it makes sense
 and is in reality a` necessity for the sur-
 vival of the fishing industry.
 I am happy to report that Rhode Is-
 land has already taken the leadership
 in this direction.  The nucleus for- this
 leadership is at the University of Rhode
 Island which has been doing basic re-
 search in oceanography and the marine
 sciences since 1937, when it established
 a small laboratory at the mouth of t ar-
 ragansett Bay.
 In the short span of less than three
 decades, this small laboratory has groom
 into a $7 million marine' research com-
 plex that includes Federal, State, and
 university facilities. It is also the head-

 MEDICARE TESTIMONY, MAY 7
 Mr. HARTKE.  Mr. President, the Fi-
 nance Committee today continued its
 hearing on H.R. 6675.  Five witnesses
 presented testimony dealing with what
 we have commonly come to call medi-
 care. I offer once more, and ask unani-
 mous consent that it may appear in the
 RECORD, a brief summary digest, prepared
 by my staff and entirely unofficial, of the
 testimony of the day.
 There being no objection, the summary
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 AMERICAN NURSING HOME ASSOCIATION
 Dr. Carl E. Becker, clergyman of the Amer-
 loan Lutheran Church and administrator of
 the Lincoln Luthern Home, Racine, Wis.,
 president since 1960 of the Wisconsin Nurs-
 ing Home Association.  American Nursing
 Home Association comprises over 5,000 nurs-
 ing homes, including 10 to 15 percent non-
 profit homes.
 1. Proposes amendment to allow conversion
 of home health visits to additional nursing
 home days at 2 for 1, allowing a maximum
 of 25 added nursing home days instead of 50
 home visits (out of the 100 available).  This
 would parallel (in section 1832) provisions,
 or converting unused hospital days into
 nursing home days (section 1812).
 2. Proposes deletion of "listing" (section
 1  63) as inappropriate in a standards sec-
 >i on, leaving the secretary to consult with
 '4ational  (listing or)  accrediting bodies."
 iection 1865 on accreditation should specify
 h e National l Council for the Accreditation of
 i*ising Homes, whose chairman is also a
 l?uber of the Joint Commission on Accred-
 a tion of Hospitals.
 I. Proposes additional specification (sec-
 s 1867) of membership in the Health In-
 ance Benefits Advisory Council by at least
 representative' of nonprofit and one of
 proprietary nursing homes among the 16
 members.
 4. Nursing home provisions should take ef-
 fect at the same time as hospital provisions,
 not 6 months later. Otherwise nursing home
 patients will seek transfer to hospitals at
 greater cost in order to receive benefits.  The
 3-day hospital stay for nursing home eli-
 gibility should  likewise  be  eliminated                                                                   to
 avoid "caravans of ambulances" shifting pa-
 tients to secure eligibility.
 5. Proposes added standards: Fire-resistant
 building; disaster plan; a planned program
 of nursing care;  uniform accounting sys-
 tem (section 1861(j)).
 KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN, INC.
 Dr. Clifford H. Keene, general manager.
 Plan "provides most of the hospital and
 medical care services for over 1,200,000 per-
 sons through 14 hospital-based medical cen-
 ters and 29 outpatient clinics."
 1. Supports health care provisions of the
 bill, but believes they can be improved to
 give (a)  better health care and (b) incen-
 tives for controlling costs.
 2. Choice of plans  should be furnished
 comparable to the choice offered in the Fed-
 eral employees health benefits program.
 3. Direct service plans (Kaiser, Health In-
 surance Plan of New York; etc.) have direct
 responsibility for their own facilities and
 staff.  This provides "a built-in  incentive
 for economy of operation not present in the
 'fee-for-service' method of payment for medi-
 cal care," since increased treatment or hos-
 pitalization does not increase income. "Fee-
 for service" plans should be provided as "the
 dominant  pattern  in  this  country"  but
 should not be exclusive.
 4. There should be a financial incentive
 for effective utilization controls.
 RICHARD S. WILBUR, M.D.
 Internist, partner in Palo Alto Medical
 Clinic, Palo Alto, Calif.
 1. Protection should be against medical
 catastrophe, but the proposed coverage goes
 "well beyond" this.  "Total health care" pro-
 grams encourage increased utilization, in-
 creased  costs  of                                                                 administration  without
 comparable health values.  Result will be
 depletion of benefits fund.
 2. The ' program should be restricted "to
 those people who must have help now."
 3. "Ordinary working doctors" should be
 consultants in rewriting the bill.
 4. A separate "health oriented" agency
 should administer the plan.
 -          SHIRLEY POWELL MARLOW
 Mrs. Marlow is "a southern housewife,"
 Virginia Beach, Va.
 1. Strongly opposes the bill.
 2. Main objection: It tries to shift a basic
 personal moral obligation to Government.
 3. "Medicare" is already "a pretty cruel
 hoax," not doing what many expect.
 AMERICAN SOCIETY OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
 Dr. Malcolm S. M. Watts, San Francisco.
 Society has 8,000 members.
 1. All diagnostic services ordinarily super-
 vised                                                       by  physicians  should  be  in  the
 voluntary rather than basic coverage.
 2. Diagnostic service should not be tied to
 hospital  controlled facilities. only; should
 include physicians' offices and laboratories
 as well.
 S. A choice  of  programs comparable to
 that of the Federal Employees' Health Bene-
 fit Plan should be included.
 4. Benefits "should be extended to include
 truly catastrophic illness for the perhaps
 2 to 4 percent of beneficiaries who will really
 need it."
 5. Administration should be by "a quasi-
 Independent governmental board or com-
 mission."

 question is on agreeing to the amend-
 ment offered by the Senator from Mas-
 sachusetts [Mr. KENNEDY], on behalf of
 himself and other Senators, numbered
 162, to the amendment in the nature of a
 substitute, as amended, numbered 124,
 offered by the Senator from Montana
 '[Mr. MANSFIELD] and the Senator from
 Illinois [Mr. DIRKSEN].
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 suggest the absence of a quorum. I ask
 unanimous consent that the time for the
 quorum call to be charged to the time
 allotted to my side.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will
 call the roll.
 The Chief Clerk proceeded to call the
 roll.
 Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr.
 President, I ask unanimous consent that
 the order for the quorum call be re-
 scinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 How much time does the Senator yield
 to himself?
 Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr.
 President, I yield myself 1 hour.
 ' The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator from Massachusetts is recognized for
 1 hour.
 Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr.
 President, this amendment deals with a
 subject that has been the concern of
 Congress for almost 30 years.  In 1942,
 1943, 1945, 1947, and 1949 the House of
 Representatives passed statutes abolish-
 ing poll taxes in Federal elections, while,
 in the Senate, this issue was not allowed
 to come to a vote. In 1942, and again in
 1950, the poll tax requirement for voting
 was abolished by act of Congress for men
 in the Armed Forces. Just 3 years ago,
 under the very able leadership of the
 Senator from Florida, we passed the 24th
 amendment.

 9570                      CONGRESSIONAL RECORD   SENATE
 We have debated this matter for so
 many years because the overwhelming
 majority of the Members of the Senate
 know in their hearts Mat, used as a pre-
 requisite to voting, the poll tax is not
 right.  It is not logical.  It is not in
 keeping with the principles of our form
 of free government to tell a man that,
 in order to vote, he must pay a tax.
 Who are we protecting by abolishing
 the poll tax? We are protecting the
 Negro farmworker in Greenville, Miss.,
 whose average income,is $12 a week, and
 to whom the family poll tax is the equiv-
 alent of 1 day's pay.  We are protect-
 ipg the sharecropper in Alabama who
 earns $2 a day and does not get paid
 until the cotton comes In, but who never-
 theless must pay his poll tax in Novem-
 ber and December.    We are,saying to
 these hundreds of thousands of people:
 "We will not stand by and see your right
 to vote taken away because you are poor
 and have had no economic opportunity.
 We will not single you out of all the
 other citizens of the United States and
 place an economic hardship on your
 right to vote."
 The voting rights bill before us, which
 the President of the United States pre-
 sented to us so eloquently, as we all re-
 member, at the time of the crisis in
 Selma, Ala,, will have its greatest effect
 in State elections. It is designed to give
 Negro citizens the right to participate in
 the choice of their sheriffs, their mayors,
 their State legislators, and their Gover-
 nor-all the State and local officeholders
 whose activities have such an impact on
 their lives Including the officeholders
 who have been so prominent in discrim-
 inatory practices against -Negro-- citizens.
 Because of the importance of., these
 offices to the lives of these people, I be-
 lieve that the overwhelming majority of
 the Members of the Senate, know in
 their hearts that it is neither right, nor
 logical, nor in keeping with the princi-
 ples of our form of free government to
 tell a man that in order to vote in a State
 or local election he must pay a tax.
 All of us who are cosponsoring this
 amendment believe that the leadership,
 In its bill, has recognized these principles
 just as the great majority of Senators
 recognize it.
 I commend the distinguished majority
 leader and the distinguished minority
 leader for the interest they have shown
 in this subject.
 First. The leadership undertook to put
 in a provision, which is the present sec-
 tion 9, stating that there was evidence
 that poll taxes denied the right to vote,
 and directing the Attorney General to
 forthwith make a test of the constitu-
 tionality of poll taxes in the four States
 that still have them.
 This is extremely significant. It shows
 that the leadership and'the Senators who
 sponsored this amendment have the same
 strong feeling about poll taxes and are
 working toward the same end.
 I also commend the Attorney General
 for the interest he has 'shown in this is-
 sue.  The Department of Justice has
 been concerned with developing ways and
 means of insuring the abolition of poll
 taxes in State elections. This is typical
 of the leadership in the cause of equal
 rights that, the Attorney General has
 given this country, both in his present
 position and before.
 We are all agreed on purpose.  We dis-
 agree only on how to accomplish that
 purpose.  The nine members of the Ju-
 diciary Committee who introduced the
 original ban on the poll tax have been
 joined in cosponsorship of the amend-
 ment we are now considering by 30 other
 Senators of both parties.  With all due
 respect for both the ability and sincer-
 ity of the authors of the substitute, we
 believe that:
 Our methods will work and theirs may
 not.
 Our method will work quickly while
 theirs will work slowly.
 Ours clearly expresses the policy of
 Congress in this area while theirs leaves
 the making of policy to the courts.
 First, let me state what our amendment
 does.  It does not outlaw the poll tax,
 it merely says that the right to vote
 cannot be conditioned on its payment.
 Many States have poll taxes today, but
 collect them in other ways than by deny-
 ing people the right to vote.  Only Ala-
 bama, Mississippi, Virginia, and Texas
 make payment a precondition of voting
 in all State and local elections. It is to
 the people in these States that our
 amendment is directed.
 First, our amendment makes a strong
 congressional declaration that the pro-
 hibition of the poll tax requirement for
 voting is necessary to secure the rights
 guaranteed by the 14th and 15th amend-
 ments to the Constitution against denial
 or abridgement.
 Secondly, our bill forbids the collec-
 tion of such a tax as a precondition of
 voting.  It orders the Attorney General
 to sue forthwith against any State or
 local voting official who threatens to
 enforce such a tax.  In this we have
 tried to stay as close as possible to the
 procedure laid down by the Mansfield-
 Dirksen bill.  They seek a court test of
 constitutionality.  We seek a court test
 of constitutionality. But we sincerely
 believe that the chance of a favorable de-
 cision by the Court will be immensely
 strengthened under our version.  That
 is why I hope all who feel strongly about
 abolition of the poll tax will vote with us.
 Let me explain why we believe our ver-
 sion will do better in court:
 First, we make a strong congressional
 declaration that the prohibition of the
 poll tax as a voting requirement is neces-
 sary.  The courts always give a great
 weight to such declarations by Congress.
 The courts have said that they do this
 because Congress does have the ability to
 review the whole situation and gather all
 the evidence, while the courts can only
 look at the facts of the case before them.
 Congress can declare a national policy,
 while the courts can only decide the
 pending cases.
 The bill we are seeking to amend does
 not have a declaration of national policy.
 It merely says that evidence has been
 presented to_ Congress.  But what does
 it do with this evidence?  It does not
 take any action on it.  It merely passes
 it on to the courts. A great deal of evi-
 dence is presented to Congress on many
 subjects. But if Congress does not do
 May 7, 1965
 anything with it the evidence certainly
 loses persuasiveness.
 Our amendment does take action on
 the evidence.. It does so by prohibiting
 States and political subdivisions from
 enforcing the poll tax as a requirement
 for voting.  And that action, in our
 judgment, is going to be crucial to the
 court test.  Until Congress acts-and
 this is a very important point-until
 Congress acts, all the courts can do is
 decide whether existing State poll tax
 voting requirements are constitutional.
 The courts have never outlawed such a
 statute even though cases have been be-
 fore the courts in varying postures on
 four or five occasions.  But once Con-
 gress acts, the only question then before
 the courts is whether the act of Con-
 gress is reasonable.  Under our version
 all the Attorney General has to do when
 he goes into court is show that Congress
 could reasonably arrive at the declara-
 tion that prohibition of the poll tax was
 necessary to secure constitutional rights.
 Mr. President, the Nation's leading
 authority on constitutional law is Prof.
 Paul Freund,  of  the Harvard School
 of Law.  He is universally recognized as
 such.  It was he who spoke at the funeral
 of Mr. Justice Frankfurter.  It is he who
 is editing the history of the Supreme
 Court that Congress has authorized and
 funded.  He says on this subject, and I
 quote:
 Congress has the responsibility under the
 14th and 15th amendments that cannot be
 avoided by forcing issues of voting rights
 into the courts without the benefit of con-
 gressional declarations of policy, experience
 and judgment.
 He does not say evidence.  He says
 declarations of policy.  This is what our
 amendment has and the present bill does
 not have.
 We have received expressions of sup-
 port  for the  constitutionality                                                                                                 of  our
 amendment from experts all over the
 country.  They include the dean of the
 Yale Law School, the associate dean of
 the St. Louis University Law School,
 professors at the University of Alabama
 Law School and many others.  But no
 one has stated the issue more succinctly
 than Professor Freund.  And with all.
 respect to the distinguished constitu-
 tional lawyers in this Chamber, I think
 his views are entitled to the most care-
 ful consideration.
 What the question really gets down to
 is this:
 We all want a quick Court determina-
 tion of constitutionality.  We all want
 the Attorney General to go into court as
 soon as he can.
 Are we going to send him in thei 'f
 with. the strongest possible case? Are vn
 going to give him a strong declaratik-li
 and action by Congress so he will =b
 in the best possible position?  Are rx
 going to give him the tools to do til
 job?
 Three times in the last 8 years we h-," passed bills that allowed the Attorl
 General to sue to protect voting rigl
 But these bills did not have the to
 They did not do the job, so each ti
 we had to come back and pass a new 1

 HEARINGS ON U.S. BALANCE OF
 PAYMENTS
 Mr. MUSKIE.  Mr. President, in ac-
 cordance with expectations, which I re-
 ported to the Senate a few days ago,
 printed copies are now available of the
 hearings conducted by the Subcommit-
 tee on International Finance of the
 Banking and Currency Committee an the
 continuing deficits in our balance of pay-
 ments and the resulting outflow of gold.
 Several distinguished officials of the
 Government, a number of outstanding
 economists expert in this field, and repre-
 sentatives of business and banking ap-
 peared before the committee. The pur-
 pose of the hearings was stated to edu-
 cate the members of the committee, the
 Congress, and the general public as to
 the nature and causes of the problem and
 as to proposed measures for dealing with
 it.
 Hearings began with statements by
 the Government officials-Mr. Dillon, the
 then Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Con-
 nor, the Secretary of Commerce, Mr.
 Martin, the Chairman of the Federal
 Reserve, Mr. Murphy, then Under Secre-
 tary of Agriculture, Mr. Griffith Johnson,
 Assistant Secretary of State, Mr. Hitch,
 Assistant Secretary of Defense, Mr. Bell,
 Administrator of AID, and Mr. Linder,
 President and Chairman of the Export-
 Import Bank.  These officials described
 the general nature of the problem, ex-
 plained the existing governmental pro-
 grams that affect it, and discussed the
 new administration programs for dealing
 with it.
 Economists then discussed the basic
 elements and principles involved and set
 forth views as to means of handling the
 problem of the deficit.  The representa-
 tives of banking and business also pre-
 sented their views as to the nature of the
 problem and measures for dealing with
 it.
 Following statements of the witnesses,
 significant points were further developed
 in question by members of the subcom-
 mittee.  In addition, the record of the
 hearings contains a number of state-
 ments, studies, and data developing par-
 ticular points, as well as various public
 statements bearing on the subject by
 distinguished public officials and experts.
 It is contemplated that hearings will
 be resumed in the near future.  As I an-
 nounced in the Senate earlier, Dr. Ed-
 ward M. Bernstein, who has been chair-
 man of a committee of experts which
 has recently completed a review of bal-
 ance-of-payments statistics and pre-
 pared a report recommending improve-
 ments, and who is an Outstanding expert
 on international financial economics, is
 scheduled to appear on May 17.  Other
 businessmen, bankers, and other experts
 in this field will be requested to appear
 when the schedule of the committee
 permits.

 ARIZONA's SENATOR FANNIN EARNS LABEL OF
 "MAN WHO SUCCEEDS"-1 TO 100 SHOT FOR
 GOVERNOR, BUT HE WINS
 (By Willard Edwards)
 WASHINGTON, May 1.-When political lead-
 ers gather to pick a slate of candidates for a
 forthcoming campaign, an embarrassing si-
 lence sometimes falls when volunteers are
 sought in a virtually hopeless cause.
 The problem arises when someone must be
 found to seek a political office which has al-
 ways been won by the opposition party with
 no indication that the voters are inclined to
 disturb this precedent.
 NEED FOR SACRIFICE
 If the chief of the parley is a diplomat, he
 may inquire, not without a note of sarcasm,
 along this line:
 "Is some loyal member of the party avail-
 able to sacrifice himself in this effort?"
 On a somewhat lower level, he might ask:
 "Have we got a sucker for this spot?"
 Such was the situation in 1958 in Arizona
 when Republican Party leaders began con-
 sidering the selection of a candidate for Gov-
 ernor of the State.  They had been encour-
 aged in 1952 by the astonishing victory of
 their candidate for the U.S. Senate, a Phoenix
 department store owner named Barry Gold-
 water.  He had ousted a veteran Democratic
 incumbent, Senator Ernest McFarland, Sen-
 ate major leader.
 STATEHOUSE HOPES DIM
 Goldwater now was running for a second
 term and GOP hopes were high for his re-
 election.                                                                                                                                                                   However, registered Democrats still
 outnumbered Republicans in the State by
 3 to 1 and the widest hopes of the party
 leaders did not extend to capturing the state-
 house.
 Arizona had never had a Republican gov-
 ernor and the experts could detect no popu-
 lar surge to elect one.  The need was for
 a willing victim to endure the hardships of
 a campaign without the slightest hope of vic-
 tory.
 Goldwater's brother, Robert, had roomed
 at Stanford University 30 years earlier with
 PAUL J. FANNIN, son of a transplanted Ken-
 tuckian who had come to Arizona in 1907 for
 his health.   The friendship had remained
 firm as FANNIN and his brother, Ernest, con-
 verted a small hardware store into a pros-
 perous distributing business which stretched
 into several States.
 FANNIN, then 51, had never been active in
 politics.   He was a poor speaker and un-
 versed in the strategy of wooing votes.  How-
 ever, he was highly respected, possessed of
 the necessary means, and widely known in
 the State through his business activities,
 BARRY STUDIES CHANCES
 When FANNIN was suggested as a candi-
 date for governor and proved not unwilling
 to make the sacrifice, Goldwater toured the
 State to survey his prospects.
 "Well," he reported to FANNIN, "it's pos-
 sible that you might have a chance."  This
 was accepted as polite encouragement to one
 willing to give his all to the party. The
 betting against FANNIN was 100 to 1 with
 no takers.  The winner of the Democratic
 primary already was celebrating his certain
 victory in November.
 With the temerity of the innocent who
 venture  where  angels  will  not,  FANNIN
 plunged  into a campaign which astonished
 all.  He almost literally "walked" the huge
 State, shaking hands with thousands, invad-
 ing the smallest villages, voicing his ideas
 about government, sometimes haltingly, but
 with an impressive sincerity.
 There being no objection, the article                         On election day, the experts surveyed the
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,               results with unbelieving eyes.  FANNIN had
 as follows:                                            won by 35,000 in his first race for office,

 CONGRESSIONAL. RECORD - SENATE             May 7, 1965
 When Goldwater had upset similar odds 6
 years earlier, he had won by only 6,500 votes.
 Arizona's first Republican governor was
 reelected in 1960 by the largest majority
 ever given a gubernatorial candidate in the
 State.  He was elected to a third term in
 1962.  In 1964, be was asked again to make
 a sacrifice which could remove him from
 politics, perhaps forever.
 He was induced to file as a candidate for
 the Senate on a standby basis pending the
 outcome of Goldwater's bid for the Republi-
 can nomination for the Presidency.  If Gold-
 water should fail in this attempt, it was un-
 derstood that FANNIN would withdraw and
 permit Goldwater to run for a third Senate
 term.  It would then be too late for FANNIN
 to file for any office.
 He was relieved of this gentleman's agree-
 Mont when Goldwater gained the GOP presi-
 dential nomination.  FANNIN remained on
 the ticket as candidatefor the Senate.
 Again, on election day, the experts were
 cpnfounded.  Goldwater captured his home
 State's b electoral votes by a narrow margin
 of 4,000 votes, FANNIN  ran ahead of him
 by 10,005 votes, winning the Senate seat by
 a,comfortable 14,000 margin.
 Today, the political tyro of 7 years ago sits
 in the seat formerly occupied by Goldwater
 Whose political future is uncertain..  The new
 Senator from Arizona would be the first to
 admit that he does not possess the quick
 mind, the witty personality, and the charm
 and gayety which helped thrust his predeces
 sal' to the political heights.  His friends gay
 he has the dogged persistence, the capacity
 for study, the ambition to learn 'which were
 not easily visible as Goldwater's outstanding
 characteristics.
 "He grows on you," an associate said.
 "It's hard to assess the political ingredient
 which makes him a winner.  Perhaps It's the
 utter sincerity which he projects and which
 was Eisenhower's greatest attribute.  He's no
 Orator but people listen to him and believe
 him."
 Some measure of FANNIN's ability may be
 gained from his record as Governor.   Facing
 a Hostile legislature in which the senate had
 97 Democrats and 1 Republican, he called
 4 special sessions and made 4 recommenda-
 tions, winning approval of them all, an al-
 most unprecedented accomplishment in the
 State's  legislative  history.  Among  other
 things, he killed a thriving racket in liquor
 licenses which were being handled as a mo-
 nopoly by a small group and being leased for
 as much as $60,000 a license.  He also put
 through a program for much needed im-
 provemelits in the State's educational system.
 In an interview, he +disclosed the project
 closest to his heart-a somewhat amazing
 program of international cooperation be-
 tween Arizona and the State of Sonora in
 Mexico, which lies just south of the border.
 He sees the beginnings of a common market
 of the Americas In the joint development of
 the two States which are the fastest growing
 in their respective republics.
 FANNIN  and the Governor of Sonora at
 that time, Alvara Obregon, formed a per-
 manent' committee in 1959 to expand cul-
 tural and trade relations between the two
 States.  The result has been greatly increased
 travel between them, the birth of new busi-
 nesses, Cooperative programs between State
 universities, and increased investments by
 Arizona banks in Sonora.
 CITED BY MEXICO
 Some businessmen see in this development
 the basis for a common market which is es-
 sential if the United States is to meet the
 growing Competition of the European Com-
 mon Market in Latin America.
 In Mexico, his efforts are so highly appre-
 ciated that he was recently awarded a plaque
 proclaiming him the Latin American equiv-
 alent of "Man of the Year."
 FANNIN is a big, rangy man-6 feet 11/2
 inches, 185 pounds.  He keeps fit and was a
 famous softball pitcher in his day, playing on
 championship teams where he was hailed as
 "WINDMILL" FANNIN because of a sweeping
 delivery.
 His seriousness matches his size. However,
 as he talked, losing self-consciousness in the
 interest of his subject, a lively imagination,
 a quiet sense of humor, and a sensitivity to
 injustice began to emerge.
 INTERESTED  IN INDIANS'  WELFARE
 He  became  almost  eloquent  about  the
 plight of the American Indian, the ignored
 minority when welfare state billions are be-
 ing passed out.                                                                                                 Arizona has more Indians
 [83,000] than any other State. Taking the
 floor for the first time in connection with
 pending legislation last month, the Senator
 discussed the inadequacies of the adminis-
 tration's $1.3 billion aid-to-education bill.
 "I must protest," he said, "against a form-
 ula that would give the 10 wealthiest coun-
 ties                                                                 in the United States nearly  $9 mil-
 lion and 10 of the poorest counties only
 half that much.  And I protest the implica-
 tion that the Federal Office of Education can
 do better than what the States and local
 school districts have been doing since the
 beginning of our Republic.
 "In my State, we happen to have a con-
 tinuing demonstration of the Federal Gov-
 ernment's competence in this field.  Despite
 the solemn treaty obligation of the United
 States to provide thousands of Indian chil-
 dren with adequate education and health
 facilities, the government has clearly failed.
 "Of 28,191 Navajo children on the Arizona
 portion of the reservation, virtually all from
 poverty  stricken  families,  approximately
 3,500 were not enrolled in any kind of school.
 Three-fourths of the adult population can-
 not speak, read, or write English."
 Recently, a veteran. Republican colleague
 found him poring over a book on the Sen-
 ate's parliamentary rules, an intricate maze
 of rulings and precedents which few can
 decipher.
 "Oh, Hell, Paul," said the elder.  "Don't
 bother with that.  If you do something
 wrong, someone will be around to tell you."
 The freshman Senator went on studying.
 He does not appear to be the type who waits
 for someone to tell him he is wrong.
 MAN OF THE YEAR
 Mr. DIRKSEN.  I. President, on
 April 29 there was published in the Chi-
 cago Tribune an editorial on the sub-
 ject "Man of the Year."  I believe it is
 quite important and deserves wider cir-
 culation. I ask unanimous consent that
 it be Printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Chicago Tribune, Apr. 29, 19851
 MAN  OF  THE YEAR
 The Tribune today presents the real "Man
 of the Year."
 He was not picked by the Junior Associa-
 tion of Commerce, or by the Senior Associa-
 tion of Commerce, or by the politicians, or
 by any association of newspaper men.  You
 won't find his picture in the papers. You
 may not -recognize him as you pass him on
 the street, But we hope you do.
 Our "Man of the Year" is In the middle
 income brackets. He gets up every morning
 at 6:50 so that he can get to his job in an
 office or factory at 8 or 8:30. He works hard,
 not only because he wants advancement, but
 because he thinks his employer deserves a
 fair deal.  He is honest and dependable.
 Our "Man of the Year" manages to get
 along with one wife.  They have three or
 four children, whom they love so much they
 teach them to be respectful, law abiding,
 and self-reliant.  They have done their best
 to earn and save enough money to send their
 children to college, but the rising costs of
 higher education make this goal more dif-?
 ficult each year.
 The rising cost of everything also, makes
 it harder to put aside money for retirement.
 Recent Federal income tax reductions have
 helped the people in high income brackets
 and low income brackets, but the man in the
 middle has got little benefit.  There are no
 loopholes in the Income tax for him, and he
 can't put any money into tax-exempt secu-
 rities.
 Social security taxes, which started at $30
 a year, are now up to $174.  Soon the medi-?
 care program will make them much higher.
 Local property taxes have doubled, and so
 have the various State taxes.  Worst of all,
 the purchasing power of the dollar is only
 42 percent of what it was when our "Man of
 the Year" bought his first insurance policy
 in 1937.  The little money which he has set.
 aside for a rainy day is worth about half
 of what it was when he earned it.
 Our "Man of the Year" belongs to a church
 and works at his religion.  He is no saint,
 but he understands the biblical meaning of
 neighbor and tries to be decent to men of
 all races and creeds.  You won't find him,
 however,  in  civil  disobedience  demon-
 strations.                                                                                                                                             He believes laws ought to be en-
 forced.
 Our "Man of the Year"' is not ashamed to
 be considered a patriot.  He flies the flag
 on national holidays.  lIe can't understand.
 Americans who  join    organizations  dedi-
 cated to the destruction of America.                                                                                                                                             He
 can't understand legislators and judges who
 strive to undermine law and order, or to
 feather their own nests.
 Our "Man of the Year" believes in our sys-
 tem of government.  He votes at every elec-
 tion, but he votes only once.
 For all his merits, we salute him.
 THE SILO-SOVIET DISPUTE ON WAR
 AND THE NATIONAL LIBERATION
 OF VIETNAM
 Mr. DIRKSEN.  Mr. President, Mr.
 Robert D. Crane, who is a member of
 the Center for Strategic Studies at
 Georgetown University, has prepared an
 excellent article that involves, among
 other things, our problems abroad.  On
 a previous occasion I have had printed
 in the RECORD an article that he has
 done. There is further information here
 that I believe is at once constructive and
 useful.  It is a little lengthy, but it bears
 the title "The Sino-Soviet Dispute on
 War and National Liberation of Viet-
 nam."                                                                                                                                            It is extremely timely, and, not-
 wtihstanding its length, I believe it will
 prove extremely useful as a reference ar-
 ticle.                                                                                                                                   I ask unanimous consent that it
 be printed at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 THE SING-SOVIET DISPUTE ON WAR AND THE
 NATIONAL LIBERATION OF VIETNAM
 (By R. D. Crane)
 The most significant development during
 the past few months in the southeast Asian
 war has been the decision of the Soviet and
 Chinese Communist leaders to increase their
 overt military support of the war in Viet-
 nam. This new development has caused pol-
 icymakers for the first time publically to
 consider the risk of escalation as an impor-
 tant factor in determining U.S. policy to-
 ward southeast Asia. This new concern with
 the degree of risk involved in prosecuting
 the southeast Asian war has focused atten-

 May 7, 4965             CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 tion on the alliance problems within the
 Communist camp, and particularly on the
 nature and extent of the Sino-Soviet dispute.
 The fullest possible understanding of this
 dispute has become critical because Ameri-
 can policymakers are concluding that the fu-
 ture course of events in southeast Asia will
 be determined not merely by North Vietna-
 mese or Communist Chinese policy, but by
 Soviet  policy.   This important point was
 brought out in Secretary McNamara's an-
 nual defense posture statement to Congress
 on. February 18, 1965, when he said: "Unless
 there is a change in Soviet policy, it still
 appears doubtful that the Chinese Commu-
 nists will  deliberately initiate any  major
 overt aggression against their neighbors."
 The two most critical questions for an
 analysis of the impact of the Sino-Soviet
 dispute on the southeast Asian war there-
 fore are:  (1) What is the real issue in the
 Sino-Soviet dispute as it has developed dur-
 ing the past few years? and (2) What policy
 should the United States follow to prevent
 the adoption of a dangerously expansionist
 policy by the Soviet Union and to promote
 Soviet policies of greater moderation?  The
 answer we give to these two questions will be
 important in determining the whole course
 of American policy in Asia during the com-
 ing decade.
 THE SING-SOVIET DISPUTE
 Most of the, studies on the Sino-Soviet dis-
 pute conclude that this dispute is caused
 basically either ' by nationalism or by ide-
 ology or by some combination of the two?
 There is considerable evidence that the Sino-
 Soviet dispute is not caused basically by
 either of these two factors but rather by op-
 posing theories of how best to control con-
 flict, and particularly how to deter nuclear
 war, during the course of the world revolu-
 tion?  According to this view:
 1. Chinese and Soviet strategists are in
 complete agreement that nuclear war and
 even any serious risk of nuclear war must be
 rejected as rational instruments of policy.
 2. These strategists also agree that their
 advanced weapons are not necessary primar-
 ily for the defensive purpose of deterring cap-
 italist attack on their homelands, but are
 necessary for the offensive purpose of deter-
 ring U.S. Intervention in expansionist Com-
 munist wars of national liberation.
 3. The Chinese and Soviet strategists dif-
 fer primarily on how best to control conflict,
 especially by deterring nuclear war, during
 the course of the world revolution.
 4. The Chinese Communists believe that
 nuclear war can best be deterred by constant
 revolutionary pressure designed to promote
 isolationist tendencies in the United States.
 The Soviets believe that nuclear war can best
 be deterred, and revolutionary movements
 protected from armed U.S. opposition, if the
 Soviet Union can exploit an atmosphere of
 detente   to  achieve  superiority  over  the
 United    States in a few  critical advanced
 weapons.
 The decision of the Soviet and Chinese
 Communist leaders to increase their overt
 military  support  of  the war  in Vietnam
 might seem superficially to indicate the con-
 vergence of Soviet and Chinese Communist
 theories of conflict control and, therefore,
 the abandonment of the Soviet strategy of
 detente.  Further analysis, however, suggests
 that the Soviets and Chinese agree on the
 advisability of pressing for victory in the

 cent literature is Richard Lowenthal's "The
 Prospects for Pluralistic Communism," dis-
 sent (winter 1965)., pp. 103-143.

 southeast Asian war because developments
 during the past year both in Soviet advanced
 weaponry  and  in  the  national  liberation
 struggle have caused the Soviet and Chinese
 Communist strategists to conclude that their
 diverse theories of conflict control call for
 a common and mutually supporting policy
 of revolution in southeast Asia.  Some of
 the advances in Soviet weaponry, particular-
 ly  in Soviet antiballistic  missile                                                                     develop-
 ments, which may have influenced Soviet
 strategists, were discussed on February 11,
 1965, before the Senate Armed Sefvices Com-
 mittee.  Some of the isolationist develop-
 ments                                                                     in the intellectual climate in the
 United States, which may have influenced
 Chinese, strategists, were presaged by Sen-
 ator FULBRIGHT's speech a year ago on "Old
 Myths and New Realities" and were described
 on February 23, 1965, in a major speech by
 Senator THOMAS J. DODD, Democrat, of Con-
 necticut,  entitled  "Vietnam and  the New
 Isolationism."
 The response of Premier Khrushchev and
 of his principal military supporter, the late
 Marshal Biryuzov, to the new developments
 in Soviet weaponry and in U.S. foreign pol-
 icy may have been  the desire to  exploit
 the new Soviet weapons directly and dra-
 matically in a Cuba-type gamble to intimi-
 date the United States.  The opponents of
 Khrushchev, including Suslov and Marshals
 Sokolovskiy  and  Malinovskiy,  condemned
 such "harebrained" scheming.    The succes-
 sors of Khrushchev in the Soviet power struc-
 ture reportedly created instead a top-level
 national liberation commission composed of
 Presidium members.  Among them may be
 the individual to whom the Chinese Foreign
 Minister, Chen Yi, referred recently when he
 stated:  "We  expect nothing  from Khru-
 shchev's successors.                                                                             However, we firmly be-
 lieve                                                                     that the  Soviet people will  have a
 great leader in the not too distant future."
 Soviet strategy in the post-Khrushchev era
 has returned to the original Khrushchevian
 emphasis of the pre-Cuba crisis period on
 wars of national liberation, but has added
 two innovations: (1) a further shift toward
 the belief that the mere existence of the new
 Soviet weapons, particularly in conjunction
 with increases in their quality and quantity,
 is sufficient to limit the strategic goals of the
 United States and to deter any dangerous
 U.S. response to overt Soviet support of na-
 tional liberation wars, and (2) a new empha-
 sis on the promotion and exploitation of a
 continued detente with the United States
 both to use its threatened termination as a
 means of deterring U.S. intervention in na-
 tional liberation wars as well as to gain the
 many direct advantages that detente can pro-
 vide for the Soviet Union.
 The main points that emerge from the
 above analysis of the Sino-Soviet dispute as
 it affects American policy on southeast Asia
 are the following: (1) both the Chinese and
 the Soviets are in complete agreement on the
 need to avoid any great risks of escalation
 to nuclear war, and (2) although they differ
 principally in their theories about the nature
 of deterrence in the modern era of national
 liberation war, nevertheless recent develop-
 ments in Soviet weaponry and in U.S. think-
 ing about foreign policy have caused the
 Chinese and  Soviet strategists to proceed
 from their differing theories on deterrence to
 the conclusion that the time is now ripe to
 start a concerted effort finally to drive the
 United States and its allies off the rimland
 IMPICATIONS FOR U.S. POLICY
 The second of the two principal questions
 we must ask if we are meaningfully to ana-
 lyze the impact of the Sino-Soviet dispute on
 the war in southeast Asia is: What, policy
 should the United States follow in order to
 exert a moderating influence on the Soviet
 Union and thereby indirectly on Communist
 China?  This question is basic to Ameri j an
 9509
 foreign policy. It becomes acute only during
 periods of tensions such as we experienced
 during and after the Cuban missile crisis and
 are experiencing now.
 Most of the recent commentary on this
 question has warned against the alleged
 danger that an overly firm U.S. policy might
 push the Soviets into the arms of the Com-
 munist Chinese, thereby eliminating an im-
 portant moderating influence in the under-
 developed areas of the world, particularly
 in Asia.  It has been suggested that during
 Premier Kosygin's visit to Vietnam in Jan-
 uary 1965 the Chinese Communists trapped
 him  into  adopting  a  hardline  position
 against his will, and that we therefore must
 agree to neutralize South Vietnam in order
 to help Kosygin extricate himself from a
 dilemma.   Another   consideration,  which
 first became familiar during and after the
 Cuban missile crisis, is the alleged need to
 follow a conciliatory policy toward the So-
 viet leaders because the failure of their for-
 eign policies, once the Soviet Union has be-
 come committed for one reason or another
 to these policies, would cause a succession
 crisis that might result in a shift toward a
 hardline and perhaps even a Stalinist line in
 Soviet domestic and foreign policy.
 The behavior of the power-oriented Soviet
 leaders in past crises suggests, to the con-
 trary, that the best way to bring on such an
 unfortunate succession crisis would be for
 the United States to follow a conciliatory
 policy in southeast Asia.  Such a policy
 would serve merely to prove that the so-
 called hardliners in the Soviet Union are
 right in their contention that a maximum
 push in revolutionary warfare will inaugu-
 rate the third and final phase in the liquida-
 tion of capitalism.  The only way the United
 States can support the moderates in the So-
 viet Union and the Only way it can reduce
 the present ideological orientation of the
 Communist system is to combine a policy of
 maximum contact with Soviet individuals
 with a policy of maximum firmness in op-
 posing Communist aggression.  Instead of
 trying to support the moderates in the Soviet
 Union by adopting a conciliatory American
 foreign policy, we should try to support
 these moderates by frustrating and thereby
 undermining their hardline opponents.  Only
 when the Soviets are forced to recognize the
 Utopian nature of their global ambitions
 can we achieve any real success in our long-
 range policies of peaceful engagement and
 peaceful cooperation with the leaders and
 peoples of Russia.
 Specifically, in our policy toward south-
 east Asia, we should make it clear that we
 support the original goal  of  the  Geneva
 agreement of 1954, which called for free elec-
 tions In the country of Vietnam.  We should
 draw the conclusion, which the Communists
 have forced upon us, that the Communists
 do not want elections except on their own
 fraudulent terms.  If elections are to be free
 from Communist terrorism, the entire coun-
 try of Vietnam, both north and south, must
 first be liberated from Communist control.
 National liberation has been the goal of the
 Vietnamese leaders.  It was opposed by the
 French colonialists. It has been opposed by
 the United States on the pretext that the
 time was not opportune, but really because
 some American policymakers feared the pos-
 sibility of escalation from the national lib-
 eration  war  that                                                                                                                                      the  Vietnamese  people
 would have to fight in North Vietnam.
 During 1959 and 1960 special Vietnamese
 guerrilla forces liberated large areas in the
 northern areas of Vietnam extending as far
 north as the Chinese border.  These success-
 ful liberation efforts were forbidden by Amer-
 ican policymakers at the time because they
 feared that the very success of such a libera-
 tion movement would provoke a Chinese
 launched invasion under a Soviet nuclear

 umbrella and therefore jeopardize the in-
 dependence ofall of southeast Asia.
 The resulting abandonment of what prom-
 ised                 to be  the first successful national
 liberation movement in Communist con-
 trolled Asia had an adverse local effect on
 the conflict in southeast Asia because  it
 caused bitterness and disillusionment among
 the Vietnamese intellectuals who had been
 struggling for 20 years to liberate and unify
 their ancient and proud country. Even more
 important, this forced abandonment was a
 milepost in the adoption of a defensive men-
 tality  among American  guerrilla warfare
 strategists. It provided the first classic ex-
 ample of the power of Communist psycho-
 strategic warfare to direct and control Ameri-
 can strategy in the underdeveloped world .n
 In order to exert a moderating Influence on
 Soviet and Chinese Communist policy, the
 United States must first reverse this defen-
 sive orientation of its strategic thinking on
 Asia.  Specifically, the United States must
 abandon its effort to force the Vietnamese to
 remain  at  the  tremendous  disadvantage
 which defending forces have in modern guer-
 rilla warfare. The United States must aban-
 don its efforts to force on the Vietnamese
 people the unpopular goal of containing (and
