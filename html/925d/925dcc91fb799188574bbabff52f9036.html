 *Con oo  Resolutions passed by the Coquilhatville confer-
 ence of Congolese leaders, as announced by Foreign Minister
 Bomboko yesterday, appear to reflect primarily the opinions
 of Leopoldville-based politicians; the_ resolutions critical
 of both the Tshombd and Gizenga regimes, seem unlikely to
 find significant support in either Elisabethville or Stanleyvill
 Ambassador Timberlake commented on 29 April that the "un-
 sophisticated" effort of the Congolese Army to keep the leaders
 in Coquilhatville until agreement is reached could hardly be suc-
 cessful and was likely merely to prolong the stalemate and widen
 the differences among the various Congolese factions. Tshombd
 is still under detention; yesterday Congolese government spokes-
 men said he would be detained indefinitely, would be removed to
 Leopoldville, and his release would depend upon "events." The
 disarming on 28.April by Congolese forces of a Ghanaian unit
 of UN troops at Port Franc ui appears to have been done on local
 initiative.                                    (Map)

 The Situation in the Congo
 The arrival at Port Francqui of a Congolese provincial
 official from Luluabourg to investigate the increasing tension
 between members of the Lulua and Baluba tribesmen appar-
 ently instigated the attack by the Congolese Army on the UN
 units.  The Congolese apparently believed the UN was either
 behind the inspection or would protect the official in his probe.
 At least three of a 60-man Ghanaian unit were killed and the
 remainder' captured by the numerically superior Congolese
 unit.   The incident is indicative of Congolese sensitivity to
 what they feel is UN interference in their affairs.

 Cn Leopoldville, relations between the UN and the Kasa-
 vubu government are expected to worsen after the return of
 UN representative Dayala  The government has indicated that
 when Dayal returns, it intends to issue a release labeling him
 an "uninvited foreigner" and strongly implying that it may call
 for popular demonstrations "to dissipate any doubt which might
 remain in Mr. Dayal's mind concerning the usefulness of his
 presence in Leopoldville, which can only obstruct the success
 of UN operations in the Congo,'

 The US consul in Elisabethville reported on 29 April that of-
 ficial and public reaction to the news of Tshombe's detention had
 been slight.  The Katangan Council of Ministers had been meeting
 three times daily, but the only important decision was the proc-
 lamation of a limited state of emergency--a move apparently aimed
 at preventing the movement of Balubas and other Africans hostile
 to the government and the mass exodus of Belgians. Munongo and

 Health Problems in Communist China
 Mao Tse-tung reportedly told an American journalist last
 autumn that the average Chinese peasant currently was lucky
 to receive 1,000 calories in food a day. According to a nutritional
 study made by the Chinese Communists last year, the average
 peasant needs 3,000 calories a day to do his work Refugees
 from the mainland have reported a rapid climb in tuberculosis,
 liver disease, and stillbirths as a result of substandard diets.
 The inadequate diet- -particularly the shortage of fats--is at
 least partially responsible also for the apathy now reliably re-
 ported widespread in Communist China.
 Most of these ailments are progressive. Even if the diet
 of the average Chinese were to be substantially improved in the
 immediate future, it would take many months before the damage
 could be overcome. Labor productivity will continue to be af-
 fected by the present extent of malnutrition. F

 Economic Uneasiness in Japan
 The average consumer price rise of 4 percent in the past
 year equals the total increase during the five-year period from
 1955 to 1960. Despite unprecedented economic prosperity in
 Japan and a steadily improving standard of living,' this increase
 has aroused some public discontent with the Ikeda government,
 which had publicly predicted that prices would rise only about
 one percent this year.
 The trade account deficit of $230,000,000 during the first
 quarter of 1961 reflects a very high rate of investment in new
 plant and equipment as part of the government's ten-year pro-
 gram. for doubling national income.  The price rise stems pri-
 marily from strong consumer demand and from wage increases.
 Profit margins are being cut in some industries as a result of
 wage increases. Ikeda has responded to criticism on this point
 by contending that for several years labor productivity has been
 rising more rapidly than wages.
 The prime minister points out also that Japan's foreign ex-
 change reserves, which have grown to $2 billion, are sufficient
 to withstand the small additional trade deficits expected in the
 next several months. He asserts that government action. to
 counter the price rise and trade imbalance is not needed. at this
 time.
 Difficulties of this kind are considered normal in an eco-
 nomic expansion program, especially in its early stages, and
 are not serious in themselves. However, a recent upsurge in
 wholesale prices is likely to. be followed by new increases on
 the consumer level which could carry with them important polit-
 ical effects. In July, Ikeda will complete his first year in office
 and is scheduled to reshuffle the cabinet and major party posts
 in a bid to consolidate his power. His intraparty rivals and the
 opposition Socialists almost certainly will exploit any economic
 discontent at that time in an effort to weaken his leadership or
 possibly even unseat him. F

 [The defeat of the People's Action party (PAP) reflects in
 part the disenchantment of Singapore's economically depressed
 workers impatient with PAP's failure during its two years in
 office to effect solutions to the island's economic problems. PAP
 won 43 of the 51 seats in the Legislative Assembly in May 1959
 as a radical socialist and anticolonialist party promising a "new
 order" for. the working masses. Its basically moderate and care-
 fully planned economic policies have not had spectacular results,
 however, and as much as 10 percent of the Singapore working
 force remains unemployed. In its preoccupation with creating
 an attractive climate for private investment in the economic de-
 velopment of the island, the government has attempted to hold
 the line on.wages and create stable labor conditions, and this
 has led to some popular disillusionment with PAP's image as a
 militant party of the left:
 [In addition, the party's generally cooperative relations with
 the British, who retain broad powers over Singapore's foreign
 relations, defense, and internal security, have exposed it to
 charges leveled by Ong during his campaign that the party has
 become a stooge of the British. One of the immediate effects
 of the election may be diminished rapport between the PAP and
 the British as the party seeks to refurbish its anticolonial repu-,
 tation~.)
 CPAP remains the best organized and most widely supported
 party in Singapore, however, and its defeat by Ong is primarily
 the result of a political miscalculation rather than an indication
 of a dramatic shift in the political climate. The PAP leadership
 forced a showdown with Ong in his home constituency, a congested
 area of low-income and semiliterate workers where Ong, who has
 a flair for demagoguery, was widely conceded to be almost un-
 beatable:)
 ,Since its formation in 1954, the PAP has been ideologically
 split between the moderates, who control the party's formal or-
 gans, and a pro-Communist group which controls the militant)

 Gabor organs and the student groups which form a key part of
 the party's mass base. The dimensions of Ong's victory--75
 percent of the vote--suggest that the extremists, despite a
 display of public support for. the PAP candidate, may have
 rested on their oars in order to embarrass the moderates. If
 the government resigns, which is a possibility but not consti-
 tutionally necessary, the extremists may well be in a position
 to demand increased influence in the party in return for their
 support in new elections

 B itain  West Indies
 Jamaica's Premier Manley has been engaging in political
 maneuvering designed to ensure that his specifications for a
 weak, decentralized federation will be adopted by the confer-
 ence. Until recently the trend had been running in.favor of
 compromises to retain Jamaican participation.  Trinidad's
 Premier Williams had backed down as leader of the forces
 advocating a strong federation. The principle that federal
 powers would be severely limited, at least. initially, had been
 accepted at the committee level, and the island ministers had
 further agreed that Jamaica's share of the legislative seats
 would be upped from 38 to 48 percent to correspond more
 closely to the island's 53-percent share of the federation's
 populationT
 The smaller islands, backed by Federal Prime Minister
 Adams from Barbados, are becoming resentful of the increas-
 ing tendency of Manley and. Williams together to dominate fed-
 eral affairs and have complained bitterly that the current pro-
 posals for the conference provide for a federation too weak to
 b e effective-)
 [Secessionist sentiment is growing in Jamaica.  This was
 originally based on economic grounds--Jamaica provides about
 53 percent of the federation's gross domestic product--and is
 now reinforced by artificially fostered racial animosities. If
 Manley,. who had been expected to replace the ineffectual Adams
 as prime minister, fails to obtain.the concessions he seeks, he
 may urge Jamaicans to vote against continued participation in
 the referendum he plans to hold on the question in September.
 Premier Williams has said he is unwilling to remain in the fed-
 eration without Jamaica and claims he turned down a suggestion
 by Prime Minister Macmillan to head the federation if Manley
 withdraws.
 C critical powers which Jamaica seeks to retain-income tax
 and industrial development incentives=are recognized in the
 current proposals3as subjects of ultimate federal control but are)

 Cleft to island control for the present. Various proposals for
 financing the federal budget through customs excises and con-
 sumption duties are to be debated. Trinidad's unwillingness
 to have its high per capita income downgraded.by a flood of
 immigrants has forced a proposal to restrict freedom of move-
 ment between constituent territories. With an eye to Commu-
 nist-led British Guiana, Jamaica also wants the power to veto
 accession of new members:
