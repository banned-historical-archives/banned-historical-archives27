 SINO-U, S, RELATIONS
 PRC SAYS U,S, VIOIATES "PRINCIPLES" OF SHANGHA,1: COMMUNIGIUE
 Peking's current charges of alleged U.S. "com,'lvance" with "Tibet
 traitors" in Tibet independence activities in th,e United States
 were made at a somewhat higher level o.f authority than other
 Peking complaints related to bilateral relatJ.ons since the
 Shanghai communique, signed during President. Nixon's rebru~:ry 1972
 visit to China.  Moreover, Peking's timing .;if the release of the
 13 October statement by the spoicesre.an for t'l~.~a Chinese roreign
 Ministry's Information Department--only sips days before Secretary
 Kis:~j.nger's scheduled arrival in China for talks with its leaders--
 seems to serve notice that Peking intends i:o maintain a firm
 stance on disputed bilateral issues.  They;?e is no media evidence
 suggesting any major change in Peking's gr.iYeral attitude toward
 the United States:  Concurrent Peking treritment of U.S.-related
 issues has maintained its normally discreet handling of the United
 States, and top Chinese leaders, including Teng Hsiao-ping, have
 met with  two ii.S.  groups  touring Ctiina.
 rollowing the 1972 Nixon visit, Peking had made no public anti-U.S.
 statements devoted to bilateral issues until this year.  Both
 previous cases in 1975 were less authoritative than the current
 statement nd were in response to publicly reported U.S. actions.
 In April Peking noted the U.S. cancellation of a PRC dance troupe
 tour, and in September it reported the. cancellation of a China
 tour by a U.,". mayors' delegation bec~iuse of PRC objections to
 r~ceiving the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico.*
 The 13 October NCNA report of the cu~:rent statement detailed a
 series of private Chinese complaints to the U.S; over Tibetan
 activities in this country.  It stated that on 30 July 1974 the
 FRC Liaison Office in Washington had privately complained to the
 State Department about the actions of a so-called "office of Tibet"
 in New York City which aliegediy circulated news bulletins
 spreading anti-PRC "slanders."  The Liaison Office is said to have
 restated its position to the State Department on 8 August 1975,
 and added that the United States should also act to stop the U.S.
 tour, beginning this October, of a Tibetan song and dance troupe.
 According to the statement, on 8 October the Chinese once again
 reiterated their position.  Peking alleged that the State
 Department repeatedly refused to take action, on the "pretext"
 that the Tibetan actions were in accord with the U.S. Constitution
 and laws, and it chaiged that b.y having "obstinately clung to its

 that L-lie U.S, stance represents "an undisguised interference in
 China's internal affairs" and a "flagrant violation of- the
 principles of the ~hangliai communique."
 COMPAk1SON WITH         The current statement is more aul-horiL-aLive
 PAST COMPLAINTS         than those issued following the previous two
 incidents  this  year.         Pelting reported  the
 dance troupe incident- in a 2 April 1975 NCNA "interview" with the
 Chinese People's Association for rriendship with P'or.eign Countries
 and the spokesman of L?he information department of the foreign
 ministry.        'Phe canceJ.lztion of  the mayors'  visit  was discussed  in
 a 16 Se; tember 1975  NCNA report-  of.  "observat:ions" made by the
 Chinese People's Institute oi' roreign Affairs.  The earlier.
 Chinese charges were also leas harsh.  They had complained that
 the U.5. actions were contrary to "the spirit" (thing sllen 4737 4377)
 of the Sh~~nghai communique, but the current statement for the first
 time said that the U.S. position was a "flagrant violation" of
 "the principles" (yuan tse 0626 0463) of the 1972 communique.
 Past authoritative Pelting charges of alleged foreign interference
 in 7.'ibet 1-~ave usually focused on Indian involvement,  but  the
 Chinese once before--since the signing of the Shanghai. communique--
 publicly complained of U. S. interference in this Chinese "internal
 affair."  NCNA reported  on  28 July 1972 remarks by PRC representa-
 tive Wang Jun-sheng at the 27 July session in Geneva of the UNPCOSOC,
 in which Wang took a passing swipe at U.S, actions in the United
 Nations over the Tibet question.  He charged that "in the past few
 years, at the instigation of the United States, the Chiang I:ai-shek
 clique aid India, the United Nations on several occasions discussed
 and adopted  illegal  resolutions on tl~e  so-cal].~d  'quest3.ons  of
 Tibet' thus leaving behind dishonorable records."

 U, S,-SOVIET RELATIONS
 SOVIET EDITOR DEFENDS DETENTE, SEES ADMINISTRATION CONFLICT
 V.M. Berezhkov, chief editor of the ;ournal U5A, has asserted in
 its most recent issue that statements by Defense Secretary
 Schlesinger regarding a possible U.S. first use of nuclear weapons
 against the Soviet- Union "probably reflect a struggle about detente
 underway in U.S. ruling circles."  Complaining--as tiave other USA
 Institute members recently--abo~.t such indications of increased
 opposition to improved U.S.-Soviet relations i.n Washington,
 Berezhkov underscored his own support for a Soviet policy of
 further cultivating the U.S. connection by stressing the critical
 importance of U.S.-Soviet- relations in resolving world problems
 in general.  Previous Soviet analyses of the alleged new "campaign"
 against detente in the United St~~.tes have avoided a direct implica-
 tion that there was disagreement within the Administration itself,
 and have in fact cited approvingly--as did Berezhkov once again--
 statements by Administration officials rebutting those who have
 argued that only the USSR stands to gain from detente.
 Berezhkov devoted the bulk of his article to an assessment of the
 prospects for U.S.-Soviet detente.  Like virtually every other
 Scviet assessment, his concluded that the prospects were bright
 in the long run despite current problems.  Berezhkov observed--
 echoing earlier attempts at clarification made by U.S. officials--
 that part of the resistance to detente had been encouraged by
 confusion over the meaning of the trench word itself.  He empha-
 sized that "detente" in Soviet policy meant first ar_d foremost a
 movement away from confrontation and international tension and had
 nothing in common with the broader concept of "entente."
 Repeating the arguments of earlier Soviet rejoinders to Schlesinger,
 Berezhkov said that in talking openly about the use of nuclear
 weapons against the USSR, the defense secretary was acting counter
 to the understand.~.ng reached between the two countries regarding
 the prevention of +iuciear war.  According to uerezhkov, "relapses"
 such as the first-use discussion "are particularly dangerous
 because the return of our countries to the conditions of confronta-
 tion would sharply worsen the whole international situ2tion."
 Berezhkov maintained that despite such difficulties U.S.-Soviet
 relations were 'lieveloping steadily," and tie looked forward to a
 new summit and SALT agreement to restore momentum to the process
 of normalization.

 Berezhkov made clear his own moderate views on defense and foreign
 policy issues by touring the benefits of p.lrity in U.S.-Soviet
 military relations and by challenginb the applicability to present-
 day conditions of Cl.ausewitz' familiar dictum on war. as a continua-
 tion of politics.  Positions on L?his tenet have come to serve as
 touchstones to distinguish military hardliners from pro-detente
 advocates in L-ite Soviet Union.  According to Berezhkov, "universal
 war. can no longer be regarded as a means of policy because of. the
 destructiveness of Lhe weapons which each of the sides possesses."
 This posiL-ion has also been taken by USA Institute members Arbatov
 and Bovin in the past in a pattern of advocacy which has clearly
 been intended to express a pro-detente view.
 Berezhkov also voiced agreement with Brezhnev's relaxed view of. the
 current military threat to the USSR by quoting his 13 Ju:ie 1975
 election speech assertion that "now the leaders of the bourgeois
 world cannot seriously expect to decide the historical argument
 between capitalism and socialism by force of aYms."  This has
 become another disputed formula. in the detente issue.  A contrasting
 point of view was presented by Defense Minister Grechko in a speech
 two weeks before Brezhnev's.  In a 29 May appearance before an all-
 Army conference, Grechko had said that !'he forces of reaction and
 aggression still "have not abandoned their plans to resolve the
 dispute between capitalism and socialism by force of arms."

 SIP!0-SOVIET  RELI',TIONS
 RED FLAG DEMONSTRATES INCREASED PRC INTRANSIGENCE TU USSR
 Against tl~e background of recently heightened polemics against the
 USSR, a lengthy artic]_e in RED 1LAC (No. 10) under the authoritative
 byline Liang Hsiao leas strongly implied that China cannot have
 normal State relations with the "social imperialists" until the
 entire Sov3.et political-economic system is changed.*  The article,
 carried by 1'elcing radio on 14 October, detailed Soviet "hegemonism"
 in its relations with other countries, highlighting the Chinese
 thesis that the USSR's system makes it the more dangerous and
 aggressive of the two superpowers.  The author asserted flatly
 that real change in Soviet aggressive policies will require a
 fundamental change in the Soviet economic and political system, not
 merely Moscow leadership or policy shifts.  Past Chinese comment had
 stated chat despite ideologl.cal differences, the PRC could have normal
 state relations with the USSR,a theme missing in recent Chinese
 pronouncements.
 Liang described Moscow as a "latecomer" to the world imperialists'
 "fesst" eager to make up for lost time and stated that the Soviet
 system of "si:ate monopoly capitalism" made it the more formidable
 enemy.  According to Liang, the Soviet system is "more monopolistic,
 more concentrated, and more tightly controlled" and therefore the
 Soviets are "more brutal in their aggression and expansion abroad."
 While acknowledging Soviet economic and technological inferiority to
 the United States, Liang stated that the L'SSR's ability to squeeze
 out surplus wealth to militarize the Soviet czonomy made it equally
 formidable militarily.
 The article concluded with a discussion of Soviet internal ani world
 forces opposed to Moscow's ambitions, noting especially that the
 Third World--"th.e main force combatting imperialism"--has come
 to see more clearly the "true colors of the Soviet social-imperialists"
 and is "increasingly directing  its  struggle against this deadly
 enemy."  It also cited evidence of "riew advances" by the developed
 Second World countries against Moscow`s policies, concluding that
 Soviet social imperialism, though outwardly fierce, is weak
 internally and a true "r~.per tiger."
 *  Peking media recently have stressed the alleged danger of roar
 stemming from the USSR, including the danger of a Soviet "surprise
 attack"against Chins.  See the TRENDS of 1 October 1975, pages
 7-10, and 8 October 1915, pages 1-2.

 TENG HSIi~U-RING REMARKS      According to Western press re~.orts, Vice
 Premier Teng Hsiao-ping took a li,.~e
 similar to the RI;D FLAG article during an 18 September conversation
 with Weat German conservative leader Strauss.  He reportedly
 dismissed rumors that China was ready to normalize relations with
 Moscow, noting that a precondition for improved relations would
 be a riascoca change in its "political orientation."  A Moscow radio
 broadcast in Mandarin beamed to Southeast Asia on 6 October took
 issue with Teng's alleged statement,. contrasting it with Pelcing's
 heretofore standard public position that ideological differences
 with Moscow should not preclude normalization of state relations..

 USSR !JNCOMMUNICATIVE ON SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASAD'S MOSCOW VISIT
 The scanty media treatment of President al-Asad's 9-10 October
 "friendly" visit to Moscow--with no advance announcement--was a
 far cry from the ruffles and flourishes ;~rith which he was welcomed
 on his "friendly official" visit in April 1974.*  Even though the
 recent visit was not official, it is unusual for Moscow reportage
 on the activities of a visiting head of state to be virtually
 nonexistent, comment scanty, and the communique uncommunicative
 to the extent of revealing merely that discussions were held on
 unspecified Mideast issues.  ~~Thile various theories could be
 advanced for the paucity of coverage, the most plausible explana-
 tion would seem to lie in a coolness resulting from differences
 over aspects of the Mideast problem and Syrian military aid
 requests.  Moscow in .the past, however, has papered over Soviet-
 Arab frictions with more finesse and appropriate protocol gestures
 than were displayed on this occasion.
 MIDEAST, MILITARY ISSUES        Differences appeared to emerge five
 days after al-Asad's visit, in a dis-
 tinctly cool announcement broadcast by Moscow's domestic service
 on the 15th which revealed for the first time that the Syrian
 foreign and defense ministers had remained in Moscow for talks
 after al-Asad went home.  Until this announcement Moscow had not
 acknowledged that the ministers stayed behind; the Damascus paper
 TISHRIN had reported, according to Beirut radio on the 12th, that
 they had stayed "to conclude the discussion of subjects raised"
 during ai-Asad's visit.
 Moscow radio said that Soviet foreign and defense ministers Gromyko
 and Grechko had met with their Syrian counterparts, Khaddam and
 Talas, and "exchanged views" on "questions concerning the further
 developmec~t of cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Syrian
 Arab Republic, as well as on the problems of the Middle East settle-
 ment."  The item, reporting that the Syrians had left for home that
 day, noted that the talks were conducted in a "friendly and business-
 like" atmosphere.  This is in contrast to the warmer characterization
 *  The April 1974 visit--which featured live radio TV coverage of air-
 port ceremonies, an al-Arad speec~l.over Moscow television, and a signed
 joint statement--is discussed in the TRENDS of 17 April 1974, pages
 ?       8-ll.  Al-Asad had preciously visited Moscow in February 1971 and
 July 1972, and stopped for a talk with Brezhnev en route to the DPRK
 in September 1974.  He paid at least one "private" visit to Moscow, in
 October 1972, which was announced by Damascus--but not b~~? his hosts--
 after his return.

 an Lhe communique on a1.-Asad's visit-, which described the atmosphere
 ~f his talks as one of "friendship, cordiality, and complete mutual
 understanding,"    LDesl~ite the ceremonial ~luurishes, as-Asad's
 April 1974 visit produced only a "thorough and constructive excharbe
 of opinions" 1.n an atmosphere of "frankness and mutual understanding,")
 -1-  Mideast Tssues:  Underlining the narrow focus of the talks, L?he
 communiq,t~c stated simply that the two sides "discussed L-he situation
 in the Middle Last and its effects on the international situation as
 a whole."  It added a watered-down version of Moscow's usual call
 fox~'Lsraeli withdrawal from all occupied territories and for support
 of Palestinian rights, ia.cluding their right to their own state:
 The sides "stressed their determination to do ev~.rything in their
 power to have the legitimate rights of the Arab states and the Arab
 people, including the Arab people of Palestine, restored and insured."
 'Chere was uo mention of the Genova conference, which Gromyko recently
 advocated in h.is UN Ger_eral Assembly speech last month.  Damascus
 had gone along with Moscow in calling for renewal of'the Geneva
 talks in the last three high-level Soviet-Syrian discussions--
 Gromyko's visits in rebruary and April 1975 and a1-Asad's September
 1974 stopover in Moscow.
 Two presumably prime topics of discussion, the Sinai II accord and
 the Lebanese situation, were touched on i.n comment pegged to the
 visit.  In PRAVDA's weekly international review on the 12th,
 Korionov indirectly placed the Syrian visit against the background
 of Sinai II, which al-Asad has called on as-Sadat to abrogate and
 which Moscow derogates in~muted fashion.      Tntroduc~'ng innocuous
 comment on the Soviet-Syrian talks drawn from the language of the
 communique, Korionov observed that the Soviet Union supports "a
 real and not illusory settlement" of the Mideast problem--Moscow's
 cryptic way o# referring to an overall solution versus the U.S,-
 sponsored "partial steps."  A Moscow commentary in Ar~~bic on the
 11th nailing the "deep mutual trust" in Soviet-Syrian relations
 went on to discuss Lebar_on, charging that "provocative acts" against
 that country were designed to divert attention from "partial solu-
 tions" in ti>,~ Mideast.
 ~-  Military Cssues:  While the presence of the defense ministers at
 the talks during al-Asad's visit and the later talks reported by
 Moscow radio on the ISth pointed to a discussion of military topics,
 Moscow made no mention of military aid in material surrounding the
 visit.  Moscow's Arabic-language commentary on the 11th did refer
 co Arab concern over U.S. "secret commitments" to Israel stipulating
 that the United States would continue to arts Israel.  But in another
 instance, :Moscow seemed to make a studied effort to avoid the
 subject of military aid.  Thus TASS on the 13th, reviewing Syrian

 media coverage of al-Asad's visit, ignored allusions to U.S. mili-
 tary aid to Israel in the Damascus paper TISHRIN.  According to
 the SYRIAN ARAB NEWS AGENCY on the 12th, TISHRIN had implied that
 the Moscow talks concerned increased Soviet military aid to Syria
 to correct "the imbalance in power in favor of the Zionist enemy,"
 and,  ix~ implicit criticism of  Egypt,  stress~:d that  Syria was seek-?
 ing to create a unitr;d Arab policy and "an Arab deterrent force"
 which would be able "to distinguish between friends and enemies."
 While the brevity of the communique might explain the absence of
 any re~erenc~ to Soviet assistance in Syr1a's defense, this con-
 trasts with the last four communiques and reports on high-level
 Syrian talks since pril 1974.  In September 1974, for example,
 the USSR pledged "readiness" to "ccntribute further to strengthen-
 ing the economic and defense capacity" of Syria.  And communiques
 in February and ~'lprii this year, on Gromyko's visit to Syria and
 his counterpart's visit to Moscow, referred to "the importance of
 strengthening the defense potential" of Syria under conditions of
 "continued Israeli aggression."
 TREATMENT       Reportage on al-Asad's visit was confined to the
 OF VISIT        announcement of his arrival and the communique
 released on the 11th, both of which werz featured
 in the central press.  Normally Moscow would also, at a minimum,
 report the holding of talks, the ritual luncheon or dinner, perhaps
 a reciprocal function by the guest, and departure ceremonies,
 However, these routine events were merely acknowledged in the
 communique.*  Thus the document listed, as is customary, those
 participating in the talks; it mentioned a luncheon at which
 Brezhnev and al-Asad exchanged "friendly toasts"; and it reported
 those present for al-Asad's departure.
 The communique gave no indication of any discussion of bilateral
 relations other than to refer to she leaders' "determination to
 continue to strengthen friendship between the two states."  The
 document additionally stressed that "no one will be allowed to
 s;iake this friendship, to damage it"??~-a common sentiment in Moscow's
 comment on Soviet-Arab relations in general and an echo of Gromyko's
 September UNGA address in which he referred to the "deep roots" of
 Soviet-Arab .friendship and added that "we do not think anyone will
 succeed in undermining it."
 *  The communique was so identified by TASS English and in foreign-
 language broadcasts; PRA.VDA, however, called it a "report" on the
 visit.

 Meager followup comment has been generally confined to the language
 of the communique.  A TASS dispatch from Damascus on the 13th,
 summing up Syrian media comment, provided generalities along the
 line that the vis?lt was "successful" and important for strengthening
 Soviet-Syrian relations anti establishing a dust and durable peace.
 Comment in Arabic from the unofficial Radio Peace and Progress and
 from Moscow radio on the 10th and llth stressed the "good tradition"
 in Soviet-Syrian relations of holding "regular consultations and
 personal contacts" and regularly exchanging visits.  Such "regular"
 exchanges have been one-side3:  Other th+~n a series of Gromyko
 visits in the first part of 1974 and 1975 related to Secretary

 after the June 1967 war.

 The U.S. p]Fn to allow Vietnamese refugees who want to return
 home to du so aboard a ship leaving from Guam continues to draw
 low-level Vietnamese communist protests.  The latest comment still
 avoids making any flat statements that the rc:fugeea would be
 turned away, while stressing that the U.S. plan would impinge on
 ? Vietnamese sovereignty.       North Vi.etna~n's  first official  reaction
 canr:? in a 1S October DRV Farw:Lgn Ministry spokesman's Htatement
 which supported the condemtaation of the U.S. repatriation effort
 contained in the PRG For~aign Minir~lry spokesman's statement of the
 4th.*  Cttendant media comment- has placed the burden of blame fox
 tlxe "sinister scheme" on tlx: "ixotheads in Washington" and,  in one
 instance, seemed *_o absolve the prosper_tive repatriates themselves
 of any wrongdoing
 Taking the same tack as the P,1G, tixe DRV Foreign Minist,.; spokesman's
 statement warned the United States it could not "dodge its
 responsibility" by declaring that repatriation was a "matter
 concerning the evacuees themselves" or by stating that it "has
 nothing to do with it."  The DRV spokesman's statement, said tlxat
 this "irresponsible and adventurous act" of the U.S. Government
 "violates tlxe sovereignty of Vietnam and misle2,ds public opinion."
 The earlier PRG Foreign Ministry spokesman's st~.tetient had appealed
 directly to the refugees, warning them to be aware of an "enemy
 plot" and assuring them that repatriation would be considered on
 an individual basis in conformity with the sovereign rights of
 Vietnam.  The DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's did not repeat such
 an appeal to the refugees but instead addressed ''demands" to the
 United States that it respect Vietnamese sovereignty and.
 "immediately stop this act."

 KAYSON SPEECH HIGHLIGfiTS LAO 30TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS
 Laos observed the 12 October 30th anniversary of the proclamation
 of independence from French colonial rule with commemorative
 ceremoni.ea at both L?l~e PuL?het Lao headquarters in Viengsay and
 at the capi~al of Vientiane.  Lao Patriotic Front (LT?F) Chairman
 Souphanouvong delivered a brief opening speech at the traditional
 anniversary rally in Viengsay; however, the mayor address--billed
 by the media as an "important speech"--was delivered by LPF Vice
 Chairman Kayson Phomvihan.  Although Kayson was not identified by
 the media in his position as secretary general of the Lao communist
 party--the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP)--his assumption
 of the keynote role, which has been exercised by Souplia.nouvong in
 the past, served to reinforce the party's shift since July toward
 open acknowledgment of its control of tl~e Lao Front.*
 The theme of Indochinese solidarity was underlined with the
 unprecedented turnout for the Viengsay celebrations of high-level
 delegations from North and South Vietnam and Cambodia.  The
 Norte, Vietnamese party-government delegation was led by Vietnam
 Workers Party (VWPj Politburo member and National Assembly
 Standing Committee Chairman Truong Chinh, the DRV's highest
 ranking party official following Firs L- Secretary Le Duan, who is
 on a *_our of Eastern Europe.  The delegation from South Vietnam,
 billed as re~,resE~iting the PRG, NFLS7, and the South Vietnam
 Committee of the VWP, was led by PRG Presi3ent i-Iuynli Tan Phat and
 included Defense Minister Tran Nam Trung, a member of the VWP
 Central. Committee.  The Cambodian Front and government were
 represented by a delegation headed by Ieng teary, deputy prime
 minister responsible for foreign affairs.  As in past years, the
 media also noted the presence of lower level foreigners, including
 "specialists" from China and the Soviet Union.
 KAvS;1N ADDRESS       While not identifying Kayson Phomvihan as a
 party official, the PATHET LAO NEWS AGENCY
 noted that he delivered his anniversary speech on behalf of the
 central committees of both the LPRP and the LPF.  He is last
 known to have made a public statement on the anniversary in 1970,
 when Pathet Lao media carried a lengthy article by him which was

 the official party paper. SIANC i?ASASUN, which began nationwide
 diatr.ibuL-ion In Laos in mid-August, puoliahed in serial dorm n

 The bugle o'f ICayson's  speech consi:rted of  a lr:l.storica.l  review
 }.racing the Lao revoliiLion over. the pas L- 30 years; it also touched
 upon Lao relations with oilier countries.  In voicing thanks for
 past international support-, ICayson singled out North Vietnam for
 particular attention, expressing "everlasting f;ratitude to the
 DRV--o>>r brother and intimate comrade who has stood side by side
 and shared wen]. and woe with us since ancient tames" for its
 "great and invaluable assistance."  Kayson professed "deep
 gratitude" to the PRC, L-lre Soviet Union, and other fraternal
 socialist countries for "selflessly and effectively rendering
 material and moral support and assistance."  He stressed tha
 importance of the policy of "fraternal, comradely combat
 coordination." between t-he three Indochinese countries and the
 LIP.P's "correct international line of independence and self-mastery"
 and "spirit of relying on themselves."
 Kayson reiterated the standard Pathet Lao position on the United
 States, noting that Laos had decided to "maintain" diplomatic
 relations with the United States on the basis that Washington
 "sincerely respect the sovereignty and independence of Laos, must
 not interfere in the internal affairs of Laos, must cease its
 support of the ultrarightist reactionaries, and must keep its
 promise to help heal tl~e wounds of war in Laos."
 Kayson also noted that Laos had agreed to "maintain fraternal and
 neighboring relations" with Thailand, but he warned Thailand
 in standard terms that the Tt-ai "powerholders" would be held
 responsible for "all serious consequences" if they did not cease
 supporting exiled Lao "traitors" and instigating provocations
 along the Lao-Thai border.  Kayson repeated the Pathet Lao's
 stock demands that Thailand return Lao property removed by fleeing
 rightists and "drive out and repatriate" the "reactionary
 chieftains" still hiding in Thailand.

 ICosygin's well-established prerogatives by addressing file Council

 authority in his o-m right: witl~- the publication of a collection
 of hie speechee on the economy, matching Kosygin'o published
 collection of speeches, mast of which concentrate on economic
 matters.  The moat recent indications of this trend have been
 ,several Central Committee decrees seemingly reflecting the
 assumption by the Central Committee of a role normally exercised
 by the Council of Min?1sLera.
 The decrees in question were rollowups to a 2 March 1973 point
 Central Committee-Council. of Ministers decree which had ordered
 ministries to switch to a production association structure and
 submit schemes for such reorgunizztion to the Council of ministers
 for, approval.  According t~ Brezhnev's assistant,, K.U. Chernenko,
 hes~d of the Central Committee's General Section, in the August
 QUESTIONS Or CPSU HISTORY, the Central Committee in May 1975 had
 issued decrees approving schemes prepared by three ministries.
 This is the firF". report o` Ce~~tral Committee decrees on this
 subject; previously, ministerial schemes were always reporte2.ly
 approved by the Council of Ministers.  IZVESTIYA on 6 September
 1975 reported that the Council of Ministers had recently approved
 the schemes for the three ministries, presumably ::ollowing the
 Central Committee action.  This procedure appears to reflect an
 unusual intervention by the party leadership into the normal
 government chain of command; it vio?.ated not only the normal
 division of party acid government functions but also the procedure
 specifically called for in the original, 2 March X973 decree.
 ECONOMIC ARTICLcS SUGGEST TT!'f TOWARD HEAVY If~USTRY
 The subject of economic priorities, rarely discussed in Soviet:
 media this year despite current preparation o? the 1976-1980
 five-year plan, has been raised by recent articles in KOMrUNIST
 and PLANNED ECONOMY.  Both Guggest that the tilt toward heavy
 ~!~dustry adopted at the December 1974 CPSU plen~im continues to
 characterize official policy and current planning.. The September
 KOMMUNIST article strongly argued for further increasing the
 priority for machinE~. buildi.g, and the August PLANNED ECONOMY
 article provided data showing that the growth rate of consumer
 goods production is declining even more sharply than before.  The
 endorsement for machine building recalls Kirilenko's insistence
 earlier this year that there was a shortage of machinery and that
 the Central Committee had authorized increased investment in the
 machine building  Zdustry.*

 The September 1COMMUNIST ar.t?icle on the future of the machine
 building industry was authored by Academician A.I. Taelikov,
 longtime director of? an Institute for design of metallurgical
 machinery.  TsRiilrov wrote that despite machine building's
 "somewhat preferential growth rate compared with many other
 branches," its growth "still cannot fullq satisfy us" and should
 be accelerated.  He argued that Soviet machine buil.ding'e share
 of industrial production is still lower than that in some
 economically developed capitalist countries, that shortage of
 capacity still prevents the machine bu~.ldiag industry from f1111ng
 all orders for equipment, that much Soviet machinery is obsolescent
 and must Le replaced, and, worst of all, that technological progress
 is being slowed because the "extremely overloaded" machine building
 industry cannot rapidly start mass producing newly developed types
 of machinery.  rurther, he argued that machines are "the moat
 profitable items to export," but unfortunately these exports
 cannot be expanded "because of lack of sufficient capacity in
 machine building."
 Taelikov carried his advocacy of heavy industrial priority to the
 point of questioning the policy of encouraging heavy industrial
 enterprises to produce consumer goods--a policy strongly advocated
 by Brezhnev himself in 1970-71.  Taelikov complained that ouch
 production was  scattered among a huge number of enterprises,"
 resulting in inefficient, unmcchanized small-scale production.
 He asked:  "Should one be surprised by the fact that at many
 enterprises consumer goods are manufactured with wide use of
 manual labor without even a production line?"
 The subiect of priorities was also raised by an article in the
 August issue of Gosplan's ~ourn.al PLANNED ECONOMY, which provided
 data on the current growth zates in heavy industry and consumer
 goods production.  The article, by G.M. Sorc~kin, director of the
 Institute of Economics of the World Socialist System, showed that
 the consumer goods' share of industrial production is actually
 less now than it was before the consumer prheavy induatry)ewould
 1971.  His figures indicated that ?roup A
 fall only slightly short of its five-year plan goals (45.5 percent
 actual increase versus 46.3 percent planned increase), but hat
 group B (consumer goods) would fail by a wide margin:  37 percent
 actual growth versus 48.6 percent planned growth.  Sorokin's
 figures indicated that group A fulfilleB fulfilledeitsrplannedery
 year except 1972 and 1975, while group
 growth only in 1971.  The data show that the shortfall in group B
 was even greater this year than in 1972 and 1973, when the
 agricultural disaster was blamed for the shortfall.
 Although acknowledging the failure to fulfill the promise of
 preferential growth for group B, Sorokin did not call for more
