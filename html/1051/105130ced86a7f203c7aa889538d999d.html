 China: The Impact of Reform on the Economy
 in 1983 and Prospects for the Future
 Introduction
 China's economic performance in 1983 and early 1984 reflects the
 successes and failures of experiments with reform that have been underway
 since late 1978.  Grain and cotton output reached new highs as agricultural
 reforms gave peasants a freer hand in farming.  Growth in the industrial
 sector was strong, but Beijing had major problems improving efficiency.  At
 the Party Plenum last month the reform wing of the party under Deng Xiaoping
 approved a comprehensive document on reform that builds on the success of
 agricultural reforms to push for more sweeping changes.  If Beijing can
 successfully overcome the difficulties it will encounter in implementing its
 urban reforms, we believe significant economic gains are possible in the long
 run.  Such successes would bode well for China's open door policy and could
 promote a broadening and deepening of China's ties with the United States.
 Economic Results in 1983--Mixed Picture
 Agricultural Production Up Sharply
 Agricultural reforms were the centerpiece of China's effort to
 restructure its economy, and recent gains have given the regime the peg it
 needed to justify even more radical departures from orthodox Marxist economic
 practices.
 -- In 1983, the total value of agricultural output jumped 9 percent, more
 than double the 4-percent goal set in the annual plan.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 -- Grain production--the key indicator--hit a record 387 million tons,
 more than 9 percent above the bumper 1982 crop.
 -- Grain imports fell to less than 13 million tons from 15 million tons in
 -- Cotton production showed an even sharper increase of 25 percent as
 China shed its role as one of the largest cotton importers and began
 small-scale raw cotton exports.  Shipments of US cotton to China were
 indicative of this trend, falling steadily from a peak level of $700
 million in 1980 to only $2 million last year.
 China credits its experiment with market-oriented rural reforms for
 recent agricultural gains, although we believe better-than-average weather and
 price increases also played an important role.  The contract responsibility
 system, which gives peasants effective control over acreage for periods of 15
 years or more, sparked rural enthusiasm.  Since the adoption of the
 responsibility system in late 1978, the Chinese have increased their annual
 grain production by 83 million tons--more than the entire annual grain
 production of Australia  and Canada combined.   A government decision to hike
 procurement prices for agricultural products also improved rural living
 standards.  With procurement prices now 40 percent higher than in 1978,
 peasants have been willing to increase their use of fertilizer and other
 inputs, further boosting agricultural yields.
 Beijing is also touting the reforms for their impact on rural
 employment.  In pursuit of profits, an increasing number of unemployed and

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 underemployed peasants have begun to engage in either commercial activities in
 the service sectors--opening restaurants, repairing shoes, making clothing,
 cutting hair, etc.--or production of handicraft items.  Beijing hopes by the
 end of the century to have about 40 percent of its rural labor force employed
 in non-agricultural production.
 The sharp gains have left the peasantry much better off than it was prior
 to 1978.  Rural residents have seen their annual income more than double over
 the period to about 300 yuan per capita (roughly $150).  Moreover, the gap
 between rural and urban living standards has narrowed significantly.
 Consumption by city residents rose at an annual rate of 7.2 percent between
 1979 and 1983, while rural consumption shot up at a 14.7 percent annual
 clip.  Consumer goods such as televisions, bicycles, watches, and fans are
 also beginning to work their way into the rural areas.
 Energy and Transportation--Mixed Results
 The energy sector provided Chinese policymakers with what was perhaps the
 most pleasant surprise of 1983.
 -- Primary energy output rose 6.7 percent, the fastest pace in five
 -- When energy saving measures are included, the gain comes to more than 9
 percent.
 -- Much of the production increase can be attributed to improved recovery
 processes which helped boost oil output by nearly 4 percent to 106
 million tons.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 -- A new incentive system which allowed producers to market above-quota
 production at higher prices also had a major impact on coal--China's
 largest energy source--and probably boosted oil output as well.  A
 newly instituted tax on energy consumption probably contributed to
 energy conservation efforts.
 The transportation sector also achieved good results when measured
 against the low level of resources that Beijing devoted to it over the past
 few years.  The 7.6 percent increase in goods transported last year came
 mainly from improved management of existing facilities.  Burgeoning budget
 deficits starting in 1979 forced Beijing to scale-back its budgetary outlays
 and investment in transportation was especially hard-hit.  The share of total
 investment in capital construction going to transportation and
 telecommunications dropped from an already low average of 18 percent in the
 1971-75 period, to 13 percent in 1976-1980 and to 9 percent in 1981.  Last
 year Beijing raised the proportion back up to 13 percent, but clearly the rate
 of investment is far short of China's needs.
 Foreign Trade--A Growing Surplus
 The foreign trade sector has experienced significant growth under China's
 open door policy.  Exports in 1983 rose 2 percent to a record $24 billion and
 imports showed a 10 percent increase to $18.4 billion.  The $5.6 billion trade
 surplus, China's third consecutive large surplus, has drawn increasing
 criticism from Western trading partners.
 Total foreign currency holdings, (including gold and SDRs), at yearend
 1983 amounted to an unprecedented US$20 billion, tenth largest in the world

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 and seventh largest if only foreign exchange is considered.  We estimate the
 debt service ratio at the end of last year was only about 6 percent, one of
 the world's lowest.  Despite an obvious and growing need for Western
 technology, Beijing has been unusually cautious about accumulating debt or
 spending its reserves.  This reluctance to make major outlays for Western
 equipment probably stems from several factors, including Beijing's uncertainty
 about which projects warrant top priority, domestic financial problems, and
 bureaucratic constraints on the use of foreign exchange.
 Military Sector--Aiding Economic Progress
 With all the emphasis on economic reform the military has been asked to
 accept, for the time being, a smaller share of the economic pie.  Chinese
 statistics show the proportion of total budget spending that goes to national
 defense falling from 17.5 percent in 1979--during China's border clash with
 Vietnam--to 15.3 percent in 1982.  Last year the figure may have fallen below
 15 percent.  While Chinese budget figures undoubtedly understate total
 military spending (perhaps by as much as one-half), nevertheless, we believe
 the percentages give an accurate indication of the trend toward sacrifice the
 military has so far accepted.
 Perhaps in part to attract military support for the cutbacks, Beijing has
 encouraged military industries to become more involved in civilian production
 and apparently has allowed them to acquire technology and to retain profits in
 the process.  In 1983, civilian products (bicycles, transportation vechicles',
 clothing, etc.) accounted for 22 percent of the defense industry's total
 output, compared to only 6 percent in 1975.  If this rate of increase is
 maintained, by 1990 about one-third of military production will go directly to
 civilian consumption.

 Industrial Performance--A Different Story
 China's industrial performance, when measured in terms of total output,
 also appeared more than satisfactory.
 -- The total value of industrial output rose a sharp 10 percent last year,
 well ahead of the planned 4 percent growth rate.
 -- Half of total output originated in the light industrial sector--where
 China feels its major potential lies--as opposed to only 42 percent in
 1978.
 Despite the apparent gains, Beijing has grown increasingly dissatisified
 with the industrial sector's failure to come to grips with major problems of
 .inefficiency and waste.  Although small gains have been made in energy
 conservation, 20 percent of China's industrial capacity is idled by
 electricity shortages while Chinese enterprises continue to use three-and-a-
 half times more energy to produce a unit of output than their counterparts in
 the average LDC.  Moreover, much of the output produced at this high cost is
 shoddy and outdated.  For example, only 10 percent of the machinery and
 equipment currently produced is up to modern standards;  the rest, the Chinese
 claim, is 1950s and 1960s vintage.
 The economic reform program was supposed to be an all out attack on these
 problems, and Beijing openly declared its willingness to sacrifice growth
 while reforms worked their magic.  The Sixth Five Year Plan (1981-1985) called
 for average annual increases in industrial output of only 2.7 percent, but
 demanded accompanying decreases in per unit output costs of 1 to 2 percent.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 Actual results so far, however, have shown industrial output growing at an 8
 percent annual clip and costs inching upward at the same time.  The industrial
 reforms have clearly failed to accomplish their most important tasks.
 Mounting Problems Associated With Reform
 The failure of the so early piecemeal efforts to improve industrial
 efficiency provided ammunition to conservative elements within the Chinese
 leadership who were arguing for a return to tighter central control.  Their
 cause was supported further by a host of new problems that emerged or were
 made worse by reform policies.
 The devolution of decisionmaking authority, for example, threatened to
 untrack China's high priority infrastructure investment program.  Enterprise
 managers, using their authority to make decisions on capital investment,
 ignored government pleas to hold the line on industrial investment; between
 1979 and 1982 extrabudgetary investment in capital construction more than
 doubled.  The increase not only drained funds needed for infrastructure
 investment, it also left China short of cement, glass, and other construction
 supplies needed to support the program.  Many of the projects, when
 operational, also began attracting raw materials needed by larger, more
 efficient state-run enterprises.
 Most serious, in the view of some Chinese leaders, the failure of the
 initial industrial reforms also threatened to limit China's long term growth
 potential.  Beijing was counting on productivity gains from industrial reform
 to offset the impact that the falling investment rates would otherwise have on
 long term growth.  But this has not happened.  Since 1979, nominal investment
 in productive assets has risen at only a 4.5 percent annual pace compared to
 the 6.3 percent real growth of GNP.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 Efforts to decentralize decisionmaking authority created financial
 problems that also threatened to derail the reform program.  The fiscally
 conservative government has had to reconcile itself to 5 consecutive budget
 deficits totalling about 55 billion yuan.  Treasury bonds were used to help
 finance the red ink without resorting totally to the inflationary printing of
 money, but the government has grown increasingly concerned about its inability
 to balance revenues and expenditures.
 On the revenue side, budget shortfalls stemmed in part from the decision
 to cut back on growth in heavy industry--the major revenue generator.  When
 heavy industrial output levelled off in 1980 and then declined in 1981,
 revenues suffered.  And when the government tried to spark productivity by
 introducing a tax system that would allow enterprises to retain more of their
 profits, many enterprises began understating profits and overstating costs to
 avoid tax payment.  The China Audit Administration, set up in September 1983
 to monitor the situation, found errors and violations amounting to more than
 600 million yuan in its first year of operation.
 Even successful agricultural reforms compounded financial problems on the
 expenditure side.  Procurement prices for agricultural products were increased
 sharply beginning in 1979 to boost rural incomes, while consumer prices for
 those products went relatively unchanged.  The result was a huge gap requiring
 more than 140 billion yuan in price subsidies between 1979 and 1983.  Price
 subsidies alone took nearly one-fourth of total state revenue by 1983 and more
 than offset the defense and investment cutbacks that were part of the
 government's budget balancing efforts between 1980 and 1982.

 Factors Behind China's Mistakes
 Given the magnitude of the changes Beijing introduced, the emergence of
 serious problems was not surprising.  But on several counts, the government's
 piecemeal approach exacerbated existing difficulties.  For example, rather
 than introducing a comprehensive, well-considered program, the industrial
 management reforms began as an experiment and then spread almost of their own
 volition.  In 1979 about 4,000 enterprises throughout the country were allowed
 to experiment with decentralized decisionmaking authority.  Less than a year
 later, 16 percent of all enterprises under the state budget--producing 60
 percent of the total value of output and earning 70 percent of the profits--
 had been given expanded decisionmaking authority.  In our view, neither party
 officials nor central authorities were prepared to surrender authority on such
 a large-scale on such short notice.  Misunderstanding and bureaucratic
 infighting became major problems.
 Lacking a comprehensive plan, Beijing was forced early on to make major
 alterations in the reform program.   The frequent changes led factory managers
 to question to government's commitment to reform, and hence slowed the
 implementation process.  For example, the government repeatedly altered its
 tax policy and demonstrated a great deal of uncertainty over how much autonomy
 local-level enterprises should have in distributing bonuses and in making
 investment decisions.  For factory managers who survived China's Cultural
 Revolution by resisting any policy changes that deviated from orthodox
 Marxism, the government's vacillation was a signal to go slow in implementing
 change.
 Beijing's most serious problem in promoting a transition to a more
 market-oriented economy was its failure to come to grips with its irrational
 price structure.  Aside from the financial problems this generated, the price

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 structure--large parts of which date from the 1950s--conveyed no meaningful
 information on which economic decisions could be made.  Since prices bore
 little relationship to production costs, enterprise losses were not
 necessarily attributable to either inefficiency or lack of demand.  Beijing's
 insistence, therefore, that enterprises make profits had little realistic
 effect, as the government had no criteria for determining which enterprises
 should be forced into bankruptcy.  By yearend 1983, one-fourth of all state
 enterprises were operating in the red.
 Outdated fixed prices, moreover, meant that firms had no means of
 assessing their most profitable economic endeavors.   Enterprises producing
 high priced goods requiring cheap inputs, for instance, made large profits
 regardless of efficiency or product quality.  Even when there was no consumer
 demand for a firm's output, its profits were assured by the state's practice
 of procuring the commodity at the arbitrarily established price.1  At the same
 time, the production of many popular consumer goods began declining or even
 stopped because such items yield little or no profit.
 Nor could China's banking system help in the transition.  During the
 Cultural Revolution the People's Bank of China had operated primarily as a
 cashier/accountant for the Ministry of Finance.  The major function of the
 bank was to transfer funds at the ministry's bidding.  Loans were made to meet
 plans regardless of the borrower's financial status or the efficiency of the
 project.  Interest charges were held low, when assessed at all, and repayment
 '1A study of 32 enterprises in Liaoning province revealed
 that 47 percent of all goods produced in 1983 were unmarketable
 or already overstocked.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 was seldom enforced.  The upshot of this policy was intense pressure from
 enterprises to secure funds for investment, without regard to the possible
 return.
 Finally, the environment in which the seeds of urban reform were sown was
 much more hostile to change than that of the agricultural sector.  Rural
 reforms gave agricultural decisionmaking authority back to the farmer, but
 urban reforms handed. authority to factory managers who were ill-equipped for
 their jobs.  Most acquired their positions during the Cultural Revolution as a
 result of their political orthodoxy, not their managerial talents.  They
 lacked both the education and the expertise necessary to function in a
 competitive environment.  Hence, it was not surprising that, for example, when
 Beijing gave managers the power to reward outstanding work with bonuses,
 payments were usually made on an egalitarian basis, across the board.
 Pushing Ahead With Reform--The 1984 Policy Shift
 From 1980 to early 1984, China's economic policies had something of a
 seesaw character, as economists and economic administrators debated the merits
 of tight planning versus market regulation, and of reform versus readjustment
 of the economic structure.  At the top of the political structure, it appeared
 that Politburo elders Chen Yun and Li Xiannian favored a gradual approach to
 change, relying on more efficient operation of an improved planning
 apparatus.  Opposed to them were Premier Zhao Ziyang and several of China's
 leading economists, who argued that earlier reform measures had not gone far
 enough and that there was a need greater reliance on the market, and hence
 more institutional change.
 Earlier this year, the momentum shifted decisively in favor of the
 reformers, who, with Deng Xiaoping's support, apparently were given the

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 wherewithal to implement their programs.  In January, Beijing issued Central
 Document No. 1, a comprehensive summary of rural reform measures and a clear
 call to expand the reforms, giving more opportunities to farmers to engage in
 commerce and "commodity production."  In April, the State Council issued new
 regulations permitting factories and commercial enterprises to experiment with
 new wage programs.  Less than a month later, the "Provisional Regulations on
 Greater Freedom for State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" were published, giving
 enterprises the right to:
 -- Produce whatever goods are in short supply after fulfilling State plans
 for their normal output.
 -- Set retail prices for industrial machinery and other means of
 production within a range of 20 percent around the state price.
 -- Decide what share of their income will go to production, expansion,
 reserves, or bonuses.
 -- Lease or rent equipment as long as proceeds go to upgrade existing
 -- Recruit technical specialists directly and develop pay standards.
 .Although many of these measures were little more than restatements of policies
 Beijing had experimented with during the previous three years, they signalled
 a renewed commitment to industrial reform.

 Zhao's address to the May session of the National Peole's Congress (NPC)
 gave official confirmation to the policy shift.  After a brief note of praise
 for agricultural reforms, Zhao devoted nearly two-thirds of his speech to the
 "urgent" need for "quickening" reform in the cities.  Specifically, Zhao
 called for:
 -- Implementation of the second stage of China's tax reform program to
 give enterprises even greater financial autonomy.
 -- Experimental restructuring of the managerial system in the construction
 industry, replacing financial appropriations with bank loans, using
 public bidding procedures to issue contracts, and revamping the
 material distribution system to alleviate shortages.
 -- Better utilization of educated technicians in the planning and
 management process in enterprises.
 -- Reform of the commodity circulation system to facilitate the flow of
 goods between town and country, and the exchange of goods between
 different regions.
 By late June, various Chinese media were publishing articles calling for
 experiments with such market-oriented practices as forcing state banks to
 compete against each other for deposit and loan business, and allowing
 domestic enterprises to issue stocks, bonds, and other securities.  Perhaps
 the most notable shift, however, was the emergence of a host of articles
 advocating an early resolution of the price question.  Prior to this time--
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87M0l 152R000400520014-1
 despite the view widely held by Western and Chinese economists alike that the
 entire experiment with market tools could not succeed within the framework of
 China's irrational prices--only the most daring advocates of economic reform
 suggested moving quickly to tackle the potentially explosive issue of price
 reform.
 The October Party Plenum
 The most irrefutable evidence of the reformers' strength came during the
 Third Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party's 12th Central Committee,
 which convened for a single day on 20 October to endorse a sweeping "Decision
 on Reform of the Economic Structure."  The plenum was preceded by six days of
 "preparatory meetings," at which the document was presumably explained in
 detail to various constituencies, though it probably underwent litle change.
 The Central Committee's "Decision" committed the party to a comprehensive
 reform program that if, implemented as planned over the next five years, will
 change the face of Chinese socialism.
 Although the decision is a bold and politically risky attempt to confront
 fundamental problems in the Chinese economy, it is not, in our view, a turning
 point for economic policy, nor is it a surprising announcement of some
 historic new trend, i.e. the reintroduction of capitalism.  Rather, it
 represents an acceleration of the reform drive that began in late 1978, and a
 deepening of the shift away from concentration on rural policy and toward
 urban reform that Zhao introduced at the May NPC.
 The document cites four characteristics of China's Soviet-style economic
 structure that have drained enterprises of their initiative and vitality:
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87M0l 152R000400520014-1
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 -- The lack of clear distinction between functions of government and
 industry.
 -- "Excessive and rigid" state control.
 -- An inadequate role for prices and markets.
 -- The practice of "absolute egalitarianism."
 It demands the creation of a "new socialist economic structure with Chinese
 charactertistics," where major assets continue to be owned by the state, but
 where enterprise managers are free to respond in a competitive way to market
 signals.  In the words of the document,  the party seeks to create a system
 where "ownership can be duly separated from the power of operation."
 A New Relationship Between Government and Enterprise.
 The structural changes called for in the decision are basically intended
 to remove the state and party from most day-to-day business decisions.  To
 accomplish this, the entire national economic planning apparatus will be
 revamped.  Strict mandatory plans, which previously dictated production and
 allocation quotas for most sectors of the economy, will now be applied only
 where essential commodities are involved.2 According to the decision, other
 2China recently published a partial list of essential
 commodities, which included coal, oil and petroleum products,
 steel, non-ferrous metals, timber, cement, chemicals,
 electricity, munitions and other items.  Agricultural products on
 the list included cereals, cotton, edible oils, tobacco, pigs and
 some aquatic products.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 products and economic activities, which are far more numerous, should either
 come under guidance plans or be left entirely to the operation of the market.
 Guidance plans are to be "rough and flexible" guidelines on how much of
 each particular good the state deems desirable.  Enterprises will be required
 to give first consideration to these plans, but where local conditions make
 implementation of guidance plans unreasonable--for example, because of energy
 shortages or peculiarities in supply and demand--the firms will be free to
 deviate from plan without penalty.  Enforcement of guidance plans will,be
 accomplished mainly through the use of economic levers such as interest rates,
 bank lending policies, and taxes.
 Enterprise management responsibilities are to be greatly expanded.
 Specifically, most enterprises are expected to become "relatively independent
 economic entities," responsible for their own profits and losses.  Not only
 will they have more control over what and how much they produce and over their
 finances, they will also have authority--within as yet undefined limits--to
 hire and fire workers, to set wages and bonuses, and even to set product
 prices.
 Although the new program calls for a weakening of the role played by
 state bureaucracies, their power nevertheless remains significant.  By any
 objective standard, China's economy will remain socialist in its essentials.
 In addition to the continued importance of the central planning apparatus and
 strict control over products of national importance, the state will continue
 to appoint and remove key enterprise managers and hence to exert a powerful,
 if indirect, influence on production decisions.  Moreover, when enterprises
 experience financial problems, it is the state that will determine which firms
 will be subsidized, and which will be forced to merge or shut down.

 Price Reform--The Key to Success.
 The plenum brought to an end the party's reluctance--perhaps for fear of
 sparking potentially destabilizing inflation, hoarding, and speculation--to
 come to grips with the problem of irrational prices.  The plenum document
 explicity recommends establishment of a "rational price system," calling it
 "the key to reform of the entire economic structure.."  The fact that Beijing
 hopes to have its now totally irrational price system corrected in only five
 years is an indication of the party's commitment to rapid reform.
 To carry out its program, Beijing will gradually reduce the number of
 items subject to state-set fixed prices.  Most product prices will be allowed
 to fluctuate--according to changes in supply and demand--within narrow bands
 set by the state.  Floating prices will be used for a small number of consumer
 products and for most services provided by individual entrepreneurs.  For
 essential goods, the state will retain tight control, but major adjustments
 are probable even here as Beijing attempts to bring its raw material and
 energy prices into line with the current world economic situation.3
 Recognizing the sensitivity of the local population to price changes--
 many Chinese remember the hyperinflation of the late 1940s--Beijing's plans
 for rationalizing prices are cautious.  The plenum document emphasizes that
 price reform will be implemented "gradually, in a step-by-step" fashion.  It
 promises that "the real income of urban and rural inhabitants will not go down
 as a result of price readjustments."  The document also warns potential
 entrepreneurs that it is "absolutely impermissible for any unit or person to
 boost prices at will by taking advantage of the reform."
 3Coal, which is greatly underpriced in China, will             probably
 be one of the first targets of state-controlled price
 adjustment.

 The Short-term Outlook
 The current effort to speed up industrial reform came too late to have
 much impact on economic performance in 1984.  Even so, the economy will
 probably boast rapid growth again this year.  Industrial production rose at an
 11.6-percent rate in the first six months of 1984 with light and heavy
 industry moving at matching rates of 11.5 and 11.7 percent respectively.  We
 estimate that China's GNP for the year may rise 10 percent.  Energy output
 during the first half increased a 7 percent; however, we believe that output
 for the year as a whole will run about 6 percent, because of fourth quarter
 .problems in the power sector.
 The agricultural sector is also expected to perform well again this
 year.  Grain production may top the record harvest of 1983 by 5 percent.
 Despite the increase, the PRC claims it will honor import commitments under
 its grain agreements with the United States, Canada, Australia, and
 Argentina.  The record harvests are, however, making it less likely that China
 will want to renegotiate expiring agreements.  Cotton output will probably
 also rise sharply again this year, perhaps by as much as 20 percent.  (C)
 There are preliminary indications that the domestic financial situation
 may also be mending somewhat.  State revenue collections reportedly rose 23
 percent during the first six months of 1984 as Beijing's new Audit
 Administration began conducting spot checks on enterprises across the
 country.  On the expenditure side, however, Beijing apparently continues to be
 plagued by large price subsidies and increasing demands for budgetary outlays
 for infrastructure.  We expect China to run about a 6 billion yuan deficit for
 the year, slightly less than in 1983, but considerably larger than the
 fiscally conservative government prefers.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 China's international financial picture--already one of the strongest
 worldwide--will probably improve further in 1984.  So far this year,
 preliminary figures show exports continuing to outpace imports by a wide
 margin.  Although we expect this trend to begin reversing itself soon, export
 growth will remain strong during the year--at about 10-15 percent.  Imports
 could approch $24 billion or a growth rate of 25-30 percent on the strength of
 Western equipment and technology sales.  The resulting $2-4 billion trade
 surplus will probably boost total reserves to more than $23 billion by
 December 1984, and China's debt service ratio could drop another percentage
 point to less than .5 percent.
 Economic Problems Ahead.
 Introducing price reform into China's shortage-driven economy probably
 poses the most immediate threat to the reform program.  The plenum's call for
 price reform reportedly sparked a few bank runs and some panic buying last
 month, despite assurances that prices would be adjusted slowly and that
 consumer income would not be allowed to suffer.  Further problems can be
 expected as Beijing attempts to bring prices for essential goods such as
 cereals, industrial raw materials, and coal into line with costs.
 Beijing is committed to immediate price adjustment, but it also clearly
 recognizes the potential for panic that price reform raises, and will move
 very deliberately to implement changes.  In fact, we believe the risk that the
 leadership will move too slowly with essential price adjustments (and stall
 the entire reform package) is greater than the risk that too rapid an advance
 will spark economic instability.  Nevertheless, it is safe to assume that
 price reform will be somewhat inflationary in the short run.  Most adjustments
 will probably be upward, and important products such as coal, oil', and certain
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 foodstuffs will eventually undergo steep revisions.  The reforms may
 occasionally spark bouts of panic buying as consumers draw down savings
 deposits that are now at record levels.  Beijing is most likely to respond to
 these periodic bouts by limiting bank withdrawals, ordering producers to hold
 the line on prices, and by raising interest rates and taxes to discourage
 consumption.
 Another economic hurdle that the leadership must cross in the immediate
 future is the question of corporate bankruptcy.  Last year, nearly one-fourth
 of China's industrial enterprises were unprofitable, and this year, even after
 the government exerted strong pressure for improvement, 16 percent are still
 operating in the red.  Clearly, Beijing cannot allow a massive shutdown of
 such a large portion of its industrial base.  Furthermore, until reform is in
 place, there is no effective way of determining which enterprises deserve
 closing.  Despite the fact that continued subsidization of losing enterprises
 encourages inefficient behavior all around, we believe Beijing will probably
 be cautious and allow a large number of inefficient firms to continue to
 operate.
 Where the government decides some firms must be forced to close, the
 accompanying unemployment problems may be locally destabilizing.  Beijing has
 historically prohibited the free movement, of the population in order to
 prevent massive migration from the countryside to the cities.  If major
 industries are allowed to fold, certain geographic areas could face high
 unemployment rates for long periods of time.  We believe this problem will
 reinforce Beijing's inclination to accept inefficiency rather than promote
 other serious problems.
 In light of the many problems, we do not expect the benefits of urban
 reform to match those experienced under the agricultural reform program.  But
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 neither does Beijing.  The government is allowing itself five years to get the
 program in place and probably will hail even minor improvements in efficiency
 during that period as evidence of success.  The fact that Beijing is going
 into this program with its economic eyes open increases the probability that
 it will be able to resist pressures to revert to tight central planning when
 problems arise.  Nevertheless, the next year will provide a critical test of
 the government's willingness to accept the dislocations necessary to carry the
 program through.
 Longer Term Prospects
 The Agricultural Sector--More Gains
 In the longer term, the question of how well the economic reforms will
 achieve China's avowed goal of quadrupling output by the year 2000 depends
 critically on several factors.  In agriculture, many of the productivity gains
 accompanying the introduction of the contract responsibility system were one-
 time achievements.  Future gains will probably come more slowly as farmers
 gradually introduce new technology and as more underemployed laborers leave
 the land to pursue non-agricultural employment.  Nor can Beijing's good luck
 with weather continue indefinitely.  Consecutive years of widespread natural
 disaster could cut crop yields dramatically, especially if laborers under the
 contract responsibility system resist leaving their own plots to engage in
 dike repair or rescue operations that may not be directly beneficial to
 them.
 Other factors, however, bode well for continued improvement in
 agricultural productivity.  The rapid increase in production of consumer
 durables will continue to motivate Chinese farm workers.  Commercial reforms
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 that speed the delivery of farm goods to urban markets and urban goods to the
 rural sector will also help.  If banking reforms boost domestic interest rates
 further, as we anticipate, this too should give the already cash-rich rural
 population additional incentive to boost agricultural output.
 On the whole we believe the positive factors outweigh the negative and we
 anticipate annual gains in the value of agricultural output of between 5 and 7
 percent over the next few years.  The gains should enable Beijing in most
 years to devote the bulk of its foreign exchange reserves to equipment and
 technology rather than to agricultural imports.  Nevertheless, as both rural
 and urban incomes expand, food consumption will probably also rise sharply.
 This--combined with the massive problem China already has in moving grain to
 urban consumers--will, we believe, result in continued purchases of sizable
 quantities of US grain, even in years of better-than-average weather.  Poor
 climatic conditions in consecutive years would probably deplete grain reserves
 and bring China back into world markets in a big way.
 Military--More Technology But Limited Expenditures
 With the renewed emphasis on economic reform we expect defense spending
 to remain at relatively modest levels.  To bring about qualitative, if
 gradual, improvement of defense capabilities and to appease the military
 leadership that is eager to modernize, Beijing will, however, probably
 continue to increase the import of Western military-related technology.  The
 purchase in 1984 of 24 Sikorsky medium lift helicopters for $150 million is
 evidence of this turn westward.  The military has a strong economic argument
 in support of its desire to boost imports; since 1979, exports of Chinese
 military hardware abroad have generated several billion in foreign exchange,
 well in excess of anything currently being requested.

 Industry--Major Obstacles Ahead
 Long term success in the industrial sector depends heavily on how fast
 and effectively some of the new reforms can be implemented.  Despite Deng's
 efforts, there is still considerable opposition within the party bureaucracy
 to further expansion of the reforms.  There are those with grave ideological
 reservations about the program, and those who fear that Deng's concomitant
 demand that the party upgrade the expertise of party leaders, as well as
 enterprise managers, will cost them their jobs.  Since the task of
 implementing new reforms rests heavily on these mid-level cadre, we expect
 progress to be neither smooth nor rapid, as they seek by various bureaucratic
 methods to impede the progress of changes they view as threatening.
 Beijing already has achieved some success in removing party cadre from
 the economic decisionmaking process and installing trained technicians in
 their place.  Hu Yaobang recently told Japanese officials that nearly 1
 million veteran cadre have left their posts since the government began its
 efforts to upgrade its managerial expertise, and 2 million will have retired
 by yearend 1984.  Further progress in this political aspect of reform will
 improve the chances for overall success.
 Other institutional changes needed to buttress reforms will probably
 continue to develop slowly.  Despite major reforms in the banking system,
 there is evidence that local pressures, not economic factors, continue to
 determine the direction of loans.  Nor has Beijing been very successful at
 replacing budgetary allocations with loans.  This suggests that enterprises
 still lack the incentives necessary to force them to make efficient investment
 decisions.  The productivity of capital is unlikely to show marked
 improvements until Beijing achieves better results with its banking reform.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 Efforts to revitalize the commercial system may generate considerable
 efficiency gains.  The difficulties that stem from China's inadequate road and
 rail system are compounded by bureaucratic problems that accompany tight state
 control over transport activities.  Although it would take a masssive
 investment program to eliminate Beijing's transportation problems, we believe
 that the increased involvement of individuals and cooperative enterprises in
 middleman activities will alleviate a significant number of the distribution
 problems that now plague Chinese industries.
 We anticipate that, over the longer term, devolution of the decisions on
 hiring, firing, wages and prices to managers will improve enterprise
 efficiency.  As more enterprises are required to market their own products,
 quality will undoubtedly improve and a wider variety, of goods can be expected
 on Chinese markets.  Since small firms producing nonessential goods will be
 given the most leeway, they will probably be the first to show marked
 improvements.  Progress within large, state-run enterprises producing major
 goods will, we believe , occur more slowly.
 Despite some short term problems as the government carries out price
 adjustment policies, we do not believe there is significant risk of serious
 long-term inflation.  For this to occur, the government would have to be
 willing to sustain the increases in consumer demand by printing money.
 Although some subsidies or wage increases will be offered in the early stages
 of the adjustment process--to help ease concerns about eroding purchasing
 power--the conservative government is unlikely to resort to long-term use of
 the printing press to finance consumer spending.
 On the whole, we believe the gains from current reform will lead to some
 efficiency gains as early as next year.  Although Beijing is likely to be
 disappointed at the rate of progress, the fact that the economy is moving in
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 the right direction should give impetus to further change.  If, however,
 Beijing backs away from price reforms, the overall reform program could lose
 steam rapidly.  Under such a scenario, Beijing might be forced as early as
 1986 to move back toward greater central control.
 If Beijing can resist political pressure to ease off on reforms in the
 face of mounting problems, we believe long-term productivity will increase and
 economic growth will accelerate.  Government efforts to encourage surplus
 labor to take up private commerce and service activities have considerable
 potential for increasing both agricultural and industrial productivity.  The
 renewed emphasis on enterprise autonomy also bodes well for productivity
 increases, some of which will go unobserved in Beijing as enterprises attempt
 to understate profits to avoid taxes.
 A final threat to the continuing rapid advance of economic reform is the
 health of China's 80 year old leader, Deng Xiaoping.  Although Deng's
 successors are firmly committed to the reform policies--and indeed, Hu Yaobang
 and Zhao Ziyang have staked their political futures on success--they still
 lack Deng's political clout and tenacity.  If one of the more prestigious
 advocates of central planning--such as Peng Zhen, Li Xiannian or Chen Yun--is
 able to succeed to Deng's pivotal role as power broker and final authority, we
 believe that he might at least attempt to curb some of the more experimental
 aspects of reform.  In our view, however, a modicum of success for economic
 reform programs will enhance the prospects for Hu and Zhao to succeed Deng
 smoothly.,
 A Worst Case Assessment.
 Deng and his allies have indicated they expect that the early going will
 be rough and are prepared to ride out short term problems, such as panic
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 buying and isolated runs on banks.  If those problems persist, or get worse,
 critics of reform will almost certainly seize on the dislocations to call for
 a return to direct central control, even though this alternative has
 demonstrably failed to promote efficiency in the past.  Although reform
 advocates seem to hold the balance in party councils now, party and military
 conservatives could coalesce into a potentially powerful political bloc if
 economic problems became socially destabilizing.
 Even if Beijing manages to weather its inevitable short-term problems,
 Deng's death or a combination of incremental breakdowns--such as floods,
 drought, a succession of poor harvests, a rapid rise in undesirable side
 effects of economic expansion such as price gouging, speculation, or graft--
 could over the longer term tip the political scales against reform and lead to
 a retreat.
 Retrenchment on reforms would confront the party with serious
 sociopolitical difficulties as it sought to reassert its control down to the
 local level.  At a minimum, the party leadership would again be seen as
 vacillating and unconcerned with the common welfare, precisely the image it
 seeks to dispel by implementing new policies.  At worst, disaffected peasants
 or workers might engage in active or passive resistance.  The failure of
 reform would almost certainly bring on a protracted period of political
 instability, as leaders struggled for the right to affix the blame.
 Implications for the United States
 In our judgment, implementation of the reforms will both broaden and
 deepen China's ties with the United States and the West.  The emphasis on
 technological innovation at the plant level, foreign capital acquisition, and
 increased joint ventures will expand investment and trade opportunities for US
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520014-1
 and Western businesses.  In addition, we expect that Chinese enterprise
 managers will take advantage of their new flexibility to tap the West for
 increased amounts of information, training, and managerial expertise.
 At the same time, however, the reforms will aggravate some current
 problems in US-China relations.  It can be expected that Chinese enterprises
 will want greater access to Western markets to sell their products--largely
 textiles and light industrial goods--so Beijing's pressure on Washington to
 lower trade barriers will increase.  Similarly, Beijing will probably press
 Washington harder on technology transfer .in response to both its needs for
 economic and military modernization and the demands of its own enterprises.
 It is also likely that China will reduce its grain imports from the West as
 its agricultural production continues to improve.
 In the five years since the "open door,"--one of China's most fundamental
 reforms--was introduced, two-way trade with the United States has burgeoned
 from $1.1 billion in 1978 to a peak of $5.5 billion in 1981 before receding
 slightly to $4.4 billion last year.  US investors have reportedly put $90
 million into joint ventures in China, US oil companies have probably spent an
 additional $300 million in offshore oil exploration, and Occidental Petrolemn
 Company is involved in a coal mining joint ventures that may generate $400-600
 million in machinery, equipment, and technology sales.  As long as the
 reformers continue to hold China's economic policies we believe these economic
 ties with the West will expand.
 Beijing's continued success with economic reform could also prove to be a
